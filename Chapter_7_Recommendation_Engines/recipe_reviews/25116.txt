Living the gluten free life here.  I substituted butter for margarine (of course), but otherwise followed the recipe.  Interestingly, there is no cashew flavor while eating it, but there is a strong cashew aftertaste.  Nice gluten free recipe with a perfect "cookie crumble" to it.  In fact, I've substituted this mix of tapioca/corn/potato flour directly for wheat flour in other cookie recipes and they've turned out great (albeit with a slight corny flavor).

I substituted Soy Flour for Corn flour and extra peanut butter since I didn't have cashew butter.  I also added Nestle's new Swirled chocolate chips and they were fantastic!  I didn't have time to roll them into balls so I just dropped them by teaspoon fulls and they came out great.  I'll definately make these again and try even more variations!

This is a really great recipe, my dad can't eat wheat so I'm always trying new recipes for him! I did change a few thigngs though: I omitted the cashew butter because we didn't have any, I replaced the corn flour with rice flour and the potato flour with sorghum flour. I also added about 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts and a cup of chocolate chips! They were great and chewy, you can't tell these are wheat free!

These are really yummy.  My daughter is newly diagnosed with celiac and dairy sensitivity and these were a big hit with her.  My son and all their friends (and, okay, me too :)) scarfed most of them down yesterday so I think I am going to make some more today!  The cashew taste was very subtle - though I added chocolate chips which probably added to that.  I think I may make these sometimes with all peanut butter for the nut butters and then another time with all cashew butter.  I bet almond butter would be great too, and they'd be good with or without the chocolate chips.

These are awesome!!! I didn't tell anyone they didn't have flour in them and no one noticed. I used butter instead of margarine, and all peanut butter. They are great and I will make them again.

I  have just been diagnosed myself w/glc, so needless to say..I am experimenting. I was so amazed at how these tatsted after hearing all I have from others about having to eat the way we do from baking the way we do. This was a pleasure to bake and eat. I did substitute butter instead of margarine and used 1/2 the corn flour mixture and substituted it w/ rice flour instead for the remaining half. excellent thanks!

Ok, I'm sorry to say, these were not good at all.  The corn flour is way too strong in flavor and texture.  I wish I had substituted with corn starch.

Slight modifications made this DELICIOUS! Easy and tasty. I didn't have cashew butter. I used 1c of chunky peanut butter. Reduced corn flour to 1/4c, used 1/4c corn starch to compensate. I used brown rice flour instead of potato flour.  I made 2 batches: 1 with chocolate chips, one without. cooking time was closer to 12-15 minutes, that could be because I used more PB. With the chocolate chip batch I used parchment paper, and cooked them until the edges began to brown. With or without chips, they are very good.

These cookies are wonderful! You really cannot tell that they are wheat/gluten-free, which is quite an accomplishment, as anyone who's ever tried GF baked goods will know.

Used gluten free flour mix instead of flours.  Made 1/4 cup cashew butter by blending 1/2 cup cashews and 1/2 tbsp oil.

These are wonderful cookies -- the texture is perfect.  I had almond and hazelnut butter on hand (not a big fan of peanut butter) and also put in 2/3 cup chocolate chips.  Thank you!

I rate these a 3 because the recipe needs some more experimentation to suit them to my taste, however, it's a good recipe overall in that it's quick and easy to make.  I used Splenda for the white sugar, Smart Balance margarine because I didn't have casein-free margarine, used egg whites for the eggs, gluten-free baking mix, and semi-chocolate chips.  These are good, and I'll definitely make these again, but I might double the nut butters, and add even more chocolate chips. They could also use a little bit more sweetness but that may be because I used the Splenda.

I searched for a recipe that had cashew butter because I couldn't stand eating it fresh from the container. I used all cashew butter because I needed to get rid of the whole container. I also used butter instead of margarine. And I used 1/2 cup of amaranth flour because I have some that I barely use and wanted to experiment. And I used 3/4 cup of all purpose flour. I also grounded up 3/4 cup old fashion oats and added it before baking. The cookie tasted surprisingly good. It doesn't have a strong cashew butter taste. It actually tastes more like honey. The cookie didn't taste grainy either and I can't tell that there are oats in it.

I loved it! I used All Purpose Gluten Free Baking Flour and butter. I used only the peanut butter and added pecan nuts.

I used regular (organic) white flour and cashew butter only. They came out great but next time, I will use more cashew butter and less margarine. The cashew taste was too subtile!

I played around a lot with this recipe and made it with regular flour and just cashew butter. The cookie dough tasted just amazing. It was like toffee or caramel, and once it baked the cookies came out very cake like and delicate, with a light nutty flavor. They might do well with a bit of burned butter frosting, although I'm not sure if they're sturdy enough to handle it. Even so, they're quite good on their own.
