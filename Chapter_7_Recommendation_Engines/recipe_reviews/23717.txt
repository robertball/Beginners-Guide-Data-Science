I used Italian Sausage (Jimmy Dean's) in place of beef- which was INCREDIBLE, cottage cheese in place of ricotta and parmesan in place of romano.  I also used 2 jars of spaghetti sauce and 1/2 cups (1 package shredded all together) extra mozzerella.  Also added a couple cloves of minced garlic.  Can't leave that out!!
It was the absolutely the best lasagna ever!  I also used the no-cook lasagna noodles and just put them in the dish dry, it worked great- and saved a lot of time and mess.  I highly recommend these changes to anyone.  I will be making it again and again.  My boyfriend was ecstatic as well!

A really good recipe for lasagna.  Very easy to make.   I used the suggestion of sausage instead of hamburger meat.  That worked very well, but I am going to try the hamburger next time for the texture.  Definitely needed A LOT more pasta sauce.  If you are going to try this, triple what the original recipe calls for in this regard.

Fantastic. I used the suggestions of all the reviewers to make sure that this turned out well. First, I added a few cloves of minced garlic to the meat. I also kept the ricotta/romano mixture (to which I added a beaten egg and a package of frozen spinach) separate from the meat/sauce mixture. For the sauce I used my favorite garden vegetable chunky spaghetti sauce. This made for a lasagna that my boyfriend claims is my best yet! By the way, half a package of lasagna noodles would have been sufficient. I ended up throwing away half of the pound. Thank you for the recipe!

I made this last night for dinner with friends and they loved it! I read the reviews and made some changes. I used no boil noodles and used a total of 12 (4 layers of 3 across). I added a tablespoon of garlic to the meat mixture because I love garlic and left out the salt and pepper (it didn't need it). I used 2 cups of ricotta and 2 cups of cottage cheese. I also used a Romano/Parmesan mixture. I used more sauce than the recipe called for - almost 2 jars. I also added a box of frozen spinach to the cheese mixture and did not mix the meat sauce with it, layering it instead. I only used 1 zucchini and that seemed to be plenty. The basil leaves added a wonderful flavor. I love meat lasagna and veggie lasnaga - this was the best of both worlds!

Is the amount of ricotta cheese a misprint? This was my first time making lasagna and I picked this recipe because I like chesse. But the ricotta was waaaay too overpowering for my homemade spaghetti sauce and the dish turned out to be really disgusting. If I was to try to make this recipe again I would use half as much ricotta. Yuck.

I am only giving this 4 stars because I took the advice of a fellow rater and decreased the ricotta by half. It turned out great! And I did also use more spaghetti sauce.

It was fair sounding! First, I eliminated the zucchini & substituted morel mushrooms,then I ommitted the ground beef & added real Italian sausage (not Jimmy Dean).Lastly I always spread a scim of my prepared Italian sauce on the bottom of my pan ,insuring both moisture & taste from top to bottom! These ...kicked it up a notch!

Not bad! However, when I made it (following the recipe) it tasted like it was missing something. It needed a little more flavor.

This is not the best lasagna.  My family thought it needed more sauce and the taste was sort of bland.

The only thing I would change about this simple recipe is: saute the onions separately so they are well cooked. Thin slice the zucchini so it cooks well. Add another half cup to a cup of spaghetti sauce. I had to increase the cooking time too, but I had double the recipe and had two pans in the oven, so that may have had something to do with it.

The idea of combining the sauce with the ricotta wasn't a good idea.  It just turned my whole thing into mush and was not appealing.  The ingredients are great with one substitution of sausage instead of ground meat, but combining the cheese with sauce is not something I'd ever do. It made my lasagna look lazy.

I did not like that the meat, sauce and cheeses were all mixed together. Next time I will leave the cheese mixture separate.

Delicious! When it was served it looked like it was from a restaurant.  We added sausage instead of hambuger and used two jars of sauce.  Very easy to follow, my nine year old son did most of it!

I have never enjoyed my lasagnas before but this was perfect! Here are my changes: I sauteed onion, garlic, mushrooms and celery then added a 540 ml can of diced tomatoes, tomato soup and a can of tomato paste. Then I added my ground beef and cooked (I like to cook the ground beef in the tomato sauce so that it is more moist and tender). I mixed together the ricotta cheese and a package of frozen spinach. I layered the meat sauce, lasagna noodles then more meat sauce followed with the noodles then added a layer of the cheese and spinach mix and topped it with the zucchini slices, noodles, meat sauce and Kraft Italiano Shreeded cheese. Very Yummy!

Pretty good, but I should have listened to the others when it said it needed more sauce. Either way this was really tasty, I'd make it again.

This was very good, however next time I will omit the layer of fresh basil, it was a little to strong for both my husband and I.  Otherwise I added some crushed red pepper to my sauce, because we like our sauce spicy, and also added a small layer of sauce to the bottom of my pan.  Good recipe overall, fed my husband and I for a few days!

There is nothing "best" about this recipe.  We do not eat pasta very often because of diet restrictions, so when we do we want it to be really good.  It was edible, but I will not make this again. bland, boring, what more can I say.

I had zucchini to use so I tried this recipe.  I used the bottom layer with lasagna noodles that don't need to be boiled. The rest of the layers I used zucchini. I left out the Italian seasoning because I didn't have any. The fresh basil smells wonderful while it's baking. I will make this again.

This recipe was ok. I have NEVER made lasagna and the directions were easy to follow. I did not have the italian seasoning or fresh basil, but i did use   dried basil. My boyfriend and I thought that it should have more sauce in it as it was a tad dry. The color on the inside was kind of gross as the little amount of sauce made a raw meat looking filling. The zucchini was a nice touch though, I love zucchini :)

Awful. No taste or contrasting textures.

Was wonderful.  It was my first meal that I prepared.  The only thing I would do different, is add more red sause.  It was delicious!  Will be making this dish in the future!

This was a great lasagna and so easy and quick to make.  I did a mixture of ricotta cheese and cottage cheese. My family loved it and the left overs were even better the next day. Will be making again.

This lasagna was good, but it was missing something.  It just didn't jump out at me.

I love this recipe.  I have made it twice so far and it has been a big hit both times.  Even my Father loves it and he isnt a big lasagna fan.

A nice typical lasagna recipe...For those who complain about too much water, use less sauce, and to ramp up the flavor, try using garlic and fennel seeds to the ground beef!  Enjoy everyone, and Thanks Kristen for a very user-friendly version of this great dish!

I thought the amount of ricotta was good, but I felt I needed to double, if not triple, the amount of mozzarella.  Maybe the type of pasta sauce I used was not a good choice (Classico) because the bottom of the dish was an inch deep in liquid when finished baking.  I wonder if anyone else had this problem?  Otherwise, it was edible.  I can see why other reviewers chose to substitute in sausage, instead.

Very flavorful and wonderful I used the no boil lasagne noodles and this decreased prep time.
