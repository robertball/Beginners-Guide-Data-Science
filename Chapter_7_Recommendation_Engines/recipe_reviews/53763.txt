SAUCE REVIEW.  This review is for the sauce only.  I live in Sweden and needed a fast sauce to make with the meatballs that I had just made.  I thought that I had a sauce pre-made, only to find out that I was wrong.  Sheesh.... Anyway, I made this sauce, which looked strange to me, but, I was desperate.  Well, I ended up making mashed potatoes and having the meatballs with slices of cucumber instead.  A Swedish meat sauce should be brown like gravy, not creamy and definetly not like this one.  And just another comment, the IKEA sauce for the swedish meatballs is actually very close to the made from scratch sauce.

Well, I wish I could write two reviews for this recipe.  Good news or bad first?  I'll start with the bad-we were not impressed with the sauce recipe by any means.  Thankfully we all taste-tested it prior to adding the meatballs.  I whipped up a white cream sauce as an emergency alternative since the other sauce was pretty much inedible.  Ok, on to the good part.  The meatball recipe here is excellent, I was very impressed with flavor and texture-they will be good with other sauces and I look forward to preparing them again.  Hope others have better luck than I did with the sauce!

Yowza is right Kari! These were incredible to say the least. I don't normally eat red meat merely because I don't really care for it, however, there's always an exception to every rule and this was it! I've spent many years looking for the perfect S.M. recipe and my search has finally ended. I did make a couple of changes to suit out tastes. To the meat mixture I added more seasonings; garlic and onion powders, etc. After the meatballs were cooked in the oven, I took them out of the casserole dish and placed them on a separate plate. I added beef broth (not water) to the casserole dish and cooked on a low flame in order to loosen the browned bits from the bottom. I then used that to make the sauce. No matter what any recipe calls for, I always double the amount of liquid. In this case I added two cans of low salt cream of mushroom soup. Again Kari, I'm totally impressed with your wonderful recipe and so were my hubby and kids. Thanks!

This wound up being a great recipe, but I made SIGNIFICANT changes to the sauce.  I hate it when people review when they've made a lot of changes, but I think the sauce recipe, as written, must be a mistake.  I wouldn't want anyone to take the time to make this to be disappointed with the outcome. when just a few changes made a fabulous sauce.  I did make the meatballs with ground turkey (since that was all I had), and they turned out quite well - other than that, I made them as written.  For the sauce, I used butter instead of oil, chicken stock instead of water (but use beef stock if you are using beef/pork for the meatballs) and just a bit of salt.  I'm not afraid to use salt in my cooking, but a whole tablespoon here has to be a mistake.  The sauce turned out so good, I made it again and served it with roasted chicken.

Excellent with the sauce change left by another user: 2 cans cream of mushroom soup, hot sauce, 1/2 cup milk, 1 cup sour cream or plain yogurt.  Very good, my husband was raving!

This review is for the meatballs ONLY as I used a different sauce. The mix of ground beef and ground pork is perfect for these.  They were very good.  I used 1/4 c. of finely chopped onion vs. 1/2 c. and upped the bread crumbs to 1 cup. I used 2 tbsp. of milk, added some garlic powder and 1/4 tsp. of allspice. I baked these at 450 for 15 minutes.  For the sauce I used "Basic White Sauce" from this site that I added dried parsley, garlic, worchestershire sauce, dried minced onion, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and a little sour cream.  I served everything over egg noodles and my husband loved it.

DO NOT USE THIS SAUCE!!!! Whomever loved this recipe, I'm willing to bet they have a psychological addiction to salt.  The meatballs were okay, but still contained WAY too much salt.  I should have known, when I was adding the amount of salt they told me to add, a red flag went up and I thought... this is more salt than I have ever added to any recipe of this amount of meat and/or sauce ingredients.  Don't ask me how I knew, it was just WRONG.  I have not re-tried this recipe without the salt, but I'm suggesting that if you really want to use this recipe, you may try using 1/4 the pepper, 1/4 the salt in both the sauce and the meatballs and then, MAYBE it will be okay.    I would not reccomend this recipe.

This was an excellent recipe, but I was horrified when I read the nutritional information. I made a couple changes to make it less fattening - I used lean groud turkey instead of the beef and pork, and I also used skim milk. The only other changes I made was that I added fresh garlic and other spices. It was delicious! I used a different sauce which consisted of 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, 1 cup of reduced fat sour cream, skim milk, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce. The recipe was incredible!

One must remember to read the reviews before trying any recipe.  Too much salt in the sauce. End of story.  Reduce salt to 1 teaspoon and everything comes out just fine.  But, as written, the recipe gets only one lonely star.

This is the best homemade Swedish meatball recipe i have ever used. Modified a little but great. I work at a restaurant and used this for a lunch special and it went off without a hitch. loved by all at the Greek restaurant I work in. THank you...After reading others reviews it seems many people were knocking the SAUCE...People if you cook your meatballs half way and then place them in the sauce to finish in the oven this sauce turns brown and has a true swedish flavor...remember a recipie is a base for your creation dont knock it till you have modded it... :)

My husband is the pickiest eater and loved them.  I did use onion powder in place of the chopped onions. I also used olive oil instead of veg oil for the sauce. The sauce did not taste good alone , but when mixed with the meatballs was very good.  I will make this again very soon.  Thanks.

I was looking for a recipe for Christmas Eve and came across this one.  If you authentic SM, don't use hot sauce or garlic or mushrooms.  The spice the Swedish use besides salt and pepper is allspice.  Butter is the correct fat and the flavor from the sauce is from the browned meatballs.  If needed, use a little beef broth.  This info comes from my brother-in-law directly from Sweden.

The salt content in this recipe was WAY to high.  I recognized this immediately and halved it.  It was still too much.  I would also recommend cutting down on the paprika.  Cut down on the salt and I would give the meatballs 3 1/2 stars.

We went to Ikea, a Swedish-based department store, and got Swedish meatballs at their restaurant. They were delicious and we wanted to find one exactly like it. This was the closest we've come. Made with 1 lb. ground pork, 1/2 lb. ground beef based to ingredients on hand. Cut the salt in sauce down to 1 teaspoon, and it was awesome!! Served with egg noodles and mashed potatoes. My mom claimed they were better than Ikea's!!!!
Just made these for a second time, the RIGHT way, with 1 lb. ground beef and 1/2 lb. ground pork. Just as good, I could barely taste the difference! I also added a little more flour to the sauce to make it slightly thicker. Served to company and they loved it!

It was very bland. Really all the sauce is made up of is flour, water and sour cream. Will definitely have to make changes next time.  Heres some suggestions:  use chicken or beef stock instead of water add cream of mushroom soup to the sauce as well put worcestershire in sause as well as meatballs add garlic or onion powder  Hope that helps

The meatballs were good.  The sauce was BAD.  It was weak and had no flavor.  I thought it was a bad idea to add water to the sauce, but I did it anyway.... I threw it out and made a different sauce.

The meatballs were very good.  I used my own sauce which is not Swedish at all.  Thin a can of cream of mushroom soup with your favorite barbecue sauce until it is the right consistency.  No one can ever guess what ingredients are in the sauce.  Thanks for the meatball recipe.  I may even try it with marinara sauce.

This is almost identical to my Swedish Meatball recipe. The difference is that I brown mine in oil on the stovetop, then make the gravy on the basis of the drippings. I use milk insted of water and usually add some beef base or bullion

I just cooked this for my boyfriend and I thought it was really bland. I gave it a C+ and he gave it a B-. If you decide to do this recipe anyway, take it out at the 30 min and briefly fry them in butter or something that would give it some flavor. Then add the sauce, but instead of using boiling water, use beef stock. Then eat the meatball with lingonberries (or cranberries) to add some more taste to it.

As I read what other reviewers said about the salt in this recipe I was curious and so checked my 1976 Betty Crocker cookbook. I was surprised to find it is the identical recipe with the exception of the amount of salt and pepper.  It used the same amount of salt in the meatballs but only 1/8 tsp of pepper and the sauce uses 1/2 tsp salt and 1/8 tsp of pepper.  I did use this recipe then making a couple of changes from other recipes and reviews I read.  I sauteed the onions first, used broth in the sauce instead of water and used 2/3 butter and 1/3 oil.  It tastes good but I am taking it for a lunch at work tomorrow so will know then how everyone likes it.  I'm going to add a little nutmeg as well.  I'm sure the basic recipe is good if salt and pepper are modified.

The meat balls recipe was awesome. Because of the sauce reveiw, I didn't even try it, but went with Linda McLean's sauce, and the whole thing just rocked. Awesome combonation! I would have given it a 5 star rating if it were'nt for the sauce listing.

This recipe was awesome, but waay too salty.  Definitely going to to cut the salt in half for next time so it's more edible.  I replaced the water with 2 cups of beef stock and added 8 oz of sour cream AND a can of cream of mushroom soup.  It really would've been fantastic with less salt. :(

Cut the salt for the meatballs in half (from 2 tsp to 1 tsp), and we didn't care for the sauce for the meatballs until we added a packet of dry mushroom flavored gravy. Then it was delicious. Meatballs were a bit on the spicy side, and not very firm because of the addition of ground pork to the ground beef. I'll probably make again though.

This was an amazing sauce recipe.  I used pre-made meatballs and altered the recipe slightly by increasing to a cup of sour cream and about a half tablespoon of dried onion.  I baked the frozen meatballs while I made the sauce, but because they were precooked, it only took the dish about twenty minutes total: ten to warm the meatballs, and a little over ten after smothering them in the sauce.  We put ours over buttered egg noodles... similar to beef stroganoff, but better!

I was craving meatballs last night, and found this recipe. It was WONDERFUL!!!!! I was so impressed that I asked my best friend to stop in and try it,....well she is making it tonight!!! The only things I changed were #1 omit pork (I don't eat it),#2 add onion and garlic powder to meat mixture, and #3 I cooked the meatballs in the oil and then used that to make the gravy (I figured it would add a little more flavor to the sauce). Incredible recipe, it will be a regular at my house from now on. THANK YOU!!

Yucky.  This one went into the trash. Cutting the salt to 1 tsp didn't help.

I decided to try something different for dinner tonight.  I should have known it would be too salty with the amount of salt called for (and I followed it exact) but you live and learn.  I'm sure the meatballs themselves are great though.  Sorry.

Easy to make and delicious!  I however use Jessica's Swedish Meatball I's receipe for the sauce.  But for the meatball, Kari got the greatest receipe.  Taste just right (not too salty) and they are really juicy.

these meatballs were great! i'm not sure what others were saying about the sauce because it turned out really good. it tasted kinda bland on its own but went really well with the meatballs. i cut down on the cooking time by frying the meatballs with pam first and adding sauce and cooking in the over for the last 15 minutes.

We enjoyed these meatballs but weren't saying "Wow". I made a different sauce, and served them over egg noodles.  I'd try the meatballs one more time.

I wish I would have read the other reviews before diving into this recipe.  The meatballs were OK so the three stars is for that.    The sauce is terrible and I think it must be written wrong. It tasted like too thick salty flour.   I followed the directions with the exception of adding a tablespoon of salt. That seemed too much and I used 1 teaspoon. Still it was too salty.  Also I think it had too much pepper and paprika.  So, I dumped half of the sauce down the drain and began adding more liquid to tone down the thickness, salt and other seasonings. I added a splash of Worcester and a quarter teaspoon of beef bouillon.  It is now edible,  but I would not make it again.

Good.  I put to much pepper in the second time I made it but its good.  I also added bell peppers the second time I made it (Seeking in some veggies for those that need them).

If you reheat it put it and a couple table spoons of milk in a sauce pan and heat through. Add your egg noodles towards the end of heating.  It will taste better then the first day you had it!

Should have known better than to put that much salt in the sauce but did anyway. If you make this, DRASTICALLY reduce the salt, better yet, find a different recipe!

Just looking at the ingredients in the sauce left something to be desired, so I omitted some items and added some.  I only used 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, instead of water I used beef stock and added a quick sprinkle of onion powder over the top of sauce while boiling.  I poured the sauce over frozen meatballs (I work and thats just quick and easy)in my slow cooker then added sliced mushrooms.  It turned out pretty good, the original recipe seemed bland.

Not a good sauce. I made a large batch for an anniversary party and it stayed in the pot.  I followed the recipe to the letter except used less salt because of other reviews and it tasted like salty flour soup.  Will not make this one again, sorry.

this was easy to follow -easy to make and was gobbled up by my picky eater children. My seven yr old loved how there was so much sauce!( just the right amount for the noodles) and my four year old would not even slow down to talk at dinner.. she shoveled it in and asked for seconds.. the meatballs are just perfect!

1 tablespoon of salt is TOO SALTY!!  Try with 1/2 tsp first and then if more is needed it can always be seasoned at table.  Other than that, quick and excellent recipe.

I used turkey instead of beef/pork and everything went well except they needed less time in the oven. My only real concern here is the 'sauce', it has absolutely no flavor! I needed to add one can of Campbell's Mushroom cream soup as well as one can of Campbells Chicken cream soup for flavor/texture. Otherwise, a good recipe!

I'm not going to lie - the sauce wasn't that great.   I needed a sauce mix because I messed up my McCormic packet (accidentally cut it wrong and put everything in the meatball mixture- that I actually really do recommend by the way, lol).   Anyway, I used maybe a pinch of salt because there was no WAY I was going to put that much into it.. The flavor came close but it was missing something, and unfortunately I'm not sure what. The consistency, etc was all great, it was just very mild.   I'm going to try it again with some of the previous suggestions.

I agree with previous posters: the meatballs themselves were great, the sauce was a little bland. I replaced the parsley in the meatballs with fresh cilantro, and it provided a nice kick. I put about a tablespoon of instant coffee mix into the sauce with the paprika, salt, and pepper. Then, when adding the boiling water, I threw in two beef bouillon cubes. Used a full cup of sour cream instead of 3/4 of a cup, per the instructions. The drippings from the meatballs do the rest. Good cooking, everybody!

The sauce for these meatballs was awful, and came out something akin to salty flour water.  I would reccommend using beef broth or cream of mushroom soup instead of the flour and water combo.  You could definitely taste the flour.

This sauce was RIDICULOUSLY salty!!!  I had to throw the whole first batch out.  Thank goodness I was able to salvage the meatballs!
I cooked it the second time with only a teaspoon of salt and it was actually quite good!

This recipe is very underrated! I have to agree with many of the contributors that you need to go easy on the salt, but other than that it's great! I do not always have ground pork on hand and it's still great with only ground beef!

These were just what I was looking for! I could tell that 1 tbsp. would be too much salt in the sauce, so I reduced it to 1 tsp. and it came out great!

TOOO SALTY!  I was disgusted!  I do not understand why this recipe has four stars!  I have had so much luck on this website with great recipes, especially when they have four or five stars.  I could kick myself for not reading the reviews first!  I made this for dinner and none of us could stomach it!  Our dinner was ruined and we ended up eating pb&j's for dinner!  What a waste of my time!

It's favor was very odd.  I read the reviews before hand, cut back on the salt, added nutmeg, etc. and it didn't help.  I didn't add the sauce over them to bake because I did not like it.  Thinking I could salvage the meat balls, I made some strognaff hamburger helper and put the balls in with that, but even that did not work for me.

I should have read the reviews first.  This was BEYOND too salty.  I love salt, so if it was too salty for me, WOW.  The salt in the meatballs was probably too much as well.  Otherwise I guess it was ok.

I thought these meatballs were great.  The meatballs themselves could use a little less salt, maybe a quarter to a half less.  

I read the reviews beforehand so I wasn't too surprised with the spiciness of the sauce.  It was quite spicy and not very creamy.  I don't think this is bad, it just depends on your taste.  I might add Cream of Mushroom soup next time to reduce the spiciness and increase the creaminess.  I used 1 tsp of salt instead of the misprinted 1 tbsp.  I also added nutmeg to the sauce (the same amount as the other spices).  I also used margarine instead of the oil for the sauce.  It was pretty good, but I think it'd be better with the soup.

I tried to cook the meatballs in a loaf pan, but they didn't brown very well that way.  I used a cookie sheet for ones that wouldn't fit in the loaf pan and they browned very nicely.

I used 3/4 pound of ground beef and it yielded 13 meatballs.

Way, way, WAY too salty, as noted elsewhere, to the point of being inedible.  We dumped the whole batch.  I can only imagine that the people who rate this highly are cutting the salt by perhaps 75%.

I used all pork for the meatballs and in addition to the regular recipe for the sauce I added 1 can undiluted mushroom soup just so that I had lots of sauce to cover the meatballs in my casserole dish ( I browned the meatballs in my teflon frying pan first  then transferred them to simmer in a casserole on a very low oven for a couple of hours). Nice savoury flavour without being spicy that should appeal to a lot of adults and kids, will make again for sure.

Wanna make it fluffier? Use only 1/2 lb of beef! Wanna make it faster? Coat the bottom of a covered skillet or sauteuse (if you want more sauce) with the oil. Sear the meatballs, cooking and lightly browning the outside. Remove the meatballs and then add the flour, whisking continuously (like making white sauce). Then add the water to which you have added the paprika and the salt & pepper to taste. Mix well. Return the meatballs to the pan and cover. Simmer until done. Yummy!

I was looking for a fast meatball recipe and this recipe did not disappoint! They were flavourful and kept their moisture and I served them with pasta. On reading reviews regarding the salt content of the sauce - even though I didn't make it myself - I always air on the side of conservatism. Aside from baking (cakes breads etc) I always start with zero salt and add to taste from there. There is always sodium in added ingredients so I like to get a base before adding more. A tbsp of salt would have sent my alarms up immediately. LOL! Otherwise a great recipe and I will definitely file this in keepers.

This revue is for sauce only.  I used rice flour because of the gluten.  The paprika changed the color to an unappetizing orange color my kids were alarmed.  Next time I will use white pepper.

I thought they were great.  I left out the sour cream since I added a Can of Cream of Mushroom Soup and Beef Broth as some other folks that reviewed the recipe did.  I added some fresh garlic to the meatballs. I followed the advice of someone else who rated the recipe by cooking my meatballs halfway and finishing them in the sauce which adds a little extra oil that you can skim because it rises to the top.  I also added fresh mushrooms to the sauce and served over rice.  Next time, I am going to try to use fresh parsley, the dried was a tad overwhelming for me because I don't normally use it. My family liked it and it's a new recipe we have added.

I am so disappointed in the sauce! I wish I had read the reviews instead of just looking at the star rating. It tastes like flour, isn't creamy and is the wrong color even! I made a lot expecting to make several dinners from it.

I just made this and it turned out great. I read some of the reviews and made a few mods to the sauce. Used beef broth, and a can of cream of mushroom soup, also used smoked paprika instead of regular. So yummy. It's not very healthy, but I would make it again.

It was good--but thankfully I read all the reviews before proceeding. The meatballs came out great but I decided against pouring the sauce over them and cooking another 20 minutes. Instead I just kept the meatballs in the oven until done; for my oven it was about 35 min. 

SAUCE was way too salty with 1 tablespoon. I changed the recipe by using one can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 cup of boiling water. Because it was still too salty I ended up adding another 1/2 cup of water... the 3/4 cup of sour cream was too much as well... the sauce tasted like salty and hot sour cream. I gradually added more water. (The sour cream makes it super thick -- not to my liking) I added another 1/2 cup of water after the sour cream... and chopped a couple handfuls of fresh parsley--no stems--and it really livened it up.
It went from bleh to wonderful!!!!! My husband was begging for the recipe.
Next time I will skip the salt altogether until the very end and only use the sour cream sparingly, maybe 1/4 cup.

I didn't use the sauce, but the consistency of the meatball is great. I agree with the other reviewers that there is too much salt.  I will make them again, but omit the salt as the Worcester is plenty enough salty.

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I did not care for this at all. I'd give it just one star, but out of fairness, it could be just personal taste, or a mistake in prep.

The meatballs are great as written. The sauce was great after the following changes:

1. Use butter instead of oil. 
2. Cut out salt completely or only use a small amount, definitely not a whole tablespoon!
3. Use broth instead of water. 
4. You MUST add the sauce to the meatball pan and bake/stir. This ensures that the meat drippings mix into the sauce. 

We will be making it again. My husband said they were better than Ikea's.

I made these last night for the first time and they were awesome! After reading many of the reviews, i opted to NOT make the sauce from this recipe. My sauce was 1 can cream mushroom soup w/garlic, 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can evaporated milk. After bringing to a boil i added this sauce to the meatballs for 20 min. The only altering i made to the recipe was a little less salt and i added 2 tablespoons of garlic powder. They were delicious!

I made a bigmistake while preparing the gravy:  I picked up my nutmeg instead of my paprika.  The sauce was still good, but I think it would have been great with the paprika!  Loved the meatballs!  Thanks for the recipe!

I had a craving for a dish my mom made when I was young, meatballs with gravy and rice. I liked the meatball recipe but wanted brown gravy so skipped the sauce part of the recipe. I also used a whole onion (what can I say, I love onions!) and Italian bread crumbs. The meatballs were fabulous! I used a brown gravy packet and substituted half the water with the pan drippings and onions that fell off. Delicious! Everyone loved them and it was my first time making meatballs. :)

Great meatballs.  Didn't use any salt at all-  used salt substitute. The sauce recipe looked wierd, and I didn't have any sour cream,  so I just made a roux with flour from the oven pan drippings,  and added some chicken stock.  Kids loved them.

This is my favourite recipe for swedish meatballs - I use less salt in the sauce but other than that they are perfect, and so easy!  I sometimes use seasones pork sausages squeezed out of the wrappers because the generic ground pork from the grocery store always tastes too bland to me (in general, not in this recipe).

I loved the sauce. It is very simple to make and it tastes good. I went to Ikea and had their famous swedish meatballs, and I have to say I liked this sauce a lot more than theirs. I usually add a little bit of corn starch to make it a thicker gravy type sauce.

After following all the ingredients for these "amazing" swedish meatballs, i came to the conclusion that it was way to bland for me.. My whole family felt the same way. The presentation of the meatballs looked awesome but there was no flavor to it. Sorry!

Way too much salt in the sauce, should have probably been 1 tsp instead of 1 tablespoon.  Meatballs themselves are great though.

Make a sauce like at IKEA - Brown gravy with heavy cream and a little soy sauce.  Kids love these!

My family really liked these - I'm sure I'll be making them again soon.  However, even with 1 tsp. salt in the sauce instead of 1 Tbsp., it was still slightly too salty, so I will add even less next time.  The only change I made was I added a couple of teaspoons of beef bouillon powder to the boiling water.  Thanks, Kari!

Excellent!  We'll probably have once a WEEK!  I did add a can of mushroom soup to the sour cream, because I was making more meatballs.  Good thing I made more too.... They were all gone.

I'm sorry to say that these weren't very good.  The sauce was very strange.  I took the advice of others and reduced the salt to 1 tsp and added 1 tsp nutmeg (as real sweedish meatballs use nutmeg).  Also, I cooked the rue (used butter instead of oil) for a bit so the sauce was nice and thick.  The consistency was great but the taste was a bit off.  I'm not sure if i'll make these again.

i took everyone's advice and cut down the salt, i thought the meatballs were pretty good, but while i was cooking the sauce (and taste testing)  i knew i had to doctor it up a bit so i added onion powder, and a few extras  . . . .  came out good.

I also don't like to give poor ratings, but there was nothing at all about this recipe that we liked. It was totally tasteless, and I followed all the instructions. This one just wasn't for us and I'd recommend try something else, sorry.

The meatball recipe is great, the sauce part not so great.  It does not taste anything like traditional swedish maetball sauce, it is very bland.  Maybe look for another recipe for the sauce.

The meatballs were terrific!  I used a LOT less salt than the recipe called for, but it still didn't help the sauce.  We didn't care for it at all.

After cutting the salt and pepper in half, the meatballs were very good...even after cutting the salt way down on the sauce, I really didn't like it.  I served the meatballs with homemade beef gravy, over rice.  That was good.

I'm not in love with meat balls, but my husband loved them. I don't know what everyone says about them being too salty. Mine weren't, but I didn't make the sauce. We ate them with spagetti.

Definitely cut that salt down!! Or serve with bland noodles or rice. Other than that, very very yummy. Just make sure to rotate them frequently. Mine were a bit under-cooked.

I cut the salt and pepper in half, and it was still pretty salty/spicy.  Seems like a good recipe with some typos perhaps.  Also, maybe the author should suggest plain breadcrumbs?  I used flavored which probably contribute to the too spicy taste.

The meatballs themselves were good, but the sauce was way, way too salty. I really should have read the reviews beforehand. I also didn't like these over egg noodles, but I think that was the fault of the specific noodles I bought, and not of this recipe. Next time, I would eat the meatballs with rice. The only think I changed about the recipe was using all beef and no pork.

We loved this!  I also add a dash of nutmeg to the sauce and cut down the salt.  I use fat free sour cream to cut down on the fat content and actually have also used reduced fat cream cheese for part of the sour cream.  Delicious!  I also add diced mushrooms to everything.  YUM!

Great for a potluck, easily finishes off in the crock pot!

The meatballs were definitely fantastic, but this sauce needs help!  First, Swedish Meatball sauce needs nutmeg.  Second, 1 TBSP of salt is WAY too much -- that's got to be a misprint.  I could barely finish my bowl of these.  Third, there's too much sauce for the meatballs, and it really doesn't cook well in the oven -- it dries out on top.  I would recommend adding the meatballs to the sauce in a stockpot.  I also substituted butter for the vegetable oil -- vegetable oil does not make a good roux.

For those who said the sauce tasted too much of flour, you didn't cook the roux long enough, and the recipe isn't very clear on that, either.  You should cook the flour and oil for a couple of minutes, at least, or it will still taste like flour.

These were good- my first attempt at swedish meatballs, however they were way too salty.  Maybe to Tbsp in the sauce was supposed to be a tsp?  With this modification I will make again and I am sure it will be a five star meal.  I substituted 1.5 lbs. of lean ground turkey to cut down on the fat and served them over caraway noodles. (1 Tbsp of toasted caraway seeds, 2 tsp parsley melted with 3 Tbsp butter tossed with 1/2 a bag of no yolks egg noodles- delish)

meatballs were fine, but not very "Swedish", the sauce way too salty and spicy. I will make it again using a lot less sauce and add the pepper afterwards!

Very tasty! I used a lot of garlic as we are crazy about garlic! My only concern was that the meat balls oozed a nasty-looking goo during the baking process. Maybe it was fat from the ground pork? It didn't ruin the recipe but it did look a little unappetizing... I scraped it off before simmering the meat balls with my marinara sauce. Great recipe! Thanks!

I made the meatballs exactly the same and they came out perfect, but for the sauce which is way simpler and probably way better, I used a can of cream of mushroom soup, 3/4 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup of milk, and the drippings from the meatballs for the flavor and my family loved them. The only thing I would do different next time is make more sauce.

Yummy! I made these once already and making them again tonight.  I only use ground beef, for personal prefrence (sorry), but they still came out delish!  Served over rice, with fresh steamed carrots (buttered) as veg.  I wish I had peas, but I make them almost everyday, so we were out, lol.  This is a keeper recipe.  As to the people complaining about the salt content...You know your family, and cooking style.  Reduce the salt..I actually generally omit it, because most people reach for the salt shaker before even tasting.  I didnt put salt in at all, but sprinkled a light shake on after tasting.  It was perfect.

I'm sorry to say this but, the sauce wasn't good in my opinion I added a can of cream of chicken soup and a can of mushroom soup a little red pepper and a cup of sour cream. Much tastier. The other way was very bland. The meatballs were pretty good though I will make them again but only for this

Way too much salt in both the meatballs and sauce. I cut the salt in half in meatballs and they tasted pretty good. I used only 1  1/2 teaspoon salt in sauce and it was still too salty. This would be a really good recipe with the salt adjusted.

both meatballs and sauce were pretty bland.  i had to add worstecire and beef bouillon as  a last minute flavor save because this literally tasted like nothing--creamy nothing, but tasteless nonetheless. ditto meatballs, which you can't test while making because raw meat.  add more salt and more worstecire to both to give them SOME flavor.  both cooked up easily and according to recip.

I did not make any substitutions on this recipe and I so wish I had on the amount of salt used in the sauce and the oil in the sauce. Should have used butter instead of oil and cut the salt in half. It was awful

I made this dish today for the local Senior's Center.  I made some changes as I made the dish with ground turkey.  The only changes I made were to the sauce, I adding some garlic powder, dried parsley & a little allspice as well as using beef broth instead of only water.  I served it over egg noodles & with peas. I can say that they were very happy with their meal.  Thanks for sharing your recipe & I will be sure to make it again. Maybe with beef next time.  :)

This was delicious with a few substitutions. The amount of salt called for would have made this inedible.  I used 3/4 teaspoon for the meat and 1 teaspoon for the sauce.

After adding the amount of sour cream in the recipe, wow...needs to be cut way back. I added some beef base powder, garlic and onion powder, Worcestershire sauce, and liquid smoke. Had a much more flavorful sauce.

I give the meatballs 5 stars. They were absolutely amazing. The only thing I did different with them was I used roasted garlic bread crumbs and I didn't put in as much salt. I love garlic and it is almost in everything. They turned out perfect.

 Sadly the sauce was very bland unless you added the salt. 

I will make the meatballs again. They'd be great with a different sauce or even in spaghetti. I recommend the meat but not the sauce.

I am a sixteen year old girl using my mom's account.
  I've loved Swedish meatballs ever since I ate some at the wedding of a church member that I attended many years ago, and ever since, I've been trying to find a recipe that matched. Finding I didn't have cream or beef broth, I was looking for a recipe that didn't call for them, and I found this one.  And after adjusting the recipe for one, I made it.
   The meatballs were pretty good, but the sauce was salty. Too salty. I added  more sour cream to cut the salt, but no go. My mom suggested adding some more worcestershire sauce. It helped and I recommend using it to fix this recipe if you find it too salty.   I should have read the reviews first, if I had, I wouldn't have made this one. As it is, I won't make this recipe again.  I'll have remember to ask my church friend for her recipe, continue to use my own make-by-eye version, or find another one to try.
    P.S. After months of searching I found Chef John's to be the best!  I suggest trying them!

The tablespoon of salt the recipe calls for is way too much. I would recommend reducing to 1 teaspoon. Other than tat, easy to make and tastes good.

The meatballs were perfect texture and flavor. The sauce came out WAY too salty so when I make this again I will definitely use less than a tablespoon of salt in the sauce. Otherwise, these meatballs were fabulous over egg noodles.

Meatballs were super salty and I only used half of the salt that was called for! I cut the salt out of the sauce entirely and added a cup of beef broth instead of water as I feared it would be very bland (but salty). The roux needs to be browned before adding the broth and sour cream, not just sizzling. More like a stroganoff recipe really.

This is my FAVORITE recipe! The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the changes I had to make. The sauce was tasteless until I made some change. Instead of vegetable oil, I used butter. Also, I use boiling beef or chicken broth instead of water.

Too Salty! I made the Swedish Meatball recipe last night. The meatballs were very tasty but the sauce was another story. It was very salty and 1T of salt should have been a red flag. I would make the meatballs again but not the sauce.

I hate leaving a bad review, but we didn't like this at all. As a matter of fact, we wound up throwing it out and eating sandwiches. 

I followed the recipe to the "T"... not sure what happened.

Was in a hurry and needed a quick appetizer.  Used frozen meatballs.  For the sauce-I just used 1 teaspoon of salt-per suggestion of other reviews and when it was time time to add the sour cream I only had 1/4 cup so for the other 1/2 cup I used french onion dip-it actually gave it a nice flavor.  It worked well for a quick appetizer. Next time I'll try the whole recipe.

I made this recipe but changed the serving to 16 for a potluck event, and it was delicious. Everyone loved them and came back for seconds. :) I would recommend making the meatballs a bit larger instead of small, as they shrink up and look kind of pathetic unless you start them off big. You probably already know this if you're used to cooking but I'm not -- I don't cook a lot and I found this recipe very easy to follow, and it turned out well, so kudos. :)

I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and about half a tsp of garlic powder to the sauce.  It was still a bit too salty for us.  Great flavor though.  This is a keeper.

The meatballs were excellent.  However, the sauce was so salty it was barely edible.  Perhaps there was an error calling for 1 tablespoon of salt and it should have been 1 teaspoon.  Next time I would start with no salt and add if it needed any.

Very good- except it calls for WAY too much salt. The next time I make these I will not use any salt...but otherwise very tasty and very good as leftovers!

I needed to doctor up the sauce by adding mushrooms and cream of mushroom soup. Garlic and more sourcream. Too much vegie oil and not enough stock.

The meatballs were great!  However the sauce needs help.  I will definitely make the meatballs again but I will take the other suggestions and re-work the sauce.

I really liked the meatballs. The only thing I did not like about this was the sauce.  It tasted too much like flour.  It needs something else.  But over all it was good.

I did not use pork and did not miss it.  I took someone's advice and skipped the sauce instructions and made a simple sauce of sour cream, mushroom soup, and meatball drippings.  I also used dried minced onions instead of a fresh onion.

The meatballs are great but the sauce leaves something to be desired.  There is not enough sauce - next time I will use more sour cream and probably cream of mushroom to "beef up" the sauce.

The meat balls were pretty good, but will add more seasonings such as garlic powder, onion powder, and Cavender's Greek seasoning.  We did not like the sauce, however, I will try again and use French Onion soup instead of the water.

Would've like this recipe a lot better without the pork, but then I'm not a huge fan of pork anyway. May try them again with all beef. My two-year-old loved them, though!

The meatballs were great, but the sauce wasn't. My Swedish family found it more like a hot sauce than the expected creamy sauce. Somewhere between the 1 tsp pepper and the 1 tsp of paprika this got way too spicey! No kidding, I washed off the meat balls the next day and tried them with a brown gravey and it was much better.

The meatballs were very moist and tasty - the only improvement for me (my husband thought they were the greatest and talked about them for hours) I felt the sour cream taste was a bit overwhelming in the sauce- I will make these again, but will try some beef stock to give a fuller flavor.
