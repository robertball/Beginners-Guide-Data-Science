This is an awesome drink!  I have it when I go out and boy do they go down smooth!!  Nice thing about them is that after you stop drinking them for about 15-20 minutes you start to feel normal again.  Nice and fruity for the lightweight drinker.

AWESOME!! My new favorite drink.  Only thing I did different was serve in larger glasses so I added equal amounts of pineapple and cranberry.  Delicious!

This is my signature drink...very smooth & sweet.  Has a light, coconut flavor.  Easy to drink too much of, because it's just like drinking juice!  Definitely a great, simple drink recipe.  Fun for showers & summer parties.

I've been making this for years (it was my signature drink for my 21'st GET SMASHED party).  The one difference is that I do 4 oz of BOTH pineapple and cranberry juice.  Yum...always gets RAVE reviews at my parties!

I do half & half because I love cranberry juice. This is fabulous, like Christmas and the beach all rolled into one. (Which probably says something interesting about my memories of Christmas.) Thanks for the recipe, it's great!

I personally didn't think much of this drink. I was quite excited to try it but it fell flat for me. To make it more platable, I added a little spiced rum and more cranberry juice. I just found it sort of ho-hum.

This was fabulous.  We served it at a party and went through 3 bottles of rum.  Everyone raved about how great it was!  We will serve these again.

Good drink! My wife is VERY picky when it comes to drinks, and when I made this she loved it! Heck, she even called her mom to tell her about it and had the neighbor take a taste. I thought it was good, but not wowed by it. Then again, I'm just the husband..... :)

Delicious. The name says Malibu Bay but the flavors are more like Hawaii! I've instantly been transported to a luau at Napili Bay. Mahalo!

Also, I floated the cranberry juice on top for a prettier presentation.

One of my favorite drinks EVER! I like to enjoy this one when it's going to be a long night out and I don't want to hit up the vodka too early! I probably use 2 T. of cranberry juice to each 1/4 cup of pineapple, but why measure? It's great either way!

I love Malibu Bay Breezes and have been looking for a good recipe.  This one is the best!  Made a gallon of it and took to a party.  Almost all the ladies there switched to drinking it and kept talking about how good it was.

This is my hands down favorite drink! Never seems to fail me. Tropical, fruity, fun, and sooo smooth! I can't even tell that it has rum in it! Absolutely love!!

Tip: Try putting some coconut shavings on the rim of the cup!

Pretty simple recipe that really packs a punch! The taste was excellent but after sipping it for a bit, I started to feel lightheaded! It has quite a bit more rum in it than I would normally put in a drink. Next time, I'd make it with less rum or more juice.

This was way too sweet.  I liked the ingredients that were involved, but there was too much pineapple juice and not enough alcohol.

This cocktail is a favorite for summer time BBQs.  Simple with just three ingredients and awesome flavor.  I prefer to serve mine shaken it makes a nice froth and cools the drink more.

So good! This is the perfect summer drink! I'll probably whip up a couple of pitchers for my next party and share them.
