Oh my goodness these are good! I was immediately intrigued when I saw honey vanilla in the name and knew I had to try these! The vanilla extract really brings the potatoes to a whole other level of delicious! I was a little worried 2 tbsp of cinnamon would be too much, so I ended up using just over 1 tbsp, and in retrospect, 2 would have been fine. I love that these are grilled (although they could easily be made in the oven) and are the perfect pairing for grilled salmon or pork. A great way to prepare sweet potatoes in the summer months!

This recipe was amazing.  These are by far the best sweet potatoes I have made.  In preparing the dish, it seemed that the cinnamon might be a bit too heavy.  I prepared as called for and it was fine.  I love the way the potatoes carmelized.

This could become a Thanksgiving tradition.  Someone who does not normally like sweet potatoes may like this.  Not too sweet and easy to eat. I used a mandoline to slice the sweet potatoes and they came out great.  Will make it again soon.

Love the way the potatoes caramelized.  Could easily overeat these, they are that good.  I think I may add some onions next time for a bit of 'savory-ness' to the taste.  Delicious as is tho!

1/2 of us really like it, 1/2 didn't.
