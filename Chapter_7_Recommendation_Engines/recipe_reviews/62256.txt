Update: Posted photo I topped with melted mozzerella and sauteed mushrooms and a big slab of tomato. So yummy! Original review: This were good, and great with a big slab of tomato and lots of mayo. However, I like my husband's spice mixture that he puts on his burgers a tiny bit better...thanks for letting me try something different!

These grilled burgers were excellent. I sub'd 2t garlic powder for the garlic salt and chopped some white onion into the meat. Yummy recipe, AlissaB24!

These were very juicy.  Usually when I make burgers they come out dry, but not these.  I did not have any dried basil but I did have fresh so I used that instead.  Everything else I kept the same.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!:)

I used this recipe, but stuffed the burgers with mozzerella cheese.  Yummy!  And the kids loved them too.

I rate this burger four stars instead of five simply because I have to leave room in my ratings for that recipe that brings about shouts of rapture with periods of dizziness.  That said, these were excellent burgers.  I followed the recipe exactly other than I had a little less beef on hand than it called for.  Very juicy and very tasty... and very easy to make.  Added melted pepper jack cheese on top and served them in the traditional way.

If you like basil as I do, this is an excellent grilled burger.  I did however reduce the amount of basil to one tablespoon.  A friend of mine, opal~/~dragonfly from Our Table Talk dot com in her review and picture suggested topping it with sauteed mushrooms,melted Mozzarella and tomato. Since you have to top your burger with something, I followed her suggestion and it was delicious!

We enjoyed these and they are really easy.  Play with the amount of basil to get what you want.  The basil seems to dry it just a bit.  These will be a staple here.

Absolutely wonderful! Everyone at the cookout said they were the best burgers they EVER had. One person who raved about them is a Johnson and Wales graduate. We followed the recipe exactly but we added 1/4 t onion salt and fresh basil from our garden.

Absolutely delightful! These were some of the juiciest burgers we've had in a long time. The only changes I made were...I added 1 egg to "bind" the meat, as well as about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of bread crumbs. The mixture was still quite moist and "fally-aparty", but we managed to keep them together. We served these with thin slices of tomato, broiled pineapple and onion.

Delicious herb burger recipe! yum, yum! Perfect flavor - not too much nor too little. marinated in fridge 50+ minutes before cooking on stove top. Will use again, and again! Thanks !Taste much better than our usual egg+Italian bread crumbs burgers.

We loved these burgers!  I had some Worcestershire sauce left over that we needed to use up and this fit the bill.  We had to squeeze out the sauce before we cooked them or they would have fallen apart, but they went really well and the basil is a nice flavor

Excellent burgers! Very moist, will definitely make again.

A few changes due to what we had in the house. I cut back a bit on the Worcestershire sauce since we only had a 1lb pack of hamb. defrosted. Instead of the full 3T I used 2T + 2 splashes, I also used 1 clove of fresh garlic instead of the garlic salt (not going to hurt anyone to cut back on salt) and 1 cube* of fresh basil. One more thing. We took another reviewers advice and added saute√©d mushrooms and sliced tomatoes to the burger. Topped it all off with Muenster and Provolone cheeses.

*We chop fresh basil, portion it out into an ice cube tray, add a bit of water and freeze it.

Good burger!..  We served them on ciabatta rolls..  I didn't add quite enough salt but that was probably since I used nearly two lbs of meat and forgot to allow for the difference; followed the recipe and added dry grated parmesan cheese, a bit of fresh basil and a little milk to help moisten and hold it all together.  Grilled in olive oil for a Greek flavor!.   :)

I used about 1 3/4 pounds meat and added an egg and 1/8 cup unseasoned bread crumbs.  I also used proportionately more worcestershire sauce and less dried basil because I used fresh basil as a topping.  With a lettuce leaf and mayo it made a great burger!  This is a keeper recipe...

I think these are great. Not dry or burnt at all. Just put less basil if you are afraid of it being too strong. I like flavor so this is a recipe I will make again.

Great burger. The worcestershire was the first taste I noticed, but then the basil came through. Nice blend of flavor, I enjoyed. I'll make this again. I made this stovetop, but I'm sure over the charcoal would be so much better. Thanks!

hubby says they were pretty good. they sure smell good when mixing the seasoning & cooking. they did turn out good, maybe a lil less basil cause to me it gave it a slight sausage taste and i do hate sausage. however, we'll probably be making these again. they were fast & easy to make.

Made these for dinner tonight- they are very good. My husband suggested to leave the garlic salt out next time, and we thought they were a bit dry- but I also think they were a bit overcooked, so that part was our fault. The rest though, very good! I'd make these again :)

Decent burger.  It's freezing here, so we tried to make it on the stove and failed, but I can definitely see where it'd be delicious.  Almost too much basil, though.

Great, easy recipe.  The kids gobbled it up.  I used about 1/4 cup fresh, chopped basil and topped with shredded mozzarella at the grill.  I also mixed up some pesto mayo per someone's suggestion which I made with approximately 5 parts mayo to 1-2 parts pesto (from a jar) and a smidge of dijon.  Delish.

A great twist on regular boring burgers.  I followed some other user suggestions: 1) I used about 1/4 cup of fresh basil instead of dried, 2) I added in about 1/3 cup or so of minced onion, and 3) I topped them with tomato, then mozzarella on top and let it melt for a minute or so.  I also served it on the side with pasta mixed with sauteed spinach.  Very delicious, and I'll certainly try this again!

I doubled this recipe, make sure your people like basil.  My people do! We went with the suggested mozzarella and tomato slice and most liked it.  I thought they were a little dry but not horrible dry. Next time I will try with mozzarella and a italian sauce or paste as a topper (not a fan of tomatos). Good burger, tasty change.

This was juicy and flavorful. However, I'd recommend Chris' Bay Area Burger - also on this site and similar in taste - over this one.

We didn't like this very much.  We make burgers often and do not overcook, but the basil tasted like it was burned.

I think these are really good. Either put onions in the meat or on the burger and they are excellent!!! Keeper here

I had tons of extra dried basil that I needed to use, so I looked specifically for a basil recipe and found this one. This was a delicious recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe called and used the full amount of basil. I found the amount of basil to be perfect and wouldn't reduce it a bit. The basil, garlic, and Worcestershire sauce combine to make a great flavor. I'm not a burger expert, but this tasted like a gourmet burger to me!

This were a crowd pleaser at a Labor Day get together that we had at our house.  I chose to use a nice thick slice of fresh mozzarella cheese on my burgers.  They were also easy to make ahead of time and have ready for the grill.

I made quite a few changes to this recipe: first off, I used vegetarian ground crumbles instead of beef. I dumped in a fair amount of dried basil, hot sauce, some garlic powder, and black pepper. I omitted the Worcestershire. I cooked it in a skillet rather than on the grill, and topped my burger with a slice of mozzarella, caramelized onions, and a leaf of romaine lettuce. I served it all on an everything bagel slathered with spicy mayonnaise (mayo + desired amount of tabasco). it was mighty delicious, and very satisfying. thanks so much for this recipe, it was a great jumping-off point for me!

Great recipe, but I always recommend fresh spices. I also added some sundried tomatoes, an egg and breadcrumbs, and mixed about half a cup of mayo with about a tbsp and a half of pesto for the spread. Top that with some swiss cheese and purple onion... and YUMMO!

Good flavor.  Instead of garlic salt, used a garlic seasoning mix.  We ate with mozzarella cheese on top.

These were horrible. It was almost like eating unseasoned burgers. I'm used to fresh basil and used the dried basil as directed, and dried basil just doesn't do much. I ended up breaking up the meat and reseasoning it to use in chili. Would not make this again.

Loved this recipe.  Instead of dried basil, i added basil leaves on top of the burger instead of a lettuce.  It was very unique, and easy will serve again.

I really enjoyed the change in taste for this hamburger. The kids did not care for it as much, so if you're serving to kids, I would play with the amount of basil in the recipe. I also would suggest seving with onions. I absoulutely will use this recipe again.

I went looking for a recipe to use some of the fresh basil I had on hand.  I came across this recipe using dried basil and opted to switch fresh for dried.  The end results was a very good grilled hamburger.  I mixed the burgers up in the morning to meld the flavors and then made patties up in the evening to grill for supper.  Paired the burgers with 'Bacon and Eggs Potato Salad' from AR for a very enjoyable meal.

These were great.  My hubby and kids loved them also.  The only change I made was, I use minced garlic instead of garlic salt.  I do not much care for salt.  Will definitely make these again.

This burgers were pretty tasty.  It is nice to make a different kind of burger.  The basil seasoning gave it a nice kick.
