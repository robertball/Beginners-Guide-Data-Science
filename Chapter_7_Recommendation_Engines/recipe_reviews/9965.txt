I like this recipe b/c it was not only quite tasty but it was extremely easy! I used almond extract instead of vanilla and I used and about 1/2 the pecans it called for and the other half were almonds (in which I toasted both before crushing them.) I crushed them to a sandy texture for better flavor. Through trial and error, I discovered that the balls should be about the width of a nickel, no bigger than a quarter, for them to bake for 10 min. I tried larger ones, baked them longer, but I couldn't get them to bake evenly. Be sure that they are completely cool before rolling them in the sugar!

This is the exact same recipe my friend has in his cookbook at home (which we have made many times together around the holidays to give out to friends). 

One tip, the finer you ground the nuts the better it tastes! I've had them with chunky nuts and with finely ground nuts, and I have to say the finely ground nuts are the way to go. 

Also, since these cookies easily come together in a ball shape, we've put toffee, butterscotch, and sometimes chocolate in the middle. All you need to do is take three or four chips (of whatever you prefer), flatten out the cookie in your hand, place the chips in the middle, and fold the dough over into a ball shape and bake. This makes it extra tastey and special!

Ive been making these cookies for the longest time and always get raves. I reckon, 100g of walnuts is more than sufficient- too much nuts will result in the cookie breaking up more easily. Use lightly salted butter n omit the confectionary sugar in the batter. The mildly salted cookie and confectionary sugar coating is a perfect marriage of flavours! The trick to making these cookies melt in ur mouth is to avoid overbeating it and handling it as little as possible. After beating the butter (make sure it's not too soft, rather, slightly firm) with vanilla, add in the flour n beat till just blended/mixture forms a lump. Very easy and addictive!

This is exactly what I was looking for. Thanks! Keep in mind that there is no salt in this recipe, so if you use unsalted butter (which I usually do) you'll need to add a couple pinches. I made the dough about a week ahead of time (refrigerated) and they came out perfect.

Very good. I made for a big family party and they were a big hit. Very easy. I doubled with no problems.  I used salted butter which gave a nice flavor, since the recipe called for no salt, although I would usually use unsalted for cookies.

I've been searching so long for this perfect recipe, and finally I've found it here. These are sometimes called Russian Tea Cakes or Swedish Tea Cakes. I followed the recipe but added 1 tsp. almond extract and these cookies came out moist, delicious, and so good that I must make more! I used my pampered chef scooper to make the balls, but I made them a bit too big so I had to cook them a bit longer. Next time I'll scale down a bit. These are absolutely WONDERFUL!

This recipe needed some modificaion to make it just right.  The vanilla needed to be doubled, the nuts needed to be very finely chopped and cut back to back to 1.5 cups, and 1/4 teaspoon salt added. I also roll the cookies in melted butter before rolling them in powdered sugar.

Really great! Remember that if your using unsalted butter, be sure to add a pinch of salt to this recipe (because it doesn't call for any) or I suppose you could just use salted sweet-cream butter

These was so good and very easy to make.. I saved it in my recipe box, I'll be making again for sure.. I did notice even after 15 mins of baking at 350, my cookies still wasn't done in the middle.. Maybe my balls was to big, next time I'll just flatten the cookies then bake...
A MUST TRY COOKIE RECIPE!! YUMMY!!

These are so easy to prepare and came out awesome!  I used half vanilla and half almond extract, toasted pecans and I also added a 1/4 tsp of salt because my butter was unsalted.  I handled the dough very gently and it made a few dozen nickel sized balls.  Cooked for about 11 min and let them sit to cool for about two min.  Then dusted them with powdered sugar.  Gave them a second dusting when they were cooled.  Took these to a new years eve party and got raves!  People were telling me I should sell them!  Thanks Julie for the great recipe!

I added the following changes after making the recipe as written the first time. The original way was good but I wanted to modify a bit so I used 1 full tsp vanilla as I love the flavor.  Then I used pecans instead of walnuts as I'm surrounded by pecan trees. Next time I will add a "little"bourbon or rum flavoring or liquor along with the vanilla. This will jazz it up for the holidays too.  You cannot really mess up this recipes as its super simple.  Make as written or experiment to your liking. To ensure you get even coating that adheres, roll the balls while warm from the oven in the powered sugar then place the coated balls in the fridge for 30 minutes to an hour to cool. Then repeat rolling in powered sugar. Lastly, make sure you take a couple for yourself as they will disappear before you know it! Thanks for sharing Julie =)

I put these on mini paper cup liners  as suggested and i ended up with about 70 balls. I grinded the nuts, not too fine, but next time i will probably just use chopped nuts to make them more crunchy. They do have that "melt in your mouth" effect. One thing, rolling them in confectioner's sugar make them look kind of sloppy, they look better (in my opinion) if you just sift the sugar on top of them, be generous with the sugar, they aren't too sweet. Everybody at the dinner party loved them.

one of my favorite cookies to make. my coworkers are constantly asking about these. i make these during the holidays and give them out in little tins as gifts. i also roll them into smaller balls about 3/4 of an inch and its bite size. for a little extra indulgence.. i roll them in powdered sugar twice. once about 5 mins after taking them out of the oven, then right when they are completely cool for a little more sweetness. i totally recommend this yummy cookie :)

Really disappointed in this. A Mexican neighbor gave us Mexican wedding cakes but this recipe didn't even come close to how flakey her cakes were. Also, I think this needs more vanilla extract, I don't even taste it.

These are great and super easy. I suggest chopping the walnuts finely. Remember not to put the powdered sugar on until they are cool, because the sugar will melt. Also, they look great in mini cupcake liners.

Love them!  I give these out for Christmas every year.  I under bake them slightly (8 minutes?) to give them a soft chewy texture. Soooo good! easy to over-indulge!

Easy recipe, quite delicious. Especially liked by the older ladies in my family who appreciate nuts, butter, less sugar. Quite a dense and rich cookie, perfect for tea time.

What a very easy and delicious recipe for Mexican Wedding cakes. I will make these again and again. I used a tiny strainer to sift the confectioner's sugar on to them, once while they were warm, and again when completely cooled,it was much easier than rolling them in the sugar.

These were easy to make & delicious.  I have never made them before but they are my husband's favorite so I thought I'd try.  I did alter 2 things - I added 1t of vanilla as one reviewer suggested & I only added 5T of powdered sugar. The dough was crumbly and I was worried that I messed something up but they held together and baked up great. We rolled them in powdered sugar after they were completely cooled.

VERY easy to make - and very fast also!
These are super tasty!  I've used this recipe several times now but this last time I took chocolate chips and put a couple in each ball (rolled the chocolate chips inside/the middle of the cookie before I baked it).  Yummy!

These cookies are easy to make with ingredients usually on hand. I only had 1 cup of nuts, and they turned out just right- melt in your mouth buttery and just the right texture.

These were quick and came our perfect.  I'm not sure why they are called "cakes"...aren't these cookies?? I didn't have the walnuts so I used almonds which were not as fresh as I thought.  They actually tasted old.  Next time I'm sticking with walnuts or pecans.  Either way, I'll be making them again.  Thanks Julie

I made these for the first time a few days ago.  I have never liked these cookies because they were always dry.  This recipe is awesome.  The only change I made was pecans instead of almonds.  I followed one reviewer's advice and made a conscious effort not to over work the dough.  Mine were tiny, not much larger than marbles.  A great size to "pop" into your mouth.  Everyone loved these.  Thanks, Julie!!

I have always liked these, but had never tried making them.  Other than not having nuts, I followed the recipe exactly. (I've never had these with nuts in them, and the kids won't eat nuts, anyway.) The dough is so sticky and messy that I can't fathom being able to roll it into balls. I read through a lot of reviews but couldn't figure out what I'm doing wrong, since it seemed so simple. Even after sitting in the freezer, the dough kept it's sticky texture. Disappointed. They turned out okay to eat, but looked terrible, and I was looking for a cookie that I could make for a friend.

I love mexican wedding cakes!! This recipe was great and simple. I substituted almond extract for almonds since the kids don't like actual nuts in their food and it tasted awesome!

these are by far my favorite wedding cookie recipe. i tried some of the others on allrecipes and these taste the most like the danish wedding cookies you get at the store in the pink box. the only thing i did different was add a little bit of cinnamon to the confectionary sugar that you roll the cookies in. i also used pecans very finely chopped in stead of walnuts. i weighed all the cookies on a scale so they would bake evenly.

Outstanding. I tried some without the walnuts, give a thumbprint and topped them with a dollop of buttercream-excellent tea cookies! Definitely add salt if you're using unsalted butter.

These are melt in your mouth scumptious!  You do have to be sure to mix it VERY well, otherwise it's too crumbly to work with.  But mix it under you can form it all into a solid dough lump, and it's easy to work with.

These are so good and easy. If you roll them in the sugar when they are warm, let them cool then roll again. That's the way Sunset mag says to do it.

I fallowed this recipe exactly and they turned out SO good! Whenever I think of christmas cookie trays these cookies are always on it! I used a table spoon to scoop out the dough. it made them a little smaller then normal but I have 20 cookie trays to make and needed to stretch the recipe and it ended up making 46 cookies! I also cooked them for 10 minutes they were a perfect texture not to soft and not to crunchy. I will be making these again for sure!

These are awesome.  The only thing I did different was to toast the walnuts a bit before chopping them.  Not sure if this makes a lot of difference but they are so good I barely waited for them to cool before sneaking a few.

These were so yummy! Very light and buttery. I made them for a cinco de mayo party in my Spanish class and everybody loved them. I used only 1 cup of walnuts and ground them. Also, I made them smaller, and got almost 80 cookies!

A very simple, very good light Mexican Wedding Cake. I served these at a Mexican themed bridal shower, so they were a perfect dessert. I used black walnut extract because we were out of vanilla, but I strongly encourage you to use Mexican vanilla because it tastes a little different and isn't expensive. The only issue that I had was that these were very crumbly and they didn't all make it through the rolling in powdered sugar process. I will toast the walnuts next time, too. Great cookie!

This was my first time around trying to make this type of cookie, and I am not disappointed. I made the dough the night before I baked them (kids interrupted me). When I took the dough out of the fridge it was a little too stiff to work with, but 10 minutes on the counter took care of that. I made 2 different sizes (baked on separate sheets), nickel size, and half-dollar size balls. I fit 48 of the small ones on the first sheet, and about 18 larger ones on the second sheet. I baked the small ones for about 8 minutes and the large ones for 11 minutes. Both batches turned out perfect, and they were so easy. Definitely wait until they are totally cooled off before you roll them in the powdered sugar, I got excited and rolled a few too early because I wanted to try them. The powdered sugar gets all gooey if they are still warm. Awesome recipe, thanks!

These are really yummy. I followed the recipe exactly except for 2 things. I used only 1 3/4 cups walnuts because that's what the package that I bought had in it. I actually think that 1 1/2 cups would've been ok too. This has a ton of nuts in it. The second thing I did differently was to roll the cookie in powdered sugar once a few minutes out of the oven and again when completely cooled. I think that worked better because the 1st time while it's still warm makes the sugar sticky so that the 2nd coat sticks well. I am not sure how it would have worked waiting until they were completely cooled to do the powdered sugar. I gave this a 4 star rating only because I can't say for sure that there isn't a better recipe than this for the Mexican wedding cakes. I think maybe pecans would taste a little bit better. Overall, I would make these again for sure. It was very quick and easy to do with minimal clean up.

We were looking for something to bring to dessert to follow a Mexican dinner at a friend's house and this recipe was the one.  I had misplaced my pastelitos de boda recipe from years ago and was glad to find it. We used pecans chopped up in the food processor instead of walnuts; first batch some of the cookies broke when removing from cookie sheet.  Probably letting them cool a bit would prevent that.  Make sure the butter is not too soft; if you melt the butter too much, it makes the dough too sticky to form balls easily. Don't form the balls too big. The cookies are really muy ricas; delicate and reminiscent of a shortbread. The cupcake liners for serving really amp up the elegance in presentation; our friends were delighted to receive them; you can put them in the liners on a "silver" platter from a dollar store or a tray or plate lined with gift wrap, covered with colored or clear plastic wrap.

I halved the original recipe ingredients and rolled each cookie into about one inch balls and still came out with over 40 cookies.  I finely chopped the walnuts as well. I sampled a few when they came out of the oven - they were still moist and chewy and I was a little disappointed that they didn't come out right.  Then I let them cool completely (as the recipe states), finished rolling into the sugar and they were so good, just as I remember growing up eating!  I will definitely make again.

Fantastic! They're just like the description- light, buttery, crunchy. I used almond extract instead of the vanilla, added in some cinnamon and nutmeg, and swapped in some pecans, almonds and hazelnuts for some of the walnuts and roasted the nuts before putting in the batter.. Delicious, and so easy! Will definitely be making these again.

These were very good.  I didn't roll the baked cookies in the sugar.  Instead I sifted the powdered sugar over the top of the cookies twice.  I also bumped up the vanilla to 1 tsp.

Very easy and tasty!  I also omitted the powdered sugar from the mix and used salted butter.  Worked very well.  I also put the nuts in my food processor to make them very small.  Helped with the texture a lot!  The trick is not to make the too big and not to handle the mix any more than necessary. Definitely a keeper!

Nice, simple and good.  Could be a little dry at times, though.

I've enjoyed these cookies since I was a child!  I have seen them with other names as well such as Russian Teacakes, Cuban Teas and Snowballs.  As far as I can tell, they are all the same.  I made these for holiday cookie trays and they were a great addition!  I will definitely make these again and again, with the recipe exactly as written.

These cookies were very tasteless...  I even add another 1/2 cup of powder sugar into the batter but still didn't taste as good as I expected...  I don't know if it's because I used almonds instead of walnuts...???  And I think the chunk of almonds interfere the cookies' texture also.... Maybe I should have grind the nuts...???

If I could give this more stars, I would.  I took these to a potluck, and people RAVED about them!  Some guests were even holding on to the bowl of cookies so they could just keep eating them.  Needless to say, the cookies disappeared before the end of the night.  Excellent recipe; don't change a thing!

These were easy to make and looked pretty, but I didn't enjoy the flavor much.  Not sure why, but they almost had a bitter or salty aftertaste.

Just made these little buttery balls of perfection!! I would recommend adding just a tad bit more vanilla. I choose not to put the nuts in and they taste just as good! My husband can't keep his hands off of them! The batter yielding about 45 balls. No more than a quarter's width and no more than 1 inch high. They came out perfect!

We call these polvorones and I hadn't had one since I left Texas five years ago. I ground the walnuts in my Magic Bullet before adding them to the mixture. They were sooo delicious I couldn't stop eating them!

Great, simple recipe. I've tried others that have baking powder, and other ingredients,  but this simple version is better. I personally like to double the vanilla though.

These were very easy to make and have great texture, but I have a super sweet-tooth and they weren't quite as sweet as I'd like.  They were still very good, and will make a nice addition to the Christmas cookie line-up.

These cookies were a hit!  I followed the recipe exactly and they cooked perfectly.  Make sure you roll them in the powdered sugar while they are still hot.  This allows the sugar to stick to the cookies, giving them their sweet taste.  They melt in your mouth!

These were pretty good. At first I was skeptical. They definitely have to cool completely before you can move them off of the baking sheet to the cooling rack as they fall apart.  My son and I made these for a spanish class project for school tomorrow but I think I'll stick to an old recipe I have that are more moist and sturdy.

These are delicious! I add some cinnamon and other spices as well as chocolatechips and drizzle them with melted chocolate which is the way I've been taught to make them but I LOVE the original as well. They taste even better with some almonds too. My family has always loved these ever since my sister made them for spanish class and I even remember making them for lemonade stands and bake sales for years and this recipe is one of the best!

These are fantastic! I can't believe anyone would think anything but YUM of these!  The only changes I made was to use super finely chopped pecans - instead of walnuts - and I took other recipe reviewers advice and rolled them in powdered sugar twice.

Good basic recipe with modifications: Use one cup nuts, 2 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp salt. In addition, use 1/2 cup of p.sugar in cookies and then an additional 1 - 1 1/2 cups for rolling. Refridgerate dough for at least an hour. When they come out, cool for a few minutes, roll in sugar and cool completely...then roll again. If they are not cooled all the way the sugar will melt!

Though this cookie is edible, it tastes more like a nutty flour ball rolled in powdered sugar. Pretty disapointed...I think more vanilla and more sugar is called for in order to get a taste going other than the nut and flour.

Thanks for posting this, as I couldn't find my old recipe.  This was the perfect replacement, but I did modify it --only because I've always found this type of cookie to be a bit dry. Instead of 2 cups walnuts, I used about 3/4 cp chopped pecans and 1/2 cup chopped almonds.  I also added about a cup of chocolate chips.  I was just playing around, but it turned out to be the perfect amount of added moisture and sweetness.

MMMMM...great recipe! These little buttery balls just melt in your mouth, and they were so easy to make. I didn't have any walnuts, so I used pecans instead. I also added about a teaspoon of cinnamon. DELICIOUS!

I just made these and my children did not like them. I think overall they are okay but some sugar should be added in the recipe along with the dough other than the confectioner sugar. Sorry but, my cookie loving kids gave this a thumbs down.

Excellent cookie! Delicate flavor, not too sweet.  I lived in southern New Mexico, which is pecan country, and fresh pecans made all the difference. And do NOT waste your time or tastebuds using margarine! Use butter.

These are simply divine. My Nanny made these when I was younger, and thid recipe produces a lighter and somehow better cookie!! This recipe is easy and the end result gets an A+ in our family! I didn't sift anything, just dumped and mixed with my hands. Another tip, I chopped the walnuts pretty fine, and it acted as part of the binder. I also did some bite-sized cookies for 7 minutes, and they were adorable!!!

Unbelievably easy, and they just melt in your mouth. I made mine a bit smaller so they were more bite size, and used half pecans and half walnuts. I also piled them in a bowl with a linen instead of individual cupcake liners, it was another fun way to display them. yumyum.

Wonderful recipe! They look so pretty in the mini cupcake liners. I baked them for a Mexican festival and everyone wanted the recipe. I used half English walnuts and half pecans as I didn't have enough walnuts - they were delicious! Definitely a keeper!

Excellent! I creamed the butter and then sifted the flour and powdered sugar into it along with the other ingredients rather than mixing it together all at once. These are keepers!

These are very good. I have made them several times, with one change a must for me. I have only ever had Mexican wedding cakes with pecans, not walnuts. I did try the walnuts, but didn't care for them; the flavor was not the rich taste I look for in this cookie. I did grind the pecans quite fine in the food processor first, think that contributes to the shortbread-like texture that is the hallmark of a good Mexican wedding cake cookie, IMHO. I used my smallest cookie scoop for this, and baked them on Air Bake pans as they are quite delicate and overbrown easily.

These were fantastic!  I made them to take to a Cinco de Mayo Fiesta and had to keep a few for myself!  I softened the butter slightly in the microwave and then mixed it with 1 tsp of vanilla. I used walnuts, but I processed them super fine before mixing them in the batter.  It is important to make these very small when shaping!  They turned out great!

We used to only find these at the Bon Marche (now Macy's) in Seattle.

I came looking for this recipe when I got married 6 years ago. They were such a big hit, and tasted exactly the way I had remembered them, that I started making these for Christmas time too.

The only change I have made over the years, is slight. I like to add a little spice of some kind. So far pumpkin pie spice is a winner in my house, however ginger and cinnamon work well to. Just add to your personal taste.

I like making these for Christmas, they're quite yummy! Very important to wait until they completely cool before rolling in powdered sugar. Give them a couple minutes on the baking sheet before you transfer to a wire wrack, they will be a lot easier to handle. My only cimplaint: wish I'd had a melon baller to make them perfectly even : (

These were excellent!  I loved them and will make them again.  I did have to keep dipping them in the powdered sugar a few days later, because it all fell off. But, lots of powdered sugar is a must, so I didn't mind. Thanks.

I love this recipe.  I tried it with the walnuts and then with pecans instead.  Both are wonderful.  I rolled them in some special sparkly sugar after the powdered sugar and put them in little paper baking cups.  They looked lovely this way.  My best friend begged for this recipe.

Being a diabetic, I have lerned to change recipies around to make them more Diabetic friendly. I like this recipie because it doesn't call for alot of the confectioners sugar do I can actually eat mre than one.
I make this every Christmas for my family and friends. I make several batches changing the extracts. My favorite is peppermint.  This year I am going to try lemon and orange.
I also read a review where theperson colored the dough, that sounds like fun especially where I like to use peppermint extract. I'll let you know how they turn out.

Wow, these are great and I only used 1 c. chopped walnuts.  I accidentally didn't buy enough walnuts but 1 c. seemed to be a good amount anyway. Delicious!

Awesome!  I put one cup of chopped walnuts and one cup of sweetened flaked coconut that I toasted.  Instead of leaving them round, I flattened them a little.  You can put them about an inch apart because they hardly spread.

Love, love, love this recipe! Instead of using chopped walnuts I put them in my food processor for a bit so they where almost a powder but not quite. I made a ton thinking there would be leftovers after my party. Not a chance. Super yummy!

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for in an eggless cookie.  I was also successful using hazelnuts and pecans in place of the almonds.

These are delicious and quick and easy to make.  I used pecans rather than walnuts. The cookies were moist and yummy, very short.  Perfect with coffee or tea.

These were super easy and absolutely delicious.  I did half pecans and half walnuts and the taste was rich but not overly so.  It was a cinch to put a bunch of cooled cookies into a big ziploc with powdered sugar and shake to coat -- they held up fine.

I usually make these every year at Christmas (and whenever my mom requests them, they are her favorite!)  But tonight my daughter told me she needed cookie for her Dia de los Muertos celebration in her Spanish class tomorrow.  So I decided, these are Mexican, I'll make them... then to make them for Day of the Dead, I made them skull shaped and decorated them with flowery shapes & other confections before baking.  Instead of rolling in powdered sugar, I sprinkled them... the sugar covered a lot of the decorations, so I cleared the sugar from just the decorations with a toothpick dipped in water.

This turned out pretty good! However, I think they were a little more dry than other recipes, and next time I'll try adding a little more butter.

Also, I changed the shape to a 1/4" thick rectangle and dipped it in chocolate. came out great!!

I don't really bake so this was awesome. I forgot about a Mexican fiesta potluck at work & this was the easiest recipe late at night. Easy & Yum! I usually *have* to have chocolate in some way with baked goods. These were perfect. Definitely rolled them twice in sugar. My fiancee was jealous of my work peeps. I had to set aside a batch for us, er, him. :)

I used to buy these cookies at a local department store bakery.  When I got married three years ago, I knew I wanted these cookies.  When I went to buy them, the store had gone out of business.  With this recipe, I got the cookie I remembered, I was able to make enough for 100 guests the night before my wedding, they are so easy.  I now make them when I bake my christmas cookies every year, and they still get the most compliments.  Every one loves the "melt in your mouth" texture.  I like to drizzle them in a little chocolate after I roll them in powdered sugar, as a finishing touch.

Sorry. I bake often but these were a mess-- floury, crumbly, and flavorless. Nothing like the Mexican Wedding Cakes I've had before.

I have made these cookies over the years under various different names.  These received the most compliments, though.  Out with the other recipes.  So easy, too!  The other recipes were telling me to roll once in powdered sugar while still warm, then again when cool.  It never adhered to the cookie right.  These work and much LESS work!  Thank you.

I got some of these cookies from the local bakery over the holidays, and when I went back for more, they said they are only a holiday cookie. I tried this recipe and made no changes. It will not be just a holidy cookie around here, they were perfect and so EASY.  My toddler and my teen both loved them and couldn't get them eaten fast enough.  I had to hide some for my hubby. 5 EASY STARS

My mother and I used to make these all the time when I was little, but we did one thing differently.  We cooled the baked cookies on the cookie sheet for about 5 minutes and then rolled them in the powdered sugar carefully (they are very fragile and will crumble if handled too roughly).  Then we let them cool completely on a rack and rolled them in sugar again after they were cooled.  More sugar stuck to the cookies that way and they were sweeter than if we had only rolled them in sugar once.

I made this with a few changes.  I added 1 teaspoon of almond flavor,  a 1/4 teaspoon salt,  3 more tablespoons of confectioner sugar a and  1 cup of finely chopped pecans.  They were very tasty.

My favorite cookie! I use pecans, walnuts and black walnuts depending on what I have on hand. I do bring the nuts finer and I also sift the flour and powdered sugar together. Great recipe!

This was my first time making Mexican Wedding  Cakes (aka Russian Tea Cakes or Snowball Cookies) and I'm thrilled with the results!! This recipe was a cinch to make and used minimal ingredients. It only took about a half hour of total prep and bake time. The majority of the effort was shouldered by my stand mixer, but a hand mixer would easily do the trick.  I made these as a Christmas treat, so I bought festive cupcake liners to place the cakes in, and they look great!!

My favorite Christmas cookies!  you must roll/coat them with powdered sugar as soon as you can possibly touch them, and then roll again in powdered sugar again after totally cooled. The secret to baking is the edges will be lt. brown, but insides will be done if just firm when removing from oven. Handle carefully for 1st sugar coating as they are fragile at this stage!! After that, not so much...accidentalyy scrunched a zip-lock bag full against the side of a wicker chair and all survived!! enjoy!

We both really enjoyed the cookies.  We rarely give a 5* as that is for only the best of the best.  Maybe add a little more butter??? but a very good cookie.

These were ok, but i wouldn't make this recipe again without modifications.  I added twice the amount of  vanilla but it still needed more. In my  opinion it also should only have half the nuts and they need to be chopped very fine. If you do this it will hopefully turn out much better!

I loved this recipe. I followed it exactly the first time and then put my spin on it when I made it again. I made several different batches using different extracts and nuts , so I ended up with varieties. My family loved them. I plan on making them and giving out as Christmas gifts to my co-workers. They are so moist and you can’t just eat one!

Melt in your mouth cookies.  I ground the walnuts fine before adding.  Baked 10 minutes and let cool on the cookie sheets.  I put the cookies in my tupperware container, added the confection sugar and rolled gently to coat.

I modified as follows: Increased vanilla to 1 Teaspoon, and  added 1/4 teas salt. The recipe didn't state whether to use a greased or ungreased pan, so I used parchment paper on the baking pans, and they turned out fine. Also, "small"  I translated as one inch balls. Otherwise, a very nice recipe.

this is only cookie recipe I use year round.  I am allergic to eggs and love the simplicity and it always always turns out great. Every time I do a different flavor (vanilla, cardamom, nutmeg, fennel seeds, pepper, orange rind, lemon rind) and different nuts.

these taste good but i found them to be crumbly when i took them out of the oven. i made the recipe as written but added 2 tsps of vanilla instead of 1.5. the get a little more solid once they're cool, but some still split apart when i rolled them in sugar.

This is the second time I make these cookies. The first time I followed a different recipe and it said to use regular white sugar, this time I made it with confectioners sugar and the cookies are much softer and taste a lot better. Will try this recipe again.

JUST ok. Needed modified. I made them to the tee and didn't like them. Now if I make them MY way, then I found it loads better to almost melt the butter, mix everything together, but I also added some cinnamon/sugar along with a a pinch of salt and nutmeg. (they DO NOT come out as balls but small drop cookies) The confectioners sugar, if it turns out a bit moist and you can't roll them good, I added the confectioners sugar as it helped with the rolling and drying them up a bit. (spray your hands with PAM butter spray also) i pop them in the confectioners sugar w/cinnamon sugar as soon as they come out of the oven. Not sweet enough or to your liking, drop them in again once they've been coated once and cooled for just a few min =)

Came out great, but used 1 cup of chopped walnuts and next time will use more vanilla. There is a little bitter aftertaste from the walnut skins maybe? Over all good.

This is my fav cookie of all time and I always come back to this recipe because you don't need to chill the dough and I'm not a fan of almond extract. I add them to my treat bags for Christmas and people always comment on them.

These were very good but a little to dry. I used to make these all the time but lost the recipe. I'll have to keep looking for just the right one. The recipe I had I think used granulated sugar, they were also very buttery but not as dry. This recipe is very good but not exactly what I was searching for as an end result.

I love this recipe. I have a few changes tho. I use ground pecans and I roll in powdered sugar after five minutes cooling time. Then I roll them in granulated sugar that I had put a whole vanilla bean into, (marinated sugar with bean for two weeks before use, shaking it up every few days) I did notice that those that didn't like these cookies, were disappointed they were not a sweet cookie, and had little other flavor. The vanilla sugar adds more flavor. And these are not supposed to be a sweet cookie. My suggestion for those looking for a sweet cookie to stick to chocolate chip, or a real sugar cookie.

Yum yum yum!! These polvorones are one of my favorite cookies to make and eat :) I get so excited about them sometimes that I have to remind myself to not inhale when I take a bite so as to not aspirate the powdered sugar!

Super Super Easy recipe, I just had to cook them a little longer than stated.  My guest at my Mexican Fiesta ate them up!  I plan on making a double batch next time and just freeze the dough so I can always have it on hand, they were that good!  Great cookie for the kids!

Loved these!  I used 1 cup mini chocolate morsels and 1 cup finely chopped pecans instead of the walnuts, but otherwise I kept to the recipe.  They were perfect!!  I really put forth some self control not to eat too many.

The perfect recipe. These are especially good when one is drinking a sweet hot beverage such as a chai tea or something like that. These aren't super sweet on their own and they go nicely with a sweet drink.  Thanks.

These are wonderful!  I like that they are not really sweet.  I put lots of powdered sugar on them and they are still not too sweet.  I made them as a gift but they may not last long enough to give away!!

These are crunchy little buttery bites, and if you like buttery cookies that aren't very sweet, you'll love these. I made a half-batch, and I only had just over ½ cup of walnuts, but they still turned out well. While I wasn't blown away by these cookies, my 2-year old daughter couldn't shovel the pieces of one cookie into her mouth fast enough. I would give it 4 stars myself, but I'm rating it 5 because she loves them. Thanks, Julie, for a less-sweet-than-usual recipe!

I used to get this little cookie from a popular bakery in town.  They tasted exactly the same! I cooked them for a large crowd as a dessert for a mexican meal.  Their were no cookies left!

This is one of my favorite cookie recipes.  A little delicate but the taste makes up for it.  I usually substitute pecans for the walnuts since I usually have these on hand.  I first tasted these when they were served at my wedding shower.

I adapted this recipe to make it a vegan, healthier version and it still tastes great- use margarine instead of butter and use a 1 cup of almonds and 1 cup of walnuts ground together.

WOW!  Couldn't have been any easier!  I finely chopped the walnuts, and went by the recipe exactly as listed.  This is a terrific cookie, light and buttery, but not very sweet.  Definitely needs the powdered sugar coating!  They taste as great as they look!!

I came across these and thought they sounded easy to make, and I had all of the ingredients.  So on the spur of the moment, I whipped these up one afternoon.  They took less than half an hour and they tasted really great.  I used almond extract instead of vanilla just because I like it better, and I used both walnuts and pecans.  They're so great I've decided to make another batch this afternoon to take to a party.

These melt in your mouth!! Made these for a "Day of the Dead" for my daughters Spanish class, and they were a big success.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.
