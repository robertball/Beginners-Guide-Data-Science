I have been making this recipe for the past 30 years and my family looks forward to it every Christmas.  I use black olives instead of green, roll these in chopped walnuts and serve with onion flavored crackers.

Don't forget the martini.  This was great.  I do recommend that you prepare a day before for all the flavors to mold together.  The first day you could distictly pick up the butter flavor.  As others have said, goes great with wheat thins.

This was really good! I'm an olive and blue cheese lover by themselves, but the taste together was very good! While eating this, I was thinking it would be good warmed in a crockpot and served more as a "dip" than a "ball".  I'll have to try that next time. Thanks for the recipe!

This was great and SO simple!  I love green olives and bleu cheese, so this was perfect.  I made it the night before serving.  My grocery store was out of fresh chives, so I subbed 1 TBS. fresh parsley instead.  Other than that, made it per the recipe.  I plan to make it again for Christmas Eve.  Thanks for sharing this recipe--I know my cheeseball family will enjoy it! :-)

Best cheeseball ever, hands down.  I make the recipe for 20 or 30, then we eat it for days.  I now use gorgonzola instead of bleu cheese for the extra zing.  This cheeseball actually seems to get better as it stays out, and in the days after (from the fridge of course).  Perhaps it is the cheese getting to breathe.  Feel free to add more of whatever you like in the recipe, and there is room to experiment.  It also tastes fine if you get the salad olives with pimentos.

This was unbelievably good.  I love to take pictures of the food I make from AR, but, we had already eaten half of it before I could get my camera out.  I will try next time to be faster.  Believe me something has to be really good for me to give a 5 star rating.  I used a combination of Roquefort and an English cheese called Shropshire Blue.  Wow.  Otherwise I didn't change a thing.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe.

This was good.  I made with black and green olives, rolled in walnuts and served with red chili sauce and wheat thins.  It was easy to make the night before, it wasn't flying off the appetizer table, but then there were LOTS of appetizers on the table, so maybe people just didn't realize just how good it really was!

Good recipe.  I modified it a bit, as follows: Used less blue cheese, and used some finely shredded sharp cheddar to make up the difference; also used half chopped green olives and half chopped black olives.  Everyone enjoyed it a lot!

It was sensational, everyone loved it and I can't believe how it easy it was to make.  Only thing was that I used dried chives instead of fresh, the store was out of them. Still great flaver and great with crackers.  Will definitely make this recipe again.

I used sliced green olives with the pimientos and I thought this was quite tasty and festive.  I'll be making this for our family's Christmas Eve gathering, and many more times, I'm sure!  Brought it to a pot-luck gathering and someone requested the recipe.

Everyone LOVED this. Even my 6 year old who hates olives. The only change I made was to add some black olives with the green. The blue cheese wasn't overpowering. It added a great tang.

Fantastic spread with all of my favorite ingredients! Big hit at Easter! I took "SHORECOOK'S" suggestions and also rolled in the walnuts. (BTW Cape May is my yearly favorite place to be!!) Thank you so much Kristle for a wonderous appy!!

MAGNIFICENT!  I've had this in my recipe box for so long and finally I made it.  I wish I had long ago for it is so good.  I love olives and blue cheese so I knew it would be a winner.  It has a strong flavor which I love.  I used a small food processor to blend but stirred in the chopped olives.  I chopped walnuts and rolled the cheese ball in it after chilling.  To sped up the chilling process, I put the cheese ball in the freezer for 15-20 minutes.  This recipe will be used many times over in my family.

My 13 year old daughter made it for Thanksgiving and it just disappeared under our eyes!!! It is fabulous though we changed the plain green olives for anchovy-stuffed olives which added an extra layer of flavour. In addition to the olives we also mixed in some creamed blue cheese and crumbled Roqueford. Yummy,Yummy! You can't go wrong with this one.

Thank you for this yummy recipe! I didnt make it quite as specified, but I'm sure it would be yummy that way too. I used black olives, as a few others have, because they come already minced up in a can that's the perfect size. I could not find fresh chives to save my life, so I used four green onions instead. I added the last little tiny bit of ranch dressing in the bottle, just because, and half an avocado all mashed up in the cheese, also just because. It's really good! Will absolutely make again.

I took this to a potluck and it was the hit! Everyone wants the recipe. I used a marinated olive and red pepper mixture (Mezzetti brand) which was really good. The bleu cheese flavor is very subtle.

I didn't add the butter or the chives and this was still AMAZING! The cream cheese downplays the strong blue cheese flavor.

I followed this recipe verbatim and absolutely loved it! I made it for my contribution towards our 12 Days of Christmas office celebration last year. It was gone within 30 minutes of putting it on the table! I received so many compliments, I'm serving it again this year.

I also make this, and actually prefer it with chopped black olives.  I've taken a double-batch to a potluck dinner and had not a bit left at the end of the night.

The only reason I'm not giving this recipe five stars is because I don't follow it exactly. I have made it several times and NEVER use the butter. It turns out beautifully without it. I used a 4 oz container of blue cheese, which is plenty. I also skip the chives unless I'm going to be using them for something else (no reason to buy a packet of them just for this.) After gathering the mixture (mixed well in my stand mixer) into a ball, I roll in chopped walnuts. I wrap it in plastic and then stick it In bowl so it retains its shape in the refrigerator. Definitely make it the day before so that the flavors meld together and the ball sets up. I usually make two cheese balls for parties...this is the most popular one.

I loved this cheese ball and it was a hit at our party!  I added black olives and kalamata olives to the cheese ball as well and used more than half a cup all together!  It was so good!

Excellent for those who love strong tastes.  I was lazy and didn't even roll it into a ball.  In fact my hubby and I ate it warmed up because we like our dips warm, especialy on cold nights. Wheat thins are the perefect balace since they are a liitle sweet.  Very easy to modify to your tastes too (we like LOTS of blue cheese!) Thanks for the easy recipe.

This was so good - I have never made a cheese ball, and who knew it was so easy - I'll never buy storebought again. A crowd pleaser at Thanksgiving for sure.

I would add  a lot more olives than the recipes calls for, otherwise you can't really taste them.  Overall this is blue cheese delicous!

This was great!  Very, very easy and quick to make and a good one for making in advance.  It had a very strong bleu cheese flavor, which me and my husband loved!

Perfection in a cheese ball! I made a double batch for a baby shower. I shaped it into a hedgehog, so it had almond spines instead of chopped walnuts. The flavors melded perfectly! I had stuffed green olives in hand, and intended to remove the pimentos. Gave that up like 30 seconds in! It tastes fine with them in. It was a huge hit, no adjustments needed.

I used half green olives, half black olives as one reviewer suggested. It was a big hit and guests requested the recipe. I referred them to allrecipes.com.

Delicious!  On my way to a Martini night celebration... I bet they will love it!  I also went with the walnut roll after mixing it up.  It looks great and is gigantic!

This recipe sounded great!  I love all the ingredients.  The first few bites were ok, but then  it was a little overpowering.  It tasted like a blue cheese stuffed olive, which is much easier to buy :)
