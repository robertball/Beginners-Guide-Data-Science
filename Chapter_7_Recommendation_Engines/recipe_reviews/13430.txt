This soup is great!  Easy to make too.  I used 1/4 of a large brick of cheddar instead of the velveeta.  Awesome!!

Tastes great and easy to make! Because I don't like raw onions I saut√©ed the onions with the meat and added a little garlic and other spices. Should not have added salt though, as the other ingredients already contained enough salt.

This is a 5-star recipe if you add a packet of enchilada sauce mix or taco seasoning.  Next time I'll chop the tomatoes so they're similar in size to the beans and corn.  Delicious!

Excellent soup, easy to follow recipe. I gave four stars because I had to double the Velveeta to get the texture I wanted, but I think that is a personal taste thing. I love the whole kernel corn, it adds texture, and a little sweetness. I am vegetarian, so used reconstituted Textured Vegetable Protein (TVP) {2 cups dry} for the ground beef. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T. Yummy stuff!

Excellent recipe!  I used only 2/3 of the cheese due to other reviews that said it was more like a dip than a soup and cooked the onions with my hamburger and added some garlic with the meet as well.  Didn't have ranch beans so I added a can of black eyed peas and they soaked up the flavors wonderfully.  Rave reviews by EVERYONE!!!!  Thanks for the recipe.

Very easy to make and my husband loved it. I recommend not leaving the soup on warm on the eye because it burned the rest of the batch. That was my fault. Will make again.

Very easy and tasty. Mu husband made it and it was really good. He said it was very simple to make - just cook the beef and then throw it all in the pot to simmer. We had it with salad to make give us some nice crunchy green stuff along with the chunk, creamy soup.

This is my family's favorite soup recipe. My kids say "All right!!!" when they know I am fixing Santa Fe Soup. My husband brought some men from work home for lunch to eat this soup and it was a total "thumbs up" meal. It is so easy to fix. I keep all the ingredients on hand and we even eat it during the summer. It also makes a great dip with some white corn tortilla chips. Thanks!

Yummy!  I sauteed' the onion with garlic cause we like garlic.  Added some southwestern spice, a little crushed red pepper and we were ready to go.  For serving, I sprinkled with some chopped cilantro, a dollop of sour cream and sprinkled with some taco chips.  I would call this more of a "chowder" than a soup, but delicious just the same.  For those reviewers concerned about type of bean...add the kind you like i.e. kidney, black or pinto.  And, if you like a less thick consistency, do what another reviewer suggested.....add some broth.  Thumbs up for this cool weather soup here in the midwest.

This will be great on a cold, winter day.  A little heavy with the cheesy taste, but makes an excellent dip with taco shells.  My daughter-in-law went back for seconds...well,knock me over with a leaf!  I think I'll reserve all the liquids and add them as needed to make a dip, but needs a little more liquid to be a "real" soup.  But this is a keeper.

I also do as S. Orlando does with this and use it as a dip. I've been making it for years, only adding in taco seasoning
for added flavor boost. Whenever I make it, I always make copies of the recipe on 3x5 cards for the guests. Everyone always wants the recipe.

This is sooooo good! Great for a winter night. I made it with 1 can black beans and one can ranch style beans. I didn't feel like chopping up the onion so I just used onion powder and a dusting of season salt while the meat was browning. After I dumped all the cans in, I didn't think it looked like enough liquid before I added all that cheese, so I added about a cup or so of chicken broth, till the consitency looked right to me. Then I added the cheese and let it heat up and melt. I used mild rotel, so i also put a little crushed red pepper in for more spicyness. I'm going to get a bowl now, with a warm flour torilla AND chips.

Simple, cheap, and yummy!  I used only 1 can of beans since I'm nursing and I used some taco seasoning in the meat and omitted the onions.  Also, I used Mexican style corn as others have used.  We had it as a soup for dinner with crushed up blue corn tortilla chips and sour cream on top.  For lunch the next day (this recipe makes a lot) we had it as a dip.  Also, I made it for my sister as a freezer meal and used a heavy duty zip-loc and it froze beautifully and she said it tasted great!

This is excellent though I don't know if I would classify it as a soup; more like a hearty dip or as my husband calls it, a cheesy stew :) I used ground turkey (we don't eat red meat) and it worked out fine. Didn't have any canned tomatoes with green chiles handy, and so instead, I used 1 cup of medium salsa (Big Lots has a southwestern salsa with black beans and corn). Delicious!!! I also added about 1/2 packet of taco seasoning, as suggested by other reviewers, and also omitted salt. This was a great meal, served with heated crispy taco shells and a salad.

This was sooooo easy and very delicious.  My husband, two teenagers, my 6 yr. old and myself all loved it.  I couldn't find ranch-style beans so I also used black beans.  This one is definitely a keeper!!  Thanks Sammye!

I thought this tasted great but had a poor visual appearance.  I left out the corn and used black beans instead of ranch.

This recipes was not worth eating again. If you want to make something similar to this take out the onion and tomatoes and corn and beans. Add one can of rotel tomatoes any type that you like. It makes a great dip, that is why i was excited to try this recipe. Disappointment. But i did try it first with out the straight recipe, didn't like it. Then i tried adding taco seasoning, still no. Lastly i added more tomatoes which helped a tiny bit but just not worth serving. I'm glad this suits someones taste buds other than my own.

I used Ro-Tel which made it somewhat spicy (too spicy for my 10-yr old).  My 13-yr old and husband loved it, though!  I also added some taco seasoning and sprinkled tortilla chips as a garnish.  Afraid to think how fattening it is!

I cooked the onions with the ground beef, as reviewed. I used some leftover canned tomatoes and salsa that I probably wouldn't have used otherwise, in place of the tomatoes listed. Great to eat with chips and very filling!

Outstanding! Can I give 10 stars??? This was the best meal I've had in weeks. Fantastic! I seasoned the ground beef with taco seasoning, used only one can of beans, and a small can of corn. I also used about 3/4 a pound of Velveeta. I served this in big bowels with crushed tortilla chips on the bottom. We dipped warm flour tortillas in the soup. I topped mine with Seasoned Salt, and hubby topped his with extra raw onion. YUMMY!!! Thanks for sharing, this is defientaly a keeper!!!

We thought this was pretty good, but had too many tomatoes for us.  I will try this again with 1 can of Rotel, extra green chili peppers; add some garlic powder, and some Fiesta Fajita seasoning, 1 can or ranch-style beans and 1 can of black beans.

We thought this was great...a new twist to chili! I didn't change a thing and it the leftovers were even better when the flavors really melded together! Thanks sammye! I'll be making this easy soup again!!

This was so simple to make but tasted wonderful - I have passed this along to my sister-in-law with one rule - she can't tell my brother how many cans she opened.  This is prefect to make when you have been at work all day and just don't feel like cooking a big meal - (everyone will think that you did).

This was really tasty! I don't know if I would call it a soup... more like a cheesy chili. Anyway, it's good! This would be a great soup for football Sundays; it is very rich and filling. I halved the recipe, omitted the onions, added a clove of garlic that I sauteed with the meat. I added a generous shake of taco seasoning and used a can of Mexicorn instead of regular corn. Served with homemade tortillas for dipping.  Very good, thank you! :)

Yummy and very, very easy! I used venison instead of beef (seasoned w/ taco seasoning), and kidney beans instead of ranch-style beans. This is a good, quick meal.

This was easy to make and had a good flavor.  I might try using shredded cheddar cheese next time because I feel Velveeta can often be salty.  I also sauteed the onion first.  Overall nice recipe.

This is very fast & easy to make. Be warned, it is rich! I added another can of diced tomatoes to cut it. It really needed the fajita seasoning that I added (2T about) - we topped with fresh cilanto too. I sub. hominy for the corn too.

A tasty & easy to make soup.  The only thing I did different was to use jalapeno processed cheese instead of jalapeno diced tomatoes.

This recipe is very easy to make, but it had mixed reviews at my house.  My brothers thought there were too many tomatoes.  I thought it was a little runny (but I did use light processed cheese).  The overall taste was fine though.

Really good, my husband thought it may really amp up the flavor with a can of rotel and honestly I thought it could use more meat, maybe double.  Good, easy recipe, lots of leftovers.  I will let you know how freezing does to it later.

We did not care for this version of Santa Fe Soup. As it tasted more like a dip than a soup. Maybe if cheese was on the side as the processed cheese was overwhelming to my family. I added some  extra browned ground beef to the leftovers and took to  work with a bag of Tortilla and put out for my coworkers per family suggestion.  As a dip it went over great!!!

Does anyone know what a serving size is? It says 1/8 of a recipe, but I‚Äôd like to know in ounces what that is. I give this a 5 Star when made w adding 2T of taco seasoning. And I don‚Äôt use an onion in the recipe. Been eating it his way for 20 yrs. My sister gave me this recipe Year‚Äôs ago and that‚Äôs how mine is different from this one. I love it.

This is my fave soup recipe!  I cannot afford to make it often.  I doubled the recipe and placed in the crock-pot for a "pot blessed" dinner at work and it cost me $20 for the ingredients I needed.  Not going to waste money like that often but it was a really good recipe and I will make again someday.  

P.S.  I did not drain the liquid off the cans they blended nicely with the Velveeta to make a good soup.

Very good cold weather soup.  Spice it up too your liking.  Fire roasted diced tomatoes & fire roasted green chili add a great touch!  Used 1/2 velvet a and 1/2 cheddar!  Will make again??

This is a fantastic Mexican / taco soup. I couldn't find ranch-style beans so I used chili beans and used all the other ingredients plus added 2 jalape√±o peppers and a dash of chili powder and cumin. Will definitely make again!

Love this recipe! It's a hearty soup that's not to spicy for my kids. I've made it as is before and it's great, but I prefer real american cheese over the Velveeta.

This was just the basic recipe I needed to use up a couple of things in the fridge.  I  made a creamy potato soup a couple of nights before and had some leftover.  I made a half recipe of Sammye's soup and added a cup of the potato soup.  I also only had a little bit of processed cheese so I sprinkled grated cheddar on each bowl of soup. Seasoned with 1 1/2 teaspoon of taco seasoning.  I used one can of Rotel and some vegetable juice.  Frozen corn.  I used a can of ranch-style beans plus a can of red beans.  I drained the red beans. Made a great soup.  I'll never have the exact ingredients again, but this soup is a wonderfully versatile idea. I'll be using this recipe again.

I made this for my husbands pot luck at work.  I did not want to send it after I tasted it.  It was delish.  Before he came home I had an email from his coworker begging for the recipe!  I am making this again tonight for dinner...cant wait.

Excellent! I didn't change a thing and it turned out great. Plus, it was super easy. I will definitely make again.
