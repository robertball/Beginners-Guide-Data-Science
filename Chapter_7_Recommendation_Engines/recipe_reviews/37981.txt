What a delicious surprise!  I used 2 full eggs instead of 4 egg whites.  I also mixed in some diced red peppers with the eggs and topped with freshed diced tomato instead of salsa.  I really enjoyed it and it was very filling.

MMMMMMM good yummy lunch. I prefer to use the egg white in a carton as it tastes much like regular eggs. Other than that and adding a little green onion, I loved it! Thanks Camille!

My changes seem greater considering the simplicity of the recipe but I wanted to review it anyway. I used my small skillet and egg beaters, simply poured in the egg, added some leftover diced green pepper and covered-no scrambling. When it was cooked through I used the same burner to warm the tostada for a couple of seconds per side. I then put the perfectly-sized egg on the tostada and topped with the cheese(sharp cheddar) and a little green onion. I didn't have any salsa so used several dashes of chipotle hot sauce(tobasco) on top and this was very good. I liked the crunch of the shell. It was a nice change from breakfast burritos.

This had excellent flavor. Too bad the texture was mushy. I didn't like the texture at all and couldn't get over the mush factor. Next time I will just cook the eggs and add the salsa after they are done. I used store brand medium salsa.

The eggs cooked really weird and they almost looked like baby food so next time I would leave the cheese and salsa out of the beaten eggs and just add them ontop. Very easy would be great with some green onion on top!

Liked this a bunch. So simple to prepare. From the time that I decided to make this to taking the first bite was no more than five minutes. Made another one for my son who loves breakfast burritos. He didn't actually love it but I got him to eat it anyway. Made his with the whole egg instead of just the white, not sure which one I liked better. Reduced recipe to two eggs and eyeballed the amounts of cheese, salsa etc. Easily could have made two tortillas with it. Also, used regular flour tortillas instead of whole wheat.

Quick, easy, and delish!  I served it with some salsa on the side, and added some hot sauce to the egg whites as they were cooking.  Very good, thanks Camille!

very yummy. I used one less egg though and I thought that made it taste better.

I used a whole wheat tortilla because that is all I had. I added some fresh tomatoes to top off an already fantastic yummy lunch!

The strangest texture ever...could it be because I used whole eggs rather than egg whites?  I doubt it.  Seems like a lot of you had the same problem.  However, the flavor would have been pretty awesome if it weren't for the mushy texture!

I was hoping for something I could make with the few ingredients I had on hand and of course hoped it would taste good.  Maybe it would help if I had been from Mexico but I did not care for this.  I wish it tasted as good as it smelled.

This egg tostada was so good! I used 2 whole eggs instead of 4 egg whites and a regular tortilla, making it higher calorie, but it was still delicious! I will definitely try adding sour cream next time! Mmm

A quick and easy meal to prepare - I saw this recipe and 5 minutes later - I was eating it! I used liquid egg whites and added a little of the salsa to the egg whites. After I started to eat it, a lot of liquid (i guess from the salsa?)dripped out. Next time I will wrap it with some foil or parchment paper on the bottom to keep everything in. Good recipe.

I used the entire egg instead of just the whites. For the cheese I used some nice strong aged cheddar. Instead of Torrillas I used toast. Very yummy :)

This was very good. We just used a regular flour tortilla. My San Antonio native hubby liked this a bit more than I did; thanks for the post!

This recipe was DELICIOUS and even better, EASY to make! We had a last-minute guest stay over the other night and I was looking for something to make with my limited stock of inventory in the fridge. I typed in "egg" and "cheese" and this was one that came up.

I used whole eggs instead of the whites, and full fat cheese (monterey/jalapeno and shredded mix of mexican cheeses). I eyeballed the amount of cheese and salsa that I mixed in. I also added green onions and fresh cilantro for an added zest.

Our guest went for seconds. The tortillas got a little soggy from the steam from the eggs, but it was good. This recipe would be good without the tortillas as a scrambled egg dish as well.

Next time I will try the low-fat version!

A great change for boring scrambled eggs. This one's a keeper. I used egg beaters.

This made a tasty breakfast. Make sure you drain the salsa a bit before adding to the eggs, this helps with the texture. I added some fresh cilantro. I think I'll try this again.

A good, quick and warm breakfast.  The egg whites were very soft with the added salsa and cheese.  I would have liked them better firmer with the toppings added afterwards.  I did like the little crunch of the toasted tortilla shell.  All-in-all a good breakfast I will make again, just will cook the egg whites differently.

Not bad at all, but I would have enjoyed these more if I had not added the salsa to the eggs before cooking. I didn't like the texture of it all cooked together. Thanks for sharing :)
