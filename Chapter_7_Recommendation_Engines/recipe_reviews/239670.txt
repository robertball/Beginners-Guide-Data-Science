I just bought a new set of cookie cutters, and I just HAD to try them NOW, lol. These cookies are DELICIOUS!!!!! The only change I made was that I needed a bit more flour, so I used about 1/4 cup extra, and that was perfect. Oh, and I didn't measure the vanilla, but I think I used closer to 1 tsp (the more the better, IMO). The dough was super easy to work with, but if you think it's a little too soft, just throw it in the fridge for about 30 minutes, and that should do the trick. I've made lots and LOTS of cut out/sugar cookies, and this recipe is one of the best that I've tried. I halved the recipe and got 26 cookies, which is perfect for us. They did not spread, which was something I was worried about, so YAY!!!! They did puff a bit, but once they began to cool, they settled back down. This recipe was just what I was looking for...simple to make, easy to roll, kept their beautiful shape and were tender, buttery goodness. I will def be using this recipe...A LOT~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

I am a Cookie  Decorating  Instructor and I have always used and given to my students a recipe from a very good Cookie Decorating Book.  I compared the two recipes and they were almost identical EXCEPT for the baking soda and cream of tartar.  My usual recipe does not have those two ingredients . 
What a difference these two make.  The cookies did not spread and they seem lighter in taste.  This is my new favorite recipe.  A hint for bakers to roll cookie dough.  Roll between two  sheets of PARCHMENT paper right after mixing.  You can use long dowel rods 1/4" on each side of your parchment. paper to get perfect thickness cookies.  I use perfection sticks purchased on line for this purpose. The sticks come in three thicknesses for different doughs. Refrigerate  sheets of dough until cold. Cut out your cookies and move to baking sheet while cold.  You can reroll the cookie dough .  WAX PAPER does NOT work for rolling the dough.

Finally, after years and countless batches of trying to make the perfect sugar cookie, this recipe delivers on all my expectations! They are buttery, crispy and just plain delicious! They certainly don't need frosting but taste amazing either way. Thank you for sharing!

Best Sugar Cookie EVER!
I'm a Family and Consumer Science teacher, so I bake a lot. I've never had much luck with cutout cookies, but saw this recipe in the Allrecipes magazine and thought I'd give it a try. BEST RECIPE EVER- came out perfect. Followed recipe exact.

Did try the alteration it suggested with coconut, almond extract, and sliced almonds. Make sure to use angel flake coconut like it says- "regular" coconut you normally get in the store doesn't work very well. Tasted good- weren't pretty though.

After I read the Dec/Jan issue of the magazine, I just had to try. I made this with the cherry/oat, ginger, and chocolate/malt mix-ins. My two teen boys said they were too close to call a winner because they are all so good! I also froze half of each flavored dough to use closer to Christmas in a snap. This is a keeper. Thank you for this recipe. It's perfect!

I would have given these a 4 star because they don't keep their shape as well as I'd like.  And they weren't as easy to handle as another recipe I've used for the last few years because of the stickiness.  But my tasters all loved the flavor of these.  You can't argue with success!  So I have to thank you, SandyG!

I made a half recipe and got 41 nicely sized cookies out of it.  I did double the vanilla and used Imperial Margarine just like my grandmother used to.  In fact, this recipe is very similar to hers (hers had a bit more flower and salt).  Definitely chill at least 4 hours if it is kind of warm outside.  I went overnight and had to re-chill the dough before rolling out a second time. These resulted in a crisp cookie (the thinner rolled ones) and the slightly thicker puffed up nicely.  Both held up well to icing.

This is the perfect sugar cookie.  Soft with just the right amount of sweetness on the inside, and nicely held together  on the outside.  Just like some people of my favorite people!  I halved this recipe with beautiful results.  I see a lot of raters stating this recipe has too much flour, but my batch came together just like a sugar cookie should.  I suspect some of those raters may be a little too heavy-handed with the flour measurement??? I don't use a sifter when I measure flour (ain't nobody got time for that), but I do have a trick.  I open my bag of flour and fluff it up with a whisk.  Then, I gently scoop up the flour with a measuring cup (in a manner that does not compress it) and lightly level-off the mound with my finger.  This method never fails me.  Flour should be light and airy inside your measuring cup, not packed down like brown sugar.  Anyway, back to Sandy's cookies - 10 minutes of baking time is perfect.  Remove them from the oven when they barley start turning brown at the edges (and I mean barely), and after they set for a little bit, they are divine.  Whether you roll them thick or thin, they come out great!

This was the absolute worst cookie recipe. The dough had waaaay too much flour, it was too crumbly and would not come together, and I followed the recipe exactly.

Delicious! I used 2 tsp Vanilla (because I do that with all my cookies) and these were fantastic. I got way more than 24 cookies out of this recipe (41, I believe). This was just what I was looking for. My cookies didn't come out like pancakes like they do with that store bought dough.

I found this recipe in my holiday edition of allrecipes the magazine. I came here to check the reviews before I began. I must start by saying, i consider myself an accomplished baker. But, I have previously been unable to master sugar cookies. With this recipe, I have finally succeeded. I halved the recipe, doubled the vanilla and left everything else as is. Wow! They were easy to roll, made firm, crisp cookies with the best taste ever.  I will always use this recipe going forward! Thanks sandy for sharing this recipe. I will play with it in the future to try the other add ins. Happy holidays Y'all!

Would not attempt without Kitchenaid mixer! (it would kill a hand mixer).  This recipe had me nervous, it seemed like a lot of flour and I didn't think the dough would come together but it did.  Then I put in fridge overnight and when I attempted to roll out, I thought it would never roll out.  But with some persistent rolling I ended up with the best cookies I have ever made.  This is the only recipe I will ever use.

This is a great recipe.  I don't normally like sugar cookies but I was interested to try the add in's from the magazine.  I used the malted milk and cocoa recipe and the Mexican chocolate recipe.  They are both delicious.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This is a fabulous cookie dough.  After reading through the reviews, the only things I did differently were:  used 5 cups flour, 2 Tblsp cornstarch, another 2 tsps vanilla and added 1 tsp nutmeg.  I shaped the dough into 3 nice long logs using wax paper.  Refrig overnight and sliced 1/4'ish inch slices and sprinkled with Christmas colored sugars.  Mine baked perfectly at 10 minutes!  I got A LOT of cookies!!  That was this past Sunday (Christmas Morning), it's now Wednesday, and the cookies are almost gone!  They do not taste "floury" and really just melt as you chew them.  They are soft on the inside, crisp on the outside.  This will certainly become a frequently used cookie dough throughout the year.  I'm sure as cut outs, they would have been wonderful, but I was lazy and had already done that 2 weekends ago with our family.  **Just a tip to those with little experience in baking and/or making cut outs:  to avoid floury and overly dry cookies, if a recipe calls for "blank cups" of flour, shake out about a Tblsp for each cup.  You will get that flour back as you are sprinkling flour for rolling out the dough.  Or you can use all the flour and roll between sheets of wax paper.**

wonderful. I thought I lost the recipe. Made the slices of cherry/oat.coconut doodles, double ginger. Found it to add to my collection. A keeper. But, website imposible to find slices unless you look under sugar cookies.

A very good basic sugar cookie!  I shaped the dough into logs and froze them until I needed them.  Thawed the dough overnight, sliced the cookies, decorated with sugar, and baked them.  Nice and simple.

Two batches of holiday cookies on the books are they are great!! Love the flavor and texture and they are a big hit with my family. I recommend chilling your dough before rolling it out and chilling before baking if you’ve cut out shapes in order to get the best edges. Great recipe

I used this recipe to make cookies in bulk for a non-profit  event (Annie musical), and found that it was inconsistent in its ability to hold the shape of the cookie, even when taking the tips/advice of the previous people. The temperature of the dough didn’t affect the cookie shape, although the dough warms up quickly from fridge temps, however I found putting it straight on a cookie sheet helped (no parchment paper).

For many years I avoided the sister cookie because I just sucked at making the recipe but this recipe was super easy and the dough was easy to handle too. My four year old grandson and 7 year old daughter had no problem with it either. Tasted great too. I did add a lil bit more flour to keep it from being too sticky.

Love this recipe! It makes a delicious sugary buttery cookie that holds up to royal icing decoration. It’s also a perfect “breakfast” cookie, just enough sweet to complement a cuppa. Try it and see for yourself

This recipe was easy to work with and once your dough comes together it cuts easy and holds its shape well.  Unfortunately, the cookies themselves are flavorless and disappointing in taste.  For decoration purposes, they’re good.

I substituted a 3 oz. bar of cream cheese for about 1/4 cup of butter.  The cream cheese seems to help the dough together while you are working with it. The cookies were delicious.

This is a super easy recipe! I didn’t roll out the dough and cut out shapes. Instead I rolled little balls and baked. I then added Hersey Kisses to each after baking.

I halved the recipe and used baking powder in place of cream of tartar and baking soda.  These cookies are soft, but still firm and fluffy. I make these every year for Christmas. My daughter loves them too

I decorate Christmas cookies every year with my family and have been looking for a good recipe and this one is it!! The cookies cut out well and don't blow up when they are cooked. The recipe makes a lot of cookies and uses plain ingredients. The extra instructions were very helpful and made them successful - flour on cookie cutters, parchment paper, 1 inch apart.

My new favorite sugar cookie recipe! Very easy, the dough was much easier to handle than others I’ve tried. I refrigerated it for about 30 minutes, and that’s it. It held its shape well after baking, and the cookies are tasty. I’m not a fan of making rolled cookies, but this recipe made it easy!

Will use again.   Had no cream of tartar and subbed baking powder.  They were cakes when warm but firm when cooled.   Used orange extract and vanilla.  They were wonderful warm.  Not so pronounced when cool.

I've used this recipe for a few years and love it! Sometimes I like to add almond extract or scrape out part of a vanilla bean into the dough. I always pair with the Wilton royal icing recipe with meringue powder.  Results are pretty amazing!

The cookies were great. I didn't have any creme of tartar, so instead of the 1 tsp creme of tartar and 1 tsp baking soda, I used 1.5 tsp baking powder and 0.5 tsp of baking soda.

For the amount of flour used there needed to be at least 1/2 C more sugar. Also for a recipe calling for 5 1/2 C flour there should of been twice the amount of vanilla.

These had no taste.

I don't normally care for sugar cookies, they always taste like bitter cardboard to me, but these are tender and hold up extremely well to all the decorations a kid can throw at them. Grandsons had a blast decorating them. No refrigeration required, except briefly while you roll out the other divided balls of dough. The dough looks like it's all crumbly and not going to hold together, but have faith. I used my hand mixer on a half recipe and it was fine, you just need a bigger bowl if you stick to the original amount, but it won't "kill" a hand mixer by any means. I didn't realize there were "mixins", I'll have to explore that, sounds wonderful. All in all, this is a great sugar cookie recipe of you like sugar cookies.

Very easy to make and very kid friendly!!! I followed the recipe exactly but decreased the cooking time based on the thickness of the cookies. The thinner ones were done in 8 minutes where the thicker ones took the full 10-12 minutes. All in all a keeper!!!!

I just made a batch of this recipe and based on other comments I initially put less flour however when I put the dough on the table and added the remainder of the flour it came out perfect. Very easy to roll however make sure your surface is well dusted as the dough seems to stick a bit. Other than that, on point. Just added it to my favorite cookie folder!!!!

I have never made scratch cookies, ever.  For some weird reason I had an urge to make my wife some sugar cookies, so I came looking.  This recipe was not only easy for someone who has never made cookies from scratch, but delicious too!  They came out perfectly, not too crisp, not too chewy, just perfect.  This is going to be my go to cookie recipe!

This recipe turned out amazing!  I only made one slight change by adding two teaspoons of vanilla bean paste in place of the vanilla extract.  The cookies held their shape perfectly without any refigeration of the dough.  The taste is superb as well!  I have made this my go-to sugar cookie recipe!

Very easy recipe that rolled out well. Cookies kept they're shape well in the oven, unlike some sugar cookie recipes I've used in the past. The only downside was I thought they were a little dry. They work well if you frost them, not so good if you just sugar the top.

Made these wonderful cookies for Christmas. After reading other reviews I reduced flour by 1/2 cup, using it to flour my hands as I worked the dough. I made no other changes and followed the recipe. Dough rolled easily and shapes did not spread while cooking. perfect texture, crisp tender cookies with delicate not too sweet flavor. My family loved them without frosting, so had to keep part of the batch unfrosted. So pleased with the results, thank you for sharing.

We have tried a variety of sugar cookie recipes and this recipe is my family's favorite.  My father in law requests these for every holiday (or whatever "celebratory" occasion he can come up with).   I always make the dough a couple of days ahead of time, separate into workable portions, wrap with plastic wrap, refrigerate half the recipe (and freeze the other half--this makes A LOT of cookies and I never know when my father in law will make his request) so that the texture is always easy enough for me and my daughters to work with as I pull the portions out of the fridge.

I found the dough too floury in consistency and taste. However, they were still pretty good with the addition of oats and dried cherries!

This recipe paired with my creamy white frosting is simply amazing.  The butter from the cookies balances out the shortening from the frosting recipe.  Simply amazing!

I have been making this recipe since before Christmas. My elderly mother loves them so I keep some on hand at all times. I divide the dough into 5 discs and place them in the freezer. I then cook as needed.

I used this recipe for my very first try at making sugar cookies.  The cookies turned out GREAT!  The dough seemed a little dry at first, but when I worked it with my hands and rolled it out, it was fine.  The cookies tasted great.  The texture was slightly crisp on the outside, and tender-soft on the inside.

Hmm. I ended up with way to much flour, I guess this must be by volume and not weight.

The dough didn't come together very well. But they do taste delicious. Everyone was eating them even without the icing!

This recipe is amazing. It tastes great and if easy to work with. It appears a bit dry, but it holds together, bakes well and then is not to fragile to handle and decorate. I read 100's of recipes looking for good tasting cookie the grandkids and I could decorate for Christmas. Some recipes  had both 5 stars and 1 star ratings, all for the same recipe??  I found that very confusing. Who was right and who was wrong? Then I found this one with only 5 stars and decided to try it. Today I add my 5 stars to the rating.

This is a great go-to recipe for sugar cookies.  The dough is easy to handle and doesn't require refrigeration before rolling and cutting.  The flavor is buttery and good.
