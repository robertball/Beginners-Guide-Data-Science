Honestly, I thought the rice to milk ratio was off but it worked out very nicely.  I used pearl rice (Aroborio rice would be great too).  Warning - cook this very slowly, stirring often to avoid scorching the milk / rice.   Stir while cooling.  I did add some vanilla and some powdered sugar to the whipped cream.   Everyone loved it.  This makes more than 4 servings because it is so rich.   An easy, yet special dessert to make ahead for entertaining.   Note:  Cinnamon would be a great addition and then serve with spiced apples instead of berries.
