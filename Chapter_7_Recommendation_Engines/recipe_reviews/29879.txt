I used Robbie's seasoning method and her spices, but I did it on the rotiserie. It was great! I have been looking for a simple way to season the hens and this is wonderfull!
Thanks Robbie.

I really enjoyed this recipe! Very simple and quick. Clean up is a snap as well. I will use this often when my daughter and I want a really good dinner and I am not in the mood to cook a huge meal!  Being it is so simple I can allow her to "help" with most of the steps (she is 9) and she feels like she has cooked a gourmet meal on her own! Great one- Thanks Robbie!

I enjoyed it but found it a bit too salty.  To make it again I would greately reduce the seasoning salt.

This is just too good to save for a holiday.....maybe a romantic dinner for 2.  You don't have a giant mess to clean up on this and the hens are deliciously seasoned.  I liked the fact it was a complete meal, I felt like I was in a fancy restaurant.  Thanks for this great recipe.

After reading the reviews I decided to go with just a pinch of salt in each of the cavities. I choose Pepperidge FarmÂ® brand stuffing, it was all that the store had, and I think that it would be much better with a homemade stuffing mix.  The green beans were way overcooked after 1 1/2 hour, we like ours a bit firmer, and I would either leave them out or go with another vegetable next time.  I loved that it was so easy to put together and that I didn't have to babysit it while it cooked. Thanks for sharing.

This was the second time using this recipe!    This time I used Bobby Flay's Mesa 16 Spice Poultry Rub. It's comfort food with easy clean up!    You can use any vegetable, but we like the green beans and the stuffing together. I also added a little chicken broth in the bag. No salt needed. The chicken is so moist and yummy!  Thanks for sharing!

Well let me start off with the fact that I used this recipe for when I was home for my father and I.  I added Chipotle Tobasco sauce to the exterior rub which was a tasty addition.  In general, best Cornish Game Hen that me and my father had had for a long time.  total win.
