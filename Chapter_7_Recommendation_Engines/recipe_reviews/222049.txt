This was pretty good, and simple to make. I didn't cook it as long as suggested, and I'm glad I didn't because it was done about 5 minutes early. I added some veggie beef crumbles with the rice to make it a vegetarian main dish. Next time, I think I will add some chopped parsley for freshness, and maybe a sprinkle of grated cheese on top. This would work well as a stuffing for peppers, I think. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this the other night to go with tacos. I was tempted to add things but I stuck with it and we really enjoyed it plus it was super simple to make! Thanks for the submission =)
