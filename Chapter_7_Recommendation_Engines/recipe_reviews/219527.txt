Made this and it turned out wonderfully. I added some things like roasted red peppers and served it up with rice.

Big hit with everyone in the family.  It's not too spicy and I used stir fry with noodles and it turned out great!

Really good meal.  I added a tiny bit of sesame oil and more soy sauce and we had it over rice.  I didn't bother chopping the peanuts and we thought it worked fine.
