It was a little dry. If you add the cream cheese to the mixture and some cheddar cheese and then put it into the wonton wrappers and fry them,they are much more tasty and moist.

I put this filling inside phyllo dough, rolled it up, brushed with a little melted butter, and baked at 350 for 11 minutes. (Next time I would go 13, or else spray them with PAM spray also to crisp them faster.) My apologies to the original poster as what I did with their filling no longer constitutes a wonton, but the filling is delish :-) I missed the flavor of blue cheese in these and would add that next time or else serve with blue cheese dressing to dip.

These are very good and not too difficult to make. They are a little time consuming, especially if you fold the wrappers "wonton style". I skipped the celery, since I have picky people in the house. One full tablespoon of filling is a LOT. I used 1/2 tablespoon and that was plenty. I was still able to fold the wontons without them bursting.

Fun recipe! Totally as described, these are tasty and manly finger food! Perfect appetizer for Fathers Day IMHO! I only changed one thing, I added 4 tbsp of cream cheese to the filling to make it creamy! Thanks for the recipe!

Scaled the recipe down to make 12 wontons...eating them now for lunch.  I think the flavor is good but they are a little on the dry side.  The only thing I did differently was add bleu cheese in place of the cheddar.  Next time I will try what the other reviewer said and add cream cheese to the mixture.

These were a hit! I did not have a deep fryer so I just fried them in oil on the stove top. For a healthy version I used Pam instead of oil.

Just had these for dinner and they were fabulous! I followed another users suggestion and added cream cheese and they turned out perfect! Also for desert we used the extra wonton wrappers and filled them with banana and caramel for desert which was a pleasant added bonus! :) great recipe!

Delish! I didn't read the directions very well before making these so I didn't cook the celery at all. I liked it this way though, it gave it a nice crunch. We served these with a avocado ranch dip.

YUMMY!  Super easy to make, just a little time consuming to wrap up in wonton.  Huge Hit!!  I made exactly to recipe and like them best that way!  - can be frozen... but I would recommend layering with wax paper or something because the wontons gets sticky and then you will end up with one big glob.

Fabulous!  I used a flavored sauce from one of our favorite wing chains (Quaker Steak & Lube, for any who know it - Louisiana Lickers flavor), and it gave it the perfect zing!  I also used a sour cream-based ranch dip as a compliment to the wontons (since ranch is a common dip for buffalo wings), and it was fantastic!  Will definitely make these again.

These were great, Definitely a recipe to keep, even my 2 year old who does not always like spicy foods loved these.  And I will be sharing this recipe with friends and relatives.

Made these for Sunday Funday Football and before I even finished plating them, they were gone. I will absolutely make these again â€” bc they demanded it. I used twi rotisserie chicken breasts and a big can of canned chicken. They. Were. Delicious.

These were great!  Definitely a make again :)   Only change I did was half Tabasco and half Siracha.  The next time I would fold them like a wonton (made them like ravioli).  Thank you for sharing
