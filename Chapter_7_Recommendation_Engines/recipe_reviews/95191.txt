I love persimmon pudding and have been eating it since I was a little shaver. Whether that makes me a conisuer or not I don't know but this is the best I have ever made. Also took some to where I bank and the girls there said it was the best they had ever had. Only thing I might change is mixing  half the sauce-I think that would be perfect.

This pudding is dense and sweet, and the persimmons provide more of a light floral perfume than a distinct flavor. We really enjoyed it. This was the first taste of persimmons for most of us.

Wonderful! Every Holiday we try at least 1 new recipe.  This was by far the biggest hit!  When my store got in Persimmons, everyone ask me what they were used for.  Of course I searched allrecipes and found this one to be most interesting. It really show cased the flavor of persimmons. The texture was perfect, the flavors unique. So easy to make.  Not sure about the sauce.  I used Wondra rather than all purpose flour and it turned out gel-like. (cooked too long?) We liked it anyway.  Nonnie's Persimmon Pudding will be on our menu from now on.  Thank you so much!

I will make this recipe again. It was easy to make and a great way to use the Hachiya persimmons we had that were getting mushy.

I used sweetened condensed milk instead of heavy cream cause I didn't have any. And while cutting the recipe in half I forgot to cut the amount of sweetened milk in half. OOPS... While the pudding came out good, it came out very sweet.  The topping was good, but even I'd followed the recipe exactly, I think I'd cut the topping in half.

This was a first for our family as we had never seen nor tasted a persimmon!  The recipe turned out well, but is too sweet for our taste.  I will serve it with a choice of toppings: real whipping cream or lemon curd.

Thanks to Grandmother Nonnie, that's all I can say.  It was delicious!  We thoroughly enjoyed eating it here in Portugal.

This recipe was perfect. I made two small changes - I substituted maple syrup for the honey and I substituted 1 cup of dark brown sugar for a cup of white sugar. It was delicious and everyone loved it. I made my semi-sweet whipped cream to top it off. I will make this again every holiday season. Thanks Nonnie for this recipe.

I make this dish every thanksgiving. This become part of our tradition. The only differences I substitute Splenda brown for the sugar and add molasses instead of honey. I've made it with both eating persimmons and cooking persimmons and it is a lot firmer with the cooking persimmons. I used to sub the buttermilk for nonfat milk. It is a lot better with the buttermilk and cream, as the recipe was written well!

If you are looking for a persimmon pudding recipe, this is the one.  I sometimes make it with the glaze and sometimes I leave the glaze off.  It is fabulous either way.

It was great. I had to make a batch and a half because power loss from ice storm. It was great. I did use the topping as it was and did not compensate for the extra and it was perfect. Yummy

I used gluten-free flour, and 1/4 c less sugar.   I also took the suggestion of others and only made half the sauce and agree itâ€™s not necessary but adds a little something. I served it warm with very lightly sweetened whipped cream.  For testing purposes only ?? I had another serving later when it was cool and can report its delicious cold also! Look forward to making it again.     (Note:  I pulped my persimmons by slicing soft fruits in half laterally, scooping pulp out of the skin with a tea spoon and briefly using an emersion hand held blender.)

Sickly sweet and it did not set. Rechecked all the ingredients and nothing was missed. Haven't given it another go as it was just too sweet to be enjoyable.
