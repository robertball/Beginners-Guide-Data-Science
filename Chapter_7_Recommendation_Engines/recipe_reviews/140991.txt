This recipe is perfect!  Really balanced the flavor of the snapper without overpowering.  Too subtle for any other meat, but great with a snapper or even a salmon.  The fennel is a GREAT addition to this stuffing.  When I was sauteing it made my whole kitchen smell wonderful!  If you can't find a fennel bulb in your supermarket (I couldn't) it's perfectly acceptable to use a teaspoon of fennel seeds and add a 1/2 cup additional parsley instead.  My only criticism is the time/temp for baking.  I put the oven on 300 and after 20 min the fish was barely warm!  After another 20 min on 350 I finally stuck it in the broiler for 10 min, and that was perfect.  You'll have to experiment with the temp to get it right, but I recommend finishing it off in the broiler so it crisps up nice.

Only okay.  It was very subtle, needed lots of salt, had to increase the cooking time from 20 to 25 minutes.  Not a keeper for me.

The fennel and onion inside was very good. Like other reviewers I had to cook the fish longer.

Delicious. Followed recipe with no changes. The fennel adds a great flavor to fish. I’ve made it now several times. You won’t be disappointed .
