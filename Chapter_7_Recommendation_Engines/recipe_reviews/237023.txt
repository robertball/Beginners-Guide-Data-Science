I made this cake because I had some coconut milk that was starting to sour.  We loved it!  I made a few changes to make it healthier. Cut sugar to 1 1/2 c. and used 1/2 Stevia and 1/2 regular sugar.  I substituted the butter with coconut oil. Be careful when softening because it won't take as long as butter. I substituted the all-purpose flour with coconut flour. This ratio is 1:4. For every cup of regular flour use 1/4 c coconut flour. I also added a 1/2 tsp of coconut extract.  Put this in a 9x13 pan, sprinkled with additional coconut and baked for the same 45 min. It turned out wonderful! So, I guess you could say I made a Coconut Coconut Coconut Coconut Milk Cake!

Just noticed that quite a few people have tried my recipe and was so excited that most of you enjoy it! =) I did notice that those who complained about it having too much baking soda - respectfully - read the directions. =) It's actually supposed to be Baking POWDER. I can imagine Baking Soda would be really gross! lol =)

Fantastic recipe! I made it in a Bundt pan out of preference and adjusted bake temp and time to 325 for 45 minutes. So moist and a lovely flavor! I also added a chocolate glaze (http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/8236/satiny-chocolate-glaze), which complemented the coconut flavor nicely. I'll be making this one again!

I was hesitant to use so much baking powder but followed the recipe anyway. I am glad that I did! I am making a vanilla browned butter glaze for this and will top with toasted coconut. I added 1 tsp vanilla to the batter for contrast.

I was trying out recipes from Brazil and I came across this one. After reading most of the reviews I decided to try it exactly as it is written. I would not change anything. The event I used it for had children, teens, and adults and they all love it! Highly recommend it. One thing; baking in the large pan took longer than the 45 minutes.

For the frosting I used a recipe that calls for 1-14oz can of condensed milk, 1/3 cup chocolate powder, sifted, 1/3 cup whole milk, 1 tbsp. unsalted butter, softened, pinch of salt, and 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract. Mix all the ingredients except the vanilla in a saucepan. Cook stirring constantly over medium-moderate heat until thickened. Remove from heat then mix in the vanilla extract. Let cool a bit, then frost cooled cake. 
The actual frosting recipe did not call for the pinch of salt or vanilla, but it needed something and those two balanced out the taste. I hope you all enjoy!

Friends said it was literally the best cake they had ever had and requested it for their birthdays.  I added 1/4 tsp coconut extract and increased the coconut to 1 1/4 cup to enhance the coconut flavor of the cake since I love that.  I made it in two 9" round pans and baked for 40 minutes, layered them with berry jam in the middle and coconut buttercream frosting on the outside.  The cake was moist and delicious. Yum!

Incredibly moist and delicious! I'd never made a coconut cake before and this one turned out spectacularly. I only had sweetened coconut, so I cut back on the sugar by 1/2 cup and it was spot on. I will definitely be making this cake again. I did have a lot of trouble getting the cake out of the pan, so next time I will also flour the pan.

From a previous review, I lowered the temp to 325 and cooked normal time. It was a bit brown on the bottom, next time will cook for 40 minutes. If you like the coconut, double it; I could barely taste the shreds. Used sweetened. To save time, I used jarred chocolate buttercream frosting. Brought this to a cooking meetup group, some were heading straight for it before the food!

Great taste and easy enough to make! Next time I would reduce the coconut milk from 1 can to 3/4 can as the batter was a little too runny. I reduced the baking powder to 1 tablespoon as per previous suggestions. I served this cake with dulce de leche on the side. Will definitely be making this again!

Wish I had gone with my gut and not put the amount of baking soda called for in this recipe. It was horribly bitter. And it needs more sugar. It was very moist so perhaps with a little tweaking it would come out better.

Love this cake!  Read the reviews that said it wasn't very sweet, so I added sweetened coconut instead of unsweetened.  I also added 2 tsp. vanilla.  This cake tastes perfect with no icing, but I decided to finish it off with a pineapple-mango jam glaze.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Thank you for sharing!!

This is one of the most delicious cakes I've ever had! I made a 6" 4 layer cake and everyone who was lucky enough to get a piece absolutely loved it! Will make again often! This cake is not too sweet. I paired it with vanilla bean swiss meringue buttercream frosting, a caramel drip,and some toaster coconut, and it was so so yummy! This recipe is perfect as is, I just added 1 tsp of vanilla as a personal preference.

I was out of butter so I used 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce instead. Once it was out of the oven I topped it with a chocolate ganache. It turned out amazing!

Made this recipe as written. Very moist and oh so good. Followed suggestion to put satiny chocolate glaze. Glaze is very good however I don’t think it added anything to the cake. And I’m a chelate lover. Next time I will not use the glaze.

Such a beautiful recipe. I halved the quantities to make little cupcakes. Made a buttercream frosting without vanilla and spread a bit of it on the top and rolled it in coconut. Excellent!

Made it the first time exactly as written. It was perfect! However, it sunk in the middle but that is my error not the recipe. 

Made it again today (three days later, the first one was that good!) and added an extra half cup flour for high altitude. The batter was more like a thick dough than a batter but still came out perfect and not sunk! Oh I also used coconut oil just to add that extra coconut flavor. 

So-as written with extra flour is the way I will make it. The coconut oil was good but for those who might like a milder coconut flavor stick with the butter. All in all a new favorite especially as the ingredients are ones I always have!

The first time I made this, I divided the batter among three 9-inch cake pans and frosted it into one of the best layer cakes I've ever made, and I'm known for making excellent cakes! The second time I used a glass 9x13 pan and by the time it was fully baked in the center, I'm sorry to say it was a little dry. I would recommend shallower, metal pans to avoid dryness.

Cut down on the sugar by 1/4 cup, since I only had sweetened coconut. Added a whole bag of the coconut, so probably doubled the amount. Could have cut back more on the sugar without sacrificing flavor. Added vanilla and almond extract. Made in 2 small bundt pans with plenty of batter to spare! Turned out exceptionally well and will definitely make again! Used dulce de leche piped over the top for frosting. Absolutely delicious. Could even add lime flavor to batter for a super tropical vibe.

Followed the recipe with the exception of adding 1 tsp of coconut extract. Baked in 3  9" wilton pans for 22 minutes. I filled the layers with lemon curd and iced it with butter cream, sprinkled with coconut. Of all the coconut recipes I have tried this was the best. Nice crumb, with lots of coconut flavor. Perfect.

This cake is very good and moist! As some other reviewers suggested I only put in half the amount of Baking Soda and it was fine.  I have to admit however that I did add a mashed banana and some walnuts because I had them on hand(and banana was getting too ripe;).  Anyway it turned out really good  with the Satiny chocolate glaze on it as well.  You don't need that but I wanted to take it into co-workers so I decided to add it.  They all loved it and want the recipe!  I think the main secret is the coconut milk.  Of course by adding the banana the coconut flavor was a bit lost but still delicious!  I also decided to make it in a bundt pan instead of 9x13 and really enjoy it in that form.

I love this recipe 
Substituted  half the butter with oil (4 to 3 ratio) and the egg whites didn't peak well with me but it turned out great!
Very moist and the coconut taste is very noticeable.

I made it with spelt flour and whole wheat and for the drizzle, I just heated up a store bought dark chocolate frosting, cut with a little water to thin it a bit. I got raves! And I had to send away leftovers so I wouldn't be tempted!

Great recipe. All I did was add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and a 1/2 teaspoon coconut extract. I  also whipped the egg whites in to  peaks.

Great recipe. Used sweetened grated coconut so reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. Baked in a 9x13 pan x approx. 45 ", middle rack of oven.
Did use coconut flavoring as didn't want to taste the 2 Tablespoons of Baking powder, and I didn't. Frosted with  1/2  recipe of cream cheese frosting folded into I/2 tub of cool whip.
Everyone loved it....even more flavorful the next day. Sprinkled few TBspoons grated coconut over top . Great with fresh fruit.

amazingly fluffy & light, but i think the amount of baking powder in it made it taste terrible.

Made as written, then added cream cheese frosting. Cake was very good the first day, but even better after sitting in the fridge overnight.

Excellent! 
I made exactly what the recipe says. It turned out very moist and very rich. I frosted it with whipped cream frosting and sprinkled toasted unsweetened desiccated coconut flakes on top (I meant to use unsweetened desiccated coconut because everything else was already sweet). 
If you want to frost it, I recommend whipped cream or butter cream frosting
There are a lot of recipes for those frostings on Allrecipes.com but I suggest that you replace vanilla with coconut essence to make the cake particularly coconuty.

I can't stop making this cake.  Everyone who tries it loves it.  We have coconuts in the backyard, and I make it all from scratch, so the prep time is a lot more than 15 minutes, but it is so worth it.  A beautiful, light, scrumptious cake.  Thanks!

oops I used mashed banana instead of shredded coconut that I don't have. And I made twice already. Thanks for the recipe
