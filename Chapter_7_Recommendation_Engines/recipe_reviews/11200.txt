Thank you!  This is the closest thing I've ever found to my grandmother's recipe.  She was German, though I don't know whether the recipe was or not, since she got a lot of recipes from friends over the years.  Instead of rolling out and cutting the dough, I rolled the dough into 3 dozen balls (not quite 1 inch diameter) and flattened them with my palm.  If you want the cookies crispy the whole way through (and you do!), bake them on a baking stone until the edges are lightly browned and leave them sit on the stone for a minute or two after you remove them from the oven.  These cookies made my day!

These were amazing!! A definite keeper....I made a few adjustments to accomodate my pantry and son's egg allery.

Used whole wheat flour
Reduced sugar to half cup
Replaced the egg with 1 tablespoon yogurt.
