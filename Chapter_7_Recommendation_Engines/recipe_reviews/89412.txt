Very good coleslaw - a perfect accompaniment to bbq dishes or fried chicken! I cut the recipe in half as this makes a lot. I changed the dressing up a bit though. I thought 1 cup of mayo was a bit much, so I used a mix of 1/4 cup of Hellman's lite mayo, 1/4 cup of lite Miracle whip, and 1/4 cup of reduced fat sour cream along with the buttermilk. I like a sweeter coleslaw of I upped the sugar to 1/4 cup. I also added 3/4 tsp. seasoned salt, 1/2 tsp. ground mustard, 1/4 tsp. celery salt vs. using celery seed plus the additional black pepper. I let this set in the fridge for a few hours and it was delicious!

Something to consider - to make buttermilk, you add a little bit of vinegar to regular milk.  So you could use milk and vinegar in place of the buttermilk. Voila!

After tasting I felt there was something missing and then I realized that it was the vinegar. In addition to adding the tang of the vinegar I also felt it required more seasonings. Good start tho and thanks!

This is the best coleslaw recipe I have ever had, includes any I have been served at restaurants. I would not change a thing in this recipe.
Thank you.

Something about this was just not right, the buttermilk flavour was too prevalent we ended up throwing most of it away, sorry it just wasn't for us.

I added dried cranberries and used   "Saco Cultured Buttermilk Blend for cooking and baking" to my milk. The dressing was very creamy and slightly sweet.  My guest suggested adding an apple (like Fuji) and pecans that I will try next time. Very yummy recipe.

Nice, basic, and easy recipe. A mandolin or food processor works great as freshly shredded  vegies are always better than bagged if you have the time.  I added a few tablespoons of non fat sour cream that I had leftover in the fridge.

If your buttermilk flavor is too strong, reduce the amount or try a different brand- some are less tangy than others.

This was pretty good. I do think that it may need just a pinch of salt in the dressing, though. Thanks for a great recipe.

This may be my favorite coleslaw recipe ever and I have tried LOTS of different recipes.  I did think that it needed a touch of salt.  Next time I will try adding caraway seed as I also like that in coleslaw.  Really good just as is, however!

This is an easy, no fuss way to have a side dish for picnics or BBQ entrees. I like the tangy-twist that the buttermilk provides... alot like the tangy flavor that one would get from cider vinegar. I like my coleslaw creamy, and this is a great method.

Delecious stuff. I used splenda (6 packs) as I am diabetic. Added a touch of dill weed and a grated carrot for color because I used a plain head of cabbage. Is a little on the sweet side for those who like it more sour add a couple drops of lemon juice or vinegar.

Great flavor!  My first attempt turned out quite soupy.  I reduced the mayo to 1 1/2 cups and the buttermilk to 2/3 cup.  Perfect!  I shredded one whole cabbage rather than using the packaged.  My husband loves it.

Great, easy recipe for deli style slaw.  Great with BBQ!  I made 1/2 recipe of the dressing and it was plenty for us.  Don't like salad of any kind swimming in dressing.  Great after sitting in refrigerator for several hours.  I will use this recipe again and again.

This is a really nice, basic coleslaw recipe.  The buttermilk dressing would be good on other salads, too.  I halved the recipe with no problem.  I also added the juice of a lemon and a cup of toasted sunflower seeds to the salad mix before dressing it.

I made a half recipe of this. Because I'm low on mayonnaise, I used half reduced fat mayonnaise/half reduced fat sour cream. I added a few personal touches (garlic powder, onion powder, chopped green onion). Quite good and GREAT as a quick side for our Take-Out Fake-Out Southern Dinner as we cannot afford our favorite take out chicken place. The leftovers for this are going on ham sandwiches for lunch tomorrow for the boys!

interesting that so many gave this such a high review.  To me it was WAY TOO MUCH for just 2 bags of cole slaw and really just tasted like mayo!  It would need quite a bit of tweaking for my taste...sorry.

Excellent dressing!!! I also add 1 small grated onion and a small amount of grated green pepper to this recipe.  Sometimes I substitute 1/2 pkg. cabbage slaw mix and 1/2 pkg. brocolli slaw mix.  Yummy!!!  Pattyklpn

Wow, this hasn't had a chance to sit yet but already I can tell it's fantastic.  I "eyeballed" the ingredients, used all listed in the official recipe but I'm pretty sure I used less of most than called for because I don't care for super wet salads/slaws plus also equals less fat & calories.  Less mayo, less buttermilk, less sugar, less celery seed to one 16 oz. bag of preshredded mix.  I added a couple tablespoons of minced red onion, a couple good pinches of sea salt, a pinch of cayenne pepper, lots of fresh ground black pepper (I bet white pepper would be great but I don't have it), large squeeze of juice from a lemon and large jigger of white wine vinegar.  I can hardly wait an hour to taste this again but will somehow keep myself away from the fridge!

The truth be told, neither Hubs nor I are big fans of coleslaw, and generally the only time we eat it is when we go out for a Wisconsin Friday Night Fish Fry.  I seldom make it either, but I know what I do and don’t like.  I like a creamy coleslaw, but will leave it on my plate if it’s sweet.  For me, and for those who don’t care for “sweet-savory,” this is a clean plate coleslaw.   (Note: I prepared the recipe as directed, only substituting Splenda for the sugar)

I made the recipe exactly as shown. The final flavor was a bit muddled. What was missing was acid. Added 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar, about 1/2 cup more sugar, a pinch of cayenne pepper (yes! do this!) and five drops of Tabasco brand red pepper sauce. Mix well into the slaw, allow to mellow several hours or overnight. I also added a small can of crushed pineapple, drained. Diced apples could be added, too. 

This made fantastic coleslaw worthy of your time! Super yummy, not cloyingly sweet, the cayenne and Tabasco give you a nice very subtle "brightness" to the flavor, not heat. Very Southern and delicious! 

I used "Duke's" mayonnaise and enjoyed the extra richness it seems to give recipes.

I just made this and although I know it will be better after sitting a bit, I am loving a big bowl now!  I substituted splenda for the sugar, and used milk with vinegar for the buttermilk.  I also shredded my veggies by hand, it tastes much fresher!!

Not your boring old, runny coleslaw. The only change I made was to use brown surgar instead of white sugar. It really enhances the flavor.

I was so worried after reading reviews it would be soupy SO I made the sauce 1st in its own bowl and slowly added to my 24 oz bag of slaw..... It was perfect!!!  I did as others suggested: used celery salt in lieu of seeds, added juice of 1 lemon and 2 caps of vinager!   YUMO

My family actually loved the end result, but I made significant enough changes can't really give it 5 stars.  I eyeballed amounts but the big difference was I used natural yogurt instead of buttermilk (added a bit of milk to the yogurt just to thin it down a bit) and probably used equal amounts of mayo/yogurt.  A bit less surgar, and a tablespoon or so of lemon juice.  Celery salt instead of seed and green onions.  Makes a lot o dressing but will keep.  End result was delish!

My wife tried this recipe and it was the worst.  She is an excellent cook and this has to be the first thing she's made in years I couldn't eat.

Would definately NOT recommend this, this isn't what coleslaw is supposed to taste like

i got all this coleslaw in my fridge and i cant eat it. it is missing something!! I cant put my finger on it because i have never made slaw before but eat it alot. It was just bland and now it sits with soppy juice in it. I will not make it again. I hate giving bad reviews but i wouldnt be truthful if i did otherwise.

This makes a nice creamy coleslaw that is not too tart.  I halved the recipe, and it made plenty.  I believe the "something missing" others have mentioned is salt, which is not required in the recipe.  Even though I added the suggested lemon juice and hot sauce, it still neeeded something.  Salt (or a salt substitute) makes the difference!

Made as written, this is a good solid recipe, just a little on the bland side.  But, when you read the submitters review and add the 1 TB of lemon juice and 1 TB of hot sauce it becomes a 5 star recipe.  This paired very well with 'Braised Corned Beef Brisket' 'Cream Cheese Colcannon' and 'Irresistible Irish Soda Bread' all AR recipes.

I made this with a few changes. I used only 1 C of mayo and I added about 1/4 C of white vinegar omitted the celery seed - a personal preference as I don't care for it and I added salt to taste. If I had had white pepper I would have used that instead of the black. I really liked it, I never thought of using buttermilk in coleslaw and it really gave it a delicious taste. I also think the longer this sits the better it will taste. Thanks for this easy yummy recipe.

EH... ok.  Mine came out VERY soupy, with not much flavor.  I added salt and lemon juice just to make it edible, and it still wasn't that great.  There are better recipes out there.

So good! I like my coleslaw a little creamier and less sweet. This was perfect! I made it to serve on pulled pork sandwiches (Lazy Man's Barbecued Pork Sandwiches from this site) and it was incredible! The whole family loved it!

Wow!! This is a great coleslaw recipe. My husband and I made this for a seafood feast that we cooked up and I think the coleslaw got more compliments than any of the expensive seafood that we had flown in. This will be our new coleslaw from now on! It is perfect just how it is and we did not change a thing!

I felt there was something missing here and I could not get it right-the first time I added more vinegar, the next time more sugar and some minced garlic and onion and it still needed "something". I am a coleslaw lover and this did not do it for me.

Very good slaw recipe! Only things I did different was no celery seed(not a big fan of it) and added maybe a tsp. of vinegar like others suggested, but really did not need it. Great way to use up some buttermilk I had from making dough for a cobbler recipe. This will most certainly be the recipe I use from now on for coleslaw!

This is a great recipe for slaw. My daughter-in=law and I like a sweeter dressing rather than a tart vinigar flavor and this fit the bill for us perfectly. I do agree there was too much dressing for the amount of cabbage.

Good base recipe to start off with. I added a tablespoon of minced garlic along with a dash of seasoning salt. I also agree that it needs vinegar. I added balsamic vinegar myself - it was a hit! My family never leaves any no matter how much I make!

This was definitely missing spice. My sister makes an amazing coleslaw and I know she adds a ton of celery seed. This is a good recipe it just needs to be tweeked to get the right taste.

YU-MMY!! This is so good, and very versitale. All of the suggestions by the reviewers could work. Great taste, and would even be great in a lower-fat version. A great summer favorite.

Great recipe.  Added your lemon juice & hot sauce suggestion.  Cut celery seed in half, thought it might be to much of a outstanding flavor.

I don't care for vinegar-based coleslaw, so this recipe was exactly what I was looking for.  I served it at a cook-out and the guests loved it.  It is simple, yet creamy and crunchy just like it should be.  Made as directed except added a little salt.

Normally I'm not a big coleslaw person but this recipe was great.  All of my guests enjoyed it.  I used half regular mayo half low fat and it still tasted good.

This was a great recipe.  We love macaroni salad but usually someone else makes it.  I served it one evening for the whole family and the next day our daughter had a luncheon and took this dish and everyone raved about there, too.

As written this is too bland for my family. We tend to like things spiced up. I added lemon juice, salt and a lot more pepper. I used just a bit of stevia for the sugar.

I simply loved it. I made other coleslaw dishes, and this is my favourite. However, I served it at BBQ's and people ate it, but not as much as other dishes.  Maybe coleslaw isn't a BBQ favourite?  It is to me, but apparently not everyone is a fan.

Absolutely great recipe. My family love it. I have made this recipe for family gatherings & friends, and I receive lots of complements. Now I was asked to make it for my sisters graduation party, & I plan to kick it up a notch with pineapple tidbits & a little bit of pineapple juice mixed in with the ingredients. I know it will come out great. I love how this recipe is creamy. This recipe is similar to this steak restaurant we go to that serves great tasting coleslaw with pineapple. Now everyone wants to know the recipe.

I make this as is with no substitutions.  It is an excellent side dish during my BBQs or seafood dinners.  It’s quick to make, also.  One hint is to make it at least an hour ahead of time.  This will allow everything to meld together and for the coleslaw to be chilled.  It makes it even extra tasty.

Great tangy flavor with the buttermilk.  I used Splenda instead of sugar and added golden raisins and diced apples. Yum!

This was really good. I liked the addition of the celery seed. I did think it was a bit sweet tho... next time I will decrease the sugar a bit. But it was excellent and very easy. I did not have buttermilk but did the 'vinegar and milk" substitution and it was great.

I cut this in half.  I use 1/2 cup mayo, 1/4 cup miracle whip, 1/4  cup sour cream. I increase the sugar to 3 TBS. I use celery salt instead of celery seed, and most importantly I add vinegar to taste.

I didnt have buttermilk so I had to substitute 1 C sour cream and also didnt have celery seed so did without. This was very delicious and creamy, then I added dried cranberries and it took it over the top! Made it with grandmas salmon patties also fr this site. Great recipe, thanks!

Good way to use up extra buttermilk. Definitely add more sugar than called for...and I recommend using all mayo, as written. I used some mayo, some sour cream and it just didn't work as well.

This was a good base coleslaw. I didn't think it was quite sweet enough. I added more sugar. I don't like it overly sweet but this wasn't enough. Otherwise it was great! I loved the consistancy of it and the buttermilk was great. Very creamy. Thanks for sharing. I will make this from now on only adding a bit more sugar and I might try some vinegar next time...who knows?

The taste was OK, but the texture was soupy. Maybe it was something I did, however, the dressing would not stay on the salad. Had plenty of leftovers the next day.

Pretty darn good! I have not let it sit yet, but the taste of the freshly made sauce is yummy. I added a dash of tabasco for a bit more zing. I will update once I taste it after it marinates for a few hours.

I was a little scared using buttermilk in a recipe that was going to serve 70 people for the first time. Needless to say it tasted wonderful, everyone loved it. I told no one there was buttermilk in it till after they ate. Yum Yum

I scaled this recipe down and it was delicious.  The buttermilk adds a great flavor.  This would be great on a fish taco or turkey reuben!  Yummy!

This was pretty tasty, but lacked some zip. I think next time I will add vinegar, maybe some cayenne, and cut back on the mayo. Thanks!

Entire family loved this coleslaw, and my son and husband generally don't like it....I doubled the salt and pepper, added some fresh minced garlic, dill, paprika and cayenne and omitted celery seed as I didn't have any. Was truly fantastic! Next time will add some hot sauce.

This wasn't bad, but needed something to make it a little more tart.  Will add a touch of vinegar next time.  Consistency was good.

Very delicious slaw.  A little heavy on the mayo.  Next time I'll cut the mayo back by half and add a little extra buttermilk.

I love this coleslaw. For me, no vinegar is what made me try it, I'd been looking for a no vinegar coleslaw and this is perfect.  My hubby likes a little hot sauce (on everything), so that's an easy addition for him.  I've made this to go with fried chicken, bbq, blt's, you name it. Thanks much for the recipe!

I've made this recipe many times.  It's easy, fast and goes great with ribs and pulled pork.  For some reason I thought it needed a little zig the last time I made it and added about a 1/4 cup, half cider and half distilled vinegar.  I liked it with added vinegar but I also liked it without.

Add 3 T. lemon juice, some cayenne, 1/2 c. minced sweet onion, and a bit of powdered garlic to make it more tangy, but that's just my taste. My favorite go-to coleslaw recipe now. I used a 3-pound bag of roughly cut coleslaw (as opposed to the very finely chopped kind) I bought from a large, national club store (Sam's) and the recipe was still very creamy and the slaw was well covered.

This is great coleslaw dressing for those who don't like a sweet dressing. I added about 1/4 cup rice vinegar for a little tang, and it turned out perfect. Many rave reviews.

I used real Mayonaise for this recipe and let it sit overnight.  Made as is, this recipe is a little bland for my taste.  However, when I added 1 tablespoon vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon salt, it gave it a little more "perk" and my family devoured it.  Even my 7 and 11 year olds declared called it "that yummy salad" and asked for seconds.  The four stars is for "as is".  A good starting point, but not a five star recipe.

Just made this. The only thing I did was cut it in half. This is the best coleslaw ever. I was going to add apple to it but it didn't need a thing. This is a beautifully simple recipe that tastes great. I didn't think it was too soupy or too dry. Seemed just right to me.

Didn't have buttermilk so I did the milk/vinegar thing and it added a little kick.  Also didn't have any celery seed so I can't say whether that added anything to the results or not.  Down here in northwest Georgia, we don't put sugar in our coleslaw (or cornbread for that matter) but the whole thing definitely tasted really good vs. plain ol' mayo and salt n' pepper like my mamma used to make.

Easy to prepare with a signature restaurant taste.  Added a little Crystal hot sauce for some zip and color.  Would definitely make this again.

I have never made coleslaw before but had an idea of the taste I was looking to achieve.  This was absolutely perfect and delicious!

WOW! This is now my go to coleslaw recipe!   Amazing flavor!  Added in the lemon juice but not the hot sauce and it is so good!  The buttermilk is such a great idea and added the perfect amount of zing!  So good!  So happy!  Thank you!

Loved it! The hotsauce kicked it up which is a favorite in my house. I didn't have celery seed so instead I sliced up some celery and it worked out great! This recipie is quick and easy which is a must in my kitchen.

I used powdered buttermilk. I didn't  have celery seed, so I used Dill seed that I briused in the mortar. I did add a hearty spoon of sea salt and a fine grated carrot to my own fresh cabbage. I used stevia in place of sugar. I added some white wine vinagar, too, in place of lemon juice.

Will make this again,the clan here loved it.

Just made this coleslaw recipe to go along with fried catfish.  Delicious!  I like the idea of adding a little hot sauce for some "zing" to the coleslaw and next time I will but it was excellent as is.  I cut the recipe in half for the 3 of us and there was plenty of dressing left over to make more tomorrow.  Thanks!

This is soooo YUMMY!!  by far, the best coleslaw I've had!  I didn't have celery seed, so I used celery salt.  After reading thru other reviews, some called for adding vinegar, I had cider vinegar on hand and added bout a tble spoon.  That added just the perfect zip it needed!  Will def make again!!  Thanks for sharing!!
