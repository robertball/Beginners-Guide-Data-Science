So yummy!  For Valentine's Day one year, I seperated half the whipped cream and mixed in some raspberry preserves to one half.  I used the raspberry portion to spread between the wafers to make the cake part. (Made 2 side by side logs instead of one long one) Then I covered the entire "cake" with the plain whipped cream and garnished with fresh raspberries and chocolate sprinkles on top.  It was quite a hit with my boyfriend.  I have also used strawberry preserves as well.

This was an incredibly easy dessert and is yummy too!  Be sure to make it ahead and chill; it gets better the longer it sits in the fridge and the cookies soak up the cream. If you make the log shape, it helps to cut on a sharp angle, the slices look much better.  Just before serving I added sliced strawberries and chocolate shavings.  A dusting of cocoa powder would be pretty too!

This is a 75 year old recipe that everyone loves.  You need Nabisco's Famous Chocolate Wafers for the cookie.r  They're sometimes hard to find, but I find that usually at least one of the food stores around me will stock this.  If desperate, you can order a box of 6 packages through Amazon.com.  Always make your own whipped cream (so easy to make).  We sometimes use food coloring for various holidays (ie. half red/half green stripes for xmas, pink for valentines day with sprinkles, etc.)  Leftovers are not as good the next day, which is due to the whipped cream.  I've always referred to this as "Icebox Cake".

My mom used to make this all the time.  Now that I am moved out I love to make this too because it is SOOO easy! I also like to make this at Christmas time I(potlucks etc).  and at Christmas I like to add peppermint extract to the whipped cream and then crush candy cane on top to make it extra festive!

I made this cake today for New Year's and everyone loved it.  I could not get fresh strawberries in the grocery store so I used blueberries, mango, pinapple, and grapes.  It was awsome with all the loaded on fruits.  I also drizzled some melted millk chocolate over top.  I only put it in the fidge for about 3 hours and it was purfect.  I wanted to put the fruit on right away since I would not have time when I served it.  It turned out great without putting it in the freezer first.  My kids all want it for birthday cakes this year.

I served this at a party. It was so good that no one believed it was as simple as chocolate wafers and whipped cream! The closest thing I could find to chocolate wafers in my area was the Oreo 100 calorie chocolate wafer thins and they worked very well. I didn't even thaw it out bf I served it. I just sliced it right out of the freezer and put the slices on a plate w fresh strawberries. I also drizzled some of that majic shell chocolate all over the cake bf i put it in the freezer. Yum yum so delicious! It tastes like cookies and cream cake. Will def make again and again!

SO delicious!!!  My whole family enjoyed this light & tasty treat!  I sprinkled some holiday sprinkles on it to make it festive and it was gone within minutes.  I didn't freeze this and used some homemade whipped cream and we all loved it.  I can't wait to make it again!

I've been making this for years and it is always a hit!  Very, very easy to make and always delicious!  Make sure you make ahead and freeze and cut on an angle like the directions say.  Taste great and looks like you spent a whole lot more time than you did.  :)

Love this recipe!  I had to use a different wafer as I could not find chocolate wafers anywhere in the city|(not kidding).  After tasting it, I can definitely feel the love!
Fantastic!  Thank you!

It was very tasty but really hard to cut through with a spoon once served.
