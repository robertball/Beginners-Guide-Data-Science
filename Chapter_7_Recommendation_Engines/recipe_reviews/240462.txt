Crazy good! I added celery for extra crunch. This would be great with chicken also:)

An interesting combinations of flavors going on here.  The peanuts add a nice crunch, the curry powder a subtle flavor, the jalapeno is little spice.  I would use some of the cream cheese an the tortilla itself to glue it together.  (or even some of the dressing)  This could easily be tweaked to individual tastes.  I would like some finely diced celery, maybe some tart green apple.
