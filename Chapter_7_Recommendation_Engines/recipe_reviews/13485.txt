These were SO GOOD and my guests loved them.  I didn't quite know what to expect but they were delicious and the look on everyone's face when I came out with a pumpkin on a plate was priceless.  It is a really nice fall recipe.

This is an easy, beautiful way to serve sugar pumpkins! However, I would add more sugar, and salt for flavor-- otherwise the pumpkin can be a bit bland. Also, cook time needs to be at least 45 minutes, or the flesh is too crunchy. I will definitely serve these at Thanksgiving insetad of our traditional butternut squash!

Mine were a undercooked so next time I'll leave them in the oven longer.  It wasn't very flavorful so we cooked some cinnimon apples and put them inside the pumpkin, it was so much better!

Very yummy! this was a side dish tonight. Everyone loved it. I cut the pumpkins open with a pumpkin carving tool (halloween). I use it for most of my squash, easy to use. I used less cinnamon (eyed it) and a pinch of nutmeg. I will make this again soon. This will be a family fall favorite. Thanks for posting. I left the pumpkins in the oven over an hour just because I wasn't ready for them....they turned out perfect.

I made five of these, stuffed them with apple-chicken curry and served them on a bed of rice with a long sprig of flat parsley around the stem. They were a huge hit. No one missed my next dinner party!

I LOVED this idea. I love everything pumpkin, so baking pumpkins was really exciting. I don't know if I had the wrong kind of pumpkin or not, though, because it took me forever to finally saw the top off and, when I took them out of the oven, there was a puddle of cinnamon sugary butterwater in the center of the pumpkin. But I just mixed that in when I was eating it. Is that normal? I thought they were tasty and, after baking for an hour/hour and a half, perfectly tender. Thank you so much for this idea!
