Made as written except that I didn't use any lettuce because mine had gone bad. These were excellent! The marinade really comes through. The one thing I will change when I make this again is that I will use a little bit of oil to cook the veggies in instead of the spray. I didn't get that deep char that I like using the spray. Overall great recipe and one I will definitely make again.

Unfortunately, we were not a fan of this recipe. 3 Tbsp of chili powder is quite a bit. The flavor was slightly bitter and the shrimp almost seemed to have a paste on them from the large amount of chili powder.  I would use this recipe again, but, decrease the amount of chili powder.

Yes! I would definitely make again. Two minor substitutions: olive oil  to cook veggies instead of spray and used jalapeños instead of chille peppers. Ingredients are all  fresh and perfect toppings. Chopping everything  takes time so it’s not the quickest meal unless prior prepped. But all worth every second!

I did not have lettuce, sour cream or cheese, . . . Did not notice until i mixed the marinade with the shrimp. It was still very very flavorful and I will be making this soon with the full ingredients.

This was a big hit in my family. My Mom thought it was too spicey but my son and Dad thought it was perfect. I used the same recipe on chicken with less chili pepper and it was awesome. I used 2 pounds of small shrimp instead of 1 as my family LOVES shrimp. We served it over rice instead of tortillas.

Nice, relatively easy meal. It was rather spicy, even after I cut back on the chili powder, we have Penzey's medium hot, and used a jalapeno instead of the serrano. The peppers, onions and shrimp had a great texture. We'll make this again.

I did not use the lettuce but added corn kernels from one ear of corn.  I also only used 1/2 cup of cheese.

I made this and it was great! I used some different options for garnish on the fajitas but for the most part, it was true to the recipe. In the future I think I'd use 2 vs 3 TBSP of chilli powder.

Like this easy recipe.  I used about 2TBS chili powder which seemed plenty and still had a ton of flavor.  I prefer to use additional oil to cook the peppers and onion.

Fabulous! I made the shrimp per the recipe and added chorizo to the bell pepper and onion sauté. With margaritas this was better than a restaurant meal. Highly recommend!
