Always looking for different ways to fix chicken. Found this one with chicken and BBQ sauce as main ingredients. My husband, a very  picky eater, loved it.  Have now made it several times using whatever cheese Is on hand and adding more veggies to chicken mixture (onions, chopped spinach). Tonight I fixed it for my grandsons and they loved it too.  Served it with fruit saled, corn, and guacamole and chips on the side for a full meal.  A big hit with all..

Thanks for a simply and yummy recipe! I had to leave some things out (since I didn't have any parsley or tomatoes) and added some sauteed onions (since I love onions). I was short on tortillas, so I did a stack of three, spread a bit of chicken, etc., inside each layer, and cut them into wedges to serve. It all turned out just fine! I'll definitely make this again!

great way to use up leftover shredded chicken, mine baked in 8 minutes, used pepper jack cheese to add a little zing.

Something that makes it even more amazing is to swirl the bbq sauce with ranch dressing.  Sounds weird, but SO GOOD!  The tomato flavor doesn't fit quite as well though.

A great twist on the old chicken quesadilla. Great flavor from the barbecue sauce. Will definitely make these again. I used the spinach tortillas.

We really enjoyed this! Added saut√©ed onion and garlic and chopped roasted pepper and sun dried tomato paste rather than tomato.

I just got a can of corn and black beans and added it to the recipe. It was really good. I just didn't add tomatoes because I don't like them so I just added the corn and black beans.

Barbecued Chicken Quesadilla Haiku: "So simple to make. I used chicken I'd frozen, kept the rest the same." When split chicken breasts are on sale, I buy a bunch to boil, shred, portion out and freeze into shredded chicken and stock, so I used some of that chicken for this recipe, along w/ low carb spinach tortillas. I think I would've preferred cilantro to parsley, but I was still happy w/ the end result. Alot of this recipe's success really relies on using a good BBQ sauce as there are so many different kinds. (I'm partial to Sweet Baby Ray's.)

These were a big hit.  I had leftover BBQ chicken from another recipe and this was the perfect recipe to use it in!  Thanks for the recipe, belizza!

very yummy!  My kids and I enjoyed it and I especially loved them dipped in sour cream :)  I was unsure if we would like the outcome of a quesadilla done in the oven, but it was nice and crispy!  Thanks!

I thought these were tasty and simple.  Maybe throw some red onion in there because it is always good with BBQ chicken.  I had these with rice, guacamole and sour cream.
