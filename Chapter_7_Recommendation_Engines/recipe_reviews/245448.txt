This is one of those recipes where a person goes "What a great idea!" and then doesn't follow the recipe at all.  Nachos on tater tots instead of on chips.  It's an excellent idea and they turned out great!

Some would prefer ground beef over ground turkey.

This was a great use of oddball items: tater tots, turkey and avocado. I followed the recipe except for the olives, with good results. Might make next time I need to clear fridge items.
