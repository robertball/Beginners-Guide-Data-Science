Fantastic!! If a little cream cheese is good, more is better?  OH YEAH!  I doubled 
the cream cheese and it was wonderful.  Like a real easy cheesecake.  Thanks!

This is really excellent! I made it lowfat by using Egg Beaters in place of the eggs, lowfat cream cheese and 1/2 the butter. It turned out fabulous and the fat and calories were SIGNIFICANTLY reduced! Then I served it with whipped honey butter. Yummy!!

i give it 5 stars because it tasted reeeeeeal good! :) i have no idea what i did wrong though. i did as the directions said. i watched the pancake puff up in the oven and as soon i opened the oven door, when it was finished, it deflated. it looked like a giant crater. really cute, but not what i was hoping for. now that i think about it... i did get a little excited with the honey. i'll take note of that next time... which there will be!! thank you! i put melted butter and powedered sugar on top! it was very very yummy!

I didn't' know what to expect, ( had way to many eggs in the fridge).  We enjoyed it for lunch with a sprinkle of powdered sugar, and the second time I remembered we had strawberry syrup.  Kids LOVED it.  With whip/strawberries, would be amazing.
Wasn't pretty though, I used a pie plate, and it overflowed, and the top cracked quite a bit.  Yummy though.  :)

This was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, but needed to bake mine for about 30 minutes.  I topped it with powdered sugar and then served maple syrup and blueberry pie filling on the side.  My guests loved this.

5- stars all around.  I've never eaten anything like this before.  It's kind of like a breakfast cheesecake.  This dish can be very elegant or very everyday.  Like the contributor suggested "The toppings make all the difference."

Consensus: Good and pretty for a brunch buffet.  However, it tastes like a really eggy French Toast.  The teen boy in the family really liked it, everyone else thought it was good, but not interested in having again.  It does deserve bonus points for being really easy to make!

very blank slate so you can customize this however you like. I was hoping to taste the honey or cream cheese more than you do.  Essentially what you have here is somewhere between a popover and french toast.  Its not at all bad, but its certainly not what I would call a pancake.

I love this recipe.  I make it with 6 ounces cream cheese and have topped it with a bluebarry sauce once and a caramel sauce another two times.  Each time it gets better!

Made this for breakfast, and it was quite nice, a bit too sweet though. I only used half of the recipe and 2 eggs (and a smaller pan), and used mixer instead of a blender.

Very good.  Quick and easy to make.  I had to wait for the oven to heat up.  I would have thought it would have been more fluffy since it is a "puff."  Was very dense but yummy.  We love cinnamon and vanilla in our breakfast foods.  I added 2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla. I had very little leftovers which heat up nicely in the microwave.  Served with cinnamon sugar or blueberry pie filling and whipped cream.  Tons of possibilities!

Delicious!  I did not have honey so I substituted sweet sorghum, if I do this again I'll add vanilla extract for a sweeter flavor.

This recipe was not what I expected at all.  It was not so much a "pancake" or a "puff".  It was more like a cross between a cheesecake and an omlette.  It had an odd texture.  I won't be making it again.

Like the others I found this recipe had really no flavour.  I put lots of vanilla in there and it still didn't really do anything.  Maybe adding a couple of tablespoons of sugar to the batter would help.  
I also found it rose but didn't fully cook in the middle.  Maybe its just my oven.
Anyway...if you do make this I cut back on the cleanup by using my hand blender (boat motor) instead of a regular blender/food processor.  
I think maybe the recipe just needs to be tweaked a little bit.

The taste wasn't bad, but this came out too dense for me even though it did puff up. I tried adding 1 tsp. of vanilla and putting powdered sugar on top with maple syrup, but it still wasn't quite sweet enough. I think more cream cheese (double?)and maybe less eggs would be a good modification.

this was interesting. It had the consistency of a cheesecake but the taste of a pancake. It throws off your tastebuds when you expect the sweetness of a cheesecake though.
Still, a very good pancake

Hello! To healthify things: I used whole wheat flour, tripled the amount of baking powder (this was just to make the whole wheat fluffier), added 3 eggs instead of 6, and replaced butter with coconut oil. I added blueberries as well. The result  was..... well just a normal cake! I would give four stars, but seeing that I altered the recipe so much I went ahead a gave it five stars. I suggest using half as much butter/oil because my result was WAY too oily. :) Thanks for the recipe!

My family really enjoyed this. I used Egg Beaters and low fat cream cheese. I had to bake it for just over 30 minutes though to get it to cook all the way through, but that's okay. We will be having this again.

I would say it is ok. It taste too much likes eggs for me. The rest of the family ate it but it was not their favorite. More flavor would have been good.

This tasted really good and I will make it again, but it burned on the bottom of the pan.  The kids really liked it and my 4-year old asked if I would make it again.
