Scrumptious! I'm trying to wean my husband off white sugar and butter as much as possible, and this healthy version of his favorite cookie helps tremendously!

For the reviewers who tried this recipe and didn't have firm, chewy cookies: you have to bring the chocolate mixture to a ROLLING boil. When it still breaks bubbles on the surface even during stirring, then start the 1-minute countdown. I did that, and left the pot on the back burner (set to Warm) for a half hour while my hubby was grabbing oats from the store. The cookies came out perfectly.

Also, if you want your nice no-bakes a little on the naughty side, add a tablespoon of Nutella. ;) For those of you not used to the applesauce flavor, the Nutella helps mask the taste and add a touch of richness without a  ton of calories.

Very impressive! I wasn't sure how these would turn out. Very chocolate-y and the peanut butter is a great component. I used some crunchy peanut butter than I accidently purchased. I sifted some cinnamon on top. Would absolutely make this again!

I adjusted the recipe to make it heart and diabetic healthy. Used Truvia instead of sugar, Vanilla Almond Milk & no salt, also I used 4 cups of Quick Oats instead of 3 cups. Turned out great!!

Great recipe! I used soy milk as we are eating Whole Food Plant Based. I cooked it a full two minutes at a rolling boil on med-high heat (we're at at 5000 ft and need a little more boil time usually). They set up just fine. I might try 3 minutes next time as they were more gooey than the traditional cookie they're modified from. But it's a welcome compromise given the total absence of butter and dairy. Can't taste the applesauce at all, works well. They're pretty chocolatey, if that's not your jam maybe reduce the coco. This will be a staple in our home now, thank you for the delicious, healthier recipe!

Thank you xgainor for a healthier version of a favorite dessert. Like others mine did not firm up but that happens with the original version from time to time. I like that you don't use butter which cuts out a lot of saturated fat. Hubby said to keep this recipe so I will be making again!

I was excited to find these without butter! BUT they never set up, and I did wait until they were at a rolling boil and even cooked 2 minutes. They do taste good but now I'm trying to figure out what to do with the gooey piles now....

I think it's so delicious!! It was a bit too soft, but I kept it in the refrigerator overnight and it hardened a bit more.  Taste- wise it was great (even though I didn't put in vanilla).

Maybe I did something wrong, but it never got hard enough to take off the waxed paper. It was gummy. I even put it in the refridgerater hoping it would harden up, but it didn't.  I did it exact to the recipe.

As other reviewers noted, even when keeping the mixture at a ROLLING boil for over 2 minutes, the result was a gooey sticking mess. Like others, I tried later to freeze the cookies to see if that would help and it did not. Worse, however, were the comments from those who ate them who said it was like eating a mouthful of raw oats. Perhaps the recipe should be made with INSTANT oats which might work better.

I found the cookies to be too soft and wouldn't firm up even after refrigerating. They did have a nice chocolate taste and I like the fact that they were healthier.

I made them strictly by the recipe.  They are just delicious!  They stood up high and proud when I put them on the plastic cutting boards...(I donâ€™t use wax paper).  Will use this recipe from now on.

These are worth it only if you are trying to eat a healthier version of a no-bake; otherwise, go with the original recipe because the applesauce does give it a different taste.  For a healthy recipe, however, this is really good.
