I actually sauteed the raw broccoli with  the spices and the lid on, stirring occasionally for a few minutes. Then I added the cheese and brown sugar mixture. I stiired it in over the heat then turned off the heat and let it set with a lid on for 2 minutes. It was perfect. My husband loved it and he is not a big veggie eater. It doesn't need to be pre steamed.

This was pretty awesome. I tried the brown sugar and it was a little too sweet. So instead I created a mixture of a little sugar (a pinch) nutmeg and a pinch of cinnamon. It added the right amount of sweetness without being too sweet.

In both preparation and taste this couldn't have been better. The cooking technique was just what I needed for an uncertain supper time and since Hubs detests overcooked vegetables it ensured that wouldn't be an issue. I blanched the broccoli ahead of time and when I knew Hubs would be ready to eat it was no big deal to quickly do the last minute sauteeing. Don't hesitate to use the brown sugar - it's not enough to taste any sweetness but just enough to eliminate any possibility of broccoli bitterness. And in my (Italian) book anything that calls for fresh Parmesan cheese is always a plus. Flawless recipe and certainly one to keep in the reference file.

I have to agree with Emilysmom in that the technique was great. It was wonderful to steam the vegie first to get it to that wonderful green color and then give it the old ice bath. The brown sugar didn't sit well with me and wouldn't have been favored by my family either which is why I left it out. Everything else was superb and we all enjoyed it very much. Thank you!

Really good! I took other reviewers advice and just sauteed the broccoli and added all the ingredients while it was cooking. I needed more oil so I just added it as I went. The good thing about this recipe is that it's really easy to add more of what you like at the end; you can make it sweeter cheesier or more spicy! Even my 13 month old loved it!

I hate to say this but we didn't really enjoy this recipe. We're probably nuts (based on other reviews); but the brown sugar really didn't do anything for us...the cheese and red pepper flakes were nice though!

I made this last night for my husband who loves broccoli and he said it is the best he has had! I used a bit more red pepper flakes which was a great compliment to the sweetness of the brown sugar parmessian mixture! I will definitely make this again! Thanks for the recipe

This was a good recipe and I served it with basmati rice and Maple Teriyaki Salmon Barbeque (also from this site). The slight sweetness from the brown sugar complimented the salmon well (although I used about 1/2 tsp). I also added a pinch of cinnamon and put the parmesan mixture on the broccoli while still in the skillet for about one minute to melt the cheese.

I am rating this based purely on the technique because I seasoned according to my kids preference. I have been looking for a good way to cook broccoli based on the most delicious brocoli served at a popular chain resturaunt. This comes close--but is it just me or does this require an awful lot of dirty dishes to make one side dish???

Amazing. My 5 year old son looked and said "I don't like cooked broccoli" but I made him try a tiny piece. He ate all of the broccoli and then proclaimed that he wanted the same meal the next night because "IT IS SO GOOD AND I LOVE IT!" Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe's prep-instructions are the star! I usually just zap my brocc w/ a lemon wedge and butter in the microwave but this method produced restaurant quality texture and color -- really these WERE Brilliant Broccoli! My husband and I gushed (in b/t mouthfuls) over the bright green hue and the crunch that the broccoli retained even after we sauteed longer than the 1-2 min. the recipe called for. Only difference was that I shook on powdered Parm (I know I know it's no sub for grated fresh but it's all I had!) and scaled the red pepper back. It still had quite a kick to it so my toddler made a face when she put a "tree" in her mouth. I served this broccoli w/ 2 recipes from here as well which complimented it well -- "Algerian Carrots" and "Roasted Pork Chops with Tomatoes Mushrooms and Garlic Sauce." Thanks for a great recipe Doppio!

Super yummy. Adding 1 tsp of red pepper flakes is great for adults but too spicy for my 3-year old. The broccoli are cooked to perfection - not overcooked but just enough crisp.

Yum great flavor! Just steamed & then procced with recipe-mainly cause husband doesn't eat veggies when crisp. I skip the sugar too but plan to try it when not on diet.

Steamed and shocked the broccoli instead of quick-boil. I decided to add garlic in when the oil got warm; It was a great addition. Also skipped the brown sugar. It's a good thing when hubby clears all the broccoli from his plate!

Really liked this one though we didn't have the red pepper flakes (couldn't find where the bottle went!). Already bought a new bottle (think the baby got to the other one and it is long gone) and will try this again with it. As it was everyone ate their Broccoli!

I really liked the first two steps to boil the broccoli soak it in cold water and then dry it before sauteeing. It helps the broccoli retain its crunchiness. However I didn't like the red pepper flakes with it because it turned out too spicy. I don't know if it's because I added red chili flakes instead. The combo of red pepper (chili) flakes and Parmesan cheese didn't taste delish but the brown sugar was good.

these were okay to me they needed more brown sugar or cheese. the spiciness hits you more toward the back of the throat. not sure if I'd make this again.

Very nice simple recipe (even for simple can't cook anything me). I didn't have any of the red pepper flakes so I just used a bit of Creole Seasoning mix and also just used generic Parmesan cheese. Very good!!!

I am not a big broccoli fan but my husband likes it so I thought I'd give this recipe a try. I followed it exactly except for using Mrs. Dash instead of salt and it was wonderful. I steamed the broccoli for 2 minutes and then shocked them in ice water. I then sauteed them for about 8 minutes on med-hi and they turned our delicious. I will be making this recipe again and again. Thanks Doppio Sous!

I was reluctant to put brown sugar and parmesan cheese on broccoli but it was AMAZING. I really like this recipe and will use this again. It was a hit at dinner. I saw my boyfriend's eyes widen when he bit into the broccoli. Good sign. Thank you for posting this recipe.

There are several great things about this recipe. 1) It's easy. 2) The broccoli stays very green and fresh looking. 3) The spiciness of the red peppers. I omitted the brown sugar based on the reviews of others.

Very good easy enough to prepare but had too many steps for me. I omitted the water boil and went with steaming. Once done I removed the steamer insert drained and dried the pot and proceeded with the recipe using the same pot. I added oil and fresh garlic browned that then added the steamed broccoli cheese and seasoning. I skipped the sugar. Very good and would make again.

I liked how relatively easy this was to make and healthy it was. I used up a large head of broccoli. Only thing was it was a slight odd mix of flavors. It did seem to get better once it cooled though. I used 1/2 the amount of red pepper flakes and it still had quite a kick! If I made it again I might even try just 1/4 tsp. To cook it quicker I steamed the broccoli florets in about an inch of water covered in the microwave for about 8 minutes (I have a smaller microwave).

This was a wonderfully easy and healthy recipe! I made the recipe as written but proportioned down for 2 people. The broccoli was indeed brilliant green and crisp-tender. I was concerned about the brown sugar but it was barely noticeable perhaps because of the very small amount in the scaled down version. I have since used this method of cooking the broccoli for other recipes including salads and just plain broccoli with a little squirt of lemon as a side dish. It really makes a beautiful presentation on the plate.

We LOVE cooked broccoli but this just did not do it for us. The brown sugar was just weird with the parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes. Parboiling the broccoli and holding it until ready to cook is a great tip though.

We loved this dish. The only thing i did differently was cut right down on the red pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp and increased the cheese. I kept the brown sugar the same. For us it was the perfect blend of spicy cheesy and sweet. I will be making this a lot because broccoli is my least favourite vegetable buti loved this.

I have avoided broccoli my entire life. I cannot stand it when its cooked until limp and I do not like it uncooked because of the texture of the leaves. I was making this for my hubby and for some reason I decided to try it. I am 29 years old and just figured out I DO like broccoli. Thank you so much for this simple but delicious recipe.

This was very good. I have a tendancy to steam the heck out of my broccoli. I usually end up with leftovers. Not this time. They made all gone. I must say I was alittle nervous about the brown sugar. But it was o.k.. It gave it a nice taste. Next time I will add alittle less red pepper. To me that was abit too much heat for my brood.

I wanted to keep it vegan (parve) so i substituted Parmesan cheese with garlic powder. I also followed other reviews and did not blanch it i put the raw broccoli straight into the saute pan and left it covered for a few minutes. i wanted to give it a 4 on flavor it was good not amazing. the extra star is for how easy and simple this recipe is. will def make again!

I put all the seasonings in one of the microwavable steamer bags and it was great! Just a hint of flavor without being too overpowering

I was a little wary of the brown sugar (and absence of garlic) in this recipe but it was needless fretting. This is an outstanding side! I love that you can blanche ahead of time and simply saute season and serve in a matter of minutes. Most of my go to veggie sides include roasting so it's fantastic to have a new go to that doesn't involve juggling oven times/temps. I made no changes other than to eliminate the black pepper per personal preference. THANKS Doppio Sous for one of my new go to veggies sides!

This recipe easily gets 5 stars as written (it's very frustrating when people make a bunch of changes and give a recipe 5 stars). This was very easy and delicious. I would not be disappointed if I ordered it in a restaurant. The brown sugar and red pepper flakes were a fantastic balance of sweet and spicy. This is a keeper.

I just love the way this is prepared! The broccoli stays crisp-tender and the color is phenomenal. My children have bland taste buds so I leave out the pepper and sugar. Otherwise it's a family favorite!

Delicious! The reason I'm giving 4/5 is because it was a bit on the sweet side... but I think that was my fault adding too much brown sugar. Next time I'll cut back and it'll be super awesome.

Really good sauteed broccoli. Even my unhealthy family said this was good.. and ate it! which I was really surprised about. I thought I was gonna have to eat the majority by myself. I would have given 5 stars but I had to add salt and butter to it for more flavor. I was skeptic about the brown sugar but the parmesan/brown sugar mixture made the broccoli. I would suggest adding the parmesan mixture while the broccoli is on the heat. It made some of the cheese melty and stringy and yummy!

This was fabulous! I used frozen broccoli because that is always on hand and steamed it in the microwave before sauteing in the pan. Everyone asked me to make it again. My husband thought it would be too spicy for the 2-year-old but she ate it up.

OMG! Just finished eating this with the family and it was awsome! All of my children loved it to include my 14 mth old! I would definately reccomend this for anyone having problems getting your kids to eat vegetables. We only used colby jack cheese instead of parma because we don't care for it otherwise it was great! Will definately make again!

This was really great. We dislike overcooked veggies so the cooking method really worked well. I loved the bit of kick from the red pepper flakes and the cheese was a nice addition. We usually steam our broccoli and pour homemade cheese sauce (with pepper flakes) over it so this was somewhat reminiscent of that taste but much easier and I suspect a lot lighter in calories! Thanks for the recipe!

This truly is a winner and a keeper. I do recommend measuring out the red pepper flakes... I just kept shaking them on and fear I got too much as the broccoli was VERY spicy. But the color is fabulous and the recipe truly makes a delicious side dish.

This was very good...I didn't use the full amount of brown sugar but used a bit more Parm freshly grated of course. I also used a mixture of asparagus and broccoli and it was well-received by all. The bright color is a definite plus for making a dish you'd feel good about serving to anyone...in this case it was my husband and grown kids for Easter supper...no one MORE important in my book! Next time I make "plain" sautéed spinach I'm going to cook it with these seasonings...should be tasty!

This is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. We were so so tired of the same old steamed broccoli so I tried cooking it this way. We love it. The red pepper flakes against the brown sugar is a great combination. I have toddlers so I left the red pepper out of theirs.

I followed this recipe to the letter except for using only half the red pepper flakes. I served it at a family gathering and a couple of us liked it fine but most thought it was too spicy. Most people in our family don t like any spice at all so I guess that was to be expected! The main thing I m taking away from this recipe is the cooking method. The broccoli was very pretty and cooked fast.

This is some of the best broccoli I've ever eaten. I did add some chopped garlic cloves to the pan before adding the broccoli and I didn't use the entire parmesan/brown sugar mixture--I just sprinkled a bit on it. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Absolutely wonderful! Thanks for a great recipe!

I liked the flavor of this but it didn't stand out enough for me to probably make it again. I sauteed it in the pan but didn't boil it first and it turned out fine. I didn't want to dirty too many dishes. The recipe really didn't specify whether to use fresh or frozen broccoli so I used frozen. A lot of other reviewers claimed they didn't like the sugar in it but I have to admit that I couldn't even taste it there was so little in there.

I loved this! I didn't shock the broccoli because I was just cooking for myself so I just sauteed the broccoli in the oil. I also threw in some mushrooms I had on hand. I didn't have any parmesan cheese but it was fantastic even without it! But cheese can only make it better. I just dusted the veggies with the brown sugar when they were done cooking- AMAZING!!!

I have made this several times and it is always fantastic. The recipe is great just as written no changes need to be made for a wonderful side dish to serve at home or bring to a potluck or dinner party.

This was just ok. Nothing great about it. I wasn't real fond of the taste for some reason. Will probably just stick to plain old broccoli with butter next time.

I use this cooking technique often - makes your veggies look so pretty and hold their vibrant color. However we didn't care for the rest of this recipe much.

It was good as a side for some ribs. I made them ahead of time and then cooked them right before serving. Some ppl thought it was too hot. But I liked it.

This recipe actually makes me WANT to eat broccoli! The hot from the pepper flakes & the sweet from the brown sugar makes this broccoli taste incredible! Even my anti-vegetable boyfriend went back for seconds and praised this recipe! I did everything as written. The only small thing I added was a slight drizzle of balsamic vinegar glaze to it. That just added to the awesomeness! This is practically a weekly side dish now!

I just prepared this broccoli to serve with my Shepard's Pie which hasn't been accepted on this site yet. I paired this with my Pie because the sweet & spicy flavor really went well with it. My Pie has ketchup and mustard in the chicken mix which has a slightly sweet & spicy flavor itself. This broccoli was fantastic to ME yet the pre-teen daughters did NOT approve guess they didn't appreciate the sweet they said. Hrm still really good to me don't want to modify it so pft on them they eat buttered and salted broccoli with ease so that's what THEY'LL get.:P

Too spicy! I even cut back the red pepper flakes considerably to 1/2 a teaspoon. Pretty darn salty too even with the brown sugar to counter. Perhaps I did something wrong but I thought this one was gross. One last recommendation to the recipe though would be to toss lightly..... into the garbage!

Nice alternative to steamed broccoli. I followed the recipe as written. Fast & easy recipe with nice results. I served it with a main entrée of Sole in lemon wine sauce and this broccoli was gracious and gentle - yet flavorful accompaniment! I will be making this again & again - thanks!

I was a little leary of the brown sugar... but it really worked with the parm and made a unique and delicious coating on the brocolli. I did add a little butter (because it seemed "dry") and lemon juice at the end; used Nature's Seasons in lieu of salt & pepper; and my parm was the canned powder. I was home by myself using up the last of a little bit of frozen brocolli we had in the freezer. I liked it so much I wanted more and immediately went back to the kitchen and rummaged around in the freezer no more brocolli but found some lima beans and did them the same way! They were yummy too.

I didn't make the recipe so I was not going to rate it but the site wouldn't let me send this comment without selecting a rating. Sorry about that. You can achieve the same result i.e. keeping the broccoli green and crisp by microwaving the broccoli to the tenderness you want and immediately rinsing it in a colander with cold water. Allow it to drain in the colander and refrigerate until you are ready to use it. The recipe sounds like it's worth a try.

It was ok I ate it but I probably won't eat it again. I'm not sure what it was about it that I didn't like...the technique was ok but the flavors were just ok. Cheese is a good idea for broccoli though and I may try it in another way later.

I would give this 4.5 stars if I could. It really IS good! Just knocked off half a point because I had to use 3 dishes to make it...and I could have used a 4th if I served it at the table (I just had my family serve themselves from the frying pan on the stove!). Flavor is great. Was going to skip the sugar as we are cutting down on sugar but when I saw how little it was I used it. Added just a hint of sweet. Only used 1/4tsp of red pepper flakes.

This has become my "go to" recipe for broccoli. We love it and it's easy but tasty enough for company. To simplify things I steam the broccoli in the microwave until tender crisp and then toss it with one tablespoon of brown sugar one tablespoon of parmesan cheese one teaspoon of crushed red pepper and freshly ground sea salt and pepper minus the oil. Tastes wonderful saves on calories and because of the cheese everything adheres to the broccoli.

I didn't think that the ingredients blended at all - I could taste the individual flavors and they didn't support the broccoli. The red pepper flakes were completely overwhelming and I cut the amount in half to begin with. Why anyone still boils a fresh vegetable (and cooks it in advance) these days is beyond me - it's much too easy and fast to quickly saute or micro-steam instead and serve immediately.

I like broccoli anyway I can get it and I am always looking for new ways to try it. The red pepper flakes and parmesan were great additions. I was hesitant to add the brown sugar based on the reviews but I am glad I did. The slight sweetness perfectly balanced out the flavor of the broccoli.

We did not enjoy this recipe at all. The broccoli preparation was fine and I will use that with a garlic butter finish next time but the parmesan cheese/brown sugar part wasn't good and also didn't look very presentable. Thank goodness tried first for just my family.

We love broccoli here and we couldn't eat this! Made it again but didn't pre-cook broccoli didn't use pepper flakes didn't use brown sugar or parmesan cheese. I sauteed raw broccoli in olive oil until crisp tender added some salt pepper minced garlic and 1 - 2 Tablespoons of water put a lid on it and steamed 2-3 min until broccoli was tender. That's it! DELICIOUS!

I just made this and added more red pepper and the bf wanted more cheese. I'm wishing I HADN'T added the brown sugar or at least half of what the recipe says. I also put the broccoli back on the pan when I added the cheese. When I originally added the cheese brown sugar it clumped together in an unattractive manner so I choose to melt it all together.

"Brilliant" is an understatement. Toned down the brown sugar a bit but followed the recipe exactly and enjoyed the restaurant quality results. Really excellent easy to prepare and absolutely fantastic!

This is outstanding! I am testing recipes for this years Thanksgiving dinner and needed a vegetable which I could prepare both ahead of time without compromising the texture of the vegetables. I just made this and wish I made more! I am tempted to eat my husbands as he is not home from work yet:) I made this exactly as directed and will definitely be making this again as my family eats broccoli once or twice a week. Thank you for a great recipe! I would not change a thing!

I LOVE this recipe. I changed it up just a bit...Omit brown sugar. To red pepper flakes and olive oil add one clove garlic crushed. Didn't have cheese but still DELISH!!

I am a beginner in the kitchen and I LOVE this recipe. It was easy (a must for me) yet it tasted as if the preparation was far more complex than it was - so flavorful and lovely presentation.

This was a great recipe. I followed the recipe except I cut the amount of red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp. That was plenty spicy for us. Thanks for shariing!

I substituted honey for the brown sugar and sauteed with all ingredients. I'll use more red pepper flakes the next time. It was a nice change from my usual.

This is my new favorite way to cook broccoli! I did omit the brown sugar because I am trying to cut back on my sugar intake but it tasted awesome even without it. Definitely recommend this recipe if you're tired of the same old steamed broccoli like I was:-)

Excellent! I typically serve broccoli plain because that's how the kids liked eating it. Now that they are teens I wanted something more flavorful but light. This fits the bill. Thanks!

Absolutely a delicious way to cook broccoli! Very different from the traditional steaming method. Lots of flavour. However they need to be cooked on the stovetop for at least 5 minutes to completely warm them through!
