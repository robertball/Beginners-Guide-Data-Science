This is my first time making sloppy joes since no one in my family is a big fan. I added everything except the cloves since other reviewers seemed turned off by them and I only had whole cloves that required grinding up. However it tasted incomplete, and as a test I added in the cloves. Seriously, it sparked the concoction right up. They add something and should not be omitted.

I have made many recipes from this site, but until now I have never rated nor reviewed one. I felt I just had to rate and review Grandma's Sloppy Joes because of the mixed feelings of other reviewers regarding the sweetness of the recipe.

I followed the recipe closely, substituting red bell pepper for green and adding only a 1/4 teaspoon of cloves instead of 1/2.
I found the recipe to be delicious, not overly sweet (these are Sloppy Joes after all) and the 1/4 teaspoon of cloves to be just the right amount. I do agree that 1/2 teaspoon would be overpowering (but we all have our own likes and dislikes).

Overall, a great recipe and a keeper. Thanks!

Sorry, we didn't enjoy this at all. I made it exactly as stated, but used a sprinkling of cloves, I can't imagine using more than that. It was very ketchupy and sweet. Very thick so I tried to thin down with a bit of water. It just tasted like eating hamburg with ketchup. I'll stick to my mom in laws recipe: 1 pound hamburg browned and drained, one large can tomato puree, 1 tablespoon brown sugar, salt and pepper to taste, garlic salt, 2 tablespoons prepared mustard and 1/2 package of taco seasoning or chili powder. It's really good. Sorry about the review, I hate giving low scores and everyones tastes are different but maybe I can help someone whos tastes are similar to mine and prevent wasting money on something they may not like.

This was a very rich and delicious sloppy joe recipe.  I used half bbq sauce and half ketchup like some other reviewers.  I also put a slice of monterey jack cheese on the sandwich and it was great!  I was scared off of the cloves by some of the reviews I read, so I only used 1/3 the amount of cloves.  But I really loved the smell and flavor the cloves imparted, so next time I will try the full amount.  One more thing - I found it a little salty, but this may be because I scaled the recipe to 6 servings.  I don't think you need extra salt if you increase the servings.

Yum!  I was looking for a quick recipe at the last minute and this came through with flying colors.  Love it and best of all my husband said the sandwich was delish!  So much better than from a can.  And I was a little leery of the ground cloves, but I agree that it enhances the taste.  Thanks,

This recipe was good- classic sloppy joes. I was afraid to add a half tsp of cloves so only added 1/4- but didn't need to worry as the cloves couldn't be tasted at all. Will add the whole amount next time! Everybody in the family liked them.

While I liked ths recipe, I thought there was too much clove. I only put in a 1/4 tsp. like other readers did, but next time I'll put in an 1/8. I also added some petite diced tomatoes, with the juice drained.

We all thought this had way too much of a ketchup flavor.  All these ingredients are in a typical meatloaf topping (minus cloves) and was definitely missing something - maybe bbq sauce, molasses or some spice??  I did like the clove (used 1/4tsp) but no one else did.  We'll make another recipe.

We just had these for supper!!  This recipe is AMAZING!!  I doubled it, and only put in as much cloves as I knew my family would enjoy. That is what is nice about this recipe, you can modify it to your tastes!

I tried this recipe and it just wasn't to my liking.  The Cloves was so powerful and the onion and bell pepper was just too much.

I made this with ground turkey, I loved how it easy it was. I added garlic because I was short on onion, and left out the cloves since I have none. I also went easy on the green pepper as my husband doesn't love them. I think the small amount I used was perfect.

I hadn't had sloppy joes in about 30 years, but heard a report that my 2-year old liked them. Unfortunately he's fickle and didn't touch it, but my husband and I thought it was pretty good.

I might try all spice and maybe leave out the sugar next time.

I agree that the cloves were a bit over bearing.  My hubby said that it was too bar-b-q-iey.  My kids loved it though.  Want me to keep making it and never use manwich or other premix again.  I will reduce the cloves next time and try to make hubby happy.

This is an excellent recipe!!! Everyone loved it.  I used half ketchup and half barbque sauce and did not add the brown sugar.  It came out excellent, just the right balance of sweet and spicy.  Next time, I might add a little more spice with some chipotle peppers.  Excellent recipe!!

Very good sloppy joe recipe - just like I remember from my childhood.  I did modify a bit based on what I had on hand - used red onion (half cup), added one stalk chopped celery, instead of all ketchup, used a can of tomato paste and the rest ketchup to make a full cup, used spicy dijon in place of regular mustard, added a few dashes of worsteschire, a clove of chopped garlic, and used half allspice and half cloves.  Very tasty!

I never had sloppy Joes before... Everybody was talking about it and once my hubby mentioned that he really misses it (he has been living in Europe for over 8 years now) i thought i would just give it a try. 
I gotta be honest i was skeptical at first. Specially after reading about gloves and brown sugar mixes with meat??? lol well on the end I'm the one that wants this at least once a week. 
I love everything about this recipe, but i put in more green peppers since my kids love them so much... 
Awesome recipe and i wouldn't wanna miss the gloves in the dish.

I was always a fan of sloppy joes, but my husband wasn't. This recipe converted him, and now this is a favorite on our table! He loves the cloves, and thinks that it is the special kick for him. 
I added Flax Seed Meal and Brewer's Yeast to help my lactation (I am breast feeding) and it was unnoticeable, great way to blend in extra needed nutrients.

I always use a can of tomato soup in my sloppy joe recipe. It adds sweetness and is not 'ketchupy' then. I did make it (minus cloves), but subsituted the soup for the full cup of ketchup and added only about 2 tbsp of ketchup.

If I had the option to rate this recipe a "minus" one star, I would rate it just that.  My husband and I both are open to new flavor combinations, but the overpowering taste of the cloves ruined this recipe.  All we could taste was clove with each bite.

This recipe is ridiculous.  I doubled the recipe, used ground turkey, for 1/3 of the ketchup I substituted bbq sause, and half the amount of cloves.  People were literally licking their plates.  It is absolutely delicious.

I was looking for a recipe similar to the one my MIL used to make.  I knew the basic ingredients but was unsure of the amounts used.  I did not put the cloves in and I used half ketchup and half Heinz Chili Sauce.  I think the chili sauce gives it a little more bite.  I also added a tsp. of worcestshire sauce.  It's a hit with the family!

I was all in the mood for sloppy joes tonight. When I came home I realized that I had left a bag of groceries in my wife's car that had the packet of sloppy joe mix and the tomato paste I normally use in it.  So I did a quick search on the internet and found this recipe.  I choose this recipe because I had the ingredients on hand, or close enough.  I was out of ketchup, so I had to improvise with a can of stewed tomatoes, of which I blended into a liquid.  I also only put 1/4 teaspoon of clove in, as I was intrigued but not entirely sold on this.  I also like to used ground pork instead of beef for my sloppy joes.      I have to say... WOW!  I don't think I will ever buy prepackaged sloppy joe mix again.  It's so simple and yet so good.

I tried these for dinner one night and they were excellent! They were EXACTLY how I remembered them when I was a kid. I loved the clove taste and I used the recommended amount. 
My only criticism was they were just a tad too sweet. But, I'm talking just a tad. Next time I will probably cut the brown sugar down a little bit.
My husband has never had Sloppy Joes as I guess they are an American thing. He didn't like them much but, he doesn't like anything that involves sweet meat. So, I'm not going to go by his review. 
I'm putting this in my recipe box for when he wants fish (which I hate) and I'll have the Sloppy Joes! 
Thanks for the great recipe!

This was great and very easy exactly as the recipe was written.  Way better than Manwich with minimal extra work.  I think I'll reduce the cloves (b/c I will make it again) just b/c that isn't my taste.  Grandma's always have the good recipes.

I gave this 5 stars but I just kind of used the recipe as a guide. I used the peppers and onions, 1/2c ketchup and 1/2c Bull's Eye BBQ Sauce (it gave it a strong BBQ flavor but it's my SO's favorite), 1tbsp distilled white vinegar, I chopped up garlic cloves (3 I think) and seasoned w/salt, pepper and garlic salt (we like a lot of garlic). We LOVED it!!!

This was really good.  I threw in a little frozen corn and some red kidney beans to make it extra nice.  I did not add the cloves becuase I used ground turkey and I didn't think it would go.  It was a perfect balance of sauce to meat.  Thanx

Absolutely delicious.  Followed the recipe completely and it was very tasty, quite fragrant and had a wonderful texture.   Everybody loved them.   I was a little leery about the cloves but added it as described and had no regrets.  This recipe is a new staple in our household.

Great flavor without being too sloppy!  Only change I made to the recipe from reading other reviews was to decrease spices to 1/4 t. ground cloves and 1/2 t. salt.  So easy and works well in a soft roll.

Pretty good.  I like it because its not as sweet as some of the others..  I just used a sprinkle of cloves and doubled the vinegar ratio to the brown sugar.  Good flavor.  Very easy with stuff you have on hand.

I normally just open a can of Manwich when I make sloppy joes. When I went to grab a can for tonight's dinner, I didn't have one so I tried this one....it's pretty yummy. I had to make it without the green pepper because I didn't have one but it was still good! Will definitely make again!

My 2nd attempt at making sloppy joes, and this recipe is a winner! yuuum! I never measure my ingredients, and doubt I put in a whole cup of ketchup. I added a small can of tomato paste and squirt some ketchup over the top. Cloves do this recipe wonders!!!!

This recipe was easy but we didn't care for the clove flavor. It was too sweet and not quite spicy enough. maybe instead of clove use some cayenne pepper...

I would add only 1/4 tsp. of cloves next time, it was not bad, just to my taste on the cloves.  It was a really good recipe. Will make again.

this was nicely different.  I agree too much clove but thats a simple fix, just use 1/4 instead.  From Dad who kinda likes sloppy Joes to the 7 yr. old princess they all gave it a thumbs up. Princess says it needs cheese and she was right, we used medium cheddar and was perfect.

We love this recipe in my house! I also used cinnamon instead of cloves, and we prefer tomato sauce to the sweetness of ketchup. If I have it I'll use spicy brown mustard instead of 'classic' yellow mustard. We usually have these with sweet potato fries on the side- so much better than anything you can get from the drive-thru! Thanks for sharing your grandmother's recipe.

I made these for a Holiday Pot Luck at work this week.  They were such a hit that there was none left.  They were very good, but a little too much tang.  I would cut back on the mustard used.  If you want to be a hit with a Pot Luck this is the recipe to use.

this is a seriously tasty recipe.  the only changes i make are that i've upped it to a pound and a half of ground beef (one pound is just not enough for my family of four - i guess they're pigs!) but also i substitute a small tin of both tomato paste and sauce for the ketchup.  i just can't put a cup of ketchup in anything!  but because of that, i upped both the brown sugar and vinegar to 3 Tbsp each.  definitely put in the cloves, they're key, but maybe only use 1/4 tsp if you think the half is too much.  i also leave out the green pepper but that's just cos i think green pepper is gross.  if you like it, of course leave it in.

I was excited to make this recipe after reading a few reviews and seeing that it got such a high rating. But I was really disappointed in the finished product. The cloves were WAY overpowering. If I make this recipe again, I'll skip the cloves all together, but even then I don't think the flavor will be what I'm looking for.

This is an excellent sloppy joe recipe. I made one change to the recipe that might sound a bit strange. It looked a little on the dry side so I added a couple of splashes of beer and it was AMAZING ! I otherwise made the recipe as was indicated. Thank you for my "go to" sloppy joe recipe for all time.

we just LOVED it!!!  kids went nuts cause there weren't any veggies and my hubby went nuts cause there was just SO much flavor!  i used ground turkey which can tend to leave recipes seem as if they're lacking, but with cider vinager, dijon mustard, and the cloves... OUTSTANDING!  it really was good enough for me to set up an account so i could review it!  either you like cloves or you don't...  for us, this was HANDS DOWN... AWESOME!

Very tasty!  I added a jalapeno pepper and a few cloves of garlic.  Will definitely make again!  I tasted it just after mixing the ingredients and thought the cloves were way too much, but after simmering it came together really nicely.

Loved it!! I did not add the cloves only b/c they are kind of expensive, so I just used our favorite seasonings. I don't usually measure my ingredients, but I think I was pretty close on most of them except I probably put 2 tbls of brown sugar, and I definately did not put 1 whole cup of ketchup in there! That sounded a bit much! I went ahead and let it simmer for 30 minutes and all of the flavors really blended together! It was so yummy! I ended up making another batch so we could have leftovers, and I made my homemade french fries to go with them! Thank you so much!!

I have probably made this a dozen time.  It seems to be a family favorite.  But this time I doubled the recipe and added allspice, cinnamon and a small amount of red pepper flakes.  I also added about 1/2 cup red wine. I served it on toasted potato buns with a small amount of Parmesan cheese.

This was amazing - tasty and easy - I'll never go for the canned stuff again.  The clove gave it a great flavor and it smelled awesome!  The only changes I made were to use apple cider vinegar and some hot pepper mustard rather than regular.  AAA+++

This is one of the best Sloppy Joe recipes that I have tried here.  At first I was a little worried of the cloves, so cut it in half and it gave a very pleasant taste. Next time I make this, will add a little more and see what we think of it.  Thanks for the recipe.  And will be making it again.

These were sweet, a little tangy, not really tomatoey or barbecuey, but just a little different with the clove flavor. I liked it okay, but not well enough to fix it again. I used 2 T. dried minced onion and 1/2 tsp. onion powder instead of mincing a fresh one. I didn't have green pepper so I tossed in a jar of pimento (diced sweet red peppers). I simmered this for 50 minutes and served on toasted buns. I tried both dill pickles and sweet pickles relish with this, but neither really seemed to go with the clove flavor, and I don't think coleslaw would have gone well either. Not bad, just not for me. My son ate his but did ask me to use my regular crockpot recipe next time. Thanks, I enjoyed trying Grandma's Sloppy Joe's.

I doubled the recipe and it was great! Dont let the amount of ketchup turn you off, your really just making a BBQ sauce of sorts and it does mellow after cooking dor 30 minutes. Nobody that ate it picked up on  the cloves either so USE THEM!
Though I will admit that I didnt have any green peppers on hand so I made this sans pepper

Added note. We do not add the sugar. Everyone likes it a lot more without. Beef or turley, this ones a winner!
 This is going right into my recipe box!

My kids and hubby LOVED it!  I minced the pepper and onion. The cloves MAKE this recipe--just don't over-measure. If you want plain ol' normal sloppy joes, buy the packet of mix from the store! If you are unsure of the cloves, take half aside and try it! We WILL make this again, however, we found it overly sweet and a bit salty, so we'll adjust that.  Also, there was liquid that didn't absorb well, even after second helpings were left to simmer. It wasn't grease from the meat, it was something added. Perhaps it was the vinegar, as I forgot the recipe note saying NOT to double it when doubling everything else. We didn't notice the mustard flavor. Looking forward to making this again.

My husband made these last night and they were very good. He didn't add cloves and we didn't have green pepper on hand and they turned out great!  Looking at the poor reviews many have given, I'm a little shocked because these taste, to me, really good!

I thought these were the best sloppy Joes I have ever had, I loved it!! I did not have any cloves so I added about 1 to 1 1/2 tsp of Worcestershire Sauce it added the clove flavor. It was even good reheated and I am not a big fan of leftovers.

Excellent recipe. Instead of cloves, I add a little garlic powder, along with a couple tablespoons of our favorite honey BBQ sauce. Very simple "classic" sloppy joes!

My children loved this one!  I doubled the recipe, but only used 1 T brown sugar.  I added a clove of minced garlic along with the onion.  I left out the green pepper as I had none.  I also doubled the vinegar before I read not to.  It was still great.  The cloves add a great taste.  Thanks.

Thanks for a simple and tasty recipe!  I knew I would love this, as I make a chili with cloves and other hyped up spices!  I only added about 1/2 tbsp vinegar, and added a 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I also added about 1/4 cup water to make this a little more "sloppy".  Served on fresh onion buns with pickles.  A winner!  Thanks so much for sharing.

These were fantastic! I doubled the recipe(we are five,two boys who can knock it down). I used 1/2 ground turkey, 1/2 gr chuck. Omitted the cloves. It was gobled up.Some leftovers but they were gone the next day. My sons love them, they beg to make them for dinner. One whips up a salad the other these.  Who could ask for more. THANK YOU GRANDMA!

Terrific and easy.  Added some worcheshire sauce, cajun seasoning and garlic powder.  Liked the little somethin' extra from the cloves, which I always put in my cabbage roll and porcupine meatball tomato sauces.

My husband and my two grandsons would not eat the sloppy joes and they usually love them. : ( they didn't  like the clove taste and I only put half the suggested amount. Other than that change  I followed the directions as written. I would make again without the clove.

My family loved this and I have some picky eaters!  I used a sweet red pepper since I didn't have a green one, and only used 1/4 tsp of the cloves, which made it perfect.  I only had about 3/4 of a cup of ketchup, and I think that was fine.  I used organic, which has WAY less sugar.  Anything sweeter would have been way too sweet for us.  We will definitely put this on the dinner rotation!

I'm picky about sloppy joes, but these were excellent! I used a pepper blend that I froze with peppers from our garden last summer. (Blend of green, banana, and jalepeno peppers) and skipped the cloves, since my husband's not a fan of the taste. 
We both thought these were really good and I'm saving the recipe!!!

This is one of the best sloppy joes we have ever had.  For us this recipes comes from the 4-H restaurant from our fair.  We like it with a little more chili powder  and with shredded sharp cheddar melted on top.  This is an A+++

WOW, at first I was not sure if I should add it to my recipe box, but one taste convinced me. The cloves definitely set it off; I did not measure exactly, just to taste and also added paprika, and chopped jalapeños, since we like it hot  :)

Excellent sloppy joe recipe!!! I have made these a few times now, but I feel even more compelled to rate this after last night's meal. I made these last night for dinner but realized I didn't have enough ketchup. I found "in-a-pinch ketchup" recipe on AR website and made that in place of the normal Heinz ketchup. Wow - the sloppy joes were delicious, and I will use that as my ketchup from now on when making these "gourmet" sloppy joes. I did add 2 cloves of garlic (for 2 lbs of beef). We had leftover sloppy joes, so I made sloppy joe paninis for lunch today. I caramelized onions and used pepper jack cheese - excellent flavor combo and turns ordinary sloppy joes into gourmet sloppy joes. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Good!  The mustard flavor was a little strong but the 2nd day it mellowed.  Next time I may reduce to 1 1/2 T instead.  Also reduced cloves to 1/4 t as others suggested.  I had really no liquid for the mixture to simmer in so I added about 2 T of water.

This was really yummy, I did add only the 1/4 tsp of cloves but did not actually taste them.  I used very lean ground beef and found this to be a quick different recipe to serve the guys in my house.  Added chips and raw veggies to the plate and they really went for it!  Thanks to grandma, and to you for posting it!

The ground cloves is what sets this recipe apart.  I use cloves (ground and whole) in a lot of my receipes and it you do not add too much, everyone will be asking what it is.  Adds just a hint of something that is not identifiable if you do not add too much, that is the secret.

Very good recipe. My whole family enjoyed it. I left out the cloves only because I didn't have any but added worchestershire sauce.  It was just the right consistency. We will definitely be making it again.

I made this exactly as stated (w/ the exception of using 1/4 tsp of cloves) and I tasted it after adding the salt. It did have a funky taste that might be why others are giving it such a low rating. But I gave it a good sprinkling of garlic powder and cumin and a couple shakes of Worcestershire sauce and it was great. So I gave it 4 starts b/c you do need to add some things to make it delicious.

I made these tonight for dinner for something quick and easy. The recipe was great even though it says to cook for 30 minutes I let it simmer maybe 15 max and it was cooked quickly. I also didn't have the cloves but I didn't feel like there was anything missing. I did add one thing to it and that was worchestershire sauce to the mix just a drizzle. I think that it just gave it a little something extra. I would recommend this recipe to anyway super fast and easy. My husband loved it!

Had there been less of a clove flavor, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT. I will do this again but this next go around I will use less ground cloves.  I smoked clove cigarette's before and it just reminded me of it too much.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! Its actually one the whole family enjoys! I cut the amount of mustard in half because the kids and hubby are not fond of it. I've made this with and without the bell peppers and its tasted wonderful both times. A definite keeper for my family, thanks again!

Well it was a good outline, I added a few things and changed it up a bit.  Instead of the pepper I put in 1/2 cup of chopped up Celery, a can of pork and beans, Tbsp Chili Powder, instead of Ketchup we used Tomatoe paste, I really liked the cloves in this recipe.

Really delicious. I added a clove of garlic and ommited the cloves, simply because I didn't have any. Next time I will add the cloves and maybe some red pepper flakes for some heat. Thanks for the recipe!

I liked this recipe but I would add the ground cloves to taste because it is a powerful yet great flavor but if you add what the recipe calls for you may not like it. I added more brown sugar to mine to make it sweeter! But all in all I love these sloppy joes!

This was a good recipe. I omitted the peppers and sprinkled minced garlic in instead of the cloves. It was very good but I'm giving this four stars because it was a little greasy. I think I will make this again.

LOVE this recipe!  I was hesitant in using this recipe because of some of the reviews.  I have to say people are TOTALLY wrong about the cloves.  They are a MUST HAVE!  I do agree that cloves are VERY STRONG and the amount you use should be cut in half.  YUM, YUM!!!  These sloppy joes remind me of the manwiches my mother used to make me as a child.

This was incredible! I tweaked it just  a bit. I doubled the recipe but only put a 1/4 cup of onions (my family are not huge onion eaters) I skipped the bell peppers. I added 2t garlic. I am not a fan of cloves in anything, so I used allspice and it added that perfect something. This is definitely a new fave!

Another reason you should always trust your Grandma!  Very good - took the advice and used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 BBQ sauce.  Added a good dash of ground cloves. Excellent - will use this from now on.  Thanks Grandma!

most of the family liked it.  i loved it, along with my oldest daughter.  it was a little sweet.  i did not use the clove because i didn't have it, but i did use advice from another person to use allspice.  i also did not have green pepers so i used red, orange and yellow pepers.  i will make again in the future.

My family ate it, but no one liked it.  My oldest daughter thought it tasted "wierd" and I'm thinking it was probably the cloves.  Not bad but just not to our taste.

This is the best Sloppy Joe recipe I've made that has such a short list of ingredients.  I was a little unsure of the cloves, so added just half of what was listed.  I liked the subtle flavor.

It was okay.  I have never made Sloppy Joes from scratch before but these ended up way too sweet for our taste.  I am going to have to tinker with the recipe next time I try and make them.

This is okay, but not great. The cloves are a bit much. Another reviewer posted a simpler version and I liked that so much more. I think the simplest way to make sloppy joes is just to brown a pound of beef and an onion, add tomato sauce or diluted paste, little brown sugar, little mustard and chili powder. I just taste after each addition until it is perfect.

The cloves made it inedible.  My kids spit it out and my husband (who eats anything) could barely eat it.  If I try this recipe again, it will be without the cloves.

I never made sloppy joes from scratch.  So, I decided to try this recipe.  I was a little nervous about using the cloves, but you know what, I turned out GREAT!  At first my family wasn't too sure if they liked it, but the more they ate the more they liked it.  My 6-year-old ate it all up.  That's a BIG plus in my book.  :D

This is a very fine recipe. I would not have thought to put cloves in a Sloppy Joe mix, but it's there.  I would go a bit lighter on the clove, or eliminate it.  It's not bad, but it can overpower if not moderated.

I love this recipe!  I didn't grow up eating sloppy joes, and so don't know about anything from a can--this is so easy to make, I wonder why a person would buy sloppy joes from a can?  Anyway, I made some alterations, in that I did half ground turkey and half tofu (which had been frozen, thawed, and then had all the liquid squeezed out and then crumbled).  It was EXCELLENT!  My husband, who will shy away from tofu whenever possible, knew this had tofu, and had TWO helpings!  I did thin the mix down, just a tad, with some broth that I happened to have in the fridge.

I love this basic recipe!  To make it easier, I sometimes just used the canned sloppy joe mix (manwich or the generic brand) and add everything in this recipe except the vinegar and ketchup.  I don't add cloves either - I like to save the expense.  I add a dash of worchestershire sauce too.  Excellent!  Thank you for the recipe!

I thought this tasted kind of weird. I did everything by the book except for the green pepper. It tasted too salty and strong, like I needed to add lots of water but couldn't. I think if I make this again, I will leave out the vinegar, 1/2 the mustard, 1/2 the ketchup and add a half cup of barbeque sauce. Oh, and 1/2 the cloves for sure and forget the salt.

I didn't like it, though my 4 year old ate it with no complaints. It felt like a recipe for heartburn with all that vinegar and ketchup ketchup ketchup, plus beef grease. (I'll admit I didn't pour it off until after simmering in the sauce for a while.) It might have been much better if it had used real tomatoes or tomato sauce or paste instead of all that KETCHUP!

I love this recipe! The cloves make for a very interesting and different flavor that my kids, husband and I all love. This is is now the recipe of choice on those nights where I don't have much time to cook dinner.

I thought this was a very good recipe. I only gave it a 4 star rating as I did have to add some more spices. I used ground turkey instead of beef. I also added about half a tablespoon of minced garlic and half a pkg. of sloppy joe seasoning. It was very good. The cloves gave it a very distinct taste. I liked it a lot. I will definately make this again! Thanks for sharing.

I was afraid, like another reviewer that this dish would taste like hamburger and ketchup, and when it was ready to eat, that's what it smelled like. But it tasted much different, and was delicious. It's a keeper!

Yummy. I threw in a splash of Famous Dave's bbq sauce and after cooking I threw the whole thing in the blender for a few secons to make it nice and sloppy, before putting on buns. And we put a little cheese on top too. Tasted great. There were no leftovers!

This recipe looked interesting - I always like to try different flavor combinations - and I followed it exactly. We both tasted it, and it went in the trash. It was too sweet and, although the flavor of the cloves came through, there was no depth or complexity to the whole - hubby described it as 'thin'.

This was a big hit with both the little people and the big ones. I used ground chicken instead of beef, used half red and half green pepper, and substituted a third a cup bar-b-que sauce for that amount of ketchup - all changes we enjoyed. Thanks for a winner!

Excellent!  This is the recipe I've been searching years for.  I tasted this at a girlfriend's sleepover many years ago and haven't had anything as good since, till now.  It must be the addition of cloves because it's great!!

This recipe was great!  My husband can tend to be picky and it's the same with our 3 boys... it's always hit and miss with them trying new things.  They loved these Sloppy Joes!  I used organic ketchup from Trader Joe's which isn't quite as sweet as what you buy in the store and they turned out great! I was worried about it being too sweet but they turned out very yum.  I was also a bit worried about the amount of cloves so I used a smaller portion to not be overpowering and it was just right...there was just a hint of that distict flavor.  This Sloppy Joe recipe will be a new regular at our house!  Thanks!

I have a recipe very similar to this. Rather than cloves I use a little allspice. I've also made this as is and added 1 can of tomato soup, then add to cooked elbow macaroni with 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese mixed in for a quick supper that my 3 boys LOVE.

An excellent recipe! We let it simmer longer than 30 minutes and it just kept getting thicker and better tasting. We served it on wheat hamburger buns with corn on the cob, carrot sticks and potato chips as sides. The sloppy joes were so good everyone had two each!

Thanks for this easy recipe and all the helpful reviews.  Cloves are a 'love' or 'hate' spice usually.  Taste and adjust as most reviewers have.  I used tomato sauce and sweetener instead of ketchup because of sugar content and omitted brown sugar.

Very easy to make, and smelled great in the kitchen. We omitted the peppers, because we aren't big fans of peppers. My husband and son thought that the clove flavor were too overwhelming even though I only added 1/2 tsp. Next time maybe I'll only add 1/4 tsp...because the flavor was good otherwise.

Awesome made with ground buffalo, I split the meat and made some for the kids without the green pepper.  To the "adult" pan I added mushroom as well as a bit more vinegar as we like that taste.  Our most finicky eater ate four small sloppies.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I started making this before I realized that I didn't have enough ketchup so I substituted 1/3 cup of barbeque sauce for the missing ketchup.  Then I realized I didn't have regular vinegar, so I had to use red wine vinegar.  My family absolutely LOVED this recipe!  I'd like to try it with regular vinegar, but I think I'll keep using a little bbq sauce with the ketchup.  Fantastic!!

Tasted great, but not quite worth the trouble to me.  For me, I'd rather just throw some canned sauce in with the meat.  But for those that enjoy making things from scratch this is the recipe for you.

I love this recipe and have made it many times.  I, too, reduce the amount of cloves in the recipe, but that's the only change I make.

Sloppy Joe's have never been one of my favorite foods, but I really did like this recipe.  I made it for a party and received many compliments.  I tripled the recipe but did decrease the onion, pepper, vinegar and clove measurements-which other reviews suggested.  I will make this again!

I followed the recipe precisely and didnt really care for the result. I was drawn to it because of the cloves but since there were several other recipes for sloppy joes, I'll try one of those next time.

This was very good and very easy to make. I thought the cloves added a nice flavor, but would probably do a little less next time. Definitely a keeper!

As a cook who loves rich flavors I rate this 5 stars especially because of the cloves. If it's too sweet for some Cooks try adding a cinnamon stick into your mixture which tamps down the sweetness a little bit. As a nurse who runs all day I seriously enjoy smelling and tasting this -- in our break room-- especially on a cold dreary day, when I finally get time to sit down for a meal. Great job on this recipe which brings a flavor party to my mouth!!

Made it per directions. We were not in love with the flavors. It might be the cloves or could just be the ketchup. It was alright but I'm still looking for a good Sloppy Joe recipe.

Used Manwich, powdered mixes, made my own so many decades ago!!!  Got a hankering for sloppy joes & this was excellent.  Used red bell pepper as didn't have green & tomato sauce instead of ketchup.  VERY GOOD & so easy!!!

I have made his recipe many times by now and am really happy with it!  I make it as written with one change, I only use 1/4 tsp. clove per pound of beef.  I make this for my large family with a wide variety of taste buds and everyone loves it, so it is an absolute winner for me!!

Tried; GOOD; I do not personally like the vinegar taste but, my hubby loves it. 
I will make again, but will alternate between this recipe and another that I prefer which is made with pickle relish.

GREAT Recipe. I have made this 4 or 5 times now basically following JENNCARLEN's directions. I like a little more spice, so a bit of black pepper and, when I'm in the mood, some red pepper for extra punch really does it. I tend to half the green pepper, but that's just a personal preference. The CLOVE is the key - what a great idea!

This recipe was pretty good, and I agree with a lot of other commenters, that the cloves really make this recipe stand out. This was a good weekend meal for us, but it takes quite a while to make so I don't know if I could make it during the week. By the time you chop the green pepper and onion, cook the ground been, and then combine all of the ingredients and let it simmer...yeah, that would be a late dinner for us. My husband, two year old, and I all really liked it, and my five year old thought it was just okay. I will probably make this again sometime. Thank you for the recipe, JENNCARLEN!

I made this. Don't be afraid of the cloves; just sprinkle a dash over the skillet. I used half the brown sugar; a small tin of paste instead of sauce, because that's what I have.No peppers either. Still good.

After I browned the hamb, onion and pepper, I threw it all in a crockpot with the remaining ingredients.  I didn't have any cloves,so omitted it.  I missed that part of not having to add more vinegar if doubling it.  I actually tripled the recipe and tripled the vinegar.  I still wanted it a bit more tang to it and added yet another tbls. of mustard.  YUMMY!!!

Loved this classic recipe a lot. It has a good, thick consistency and a wonderful tangy flavor. If you're not a fan of clove, I would suggest omitting it altogether. I personally feel that it is what makes this recipe sooo good!

Thank you Grandma! Very yummy and so very quick! Only minor adjustments from me. Only 1/2 c Ketchup & also add 1 can 10oz Tomato Puree (not tomato sauce). Just a 'dash' of cloves, salt & pepper to taste, and 2 cloves Garlic while sauteing the meat. I've used both ground Turkey and beef and they both work out great! I use Balsamic for the vinegar. I dash my burger with hot sauce to give mine an extra zip of spice! You need to try these...

I prepared this recipe without the cloves and the kids loved it. I like to put the sloppy joe's mixture in a bowl and eat it with corn chips....excellent! It's also great over corn bread. I'm a country girl, what can I say?

I make this recipe all the time, but I omit the cloves and the salt.  The cloves make it taste funny, and I just don't think you need the salt because of the amount of ketchup.  I like the fact that this recipe uses peppers and onions because I feel like it makes the joes more healthy.

Honestly, this recipe was only 'okay' for me and my family.  We found the clove flavor to be too strong.  Also, even after simmering for 30 minutes there was still a lot of liquid that would not cook down.  Maybe that was the vinegar?  I won't be making this again.

This is a big hit with my friends.  I've made it several times and also made it once for my small home church.  It's actually funny to see a lot of the guys coming back for 3rds and 4ths.  The recipe is sweet but you don't have to use so much sugar.  I make it exactly as stated and this quickly became a favorite sloppy joe recipe amoung 20+ of my friends.

mmmmm....just like the canned stuff with a couple of easy tweaks.  Skip the cloves, add a lil black pepper, tsp of chili powder, 1/2 tsp. of paprika, 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  YUM!  I lessened the salt and bumped up the brown sugar as well as adding an extra 1/2 lb of beef....but it's basically the same recipe, lol.

My husband and son really enjoyed eating these sloppy joes, although I wasn't a huge fan (kind of mustard-y for my taste).  We were out of green pepper, so I omitted that and the salt.  Next time I will try using half as much mustard and adding the green pepper.  This recipe makes an inexpensive, low-sodium alternative to Manwich.

Not bad.  I usually make a very easy sloppy joe recipe with chicken gumbo soup/ketchup and mustard.  However...I was out of the soup and decided to try something new.
This was a good recipe, just alittle too sweet to my families liking.  I cut WAY back on the amount of sugar. I would most likely delete it all together next time.  Half ketchup and half BBQ sauce was a good suggestion, as was adding garlic.  Alot of fuss for the end product,,,but never-the-less good if you like a sweeter Sloppy Joe.

I have pretty much the same recipe as this without the green pepper and cloves.  The cloves were a little too overwhelming for it.  I don't agree with the previous reviewer that Manwich is better.

This recipe was definitely not what I expected based on the reviews.  Generally I think Manwich produces a better product than this with much more ease.  I even tried using ¼ t. ground cloves, extra brown sugar and vinegar with no success at saving the dinner.

My boys are young and never had a sloppy joe.  This was their first try and they both really enjoyed them.  I followed the recipe to the letter and it was very tasty and easy to prepare.   This is a keeper.

This was very good with the exception of the ground cloves which I suggest decreasing to 1/4 tsp.

I've been dying to get my hands on some sloppy joes since grammar school(i'm 24 now), and this was pretty darn good.  I plan on making this again with a whole lot less clove next time.

i was so thankful to get this receipe.  the meat was browned, went for my can of mamwich and realized there wasn't one.  i didn't have the cloves either, or the time to simmer.  i could still taste the ketchup flavor, but i know thats because we didn't simmer.  will def. try again the right way.

I THOUGHT THESE WERE PRETTY GOOD....I DID CUT BACK ON THE CLOVES AND I DID NOT HAVE BROWN SUGAR SO I USED A LITTLE BIT OF MOLASSES.

This was just not for us.  I will use this recipe as a base, use 1/2 cup onion, 1/2 cup bell peppers, add 1 can of green chili peppers, and replace the cloves with garlic powder.
