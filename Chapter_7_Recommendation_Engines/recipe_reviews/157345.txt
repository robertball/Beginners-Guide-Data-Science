This was fantastic and simple. I made it exactly as stated as there were no other reviews to build on, and I'm very glad it worked out that way. I served this over a bed of egg noodles with fresh spinach.

This would be a great base for a chowder, but isn't good on pasta!  I would also remove the basil.

Very tasty. Used butter instead of olive oil and added 1 tsp minced garlic. Did not add the basil as I'm not a basil fan. Served over spaghetti noodles.

I was in a time crunch when I made this so I couldn't simmer it for a half hour but I added a little flour to thicken it up.  I really liked the flavor and served it over egg noodles.

I made this exactly as printed and used fresh basil and parsley from my garden.  We used it as a baked potato topping and the two of us ate all four servings at one meal.  I am now making it to serve at a wedding shower on a baked potato bar.  Delish!
