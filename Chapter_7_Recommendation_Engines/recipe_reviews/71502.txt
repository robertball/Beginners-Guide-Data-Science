Fantastically good- though I used 1 tablespoon butter per half pound patty instead, which I think cut down on the "greasiness" mentioned in another review. Also, these were the first burgers I made, and they were super easy and a big hit.

this burger was very meaty and filling, but the butter made it oily and a bit yukky. you could really taste the butter in this and the rosemary taste was a bit overpowering. nxt time ill make the burgers thinner so they arent as meaty, omit the butter and reduce the amount of rosemary

Juicy and tasty.  I told my family that we would experiment with different burgers this spring/summer. I thought I would start by avoiding the recipes with bread crumbs. This was the first one I tried. It was a big hit. The spices complement the meat and are not overpowering.  I made bigger burgers than the recipe called for to ensure that I could make them medium-rare as my family prefers.

Mmmmmmmmm mmm mmmm....very tasty and juicy ~ and very easy to make. I made 2 large burgers instead of the 4 smaller ones and topped them with pickles, cheese, and bacon (along with my special burger sauce). Great burgers BurqueBoi!

This was an amazing burger. We loved the hint of rosemary. So ono. I think this will be my burger recipe until my arteries plug up anyway :) The butter really adds some juiciness to the seemingly tasteless ground beef I find in the stores these days. I did lower the butter to about 1 teaspoon per 5 oz patty. Next time I will up the rosemary to about 1/4 teaspoon of dried leaves per burger. Thanks so much for sharing BURQUEBOI! You make a mean burger.

I liked the addition of rosemary. I added onion powder and left out the salt. I only used 1 tablespoon butter divided among 4 patties, and I wouldn't use it again. A nice change from our usual grill seasoning.

Sorry we did not care for this.  I was looking for a little something different to jazz up our burgers so used a lean meat to off set the fat content with using the butter.  It could be we just don't care for the taste of butter in our burgers.  And I do like butter vs. oil in a lot of dishes that I cook, just not our burgers.  I would rather use a higher ratio of fatty ground beef for flavor than butter.  I must say though that I will play around a little bit with the rosemary and some other spices to perk up our burgers a little more for flavor in the future.  Thanks for the post.

This one just wasn't for us. Think the butter and rosemary are better left on the potatoes.

I loved this recipe, and I didn't cut back on the butter, I didn't think I would even taste the butter, but you can! I did a little more garlic, and a pinch more salt, these were really tasty!

Mmmm. Nice flavor. I cut this down to 1 burger and wished I had made another for leftovers tomorrow. I could have doubled the rosemary though and been perfectly happy with that. I used garlic herb mayo on this and a slice of cheddar cheese. Thanks Burqueboi!

Very good basic burger.  Instead of butter, I always use egg because it leaves no taste and helps bind the meat.  I also do things a little bit differently when making patties.  First, I sprinkle the seasonings over a mound of meat that would make up one patty (I like to use fresh rosemary, but only a sprinkling for each patty).    Then I pinch out part of the meat, lightly dip the piece in egg and place the dipped piece on top of the patty.  Next I roll and work the meat into a patty shape so that the seasoning is evenly placed, not too heavy and not too light.  You can always salt and pepper later and cooking on a coal grill is a must for flavor!

I wouldn't know how to rate it. My dad was cooking it and I was instructing. He basically done it his way. He didn't grind up the rosemary because he didn't think that it needed to be grinded because of the amount that is needed. Instead of butter in the middle, my dad putted in cream cheese instead. Which was pretty good.

Next time when we make it, we'll follow by the instructions as said. Till then, I'll post a proper review and rating.

the end result was pretty good, but i think the butter just leaked out of the burger.. i made this on the stove top.. maybe i was supposed to make the burgers thicker? idk.. instead of just a pinch of salt and pepper i used 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp pepper.. i also cut the rosemary in half as others said it was a bit overpowering.. not sure if i'll be trying this again

instead of filling burger with butter, try mixing it in then forming patties! ;)
