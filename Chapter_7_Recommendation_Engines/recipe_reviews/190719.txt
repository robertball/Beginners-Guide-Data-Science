Yum!  Love this dish!  A very easy and great side dish.  One night I wanted to make this but was too lazy to come up with a main dish.  My solution was to add some browned ground turkey seasoned with some taco seasoning.  Since it was white hominy I had in the pantry, I added some frozen corn and wha-la!  Double Yum!

I love this dish and would give it 5 stars except for the fat and sodium content, but you can make it healthier by using a reduced fat and sodium cream of mushroom soup, and reduced fat Pepper Jack (admittedly hard to find), or 2% or part skim Mozarella cheese with some extra peppers added.

So good! The whole family loved it :) I did make it with mexican style shredded cheese instead of pepper jack to take down the spice cuz of my little one, but it was great! And so easy to make. A nice change from all the normal side dishes.

Outstanding sidedish! Halved the recipe for 2 of us except for the green chiles (used a 4 oz can) and halved everything else. Perfectly spicey and delicious!

I REALLY enjoyed this.  It was a nice change for a side dish.  The only thing that could make this 5 star would be the addition of some spice - we like heat!!  Maybe a can if drained rotel or a few jalapenos ???  I will make this again soon and will try one if the above to see what that does for it...  If you aren't a fan of spicy foods I bet you will enjoy this as written.

Was looking for something to use up some hominy and came across this.  I thought it was okay, a little plain.  Very easy and quick to make though.

Add some sliced Polish sausage to this dish....YUM!!   It not only seasons the hominy, It makes it more like a meal.

This was so easy and delicious. Had it for lunch but it would be good as a side dish or with eggs for breakfast. I used cheddar instead of pepperjack, and cut it down to a pound. Worked out perfect.
