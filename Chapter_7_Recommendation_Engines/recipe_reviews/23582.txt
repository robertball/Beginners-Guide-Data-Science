I learned a very valuable lesson when I made this.  Actually read the reviews.  It's just really disappointing when the reviews are so high but everyone adds things to make it better.  I made this exactly the way it was said and I was not pleased.

This is an great way to use leftover turkey! To speed things up, I used canned chicken broth.I also added some frozen mixed veggies and a dash of garlic powder for flavor. A+!!

This is the perfect comfort food!  I added some chopped carrots, onions, celery, garlic and herbs for more flavor, but I think it would have been good as written.  I've seen several recipes with biscuit dumplings and I was really skeptical about them, but they were really good!  Thanks for this easy and yummy recipe!

My husband said this was good and had a nice flavor, 4/5 stars. I cut it in half for an easy and quick supper for those nights when you need one. It went great with Carrots Augratin, available on this site. My son was expecting carrots, celery, in the turkey/gravy along with "home-made" drop-type dumplings like he's had before. Thanks Joan!

Wow!  What a great recipe for leftover turkey or chicken.  I used a 14oz can of Swanson's Seasoned Broth - Roasted Garlic and 1 cup + 4 tablespoons of water to make the 3 cups of liquid.  Added great flavor and you didn't need to cook it as long.  Also I used Pillbury Grands Biscuits.  Wow!

I gave this three stars because we did have to alter this recipe during preparation.  However, we really enjoyed the end result and will make this again.  I kept chicken broth handy to add to the pot as I noticed during the simmering process of the turkey that not much liquid was present and I feared I would not be able to add the dumplings.  Also, I used 1/2 water and 1/2 chicken broth to start (following the others advice).  Last, I followed the bisquick recipe for dumplings (mix and milk).  I love dumpling recipes, and this was a nice and easy favorite.

If you want more traditional dumplings with out the time spent mixing and rolling, use the pillsbury ready made pie crust.  You will find it with the biscuits.  The box has two crusts in it.  I immediatly open and unroll them while the chicken/turkey cooks in canned broth and water. while still cold spread a small amount of flour on the and slice into squares then drop once chicken is done and you have pulled it out and shredded.  add chicken back to pot once the dumplings have started cooking.

This was awesome! Also very Simple. I was tired of having the same ol' meat all the time so while at Wal-Mart I picked up in the meat Section Hormell Turkey with Gravy.. Added some chicken Both in place of some of the water and added a little bit of Gravy from the Turkey pack. I also added some Green Beans and Carrots It Turned out GREAT! This is a Keeper for sure! Thanks!

This was very good and very easy.  I did add garlic powder, onion powder and green peas.  I found that the key to the dumplings was not stir them and let them simmer for about 30 minutes to cook all the way through. I will make this again. Great way to use leftover turkey from the holidays.

Awesome! I used 3 celery stalks, 3 carrots, and 1lb turkey chopped and boiled. Then added the pillsbury biscuits torn apart and rolled in a little flour.

This recipe is great....after you add some other ingredients, that is why it gets three stars.  I boiled the turkey, 2 cups of water, a packet of turkey gravy and a can of cream of celery soup for 30 minutes.  Added the refrigerated biscuit dough and after 15 minutes added peas.  5 minutes later it was great!  My husband loved it and went for seconds!!

My whole family loved this! I did add a bag of frozen veggies and chicken broth. Also, I cooked the biscuits on top a lot longer than the recipe calls for (probably 30 minutes?) and I did not touch them til the very end (in which I flipped them over for the last 5 minutes or so.)

Just made this for supper, after adding some chicken bouillon, chopped onions,celery & carrots. Along with a little flour to thicken it up. It was very very good,I love how the canned biscuts made fabulously easy dumplings. My husband loved it as well.

FOrget the packaged refrigerated dough.  Use Bisquick for much better dumplings.  Also, I used chicken broth instead of water, much better tasting.  This recipe is not a very good one.

Very delicious! My husband is hard to please and we both liked it! The only thing I changed was using pork tenderloin instead of turkey simply because I don't like turkey. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is terrific, but as mentioned, requires modification. 

I added a teaspoon-and-a-half of chicken bouillon, celery, and garlic pepper to taste, using the saltiness of the bouillon to make up for seasoning. The dough came out just a little underdone at the low heat of my stove (yes, even for dumplings), but a quick zap in the microwave perked it right up. Cheating, but it worked in a pinch.

Thanks for the good eats! And for those reading this review, happy modding!

Yummy, tried this recipe using the rolled out pie crust.  Added carrots and celery, onion powder.  like you suggested.  Next time I won't stir the dumplings because they got mushy.  I will try the biscuit dough and add more turkey.  I will make this again.  Love reading all the reviews!!

Wow! I ended up making chicken dumplings with pre-cooked chicken, chicken stock & Grand's Buttermilk biscuits. I really thought that I was doing something wrong midway through--especially after reading the "my dumplings turned to mush" comment. But I decided to keep cooking the dumplings, and I think the reason they took a bit longer was because they were the buttermilk kind. I also actually ended up putting the dumplings in another LARGER pan. But cooking it a bit longer & putting it in large made the sauce thicker and the biscuits done! It was really great and I was really excited it turned out great!!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and it did not turn out well. My famiy did not like this recipe at all. I have made turkey and dumplings before but never used refrigerated dough until I found this recipe. I will not be making this recipe again.

Made the basic recipe, without the dumplings (don't need the carbs).  Used 4 cups of water and added 1/2 a red pepper (diced), garlic salt (instead of salt), 1 celery stick (diced), and 1 carrot (diced).  Turned out great.  Spiced my bowl it with Chalola.  Without the modifications, I think it would have been pretty plain.

This needs alot of help. I started with left over turkey. I used a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of celery. I added potatoes, carrots, chopped onion and herbs. Salt, pepper and a few herbs. I cooked it alll in pot on meduim until the veggies were done and then dropped in cut up squares of refrigerated biscuit dough. Cooked those for 4 minutes and it was all done. Quick and Delicious.

excellent!!!   Instead of water I used chicken broth,and instead of cutting dough I pulled each biscuit into 4 equal pieces and dropped into broth stirring occasionally.this also works well with chicken leg quarters.

AS written this is bland, and pasty. There sure must have been a lot of salt and pepper added if just using cooked turkey and boiling it down. And use bisquick dumplings recipe instead of the refridgerated ones, because the refridgerated ones are made more moist to extend shelf life.

I have a family of six, with 4 picky kids and a man who grew up on good southern cooking. It is so hard to find dishes that please everybody, but this did! I added 2 chicken bouillion cubes to the broth and it tasted awesome! Only problem...there wasn't enough! I'll have to double up next time!

This wasn't bad, it just wasn't the best. The 'noodles' were too soft, and made the mixture a little to thick for my taste

Very good! I added 6 oz. of frozen peas and 2 buillion cubes but I did have to add another cup of water. Still very tasty even my kids (who say they don't like turkey) ate it.

I always ad-lib recipes, so I used 6 cups of water and all of our left over turkey from Thanksgiving (including the skin and stock). Added some salt and pepper, onion and garlic and boiled, then turned down to med-low for 30 mins. Then I added 2 small cans of Jr biscuits (7.5 oz each) rolled in 3 Tbsp of flour and cut up into halves, cooked on Medium heat for another 15 minutes and even though I have the flu, it still smelled wonderful and tasted pretty darn good!

It was alright.  I had to take it off the table and cook it longer because the dumplings were still raw-dough tasting to me.  After a few more minutes cooking it was better.

This is a great recipe.  It's a good base and then you can get creative from there.  I use homemade chicken broth, a couple bags of diced mixed veggies, whatever shredded poultry I have left, pink salt, rainbow pepper, generic canned biscuits.  I like putting it in my pressure cooker for 10 minutes, then adding the biscuit chunks for 5 mins and finally roast the top for 3-5 mins.  (I have a ninja electric pressure cooker so it does it all in one pan and machine).

Anyway, I've never had chicken dumplings, so I really don't know if its supposed to taste like this or not.  I do know that its tasty and my picky husband eats several bowls.

I made some changes and it turned out really good. I added some onion, celery, carrots, and two cans of corn. I also used chicken broth instead of water. I also added some cornstarch to thicken it up a bit and added garlic and onion powder.

I made this tonight for dinner, however I made a few changes. First off, I used half water and half chicken broth. Then I added 3-4 celery stalk leaves. I also used about 1/4c of retained turkey drippings (I am so glad that I saved them). I used a more than generous amount of salt and pepper. I did not use the biscuit dough, but I found a supper easy recipe for dumplings on this cite that was very good, quick and simple- they were ready to be added about 5-10 before the mixture was ready for them. All in all this turned out to be a fantastic dinner. I will definitely remember this recipe for the future.

Great recipe added but I added a few things. One when I used Turkey Chops to and cooked it in the oven till white with salt, pepper, and basil. Second thing for the dumplings I used the Bisquick dumplings recipe. The last thing I changed was I didn't add water instead, like members on this site have stated before I added Turkey gravy which made really gave it more flavor and wrapped it all up nicely. For a side I made Sweet Baby Carrots. This was an affordable meal and the best part it was quick and easy to make.

Needed more flavor. Would not use canned biscuits again. Super easy and I had all the ingredients, but will not make this variation again. I will make my own drop dumplings from bisquick and maybe add garlic, onion, carrots, and celery.

Very good but I definitely tweaked the recipe as per the other reviewers.  I don't agree with the amount of liquid specified in the recipe.  I went with the other reviewers and used chicken broth and water and added as needed which turned out to be more than 3 cups total.  Plus I added additional seasonings to taste.  I like the dumplings but next time might make some homemade noodles to go with it or dumplings from bisquick and see how that tastes.  Good idea though with a little tweaking.

Excellent and very simple to make.  I didn't use refridgerator biscuits but made my own.  I did roll them flat and they came out wonderfully.  One recommendation . . . I wouldn't stir the dumplings while they are cooking.  It seemed to break them apart into what I could see would be a disintigrated mess.  I also used all turkey broth from a turkey carcass.
