I used bacon. I didn't have milk so I made it with krustees pancake mix. I only had dry thyme and chives, so I added them to the mix. Also too lazy to locate blender and I mixed batter with a spoon instead. 
It turned out nice and we ate it for breakfast.

This was excellent! I expected it to be harder than what it was. I'm looking forward to trying different combinations inside the crust. Should work for sweet or savory.

I always love discovering a new way to do eggs and this recipe is just that! Easier to make than I thought. Delicious and so incredibly versatile. If you are time-concerned change the order and whip and bake the eggs first and then cook the sausage. Not that big of a difference but slightly more efficiant.

I've made a ton of Dutch Babies in the past and this is by far my favorite. I did have to substitute dry chives but it certainly didn't change the integrity of the dish.  So versitle.

this will become a breakfast go to. I made with the cheese I had on hand Swiss. And bacon  yummy. Used my vintage # 9 pan . The batter came out light and eggy. I think I’ll do it again and top with just powdered sugar. Skip the savory

Yes I had to buy a cast iron skillet to prepare the herb-sausage-and-cheese-dutch-baby.
Filled the recipe and came our with a winning breakfast.
Came out great.

Quick and easy. Good flavor. The only thing was when adding cheese it deflated.

I used dried onion chives because I did not have fresh. I took grated zucchini, red onion and cooked it some then added chopped onion to the pan, make it your own, really easy to make and very good, love the egg crust.

Loved this recipe. We have enjoyed the Dutch Baby's on the swéet side in the past.  Was looking for something more hardy and this filled the bill.  I added 1 additional egg, substituted some precooked ground beef with onions and added some bacon and seasoning.  Also used Mozzarella rather than cheddar. Still turned out great.

As is we'd give a 4 star, but we know that it'll be a 5 just by adding mushrooms & red peppers. We've made Dutch Babies for years & most of the time use fresh fruit in them, but hubby said this Dutch Baby recipe he thought was better & so we'll try that now with the fruit. He didn't use a blender to mix the batter. He did use a whisk which was enough. The batter rose very high & using a cast iron skillet instead of a Dutch Baby pan really gives a nice brown color. Very easy & quick. We also used our homemade Italian Sausage recipe from this website which I think is better than store bought.

I am all about using what I have on hand.  I used pork breakfast sausage.  A mixture of skim milk and 1/2 and 1/2, and green onions.  I doubled the recipe and cooked it in a dutch oven.  I hardly needed to add any cooking time.  It was very good.

Absolutely delicious! This is the first time I’ve made Dutch baby and it was much easier then I expected. The combination of the ingredients made a great breakfast casserole substitute for our family! Definitely would recommend to anyone

Lately, I keep seeing these Dutch Baby recipes and suddenly I find this one that looks like the perfect Sunday brunch food. Lo and behold this was excellent. Easy to make and delicious. Don't fret if it puffs "strangely" in areas such as the center. It will deflate and be perfectly flat in the center and puffy on the sides once you are done.

Great recipe. Sprinkled with dried thyme instead of fresh since I didn’t have any on hand. Baked for 18 minutes prior to putting toppings on and had huge peaks. Unfortunately the peaks collapsed when I was baking the toppings. Will try to bake longer before adding toppings next time.

This was my first savory Dutch Baby and it did not disappoint. Excellent recipe. My two grown sons were instant fans. This will remain in steady rotation. Thank you!

My first Dutch Baby and it was delicious. I added more sausage and thinly sliced green onions. And I only had a 10 inch skillet, but I’ll definitely make again.

Loved this recipe! I added freshly chopped green onions to the top and it was so delicious! I have an unusually large pan so I know the next time to tinker with the measurements more.
