This recipe was very good, but a bit too salty.  The second time that I made it, I omitted the MSG and just added pepper.  With the high salt content in the tomato juice it did not need any more salt.  The second try was a big hit with the family.

The first time I made this it was for a fundraiser we had for Cub Scouts.  It was a big hit.  We sold more hot dogs with the sauce then without.  I did change the MSG to pepper.  The next time I made it I added more chili power and garlic.   Just to add a little kick.  Everyone loved it.  I now make it at home.  We like it over French Fries and Cheeseburgers.  My son loves it and always wants me to make it instead of buying the sauce in a can.  It is easy to make.  I do add all the spices and onions to the ground beef when I brown it.  Then I put it in the blender to make it fine.  Even with the changes I still give this 5 stars, because it is just as good without adding to the recipe

Great flavor! I used milk in place of the water after hearing on TV  how milk helps break down the meat while cooking. It worked!! Will be making this one again!

When I first set eyes on this recipe, I was sceptical. It was too easy to be good. I gave it a try anyway and followed the others' suggestion to add pepper to it. Surprisingly enough it was delicious !!! I can hardly wait to share the recipe with my friends. Many of them gave it a try and it is now a big hit among us. So I'm giving it a rating what it deserves, 5 brights stars !!!

A great recipe. I cooked the onion and garlic with the beef, added beef bouillion to the water and nixed the MSG. Also, I increased the amounts of both garlic and chili powder. I needed to add a bit of white sugar to balance the acidity, but it was probably due to the tomato sauce I used. Thanks much, though. It was just what I was looking for. (This sauce also makes for fabulous garbage fries - pour onto hot cooked french fries and add sour cream or ranch dressing, cheese, peppers, etc. Yum!)

This was very tasty.  Almost sloppy joe like, but maybe because I let it simmer on the stove for about 40 minutes or so instead of just 10 minutes.  Only because I made the coney sauce first and hadn't put the french fries in the oven yet.

This was good. Next time I will leave out the salt. And I did not add the msg. I added paprika and pepper instead. Because It was salty, I added a Tbs. of brown sugar to balance it out. After that It was really good!

WOW!!!!!! I love this stuff.  My sister, whom is not all that wild about hot dogs, came over to my house, and ahd a hot dog.  She loved this recipe.  She has already gone to my mom's house and told her about it.  My 6 year old daughter, whom is a hot dog lover, ate 2 hot dogs instead of the usual one.  Thank you for this FANTASTIC recipe!!!!!

I didnt use the msg because my daughter cannot have msg.  Followed recipe otherwise.  I just thought it needed extra things in it... Taste was ok.  Than i added a good amount of worcestire sauce and browning liquid. Lots more chilli powder also...  ThAn it was better, but still tasted more like a sloppy joe than a coney sauce....??  Needs tweaking...

Really good. Both my husband and I loved it. The only change we made was omitting the MSG (didn't have any) and we added a full (small) onion instead of 1/4. Turned out great. Definitely a keeper for nights we can't think of anything or are on a tight budget. Everything in the recipe is stuff we normally have on hand.

When I read the recipe, it looked easy enough for a begginer cook to replicate. I made the original sauce, but once I tasted it, I felt it needed something else. So I added about 2 tbl of  worcerterchire sauce. My husbend and family liked it. But I do wish the acididy was balanced. I did not add the MSG.

I originally gave this recipe only 3 stars, but had to come back and edit. After a slow simmer and spread over hot dogs this one is definitely a keeper! My kids swear they could eat this on a daily basis!

This was very good, I think next time I would add just a little more tomato sauce,just to loosen it up a little. I didn't use the msg in it. My family liked it even my fussy eater liked it.

I found this recipe to be a definate keeper. This was my first attempt at a coney sauce and this recipe even made ME look like I actually new what I was doing!!  This is NOT a hot sauce as written, but I am sure one could easily turn this coney sauce into one just by adding your favorite "fire" to it. Thanks for this one!

this was really easy and really good. I did add a beef broth cube and a bit more chili powder and some paprika to it, and then let it cook for almost two hours. only because in my head dinner was going to just take thirty minutes, but it ended up taking almost two hours. my dinner guest had requested chili dogs and he ate three of them so they must have been good!

I have been eating hot dogs at Coney Island all my life, and have never seen or heard of such a sauce, in Coney Island or anywhere else within the five boroughs.  I think it was so named because of Coney Island's (that is, Nathan's, reputation for hot dogs).

read several coney sauce recipes on AR and reviews for this specific recipe. I omitted the MSG and salt as I used 1/2tsp. beef boullion and it has salt in it. I also added 1/2T. worchestershire sauce, 1/2 T. pepper (5 pepper blend) and 1T. mustard. The inexpensive coney sauces in the cans at the grocery store have NO beef in them--they are strictly a spiced refried bean product. Since I used 2# of beef (and adjusted the spices accordinly) for a large group, I stretched the recipe by adding 16 oz. of refired beans to my 2# of beef. The coney sauce was entirely gone after our picnic. I am saving this recipe and using it often.

This sauce was good, but I only gave it a 4 because I had to add a considerable amount of chili powder.  I also omitted the salt and msg.

We really enjoyed this. I would have rated it a "4" but the boys were unanimous in their 5-star rating. 
I put the onions and garlic in with the ground beef and sprinkled it with chili powder while it browned. Good stuff. Thanks for posting Sandra.

Good recipe.  Better than most I have tried. Just a little too salty.

Excellent, excellent, excellent!!!  And that comes from someone who's gone a lifetime eating hotdogs without chili.

I would make this again. I added more chili powder to mine. Overall it's a good recipe.

I liked this sauce, but Coney Island hot dogs with "Coney sauce" aren't a New York thing, they are a Flint / Detroit Michigan thing.  Way back when people in Michigan were importing their hot dogs from ny and started calling them "Coney Island dogs".

I made a few adjustments, first I made my own tomato sauce. The fresh, I just prefer. Then I killed the MSG. Then I added a splash of balsamic vinegar and a Hungarian pepper diced very finely for a  little more kick. This is gong to be my "go to" coney sauce - if you wish to avoid the hot side  of warm, I'd go w/ maybe a 1/3 of a green pepper instead of the Hungarian.

This was okay.  I added more chili powder and about 1 tsp. of cumin to the sauce and I did not add in MSG because I am allergic to it.

After reading all the high reviews, I have to admit I was disappointed. My family and I thought it was too bland and mild, even though I added more chili powder than called for. The sauce was OK, but it really does needs something else to give your hotdogs a 'kick'. I don't think I'll make this again.

Nothing to write home about, unfortunately.  Kids didn't touch it.

Husband and son didn't like it at all!  Daughter thought it was just OK and I loved it! Almost like a cross between sloppy joes and chili sauce.....I've never bothered to put chili sauce on a hotdog - don't care for hotdogs - now I'm ready to eat them all the time!  It's a shame I'm the only one out of the 4 of us that like it.

This was pretty good. A little salty and a little dry. Tastes like a mild flavorful chili sauce. I will make again as a topper for hot dogs. Definitely better than canned chili sauce for hot dogs. I served to my family on hot dogs with Tasty Buns and everybody thouroughly enjoyed. Served with homemade french fries and all made for a good hearty casual weekend meal.
