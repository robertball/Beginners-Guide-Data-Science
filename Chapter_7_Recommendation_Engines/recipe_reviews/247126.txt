I didn't have garlic scapes so I just used minced garlic. Probably had a little more garlic flavor but it was amazing!

Great dish, just wished that they's stop telling how long the pasta should cook! Each brand and type of pasta has their time set for cooking, not all pasta cooks  in 11 minutes!!! 
For example, it is quite strange that a spaghetti takes 11', it's usually the time rigatoni o fusilli take to cook.

It was pretty good. Iâ€™d probably make it again.
