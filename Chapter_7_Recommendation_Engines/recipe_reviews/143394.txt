Excellent marinade! My husband isn't a huge fan of grilled shrimp, but we were having his Mom over and we both love the stuff so we got our turn on the grill. All I added to this marinade was a little dry white wine and I did cut the brown sugar way back to 1 tsp. because I really wanted the garlic and herb flavor to come through vs. a sweet flavor. But I still wanted to stick to the recipe. I skewered the shrimp onto bamboo skewers and marinated it for a couple hours. It turned out so good - I would definitely make this again!

Because I'm not a big fan of sweet mixed with savory, I only used a third of the brown sugar called for. This is a matter of personal taste, and I'm sure others would love the extra sweetness. Also, running short of time, I only marinated the shrimp for an hour, and it turned out to be a happy mistake. The seasoning was just right, and had it marinated any longer I think it would have been too strong, overpowering the taste of the shrimp. More isn't always better! Rather than the outdoor grill, we just broiled these on bamboo skewers and, once done, brushed on some melted butter for a nice glisten and richness. Served this wonderful dinner with Dill and Butter Squash and Parmesan Orzo, recipes also from this site.

These were delicious!  A delicate marinade that enhanced the flavor of shrimp.  The only changes I made were to use fresh basil, and boil the remaining marinade (with 1 T. butter) for basting on the grill.  Served with garlic butter rice, and sauteed zucchini for the most delicious meal so far this week.  I will definitely use this receipe again!

Great flavor, my guests all loved this recipe!! I followed all the steps from the original recipe and although it would be easy to make changes to accomodate personal tastes there really isn't much reason to do so.

Very easy to make!!

We all loved it, though we made a few minor changes.  I didn't have any basil but did use the Italian seasonings and I didn't have time to marinate much -- just 30 minutes.  We cooked these on our George Foreman and it worked out great -- quick and easy!  I was especially grateful it wasn't too spicy which made it great for our 3yo and 5yo.  Yum!

This shrimp recipe was great.  I used 1 tsp of regular paprika and 1 tsp of smoked spanish paprika.  I only added 1 TBS of brown sugar, and it was perfect.  I would add a little more sugar if you had a bit more that 2 lbs shrimp, or if they were larger than 21/25, to make sure they are coated.

its the first recipe I came across that I already had all the ingredients for! We liked it. But maybe we should have marinated it for longer that 45 min. I plan to try it again very soon and I will marinate it for 2 hours next time.

Unlike many of the other reviewers, I didn't mind the sweetness of the brown sugar. That said I could imagine that the recipe would be equally as good with little to no sugar. I don't own a grill (yet). So I broiled the shrimp in the oven for about 3 minutes, turning them half way through.

I LOVE this!! It's so easy and yummy! The only thing I did different was, I cooked the shrimp in the oven on 350 for like 20mins. Still tasted juicy!

Very tasty. Followed ingredients fairly closely using fresh oregano and basil and only a pinch (1 t. or less) of brown sugar. I don't think we would want any more sugar. Used medium shrimp so only grilled about four minutes total.
Did this again and used the full amount of sugar. Less is better. Only had time to marinate for 10 minutes and it was great. Two hours might be too long with the lemon as it begins to deteriorate the shrimp.

Added more garlic and onion powder but otherwise finger-lickin' good! Loved it!! My 4yr old and soon to be 1 year old tried to steal mine off my plate after they snarffed theirs, and my husband thought they were very good and must repeat! This is coming from someone who doesn't care much for shrimp!! I'll definately have to make an extra bag of shrimp next time and soon to double because the kids are growing fast! IF YOU LOVE SHRIMP YOU MUST TRY THIS!!

This was good but we thought it was missing something. I will make these again but maybe next time I will use fresh basil, thyme and oregano. Thanks.

Amazing!  I found this recipe and was so excited about it. My boyfriend actually had to do the prep and make the marinade, and it was still delicious (we had our doubts about his skills)!  We let them marinade for about an hour and a half, and the flavor was wonderful, thank you so much for an easy and delicious recipe!

This was excellent - used it as a marinade for diced chicken breast to top pasta...saute the chicken until cooked through and then toss with pasta in garlic & olive oil.  Next time I will omit or signifcantly cut the brown sugar if not grilling as it makes for a rather sweet flavored sauce...and will add a shake of red pepper flakes as well.

These are soooo good!!!  I followed the recipe exactly as specified and marinated them for a few hours in the shell then peeled them before pan frying in some of the marinade.  They were a huge hit although next time I would only use 1 tsp of basil.  EXCELLENT and a nice change!

Wasn't crazy about these.  I think I just prefer simple butter and garlic on my shrimp, and not the sweetness of the other herbs.  I also made these on the Foreman grill and they cooked so fast that they were overcooked - my fault.  But neither my husband nor I cared for the flavor anyway.

Fantastic.  I had to make one change as I'm on a no amylose diet. (no gluten and no root veggies except for onions and garlic and no white foods).  I substituted quinoa for the rice.

Very easy to put together and made a very tasty and light flavor.  I used more garlic cause my family likes a more bold garlic flavor.  Would definitly use again.

Delicious!  I didn't do anything differently except that I reduced the brown sugar to 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon, and it was perfect.  My husband and I really enjoyed these shrimp - he told me to add these to his list of favorites!  Tell your dad he has a winner with this one :-)

This was a great addition to a mixed seafood grill we prepared for our father's day celebration.  I used shrimp and scallops.  Fresh basil made this really flavorful.  Really more of a rub than a marinade, add some liquid like OJ if you want to thin this.  I just put everything in a zip-lock and let it hang out in the fridge for about four hours.  I skewered the seafood and grilled, delicious.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This recipe looked really good to me, but I only had pre-cooked shrimp on hand.  So instead of grilling I just sauteed them briefly with the marinade until the shrimp were heated through.  (I flip-flopped the amount of the lemon juice and oil.)  Try subbing Jamaican Jerk seasoning for the basil for a slight flavor variation that's very good, too.

5 stars!   This is a restaurant quality recipe!  Quick, easy and delicious!  I made the shrimp according to the directions and served the grilled shrimp over a fresh salad.   I am planning to make this recipe again for shrimp tacos as well as serving with grilled vegetables (onions, tomatoes, zucchini, peppers and mushrooms) over jasmine rice.

Delicious! My two children keep asking me to make this over and over again! I didn't have the basil so I left that out and instead of using the Italian seasoning I used Bragg Organic Sea Kelp Delight Seasoning. Thank you so much for the recipe, going to go make it right now!

This is one of the best recipes I've every had.  I can't have sugar so I left it out  and added 2T melted butter, and it was delicioius!  We have it quite often and serve to company with rave reviews.

Absolutley the best tasting shrimp I have ever had. You could taste the brown sugar very lightly. All the seasonings came together and coated the shrimp well. I marinated the shrimp for 4 hours and then grilled them. I used collasal shrimp and they were fantastic.

I agree with the other people, use half the amount of brown sugar... it was just a bit too sweet for me.  Otherwise really good!

Decent and easy.  The flavor really soaks into the shrimp.  I also used to marinade scallops, and the result is a more subtle, gentler flavor.

I was looking for a marinade that was more than just lemon. This was sooo yummy! I made it for my husband for fathers day and marinaded shrimp and scallops then grilled them on skewers - DELICIOUS! * they do have a sweetness that I really enjoyed but if you're not a fan of sweet I would use less sugar. (I didn't feel it took away from the seafood taste at all and I marinaded a full 2 hrs.)

These were good. There were mixed reviews at end of how it tasted though. My BF who prepped and cooked them said next time he's gonna use less brown sugar. We also forgot that it was suppose to marinate for 2 hours. I found them better to be cold than warm. We bought the pre-cooked shrimp and my mom and I were eating some before they went on the grill. We had some left over that we did not put on the grill that stayed in the marinate so the next day my boyfriend and I warmed them up and had them for dinner. Over all I enjoyed the taste of the recipe but I have tasted some better ones.  We are going to try this one again later this summer.

I made these outside on the grill for Memorial Day weekend, and I happened to be alone when they were finished (boyfriend went to the store).  I had eaten the whole lot by the time he got home!  They were delicious!  The only thing is I wish I had put a little lime juice in the marinade, it really would have perked them up.  Otherwise, these were awesome!

Finger-licking good. The best grilled shrimp ever! My family loved them and have made me promise to make it again. The only change was chopped fresh garlic instead of minced.

This was very disappointing. I couldn't even taste the shrimp - it just tasted like a big bite of Italian seasoning. A waste of good shrimp. Followed directions exactly - I'll be looking elsewhere for a shrimp marinade.

Very good marinade. I actually forgot the paprika and I didn’t have any lemon juice. I used fresh basil since I had it. The brown sugar gave it a little sweetness and I added a little red pepper flakes since I like a little heat. Good flavor. I usually have a hard time with getting my shrimp flavorful and this worked well. I broiled the shrimp as I don’t have a grill. Can’t wait to try it with the lemon juice and paprika.

My shrimp marinated for about 15 minutes. Instead of grilling them, I put them on a pan under the broiler for about 10-15 minutes They were wonderful. Great taste with just enough spicy flavor.

Easy and fabulous.  This recipe will be added to my summer entertaining rotation.  My family raved after wrapping the shrimp into tacos.  The recipe was straight forward but I opted to sub lime juice for the recommended lemon and used fresh basil rather than dried.

This wasn't bad, a little too heavy on the herbs making the shrimp feel a little gritty. I'd make it again for something different from time to time.

These were just perfect for a quick and simple summer meal.  I served over orzo and it was delicious.

Absolutely fanTAStic!!!   Like others, I reduced the brown sugar -- 1T instead of 2T --  but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  If you like a bit more spice, you could easily add some red pepper flakes or cayenne to the marinade.   This is soooo delicious.   Even my kids (all elementary school age) gobbled it up.   Can't wait to try it again!

This was amazing--didn't deviate from the recipe other than that I only marinated the shrimp 1 hour... Turned out great on the grill!

This recipe was a find because I needed something to use up thawed shrimp without going to the store and I had all the ingredients on hand except for Italian seasoning, which I managed to add a few ingredients that make it up. Everyone enjoyed them. Next time I'd add a little bit of heat with a hot sauce or a few red pepper flakes.

Really great! We just ate this...even my semi picky 11 year old told me it was a great meal! I didn't have time to marinate for 2 hours. I marinated 30 minutes then sauted it in a pan with butter. When the shrimp were done I took them out an reduced the marinade. It was delicious. Served with rice and fresh steamed green beans an awesome meal! And quick to boot.

This was delicious, and easy to put together.  I added a little salt to the paste.  2 hours seemed a bit long to marinate shrimp with all the lemon juice; I did so for about half an hour and they were awesome.

This shrimp is amazing.  I was definitely skeptical while making it but I loved it.  I don't have a grill so I ended up just using a frying pan.  I also just used red pepper instead of paprika which gave it a fiery zest and since I didn't have Italian seasoning blend I just added a little salt, oregano, and sage.  I served this over some rice.  I will definitely be making this again.

The flavor was too strong for the shrimp, but it was tasty.  When I put it on ritz crackers the taste was phenonemal bc the buttery cracker taste complimented the flavor of the marinade.

AWESOME.  This recipe was great.  My family loved it, even the non-shrimp eaters were asking for more.  Like some of the others, I also mixed the remaining marinade with butter and used for basting.

My husband absolutely LOVED these....I let him give the star rating.  I swear his eyes rolled into the back of his head when he ate the first bite, as I didn't tell him about the slightly sweet taste.  That was a surprise.

I used fresh basil instead of dried, used a little more garlic, and like a previous poster suggested, boiled the marinade with 2TB of butter which we basted the mixture with. YUM.

Thanks for a great recipe!

It was good, I guess it just lacked something that made it "stand out" from others I have tried.  I will probably use again, but it will depend on the other stuff that is to go with it.

My husband made this recipe and it was yummy!  We didn't have the basil so he put in a little more Italian seasoning.

Delicious!  It was a little on the sweet side for me.  I will probably cut back on some of the brown sugar.  I can't wait to make it again.

Excellent recipe - only  change I made was cutting the sugar in half.  Happy I did as there was hint of sweetness but the herbs tasted wonderful.  Hubby said it was the best he's eaten. 
Will certainly make again.

The herbs were way too "heavy" for our taste.  For us there was too much paprika and Italian seasoning.... had a very different taste that was not pleasant.  I will stick to my tried and true... good luck!

Great flavor profile but of I can't help but tinker. Our house likes spice so I added a half teaspoonish each of cayenne, red pepper flakes, and salt. To taste of course. I mixed and tasted dry ingredients first. Once to taste, I added wet ingredients to a zip lock and let hang out for 3ish hours before adding shrimp to marinade for a couple hours. I used a lightly oiled cast iron skillet and got it medium high hot, cooked shrimp in batches. Maybe 2-3 minutes a side. Don't overload each batch or else they will steam and you won't get good caramelization. Be sure to scrape all juices and seasonings out between batches or else it will burn. The flavor combo was on point. We served 4 adults with varying levels of pallets and all couldn't keep their hands off. Devoured before anything else could be cooked.

Herbed flavor for sure!  I was only able to marinate mine for about 1/2 hour due to getting a late start on dinner preps, and yet the flavors stood out immensely.  So easy to prepare.  No time to heat up coals so I made indoors on a stovetop griddle.  With those things in mind, this could be a quick weeknight dinner.  I really appreciated that I had all ingredients in the house already.  I just had to buy the shrimp and a vegetable and there was dinner!  I did substitute 2 packets of Splenda for the brown sugar and you couldn't tell.  With a vegetable side, we had a very low carb dinner (husband is diabetic).  For those who like a bit of heat, sprinkle red pepper flakes on some of the skewers.  I plan to make this addition in future executions.

I followed the recipe with no changes. It was a little bland. Did not seem like it should have been bland with all of the seasonings in the marinade, but I would cut the brown sugar in half, and add a little salt.

I followed the recipe Exactly. I marinated them for 24 hours and slightly salted the skewers 15 minutes before they went on the Big Green Egg. Cooked them 3 minutes per side at 400 degrees and it was THE MOST DELICOUS SHRIMP EVER!!

I use larger shrimp after I put them in the pan I brush them with an additional homemade garlic butter they were very good matter of fact they were excellent. The brown sugar added a different taste after they grills on one side I turned them over brushed garlic butter on the other side and Grill them a little bit longer

This is a fine marinade because it delivers the one trick and kick anyone who wants ultimate rapid (depending on level of heat mid to high okay here) CHAR GRILL SHRIMP TASTE without them turning to rubber.

The secret is some sugar coating on the outside - shrimp cook real quick and you need to goose the char with some sugar to caramelize. 

Keep your eye on the grill at all times so as not to overcook!

These were so easy and very delicious I used fresh basil from my garden instead of dry basil and took the advice of a lot of the reviews and used only 1 TBSP of brown sugar.  Will definitely make these again.

So good that I didn’t get a chance to take a picture! I was a little nervous about the brown sugar, but it not only adds to the recipe but it makes the recipe! I’m definitely making this again!

Very flavorful and so simple to make. I marinated it for 1 hour due to time constraints, used 1 TBSP brown sugar, fresh basil. Had it with fresh green salad. So delicious!!! Thank you berly15216 for this great, easy recipe. It will be a regular this summer!!

I've made this twice and it was a hit both times! The first time I had to wrangle some substitutions and I was nervous I would not be able to get the same flavor when I actually followed the recipe but it was a hit! We were grilling brats and corn and all the guests wanted to do was eat skewers of this garlicky/spicy shrimp.

Served as appetizer.  Everyone loved it.  Minor adjustments:  Used very large shrimp (13/20), marinated 3 hrs., cut back on the brown sugar (1 tbls), doubled up on the garlic, used fresh basil and parsley, roasted at 425 for 5 minutes instead of saute.  Two thumbs up!

I loved it, it was very tasty, however I seasoned the shrimp with some fine sea salt before I placed It with the marinated sauce.  You can also put half the amount of sugar, and add salt instead and It would work too

OMG! This is the best shrimp I have ever had. I only had 90 minutes to marinate, and it turned out beautifully. Hubby is a saucy person, so he dipped it in Sambal. Both applications were equally tasty. I will definitely be having it again...soon!
Our sides were grilled onion/yellow pepper/celery skewers and TJ's Basmati Rice Medley. Yummy all-around.

Easy meal to make. Served the shrimp over a bed of brown rice. My only criticism is that the shrimp were a little sweet for my taste. I will make it again but cut the brown sugar by half. Thumbs up!

We really liked this recipe,  but it needed a bit more punch. More lemon and a pinch of cayenne. I did however only marinate for an hour so maybe that made a difference. Will make this again!

Made this according to the directions, substituting Old Bay for the Italian seasoning and holding off on the lemon juice until just before grilling as others have suggested.  It was good, but not great.  The Old Bay along with the black pepper made it a bit too spicy for us and seemed to be a bit overpowering.  There was a definite sweetness to the flavor from the brown sugar.  I think next time I'll drastically cut the Old Bay if I use it at all.  Also, without the lemon juice in the marinade, it comes out like a heavy, thick paste.  More liquid is needed in some form to make it a marinade you can work with - perhaps a bit of white wine or even plain water.

This was a giant hit at my Superbowl party!  Only alteration was honey in the marinade  versus brown sugar.  1 hr in the fridge, cooked on an indoor grilled. Lightly caramelized, herbaceous perfection that people could not stop raving about!

Very good Shrimp!  As  you can imagine with the sugar in it there is a touch of sweet.   I am going to try it again with a little more lemon juice to add a little more tang.

Loved it. I did cut back on the basil because I have had experiences in the past where it can overpower.

Was fantastic, we loved it. The only things I tweaked was I sprinkled some salt on the shrimp while on the bbq and put some cayenne pepper into the marinade.

YUM!!!  Marinade is super easy to prepare.  I whisked all the ingredients together in a medium/large bowl and as I cleaned/shelled each shrimp, just dropped them in the bowl.  Stirred it all together to make sure each shrimp was coated, covered the bowl in plastic wrap, placed in the fridge and forgot about it until it was time to grill.  The shrimp is so flavorful, sweet and tangy.  The herbs add great balance and we really enjoyed the garlic flavor.  This will certainly be made again!

By far one of our favorite shrimp recipes!!! The only change I made was adding the remaining marinade towards the end of grilling to keep the shrimp extra moist!
So delicious!!!!!

Worried it would be too sweet so I only used one Tablespoon of brown sugar and added a dash of sweet chili sauce. The sweet chili sauce gave it a slight kick. Also only marinated for about a half hour. It was perfect. Everyone loved it. Good recipe and I will make it again.

Made this quick and easy recipe. I didn't have time to marinate it for 2 hrs., but it turned out fine. I also put some pineapple chunks on the skewers. I was all out of lemon juice, substitute lime juice, once again it was just fine.  It made a great dinner on short notice.

I adjusted the recipe to be made stovetop and it worked out very well.  I cooked the shrimp in a sautee pan with all of the marinade, then removed the shrimp, added a touch of corn starch to the marinade, and simmered it for a few minutes to thicken.  Finally, I tossed the shrimp in the marinade/sauce and served it over lemon-garlic pasta.  My husband and I both agreed that the shrimp were a touch sweet so next time I'll adjust for that.

This was good. I ended up only using 1 tbsp of brown sugar, as I didn't want any sweetness. I can see how it helps to Caramelize on the grill though. I'm a garlic fan so may up that next time.

Amazing.  I am not one to change the recipe, however this time I had no choice as I was out of tomato sauce, so I used mild salsa instead.  Followed the rest exactly, and BBQ'd them over charcoal.  WOW.!!!!  They turned out incredible.  My wife who does not like shrimp, ate two and said they were very good.  I devoured the rest, they were very tasty with just the right amount of kick.  Will def be throwing more shrimp on the Barbie soon....I couldn't resist.

An easy and excellent mix. I did find the brown sugar was a little heavy, so next time I'll cut back by half a teaspoon.

So tasty! Normally, I get annoyed when people rate recipes based on adding and subtracting 9 things. BUT, here I am. Only with 1.5 changes though because I thought I had everything on the list and, alas, out of paprika. Boo! But a quick google and I substituted just a dash of cayenne because I'm not a big spice person but wanted it to be as close to the recipe as possible. Also, I had delicious smelling fresh basil staring at me in the face so I had to use that instead of dried (that's the 1/2 change).  SO GOOD! Very flavorful and I'd do it all over again. Next time, I'll make sure I have paprika (though it was a delicious sub) but I may keep the fresh basil. Perfect for grilling out on a gorgeous day.

I made exactly as instructed except we have no grill so I pan fried it with veggies. The lemon juice also cooks the shrimp so I marinaded it only for 1 hour. 2 is definitely not needed as it was full of flavor. It tasted delicious!

delicious! I cooked it with some grilled zucchini and was very fresh and yummy! I live in an apartment so I don't own a grill, so i cooked it in a pan and still tasted great!

I cut back the sugar as others suggested.  I also pan fried the shrimp.  I took out the shrimp when they were done and then reduced the drippings by half and poured them over the shrimp for extra flavor.  It was a huge hit.  I will make this again.

I have made this several times and it is sooooo yummy!  I follow the recipe to the letter.  My only difference is I put it in a ziplock bag with the shrimp in the fridge for awhile before dinner.  Scewer the shrimp and put it on the grill!  Yummy!  Paired with the zucchini and corn sauté from the website and some couscous and you have an amazing meal!!
I want to use this marinade for chicken also!  So good!

Wow, I have made this 8 times so far.  Have doubled & tripled the recipe, then split marinade into two bowls putting shrimp in one and veggies in the other (asparagus, brocc., red onions, pepper strips & mushrooms) , I let everything marinade maybe a 1/2 hr. then grilled veg. first, putting them back in their bowl with the marinade drippings, then grilled the shrimp adding them on top of veg & mixing together,  FANTASTIC!  Have served over a salad and over rice.

Everybody at the cookout loved this!  I used frozen shrimp and defrosted them in a brine of salt and sugar water as recommended by another member.  I had run out of Italian seasoning so I just used fresh thyme and rosemary.  I marinated for about 1 hour.  Awesome!

We absolutely loved this grilled shrimp recipe!  I only marinated about an hour, but, it still had great flavor.  You definitely tasted both the garlic and the herbs.  They were slightly sweet, so, next time I will cut back on a little of the sugar and maybe even throw in some red pepper flakes.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good recipe. I only let it set for 30 minutes maybe little longer, but not the recommended time, because of pushing time. Family enjoyed it very much. Next time will do the full time. Thanks for sharing.

I really enjoyed this recipe! Although, I did not use any brown sugar.   I also placed all of the shrimp on a grill pan and cooked it in the oven at 400' until the shrimp was cooked, approximately 20 mins.  AWESOME. I put it over linguine  noodles with spinach and my husband and 17 year old son ate it!

We just tried it tonight. I slightly modified it as I had no basil. I added about two tbsp of Soy sauce. I think a touch of ginger could also be good. I have saved the marinade and will try it on fresh caught Coho salmon tomorrow. Do yourselves a favor and use wild caught Gulf shrimp instead of farm-raised. I refuse to eat farm raised shrimp after learning what they are fed in the ponds in which they are raised.

I followed this recipe to the letter except I added fresh herbs from my garden, and did not add the sugar because I wanted the garlic and herbs to really shine through. But it's really to what you like and don't. I also left the heads and shells on because I think it gives it more flavor and holds the marinade in while the shrimp is cooking on the grill. Served over pasta and Alfredo sauce. Sooooo good!! Totally keeping this recipe!!!

I thought this was great, my husband thought it was good.  I rated it 5 stars, he rated it 4 stars.  I’m the cook – it gets 5 stars.  This is an excellent marinade and the hint of sweetness from the brown sugar was the perfect addition.

I liked the seasonings and marinade.  I only had time to marinate the shrimp a half hour and they were still wonderful.  Will make this again, next time, however, I think I'm going to use smoked paprika.. it needed just a wee bit of zip.

I grilled these shrimp kabobs today with steak tips for an awesome surf and turf.  EVERYONE loved them - my new go-to shrimp recipe.  Absolutely delicious.

This is really good and easy. I followed the recipe exactly. I thought I would have shrimp leftover, but all 3 pounds were eaten by only 3 of us!!!! This is easy and tasty....my daughter would have given this 5 stars, but I don't give 5 stars very easily. Try this recipe!

Serving suggestion: with Mushroom rice Pilaf. I used 51-60 ct shrimp on skewers via the broiler for 6 minutes. The marinade itself I think could have toned down on some of the herbs. The hint of sweet from the brown sugar was nice, and certainly only a hint. The color from the paprika was good, but my rating comes from the overkill on the herbs. Was it from marinating for the 2 full hours? Unknown.

We used pre-cooked shrimp, but other than that we followed the recipe to the letter.  We grilled the shrimp for a short time to be sure it wasn't overcooked.  Some might consider the recipe a bit sweet, but it was light and tastey!

The flavor of the recipe totally overwelmed the shrimp taste I've had much better grilled shrimp from this site, not recommended..

This was really good!! My family enjoyed it. I am not a big shrimp eater, but I ate all of it and made another batch at my husbands request. This one's a keeper and will be carried to family barbeques.
