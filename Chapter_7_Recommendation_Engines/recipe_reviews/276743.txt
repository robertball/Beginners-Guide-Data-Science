Full disclosure: I didn't make this but I ate it at a Filipino kamayan - a traditional feast where your only utensils are your hands. It was one of the most delicious seafood dishes I've ever had -- so fresh and fragrant from the coconut milk and ginger. Be sure to serve it with steamed rice to capture all that delectable sauce.
