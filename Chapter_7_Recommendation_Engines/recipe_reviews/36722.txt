I cheated with a store-bought jar of pesto but the results were delicious.

Excellent recipe.  I of course cheated too, and used pesto that I had made and frozen. This was a great new side dish that my husband and I both loved.

This recipe was alright. I felt the dish didn't have enough flavor. It seemed overly herb-ish but maybe needed more salt? Dunno. We ate them with ketchup because it needed something more.

I adore pesto and I did use my own recipe, however, I was not impressed with this dish. I thought the potatoes actually had a funky kind of taste. Will definitely not be making this again.

As much as our family LOVES both pesto and potatoes, I was disappointed.  I used my own awesome pesto recipe and even that didn't help much...it was missing something...

This was OK.  If I ever made it again I would use my own pesto recipe.

This dish was a huge sucess.  I was in a rush and just mixed the pesto into the broth and poured over! Did cook longer than suggested. I would make again and maybe add some feta.
