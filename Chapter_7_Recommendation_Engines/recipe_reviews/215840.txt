I made this pizza last night, much to my husbanbs dismay, he doesn't think chicken belongs on pizza. He tried it....he loved it!!!! Thank you for such a great and simple recipe. I followed the recipe exactly, no changes needed. I will be making it often.

Excellent!!!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce and felt it needed a bit more bbq taste, but overall  - this was a winner!

Loved it! Some changes I made was cooking the chicken in olive oil, simply because I didn't have the sesame oil on hand. For the crust I used the Boboli brand crust and used Monterey Jack cheese on the top vs the mozzarella on bottom. I also added pepperoncini on top before baking.

I thought this tasted pretty good. I wasn't going to go to the store to buy basil pasta sauce, plus I find basil too strong anyhow. I used a jarred marinara sauce. For the bbq sauce I combined a store bought hickory brown sugar with some homemade I had left. For the pizza crust, I used fresh dough and just baked it for 10 minutes before adding the toppings. Make sure to have a cover for the chicken, that has to cook 20 minutes, in the oil. I had it on medium and it still splattered quite a bit for some reason. I also just made 2 pizzas, I didn't see the point in all the work to just make one.

Awesome recipe paired with the Master Pizza Crust recipe.  I love BBQ chicken - and BBQ chicken pizza is just a natural gravitation!

This pizza is yummy! My crust turned out a little soggy though. Next time i will bake it with some sauce before adding all the toppings.

This was really good!  I used the "Pizza Dough I" recipe from this site (read my review).  I cheated with the chicken and took a pre-cooked, pre-seasoned one, and stirred 1 Tbl. barbeque sauce on it (big time saver!).  Note that any marinara would do - I didn't use Classico brand, and it was just fine.  The rest I left the same.  Next time, I would increase the red onion to 1/2 cup - it needed just a little more.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this a couple of times and my fiance and I have both agreed that the pre-baked pizza crust is a no-go. Next time we do this, I'll definitely make the crust myself. Also, beware of what barbeque sauce you use. We prefer Jack Daniels but found that in this case it did not complement the tomato sauce at all.

Used the recipe for Ricardo's Pizza crust and followed the BBQ chicken recipe exactly except to cook pizza at 475 which is what the crust recipe said to do.  This turned out delicious!!!

Absolutely fantastic.  I wanted to eat the whole pizza myself.  We just used a Boboli, but followed it exactly and it was decadent.

Just ok.  I think the frozen Cali Kitchen bbq chick pizza from the grocery store is better.

If you're not super careful with the onion measurement and put more than 1/3 cup (which isn't much at all) you wind up with wet spots underneath every single onion. Be forewarned! This was tasty though, thanks for sharing.
