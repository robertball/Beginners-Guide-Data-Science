First tasted this cake back in the 1960's, and it is definitely a keeper.  We always used the fresh frozen coconut (which may be what is called for in this recipe) but if it's not, let me recommend the fresh frozen coconut (Tropic Isle, I think--if that brand is still around.)

I have to agree with the previous reviewer.  This cake is just okay and definitely not worth waiting 4 days to eat.  I was disappointed in this recipe.  It just tasted like a box coconut cake recipe.  The sour cream and 96 hours wait didn't make it any better.

My mother first made this cake many years ago, and it has been popular in our family ever since, especially at Christmas.  Waiting the four days to serve it really does improve the flavor.

The cake wasn't bad, but definitely wasn't worth waiting four days for.  I actually tasted small pieces after each 24hour period and I found no difference in taste or moistness from day 1 to day 4.  So if you want an easy coconut box cake, this is an ok recipe, but if you're expecting something exceptional after the 4th day, you'll probably be disappointed.

This is the cake my grandmother always had in the frig in the basement for when I came to visit. It is SO MOIST and so easy to make. Also note, this cake freezes well - thaw in the frig for one day before serving. Best served slightly chilled.

I grew up eating this cake and I will soon be 64.  It has always been a favorite around my Mom's house.  What she did different was mix the sour cream and coconut and powdered sugar and put it in frig for 3 days.  THEN make the cake, split layers and everything the day before eating.  Promise you that you will not regret one mouthful :)!!
