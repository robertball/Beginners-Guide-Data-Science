I'm surprised this doesn't have more reviews!  An awesome recipe!  I'm really giving 5 stars to the pancake portion of the recipe, but look forward to trying the filling as written . . . soon.  This is a great starting point for a quick inexpensive and healthy meal.  Really quite good flavor out of the "pancake" part of the dish. We actually filled them with black beans, corn and a little Cabot cheddar cheese.  I can see switching up the ingredients to create new masterpieces.  I'm wondering what's the importance of instant oatmeal, as old fashioned oats seemed to work just fine.    We liked these so much, I'll try another variation tomorrow.  Thanks Linda!!

I made these today.  My boyfriend really liked them.  I enjoyed them as well.  The only changes I made was to use breakfast turkey sausages I cut up instead of the Canadian bacon and used frozen chopped spinach.  They were great!  I served them with salsa for a little added kick.  Yummm!

These pancakes are really good!! I have never made savory pancakes before and with these, it won't be the last time! Yuumo!! I made some chipotle mayo to spread on the pancake and filled it with sauteed  pork slices, black beans and corn. I also added green onion and cheddar cheese. They are very easy to make and soo many different ways to make them. Thank You Linda! Keep them coming!

These pancakes are a different twist on dinnertime, and I really like to make them. It's easy to just throw all of the ingredients in  the blender and make the batter.. then while those are cooking, find whatever you have in the fridge (I used red bell pepper, mushroom, crushed garlic, cream cheese, sliced deli ham, sliced yellow onion) to make the filling. The cream cheese really added a nice creamy texture and made it kind of saucy. If I had some cream and Parmesan I probably would have used that.. but it was yumm!!!

Helpful recipe idea because it is fast, easy, versatile, flexible, and dependable.  As-is it is great tasting, too.  I have substituted whole eggs for egg whites and rolled oats for instant with good results.  Thanks for the inspiration!

i think the items contained within would be better without the wrap (it just is a little unnecessary), but overall the recipe tastes good.

I used Old Fashioned oats and was afraid they may not make a good texture so I tossed them in the food processor and essentially made oat flour.  Then I added the cottage cheese to smooth out the curds.  I couldn't see dirtying another appliance so I added my 2 whole eggs and spices and about 2 tbs of water and whirled away for about 30 seconds.  My filling was asparagus, mushrooms, a handful of diced onion and 1 clove minced garlic sauteed in 1 tbs EVOO  When cooked I turned off the heat, added 1/2 cup grated Jarlsburg and covered the pan while I made the pancakes.  What a great Lenten dinner with a salad.  Thanks Linda!

I make these with only the top 3 ingredients and put a little agave syrup on them, I usually don't blend in a blender.   Great with some fruit in them

Took some convincing of my husband to try this, but I thought it turned out great. I didn't want to buy the bacon or feta for this so I substituted other meat/cheese I had. Next time I think I'll saute the spinach for a couple seconds before adding. I think this recipe is very customizable with different meats, cheeses and vegetables. Very good!

Loved this! Hearty, satisfying and delicious. This is a keeper. A good base from which to start creatively adding your own ingredients. For my first go at it, I substituted ingredients I had on hand: minced some broccoli instead of spinach, smoked turkey lunch meat instead of Canadian bacon, sharp cheddar instead of feta. Used "Mom's Best Quick Cook Oatmeal" and cottage cheese and the whole egg, instead of only whites. Delish!

This is a delicious recipe for savory pancakes!!! I used different filling: sun dried tomatoes, cheese, olives and artichokes. Thanks.

Yummy! Loved it. I did convert to a serving of six and only "sort of" stuck to the ingredient measurements from there, so I'm not sure the ratio's were perfect, but the batter still came out delicious (if a bit thick). 
I did not have instant oatmeal, but processed quick cooking oats into a rough flour. Also did not add the bacon as I made it for a Meatless Monday meal. Furthermore I chose Danish style feta with the spinach to make the filling a bit creamier.

Next time I'll make the actual pancakes a bit thinner though and my husband suggests a cheese sauce with the filling or a bechamel as it was slightly dry for his taste.
