My work was having Hawaiian day and I had to find a quick tropical inspired dessert recipe. I came across this one and modified it as follows: substituted orange juice for water, no nuts, 2 teaspoons butter extract instead of rum and coconut. I also made a frosting since this is more of a cupcake recipe than a muffin recipe. My frosting consisted of a tub of Duncan Hines vanilla frosting with 1/4 cup orange juice added plus a splash of dark rum. For decoration, I toasted coconut and added on top of the cupcakes. Overall my cupcakes were a yummy success!
