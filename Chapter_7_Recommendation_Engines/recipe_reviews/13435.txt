The soup was excellent, but next time I will leave out the pasta....gets too mushy.  I'll prepare my pasta and then everyone can add however much pasta they want to their individual bowls.

Thank you for the great recipe! It tasted awesome!! However, I did use some of the suggestions left by others. I added some Tabasco (Which added to the flavor,and didnt give a big kick). I also added a few Bay Leaves, and then made the noodles seperately. Due to the soup simmering. It wouldve made the noodles way too mushy. I also made grilled cheese to go with it. Just a really good recipe.

This has turned out to be one of our favorite soup recipes. What I like to do is add a browned and cut-up sirloin steak,   a bay leaf, basil, garlic and oregano.   Quick, easy, hearty and delicious! Thanks, Lalena.

Yum! I browned some stew meat seasoned with Montreal steak seasoning, browned onion and celery and threw all the ingredients in the crock pot, except for the pasta. Preboiled
 the pasta and added at the end.

I changed the recipe and added 6 cups of beef broth. I also omited the vegtables and I added frozen vegtable mix, can of diced potatoes, and chopped up onion.  I used no yolk egg noodles. I also added 4 tablespoons of tabasco sauce. I sprinkled parmeson cheese on the top. Very yummy.

This soup was excellent! I did make a few changes to the recipe:  -Added 1.5 pounds stew beef, chopped into bite-size pieces. (Next time will try venison!)  -Used a full box of pasta shells, about 4 cups. (Make sure to cook pasta separately and mix into each individual bowl or you will have no broth.) -Increased potatoes and carrots.  -Added frozen peas. (1 cup) -Added at LEAST two tbsp minced garlic.  All in all, I am VERY happy with this soup. I wasn't sure if my 12 year old step-son would eat the soup because it had so many vegetables in it, but he at THREE huge bowls of it. Thanks so much for the awesome recipe!

This was good and I will make it again with some adjustments. I prefer more tomato taste and less broth. I added Italian Seasoning and the flavor was good. Just not a 5 star for me.

Wow, this is really good!  I used the corn, green beans and tomatoes from my garden.  The only thing I did different was I added Creole Seasoning.  We ate grilled cheese sandwiches with it as one person suggested.  Yummmy!  My 6 and 4 year olds ate this right up!

This was so delicious!  I love this recipe.  I let mine cook though for about 6 hours before adding any veggies and potatoes.  The base for the soup was delicious.

Awesome soup.  You can add almost any vegetable to it and it tastes great.  I added a little too much pasta but it still turned out great, just a little thicker soup.

We love it. I simmer stew meat to add and also put in mushrooms and a few dashes of seasoning. The kids love when I use the Crazy Mac vegetable pasta. I just add it before serving so it's not mushy. I usually can some for later in the week.

This is a good solid soup loaded with veggies. I sauteed onion, garlic and celery before I  added rest of the ingredients. I also omitted the potato, personal preference. Good with warm crusty rolls on a cold day.

This is an all-time favorite soup in our household now!  My fiance gave me the greatest compliment he's ever given me....He said it tasted just like something his grandmother would have cooked up. I did deviate from the recipe a bit, but not much.  I used ground turkey instead of beef to lower the fat and calories, and took the suggestion of adding a bit of hot sauce. (About 3/8 of a teaspoon) But to add a little spice and pep I also added Celery Seed, Lemon Pepper and Cumin to spice up to both the meat and the soup itself.  Just a pinch or two of the three spices in the meat when cooking, and about a quarter teaspoon in the soup while it cooks.  My Fiance has grown so fond of this (As well as myself) that we now make double batches to freeze.  The spices freeze well, and pep up a bit more when warmed back up, perfect for a rainy or cold day.

Good just after making but better after sitting in fridge a few days.  I used Kitchen Basics Beef Stock, swapped peas for the green beans and used fresh corn. Cooked about half a cup of orzo in the soup then added the shells which were cooked out of the soup. Added a bag of frozen chopped spinach, a can of Ranch Style beans, and a little browning sauce to punch up the color. Great way to clean out the pantry, fridge and freezer.

This was very yummy.  I followed all directions as is.  Instead of beans I used frozen peas.  However, you really couldn't taste the "beefy flavor."  It was seasoned fine with the proper things, but perhaps next time I will add actually beef as suggested.  This was gobbled up by the whole family.  Will make again.

This recipe was REALLY bland.  It'd probably have more flavour if I used chicken broth instead of the beef broth.

This is really good with all the veggies, and easy too!  I used canned corn, frozen green beans, and chicken broth.  I also added a pound of cooked ground beef, which added a lot of flavor.  Yummy!

I'm so glad I chose this recipe.  I did have to make a few minor changes.  I had to mix beef and chicken broth. I used 1-10 oz. can diced tomatoes and 1-10 oz. can original rotel. I added browned ground sirloin and some garlic.  I didn't have potatoes so I threw in some frozen hash brown patties.  My husband, who usually doesn't like leftovers, wanted this several days for his lunch.  None went to waste.  Thanks for sharing.

Fast and easy ! Yummy!  I did add a pound of ground beef mini meat balls ( size of marbles) Fun job for the kids. Just added some bread crums, seasoned salt and Italian spices to the meat. Bround them and tossed them in with the rest of the stock.  The wife was very pleased :)

This was a great hearty soup! My husband loves things that are tomatoey so he was very pleased. I didn't have any celery so just increased the other amounts and used canned beans as fresh were not so great and you wouldn't know the difference. Made a fresh loaf of bread to complete the meal.
P.S. The cheese really makes the difference--don't leave it out!

This  is terrific!  I added about 1/3 lb. beef strips and used 3/4 cup alphabet noodles as I have so many on hand.  I think it would be a great base for Maryland crab soup, too.

Good recipe!  I added some stew beef for variety -used no salt added tomatoes and left the salt out from the recipe - the broth and tomato sauce give it plenty of salt.  I also added some mushrooms and some chinese garlic spice!  I will make this one again!  Thanks.

I add the easy melt cheddar/american cheese for my
children and they gobble this up!  It is by far the most requested soup in the house.  What a great way to get kids to eat their veggies!  Serve with toasted garlic bread...yum.

I used a seasoned and sautéed sirloin steak.   All vegetables I used were fresh not frozen or canned. I did add two tablespoons of worcestershire, and a splash of tobacco along with some fresh thyme, basil, and parsley (parsley was added at the end of cooking).  I found that 4 oz of a stout beer gave the broth a great bouncy and richer flavor.  I would recommend Better Than Bouillon beef base.  :)

Super easy!  I used “Better than Bullion” Beef because I had no broth, and would reduce the bullion amt next time...just broth may be better.

This is excellent soup. . I followed the recipe. I.added 2 beef marrow bones to the broth for extra flavor.  When cooking  low salt, added seasoning helps to make up for  the loss of salt. I added a bay leaf for this reason.

My husband and I loved this soup. I didn't follow the recipe exactly but it turned out great. I used 6 cups of beef broth and it turned out to be a LOT more liquid than I thought. 10 cups could have been too much for us. Definitely would recommend this recipe. Quick, easy, and delicious!

I used 8 cups of beef broth, 2 cups of vegetable broth, added a pound of ground sirloin, one teaspoon of both thyme and garlic salt and a few shakes of tobasco sauce and it was awesome!! Great soup and I will definitely be making it again and again.

This is very good, my family loved it! I did make a few minor changes such as leaving out the pasta and the cheese. I added extra veggies and added some roast beef, also I added two packets of brown gravy mix (made the gravy then added it). Really an awesome soup!!!

I made this for the first time today and my husband LOVED IT!!! I didn't have any tomato sauce and since I noticed that some reviewers were adding Italian seasoning, I used some jar pasta sauce.  I added some beef (all I had was a nice T-bone) cut up finely and used suggestion to add some chicken bullion as well.  I also followed suggestion for pepper flakes since my husband likes a bit of a kick.  It was amazing! I halved the recipe and it's still a lot but I know he will eat it.  So much healthier than my cream soups.  Stuck with frozen corn and beans for less sodium and I don't have access right now to fresh.  Will definitely make this many times!

This was very good! So simple and delicious. Love the beefy flavor without actually having meat in it. Love that it's made with ingredients I pretty much always have on hand, or that can be easily subbed (like a bag of frozen mixed veg). I will definitely make this again!

I've been looking 4 a soup recipe 4 a long time now and I ran across this one.....I followed the recipe exactly how it was written and it was wonderful I just added a chuck roast
 for the meat and I added exactly 10 cups of beef broth 
because without the 10 cups of broth the noodles absorb 
all the broth up then it's not really a soup anymore it's jus dry so please if yu try this recipe add the 10 cups.....Thanks 4 this recipe ;-)

This was my first attempt at making soup and I really hit it on the head with this recipe. First - the house smelled wonderful! I read most of the other comments and followed the advice and did a few things differently. I added 2 bay leaves and I used fresh corn instead of frozen. I also cooked the pasta separately a stock/water combination. The only thing that took longer for me was the simmering time. I felt the vegetables were not soft enough at 30 minutes and simmered them for 1.5 hours. Yum - and thanks for a great recipe.

Made this soup with ground beef, and canned corn.  The corn was put in at the last minute.  Very good recipe, although some spices could have been put in such as oregano, thyme, or basil.  Just not sure how much, little, or otherwise

Very easy and quick to make. I did make some changes for my growing boys. I added 1 lb of ground beef cooked with 1 tbsp of drid Italian seasoning and 1 packed of Italian dressing mix. The tomatoes used all had seasoning (garlic, oregano, basil, etc.) I omitted the last 4 ingrediants of the recipe because the salt and pepper were not needed and we had pasta for lunch, I did not want it for dinner. My three boys(7 month old, 19 month old and 6 year old) loved the soup. This is a keeper. I served it with the corn muffins I from this site. Thank you for the recipe.

I basically didn't change a thing, just added some italian seasoning and that was it. So, If I wanted a vegetable beef soup or maybe a stew then I would use this recipe and add some meat......... This is a keeper

Very good, although next time I will add more broth.  There just wasn't enough liquid, but that may be because I eyeballed the veggies.  I also left out the celery and added peas based on personal preferance.

This is a very good soup. I changed out a few things, used canned green beans, added veggies, omitted pasta, etc. Paired this with grilled cheese and bacon sandwiches for a nice, light meal.

I made homemade broth with a leftover beef bone and some onion and celery.  After simmering for about 3 hours, I took the bone out, and added 2 cans diced tomatoes, more onion, celery, carrot, some leftover sloppy joe ground beef, and garlic powder.  after several hours, we added 3 chopped potatoes and adjusted seasonings, including some Italian herbs.  Some of the best soup I've made this year!!

This was pretty good, but needs a little something extra to really make it top notch.  I'd add some italian seasoning or garlic, or maybe some ground beef as suggested in another post to add more flavor.

This soup is very hearty, we enjoyed it! I think I might leave out the celery next time just as a personal preference. A great winter comfort food!

This was an awesome soup! I didn't use cheese or noodels. Instead I put in cabbage, black beans, and stew meat. This is a great winter soup. It's easy to cook and has a yummy flavor and great color. I  have already passed this recipe along to my friends.

I added about a cup of fresh mushrooms and substituted crushed tomatoes for the diced.  I boiled whole wheat small shells separately so they wouldn't get mushy in the soup. As I did eliminate the potatoes (less carbs), I think I should have used less broth or, better still, added more veggies.

I put this in the crockpot for 1/2 a day on low and it turned out great.  I added green beans and ground beef.  I did brown the beef first, but because of the tomato sauce in the soup, it made the ground beef have almost a light pink tint.  So, if you do add ground beef, make sure it's just the fam and no guests are coming over. ha!
