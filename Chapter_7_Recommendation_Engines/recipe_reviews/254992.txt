Tastes great, but DEFINITELY needs more than 2.5 hours cooking time. The vegetables just are not tender after 2.5 hours. Next time, Iâ€™ll cook it on Low for a full 8 hours.

Fortunately, I made this with out having all of the proper ingredients and it turned out great.  I used sweet potatoes, 4 roma tomatoes, and kidney beans. My family really enjoyed the dish. It went well with the Trader Joe's Pumpkin Crackers crushed into it.

This was very hearty! I used precooked turkey sausage and put it in at the end just because I didn't  want the grease. Will make again!

Such a unique and yummy recipe! Next time I will try it with sweet potatoes instead of russet just to have some fun, but it's great as written too!
