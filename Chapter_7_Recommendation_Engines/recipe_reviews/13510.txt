Very tasty, adults love it. Great with red wine. I added a little of cream cheese to reduce the strong taste from the blue cheese.

I made this for Christmas appetizers and it was a HUGE hit with adults.  I served it with a late harvest Semillon and it was wonderful...three people requested the recipe!

Tastes pretty much just like plain blue cheese.  For this to really work I had to add 1 part cream cheese to 1 part dip.

I loved the taste of the blue cheese and porte, but the blue cheese was very strong.  I added a little cream cheese and extra porte.  I would also make half of this recipe next time.

I added 4 oz cream cheese to tone down the blue cheese.  My guests loved it.  It makes lots of spread.  I froze half of it in smalled containers to use later when I need a quick appetizer. It tasted great but was a strong flavor.

WOW!  This is a great appetizer, but watch out for the port!  If you let this sit too long it will self-ferment and become alcohol in solid form!

I made this at Christmas and used it at New Year .. it was really lovely.  I used organic blue cheese and butter, and Vintage Port from the holiday dinner.  It was wonderful and I will use it again.

I love Blue Cheese but this was way too strong. I had to add cream cheese to it to tone it down. Also, this recipe is WAY too much for a normal party. A pound of blue cheese (this rich!) could feed one person for weeks. I would half the recipe if making it again.

I made this for a football party and ended up throwing most of it out.  It didn't look appetizing, people tried it but that was about it.

I am a huge fan of blue cheese and was looking forward to making this to take to a Thanksgiving gathering this year (2005). It bombed. This is almost completely overpowering and of the 90 % European guests present only about 2 people barely touched it. It is in my refridge and is about to get tossed. Do not recommend. It was also very expensive to make.

I made this for my upcoming Super Bowl Party.  Because I was disappointed I read the reviews and I noticed someone mentioned reducing the Port.  I did not see that in the recipe.  However, I thought it was way too strong (cheese) and did not care for it at all.  It was an expensive venture and I will not be serving it at my party.

This was a huge hit at my book club!  You must be patient while reducing the port, but the end result is a wonderful spread for crackers.

I wasn't crazy about this recipe, and judging by the fact that it wasn't eaten much at my holiday party, neither were my guests.  It turned out an odd gray color, and the flavor was OK but nothing special.

Unfortunately, I did not read the reviews before making this last night, because the ingredients sounded so good.  Initially, it was was way too strong and a horrid grey color.  This morning I added 8 oz. of lite cream cheese (tasted it), rolled it in a ball, and covered the ball with minced walnuts.  The taste is much nicer, especially on a cracker and the color is more of a pale pink and doesn't look too bad in the nutball.  I would try it again, starting with a cream cheese base and then slowly adding in the blue cheese.

This is an extremely large recipe but it stores well so ?I made one batch and served it at three parties.  Ut was a big hit but it is important to note that it has a very strong taste.  I'm going to try it with a Blue Cheese Cream Cheese instead of plain Blue Cheese and see how it comes out.

A good recipe but feel free to cut back on the butter; it only serves for texture and the recipe as written makes you feel lie you're eating butter.
