I thought this recipe was very good. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of the bone in and I cooked it at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. Since making this dish was a last minute decision, I only had time to let it marinate in the ranch dressing for 30 minutes, but it still came out with a nice flavor. I will make this recipe again.

Very good and fairly easy to make.  I used fat free hidden valley ranch dressing and found the taste to be quite good.

This was a good baked chicken recipe.  The meat was tender and juicy.  I was disappointed in the lack of Ranch flavor though.  Since I was using boneless breasts I baked at 400 for 30 minutes.  I may make again since it was easy.  Only catch is remember to marinade the chicken.

I love this recipe...My boyfriend thinks it is OK...I mix 1/2 pkg of dry ranch mix with the parmesan cheese so you don't loose all the Ranch flavor...The mix adds a little ranch and a little salt flavor!!!  Definitely not lacking flavor....

Being that others said that the ranch dressing was kind of lost in the sauce, I decided to marinate in Italian dressing instead. Because the chicken was being coated in the Panko bread crumbs I seasoned and chose to use, I opted to take the skin off. Heather, the chicken was so nice and moist and my whole family loved your recipe. Thank you!!

Pretty good overall.  I added half of a package of dry ranch mix to the ranch dressing itself to boost up the ranch flavor, and marinated for 8 hours.  The other half of the dry mix I added to the bread crumbs ... this made quite a difference, we could definitely taste the "ranch" flavors.  I did cut back on the parmesan cheese and omitted the sage, as I didn't have any on hand.  It was tasty and very easy to make.  Husband liked it, and he normally prefers more complicated meals.  Whew!

We loved this!  We ate it with a salad that had strong flavors, so this was perfect as is--i.e. not too bland for us.  Husband says it's a keeper.  I personally like the thick ranch dressing because it coats and stays on to really hold the crumbs on, as opposed to a thinner Italian dressing.  The chicken is deliciously moist and we will be enjoying this often!  Thanks for sharing it!

Great chicken! That's not something I say very often. It's hard finding a chicken recipe that I want to make again, but this is one of them. I did make a few tiny changes. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and baked them at 400 for 30 minutes. For the breading, I used Panko bread crumbs and half a packet of dry Ranch dressing mix instead of the sage. The other half of the Ranch packet went in half a recipe of "Cream Cheese Ranch Potatoes." The two recipes seem made for each other and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal.

I made this for my husband & we both really liked it.  My daughter then stopped over & said the house smelled  good what did I make, so I heated her up a piece and she liked it so much she wanted the recipe.  I added it to my recipe box and will make it again.

My guys and I give this two thumbs up! I used three split breasts & baked it for a total of one hour, loosely covering the baking dish with foil for the last 15 - 20 minutes. Thanks for sharing your recipe Heather!

This was really good and had lots of flavor.  I marinated this for 15hrs. I used panko and added paprika because usually my baked chicken never browns??  Anyway this came out really juicy, flavorful and brown!!  This is my new go to recipe for baked chicken!! I did use chicken breast, 400 degrees for 35 minutes(used meat thermometer)

This was easy and really tasty! I didn't have ranch dressing so I marinaded overnight in buttermilk with S/P, garlic powder, and poultry seasoning. Also, used panko bread crumbs which are light & crispy, and rosemary (had no sage). It was a hit w/ the family!

I liked this chicken.  It was moist and crispy and was easy to make.  I marinated the chicken overnight and when baking in the oven, I placed it on a rack so that the heat would surround it and crisp up the bottom as well.  I did feel, however, that there was too much breading on it and that the cheese was a bit overpowering (and I LOVE CHEESE). I like another reviewer's comment of putting it on the grill.  I think that is what I will do next time to see if I like it better that way.  All in all this is a good recipe and I will be using this recipe again.

This got rave reviews from everyone at dinner last night. Definately a keeper. I didnt have any sage, so instead used italian bread crumbs. Also boneless skinless chicken breast since thats what I had on hand.

I really like this recipe.I also vary it a bit in the summer--I use a little more sage(we love sage!!) and add it to the dressing/parmesan cheese mixture and marinate the breasts in it all afternoon.Then we throw the chicken on the BBQ.Super good-also works well this way with pork chops!Thanks Heather!

I used a personal recipe for ranch dressing (Semigourmet's) and followed the directions with two exceptions:  I didn't add any salt, and I thought it was looking too dry, so near the end of baking I put a little Italian dressing over the top of the chicken.  I think that made a difference.  I wish I'd removed the skin of the chicken or even just used  boneless skinless chicken, but I'll do that another time.  It was tasty, and our leftovers will make a great chicken sandwich.  Thanks, Heather!

Excellent recipe! Nice and easy, very flavourful and it was very moist and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except that I only marinated for 3 hours or so. But it was perfect! Thanks for this one. I'll definitely be making it again soon!

This chicken smelled so good as it was baking!!!  I like how the ranch dressing was thick and the "crust" stuck nicely!!  Very moist.  It did need a little more spice or kick of some kind.  I might try and use skinless breasts next time, so I can enjoy the "crust".  Will def make again.

We love this recipe! It was the way I got my kids to love chicken. I use corn flake crumbs and I do not always use the pepper and sage. It has become one of my regular meals.

Delicious!  Used boneless breasts, marinated all day in ranch dressing mixed w/ 1/2 pouch of dry ranch mix.  Used seasoned bread crumbs, therefore I omitted the sage and salt.  Very flavorful!!

This wasn't as good as I hoped. It was quick and easy, but not real flavorful. I don't think the ranch flavor was soaked up by the chicken too well. But, it wasn't bad.

Awesome chicken, Heather!  I only had a few hours to marinate, but 3 hours was enough.  Left out sage, since I had none, added some crushed potato chips, since generally my breaded baked chicken comes out a little soggy.  It was truly wonderful.  Moist and tasty!

I love chicken with skin on, but this is flavorful enough that you don't need the skin.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and added a little rubbed sage and black pepper to the marinade (I used cucumber ranch because that's what I had on hand.)  Cooked as directed, but my meat thermometer showed that the chicken had reached 165 degrees with still 15 minutes to go, so I took them out of the oven at that time.  It was moist, tender, and very easy.  Good served with green beans and garlic mashed potatoes.  Will try with pork next time (and maybe extra sage because I love lots of sage on pork.)  Thank you for the recipe, Heather.  UPDATE: I made this again using peppercorn ranch for the marinade. Cut boneless, skinless chicken into thick strips and cooked at 350 using meat thermometer to judge for doneness. This time I didn't have any sage, so used a handful of fresh herbs (basil, rosemary, dill, and I accidentally got a sprig of mint in there), and it was delicious.

It was a fast and easy marinade, but as mentioned, the ranch flavor is lost in the baking. 

I also used skinless boneless chicken and just cooked it at 350 degrees for 40 minutes. I also pounded it out flat and then added a layer of cream cheese. Then I folded it back in half and let it marinade. It makes the chicken much more tender and flavorful when it bakes.

this was not bad. i used boneless chicken breasts and marinated them in fat free ranch dressing overnight. i baked them too long so they were dry (i went back and looked at the recipe and noticed that it called for bone-in chicken), so next time i will cut down on the baking time quite a bit...but overall the flavor was good.

This recipe  just didn't jive with my family....the bottom of the chicken became soggy and fell off when I removed it from my baking dish. My son said to make "plain ole nuggets Mom" He didn't like this at all and he eats anything but mayonaise!! Thanks anyway for the recipe.

Really good, the ranch didn't seem to add much flavor even after marinating in it overnight. Nice coating over baked chicken.

The coating was very good, but as other posters said, the ranch taste is lost, but that was not a problem as the chicken was very tender and juicy.

This is my go to baked chicken recipe. I have used, besides the ranch dressing, buttermilk or Greek yogurt to marinate my chicken. The chicken always comes out perfectly cooked and super moist!

Surprisingly, I thought this was very good as presented.  Just remember when you use boneless chicken reduce both your temperature and your baking time a little to prevent drying.  Oh, I forgot I did add a pinch of dried pepper flakes to the marinade for a bit of "spark".

Great recipe. I used skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts so found little reason to marinate for hours. I also replaced the regular bread crumbs with panko bread crumbs which gave the chicken extra crunch. I will definitely be making this recipe again. It is a simple recipe where I usually have all of the ingredients on hand.

Made this for my mom, aunt and husband and they all loved it. Used skinless breasts, and did add a ranch powder packet, but those were the only changes. Mom wanted the recipe. Btw, made waaaay to much coating mixture. I used some smaller breasts, but not that small. Will make a little less next time.

EXCELLENT! This turned out so moist, tender and tasty. I made the recipe as written, except for omitting the sage and replacing it with about 1 tablespoon of dry ranch mix. I thought this had just the right amount of 'ranchiness' and I still can't get over how moist and tender it was, lol. I will definately be using this recipe again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I followed the recipe and marinated the chicken for a couple of hours.  I added garlic salt and garlic powder instead of sage and salt.  I also added a little bit of water in the pan.  The chicken was moist, tasty and simply wonderful.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thank you.

This was really good and juicy chicken. I do agree with others that you loose the ranch taste but I still thought it had a great taste. Marinated for 8 hours while I was at work. Will make again.

I get bored with chicken breast sometimes, until I found this recipe.  This is how I will usually make bone in chicken breast.  Other reviewers said the ranch flavor baked out.  I vacuum marinade and tumble with the ranch using my reveo.  Just the right amount of ranch flavor.

I loved this recipe.  Easy to make and delicious too.  Even the picky ones in my family loved it.
I tried it with pork chops (slightly breaded) and that was good too.  Definitely an add to my collection.

This was okay. Everytime I make a recipe that calls for ranch dressing in it and its baked the ranch dressing ends up getting greasy and losing it's taste. I won't make this again.

my husband liked this recipe and thinks i should make it again.  i just thought it was ok.  went well with mashed potatos and green beans.  I made it with skinless boneless chicken thighs and cooked at 400 degrees for 25 mins like someone else advised.  I marinated only for an hour, next time i might try longer and see if that helps me like the recipe more.

Really good--we love the taste of sage, so I do add a little more to the mixture.I also make a variation where I mix the sage,parmesan cheese,  salt and pepper into the dressing,marinate the chicken all day, then throw onto the barbeque.Great served with mashed potatoes or fettucine alfredo!

This was excellent. I used Panko and put the breasts on a rack, so they'd bake evenly on both sides. The only thing I'll do differently next time is use boneless/skinless chicken. The breasts being sold these days are freakishly large, to the point that I had to hack these in half so they'd bake properly. I still had to keep checking them with an instant read thermometer, because they took longer to finish. Frustrating.

This was fabulous! I used boneless chicken breast and marinated each piece individually in ziplock bags for four hours. I added half a packed of dry ranch seasoning dispersed in the marinade and the other half to the breadcrumbs. I baked at 400 for 35 minutes and they came out perfect!! I paired it with a spinach salad. As a college student, this was a fast, easy, and delicious meal I will be making again!

Easy and decent tasting chicken.  Next time I'll try boneless, skinless.  I forgot to marinate, but it was fine.

WOW! Skeptical at first I marinated the boneless, skinless chicken breasts overnight plus some. Followed the rest of the directions and wham-o, perfection. Easy to make/prepare and the reward was awesome. Wife and daughter said we needed to have this once a week. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!

Turned to this to try something different. The meat was very tender and juicy, but overall it was just OK. The ranch flavor cooks completely out (good thing since my oldest hates it), but if you're looking for more ranch flavor add a ranch packet to the bread crumb mixture. If I make this again going to have to add more seasonings to it as my whole family likes way more spice.

YES I AGREE WITH MANY OTHERS THAT THE RANCH FLAVOR IS LOST. I EVEN MARINATED THIS CHICKEN FOR ABOUT 10 HOURS AND STILL NOT TASTE. IT WAS OKAY. NO REAL RAVES THOUGH. I GIVE THIS A ONE STAR BECAUSE IT TASTED LIKE ANY OTHER CHICKEN. BLAND

I made this for dinner tonight and everyone raved! It was the most moist baked chicken I've ever made. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and really slathered them in the the low-fat ranch dressing (that they had marinated in) before rolling them in the breadcrumb mixture. I use "Jane's Crazy Mixed Up Salt" on everything so I added about 3/4 tsp. instead of the 1/2 tsp of regular salt. I'll definitely pass this recipe around!

I made this from a different recipe that was the same except no sage.  I also cut the chicken up into bite size pieces before putting it into the ranch dressing.  They were great, I called them Ranch Chicken Bites. I have 2 little ones and they loved them.

Good, but nothing special.  The other reviewers are correct - the ranch flavor is lost & seemed overpowered by the parmesan.  My kids liked it, my husband didn't....I thought it was alright, but not a keeper.

I made this for my husband and I and we both liked it! It was easy to make but the only thing was that the top of the chicken was browned after like 10 min. in the oven, so I covered it with foil the rest of the time. It turned out delicious!
