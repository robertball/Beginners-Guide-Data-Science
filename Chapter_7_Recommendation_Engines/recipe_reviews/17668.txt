This is a really good recipe.  I made a couple of changes, including using low-fat turkey kielbasa, mushrooms, garlic salt, red-pepper flakes, and a couple dashes of Essence.  I also omitted the oil and used a non-stick skillet.  Will make again!

Sprayed pan with cooking spray and sauteed sausage; drained as much grease as possible.  Put 1 large diced onion and one diced red bell pepper in pan with sausage and cooked until the tender; sprinkled with garlic powder.  Used 1 can diced tomatoes and 15 oz can tomato sauce.  Cooked whole grain penne separately and added in at end of cooking time.  Hubby loved it.

Pretty good use of kielbasa.  Someone was moving and gave me one so I tried this recipe.  I added a green bell pepper and some dried herbs.  I didn't have bow ties so I used another kind of pasta.  Good and filling!  Not sure if I'd make it again, but I enjoyed trying it out.

My mom and my husband loved it!  I don't eat meat so I couldn't tell you how it was.  I can tell you from the stand point of someone who hates to cook, it was simple and easy.  Thanks!

LOVED this easy recipe.  I did make some minor changes.  I used turkey kielbasa instead of regular.  I also used whole wheat rotini, a 28 oz. (undrained) can of diced tomatoes, fresh parmesan cheese, 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes and fresh cracked pepper along with the chopped onion and garlic.   I cooked the rotini for nine minutes separately THEN added it to the sauce (which simmered covered while the pasta cooked).  I added fresh parmesan cheese at the very end.  My husband loves this and it doesn't elevate his blood sugar at all. SO easy.  Thanks.

Super recipie! I added some things to liven it up a bit though. I added a cube of beef bouillon, along with some fresh celery, green bell peppers, and carrots. A dash of crushed red pepper gives it a nice kick as well.

I actually sort of combined two recipes for kielbasa, this one and Pinto Beans With Kielbasa with some additions and whatnot. First off, I omitted the garlic cloves and seasoned the dish with garlic powder when I salt-and-peppered it. Next, I added a diced up carrot and two stalks of celery, also diced, to the pan at the start. I used three 14 oz cans of diced tomatoes and no tomato sauce. I added a can of rinsed Great Northern beans to the mix. I added some Tex-Mex seasoning for a little kick. I followed the first step, then mixed everything except the pasta (I used large macaroni, about 1.5 or 2 cups uncooked, instead of bow ties) in the slow cooker. I cooked it on low for about 5 hours, then added the pasta which took 20 or 25 minutes to cook. It was wet enough that I didn't need to add any water. Turned out great, and reheated well. Thanks for a base recipe that's tasty and filling!

This recipe turned out really good! It was a change from the usual meat I use. My husband really loved it. I was looking for a way to use up my sausage. I did like someone else suggested by cooking the pasta seperate. This recipe actually tasted better the next day after the flavours mingle for a bit. Thank you!

I made this last night and really liked it.

I did make several substitutions though.
No oil, only fat free no-stick cooking spray. Used Healthy Choice Low fat Kielbasa. Added Green Peppers, Mushrooms, Basil and a lot of Oregano. Also I didn't have any canned tomatoes so I substituted two fresh peeled tomatoes and about 3/4 cup of water.  No Bow-Ties either so I used regular Macaroni. Delicous.

I'm sorry, but this was almost inedible and I followed the directions exactly, no substitutions or anything. In the words of my husband "I have no doubt of your cooking skills or ability to read, but that was the worst thing you ever made." We each soldiered through a helping of it, then took mercy on the kids and made a pizza.

While this was easy to make, it really didn't have any taste. Afraid we had to go out for dinner after having this meal.

Hearty comfort food for chilly days. Good alternative use of some sausage my mom gave me. We don't buy meat that much though but it's nice to have this recipe on file.

Delicious! This is one of my favorite weeknight meals because it is so quick and easy to make. I like to add a pinch of red pepper flakes for a little extra spice.

This was a really good meal and I loved that you can just cook the pasta right along with everything else.  I skipped most of the oil and got the sausage cooking first to brown it a little more.  Added a little water with the pasta, but didn't need much.  Also threw in some frozen broccoli and we had a very tasty dinner.

i thought that this recipe was good - only needed a couple changes. i sauteed sausage with onions and added creole spice with garlic paste. once cooked added tomatoes and sauce with a little garlic salt, cumin, and italian seasoning, salt/pep etc. cooked pasta just short of aldente and added to sausage mixture for 10 min to marinate flavors. added parm at last minute. was perfect and great flavor!!! kids loved it and asked to have it as regular weekly meal!!

This recipe is fantastic.  I included oregano, basail, red wine, a tiny bit of chili powder and two cups of water.  It turned out fantastic.  This recipe goes great with "Mom's Buttermilk Biscuits"  which is another recipe on here.  I will make this many, many more times, thanks a lot!

With my whole family being big fans of both pasta and kielbasa, this meal was a big hit! I did have to add a little extra liquid, and I used the tomatoes with green chiles to give it a little extra kick. This one is definitely staying in my recipe box! Thanks!

Initially when I made this recipe, it was too watery and tomatoey and tasted somewhat bland. It was so easy that I wanted to try again. This time, I halved the diced tomatoes, added a touch more water, and included diced bell pepper, red pepper flakes, and basil. It tasted much better and both my husband and daughter had seconds.

I accidentally bought two cans of diced tomatoes with garlic and onion and was trying to figure out how to use them. I found this recipe and used those instead of separate garlic and onion. I had to add about two cans of water to get enough for the pasta and I used a different shape. It turned out great! It was relatively mild so if I want it spicier I may add a little red pepper next time or even use a can of tomatoes with peppers. I also may try with grilled chicken or meatballs. I was able to cook it in my big round shallow pan (like you fry chicken in) and it was quick to make with easy clean up. Thanks for a great recipe!

Of course I made changes - using what I had at home.  I sliced and browned 2 kielbasa ropes in olive oil then poured off the oil.  Cooked the bow tie pasta (12 oz pkg) til it was almost al dente and drained.  Added the kielbasa to the pasta along with some dried onion and minced garlic.  I had Ragu Spicy Italian Style pasta sauce that I poured into the pot.  Added half of another jar of the same Ragu sauce, a can of button mushrooms with their liquid made a nice consistency. Warmed that all together on low with the lid on the pot.  This turned out great! The sauce has a great kick so glad I didn't add more red pepper.  Will probably make this again.

Easy recipe but to much tomato taste.  If made again, I would reduce amount of tomatoes and tomato sauce.  Add 1 beef bullion cube and water to sauce.  Adding just a little sugar helps reduce the tomatoe acidity.   One more tip, 1/2 tsp instant coffee will reduce acidity also.

I didn't have tomato sauce so I just used a little pasta sauce! and I had some leftover pasta in the fridge so I simmered the kielbasa and tomatoes and added the pasta at the end. Definitely a great idea to add the red pepper flakes! Yummy, quick, easy recipe!

I really liked this but it wasn't a knock your socks off dish.  It is a solid Monday night dish. I'm a big fan of making a recipe as it is first and determining it's merits from that.  This needs a little bit of help in spice arena.  My next revolution will be to add some veggies like peppers maybe and some more seasonings to help along.  So overall I'd say start at this point and add some things to kick it up a notch or three.  Try it's good

Very easy and good. My son loves kielbasa so I gave this a try. He really liked it. I did cook the macaroni seperate. I thought it would be to bland with tomatoe sauce so I used marinara sauce instead. I did add some garlic powder also. Mixed the sauce and macaroni together.Let it simmer together then served. I know I will be making this again.

Yummy!  And so easy to make.  I used no salt added diced tomatoes and tomato sauce.  The recipe has plenty of salt from the kielbasa and Parmesan cheese.  Be sure to cook the bow tie pasta ahead of time and then add to the recipe or it will soak up all the juice.  I had to add just a little bit of water so it wasn't too dry.  I also added a little dried basil.  Next time, I think I will use no salt Italian herb diced tomatoes.  Served with homemade rolls and a salad!

This surprised me. It was really good. It does need a little more seasoning but I like a lot of salt and garlic. It is a great way to use leftover holiday Kielbasa. It should definately be made with the bow tie pasta. I wouldn't change that.

great idea and easy to prepare. I did add a few things like a bit of red wine (never hurts!) and some garlic feta cheese to the Ragu sauce. Nice and filling and should make wonderful left overs! Thanks!

Different, quick, inexpensive, filling. I liked it! I only used one can of diced tomatoes and a half a jar of Ragu. Like others I did have to add some water. I will be making this again.

I have cooked this twice now.  I liked it a lot, but my family says it is too tomatoey.  Perhaps the tomato taste overpowers the kielbasa.

I had to add a cup of water to have enough liquid to cook the pasta. I make this recipe often. Very quick and good.

Wonderful!  My husband thought it was really good, I thought it was great.  I did have to add some liquid to cook the pasta, but I added tomato juice instead of water and omitted the addition of any extra salt.  I also cut the oil to 1 TBSP and used low fat kielbasa to cut the fat.  We'll definitely fix this again!
