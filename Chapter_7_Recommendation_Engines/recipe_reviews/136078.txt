Brilliant recipe! It was a definite hit and very more-ish. 

I made a couple of changes simply because of what was on hand - I grated Red Leicester cheese from the block and used light cream cheese. I also ended up only making half a recipe but it scaled down beautifully. 

I would recommend trying to grate the red pepper and onion - even though it turns the ingredients into a sort of mush, they then blends into the cheese smoothly and evenly.

I made this recipe ahead of time for a Christmas Eve appetizer. I didn't use an electric mixer, just good old fashioned muscle power. It was such a huge hit that I have emailed it to several guests who asked for the recipe. Super easy and delish! I may add a dash of hot sauce or a whisper of chili powder or cayenne pepper next time for a little kick depending on the guest list. I halved the recipe and the ball was still large...great for making 2 or more balls and having plates in various locations. An instant classic.

I omitted the bell peppers, and substituted seasoning salt. Great recipe, thanks!

This is a PHENOMENAL recipe and soooo easy peasy!  Brought to a party and everyone raved about it.  I only review if I make the recipe as written - note, you shouldn’t review or critique if you haven’t made it, because that’s not fair to the author. This one requires no adjustments. My only feedback is that it makes a really BIG cheese ball, so you may want to half the recipe or make two of them.

The only change I make to this recipe is with the  Worcestershire Sauce;  to me it has a over-powering flavor so I use one teaspoon instead of two. I've been making this recipe since the 70's -- got it from an old Kraft recipe book which I still have!  :-)

I have been making this cheese ball for years and the secret is to put some cayenne pepper in it (depending on how hot you want it).  I usually put in a teaspoon.  Every time I make it, someone asks for the recipe!

I always try a recipe first the way it’s written, thus I changed nothing. So good!

Tasty but WHEW the blue cheese, onion, and garlic made it pungent. Don’t eat this at a New Years party, no one will kiss you at midnight.

It was delicious, makes a huge amount. I think next time I will use only 8oz. of cheddar. I thought the ingredient listing for the cheddar was confusing. Why put" 2(8 Oz's)"? Why not 16oz?
