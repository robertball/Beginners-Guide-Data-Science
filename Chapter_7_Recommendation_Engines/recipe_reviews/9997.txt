I have finally found the perfect almond crescent recipe!  My grandmother used to make these and up until now, I could never find a recipe that tasted like hers. Let's just say that if you like the butter cookies that you buy in the tins, you will absolutely LOVE these!  I did make one slight adjustment.  I didn't have any vanilla beans for the sugar so just used powdered sugar.  Then, I added 1/4tsp vanilla and 1/4tsp almond extract to the cookie dough.

Bake at 375 degrees and they come out perfectly.  Mixing the vanilla sugar with regular sugar does make it stick better. Great cookie that melts in your mouth.

This is the same basic recipe that my Oma made all her life except that she used walnuts. I've been making these for many years and just let my Kitchen Aid do the work. The eight to ten minute baking time is off tho. At 325 the cookies should bake for fifteen to twenty minutes. Because they're such a delicate cookie, I let them cool completely before I start to dip them into the sugar. I use regular granulated sugar as powdered tends to yellow and disappear into the cookie. Thanks Christiane for passing on this wonderful recipe.

This is the recipe I have been looking for. My husband is Austrian and I have been eating these cookies in Austria for the last 15 years and now I make them myself. I LOVE them and this is the perfect recipe! don't listen to other reviewers that tell you to add egg. All that does is make them tough. This recipe relies on the butter to bind them and they are delicate and superb! thanks for sharing this family treasure, Christiane.

This is very popular Christmas cookie in Germany.  You need to add a pinch of salt, and eggs depending on how many cookies you make.

These cookies taste delicious! As obvious in the recipe, this is a very buttery dough, which could be hard to work with. After cutting butter into the dry mixture, I scraped it onto a sheet of plastic wrap, and made a log wrapping the dough. I chilled the dough for a while before shaping it into crescents---but this could have been a mistake because cookies started becoming really lax and flattened out while baking. 
As the first reviewers suggested, I cooled the cookies on the baking sheet until they are solid. This way, I had no problem transfering them to the cooling rack. 
I will have to experiment with this but great cookies overall.

Very good cookies. Used 1/2 cup sugar. I looked in some Austrian cook books, the Temperature needs to be 375 degrees and baking time is 15 minutes. Also I did put dough in the fridge for 1/2 hour and made the cookies in two Stages keeping the dough cold. I am from Austria and made them many times before.

Absolutly loved this recipe I used this one in conjunction with another recipe for these cookies and they were great. Adding vanilla sugar and just a little regular sugar to the powdered sugar mixtures works wonderful and adds great flavor as well as the pure almond extract...Love this!!

I made this recipe recently to take to my children's preschool for United Nations Day.  I don't know exactly how this traditional cookie should taste, so I can't rate its authenticity.  I baked the cookies a bit longer than the directions because they were still so soft.  Even then, the challenge became to coat the cookies with the powdered sugar without breaking the crescents.  The cookies were very delicate.  I allowed them to cool just a bit longer than suggested though I got them off the cookie sheets quickly so they didn't become a scraping challenge.  Great flavor and a beautiful, delicate cookie.  Thanks!

Very easy to make and Very Delicious!  This would be great with pecans or your favorite nut ground up.  I just rolled them in 10X powdered sugar without the vanilla and they were still great!

Very good, authentic recipe.  I did have to bake the cookies about 10 minutes longer, but that may have been my oven.  I will definitely make these again!

Yummy cookies and so easy! 
At first the dough was quite crumbly and I couldn't get it to roll into logs. I kneaded it another 5 minutes and it was much easier to work with. Maybe I'll try chilling the dough for a bit first next time.
Will definitely make these again!

I absolutely loved this recipe, they are delicious and pretty! I made these because we learned about them in my German language class. I would definetly agree that you should bake them longer than 10 minutes and let them cool more than a minute before rolling them in the confectioner's sugar/vanilla sugar mixture. In the end they took a while, and patience when rolling them out, but they are definetly worth it, thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Delicious - with a couple of tweaks. Used my stand mixer using the large paddle to blend, also added 1/2 tsp salt. Then added 1/8 tsp almond extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract when adding in the butter. I didn't bother with the vanilla sugar - just used powdered sugar sifter for the final step.

This recipe looked very much like the recipe I always use but with ground walnuts. I baked at 325 but the cookies came out really flat. So I did as the others suggested and let them cool completely on the sheet. I will try another batch, add a little more flour and try baking at 375.

I have a similar recipe from my Norwegian Grandmother. She got the recipe from my Grandfather who was from Germany. She always rolled them in a sugar cinnamon mixture. I make these every year. It just isn't Christmas without them.

I made these cookies because my daughter had an International meal for Girl Scouts, in which her choice was German b/c of our German descent.
Everyone really enjoyed eating these cookies, but I did not enjoy making them in the least.
The dough is very crumbly so it is very difficult to roll into a log. I did attempt this by placing the dough in saran wrap and then I left the dough out on the counter for about 30 minutes to let the butter soften a bit, then I cut off a little bit and shaped into the crescent shapes.
I added 4-5 drops of almond extract to the dough and it taste great.
I would only attempt this recipe if you have a lot of time and patience on your hands.

This is almost exactly how I learned to make these in Austria, except that we used weight instead of volume measurements.  Absolutely wonderful...  I was taught to store them for 10 days before eating, but never managed to adhere to that rule.  Thanks for posting!

Bestes Rezept bis jetzt !!!

I was not sure if i should try them out since i know what a pain it is since the dough is fluffy :-) and the cookies hard to get in shape ! Amazing that finally they got perfect i'm sorry for not having a picture but those poore things didn't make it long ;-) !
