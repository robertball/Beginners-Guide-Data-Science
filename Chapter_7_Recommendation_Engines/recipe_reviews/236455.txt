Okayâ€¦ this was an amazing recipe!! A few substitutions though. After making brownies, I topped with a thin marshmallow fondant layer, then I used a peanut butter Krispy treats recipe to do the treats layer since I used marshmallows in the fondant already

these were delicious- and made a little different with the Krispy layer. My family loved them! I think there are a couple of mistakes though in the ingredient list.  In the ingredients for the brownies,  the list says 1 egg- but in the directions (and on the box) it said two, so I used two. In the list for the PB ingredients,  it says 1/4 cup butter, but in the directions, it says 2 Tbsp so that is what I did. Just follow the directions more so than the ing. list. I had to cook them about 7 min longer than recipe states, but I find that common with brownies to get them done all through. Very delicious!

By mistake, I baked the brownies separately, then put the pan back in the oven after I added the peanut butter layer. I think that worked out better because it allowed the brownie layer to bake a little more and be less moist (or appear less raw). I brought these to my family's Christmas party and everyone raved over them!

Seemed like a lot of trouble and dishes but the results were wonderful.  Talk about mixing two classics-its worth a try!
