I wasn't a salad eater til I tried this recipe.  I LOVE this.  I was trying to imitate a local restaurant's recipe and this is VERY close! I now crave salad with this dressing-AND I do weight watchers and as I calculated a 2 Tablespoon serving is 1 pt. I used Dried herbs instead of the fresh  and it was still wonderful!

This is really good. I added just a little basil. Way better than my regular recipe. And, it makes a lot, too! Use fresh spices. You'll be amazed at the difference.

This is an just an excellent dressing.  Change it up if you like to suit your tastes, but in my view it's simply perfect just as written.  I did use low-fat buttermilk and mayonnaise, but full fat sour cream.  Used fresh parsley and fresh chives, but dried dill. I used this for a basic, tossed salad. Hubs and I thoroughly enjoyed this dressing and it takes a lot to please me, since I grew up strictly adhering to and preferring a simple vinegar and oil dressing!

Awesome ranch dressing!  I used it to dip buffalo wings into so I cut the recipe in half and since I needed it to be a bit thicker I used 2/3 cup of buttermilk.  I also used minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  This was perfect and I'll definitely use this again.

I had some leftover buttermilk, so searched allrecipes for "something" to make with it. My kids and I are salad lovers, so found this and thought, why not? I did add one additional ingredient; about 1/4 tsp. of granulated chicken bouillon. WOW! It added that one little something the dressing was lacking!!

So glad I made this because I don't think I will ever buy salad dressing again!Thanks for another hit allrecipes :o)

Great!  I wanted to use this as a dip for buffalo chicken wings.  To make it a little thicker I reduced buttermilk to 1 cup and kept the other measurements the same.  I used 1 tsp. dry dill and it worked great.  Increased chives and parsley to 1 tbsp. each.  Added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice.  Perfect!  You cannot tell this is a reduced fat dressing.

Good and tangy taste, but very thin.  I thought there was too much buttermilk in this recipe and the buttermilk taste overpowered this dressing.  I had to add 1/2 teaspoon of white sugar.  This dressing would do nicely on a salad, but would not use it to dip veggies in.  I let this sit in fridge overnight before using to enhance flavors.  Next time I will use less buttermilk.

Excellent recipe! I make it exactly as stated; although, I have substituted dried dill and parsley for the fresh and it still tastes great! You will have to reduce the amount of dried herbs though. Even my teenage son loves this dressing and prefers it to the higher fat store bought dressings. For those on weight watchers, only 1 point per serving and this tastes SO much better than store bought low fat ranch dressings. Thank you for the recipe!

Love this dressing - it will be replacing the bottled stuff I normally buy!  So easy to put together and it is delicious!  The only things I did differently were to omit the chives since I never have them on hand, and I used dried dill and dried parsley (just use 1/3 of the amount called for though, dried spices are more potent).  I thought the consistency of this dressing was perfect, even if you're using it for a dip... but if you want something a little thicker (or thinner), then I recommend mixing up the sour cream, mayo & spices first and THEN adding buttermilk until it reaches the consistency you're looking for.  Great recipe - thanks!  UPDATE 2/14/14:  I make this recipe WEEKLY... I don't even remember what the bottled stuff used to taste like and I wouldn't have it any other way.  I now mix up all of the dried spices (multiplied) and store them in a mason jar in my cupboard.  When I go to make dressing, I just measure out the needed amount and mix with the mayo and sour cream.  I also never have buttermilk on hand anymore, so I just use lemon juice and milk instead.  Use 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice for every cup of milk you use and you won't miss the buttermilk at all!  My husband doesn't even like ranch dressing, but he loves this recipe!

This is amazing!!! It sure doesn't taste low fat!!  I make this all the time now, we rarely buy dressing anymore.  I use dried herbs and hellmans olive oil mayo.  Tried it once with fresh herbs and I like it much better with dried.  I also use dried minced onion as well.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!!

This is awesome!  Its the closest to store bought ranch dressing.  I did cut the buttermilk down to 1 cup after reading a review and I too have to agree that I like it better with just 1 cup of buttermilk.  Will most definately use this recipe for all my future ranch dressing needs.

Not the best ranch dressing I have made. Just OK. Too thick; I should of thinned it out like some others mentioned. If you are looking for restaurant style ranch, this is not it.

This dressing turn out better than I anticipated! I used low fat buttermilk, low fat (light) daisy sour cream but I scaled back on regular mayonnaise (used 1/4 cup). I used fresh herbs (chives, dill and parsely), fresh chopped garlic, fresh ground black pepper,  a sprinkle of rock salt and let it sit overnight in the refrigerator. It tasted awesome. Not that the dressing needed anything else but because I like a little sweetness, I added a teeny pinch of a granulated sugar which, to me, made the taste even better. I like that this dressing was essentially easy to put together and I can add more or less of the buttermilk dressing to thicken it up or thin it out. Being able to use fresh herbs is a plus for me, and more importantly, it is low fat versus the regular ranch dressing. Even BETTER? I don't have to BUY ranch dressing anymore! I can use this as a dip, dressing, marinade, etc. this is a keeper in my recipe box!! Thank you JPSMOMMIE!

This is a tasty low-cal version--I might reduce the salt a little next time though.

Perfect recipe for us! I skipped the chives (didn't have them) and used dried dill, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. I go through phases where I'm reminded by how appalled I am by all the extra junk in bottled dressings and I'm pleased at how quickly this from-scratch dressing comes together!

I used a very simplified version of this recipe - just the buttermilk and mayonnaise as a base, then added fresh pesto I had made.  It was wonderful!  A little on the thick side for salad dressing, so I may thin it down with more buttermilk.  Even before I added the pesto, it had a great basic buttermilk ranch taste.  I would definitely try it again with the seasonings indicated.

This is very, very good.  Just the right consistency, not too thick and not too thin.  The spices were very well balanced.  I had to use dried parsley and dried dill and it still turned out great.  Will definitely make this again.

Too much salt, and a lot of seasoning overall, but I'll try it again w/ the salt and herbs cut back ... the flavor was overpowering, but I think it will be really good when it is scaled back and more subtle ... thanks ... :)

WOW! I have tried a few ranch dressing recipes, this was great! I did make some modifications but even at that I think it was personal preferences. I reduced buttermilk to 1 Cup. Then used 1 Tsp each of subbed dried herbs except for parsley since that's all I had on hand. Lastly I omitted the salt, I just didn't think it needed it and in general I wait til after I taste things before I add salt to anything. All in all I have to give this 5 starts even with my modifications. The ratios are great and I think given personal preference of the reduction of buttermilk it's still fabulous!

After making this, I don't see myself buying the pre-made stuff anymore - with all the preservatives and sugar they add.  This is ultra creamy and delicious.  I only used the dried herbs, since that was all I had.   My only complaint was that it seemed like it was missing something -- I figured out that it was a little tang.  I suggest adding a tablespoon or two of vinegar (to taste).  That was the only missing ingredient.  It really increases the complexity and flavor of the dressing.

This has got to be the best Ranch Dressing I've ever had. It was a little thick so I just added a some low fat milk to get the consistency I wanted.  It is unbelieveably fresh and creamy.  AND LOW-FAT!!  I love it.

This was excellent. Just like my grandma made for her restaurant that I have missed for years.  Bottled is nothing compared to this.  I didn't use low fat anything (except for the buttermilk)...I used 1 tsp. dried dill and 2 tsp. dried parsley since I didn't have fresh on hand.  Just wonderful and loved by all who tried it.  I will make my own from now on instead of purchasing bottled.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

We liked this.  Didn't have chives so I minced up some green onions really fine.  Also added some shredded Parmesan cheese.

Awesome! This has a nice fresh flavor. I forgot to buy dill so I just added extra chives and parsley to make up for it. Wouldn't change a thing! About a million times better than the whipped oil and corn syrup concoctions calling themselves ranch at the grocery store. Try it!

This is excellant and I am happy that I have a "go-to" "better-for-you" ranch dressing. Made this dressing using all dried ingredients (because that is what I had) and reduced the buttermilk to 2/3 c. for a thicker dressing then left it chill till dinner was served. It is creamy and delicious and I enjoyed the dairy fresh taste. I compared it with my favorite bottled dressing and tossed the bottle which now taste funny to me after having this - no more bottled dressing for me. I'm not a big fan of lower fat mayo but to keep this dressing lower fat I used it with no regrets.

Very good, tastes better the second day. I add a pinch of smokey paprika for depth of flavor.

I didn't have buttermilk, so I used half & half, and since I had a lot of fresh herbs, I doubled the amount of chives, dill, and parsley. It's a delicious herb dressing with a ton of flavor!

Came out pretty thin, which is how I like my dressing, but not very good for diping. I think it tastes too much like dill (which will make it great for a cucumber salad), overall I'll make it again btu will adjust the ingredients to get a more balanced flavor.

I had to use dried dill (at 1/2 teaspoon) but followed the recipe exactly for the rest.  Unlike other reviewers, I needed to add a bit more lowfat buttermilk (about 1/4 cup) to reach the consistency we like.  It was excellent after making and I'm sure will be even better tonight/tomorrow.

We really liked this.  The fresh herbs really make this taste rich and not low fat at all.  Will make this often and try some other uses as well.  Used it on our salad tonight.  Thanks JPSMOMMIE!

Imade this exactly as printed. It was too thick and the taste was similar to low fat or fat free dressing you buy which I hate.  Sorry, I would not make this again.

This is the most amazing, fresh dressing I have ever tasted. It is just the right about of creamy. Nothing from a bottle can beat this. Thank you for sharing it! We'll never go back to store-bought again.

Love this dressing!  It's best made in a food processor or blender because it's a bit too thick otherwise.  I use freeze dried chives, dried dill weed and added a few drops of Tobasco for a little more flavor.  Whole family loves it and is a big reason why we're eating more salad!

WOW! 
So so flavorful and you cannot tell it's low fat like at all.  So much healthier and tasty than anything you can buy. Thanks for this recipe. I made it as is except I used dried herbs and adjusted the amounts to compensate for it being dried and only used 2/3 cup of buttermilk. Not too thick and not too thin. Perfect consistency.

Four stars for the original recipe.  Good dressing as is.  I have since made it a minimum of 10 times, each time tweaking a little here and a little there to better suit my taste buds.  I now use 1 cup buttermilk, 1/2 cup regular sour cream, and half cup light mayo.  I cut back on the salt, halved the onion powder, left out the chives and used 1/2 tsp. dried dill weed. I also added 1/4 tsp. Worcestershire sauce for depth, a pinch of sugar, and a tbsp. of grated parmesan cheese. When I'm wanting a thinner consistency, I will add 1/4 cup milk.  This is so incredibly good that I will never buy bottled ranch again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent...perfect consistency.  I added just a hint of splenda to counteract a little bit of the "twang" from the buttermilk...but otherwise made as recipe states.  7/11/13

I have been searching for a restaurant quality low-fat version of ranch dressing for a long time and have finally found it, here it is!! This is a must try, I used dry dill and parsley so I only used 1 tsp each. I did not use chives but would like to next time. Enjoy :).

This was a good dressing, but I am not giving it five stars because I was looking for one that really tasted like ranch, and this one didn't. I did not do anything low-fat, and it was still good.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as written except for the fresh chives because I had none. This is a thin dressing, but I didn't find that to interfere with the integrity of the salad at all. Yum!

Changed for Type 1 Diabetes: I made my own buttermilk using heavy cream, used real mayo, and regular sour cream with dried chives, dill and parsley to save money- no salt or pepper and it is great! We count carbs in our a family (not fat) -using my type of ingred. the total recipe yield is about 2.5 cups with .9 carbs per 2 TBSP serving! Love this!

Very good flavor--a bit thin to use for dipping vegetables, though.  We tried it with grilled salmon and loved it.

Delicious!!  I made this with 1 cup of buttermilk, and 1/2 tsp of salt (as recommended in the comments), and this is perfect.  I imagine it'll only get better after sitting in the fridge for a bit, but even just-made, it's great!

OMG!!!!!!!! This was so good. I will never go back to store bought dressing and this tastes like the kind that they serve in fancy restuarants. I even made a double batch and had some left over that I will take to my mom's. She likes french dressing on her salad BUT she likes Ranch on her veggies. Too awesome, thanks so much for the recipe! I did not have fresh herbs so used dried ones and it was still awesome!

I made this dressing for dinner one night and it was good, but then the remainder set in the fridge for 2 days and then I had some on a lunch salad and it was amazing!!! My only change was to use all dried herbs and half the dill. Although it was very liquidy after 2 days it was still really good.

I just made some butter for the first time and had leftover buttermilk. I found this recipe and sure am glad I did. It is so delicious. I used the freshest herbs I could find to add to it and it came out great. I will agree with some other cooks that it is a bit thin; perhaps next time I make it I will use less buttermilk. Thanks for a great recipe!

This has always come out thick, like a dip. When I want to use it as a salad dressing, I thin it out with low fat buttermilk- wonderful!!!!  It's almost like our favorite bbq restaurant's dressing and we all love that one!

I prepared this without chives (I was out) and substituted a Dill Dip blend for the fresh dill. I also used fresh minced garlic and it turned out terrific. Will definitely make it again and was handy when I ran out of store bought dressing. I just might make this a staple in my house.

This recipe is awesome! I didn't have fresh dill, so I used 1/4 of a dill pickle which worked well. I blended everything int he blender so it was very smooth... I think next time I might use more buttermilk and less mayo, since I like it more runny. Otherwise an excellent recipe! Better than the packets you get at the store.

Just made it and it tastes good! I cut the portions down a bit so it would fit in my bottle without extra. I didn’t feel the need to alter the recipe in any way other than that. This ones a keeper!

This is a good, thick ranch  dressing.  I used a little more sour cream than the recipe called for and it gave it a little extra thickness.  I like that everything in this dressing is straightforward and natural.  Another plus is that it doesn't have that oily consistency that a lot of store bought ranch dressings have. Will make this again.

This tasted fabulous and makes a large batch. Two stars for the watery consistency. Completely ruined the salad. The fresh herbs settled to the bottom of the dressing bottle bc it was so watery. I tried adding cornstarch as thickener but it didn't do a thing. Used full fat everything. Would reduce buttermilk to 1/2 cup next time and post second review. Lots of potential with the flavor.

I'm glad I found this easy Ranch Dressing recipe...  Someone had given me some buttermilk, but only 1 1/4 cups worth, so I increased the mayo & sour cream to 3/4 cups each, hoping for a creamy dressing as described.  I didn't have any onion powder, so I substituted 1 tsp Mrs. Dash - original and omitted the salt.  I added 2 tsp dried Parsely when I realized it read 'fresh' :), so I added 1 tsp each of the remaining dried herbs.  I also added 2 tsp parmesan :D.    The flavor is great, but the consistency is like milk!  I was hoping for a creamy thicker dressing.  Funny, others said it was too thick!  What'd I do? :)  Maybe it was the prepared buttermilk?  Anyway, it'll work out. :D  Thanks

Amazing flavor! This is the kind of dressing that you could drink straight from the bottle lol I did reduce the buttermilk to 1 C because it was a little too thin the first time I made it. I use 1 tsp of dried herbs instead of fresh just because I have it on hand. Good stuff!

8.13.16 ~ Made this delicious salad dressing as part of a salad bar for a birthday dinner with friends. Of course, when I asked the other couples what their favorite dressing was, all four of them had a different 'favorite'. No problem, I just made everyone's favorite. This dressing has a nice flavor, but it is a thinner dressing, the day you make it. I found that the longer it is in the fridge, the thicker it gets. Thicker is what I like. The people who requested Ranch enjoyed this dressing. The kids even topped their baked potato with it. A nice dressing that I would make again. I would just make it a day or two ahead of the time I'm wanting it.

I thought this was great that I didn't have to use a packet! Tasted delicious and everyone at the table, including those of us who are pretty picky, enjoyed it.  It also tasted great with our grilled potato wedges.
I thought it could have used a little extra tang, so maybe next time I'll add a tad of lemon juice or even a little vinegar, but was still good without it.  Thanks for sharing!

Real good and easy for me.  Unfortunately, I used dry herbs since I didn't have any fresh in and I wanted to make the dressing immediately and I think it worked well.  I also added a little basil, since I love basil.  We do not usually use low fat anything anymore.  This stored well in my refrig for several days.  All in all a hit.

I did not make this a low fat dressing.  Low fat products are just loaded with other stuff that's worse for you like sugar and artificial additives.  I used regular mayo, sour cream and buttermilk.  It is very good.

This recipe was great. I have been trying to come up with a ranch/house style dressing for some time that mimics some of the boutique restaurants I have been to and nothing was quite right. This IS quite right. It could  be easily modified to adjust herbs to preference but the combination listed in the recipe is great. This can also be easily thickened or thinned by simply adjusting the amount of buttermilk. Everyone in my family loves it and I will certainly be keeping a jar of this in my fridge permanently.

For our taste, I give it 4 stars in the "light" dressing category ( i.e. not comparing this to the full fat dressings) .  Give this a shot...it's definitely very good.

Outstanding! I have made this twice, using dried herbs both times and it was delicious!  I am taking another reviewer's recommendation and keeping a jar of the premixed herbs in the cabinet. What a great flavor combination! I am thinking of mixing it in with bread crumbs and breading some chicken tenders. Thanks for sharing, jpsmommie!

Thought it was a little thin and did not like the dill in this recipe (though i love dill). I liked it but felt it needed tweaking - great base recipe though! I made a second time adding about a tsp of better than bouillon (chicken flavored, organic) and more chives and about 1 cup mayo (instead of the 2/3 cup recipe called for), as well as doubled chives and added 1 tbsp finely choped fresh green onion (the white portion), and put it all in the food processor and buzzed away. It came out GREAT. We all have our different tastes, so this doesn't imply the recipe wasn't good, it is good, but needed tweaking for what i was specifically looking for in a ranch dressing. And the mayo I'm using is Lemonaise light and it is AMAZING mayo! Oops...almost forgot, The second time I used plain lowfat Kefir instead of buttermilk for added health benefit. :) Thanks for sharing!

Everyone really enjoyed this.  I didn't have fresh herbs so I used dried (and cut the amounts in half).  I only used 1 cup of buttermilk and I still would have preferred it be thicker. I also cut the salt in half as reducing salt was the driving force for making my own. With that this recipe has only 1% of the RDA for sodium vs. 11% in the popular bottled brand.

I did not have low fat ingredients, it was a big hit with the regular buttermilk,mayonnaise and sour cream. First time I ever ran out of salad!

Made it vegan by subbing hemp milk, Vegenaise and Tofutti sour cream. The spices and herbs were perfect!

I even used a bit less than recommended and all I can taste is salt. Perhaps a quarter teaspoon would be ok next time. I'm truly disappointed because we are watching salt content and even using less than the recipe calls for produced terrible results. 

The rest of the recipe is good, but something like an excessive amount of salt takes it down a few stars for me since I have a batch of dressing that I can't even eat without endangering my health.

I made this using equal portions of mayo, sour cream, and buttermilk.  It would have been way too runny for our tastes otherwise.  I cut the recipe in half and used dried dill and parsley but left everything else the same.  I will make this again because I know my husband will want it from time to time!  Thanks for the recipe!

OK, I admit it, I always use a packet of dry mix to make ranch dressing.  Well, never again.  I was looking for a recipe to use my left over buttermilk and I gave this a try.  It is very easy and SO much better than a mix.

Wonderful.  Gets better the longer it sits. Fresh Dill is a must however; I don't bother with the parsley.

This dressing doesn't taste like diet dressing!  Love what the fresh herbs do to the flavor.  It even tastes great without the sour cream--which I forgot.  Thanks for the idea!

Good as a base recipe.  I ended up adding more garlic and onion powder.  I also used about a tablespoon each of the fresh chives and parsley.  I didn't have fresh dill, so I used 1 teaspoon of dried.  It was pretty good, but I think next time I'll use less parsley and more chives.

I thought this was just ok, I think there may have been too much onion and or garlic powder. Next time I will just use the fresh stuff.

I used full fat buttermilk and sour cream with low-fat mayo because that's what I had on hand.  I was also missing the chives.  I liked the flavor and consistency.  Definitely follow the directions and let it refrigerate for a while afterward.  I served mine too soon, but it was so good the next day after all the flavors had blended!  Also, it makes quite a lot.  We have a small family, so I might halve the recipe next time.

We love this without mayo and pepper, also just 1 cup of both sour cream and buttermilk.  Consider trying fresh minced garlic instead of powder.  You can also make your own buttermilk with starter culture ordered online.  Buttermilk is so much better when you can make it to YOUR taste preference!

I used plain yogurt in place of the buttermilk and sour cream.  This dressing tasted really good by itself, but it had almost no flavor when I put it on my salad.  I'm not sure what I could do to improve it, but it's OK as is.  My kids really liked it, but they haven't had ranch dressing in a while because I stopped buying bottled dressings.  I think maybe if I just cut down on the "liquid" ingredients I'd like it better.  My husband would have liked it thicker.

This is an excellent salad dressing recipe. My husband really enjoyed it and its consistency is great for dipping.  I followed the recipe as is and will be using it again but will add my tastefully simple bacon bacon and garlic garlic in place of the garlic and onion powders for my version of bacon ranch dressing. Yum!

I loved it! Creamy, flavorful. So far, I've used it on baked potatoes and green salad and it tastes so much better than bottled dressing. Oh...and it's also quite easy to make.

This was really good. I didn't have any fresh herbs, so I substituted dried, and it was still delicious, and improved with age. I did add about 1/3 tsp of mustard powder to give it more zip. Thanks!

This is so good!  I've tried so many low-fat dressing recipes before that were runny and bland.  This makes a hearty, thick stay-on-the-lettuce dressing that kicks butt!  This has an amazing flavor, but I will cut back on the salt when I make it again.  I think 1/2 teaspoon would be sufficient.  Other than that, I would not change a thing.

Made this recipe as stated.  I found it to be quite bland and I used all fresh herbs.  I added fresh garlic, more chives and approx a tsp of Hidden Valley dry ranch mix.

We loved this. The flavor is great. Mine came out a little to thick, but I think that is a matter of preference. I just thinned it a little w/ 1 or 2 tablespoons cider vinegar.
