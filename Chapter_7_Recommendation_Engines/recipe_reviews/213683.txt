I've made this recipe before, from a fantastic book I found at my library, so I know it can be awesome! I had some problems with this one, though it could very easily have been my fault somehow, which is why I'm giving it a high rating. I used unsalted butter instead of margarine, so maybe that's what messed me up? I followed all other directions to the letter and when I removed it from the oven, the matzoh had floated to the top! Anyone else have this happen? Also, my chocolate chips crystalized from the intense heat, so I would recommend a brief cool-off period just in case. This can be a delicious recipe, and I wish you better luck than I had! Thanks for posting, CC. :)

My husband and I are goyim and we love this stuff! I have to give it away or I would eat it all myself. It keeps well tightly wrapped in the freezer, too.

a friend gave me this recipe last year, I didn't believe it could taste so good!  It tastes just like a Heath Bar.  We acutally used saltine crackers and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Everyone loved it! Give it a try and you will be surprised!

I've been making this recipe for years but mine called for white sugar, not brown sugar, and it called for something like 5 minutes in a 400 degree oven.  I followed this recipe and the cook time wound up being probably double what it should have been so I wound up with burnt caramel -- yuck.  I might try this again but next time I know better.

We were doing a Night in Bethlehem at church and wanted snacks that were Jewish or period.  I couldn't find the matzo anywhere.  I substituted oyster crackers in desperation.  IT WAS A HIT!!!!!  YUM!!!!

15 minutes in the oven is way too long. Totally burned it!
