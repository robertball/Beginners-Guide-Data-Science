Try this recipe!!! I loved loved loved these cookies.  Best vegan cookie I have ever tasted.  I used almond milk instead of soy (didn't have any), and I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar instead of one cup of white sugar. Everything else in the original recipe I followed to a tee and the cookies were awesome.

I used a little bit less sugar and a little bit more peanut butter. I loved it! My husband who is not a health nut loved these cookies. He did not believe me when I told him I used wheat flour and no butter. I will make this again and again!

These cookies are yummy.  I'm not vegan but was craving chocolate chip cookies when I found this recipe. I'm sure the recipe is perfect as written but due to ingredients on hand, I used almond milk in place of soy milk, substituted 1/2 cup Truvia for half the sugar, used light olive oil in place of canola oil, and regular chocolate chips.  Delicious!

These turned out great and my vegan daughter loved them and so did I.  I did as others and used half white and half brown sugar.  I also used almond/coconut milk and coconut oil.  I bake a lot of cookies and always bake at 350 for 10 to 12 minutes.  Nonetheless I tried the first batch at 400 degrees for 10 minutes and checked them at 9 minutes and they were well done.  The second and third batch I went down to 350 and baked for 11 minutes and they were perfect!!

Holy cow I love these! I have never made vegan cookies before, but decided to try these out since we were invited to a game night at a vegan friend's house and I wanted to bring something. Surprisingly, I ended up absolutely loving these so much that I want to make them for all occasions now! I followed the recipe almost exactly, but I did substitute almond milk for soy milk and coconut oil for canola oil because those were what I had. I did not have walnuts and realized that my chocolate chips were not vegan, so I left both of those out too. I was afraid the cookies would turn out too bland but they were perfect!

The cookies came out delicious. I did not have soy milk on hand therefore I end up using unsweetened almond milk.

400 degrees for 10 minutes (or less) is best. Don't let the tops brown, you'll end up serving a crunchy cookie that needs to be dunked in coffee/tea. I could see changing the chocolate and nuts to other combinations, like apricot and coconut, or craisins, etc.  Still felt that it was a good cookie but would have to add "even though it was vegan".

Amazing!!!! Subbed the soy milk for unsweetened almond and used coconut sugar.  Also used sunflower oil instead of canola because thatâ€™s what I had 
Seriously perfect!! So so good!! Must make!
And I took the advice for 400 degrees!

My first batch burned even though I pulled them out a little early. The flavor of these are wonderful. I'm still baking the second batch, but I'm going to go head and turn my oven down to 400 and keep a close eye on these ones. Substituted 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar and used almond milk instead of soy.
 Mine spread so much so that they all became one giant cookie and I had to cut them into bars. Lol

Good taste! The whole wheat flour does not dominate. The dough seems a little dry and they don't spread, so for the second sheet, I made balls and flattened them with a fork like a peanut butter cookie. That made for less things hanging off and falling off when I took them off the pan. I didn't have vegan chocolate chips so I used dried cranberries as the second goodie in the cookie (not a vegan kitchen, but I have a vegan son-in-law, so I went with what I had). I may try it with the regular chocolate chips for me!

These are delicious! They are super easy to make, I did half brown sugar and half cane sugar and added a bit more coconut milk to help them not be dry. My whole family loves them, so does my husband's command.  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

I will definately make it again. Next time I will chop the walnuts and probably put foil underneath the cookies when baking so it wont burn underneath. Cant wait to make it again!

I stuck to the recipe but made some changes. I used olive oil instead of canola oil and made bars instead of cookies, which in my opinion is easier to make. My family loved it and is an amazing, kinda healthy snack!!

I used this recipe to bake with my kids who have some food allergies (egg and dairy). We substituted the sugar with honey and coconut sugar and they came out great. Kids enjoyed them and we mixed them with yogurt for a little sweetness after they were baked!

I made these for my daughter as I don't like her being at home at Christmas time and not having a "sweet" treat.  My husband and I both tried them and have decided they are really good.  I did turn my oven down to 400 degrees to bake them as 425 seemed excessive for a cookie.  They baked up perfectly.  Just keep an eye on them....mine baked for 12 minutes.  Next time I am going to add raisins in them.  Oh....and I really don't keep walnuts here in the house only pecans so that is what I used plus I used almond milk.  This is really a good recipe....

Unsure if it due to the oatmeal I added, the dough turned out pretty dry, so I didnâ€™t add walnuts. I also used coconut milk instead of soy milk. It taste delicious & like the crunchy texture ??

I added peanuts and craisons. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup sugar. I substituted almond milk for soy milk. This recipe was outstanding. My wife who does not typically like peanut butter loved these cookies! I have save these to my favorites and will make them again!!

I substitute the white sugar with coconut and the soy milk with cashew as thatâ€™s what I had and it turned out very good. I will definitely make it again.

These are pretty good cookies! I would probably add a 1/2 cup peanut butter in the future and maybe omit the oil totally. Also add in a pinch of cinnamon, that really tastes good! I would definitely make these again with those minor changes. Oh, and I baked these at 375 for 12 minutes and they were perfect. Thank you for the recipe!

I followed other reviews and also used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar but will decrease that some next time because instead of choc. chips, I used organic raisins and that added a lot of sweetness.  I also used coconut milk instead of soy and avocado oil instead of canola although next time I am going to try to use applesauce instead of oil.  These cookies are so good - everyone is going to love them!

Delicious! Used coconut milk instead of soy, and non-vegan chocolate chips (left over cupboard ingredients from a non-vegan lifestyle). 425 crisped the edges a bit too quick in my oven, might try 400 next time.

Iâ€™m not vegan, but I made these for a vegan coworker and I think they taste amazing! The only substitution I made was omitting the walnuts (Iâ€™m personally not a huge fan of nuts in desserts so thatâ€™s an ingredient I often omit) and added extra chocolate chips to make up the difference in consistency.

Pretty good.  It came out with a few brown edges like it was somewhat burnt but it tasted fine.  My vegan friend liked them!  I used almond milk instead and lessened the sugar a little since I prefer things to be not too sweet.  They didn't spread much so if you want your cookies to be a little less like a mound, preflatten them before putting them in the oven.

This was my first time making vegan cookies and they turned out great. Like some others, I substituted almond milk for the soy milk. The cookies came out with the best texture; crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Mine didn't spread too much and I placed them on the pan in a flattened ball to make their cooked shape like traditional cookies. These were really easy to make and I think I will make them again.

I used a 1/2 cup of white sugar  and a 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of 1 cup of white sugar. I used cashew milk instead of soy. Cook time I had to shorten to 9 minutes.  My family loved these cookies.  Recipe made 28 cookies!

I made these and loved them.  I changed the recipe to 1/2 cup of Brown Sugar, and 1/2 cup of white sugar.  I used Hemp Milk instead of the soy milk, and changed the temp to 400 cooked for 10 minutes.  Super good.  I like the added touch of the Peanut Butter.  Will make them again for sure.

I did not add oil as I am on a vegan, low fat diet for R A. I used half white sugar and half brown sugar as others suggested. These were so crunchy! Love, love them. Just what I have been searching for

These are amazing! I used unsweetened cashew milk instead of soy milk, olive oil instead of canola,1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar and used oat flour instead of the whole wheat flour. Put the oven on 400 since others said they burned. They turned out perfect!

Fantastic exactly as written. Almond milk works just as well as soy. Today I skipped the walnuts and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon because my daughter loves it. Magical.

This is the first time I made vegan cookies. They turned out great. To make them healthier, I used coconut palm sugar in place of white sugar and coconut oil, and raisins instead of chocolate chips. My eleven year old even said they were great. I will definitely make again.

Great tasting! My teens loved them. They are a little dry, so next time I may put in a tablespoon more oil for added moisture, or perhaps mash a ripe banana in the mixture. I used about 1/3 less sugar (combination of brown and white) than called for, and they were plenty sweet. Thank you for a delightful cookie recipe.

I'm giving the recipe five stars for flavor but only 3 stars for how the recipe was written.  I lowered the temp to 400 due to everyone else's burned cookies and some of mine still came out burned. I believe it is because of the oiling of the pan. I won't do that next time.  I will definitely make again though.
