The base recipe is very good. However, with a few adjustments I think it's great. First, reduce the olive oil to 2 Tbsp instead of 3 (you don't need so much oil in such a small serving). Thought it was much too thick so added more like 1.5 cups of broth. For most flavorful gravy, use an "unchicken" broth instead of plain vegetable broth. I think Westbrae "California UnChicken Broth" has the best flavor. Finally, suggest using meatless sausage patties instead of links -- I think the Morningstar brand is the most tasty. Defrost two patties, finely chop, and add to gravy right before serving. I whipped up a batch of gravy and served it for breakfast over biscuits. YUM.

A tasty gravy, definitely one I will make again.  The only negatives were that it uses up a whole package of fake sausage (that stuff's expensive!) and that I did the thing with the cornstarch and it turned out too thick to pour.  Next time, I will leave the cornstarch in the pantry.  :&)

I used two patty style vegetarian sausage in place of the links and sauteed them without olive oil.  Be sure to cook the roux until it is golden and fragrant.  That prevents a 'raw flour' taste.  I served this gravy over Fluffy Whole Wheat Biscuits.  Delish!

This recipe far surpassed my expectations.  I expected it to have the consistency of meat-based gravy, but to lack something in the flavor department.  However, that is completely NOT the case.  The only variation to the recipe I have made is using the vegetarian patties from Morningstar instead of the links.  Once broken up and added to the gravy, you really would be surprised if you could find someone who could taste the difference between this and a meat-based sausage gravy.

I love it! I added no-chicken broth instead and a full teaspoon of sage and it added a little more flavor. Also, combination veggie links and patties added more variety.

This is a great alternative to the traditional sausage gravy I have always eaten.  I took the advice of another person who rated the recipe and used non-chicken broth instead of the vegetable broth.  My boyfriend has never eaten meat and both he and I loved this vegetarian friendly breakfast treat.  Thank you!

This was good and very simple.  I made this without the biscuits once with eggs and toast and another time as a gravy with mashed potatoes.  My non veg friends didn't even complain!!

This is very tasty; I had been looking for a good veg gravy. I like to cook up some biscuits with it and top them with soy sausages and this gravy. It's a top comfort food in our house. Thanks!!

I made this gravy for my boyfriend that LOVES biscuits and gravy.  He's not a vegetarian so he was wary about it.  But one bite changed his mind.  Now he wants it all the time!

This recipe was sooooo yummy and EASY!
I used the Morningstar farms breakfast patties instead of the links. I also used Italian (garlic herb) Mrs Dash in place of the pepper and sage. I poured the gravy over reduced fat Grands buttermilk biscuits. A very veggie treat! :)

I was so excited to find this recipe!  I've been looking forever for a vegitarian gravy that actually resembles gravy and tastes good, too!  My husband loves this with biscuts for breakfast so much, I always have to make a double batch!

Delicious vegetarian gravy.  I used Gimme lean sausage and it turned out great for vegetarian biscuits and gravy.

Rated based on changes: Used 2 cups milk, not veg broth. Added margoram, sage, nutritional yeast and butter to the sausage as it was cooking. 4 heaping teaspoon-size spoons of flour. Served over buttermilk biscuit with a side of grits and a fried egg.

Wow, this gravy is phenominal. I reallly don't eat meat so I have never attempted to make any sort of gravy. I haven't had biscuits and gravy since I was a little kid and obviously I have been mmissing out. I agree though that the olive oil called for is excessive, I actually I have made this twice first cutting the oil to two tbsp then I cut it out all together and intead just mixed the flour and the broth together. I also added an entire 14oz can of broth to make it more pourable. Be sure to taste as you salt as to not over salt like I did. Enjoy!!

Absolutely delish! I used 6 mornning star farm patties instead of links and it turned out great! I also used grands biscuits to serve the gravy with and topped with chopped parsley. I did add a little more flour to thicken.

Wowie! What a find! DOUBLE the recipe if you have a family of 4 or more 'cause you'll need it.  Not just for breakfast either!  I put it on mashed potatoes and my daughter donned her lentil/rice loaf slices with it!  Word of warning, do not use any salt until the end. The veggie links have a lot of saltiness to them already.  At the point of adding the cooked sausages I put everything in the food processor and blended until smooth (or a lot less chunky) and it was perfectly thick and yummy.  This will please even meat eaters!  (I used 2-3 Morning Star Sausage Patties).

My husband loved this! I added thyme instead of sage and thinned it out with a little milk, which also made it creamier. I served it over biscuits for father's day, he said he has to have it every year!

I made this and loved it.  I used the patio since I had them in the freezer.  the sage was the kicker, plus I did add A little white wine.  I never understand we people put meat or fowl in a vegetarian sauce or gravy...

This was really good! I put it over some biscuits for breakfast. The sage is smart - the vegetarian sausage on it's own can't carry the flavor of this gravy.

This is a pretty good recipe. I made it to go with my mashed cauliflower. I made two versions of this and I did not add the veggie sausage to none of them. The first one was a meat version and I added Turkey bacon and the other I did without meat. My father loved it!!

I was embarassed to serve this at Thanksgiving, sorry! It was so thick and really unappealing looking. No one touched it. (we have a couple vegetarians including myself). The flavor was lovely though. I made it the night before and it was thick, but I guess overnight it thickened a lot more. I also instinctively reduced the amount of oil. I wish I had read the reviews before hand, because adding a lot more broth might save it. I also added dried thyme. I also ran it through the food processor becasue the ground up chunks of the sausages was just unappealing for a Thanksgiving dinner table. So, will try again, tweaking it becasue the flavors are so lovely and hope to come back and make the rating higher. Also, may have to make immediately before serving.

This was a great vegetarian gravy!  I served it over "J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits" for my husband for our anniversary breakfast.  He loved it!!! He kept talking about it for hours afterwards!!  The only change I made was to use Morningstar crumbles instead of sausage because I don't like the veggie sausage and used fresh sage leaves.

Easy, so very easy and my "meat-eater" hubby really liked it.  A little too salty for me, but easily adjusted.

i love, love, love this recipe. I use it every time I need to impress my fellow vegetarians. I usually follow the directions exactly except I add a couple other spices. This is a great gravy.

This is so good! I didn't have breakfast sausages or links, so I used a regular Morningstar patty, and it was so good! I like it over mashed potatoes or with sauteed mushrooms and over a patty like a veggie Salisbury steak! Thank you for this recipe!
