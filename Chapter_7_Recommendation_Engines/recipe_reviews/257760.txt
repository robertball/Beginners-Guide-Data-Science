6 10 18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/257760/oven-baked-supreme-pizza-tacos/ ... While these were good, I probably won't repeat - at least with sausage or greasy/wet toppings.  I was hoping for magic, an unexpected surprise, better than what I thought pizza in a taco shell be like.  Good, but not more than my expectations.   'Probably better with only veggies & cheese as the meat softened the shells.  The cheese on the bottom was a good idea - moisture barrier of sorts.  I cooked the onion with the sausage.& streamlined by combining the 3c mozzarella, 1/3c parmesan & 1/2t oregano.  I made this sauce with 'em ...  
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/20977/way-easy-pizza-saucebread-stick-dip/  ... Have the shells tight in your pan.  Mine weren't & they "opened" while baking.  'Not the biggest of deals.  Just a tip for ya.  :D ... Okay, okay, S said he liked; outloud yet.  Surprise.

Use hot Italian sausage and omit the optional red pepper flake. The only thing wrong with this recipe is the cook time. Although they tasted good, 12 minutes was WAY too long. The cheese burned, the sausage dried out, and they looked ugly. Brown food is good food and they tasted good but could have been treated differently for eye appeal. Start with 6 minutes and go from there. With that being said, this is a 5 star all the way.  Go wild and add mushrooms if you dare. I know I will next time!

These were just okay.  Stuck to the pan a lot, was kind of a mess.  Made as written, except no olives (we don't like them)  I probably won't make again.
