Reminds me a lot of the corn fritter recipe we (my friends and I) used to make when I was little, except we used flour instead of the potato pancake mix (potato pancakes aren't popular up in the NorthEast!!!)... so I just substituted flour for the pancake mix... awesome.  Thank you... I made them tonite for my fiance and his family as they have never had them.

Used a lot more flour & a little corn meal tripling it (at 2 servings), in place of potato pancake mix. I also used cream of corn instead of whole kernel corn. I agree with the person who said donâ€™t worry about left-overs, I reheated in the oven at 350 & tasted just as yummy. This does take some time to make, but is well worth it!

Maybe I just cooked it wrong, but this didn't taste anything like what I've come to expect from Corn Fritters.  It was uncooked in the center, even with fritters half the recommended size.

These corn fritters are great!!!!  Put a dallop of cinnamon applesuace on top to make a delicious contrast of flavors and textures!  Make sure to put enough oil in the pan, maybe an inch high, just enough to semi-deep fry them, this way they're not too much like potato pancakes.  They take a little while to fry, maybe 30 minutes or so, but it's really worth the wait.  And don't worry about leftovers, if there are any, because they re-heat well in a toaster oven.

My family did not like these Corn Fritters at all!!!  They were too oily, and heavy.  We prefer Corn Fritters, the traditional way.  If they were not so oily, they could have tasted more like Potato Pancakes, with corn instead of onions.  Incidentally, I followed the recipe to a tea.

Not bad, but my fritters were messy and did not stick together at all.  I would have added flour, but I did not have any on hand.  It also tasted more like potato pancakes with corn, which was fine with me. I would not make this for a party as it looked sorta gross, but would try it again for myself

Didn't care for these. I think I used the wrong mix though (Bisquick doesn't work), mine were more like corn pancakes.

The recipe itself is excellent. However, the oil heat stated of 365 is waaaaay too high! the oil should be at about 325 to give fritters time to cook without overbrowning. 
Mine came out too dark and raw in the middle at 365 degree oil.
