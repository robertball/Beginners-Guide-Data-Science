This is a great recipe and very versatile. I made it and my neighbor loved it. She made it but added one tsp. of curry to hers and some diced apple. It worked as well. We both served ours on triscuits. All good.

Instead of using dried onion and onion salt, I used finely diced fresh red onion and garlic powder. I also added some black pepper, finely diced parsley, some smoked paprika and some dried tarragon. I won't add tarragon next time as it over powers the flavors. It's wonderful served on a slice of ciabatta baguette! It's still a recipe that you can play with a bit. (I may also add some grated parmesan or cheddar next time)

I used reduced fat cream cheese/sour cream, onion powder instead of onion salt (as well as increasing the amount to a full teaspoon) and I added a teaspoon of garlic powder and some fresh ground pepper. The boys spread this on Reduced Fat Wheat Thins. Serves 12? Nope. They ate the whole bowl. I bet this would be good with canned tuna fish, too.

Very good!  I use mayo instead of sour cream.  Also used nature season, garlic powder, 1/3 cup onion, 1 tsp worst, 2 Tbls dill pickle relish and 2 hard boiled eggs mashed.  (Added the extra after tasting the original - minus sour cream)  Family loves it and has for lunch daily.  Hubby said it reminds him of store bought he had as a kid.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this with Tuna fish because I was out of Chicken.  I also mistakenly put in a whole cup of sour cream instead of half.  I am going to make it again properly because it wasnt that great the way I made it.  lol  So for now I am giving it 5 stars.  I will re-evaluate later.

Gool old stand by for crackers and sandwiches.  I used to cater with this and make it into little tea sandwiches.  Later tea-parties for my children.  Now I have lightened it up a bit and add lots of vegies.  It is delicious with grated carrots and fine minced cellery--no adjustment to the cream cheese is needed.  I use fresh minced green onion and also a can of finely diced water chestnuts.  My whole family loves it on sandwiches and I still use it every once in a while to make tea sandwiches on egg bread for parties.  Everyone raves.

I honestly thought this was a bit bland. Upping the cayenne helped a little but some diced jalapeno, celery and fresh onion would make this great.

sorry, tried this dip at a recent party.  Barely touched.  Bland - I used real shredded chicken, added some shredded cheddar.  Not a keeper.
