I couldn't find jicama, so I added some fresh spinach for crunch, it was great, I especially liked the dressing.

I make this recipe constantly.  The vinaigrette is fantastic, and the combination of black beans and jicama is near genius.  I often eat this as my main meal instead of as a side dish because it's just that good!

I doubled the cilantro, chilies, cumin and salt and pepper. Original recipe was too bland for me. But after modifications, made a colorful and tasty side dish!
