I made this in my pressure cooker which has a saut√© setting. I used chicken quarters instead and a few garden fresh tomatoes along with a can of diced tomatoes. I initially under seasoned this, but that was easily fixed. If you use a pressure cooker to make this be sure to place the chicken on the bottom and layer tomato sauce on top, otherwise the sugars in the tomato sauce will burn. My pressure has a feature that automatically turns pressure setting off if this happens. The chicken was so tender that I decided to remove chicken from the bone and will serve with tomato sauce over couscous for dinner. I find my kids don't waste as much chicken if I debone it. I kept picking bites of it, which is a sign of a good recipe to me! Reminds me of a chicken tagine, and I'll serve it with a side of steamed carrots.

Although this recipe is tasty I would like to try grilling the chicken on the BBQ after the marinating process, and applying a glaze to the chicken.
Maybe next time.

I made this for dinner last night. Naturally, I hacked it beyond recognition by using apple cider vinegar, boneless\skinless chicken thighs, and maybe half of the onion specified. It was still delicious served over basmati rice.
