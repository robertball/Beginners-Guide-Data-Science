easy and delicious!  Not too sweet as there is no additional sugar added.  All 7 of my kids liked this and aked for more-I will have fun changing from strawberry to raspberry-it seems like a pretty versatile smoothie.

Very delicious!! I filled my Smoothie Maker half way with frozen strawberries, dumped in a 20 ounce can of pineapple chunks with juice, a 6 ounce container of Yoplait peach yogurt, and a banana (about 9 or 10 inches long). I blended for about a minute and served with Twizzlers as straws. Just bite or cut both ends off and it works great! Try serving it in the skin from a fresh pineapple with your Twizzler straw and a little umbrella!! It will be your own little, inexpensive paradise!!! Enjoy!

Not bad, but too much pineapple. Too acidic for our taste.

Very good. I was afraid it would be too pineappley so I substituted peach nectar for the pineapple juice.
