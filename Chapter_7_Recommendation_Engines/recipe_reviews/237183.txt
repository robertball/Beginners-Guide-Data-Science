Fun and delicious! I brushed them with garlic butter right before I topped them with the cheese and baked them...sooooo good! These were a huge hit with the entire family. Served them with pizza sauce and ranch dressing for dipping...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made these tonight with the help of my mini chef (a three-year-old girl) who basically did everything. My husband loved them and they took 10 minutes to prep and 12 to bake. I followed the recipe exactly except I used garlic powder not garlic salt. Don't be afraid to really stuff them because the cheese that oozes out is maybe the best part. I think I will follow the submitter's suggestion and use it for cream cheese and fruit for a morning danish next.

Simple and delicious. Mine more so reminded me of mini calzones, but tasty nonetheless. I suggest less pepperoni despite how little is already required because it made them a bit salty. Also try cut up sausages as a substitute!

Super quick and easy recipe! My kids gobbled these up! Next time I might divide each biscuit in half to make more.  There was a lot a dough.

Made these tonight. The only changes I made were we included more pepperoni due to size (4 each), used string cheese since it was easier to place in them & topped them with butter, garlic & Italian seasoning. Turned out great - everyone finished theirs and some went back for more!

Great recipe that was super easy to make, the whole family loved it AND it made enough to fill everyone up (a feat not many dinner items can accomplish!) haha I have to laugh because my finished product looks nothing like the one photo on this recipe. But even if they do look a tad rough, they tasted good! I used the grands flaky biscuits that DONT say "buttermilk" on the can, was super liberal about our mozzarella (inside & on top) and used garlic powder (not salt) and then used another poster's idea of basting the tops of each with a mix of melted butter and two tbsp garlic liquid that I got from the jar of minced garlic I had in the fridge. Cooked on convection for 11 mins and they came out great. Will definitely make this again!

Very easy to make for a first timer. Husband dips the roll in marinara sauce. He also suggests more cheese inside. I'll try to roll some cheese in when I flatten the dough. I'm also thinking about throwing in some sauteed diced green pepper. Who knows, maybe simple is better. Also, it might be my solution to the ever-failed cheese danish.
