There is no real "original" Andalusian style Gazpacho but this is pretty close to most.  I lived in Seville and the part-time local cook made a much more bold version which becomes quite addictive, especially on hot days.  This recipe calls for about 2X the garlic and 2x the cucumber.  Also no cayenne. I believe a red pepper is better as it will keep the soup red and not brown. Here in the States I buy the Pomi brand chopped tomatoes (excellent low sodium) makes it real easy and they are flavorful.  This is the kind of recipe you can experiment to make it to your particular taste.  But the basics of this recipe is right and original to Andalusia.

Thank you for recognizing that classic gazpacho has bread in it!! Add a tablespoon of tomato paste for more flavor

A huge hit-- this stuff went quick.   I added a tablespoon of tomato paste (as per another reviewers suggestion) at the end; it didn't taste tomato-y enough with out it. I also added cumin to taste (maybe 1/4 teaspoon). Which it didn't need, but gave it a unique and totally delicious flavor.

this was simply put outstanding. I did make some changes. I used red bell peppers because I can not stand the taste of green bell pepper I tripled the amount of garlic I used a whole cucumber and instead of  cayenne pepper I used spanish paprika I also increased the amount of balsamic and added a splash of sherry wine.

I became addicted to gazpacho on a trip to Spain last year.  This recipe is very close to the soup I had while in Madrid and Barcelona.  I added some cut up peppers for garnish, but that was the only change I made.

This is the first time making Gazpacho and I found it lovely and very refreshing.  I peeled and seeded the tomatoes and added a small stalk of celery because I was trying to use up as much produce as I could.  That being said, I found the consistency of the soup a little thick for my liking so I thinned it out with no-salt tomato juice.  I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty, hearty refreshing soup. Not a thin/runny pico-like soup. I served it with some garlic toasted ciabatta bread on the side and some extra diced pepper, tomato, cucumber on top. Bright and beautiful. I did use orange bell peppers instead of green to keep the color red-orange.

Delicious! It wasn't like I remember gazpacho in Sevilla, but every place makes it different so it could still be authentic. It turned out a little thick, so maybe next time I'll add some tomato juice. I reduced the recipe to 2 servings, used 2 tomatoes and three slices of a medium-sized loaf of bread.

This recipe was a great base for Gazpacho.  My family loved it.  I used whatever we had on hand + bread.  Very good!

I really liked this recipe! I lived in Spain for a semester in college and this reminded me of the gazpacho I used to get there. I made a few changes - used red pepper instead of green, added 2 tablespoons of white wine vinegar, and added a little paprika instead of cayenne. I also used 1 large clove of garlic instead of 2, but that's just my preference. Tip - Make sure all veggies are seeded including cucumber and tomatoes. I like to serve mine cold with pita chips and feta sprinkled on top, yummm!

Outrageously good.  The bread is a must; don't skip it!  Instead of cayenne pepper,  I added two chili peppers, because that's the way I roll :)  Also, if you notice that the soup is little too thick, you can thin it out a bit with a splash of V-8!

Thank you! 

I prefer my gazpacho a little creamier with both the bread and the olive oil. I also like that it's easier on the onion. Also, not nearly so fussy.

I loved this gazpacho!  I haven't had one like this before.  I added an extra clove of garlic just because I love garlic, but be warned, your breath is going to stink after this. :)  I blended the first few ingredients as listed in the directions, but I used pulse for the remaining ingredients, so the gazpacho was kind of thick and a little chunky.  I will definitely make this again.

Sorry but my husband and I really, really didn't like this at all.  I made it as written and threw most of it away.  I guess I like the Mexican version of Gazpacho so much more.

So simple to make, delicious and refreshing. I added more chili peppers because we love spicy food. I accidentally added more garlic than the recipe calls for. My husband loved the garlicky flavor and requested to make it the way it was next time. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

This was really good, but I guess I prefer the chunky gazpacho type of soup.  I used Ritz crackers since I didn't have any old crusty bread, and it turned out fine.

The alteration I made was to add 2 times the cucumber. This is an excellent take on gazpacho. I will be making it over and over in season.

It was ok, I modified the recipe, didn't use the bread, didn't peel the tomatoes. otherwise followed the recipe, it tasted bland, (nowhere near Salmugundi's) so I added the other half cucumber, extra tomato, a touch of worchestershire, a large dash of Cholula hot sauce  and 1/2  medium shallot. It was still a little plain. I think I needed to double the number of tomatoes

This is really good - I use it as a starting point and combine it with a recipe for "Real Spanish Gazpacho from Spain" on Food.com. Very similar recipes - I use the red wine vinegar from that recipe and also the Balsamic from this one.  Main difference is the addition of onion, which I always like in gazpacho. Near as I can recall, this gazpacho is as good as what we had in Puerto Rico at the El Convento hotel tapas bar, which was awesome!

This did not fit in my blender.  I had to use a blender and my food processor.   Next time I'll buy smaller pepper and cucumber, and less tomatoes..   Or just plan on using both tools.   Tastes great though.   Has a lot of potential for tweaking the taste.

Outstanding! Every bit as delicious as that which We ordered every day while in Rota, Seville, Cadiz and El Puerto de Santa Maria. 
Many variations are available here in south FL but none as good as this, especially when made at home.

Mmmm, yummy!  Was looking for a recipe to use up tomatoes, and thought I would try this one.  Very good!
