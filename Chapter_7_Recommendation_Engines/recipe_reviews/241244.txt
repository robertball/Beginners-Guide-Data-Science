This is such a great, easy recipe!  Made as is, it's delicious;  BUT with a few tweaks, I made it my own.  My husband LOVED it! 
Okay, so my changes were really just additions.  I used  seafood stock, homemade, in place of the water called for, plus carrots, celery, and garlic  when I sautéed the onions.  I also added shrimp and scallops and one filet of swai ,which I added to the leftover fish I used to make  a red snapper           earlier in the week.     At the end, I  added some thawed corn.
I love everything about this recipe.  So fast, so easy, and also adaptable.
Give this a try because I know you won't be sorry!

So easy, and SO delicious!  I used Alaskan Pollock I picked up at 99 cents a pound, so even better as it is easy on the budget.  Kudos, and appreciation from Toronto, Canada.

This is a great recipe although I did change a few things due to the fact I didn't have them. I used pearl onions instead of chopping up an onion. I had 2 pounds of cod so I doubled everything except the milk part which I ended up using just 2 cups of heavy cream. Threw some other spices and celery and it was fabulous!

This is a great fish chowder recipe!  I used a pound of haddock, plus I added many of the ingredients others suggested.  I used 1/2 cup fish sauce in place of 1/2 cup water, added about 1/8 tsp Old Bay Seasoning, 2 stalks celery, two chopped carrots, and 1/2 cup thawed corn.   LOVE it!!

I loved this recipe. I did add 2 stalks of celery and some garlic with the onions. I also used heavy cream instead if evaporated milk as I needed to use it. I also added some old bay. The only direction that I would change would be to season the fish individually as the cooking time doesn't allow for all of that great taste from the broth to penetrate the fish.

Nice quick recipe.  I sliced a couple carrots and added them into the potatoes while they were boiling.  Seasoned with salt, pepper and ground sage.  I also thickened the chowder with a Tbsp of File powder.  This enhanced all the flavors together.  Nice cool weather, comfort food.

Definitely a keeper, will make often.
I used fresh cod (expensive!) so added a can of tuna (with its juice) near the end.  Wanted it a bit thicker, so did that with instant mashed potato flakes.
Now that I know how excellent this recipe, I can change it  up in the future by  adding shrimp or other seafood.  I will try with other fish.
WELL DONE!!

It was great.  I followed the directions exactly.  I will make this over and over.  My husband and I fish.  I might try substituting the catch of the day.  (All except catfish, that should be fried).

I thought it was a great simple recipe, very tasty. The only thing, I used haddock which is all I had, a can of condensed cream of celery since I also didn't have condensed milk. I added some shredded carrot for color and seasoned it with some thyme and dill as well as a few shakes of cayenne pepper in addition to the salt and pepper. The recipe is so simple that it allows room for you to experiment. Thanks so much!

Followed the recipe exactly!  This is a favorite in my house!  It’s quick, only requires a few ingredients, and I love the flavor and consistency the evaporated milk gives it.

My kids really enjoy this recipe. I make it a lot. I use whatever fish and potatoes I have in hand. I multiply the recipe for 8 people. I add thyme and bay leaves, chicken broth instead of water, and I thicken it with a little flour. Also, sautéing the onions in bacon grease makes it richer.

The flavor was good but thought it should be creamier and thicker.  Would change a couple things next time.  Adding a little hot sauce at the end worked for us.

I love it. I added mushrooms in while the potatoes were cooking. I also added corn (drained) and red pepper flakes to enhance the flavor.

This was excellent. I had leftover baby potatoes I roasted with garlic and butter so I substituted them for the russet potato and cooked it down a bit more and it was amazing!
