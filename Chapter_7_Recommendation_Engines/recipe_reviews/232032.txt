2014: Loved this recipe!! I did not think my kids (3 & 18 months) would eat this but it was a big success! Used fresh tomatoes & basil from the garden. I missed where it said to coat the tomatoes with breadcrumbs but I do not think it needed it. Definitely adding this to our pizza night menu:) thank you for the recipe.
Note 2016: I make this often and always use fresh spinach and our own homemade crust. Restaurant quality!!

This pizza didn't taste as good as it looked/sounded to me.  I thought it would be an explosion of flavor, but it really wasn't.  I'd even added a base layer of some ricotta/spinach filling mixture I'd had left over from Spinach Manicotti.   Don't get me wrong, it was good (and worth trying if it looks good to you!), but it just isn't one I'll be craving/making again.  THANKS for the recipe!

Made this pizza about 4 times now and every single time we've loved it. We've done little variations like using cherry tomatoes, Kalamata olives, and ready made pizza crust (the lazy way) but it always comes out solid.

Made no changes.  Would make again.  Relatively easy and very filling/delicious.  Could add kalamata olives, green peppers if you like.

Yum! This pizza is so perfect that when we go off script I sometimes feel guilty. Buying the thin crusts for the pizza that are ready made works just as well. It's a house favorite!

This was a tasty pizza. The spinach, onions, lemon, and basil flavors went really well together. I think the liquid from the onions and lemon didn't leave my crust as crispy as I would have liked. I guess I didn't allow enough time for all the liquid to evaporate, but I think doing so, would have lost some of the flavor as well so I left some moisture. I added some mushrooms and black olives as toppings and it turned out pretty good. I will be making this again; maybe I'll add some red pepper flakes to the spinach as well. :-)

This makes a decent snack on the weekend. I doubled the spinach here to increase nutrient content. This is smothered with mozzarella and feta for an interesting flavor.

Although good, it does need something to pump up the flavor.  I think a good sprinkle of Greek seasoning over the entire pizza would add some flavor.  I did use fresh spinach.  Pretty tasty :)

Made this tonight for my family of 4.  I thought my boys would turn their noses up to it.  Surprisingly, it was a huge hit with everyone.  One piece left that my husband doesn't think will reheat well but it was so good that I am willing to try.  I'll admit that it wasn't pretty like the picture but it was really, really good.
