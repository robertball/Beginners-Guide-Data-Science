These turned out really good. My daughter who is a picky eater loves them. I cut the white sugar by 3/4 cup and it was still sweet enough for us.

DH and my nephew loved these muffins! I thought they were good, but wasn't sure I'd make them again. I thought they needed some nuts or crunch to offset how very moist they are. (I like my muffins a bit cakey.) However, I was told that I MUST make them exactly the same again. And I feel good about giving them to DH without any oil and with some whole wheat flour. I made half muffins and the other half a loaf. The loaf came out a bit dark--not sure why the note says to leave it in the oven an extra 15 min. But it still tasted great. Thanks for a recipe I'll be making again. :)

I left out the applesauce (didn't have any, and no time to make) - I used half a cup of yogurt instead, and it seemed fine. I also didn't have trouble with it sticking to the liner ... maybe because of this substitution? I used double the amounts of banana and zucchini because they needed finishing, an extra egg and an extra cup of whole wheat flour. I kept the sugar same. Will definitely be making again!

Great way to use up bananas and zucchini.  I doubled the recipe and added chocolate chips.  used all all purpose flour and decreased the sugar a bit.  kids love it.  I embed up with 53 muffins.  I suggest spraying the muffins paper cups with oil next time. they stick to the muffin.

I was trying to do some of the suggested changes from previous reviews. I used 3 ripe bananas, 2 cups of zucchini, and 1/4 C carrots, 1/2 C sugar, 1/4 C sugar free maple syrup. And then I realized I only had self rising whole wheat flour so I used 1/2 C of that and 1/2 C ground flax. Because of the self rising flour, I didn't use baking powder or salt. It definitely need like 1/2 to 1 tsp more baking powder because the muffins were flat. I only had 1 1/2 C of AP flour. And I only had 3/4 cup of applesauce...short story, it was a struggle. But SURPRISINGLY it turned out really nice ha! It tasted fresh and not sugary. Next time, I'd like to stick closer to the recipe ha. Also the second tray I needed to use spray because muffins did stick to pan.

I also followed other reviewers and added less sugar (1/2 cup) as well as made my own applesauce.  I added Ground Flaxseed to give it a more nutritional boost. My husband is not into sweets but enjoyed these and my picky 2 1/2 year old daughter thought they were yummy too! Overall a huge success in my house. I will make again :)

These were super yummy!!! My HUGE suggestion, SPRAY YOUR CUPCAKE LINERS! I was sad I lost so much on the liner =( I did add a few things (not that it NEEDED it). I added craisins, chopped pecans, shredded carrots and white and milk chocolate chips. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

I added extra cinnamon along with a few dashes of allspice, nutmeg & ground cloves.  Next time I will add even more spices to 'zip' up the taste.  I realized at the last minute that I had no oats so I used wheat bran instead.  That worked really well.

Very moist and delicious. I didn't have whole wheat so added extra 1/2 cup AP flour and half cup quick oats in place of whole wheat.

I really enjoyed this recipe  but had to make a few changes due to what I had available and health reasons.  I had no applesauce, so I used 1/3 c butter, 1/3 c Greek yogurt, and an extra banana.  I used 2 cups zucchini in an effort to use some up! I used 3/4 c brown sugar and 3/4 white sugar and still felt like it didn't need to be as sweet! I would love to get away with 1/2 c of each next time.  I threw in some  flaxseed meal (maybe about 1/3 c) since I didn't have oats.  The muffins were soft and moist. I think the oats or some nuts would give it a great texture. I will certainly make this again!

I doubled it! I didn't have brown sugar so I used 1c white sugar and 4tablespoons honey. I used 1c less white sugar and used 1/4 c honey instead and they were great! I also added dried cherries and kept the zucchini seeds in it. Very good for a grab n go breakfast of afternoon energy treat. I will be making these all the time. Oh I also substituted the apple sauce with fruit baby food. I had no apple sauce either. Clearly I wanted to make these no matter what and nothing stopped me ????

Turned out fantastic! I grated two large zucchini (about 2 cups), cut the white sugar by a third, added 1/4 cup of pecans, and topped each muffin with a few dried cranberries. Instead of 36 muffins, it yielded 24 and took about 25/30 minutes to bake. I'll make this again and likely cut the sugar more as it was plenty sweet for us. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Made the recipe into 2 loaves and they turned out great.  Followed all ingredients with the one exception that I did not have whole wheat flour so used AP and Bread flour.  Followed directions as listed.  This one is a keeper. Less than 24 hours later and a loaf and a half are already consumed.

only used 1/2 cup of white sugar, used 2 cup whole wheat and 1 cup white flour, used 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 cup of oil, cut salt in half, only used 1/2 T. cinnamon, added 1/2 cup walnuts.
2nd version- used 1 cup oil and no applesauce, cut salt and baking soda in half, dis not half oats and forgot the nuts. very good!

These are okay- but a little dry as written.  I baked exactly as the recipe calls for, actually making the muffins a little bigger (so they should have taken longer to bake) but the 20 minute mark was spot on for 24 muffins to have a toothpick come out clean.  They were just much drier than I like, and especially as compared to banana and/or zucchini bread.  I'd add a little more banana, zucchini or applesauce next time to help it along.  Otherwise, flavor is good and I'm sure my kids will like them!

Way too dense. Almost pastey and rubbery. Pretty bland as well and I followed directions to a tee. Definitely needs another banana for flavor. I would really sub in 1/2 cup butter or oil for some of the applesauce for better flavour and texture as well. I made 1 loaf and some muffins.. ended up tossing most of everything.

Loved this recipe!! Especially because there is no oil or butter used but applesauce in it's place. What an awesome replacement to make it less in fat content.

I liked the look of this recipe, but I had no applesauce on hand, so I used 1/4 C softened butter, 1/4 C coconut oil and 1/2 C flax meal instead. I also added 1/2 C miniature semi-sweet choc chips. I made mini muffins - baked for 10 minutes. DELICIOUS!

I literally just pulled these out of the oven!! They are nice- no oil!! I cut the white sugar in half and no cinnamon- I think my daughter is allergic. I decided to add lime zest and fresh basil. Nice fresh taste!! I also toasted some sliced almonds and added them to the mix. I sprinkled the top of a few of them with a sugar/cinnamon mixture for my husband and myself.

I've made other zucchini breads, but this one definitely lacked something...flavor. Very heavy, semi dry results. Definitely too much cinnamon...I questioned one tablespoon but followed the instructions exactly. I will stick with my blueberry zucchini bread recipe, also from this site.

Yummy! Per other's reviews, I dropped the sugar amount to 1 c. and I used 3 over-ripe bananas. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. Chewy from the oatmeal and perfectly sweet. As a side note, if you find that yours is too sweet, try using unsweetened applesauce.

Yummy.  Next time I will spray the paper liners b/c my muffins stuck.  I made a half recipe since I only had one banana, and I only used one egg.

I had 4 cups of shredded zucchini and 5 mashed bananas that I split between this recipe and another. This one being the healthier of the two was less moist and less flavorful and I would definitely make the other recipe over this one.

Wow! This is my new go to recipe for zucchini bread. I actually made this into muffins and it made 18 regular but large ones. I love the healthier version although I did add chocolate chips. Today I am going to add chopped dates to keep with the healthier version and reduce the sugar as many of you have suggested. Can't wait to try it!

I used canola oil rather than applesauce, and made mini-muffins rather than full size! They turned out absolutely delicious - very moist.

Excellent!  I made the bread loaves exactly as written.  Great flavors.  Used grated zucchini and bananas I had in the freezer.  Would definitely make again

I made this recipe at a high altitude of 10,000 feet. It turned out great. I made it as muffins with wrappers. I put in a little extra flour for the altitude. I fed some to my 6 month old daughter and she loved it! I made homemade applesauce for the recipe and blended the wet ingredients in the blender.

Delicious recipe!  The only thing I changed was I added 3/4 cup white sugar and made a honey butter glaze for the top after baking!  The only suggestion I would add is to spray ur cupcake liners so it is a cleaner peel off when u go to eat them.

Simple to make and really yummy.  I did cut the amount of white sugar to 3/4 C because I don't like this type of muffin to be overly sweet.  I think this is a great way to use both zucchini and overripe bananas.  Thanks!
