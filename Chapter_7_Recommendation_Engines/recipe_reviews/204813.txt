I am the submitter of this recipe. I have just made another batch after receiving a less than stellar review. I followed the recipe exactly and had excellent results, again. My total baking time was 32 minutes. Some pointers to follow when baking anything - allow cold ingredients to come to room temperature (unless the recipe specifically states COLD). Cold ingredients drop the temperature of the batter resulting in longer baking time/underdone baked goods. This recipe calls for milk and an egg. I let mine warm up first (you can cheat here). Remember that oven temperatures vary, but the temp is always hotter at the top and cooler at the bottom. Opening the oven door repeatedly can also drop the temperature by up to 25 degrees. I do have one recommendation - if you use liners, I'd go with the foil type - the cheese in these muffins tends to stick to the paper. These are a moist muffin inside - there is yummy melty cheese all through.

I was really excited to make these sadly they were bland.  It needs at least 2 to 3 more bacon slices and maybe and extra 1/2 cup cheddar cheese or even a sharp white cheese added.  It also needs a tablespoon of mixed herbs such as rosemary and thyme.  I will try these again with these alterations and update my post.

These looked nice but the only flavor was bacon. Certainly not worth the time and ingredients.  There are much better recipes out there to use zucchini.

Didn't turn out very well. They were kind of gooey, sticky, (45 min to bake) and very bland. I will not make again.

My husband loves most anything cooked with zucchini but he did not like these muffins.  Maybe it was the combination of the different ingredients?  Don't know.  As to the actual making and baking of them, I had to cook them longer than called for.  When they were nice and browned and the toothpick came out clean, I removed them from the oven, only to have them sink.  Will not be making them again.

Very bland. I should of drained the Zucchini , the added moisture from them made these too moist.  Needs alot  to give flavour.

My family liked these but I wasn't a fan.  I thought they were a  bit bland.  Perhaps adding some chopped jalepeno would jazz these up enough for me to enjoy.

These were alright as I had to use frozen shredded zucchini.  They were a bit bland until I used some butter and pancake syrup.  It turned them almost into a sweet breakfast treat.

They are a little gooey for me.. I tested with a toothpick after 33 minutes and it came out clean so I thought they were done.  Now that they are cooled they are gooey.  Not sure if it was because I used only 2 T. low fat margarine, fat-free cheddar cheese, egg beater and Hormel Bacon Bits (50% less fat).  Maybe you need the real fat for these to turn out correctly.  Sorry, Pam, I really did want to like them.

These tasted like...nothing. They were really bland and not good at all. I followed the recipe to a T. I have a feeling these will sit until i toss them in the trash.

i made this recipe with hopes that it would turn out well. i followed directions to a tee but the submitter had failed to mention not to use paper liners prior to me making this recipe. because i used the paper ones i only ended up with muffin tops, because the rest of the muffin stuck to the paper with no give. Was very sad of out come.

I made these muffins today, and I liked the flavor. I had no problem with them being bland (I added a dash of black pepper, 2 extra slices of bacon, and half an onion fried in the bacon fat). The only problem I did have was that they were too gooey. I used buttermilk instead of regular milk, (you can make it yourself: for every cup of milk add one tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice), because the acid in the buttermilk reacts with the baking soda and makes the muffin fluffier. Unfortunately, the batter was too dense for anything too happen. I think that if I make these again I will add more flour and probably drain my zukes.  You also need to add the full amount of salt, maybe more. These were good, but VERY heavy and filling. One more thing: I think I would cut back on the cheddar and add more Parmesan just for the flavor.  I really wanted to like them. . . Sorry, but these just were too heavy for me.

I left out the bacon and maybe that is what was wrong with this recipe.  Seems like something is missing.  The muffins were rather bland.

These were ok/good. I agree with other reviewers that the muffins were lacking a little flavor. I'm vegetarian so I omitted the bacon (which may have caused the blandness)and used a dash of thyme & rosemary instead. I will try again using a stronger cheese like sharp cheddar or maybe even gorgonzola.

Was looking for a base biscuit or a muffin to change up for a catering job I'm doing and decided to try these.  I was concerned with all the fat in less than 2 cups of flour and I was right.  As they cooled, the cheese began to congeal and they sat in a puddle of fat. The flavor was so bland that all you could taste was the bacon - the zucchini flavor was lost and I saw nothing savory about any of the ingredients.

These felt and tasted greasy and I suspect it was all the cheese and bacon.. not to mention a half stick of butter divided into 12 "muffins".  When I served them, there was so much grease on the napkin lining the bread basket that they were barely touched by my guests and family.  They were also very bland tasting and couldn't taste anything but greasy cheese and bacon.  The recipe could possibly be rescued with half the cheese, half the butter and some fresh herbs.  I think I'd leave out the bacon next time too.

They were a little on the dry side and I couldn't taste the zucchini -- only bacon and cheddar.

While not inedible, these were very bland. And too dry for my liking. Not tender at all. I would not make these again as written. This recipe needs too many revisions.

I made a cold pasta salad with a fresh tomato herb-y dressing for dinner and was looking for a complimentary bread to serve with it. This was the one I eventually chose....and what a choice! Only thing different I did was use half whole wheat flour and low-fat buttermilk. Very, very nice. Even my youngest son ate two! Simple, filling and very tasty. I'm quite jealous I didn't come up with it. NOTE: I did not peel my zukes or scoop out the seeds. I just chopped it all quick as a rabbit in my Pampered Chef hand chopper.

Could use a little more flavor so we may add some extra bacon and some garlic powder next time, but we definitely make again to use up extra zucchini.

These turned out absolutely fantastic! I used 1/4th of a cup of bacon bits because i didn't have actual bacon on hand and they still turned out to die for! One big tip is, absolutely DO NOT drain your zucchini when making these. It give them their moisture and if you drain them then your muffin will most likely turn out burnt or hard. These muffins actually taste like the cheese biscuits you get at Red Lobster, except you get a little bit of something extra in these! Great taste, great texture, and a great find. Definitely will make again. Thankyou!

Let me start by saying I was somewhat prepared for a problem with this recipe only because of reading about some issues on the exchange...and, had that happened, I would have rated/reviewed the recipe to reflect that, no matter who the submitter was.  Now, all that said, they were perfect!  Seriously, I can't figure out what went wrong with those who had a problem.  I am adamant about making a recipe nearly to the letter of how it's submitted in order to rate it fairly, and this was no different. I followed the recipe exactly other than I added a dash of cayenne and black pepper.  There were no issues of saltiness, and they certainly weren't over OR underdone.  They were lovely both in taste and texture.  I am so glad I made these as a "test". Now, I will be making them again because they disappeared so quickly, this time! :)  Oh, some of us did add a lil butter to these, while warm...mmmmmm....! Thank you for the recipe, Pam! :)

The only problem I had with these muffins was getting one for me to eat!  They disappeared as soon as I put them out and everyone agreed they are wonderful.  I have a second batch in the oven as I type this.  I have no more bacon, so I replaced some of the butter with the drippings from the first batch.  This is a terrific recipe and we will have them often.  Thanks Pam!

These were great! My 1 1/2 year old loves them. I used half whole wheat and regular flour. I didn't have fresh parmesan cheese though. I also didn't have any bacon. Next time I will make sure I have all the ingredients. Thankyou for sharing this recipe.

These were wonderful! I read Pam's review before making and made sure everything was at room temp before baking. Mine were done at exactly 30 minutes. I added a little extra garlic and a tsp of italian seasoning, but otherwise made as written. These were a great side to the chili I made and my husband couldn't stop raving about them. Thanks for the recipe, Pam!

I'm not sure what happened w/ the reviewers, but this was a great savory muffin. I took another one's advice and replaced 1/4 cup flour w/ corn meal.   I even used mozz. instead of cheddar and there was tons of flavor. I'll make this often!

I followed the recipe exactly and the muffins were done in just 22 minutes, so keep an eye on them. The texture was great but they were a little on the salty side. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these last night and they turned out great.  They were done in about 30 minutes, moist and yummy.  I didn't drain the zucchini.  I didn't add the bacon but I think I will add it next time. Leftovers would make an excellent quick and go breakfast.

I don't know why anyone had trouble with these muffins. I half expected it because of a few bad reviews (I read them all). They turned out great and I will definitely make them again.

I liked the texture of these. They were moist, domed up & browned nicely, and were done in 32 minutes. I read many of the "bland" comments (along with those that disagreed) and was determined to make them without tweaking the flavor though I did use1/2 butter and 1/2 applesauce. I wish I had added a little something else(onion or diced peppers or herbs, etc) as I agree that they were too bland for my taste and mostly tasted of bacon when you actually got a bite of it. I put a dab of dijon mustard on one and liked that better. I like the base recipe, I just think it could be tweaked a little in flavor in many easy ways to meet one's personal tastes. As is, I just don't car for the taste, sorry.

I loved these! Especially straight out of the oven. I made quite a few changes and didn't find them bland at all. Firstly, I used a mixture of grated zucchini and apple, probably a little over a cup in total. I used two big cloves of garlic and a bit of fresh ground pepper. I used one cup of cheddar cheese and omitted the parm and bacon because I didn't have any. I found the baking time to be about right, unlike other raters. I think this is a great versatile recipe. Thanks for sharing!!

Such a wonderful, savoury muffin!  I am not sure how there are reviews on here that disliked them so much, we loved them!  I did use 2 egg whites instead of an egg as I had a carton open to use and also used shredded light swiss as I was out of cheddar (that never happens!).  Left out the bacon as I don't often buy it, although I did throw in a couple of tsps of a cheese/jalapeno seasoning that I have and love!  Mine were done and nicely browned in about 25 mins.  Great muffins Pam, thanks for sharing!

Tasty with my "All Zucchini Dinner" inspired by Pam-3BoysMama." Served with "Zucchini Stuffed Chicken," "Baked Vegetables," "Zucchini Chocolate Cake," and "Zucchini-Chocolate Chip Muffins" for breakfast the next day.

These muffins are totally awesome! I made them exactly as written and didn't have a single problem with anything. I divided the batter up among the 12 greased muffin cups (no liners, since some people had lots of problems with those!) and they seemed very full, but the muffins baked up so beautifully with nice, high, golden brown tops. The texture was wonderful, light, fluffy, buttery...just what I hoped for! Thanks so, so much for sharing this recipe! I will definitely make these again when I have zucchini to use up!

Since I read here on AR that all summer squash is pretty much interchangable in recipes, I used pattypan squash and 1/4 cup real bacon bits...otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  They smelled wonderful baking and tasted just as good.  I didn't have any trouble with them sticking to the paper liners...the problem isn't with the recipe, it's with your liners, folks!  I drained but didn't squeeze dry the squash, baked 35 minutes.  Thanks for a great recipe, Pam!

These were FANTASTIC! I was looking for a higher protein, less carb baked good to feed my kids on school mornings.  This recipe looked very promising as I also had extra zucchini in my fridge and pretty much all the rest of the ingredients.  I did have to make two substitutions since I didn't have them in my house.  I used a 1/4 cup of "real bacon crumbles" for the bacon and 1/4 cup of 6-cheese shredded Italian cheese blend for the fresh parmesan.   I also only had 8 paper liners left and almost did not make this recipe.  I decided to go ahead and use cooking spray for the remaining four muffin cups.    My kids (ages 6, 6, 6 and 4) were hovering around the oven because they smelled so good.  My oven always seems to cook baked goods on the minimum time stated to cook, so just in case I checked my muffins at 25 minutes.  They were done at 30 minutes.    Surprisingly, the non-paper lined muffins came out better!  They simply flipped out of the muffin pan easily and left no mess.  The paper lined muffins also came out great tasting, it's just that I lost a lot of muffin to the paper as they stuck a bit to the paper.    So essentially, I made these as written and they came out moist, fluffy and super-savory.  I could taste the garlic, cheddar and bacon.  Oh and my kids loved them.  This recipe is definitely going to become a staple in this household.

This came out perfect for me. Amazing when they are hot out of the oven. Didn't mess with foils and put my extras in the freezer to see how they save that way. Will let you know how it goes.

Thanks, Pam, for an excellent savory muffin recipe.  My kids weren't totally sold, until I told them there was bacon in the muffins.  Then they ate 2 each.  Another delicious way to use up some zucchini.  We had these with our herbed chicken fettucine (also from this site), and they were perfect.

I made these muffins to go with a chicken dinner. I followed the recipe almost exactly: I used egg beaters for the egg, soy milk for the milk, and I left out the bacon. I also added a bit more garlic, using 1 heaping tsp of bottled garlic. Baked for 33 minutes and I thought they were very good. Due to some of the ratings I wanted to taste them before dinner, and I was pleased and my 2.5 year old was happy with the result. I didn't think they were bland or gooey. They weren't "normal" muffin consistency on the inside, but I wouldn't say they were gooey or runny, either.

I tried this recipe this morning for myself and my daughter for breakfast. I saw people thought it was rather bland so I added half a packet of sazon to the mix, a whole teaspoon of salt and a whole cup of the cheese. They came out very nice. Still a little less flavorful than I would like for a savory muffin but for breakfast this was really rather good. I didn't add bacon because I personally don't like pork. I would say definitely try  this recipe but spice it differently according to your personal taste. Also they were done (tops golden) in 34 minutes. Make sure everything is room temp.

Yum! I thought these were very different but delicious! Kind of reminded me of a cornbread muffin in a way. My only criticism was that it had quite a strong garlic flavor, I would maybe back off a bit on that next time. Great way to use up zucchini. I paired mine with a mexican zucchini soup from this site. I think it would go well with any soup, chili, or even a summer pasta salad.

these were excellent!!! i had zero problems. my picky eaters even loved them. i made two batches and we had some left for breakfast the next morning before school. to the reviewer with the problems: make sure you measure correctly. remember there are two seperate measuring utensils for solids and liqids. also make sure you are measuring your flour, soda, and powder correctly. sifting also helps.

That zucchini does not have a whole lot of flavor on its own. This is a very good savory muffin with a lot of room for a flavor profile to be added. What I really appreciate is that this a savory muffin that turns out moist. Thank you for a good base recipe that allows for some experimentation.

Pretty good overall.  I reduced the flour to 1 1/2 cups and added 1/2 cup corn meal.   I also squeezed the grated zucchini between paper towels to reduce the liquid.  The muffins came out crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  They made a nice addition to our supper of white chicken chili.  My family loved them!

Oh my goodness these were awesome! I kind of goofed on the directions a little and just threw everything in a bowl and started mixing. Which probably led to the fact that they were a little chewy on the outside but that's the way I like my muffins. Even though they were chewy on the outside they were moist and delicious on the inside. The flavors meld together very well and they taste great! We have a bunch of zucchini in the freezer and I will be making these again!

I really liked these..they puffed up and got a really nice crown on them. I used turkey bacon, soy cheese, olive oil instead of butter (and half the amount). I did add a bit of chili powder as I was making these to serve with  pumpkin chili. I made half a batch and popped them in the freezer. They reheated well.

These were so good, I joined just so I could review them. I read every review before I made them, but I followed the recipe exactly. My muffins were done in 32 minutes. I didn't use paper liners - now I see the recipe is different from the one I printed out last week. The paper liners part is gone. Thank you for a great recipe. I will make these often!

Fabulous was what the neighbor lady said when I gave her three to try, she didn't even make it home without eating one! The boys thought they were GREAT! Everyone said how good they were. Didn't have any problems getting them out of the pan I sprayed with Pam. Just loosened and popped right out. Done at 28 minutes. And I didn't check them every 5 minutes, because you lose 25 degrees on your oven when you do that! Good muffins Pam! I'll post pic next download.

This is a nice way to help use up all that zucchini.  I made this recipe as directed and had no problems with them being gooey or undone.  I had smaller muffin pans, so I got 15 and only had to bake about 15 minutes.  I did use paper liners and they stuck so next time, I'll use foil or none at all. I plan to add a little onion to the batter next time.  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks Pam for sharing this recipe!

A new family favorite!  I used buttermilk instead of regular and 2 tsp. minced garlic from a jar.  I also used a cheddar/jack mix of cheeses.  After reading other reviews that they stuck to the papers, I made them without.  They turned out great!  I've got zucchini coming out of my garden like crazy, so I'm planning to make several batches & freeze them!

I just made a double batch of these and they are awesome!  I did leave out the bacon because I didn't have any, but I had no problem with baking them to the right consistency.  They taste very similar to the Red Lobster rolls, but even better.  I've already e-mailed this recipe to several friends.  Thanks for a keeper!

Awesome recipe!  I used shredded zucchini instead as a way to hide it from the kids, lol!  They couldnt even tell...and loved them!  I also added a few extra strips of bacon.  The recipe is perfect as is though. Thankyou for sharing!

These are delicious! But since I don't eat bacon, I didn't add it. Instead of cheddar cheese I used Feta. I added chopped cilantro, and green onion. My children loved it, too! Thanks!

These come out good consistency if you follow the recipe.  I omitted the bacon and added some more parmesan instead.  They are a bit bland but you can always add your favourite spices to boost the taste.  I experiment with the spices in different batches, my favourite so far have been chill peppers and turmeric.

I made this recipe yesterday, but with a few tweeks. After reading the many reviews about it being bland, i added fresh thyme to the batter. Also, i made sure to get an extra old cheddar cheese. Finally, i put chopped ham instead of bacon. The results-amazing! I had bought jalapeno to use, but forgot to add it. Im sure with that too, it would have been even better. As for the cooking time, 30 minutes is great-but dont open the oven door before! Make sure to put on a cooing rack for ten minutes or so as well. Hope this review was helpful!

Pam-3BoysMama, I loved your recipe. Was looking for a savory muffin and read the reviews. To those who gave you one star ... shame on them for not being creative bakers. I added finely diced red and yellow peppers, some Origanum and some pepper and voala! No Bland Zucchini muffin! Thanks for the original post!

We really liked these! Light, fluffy & moist. Since I bake a lot with zucchini, my tip is to make sure that ALL the ingredients are at room temperature! This includes the zukes and cheese.

Changes I made are: used 1 cup all purpose and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour (didn't feel like doing the math);  used 3/4 cup finely diced ham (had some that needed to be used)that I sauteed in the butter, adding garlic for the last minute or so. I added this directly to the milk/egg mixture, which was not according to the recipe. Also threw in a couple of finely sliced green onions and a sprinkle of chipotle chile powder.

My next batch will omit the garlic, use either bacon or ham, and add more onion as well as possibly black pepper and some herbs.

Has anyone frozen these? I'd like to keep these on hand for breakfast. Great recipe. Thank you!

I accidentally only added half the butter which was plenty. Used gluten free flour, added whatever bits and pieces of cheese and bacon I had on hand including a few crumbs of feta and a bit of extra bacon. My 14 year old daughter is eating them for breakfast every morning. This is after telling me she "couldn't possibly eat breakfast EVER" so I think they are a real success.

I have made this twice in the past week and followed the recipe pretty closely. I did make one technique change however which is why i gave it a 4 and not a 5 as i think it is nessacary. After shredding the zuchinni I added a bit a salt and let it sit for 10 or so minutes to draw the moisture out. After which I placed  in a kitchen towel and squeezed all the liquid out. Then continued as directed.  I baked them for 37 minutes. The texture was perfect. Not mushy at all. I used a sharp cheddar and real parm. I didn't measure the cheese, so most likely I put more than suggested. I also did not add bacon. The flavor was far from bland. Some herbs would work nicely into this for added flavor depth.

This is a really nice and fluffy muffin. I didn't give it 5 stars because I do agree that it was a bit bland. I added some extra salt, Old Bay and some Herbs de Provence. I also always substitute apple sauce for butter/oil in my baking. I used all apple sauce instead of butter with aTbsp of olive oil and it tasted fine.

Excellent recipe!  I would suggest that the muffin cups be buttered and floured rather than sprayed with cooking spray.   I made the recipe exactly as written, measuring the zucchini accurately and the result was delicious and the perfect amount for 12 muffins.   For those who may have had gooey/too moist muffins - it's probably because you used too much zucchini.   My 9 month old daughter and I loved these!

These baked up perfectly(30 min, exactly, in my oven). I thought there was a perfect ratio of ingredients-nothing overpowered anything else, the consistency was perfect.

Thanks for the great recipe, Pam!  These muffins are fantastic.  Made as written with the exception of the bacon.  I didn't have any on hand so fried up four maple flavored breakfast sausages and diced them.  Used cooking spray on my muffin tin and they popped out like nobody's business.  Also cooking time and temperature were right on.  Looking forward to having them for a breakfast snack at work, if they last that long.

I'm rating this 5 stars after the following:  I used shredded pepper jack cheese (no parmesan or cheddar) and added a 8.75 oz can of corn, drained.  I did not use any bacon.  Also, I did not drain the zucchini.  The texture of the muffins was great!

I enjoyed these muffins quit a bit. I did not even use the bacon and thought they had good flavor. I used half whole wheat flour to make them more hearty and filling. Very good.

Ours were a little gooey, but my whole family loved them & ate them up!  I used a strong, white cheddar and added yoghurt (in place of milk) for some thickness.  We let them brown quite a bit on top and they get better if you let them set for a while (it is tempting to eat them fresh from the oven).  Turn the oven off, crack the door and let them firm up a bit - it works great.  Great recipe - thanks for sharing!

I didn't love this recipe. It was to bland and needs some added flavor. I'm going to remake it in a few weeks with other spices and will post how it comes out.

I think the zucchini needs to be squeezed of all its moisture perhaps? These are sloppy inside and rubbery on the outside.

I loved this recipe. I didn't have any milk, so I used sour cream. I used a combination of carrots and zucchini and I did drain them. I also used considerably more cheese than the recipe called for, including bacon jalapeno cheddar. I think they turned out fantastic. (in the picture, they are the muffins nearest the camera)

I was looking for a savory muffin to use some hot country sausage and my abundant zucchini in a new way.  This recipe was perfect!  I subbed hot country sausage (about 1 cup browned, crumbled sausage), upped the grated parmesan to one cup, and eliminated the grated cheddar.  The result was marvelous.  Really good recipe!

What a disappointment!  They sounded delicious but tasted very plain:  No cheese, bacon, or zucchini flavors.  Maybe more bacon, or a smidge of bacon fat (I know, I know) or sharp cheddar.  Anything to bring up a flavor.

I don’t understand all of the negative ratings for this recipe. I made it exactly to the recipe and it came out great! My husband and I loved it. The muffins are very tasty, not bland at all. How can bacon, cheese, garlic and zucchini be bland? They were moist but light. I even used paper liners and they don’t stick if the muffin is cold. Great for breakfast heated up or not!

The muffins are more of a meal side.  They had a nice flavor but I think the cheese made it very salty.  I will try again, maybe modifying slightly.

Did this doubled with the following changes - 1/2 cheddar + 1/2 pepper jack because that's what I had, no bacon because vegetarian, and bread pans instead of muffin tins. Came out great and really good as breakfast put through the toaster twice. Partner says 'I like not knowing whether I'm eating bread or a block of cheese.'

The first time I made these with all Parmesan cheese and the result was delicious.  Today I thought I'd try mini muffins.  I used 3/4 cup sharp cheddar and 1/4 cup shredded Parmesan.  The result was very bland.  I will switch back to all Parmesan or Asiago and maybe add a bit of cayenne for a little kick.

Thank you so much for a really nice recipe; it is easy to use ingredients you like .

Delicious.  Used spelt flour and peas. No bacon. No papers. Coconut oil not butter. Can't stop eating them. Squeeze water from zucchini.  Thanks for recipe.

I needed to use some zucchini I had, so this recipe helped do that. While I wouldn't say these muffins were bland, I do think for my personal taste they need more flavor. Definitely a little more salt and perhaps some finely diced onion.

I just tried this recipe and they are really good! I saw some of the comments and had updated the recipe to use old cheddar and 6 slices of bacon.  I thought I had 2 cups of zucchini, but after I froze it, thawed and drained the water, it looked more like 1 cup, but I was preparing double the recipe, so this will have a factor in the moisture.  Mine doubled in size after baking and to avoid the frustration of sticking muffins, I cut squares of parchment paper and used them to line the muffin tins (no sticking).

Phenomenal.  Great at breakfast, with pork chops, with chili.  Just don't make the mistake I did and tell your kids there's zucchini in them.

We found these muffins too be quite good.  We are going to try them with old cheddar instead of the medium we had on hand, and perhaps another slice of bacon or two.  We also mixed fresh parmesan with the dry grated as we were concerned about some of the reviews.  I don't believe that was necessary as the muffins turned out good.
