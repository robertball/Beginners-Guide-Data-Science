Found this searching for a way to use up some leftover summer sausage and was pleasantly surprised.  Thank you.

This was so simple yet so amazing!  I used caribou summer sausage and served cabbage and sour cream/chive pierogies on the side.

Delicious! This is simple to prepare, economical, and most importantly, good. I used a regular smoked sausage instead of pepperoni (my boyfriend doesn't really care for pepperoni, for some reason). The flavor is delicate, yet powerful (paprika is one of my favorite spices). Great winter comfort food, and I will make it again. It is on the same page as a keilbasa and cabbage recipe I made from this site a few weeks back. I would enjoy adding cabbage to this dish. I guess as a Czech you can't go wrong with sausage and vegetables!

Very good!  I had some summer sausage that was going to expire in a couple of days and thought this would be a good way to use it up.  I did add some non-traditional ingredients that turned out to be great additions.  I added some garlic with the onion.  I also added some zucchini and fennel with the tomatoes.  I served it over rice, with a side of cheese garlic biscuits and a glass of California Rose.  Great dinner!  My husband, who is a big lover of any sort of processed meat, raved about this dish.

This is the same as the Hungarian "Lecso", a great summer dish.  You can make it meatless, or with eggs added too, it's delicious.

I didn't care for this one at all.  It was really bland so I then doubled the salt, pepper, and paprika.  Still pretty rough.  Added a ton of hot sauce just to make it edible.

Nice dinner full of vegetables! Next time, I will add some garlic, maybe more salt, and some cayenne pepper to increase the depth of flavor.

Absolutely delicious!  I needed a recipe for summer sausage as that was one of few things left in the freezer.  It was perfect.  Even my boyfriend's daughter, who doesn't like cooked peppers, cleaned her plate without one complaint!

This was a good way to use up left over summer sausage.  I forgot to add the tomatoes, but we still liked it.  I served it with sauteed cabbage and cheddar cheese garlic biscuits.  It was a hit...and used up the sausage and peppers in my fridge.

This was great!  Even my picky teenage daughters ate it up.  I was forced to use a small can of petite diced tomatoes as I didn't have any fresh tomatoes on hand and it still turned out great!  Fast and filling, this is a perfect busy weeknight dinner.

My dish didn't turn out nearly as pretty as the picture shown (lol!) but it sure tasted great!  It was easy to prepare & a great way to use up some summer sausage I didn't want to throw out. The only thing I did differently was add a little minced garlic (I'm a garlic fan!)--other than that I followed the recipe exactly & was very pleased! I was hoping for more leftovers--but my hubby ate tons!  Even my picky 11-year old liked it.  Thanks for a great recipe!  Will make again.

Surprised by how flavorful this recipe was! My family inhaled it, should've made more. I also added garlic and a pinch of ceyenne for a bit of spice. Excellent recipe, simple, fast and easy!

My wife and I made this with the summer sausage and it was great! My wife doesn't like tomatoes, so it wasn't her favorite and that is the only reason it's only getting 4 stars. If it was up to just me, it would be a 5. Even better the second day!

Made this with summer sausage. We added a can of black beans to stretch it to serve a hungry 5 people more generously. Also added some cayenne pepper. We put the tomatoes in at the very last and only cooked them a couple of minutes so they didn't make the dish watery at all. We ate it with farro cooked in the rice cooker. Will definitely save the recipe and make this again.
