This was a great recipe. Even better than I remember them being as a kid. I left out the dill and pepper just because I wasn't sure what taste would be created. Overall, I loved it and will become of my quick "go to" recipes. Thanks for sharing!!!!

Love the taste of this! I used a salmon filet instead of canned salmon but other than that stuck real close to the recipe. Great salmon croquet! Would make again for sure!

These are delicious. I eat these on a bed of lettuce leaves. They are delicious cold as well with a slice of tomato and onion. You can increase or decrease seasoning as desired. For me, I like lots of everything. These are the best and I have tried a lot. Thanks for sharing. I make them every week

Easy and good.  I added 1/4tsp of turmeric and used a little chopped onion because I didn't have any green onions.  Skipped the jalapeno pepper.

We loved these!  I followed the recipe from the eggs down as written.  For the salmon, I used about a 1-lb. piece of leftover broiled salmon that I flaked with a fork.  Thanks!

Made it exactly as posted.  I did make one mistake!!  I added the one tablespoon of oil into the mix instead of adding to fry in!!  Didn't make any change as far as I'm concerned.  It probably made it hold together a little better...just say'n!!!  The cayenne gave it just the right kick and loved the celery which I had never added in other recipes...if you liked salmon croquettes I think you will find this easy, quick and very tasty!!

I fully expected to not like these.  The canned salmon looked unappetizing out of the can...  But I was so wrong!!!  I made it exactly as written - just the right amount of crunch with the celery, subtle heat from the jalepeno, good seasoning and it held together well during the pan fry.  Wow. I'm delighted that a $3.80 can of salmon made these delicious croquettes and came together quickly.

We were good and stuck with the winter weather this year -- good thing I stocked up on staples (tinned salmon), these  salmon cakes were wonderful, recipe perfect again/again.  Dressed up or down, they make for a home-run every time.

These have an excellent combination of ingredients and we loved the flavor!  I used fresh poached Atlantic salmon leftover from the night before which has a milder flavor so I will try making them with canned to compare as a stronger salmon flavor would be good in these. I was in a rush and somehow left out the diced onion, and although I did use the green onion I think they'll be even better with the diced onion included next time. I did use dried jalape√±o flakes as that's what I had on hand. 
I liked that the recipe said to use only 1 tablespoon of oil to cook them as others I found had you fry them in 1/4" or more of oil.  However they were a little dry so the next day my husband fried some of the leftover mix in 1/4' of oil and said they were better. I may try cutting back a bit on the amount of bread crumbs as I'd rather keep the fat content lower.  And including the diced onion may make a difference, too. 
Overall a great recipe that I'll look forward to making regularly.  Thanks Jataun for sharing!

Great way to get needed fish oil.  I don't care for fresh salmon so this works for me.

I make this on a regular basis, the only change I make is I cook salmon fillets and shred them. I personally prefer this over the canned. They are delicious!

Very good. I like the chunkiness (is that a word?) of the vegetables. I had some pink trout whole, left a bit chunky (there's that word again)  that I used and added a bit of mayo. Was the best seafood patties ever. Horseradish sauce on top.

Made this for my non-vegan parents. We added diced red peppers instead of jalepenos. Also added 1/2 t salt and 1/2 worchestershire sauce.  They were baked in the oven 15 minutes each side.  My parents loved them.

These were EXCELLENT! To cut down on the CARBS, I replaced MOST of the breadcrumbs with grated parmigiana cheese, which was a great move.

I shredded fresh salmon instead of using canned and the result was melt in your mouth patties.

I went through a lot of recipes and this one seemed to be more simple. Mine turned out great and went amazing with some hot sauce and fries. The flavors weren't too overpowering and they meshed well together. Great recipe!

These were absolutely delicious!  I added some finely chopped green peppers.  This will definitely be a staple in my household.

We love salmon around my house! I have made these and they were great! I substituted canned salmon for some filets I cooked on a cedar plank in my oven for convenience. They turned out well.

Make this dish every year especially during lent.  Tweak the recipe for my family's taste adjusting the spices but also add minced onion or dried chives for the extra onion flavor also add minced garlic

I've always loved salmon croquettes but never attempted to make them.  This recipe was easy to follow and very delicious! I'm not a spicy person so I left the jalape√±o's out.  I'll definitely be making this more often! Thanks!

I would use a little less onion just because no one in my family likes that much onion.  It is extremely flavorful.  I mean yummy yummy!!!  So happy to have found something I can make ahead for busy nights!

Could use a little salt but overall good consistency and patties held together well

These are great with a ton of flavor, though I added about 1/2 teaspoon salt.  I served on buns with pickles.

Fantastic!  I was actually afraid to try canned salmon...remembering from childhood how my Mom picked through it to remove bones and skin.  I used the boneless/skinless variety by Bumblebee to make these patties and they were amazing.  A little heat from the cayenne made them perfect.  They were very flavorful...crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  Will be making these at least once a week to get more seafood into my diet.

The best tasting salmon burger I have found.  It is very moist, too.
