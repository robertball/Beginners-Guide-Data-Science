This was terrific claudia.  I ate the whole thing myself...in one night!  I had 4 huge fuji apples and didn't think a pie plate would hold all of them so I dumped it in an 8x8 square baking dish.  I tossed the apples and cinnamon in a large plastic bowl so they would be coated on all sides.  I used a full cup of brown sugar only, added a dash of vanilla extract and used some oatmeal along with the flour.  I wish I would have had some caramel sauce to drizzle on top, but I devoured it without it.  Highly recommended!

I tossed in some raisins to make sure that the apples wouldn't get too dried oyt, it turned out really very well.  I didn't like the walnuts a whole lot so I just did loads of pecans for the second round, it turned out very nicely, almost like pralines.  The first time around I used a much more shallow glass dish, but I found that it ended up being far too flimsy, so the second time around I put my apples (3 courtland, 1 granny smith) into a much smaller square glass pan.  Try using a tablespoon or two of brandy when you're initially preparing the apples for an extra kick.

Tasty...although I found the topping to be a bit over processed.  Next time I will coarsely chop the nuts and mix the topping by hand for a more "crumbly" topping :o)

This was very good, but next time I may cut back on the butter.  It ended up making the topping a little greasy.

You just cannot go wrong with this one.  The nuts make the topping crunchy even on the 3rd day.  I once ran out of butter and only put in 1/2 the amount, it still turned out great.  I mix in about a teaspoon of all purpose flour with the apples so the juice from the apples does not collect on the bottom of the pan.  I know I will make this recipe many more times.  Thanks for sharing!

I added two handfuls of fresh bluberries, 1/2 C quick oats, 1/2 tsp. vanilla and used melted margarine. Baked it in a greased casserole dish and it turned out great.  Served it warm with a dollop of Dream Whip and it was a big hit with coffee. =}

I added 1/4 cup of dried cranberries to apples which brought a really nice flavor to the apples. The crisp topping using walnuts and pecans is delicious and gives you slight variations as you eat it. It's really good. Perfect recipe for making indvidual apple crisps for dessert... or as we found out breakfast!

Fantastic! Got rave reviews after making it my 1st time on Thanksgiving. Doubled the recipe and there was barely any left! Lisa C's review was so helpful when she said, "for those who like to measure, I used 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, and approx. 1/8 tsp. salt." Again, I doubled that amount since I doubled the recipe and made it in a foil lasagna pan. Great recipe! Thanks!!!

I just made this as an impromptu dessert for my hubby, and it was very tasty!  I sliced the apples rather than chopping them, and for those who like to measure, I used 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, and approx. 1/8 tsp. salt.  Was out of pecans, so used 1/2 walnuts and 1/2 almonds.  We both love the nutty taste, and look forward to having the leftovers for breakfast  :-)

I used the topping of this recipe to go on top of an apple pie.  I've been making apple pie for about 25 years and this was, by far, the best I've made yet.

After a really obvious inner battle, my mother-in-law finally admitted that this was way better than her daughter's apple cobbler. Thanks for the help with brownie points! 

I did add a tbs of lemon juice mixed with tsp of corn starch and one packet of Truvia to add a little sweet tangy taste to the apples.

Wonderful, simple recipe,

I really enjoyed this. I made it gluten free by substituting 1/4 cup almond meal and 1/4 cup oatmeal for the flour. It tasted great, but mine turned out a little dry.

Good flavor but the apples were very, very dry. Needs something more to give it that glaze. Kind of felt like just eating dried out apples with a sugar mixture on top.

This is excellent! I made mine in a glass 8x8 dish. I only made two minor changes. One was to add 1/4 cup dried cranberries to the apples and the other was to add 1/3 cup oats to the topping. It was perfect!

The recipe was amazingly easy and super tasty. I threw it together quickly using peaches instead of apples, because they were riper, and I actually baked it in a loaf pan. The type of fruit or pan didn't matter because it totally hit the spot and was 10x easier than apple pie!

I have been searching the Internet and recipe sites for an Apple Crisp my whole family would like.  Well - I FOUND IT!!  Not only is this simple and easy to make, but all my children loved it. I had passed out small servings and to my surprise they all asked for seconds!!  Thank you Claudia, this rescipe is wonderful. Oh - and to everyone out there considering this recipe, I left out the salt and did not find it lacking in any way.  The flavor is super!! :-)

This had a very nice topping, flavourful but not too sweet. The only problem was I feel that if I make it again, I would increase the amount of apple used. I made the recipe as stated and there was more topping than apple, which I found disconcerting.

Delicious! I sprinkled lemon over Granny Smith apples to keep them from browning while I peeled, and they came out deliciously tart. Replaced some of the flour with oatmeal, which I highly recommend. Doubled the recipe, and ended up having to freeze the rest of the topping. Can't wait to try it on peaches this summer!

Mmmmm!  I made this recipe in the fall after apple picking.  My boyfriend is more of a simple dessert (chocolate chip cookies) kind of guy.  So I ended up eating the whole thing myself... I was craving it so often!

Wow, this was absolutly the best apple crips I have ever eaten. I used 5 apples instead of 4. (3 courtlands and 2 granny smith's) also I replaced the 1/2 cup of flour with 1/2 cup of mostly flour with some instant oat meal added in to make a full 1/2 cup.  Instead of dusting the apples, I placed them in a baggie with cinnamon and apple pie spice (because I didnt have any nutmeg) and completely coated them then I dumped the chopped up apples into the pie plate and followed baking directions as called for. Four of us ate this and there was hardly any left. Everyone loved it. This is so good especially with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. I can't wait to make again.

I didn't care for the topping and it turned out very dry. I'm not sure what I did wrong.

This is my new favorite Apple Crisp recipe!  We all loved this and I made it with gluten free flours (Four Bean Flour).  Great with a scoop of ice cream.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Delicious and easy. Granny Smith's produced too tart a crisp though.

Made with Fuji apples.  It is great with both kinds of nuts and not the oatmeal.

It is funny to read comments asking about where is the oatmeal.  If you want it, put it in, but why would you?

The apple crisp tasted very good, but was watery at the bottom. I'm sure that has nothing to do with the recipe, but does anyone know how to avoid water on the bottom of the pan from the apples?

This was a very quick and dessert to make up. I will definitely make it again. I may try adding a little oatmeal to it, it was great without, but seemed odd to have apply crisp without the oatmeal. My hubby loved it and has asked that I make it again soon, and I plan on it.

This is an absolute favorite in my house! I use 4 different colors of apples and flavors just burst! I'm not a fan of salt so no salt mine. I also use more than a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg I cover the top with both.

Had about 5 or 6 small and slightly wilting MacIntosh apples that I was looking for something to use them with as they weren't that swell to eat on their own any more.  This recipe hit the mark.  I followed the directions and ingredient list exactly.  The only addition I made was a quick squirt of lemon juice before I put the seasoning on the apples to bake because almost immediately, the fruit was starting to brown... and then I shortened the first bake by about 15 minutes because I was really afraid that the apples were too grainy to start with and would only get more mushy.  The flavor was awesome... the texture was good.  This is being added to the "what to do with almost scary but not quite ready for the compost fruit" file.  Saved me a few dollars in produce!  Thanks!!

Great and easy apple crisp recipe. I used a mixture of apples because that is what I had (Grannys, Macintosh) and added just a squeeze of real lemon to the apples prior to sprinkling them with the cinnamon and nutmeg, then cooking in the oven. Only had pecans and 1/2 a cup at that but they roasted and cooked perfectly - 1 cup would be for the major nut lover! I use a convection oven setting and cooked for the stated amount. Turned out very flavorful and perfect with or without ice cream.  Thanks for sharing.

I lliked this recipe!  I was in a hurry and just wanted something quick to get rid of some mealy apples I had bought in the big bag (I hate it when I buy a bag of apples and they're too old!) They worked great, and since I was in a rush, here's what I changed.  I put 5 small apples in my pie pan with a bottom crust I had in the freezer.  I sprinkled with cinnamon and nutmeg and threw them in the oven for 20 min. as directed.  Meanwhile I skipped the food processor and in a bowl I added the flour, brown sugar and used a fork to cut in the butter.  Lastly I added the walnuts (no pecans) but just broke them up a bit with my hand.  I sprinkled the topping on and baked for another 30-40.  It was SO GOOD!  Better than the oatmeal ones, and super easy.

I cooked this for my husband.  When he got home I put it back in the oven on low heat to warm it up...asked him to take it out 20 minutes later, which he forgot and it sat in the oven for about 40 minutes.  I was terrified that it would be ruined, but to my delight, it turned out absolutely delicious even overcooked.  I made a couple small variations in the recipe...no pecans just walnuts, added about 1/2 cup of craisins and served with vanilla ice cream.  DELISH!

I made this recipe for my family with a  variety of fresh apples.  I added rolled oats to the food prcocessor (1/3 cup).  It was a huge hit.  The nuts give it so much flavor.

Thanks for this recipe!  I made a few changes though.  I used 1/4 cup of normal sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  Also, I didn't use the nuts and I used 5 apples instead.  Overall, a good recipe!

5 stars for being so easy. It's still cooking, but I added a bit of maple syrup to the cooked apples and a dash of flour for absorption. Because I like to add cholesterol-fighting oatmeal to anything I can (bowls of oatmeal aren't consumed around here too often), I ground rolled quick oats into a flour meal and used that instead of the white flour.  Looks yummy! Post-cooking: didn't need the dash of syrup! Taste great!

I liked this recipe because it looked easy and it was.  I was dying to try the new Splenda Brown Sugar Blend.  It worked well and has no aftertaste.  I don't have a food processor and I at first tried to do the topping with the blender - bad move.  The crumbly topping came out smooth and whipped so after it was done it was not crisp and crumbly (my hubby wouldn't eat it) but it was still good and I would definitely make it again.  PS I don't usually give out 5 STARS.  Thanks Claudia

This was a spur of the moment idea and a great choice! The more apples the better and I only used pecans. I used half the brown sugar and it still was a hit with company!

GLUTEN FREE VERSION:  Very good apple crisp.  I chose this recipe because it was one of the few that was oatmeal free.  I made this with gluten free flour (1/4 cup sorghum flour, 1/4 cup white rice flour and 1/8 cup tapioca starch).  The nuts made a great topping; both crunchy and flavourful.  Thank you for sharing.

This is a great way to use up a few over-ripe golden delicious apples. I eliminated the nuts and salt and used a cup of quick oats mixed with about 1/3 cup brown sugar, and kept the other ingredients as instructed. I was worried that it would dry out and covered with foil for the first 20 minutes, and then removed it for the remaining 25 minutes to allow the topping to crisp. Not too sweet, and absolutely delicious! If I had known I would be making this, I would have got some vanilla ice cream to go with it. Will make sure I get some tomorrow.

This dish was so simple and delicious, I even added raisins. I also love how customizable the recipe is, I added more nuts and spices because we love that. Usually crisps, pies and cobblers have a high fruit low crust ratio, I looooove crust. For this recipe I just made extra and it was amazing, my family loved it!

Very good recipe.  I had a few blackberries (not enough to make a pie) so I sprinkled a few on top of the apples before I added to topping.  Really, really good!!

This gets 5 stars!  Easy and Yummy!  I didnt have walnuts but had pecans, I used 5 apples because thats what I had. I added more than a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg and it was perfect.  My 10 year old has a friend over who is a picky eater and he said this was amazing!  Its a keeper!

Yummy Good! I liked that this one didn't have the oatmeal in the topping...it came out so crispy on top and I love that. I added Cardamon to the topping for flavour and I didn't precook my apples. Used Granny Smith and came out absolutely delic!

yum this was delicious.  I didn't have pecans and only used walnuts, but it was very tasty.  I doubled the recipie  and  used a 13x9 baking dish. Great way to use up all the organic apples from the CSA box. I didn't peel the apples since they were organic, but sliced them thinly so that  the peel was very tender and soft. This added nutrition and texture.   Will make again!  But as another reader mentioned,I might mix the flour with oatmeal to give it more texture.

Terrific!!!  Tastes even better warmed over...if you have any leftovers.  I did add whole oats instead of the flour.  This is a solid and simple recipe.  We definitely will make it again.  Thanks!!!

This recipe is good, but it didn't taste like apple crisp - not what I was expecting anyway. I don't have a food processor so I just chopped up the nuts and mashed the crumble together with a fork

Great tasting and easy enought to make during the week. What's nice is that you can easily adjust this recipe to feed as many or few people as you need. Used granny smith apples, and they baked up great. I made this for two people in individual ramekins. Delicious!

This is delicious. Made it as a side dish for a roast chicken dinner. We ended up eating it for desert. Husband ate the leftovers at night and he usually doesn't like sweet dishes like this. I've made it several times now and the only thing I do different is to use a little less sugar.

This an excellent version of apple crisp! The only changes I made were to substitute 1/2 c. oatmeal for the 1/2 c. flour, and I used 1/3 c. brown sugar instead of 1/2 c. My whole family really liked this.

Perfect and super easy to put together when you have only apples laying around. I used this recipe for last minute dinner parties and it went over super well. I personally used oatmeal to replace the nuts.

Loved this recipe!!  The nuts make it really tasty!  I did make a variation to make it less fat and refined sugar and we loved it.  Instead of using all the sugar, I cut down the portion and used raw sugar instead of brown sugar. I also replaced the butter with apple sauce and honey - I didn't measure it out, but rather just made it into coarse crumbles.  My family thought it was great - definitely a keeper - I may have to make it at least once a week!

This was excellent!  Easy to make with not too many ingredients, and so good.  I did add about 1/2 cup blueberries because I was short an apple, but I think that was an amazing addition and will keep making it this way.  The topping is the BEST topping I've had, with the walnuts in it.  I also sliced the apples instead of chopping...

I made this for Christmas dessert and everyone LOVED it!!! I only used pecans and used the larger pieces, it gave the crisp a great texture. I also like that it doesn't have oats in it because pecans are still crunchy the next day... if there's any left.

Fantastic!! So tasty. The nuts give it such a rich flavour. I agree that perhaps more apples would be better. I did not have any butter so used spread which meant I had to add extra flour and brown sugar to get the crumble consistency needed.

NO OATS!! Finally an apple crisp recipe without the annoying texture of oats; just a real crumb topping.  I found that you can add an apple or two more while still cooking them all evenly; for a "fuller" crisp! Yum

I tried this recipe and the flavor was awesome.  I did not however have the consistency that the recipe said I would to cut up into bars.  The apples did not stick to the crust and falling all over and the crust stuck to the pan.  Not sure how I failed this.  But, I will try again because the ingredients together were amazing.

This recipe was amazing! My only suggestion is that you use at least 3-4 more apples than it calls for. The topping to apple ratio was defiantly not equal. :D

I thought this was good but instead of a dash of cinnamon, I used 1.5 teaspoons, a half teaspoon of nutmeg, and two thirds cups of oats instead of the walnuts.

Very healthy, good tasting as a healthy snack, my toddler loves it.  Next time I will try and make it more moist by adding some apple sauce.

YUM!!!  Only changed one thing out of necessity...used oatmeal instead of pecans.  Oh, and used apple pie spice, about 1/2 tsp or so.  Very good and easy.

Extremely good. Interesting apple crisp recipe, slightly different from the norm. My boyfriend flipped over it. A keeper, right next to the oatmeal topped crisp for those times when I have both walnuts and pecans on hand.

I added Craisins to the apples to add just a little different flavor. The topping is amazing. The nice nut flavor instead of being overwhelmed by flour.

The recipe was delicious, only change was I only quartered the nuts instead of using a food processor. I prefer the taste of the nuts as chunks in the crust.

Made it last night! Followed recipe exactly and it was delicious but it’s not exactly an Apple crisp...more like apples & nuts mix. Very delicious and sweet but I would have added oatmeal. Next time i would not put tin foil on top for the mixed oven bake, it made it too mushy and not a crispy top.

Simple and DELICIOUS! Only had pecans and three royal gala apples on hand but still turned out amazing. Didn't need ice cream at all, was great on its own. Thank you for sharing. Will definitely be making again real soon.

Delicious! 
Based on other people's reviews, I did half the butter and used less brown sugar. I also added in 1/4 c of oats to help it be more of a traditional apple crisp. Everyone who ate it loved it!

Loved it- just added one more apple and baked in a 9x9 pan. Didn’t have walnuts, but used pecans and almonds.

Reading all the reviews on this recipe, I gave it a go. It's delicious! So very easy, came out very pretty, and my lunch group loved it. I did add  the vanilla and oats as suggested and I also drizzled the finished product with a delicious homemade caramel sauce. I also had a bowl of whipped cream to top it all off. The nuts made the crumble delightfully crunchy-I'll be putting this recipe on my go-to list of fast, pretty desserts.

I am really trying to break the embarrassing reputation of being a horrible baker, and I just got off to a great start with this!  The amount of sugar is not so necessary.  So it is okay if you are considering cutting back  on it.   I added some oatmeal like some of the others suggested.  I have old fashioned oats that I just grabbed a couple of small handfuls and rubbed my hands together to crumble it a little. Also, I like more primitive cooking so the blender is out of the picture.   Using a pastry cutter works wonders to blend in the butter well without over processing it.

I made it last night for the first time and it taste so great until my family ate it all in one night, so I’ve made another Apple crisp this morning! Plus I had so many apples that weren’t being eaten quickly anyway, I decided to make an Apple crisp! Great and easy recipe!

Great simplistic recipe! I picked this recipe cuz I was out of oatmeal. Anyway...I did add a tiny bit of lemon juice to toss the apples in as I was chopping. I also had 5 apples (seconds) all a different kind....so I will say, firmer apples are always a good choice for baking and I always use at least 2 types of apples (usually Granny Smith & another firm yet sweeter variety). Once all apples were chopped I added a few Tbls of water to the bowl and tossed them w/ lots of cinnamon & nutmeg....cuz I love cinnamon. I had plenty of topping....and since my walnuts were already pretty finely chopped I didn't bother with a food processor. But it all turned out great! And not overly sweet either. I'll definitely make this again.

We really enjoyed this recipe . . .as usually, I had to tinker with it.  I added 1/2c butter instead of 4 tbsps.  - as well as 1/2 oats and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the crumple.  I used a pastry blender (vs a mixer) so as not to over-process and get a nice crumbly topping.  SO yummy!

Wonderful flavor.. I used Granny Smith apples.. I stuck to the recipe except added a packet of instant pumpkin spice oatmeal for the topping.. and dried cranberries to the apples.. I should have added a lil more butter for the topping.. That was my mistake! I will make this again the same way.. Just add more butter!

Made this and it was good!  Varied it a bit:
- probably used the equivalent of 5 good sized apples cut in 1/2 inch slices.
- used oats in place of flour (same amount)
- didn't have pecans so I used chopped almonds in place, plus the required amount of walnuts.
- used at least 2 tablespoons EACH of cinnamon and nutmeg
- broiled it for the last minute or two just to crisp it up
Delish!! :-)

Ok, so in the end, it turned out pretty well but I altered a few things since I was worried it was going to be too dry. First off, I  added lemon juice to the mix right before the 20 minute bake, to add a bit of juice as well as sugar to add sweetness in fear of the crisp lacking sweetness. Also, I added some vanilla extract in the apples to add a traditional scent, but it is definitely a good option. All in all, it was pretty good, but I'm not sure if this was my flaw or the recipes but the crisp top itself was a bit erm... salty. Not too badly though, just a noticeable tingle of salt in every bite. Good to bake, just lower the salt. :)

I used 5 medium Gala apples, peeled and cut into small chunks. Also cut the sugar and flour down about to 1/3 cup, mixed butter (3 Tbps) in with a chopper as I did not want to take my food processor out. I made 4-6 servings from a 7 by 9 in. glass pan. We ate the dessert warm with butter pecan ice cream on top . Rave reviews. One guest said " the nuts made this so good". I used chopped pecans.

Great topping - will definitely use it again.  Personally was not fond of the walnuts in the apple filling and I should of used a tarter apple since it was a bit too sweet for our tastes.  Based on the reviews, I increased the topping by 50%.  Overall, a solid 5 star pie that was super easy to prepare (used store-bought crust) and impressive taste overall, nice consistency and great ratio/mix of spices.

This basic recipe is delicious. I followed the suggestions of several other reviewers and increased the brown sugar to one cup, used chopped pecans and walnuts eliminating any processing, and added raisins. As usual I changed butter to oil due to allergy.  It was a great way to use fall apples - I will add this to my favorite recipe list.

Excellent and easy to make.   I don't usually bake because I'm not a recipe follower.   My friends were surprised to hear I was attempting to "bake".  The only change I made was to sub oats for walnuts, kept the pecans but left them roughly hand chopped and cut the butter and dry ingredients by hand rather than w a mixer.  Which made the topping thicker.

This was really, really good for people who like it lightly sweet and full of apple flavor. The only thing I will do differently next time will be to add the nuts at the end of the processing so they are not so ground. People that are expecting the chewiness that oatmeal provides may be disappointed, but I think the nutty crunch makes up for it. Make sure you use sweet or sweet-tart eating apples or it will be too tart. My pink lady apples still retained their shape but were very tender.

Quick, healthy, & tasty! I transferred the 20-minute spiced apples to a casserole dish. For the topping, I used walnuts and almonds because I didn't have pecans. Also, I added a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice, a quarter cup of dried cranberries, and a slash of maple syrup.

Fantastic! I used Earth Balance in place of butter and used only 2 tablespoons.  Skipped the salt and subbed oat flour.  It was delicious and I didn't even feel guilty eating it.  I enjoy the flavor of the brown sugar over the white sugar some other recipes use.

I added a sachet of golden syrup quick cook porridge oats and left out the nuts for the topping. I didn't pre- cook the apples but cooked for 45 minutes after adding topping.m Result was fab with custard.

Made with Yellow Transparent apples...brought to celebration and it was gone in no time. Even caught a friend clearing off my non-stick pan with a fork :( Next time, glass pan so when they are eating every morsel...it doesn't ruin my stuff!

I followed this recipe exactly and was very impressed with the result! It was just delicious with a nice full flavor and very nicely balanced ingredients. The nutmeg added a very nice touch, too. I'll definitely make this again. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Really Tasty! I added a full cup brown sugar and a little oatmeal to topping. My family is picky about desserts. They kept saying how good it was. I have to admit, i had to get a second helping myself. It was sweet but not rich. I saved the recipe and will definitely make again.

I usually am a huge fan of apple crisp.  However, I found there was too much toppings to apples and it overwhelmed the taste.  I do believe it would be tasty with more apples.

This was very good and easy to make.  It's very nutty tasting. I wish the topping was a bit crisper.  My food processor made it very fine in texture.  I would add 1T more butter next time I make it.

I tweeked this recipe to my tastes...added raisins, brown sugar, and a few dashes of ginger to the apples, and used sliced almonds, pecans, walnuts, nutmeg, and coconut to the crumble topping! I also used whole wheat flour and brown sugar to make it more health conscious. Served warm with honey Greek yogurt is super yummy and healthy! But I found I need to use more apples because they cook down too much. This is a great base recipe though and can be double or adjusted very easily! :-)

It was scrumptious! I added about 1/2 cup quick oats to the topping, and I also threw in some raisins. I'm making it again today, but I don't have any raisins, so I am going to try it with sliced strawberries and see how it turns out. My boyfriend said, "OH MY GOD! Make this every week!"

Quite delicious!  I added 1 tsp cinnamon powder, 1/4 tsp clove powder and 1/4 tsp nutmeg powder to the sliced apples and mixed all in a large bowl before pouring into baking dish.   I also added 1/2 cup quick cooking oatmeal to the topping mixture and hand chopped the nuts, adding them last to te topping mixture

I found the 20 minute pre-cook too long.  My 4 Granny Smith's turned out like apple sauce.  The topping remained dry, not incorporated into the apples.  With some tweaks, would be better.

My mother and boyfriend gave a thumbs up, and my boyfriend doesn't even like crisps/desserts.  I also enjoyed it very much!  The only thing I changed was adding instant oatmeal for the topping, as some of the reviews said, that worked out wonderfully.  It was very tasty, and I'm planning on making it plenty of times again! Thanks for the great recipe.

I threw in a little vanilla and some hazelnut coffee syrup to the flour mixture to enhance the flavor. I didn't have enough butter on hand, so I had to use 3 parts butter and one part oil, but it still tasted good!

After going apple picking and trying to use up all my apples..this is the apple crisp I've been the most pleased with! There were a couple differences...I used 1/2 c. almonds and 1/2 c. raisins instead of another nut. I also only had 3 apples, but kept the recipe the same, b/c I was in a sweet mood :) Thanks Claudia!

This is the best apple crisp recipe I have ever tried. I have tried many similar recipes but this one is tops. I recommend adding a tablespoon of Frangelica to the oat mix. This "kicks it up a notch" or if not the recipe can certainly stand on it's own. My family loves it!

This came out pretty good, especially since I accidentally added white sugar instead of brown sugar!

I'm not a crisp expert but this came out great. I tossed some granola with the flour and sugar mixture. Came out great- couldn't stop eating it.

It tasted good, but it was too dry for my liking. I think it needs something a little more, but I'm not sure what...
