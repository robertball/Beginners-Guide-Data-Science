Spicy Unstuffed Cabbage Haiku: "Halved the recipe, used all ground beef, no sausage. This sure makes alot!" So the submitter of the recipe is right; even in half, this makes a ton! As it resembled a cabbage roll's guts, I made rice alongside it for serving, but found that the leftovers the next day that had been mixed up w/ the rice, were far superior. Wasn't too thrilled w/ the heavy vinegar taste, and felt that it could've benefited from the addition of minced garlic, so when I make this again (which I will as we really did like it alot), I would serve it mixed w/, instead of on top of, rice, reduce the vinegar, and add garlic, and probably make a full batch, as I imagine extras would freeze nicely for a reheated casserole later on.

**EDIT**  When I posted this recipe I didn't realize that I had left out to transfer the cooked and drained meat to a Dutch oven or a large soup pot.  You can even use a crockpot if you desire.
The amount of spice you add is all up to your personal taste.

This was delicious. Even the kids liked it. I sliced the cabbage so it was long and thin and told them it was sort of like spaghetti.

I'm rating the recipe 5 stars not because it's the *best* recipe in the world, but because it's one of the best recipes for 'unstuffed cabbage' that I've found. I did add a bit of brown sugar and added rice to the dish (increased the liquid to do so). I also added some oregano. As other reviewers mentioned, this definitely made a LOT. But I wanted (individual) meals to put into the freezer so this was perfect.

This reminds me of my mom's "cabbage casserole" recipe that consisted of 1 head of cabbage , 1lb ground beef and 1 can of condensed tomato soup) only better!!! I grew up eating my mom's recipe and it was one of my "comfort foods" but my family didn't care for it so I tried this one. I halved the recipe like other reviewers suggested but kept the whole cabbage. I also used ground turkey only and added more salt and some ground pepper. It was delicious! (Sorry mom! This recipe is better!)

Thank you for sharing this! I loved this dish! This is going to be a favorite I'll make a couple times a month, and it's very hearty! 

I made quite a few changes because of the ingredients I had on hand and to increase the variety of veggies, which included the addition of 1 small leek, a large stalk of celery, about 1.5 cups sliced carrots, and about 1 cup diced apple added in the last 2.minutes of cooking.  Also, to aide digestion, I added a couple tablespoons of fresh. finely minced ginger root.  I sauted the mirepoix with the leek and ginger root about 10 minutes, over med-low flame with a tablespoon of olive oil and a few spoonfuls of water in the last few minutes, as needed. I only had a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes, so I added a 1/2 cup of water. Also had to substitute white wine vinegar for plain. 

To make it a bit lighter, I only used 1/2 pound cooked sausage and about 4 oz. cooked ground beef. This was more than satisfying, and reduced cost and calories. To beef up the protein and fiber, I served it with steamed quinoa, and the flavor of the grain was the perfect compliment to the smoky, chili spices. Finally, I forgot about the tomato paste until after the dish was done, and so I added that at the end and only heated it through; this worked really well because it kept the bright, high notes of the tomato from mellowing through cooking which was surprisingly perfect. Shared some with friends who aren't big vegetable lovers, and they asked for seconds and skipped

Freakin delicious!  And I don't usually rate things on here, but I am too grateful for this recipe to pass it up.  We skipped the sausage and went with the 1 lb beef alone.  We used fresh tomato in place of canned 1:1, but otherwise kept true to the recipe and it was GREAT.  Thanks!

Loved this.  I used crushed tomatoes and omitted the tomato paste, added 2 carrots, 2 celery stalks and 1/4 cup of Thai sweet chili sauce.  Great low carb meal.

Loved this recipe.  Selected this recipe primarily because my son is on a low carb diet.  He raved about the wonderful flavors and textures.  Made it as written using half venison and half spicy breakfast sausage with two large bags of store bought shredded coleslaw.  Be sure to use your largest deepest fry pan because it makes a lot and takes some time to melt the cabbage down into the sauce.  The result is well worth the effort though.  A definite low carb keeper.

I think its a great starting point, but in the end I had to make some changes to enhance the flavor. I did not have diced tomatoes or distilled vinegar, so I substituted with tomato sauce and apple cider vinegar. I also added 1 red pepper and did not use ground beef because I didn't think the recipe needed that much meat. The edit by the author to cook the dish in a dutch oven or in a pot on the stove is very important. 

My grocery store did not have a great variety of pork, but in retrospect if you have access to chorizo it might add to the flavor. I also supplemented the flavor by adding two bay leaves, about 3 teaspoons of ground sweet basil, and a small handful of cheddar cheese before serving. It does make a lot, but I am anticipating the left overs.

I selected this recipe because cabbage rolls are a tradition in our family and this seemed a quick version. It was delish! I was asked to put this on the "regulars" list ...I don't have one of those but I guess I do now and I guess that says a lot about this recipe!
CHANGES: I didn't need a lot of food (only for 2) so I cut the protein and cabbage in half BUT left everything else the same EXCEPT I added an extra Tb of the vinegar.  I was tempted to add garlic but realized that would change the character of the dish and would make it taste like some other dishes so I didn't and now I'm glad! Lastly, I DID cover the pan and just stirred every 10 min for 30 min. I served the dish with rice. I hope you enjoy as much as we did. Smiley face

This was really good.  I made a half recipe, using only sausage, but it was Italian sausage.  I recommend using a regular sausage.  I also think I would like a little more cabbage in it next time, but I'll probably have to adjust the liquid if I do that.  I am one of those people who prefers veggies to meat, though, so it's probably just me.  Smells amazing while cooking, and I think if I make those adjustments, I'll love it!

I cut this recipe in half because it was just for two. Still we had a lot of leftovers! I used regular pork sausage not spicy,and apple cider vinegar,chopped garlic, and diced up fresh tomatoes instead of canned,with no tomato paste. I also added slices of smoked white Chedder cheese that I needed to use up. By adding cheese, it tasted like my mother's stuffed cabbage rolls,( at least somewhat). My husband said it was okay,but not great. I may,or may not make it again,at least I am trying new ways to cook cabbage,and I had to try this version.

Really good flavor profile. I used some sriracha instead of pepper flakes, and added a thin sliced apple for a hint of sweetness. Will definitely make again.

My mom has made this stew since I was a child back in the 1970's.  We are from Macedonia and this stew is a common meal.  It is pretty much cabbage rolls except the cabbage is shredded so no "rolls".  :)

Also, she makes it either with fresh cabbage or sauerkraut.  More often she makes the sauerkraut version.  She also ferments her own cabbages.  If you do this make sure that you ferment your cabbages in a shed or garage that is AWAY from your house, cause OH YES they get very smelly.   Who farted!?  LOL!

This is one of my family's favs. I do add some extra spices and 1/2 c uncooked long grain white rice.  Yes it makes a BUNCH not sure how much is suppose to be in a serving, but it is way more than 8 servings for the whole dish.

This is a KEEPER!  Loved it.  My only regret is that I only made half a batch.   So many reviewer's said how much it makes and so they made a half a batch and said it still made "a lot."  This is one time I wish I had not listened to the other reviews. I wish I would've made the whole batch.   I made the recipe exactly as written. That said, I only had a can of stewed tomatoes. So I use them.   Honestly, I think stewed tomatoes have more flavor than diced tomatoes anyway.   I will 100% be making this recipe over and over and over again.

I would give five stars except for the vinegar.  It was too much. Next time I will use much less or no vinegar at all. Otherwise this was an easy and delicious recipe.

This was very good. I followed the recipe for the most part, but used red cabbage because I didn't have any green. I cut the recipe in half to 5 cups of cabbage. It tasted even better the next day. I also added an additional 1/4 teaspoon salt for seasoning. This makes a very hearty meal and is very tasty.

Perfect meal for chilly fall or winter days! Just like cabbage rolls, without the work! After reading some reviews, I chose to add dill, Worcestershire, and cooked rice to the recipe (1 cup dry, 2 cups water). Yummy!

I only left out the spicy part because my husband can't eat spicy.  It was fine without it, but I did add red pepper flakes back into my bowl.  Will make again!

We loved this recipe in my house!  It had just the right amount of spice level and the splash of vinegar and bit of chili powder add a nice flavor.  The only change we made was to cut the amount of ground beef and sausage in half, for personal preference.

It was a hit in my household. Made according to the recipe only adding a tablespoon of honey. The sweetness takes the edge off the chili seasoning.

This is a good, hearty meal. I halved the ingredients and it made enough for 4+ people. I think that this is a recipe that can be  changed to use what you have in the fridge. I added some cooked rice and kielbasa. Also increased the chili powder and added garlic. Very good but needs more flavor.

While the family like this, they all said it wasn't that spicy. While everyone's "spice tolerance" is different, I believe that the next time I make this, I will increase the spice amount - to keep the family happy, ya know?

Took  it to game night.  Took a while to make, but everyone seemed to like it.  Makes ALOT!!!  My original recipe callled for rice and my stuffed cabbage has rice in them so I added about 1/3 cup rice, then needed more liquid so I added a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes.

This turned out great.  It does make a lot.  I ended up adding extra beef broth to give it more of a soupy feel so I can sop juices up with bread.  My guests and I really enjoyed it.

this is a throw-back to my Polish roots.  As good as Golajki without all the trouble!  I used all ground beef, dry onion soup mix (back up on the salt) no tomato paste. Equal parts vinegar and brown sugar.  Cooked it in the  skillet on the stove top and after 20 minuets, put it in the Crock pot on low for a few hours so the flavor would intensify. Had my daughters over for girl night and Wow!  Nothing but raves and everyone wants the recipe ??????

Loved it! I used precut slaw mix in place of the cabbage. I added an extra can of tomatoes and added cooked rice as another reviewer suggested. This is definitely on the Do Again list.

It was really good and filling. We eat a high protein diet st my house so we used 3lbs 93% lean ground and 1lb hot sausage to get it higher protein. Then added a bit more broth to make more liquid.

Served this dish over rice.  Tastes great like cabbage rolls without the trouble of rolling them.  Added some chopped garlic to the recipe.   Will be making again and again.  Thank you.

I followed recipe for the most part. The only thing I added was two carrots because I needed to use them up. It made enough to fill an entire 6qt Dutch oven. I think next time, I’ll use half the amount of meat and I’ll probably exchange Tabasco sauce for vinegar and cayenne next time as well. Overall, still good and definitely an easy meal. Weeknight or weekend worthy.

This was good.  It was a little strange for me, but good flavor.  I used extra ground beef and just eyeballed the cabbage.  What I would change next time would be to substitute sriracha for the hot sauce, offering the same heat but that extra flavor.

This recipe was great, easy and quick to prepare. It was nice to use that ground venison in the freezer. It  does make a huge quantity and leftovers are a tough sell so I added 4 cups of tomato juice, a can of chili beans, dark red kidney beans, more chili powder and viola - another new meal - chili-esque stew. "Don't ask, don't tell" works at our house. Thanks for the recipe - great timing.

I used 2 heads of cabbage and found this a little lacking in flavors. Might use some herbs or Cajun/taco seasoning next time.

I made this on the stove so I added a little water too. It was very good.
