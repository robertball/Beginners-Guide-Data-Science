Extremely simple--almost foolproof to
prepare.  The result is your good, basic
cookie, nothing fancy, nothing pretentious.
I recommend a non-stick cookie sheet, or
a little non-stick spray.

where is the salt in this recipe ?  This  was bland tasting. I added salt,chopped unsweetened chocolate to the rest of the batch to perk it up and some raisins...omitted the crisco,  and did butter, could be a 5 star but not as shown, thanks for the great idea though :0)

Name says it all. Perfect simple no-fuss cookie. Good with a cup of tea. I used Pam on the cookie sheets.

Tried these when I was out of chocolate chips, but had plenty of walnuts. Pretty good flavor, like the other reviews said, nothing too amazing, just good. I'm not sure, I might have messed up, as I tried halfing the recipe and used 2 eggs, but mine looked nothing like the picture. Will try again, but don't know if they will be a fam favorite.
