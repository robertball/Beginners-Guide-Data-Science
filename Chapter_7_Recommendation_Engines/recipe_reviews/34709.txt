Totally awsome with garlic,I have tried this recipe many times, always a great item. Another way is to core the top of onion and put a tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of brown sugar instead of garlic, comes out carmalized. Vidalia Onions are a gift from God!!! (P.S. works in microwave[wrap in paper towels] also for inside camping)

This was AWESOME and we did it on the grill instead of campfire.  It tastes like french onion soup on your plate! ... went very nicely with the steaks we grilled.

We do this all the time on our gas grill. I use heavy duty foil, put them on the bottom for about 10 minutes move them to the top and cook for about 20 minutes more...they are so-o-o good!

This recipe was okay, but nothing to rave about.  The butter and garlic was not enough spice.  The onion should not be cut but rather the spices should be inside the onion. ( in my recipe I use whole onions and core a little out from the middle but not enough to go through the bottom, then place a bouillon cube and butter then pepper.  Wrap in heavy duty foil and bake or place in hot coals.)

This recipe tasted ok but didn't "wow" us.  We are very simple campers, and for us it was more of a hassle than it was worth to bring the items neccessary to make this.  It was good to try once, but we probably won't make it again.

I saw this recipe on a cooking show, but the only difference is to put crushed beef bouillon cubes on top and it tastes like french onion soup. It's awesome. You can even put it in the oven or on the grill (at least 25-30 mins) In fact I had one last night!

Made this for supper and had our brother-in-law out and all liked it very much and 
since we raise a garden this was something differnet to use up vegetables.  Will make
it again.

Amazing! This is so versatile you can create different variations. I do alter mine & have made several different ways & they always taste great. I add a beef bouillon cubes, Greek seasoning & a dash of Worchester and it tastes like French onion soup. Wrapped tightly in foil.  I have also tried cinnamon & brown sugar for a different twist. Love it. Be creative

OMG this is absolutely fabulous.  You will be amazed at how wonderfully simple and delicious this is.  I added some Greek seasoning...and instead of chopping up the garlic, I left it whole.  Only made 1 onion (to share with hubby) and I wish that I would have made 2.  Will continue to make at almost every BBQ.  Thank you for the post.

This is absolutely delicious, and very easy.  For people that don't like garlic, it can easily be omitted and the end result is great.

Very good.  I drizzled the onion with olive oil to make them slightly healthier.  While the flavor was similar to a Blooming Onion without the breading I would have liked a little more something.  To keep them healthy but add more flavor I think I will add a little balsamic vinegar next time.

These were tasty!  My parents recommended a similar idea and I used this recipe to give it more oomph with the garlic.  I baked mine in the oven at 450 as a grill wasn't available on my vacation.

This is a great idea.  I put them on the grill while the meat cooked.  It worked out very well.  You have to be an onion lover to understand how great these really taste.  Thanks.

This was great.  For a sweet alternative I just rub a little vegtable oil on 1/2 inch thick onion rings then sprinkle them with cinnamon and sugar and a dash of red pepper if you like. Then grill them until they turn brown.  Yum.

Great fall camping dish with a good steak on the grill.  Prep at home and keep in a zip lock bag in the cooler until you are ready to cook.

I like onions in things, but the thought of just eating an onion seemed weird.  this was great though. Super easy and super sweet and delicious.

We did these on the grill because we were at home and not camping.  We did use the beef bouilon and glad we did.  I would probably omit the garlic next time.  I thought they would be more carmalize however they were more like steamed.  The flavor was good, just not sure I would do again.

Great as is or try some of the reviewers suggestions - they are all great.  If we don't fire up the grill for steaks, I'll bake these in the oven.  Want to try the grill with apple or mesquite chips!

We must have had a really hot fire, because ours burned to inedible in less than thirty minutes.  Sad, because it looked like a really great recipe!  I might try again, but check on them earlier.

We have tried this recipie many times,with many variations. Our favorite is using olive oil instead of butter and adding some rosemary. Another variation came from another reviewer was adding beef boulin, greek dressing and a dash of Worceshire dressing, this tasted kind of like French Onion soup. For sweeter varaiation we use butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon.  This is a nice summer treat, and taste best with grilled hamburgers.  I have only had it cooked on a BBQ, but I am sure it was taste even better if it was cooked in the coals of a campfire.

This is an awesome recipe (even for those who do not like onions).  My 12 year old son would not touch onions until I made these.  We make them every time we go camping or when we have block parties.  Everyone wants the recipe.  Cooking the onions in an open fire is the best because the onions get charred on the outer edges but grilling at home is fine too.  I also tried green peppers this way and they were great too.  If you fix steak the same night and have leftovers, heat the steak, onions and green peppers with cumin or fajita seasoning, over the campfire (or the grill), put in warmed tortilla wraps and you have great fajitas!

delicious, I did try the suggestion of using 1 beef buillon cube for each.

the next night I placed leftover onion on top baquette bread and sliced gruyere cheese in the oven until cheese melted.  wonderful cheese bread, good appetizer.

We make this recipe often.  We add a cube of chicken bullion instead of the garlic clove.  It works well on the grill or the fire.

Okay, my version protects the flavor of the onions.  DO NOT peel them!  In our Weber charcoal grill, once coals are lit, circle the foiled onions around the coals leaving space in-between. Wrap also in foil baking potates, & alternate with onions in the circle. Remove & let cool down a few minutes.  Unwrap foil from onions, & using a fork to anchor on your plate, squeeze the onions out of their skins.

These onions are the lazy man's version of grilled onions, put them in the oven and forget them.   I could eat my weight in them.  I love these, eat them out of the aluminum foil pack but I pick out the garlic first and use it in mashhed potatoes or for garlic toast. Occasionally I add a splash of soy sauce to each packet and leave out the salt to give the onions a brown color.  They go really go with pot roast, on a sandwich with pulled pork, and on a hamburger.   Every time I make these roasted onions I also stick a few heads of garlic wrapped in foil in the oven since the cook time and temperature are the same and make roasted garlic.

These were awesome! First time I made these in the fire at camp and served it with steak and potatoes. Even those who didn't like onions loved it...

My son slices the onions down to the end, without cutting them apart.  Then he adds cubed cream cheese, munster, colby (whatever) and stuffs the cracks.  They are the hit of every cookout.  They can be done on the grill, double wrapped in foil.  Delicious!

Awesome.  I made this just as the recipe said, even putting them on the coal. Let them get caramelized.  What a great camping treat, try the Shudderuppers too!

I cooked them too long, but they were still out of this world if you are an onion lover.

These turn out excellent every time!  We make these not only camping, but whenever the grill is going.  Great recipe with a lot of flavor and pizazz.
