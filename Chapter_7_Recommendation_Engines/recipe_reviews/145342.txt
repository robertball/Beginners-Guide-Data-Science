I went looking for an afterschool snack for the kids and found this one.  It took less than 5 minutes to make, super easy and it was really good.  Instead of wheat flakes (?) I used rice Krispies and All bran.  Really yummy.

This is a tasty way to get some extra fiber into your kids if you are making them a sweet treat anyway. I brought mine to a boil as the recipe directs, but you don't really need to in order to ' let' the brown sugar dissolve - it does so pretty quickly, meaning before it even boils.  Bringing it to a boil makes these bars quite sticky and chewy.  I would just stir over the heat for about 30 seconds. Kids enjoyed these.

Easy to make, but a little too sweet for my taste. Going to trying cutting out some of the sugar next time

Substituted Honey Bunches of Oats for the plain whole wheat flakes and cut out about 1/4 of the brown sugar and this was delicious!

Delicious and very addictive! Nice break from crispy cereal bars. I used regular corn syrup, because I didn't have the dark kind on hand!
