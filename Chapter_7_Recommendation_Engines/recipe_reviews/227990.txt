Im from Missouri but I live in Egypt now. I made it for my family and Middle Eastern friends. They said it tasted as if i've been cooking this dish for years. so simply and quick. I will add this dish as a topping to my chicken burrito.

Very nice, light-tasting tomato salad, great for a hot summer day.  I've been looking for a way to use up some of my fresh mint, and it was a good addition to this salad.  I added in a little more lemon juice (to our taste) which really brightened the flavor.

My Turkish friend doesn't use the cucumber but uses either green chillis or green capsicum (depending what's on hand) and Spanish Onions. We love it! It's such a versatile and delicious salad. I recommend it with the Haydari and Koftas for Tapas.

Very easy and refreshing! I usually add a bit of jalapeno and/or habanero peppers for some serious zip!

This was amazing. The lemon juice and olive oil merged the flavors of the vegetables so that none was overpowering the others.

Wow! Super fresh and delicious. We put in 5 (on the vine) tomatoes since the 1 cup looked overwhelmed by the herbs. Then we doubled the lemon juice and olive oil. It came out fantastic. Will definitely become a go-to recipe once I figure out how to get pre-chopped herbs. That was the only pain in this recipe.... but well worth it.

Very authentic recipe.  Perfect with kebabs and tahini sauce.  I used the juice of one lemon and used about an equal amount of olive oil.  Perfection!

We thought this was fantastic (and not meant as a "topping" as one reviewer stated). It was most definitely a full-fledged salad! Guess it depends on what your definition of salad is. We loved the fresh and herby taste and since lemon is a fav in our household, this recipe hit the mark. Paired really great with falafel and shwarma but would go well with any grilled meat for a simple, yummy quick meal.

based on the reviews i thought i would have really enjoyed this.. it just tasted way too herbal for me.. i did sub cilantro for parsley and green onion for sweet onion and i cut the olive oil in half  and nearly tripled the amount of lemon juice.. i also added one crushed garlic.. still unhappy with the dish at this point, i added some salad mix (iceberg lettuce, shredded carrot, and purple cabbage) and a good amount of salt.. if the title said this was some kind of topping and not "salad" i would have understood.. this was clearly meant to be added to something, not eaten as a snack or a "salad".. it made me think of tabbouleh without the bulgur/couscous
