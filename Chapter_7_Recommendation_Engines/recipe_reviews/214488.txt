OMG, this is exactly what I was looking for.  It's restaurant quality.  The sauce is SO SO good and I think adding the lemon slices early on really makes it POP like you suggested with a beautiful fragrance and taste.  My family was very impressed.  UPDATE:  Made this for my husband's business client and he asked for the recipe to take home.  Also, someone said they thought the sauce was too acidic.. adding lemon slices in at the end only heightens the acidity, not tempers it.  I happen to love the taste of lemon like this, but that's just me.  Try adding some white wine to the first reduction, then add the chicken broth and go from there.  That might help.

When I make this recipe, I use Italian flavored bread crumbs, instead of flour, to dredge the chicken.  Also pound the chicken breasts out a little so they cook faster.  I use white wine instead of chicken broth for the sauce.  This sauce really requires some tasting to check for tartness as it reduces.  If it's too tart, add a small amount of sugar starting with a tsp.  Chicken Picata is probably my favorite chicken dish and it's truly elegant and 'company' worthy.

This dish is superb.  Very light, low fat and the sauce has a lemon infusion that is simple, yet elegant.  The lemon slices really do make a difference.  Be sure you're adding them early or your sauce could be a bit more bitter.  The oil from the rind of the lemon adds a tremendous lemony lift!  I am adding this dish as an option to my menu for my clients.  They'd pay good money for this.  I agree with the others - it is definitely restaurant quality right at home!

The reason that this might taste bitter is because the white pith of the lemon when simmered becomes very bitter.  You could just use a vegetable peeler and peel off just the yellow of the lemon

I have not made this yet.....some quick thoughts.  To stop the bitterness do not add the lemon slices to cook with the sauce, use lemon zest and finish with the butter, the white pith is what is making it bitter.  Add lemon slice when serving.  I also am going to try grilling the chicken and making just a quick lemon pan sauce with shallots, white wine, perhaps a riesling or pinot grigo and garlic, however; no chicken broth.  I would not cut into medallions leave in breasts in tact.  To thicken maybe a little cornstarch and water if necessary.  I will let you know how it turns out.
After making this, the grilling part probably not needed, pan frying would have been fine.  The sauce I made was great only wish it had made more.  Cornstarch not necessary.  But a great recipe!

This recipe was delicious with some modifications.  I gave it 5 stars because I think it would have been good without the modifications too... I just never cook exactly by any recipe.  Here is what I did differently... I pounded out the chicken but did not cut it in medallions.  I pan fried it in a cast iron skillet using olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  After the chicken, I wiped out the pan and added a little more olive oil and some margarine (I have a dairy allergic person in my family so no butter).  I added 2 cloves of garlic then a 1/2 lb of thinly sliced baby portabella mushrooms.  After the mushrooms released their juices, I added the liquid.  I used 2 cups of good chicken stock plus 1/2 cup of a reisling.  I also double the lemon juice and left out the lemon slices.  I zested one lemon into the sauce and saved the lemon slices for plate garnish.  When correcting seasoning at the end, I added a generous amount of sea salt and fresh cracked pepper and a pinch of raw sugar.  I served the chicken with the extra sauce over mini bow tie pasta.  All three of my kids ate this and my husband gave it a thumbs up and I loved it.  I would definitely make this one again!

Perfect. Well, almost. I pounded the chicken breast first; really makes it tender. It takes less time to cook, so it doesn't get tougher and drier on the outside...

Wow, I do not know what I did wrong?  I love chicken piccata.  I followed the recipe exactly.  But, the sauce was so bitter!!! Maybe, the lemons I used were the problem?  I loved the cooked chicken before adding the sauce. It was both tender and crispy.  I tried to fix the sauce by removing the lemon slices and adding white wine and a little extra butter.  I served with rice and the person I ate dinner with ate all of theirs, but I couldn't get over the bitter bite still lingering.  Although, he did not seem to notice for some reason. Make sure you use really fresh lemons!  I believe that could have been the issue, but not sure? Great sauted chicken either way.

excellent. Very light  even with the butter at the end. No bitterness from the lemon slices because I took them out after the first 7 mins of boiling.

CAUTION! It is hard to stop eating this! I made this with 1/2c Pinot Grigio and 1/2c chicken broth, 2 garlic cloves, a dash of sugar in the sauce (with the capers) and only 1 Tbsp of butter at the end and it was wonderful! I served it with green beans, salad and baked sweet potato. De-lish!

Ok for the 1 star reviews.. when you are adding in lemon or any citric to a dish, its best to add and taste.. and not just dump in 1/4 cup of anything that has a high acid level.. as the sauce cooks down the tartness will be overwhelming.. live an learn that's my motto and I have learned a lot trying out these recipes!

Here's a simple way to control the tartness of this dish:

Add 6 lemon slices and taste.. want more tart.. spoon in lemon juice to desired taste.

if you are cooking the sauce down, this will make it bitter, so..... take out a small bowl and add to this small bowl some corn starch ( about 1 tsp). Mix with water and then fold this into the sauce until it's thickens up. Usually takes about 3 minutes.. turn off the heat and it will set up nicely.. as you prep the plates for service..

Want to blow you guests away.. here's what I do to add an authentic  ITALIAN kick to this recipe:

I spice up the flour ( garlic, oregano, paprika and pepper), chiffonade basil and add 1 can of artichoke hearts ( remove oil and liquid) to the dish.. Not a fan of artichoke hearts, sliced and teamed zucchini also work well with thus dish.. 

Plate up raw baby spinach, place chicken on top of the spinach and then spoon on lemon sauce. 

Take your tongs and place on lemon slice on the center of the chicken, sprinkle with basil and serve. 

Want to make it a full meal.. add a side of  saffron rice with roasted tomatoes and garlic and your family will love it!!

Good Luck!

Spence

This was excellent.  The flavors were just perfect with just the right amount of lemon.  I used a lemon pepper seasoning from Weber to add a little zest to this and increased the garlic some, but other than that made as written.  Served with Jasmine rice, sliced tomatoes from the garden and garlic bread.  Thanks for a great recipe :)

This was awesome! I did use white wine in place of the chicken broth. I also doubled the recipe as my hubby brought home way more chicken than I asked him to pick up! Since I doubled the liquid measurement the sauce had a hard time reducing so I added some corn starch and omitted the lemon juice from the sauce. *As a someone else suggested, I removed the lemon slices after 7 minutes. I served this over pasta (linguini). The family raved about this but I did notice the missing lemon juice so I had everyone squeeze fresh lemon over their serving on their plate. The difference it made? My son said I was amazing! LOL *I also added a small can of sliced mushrooms, next time I might add a can of artichokes chopped up

Would definitely recommend using only half of a lime and not put any pieces into the broth to simmer.  The first time I made it, I had to dump the whole thing out and start over (brother).  It was sooooooo bitter and way toooo sour for our taste.  The second time came out much yummier.  should also add some salt and pepper to the sauce.  Hopes this helps someone.

Delicious.  I followed directions except I left out the lemon slices and added artichokes.  Served with grilled asparagus and angel hair pasta.  This is one of the best dishes I've made in a long time.

I did not like the lemon rind in the sauce.  It made it too bitter.  I cut the bitterness with a little sugar.  I served this over angel hair pasta that was tossed with some olive oil, parm. cheese, and parsley.  My husband liked it, the kids did not.  He said it tasted just like the dish he has had at the restaurants.  I will definitely make this again and eliminate the lemon slices.  This isn't all that healthy so we won't eat it often.

Yum! I have been testing chicken recipes to use when I cater a Christmas party for 30 in two weeks. This recipe is the definite winner. The only change I made was to add flour to the pan drippings for thickening and doubled the sauce. I have prepared the chicken in advance and frozen it. I will make the sauce the day of the party.

Very good. I used half broth and half white wine and increased the lemon juice. Because I was cooking for two people I only needed half a pound of the chicken breast. I added lemon slices early in the cooking process. Everyting was tasty; just the right amont of flavoring. I ate this dish with, "Lemon Thyme Rice," also from this website. I will definitely make this again.

This was great!  I have been making a version of this for some time and not having to pound out the meat is such a time saver.....I will be cooking this more often now.  I did use 1/2 cup of white wine and a full cup of chicken broth because I used 4 chicken breasts...and I did use a less amount of lemon per other reviewers since I was feeding it to some pickier palates.  I actually placed the chicken back in the pan with the sauce and it thickened up nicely and coated the chicken perfectly.  I think I might take other reviewers advice and add some mushrooms next time.   Thanks for the recipe!

I would definitely make this again.  I just love piccata, and this sauce has just the right amount of lemon and capers.  I however, did not put the lemon slices in the sauce, as I did not have enough for the juice, but it was still delicious.  Next time I will make sure I have 2 lemons.

I had been looking forward to this but was dissappointed with the bitterness.  I'm sure it was from simmering the lemons & pith (only use juice).   I liked the sauce from "Chicken Piccata and Angel Hair Pasta" better than this one, it also uses wine.   The sauce didn't thicken for me either but  I'm sure with a few minor adjustments this recipe would be good!

Well, I made this meal tonight and it wasn’t a hit, a little too lemony. I will try one more time with less lemon.

This recipe is very similar to a recipe in "The New Basics" cookbook. The cookbook, however, does not recommend adding the lemon slices until the very end. I think the early addition of the lemon slices with the peel on is the cause of the bitterness. This has been a hit in my house since the early '90s.

This was delicious. I read some of the reviews and made sure to watch out for the white part of the lemon peel to avoid bitterness. I overindulged on capers (love them!) and it turned out a little too salty (my fault). Also, I only had bone in chicken thighs on hand so I browned them in a skillet and then put them in the oven on a low temp to finish cooking through as I finished the rest of the mean/sauce. I would recommend the breast over the thighs but it all still worked out and tasted great.

First time I made this dish it had a bit too much lemon for me and my husband. 

Second time I made the dish I thinly sliced half the lemon and then gently squeezed the remaining half into the dish.  It was perfect.  

I love capers, so I add an extra spoonful or two right at the end.

Wonderful recipe.  My family loved it!  Some ratings said theirs was a little bitter, I think maybe they didn't rinse the capers good enough.  I used fresh lemons from our Uncle's tree so that really made it great.  We served it with spaghetti noodles.  A recipe to definitely try.

We really like this recipe after following reviewers advice - doubled sauce - still is pretty minimal - used 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 white wine - added diced mushrooms with capers - we love capers so added extra - kids really liked also - will definitely make again

LOVE this recipe! Everything about it is delish, the only problem is the sauce. It's a little bit unpredictable. Sometimes it comes out with a strong bitter lemony flavor and sometimes it's just right. I guess it's a matter of figuring it out. I will definitely make it again, probably less lemon juice in the sauce, maybe add a little bit of heavy cream to thicken it up.

The chicken was excellent but the sauce was very bitter, everyone was right. Cut the lemon juice in half. It also wasn't enough sauce for three whole chicken breasts and it was a lot of work to not get very much.

I'm sorry but this was not to my liking. I made it exactly as written and the lemon taste was overwhelming, and not in a good way! It was extremely tart so I had to add in a little sugar to try to make this taste better. It helped, but man, this was not to my liking I will definitely not be making this again!! The hubby was sweet and didn't say much except "I'm glad you can say when a recipe isn't good". HAH! That was his hint ;)

Ugh. This was not good at all. I'm being generous with my rating ONLY because my hubby didn't think this was as bad as I did....  I must admit, I was a bit concerned about bitterness after reading the first page of most helpful reviews on here. Oddly enough, that isn't the reason I dislike this so much. For me, it's the overpowering, mouth puckering, lemony aftertaste. Chicken piccata (at least what I have eaten) should have a very subtle "hint" of lemon to it. Some piccata recipes include capers (as this does), artichokes or mushrooms to add substance / texture and sometimes a splash of white wine for an extra level of sophistication (which I added with my broth), but they all have one thing in common - they NEVER taste sour or bitter. Belle's version managed to do both (my gosh)! My hubby asked me earlier this week if he should make dinner resies at Maggiano's for New Year's Eve. I was so eager to try to make an Italian meal at home, I said no. Now I'm SOOOOO regretting my decision. :( Served wtih bada bing bada banged potatoes (CJ McD) and buttered Italian bread, this was a terribly mediocre meal (my potatoes were a disappointment too). Oh well. You can't win them all! Thanks for sharing anyways, BellesAZ. :-)

Wow, very flavorful and fairly simple to make. I will definitely be making this again:) I did take into consideration some of the other users suggestions: I added lemon zest after taking out the lemon slices about half way through. I also used half broth and half sherry cooking wine.

Delicious.  I left out the capers, because I'm not a big fan of them.  I probably added a bit more lemon juice (I didn't measure, just reemed).  The sauce was amazing.  Will definitely make this again - maybe even with pork or veal.  Thanks!

Easy flavorful dish!! Perfect for a busy weeknight meal. The only thing I did different was in the way I prep the chicken. I cut the chicken breast horizontally and then pounded the chicken out until it was about 1/4in thick. Got this advice from America's Test Kitchen cook book. And I didn't have any parsley on hand so I left it out; still a great dish.

First let me say I am rating THIS recipe. Not the one I made changes to.  I tried this recipe 2 times. The first time exactly as directed with the lemon slices. It was very bitter.   
The second  time with my changes.    The second time around I added  1/3 cup  of chopped shallot when cooking the garlic. I also added 1/2 cup sauvignon blanc wine and 1/2 cup chicken broth I then grated the lemon rind of one large lemon into the sauce instead of adding the slices also I added sliced portabella mushrooms and doubled the lemon juice. ***Make sure you rinse the capers as they are usually stored in a vinegar brine***.   My family gave my dish (the second time around) 5 stars

This is a WOW dish which I have often used for company because it IS restaurant-worthy---and EASY.  Just be sure to add the lemon juice at the point shown in this recipe and do NOT let it sit on burner once done or you will lose a good bit of the lemon flavor.  I serve mine over capellini (angel hair pasta) which is what my fave Italian restaurant does.  YUM!

This is absolutely delicious!  My husband, who is a meat-and-potatoes guys, loves this recipe.  I altered it a bit:  I pounded the chicken breasts to at least 1/2" thick and seasoned each breast liberally with salt, pepper, cayenne and garlic powder then dredged in flour and browned each piece.  I deglazed the pan with the chicken broth and capers, added the lemon juice and butter then cooked the chicken, uncovered, again for about 5 minutes.  Delizioso!

This recipe would be fantastic if you left out the lemon slices.  Cooking lemon slices adds WAY too much tartness to the flavor.  It wasn't even edible.  Instead add fresh lemon juice and the zest of one lemon.  Also, I added fresh mushrooms and artichoke hearts.  Once you do that, it is fabulous!

Almost perfect! Instead of just rolling the chicken in flour, I beat 2 eggs with 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and rolled the chicken in that first, then put them in the seasoned flour. Fried them in a pan with olive oil and butter. Wonderful turn out! Then used the browned bits in the pan to make a sauce with chicken broth, lemon juice and capers. Added a tablespoon of cornstarch. Simmered, boiled pasta. Poured sauce over chicken then tossed pasta in pan with left over sauce. Awesome!

We loved the flavor. I added a few sprinkles of sugar when the sauce started to get bitter and that fixed the problem.  The chicken was a bit dry for how they said to do it though.  Hence 4 stars instead of 5.

Rats, I didn't take others advice about the lemon slices. I love the sauce except there is a really bitter flavor at the end which is obviously from the lemon peel. Next time, no slices. I can't wait!

Perfect Chicken Piccata!! The only BIG thing I would recommend changing is to thoroughly rinse the pan after you cook the chicken and before making the sauce. I know she mentions to take any brown bits from the bottom of the skillet. But, the sauce comes out much, much better if you just rinse the skillet entirely with water, slightly dry it, then add some cooking spray and a teaspoon of vegetable oil before moving on to step #3/before making the sauce.

This was delicious.  I made the recipe exactly as written and served over thin spaghetti.  My husband thought it was a little too much lemon flavor so I will probably use a little less the next time I make it.  Thank you for sharing.

I really like this recipe, the chicken was tender and flavorful. The sauce was simple and delicious. I really like lemon but next time I think I will add a bit less lemon and a bit more garlic otherwise I was very pleased.

This was really good. I didn't have fresh lemons, so I only used the 1/4 cup juice from a bottle..I also added about 1/4 cup white wine that I  wanted to use up. We really enjoyed this Piccata.Very much like what is served in restaurants.

This is the best Chicken Piccata I have ever had and that includes restaurants. Don't change anything. Yes it needs all the butter. Watch carefully when reducing the sauce.

I skipped the flour step. And we do not care for capers so those were skipped as well. This was delicious.

this recipe was quick and delicious.  i doubled the sauce  and put it over angel hair pasta.  i did add 1T of flour to the lemon juice and added it to the skillet to thicken it some.  my neighbor asked for the recipe the next day because i raved about it so much !  very nice presentation if you're trying to impress.  will make it again soon!!

this was wonderful!  the only changes I made was used 2 T butter and 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice in the sauce and it was still outstanding.  My husband raved about it through dinner as he gobbled it up and went for seconds :)  This would also be a great dinner for company.  Definitely a keeper!

I ended up pounding the chicken before cooking it cooked faster.  I read so many reviews about the lemon, that I wished I put more in. I put in 2 lemon slices for 5 min as well as some of the rind, then put in the lemon juice but it didn't taste as lemony as I had hoped so I just squeezed lemon juice on it at the end.  I held back on the lemon based on the reviews that it was too bitter.  I mixed the dish with angel hair pasta, it was a little drier than I wanted so maybe i will make more sauce next time if mixing with pasta.  I also did half white wine/half chicken broth.  served with green beans.  Will definitely make again!

This is one of our family favorites and I just realized that I didn't even write a review. We love this recipe! The only change that I make is to roll the chicken in whole wheat pastry flour to make it a little healthier and add a little extra lemon juice. Excellent!!

This dish is a staple in my cooking repertoire. Sometimes I add artichokes and thicken the sauce with flour because my boys ask me to, but my five stars are for the wonder of this dish as is. I serve it over garlic mashed potatoes, rice pilaf, or couscous and it's still delightful. I will probably elect to eat this as my final meal in this lifetime!

This dish was amazing! It's very simple to prepare, but it does take a little time to fry the chicken in batches. The breast meat stays really moist. I skipped the lemon slices, and just used the juice, which gave it plenty of tang. This is definitely a keeper and something suitable for company!

Excellent! I liked the idea of using a warm platter to keep the done chicken in while the others are cooking. Served this over fettuccine noodles for the kids; and because we try to keep it as LOW CARB as possible, my hubby and I ate it over sauteed julienned veggies. (I recommend jullienned onions, zucchini, and carrots in olive oil with minced garlic.)

Wow, wow, wow!! This was indeed tasty and tender, and somewhat easy. However, after reading the recipe and a few reviews regarding bitterness, I made some very slight changes. I've cooked with capers and thought 2 tablespoons sounded a bit much, so I reduced the amount to 1 tablespoon (in the future I might even bring it down to 1/2 tablespoon). Also, rather than using lemon slices I simply zested the lemon, avoiding the bitterness. This is definitely a make-again recipe!

This was delicious! I made the recipe exactly as directed except I added some sauteed mushrooms and I wouldn't change a thing except to pound the medallions thinner to create a more authentic piccata.  I think I reduced my sauce too much and it was VERY tart but that was my mistake.  I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was easy to follow and make.  It turned out fantastic and I'll def make this dish again.  The only thing I'd do next time is def add the capers..which I was out of at the time I made this dish.  The sauce was excellent, use fresh lemon, and you won't be disappointed!!  Did find I needed more oil than specified...but overall foloow the recipe to a T and you'll be delighted with the dish!!!

Used lemon zest rather than sliced lemon, as others suggested, and also added a little white wine. I love lemon, but the sauce was much too acidic and agressive for me. I would use less fresh lemon juice and more chicken broth next time.

This was good, but quite acidic. I added some honey at the end, which helped cut the acidity a bit. Next time, I may use less lemon juice.

FANTASTIC! I have actually been looking for this recipe forever!  It tastes exactly like a dish here served at our favorite Italian Restaurant.  I cooked it as is, but next time, just to make it exactly the same, I would mushrooms.  This is really great served with a small side salad and a 3-cheese macaroni (shells).  SO glad I found this recipe!

Excellent dish! I did modify by using thin sliced chicken breast and only using the lemon zest (per other reviews that commented on bitterness). Definitely will eat this delicious and easy dish again!

Oh, my, this is good! And, it is so foolproof it is almost guaranteed to come out good every time! I followed the recipe, except for two small changes; I didn't add garlic because I was using garlic infused extra virgin olive oil, and I didn't add the lemon slices, although that sounds quite good. The lemon flavor is just right, not too faint and not overpowering. Try it! You will be glad you did.

This was a fantastic and easy dish to make. As i started to cook, i realized i did not have any lemons, but instead i had some oranges. I used half an orange sliced up and squeezed the rest of the juice in from the second half. It came out FANTASTIC!!! It was like candied orange chicken.

Not sure what I did wrong, but it didn't make much sauce. Next time I will double the sauce. I took the lemon slices out after about 5 minutes and also reduced the amount of lemon juice per other reviews which was a good choice. Not sure I would've liked it if it had more lemon in it.

Excellent and pretty simple to prepare.  The only change I made was to use 3/4 C chicken broth and 1/4 C dry white wine.   I served it with white rice cooked with a bit of chicken broth and 1 tsp lemon juice.  Very nice with the lemon sauce over the chicken and rice.  Definitely better restaurant quality.

So I just made this for my family. I have to give it 3 stars because of the fact that this was WAY too lemoney. I ended up having to try and dilute it with more broth. It didn't help that much. I had read the previous reviews so I did add less lemon and it was still WAY too sour.

Fantastic. I used 4 breasts ( for leftovers) and pounded them pretty thin. I also used 1.5 cups chicken broth for the extra chicken and 2 cloves of garlic. I cut the chicken into around 1 inch pieces. I cooked them in 2 batches. I sliced the half lemon very thin. After the butter was mixed in I added the chicken back to the pan to reheat as I didn't use the oven to keep warm. I served this with Vermicelli. I will definitely make again. Thanks!

I made this the other night for company. Usually I make more food than we need. This chicken was so delicious, not one piece was left. I made one little change to the recipe. I coated the chicken with a combination of flour and bread crumbs mixed together. It really was flavorful. Will definitely make this again!

Totally yummy even though I had no capers or fresh parsley and had to sub light butter for the real thing. I can only imagine how good this will be when I make it with the proper ingredients.

I love this. Honestly been making it for YEARS, I am so glad I am not the only one that does not use the Wine. However if you do decide to use wine in this don't skimp or youll regret it.  I love Capers, someone was talking about the bitterness, what people have to realize is that a Caper is part of the olive family and has a bitter lemon Flavor that I just love; However if it is something you can't handle them omit them and add a touch more lemon. Its great.

This is exceptional! My husband thinks I'm the best cook ever. The sauce is awesome. I did add a little more chicken broth but everything else was just as the recipe called for. He's a big fan of veal piccata - at our favorite Italian restaurant- but loved this just as much. Thanks for the recipe.

Oh my goodness--this dish is stellar! I made it tonight, following the recipe almost exactly (I added an extra clove of garlic). My husband and I both gobbled it right up. I wish there were leftovers! Next time, I'll remember to double this recipe. Thank you!

Really a well done dish.  I used a bit more garlic, some extra lemon and lemon juice and extra butter to create some additional sauce.  The lemon flavor is very subtle when it cooks down.  Raving success with the wife and kids.  My 4 year old ate two helpings!

This recipe was pretty easy to make and we really loved the flavor of the chicken.  I did modify a bit: 3 cloves garlic and I doubled the lemon juice amount (lemon fans in this household).  I would make this again in a heartbeat.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used thin chicken breasts and bonelss thighs for the dark meat lovers.  Also used an eggwash (eggs/milk or h&h) along with the flour, which I tweaked and made it half parmesan cheese & half flour.  Double dip the chicken before frying (egg, flour, egg, flour)
The sauce needed double the butter for our liking, and I doubled the sauce recipe so it can be used on the rice pilaf & asparagus, which is our standard sides for this meal!  A classic!!!

This was pretty good all the way up to adding the 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice.  After adding the fresh lemon juice it was just way too tart - I couldn't bring it back to the flavor prior to adding it.  What a shame because the chicken was cooked well but the sauce just killed it.

This is one of those recipes you can adjust the ingredients without ruining the basic intent.  Thanks LemonLush for sharing this one!  

I used 2 skinless/boneless breasts cut them in1/2 lengthwise and pounded down; one was larger so I cut it in half too.  I like doing that as it makes the end presentation look fancier...  Did all browning in a little olive oil (to avoid dairy) adding more as needed but just to finish browingn the chicken .  

Once chicken was nicely browned and removed to warmed platter, started adding sauce ingredients. Here's where tweaking to taste is easy.... I loved the lemoney favors but if you don't 'adjust'.  I added more capers with their juice and flavor and thickened the sauce a little more with flour.  And again omitted the butter. End result? Well let's just say there weren't any left overs and I will make this again!

The Lemon Slices should ONLY be used for decoration.  The white pith in lemon is EXTREMELY BITTER, and that bitterness will be transferred to ANY sauce you use it in.  For lemony flavor, you need to add lemon juice and lemon zest to flavor the dish. That way you are not adding the bitter pith. For decoration at the very end, add lemon slices without cooking them with the sauce.  If you want the lemon slices to look cooked... cook them separately in another pan or grill them before adding to the finished sauce.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because I like a little more flavor in my flour...I used Emeril L.  Cajun spiced flour.  I also left out the capers...I know..but my husband will not eat them..instead I garnished with a tiny bit of chopped black olives..didn't have chives..so chopped also for garnish a little green onion.
I blanched spinach of a few seconds in boiling water and immediately cooled in ice water.  I let it drain in a collander.  It made a fantastic low carb meal without the pasta.  I topped the spinach with lemon chix piccatta..delicious.

We loved this recipe!  It was very easy to prepare and tasted delicious.  We added sliced mushrooms with the garlic, and sauteed them before adding the chicken broth.  Next time we will also add thinly sliced onions.  The sauce was a little too thin - I probably should have reduced it longer, but it was delicious nonetheless.

Abosolutely delicate lemon flavour. I pounded the chicken to a thick scallopine size before medallion cut to quicken the cook time.

This dish is superb. Very light, low fat and the sauce has a lemon infusion that is simple, yet elegant. The lemon slices really do make a difference. Be sure you're adding them early or your sauce could be a bit more bitter. The oil from the rind of the lemon adds a tremendous lemony lift! I am adding this dish as an option to my menu for my clients. They'd pay good money for this. I agree with the others - it is definitely restaurant quality right at home!

I used 1.5 lbs of boneless skinless chicken tenderloins and cooked them whole.  Doubled all of the ingredients for the sauce except the lemon and butter.  Omitted the sliced lemons from the sauce.  Needed to add a little cornstarch to thicken.  Excellent flavor.  Husband and 12 year-old daughter raved!

Sooo yummy! I didn't have any lemon in the house, but did everything else according to the recipe and it turned out amazing :) I paired it with rice pilaf and I plan to serve it for friends who are coming for dinner this weekend.

This was really good and was easy to make! I did not have capers so made it without. I served it with spaghetti and fresh grated Parmesan cheese. My youngest son who is a really picky eater loved it. Cleaned his plate. That rarely happens!

I followed others advice and didn't make medallions, though, if I have a larger crowd to cook for, I think it would be a good idea to stretch the chicken out. That said, this was amazing! The only change I did was to replace 1/4 cup of broth with sweet vermouth to offset some of the lemon's tartness. My husband loved it too, I had no leftovers at all. Great recipe!
Updat: I made this last night and added sliced baby portabella mushrooms, was enen better! Family was wanting to lick the pan. LOL

Just finished dinner and wanted to rate this recipe immediately. I did something unconventional. I pan fried catfish fillets, dipped in buttermilk and seasoned panko crubs. Set them in a cookie rack in the warm oven as I made the sauce. Approximately 4 mins each side of the fillets. Made the sauce as written but increased the garlic to 3 cloves. Also removed the rind on the thin lemon slices. No bitterness. Served the piccata sauce on the side so that the fish wouldn't get mushy. Fabulous!Ladeled a tbsp or two on the fish,  leaving sides unsauced to taste the crunch of the panko crumbs. Will absolutely make this again. Thanks. Lemonlush!

This was pretty good.  I didn't have Chicken stock so I used beef instead.  Maybe that is why mine wasn't that good.  I think next time I will put a little less lemon juice since it seemed to take over the dish.

This was great.   I made a bit more sauce by adding a cup of white wine and increasing the lemon.  I avoided adding the lemons difrectly to the sauce.   I also used a wheat flour and it gave it a little more fiber.  Serve with Mash potatoes to use a little bit of the sauce.

Beautiful AND tasty. I would agree with other reviewers-- it CAN get bitter. If you have a zester, definitely use only the zest and the flesh of the lemon, and leave the pith out. But I did the best I could with a knife, and mine was definitely palatable. (Meaning, delicious.) Next time I'll use some white wine for chicken broth-- I was out this time, but it would have added lovely depth.

We were really excited to try this dish, it has everything we love.  Unfortunately, it was barely edible.  It was way too sour.  We used fresh lemons which may have been some of the problem, but it's sharp edge is just too much.  Sorry.

so wonderful - My husband really loved this, and he isn't one to gush....Next time, for my own personal taste I might not be so heavy handed with the lemon.  I think I might skip, or only add a scant amount of extra lemon juice.  I also added mushroom to mine - after removing the chicken I added the mushrooms, then also removed them from the pan before adding the liquid - delish!

WAY too much lemon. I love lemon, so I didn't heed all the other reviewers warnings... but I should have. If I try this again I will omit either the lemon slices or the lemon juice or at least cut way back on each. Otherwise, it prob would have been very good.

Theoretically, this recipe apperared fairly straightforward. As a beginner (well, I've now been cooking all the household and guest meals for about six mnoths), I found this to be the most stressful I had so far undertaken.  There is a lot going on at the same time ... the floureing of the chicken, simultaneously with the rotational sauteeing of the chicken (... i.e. no overlapping in the frying pan) and plcing the cooked parts in the oven.  The sauce is created sort of piecemeal, with

This recipe is a keeper.  One tip: Make sure to cook the chicken shortly after dipping it in the flour, as close to immediately as possible.  I waited about 10 minutes and found that the flour was absorbed into the meat and it needed another dip.  Sauce was REALLY GOOD!

Loved this recipe.  Glad that I read the other reviews before I made it so that I knew to add the sugar.  It was very tart.  Next time will make it without the lemons and just use them for the platter with the chicken.  Will make it again.

Chicken was excellent and sauce was lemony without being bitter.  I was impatient while browning the chicken in batches (which might have been the 2- and 4-year-olds tugging at my legs), but after that the sauce came together quickly.  But the browning stage is a good time to get water boiling for pasta/veggies, etc.  Regarding how many lemons to use, I used only one, but I'll confess I squeezed some of the juice from the half that was supposed to be dedicated to the slices.  That is, I cut a lemon in half and squeezed every last drop of juice from the one half, then I squeezed just a little more juice from the other half to get that 1/4 cup, and finally I took the partially-squeezed half and sliced it thin for the required slices.

This was delicious.  The only thing I didn't do was add the lemon slices.  I'd rather add those at the end as a garnish.  I also added some corn starch and to thicken it up, and some white wine for flavor.  Next time I think I'd like to add a little cayenne pepper, but as is...is wonderful.  I will definitely be making this for company.

After I made the sauce and tasted it I thought I was going to have to throw it out because it was so bitter. It ended up being okay once on the chicken and pasta, but still had a really funny bitter taste to it. My husband didn't like it either. Would not make again.

This recipe is awesome, simple and delicious. I used four cloves of garlic and doubled the ingredients for the sauce. My family and I loved it. Thanks for submitting this recipe, it will become a regular in my recipe rotation.

Mmmm deelish!  I used chicken thighs instead of breasts, the skin fried nicely!  My only strays from the recipe were due to preference- no capers & 4 cloves of garlic.  It was really easy to make- wish I'd doubled it!  Went well with roasted new potatoes- thanks! =)

I had a lot of success with this recipe...first of all because it is really good, and also I really pay attention to the comments people make !   I mixed flour with the Italian bread crumbs to coat the chicken.  
I used lemon zest instead of lemons in the sauce ( a suggestion from the comments),  I made a roux with flour and broth to make the sauce a bit thicker.  I had some heavy cream so I added about a Tablespoon to make it silky.
I served it over fettuccini.  I garnished with lemon slices.  My husband raved about it.   I didn't have parsley but I think it would've been a nice compliment to the dish.

I used coconut flour, organic lemons, dried parsley, garlic powder, Himalayan pink salt and white pepper.
My son said it tastes like a restaurant. That's high praise!
Looking forward to trying again with fresh garlic.

I took the advice of some other reviewers and pounded the breasts, breaded them with bread crumbs with oregano,salt & pepper, used some white wine and some chicken broth (mostly wine), and lemon zest along with the juice of the lemon.  I didn't marinate the breasts, but let them simmer in the sauce for about 20 minutes while it thickened. The butter is essential. I'm not a fan of capers, so I didn't use them.  The sauce was delicious! the chicken was moist and tender. I served it over soft polenta and there wasn't a bite left!

A little too much lemon for my taste.  I kept on having to add more chicken broth.  Other than that...it was really good!  Also, I left out the slices of lemon, due to the reviews.  I would've used wine but had none and mushrooms would've been a good addition.

I followed this recipe to the letter, with the exception of pounding out the chicken before cutting into medallions. 3 chicken breasts yielded 6 medallions. I liked the idea of this dish. It reminded me of something you would get at a nice restaurant, but I would make a few small changes. I would decrease the amount of butter you put in at the end. 3 tablespoons was way too much and it left a greasy feel in your mouth. I would just do a small pat of butter at the end. My family found this dish to be way too tart also, so I will decrease the amount of lemon juice by half next time and see how that tastes. Otherwise the chicken was nice and tender, golden brown and it made for a very nice presentation. Will make again.

Tried this recipe tonight and it was delicious!   I did make a couple of changes including just using the boneless chicken breast which I did pound to make it thinner and tender.   I also used white wine instead of the chicken broth. I'm sure the chicken broth would have been fine, but I was all out of it.  Also I did thicken the sauce with a little cornstarch.   I also zest my lemon instead a of using the lemon ring....with all that said it was a delicious meal and I have saved it to my recipe box !

Im not sure what I did wrong...but the lemon in the sauce was SO over powering.  I followed the recipe to a tee...but I just couldn't serve it with the chicken (which turned our really well). IF I try this recipe again, I would omit either the lemon slices or the 1/4 cup of lemon juice...both was just WAY too much.

Followed the recipe untill the very end. The sauce was kind of bitter, so I removed the lemon slices, added a bit more chicken stock, and another tablespoon of butter. Decided to continue and put it aside after it was a little thick. Surprised!!!! Everybody loved it and the favors seemed to balance together after resting. Will do it again! Thank you ;)

This was very good.  I did add more broth, increased butter to 4 T and added about 1/2 cup of wine to increase the amount of sauce.  Kept the lemon juice and slices the same.  I had to add a bit of corn starch to thicken.   Very delicious!

Made this for dinner last night.  It was fantastic! I used 3 whole chicken breasts and doubled the sauce recipe. I used seasoning salt and ground peppercorns to season the chicken first and dredged it in Bisquick instead of flour. I also tenderized the chicken first by pounding it a bit. I also followed others suggestions and peeled the lemon removing all the pith before slicing it. The sauce is very lemony, but I thought it was perfect. Served over Basmati rice.

Delicious! The only modifications I made were using fresh green onions instead of the capers and pounding the chicken breasts prior to cooking. Since I am on a gluten free diet, I used rice flour. This is definitely
I a keeper!

Loved it... Made a few quick modifications... Added 1/2 wine ( Chenin Blanc or Savgaion Blanc )with 1/2 broth... Instead of the full cup of broth.. Marinated my chicken for 45 mins in my own blend of spices... Served with bow tie pasta..

This was my first attempt at piccata and I was not disappointed,  The recipe was simple and easy to follow and made for a delicious meal (and leftovers).  Be sure to take your time making the piccata sauce, patience will pay off.

The sauce was extremely bitter (I presume from cooking the lemon slices in the sauce as it reduces). I should have read through the reviews more extensively and omitted the lemon slices while simmering the sauce, as I could see the taste improving.

This was divine, however I am rating this recipe as it is written.  Due to the small size of chicken breasts available at my local grocer, I cooked them whole and they turned out beautiful. Be careful not to overcook the breasts, as they will dry out real fast if you don't watch it.  I would never cook lemon "slices" in the sauce because of the bitterness of the rind. I just squeezed fresh lemon juice into the pan.  The amounts listed for the sauce were just too skimpy. Next time I will at least double the amounts to yield enough for four servings.  I added a heaping teaspoon of flour to the sauce to make it a little more of a "demi glace." It would have been more like runny melted butter if I didn't.  All in all, it's a great recipe with some tweaking.

Absolutely delicious!!!!! I followed the recipe almost exactly, though not sure how to get medallions out of chicken breast. And as some suggested, I took the lemons out after the initial reduction and it wasn't' bitter at all, just delightfully lemony!

This was my first time eating capers and I didnt really enjoy this dish. It was very tart, so I'll use less lemon juice if I decide to make this again. ALSO....You dont have to turn on your oven to heat up a dish, just microwave the dish to heat it up, then cover the chicken with foil while you cook the sauce.

What an amazing recipe!  Used meat tenderizer to flatten boneless chicken strips.  Substituted  1 teaspoon lemon pepper for the salt & pepper & mixed it in with the flour.  Made the sauce on the stove while the chicken was frying in my electric skillet. Used a little canola oil to make the sauce & added broth, lemon juice, sliced lemon & capers as outlined in the recipe.  Added 1 teaspoon corn starch to the sauce to thicken and 1/2 teaspoon Splenda to make it less tart.  Served on a bed of steamed spinach with garlic, lemon pepper, butter & Parmesan.  Served with a side of rice pilaf & a tossed salad...one of the best meals I've made in awhile (definitely restaurant quality)....this one is a keeper!

Just finished the Lemon chicken Piccata, and we all loved it.  I was little concered that the lemon flavor would be to strong.  But it was just right.  The only thing I did different was to add some mushrooms that I had on hand.  Will absolutely be making this again.

Great recipe. I nearly followed it to a tee. I found that the sauce wasn't thickening, so I added a slurry of 1 tbsp of corn starch+1 tbsp of cold water. This thickened the sauce up a bit too much though. I also found it to be a bit too sour. I added a couple tablespoons of chicken broth, which thinned out the sauce and also made the lemon less overpowering. Definitely taste test the sauce before serving! If it's too tart, add some broth or white wine, little by little. Overall, this was delicious though!

Yummy!!  I'm such a fan of lemons had to use this recipe and wow, was impressed!!!  I used boneless chicken thighs, didn't even really cut them up. Followed the recipe to the max otherwise.  Was a big hit with my husband.  I'll be making this again for sure!

very good simple recipe. Don't skip the butter at the end - really finishes the sauce nicely and smooths out some of the tartness of the lemon.

The chicken was juicy and tasty, but the sauce was very bitter. It wasn't too much on night one, but as leftovers, the sauce was a bit much to handle. I believe this was due to the inclusion of the pith, but I wanted to try the recipe as listed. I will make it again but I'll either zest the lemon and include the fruit and zest without the pith, reduce the lemon juice a bit, or use a sweeter lemon like a Meyer. I will update my review if I find that the changes make the recipe more palatable.

This recipe really came out great.  The chicken came out really well (I'll have to remember that whenever I am frying batches of chicken), the sauce came out perfect, and my family had a great dinner.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I made this last night for dinner and followed the directions correctly. Way to much lemon juice. The dish was to sour to eat. If I make it again I will add a little less than half the amount of lemon juice and than add more to taste if necessary.

LOVED this!!  So easy!  Didn't use lemons and just the reconstituted lemon juice but still tasted great.  It was a little salty so the low-sodium chicken broth is probably a good idea and maybe skipping the step of salting the chicken.  Served over Fetticini

This is by far the best lemon chicken recipe I've ever made.  I pounded chicken to be even, not necessarily thin.  I soaked in brine for 20 minutes (6 cup water, 1/2 c KOSHER salt, and 1/2 c sugar - heat until dissolved, and cool completely).  The chicken was amazing and the sauce was perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I was a little disappointed in this. I enjoy piccata and thought I'd try this. I, too, thought the sauce was bitter. I know others suggested not to put the slices in early but some said it was okay, so I followed the recipe to a "T". Perhaps the pith is the cause as others suggested. When I make it again,  I'll slice off the yellow or zest it.

This recipe is perfect! The sauce is exactly what I've been looking for...as someone else wrote, it's restaurant quality. The lemon I used was slightly old, but there was no problem w/ acidity. The only thing I did differently was I bought thin cutlets and cooked them without having to cut anything. Delicious!

Great dish, but needs a little improvement.  I added diced shallots and white wine to boost the flavor.  Also pounded out the chicken to cook evenly.  Other than that, it's delicious!

Restaurant quality for sure!! This was Delicious...with a capital D!! I made very slight changes: Used olive oil instad of vegetable oil; used Italian bread crumbs instead of flour; used 1/2 cup chicken broth and 1/2 cup white wine; left out the capers just because I'm not a fan and tripled the fresh parsley. My family LOVED it!! This dish will have people thinking you prepared/cooked for hours but it's easy and delicious!!! Thanks for such a great recipe!

This is an excellent recipe.  I've had the 'real' piccata in Italy and this is every bit as good.  Make sure to pound the chicken breast meat thin and don't over cook... it cooks quickly!  Also, I added a few slight fork fulls of flour to the lemon juice and blended well to make a slightly thicker sauce and it turned out just right.  If you don't have the Italian parsley, don't sweat it... I don't think it gave it much flavor and and almost ruined the look of the sauce with too much green!  5 stars though!

Recipes was very good, but I had the bitterness in the sauce too. Next time I will just use the lemon peel.  I'm sure the white pith was what did it.

FAN-FLIPPIN-TASTIC!!!  Made the recipe as is except I used olive oil and used 3/4 cup chicken broth and 1/4  cup wine.  I also thinned the chicken breast to a little less than 1/2 thickness but they could have been a little thinner.  I aslo added a pinch of sweet n low.

Absolutely amazing! I followed the directions almost exactly. I left out the capers because I do not care for them and I used Olivio instead of butter. Next time I will follow some of the other views advice and use white wine as apposed to 1/4 lemon juice.

This was soooo good. My husband gets this out and he said it was as good as he gets in any restaurant. The only change I made was to double the sauce.  Will make this again, it is a keeper!

I definitely agree with those who call this recipe "restaurant quality". If you use quality ingredients then you get a good result. I give it four stars because, as others note, the sauce is too sour when you finish. Keep the sugar handy - I added nearly 3 teaspoons to make it more flavorful. But the quality of the sauce is excellent. I only used two chicken breasts and sliced each into 5-7 strips which allowed more delicious sauce to coat each piece. Double the number of lemon slices and double the sauce recipe if you use 4 chicken breasts and want enough for pasta. I like the idea of using white wine and will try that next. Lastly, buy a nice fresh bread to serve with this recipe because you'll want to enjoy every drop of the sauce.

The only thing I did differently was use dry white wine instead of the chicken broth. The reduction sauce is much better and more flavorful than the broth!

This was awesome!  I forgot to cut my chicken breasts into medallions, so I just put a lid on them and cooked longer - still turned out great!  I used 1/4 tsp. salt & 1/4 tsp. pepper with the flour.  I used regular chicken broth instead of low sodium, as that was all I had on hand, and it turned out a little salty (capers are salty).  Next time, I'll make sure I buy low sodium broth, just for this dish.  I used only 1 Tbl. butter to reduce the fat (didn't need more than that!).  Next time, I will use only 1 Tbl. parsley - 2 was too much 'greenery' on the chicken.  I served with "Nutty Brown Rice" on this site.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  Loved the sauce!  I didn't find it bitter so it might just have to do with how old your lemons are or the type.  A splash of white wine would be great in this as well!  Thanks so much!

Like many other reviews, the sauce had a bitter taste. Also, I added fresh sliced mushrooms before adding the garlic, and instead of 1 c chx broth, I used 1/2 c broth and 1/2 c white wine, and put the warmed chx back in the sauce for a few minutes before serving over egg noodles. Next time, I will zest the lemon, then peel the pith off, and slice and take out seeds before adding to sauce. The pith, I believe, is what made the sauce bitter. I also did not have capers, so did not use them. Lemon flavor was very good; not too much. Will def make again with these revisions!

Easy but a bit time consuming, delicious results. Pounded the breasts as others suggested, fried lightly, lemon sauce was very nice, a bit strong for my husband’s taste but I loved it.  Used half chicken stock and half white wine. Doubled the sauce. Also great the next day.  You can adjust the lemon according to your tastes, I added the zest of one lemon as well. I also peeled half a lemon and put a few slices into the sauce for a bit and then removed later.  Perhaps I should have done one or the other but not both. Either way, I would make it again. Served it with the lemon thyme rice from this site. Thank you for a great dinner!

Wow!  I don't know why some reviewers found this sauce bitter.  I thought it was perfect with just the right amount of lemon flavor.  The chicken was moist and I plan to make it regularly.

Don't change a thing. Messy to make and time consuming, but well worth it and impressive for guests. Wonderful flavor. 
Lately we have been doubling the sauce.

I only  added the 1/2 of a lemon thinly sliced. I let simmer until soft then removed.  Later I placed on top of chicken for serving.  Did not add 1/4 cup lemon juice.  Also added 3 TBS capers and small jar of drained artichokes-chopped.  I mixed a little cornstarch with some of the chicken broth then added it to the boiling broth to thicken.  Delicious!!

I don't do so good with cooking at all.  I wanted to do a sunday meal that wasnt pizza or nachos. I decided to try this based on the comments.  Im glad i did. The sauce was a little bitter at first.  I added some sugar.  The chicken was a little bland and needed to be seasoned better before cooking.

I served with Knorr chichen rice.  This ia a Sunday keeper.  I will cook again with some modifications.

Delicious dish! I took the advise of another reviewer and used Italian breadcrumbs to coat the chicken.

Made without any changes to recipe. I had friends over for dinner and they said it was better than some restaurants where they have had the dish. Will definitely make again. Check out my picture.

Be sure and make double because it is that good!

I LOVE this recipe! I made it a couple of weeks ago and it was requested again by my husband. I halved the recipe for the two of us (easy to do!) And I did all the prep early in the day, including the sauce and just rewarmed it.....we BOTH love it. I am serving with Greek-Garlic Lemon Potatoes and he is Greek and loves lemons AND these recipes.

I'm so excited to have found this recipe; chicken piccata is one of my all time favorites and this recipe is completely delicious.  I'd previously tried a different one that was a complete failure and ended up trashing the whole thing!  I made this for dinner tonight and did make a couple of modifications but nothing that changed the integrity of the original recipe. 
I added some dried basil to the dredging flour and opted to use about 2 TBSP of lemon zest in place of the whole slices to avoid the bitterness others experienced.  I also doubled the sauce but used 1 cup of white wine and 1 cup of chicken broth instead of broth only.  I served it with buttered parmesan noodles and crusty bread -yum!!!
Easily one of my new favorite chicken recipes and will be going into my regular rotation. 
Thank you for sharing :)

Horrible! do yourself a favor and don't add the lemon slices and only add the juice a little bit at a time. Please taste this before you add the whole 1/4 cup. My husband said it was very difficult to eat and he eats all of my mistakes and never complains- lol. This one was tough, it was way to lemony. I read the reviews that said it was restaurant worthy and was so proud at the care I took to follow the recipe exactly. I even doubled the garlic but you could not taste one bit of it. My teenage son on the other hand could not eat it especially after taking a bite and his mouth and eyes puckered up. It is a shame as I pounded the chicken down and it was delist before I added the sauce.

I made this recipe and it came out great but I tasted the sauce as I was making it because I read reviews that the sauce could become bitter. So when it tasted bitter I added a pinch of baking soda to balance the pH levels that caused the bitterness (Per Google). My husband said that he rather eat at my dinner table with meals like this then at any restaurant.

This is one of my favorites, and thank you to all who have included suggestions. I have to say it drives me crazy when people criticize others for including their changes in their review. .......The comments, changes, suggestions based on those changes are what make Allrecipies what it is! That's WHY most of us come here for recipes! I WANT to know what worked well, what didn't work, and what you did to make it better. Otherwise, I would just read one of my 1,000 cookbooks. Keep sharing changes, friends!

This was pretty good over plain white rice. As I can not have gluten, I used cornstarch instead of flour to coat the chicken and it came out fine. I expected the sauce to be a little thicker since it cooked/reduced for a decent amount of time, but it was still a bit loose. Not bad, just not what I expected. I think next time I'll add a bit less liquid, or leave those volumes the same and add some cornstarch to thicken it a bit more. To those who think the lemon slices make it bitter: cut those babies THIN to really cook down the pith.

Made this without any changes and there was way too much lemon.  Even my SO, who typically eats everything and anything without complaint, was remarking on how bitter and acidic the sauce came out.  

To help balance out the acidity, we ended up adding a splash of milk to our portions.  The milk helped tremendously and made the dish wonderful.  

Rating: 3 stars for recipe as is, 5 stars with milk added.

The only change I made was that I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and also pounded out the cutlets.  Will definitely be making this again!! It was for sure restaurant quality!

Pretty good! VERY IMPORTANT: remove lemon slices after 5 mins of simmering (tops) or the pith (white rind) makes your sauce bitter! If you forget, add a PINCH of sugar (or substitute) Used my fav chkn seasoning before shaking in flour (use a brown bag). Olive oil ( not vegetable). Pounded the chicken & trimmed fat. Poked w/fork to allow Juices to run. Covered with foil while warming in oven after cooking. 1.5c chkn broth + 0.5c white wine instead of all broth. let sauce stand 3 mins before serving. I served with angel hair pasta, steamed broccoli and roasted red peppers

I use whole chicken cutlets and panko bread crumbs.  Keep the cutlets warm and crispy in a low heat oven, 200F, on a rack so chicken stays crispy on both sides while the pasta is boiling.  I pick my own Meyer Improved lemons (the biggest and juiciest) and double the sauce because we love it so much.  Serve with asparagus, caprese salad, crisp white wine.

First, I slice breasts into even tenders, not medallions.  Then
I use almond flour instead of regular flour and quality olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I also season the flour as directed but dredge the chicken after the first coat in 2 whipped eggs and a second coat of flour before slow browning and keeping browned chicken warm in oven.  When finished I use 1/4 cup of dry white wine to deglaze the pan, add the fresh lemon juice along with 1/4 of a thinly sliced fresh lemon half and chicken stock and capers and simmer until reduced somewhat.  I then add 2 TBS of butter to pan and remove and stir until thickened.   I then serve the warmed chicken along with the thick sauce in gravy boat to pour over the warm chicken as desired.  This is a combination of dozens of new and old recipes I have tried for years have yet to retain any leftover!!

this has always been my go-to quick dinner recipe.  An unusual hint:  Since I've had to go gluten free, I have used gluten free flour to coat.  The result is MUCH crisper outside of the chicken.  Use a rice-based flour.

I loved it.  I like garlic so I used 3 cloves.  Didn't have any capers so I substituted green olives which added such a nice taste to it.  My picky daughter liked it as well.  Placed the chicken over brown rice.  Just wonderful

So, I didn't include capers in mine because I'm too cheap to buy them for one recipe.  I also didn't realize until later than I had completely forgotten to add the parsley.  Even with this, however, this recipe was fantastic!  The chicken is flavorful and the sauce is great.  I will definitely make it again- this time hopefully WITH the parsley!

I made this exactly as stated.  I did like the chicken but the sauce never thickened and I found it sour.  Perhaps if you add some honey to sweeten it.  And if you add some flour to the pan before adding the liquid it would have thickened up.

Great recipe, I will be making this one again. I sort of combined several chicken piccata recipes on this site. I added 1/2 pound of baby bella mushrooms and 1/2 of a chopped onion to the sauce. I also doubled the amount of lemon juice but omitted the lemon slices as I was worried about it the sauce being bitter as mentioned by several other reviewers. At the very end when I added the butter, I also added about a teaspoon of sugar to cut down on the acidity. I don't really know if the sugar was necessary. Next time I'll follow the recipe more closely. My version was great, but I think the mushrooms and onion took away some of the lemon zing.

I followed the recipe as is and the sauce was way too salty and lemony.  Very overpowering.

This was perfection!! Definitely restaurant quality. We'll be having this again, soon. 

I added 1/4 cup of dry white wine & reduced chicken broth a little. The combination of wine, garlic, capers & lemon complimented the chicken exquisitely.

Sooooo good! I didn't have fresh lemon on hand to put slices in, and obviously therefore used bottle lemon juice.  Still delicious.  Adding to repertoire, definitely!

Loved this recipe!!! I put the lemons in for only the first 5 min after deglazing the pan and then removed to avoid bitterness.  I also added 3/4 cup cream to make it richer and my family was in heaven with this keeper recipe!!!

I had to create an account solely to rave about this recipe. I used Italian breadcrumbs in lieu of flour to coat the chicken but followed the sauce recipe to the letter. Easily the best dinner I've cooked at home and stupidly easy to do.

This was delish!  I did not use the lemon slices I just added about a tsp. of zest and used the slices as garnish.  At the very end I added a little cream and it was wonderful over pasta. Definately pound out the chicken!

This recipe was so easy and delicious. I was blown away by the flavors. I've been looking for something full of flavor and this exceeded my expectations. My husband even made a remark saying that it looks like a fine dining restaurant meal. I don't think I've ever eaten something this delicious in an expensive restaurant. I'll definitely be making this at least once a month!!!

My 18 year old made this last night with a friend, and it was amazingly good!  I am not usually a fan of chicken breast (too dry for my taste), but this came out tender and moist.  The sauce was a bit strong for the kids when they first finished it (not sure if their proportions were off in the lemon juice and capers), but I added in some white wine and more chicken broth, and it was delicious.  About 2 hours after dinner, I was distracted from my favorite TV show by the thought of the leftovers sitting in the fridge... suffice to say, those leftovers were gone by the end of the show!

FABULOUS recipe! My mom made this and it was a total hit. I added a bit more lemon and garlic, because I like that, plus some crushed red peppers for a bit of kick, and used Panko bread crumbs for the outside coating, after pounding the chicken (cooks more evenly) and dipping the chicken into the flour (dipping into beaten eggs in between). Really a standout recipe. I have made this with leftover (non breaded) chicken tenderloins and rotisserie chicken (just put some salt and pepper over pieces of chicken and toss with flour in the pan),  and it was still great, even without the extra breading. I sometimes thicken the sauce using a bit of cornstarch with some of the hot chicken broth / lemon sauce- make sure to take a "cup full" or so of hot broth out of the pan and mix it with the cornstarch with a fork to thin it out first  (or you will have a globby mess before putting it back into the pan to thicken). Cornstarch doesn't leave you with a "flour" taste and gives the dish a beautiful, glossy sheen. I also let the pasta "sit" in the broth / chicken mixture for a few minutes to let it absorb into the pasta before serving, and sometime add fresh spinach right before serving for a dose of veggies. If it tastes sour, I add a pinch of sugar to balance the acidity of the lemon juice (and I use store bought juice, no fresh lemons usually on hand, lol), plus a shot of white wine. I double the broth / lemon juice mixture also. This is GREAT for leftovers, if you happen to have any!

Great recipe. I used half the amount of lemon juice listed and omitted the lemons in the sauce to limit the lemony flavor.  I've made this twice and both times it turned out great.  I serve on a bed of angel hair pasta.  The recipe doesn't make a lot of sauce so I have tended to increase the amount of broth a bit to create more.

I just made this for my husband and he loved it, so did I.  Great recipe and so easy to cook. I did what Greg suggested, and used a peeler and just scraped off the yellow on the lemon, but then I cut off the white pith and added a couple slices of the lemon while cooking.  Then removed them.   I also added a couple tablespoons of breadcrumbs in with the flour along with some paprika.  This recipe is so worth it! Yummy- Gail

This was very easy to make and it tasted wonderful, I did leave the lemon slices in and found the butter mellowed out any tartness. I will definitely make this again.

This was pretty good with a few changes, some of which may have been more my fault than the recipe's. I got so into making this that I forgot to start up my rice so my sauce sat for a bit after it was completed. There wasn't much of it left by the time I was ready for it and it was very strong (not bitter like others had mentioned, just very lemony...I used lemon zest instead of lemon slices).  To make the sauce go further and tone down the lemon, I added about a cup of whipping cream and a bit of pre-mixed flour and cold water to thicken. It was still very lemony, but oh so delicious!!

But I did make a few changes.  I used Wheat flour instead of white. 1 T. of butter & 1 T. of olive oil instead of vegetable oil. 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1. And a 1/2 c. of dry white wine along with the chicken broth.  Next time I am going to double the recipe.  My husband has a large appetite and I like leftovers!

Love this dish. I have made it several times and it has always come out great. The only (and important) change I made was to, instead of using lemon slices, to cut off the peel of a lemon and use slices of that instead ... without the white part. This made it so it wasn't bitter at the end.

This recipe is restaurant quality. Absolutely delicious. I doubled the sauce part of the recipe and I would make a few changes for next time. I'm going to try half the butter and half the lemon juice. It really seemed like I didn't need so much butter which would definitely cut the calories. It was very lemony, which I really like, but I think it could be toned down just a bit.

Really good instead of using lemon slices I used orange slices and lemon juice and also I added 4 oz of sliced fresh mushrooms and sauteed them with the garlic.  I added more broth and use a little cornstartch to help thicken the sauce.  I served over couscous and steamed broccoli.  Easy and low fat dinner that will be repeated again and again.

This was great. I slightly changed the recipe to increase the sauce because my family likes a lot of sauce. I pounded the chicken breast before flouring.I browned it to slightly undercooked so that it would not dry out while staying warm in the oven during the sauce making.

For the sauce I used 1c chicken broth and 1c white whine (real wine-not cooking wine) and 1/2 cup lemon juice.  After browning the chicken I sauteed the garlic quickly and then deglazed the pan with he white wine. Once the pan was deglazed I added the broth and lemon juice. I let it boil for about 10 minutes to reduce. Then I added all the chicken to the pan with the sauce, topped with capers and let it simmer for about 5 minutes. The breading helped to thicken the sauce without adding cornstarch. 

It was fabulous--my kids raved about it and they are fairly picky. It was very lemon-y but not bitter and then chicken was melt in your mouth tender. I will definitely make this again--I served with roasted balsamic vinegar asparagus. Delicious!

This was an excellent addition to my never ending chicken recipes. I don't like lemon slices in anything, so I just increased the lemon juice by a couple of tablespoons. It came out great, without any bitterness.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. A good recipe for company. I made this a few times before I went gluten free. I'm now gluten free and made it again recently with gluten-free all purpose flour. The gluten free flour didn't affect the taste---still very good! Does take a bit of time to make though. I would have given it 4 1/2 stars but couldn't figure out how to do that.

Made it as is except, I added some white wine to the sauce. In addition, I only boiled the lemon for a small amount of time. In addition, I cut my chicken into strips. Very good and will make again!

I made this recipe the other day, omitting only the capers (didn't have them on hand) and the whole family loved it.  I did take the lemon slices out after simmering them in the sauce to avoid bitterness.  It looked just like the picture and the taste was wonderful!  It will be a regular here now.

Delicious, and easy to prepare.  I left out the lemon slices per others suggestions, and used half chicken broth and half white wine.  Served with jasmine rice.  I will certainly make this restaurant-quality dish again!

I followed the recipe exactly except for adding capers and not only was there not enough sauce, but it came out a very bitter lemon taste.  I used fresh lemons, but I think the recipe needs something to neutralize the bitter lemon more.

Delicious meal that I'll be making again and again.  As others recommended, I grated some lemon peel into the sauce when the recipe says to add the thinly sliced lemons - I didn't want the bitter taste of pith in the sauce.  My sauce didn't thicken much, but it was still yummy.  I would probably add a little less lemon juice next time because the hubby thought it was a bit strong.  I liked the strong lemon taste, but if you want something that isn't powerfully lemon, add less.  I didn't have any parsley - tasted fine without it.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil to pan fry the chicken and I thought it tasted perfect.

Family loved it, well all but my daughter who thought it was too lemony. She is a teenager, so her thoughts on food change day to day. Served it with pasta, didn't use the capers ( didn't have any) and it made a great meal. Will make again.

This was very good but I thought too much lemon flavor.  I think this was a result of reducing the sauce for too long, thereby concentrating the lemon.  I only ended up with about 1/4 cup of sauce.  The changes I made to receipe were to use 1/2 broth and 1/2 wine and I replaced the lemon slices with jest of one lemon as many people had suggested.  I will try this again as it was very good (I only put a tiny amount of sauce on the chicken because it was too strong

This was a hit with my family, I did use a little less lemon juice, and it had just the right tang I also used my cast iron skillet and the chicken got a nice brown color to it thanks for an enjoyable dinner.

Great recipe! Did make some minor changes though. Doubled some stuff because I always feel like there's never enough sauce!! Used 2 cloves garlic, a whole lemon thinly sliced, 2c. chix broth, 1/2c. lemon juice and 1/2c. butter. Also not a fan of capers at all so I used 1 can of drained artichoke hearts, cut into quarters. Other than that I followed the directions exactly and it came out perfect! Served with angel hair tossed in a little olive oil and parm cheese... de-lish. Definitely a keeper!

I like lemon but this was WAY to tart!  I think the sliced lemon would have been plenty without the 1/2 cup of lemon juice.  I will try it again and omit the juice because otherwise I think it would have been a good recipe.

This recipe is so delicious! I added a slice and squeeze of lemon to the final cooking time of the jasmine rice. Used lemon zest instead of slices to the sauce, slices garnished the meal. Thank you for sharing thie recipe, it is on the keeper list!!!

Very tasty and easy to make. Doubled sauce and added a bit of white wine as needed to keep sauce thin enough at the end.
Served over plain while rice with green beans..

This is a scrumptious chicken dish, and not difficult to make. Love, love the lemony caper sauce!  Had veal piccata at a fabulous local Italian bisto here, and I have to admit, that mine was better using this recipe! At least my husband thought so! Thanks for sharing it!

Very Good, though maybe adding the lemon slices was a little too much. The sauce was a little bitter.

Very good and easy!  I made extra sauce but didn't really need it.  My side was angel hair pasta which I placed in the sauce to coat.  I will for certain make this again!!!

My husband had never had this dish and I used minced garlic and lemon concentrate.  I did not have fresh lemons or capers I used olive oil and canola oil I also used a tablespoon of potato starch to thicken the sauce.  I added an entire box of the chicken broth then added the concentrate of lemon to taste...he loved the dish and I served with the garlic roasted potatoes

Chicken had flavour of flour only even tho I mixed half Italian breadcrumbs with flour.. sause was too tart even following suggestions ..needed to add white than brown sugar ..next time I'd eliminate  flour altogether and dip chicken in beaten egg than dredge through mixed breadcrumbs with Montreal steak spice and bbq chicken spice than deep fry it in olive oil ..

Ive cooked this dish a few times, ALWAYS without the capers because it still turns out amazing. Restaurant quality food right at home! I prepared this meal for a friends dinner with her husbands boss and co-worker, they were completely elated with the meal compliments they received.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was too bitter.  Wish I had read more of the reviews before I made it.  It also had a lot of steps involved.  Bummed that I put the time and effort in for something to come out so-so.

The first time I made this, I didn't add any sugar and it was way too bitter.  The second time I added about 2-3 tsp of sugar at the end and that made all the difference in the world.  Such a great recipe.

I followed the recipe as directed.  The chicken came out pretty good, but I agree it needed a little more spice to it and may consider using Italian bread crumbs in the future.  The sauce was very disappointing as it came out very bitter.  I tasted the sauce halfway and noticed how bitter it was and read other reviews which mentioned it as well.  I still added the capers, lemon juice, and butter to see what it would do.  While I did mellow out the bitter taste, it was still not very enjoyable.  If I had more lemons, I would have redone the sauce.  I don't know why the recipe doesn't provide any warning or tips about how it could be bitter.

Very good dish.  The only suggestion I could make is to add a little white wine, that might kick it up.

I LOVED this recipe, so yummy! I just felt that there wasn't enough sauce for the amount of chicken. The only thing I would change next time is doubling the amount of sauce that the recipe calls for. Otherwise, I'll definitely be making this again :)

Yummy!! I added one sweet onion and small green pepper to the beginning of step 3.  I sauted them until tender then completed the recipe as directed.  It adds a really nice flavor.  Kids loved it too.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper.

Far too lemony without much layer.  The dish screams for something more, like shallots or sweet onion.  The lemon is overpowering even to the capers.  The parsley, while visually appealing, has a lemony flavor also, the vegetable oil zero flavor, so I'd substitute olive oil next time and the chicken, while pretty ends up absorbing quite a bit of citrus also.  The whole dish feels very one note.  If I were to make it again, I'd add shallots, use half the amount of lemon juice, double the garlic, use olive oil instead of veggie, use regular chicken stock rather than low sodium, and add a dash of paprika at the end when plated.  I'm giving it three stars because it wasn't horrid, just needs improving.

This was very good, but definitely needed more sauce.  The sauce, if you taste it by itself, was overwhelming in its lemon flavor, but when you put it on the chicken (and pasta) it was so very yummy.  We will definitely make this again.

Yum. Made this according to the directions except for taking the lemon slices out after 3 minutes and adding 2 tbsp butter instead of 3. Oh and a splash of white wine. I will definitely be making this again.

This was a pretty fancy dish at our house, and it turned out great!  I put it over pasta.  Yum!  My husband was skeptical but liked it, and my 11mo daughter loved the flavor.  I was looking for something like we had at an Italian restaurant recently and this was perfect!

I followed this recipe exactly as written (I think the only changes were that I pounded the chicken and served it over buttered linguini) and absolutely loved it!  It came out better than when I order chicken piccata in a restaurant.  My family and I really enjoyed the lemony flavor and didn't find it overpowering at all.  Will always use this recipe when I want chicken piccata!

I doubled the ingredients for the sauce because I love more sauce.  But I felt like there was too much lemon.  And next time I will not coat the chicken in flour, I will just pound it and pan sear it.  And also leave it in larger pieces like strips instead of medalions.  It was good, but needs some tweaking.

This recipe was great! My family loved them and the chicken turned out perfect despite the fact that i've never panfried chicken before. The recipe was easy and remotely fast to finish. My only changes were this- since I read that it was bitter I just put the zest of one lemon into the sauce instead of the whole lemon slices, I also pounded out the chicken breast so they would be a little thinner, cook faster, and be more tender. The only problem for me was that the sauce didn't quite thicken up on me even though i reduced it for a long time, so the sauce was on the thin side (yet VERY flavorful, SO GOOD). This is a MUST recipe and will definitely be made again!

This was awesome!  I doubled the recipe and eliminated the capers due to the kids not liking them.  The chicken was tender and the lemon sauce tasty.  This recipe is definetly a keeper!  Thanks!

This was very simple, and a beautiful presentation.  I had my douts whether the sliced lemons would be edible with the rinds on but after simmering them in the chicken stock they absolutely were.  I added extra fresh lemon juice and it really had a yummy tangy lemon taste.  I thought that there was not going to be enough sauce to evenly coat the pasts but the strength of the lemon and the butter were perfect.  We served this with grilled asparagus and linguini and we can't wait to do it again.  Very good!

Made this last night with cut up chicken tenders.  dredged some in flour.  Just added juice of 1/2 lemon to sauce.  I was concerned with the bitterness others said they believed was from the actual lemon slices.  Ended up forgetting the capers!  Served over thin spaghetti with a caprise salad.  Lovely meal.  Thanks.

Delicious, quick and easy! I had to throw this together fast and added half a sliced red oinion, sliced crimini mushrooms and instead of chicken broth I used dry vermouth. Served with French stringbeans and frozen "Just Spaghetti" from Trader Joe's. It was a hit with the DH!

6/10 used 3 breasts and it wasn't enough. use stainless steel frying pan.  followed recipe except i used ckn cube and i didn't like it, so i added some canned ckn broth mixed with wondra to thicken the sauce. tasty, we all loved it. good with couscous mixed with zuccini.  ally doesn't like couscous.
12/24/11:i used real lemons and it was sooo bitter. next time try  the juice of the lemon but don't put the slices in.. the white part is so bitter when it is cooked. but do try again.

Very good and relatively simple to make, although I think two tablespoons of capers is a bit much.  I like the flavor of capers, but I thought they overpowered all the other flavors in the sauce, including the lemon.  Next time I'll just use 1 tablespoon.

Really delicious, it took about an hour since we did 2 rounds of chicken ( 5 large chicken breasts) and pan cooked it rather than finishing it in the oven. Before serving we finished the chicken in the pan with the sauce and let it simmer for 10 minutes.

This was totally yum! Only change I made was used less chicken. Same amount of sauce. 1 large chicken breast for 3 of us. Served it over  angel hair pasta with Parmesan, a side of steamed broccoli. And a fruit salad. So good and everyone is satisfied and says it’s a keeper.

I was looking for a last minute dinner I could make with ingredients on hand.   I have 3 teenagers with very different pallets and they never like the same thing.   They all LOVED IT!  So much,  it prompted me to rate a recipe for the first time after being on this app for years.  I even used bottled lemon juice cuz it's all I had and it still was fantastic!!

I added some savory complexity to the bright, lemon flavor by adding 1/8 of a medium onion, diced.  Also, I made a roux towards the end with 4 T of pan liquid and 1 T of arrowroot in a ramekin, then transferred the roux back to the pan and stirred continuously until the liquid stopped thickening (about 2 min.).

This recipe's a keeper.

Absolutely fantastic; I changed nothing. This does take a bit of time to cook, so I recommend making it for your first time for a smaller number of people. Enjoy!

I made this with shrimp, not chicken and it was delicious!  Kept everything the same, but cooked the shrimp in oil and butter first then took the shrimp out of the pan and set aside while I did everything else per recipe.  I then put the cooked shrimp back in pan and tossed it the sauce.  I served it over soba noodles.  Definitely will do again.  Too marks.

WE LOVED THIS ONE!  I served it over angel hair pasta with a garden salad and garlic crescent rolls.  I would have preferred grilled asparagus as a side, but I didn't have any on hand.

Not difficult, just do the chopping and prep ahead.  Then assembly can happen swiftly and smoothly.  When I make this again, like others said, the addition of white wine will enrich and marry the flavors better.

I served in large covered dish, layering the vermicelli, then chicken pieces, and topped all with sauce in which I had finished steamed Brussels sprouts sliced in half.  Grated Parm to finish.

Attractive, tasty, and zippy!

On first bite, I thought this was a bit too lemony, but added approximately 3/4 c chicken broth in addition to what was called for as well as 1 T. Flour.  I served this with roasted broccoli to reduce carbs and drizzled sauce over it as well. It was delicious and will definitely be making again.

This recipe was a huge hit with my family.  I am going to be making my own pasta to give it that extra kick.   You may want to lightly increase the sauce quantities (more butter, chicken stock and lemon) if you like it heavier on the sauce.  Also, irish butter gives it a little extra flavor.

I’m not sure if I did something wrong, maybe I overcooked it or something, but the lemon slices in the sauce made it taste so bitter. The flavors were good, but this very unpleasant acid hits the back of your throat as an after taste. I tried to fix it with sweet wine, sugar, and baking soda, but the more I messed with it the worse it got. Ended up tossing it and just covering my chicken with a red sauce.

Very tasty. I really enjoyed the citrus flavor along with the capers. I didn't have any parsley so I used basil from our herb garden.

Giving this recipe a 4 bc it is soo close and an easy adjustment to perfect it to my taste. IMO the lemon flavor was way too strong. Next time I will cut the lemon and lemon juice in half. I also added a little flour to the sauce at the end bc mine did not thicken much. Otherwise, it was so delicious and instructions were well-written for my first attempt at chicken piccata.

Did not make any changes. This was delicious! My husband who doesn’t like chicken asked for seconds. It is flavorful, the chicken was tender, and we really enjoyed it.

Very good!  I really like the tangy taste of the sauce, the capers balanced it out.  I prepped everything ahead of time so it saved time making it & it took no time at all.  Would definitely make again.  I served on some nice buttery mashed potatoes.  Yum!

This recipe was originally posted by BellesAZ and I got it here in 2011.  While it is definitely a 5-star recipe, I find it a little disconcerting that credit wasn’t given to BellesAZ.  Recipe is the same, word for word .  Nevertheless, it is an absolutely delicious dish! Thanks for reviving it.

this is delicious! I doubled the recipe because I like to serve with angel hair pasta and like the cause over the pasta.  the only change is I added a pinch of cyan Pepper to my seasoning on the chicken it gives it a little kick...everyone raved about it!

This was awesome! First off I would like to say that I usually steer clear of anything with citrus flavor in food because I just don’t really like it. BUT. I gave this a shot and it was amazing !! I would definitely recommend this . It was also pretty easy to make once you have all the ingredients chopped and lined up. The reason I’m giving this a 4-star review is because it doesn’t specify how long you keep the chicken in the oven for. I just eyeballed it and made sure the chicken was actually cooked all the way through.

This was good! I’d never had this dish before and I was pleasantly surprised. It doesn’t have very many ingredients, so I would say it’s simplicity at its best. Mine was not bitter, and I made this per the instructions. My lemon was also about a week old(stored in refrig.), so I’m just glad I didn’t have a bitterness problem like others did. My only changes were using 1-1.5 T of capers and dried parsley. I will make this again, and I may up the chic. broth slightly and keep all other measurements close to the same just for personal preference.

Delicious recipe.  I made some minor changes based on other reviews.   I cut the chicken breasts in about 2"x 3" pieces .  Added a bit more garlic,  used lemon zest instead of the lemon slices, used chicken broth (1   13 oz can)  and 1 cup of white wine and no capers (I don't like them).  It's a keeper, thanks!

I have had chicken piccata before, but never tried to make it because it seemed so complicated. This was my first try.  The video helped a lot.  It turned out so good.  My family  loved it.  I made 2 changes.  I doubled the broth, and used  less than 1/4 cup lemon juice.  It turned out well. 
Thank you for a great recipe.

Yes, I will make it again. It was a hit! I am always generous with lemon, capers, and wine! So we had plenty of sauce.

I used chicken stock along with the vermouth mixture to make sauce to pour over chicken.  I made day ahead of time and cooked minimally, then poured sauce over chicken and heated for 30 mins the next day.  Everyone raved over it and wanted to bring the leftovers home, it was a HIT!!

This was amazing!!  My husband said it was one of the best meals I have ever made!  Kids loved it too.  I followed the all instructions, but made it gluten-free.  Just substituted almond flour for wheat flour.  
Definitely making this again!

This was way too lemony.  I would just put in 1 - 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, rather than the 1/4 cup.  You will surely pucker up with all the lemon juice in this dish!

Delish!  I pounded the breasts to about 1/4' thick and they were wonderful.  Also made again and used a white wine instead of chicken broth....scrumptious!!!

I think this recipe is going to take some practice for me.  I've made it once before and I recall the sauce was very runny and bitter.  

I sliced my chicken breast into medallions, breaded with flour, salt and pepper, and fried as directed. This time I did as another reviewer suggested and used the peel instead of sliced lemon.  I forgot to add the peel in the beginning so I added it with the lemon juice and capers. After adding the butter I let the sauce simmer for another minute or two.

Turned out great.   I took advise of others and added white wine also.  It helped with the bitter taste from lemons.   I added the lemons early.   Then removed them near the end.

Delicious, but I changed it a bit to make it my own. After heating about 1/4 c. of olive oil, I added 2 tb of butter. I then dredged the breasts in  in 1 egg and then 1/2 c. of flour and 1/2 c. of Parmesan cheese. Let brown for about 3 minutes on each side. For the sauce, I left the recipe as is, but added about 3 tbl of butter with the garlic and chicken broth. (By mistake I used beef and chicken broth and it was really good!) I also added about 2 tbl of white wine  and 1.5 tbl of lemon juice. I kept trying the lemon juice until I thought it was lemony enough, but not too lemony.  I did not include the lemon slices. Covered and cooked on medium for about 15 minutes. Soooooo good!

From the first taste, my husband told me this is something I should make frequently.   The chicken was so tender, and the zesty lemon gave this dish a wonderful flavour.    Capers can have a strong taste, so I might reduce the amount I used, or I can just give hubby more of mine!  
SUPER easy to make!

This was similar to Olive Garden's piccata, i.e., delicious! It is now a part of our regular meal circulation.

Family loved this version of Chicken Piccata. I'd never simmered lemon slices into the sauce before, but now I won't go back to my old way. This was delicious. My only changes were to sub some white wine in for some of the stock, and leave out the capers (didn't have any). To save time, I used chicken breasts pre-cut for stir-fry from the grocery. Served with yellow saffron rice and a green salad.  Thanks for the ideas!

This was delightful. I made this twice now, both times I completely forgot to add the parsley at the end. Both times I doubled the sauce because I served it over linguini, and even then, I probably could have tripled+ it, because it’s so delicious, and the pasta just soaks it up. I was a bit worried about serving potentially bitter tasting sauce, so I added the lemon slices at the end, and a few extra on the plates as garnish. We had the missionaries over for dinner and one of the sweet elders had huge second helpings, and asked me to spell out “piccata” so he could reference it in his email home! If that isn’t a compliment to the chef, I don’t know what is. The first time I made this, I added a touch of cornstarch to thicken it. I omitted it the second time, and it was a tad runny, so I do recommend dissolving a teaspoon of cornstarch in cold water and then slowly adding that to the hot reduction before adding the butter

I used chicken thighs which I cooked in a skillet,  skin side down until crispy.  Then turned them over & put the skillet in the oven to hold them until everyone was home.  Then I put the thighs on a plate in the warm oven and made the sauce in the pan.  Worked great!  I didn't use wheat flour so I thickened the sauce with tapioca flour.

I made this as the recipe stated and it was DELICIOUS!!! I swear it’s like you’re eating chicken piccata from a restaurant. I was so surprised at how easy this was to make and how good it was. I personally like more lemon in my chicken, so I added more lemon juice. I also upped the oven temp to 300 degrees because it’s weird to me to have chicken finish cooking at a low temperature, but that’s just me. Definitely a keeper recipe!!

We loved this recipe. I served this with noodles. Because we like a lot of sauce, I double the amount of broth. I made a slurry of flour and water to thicken it up a little. A lot of reviewers noted that it was too lemony, so I made an adjustment. I only used half of the lemon juice called for, and removed the lemon slices as soon as the sauce was done, so it wouldn't get too bitter.  When the sauce was done, I returned the chicken to the pan and simmered on low for 5 or 6 minutes to heat the chicken back up. I will definitely be making this again.

I made it, and it was great.  I substituted Champagne for the chicken broth because I had it.  I think white wine, apple juice, champagne or chicken broth would be equally good.

Good recipe and although I peel away the white and yellow skin of the lemon and used only the meat of the lemon, it was still overpoweringly acidic.  So I added 1/3 cup of heavy cream.  That did the trick.   I served it with white rice and peas.  (Oh, and I did use 1/4c white wine along with the broth).
Not the best I ever made but still very good.

Bigger pieces of breast didn't cook well.  Should be sliced horizontally.
Made with roasted potatoes was really good with the sauce.

Nice, easy, fancy dinner. I tasted the sauce at the end and decided it needed to be toned down a bit (rather tart), so I stirred in a healthy tablespoon of sour cream. Served with black rice with carrots and mushrooms, and coleslaw that my daughter made with avocado dressing, yum!

Made it for a Christmas party, turned out amazingly. Everyone raved about it, have eaten the leftovers for a couple days, still good. After the chicken was baked all the way I moved them to a crockpot for easy serving for guests while still keeping them warm, served with jasmine rice that I threw a little lemon juice and butter in. Perfect combination.

I doubled the recipe because I was going to put it over pasta and needed more sauce. Don't double the lemon juice it made it way too sour.

I liked this very much. However it was  a bit too lemony for me. Next time I won't add the lemon slices, just the lemon juice to the sauce.

I made this  recipe exactly as is except I simmered the chicken in the sauce after it thickened up, and added a can of artichoke hearts. Very flavorful! I served it with lemon rice pilaf. Restaurant quality meal!

This was delicious! Served it over spaghetti squash, I used cornstarch instead of flour and subbed 1/2 cup of white wine for part of the chicken broth. Very lemony! Even my 17-month old daughter liked it. Definitely a keeper recipe.

Was surprised that after all the positive reviews, this wasn't a success for me. I don't know what I did wrong, but the sauce was tart and bitter, even though I took the pith off the lemon and even added some sugar as others suggested. I love chicken piccata, but this isn't the traditional dish. Maybe that's the problem for those of us who didn't have good results.

This ended up being very tasty and I plan to make it again.  Next time, I will brown my chicken pieces all at once rather than in batches. What happened when I browned in batches was bits of flour coating ended up blackening. I wiped out most of the blackened bits before proceeding to make the sauce. There remained a bit of a burned taste in the sauce. If anyone has feedback on how not to burn the flour bits, I would welcome learning abou ti. For the most part it was a very tasty dish. A bonus:  I put the leftover chicken pieces and sauce on salad greens with1/2 avocado for a very tasty salad for my lunch the next day.

Wonderful.  Two small changes.  Used whole chicken breasts and pounded them out thin.  Put a little panko in the flour to coat.  Did the sauce as called for and had no bitterness.  The lemony - caper flavor was amazing.  Served over angel hair pasta.  Will be making this again and again!

This is an excellent recipe just as written. For all the folks who had complaints about the sauce being bitter,  fussing with the lemon slices, adding sugar and the rest,  you might want to be absolutely sure you rinse off and drain the capers.

Like most of the reviews, we found the taste to have too much of a bitter lemon taste, however I will try some of the suggestions using wine, sugar and rind and add the lemon slices as garnish.  This is a beautiful dish, so I am excited to perfect it and serve it to our guests.

Delicious. I fried the chicken the day before to save some time, and just refried before serving to make it crispy.  I used green olives instead of capers, and added a bit of cornstarch and flour to thicken the sauce. Its a bit too acidic for me, but my boyfriend loved it. I think the key is a good sauce to fried chicken ratio - use enough chicken so that the sauce is just enough to coat it, and you wont be overwhelmed with too much lemon sauce. I served it with rice, it was good, next time i'll try it with pasta

We made and really liked it. After reading reviews the only change we made was to use a combination  of Meyer Lemons and regular lemons. For the Lemon Slices we used Meyer and for the 1/4 cup of lemon juice we used both types of lemons and it came out AWESOME!! Thank you for the great recipe.

WAY too much lemon. It overpowered the recipe. I added a bit of heat and a bit more garlic but would cut back quite a bit on the lemon if I make it again. It has potential with less lemon.

I took other reviewer suggestions and used Italian style bread crumbs instead of flour, replaced 1/2 of the chicken broth with white wine, and used lemon zest in place of the lemon slices which still gave a lot of lemon flavor without any bitterness. Great recipe.

Huge hit...all of us were delighted with this recipe.  I made a few tiny tweaks to quantities as follows: Reduced lemon juice by 1 tablespoon and added water to compensate. (Otherwise the dish ends up a bit overpowered by the juice.). I used the 8 ounces of chicken broth but I think next time I will use an entire 12 ounce can of broth and just let it simmer a bit longer to get the consistency needed. And, of course, who can live with just a single clove of garlic?!  Certainly not me!  (I always toss in several more large cloves into any dish that calls for less than a few cloves.). I also pounded my chicken breasts slightly so that they were all the same thickness - about 3/4-inch - and left the pieces (before cooking) about 2 1/2 inches by 4-inches.  I served oven roasted vegetables as an accompaniment to this dish (parsnips, potatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts tossed with a good quality olive oil, sea salt and fresh cracked pepper; roasted until just tender).  Thanks for such a YUMMY recipe!

This was my first time attempting a chicken piccata, & this recipe came out great!  Followed the recipe closely with the following changes:  much less lemon juice- used 2 Tbsps (which was perfect for us), & followed other tips to first pound chicken & drop the capers in at the beginning of the sauce & crush them a bit.  For future attempts, I’ll make double the sauce- yum!

I have made this a few times for the BF and family. Always delicious! I use chicken tenders because they just look prettier and they tend to be juicer than breasts.  I use olive oil and more garlic and capers because preference. Lemon to taste...gotta watch it when using lemon slices, I try and get the organic ones and have better luck with the bitterness. 
Thank you for sharing!!

Five stars when omitting the added lemon juice and using a high quality white wine in lieu of chicken stock. Use a garlic and herb angel hair pasta to perfectly compliment the chicken.

Loved it exactly as written. Yes it has a very sharp tang from the lemons but I love that flavor. Super thin slices of lemon practically melt away while cooking. Capers add to that sharpness so if you don't want too much pop you could skip them.  I have made this several times and whole family enjoys it. Only issue is I need to start doubling up on ingredients to make more sauce because it is delicious over rice or pasta.

Yes, i added 2 big cloves of garlic and am glad i did so. When it says 4 chicken breasts, cut into medalions, i only used 2 and thank God as the amount of sauce barely was enough for 2. I like the sauce to cover each and every bite plus to put someon the pasta. Nowhere near enough to do the pasta. I have become  very picky in my old age, i felt i was wasting hard earned money on eating out, only to be disappointed, ALWAYS. I cannot believe at 63 i actually CAN COOK. This came out just how i like it, taste wise. Very pleased with this recipe. Just triple ingredients if you want more sauce.

Excellent.  Very flavorful.  Love the lemon.  Instead of using flour to  coat I used eggs & breadcrumbs.  The sauce never  thickened, no matter how long I simmered it.  I followed the sauce recipe  exactly.  I wonder if it's because I didn't use flour?

Loved the lemon taste, probably used too big of a lemon, but it was wonderful!  I probably would have used more peppercorns and doubled the sauce if putting over pasta.

I really loved this recipe as is. My only fear was that it could be a bit too acidic, so I used 4 thin slices of the lemon. If it can be counted as a "modification", I added 2 tsp. of white wine and let it evaporate while scraping bits off the pan. Then, I followed the rest of the steps. I served it with spaghetti and it was perfect. Tips: Do not rinse the pasta and instead add about 1 tbsp of the pasta water to the sauce. This will make it easier for the sauce to stick to the pasta. I cut my medallions the size the recipe called for, then I flattened them a bit with a kitchen hammer. It yielded a chicken breast that was juicy and tender! Will definitely make this again!

This is the exact recipe from Cooks magazine from 10 years ago except for 2 things.  Shallots instead of garlic and buy chicken cutlets.  I changed to bone-in broth instead and it made a big difference.  I serve it with linguini.  It’s my signature dish

This was Great, made for Sunday Family dinner (10-14) super easy for a large crowd, and everyone loved it! To keep the bitterness under control, use smaller lemons they have less pith on the rind. Served linguini with burnt butter and parmesan cheese, salad, and a nice hard bread to soak up the sauce over the chicken. Happy, happy family after that!

My family’s really enjoyed this chicken.  I accidentally got pepper corns instead of capers and it was just as amazing. My husband liked it better if you want to try this as a lemon pepper chicken try this with the peppercorn.

Really delicious. I followed others' suggestions and didn't add the lemon slices to the simmering sauce. Got no bitterness this way.

This was excellent.  I served it over angel-hair pasta and everyone loved it.  My only change was using extra garlic because we love garlic.  Next time I will double the sauce ingredients.  Maybe my chicken pieces were too big - they took longer than 3 minutes on each side to cook.  I had to cook the chicken in 2 batches to not crowd the pan, so the recipe took a lot longer than I had in mind.  I will definitely make it again, but it's not in my quick dinner list.  The taste is wonderful if you are a lemon lover.  I used Meyer lemons and the cooked slices were little pieces of heaven.

Easy to make and overall good recipe. Not enough sauce and lemon overload. Think next time I will increase sauce by adding more chicken broth or white wine with additional butter but same amount of lemon.

This was fantastic! I made a few changes based on reviews and personal taste. Pound chicken thin and sprinkle with garlic powder, S & P. Instead of lemon slices use zest of two lemons and juice. 3/4 cup chicken broth 1/4 cup white wine. 1 tablespoons of corn starch to thicken. No capers. My husband was skeptical when I told him I was making this, his mind was changed after he ate this great dish.

I made this as written except I did not use any capers (I don't like them). Otherwise, it's a quick and easy recipe and the chicken was perfectly done. The second time I did not have parsley so I added a bunch of fresh spinach to the sauce at the end, cooked quickly until the spinach just wilted and it came out fantastic. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is so good! Way better then shaking on lemon pepper. I didn't put lemon slices in but used the juice of a whole lemon. I also used only one chicken breast that way the chicken was moist with lots of sauce!

Such a quick and tasty meal (and I'm very hard to please)! This is one of the very rare chicken breast recipes that I'd actually make again. I made the following adjustments

-only used two chicken breast halves (but same amount of sauce)
-subbed veggie stock for white wine (since I don't consume alcohol). Knorr brand boullion cubes are the best!
-added one medium clove of garlic
-added one small bay leaf to the sauce
-added a pinch of flour to the sauce to thicken

In the future, I'll cut the breast into strips so that it cooks more quickly and you can taste more seasoning on each piece. I'd also double the amount of sauce since it's so flavorful.

We loved the light flour coated chicken and also the surprising lightly lemon/caper seasoned sauce.  Has become one of our regular chicken recipes.

Delicious! I skipped the capers, and removed the lemon slices before serving. They were too bitter for my taste. I served it over roasted spaghetti squash with garlic and olive oil. Great with a chilled glass of moscato!

This was very good.  I made it before and used the capers which everyone pushed aside with their forks so... I eliminated them this time and it still came out fine. I will make it again for sure. I made garlic parmesan red potatoes for a side.

This has become the household favorite. The only thing I do differently is not add the butter to the sauce let it thicken a little longer over a low heat. love it!

I used roasted garlic at the outset, this gave the sauce a little extra sweetness flavour. Of course, everything had to be scaled down for one breast of chicken.

Easy to make, and maybe it was the lemon I had, but it was very tart.  To cut the lemon taste, I added more butter, and that did help a little.  Next time, I’ll put less lemon juice in, and still double the butter!!!!

I used chicken cutlets. The flavor was perfect and the chicken remained very moist.

I have made many recipes from this site and this is the first one I had to throw away. I am not a natural cook, so I followed the recipe to a T. It was so bitter I almost threw up. I wasted a lot of money and time on this one. THEN I read the reviews. Lemon rind was the culprit. How was I to know? I tried doctoring the recipe and made a huge mess. Do yourself a favor and READ the reviews so you do not make the same mistake I did. I will NOT make this again.

Super  easy.
I felt very proud.
To me it was restaurant quality  in my own home.

Only down side is browning the chicken in oil made the house stink and set off the CO2/VOC (volatile organic compound) sensor into  warning zone.

So yes, the grease stinks but SUPER tasty and easy.

I think I only have rated something 5 stars one other time. This was amazing.  Yes it was a bit bitter even though I added the lemon rind pieces separate from the juice. I tried not to include the much of the white part of the lemon.  I added 2 TBS of honey along with some brown sugar.  It was the sweetness that my family loves. But then I realized that I forgot the butter. That would have helped a lot with the tartness.  But I'm happy I made a lower fat version.  I was very careful to not overcook the chicken which is so easy to do. It was fabulous.

The family loved this one! I would serve it over angel hair pasta or egg noodles next time. I also added some white wine which gave some great flavor to the sauce.

This was just terrible.  Very sour and bitter.  My daughter made this exactly as written, and it is a shame, because the chicken by itself was very good, but after the sauce went on, it was inedible.  I don't know how this got such good reviews, but if you make it, taste it before adding the lemon slices or lemon juice.  Then, add sparingly...trust me.  Restaurant worthy?  I would have sent it back.

The flavor is fantastic!  it is true, restaurant-quality!  The only thing about this recipe is,  the kind of heat required to pan-fry the chicken is not provided.  I did mine on med-high, and i think it made my medallions a little dry....but the taste is wonderful.  Next time I make this, maybe I will use medium heat and see if that makes a difference.  I did not modify the recipe in any way and it tastes so good as is.  Thank you to whoever shared this one!!

I didn't not make any changes, but I was curious about making this ahead of time, not wanting to take any chances on my dinner party, I followed the recipe and served right away.   It was great as left overs!  I stored the left overs in the same container (sauce over the chicken) and forgives from this that making it ahead of time would not be a problem..  I made it again and went ahead and poured the sauce over the chicken and set it aside to be reheated and served later.  I think I like it better this way, gives the sauce time to soak into the breading on the chicken. Very lemony, just the way I like it. Everyone enjoyed it.

This was my first time making anything like this, and I was extremely pleased when about halfway through simmering the sauce, that it suddenly began smelling sweet. I think next time I would make more sauce, but that is all I'd do different. ( I used two rabbit backs this time, good enough recipe to warrent three)

The only added ingredient was about a half a cup of white wine which I added with the chicken stock.  I let this cook down to a very dense sauce which was well received by my better half.  He said this recipe is a definite keeper.

Delicious! Definitely 5 star recipe! Read some of the other reviews and took the advice of using the lemon zest instead of lemon slices. Make sure you simmer it well.  Perfect!

Very easy and very flavorful, however you do need to add sugar to counteract  simmering the lemon slices in the sauce. I started with a teaspoon and ended up with about two tablespoons. Keep tasting sauce before topping off chicken pieces. will make again!

This was an excellent recipe that I recommend to everyone I know. It's fairly simple to make, although I suggest tasting the sauce along the way, as I had to improvise with proportions a bit. I would also suggest making more sauce than directed, as I had to go back and double it for one "batch" of chicken. This recipe is a total crowd pleaser, but again- I would highly recommend that anyone making it should mess around with the sauce as you go. A couple examples may be that you add in more butter, or even put a dash of milk. Overall a great recipe that I will definitely make again!

6.17.17  I cooked the chicken until it was done (165ºF) because I wanted a nice brown color on it and then put it n the 200ºF oven.  While I finished the sauce, the chicken then overcooked (I should have known better, my bad!).  In the future, I won’t cook it completely through because it can finish cooking in the low-temp oven.  In spite of that, this was very, very good, and the sauce is awesome, although I'll cut back a bit on the lemon juice in the future because it was just a tad on tart side for us..

Do yourself a favor and make this recipe exactly as written.. made it tonight and it was DELICIOUS. quick and easy with minimal mess. I added some pasta tossed with the the sauce... so good. next time I might adjust some seasoning slightly/decrease butter.. maybe.
 I did not have any issue with bitterness as other reviewers mentioned when made exactly as written. perfect fast delicious meal for weeknights and nice enough for company.. thank you.

This was very good.  I used more butter and garlic, but it was extremely tasty, a perfect dinner for guests. Served with rosemary roasted baby red potatoes and a Cesar salad. Will use this as a company go to recipe!  Thanks for posting it.

Really enjoyed this. I didn't add the additional half cup of lemon juice as I felt that would have made it too bitter. I added more chicken broth to make it less sour. Served it with a rice pilaf and some snow peas. Yummy!

This was awesome. The only changes I made was to add a bit of heavy cream to the chicken stock and reduced the amount of butter from 3 Tbsp. to 2Tbsp. I also think I could omit dredging the chicken in flour as well..

I made it along with some thin pasta, tasted great! However, I would recommend using a larger amount of chicken broth to begin with, and add more of other ingredients in order to make sure you have enough sauce for the pasta as well!

The chicken was good, but I did change the sauce up a bit based on other reviews.  I doubled the ingredients, and only kept the lemon slices in for seven minutes.  I also had to add some sugar, as it was still too tart.  I used additional flour and some heavy cream to thicken it up.

Delicious. But can come out bitter as ours did. So you might have to add some sugar (I did 2 sprinkles of sugar - no idea how much that is!) to make the sauce less bitter. Also I used coconut flour which I'm using more of these days. Everyone loved it. Definitely will make it again.

I didn't make any changes. The sauce came out a little bitter with an unpleasant aftertaste. The lemon I used was pretty big (I doubled the recipe). When I make it again, I am going to cut back on the lemon slices and maybe use part white wine, part  chicken broth. I think it has 5 star potential.

It was alright, would be good with pasta for sure. Need more sauce for pasta though! It was fine using the lemon slices simmering in the sauce. Didn't need to add any lemon juice to the sauce, was already lemony enough.

I would absolutely make this again. Everyone loved this recipe.  We made this gluten free buy using half gf flour and half flax meal instead of ap flour, I added the salt and pepper to the dredging flour.  I also upped the garlic, a lot! I also added a healthy dash of dry sherry as well.
I am not sure if I reduced it too much but we like more sauce so next time I make it I will probably double the ingredients for the sauce.

I made this dish exactly as written.  I don't know if I let let the sauce cook down more than it should have, but my main complaint is that there was not enough sauce. My other complaint is, any time I have to fry "in batches", it's a pain. I'm carful to not have the heat too high because I don't want burnt bits in the end so it took about 5 min on each side and I had 4 batches. So, what I thought was going to take 12-15 min was actually a 40-45 min. task. It was good and I will make it again but will probably use 2 chicken breasts instead of 3 and I will double or triple the sauce. I served it with rice pilaf and my husband who is really not a fan of lemon, said he really liked it and would have it again.

Followed the recipe but had four changes: 

1.  I didn't slice my lemons to put in the sauce. Felt like too much work so I just squeezed juice from half a lemon in. 

2. Sauce doesn't ever really thicken so I put a little cornstarch. 

3. I didn't use garlic because I ran out. 

4. I used half wine and half chicken stock per the reviews. I also doubled the sauce because as it started to reduce it didn't look like there was much. 

Final verdict: no one really cared for it. Maybe we aren't lemon piccata people. Won't be making again.

Great recipe although next time I'm leaving the lemon slices out and maybe just use a pinch of lemon zest and will cut way down on the lemon juice. Thought maybe would try a 1/4 cup of sweet and sour mix instead. Found the recipe a little to much lemon flavor for my liking.

Excelente and easy recipe, everyone at my dinner party praised it.  Only difference is I marinated the chicken with a little of the lemon juice for 30 minutes and just didn´t add the lemon slices to avoid the bitternes.

Exactly what I was hoping for. I didn't have any bitterness as others mentioned (I used fresh lemons, and removed the lemon slices  after about 7 minutes/once I added in the lemon juice and capers so perhaps that was why.  

I served over angel hair pasta mixed with a little butter and parmesan.  Loved it and boyfriend approved!

Decided to make something in a rush, went with this recipe and it wasn't difficult at all. I made it without the capers because I didn't have any at home. Added some lemon zest from the lemons I juiced to the mix. It was beyond delicious!!!!! Definitely will be making for a holiday get together.

The only things I did differently was add 1 cup wine instead of chicken broth and sprinkled dry parsley flakes instead of fresh (because I didn't want to spend the money on fresh when I already had dried. I often use dried instead of fresh because I find it adds more flavour).  I served it over rice and all agreed it was delicious.

Turned out pretty good. Deboned some thighs instead of using the b/s breasts. Need to tweak it a bit to balance out the sour from the lemon, but anything that the kids ask for seconds is a good recipe in my book.

Here's a delightful twist;  I topped this with Preserved Tunisian Lemon Slices from Trader Joe's. You haven't tried them, have you? They are lemon slices you can eat whole, peel and all! Best part is, they're not sour!  You really oughta give them a try. They will be your new go-to preserved fruit.

Great tasting! I used a pealed lemon for  slices and added little bit of sherry. I mixed the chicken pieces after it was cooked with the sauce and cooked a few minutes longer. Put this over steamed broccoli and thin egg noodles. Will make again!

I loved the sauce from this!  The only change I made was to add a handful of freshly grated Parmesan cheese to the dredging flour.   Served this over angel hair pasta with steamed broccoli on the side. 
I'd like to try it with shrimp instead of chicken. Also, adding sautéed mushrooms would be yummy!  I think I'll double the sauce next time as well.

I've made this 5 times it's incredible. Just be careful not to over do the lemon. If you add the lemon rind do it right in the beginning and then remove it after a minute.

I wish i could give this a 3.5 because the chicken came out great and most of the sauce did, too. My only problem was that my sauce came out bitter. I tried to tone it down by adding sugar and some more butter to the sauce. It helped a little, but didn't totally counteract it. Cooking lemon peel or rind can bring out bitterness, so I think I'll skip simmering the lemon slices next time and just go with adding the lemon juice for the lemon flavor. Pretty sure that was the culprit.

I love Chicken Piccata but this recipe was not a home run.  The sauce simply was not enough in quantity to bring it flavor. I will keep the recipe, but double amounts for sauce next time.

Wonderful.  I also use thin pork medallions cut from pork loin in place of the chicken. I also liked the suggestion to use Italian bread crumbs.  One of our favorites at my house.

Soooo very very delicious. I made it without the apple juice, didn't have any. I just think that 5 minutes to cook the breast was too long. Other than that I can't wait to make it again next week.

Sauce was too lemony.  I'm going to try again, but leave out the 1/4 cup of lemon juice.  The lemon slices should be more than plenty to flavor it.

Made this lemon chicken piccata last night with a lemon rice pilaf and it was a huge hit with my family.  It is a little time consuming to fry all the small pieces of chicken, but soooo yummy!  I served with broccoli.  Hubby and college-aged son loved it.

I used thin chicken cutlets and since I didn't have fresh lemon, I used pure lemon juice which worked perfectly. Next time would use a little less butter. Overall, it's delicious!

I made this for supper tonight. It was fabulous. I didn't add/use the sliced lemon portions tho', since I find the peel/zest too intense for my taste.  I used the juice of 1 large lemon, which was slightly more than the 1/4 cup, the recipe called for.

I used wheat free flour and vegan margarine and it was still delicious.  My husband loved it who is not wheat and dairy free.

My family loves this. Even my ultra-picky daughter likes it. I leave out the flour and just brown the chicken. But otherwise, I follow the recipe exactly as written. Delicious!

Great recipe! Husband and I both loved it!

I dipped the chicken in egg mixture to make the batter a little more even and thicker. I doubled the sauce and made angel hair pasta to go with it. It stayed tasty for days after I made it! Note that if you do mix the sauce in with pasta, remove the lemon slices beforehand...it should seem obvious but I forgot to and got some nice lemon peel in the mouth haha.

I followed the recipe exactly as it stated. Great dish!! A little too lemony for us, so next time I'll remove the slices after a few minutes (I did 6) and add more chicken broth. Maybe a little wine as well. I'm not a fan of capers, but honestly, I couldn't tell I was eating them with all the flavors blended perfectly! Highly recommend this dish!!!

I didn't include the lemon rinds while cooking suace, the second time I cooked this and it came out great. Lemon rinds left a bitter after taste. I doubled the sauce ingredients to get more sauce. I used chicken tenders instead of chicken breast.

Delicious!! I doubled the sauce & added some white wine.  I put some linguine on the plates, spooned some sauce on the linguine and arranged the crisp chicken toward the side.  It was very satisfying and so darn easy after a long work day.  Thanks!

I always try to make a recipe as written the first time. If I like it enough to make again,I may make  minor adjustments to it.This was very good!I think that the only thing I would tweak would be to add a little more of capers because I love them so much.

This is my husband's absolute favorite chicken dish. I have made it exactly as is and it's great, now I replace 1/8-1/4 cup of the lliquid with a good white wine and it's even better. And then we have a bottle open to drink with dinner! Only other tweak is to add more capers as my family loves them.

I have tried several recipes of Lemon Chicken Piccata and this one is hands down the winner and the keeper.  I did not make any adjustments to the recipe, and in my opinion the buttery and lemony flavors were perfectly balance!

I will make this again and again.

It was extremely bitter, to the point that I took all of it out but two tablespoons and added another cup of broth, simmered it down, and even that was too bitter. I ended up making a quick chicken gravy and putting it over the chicken, but since they were only seasoned with salt and pepper under the flour, they were terribly bland. Next time, I will do as other reviews suggested, and only use the lemon zest.

The chicken turned out fabulous but the sauce was bitter and just wasn't what I expected. Next time I'll definitely tweak the sauce recipe; will probably add some white wine and I might even leave out the lemon slices.

My biggest complaint is that this recipe is taken from America's Test Kitchen. The sauce is identical. The only difference is cutting medallions instead of cutlets. 

I have had lemon piccata in a fine dining restaurant and this recipe just doesn't compare.  It is too bitter and tart.  I had to alter and adjust it.

This recipe was super easy to make.  I also added some white wine to the sauce (same time I added the broth; added about 1/2 cup).  I served it with a rice orzo pilaf, and it paired really well.  I will definitely make this again.  My kids also liked, it.

My family doesn't really like chicken piccata which is one of my favorites.  They say it is lemon overload. But they love this recipe. I cutlet the chicken slicing the breasts in half horizontally. Followed the recipe exactly after that.  I think the reduction of lemon juice from my old piccata recipe from 1/3 cup to half of a lemon  in this recipe and drizzling the sauce over the chicken instead of putting the chicken back into the sauce to simmer is what made the difference to them. Very nice and my family loves it.

Yummy but I had to add more salt and pepper, was little bland for me. Also Iemons can turn it bitter, be careful before adding half a lemon.

This is so yummy!  If you don't have fresh lemons, it's still good with bottled lemon juice, but increase it by 1/2 to keep the intensity of the lemon flavor. However, NEVER cook lemon slices in the sauce - use 1 - 2 TBSP grated lemon rind.  The white part of the lemon skin turns the sauce very bitter.   Great company dish served with oven roasted potatoes and a fresh salad.

First time I made it, it turned out great.  Did not add the capers as I am not a fan of them.  Will make again.

tasted exactly as it should, nice and lemony and refreshing.  will try this recipe tonight with shrimp instead of chicken and will add broccoli to make it a one-pan dish.

Very  tasty and not complicated to make.  I used Meyer lemons which gave it a super flavour.  My husband  is not really keen on anything too tangy, and as the recipe is, I found the lemon a little overwhelming.  I added a tablespoon of honey before I poured the sauce over it.  I then kept it in the oven for 15 minutes to let the chicken absorb the flavours.  Magnifico!

Delicious! Husband is usually not a chicken fan and he said that this was his favorite thing he's ever eaten (other then tacos;)) !!!  I love everything about this and agree it goes well with rice pilaf.  Only warning is I've made it twice and with all the chicken we have to make to feed our fam of 6, it takes me two hours start to finish to make it. I think next time I will prep the day before and have everything ready to go.

you only need 1/4 cup flour. Also, I added 1/2 cup wine with the broth, which I think adds a pleasant bittersweetness to the recipe. I might look for other incarnations of this dish, however.

Pretty much made it  as it states in the recipe except for a little splash of Chardonnay to the final reduction.  Be sure to slice the lemons thinly and add early on so the sauce will reduce down with the lemons and it should be wonderful!

For the efforts in completing this recipe, I was very disappointed.  While the lemon was not bitter, the sauce did have an odd flavor to my palette. I won't make this again.

Great dish, easy to make.   Served it over Orzo pasta and put steamed green beans with it around the edges of the bowl.   Looked great and tasted better.  Jayne (the wife) loved it.  
Now I will serve it when we have guests.

A little too heavy on lemon for our taste, so I added more butter & some milk to cut down the lemon flavor a bit.

Made this with a chicken breast that was waay too thick. Made again, cutting breast into small chunks ... Much better. Used lemon zest instead of slices. Capers make the dish. Added fresh basil chiffonade to parsley before serving.  Easy fast, and good. Will make it again!

I added a little white wine.  The sauce was nice and tart.  I also used thinly sliced chicken breast whichever browned quickly in the oil and made the whole process quick.

This was a very nice and relatively easy recipe. I made it twice, once following the instructions, which turned out nice, but we didn't like the juice just poured over the chicken, so I made it again. I followed the recipe, but this time I returned the chicken to the gravy, added more broth, then simmered on low, covered, for approx. 20mins. This made the chicken very tender and juicy. I also took the advise from another review and started my sauce with semi-dry white wine, then when i simmered I added broth. Capers is a must for  this dish , the briny flavor really brings the dish together w the lemon. Cook the lemon in the wine sauce a the start. Served over brown rice and vegs.

Best chicken piccata, better than an Italian restaurant. I make this all the time and everyone I make this for loves it. You must give it a try. I like to cut the chicken into really small pieces and just sear them not cooking them all the way inside, then leave chicken in oven to keep warm at lowest temp (175) while making sauce. Then when sauce is ready before putting parsley add chicken back in and finish cooking it won't take long. Enjoy!

Way too much lemon.  I almost doubled the chicken broth and it was still by far too sour.  To fix the recipe I had to double the butter and add about 6 oz of heavy whipping cream.  It's also far easier to pound the chicken for tenderness. If you want to follow the recipe I would not add the lemon slices and start with a lot less then a 1/4 cup of lemon juice.  I've noticed lemon lovers over-do-it in these recipes.  It's important to taste the chicken or pasta.  This recipe is a good platform to start from.  However it required a lot of doctoring.   My family loved my version.

Very great flavors, both wonderful and easy to make. 

However, my only change would be to add a bit of white wine and a thin roux, and to play around to find a texture, consistency and flavor you like.  
I also wish I made the sauce first, I feel like the chicken was much too dry by the time the sauce was finished, and I feel as though the chicken should finish cooking in the sauce at the end. I'm definitely trying it that way next time.

Great taste, pretty straightforward.  Used 1 1/2 c chicken broth.  Pounded chicken and mixed in Italian breadcrumbs into flour.  Needed a little cornstarch to thicken in the extra lemon juice.  Super!

The first time I used orange slices and a good quality lemon juice.  It was yummy.  Second time I had lemons and it was yummy.  Will be making again and again.

This meal was fantastic, I had planned on making it exactly as the recipe said but I forgot to salt and pepper the chicken before I floured,  And I had to omit the bitter as I have a dairy allergy, oh and I did season the flour with salt pepper and garlic powder. But this dish was superb, I made it for mother's day dinner and everyone loved it there was nothing left!!!!! Thanks for this great recipe. And it was very easy to make! I also used the already minced organic garlic! I made it for 16! And I also have to add the chicken was so tender we could cut it with plastic forks??

I made it exactly as described, but with a splash of white wine added with the broth. I'm making it for the second time in 4 days, and my kids who complain mercilessly when I serve chicken, because it's bland (even with barbecue sauce!) actually asked for it.

This was wonderful.  After reading the other reviews about the bitterness I left out the lemon slices and it still had plenty of flavor,  I will definitely be making this again.

I used 2 pounds of chicken tenders instead of breast meat. Also doubled the sauce and added wondra to thicken the sauce more. It was a hit and it will be made again.

This recipe is fantastic. Easy to follow and it is delicious! After I read a few reviews I modified it to remove the lemon slices out of the sauce so it doesn't get bitter. It came out perfect and my family loved it. I will definitively make it again. Thanks for sharing! :)

This is delicious and I made no changes. The lemons really add such a great flavor and they were not bitter at all! Moist inside and just the right amount of crunchy on the outside! Made this with Lemon Thyme Rice also from this site and we couldn't get enough!!!

Great and fairly easy recipe.   I thought the recipe had a little bit too much lemon, so I would reduce it by one lemon next time.

This recipe was as tasty as I hoped it would be.  The recipe was clear and easy to follow.  There were no changes to the recipe at all, made exactly as given and we loved it and we WILL have it again soon.  This one is a definite winner and I recommend it highly.

It was so good.  I picked lemons from the backyard and that was the secret added bonus.  I would say that you should cook the chicken on a very heated skillet to comply with the instructions to cook on each side for 3 min.  It took a little longer for me to achieve the "golden brown" look and I think the chicken wasn't as tender as it could have been by cooking it a little longer.  Other than that, it was divine!!

Added my touches. Used flour and bread crumbs. The sauce was bitter! But not to worry,3 tbls spoon sugar, honey and soy sauce did the trick. Oh and I did not use capers

I made this for my husband's family who came over tonight.  I can honestly say I've never gotten so many compliments on a dinner before!  I loved it, too.  There was practically nothing left on the platter after dinner was over and my husband wants me to make this again very soon!

I made this with just a couple of changes that I had seen in one of the comments and it was a great hit.  I used white wine instead of chicken broth and used seasoned Italian bread crumbs instead of flour.  My husband said this is a definite do again.

Excellent and easy to make. I added extra minced garlic.   I also added a little white wine with the chicken broth and I removed the sliced lemons when this  done so that it wouldn't be to bitter.  Restaurant quality recipe!

Really yummy, but I did have to cook the sauce quite a bit longer than recommended for it to reduce. Also - if you use unsalted butter, it helps to add a pinch of salt with the butter. Served with brown rice and it was a really satisfying, filling meal.

I have made this several times and it is always great.  today we made it with mushrooms and linguini.  I cooked the mushrooms with extra garlic and combined them in with the cappers, which I chushed for more flavor.  After the sauce reduced some I added the chicken back in with the linguini and tossed it all together.  Once tossed for a minite or so I plated the it.  Tossed on some shreded parm and it was fantastic.

I thought it was delicious! I did double most of the recipe and reduced just shy of double for lemon juice. I enjoyed the moist chicken ( i baked in oven for 40 mins after browning, covered ) and  the lemon gave it a summer, refreshing take.  I will cook again and again.  Although i will dry a herb rub on the chicken next time to see hkw the lemon and garlic plays with it.

The sauce is AMAZING! I used white wine instead of broth. Next time I make it though I will eliminate the flour breading. I don't think it's needed because the sauce is so fabulous.

My family and I love this dish. I serve it over 1/3 to 1/2 a pound of angel hair pasta. Makes three generous servings if you're really hungry, otherwise makes four reasonable sized servings. There's nothing I would change, it's perfect.

The sauce was too bitter for my taste, very strong lemon flavor. I still ate it, and it was still good, but be prepared for that strong lemon flavor if you make this. My husband loved it and cleaned his plate of the sauce, and he loves strong lemon flavors, so it's good if that's the sort of flavor you enjoy! We made it with cheesy mashed potatoes (great side dish for this recipe) and asparagus.

I was a very good dish. my whole family loved it! My wife does not like capers so I make it with olives, but I really want to try it with capers next time because I love capers in a dish.

I've made this twice changing the recipe slightly each time, but results have been wonderful both times.  First time I switched out half the chicken broth with dry white wine and second time I added shallots and mushrooms which I thought added a bit of depth to the recipe.  Each time I got rave reviews from my guests.  This will be one of my favorite recipes going forward.  It's definitely a crowd pleaser.

I was looking for a recipe to use some of the lemons from our tree, and this did the trick! The chicken needed more seasoning, but the sauce was perfect. Next time I will add some spices to the flour when I coat the chicken.  There was no bitterness at all. I'm wondering if perhaps some people brown the garlic too long before adding the chicken broth. THat would certainly explain the problem.

Nice easy piccata recipe.  I did not find the sauce to acidic, but did find it a bit looser than I anticipated.  I did use a small lemon and had to top of fresh lemon juice with some bottled lemon juice.  I also plated my chicken and then drizzled the sauce over it. So the chicken was never sitting in all the piccata sauce,  Not sure if that made a difference but I did not find it too lemony or acidic.

Way too lemony for my taste and I didn't add the lemon slices. I might try it again with about a quarter of the lemon juice it calls for.

The chicken was good enough, but the sauce was WAY too much work to end up tasting so acidic; way too lemony...if you could burn from eating acidic food the way whiskey burns, this would be your dish! :(  It was edible, but no one in my house wants me to make it again.

I had high hopes, but for me it was too tart/lemony. I would try it again & not add lemon peels (or perhaps not leave in as long) or as much lemon juice. I also added more garlic than it called for. :)

If the sauce is a bit too sour from the lemon juice (I added too much by mistake) use some light coconut milk to even out the flavor. The coconut milk also creates a creamier sauce.

I have made this numerous times. Very good and tender. The only thing I did differently was eliminate the lemon juice. The lemon slices made it tart enough for my taste.

It was delicious! I added mushrooms as one of the other reviewers mentioned. Yum!  I can see where some people may think it's a bit bitter, but I love the lemony taste.

I cut the chicken breasts with kitchen scissors, dried the pieces, and dredged them in whole wheat flour premixed with salt and pepper. I also used half white wine and chicken broth for reduction.

I used a cast iron pan and kept the pieces in a 300 degree oven in a pirex container.

Turned out very tasty. Next time I'll double the sauce.

Made this with my wonderful husband tonight. We decided to do a meal together and so enjoyed the experience. Made the recipe as shown - we always do on a new one. Made it with sweet pea risotto, minus the scallops. They paired beautifully. Plus it is so much fun to cook with your significant other!! Love to you!

I doubled the recipe, added 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper  and made some cardamom and rosemary roasted potatoes to compliment the chicken. It was very tasty . My son gave me a big hug and asked to take some home.

Awesome! I made this just as written, with the exception of tripling the sauce. It is fantastic. I think because I tripled the sauce I couldn't get it to reduce properly but just made it easier to spread on the rice too

We both enjoyed.

This was delicious easy to prepare we truly enjoyed. Two picky eaters loved it ,  rated it their favorite. Will be preparing again. I left out the capers and it was still excellent. Pour sauce over chicken in oven left for 2 min then removed.

I  added  the  lemon  slices  to  the  sauce  and  it  made  the  sauce  bitter  so  I  took  them  out  immediately.   I  suggest  using  just  the  zest  if  you  want  that  extra  zip.   Second  the  sauce  was  overwhelmingly  lemony  to  the  point  where  that  was  all  I  could  taste.   Just  extremely  one  dimensional  and  lacking  in  complexity.   I  added  a  tiny  bit  of  sugar  to  counteract  the  bitterness   (which  only  partially  worked),  I  added  extra  chicken  stock  to  dilute  the  lemon  taste,  and  I  added  a  few  tablespoons  of  dry  sherry  for  complexity,  which  is  what  finally  saved  the  dish  and  elevated  it  to  true  restaurant  quality.   Next  time  I  will  add  more  garlic  too.   To  give  credit  where  it's  due,   the  texture  of  the  sauce  was  really thick  and   luscious, and  I  enjoyed  that  part  of  it  very  much.

The only change I made to this recipe is leaving the lemon slices in for only about four minutes while the sauce reduces and I left out the capers. Other than that, this is the PERFECT lemon chicken picatta recipe. My boyfriend rants and raves about how good it is every time I make it.

Followed the recipe exactly as written. It came out so bitter I could barely  eat it. If it wasn't for the extreme  bitterness It probably would have been good.

We loved it!  Did not add the sliced lemon just because I didn't have one.  Husband said it was better without because he finds other recipes I do with lemon slices too much.  Served over buttered noodles as that's what I had in the pantry with green beans.  Will definitely make this again.

I made this for the first time last week.   OMG, delicious!The only thing I would do differently next time is to cut back on the lemon slices. I would only add one slice, I found it to be a bit bitter. Other than that it was great and I will definately make it again!

I added some white wine to the broth.  Turned out intensely lemony, so would reduce the amount of lemon juice next time.

I made this with an accompaniment of Lobster Ravioli.  Below is the recipe for the Ravioli and sauce.  The only thing I would change on this is salting the chicken.  I would not use any additional salt.  The broth and capers (even rinsed and soaked) have enough salt for the recipe.  

Lobster Ravioli was a perfect partner.  Cook the ravioli's right to when the first one starts to float and drain quickly.  If they are wet and some of the starch water goes back into your pot that's fine because the starch water helps to permeate the pasta and hold onto the sauce. For an entire 12 pack of lobster ravioli's:  Add in 2 Tbsp of butter, 1/3 cup of white wine, 1/3 cup of chicken broth, 1 garlic clove  and 2 Tbsp of tarragon.  I add S+P and more tarragon and garlic to taste.  Mix gently and saute the ravioli's for a few minutes until the alcohol burns off.  Before serving, squeeze some lemon juice over the top

This is such a delicious recipe, and my family loved it!  I used rice flour instead of white flour, and used chicken breast instead of medallions, so cooking time was a lot longer.  I poured the sauce over the chicken before serving.  The presentation of this dish got a favorable response from everyone when I placed it on the table!

This was amazing! The chicken came out so tender. The lemon flavor was just enough without being overpowering. Once the sauce was made, I added the chicken back in with the sauce (I didn't bother with heating the platter beforehand). This recipe yielded a meal that was pretty close to perfection! I followed the recipe with the exception of adding the capers (I didn't have any on hand).

Yes, wonderfully easy (thanks to the video).  A tad on the bitter side but it's something that can be controlled.  Delicious, quick, and...delicious.  
Yes...I'd make it again.

Made it as-is and was very good! My daughter even liked it and she's not really big on eating dinner... I think she's just jealous that I can cook better than her thanks to my secret website. I believe that we served this over white rice, but next time I'll try noodles. The lemon really makes this a tasty meal.

Definitely would make this again. I didn't change anything except I had to use dry parsley, my grocery store didn't have fresh. The lemon was perfect and the capers balanced nicely with it.

This was fast, easy and flavorful.  I made two changes: using vegetable broth instead of chicken broth (had to use what was on hand), and I also added a couple splashes of chardonnay to the pan with the garlic to help deglaze.  I used meyer lemons to try to help cut the bitterness as stated by other reviewers.  I thoroughly enjoyed this dish however my husband said it was too much lemon for him.  I think it's a matter of personal taste and no fault of the recipe.  i will probably make this again for myself!

This is delicious!!! The only thing I would do different next time is to double the sauce ingredients. I put it over pasta and it could have used more lemon sauce.

It was a bit more tart than another other recipe I have used in the past.  I added some mascoto and reduced it down. Helped to balance out the tartness.

This was a FANTASTIC recipe! I only had 2 chicken breast so I felt the sauce was a bit too strong on the lemon flavor but other than that, I paired it with her and butter mashed potatoes and some fresh steamed veggies and this recipe was delicious! I will make again for the boyfriend when he's back in town and see how he likes it.

Followed the recipe as written. Chicken was excellent, although I could have seasoned it more (my error, not the recipe's).
The sauce tasted great. It had a nice and prominent lemon flavour, without being overpowering or bitter. The only negative about the recipe is that there wasn't a lot of sauce to pour over the chicken. Again, this might have been my own error with simmering the sauce in the pan for too long. I would personally increase the volume of chicken broth used to make sure there was extra!
Excellent recipe!

I was really excited to make this one, and it wasn't the easiest recipe to cook. Presentation wise, it looked great, but it was so bitter. I definitely recommend not throwing those lemon slices in right in the beginning. Even my boyfriend who eats everything said "this wasn't your best babe."

I've made Chicken Piccata for years, and thought to try a different recipe. I just didn't like this version. For me, it lacked the delicacy and gourmet appeal that I normally associate with Chicken Piccata, and it was overpoweringly citrusy. I think the chicken stock  makes it ordinary and gives it an odd thick consistency. My usual recipe calls for lightly dusting the chicken in seasoned flour and then sauteing in equal parts butter and olive oil, deglazing with white wine and adding fresh lemon juice and capers at the end. Sometimes I add fresh mushrooms, which are not original to the recipe, but we like it. I think I'll stick with that. It's also easier.

Came out a little too bitter for my tastes when made as directed, so I added small quantities of chicken broth, garlic, and pepper until I thought it was absolutely perfect. Thank you for the recipe-- it's a new favorite!

A bit too lemony for me, but will reduce the amount of lemon juice next time. Also, the sauce reduced too much so there wasn't enough to coat all the chicken. Will remake the sauce for the leftovers, but overall, pretty tasty. I paired it with  baby spinach and baked sweet potatoes (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/18249/baked-sweet-potatoes/?internalSource=search%20result&referringContentType=global%20nav)

Very tasty chicken. The family loved it. I did make a few small changes. I felt as though the amount of lemon would be too much so I only used 1/8 cup of fresh lemon juice. Also, when I cooked the lemon slices, I took them out of the sauce after cooking for 5 minutes.  Lastly, once the sauce was reduced, I placed the chicken pieces into the sauce and let them simmer for a couple of minutes. Excellent flavor!

I made this, along with an orzo and kale recipe from this site. I took the advice of others to use a Riesling in place of some of the chicken broth, it added a very delicate and refined finish to the sauce.  I went light on the lemon, using juice and a little zest toward the end, and experienced none of the lemony bitterness others reported, thankfully. This is a lovely dish that I would cook again, especially for guests. Might be a bit sophisticated for the kids. We'll see when they get home from school!

This is a great recipe!!  Made it and loved it. The only change I made was to bake the chicken pieces in the oven (after browning) at 400 and for 25 minutes.  The pieces were still juicy and the sauce was awesome.  I made a few substitutions. I didn't use fresh parsley and I didn't use fresh lemon juice -- it was still great. I've been craving it since I made it last week...will be making it again tonight!

Made this dish without the capers. I also didn't warm the serving dish in the oven. I also read the recipe super fast and figured the chicken went back into the sauce at some point. Lol well I'm an idiot so, close to the end I cut the chicken (which was almost cooked) into medallions and simmered them in the sauce until they finished cooking. I added diced onion to the pan prior to the garlic then deglazed the pan with white wine before adding the chicken stock. I also found the sauce to be bitter due to the pith of the lemon. The sauce was also very lemony! Next time I'd use a little less lemon juice and I wouldn't simmer the lemon slices in the sauce. Maybe for just a moment them use them to garnish? Good enough to eat though.

Wish I had read the other reviews before I simmered the lemon slices. The sauce was so bitter. I'll try the recipe again, adding the lemon slices at the very end. But, until the recipe is changed, I can't give it a higher rating.

I made it exactly as written and it was easy and very good.
It didn't make enough sauce though so I would probably
adjust the sauce part of the recipe next time to make more.

I agree with Holiday Baker. I followed the recipe and after tasting thought my dish was much too bitter. I doubled the chicken broth and removed the lemon slices and liked it much better. I served it over penne pasta with French green beans and it was very well received. The wine we served was a 2007 Matanzas Creek Chardonnay and it really complimented this dish. I would serve this again with the above mentioned changes.

I probably shouldn't have made this tonight.  Didn't have a lemon or capers.  Still turned out quite tasty.
Used RealLemon and added salt to offset the sourness that would have been offset by the saltiness of the capers had I had them.  (I read elsewhere that I could use a multitude of substitutes for the capers...but had none of those on hand either.)  

Will make this again!

It was okay. I've had much better chicken Piccata than this one, with much more flavour.

was good, however ...what i did learn was to ensure you dont get that "bitter rhine taste" from adding lemon slices w/peel-you should first blanch the whole lemon! voila' no bitter peel taste!
But thank you, overall tasty!

I used lemon zest instead of lemon slices.  It was soooo good.  I would serve this dish to guests at a dinner party.

I have a butcher nearby that sells flash frozen already breaded and fried chicken breast filets--briefly recooked for deglazing purposes... Viola! Dinner party for 12, over pasta, done in an hour with rave reviews.

This recipe can be amazing, but one too many squirts of  lemon juice and it can become disastrous and bitter.     The key to success on this one is taste testing....over and over and over as you add in small doses of lemon.   I only used the lemon zest of 1 lemon for the first part, not slices.   Then when it came time to squeeze in the juice, do it a little at a time, and taste test after each addition.   I pushed mine slightly too far and thought I ruined it,  so I added a teaspoon or so of sugar and it corrected itself....perfectly.   And it doesn't make the sauce sweet, so don't worry about that.   Doubling the sauce (except for the lemon part and caper part) is a must.    My sauce did not need to be thickened any further.   In the end, it really did come out spectactular and looked just like the dish pictured, but I only gave it 4 stars because of it's high maintenance nature and it's potential to go south.

Made no changes.....maybe should have because this was terrible.  Granted I'm not a seasoned cook but the video made this look so doable.  The sauce was much too tart even with suggested addition of sugar.   Not going to try this again.

Because I like lemons, I added another lemon which I had sliced to the sauce and also added extra capers.  This was very good the first night but was even better the next day.

I will definitely make it again. I cooked with deboned drumsticks because I cannot stand chicken breasts. I think that reducing maybe by half the lemon juice it will not end up so sour. Using white wine would not help. I have taken two pieces of advice to remove the lemon after the boil, and using Italian bread crumbs instead of flour. Also for anyone interested, I made rice with Italian seasoning so they would complement in taste.

Made this dish and really enjoyed it EXCEPT the capers. Never really cooked with them before and definitely won't again. Far too salty for my tastes. Otherwise it was great.
I love lemon in anything. Very easy to make without having to rush to the store to buy special ingredients.

I've never had chicken piccata before but this dish was pretty tasty. The minor changes that I did was to season the flour more with a zesty herb seasoning, didn't warm the plate, didn't add the parsley, and didn't add the sliced lemons while cooking.  I add the 1/2 a jar of liquid from the capers. It did make it a little more salty but it added some more flavor to it. Topped the bowtie pasta with this dish and it was pretty amazing. My picky 10 year old actually finished his plate and he had a friend over for dinner and she finished hers too.  Will make this again soon. Thanks!

Did not use capers (didn't have any and not crazy about them anyway) and skipped the lemon slices. Also used half broth and half white wine.  Has a nice lemony flavor. Would have liked more sauce (maybe I reduced too much?)

The sauce was so bitter. It's obviously it was the pith of the lemons that did that. If I had omitted the slices simmering in the sauce, it would have been top notch and I would give this 5 stars.

I love this recipe, the only changes I made was I substituted vegetable oil for coconut oil and flour for brown rice flour. It came out delish and the sauce was still nice and creamy.  I also used basil in place of Italian parsley.  Sooo good!

After reading about the possibility of the lemon pith making the sauce taste bitter, I simply shaved some lemon zest and used that instead of the slices.  I also used seasoned panko breadcrumbs instead of the flour to give a little extra crunch. The biggest change I will make next time is to use much less lemon juice.  The lemon flavor overpowered the chicken so much that our lips puckered:/  Other than that, we thought it tasted really good and I will make this again.

This recipe is perfect. I followed it step by step (although I increased the amount of chicken and used 1.5 cups broth) and it was absolutely delicious. Loved it. So did my kids. Quick. Easy. Looks and tastes great. Thank you.

I pounded out the chicken really thin and took the lemon slices out after a few minutes of cooking, but otherwise followed the recipe. This was delicious! Very easy to make too. Next time I will use lemon zest instead of lemon slices and use the slices as a garnish. I can't wait to make this for friends.

Made just as described. Tasty but quite fattening when you consider how it's done: breaded chicken and buttery lemon sauce. Also the 3 chicken breasts were much more meat than the lemon sauce could cover. You could use less chicken without difficulty. Plenty left for lunch tomorrow.

I modified the recipe quite a bit and I loved it (so did my children)!  I didn't have any fresh parsley, so I used fresh basil. I also added black beans, onions, chopped black olives, used olive oil instead of the oil called for in the recipe and then I mixed it all into cooked brown rice.  I didn't add the lemon slices, but did include the fresh squeezed lemon juice.  The result was a slightly sweet taste with just the right amount of lemon zing to it and as a casserole, more filling but still quite healthy!

Awesome recipe! Looks amazing, not to mention tastes delicious. If anything is to change, I would decrease the amount of lemon a bit because it was too acidic for me. Otherwise, definitely a keeper.

The chicken itself turned out fine.  The lemon was insane.  Way too sour.

Too much lemon! I really liked this recipe but the lemon was too strong. I will make again but use half the amount of lemon. I also pounded the chicken thin which made it very tender.

This has way too much lemon.  Even if you like lemon as I do, you might want to taste the sauce before adding the 1/4 cup of lemon juice and capers. I wish that I had. I ended up adding more broth, garlic and white wine so that I could at least get a dinner out of it. The chicken was excellent, but it was simply fried chicken breast. (I added some garlic powder to the flour as well.)

This recipe is soooo good.  My entire family loves it. And when you serve it, the food looks very impressive! I love chicken piccata - the tangy capers, tart lemon, salty and crusty chicken.  This recipe has it all.  Do not try any other recipes. This is the best.

This recipe was delicious and my family enjoyed it very much, but we all thought the recipe had a little too much lemon juice and too many capers. Next time I will reduce the capers to 2 tablespoons, and I will use slightly more than 1/8 cup of lemon juice.  With these adjustments, I'm sure it will be perfect for us!

I love this recipe! I've made it twice now. The first time I took the lemon slices out after the first 5 minutes to keep it from being too tart and added them back in when it was served. And I used veggie broth instead of chicken broth because that's what I had and it tasted great.

The second time I used a white wine instead of broth, it was amazing!

I had lemons and a half jar of capers that I needed to use up so I made this.  Not enough lemon flavor for me but the SO thought it was amazing!  If I make again I'll double the lemon juice and add zest at the end.

This dish is amazing.  I agree with ChiTown Chef - definitely restaurant quality.  I am not much of a cook, but have started experimenting. I actually surprised myself. The recipe was easy and simple to follow.  
I did pound the chicken breasts, mixed the flour with Italian flavored breadcrumbs, and did not cut into medallions.  I also eliminated the lemon slices and added mushroom which I sauted with the garlic.
I served with organic wild rice and a simple salad.
Will definitely make the next time I have company!

Really good! Prepared as it but tried to make 1 1/2 times the sauce since I had 4 chicken breasts. Next time I'll double the sauce, but it was great and the family loved it. Served with angel hair pasta and salad.

Holy cow this is so delicious!  My only change was I peeled skin from lemon slices. You've got to double or triple the sauce because you're going to want to put it on everything!  I paired this with rice and it was awesome! Seriously this was THE best :)

I fermented lemons and wanted to find something to make with them. This dish was fabulous! I will probably use fresh lemons next time instead though, as it was a bit too tangy - but still amazing.

This turned out amazing. I used just one slice of lemon as I had read this sauce can get really lemony and then of course the lemon juice when stated. Just for flavor added some fresh basil on the chicken before dredging it in flour, but thats a personal taste. Also my local store actually cuts thin slices of breasts so that made it really simple to just cut in half.

Chicken Piccata is probably my favorite chicken dish.  I have made it a couple of times with other recipes and they were good.  This time it was unusually delicious! I think the extra lemon puts it over the top.  And this was one of the more easy and fast methods, which is a bonus.  Starting with the chicken medallions insures they cook evenly and quickly. I also sautéed sliced mushrooms with the garlic, after browning the chicken - just personal preference.  Hubs said, "You've got to make this again!"

This was delicious.  The chicken was very tender. The sauce was lemony, but I loved it. I didn't have a fresh lemon, so used only lemon juice...maybe that's why I didn't get a bitter taste.  I'll definitely be making this again. And next time I'll double the sauce.

I think the times were a bit off. Ended up reducing sauce too much, it was more like a topping than sauce.

I literally just made this for dinner. Amazing!!! Chicken piccata is my top favorite dish when eating out in restaurants but I had never made it at home. So easy and quick. It was a hit with the whole family and my 12 yr old was trying it for the first time. 
The chicken was so tender and tasty, the sauce delicate enough to taste the lemon and capers but not to overpower the rest of the flavors. I added a few sliced mushrooms to the sauce. Served the whole thing with butter linguini pasta. Perfect. Give it a try.

I didn't think I was going to like this dish since I wasn't crazy about the sauce...until I put it on the chicken. Oh my gosh, really good. Nobody in the family complained, all liked it as well. I served it with scalloped potatoes and Brussel sprouts. Will be making again.  We eat a lot of chicken and I am always looking for a different way to serve it.

This recipe was incredible! I've been really looking for a recipe that brings a lot of flavor, and this knocked it out of the ball park. Although it takes a lot of focus and concentration (as apose to making chili or something) this came out like a five star restaurant quality entree. I'm so impressed. I'll be making this at least once a month. Delicious!!!!!!
Ps. I've never used Capers before, but wow am I impressed with the flavor it delivered!!!

I loved the taste of the sauce...served it with a wild rice. the one thing I would do different is to dredge the chicken in an egg and then Panko... Instead of flour.  Yummmmm!

I made this for our Sunday family dinner, came out awesome, not a drop left. I used chicken tenders and pounded them and then the only other change was I added and 1/4 cup of white wine, when I added the lemon juice. Yummy

Great taste with jasmine rice.  I added mushrooms to the garlic and cooked in broth.  Also added a little flour to the broth to thicken it.  Will make again.  12/15 Made again but next time I will take out the lemons slices and add the lemon juice to taste.  Came out too sour.

We just love this one with mashed potatoes or pasta (fettuccine is my personal fav!)

Have made it a few times.
Here's the latest version:

Make at least double the sauce, even 4X! 
However, this requires quite a bit of time for it to thicken.  So, I've used beurre manié or a bit of cornstarch to help out.  Try adding white wine.

Also, try using center cut boneless pork chops (the other white meat). 
Incredible flavor!  Leftovers are awesome!

Everything was good, except the amount of lemon in the sauce. I would recommend using 3 tablespoons instead of 1/4 cup (4 tablespoons). Otherwise it was great.

Wow. This recipe was downright bitter. I'd suggest using a very small amount of lemon to begin then add more to taste. Perhaps not simmering the slices as well; I feel as though a great deal of the bitterness likely came from the rind. Otherwise, I'm sure that this recipe would have been nice.

Wonderful recipe!  I altered three things: nixed the capers, just not a fan; did not cook with lemon slices, just a bit too much lemon and had to add about 6 more cloves of garlic...can never have enough of that!  Served with white rice and it was fantastic!

This was OK--neither special nor horrible.  My husband, who is liberal in his praise of my cooking efforts, ate it but said nothing.  My mother, a person who despises anything with fat (there is plenty of fat in this), also ate it and said nothing.   I left it in the fridge for their lunch yesterday while I worked; it remained there when I returned home

I served this at a dinner party last night and everyone loved it. I pounded the chicken to make it thin and tender so I didn't need to pan fry for very long. Very tasty and tender chicken dish. I will certainly try it again.

Great.... this is the one that comes closest to my husbands. He doesn't use recipes nor measures anything so i struggle to find a starting point on some of our favorite dishes to help cook when he goes to schools and such.  This was a great base to start with. The only thing I substituted or added was using olive oil instead of vegetable oil, added a flavor boost package to the garlice sauteee portion, then added white cooking wine and the lemon juice to the garlic sautee and let it reduce a bit then went from their. I also didnt not cook the lemon slices after laying th e chicken in a baking dish after frying them in skillet I layed a slice of lemon on each and when the saute was done added a few scoops of the sauce to the chicken in the baking dish (just a small coating on bottom) and put the oven on 300 while we made noodles. Great dish though!

My friend gave me a huge bag of lemons and limons off of the trees in her yard so I was looking for a recipe heavy on the lemon. So glad I found this!  I took 3 half chicken breasts and pounded them flat, seasoned with a bit of poultry seasoning, kosher salt and fresh ground pepper.   Dredged as instructed and sautéed in olive oil with a bit of butter.  Reduced sauce with 1/4 cup white wine and 1/4 cup chicken broth and added lemon slices then added lemon juice and butter.  It was perfect!  Not too tart but super flavorful!  My 8 yr. old son even asked for an extra side of the lemon sauce for dipping!  4 stars cuz Significant Other says so. He would have preferred the sauce entirely in the side so the chicken stayed crispy.  I thought it was bomb as-is. :)

Absolutely awesome! This recipe was made by a neighbor for our neighborhood "Italian" night. The only change she made was pounding the chicken breasts. The dish was voted most favorite of the night. It even beat out a couple of dishes made by native Italians :) Thanks for sharing!

another great dish, I added wine to the sauce (I usually do), and removed the capers (yuck) The hardest part was juicing the lemons to get a 1/4 cup and waiting for the chicken to cook but overall a great simple dish.  I was going to try with organges next time, but it's made my rotation of dinners.

Made it just as the recipe said, and it was delicious.  I think I needed to get the sauce a little thicker with more creaminess, as we all noticed it was pretty lemony.  That said, it disappeared quickly from the table!

It was alright, followed the directions exactly and it, to me, didn't really have a "distinct" taste. Won't make again.

I really want to love this but I’ve made it twice and it’s been bitter. Next time I’ll try leaving the lemon slices out.

I have had this recipe in my recipe box and somehow neglected to give this a rating. Absolutely easy to make and the flavors are balanced perfectly. I increased the amount of the broth/lemon/butter mixture for a family preference. Because we prefer chicken tenderloins, I prepped them according to the recipe and then added the chicken to the sauce mixture until they were thoroughly cooked and warm. Thank You for Sharing.

I love chicken piccata and this recipe worked for me. I added some sugar to lessen the bitterness caused by cooking the lemon slices.  When the sauce was finished I was really pleased with the results.  Because I like more sauce, I think next time I'll double the recipe for it.  I didn't serve with spaghetti as some recipes call for since my husband and I are both diabetics.

I have made this recipe a few times, and our family loves it.  I haven't had parsley on hand any of the times, and I'm sure that it didn't make a difference on the end result.  One time I didn't have fresh lemons (for juice or slices) and it was slightly bitter.  Use fresh lemons whenever possible in this dish.  Great with mashed potatoes, rice or pasta.

I made this recipe last night with a little less chicken then was suggested, but it still turned out great.  I had to cook the chicken a little longer than suggested, but that was because I cut them into larger pieces than suggested.  The sauce had a lot of flavor, and I used a little less of it on my husband's plate then on mine.  

I did substitute gluten free all purpose flour for the regular flour when dusting the chicken breast, but it still worked just fine.  I am so in love with this recipe and am happy that I can now make one of my favorite dishes at home.

Hard to get a five star from this family because two of the grandchildren are picky eaters.  Timothy loved it and my daughter took a picture of it.  I didn't have lemons so used real lemon juice and loved the sauce.  Few less capers needed for the family, but I think it is because they are not familiar with them.  Two thumbs up from a family of six.

This was a huge hit with my family.  I don't think my husband ever gave my cooking such hearty compliments!  I felt the lemon juice was enough so I left out the lemon slices.  Other than that, I followed the exact recipe and instructions. Can't wait to make this again!

Very Tasty!! Based on other reviews, I took the lemon slices out after 8 minutes to avoid any bitterness. I used italian bread crumbs to dredge the chicken. I pounded the chicken before cooking as well.I think next time I will double the sauce so I have some left over to add on top of the chicken as necessary once it's dished. Served with buttered noodles and everyone like it!

Wow. This is one of those recipes I never would have looked for, but it showed up on the Allrecipes home page. I must confess to a couple of minor tweaks. I used olive oil, because it was there, not in the basement, like the bottle of canola oil. I also decided to not reduce it so much, so I added guar gum to thicken it up.  I'll be making this again!

I guess it was just not what I was expecting.  Very tart at the end and I added salt, pepper and quite a bit of sugar to make it edible.  The chicken was very good (I pounded them) and I served it with angel hair pasta with olive oil, parmasian cheese and parsley.  We plan on using the chicken for chicken parmasian, but we won't be making the sauce again.  Sorry. Obviously a lot of folks like this, but we won't be making again.

I love how the lemon slices brighten up the flavor.  I thought the extra lemon juice was too overpowering so I had to leave it out.  Another personal preference; it could use more garlic.  But overall it was quite tasty and easy to make.  I'll be using this recipe again for a superb weeknight meal.

Excellent flavor! But like others, I made some changes. I had about a pound of jumbo prawns that I've been wanting to use along with some chicken thighs so I used those instead of the breasts. Also swapped the chicken broth for some white wine (pinot grigio). Took out the lemon slices after about 5 minutes of boiling in the sauce. Added a quarter cup of flour (because I didn't have corn starch) to the sauce for thickness, and doubled the sauce. AMAAAAZING!!!!! Thanks for the recipe!

My husband LOVED this and asked me to add this to the rotation.  I liked it a lot and it was easy to make.  I used Rachel Ray's trick of butterflying the chicken breasts and pounding them a little.  I coated one breast in flour per recipe and one in egg & panko.  Both were good; the panko had a "nutty" flavor, but I preferred just the flour for this dish.  Thanks LemonLush for this delicious & easy recipe (my favorite combination)!

This was so perfect.  Did use bread crumbs instead of flour, and probably only added a couple tablespoons of fresh lemon juice instead of 1/4 cup at the end, and it was the perfect amount of lemon!

We make this regularly now.  Like others, we remove the lemon slices after boiling them for the 5-8 minutes and are happy with the outcome.  Best eaten right away; the leftovers lose a lot flavor within a day.

Fabulous recipe.  My kids who complain about everything I make loved it and ate almost everything on their plates.  Right before I served it I put the chicken back into the pan to coat it with the sauce for extra flavor.   A very simple and easy recipe that makes even a struggling cook seem like a chef.

It was just ok.  Hubby and I ate it, but the taste was a little too lemony for us.  Just not our flavor palate.

This was very delicious, maybe just a touch too lemony for me in the end but DH & baby loved it. We decided since the sauce made the broccoli so fantastic that next time I'll serve this with just broccoli and NO noodles/rice/etc.! Thanks for sharing.

Not that good and not worth the effort. The sauce was incredible watery even after cooking it much longer than the recipe called for and adding cornstarch. Will not make again.

This was ok, not really special at all. I had to start over after starting the sauce. I think I had too much grease in the pan from frying the chicken. I cleaned out the pan and started with fresh oil to fry the garlic. I agree with the people who said do not put the lemon slices in the sauce, but instead use lemon zest. Also, the sauce was very thin, so I had to use corn starch to thicken. The taste was good. It is very much like Chicken Diane.

Served this last night for a New Years Eve dinner party. Everyone raved about my "restaurant quality" meal! Personally, I found the lemon flavor a bit overwhelming; would cut back on lemon slices next time. This one is definitely a keeper.

Definitely an easy and really delicious recipe. I made a few changes that really helped and made it a five star:
-added half of an onion with the garlic and gave it a little time to caramelize
-added frozen broccoli florets after  the onions and garlic cooked for a minute
-used white pepper and a little bit of adobo to season the chicken in addition to black pepper and salt
- dropped some thyme into the recipe and it held up very well with the lemon
-added extra garlic which worked out perfect for me (about 2-3 tablespoons minced)
-could use 1-2 tablespoons of butter

The white pepper and thyme were winners in this recipe and really took it up a notch. Extra garlic definitely needed.

Unfortunately even with all the warnings it came out too bitter. I only had the fresh lemon slices in for 5 minutes but it was too late. Adding sugar only made it taste weird - sweet at first and then a bitter aftertaste. I did use 1/2 wine and 1/2 broth, added mushrooms and cornstarch. Didn't have time to start it over. I think if bottled lemon juice was used it wouldn't be a problem?

We made this for the second time
It's really terrific
It's not that hard to make and the only change we made was that I didn't have the parsley so we skipped but we didn't miss it one bit
This is an outstanding recipe and I'll be making it over and over again
Thanks so much

Yum! I liked it, my husband felt it was too lemony, but I like a strong lemon flavor.  So keep that in mind for personal taste.  Otherwise the chicken cooked well and was tender.  Beware though, you can cook the sauce down too much which I did.  There is a lot of chicken here, so I had some left-over sauceless chicken that I used for another recipe the next night.

Easy and delicious! I'm making this again even though we just had it last week!  I served it over angel hair pasta.  I suggest doubling the sauce if you do serve over pasta.  I also used "Real Lemon" bottled lemon juice because that was what I had available and I did not use fresh lemons -- despite those changes the dish was still very tasty.  Good lemon flavor without the bitterness.

This was delicious but I did change a few things. I cooked in olive oil rather than vegetable as it is better for you and I cut back by a half on the lemon. I find for me there is always too much lemon in recipes so maybe it's me.

This was good but like other reviewers my sauce was bitter.  I made mine with white wine instead of chicken broth. I did not use any of the pith, only the rind and juice of the lemon.  I ended up dumping the sauce and starting over...only to have a similar problem.  I salvaged the sauce with sugar but I think next time I will use chicken broth instead of wine.  Otherwise, we really like this.

This was a truly yummy recipe. I have made this twice now and the whole family loved it. I did double the sauce and found it got even better. Will be a recipe I make often. Cant wait to make it again. Thanks for sharing your recipe. It deserves a 10 star rating.

Ok... I found this recipe to be too bitter with fresh lemons and the piccata.  I made up my own version (totally on accident because I was lacking two ingredients) that made this recipe much more palatable.  Substitute the fresh lemons with Concord foods reconstituted lemon juice and instead of piccata use white kidney beans.  I made both versions and the one without fresh lemons and piccata was to die for!  I guess that would change the recipe entirely to become 'lemon chicken with white kidney beans.'  Happy cooking!

Easy and delicious recipe.  I did not add whole lemon slices though, only lemon juice and lemon zest to the sauce.  Perhaps the whole slices is what is causing the bitterness in the recipe. I also added a little cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it up a bit.

This recipe was fantastic! My boyfriend had never had chicken piccata before & he could not stop eating it! Chicken piccata is one of my go-to's at Italian restaurants & this was both lighter & more flavorful & delicious than the mom & pop Italian place around the corner. I followed the advice of others & added the lemon slices in the beginning. Served this with couscous. Absolutely wonderful recipe! I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this recipe was it was written, just adding marinated tomatoes as a tasty garnish. I served it with portabella mushroom tortellini with fresh pesto. My fiancee proclaimed it "5 star! One of the best meals you have prepared!"

It was delish.  I devoured my chicken and quickly served myself seconds.  I will say that the sauce was a bit too lemony and I love lemon.  I also prefer a thicker sauce so I a tsp of flour.  Overall a great dish

A hit! Cutlets came out juicy and savory. I did not cut into medallions but left cutlets whole--did not pound them out either. Would make again. Finished product is a nice hotel pan of lemony chicken cutlets with a light crust. Serve with Italian or French bread!

One of my go to recipes. I zest half of a lemon trying to make sure I dont get any of the white part and it comes out perfect! No bitter taste. I also press the capers into the pan to let out some of the juices as it cooks.

really really good.  I made as written and the sauce was amazing on the chicken.  I served over angelhair pasta and it was yummy though slightly sour tasting with the pasta.  We didn't mind at all though and will make again!  yummm.

I nailed it on the first try!  This dish was fantastic!  I used the advice of others and removed the lemon slices after 5 mins of boiling.  I also was low on chicken broth so I substituted half of it with white wine.  My entire family loved this dish. I served it with steamed cauliflower.

I used one lemon. I used one half of it for the slices and got a little less than 1/4 cup of juice from the other half. I wouldn't have wanted to use the full amount because this was VERY bitter. I had to add quite a bit of sugar to calm it down. I guess all lemons aren't the same, so I should have just added "to taste". I might try this again with less lemon...the chicken itself was delicious. I liked the idea to cut it into smaller pieces. It gives it more surface area for the light coating which tasted really good.

I followed the directions exactly and this recipe turned out so bitter we had trouble eating it. So sour! I would cut the lemon juice in half and add a tsp of sugar!

Thank you for this recipe it was really yummy! I recommend reading and comparing the other reviews as well, I'm glad I did. If you don't like lemon much this isn't the recipe for you! I did add the lemon slices but removed them within a couple minutes, next time I think I'll try it without the lemon slices. I also used 1 more garlic clove, added a little corn starch, used 1/2 chicken broth 1/2 white wine, pounded the whole chicken breasts. Everyone agreed it was very lemony but very good, the proof my husband had seconds. Next time I'll serve it with mashed potatoes and fresh green beans.

Really yummy-I did not have a problem with the lemons because I took others' advice and added them at the end.  My only complaint was there wasn't enough sauce (next time I will not reduce it down so much) and I think this would be wonderful over fresh pasta.

This is the best lemon piccata recipe I have found, and I've tried several.  Taking the advice from some other reviewers:  I used boneless thighs (I like them better) and pounded them first;  used Italian bread crumbs instead of flour, keeping it light; 1/2 cp white wine and 1/2 cup broth, instead of all broth; lemon zest only, no slices (I've had trouble with bitterness in lemon recipes - trying to figure it out); used the juice from that lemon and topped it off to 1/4 cup with fridge lemon juice.  Served over box garlic/pine nut coucous.  It was perfect.  Fabulous.

Texture of the chicken - great
Too lemony/sour in my opinion, too bitter in my husband's opinion
I would modify the sauce with less capers and lemon juice

We made it exactly as listed (except x3!) and it was perfect. It's very lemony, so if you don't like that kind of taste, either substitute chicken broth and leave out the lemon slices, or look for another recipe without "lemon" in the title.  :)

Thanks for a great meal!  The 4 kids all had seconds, so I'm glad I tripled it!

Added the lemon juice, used fresh, skipped the slices cooking in the sauce, added a few splashes of white wine and put everything on a plate of linguine. It was easy and excellent. I will be putting this in my recipe box.

I added 1tbsp of flour to sauce to thicken. My son and husband loved the sauce....will double it next time. Also will add salt and pepper directly on chicken next time since I added it to flour to coat before frying. I flatten and cut chicken thin to cook faster....was very good. Will make again.

Made this exactly as written.  I think I will make this again, but omit the thin slices of lemon.  Cooking the lemon peel in the sauce made it VERY bitter, so much that I actually threw the sauce away, and I think the lemon juice would probably be enough nice, lemony flavor for the dish.  Otherwise, quite tasty.

I wanted to give this 4.5 stars but for some reason it wouldn't let me. I loved it, husband wasn't a fan. I think it was a tad too lemony but I had it at a restaurant a month later and it was much milder ( i think i preferred this one tho and not the $30 one !)

I love lemon but this was a LOT of tartness. It was okay but I think I will go back to my Piccata recipe I usually use. Served over egg noodles, it wasn't a total flop I just wouldn't make it again.

Love it!  I stir the pasta in the sauce to get the flavor on each noodle.  I also garnish it with a few chopped tomatoes.  The sweetness of the tomatoes balance well with the tart lemon and salty capers.  Definitely one of my favorites!  See my photo.

I don't know what happened here, but there is nothing delicious about this sauce whatsoever made as is!  It was so acidic and had entirely too much lemon flavor than what I am used to in a chicken piccata dish.

Liked it but didn't love it. It was a bit too strong/bitter on the lemon so I added 2 TB of sugar to offset it. I think that was a bit too much/was a little too sweet. I have other lemon chicken recipes so I won't keep playing with this one to make it work better.

So yummy!  We didn't have capers, which was a bummer, but added some artichoke hearts.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Served with mixed veggies and couscous.  Can't wait to make again!

I thought it was great.  I did not have capers or parsley, but did not miss them. (I added extra garlic)  I served this with some mashed potatoes.  I will be making this dish again.

Great recipe.  It's pretty good but there was a bitter taste to the sauce for some reason.  Maybe I should peel the lemon next time because I think that's what made it bitter.

Loved this, on my second attempt  at it I did reduce the lemon juice by half, and pounded out the chicken breasts.  I still can't get over how all the picky eaters in my house loved this!

This has to be one of my all-time favorite easy recipes. I had no fresh lemons, but I have a lovely lemon thyme plant right outside on my patio, and I used about a tablespoon of coarsely chopped leaves instead. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and there was none left.

Use butter and olive oil to brown. Increase lemon juice to 1/3 c and capers to 1/4 c. Omit lemon slices and garlic.

I've made this today and absolutely loved it! I tried the sauce when it was simmering and was afraid it would be too sour but it turned out wonderful. I added a teaspoon of dried thyme and half a teaspoon of sugar to the sauce. Also, i served it with rice prepared according to Jamie Oliver's recipe: i boiled the rice with lemon zest (used  zest from 1 lemon for 2 portions of rice), drained it & mixed with a knob of butter.Thank you for this great recipe!
