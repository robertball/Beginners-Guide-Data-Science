As with all of Chef John's recipes, I make them as he suggests the first time I use the recipe. This omelette was delicious and perfectly crusted (if that is a word)! The second time I made it I used a little less cheese and it was still crispy and perfect. On a subsequent try I used 3 eggs instead of two.... mistake...
 takes way too long to get it to the point it could be easily folded... I am sticking with Chef John's recipe :)

Love this! I have been making crusty cheese omelets for a while but never before with parmesan. I usually use cheddar or colby jack, both of which have plenty of oil in them that greasing the skillet is not required. Oh, and I just use my cast iron, which is THE BEST non-stick skillet available. 

You cracked me up with your mention of the "little white things" in the eggs. I was making french toast years ago & my (now ex) husband grabbed the last piece. After he gobbled it down, I told him I hadn't wanted it anyway because the last piece always has all those little chicken umbilical cords, that have sunk to the bottom, stuck to it. The horrified look on his face was priceless!

I made this with one egg and it was perfect! I topped the egg with some fresh spinach and a slice of chopped turkey bacon. So good!  I recommend using high quality parm cheese for best flavor.

This was delicious and quite simple and quick to make. I didn't have parmesan/reggiano cheese so I used plain parmesan (fancy shred, from a bag). I needed more than 1 ounce to layer it 1/2" deep. I used 3 eggs so it needed a little longer cooking time. I also cooked 3 slices of bacon and put them on the omelet before closing it up.

My cheese stuck to the bottom of the pan and eggs were pretty flavorless.  Won't be making this one again.

Fun, came out as advertised, great look.  Don't overcook to keep the eggs moist.  Could add scallions or bacon or whatever inside.

Very good!  But it took longer for eggs to set up than one minute (3.5 for me)  I call this my "Home Alone Meal" It takes too long to make it well for two people to eat it together.  Okay with me....I don't want to share it anyway!!

Aaaaaahhhhhh, God, this was awesome! Another home run from Chef John. Served it for dinner and it was filling and hearty as hell. I made your broccoli salad on the side of this, with Broccolini. Fantastic!! Don't hesitate to make this one.

Oh my!  Really easy and so delicious!  I sprinkled just enough shredded, bagged parmesan to cover the skillet and poured in my egg mixture.  I was in a hurry, so I used real bacon bits and Monterey Jack cheese for the filling.  Very tasty and oh so satisfying!

Simple and delicious.  I didn't make any changes at all and bf said "it was the most wonderful food".  Very easy to make and it looks beautiful too, not like most of my omelets that don't seem to stay in one piece.  Who doesn't love fried parmesan cheese?

My wife is on a diet that requires her to have a lot of protein and what better way to meet that than with a cheesy omelet.  This recipe is easy to make and so far has been a hit every time I make it.  Chef John knows his stuff.

Love the texture! Was going to make this exactly as written, but I got greedy during the cooking process and added my usual omelette fillers; feta, onion, and spinach. The parmesan "shell" was outstanding!

Who would have thought such a quick and easy variation on a “normal” omelette dish would be so delicious? I certainly didn’t, but was proved wrong with the first bite. Awesome!

Yum! I made this with shaved parmesan ribbons in a single layer on the skillet, and it made a perfectly crisp shell! Eggs could use some more spices.

I followed this recipe a hundred times and it always come out perfect! It’s so versatile. As is, it’s great. If you’re feeling sassy, you can add bacon, green onions, and garlic powder. It fills you up without the that heavy feeling. Love the crusty exterior.

Freaking awesome. He's not kidding, do NOT use pregrated cheese. Easy to do, yummy, versatile-add what you want. pre-warm any ingredients you put into the middle, and the eggs should look just undercooked when you fold.

I’d make it again. It did take some getting used to. I had a problem with the look-eggs with a brown, hard and crunchy outside. But once I took bite, it was delicious! I quickly got over it.

A little salty but next time I will mix in a milder cheese. Perfect because I am horrible at flipping and this made it so easy. Oh and I love cheese.

A solid 5 star dish for me. The parmesan crust was a great touch. I made it twice in the same day. If you do not like runny eggs, make sure to let the egg settle completely.

Ok..maybe I'm being unfair. I did use that pre-grated parmesan but it was the Kirkland brand so thought it would be just as good as fresh grated.  Maybe not.  It looked good and cooked just like Chef John's but I didn't like the flavor combo.  I think I'll just stick to the old-fashioned cheddar cheese in the middle omelots.

I would actually give this 4 stars because I liked it, but the rest of the family said that they would just prefer a regular omelet. They found it too salty. I thought the crispy outside was great, but probably won't make it again for the family.

Great omelet. Have done with sharp cheddar as well as the Parmesan, Takes longer to get the crisp on the cheddar but well worth it. A bit of sauteed onions and mushrooms makes a great filling but this is terrific just as it is.

This was pretty good, but not great.  I made it as directed and added some green onion.  The outside was crispy but overall we thought this was a little weird tasting.  May make it again, but it is not going into the regular rotation.

I'm a big Chef John fan and like most all his other offerings, this is great. I really liked the crunchiness of the outside layer of cheese with the soft egg inside. Still, I'd suggest not adding any salt at all, as the parmesan has plenty of saltiness without it.

I have made this twice both times were superb the second time I topped it with thinly sliced mushrooms which cooked to perfection after I folded it.  I only added 2 small baby portobellos and it was amazing.  the egg flavor with just salt pepper and cayenne was delightful .  Thanks Chef John

Wow! Great recipe as per usual for Chef John. We did a 10" pan and 3 eggs. Followed the recipe and did add a little pinch of Kosher salt. I think for future attempts (today?) I'll hold the salt as the Parmigiano-Reggiano added enough salt for our pallets.

The crisp Parmesan was nice, but the eggs needed seasoning. Be sure to cook to just about done. When you flip the side on top, it continues to cook more.

Picky husband liked it, that says something!  Followed Chef John’s easy recipe to the T, put a little Classico pasta sauce, pan grilled tomato slices and crumbled bacon inside. Served with hash browns. Yum.

This came out perfect and tasted terrific. I'd all but given up on making omelets because I don't like the crispy-browned-egg bottom that always forms before the top is cooked. This solved my problem nicely. Definitely goes into my recipe box!

Wow this was good.  I used the big holes on the box grater the second  time and it was so much easier.  It did take longer than a minute to set but most of us don't have a restaurant grade stove at home either.  Definitely a keeper.... I think green onions on top might put this over the top!

As a bit of a purist I usually try to stick to the recipe as shown the first time I make it. I was not disappointed.
It took a while for the eggs at the centre to set up and you can't let them run underneath without spoiling the beautiful crust. My pan might be on the small side causing a thicker layer of egg. I may broil the omelet briefly in the toaster oven next time for a softer result.
There will definitely be many "next times" perhaps with the additions suggested by other readers.

As usual Chef John doesn’t disappoint! My shortcut was to use Kraft Parmesan/Romano/Asiago shredded mixture. It was very different and tasted good! Very cheesy! I’m glad he mentioned to use a larger skillet than the one I typically make omelets in. My skillet has no lid, but I inverted a cookie sheet over it and that worked great! My husband enjoyed this, as well!

This is a keeper! Yum. I make omlets every Sunday and thought I would try this recipe. It's great on its own, (I always follow the recipe the first time) Next time I'm adding spinach bacon sun dried tomatoes.

Parmesan crust tasted like pure salt.  It delivered an unpleasant  sharp slap  to the tongue.  The crust was a beautiful golden browm.  The eggs were set and moist.

Really delicious! I used a whole 5 oz. container of  Casaro Shredded Italian 4-cheese Blend and I also used olive oil Pam. Fantastic!

This was good, and we loved the crispy "crust," but it seemed a bit bland to me. Needs ... something.
