This is one of those recipes I feel very stupid for making and reviewing before seeing what I was making it other then for a photo. SO laugh all you want because I am. SO, I did not clue in....this was a recipe for a bird. Yes, I didn't pay attention to the bird word in the recipe title. AND yes I did try it, on a personal note, it wasn't bad, it wasn't great either, it was okay. Then I'm sitting here wondering, why, am I doing this...this way?! And that's when I read, what this recipe was why it was....my husband has laughed at me all evening. And it's okay, I'm laughing too. Because I don't have a bird. So as a friend suggested, I'll freeze these and break them in pieces for the birdies that visit my property over the winter. I'm sure they will love it....and I added millet seed to some of them they were easy to hold shape. But great recipe for birds...I tell you ;-)

My macaw loves these!  I used mixed tropical fruit bits instead of just raisins and added some chopped walnuts - he ate 3 of them while I was still rolling them and declared them to be "gooooood yum!" - his highest compliment.  These will be a staple in his diet.  Thanks for a great recipe.

My cockatoo loves these and I love that I can customize them with whatever bird friendly food I've got on hand.  I've made them with corn, peas, applesauce, granola, you name it!  It makes a lot and is so much cheaper than nutriberries, plus I like knowing what is in it and that there's no preservatives.  I microwave a ball for 10 seconds just to take the chill of the refrigerator off of it and my bird grabs for it as soon as it hits his cage.

My conure loves these.  I used this as a base but added applesauce, some peanut butter and a few additional veggies.  I put them in a freezer bag and just take them out and put on a plate and defrost in microwave (defrost button) for 1 minute.  Thanks for a great recipe.

The birds loved these treats. You can add or subtract ingredients that you have in your pantry. It makes a lot, too.
