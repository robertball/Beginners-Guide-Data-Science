I have to say, this sweet potato pound cake was so delicious, I almost slapped my daughter's mother, lol. Seriously though, my family and I absolutely loved it. The only changes I made were using regular cream cheese and I added about 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract(my grandmother's sweet potato pies always stood out because if it). I also made an orange glaze to top it(1c powdered sugar 3-5Tbls OJ). I'm about to make again for Resurrection Sunday dinner. This is a definite keeper recipe.

I used a gluten free flour combo 1 & 1/4 cup Sorghum flour. 1 & 1/4 C Millet Flour and 1/2 C Tapioca Flour. It turned out excellent. The cake is a keeper.

I cut the sugar to about 2.5 cups total and was short a little on the potatoes; otherwise pretty much followed the recipe. Right at 60 minutes baking at 350. The day after baking, the cake was good. 2 days after baking it was SPECTACULAR! I suspect it will continue to improve. Dense, moist and delicious, as a pound cake should be. I made a simple glaze to top the cake, which improved presentation but really wasn't needed. This recipe doesn't have many reviews but don't let that scare you away. It's a winner!
