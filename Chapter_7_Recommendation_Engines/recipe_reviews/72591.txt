This was unlike any fish I've either eaten or prepared, and I was interested to try something that seemed different. That, and having all the ingredients on hand, led me to this recipe. I seasoned the filets with salt, pepper and garlic powder before I spread the topping, then sprinkled on some paprika for color. Wow -both my husband and I really enjoyed it! Moist, flaky fish, with a rich, creamy topping that looked very attractive on the plate, especially with a sprinkle of finely chopped fresh parsley just before serving. Also a plus was that I was able to assemble this ahead of time and just pop it into the oven when I was ready to have dinner. I know this will not be the last appearance of this dish at our house! Thanks for the unique recipe!

I tried this recipe last night, and my husband is still raving about it. I thought it was very good, also; defintely worthy of anything found in a restaurant. The halibut was very moist and perfectly done. I did embellish, as I almost always do. I used parmesean (lower fat), low fat mayo & sour cream, added 1 tsp lemon zest,1/2 tsp fish rub,1/2 tsp dill weed, and fresh ground pepper. I don't doubt it would have been just as good as posted without these additions; I just can't resist "messing with" recipes. Also, I baked it over fresh spinach (from another similar recipe). This was our vege accompaniment, along with a side of mashed potatoes.
My husband usually does not touch anything with sauce; he was delighted with this dish. He can't wait for me to serve it again!

This was one of the better recipes for halibut I have had.  I made a few substitutions and additions.  I used half cheddar and half fresh parmesan cheese,  Used garlic instead of onion, and added dried dill.  I added the lemon juice, cayenne, and dill to taste.  Over all it was very good and would recommend to any who like halibut.

This is a great recipie. My whole famly enjoyed it right down to my picky 4 year old. I even used milk instead of the sour cream for a creamy mix and then I didnt have to take the "troops" all to the store for missing ingredients. We will definatly be making this one often!!

We eat a lot of halibut at my house.  I thought this recioe was pretty good just a little rich though.  The wife and kids loved it and said they would eat it again and again.  I followed the recipe with no subs.

This was a "very" bland recipe.  DH thought it was okay but definitely needed to be "spiced" up considerably.  Will probably make again but with different seasonings.  It also took almost 40 minutes to bake.

I wanted to make something special for New Years.  I made this - followed a review to replace 1/2 the cheddar with parmesan cheese, otherwise followed the recipe.  The fish was very moist and flavorful and would be a good dish on it’s own.  However, with Halibut being so expensive - I gave attention to sides and presentation.  I topped the fish on ultra creamy mash potatoes, sided with seared scallops and parmesan asparagus - all great recipes found at allrecipes.  I'm a decent cook and will say this was one of the best dishes I've ever made.  The presentation was good and the taste was phenomenal!  We will be raving about this meal throughout the New Year.  Happy New Year and thanks for a great recipe!

This dish is a wonderful treat.  I scaled it down to 2 servings, skipped the mayo and used Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream (because less fat), and substituted freshly-grated Parmesan (Reggiano Parmesano) for cheddar cheese, because I didn't have any of the latter on hand. Standing ovation.  I will do this recipe again and again and again.

I really did not think I was going to love this recipe.  We eat so much fish, though, that I was looking for something different and based on the reviews I decided to give it a try.  I used low fat sour cream and mayo which worked perfectly well.  Loving the smoky flavor of chipotle pepper I subbed it for the cayenne and used a little more red onion than the recipe called for.  Sprinkled with paprika and fresh parsley before serving and served with roasted vegetables from this site, this was a very attractive and delicious dish, worthy of serving to friends.  My husband thought this was one of the best fish dishes ever and throughout the rest of the evening he came up with one “that was really good fish” comment after another.  Very good!

I loved this I made it and put it on boneless chicken breasts also many differnet kinds of fish - Rockfish-Sole-Cod- It is one of my favorite receipes of all time. You have to adjust cooking time.  Thinner fish only takes 15 min on 375 degrees

This recipe was excellent.  My whole family loved it.  I did exchange the onion for minced garlic and added salt and pepper to enhance the taste of the sauce a bit.  I will definately be making this again!  One of the joys of living in Alaska is having a freezer full of salmon and halibut to eat all winter.  However it does tend to get boring after awhile, so its really great to have another way to cook it!  And this ones a keeper!

I made this exact except i used light mayo instead of regular, i liked it but it did have a strong mayo taste to it. I will make it again but will cut down the amount of mayo in it and probably add a bit of dill or garlic but it was yummy

Used the recipe as a base for the cheesy/creamy topping.  I used lake trout instead of halibut and was missing the onion and lemon juice, so I used lemon pepper and extra cayenne pepper.  Turned out GREAT!  I plan on trying this recipe with salmon too because I tend to have salmon and trout on hand.

Just made this tonight - my dad said it was the BEST halibut he has EVER eaten!! He is not a huge halibut fan, usually finds it too dry, but he and my mom both loved this. I made it lower in fat and cals by using Light sour cream, fat-free mayo, and 2% cheddar cheese mixed with some reduced fat Parmesan. There is no need to use the full fat, higher calorie versions - this is plenty rich and much healthier when you make these changes!

Great receipe, I didn't have any sour cream so I used 1/4 cup cream cheese, I also sprinkled some lemon grass and dill weed on fish before adding cheese sauce. Everyone really enjoyed the dish.

This is a favorite sauce for our halibut. Family and friends always request the recipe when over for dinner.  It keeps the fish nice and moist.  I found that you can vary the recipe by adding a different cheese blend with what's on hand and adding garlic and dill for extra seasoning.  I also have added horseradish as well.  The flour is necessary to keep the sauce from running while cooking.  Love it. Thanks.

I did as other reviewers suggested and salt, peppered, garlic rubbed the filets before I added the cheese mixture.  I did not deviate from the actual cheese mixture recipe and this was scrumptious!!!  However, I would suggest saving the halibut (mine was a bit pricey) and topping lame boring cheap chicken breasts with this.  It's wonderful!   I served mine with brown rice and oven roasted asparagus

My mom won $50 with this recipe back in about 1980. Her recipe calls for marinating the halibut in white wine for about 30 min. patting dry then covering with cheese mixture. Delicious!

This was pretty good.  I used fat free sour cream and 1/2 fat mayo, otherwise the fat content would be quite high.

Excellent.  I halved it for 2 halibut steaks and we really liked it.  The pepper gave it a nice bite.  Wouldn't change anything!

ok but way too heavy for fish.   I did love this on chicken breasts and had a ton of the topping mix to save for another time.  Crushed buttered ritz cracker make a killer crunch also.  Might make this as just a dip with vegies.  Thank you!

Wow!  I made this with fresh halibut when my father came to visit.  He eats very little, but even he had to finish every bite of this wonderful dish!

I usually wait till I have tried a recipe at least three times and with variations before I do a rating but this time I have only fixed it twice, because I know it's going to be a keeper. 
 I prepared it exactly as written, one time using Halibut (which is a bit pricy in our senior household) and the next time using Haddock which is about a third of the cost. Honestly I couldn't say which I liked best they were both wonderful.  I didn't worry much about the fat content, for less than a pound of fish for two people it really didn't add up too much, I just skimp on fat elsewhere during the day, week, etc.
Thanks "motherof5" for sharing a new addition to my culinary repertoire!

Wow!  This was wonderful I'm so full.  I followed everything as called but added 1 tablespoon of garlic and 1/4 of teaspoon of cayenne.  Next time I will add a 1/2 teasoon cayenne because I like things spicey.  My husband and I enjoyed the topping so much we made another batch substituted the flour for 1 tablespoon of real bacon bits and put it on a baked potato

This recipe is so delicious.  I didn't change a thing.  I did however, lemon pepper and mince garlic the steaks before pouring the sauce over them.  My husband really enjoyed this too.

We don't eat enough fish so I have been trying to serve it at least one night a week.  I tried this recipe tonight along with Superfast Asparagus.  It was delicious.  My husband liked it very much and 
he usually doesn't enjoy most fish dishes.  It will be something we have often.

Very tasty!  Other reviewers called this rich, and I'd agree, but if that's your thing, then it's not a problem (could possibly lighten things up by substituting plain yogurt for mayo).  I followed this recipe pretty much to the letter (used green onions), and enjoyed it thoroughly.

This was THE best halibut we have ever had! Better than any restaurant! Used garlic instead of onion and added a little fresh parmesean to the mix and on top...plus a little salt and pepper rubbed on the fish before covering with cheesy goodness.  It gave a crispy crust and moist fish with an AMAZING sauce. Plus, it's so easy! THANK YOU!!

Have been using a similar recipe for years. I use sour cream or plain yogurt w/shredded parmesan. The last few minutes place under broiler for a beautiful glaze. Wonderful, dont overcook. Will continue to cook once out of oven.

The sauce on top of the halibut melted to the sides leaving the halibut to boil and simmer in a pool in the baking dish. Not too appetizing to see that. If I wanted boiled halibut I would have steamed it and then prepare the sauce to serve with the halibut.

Enjoyed this just the way the recipe is written other than using pre-grated mix of cheeses.  Moist, delicious sauce that puffs up and turns a nice golden brown.  Looking forward to trying this over a less expensive fish - maybe cod - but the halibut was outstanding.

I've made halibut like this for years and it's still one of my favorite halibut recipes! Try using Fillets instead of steaks and add dungenous crab to the sourcream mixture for a truely wonderous entre!

I live in Alaska and i catch my own fish from the ocean or rivers here. I can say i love fish and normally eat it once or every 2 weeks. This tasted like sour cream and mannoise soup.  Ill rather stick with a more traditional method of cooking Halibut : Parsley , Basil, Garlic , Pepper , and olive oil. Unless you don't like the taste of fish and like mannoise.

We all really enjoyed this. It could have used a little more seasoning maybe, slightly bland. But overall very good and the fish was super moist and flakey.

This was a very tasty, and quite simple way of making fish.  I found that there was a very excessive amount of sauce, and the flavour of the mayonnaise was very strong.  It was almost like the fish was just there to hold the sauce, not that the sauce was enhancing the fish.  I might make it again, but I think I would half the amount of mayo, increase the ratio of sour cream, and increase the amount of lemon.  
Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was delicious and looked fancy. I couldn't find halibut so I substituted grouper. It was still great, but I will try again with halibut. I also used a parmesan/romano blend for the cheese and doubled the cayenne because I like a little spice.

I've made this twice now and we really liked it both times.  I have individual oval Corningware casserole dishes that are perfect for this recipe.  I bake it covered for half the time and then, uncover.  I'll also slip it under the broiler to add some more color.  A bright green garnish is definitely needed to "pretty this up."  Thank you!

This was an easy recipe, and great taste! I am a beginner cook and I had no problems making this. I followed others suggestions and foiled the baking dish, added dill, s/p the fish, and cooked at the times listed. It came out with a really good flavor. The fish was moist and the sauce was not overpowering, it left me with a taste of halibut. I also did 1/2 cup parmesan and 1/2 cheddar. DELICIOUS!

Okay my husband gave this 3 1/2 stars only because I think this was the first time he tried Halibut.  He liked it alot, cleaned his plate I think the problem was with the price of the Halibut.  No fault to this recipe.  I did read reviews and make a few minor tweeks.  Since it is only the 2 of us there was only 1 lb Halibut so I cut the recipe in half.  I used 1/2 Chedder Jack and 1/2 (imported Parmesean).  I also added some dried dill weed and salt & peppered the fillets before adding the mixture to the top.  Being it was thick I left at the 425 for 5 minutes longer and added 5 more minutes to the 350 cooking time adding an additional 10 minutes to the overall dish.  Other than that. . .will make this dish again.l

I tried this last week and it couldn't have been any easier to make..Followed the recipe exactly and it came out moist and tender with alot of flavor and the topping did not overpower the halibut.Good job.

Crazy Good! Added some lemon zest. That's it! We're thinking of doing this with other types of fish. You would think the cheddar would make the sauce heavy...Not So! Very Good Eats!

I use 'white fish' and often substitute LF Yogurt for the Sour Cream and always use LF Mayo.  I also add extra minced onion.  We LOVE this and have it often.  I've also added a little curry instead of the cayenne for something a little different, or even garlic.  MMMmmm!

This is a recipe you use for the old Halibut in the back of your freezer.  It's not for good  fresh halibut, but it moistens up the older,drier fish that makes a home in the back of many freezers

I was a little skeptical but I tried it due to the good reviews.  I had company over and she asked how i made it so that was a good sign!  I substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream b/c I did not have sour cream on hand - and I forgot the lemon but it still tasted great - very moist with a little "kick" from the cayenne pepper.  Next time I may try even a bit more cayenne but we love spicy.

This is a great recipe, simple with small ingredient list and very tasty.  I changed it a bit and added some packaged dry zesty italian salad dressing mix, about half a bag, to the topping along with some onion powder.  Was great to add just a bit of additional flavor.  Had a thicker steak and needed to cook an additional 15 minutes, but fantastic recipe.

We regularly make this for company, especially when children or fish sceptics are among the guests.  It is delicious using halibut, Hawaiian Ono or Opah, or any white flaky fish.

I made this today with fresh Alaska halibut a friend caught. I replaced the cheese with a mix of parmesan, romano and asiago, The sour cream with greek yogurt and green onions plus a little extra cayenne.  It was amazing. My lovely wife loved it. We will be having this one again!!!

Made this today for a family lunch and it got rave reviews. My father loved it and took home some, same for my cousin who asked for the recipe. Will make this again. Followed the recipe but didn't have sour cream so used all purpose cream instead. Also added honey mustard and tabasco because I didn't have ground cayenne pepper. The sauce was rich and very tasty. Will definitely make this again.

This sounded wonderful, but not really on our diet.  I don't measure but used about 1/2 the cheese, 1/4 c low fat mayo, 1 c Bulgarian yogurt (left out lemon), GF Flour, 4 diced green onions, cayenne and I seasoned the fish steaks.  Great!

I make something quite like this but without the mayo.  I do use the light sour cream combined with butter.  I layer sliced onion on the halibut, pour the butter sour cream mixture on top of that and then put sliced cheddar cheese on top.  It is soooooooo  good!!

We really enjoyed this recipe, this is a great way to server halibut, as halibut is a very easy fish to over cook on the grill.  The topping keeps the halibut so moist and delicious.  I followed the recipe, but added 2 minutes under the broiler.  Turned out wonderful and we will be making this again.

This was easy to make, and husband said it tasted "good enough to make again" which usually means 4 stars. I noticed that I had to cook it an extra 5 minutes on the lower setting. I also took the advice of others and salt & peppered before adding the mixture on top. Next time I'll probably add some herbs to the mixture.

This was fabulous and was even enjoyed by a so-called "non-fish" eater. The only thing I did differently from the recipe was double the cayenne pepper and added dill weed. Every morsel was devoured and I will definitely be making this again.

Just tried and this is fantastic. Very tsaty and different. I also used 1/2 parmesan and 1/2 cheddar cheese. I salt and peppered fish and sprinkled it with garlic powder before speading sauce over.
My husband felt it was gourmet quality. Will definitely make again.

I halved the cheddar cheese mixture to top 1.75 lbs of halibut filet and it was more than enough.  I used scallions instead of onion and put some salt and pepper directly on the filet before topping with the mix.  My filet was thick so took some extra time to bake but this was "supreme"!  Very good and I highly recommend it, however, I also recommend filets in lieu of the steaks if you don't mind the extra money - it's worth it.  Enjoy!

Fabulous fish - tender, moist and so flavorful! I made this with Nile perch, a thick white fish fillet. I recommend jazzing up the topping with more seasoning; I used 1 tsp. each of dill and Old Bay seasoning.

EXCELLENT - fast and easy. I used yogurt and a little mayo instead of full amounts of mayo and sour cream.  It was so easy and so good.  My "meat and potatoes" husband said we should add this to our regular repitoire.  Thank you!!!

I made a few substitutions. I used light mayo, plain yogurt (didn't have sour cream) and dried minced onion(lazy to chop 1T) but this was still the best halibut I ever made so quickly and simply.

This is a wonderful recipe. I had very thick filets so I cut them lengthwise. I also added more red pepper as we like spicy! This will be a regular at our house from now on. Thanks for sharing!

great recipe! although it was a little rich, it was still very good. we eat a lot of halibut living in alaska, so this was a nice alternative to the usual way we'd make it. i'd just recommend adding a bit more spice to the mix. the cayenne was good, but didn't seem like it was enough spice-wise. regardless, with tweaking a little here and there and adding more spices, this is one that will be a repeat dinner in our house- thank you!

Made this exactly as suggested except added another 1/2 cup of cheese since i am a cheesey person. Turned out great. My wife dislikes mayo and sour cream so i did not tell her what was in it,and she devoured it.

This review might be unfair, because I used tilapia and low fat versions of sour cream and mayo.  However, my three stars relate more to the taste of the sauce (not the fish), so maybe the comments on the use of low fat ingredients might be helpful for some.  To the recipe's credit, it was very easy and quick.  I thought I'd like the sauce, but found it to be lacking much complexity or depth.  I do a baked chicken dish with the sour cream and mayo with lemon juice and curry that is just wonderful.  I had hoped the same for this, but it just didn't do it for me.  My 2 year old ate it up, which was good.  My husband cleaned his plate, but also said something was missing in the taste of the sauce.  He said he would have given it four stars.  I think full fat versions of mayo and sour cream might have been better.

I made this with mahi mahi (no changes to the sauce recipe).  I love that it was so simple, and everyone in the family thought it was delicious.  It's a keeper.

Made this as part of the Easter dinner.  It was a big hit.  Everyone loved it.  Will definitely make again for a special event using the Hailbut; however, I will try it again using a less expensive fish.

My husband gets bored with fish so I was looking for something new. He loved it! I added a little bit of fresh cilantro to the sauce and it gave the flavors a little pop. Thanks for sharing.

I made this last night.  My husband and I both liked it.  I adjusted the recipe to serve two people and followed the recipe exactly (except that I used two green onions.)  It came out great.  We'll make this one again.  I bet it would work well with any white fish.  I might try it with mahi-mahi next time.

This recipe was good, but a little too rich for me.  I feel like the toppings mask the taste of the fish. I prefer to eat fish with just a little seasoning & lemon, but I figured I'd try something different. I probably won't make this again.

very good.  I followed the recipe as written except I put closer to 1/4t of cayenne and it was great.  Next time I might add some garlic also but hubby loved it.  I served it over brown rice with some seared spinach and cottage cheese.  Yum

I loved the topping on the halibut and think it would go nicely over many different kinds of fish. I was expecting a little bit more heat from the cayenne so next time I may double it. Being this is the first time I have ever cooked Hailbut Steaks I will say that I really was not fond of the fish itself but the recipe in general was very good.

Before spreading on the topping, I sprinkled salt, pepper, and garlic powder on both sides of the fish. I topped everything off with paprika and parmesan, and once it was cooked, garnished the dish with dried parsley. Very good! I couldn't find halibut the day I wanted to make this so I used one piece each of cod and mahi-mahi to serve my husband and me (cut everything to 3 servings). I served this with the Spaghetti Squash w/ Pine Nuts, Sage, and Romano from this site. I'll definitely make this again, with any fish!

Yum! I thought it was going to be too cheesy for me (I'm not a cheeze freak), but no.  This is scrumptious.  I added homemade breadcrumbs (forked-pulled a slice of bread and mixed with a little melted butter to moisten) to the top at the time of heat reduction, which gave it a delectable crunch.

Super Recipe!  I've made this for people who come over to visit for dinner and everyone has loved it!  It's nice and juicy and makes a great halibut "taste". Halibut tends to be a dry, bland fish so this recipe is a perfect way to give it some taste and texture!

I liked this dish, however, next time I make it, I am going to make a few changes -- mostly, I think the sour cream and mayo combo is a little too tangy.  Next time I'll just make a white sauce with flour, butter and milk, then add the same seasonings, lemon and cheddar and I think that will suit my family's taste much better.  Thanks for the idea!

Super easy prep. and very moist fish.  I'm not a fan of onions, but they were mild enough that I enjoyed the dish.  We will make this again.

really good recipe. I made it for my picky boyfriend and he loved it. I didn't have any sour cream, so I substituted with 1/2 C buttermilk and approx. 1 tbsp melted butter and it turned out great! I'll definatly be making it again.

This recipie was a hit at my house, a house that usually does not see any fish. My husband is not a big fan of fish, but he loved this dish.  It was, surprisingly, light and moist.  I did add a little bit of horseradish to the mix... we like a bit of bite.

I made this last night and it was sooooo good. I left out the cheese though and halved the recipe. I lightly spreaded it on the fish and then when it was done put a little dollop of sauce on. It was plenty rich enough like that.

1/4 cup light daisy sour cream
1/4 cup light best foods mayo
juice of one small lemon
cayenne
pepper
diced onion

soooooo yummy!

Great recipe for other white fish as well,not just halibut. Even my 21 month old loved it.  My family doesn't like spicy so I omitted the pepper. I served it with mashed potatoes which the leftover sauce goes great with. It's definitely a repeat recipe!

This always turns out great! Like most everyone else I use substitutions depending on my pantry contents and mood, but the basics of the recipe are just what I need to guide me. The last time I made it I used onion powder and garlic powder instead of onions, Parmesan cheese on top instead of cheddar mixed in, and no flour to keep it low carb. It is also good with salmon instead of halibut! Thank you for posting this recipe.

Great flavor and very moist! I only had one pound of halibut so I cut the recipe in half. The fish was done before the sauce was browned. I will adjust the timing next time.

It was very good!!!! I used a little more lemon juice than what the recipe said and sprinkled that extra right on the fish before putting the mixture on top. I also put some butter in the pan. I doubled the everything in the mixture except the cayenne pepper and cheese. I only used a dash of cayenne and only half the amount of cheese it would have called for. I will be making this recipe again sometime!!

Halibut is a little on the dry side. It’s a very mild fish. I’ve tried 7 or 8 different recipes, and this one beats them all, and not by a little bit. The Halibut is really moist with just the right kick to it. Don’t change a thing.

I had a friend bring me some halibut from  Alaska. Since I am not a big fish cooker, I have to thank the all recipe peeps once again for saving my wanna be chef self.   This was absolutely delicious and  Everyone at the table raved about it! I shared it with my friend so that he can use it next time he cooks halibut.  next time I will bake it for 5 minutes less.  Now I just need my friend to hand over his cache of fish....

This recipe is superb. I deviled it by adding mustard powder, a bunch of green onions, garlic salt, curry powder, and a good dousing  of a vinegary hot sauce (valentina). I made this with a whole lingcod  filleted and cut into individual servings and it flat out dissapeared within minutes. My wife who is a scanty eater ate two plates. Definitely an awesome way to bake fish, no matter how you choose to adjust your seaonings. Serve with a starch and salad/veggie, and some good bread to sop up the extra sauce. Yum.

I have a freezer full of Halibut that I caught and this recipe is definitely my favorite.  I've made this numerous times and just can't  get enough of it.  I generally spice mine up with extra lemon juice, cayenne pepper and onion, but that's just to suit my taste.  Follow this recipe as it is and you won't be disappointed.

This was  good.  I added some dried dill and minced garlic.  It would be just as good with a less expensive white fish though - it almost seemed like a waste to cover up the taste and texture of fresh halibut.

Easy to follow recipe with ingredients I had in the house. The fish stays very moist. This makes for a quick, flavorful meal. Follow recipe exactly. Will make it again.

My husband LOVES this! We've taken it to a friend who is recovering from surgery. I have cut the cheese and used 1/2 Parmesan. Do salt, pepper, & garlic your fish before putting on the sauce.

My first time cooking halibut and it was delicious and moist. I especially enjoyed the bits that sizzled at the bottom of the baking dish, adding a little cheesy and satisfying crunch.
Thank you for sharing the recipe.

This was an unusual sauce for fish, but it works!  Everyone from my 8 year old to my husband loved it.  It was rich.  I did not add the flour.  The sauce was thick enough without it and I actually would have liked the sauce to be a little more "saucy".  Next time I'll add milk to it so we will have sauce that runs into our rice.

This was a very easy and fast recipe. I changed it a bit instead of using Cheddar Cheese I used Parmesan Cheese. I also added 3 stalks of green onion.I follow the rest of the recipe as it was written. It did take about 10 min longer to cook than listed.

I really enjoyed the idea of this recipe but I decided to tweak it a little per previous suggestions. I rubbed it down with seasonings/herbs first: salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. Then I used half chedder cheese and parmesan. I also only used 1 heaping tbl sp of mayo and sour cream each (taking in mind I only had 1 large Halibut filet), and added a tsp of Siracha. This made the cream much less rich because I was forced to glaze the fish more than slathering it. Was also able to bake brussel sprouts and potatoes as the side dish at the same time because of how quickly the fish cooked.

This is a great start to a sauce.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that this may require a bit of tweaking to get it to your personal taste, but it is a nice, hearty, creamy sauce on its own.  It may be a bit plain, but it also is something that probably does not need a special trip to the grocery store, and you probably can make a couple easy substitutions and have things come out fine if you are missing a couple ingredients.

this is a great recipe thank you for sharing.  Sorry i seem to always just use recipes as a base (jumping off point) i used sharp cheddar cheese (probably 2 cups) and was out of pepper so used frank's sauce (3 Tbs) and maybe two tsp of tapatio hot sauce. washed some mushrooms and put those in the pan on top.  and cooked as directed.  went great with some broccoli.  I will be using this again.

This was really great! I followed the recipe mostly, but put in about 1/4 cup of mayo and a little less than 1/4 cup of dijon mustard. I also sprinkled in about a tsp. of dried dill. The cayenne gave it a nice kick, but not too hot. Will be making this again for sure.

We just finished eating this dish and hubby (who's a cook, talk about a food critique eating w/ you *lol*) and me really liked it. I followed the recipe exactly, only swapping everything w/ nonfat versions and I used fresh caught halibut we got from a friend today and his home-made special fish seasoning. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars (hubby btw gives you 5) is because I found the mayo taste pretty distinguishable and I would've liked a subtler taste more. I will definately try this again, but will try Greek Yoghurt instead of mayo and sour cream. All in all great recipe, super easy and the halibut was the best outcome of fish I have made so far :) Thank you for posting this recipe.

Usually when I make/eat fish we dont feel so heavy after. even with low fat mayo & sour cream it was way to rich and heavy for my liking.

This was excellent and I don't enjoy fish.  The cayenne added just a hint of "hot" without overpowering the flavor.

Did not care for this very much. I believe it was the Chedder cheese that really made me not like it. I do not feel that I will make this again. A waste to a very good piece of fish. There are many better ways to prepare Halibut.

This was great! It was so easy to do, and there were no leftovers. I mixed in some dill, and garlic powder to give it some extra spice. Delicious!

The husband raved over this dish!  I used a little less halibut for the two of us.  At first I thought there was too much topping, but it was excellent.  We scraped the casserole dish to get it all.  Lemony, with just a hint of spice from the cayenne pepper.  Worthy of a company meal.

Very good, very tasty.  I made it exactly as directed.  It was very rich.  Next time I'll try it with parmesan.

Loved this recipe.  Did not change a thing.  Be prepared to have people rave over it!  I served at a recent dinner party and it disappeared fast!

My family isn't really a fish-loving family, but this was great. It took a little longer to cook then the recipe suggested. I followed the ingredients exactm but I had to up the serving size which altered the ingredient amounts. I think there was TOO much sauce and cheese. Next time, I'm going to use the recipe as-is. I also had ALL the ingredients on-hand which made it even better!

This was a very easy recipe that had mouthwatering results! The fish was tender and flaky and had just the right amount of cayenne pepper. I have already shared this with friends and family!

We loved this recipe, fish is tender and delicious.  My fiancee said it was the best fish he had ever had, very flavorful.  We'll be having this often.

I had thawed out Halibut and needed something that was quick to throw together, quick to cook and also tasty enough for my 6 & 8 year old to eat!  Everyone enjoyed this meal!

I made this for my wife, who is very finicky when it comes to fish.  She liked the sauce very much.  A keeper!
