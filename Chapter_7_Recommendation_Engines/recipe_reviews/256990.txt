Made as written and this was good. The Camembert cheese was expensive though and I think you could substitute Brie to save some money. I baked this in a flat pie dish and it stuck a bit to the bottom but the top had a nice beautiful brown delicious goldeness to it. I transferred into individual serving dishes (as shown in the picture) which made it not as pretty but the flavor was still there. My only recommendation is to double the butter and spring onion. It definitely needed more onion in my opinion.
