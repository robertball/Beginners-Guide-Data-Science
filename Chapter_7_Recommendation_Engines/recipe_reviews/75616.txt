The worst.  Don't waste your time or fish. The "sauce"  wan't sauce.  What you do is fry and kind of boil this.  Smells great because of all the garlic but yuck.  There are too many good ways to make fish to bother with this recipe.

I enjoyed this recipe. It was quick and easy. The smell is great! I would recommend using less oil for frying the fish. The sauce thickened up nicely, but I simmered the liquid a little before adding it to the fish.

We enjoyed this quite well.  Had to make a couple substitutions to adjust for what I didn't have on hand.  Used ocean perch, not halibut, peanut oil, not sunflower, water, not broth.  Used a mixture of season salt and reg. salt.  The sauce does indeed thicken up once mixed in with the fish.  My only disagreement with the recipe is that it took the fish longer than 5 minutes to brown.  Easy, quick and tasty.

I tried this recipe for dinner tonight, and I found that by using chicken broth, the dish tasted more like chicken and not of halibut. I think I will try using veggie broth next time.

My husband really enjoyed this because there was a lot of garlic.  (He LOVES anything with a lot of garlic.)  But I found that the cornmeal gets mushy when you add the "sauce."  I do agree that the sauce isn't sauce...It's quite liquidy.  The flavor was alright, but the texture was not appetising.  Subtitutions: orange roughy instead of halibut, left out the bay leaf, added Old Bay seasoning to fish and extra garlic to liquid, used olive instead of sunflower seed oil

I found this a little bland, but the good news is that fresh halibut is so delicious, the recipe didn't drown that out.  Also, the recipe kept the fish moist.  We put prepared horseradish on our plates with the fish, and combining that with bites of halibut made this perfect.   And, the fact that this recipe was so quick and easy is what made me move it from 3 stars to 4.
