This was a fantastic recipe for steak. The steaks came out wonderfully (we used Porterhouse). The taste of the stout gave it an interesting and  great taste, we will definitely be using this recipe again!

My husband loved this recipe.  I used a bottle of Guiness Extra Stout.  Personally I would give it 2 maybe 3 stars, the flavor was OK, but the smell was overpowering.  My  husband really wants me to make this again, but I'm going to wait until he can grill outside so my kitchen won't smell as much. My hubby thanks you!

I modified this recipe to work with chicken, and it turned out excellent! I replaced the steak with 3 medium bonless chicken breasts, substituted the condensed beef broth for chicken broth, and used a dark brown beer instead of stout. Cook time was an hour and 10 minutes at 350, covered. Let it marinate over night and drain juice so chicken is only half covered before placing in oven. I left out the sage.

I halved the recipe and did 1 pound of New York strip steaks. I used lite soy sauce and Sierra Nevada Stout (ok for cooking, not so much for drinking). I cooked the two steaks on a grill pan, but finished up my own in the broiler to get it well done. My husband, who had his medium done, said cooking it only on the grill pan made it a tad greasy, but I thought mine was perfect. He wasn't wild about the marinade, but I liked it ok.

This marinade seemed to overwhelm the natural flavor of the steak as opposed to enhancing it.  We wished we hadn't tried this recipe on our beautiful porterhouses.

I did away with the broth and used a Deschutes Black Butte Porter

I didn't use any onion, sage or beef broth and these turned out great!  I sauteed some carrots and onions in some of the leftover marinate and they were delicious.  I used Guiness for mine.
