Important note! Original recipe was doubled and in turn had the 2 cups of flour. Start with one and add as necessary.. sorry. ;)
Also, pears can be peeled. Just adds to prep time. Good either way!

The topping didn't look right! I didn't read the reviews until after i put it in the oven. I pulled it out of the oven & added more brown sugar and more butter...it still didn't look right so I sprayed some water until it had the consistency of wet sand. 
It tuned out DELICIOUS!!! My husband...who comes from a long line of bakers...approved!!! I will mk it again but will omit the second cup of flour.

Unfortunately did not ready the reviews prior to making so used too much flour. The topping did not turn out as it should have but everyone still enjoyed it. Will make it again with less flour and I'm sure if will be a 5.

Only 1/4 cup of butter over the pears and one cup of flour in the topping.  Got compliments.

Came out great! I used 4 came of Delmonte Pear Slices, drained and cut the pears and used 1 cup of flour and added more to my liking. I also baked it for 50 mins and it came out awesome. Great Recipe!

This was a great way to use of a bag of pears that were on the way to too ripe! I made a few changes to a recipe with 'great bones'. Since I knew the pears were going to be soft I decided to give it a contrasting texture by using 1 1/2 C of oatmeal (since it's what I had I used rolled/any is fine)+1/4 C of flour, instead of all flour. For the brown sugar I used the brown sugar Splenda to cut the carbs, and reduced the white sugar to 1/4 C. Since I only had 1+ Tbsp of maple syrup, that is all I drizzled on the pears. I decide based on another suggestion to add the butter on top of the dry ingredients, instead. I mixed all of the dry ingredients and then spread that over the pears.I decreased the amount and melted 1 1/2 C of butter, then added an increase of 3/4 tsp of vanilla to that (instead of mixing with the dry), then poured it over all. I think it puts the vanilla flavor everywhere instead of it being stuck in a glob. It was delicious and plenty sweet! Vanilla ice cream/yogurt would definitely be a great go with.

Didn't read the review first about using 1 cup of flour so I used two. It seemed to floury so I added extra butter and brown sugar. Way good!  Just the kind of topping I was looking for.

I used gluten free flour for no reason at all (just had it around), added 1/4 teaspoon of cloves and some raisins. I only used 1.5 cups of the gluten free flour. Also, at the start it says to drizzle the pears with 1/2 cup butter, then there's another 1/2 cup butter in the topping. I only used the butter in the topping and still found it pretty darn buttery...but could be because I used less flour. Good and I will use this recipe again for pears.

Absolutely delicious!!  I threw in a handful of walnuts, a handful of raisins and a handful of dried tart cherries.  When it was done I thought the crumb crust looked dry, so I shaved some butter across the top.  OMG - so good!

I decided to try this b/c I had all the ingredients at home except syrup. I used 2 cans of Del Monte pears. I cut all ingredients in half followed instructions and it was amazing. Although I left in the oven for 40 mins an additional 10 mins. Only change I made was since I didn't have syrup I drizzled a little pure honey on peaches. Will definitely make again.

I'm not a wonderful cook, but this recipe turned out great.  My pears were very ripe, so I didn't use any syrup, did squirt in a bit of honey.  It looked lovely and tasted sooo good.  I'm going to try it again with apples!! This is an easy and delicious recipe!

With some tweaks, it will be better. I'll add some sugar and more flavors to the pears, and reduce the amount of topping. And bake a bit longer.

Pretty good. omitted the stick of butter dumped over the pears (would have been way to much butter). Used oats for half of the flour and 4 cans of drained;p pears instead of fresh. Amazing!

I will probably make it again if I get another sack of pears from the neighbors.   The pears part tastes fabulous but the crumbles are kind of weird, not bad just odd, not quite what I was expecting.  Still, a good recipe overall.

Easy, delicious dessert. I halved the recipe for the two of us, and added one apple to the two pears I had. Also squeezed just a bit of lemon before the topping went on. Had some oatmeal to use up (just 1/4 cup) so added it to the topping. Really mostly followed the recipe. I did bake it longer than 30 min - more like 45, since I like a rather crispy topping. We both really liked this, and I'll make it again.

There was a bag of pears going to waste in my house and I was gonna let that  go down, so I found this. Kinda had to mush around the pears with the topping, otherwise it would have been too dry. I liked it though, and even someone as inept as myself can cook this so you go for it girl. Added pecans because why the hell not

This was easy to prepare.  I used three cans of canned pears instead of fresh pears that I had drained.  Everyone loved it!!  I did have to cook it longer than 30 minutes. It took about 50 minutes.  Topped it off with whipped cream instead of ice cream.  Yummy.  Definitely making this again.
