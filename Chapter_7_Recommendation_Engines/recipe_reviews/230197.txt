Very tasty. I made a 2 lb. portion of beef. Next time I wouldn't use so much Soy sauce and may add more heat to it.

I put this together in the morning for that nights dinner.  The Worcestershire sauce was a little overwhelming in both smell and taste.  Our steak wasn't as tender as I would like but I doubt if that was the fault of the recipe but more the cut of meat.  Maybe marinating longer would have helped that.

This is a very simple marinade.  It's tasty nonetheless. At this time there 
are only two other reviews.  One cited too much soy sauce while the other
cited too much Worcestershire sauce.  It's simple enough to test. Just mix
equal parts of soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce, say 1Tsp each and a dash
of garlic powder (not garlic salt). That's the flavor it will impart to the
meat.  But this marinade is for taste only. It will not tenderize as there is
no real acidity in it.  To tenderize you need to add wine, vinegar or both,
or maybe citric acid such as lime or lemon. True it will change the taste a
bit, but more complexity just might benefit this recipe.  Thanks, Renee Manz.

Very good and insanely simple marinade!  I add a splash or two of canola oil for a little extra tenderization.
