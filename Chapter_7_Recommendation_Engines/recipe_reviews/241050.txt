I loved it.  You can use garlic powder and garlic, to inhance the flavor and also help cut down on the flower if trying to make it lower carb.  But the dish is great as is as well. 

It's also is yummy if u add shrimp!

I loved it but I added sliced baby portabella muchrooms, salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the gravy and sprinkled uncle chrisâ€™ gourmet steak seasoning and drizzled soy sauce on the chicken before coating it in flour.

Super easy to make and so very tasty. I pan fried the chicken in bacon grease to get the crispy crust and then I finished cooking the chicken in the oven. Using the pan I started the chicken in and the leftover flour from coating the chicken I made the sauce. Paired the chicken up with egg noodles and a salad. An excellent dinner and everyone was happy. Oh yes I used boneless skinless chicken thighs because thats what I had on hand and we like the thighs better anyway.
