This was different - I'll give it that, but I'm not sure if I'd call it Asian.  I used Hellman's light mayo and since I didn't have fresh ginger root I opted for a bit of ground giner. I used green onoin since no "type" of onion was specified. I did add the optional curry powder. This was a nice change from regular tuna salad, but one I don't think I'd make again...

This wasn't particularly Asian nor spicy.  I used an entire jalapeno, not just 1/2 teaspoon, doubled the curry powder and added celery and diced seeded cucumber.  I just couldn't bring myself to put mayo in an "Asian" salad, so I made a vinaigrette from rice vinegar, soy sauce and sesame oil.  Also, I used chopped green onions instead of white.  With the changes, this came out very good.  Spicy and Asian.

A very nice change from the usual tuna salad.  I can't give it 5 stars because the mayo amount is way off.  1/4 cup is  a crazy amount.  More like 1-2 T is all you need.  I also don't use as much onion, but that's just my preference.  It's just as good to sub lime for lemon juice.

This was really different, which is why I liked it! All the flavors went together really well. I did make this an hour before I ate it, so the flavors would mesh together a bit. I did use a couple green onions, I upped the curry to a full teaspoon and I used olive oil mayonnaise. I did not have fresh ginger so I used 1/4 tsp. ground ginger. I also added 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder. I spread this on cucumber slices and it was a really enjoyable lunch.

I thought this was a very good recipe for Tuna.  I didn't have fresh ginger root so I used ground ginger instead.   My family enjoyed the different blend of spices.   I would make this again.  Was good with crackers as well as a sandwich.

I have never had good  results mixing lemon juice with mayo. It always seperates  turns out in a watery mess.

I cut back on the mayo, added a little soy sauce and used just a small amount of ground ginger, but upped the curry powder. Very enjoyable and thank you!

This turned out pretty well - a very nice departure from the traditional tuna sandwhich. It has a bit of a kick, which is good. The ginger added a nice accent.

Not particularly asian.  And kinda bitter.  I think its the fresh ginger and curry.  I didn't have any mayo or chiles so my review of this recipe probably isn't very valid.  That said, I don't think those items would've made too much difference.  I used cilantro and horseradish cream instead (yum, right?) and wasn't too thrilled.  Its okay though- I ripped up a bunch of lettuce and stuck a scoop of this tuna madness on top.  With a little bit of italian dressing and parm cheese, it was a good little meal.

I doubled everything, except the mayo, there was already plenty. It just wasn't special or flavorful at all. I should have added the mayo 1 tbsp at a time instead of dumping 1/4 cup in there. That may have helped. I'm going to leave it in the fridge over night and see if that helps the flavor at all.

Lovely!  Made this for dinner as sandwiches with lettuce, tomato and cheese, along with Edamame Soup from the BHG website.  Used red onion (will add less next time... too much of a kick), added 2 tsp of sweet chili sauce instead of the pepper, omitted the curry and added 1/8th of a tsp. of paprika.  Yummo!  Tasted better than the name-brand-tuna-in-sauce they sell for a mint in the grocery stores.  Will be making this again!

Very tasty! I doubled the tuna, halved the ginger and the mayonaise. I also used fat-free Best Foods Mayo and I didn't try the lemon, but I may on the next round. I used 1/2 of a serrano pepper.This recipe will undoubtably become a staple recipe in my home!

Great change from the usual tuna salad.  I use fat free Miracle Whip instead of mayo and it turns out wonderful.

I liked this. I used the optional curry powder. It wasn't really spicy, though.I had some leftover hamburger buns so I buttered and toasted them in the toaster oven. Served with Asian coleslaw also from this site for a quick and easy late Sunday lunch/early dinner. Perfect for a hot day and something a little different than the usual tuna salad.

Absolutely the best tuna salad I've ever had!  I used ginger paste from a tube (because who likes cutting up ginger) and Miracle Whip.  I feel like eating this every day.

I've been making this for years as is except for the grated ginger root, I use ground or Gourmet Garden Ginger Stir-In Paste (Can be found in a tube in the produce section). We love it on sandwiches during lent season. 
I don't know why this recipe isn't the first to pop up when I search for Asian Tuna Salad on this site.
Thank You for sharing RK!

Wow, this was really good, but it wasn't very spicy. I used two teaspoons of canned diced green chile peppers and I could still barely taste it.
