I thought it was great, my husband too. I added the broth and a little flour so it was a sauce. I love it thank you for sharing :D

I agree with Emily that adding some broth to make it more of a sauce is the way to go.  My wife loved it and said we could definitely add this into the regular rotation -- which is fine with me as it's pretty simple to prepare.  Very good dish!

This chicken was amazing. I followed the recipe except with the omission of butter, in its place I used olive oil with a dash of sesame oil which gave off a good aroma. My girlfriend says this now one of her favorites, thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe wasn't bad, just average. I wouldn't make it again.

I made the marinade in the quantities listed, but I only used two boneless chicken breasts, cut into strips.  Marinated for more like 6 hours, and then poured most of the marinade into the pan with the chicken.  Without any flour or cornstarch, the sauce thickened up a bit, and I served over rice.  Other than planning this early (because of the marinating time), it's probably the easiest recipe I've tried.  It had great flavour, and we will definitely be adding this to the regular rotation.  Might add some chopped peppers in with the onions next time for some color.
