Delicious and dangerous. The first time I made these, I made the mistake of making them for just my boyfriend and myself; it was impossible to stop eating them. So, next time I made them extra healthy, using whole wheat flour, shredded chicken, chopped fresh spinach, and chopped artichoke. I rolled it up with some parmesean then topped it with mozarella (I used less cheese, but still got some calcium...made a nice crispy topping too). We used the tomato sauce as a dip. I highly recommend this recipe to everyone, especially if you have kids or boyfriends. I'm surprised that this one doesn't have more reviews because it is so delicious and fun to eat!

Oh YUM!  This ones a keeper!  I have made Calzone for my family and friends for years.  It's a labor of love.  Made these last night for dinner.  They are so good, and much easier than rolling out 18 rounds of dough for Calzone.  I don't know how she fit them into 2 9" pans, I had to use 3.  I did use a whole onion, lots of mushrooms, more cheese, and Canadian Bacon instead of Pepperoni.  When making Calzone, I usually use Sweet Italian Sausage, so will try that next time, as it would be easier to cut into rolls.  These were great with a salad.  If I could give it 10 stars, I would.  They are that good!

Very good basic recipe. My boyfriend calls these PizzaBons as they kind of look like Cinnabons! I don't have a bread machine so I proofed the yeast in my Kitchen Aid mixer then added the shortening, and then the milk, salt and flour. The dough was a bit stiff so I had to finish up by hand though (just 2 minutes kneading).  I added crushed garlic and dried basil and an Italian herb blend to the sauteed veggies. I omitted the green peppers as we don't like them. The dough rose perfectly and was so easy to work with I didn't even need flour to roll out, but was a bit bland -  and 1/4 tsp more salt next time, and add herbs to the dough itself as well. I recommend doubling the veggies, sauce, meat and cheese - the amount given only covered one batch.

I made my own bread dough since I didn't have the dry milk powder called for in the recipe.  I also left out the mushrooms and peppers since I didn't have any on hand.  Despite the omissions, the rolls came out very well!  For one half of the dough, I spread bbq sauce instead of tomato sauce and used chicken to make a bbq chicken calzone.  This recipe has a lot of possibilities.

4.5 starts for the dough alone.  It's incredibly soft.  I used olive oil for the shortening and used 2 tsp salt.  The kids & I made mini pizzas and then with the leftover dough we made cinnamon stix & cheese stix.  Awesome, awesome dough.  Very versatile.  Thanks for sharing!  I'll be trying the rolls very soon.

4.5 stars.  Very good, added extra salt to dough, and didn't use a bread machine.  Doubled sauce and toppings and covered risen rolls with more cheese and baked, used left over sauce for dipping.

I don't have a bread maker so I used frozen pizza dough to make these and they turned out delicious. I would love to try this dough recipe too though at some point. It was a fun change from regular pizza.

this was really yummy. i dont have a bread machine so i made the dough by hand using the same dough recipe i use for pizza. i topped it with pizza sauce, some minced meat, salami, green peppers, olives and cheese. i fried the topping in some olive oil first, with pepper and italian seasoning. i think i must have put too much topping because i had a hard time rolling it up and when i was slicing it alot of the inside stuff came out so the end result wasnt too pretty, but it tasted really good. its very similar to making a pizza -u just roll it up and slice at the end! thanks for sharing the idea, will be making this again. hopefully ill get better at it and be able to make it more presentable, so i can serve when company's over as well

First off, I was pleasantly surprised by how easy the dough was to handle straight out of the bread machine.

I would definitely use some added spices etc to spruce up the recipe next time I make it but overall, it's a great recipe that everyone would most likely enjoy just as it is.

Oh. My. Goodness.  This was amazingly delicious, and really quite simple! I made all kinds of variations, but won't hog space by sharing all of that info.  Just have fun playing with this recipe.  Use your leftovers, spaghetti sauce, sloppy joes, BBQ chicken, you name it.  My husband thanks you, too.

I had on hand one package premade refrigerated pizza dough from Trader Joe's, (Garlic  & Herb).  Nice flavor, but it was not enough, so it only made 9 small rolls. Next time I'll try the recipe dough as it is written.  Loved the filling just as written.  
I baked the rolls in greased oversized muffin tins and that worked well.

I don't know why I never thought of doing this . . .fun, and cute.  A little messy when cutting due to the sauce, but I had to clean the kitchen anyway, so no big.  The dough is very nice--light, soft, good consistency, and rises very well and fast.  I did use my bread machine for the dough, which was easy, but it wouldve been just as easy to do it by hand or in the Kitchen Aid.  I'm running out of certain ingredients, so I left out the peppers, mushrooms and olives, but they worked out fine anyway.  I made 8 of them and put 4 each in an 8x8 pan so I wouldnt' end up with undone middle rolls and burned outer rolls.  They baked up perfectly in 20 minutes.  I used the rest of the dough to make a calzone (followed the instructions for a braid using the Calzone recipe from here).  Thanks for the recipe!

I am giving the dough a four stars. The pizza filling wasn't that strong, it really tasted more like a roll with pizza flavoring not rolled up pizza. The dough however was amazingly soft. I don't have a bread machine so I made it by hand and let it rise once then followed the directions of the recipe. I am using this dough to make cinnamon rolls because it's so light and soft.

The whole family enjoyed this. The crust was excellent. I did use my bread machine, but it wouldn't be hard to make it without one. I think this recipe can be universal as far as the toppings go. I plan on trying it using Alfredo sauce and chicken.

Tasty recipe! Just be careful how full you make the dough before rolling. We kinda overfilled ours, but it was still very yummy, just a bit messy.

my rating is quite similar to svnb's, I don't have a bread machine but made my dough with a KitchenAid;  I put too much filling in (sometimes bigger is not better!) and my rolls were kinda messy looking but baked up beautifully. I also added a bit more salt to the dough ( I tasted the dough and thought it needed a bit more)    I didn't have a chance to taste a baked one because I made it for Staff dinner; hopefully there will be one left over for me to try tomorrow! But everyone was 'ooo'ing and 'ahh'ing over them as they came out of the oven. I usually make thick crust pizza for Staff but this seems to be more appealing to them! thanks for the great idea, I can imagine lots and lots of other flavor combos to try.

Absolutely amazing! I used my own pizza dough recipe then topped with home made pizza sauce, diced green and red peppers, chopped fresh spinach, diced onion, diced Sanitarium "Bacon Rashers", Sliced black olives, Shredded Old Cheddar and Colby cheeses. Even my meat eating father in law gave them a thumbs up!

Delicious idea! I can't really rate the dough recipe as I used my own pizza dough recipe for this (which has italian spices and parmesan cheese in it) and then covered it with homemade pizza sauce (thin layer), diced pepperoni (didn't measure but definitely more than half a cup) and cheddar cheese. My family is a little bit picky so I didn't add the peppers or mushrooms. I let the rolls rise for a couple of hours (because I had to go out and at the 30 min  mark they still hadn't risen as much as I would have liked) and then sprinkled with a little more cheese before I baked them. I put them in the freezer and pull one out daily for my daughter's lunch. They freeze very well and are thawed by lunch time. Next I'm going to try making these with ham and swiss (sans the pizza sauce). I think this is a great base idea and you could put whatever "toppings" suit your taste. Great recipe and much easier than I thought!

I didn't use the dough recipe (I used Jays Signature Pizza Crust) but used the method. I did some as regular pepperoni pizza rolls and the rest with the "supreme" filling.  I loved the idea and will use the pizza roll concept for a different twist.

This recipe was excellent, I did change things around a little bit, I simplified it a little bit. I didn't use the onion mixture as we aren't fans of a lot of onions, and I didn't have time, I was making it as a fast meal and so I just stuck to the basics. I don't have a bread machine so I just used a kitchen aid mixer. I also was pressed for time so I didn't have time to let them rise for the 30 min. and they still turned out great.   I put sauce and mozz. cheese and pepperoni on one, and sauce, cheese, and sausage on the other. Everyone in the family loved them. Thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious!  Don't discard the end pieces; that would be such a waste.  Do use a rectangular pan with high sides. Serve with pizza sauce for dipping.

DBF is a vegetarian, so I left out the pepperoni.  To test out the recipe, I halved it this first run.  The dough was difficult to knead, but that may have been due to my mods.

Mods: Replaced shortening with olive oil.  Added a quarter teaspoon of garlic powder to the dough.  Used 1/2 a cup of whole milk instead of milk powder and replaced the same volume of water.  I used a little more veggies.  Added three cloves of garlic in with the peppers and onions.  Mushrooms were diced and cooked first, then the other veggies were added.  No olives used.
