Made as is, no changes. I wish I'd made a recipe and a half because I know we would have liked seconds. Really awesome rub! EDITED: This is now our go-to rub for both pork and chicken. I actually mix the dry ingredients in bulk. I just quadruple the recipe, throw the dry spices into a Ball jar, slap a lid on and shake until the rub is uniform in color. Then, I just use as much as I like on my meat, slather on a little barbeque sauce and let it marinate.

Sandy, I don't know how you came up with this combination of ingredients but you sure have a winner here! Anything I could say to praise these chops would be understated and inadequate. Hubs is the unrivaled grill MASTER, and that certainly helped. And we used thick Porterhouse chops that couldn't have been more tender or juicy. But this rub/marinade took them over the top! Hubs is pretty darn stubborn when it comes to grilling and generally prefers no marinades. However, tonight he said, "Now THIS I like!" I left out the cayenne, used fresh, minced garlic rather than the dried, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. Glad I did, because it was perfect just as is! These are distinctly flavored, but not overbearing - just enough seasoning and spice to enhance the flavor of the meat, which is as it should be. I can see how this seasoning blend would be delicious too, on chicken and fish. Loved this!

Perfect grilled pork chops!  I followed the recipe exactly - no changes at all, none necessary. The rub gives the chops a ton of flavor. What's nice about this recipe is you don't have to marinate the pork for hours so this is great if your're short on time. I just might take the advice of the submitter and try this on chicken.  Great recipe!

Delicious!!! I left out the cornstarch and used less BBQ sauce, but other than that, pretty much followed the recipe to a T.  Make sure to use a BBQ sauce that is somewhat low in sugar, and this produces some pretty  healthy chops!  Thanks!

We made these last night on the gas grill, very very good. Pork was tender, used 1 1/2 in thick center cut pork chops and Budweiser BBQ sauce. I marinated only 4 hours and still could taste the flavor all the way through. Will marinate over night next time. Only spice I didn't have was onion powder, bet they're even better with that.

Great marinade!  Nice change from the same old barbecue sauce or the (awful in my opinion) teriyaki marinades.  Nice flavor without being overpowering.

Amazing these are so good.  It was a great way to add tons of flavor with out salt and fat.  When I made these I did not have BBQ or lemon but they were wonderful with out it.  On another note I made extra the second time around and chopped up the meat and made chili with it my family loved that also.  Thanks again.

Very tastey.  My kids ate the entire chop as they normally would only eat the centre.  I used chops from Costco which are much thicker.  I would use a thinner one in the future as the increased grilling time was not good for the rub/coating. Still, delicious!

I made these chops last night for supper.  I did exactly what the recipe called for when it comes to the spices.  I did not have lemon, so I just used the BBQ sauce only.  I put them in the fridge overnight so the flavors could really come together.  It's too cold here to grill yet, so I started these on the stove and then finished them in the oven.  They were great!  So much flavor!!

While we enjoyed the flavor of these very much, our thick bone-in pork chops were not as moist as they are when we brine them before grilling.   Chipotle pepper instead of cayenne and Â¼ teaspoon each of sweet paprika and smoked paprika were the only changes made to the rub/marinade and it was perfect.  Next time I will brine for a few hours, marinade for a few hours, and then grill away.  Served with my personal recipe for grilled potato casserole and french style green beans, these chops were the highlight of a quick and easy meal good enough to serve to company.

These were just ok in my opinion.  I expected so much more because they smelled divine on the grill, and while they weren't bad.... they just weren't GOOD either.  Could just be a matter of preference, who knows?

This was a last minute idea to go with mexican corn salad that I made, turn out to be sooo good. I made just as is and it was good. Next time I will let marinade a little longer, but it was still good!

Awesome pork chops, one of our favs., I like the way it burns a bit on the grill, adds more flavour for me that way.  Will try on chicken next time as another reviewer mentioned.

Wow! I didn't know what to expect because it seemed like an odd combination of ingredients, but it was great. My husband raved about them. And prep was very easy. If you use low-carb bbq sauce, this is a great low-carb entree!

I made this for friends on the grill and got RAVE reviews.  Everyone loved them!  I didn't change a thing -- I used thick boneless porkchops and that's always a good start.  I'm making it again this weekend for my family and I'm back to print out the recipe again because I had to give it away the first time!  Yummm.

Moist grilled chops, but too much of a taco taste for us. Not sure if we'd make again. They weren't bad, just not what we were expecting.

Loved it!  Made exactly as stated.  We were going to grill them but it got cold and ugly out so threw them on a grill pan on the stove.  They turned out wonderful.

these were okay.  One family member loved them, one didn't like at all and the rest thought they were just okay. I think I may have grilled them too long as they were a little dry.  Still not sure I'd make again since no one was wowed by the flavor.

Great option for BBQ'd pork chops.  I especially like having to only marinate for a short time. The pork chops turned out very tender.  Followed the recipe as close as possible but was out of cumin (which I think would have made it better) so substituted some cinnamon and marsala spice in place of it.  Will definitely re-stock my cumin and will try again.  The cooking temp and time was exactly right!

Awesome! Delicious on the grill. Marinated almost all day which helped blend the flavor all the way through the meat.

Terrific grilling recipe! An easy rub followed with bottled BBQ sauce, this was a perfect weeknight grilling recipe.  I followed the directions to a "t" and this was delicious.  Will do many more times this spring and summer, for sure.  Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe Sandy.

Great recipe!!! Easy and tasty.  Melt in your mouth pork chops.  I think I might try a less sweet bbq sauce. This needs more of a smokey flavor rather than honey flavor.

I will never cook a pork chop another way....it might be 40 below outside and I'll still go out to grill these
  They r that good.  I didn't have minced onion so I used onion powder. Super yummy. My 2 year old girl ate half a chop.  Thanks for our new "go to" recipe.

Southwest Summer Pork Chops' Haiku: "Dry rub is the stuff! I'd make it just to jar up. Chops were good with it." Not sure how I felt about the BBQ sauce/lemon juice addition to the pork chops, but the spice blend for the rub was terrific, and I'll probably mix some in an old babyfood jar just to have on hand. I'll eat a pork chops simply grilled w/ EVOO, S&P (as long as it's a decent cut and not over-done to shoe texture) so this was a nice way to have a Spring evening grilled pork chop w/ a different, punchy taste.

I grilled these tonight and my husband couldn't get enough of these! I don't care for bbq sauce so I omitted it on my chop and it was delish as well! This recipe will be used many, many times at our house. Thanks!

*EDIT* I used thick, boneless chops.  Because they were so thick I grilled them for 9 minutes on each side. They turned out very moist. If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would! :)

I wanted to like this.  It sounds like it should be really good and it was just average.  There was nothing that gave it any real zing.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't very good.

Great flavors! I was excited to finally try this...its been in my recipe box for awhile. I used boneless pork chops and ended up marinating the pork overnight (skipped the lemon juice, as I didn't want it to affect the meat). They were so tasty! Such a quick dinner and went really well with just a garden veggie salad! I don't have a grill (condo life...) so I just did on the stove-top and thought it worked wonderfully. Can only imagine how amazing they'd be grilled!

Not a bad recipe, not great either.  When I think of Southwest, I think spicy.  Don't be afraid to add seasoning to your taste.  I like a little zip.  So I will add more spice next time.  Be careful on the grill with the BBQ sauce.  It has a tendancy to char quickly.  Will try again.  Thanks

The spice rub/marinade definitely earns 5 stars.  I only had 1 hour to marinate and I think these would benefit from a longer marinating time even though the recipe states 1 to 2 hours.  The flavor was there but a bit shallow.  I would recommend a minimum of 2 hours.  I will make these again, but I am going to try a longer marinating time,

I prepared this savory type of spice rub just as the recipe listed, letting the chops sit overnight. When grilling, the flavors smelled amazing! The neighbors were poking their heads over the fence asking what was for dinner.
The flavor was wonderful and zesty, however the texture was VERY DRY. Always the one to improvise, I put together a type of "aus jus" style sauce to cut and dip the chops in.  It was made from a splash of chicken broth, barbecue sauce, worcestershire, and Red Hot. When we cut the chops and lighty dipped each bite, it made this recipe PERFECT!

These are delicious! I didn't have all the spices so I just used what I had. The BBQ sauce and lemon juice is perfect, and doesn't bury the spices. I overcooked these just a tad, maybe 9 minutes per side. Next time I will go with 7 minutes per side. 
Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious, tender and juicy pork chops.  They were bold and full flavored.  We will definitely make again.

Amazing. I used ketchup and 1 tbsp of brown sugar instead of BBQ sauce and 2 tsp onion powder instead of onion flakes.

Adequate pork chop, but too much cumin.  Had to pull out the bbq sauce at the table to give it a better flavor.  Wasn't sad that I made it, just wont be making this recipe again.

Love this recipe!! It is excellent as-is. I didn't have any lemons when I made it the second time, so I used red wine vinegar. Still turned out great!

I made this recipe for my husband who is pretty picky with pork and he thought it was wonderful. He actually started guessing which spices i used. I made this also at my labor day bbq and it was a big hit.

Uh, I was disappointed in these. I thought for sure there would be TONS of flavor there, but there was not and I marinated them overnight. I guess I was just expecting more...Thanks for sharing. :)

Very good! My schedule didn't really allow me to only marinate for 1-2 hours, so I rubbed and sauced them down this morning before work and let them hang out in the fridge all day. Great flavor! Thanks :)

Very good, I added a little extra garlic and a little less cumin. Next time I will rub with butter then dry rub.

These chops came out delicious... The only thing negative I can say is that the cumin flavor was a little too powerful.  I will definitely make these again & I'll just cut down or omit the cumin...  Thanks for the recipe...

I didn't use the cornstarch. I added adobo all purpose seasoning, and it was GREAT!

I was looking for an easy recipe for pork chops on the grill and didn't have alot of time.  I marinated for only an hour and a half, but they were very good.  Next time I will marinate over night.  My family loved them.

The rub added a nice flavor, but we dipped our bites in more BBQ sauce.  I decreased the cumin slightly because I don't care for it.

These pork chops are so simple and delicious!  I used very thick (1 1/2 inch) chops and grilled them.  They did turn out a little dry -- maybe I need to check the accuracy of my meat thermometer!

These were pretty good...definately a strong "southwestern" flavor. My family thought they tasted like taco meat. I used fresh minced garlic and fresh minced oregano and only marinated about 1 hour, but still had strong flavor.

These were quite delicious.  I followed the recipe as written, only I marinated the chops overnight.  They were juicy and full of flavor when done!

While decent, the rub/marinade did not flavor the chops as much as I expected.

These pork chops were delicious. I didn't have dried onion or garlic, so I just minced fresh onion and garlic and used those in the rub. It worked just fine. I also only let it marinate for about half an hour and the flavor was really good. I'll definitely be making these again!

The only thing I did differently, was marinate the pork chops for about 5 hours. These were good, but kind of bland. We ended up topping them off with more BBQ sauce for added flavor.
