Boy does this bring back memories...  This is a great updated healthier version of a childhood favorite and using whole wheat pizza dough is a great option. Not only is it fun to make, but fun to eat! I always use a bundt pan sprayed with Pam for baking so everything comes out with ease. I add the optional nuts and raisins along with 1 tsp. of vanilla to the butter and brown sugar mixture. When it's done, just invert the whole thing onto a plate and get out a ton of napkins!
