Should be corrected: this recipe is specifically for gingerbread houses as it is, like the other reviewer stated heavy and hard, but as you would think walls should be. I would find a chewier recipe for cookies, but for gingerbread walls, roof and other structures, this is perfect: )

I don't like to give any recipe a bad review, but since I myself rely on the comments of others I feel I have no choice.  I made this exactly as the recipe said, and I used a cookie stamp that I have on 1" balls. The cookies are tasteless, heavy and not sweet enough, nor is there enough spice to give credit to the name.  They have hardened, and won't even soften with 'dunkin' in tea or coffee.  Will definetely never make these again.  Sorry Maura, this one just didn't cut it for me.

This is my favorite gingerbread recipe for making gingerbread houses! I've tried several other recipes and they're either too sticky or too crumbly. This one is great for detailed carve-outs, too. Thanks!

This was great using my molds, but, I used butter instead of shortening.  The taste is better but you need to work hard at getting it out of the mold.  Still it tasted great with the glaze I made. These are ginger Cinnamon Shortbread cookies.

As stated, this is a recipe for making decorations, not for eating!  And for it's purpose it is great!  I used it to with a star cookie cutter to make ornaments for my tree, and they're very sturdy. Thank you!

Well I changed the recipe dramatically because I needed to triple it for my daughters birthday party and didn't have enough molasses and than I accidentally added powdered sugar(the flour bin and powdered sugar bin are really similar :} ) By tripling it I was able to eek out 9 mini houses. It tastes fine and was very easy to work with! I will be putting the houses together tomorrow and the girls will decorate at the party!

This recipe worked great for our house.  This was my first gingerbread house, just what I needed.  Just be sure you cook it long enough, comes out nice and stiff when you do, we added a few mins to our cooking time.  Not to eat obviously, it wouldn't taste good, we used McCormicks recipe for making men, it's outstanding.

I added a teaspoon of baking powder and it was lighter. I hadn't read the reviews to know it was for construction. Next time for cookies I'd use the Fannie Fparmer recipe.

This is my favorite recipe for gingerbread houses. This has been part of our holiday tradition for 3 years now. It bakes up very hard and sturdy. I believe it would not be good for eating. LOVE it for our houses :)

I hate to give this recipe a bad rating because they are actually quite good, they just aren't gingerbread cookies.  They are closer to molasses cookies in taste and ginger snaps in crispiness.  If you listed this recipe as "Crispy molasses cookies" it gets 5 stars.
