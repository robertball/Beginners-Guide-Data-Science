I rate this recipe a 4, because it was a good start but I felt it needed more. I made the following changes.  I used a left over ham bone and cooked that in half water/half chicken broth and cooked for 1 hr.  Then added veggies, beans and spices (added garlic) and cooked another hr and then removed ham bone and added ham pieces along with 4 chopped potatoes.  

I let this cook pretty much all day.  I didn't mash the beans since it cooked all day it thickened up nice especially with the starch from the potatoes. It had a nice smoky ham flavor.  It was even better the next day

This is my first attempt at homemade soup and it came out fantastic! I made changes as others suggested though, used low sodium chicken broth instead of water, added celery and minced garlic to the carrot-onion saute', I used dry beans that I soaked over night, and didn't bother mashing any. I cooked this covered for about two hours. My husband could not stop raving about this recipe, will be making again!

Ham & Bean soup is my husband's favorite, and I've never made it for him until yesterday when I made this recipe.  This soup is divine!  I doubled it as I wanted leftovers, and I bet it tastes even better today!  
Some changes I made; used chicken broth for half of the water called for, added some fresh minced garlic with the onions and carrots.  I added a couple drops of hot sauce and simmered it for about 2 hours so all the flavors could blend.  Thanks for a great recipe!  And it's easy too!

We enjoyed this dish very much... once I tweaked it to our taste. I added minced garlic & ham hocks to the soup & let it simmer for about 2 hours. This made it much more flavorful.

We really enjoyed this fast, hearty soup.  I did use chicken broth instead of water, but next time I would use half water and half broth.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This was a good and very easy recipe. I only used one can of beans and kept them whole, then thickened the soup with instant potato flakes. That added some extra flavor, but it was still a little bland. I ended up using 1/2 water and 1/2 chicken broth, and had to add some spices. But, this is a good springboard for a tasty soup.

Fantastic recipe for when you need a hearty soup don't have the time to boil the beans.  I made this triple the recipe to use all our leftover Thanksgiving ham and it took about 10 minutes.  My family loved it and the leftovers were even better.  It is so simple that you safely alter it however you desire to meet your own preferences.

This is an excellent soup & so easy to make.  The only thing I did different was add garlic while cooking the onions & carrots.  Also the serving are way off, I doubled the recipe & there is no way it would that it was 12 servings.

I just  made this for dinner it was YUMMY! I sub'ed in some chicken broth like some of the other reviewers suggested, added about a 1/4 c. chopped celery, and used some cooked cubed pork roast instead of the ham cause that's what I had. After sauteing my vegies and meat I added the liquid, brought to a boil, then poured it into my crockpot. I let it cook for an 1 1/2 hr. Will definatly be making this again soon! Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm cutting back on my food intake (the holidays really mess me up) so it was nice to make something that tastes great and isn't too high on the calorie mark.  I doubled this recipe and used 4 cups of liquid total.  I had a cup & a half of some chicken broth in the freezer so I used that and the rest was water. I let this simmer (covered) for two hours on the stove which made it taste just as good the 'first day' as the delicious leftovers.

This is an awesome "Homestyle" version of white bean and ham soup. the only things i changed was to make my own stock from a Ham bone, which added alot of flavor. while I was making the stock I threw in some carrotts, celery, Garlic and Onion and let it cook for about 8 hours. Then I strained everything out and followed the recipe exactly. I used canned beans just like the recipe as well which were pretty good but I have a feeling that using dried beans would have made it better.

My favorite soup!  Discovered after we had leftover Easter Ham and now we make all the time in giant batches and freeze the leftovers.  Freezes and defrosts really well!  Very cozy and satisfying.

This soup comes together so quickly and easily.  I used left-over Easter ham, chopped baby carrots, and half water/half chicken broth.  I also thought it would require no salt, but ended up using 3/8 tsp. instead of 1/2 tsp.  It was pure comfort food, especially since I served it over cornbread.

Easy and good, but unlike other soups, it did not get more flavorfull overnight. Started the broth with ham bone and chicken broth and bay leaves, a lot of the ham flavor cooked out. Added some black-eyed peas for new years day luck.

How in the world can this make 6 servings? I followed the recipe as it was laid out and it only made 3 servings for my family. The soup was ok but I felt it had too much carrot. If you make this recipe I suggest you double it if you expect 6 servings.

This is a really good and hearty soup. I took the advice of other reviewers and used chicken stock instead of water, added an extra can of beans, and some garlic. I also let it simmer on the stove for about 2 hours. I never mashed the beans, but from stirring some mashed. I made this soup and sandwiches for dinner tonight and the soup could have been a meal in itself. will be making again!

I threw all this into the slow cooker.  My husband and kids loved it.  I thought it was ok, but I think it's just personal preference, not that anything was wrong w/ the recipe.  Quick and easy dinner.

I made this using the recommendations for change including, garlic, potatoes, celery seed and chicken broth.  I used dried navy beans and a ham hock.  In addition I added a can of evaporated milk to the finished product and let it simmer a few more minutes.  My entire extended family loved this and asked when I planned to make it again.

I have made this as written a few times before. Its really good it doesn't seem to make that much soup. (or me and my bf really pig out on it) I decided to try dried GN beans last night. I did a quick soak on the beans and cooked them according to the pkg (don't over cook, it says it takes 1 1/2-2hr. my beans were done in about 45 min.) I doubled this recipe (i used the entire 1lb bag of cooked beans), i eyeballed the carrots. I sauted the carrots and onion for awhile then added the ham and sauted together for about 5-10 mins. THen I added the rest of the ingredients and add 4 chicken bouillon cubes. I didn't add any salt, or the bay leaf, and i added black pepper to tasted . I simmered the soup till the carots were softened. This turned out to be probably the best ham and bean soup i made. It turned out the closest to the one my mom used to make when i was little.

I am always looking for more soup recipes as my   kids love it, thank you! In order to make it more   nutritious, I add a few slices of jamoniberico de   bellota  - aka iberico ham or patanegra- thinly cut.   Because iberico has a strong and delicious flavor you   do not need much, only 50 grams or 1.8 OZ for four   people added once the soup is finished. You can buy online jamoniberico, visit   BuyJamon.com  BuyJamon.com the market place for iberico   ham.

This is some serious comfort food. Yummy. I served it with corn muffins. I did use chicken broth in place of the water and after I cut all the ham off the bone I put it in too. I simmered for about two hours then removed the bay leaves and bone. I did not add any salt as there was plenty from the broth and ham. I would recommend tasting before just adding salt. There may already be enough. This was very flavorful and I loved it. My young children however didn't really care for it.

I have made this too many times to count and can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet. It's awesome. The only negative thing I would say would be that the servings saying '6' is optimistic at best. I double the recipe and maybe get 6-8 servings, and that's one bowl per serving.

Rating the second time 2/15/09:  I made this again exactly as recipe directs (with water, no potato).  Oh my gosh, was it ever salty!  It was so salty, I couldn't eat it!  I think the problem is the quality of the ham I have used.  Store-bought hams are so inferior to mail-order hams or farmer's market hams.  What a shame.  This recipe would be perfect for us otherwise.  REVIEW FROM 2/2008: My boyfriend loved this and we had as a meal with bisquits.  I used extra ham and 2 full cans of chicken broth rather than just 2 1/4 cups.  This way I don't have to freeze the remaining broth.  I added one cubed russet potato to compensate for the extra broth, did not add any additional salt and let the soup simmer for 3 hours after bringing to a boil.  The soup was fine, but I found it salty.  Definitely use low-sodium broth!  Next time I make this, I would add up to 3 potatoes if you use 2 full cans of low-sodium broth.  The recipe is average but it is quite suitable for a weeknight menu when you are short on time.

This is a great fast soup, I used 3 cans beans 3 cups water 2 chicken bouillon cubes, added celery,3 Tbsp brown sugar, 1/4 cup cider vinegar and a few dashes of worcestershire.  I love the zippy flavor that stuff adds.

This soup is awesome and easy to make. I used most of the suggestions other people gave: subbed chicken stock for water, added minced garlic and a splash of hot sauce. I also added some Old Bay and put in some chorizo in addition to the ham. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was good and simple with leftover ham and cooked beans from the freezer. It was plain in flavor but I wouldn't go all the way to bland but I expected that from the ingredients. I ended up adding a stalk of celery and saved the salt for the table. Just the type of simple recipe I have been looking for since I only make it when I have leftover chopped ham, not bones/hocks. Servings are relative but we got two dinner and two lunch portions with no accompaniments.

Nice easy soup recipe.  I preferred using chicken broth, for more flavor, and also added garlic, celery seed, and hot sauce based on my family's preferences.  The serving size was NOT correct, as this only yielded about 4 servings.  (But we ate this soup as our main dish, with a side salad)  Next time I will double the recipe.

After having made some of the changes suggested this turned out phenomenal. I like easy cooking and this was it. It was delicious and after tasting it I told my husband that we would be getting no more of it. I was not willing to share with even him. I will definitely be making this again.

So delicious. Only difference I made was using chicken broth instead of water. I added some garlic powder too. Really good. Next time I will make double this recipe so we can have leftovers.

I agree with others it needed a little more flavor.  I added chicken broth, 1/2 c. celery & 2 garlic cloves, and a couple shakes of hot sauce.  I used a left over ham bone too and let it simmer from a few hours. It was wondeful!! Thank you for this great basic soup.

This was okay, but too plain for us - even after adding several cloves of garlic, some celery, a couple of boullion cubes, and some herbs. Judging from the amount of great reviews though, I think it's just my family's taste...

Made this last night and it was good...but it seemed to be missing a little something.  Bacon?  My husband and 4 year old liked it enough, but my twin 2 year olds wouldn't eat it.  Definitely double the recipe if you want to feed more than a few people.  The only changes I made were using half broth and half water, and I added garlic.  I love that this recipe is healthy and I will make it again!

Thanks Bissy.  Great easy recipe, and nutrious too.  But took other reviewers suggestions and added (fresh) garlic and a chicken boullion cube.  Next time I might add a potato to give it a thicker consistency and mabe celery to get my daily serving of a green vegetable.

Very good soup!  I used 3 diced carrots, 3 ribs of celery, 3 minced cloves of garlic, 1T parsley.  Used no butter or salt.  I used a can of chicken broth and water to make 2 1/4 cups.  Didn't cook anything just threw it into the crock pot on low.  Didn't mash any beans.  My husband put hot sauce in his.  A real keeper for sure.

This is sooooo good! This recipe is wonderful as is, but I've made some minor changes over time.  I don't mash the beans.  I sub chik broth for half of the water.  I sometimes thrown in a can of corn for my kids.  We love it!

This was good, but I made some changes - subbed stock (ham, but chicken would do) for the water, sauted the onions in olive oil rather than butter, left out the bay leaf (only because I use it to make my stock), and left out the second can of beans (don't care for them too much). Will definitely make it again. My major complaint was that it is only 4 servings not 6 (and we are not big eaters) - which is not a problem because I was making it for 4 people but would have had a problem if I had scaled down the recipe that way.

This was my first attempt at Ham and Bean soup and it was amazing. I doubled my recipe by mashing 2 cans of beans and used 2 full cans of beans. I had a left over ham bone which I simmered for about an hour in the chicken broth. I will not use as many chicken broth cubes the next time it did turn out a little salty and there was enough salt being pulled out from the ham. I used olive oil to saute my veggies. I did not have white pepper but I think it turned out fine with regular black pepper.

Excellent hearty winter soup. Following others advice, I used chicken broth instead of water and also added celery and garlic to the vegetable saute. I doubled the recipe and added another can of beans. I added a ham bone I had left over while the soup simmered for an hour. Then cut the meat off of it and simmered for another hour. I will be making this again! Thanks!

Wow...so good!  My husband has never cared much for bean soup, and he just had a second bowlful.  I always thought you had to soak dry beans, and wait 'til you had a ham bone to make bean soup "right," but this recipe proves that wrong!  Only changes I made were to add some celery to the onion/carrot saute, and I used olive oil instead of butter.  I also subbed chicken broth for the water.  I didn't even bother to mash the beans...and it was just awesome.  I served it with the "Homesteader Cornbread" on this site, and it was a great meal.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Very good recipe!  I added a can of white kidney beans and used stock made from the ham hock instead of water.  I also decreased the salt (since the ham was already salty), added 1 tbsp black pepper, 1/2 tbsp cumin, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, and a pinch of dill.

Delicious.  I added a bit of celery and garlic to the vegetable saute and cooked it with a leftover ham bone from one of those spiral honey hams.   Let it cook for about an hour and then removed the bone and added back the meat from it.  Then I added the canned cannellini beans (what I had on hand).   I pureed a bit of the soup to thicken it and the carrots gave it a mild golden color.  Absolutely delicious.  One note - if you use a honey-ham bone like I did, you may find the soup a bit sweet.  This can be corrected by a splash of vinegar.

This was excellent!!  I had a leftover ham on the bone so I cooked it in a pressure cooker until it was falling off the bone.  Meanwhile I sauteed the veggies adding 2 ribs of celery and some garlic.  Then I removed the bones and defatted the broth.  Added the veggies to the ham broth and the beans and let it all simmer for a bit.  I left out the salt as the ham made it plenty salty for my taste.  When I make this again I will probably add one more can of beans.  Served it with cornbread sticks and had a delicious, easy to prepare dinner.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I never made bean/ham soup before so, I thought this was a great jumping off place.  I used stock I had made form ham hocks and the meat I got from them so, I found I really did need the salt.  I also added celery, garlic, a little rosemary, some worchestire sauce and some liquid smoke.  I love the creaminess the mashed beans gave it and over think this was prefect recipe for what I wanted.  Thanks!!

Be sure to read the comments. This soup was very good, in part because I added things as others suggested: omitted the salt, added garlic, a dash of rooster sauce, a dash of worcestershire, and maybe 1/3 cup of tawny port (I wanted sherry, but was out). The soup was great, silky and not too salty. Maybe next time I'll use a bit of smoke flavoring as well. Definitely will make this again. Great use of leftover ham.

Turned out great BUT if you use chicken broth skip the salt. Ham has enough salt. If it needs salt add it when you serve it. I also threw in a vegetable bullion cube and used two celery stalks too.

Very delicious recipe even though it is very simple.  We used chicken broth instead of water and added a little more beans and chicken broth.  I am definitely making this again!!

This was so good!  I had a ham bone so I threw that in also and some frozen green beans.  I made mine in the crockpot rather than on the stove.  I really enjoyed it, it was very filling and perfect comfort food.

I added garlic and celery to the original recipe, also did half water and half low sodium chicken broth. I took this to work for lunch and everyone said it looked and smelled delicious. A great way to use up our leftover Christmas ham.

This soup was excellent!  I made the recipe as written with the exception of the bay leaf, didn't have that on hand so I skipped it.  Also added some chicken broth for more flavor.  Came out wonderful and everyone enjoyed it.  Makes a hardy, comforting meal!

Living in the Netherlands, I sometimes crave some foods from home. Was craving this soup and it hit the spot! Like some others, I used chicken broth instead of water. Loved it!

This soup was very good, but needed a bit more liquid. I let it simmer a bit waiting for family to come home and I had to add more water.  I put a bit of garlic powder in it at the beginning of the cooking process.  I baked some corn bread to serve with it - Yum.  It was pefect.

Since the economy has been so great I've become a househusband so the cooking I've taken over to relieve stress from the Mrs. I grew up with Ham & Bean soup and loved my mothers. I did the suggestion of using broth rather than water and let it cook fro 2 hours. This soup came out almost exactly as I remember my mothers  Will definitely make again. Leftovers were better than the freshly cooked.

I added butter beans instead of great northern beans and chicken stock instead of water and it was an excellent dish.  It did not seem to be six servings though... Perhaps three?  I cooked it about 2 hours so maybe I cooked it down a bit...

Great soup!  I doubled the recipe, used 1 lb of dried white beans soaked and cooked the night before. As others suggested I added celery and garlic to carrots and onions and used chicken broth.  I also added a ham bone when I added the broth, additional chopped ham, seasonings and beans and simmered for about 1 1/2 hours. Knowing my husband and I love soup and are hearty eaters, I would say that doubling the recipe will probably give us two meals, with a little bit left over.  I will definitely make this again.

Wow! Fast, easy, hearty, and tasty!  I was leary, because we have always used dry beans, but my family all said,"This would even fool Grannie!!" I just didn't  have the time for the soak and the  simmering.  The only change I made was to add an extra can of beans (to the 1 mashed and 1 whole.) Try this recipe-- it's a great short cut!

This recipe was a wonderful base for a bean and ham soup.  I added 4 cups of chicken stock, instead of the water, and it fed our family of four.  Wonderful!

This is a good bases for a white bean "n" ham soup. I used dried beans vs. canned. My method was to bring the beans to a boil in a couple quarts of water then simmer for an hour.   After an hour, I threw in a couple of carrots sliced in half long ways, a quartered onion, a couple celery stalks sliced in half long ways, the herbs and double the spices the recipe called for, about 4 chicken bouillion cubes, a couple garlic whole cloves, and the ham hock. After an hour and a half on simmer, I tooks out the carrots, onion, garlic,  bay leaf, celery and the ham hock. I added fresh finely diced carrots, onion, celery, a couple smalled peeled and diced potatoes and garlic. I took the ham off the bone, made sure the ham was in small pieces, and threw it back in the pot and simmered for another half an hour.   I guess all I used the recipe for was the spices which I had to use a bit more than double since this method made so much soup. In retrospect this review may not be so applicable to this actual recipe. However, our soup was extremely good and now my husband is convienced I should cook a ham at least once a month since we get so many meals out of it. I'm thinking maybe 6 times a year. ;) My ham was from this site's Honey Glazed Ham recipe.

My husband and I love this recipe. I would pull the bay leaf out after about an hour or it can be overwhelming- especially if you are like us and reheat and eat this for serveral days. I also like to add celery and potatoes to mine to make more of a stew. It is wonderful!

Great but of course, I had to add to it.  I added celery in with the carrots and onions, worchestershire, galric, smoke flavoring, and I used a can of Rotel mild chilies and tomatoes.  Vegetable broth instead of the 2 cups of water and cooked it all together for 2 hours like some other's did.

This is a good soup base, but I had to add ingredients to give it more flavor. I added cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, rosemary, and sweet smoky paprika. I used chicken broth instead of water, and I added a can of chicken breast and cut back on the ham. Served with grilled cheese sammies--warmed us up on a cold winter night!

My husband loooves this soup, he asks for it all the time. I tried spicing it up more, but it was too much. All you need is the taste of the beans, onions, and ham. It's a great soup and the only thing I would change is using a little bit of broth in place of the water.

Even though I read the reviews saying this recipe needs more ingredients, I wanted to try it "as is" before deciding if it needs anything. I like simple recipes and if this soup is good without adding anything to it, then why add something? Each ingredient added just makes the meal that much more expensive. On the other hand, a meal's got to taste good. Anyway, I followed the recipe to the letter. I had one bowl of this soup and agreed with those who think this recipe leaves something to be desired. So my solution was to add a 15 oz can of crushed tomatoes and a teaspoon of dried parsley. Adding these 2 ingredients certainly improved the flavor of this soup. I may tweak this recipe quite a bit in the near future, but I can say that adding tomatoes and parsley was definitely a step in the right direction. I think I'll continue experimenting in this Italian vein and add garlic the next time I make this soup. My hope is that the soup would then be good enough to not merit any further improvements.

This soup was wonderful. It tasted like it would have taken much more effort to prepare. The only thing I did different was added 2 tsp. of Better Than Bouillon Chicken Base along with the water. I just added salt to taste at the end. I just like using that base in soups. It was something my whole family loved and it was easy and I will be making it again! Thanks!

A great basic recipe! I read that some reviewers added celery. If you want less veggies in you traditional Bean n' Ham soup, substitute the salt with Celery Salt. I put 2 large cloves of garlic through the garlic press and added that to the carrots and onion when I sauteed them.  Other changes: Chicken broth instead of water and 3 cans vs. 2 of the beans (1 1/2 mashed, 1 1/2 whole). Because I had the ham bone left over from Christmas Eve dinner, I added that to the soup and simmered for about 45 minutes for extra flavor.

With the fact of how easy this was and how good it is--I would give this soup more stars if I could. Have made this recipe twice in the last few days!!I'm not sure if "Cannellini" beans (white kidney) are the same thing as "Great Northern"beans but, I used cannellini because that's what was in my pantry. Turned out awesome with them! Added small amount of left-over green beans from Christmas dinner to the second batch. My husband loves this soup:)

A fantastic quick soup.  I sauted the onion and carrot with a little garlic then put it in the crock pot with the rest of the ingredients.  I used chicken stock instead of water, though, which made for a too salty result.  Next time, I'll use stock but leave out the additional salt. It was a warm satisfying meal for my family when we got home from our Christmas eve church service.  Will make again!

This was delicious!  I added a ham bone I had from Thanksgiving.  I also added a little liquid smoke and a little ketchup for more flavor.  I also added a little cornstarch at the end for a thickening agent.  Yummy!  Will make again!

i made this soup without the veggies.  i also cooked it in the slow cooker all day with the ham bone.  the ham had a honey mustard glaze on it from thanksgiving, so i added almost 1/4 cup of honey mustard, also.  it was pretty good, but not the best ham and bean soup i've ever had.

Good recipe as written. However if you don't make any other changes I think you MUST cook it longer. It needs time to get happy.   I also did the following: added sliced mushrooms and garlic to the sauteed veggies and omitted the water entirely. Instead I used mostly chicken broth and then threw in some white wine. Brought to a boil and then simmered for more than an hour. I could have cooked it longer and it would have been good. I'll be making this again, thanks.

I used soaked beans, added cayenne/chili flakes/celery ssed, and based on other raters' suggestion put in a couple smoked turkey necks for the first hour the soup simmered, then took them out for the second hour. It received rave reviews!

This has been an absolute staple this winter.  It all came from how to use ham leftovers I froze from Thanksgiving.  The ham was smoked, so it added a fabulous smokey flavor to the soup.  Anyway, these are the changes I think seem to make the best batch of soup - so good I always double the recipe and never have any left over.  First off, I make it in the crockpot and just leave it on low all day (or all night) whatever the case may be.  Next come my ingredient modifications - I use chicken broth instead of water, I use matchstick carrots (I just always have them on hand), extra white pepper, omit the salt (the ham is salty enough)and last but not least, I use 2 tsp of ground mustard powder.  I wish there were 6 stars, because I'd definitely give all 6 to this easy, inexpensive recipe!  LOVE IT!

I'm making this for tomorrow's dinner,  it is SOOO easy and wonderful. I leave it in the slow cooker on low about 8 hours and instead of ham I put kielbasa and it is wonderful also I use half chicken broth and half water. I have never thought of using canned beans though I always use dry beans, just soak them overnight if you can. I also serve this with hot cornbread and it is delicious.

I used the left over ham from Thanksgiving that had been seasoned with cloves and brown sugar.  I left out the carrots and bay leaf.  It was still great! The plan was to let it simmer for 2 hours as suggested by other reviewers, however, my son (home from college) smelled the delicious aroma and the soup didn't last any longer!

I searched for a quick and easy bean soup recipe that would be full of flavor--this one topped the charts!!!! My entire family loved it and I took some to my in-laws and they thought it was from scratch. It was very easy to make and not time consuming. Excellent flavor and hearty.

Great dinner or lunch!  I like to put all of the ingredients in the crockpot before I go to bed...ready when I wake up the next morning!  Only change- turkey ham.  It's great to freeze in individual sized containers for pack-and-go lunches.  Yum!

This recipe was a great way to use up some leftover turkey ham and baby carrots. The only thing I added was minced garlic. I also substituted half of the water for broth. Turned out nice for a quick supper.

This is a lovely, comforting soup. It is hearty enough for dinner when accompanied by warm cornbread (or garlic bread). It needs no modifications other than to perhaps cook a little longer so the flavors can really combine, the ham flavor is the star.

I made this recipe for my husband (who hates beans) on a cool fall evening. He loved it so much he took seconds and he has even requested it on other occasions.  I served it to a friend as well, and she requests it now whenever we have a potluck!!
