This recipe is easy, tastes great, and makes a good amount. Other stove-top and baked recipes make too much for my day-to-day needs. 

First time I completely forgot to stir while it was cooking. The liquid wasn't absorbed enough and there was a bit of a "crust" on the bottom of the rice cooker. Not too bad. I gave it a stir and pushed the lever to cook again. A few minutes later the lever popped and the polenta was ready to add the cheese. 

I do cheat a bit. Use 1 Tbls of butter or olive oil, dried onions, and garlic powder. I also add a splash or white wine or sherry. 

You can easily change out the type and amount of cheese used to fit your taste or alter to whatever your main is.

My rice cooker worked SO well! I used 1.5 cups of cornmeal and 3.5 cups of water. I let it cook and then stirred in cream cheese after it cooked. I stirred every 10 minutes. It took about 25 minutes to finish. I'm very happy with the results and will definitely to this again for quick and easy polenta!!!

Really good, will make again.  My rice cooker cooks too hot so I had to switch it to warm after the polenta came to a boil.  But it worked wonderfully.  We REALLY like cheese so I did end up adding twice as much as called for but that's our taste.  I also used a huge garlic clove which was a bit too much so next time I'll select a smaller one.

Excellent! My rice cooker runs hot so I kept a pretty close eye on it. I used a sharp cheddar and parmesan and followed the recipe.  i loved the flavor and the consistency.
