I doubled the black pepper and this came out perfect for me. The  brown sugar was a little to sweet for  me but I'm  certain it would be perfect for most people. This was surprisingly better than I had anticipated. If you love SPAM you should really give this one a try!

I just added some Maple syrup first, then as per the recipe.
Everyone at the Polo Club raved about the treat !!

Oh, and I sprinkled them with Grains of Paradise as well.
