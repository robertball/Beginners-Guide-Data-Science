I thought this was a little bland.  I added chopped fresh parsley and chicken seasoning for a quick fix.  Overall easy to make.

For some reason when I reduced the servings to 5 it doubled the penne pasta!!!!!!!  Unfortunately, although I knew it seemed too much I put it in.  However the taste was fantastic, like a turkey pot pie.  I will make again with the right amount of pasta.

I really liked this. I made it stovetop so I sauteed the veggies in butter before adding. Also added a little more seasoning. Will try again for sure!

This is my go-to basic soup recipe for using leftover turkey or chicken and whatever vegetables I have on hand.  I always add a few whole peppercorns to  my soups, too.  Corn and peas and cut up green beans work well, along with the carrots or in place of them.  Sometimes I use pasta, or else rice or potatoes, depending on what I have on hand. This recipe  is very versatile and you can get creative by adding garlic seasoning and a bit of red pepper flakes for a little kick.  A chicken buillon cube can be added too.  I make quite a few batches of soup during the cold months, and none of them ever turn out the same, but all have been excellent!

Overall, this soup was pretty tasty.  I would not cook the noodles with the broth in the crockpot next time though- they soaked up a lot of the broth and became mushy. I would definitely cook them separately next time.  Also, I added poultry seasoning to the chopped chicken and when finished, added Locatelli parmesan to the top of each serving, which seemed to be just the extra flavor that was needed (a little bland otherwise). It was really good- even my picky teenager had 2 bowls! Will be making again.

I thought that this recipe was pretty versatile.  I followed the recipe pretty closely but improvised on some ingredients (like the Basil and pasta noodles) and it came out very good.  Very hearty, delicious, and pretty easy to make.  I will certainly make this again when I have left-over Turkey (or Chicken).

I made it with the optional cream of mushroom soup. The soup came out creamy and delicious! However, next time I might try cook the cream of mushroom soup additional 15 minutes longer.

Great recipe, except ......
Cook the noodles separately  and ladle soup over them for individual servings. As a previous reviewer commented, the pasta/ noodles will be gummy mush if left in the pot for more than 15 minutes. Also, I recommend placing the (previously cooked) meat chunks in the slow cooker about 1/2 hour prior to serving - they'll stay intact and not shred as much but still have time to get hot.

2hrs for noodles? They were done in 20min after adding them. Whoever cooks the noodles for 2hrs is going to have disgusting mushy noodles.

Added frozen vegetables and more seasoning than the recipe calls for. Additionally, I made this using the remaining meat from the Christmas turkey carcass. It was great.

I'm presently making this, and it smells delicious.  I can't wait to try it.  The only changes I made are, I used 2 different Turkey loins.  1 was a cracked pepper loin, and 1 was a rotisserie loin.  I figured these would add more flavor.  I also used vegetable liquid stock, and the chicken stock from Hormel.  I can't wait to try this.  Also, I'm using garden vegetable noodles.
