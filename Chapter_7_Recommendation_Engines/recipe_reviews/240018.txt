Everything was cooked perfectly. Good base recipe, but I think next time I'll use roast instead of ground beef, and forgo the thyme. There was a flavor I didn't care for, and I think that was it.

A very nice change from the usual crockpot stews I make.  I did fry the ground beef with the onions prior to putting in the crockpot as I truly believe the flavor is enhanced.  Also added a couple of sticks of  chopped celery and can see mushrooms fitting in as well. I think one seasoning packet of each variety is also enough for the contents and no added salt.

I wanted to try a new stew recipe, but this recipe was not for me or my family. Too salty, too much like gravy

Turned out rather salty. I didn’t mind but the parents weren’t thrilled.

This stew was fantastic! Instead of using ground beef I used cubed stewing beef instead and just threw it all in. Definitely making again and again

It took me about 5 minutes to prepare before work and it turned out amazing.  The sweet potatoes mushed which made a great soup base while all of other veggies stayed in tact.  The kids LOVED it after a day of snow play.
