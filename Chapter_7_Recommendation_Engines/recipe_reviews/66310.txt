This cheesecake is awesome!  I added 3 oz. more cream cheese and 1 tbsp. of vanilla.  For the crust, I used 1 c. graham crackers and 1/4 c. chopped pecans.  I made some additional "crust" to press into the sides when the cheesecake was finished.  I also cooked the crust for 10 minutes at 325 and let it cool completely before adding the cream cheese/pumkin mixture.  Whenever doing a cheesecake - do a waterbath.  I cooked this cheesecake in a waterbath at 325 for one hour, turned the oven off and left it in there for one hour.  I then chilled it overnight.  Then proceeded with the maple pecan glaze.  No cracks, and it was completely done and very, very rich.

I made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving and it was a HUGE hit! I don't like pumpkin pie, and I'm not a huge fan of cheesecake either, but this was so so so good. Some of the reviews complained about the baking time, but I kept mine in only 10 minutes past what the recipe called for. Add a teaspoon of corn starch to the dry ingredients and it doesn't even crack! I had no problems making or adding the topping either, and it was absolutely necessary for the taste!! This was the first cheesecake I've ever made myself and it just went so well! So good, I'm making two for Christmas!!

I have made this cheesecake for years.  I'm not allowed to my family's holiday dinners without it!  I use a gingersnap crust instead of grahm crackers for a really interesting flavor.  Also, I don't make the walnut sauce for the top, it's just too rich for my taste.

Very good. I made this the night before, and had to reheat the sauce as it thickens up quite a bit when chilled. Next time, I will top the cheesecake with the sauce rather than serving it on the side...it is the best part and is essential!

This is a fabulous recipe I have used since five years ago when I bought an Eagle Brand book! I adjust the baking for a perfect, level uncracked top. Put it in a 300 degree oven for one hour, then turn off the oven for one more hour with the door open a crack. Wonderful!

I made this for Thanksgiving and between my husband, my son and I it was gone!!! I made a subsitution though because I only had 2 packages of creamcheese. Instead at the end I folded in a pint of whipped heavy cream. It turned out really well!

Elegant but easy dessert.  Maple glaze is superb.  Not a "typical" cheesecake so don't expect cheese flavor to dominate.  Better flavor blending if made a few days ahead; the maple glaze can be done easily a few hours before serving.  It says boil rapidly but I keep an eye on mine so it doesn't boil over (gets quite hot).  This is a great variation for your Thanksgiving dessert table.

Very tasty, but it seemed more like fluffy pumpkin pie than cheesecake.  Definitely better than pumpkin pie, but just didn't have the cheesecake taste that the Marbled Pumpkin Cheesecake (from this site) does.  The topping was excellent...just be sure not to boil it too long, or it will get so thick that it's impossible to spread.

This was nice for a change and very pretty, but I think overall I would just prefer plain old fashioned pumpkin pie!  As someone else said the texture is silkier and kind of like a mousse, and the maple flavoring is a nice touch...  At a potluck with about 60 people present I heard one person comment "this is truly DIFFERENT than plain pumpkin pie!", and there WERE some leftovers... but the pumpkin pie there was gone... LOL

Delicious!  To make this low carb, I made this without the crust and without the topping.  I replaced the sweetened condensed milk with 1 cup evaporated milk + 1/2 cup Splenda baking mix--heat until sugar dissolves.  I doubled the spices and baked in 4 ramekins..will definitely make again.

We love this recipe! We use gingersnaps instead of graham crackers and it gives it a great flavor. Our cheesecakes also sit in the fridge overnight which is great for the holidays because you don't have to make it the day of. we have even made it two days ahead with no detriment.

I made 2 of these pies for thanksgiving, one I brought to dinner and one I left at home for my slightly less social roommate. Everyone at dinner LOVED it and, even though it is a pretty rich pie, my roommate ATE THE WHOLE PIE IN ONE DAY!! He said he tried to save me a slice but just couldn't do it! Really great recipe!

I made this last year and it was possibly the best thing I've ever eaten!  I poured the glaze over the top after the cheesecake had cooled and it hardened into a fabulous, chewy layer.  Such a nice texture contrast to the luscious cheesecake.  I'm making four of these this year for friends.

my family just loves this cheesecake!! I almost had heart failure when I found out my husband threw it away by accident.. but thankfully for this website I have found it again. The only thing I found different is that my old recipe said that you could use 9x13 pan instead of springform pan.. I just may have to try it.

This was SOOOO yummy! It wasn't difficult at all to make and it tasted just like a pumpkin pie only lighter.  Really, really good.  I will now probably make this my "regular" at Thanksgiving instead of the pie.  And because it has the pecans in the sauce, it's like having your pecan pie too.  I promise you WON'T be disappointed in this cheesecake! Really, really good.

I am a terrible baker.  I used pre-made nilla wafer pie crusts, but the mix and glaze are out of this world.  This is one of the very few recipies that I don't need to modify to taste, and it is a huge crowd pleaser.  WONDERFUL!!!!

Freezes extremely well. Pour the cooled glaze over the cooled cheesecake. Freeze the cheesecake. Defrost in room temperature before serving. You may also freeze single servings: slightly freeze the cheesecake. Cut into serving size slices. Put cheesecake back in freezer. When fully frozen, separate each slice and wrap them individually.

I make this every year for Halloween and then I lost my recipe, which I found in a little commercial recipe book, . I am glad to have found it on here. It usually makes a couple of cheesecakes.

I made this for a christmas party.  It turned out great.  The only change I did was add 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  I thought the cake had plenty of flavor.  I put a pan of water under the cheese cake during cooking and then make sure to cut around the edges when the cake was done so it didn't crack.  I also let it cool on the counter for quite a while before refridgerating.

This will be a family favorite for years to come.  I'm a beginner baker and I'm happy to say the only change I made was baking it for 8-10 min. longer than the recipe called for and also added the cornstarch and got no cracking to speak of mine came out picture perfect and was very easy...even for a beginner like me!

It was good and looked great!  But it taste about the same as regular pumpkin pie.  Making the carmel with the maple syrup was a good idea though I might try some adjustments to bring out more of the maple and cheese cake flavors.

There is a lot of negative comments about this. Mine came out perfect, no cracks. I am wondering if maybe people are opening the oven. If you aren't using a water bath you CANT open the oven while cooking. At the end, turn off the heat, leave in oven with door cracked. Do not remove for at least an hour. Then remove and let cool to room temp before putting in fridge

Made this recipe, very slightly tweaked, for a class in culinary school and got rave reviews from all the chefs.  Tip: adding 1 tsp of cornstarch can help to keep your cheesecake from cracking!  For my crust, I used some day old Lebkuchen (German ginger-molasses cookies), but crushed gingersnaps would work well, also.  I also added some vanilla bean-infused bourbon to the cheesecake and the glaze - I am a Kentucky girl, after all!  I needed a little bit more cooking time because of the extra liquid I added.

made this recipe for thanksgiving and it was a spectacular hit! I didn't change a thing about the recipe, except for toasting the nuts in a dry pan before adding them to the glaze....roasting the nuts brings out the natural nutty flavour of the pecans. Would make this again times 100!

This was pretty good except I think I needed to roast the pecans first to get the perfect flavour. The end results really do look like this was professionally made!

I'm giving this recipe 4 out 5 stars because I just needed to use the cheesecake filling part of the recipe.You really couldn't taste the maple syrup,so I wouldn't suggest using this recipe if you're looking for a maple taste. Other than that it turned out great! Next time I'll try the maple glaze.

I made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving this year.  I did add a few extra spices as many reviews suggested and I think if I were to make it again I would follow the recipe exactly.  The extra spices made it too much like pumpkin pie in my opinion.  The glaze was to die for.  I thought it was good (considering I HATE ppumpkin pie and don't like cheesecake), but I did not recieve the compliments that I thought I would.  It was very rich and everyone seemed to think it was "good".  I may try a plain cheesecake and use this glaze (I could eat it out of a bowl on it's own;).

Excellent recipe! Everyone loved it. To put my own spin on the crust I used ginger snap cookies instead of graham crackers.

This was fantastic! That maple glaze is totally worth making. Because there's pumpkin in the mix, this easy cheesecake is more resistant to cracking and you don't have to do the crazy water bath or anything. And if it does crack a little, it's going to get covered up by the glaze anyway.   The spice blend is just right and it's not overly sweet. Rich, but not cloyingly so. I don't like graham crackers, so I used pulverized crumbs from Cinnabon cereal. The flavor was perfect, although, next time, I wouldn't add as much sugar since the cereal already has a lot. We also didn't add nuts because of allergies and they were not missed. This is a total keeper recipe!

I would give it 4.5 because I don't like pumpkin. But quite foolproof recipe. I think I overbaked a bit, yet, tasted great! Pumpkin cheesecake can't taste better :-)

Easy and very rich.  Yeah, mine cracked, but whatever--there's a topping, so really, who cares?  I tasted the pumpkin and while I supposed there is some pumpkin pie flavor in this, I don't agree that pumpkin pie is basically what it is.  It's very creamy, texture is different, and you can play around with this to make it more to your taste.  I used a mixture of cookie crumbs and chocolate graham crackers in the crust and it worked out beautifully.  I had to bake an hour and 30 minutes at 350 for this to be done.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it!!  My Mom gave it high praise and said she thought it was as good as the Cheesecake Factory's pumpkin cheesecake.  I used Ginger Snaps instead of Graham crackers as was suggested in the reviews and doubled the Maple Pecan Glaze.  Everything turned out beautifully except my glaze didn't thicken to my liking so I added some corn starch.  Will definitely make this again!

Awesome!!!  Followed recipe exactly and is delicious. I was a bit leery of the raisins but sweetness compliments the maple perfectly.  Be sure to use real maple syrup.  It is expensive but so worth it!!

I made with sweet potato bc my family is not big on pumpkin and it ended up being an acquired taste, I guess, some liked it, but it wasn't one of my favorites. The topping was extremely difficult to eat, cut and work with.

This was very good and VERY rich and dense.  Mine cracked, but the topping covered it up.

Absolutely delicious!! I used walnuts instead of pecans only because that was all I had, but other than that, I made this exactly as written. It was a huge hit at Thanksgiving!! I will definately be making this again and again.

This is always a fave at our family gatherings. It is suprisingly light and tastes amazing!! I didn't do the glaze but did homemade whipped cream instead. Fantastic!!

Absolutely superb!  Made this for the first time a couple of years ago and it was a hit then.  Decided to give it another try and it came out perfectly!

As another reviewer suggested I did put an oven safe dish with water in the oven with the cheese cake as it cooked.  No cracks!  Also its a good idea to use a knife around the edges of the cheese cake to separate it from the springform pan so that when it shrinks a tad it won't crack.

Excellent recipe!  Not for diabetics though!

I made this two years ago for Thanksgiving.  Last year I wanted to try a different pumpkin dessert.  My & my husbands’ family was not pleased!  So, tonight I'll be preparing this cheese cake for tomorrow's Thanksgiving feast.  It is FANTASTIC!!

For an interesting twist, I add white chocolate chips. It's a huge hit anytime of the year! Also for easy transport, I use the pre-made graham cracker crusts w/the lids. It usually fills about 3 of them.

I recently made one of these for Thanksgiving dinner with the inlaws. Everyone went absolutely nuts over it. Nuts! I almost felt bad that most of the other desserts other people brought remained barely touched if at all. This was all the rage. Weeks later they are still asking me about it. I did not put nuts on mine and using a heavy whipping cream for the maple glaze made all the difference. Add some Cool Whip extra creamy topping and you may end up getting mobbed.

I used low-fat cream cheese with great success. I will also explore ways to minimize cracking (which is covered by sauce, which is nice) next time, but for a first-time effort, I was pleased. Ran out of graham cracker crumbs so substituted plain "vanilla" type cookies. Worked great.

The texture was extremely mushy (not like cheesecake AT ALL) I even baked it longer than what I was supposed to. One comment on this website said to add cornstarch so it would not crack, which I did and it still cracked. The sauce was very runny and never thickened.  It did have a great flavor and definitly smelled fantastic coming out of the oven, but I would never make this again - what a mess!!!

Fantastic recipe! I have made this no less than 5 times.

This gets rave reviews from anyone whose ever eaten it. It has a very pronounced pumpkin taste so if you'd rather have this instead of a pumpkin pie, you'd be all set with your pumpkin indulgence for the holiday.

The topping does require a little watching as it sometimes takes awhile for it to thicken up. It's best to pour the topping when it's cooled a little into a plastic container; then when you arrive for dinner just warm it in the microwave and allow guests to add themselves.

Another suggestion: Put a little oven proof dish filled with water in the oven when baking the cheesecake. This prevents it from cracking.

This dessert will make you look good :)

Eh.  Will not make again.  I used a premade crust, just because it was easier.  The cheesecake itself was okay, but the sauce on top was horrible.  I made it according to the directions, etc, but I didn't care for it at all.  I'm looking for a new recipe.

I made this last night as a test recipe before serving it for Thanksgiving.  It was easy to make and had a much lighter and creamier taste then pumpkin pie.  The praline topping is fantastic.  I had no problem with the cooking time.  I give this 5 stars!!

This is the first cheesecake I've ever made -- it was very easy to make, and very yummy.  Next time I make it, I will bake it a little longer though - the 1 hour 15 min cook time I think was a little off.  Lots of smiles from this one!!!

This is a great cheesecake to have at Thanksgiving
inplace of a pumpkin pie. I made it without the glaze, because some of my family don't care for nuts. My husband even asked me to make this for his boss.

This was a big hit with my family!  I did substitute dark brown sugar for the white sugar in equal amounts.  I like the depth of flavor that brown sugar gives vs white sugar. Otherwise everything else was just as written.  I will definitely make again.

This turned out perfectly! I did add some vanilla, and baked it at 325° for an hour, and then turned the oven off and allowed it to stay in the closed oven for another hour. I didn’t make caramel sauce. I warmed a jar of  lates caramel in the microwave, transferred it to a mason jar, added a couple tablespoons of maple syrup and toasted pecans. It was great!

After making this a couple times, I really like it a lot.  The Maple Pecan topping is fantastic so I make a double recipe.  I use Fat Free cream cheese and condensed sweetened milk.  It was delicious.

For Thanksgiving this was a cheesecake that made the day! Very easy to make and a quick prep time. I suggest using an additional 2 oz of pumpkin to really have that pumpkin flavor and a half teaspoon more of cinnamon. I topped it with cool whip and drizzled the whole pie with caramel, then topped with chopped pecans. Yum!!

Have made it twice, turned out great both times. Didn't let the glaze thicken as much as the directions and was easier too drizzle  over the cheesecake by the piece. Some preferred it plain because the drizzle is very rich/sweet.

Just did a trial run on this. Tasted similar to pumpkin pie. I found the nutmeg overpowering and also thought it was too soft texturally even after 2 days in the fridge. I prefer a denser firmer cheesecake. 

I’m still making it for a gathering I’m going to this weekend. I plan on doing 1/2 tsp nutmeg and adding 1/2 tsp ginger this time.

I've made this twice now.  Once for Christmas several years ago and just this last Thanksgiving.  Both times it came out as good as any professional cheesecake I've ever tasted.  It is   very creamy and has a subtly sweet pumpkin spice flavor.  The sweet pecan topping really enhances the flavor.  This Thanksgiving, everyone from the fussy 9 year old to his 80 year old grandpa loved it.  In fact grandpa said it was the best he ever tasted.  I didn't have pure maple syrup, so I substituted regular syrup for the cake and 1/2 cup brown sugar for the frosting which made it thicker than the original, but spread very nicely over the top of the cake.  So technically, mine wasn't a "maple" flavored cheesecake,  but it was still amazing.

Exceptional dessert, but I had to tweak the cooking time on the glaze.  After 9 minutes (following the directions to a T,) I had caramel, not a glaze!  Luckily, I had 3/4 of a can of evaporated milk sitting on my counter that I grabbed, poured in, and hoped for the best.  I stirred constantly for about 5 minutes and ended up with a glaze consistency.  I will definitely make again, but with my changes.

Used slivered almonds in the glaze.  Used mashed squash instead of canned pumpkin.  Served with whipped cream.
Glaze was unusual and very yummy!

Absolutely a great addition to the Thanksgiving dessert table. I made the day before T-day, including the glaze. Zapped the glaze in microwave for about a minute once arrived at friend's house. Poured over cheesecake and was ready to serve. The maple flavoring is subtle, yet a nice touch. . My oven temp may be off, as I had to bake an extra 15 minutes for a more set middle. Also suggest placing spring form pan on cookie sheet to aid in getting in and out of oven.

I have made this recipe every thanksgiving and Christmas for the last 7 years, theres never any leftovers! I don't always add the nuts and usually I make the graham cracker crust go up farther on the sides of the cheesecake pan, but thats because I really like the graham cracker crust lol.  Other than that, perfection!

I followed the recipe, except for the graham cracker crust, I  used chocolate graham crackers instead of the plain ones.  Gave it a little more flavor. I also left the syrup and nuts on side, so that everyone can put there own on. Would definitely make it again.

This was good but I was a little disappointed with the final product, it definitely did not blow my socks off. I followed directions to the T and the cheesecake looked beautiful but if I'm going to splurge on a high calorie/fat food I want it to be incredibly delicious.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year and completely wowed my friends.  As some others have commented, I wound up baking the cheesecake for an additional 10 minutes.  Instead of using the maple pecan sauce, I chose to make a simple whipped cream which I used to "ice" the top and sides of the cake and then I sprinkled it with pecans on top. This is a true crowd pleaser!!!

Followed recipe Exactly except for extra 10-15 min in the oven.  It was a HUGE hit!  Will be making it again for Christmas.  The topping is the only tricky part. When chilled, it becomes solid and needs to be microwaved in order to spoon over the slices.

Amazing or as my boyfriend and family say "a little slice of heaven". I have made this pie for Thanksgiving and company potlucks and have had rave reviews. I am now expected to make it for Thanksgiving every year. The only thing I change is adding about 1/3 a cup of maple syrup in the pie to add more maple flavor. This is definitely my favorite pumpkin cheesecake!

My rating is for the Maple Pecan Glaze, as I used a slightly different pumpkin cheesecake recipe.  The glaze is excellent! It reminds me of a soft, maple-flavored caramel.  I also toasted the pecans before adding them to the sauce.

This was an amazing dessert!  Such a nice change from pumpkin pie, while still tasting like 'thanksgiving'.  The only reason I gave it four stars was because the crust didn't really work for me.  Maybe it needed to be thicker?    I used the suggestions offerend in another comment on making this low carb (I'm dealing with gestational diabetes and need to watch my sugars) and it worked out well.

I was a little sceptical of mixing pumpkin with maple syrup but it turned out delicious. My crust left something to be desired but I think that was an operator error as I didn't have a 9in pan on hand and used my 10in and tweaked the ingredients. My cheesecake rose up and then sunk back down so I used the maple pecan glaze and just filled in the top of the cheesecake and it was delicious! This will become a new holiday tradition.

This was the most decadent delicious cake I have ever made.   It was a hit and turned out beautifully!  I used candied pecans in the sauce and it was awesome!  Kids and adults asked for more then one serving of this and it was still good for several days after baking.  Awesome, awesome, awesome!!!

I received so many raves for this cheesecake! Everyone went crazy over it! I used reduced fat cream cheese (all I had on hand) and kept everything else the same. It was light and creamy a wonderful recipe, thanks!

This is pumpkin cheesecake perfection! Absolutely delicious as is, no changes needed on this recipe. Any cracks in your cheesecake will be disguised by the rich maple topping. I brought this to my cooking club meeting and it received rave reviews! I can't wait to have some more after dinner tonight!

I had enough of the pumpkin taste before finishing this.  Might not use as much next time.  I cooked it a little longer than required, but still seems like it needed more but didn't realize that until it was cooled down and cut.  Wonder if the cut pieces could have been put in the microwave for a few seconds.

This is quite tasty! The glaze made this just wonderful! I made the glaze and then poured it over the top of the cheesecake. Also, I don't have a spring-form pan, so I made this in a deep die pie plate and had quite a bit of leftover filling, so be aware of that. I used some of it in pancakes, which was great.

I made this for thanksgiving yesterday, it was wonderful.  I rotate pumpkin cheesecakes in the fall and this was one of the best!  It cooled the glaze and then spread it on top of the cheesecake about 2 hrs. before serving.  The baking time was fine for me, though I may add more maple to the cheesecake next time around.

This was amazing! With one substitution - I did use a gingersnap crust instead of the graham crumbs and I think it made all the difference. Great flavor!

This recipe was incredibly easy and was a huge hit at Thanksgiving.  I followed the reciped exactly.  The kids all said it was my best cheesecake ever.  It was a good compromise between cheesecake and pumpkin pie...tasted very "pumpkiny" but was very creamy.  The glaze was amazing!

I have to agree with the rater dated 11/11/06; the picture that's posted with this recipes looks awesome and the recipe reads very well, so you would expect the cake to be tasty.  However, the cheesecake tasted like we were eating straight cream cheese, as the flavor offered very minimal sweetness.  The glaze, never did thicken and was also a disappointment.

I was soooo disappointed with this.  I followed the recipe to a tee and was very excited because all of the reviews were so good!  I dont know what happened but the cake was so bland and eggy tasting.  The topping was really good but i had to drench the cake with it to make it worth eating.

I brought three pies to Thanksgiving this year - all recipes found on this site - and this one rated the highest by the entire family.  Next year I'll try with a ginger crust variation.

I made this Cheesecake about 4 1/2 years ago and my family loved it. I had moved across the country and lost the recipe. I finally found it again on this website. I will definetly make this recipe over and over again. #1 in my book.

Great recipe! Moderately easy to make. Though the cake is done baking in 1 hour and 40 mins. you can't eat it for 5 more hours. all in all it's a good and highly fatening piece of cake :)
