Ok so I cheated and took a short cut which I allowed myself since I delivered a week ago but wanted something to amp up my milk supply.  I bought 2 packs of Pillsbury Simply Oatmeal Brown sugar cookies and added above amounts of flaxseed, wheat germ, and Solgar brewer's yeast.  I let cookie dough soften and just mixed other ingredients in with a fork.  Turned out delicious!  Ate 3 cookies and followed with a half liter of water and I was engorged a few hours later.  This recipe is a keeper!  I thought I would post my shortcut for anyone who is in my same position though it does not wholly speak to the from scratch recipe.

I usually follow a recipe per the recipe whenever it's my first time making it, this recipe being no exception, and really enjoyed the cookies. 
The second time I made some modifications that made it a bit healthier, but not necessarily less calories.
Doubled the wheat germ
Used half coconut oil, half butter 
Added 1 tsp cinnamon 
Added 1/2 cup coconut flakes (no sugar)
Exchanged 3/4 cup sugar for apple sauce 

The final product: a much softer (10min bake time), less sugar, but still sweet cookie. Also to note, I used beet brewer's yeast, which did not make the cookies bitter. We love this recipe more now! I can also see adding or exchanging the chocolate for walnuts... Yum!

These cookies are amazing as far as cookies are concerned!  Then add the fact that they help me feed my baby!  I couldn't ask for more.

I've made it exactly as the recipe says and I liked them a lot.  The next time I used coconut oil instead of butter (1:1), accidentally confused the sugar measurements, and used craisins instead.  The coconut oil seems to keep the cookies moist longer and the taste doesn't seem to be affected.  It seems to be a recipe that is easy to play with, which I love! :)

These cookies are great. I made them last night and woke up this morning with huge engorged breasts. Thank you! I followed the recipe exact. The flax should be geletin like after soaking in the water. The taste was good, I got my brewers yeast at a vitamin store. After trying my first batch I added1T cinnamon to the dough and each batch I added something a lil different . I used: chopped apples, fresh blueberrys, walnuts and crasins. I froze half the plain dough so I could make more later. I had my cookies at about 9pm with a cup of mother tea and went to bed with flat boobies by 7am when I woke up they were round and over full. My 6 month willow was delighted and made such happy sounds while nursing. So happy the first thing I tried worked for me! Also milled flax seed is what I used , I think its the same as flax seed meal just labled differently. And the brewers yeast doesn't say debittered but since I bought it at a vitamin shop, and its made for adding to food, I suspect it is debittered reading some of the other reviews. If your having milk troubles TRY this!

These were okay. The first bite was good, but the aftertaste was kind of bitter. It may be because I know what brewer's yeast taste like on it's own (gross) but I think I'll have to jazz these up quite a bit in order to like them. My husband thought they were pretty good though (although he noticed the aftertaste too.)

Really good.  I used high quality de-bittered brewer's yeast and followed the recipe as listed, but added a few more chocolate chips (the bag was just over 1 cup of chips).  The cookies tasted like non-healthy cookies and it will be hard to limit myself to just 1 or 2 a day!
edit-This time I added 1 tsp Cinnamon and that really kicked up the flavor.  Yum.

Made these for my wife today, she said they were surprisingly yummy! I did substitute the cream of tartar for baking powder and they turned out just fine. We will see if they help her supply.

I followed the recipe the first time and they were delicious.  But, since I really don't have time to actually bake the cookies, I now modify the recipe so I can just freeze the dough and eat them that way!  I substituted coconut oil for the butter and used 2Tbs chia seeds mixed with 6Tbs water in place of the egg yolks.  They turned out fabulous!  Now I don't have to worry about eating the raw dough.  Get some vegan chocolate and you've got some vegan lactation cookies :)

Made these and they are seriously very very good. I made them for lactation assistance and thought to hide them but my husband found them and ate most of them. They are now my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe in general (and I have quite a few around). Left out the wheat germ and brewers yeast because I didn't have time to go find some and the grocer didn't have any. Did not have to modify the recipe to accommodate for this.

I loved this recipe! It was so easy and delicious. I used white chocolate chops instead and they were amazing! I saw a milk supply increase within 2-3 hours! The hardest thing about this recipe... Was finding the ingredients.

So I made these cookies several times before I tweaked them and they were super good as is. I recently had a baby and he is EBF so I wanted something to snack on that would also help my milk supply. I don't have a lot of time to bake several batches of cookies so I make brownies instead. 
I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of oil( I use vegetable oil but it doesn't matter what kind), instead of three egg yolks I used two eggs. Also for anyone who does not know this if you don't have cream of tartar you can use baking powder instead and the end result is the same. Bake at 350 degrees for about 30-40 minutes. So delicious!

WOW, this recipe is simply perfect & amazing! I noticed a difference within an hour after eating them. I added about a 1/2 oz more brewers yeast than recommended and added a little more sugar to level out the taste. Did not have the cream of tartar to use. Left out the chocolate chips as well.

In addition, I also consume the raw dough from this recipe as well. Seems to be twice as effective than the cookies. Just a tip for those moms whose supply is extremely low. Still drink the Mother's Milk Tea just for extra extra extra boost ;)

I followed it almost exactly as listed above. The only difference is that I added cinnamon. They came out delicious!! My husband eats as many of them as me! I should also add that I have seen a boost in my milk supply eating 3-4 a day.

I made this as written the 1st time & it was great. This time, I used coconut oil instead of butter & 1 1/2cup of brown sugar & omitted the white sugar. I doubled the amount of flax (omitted water), brewers yeast & wheat germ & added walnuts. These were awesome & I love that I can make the recipe however I like best. Delicious cookies!!

I made it the first time exactly according to directions and they tasted great, but the texture was a bit denser than I prefer. Since then, I put in two whole eggs instead of the three egg yolks, bake the cookies for 10 minutes at 375 degrees, and they come out fluffy and soft, just the way I like them.

Amazing! I used coconut oil instead of butter which makes it a whole lot better! I also put coconut flakes and after the dough is formed I roll them into balls flatten them out and put a little Nutella in the middle and close it up and roll them back into a ball and BAM! Deliciousness!!!!!

Great for boosting supply! Try to get brewers' yeast that says "mild flavor" or something similar; that will cut down on the possible tangy/bitter taste - which I didn't notice at all. I skipped the chocolate chips and used shredded coconut instead. I also subbed 1/4 C coconut oil for 1/4 C of the butter. They came out tasting like macaroons. YUM. The coconut substitution was mostly to keep my husband out of them. Worked great. You could also use pretty much anything you'd like - nuts, raisins, dried fruit - it would all work fabulously. If your dough comes out a little sticky, toss some more flour or oats in there. These cookies also freeze really well, so might as well make a double or triple batch and be set for a while. :)

Excellent...I was hesitant because the batter smelled bad.  I did add shredded sweetened coconut to the batter.  good!  I just ate 2 cookies...lets see if they work!  Update:  I've had lots of these cookies overnight.  My milk supply has increased slightly, however my milk supply has been increasing daily so I'm not convinced it's solely because of these cookies.  I have a hospital grade pump.  On Tuesday, I was averaging 20 ML's every 3 hours, on Wednesday I was averaging 30 ML's every 3 hours, Today, I got 60 ML in one sitting (but it was because I had waited 5 hours in between pumping) and the rest averaged to about 35 ML's.  I'll keep eating the cookies and seeing if they help...  For now, I think they are a huge waste of calories...

Did some of the things others suggested. Substituted half of the butter with coconut oil, added walnuts, baking powder instead of tartar, and added cinnamon. Used the mild brewers yeast and you can't taste it at all! Happy lactating!

I've made these so much I memorized the recipe. I've tried them with coconut flakes instead of oatmeal. Turned out well. Today I tried them with shredded cocounut flakes and they turned out toasty and extra crunchy.. They've helped my supply so much. Still EBF my 8 month old.

Super yummy, just made them, just tasted them. I didn't have wheat germ so that got removed from the recipe, I tripled the flax seed meal, doubled the brewers yeast, and added half a cut of oats. I used half a cup of regular semi sweet chocolate chips, and half a cup of mini semi sweet chocolate chips. So far they are light and moist out of the oven.

These are delicious! I added a little extra sugar on my second batch and they were even better. The best part is that they work really well increasing milk supply. I'm feeding twin boys so I'll take all the help I can get!

These cookies are delicious! I made them with some modifications...I used 1/2 C. Sugar in the raw, 1/2 C. Brown sugar and 1/2 C. Honey for my sugars. Added 1/4 C. Peanut butter  (to get some healthy fat in there). Used 1 C. Whole wheat flour (to make them a little healthier) and 1 C. White flour. And added 1tsp. Cinnamon and 1/4 tsp cloves. Turned out delicious!! And no bitter aftertaste!

These cookies were so delicious.  My 5 year old and 16 year old helped because my 8th month old needed to nurse. Great cooking project for the family.  I added a pinch of cinnamon per the review but followed the rest of the recipe as stated. Also my milk supply increased . I will definitely make these again.

this recipe is delicious! I omitted the chocolate chips and added 2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder to the butter/sugar mixture. these cookies do boost my milk supply as long as I'm also drinking enough water. I can't get enough of these!

This recipe was sooo good. This is the first time I made lactation cookies, I was looking for something to make instead of drinking mamma milk tea all the time. I did half a recipe to try it out and instead of chocolate chips I used dried fruit mix (cranberries, oranges and cherries). It came out great.

great recipe but I made some changes. I cut out th white sugar and do 1 cup of brown sugar. They are still sweet without the extra sugar! I also like to use heath bits instead of chocolate chips!

Delicious cookies, and they did the trick! I also had my young stepdaughters help me make them (they were more than happy because the cookies would help me fed their little sister), and, other than an electric mixer incident, it was a pretty kid-friendly recipe too!

I tried this after several other lactation cookie recipes.  The cookies don't taste as good, but I produce more milk, which is what I really care about.  Most recipes I tried had only a couple of tablespoons of brewer's yeast, this one has 1/4 cup.  Also, I live at 6500 ft elevation and these cookies turned out fine without making any changes to the recipe.  This is now my favorite lactation cookie recipe.

Cookies are fantastic!  Like another member, I added a TBSP of cinnamon, but other than that I made them exactly as the recipe called for.  And they are GREAT.  I love them and so does the hubby and my 2 year old.  Only down side is, they may not last long...

I’ve made this recipe several times. I’m not certain it really helps lactation but there’s no harm in trying. Last time I made these cookies they were too crumbly, but highly likely my own mistake. I substitute half of the butter with coconut oil and add cinnamon and raisins to mine.Just to ensure they came out OK this time I added a  few extra tablespoons of coconut oil and I also did two yolks and one whole egg. They taste great.

I am a working mom and have an EBF eight month old and my milk supply dropped significantly around 4 months. Whenever I need an extra cushion for a baby sitter or to try to build my freezer stash I make these cookies. I pump 3x per day at work and BF when I am with the baby. I usually pump approx  15oz a day, these cookies give me an extra 5-10oz per week. They are very easy to make and tasty!

I am not a cooking loving person but I had to try these to increase milk supply. My lactation consultant suggested me to try these. 
I made few changes- 
1. Only used 1 cup brown sugar, omitted white.
2. Instead of chocolate chips,used blueberries.
3. Didn't have cream of tartar,so used baking powder as suggested by other reviewers.
4. Doubled the flaxseed for added benefit. Also I couldn't find flaxseed meal. So bought whole seeds, ground them at home and dry roasted it in pan for 5-10 min. This takes away the bitterness of flaxseed and gives better taste.
5. Added walnuts.
The result was awesome. Yummy cookies and sugar is enough to my taste. I like it mild. Blueberries and walnuts give a great flavor . My husband loves it too. This is healthy option for anyone ,if you are ok to compromise the butter though. 
I want to try substitute it with oil, maybe next time.
I will have to wait and see its effect on lactation though.

Cookies tasted good. I added almond's and chia seeds for an extra boost, as well as doubled the brewers yeast and flax. Took and split it into separate batches so I could have different flavors.  Coconut, chocolate chip, cinnamon, and peanut butter. It's been over 10 hrs and no milk boost yet but there's still time.

Excellent! Per other reviewers suggestions, I substituted coconut oil for the butter 1:1 and added a dash of cinnamon. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. I can see how adaptable this recipe is. I would like to try adding nuts and dried fruit next time. Also curious about cutting some sugar by using apple sauce. I am going to have a hard time not eating them all at once!

These really did the job at boosting my supply, although I was a little skeptical. I skipped the cream of tartar since I didn't have on hand and taste fine. I made 1/2 batch and froze the rest since it made a ton of batter. Hopefully the ingredients will still work once thawed.

This recipe was EXACTLY what I was looking for!!  Made a couple mods: Coconut Oil for Butter, same amount. Reduced Flour to 1 1/2 cup and kept Oats at 2 cups. Added 1 tsp Cinnamon (would have used two but wanted to make sure it wasn't too much) and reduced sugar a tiny bit. 1 cup white but went with 1/4 cup brown (ran out but I always reduce 1/4-1/2 of the sugar). They were perfect at 10 mins, crisp edges but chewie and gooey :) Definitely using this recipe again and again! I've heard how well they work with another recipe I tried but this made the perfect cookie texture and flavor. They spread when baking and taste amazing! I also used nutritional yeast ( it's not exactly the same but still worked in my last recipe). Yum!!!

This recipe is awesome whether or not you are lactating (though the ingredients are pricey)!  I can't keep my husband out of them whenever I make them, he thinks they are the best chocolate chip cookies ever!

With no modifications, this recipe is still a 5-star!  I did the following just because I had the ingredients on hand to tinker with.  The first modifications I did were to sub 1/2 the white sugar with applesauce, add 1 tsp cinnamon, replaced 1/4 C flour with wheat bran (I accidentally ordered it when shopping for wheat germ), doubled wheat germ, used 1/2 C butter and 1/2 C coconut oil.  The result was ok but the cookies were too moist for my liking (we still ate them all up since they tasted great).  The next time I made them, I reduced white sugar to 1/2 C, did NOT use applesauce, doubled wheat germ, subbed 1/4 C of flour for wheat bran, used 1/2 C butter, 1/2 C coconut oil, intended to add cinnamon but forgot, and added chopped pecans in addition to chocolate chips.  I used a 1/4 C measuring spoon to scoop the batter onto my parchment paper lined airbake sheet.  I left them in about 13 minutes.  The result was AMAZING!!!  Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside!  Next time I will make the same modifications except I will use dark chocolate chips.  These cookies are 1000X better than the 10 for $22 lactation cookies sold at Buy Buy Baby which taste weird and were like bricks!  So glad I decided to make these--thanks so much for the recipe, kfwarden!

Made these per recipe one time, they were pretty good but the batter was a little dry and the oats didnt mix in fully. Second time around I had run out of butter so I had to improvise.

They turned out DELICIOUS with my variations. The changes I made were:
*Replace butter with coconut oil 1:1
*Add 1 full egg
*1/2 cup shredded coconut (the oil smelled so good I couldn't help myself

The coconut cut the brewers yeast/wheat germ taste.  Try it for yourself :)  Youll love them.

I am thrilled with the results after making these. I had a notable increase in supply during my work pumping sessions, about an oz increase a session! 
I did make some substitutions, half coconut oil half butter, steel cut oats, and macadamia nuts and dried cherries instead of chocolate chips. The taste is great considering some of the ingredients, there is a distinct aftertaste but that is pretty unavoidable when using brewer's yeast. I'm making these again today and giving them out to every BF mom I know!

I did my best but I couldn't get brewer's yeast, so I subbed with active yeast.  I also used whole wheat flour and dark chocolate chips, they were DELICIOUS! I haven't noticed an increase in milk yet,  but my supply is extremely low so it may take more time.

Good cookie.  My husband and son liked them.  I couldn't find brewer's yeast, so subbed in nutritional yeast.  Good stuff.

I really liked this recipe, but I felt that the oats could be reduced in quantity. When incorporating the dry ingredients and the oats, I got a good work out from it, it's very hard to get the ingredients to mix properly.
I added half a cup of walnuts for a boost in flavor.

Amazing cookies and especially good considering they help with milk production.  Added cinnamon (1 tbsp).  Husband and kids enjoyed as well.  I could not taste the milk enhancing ingredients at all.  Will be making again as  think they helped me (currently at 10 days post partum).

Made these last night, ate 3 and when I woke up for a middle of the night feeding I was engorged! They taste amazing and really bring up your supply, and my husband loves them as well. Definitely will be keeping these around the house :) will say I can taste the Brewers yeast however it isn't over Powering..

These cookies are so good & contain lots of great ingredients to get a mama's milk supply up. I added Craisins & I also substituted active dry yeast because I couldn't find brewer's yeast.  Calculated the ratio & used 1/8 cup of the active dry yeast.

These are yummy and an almost healthy take on cookies. I tweaked it a bit as per suggestions from other reviewers. I used half butter and half coconut oil and used whole eggs rather than separating. Helped boost my milk supply a bit but mostly a good excuse to eat cookies :). Will make again for myself and for friends who are breastfeeding.

Made these for the very first time and it turned out delicious! Both hubby and my 3yr old loved it. I substituted the butter for coconut oil and used 2 tsp of vanilla extract, cut down on chocolate chips and added raisins.  Brewers yeast was hard to find so I got it on Amazon.  Definitely making them again!

Just made them with half coconut oil and half butter. I used steel cut oats, adds a good texture. Ive already eaten quite a few. Hoping to see an increase so i can start pumping extra. I'm going to bake them all, then portion them and freeze so i can pull some out when i need them :)

I don't use the wheat germ or cream of tartar but these turn out great! I like that they call for a lot of brewers yeast - some other recipes only use 2-4 tbsp. I use mini chocolate chips (1/2 c) and peanut butter chips (1/2 c) to mix it up. I cook them 12 minutes and they are perfect! I use a mini ice cream scoop to make symmetrical balls of dough.

This was my first time trying the cookies and they turned out great. The only modification I made was using half cup butter and half cup coconut oil. Everything else was used as instructed. I just finished baking them and I've already eaten 5 lol.

5 stars as is. But I've done a few changes for other batches. 2nd batch I added 1/2 c walnuts for a bit of a crunch. 3rd batch I added 1c peanut butter and 1/2 cup walnuts. All batches were delicious. Not sure if it increased my milk but baby is still growing big.

I made these simply as a supplement to boost my milk sipply. I'm trying to lose the baby weight so I took out most of the fat and sugar. Instead of butter I used 1/2 cup coconut oil and 1/2 cup butter substitute. Instead of all that sugar I used 1 cup of honey. I also added 1/2 cup applesauce and almost a tbls cinnimon. I sprinkled the tops with pecan pieces, they are actually yummy! You may need milk with them.

These were good, but 2nd time I made them I did however make a few changes to this recipe I replaced half the butter with coconut oil, only used half cup of chocolate chips then added half cup of almonds and 1/4 cup sweetened coconut flakes, I used milled flax seed and used wheat flour instead of white flour. Turned out like an almond joy cookie. I liked the modifications much better! I'll try to find the lactation granola bars recipe and post it, they were much better than any cookie I've ate.

Well these cookies would be good but they taste like bitter beer. It must be my yeast even though the package said it was de-bittered. They are awful I can't even eat them. I'll have to add a ton more sugar or eliminate the yeast all together if I make these again - too bad because everything else about the cookie was good. They were soft and chewy and full of good ingredients.

I loved these cookies. I didn’t find them bitter at all, but that might be due to me not eating sweets very often so I’m not used to it. My first time making them was exactly how the recipe called and I enjoyed them very much. The second time making these I added a tablespoon of cinnamon because I wanted the added benefits of cinnamon (I know it sounds like a lot but it worked out great). I also don’t  like regular chocolate chips  so I used Hershey chocolate chips instead. I am trying to get my left breast to produce more milk, and so far things are going good.

These turned out great! I forgot to pick up cream of tartar so we left that out. We will definitely bake these again.

Only two complaints, the Brewers yeast was a bit pricy, and the cookies tasted a bit bland to me (dad). 

Wife LOVES them. Thank you so much for sharing!!!

I made these cookies twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and they were just okay. Definitely edible and no bitterness like some of the other reviews claimed, but nothing special. I remade them today but I used half butter and half coconut oil, 1/2 cup more chocolate chips,  and a large handful of roasted almonds that I roughly chopped. They turned out fantastic!!!! I will definitely be making these again with the changes. And I have noticed an ounce or two increase in my daily milk production so far. It's only been 4 days but it seems to have helped a little. I give the original recipe 4 stars but with the changes I made I think it's worth 5 stars!

Wow this is the s***!! I’ve purchased lactation cookies that are expensive and dry and these are on another level!!

I didn’t have all the ingredients but it turned out PERFECT!

I didn’t have any cream of tartar or wheat germ so I just didn’t put them in. Instead of 1 cup of choc chips I did a 1/2 cup and then added 2T of cocoa powder. I also only had a 1/2 cup of oats left so I put that in and then added 1 cup of baby cereal (gerber brand: oats, rice, grain mix). I know this sounds ridiculous but they turned out sooooo good!!!

Use quality ingredients for an even better cookie :)

I did not make any changes this time around and they turned out pretty good. Easy recipe for a first time baker.  Next time, instead of using chocolate chips, I will probably add in butterscotch & raisins.

These were very good while fresh, but they didn't keep long. After a day or two they got an odd flavor to them. But overall, very tasty as long as eaten the same day they are made.

The cookies turned out great but the first batch made was like a cookie pie, it all melted-baked together! Not sure if it's b/c i didn't roll it into little balls or if it's b/c i sprayed the cookie pan? The next recipe, i will substitute the sugar for coconut sugar, and coconut/almond flour instead of regular all purpose to see if the taste will be a big difference. 

As far as increasing milk production, we will see?!!...

I made these following the recipe exactly the first time and they were AMAZING! I’ve just made them again and subbed out the butter for unsweetened applesauce and added an extra tablespoon of wheat germ. The results were a much cakier cookie, cooked for 10 mins. The original recipe was better, but considering I ate about a dozen a day, I’ll continue to make with applesauce. I intend to try this recipe with a few other healthier adjustments and will update with the results when able!

I’m trying to up my supply since stress seems to be lowering how much I make. I made these cookies in a rush since my new breast pump is arriving tomorrow. I forgot to add baking soda to mine but it didn’t seem to leave the cookie tasting nasty, will add next time. I bought regular active dry yeast that was less than the 1/4 cup in the recipe, added cinnamon, realized I didn’t have enough butter (about 1/2 cup) and used coconut oil to substitute the rest. Also, I didn’t fully review the recipe and just threw everything in one bowl. Next time I’ll use all butter, and I won’t use just the egg yolk. And, I doubled the amount of flax seed in my recipe, only because I love the stuff. I ordered the brewers yeast today and will use in the future. Overall, they still taste better than the cookies in the store, so I recommend taking out the time to bake them. Also, it will save you money just to bake them yourself.

Wow! I was not expecting these to be so delicious. I did not have cream of tartar and I used almond flour instead of regular flour. These are really really good and I’m not a big oatmeal fan.

Love this recipe. I added 1/4 cup of iquid milk & 1/4 cup ground flax seed instead of adding water to the whole flax seed, 1 cup of brewers yeast, 2 cups of wheat bran & 1/2 cup of flour instead of 2 1/2 cups of flour & I added 1/2 cup more oats. I also only used 1 cup of brown sugar total. Super moist and delicious

This recipe is great! The cookies are moist, taste great and you can make around 24 from one batch. I added 1/3 cup of brewers yeast and was able to handle the taste/after taste so I think I'll add half a cup next time and see how that goes.

Love these! Made them yesterday to help with my flow and they worked! My daughter has began sleeping more through the night which slowed my flow, I gave these a try had just 3 or 4 of these in a 6 HR period and was able to feed fully at bedtime and be engorged by 4 am bedtime is at 10p. The only change i made was due to not being able to find brewers yeast at my local walmart and needing to stay budget friendly i got regular yeast and used a small portion less than the recipe called for and got the same results and loved the taste!! I also used dark chocolate chips as they are healthier and I love the flavor better.

Tasty recipe, I did make a few modifications though. I added a tablespoon more of flaxseed & brewer's yeast, 1/2 cup more of oats, 1/4 cup peanut butter & 1 tsp cinnamon. I took them out sooner & let them sit. Chewy goodness!

Followed directions (minus wheat germ). Seem a little dry but otherwise very good little cookies. Also made another time with Betty crocker oatmeal cookie mix based on a review which was good too... Maybe a little sweeter than I like with the mix.

These cookies are great! I will say- this recipe makes a LOT of cookie dough, so I go ahead and roll half of it up into preformed balls and freeze them so that I can have some ready whenever I need some more. I don’t even thaw them, and they turn out great!

love this recipe! i wanted to make my own vs buying some. I added cinnamon, raisins sometimes, and extra chocolate chips. i also add a little more salt and vanilla. ive used self rising yeast at first, before i had brewers yeast, just used half the amount of yeast it called for.

planning to try using applesauce and some coconut oil as substitutes for eggs and butter.

I just made these for the first time for my sister who just gave birth. This recipe was very easy to follow. I've never baked cookies from scratch before, and when I was rolling the balls to put into the baking sheet, I worried that they might come out too dry... but I was so wrong! These cookies are delicious, and just the right amount of moistness. I will be baking these for every new mom I know!

2nd batch turned out fantastic! 1st batch was so bitter due to the brewers yeast, so I bought a de-bittered brewers yeast (Mommy Knows Best from Amazon) and now the cookies are so good! The whole family loves them!

I followed the recipe and just added some cinnamon but they turned out delicious! Hardest part was tracking down the Brewers Yeast, wheat germ and cream of tartar. But it was worth it. Anything I can do to keep my milk supply going I will do. Thanks for a great recipe!

These cookies are amazing! My husband even likes them too! I followed the recipe as it was written. I think these come out better when you bake them closer to 12 minutes. I was able to make 62 cookies with this recipe and my cookies were average sized. So it definitely makes more than 36 cookies. My milk supply has increased too! Pumping 6 oz in a session and my baby is one month old.

I just made a batch of these for a girlfriend who just had a baby, and the cookies are excellent! I'd probably make these again, babies or no babies, they're that good. Didn't change a thing about this recipe. Also, I can hardly taste the brewer's yeast whatsoever.

I made mainly for lactation, so I used just under a half cup of Brewer yeast and removed half cup of flour and added an extra half cup of oatmeal. Doesn't taste as great as original version but it does a good job of masking taste of Brewer yeast and definitely helps with lactation!

It was very good! I substituted the wheat germ with 1/4 cup unsweetened shredded coconut, the flour with whole-wheat flour, and 1/2 of the butter with 1 cup of tahini (it’s excellent for lactation!). I also added 1 cup of Reese’s pb chips.

I made this recipe as directed, but I added in a cup of shredded coconut as I love coconut in my oatmeal cookies. Also coconut is also known for helping with breastfeeding. Super yummy!!!

Very yummy cookies! I’m not a fan of chocolate really, so I used 3/4 cup white chocolate chips & 3/4 cup craisins. Delicious! I also added 1 tsp cinnamon. Good base recipe! Hoping they’ll increase my supply.. will soon find out ;)

I made these today for my daughter and grandson who is in the nicu.  I added a tsp of cinnamon to the recipe which really enhanced the finished flavour.  also used 2 cups of chocolate chips . My son ate one and pronounced it delicious. I plan on adding cut- up dried apricots, which are also good for lactation, to the remaining batter. I also will use "quick oats" rather than "old-fashioned rolled oats", which are a little chewy for my taste, to the next batch. This is an excellent cookie for all!  I just made up the rest of batter and added the apricots. I found that the oats had softened some from sitting in batter in the frig-next batch I will let sit for 24 hours before cooking.

I opted for craisins instead of chocolate chips. Came out wonderfully. I have yet to see what they do for my milk supply. Fingers crossed they work

Totally amazing!!! I also added a handful of slivered almonds, pumpkin seeds, an extra tsp of vanilla and 2 of cinnamon, some dried cranberries, cherries, and blueberries.  They’re my favorite cookies now.

Super yummy!!!!  I’d like to try with raisins instead. I used 2TBSP of active yeast as I couldn’t get brewers yeast. Worked well. I don’t know if it works as well for lactation though.

I'm dairy & soy free my boys don't tolerate either in my diet. So, I swapped out the 1c butter for 1/2c applesauce.
Taste delicious. Just made & ate two this evening. We'll see if they help my supply in the next week.

Love then the only thing I changed was the yeast.  I know I sound crazy but if u look on eBay u will find brewer yeast with no favor and unsweetened.  Which it help for that after taste. Plus for the life of me I couldn’t find it at my local store.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Cookies came out so good. Followed the recipe exactly. Ate 4-5 cookies and woke up the next morning engorged which I haven’t felt like that in a few weeks. This was the perfect recipe to give me back my boost. I’ve been eating about 3 cookies in the morning and a couple in the evening. Wish it wasn’t so high in calories but does the job which is what I was looking for. I ain’t complaining & neither is baby. Thank you!
Tip- Use REAL butter! Makes a huge difference in taste & texture.

Delicious cookies! I just made them last night for the first time and not only were they easy to make, they taste great. The whole family loves them. I’ve noticed a slight increase in milk production already.

I used Almond flour instead of all-purpose, first batch was extremely flat, added about a tablespoon of coconut flour and put the dough in freezer for 10minutes and second batch came out a lot better. Taste very good, didn't give 5stars because I haven't had enough time to see if my milk changes. Beware if you don't have ingredients on hand they are not cheap. Had to buy roughly $30 of stuff to make these (not including the almond flour, and other common ingredients like egg and sugar)

Very good tasting cookie and still slightly chewy inside. I only cooked for 9 min because I was using convection bake and this feature on my oven bakes faster.

I made it! it's really tasty. My milk supply is way more than what I started with. My son use to want the bottle all the time, now he only takes one bottle a day :)
but does anybody know how many calories are in one cookie? I know it says there are 36 cookies made per batch, 158 calories... but what is the serving amount? 1,2,3 cookies?

Delicious. I just used cream tartar instead of baking powder and brown sugar instead of white sugar. It has a little more sweet taste. I'll use less sugar next time.

The cookies are delicious. The batter was very stiff after adding the oats so I thought cookies might turn out dry but they have great flavor and texture! I removed them from the oven when they were light golden in color as recipe called for, which was 14 minutes for my oven.

I used the lactation recipe for the benefit of someone else so cannot speak concerning that benefit.

These were AMAZING! I used semi sweet chocolate chips but will switch for milk chocolate chips next time to counter the slight bitterness, and I added 1/2 cup of walnuts. I ate six throughout the afternoon, woke up next morning and filled the baby's tummy! I've had trouble with low milk supply so this was an awesome help to me!!

Great cookies! very tasty! all the family loved them. I'd make them even if I wasn't breastfeeding. In terms of helping with the supply, I'm not sure. Now, I have little supply. I've tried pretty much everything to make it increase and nothing has worked. A lactation consultant told me that my type of breast don't produce much milk and I guess she was right =( .  Anyway, if my milk supply increased after the cookies was little (a couple of onz). I followed the recipe exactly as it shows. I shared the cookies with another friend who's breastfeeding as well and her supply is normal and she did feel the boost after the cookies. So there you go. I'll probably make the cookies again just in case they work more and because they are  good! Good luck mommas!

I love these cookies and so did my husband and 2 yr old. I made it according to the instructions the first time, the second time I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and a handful of coconut flakes.  These made 4 dozen cookies using a teaspoon from my silverware. These have helped my milk supply with my premie little girl. I will be making these not only for lactation, but as a really good oatmeal cookie.

I love this recipe and make it often. I have made it as is for delicious cookies that even my kids and hubby like. I feel they help great with my lactation. I love having a sweet treat that also has a great purpose. :) 

My favorite way to eat these cookies is as dough. I just keep it in the fridge and snack on it throughout the day. I'll also freeze part of the dough to pull out another day - either to cook or just eat the dough. 

I have also altered the recipe different and they almost always come out great. , using half coconut oil, less sugar, etc.

I made these for my daughter and she feels that they definitely do help in her milk production.  I used non-bitter brewer's yeast and wheat germ oil and it the recipe still turned out great.  They don't taste bad either!

These cookies turned out perfect! I’m not breastfeeding yet but nearing the end of my pregnancy so wanted to make some dough to freeze for quick baking and helping my milk supply post partum. 

Here’s what I tweaked since I don’t eat chocolate and didn’t have wheat germ on hand. 

I followed the recipe  as called for but added one more Tablespoon of ground flaxseed and 1/8 cup of water more (let that rest with the other flaxseed & added all as called for to the wet ingredients).  I also changed the three egg yolks to: 2 yolks and one whole egg. (I made sure to let the eggs reach room temperature prior to mixing in and same thing for butter). 

After mixing all of the dry and wet ingredients together and the oats I split the dough in half and added 1/2 cup butterscotch chips to one half (folding in) and to the other half I added 1/8 tsp allspice, 1/8 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 cup raisins. 

I placed the dough in the refrigerator to chill it before handling it to make walnut sized balls and tested each variety by baking them in a 350 degree oven for 12 min. 
Note: the dough will still appear a bit sticky before baking and a little undercooked upon removal from oven. 

Once baked. Cool some. They taste better cool. And enjoy! 

These didn’t wind up being dry at all! They were fluffy and light and soft. 

I’ll be freezing batches in ball form so I can pull them out and pop them in the oven as needed after baby arrives. 

After baked store in an airtight container or pl

These cookies are delicious. I ate eight of them within the first 24 hours of baking. I did substitute equal part baking powder for the tartar and the cookies came out just fine. A few people mentioned in reviews here that the cookies are bitter, but I didn’t think that at all. I find most US cookie recipes to be too sweet so I felt these were ideal. They didn’t do anything for my breast milk production but I am still going to eat the rest of the cookies and probably make another batch.

I made the recipe with a few changes: I added an extra TBS of flax, I didn’t have wheat germ. I  added a little less  of both sugars. I halved the dough and made 1/2 with chocolate chips and the other 1/2 I added 3/4 cup raisins soaked in water. I also added Apple pie spice and cinnamon to the raisin dough. The dough was a little dry but it was probably because I added more flax. .

Great recipe and mad eyes over 40 delicious cookies for momma. I couldn’t find Brewers Yeast in powder form from 4 local stores so I used the dietary supplement pill form (98% Brewers Yeast) instead and just crushed them with a hammer in a ziplock bag wrapped in a towel. Make due with what you got, it’s not active yeast anyway so you can supplement it without too much concern for measurements as long as you calculate the recommended amount. Keep in mind the baby will be getting some through the milk so if any sensitivities exists you may want to consult your dr. before using BY.

I used coconut oil instead of butter; makes them moister than if I had used only butter. I suppose you could use half butter half coconut oil if you wanted. I did not find the brewer's yeast taste to be overpowering; on the contrary, I actually enjoyed the taste. If you love bread and beer, you'll LOVE these cookies. I ate three right off the bat and could already feel my breasts filling up, so they definitely do what they are supposed to do. Definitely use this recipe and make these cookies instead of buying commercial lactation products; cookies bought online or at the store are so much more expensive and don't even taste as good. Plus, these are free from preservatives and other things you'd find in cookies at the store. You can also make them go farther if you roll them into smaller balls. Instead of yielding 36, you could easily get 42 or even 50 out of this recipe if you rolled them small enough. P.S. they make your house smell heavenly.

I am not a baker at all and just made these as preparation for birth in 6 weeks. I baked a few to taste and it’s delicious. If I can make it, anyone can! I cannot attest to whether they’re going to help me lactate, but they’ll definitely help me feel better because they taste so good! 

I wish I had added or mixed different ingredients in the batch so I could have a little variety. I read some people added nuts, cinnamon, etc. When I make another batch I’ll be sure to add the variety.

Very good recipe!  I like to sub unsweetened applesauce for half of the butter, add a big spoonful of peanut butter, and mix in raisins or dried cranberries.  Makes a huge batch.  Very delicious!

I just made these cookies and they are super moist and yummy!! The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that it’s too soon for me to tell if they are helping in the “boobie juice” department. Other than that, delish!

I made this and not only does it work wonders, but the husband loved them. I did follow all of the ingredients just because i forgot to grab the short cut version. Went from 7-8oz at my 11AM pump to 15.5oz. Nothing else was changed in my diet/water intake.

I made these exactly as written with the exception of the wheat germ because I didn't realize that was part of the recipe and is not something I keep at home.  I used the Pampered Chef medium scoop and got 3 1/2 dozen cookies out of the recipe.  I don't detect any aftertaste whatsoever.  I purchased my brewer's yeast at Wegman's (found in their health food section) and milled flax seed (also from Wegman's, in the baking aisle).  I will update this review when I know whether they help with milk production (they are fresh out of the oven and delicious), but what a yummy way to help increase production :-)

They appear to increase my milk a bit, but they are really heavy on the sugar. Next time, I'll cut back at least half a cup, and double the chocolate chips (one cup isn't enough for a batch that made almost three dozen cookies). I did throw in a cup of pecans for some protein and a teaspoon cinnamon to help cover the bitter taste of the brewers yeast.

I used the Betty Crocker Oatmeal cookie mix and added wheat germ, flaxseed meal, two eggs, butter and water. Woke up with full boobs of milk. Got 5 ounces in 10 mins. It took me 30 mins to get 2 ounces the day before so the cookies certainly helped !!!

I've been making this recipe for years- lactating or not. My children and family love them also. They're packed full of nutrients. I use a 1.5t scooper and roll them into balls which yields roughly 52 cookies. They freeze extremely well- just bake for 1 extra minute. Definitely boosts milk production and mood! :)

These cooked are very good. They did not work for me as I hoped but I will continue to eat them. The recipe does not explain how many cookies this makes. It makes a TON. 
My dough overall was not the right consistency to roll, I may have added too many oats. 
Other than that, fun recipe to cook.

I didn't have flax seed meal so I substituted with chia seeds and it turned out great! I also doubled the chocolate chips and I'm glad I did because it's the perfect amount of chocolate chips I think. Super tasty and they don't taste weird at all! In my first batch I noticed that the cookies didn't melt down to be flat cookies (I formed the dough as balls and placed them on the cookie sheet), so for the second batch, I smooshed the dough down so they came out flatter.

Really delicious! My husband kept sneaking them and when I told them what they were for, he said it was fine if he started lactating too. Wouldn’t that be awesome?

As a woman with pcos, I found that my milk supply was very low. I set out to try and find a way to help with that issue and decided to give these a try. It took about 4 cookies a day and about 90oz of water to see any results. I ended up with an ounce increase on one side and half an ounce on the other side (pretty good for me and my situation) plus they tasted wonderful! I added half a cup of walnuts and half a cup of pecans to the dough to add some extra yummy. I also used the debittered version of the brewers yeast and the toasted wheat germ (these were the only ones available at my local HEB). I don't know if that messes with the potency or not but the taste was good. I also found that they were soft and delicious when I used a 1/4 cup measuring cup to scoop the dough and then baked them for 9 minutes. I let them sit on the pan for 5 minutes. Absolutely awesome cookies!

Added maple syrup & applesauce as a sugar substitute. Did a plain batch and then experimented with the second batch with ground cinnamon, diced up apple & pumpkin seeds. Preferred the second batch. The cinnamon covers up any bitterness from the beer brewer ingredients.

Amazing cookie recipe!  I substituted the butter for Apple Butter and reduced the sugar by leaving out the 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  They turned out amazing!  I also added walnuts, pumpkin seeds, cranberries and a tablespoon of cinnamon and wow they're now my go to powerhouse cookie!

Good cookies. The Brewers yeast does add a different flavor. My dad is a huge sweets eater. He tried them, but would not eat more than one because of the yeast flavor. Oh well, more for me! Hubby will eat a few, but I think the whole idea of lactation cookies doesn't sit well with him.

I made these cookies with nutritional yeast because that's what my grocer carried and white chocolate chips and they came out very yummy. They were super moist and the kids thought it was desert! I had to tell them they will make them lactate if they eat too many, to keep them from eating them all! They steered clear after that  

Since it's the yeast, wheat germ, flax seed, and oats that does the trick I also mix some in with Greek yogurt to dip the cookies in. Thought that may give me a bit more boost.

These turned out good from the recipe as written. After I added cinnamon and coconut they were great. I didn't experience much increase in milk and believe me I ate plenty for it to work if it was going to ????.

These cookies are, by far, THE best I've ever had! I did add about a tsp of cinnamon, did half & half of butter and coconut oil, and added some sweet shredded coconut into the mix (I went off of others reviews). These cookies taste delicious, AND I can see a difference in my milk production (although, I'm also drinking Yogi brand nursing tea), I went from pumping a daily amount of 18-24 ounces to a hefty 28-34 ounces in about a month. I HIGHLY recommend these!

This didn't really work as well as I would have liked but I am giving it four stars because it helped a little and because I didn't really follow the recipe to the T.  I used the short cut that one reviewer posted and mixed the oatmeal, brewers yeast, flax seed meal, and wheat germ with kroger's brand macadamian nut cookie dough.  I then baked it normally.  Another reason this may not have worked as well as I would  have liked may be because I didn't use old fashioned oats.  My grocery store didn't have them so I used regular oats (not the quick oats).

Other than a little cinnamon I stuck to the recipe the first time and they were okay. Had a little trouble with the taste of Brewers Yeast. Today I made them a second time but In a desperate attempt to cover up the awful taste I added cocoa to the batter.

Wow these are amazing!!!! 

I followed the recipe to the T except lol 

1. Used an entire bag of chocolate chips 
2. Used 1 1/4 cups oats (all I had)

Next time I'll try more oats and less chocolate chips. i froze most of them!! Hoping they increase my supply. :)

Amazing!  All the measurements were spot on. I thought the dough was going to be too soft but the cookies came out fluffy and perfect!!! I omitted the tartar, and used dark chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate. Of course I used the whole bag instead of just one cup, lol. I added a handful of m&m's by accident (cooking with a toddler...) but I think I would put them in on purpose next time. They added a surprise crunch in some cookies. There was only two toddler handfuls added, so not all the cookies have candy,  which is kinda fun. I don't know if they work yet, but my experience with brewers yeast and wheat germ is positive. I usually almost double my supply in a few days of cookies and Tea. Make these, it's fun and they taste so good!

I was wanting to know if any mommas made these and added fenugreek or raisins? Also, it is ever too soon to start with lactation driven foods while still pregnant? TIA

Followed the recipe for the most part.  Didn't have cream of tartar, so substituted with 2 tsp of white distilled vinegar. These are fantastic! I am making these for my cousin and tempted to eat then myself! Made 55 cookies

Used butterscotch chips instead. So yummy!! It was a challenge to track down wheat germ (cereal aisle), flax (natural foods aisle), brewer's yeast (not at grocery store- found  in natural foods store) but it is worth it. Made dough balls and froze so I can bake a couple cookies at a time when I feel my supply is in a dip. Don't know if it'll actually work but I don't care, it's a delicious cookie!

Add cinnamon!  These are great. I also made the dough into balls, then instead of cooking, I froze them so I could bake some fresh cookies anytime without much effort.

Made these last night and I must say these are some of the best cookies I've ever had--no joke! I will make these even after I am done nursing! I didn't experience any of the bitter aftertaste or problems with the cookies flattening as others have suggested. The only thing I modified was I used Wheat Bran instead of Wheat Germ because that is all my store carried.

My sister really loved it! I saved half the dough in the freezer to freshly bake another batch later... I couldn't find brewer's yeast and cream of tartar so used 1/4cup more of the wheat germ and a little chopped almond and chia seeds. Tastes great!

Oh wow! I have three children and am still breastfeeding the baby. I decided to make these for a friend who just had her first child, and have never even made lactation cookies for myself before. Let's just say, I will have a hard time giving these away! These are, by far, the best oatmeal cookies ever! I did use coconut oil and applesauce instead of butter, and dry yeast because I didn't have brewer's, and added cinnamon. Thanks for the recipe, I'm hooked!

AMAZING! At first the odd taste of the Brewer's yeast threw me odd but then I became obsessed with it. If you decide to freeze, I would suggest letting them sit out to thaw and not microwaving since they burn easily and I'm sure it kills a lot of the good stuff needed to help produce more breastmilk.

My daughter has been scheduled  to deliver a boy in the next two days.  She had asked me to make "lactation cookies" for her. Being ignorant of what they were (my experience with lactation was you gave birth, and you started nursing!) I did some research. This recipe looked the most promising. I researched Brewers yeast brands and settled on the Bluebonnet brand, which seemed to impart the least flavor to baked goods, according to reviews. Got some flax meal and I was in business. Finally, a use for the jar of wheat germ that has been languishing in the bowels of the fridge for heaven-knows-how long. I made the dough as directed, and divided in half. Made half exactly as written, but to the other half I added about 3/4 tsp cinnamon, a dash of cloves and 1/2 cup raisins. Both are excellent! They are soft and chewy, and taste like some of the best oatmeal raisin and oatmeal chocolate chip cookies you ever had. There was no trace of bitterness (be sure to seek out the Bluebonnet brand because bitterness seemed to be a recurring theme when reading reviews of many recipes online,) no bizarre flavors, even when warm. They're just a great, hearty cookie-jar cookie, simple, uncomplicated and satisfying. The kind that begs to accompany a cold glass of milk or a cup of tea. The whole family will love them. These are going into her freezer so my daughter can have them as often as she likes or needs. I'm sure the wholesome ingredients will help her and the new grandson get off to a great

I made this for my wife after we had our baby 2 months preemie. Because he joined us so early we were trying everything we could to get "things moving."  I would say that the cookies helped with that, and were delicious! I added about a tablespoon of extra brown sugar, a bit of additional vanilla extract, and wasn't stingy with the chocolate chips. Amazing! Even for someone not trying to produce milk Don't try and overcook to get crispy, with the edges golden brown it leaves an amazing, chewy, moist cookie! Enjoy!

Very yummy!!! I haven't really seen much of an increase in supply yet (it's been about 24 hours), but they are delicious and good for you! My husband has been eating them too, he cannot stay away from them! They are no different tasting than a regular oatmeal chocolate chip cookie but I love the health benefits of the flax seed, Brewers yeast and wheat germ. The only changes I made were: 1) I used dark brown sugar instead of light brown (it's all I had, plus I think it makes for a richer cookie), and 2)  I prefer a chewier cookie so I swapped the amounts for white sugar vs brown sugar. Next time, I may eliminate the white sugar completely to reduce sugar and substitute the butter with coconut oil or applesauce for an even healthier version. They didn't spread as much as I thought but they ended up thick and chewy which I like. I will keep making them even if my supply does not increase because they are delicious! Also, I ended up only baking the first 2 trays, the rest I shaped on a tray and froze, then once frozen, stored them in a ziplock for easy baking later.

I made it with white chocolate chips, milk chocolate chips & chopped walnuts; 3 flavours for 2 dozen cookies. I ended up eating one after another til it's all gone in 2 days! They taste so good! Although honestly it didn't help much on my milk supply, I can surely make it again for healthy alternative to chips!

Made these exactly as written,  resulting in about 55 cookies. So yummy - made these about a week before I delivered and just finished the batch yesterday - will be making more today! Unsure if these help in milk production, but they're a welcome treat after breastfeeding!

They taste pretty good.  I got a brewers yeast from a store called whole foods along the flax seed meal and wheat germ. The store carries a less bitter brewers yeast made by the company named ( now). just had a couple cookies so I hope to notice the increase in milk products soon.

They were really good. BUT, if you are prone to hypertension, do not put in the brewer's yeast! There's something in it that can spike your blood pressure. I found this out the hard way. Just thought I would share!

These are good, but I prefer Oat Mama granola bars. They don't have any butter or refined sugar, just organic coconut oil and local honey. They are more nutritious than cookies and taste better too!

I made them according to the recipe except I substituted Earth Balance Vegan Buttery Sticks for the butter and it worked fine--my 5-month-old daughter is sensitive to dairy. I was able to find the wheat germ and brewer's yeast (reduced bitterness) at Sprouts, an Arizona-based health food store. For those who are looking, the wheat germ is in the oatmeal section and the brewer's yeast is in the vitamin/supplement area. It took me a while to find them. I found the flax seed meal at Safeway. I also added some chopped walnuts. They are very yummy. Have been eating them the last couple of days but haven't noticed a huge increase in supply. Will see how it goes this week.

I made these without the yeast (didn't have any) and added 1/2 tbsp of honey and craisons. They are fantastic.

Ok so got inspiration from another reviewer who cheated w pre-made oatmeal cookie dough :) except instead of oatmeal I had to use chocolate chip bc I sent my boyfriend out for it n thats what he came back with lol but I used 1 roll of chocolate chip cookie dough but added the wheat germ, flaxseed, active dry yeast and added old fashioned plain oats. And they came out yummy kinda like a super granola bar! I didn't become engorged bc my 3 week old son is constantly nursing but I was producing more milk n pumped 2 ounces in about 20 minutes which was pretty impressive for myself!

I made these and didn't have a strange aftertaste. I recommend buying the brewer's yeast from a pharmecy or a vitamin store because the yeast is then manufactured as a food additive.  I will have to see if they make a difference in my production, but they're really good to say the least.

I don't usually write reviews but these cookies are delicious! I used raisins instead of chocolate chips! They taste like good old fashioned oatmeal cookies. You can't taste the "lactation enhancing" ingredients. I will report back if I see an increase in production as well. Stay tuned.

I just made these and they are delicious! I can't speak for how well they boost my supply but I will update my review if I notice an increase. These are so good though that even my hubby liked them. I did substitute the butter with coconut oil and they turned out great! Will make again even if I don't need a boost in milk production. With the flax, oats, wheat germ and brewers yeast they are healthier than your typical oatmeal cookie.

They did not spread out and flatten at all. They taste fine.  My are a but crumbly but soft balls. The kids laugh at the cookies as they stayed perfectly round on the pan after they were finished baked.   Not sure if it helps my milk either I ate three and it been a few hours and I don't sent I have any increase but maybe tomorrow I will notice.  The cookies still taste very good though. So they will get eaten.

These were great! The not change I made was adding peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips. They get a little hard after a couple days so eat them up! Haha :)

I can't believe how yummy these taste! I was a little questionable when I saw the ingredients and smelled the brewers yeast but they came out delicious! I was short about a half cup of oatmeal so I added a little bit of white chocolate chips to it also. I will definitely make these again if not for milk, for taste!
