Great textures, combination of items and taste. My daughter especially liked it, as she is into all food that is Mexican or Southwestern. Saw that some on here have mentioned that this recipes is full of carbs. It does have lots of carbs, but they are healthy ones. This recipe contains healthy, complex carbohydrates like beans and avocados, which we all need to have healthy, balanced diets and that provide energy; we should avoid simple carbs, like pretzels, white bread, donuts, lots of types of candies, pies, etc. are the types that turn to pure sugar once eaten and cause weight gain. It is never healthy to completely avoid ALL carbs, just the ones that cause weight gain or can be unhealthful for those with various diseases like diabetes. It is never healthy to avoid any one food group; just make sure you are eating the right type.

When I first saw this recipe come out in the new published recipe list, I just knew I'd like it, has everything in it I love. Finally had a chance to make it. Nice southwestern breakfast that is easy to make, healthy and will keep you satisfied all day long. Thanks Matt for such a great idea for breakfast.

I just scrambled all ingredients together. I left out the olive oil and only used a half can of the black beans. Topped it with a little extra salsa when serving. Delicious and very simple.

I like that this was healthy, easy, and fast to put together, and it wasn't bad, but it could use some more flavor to make it even better.  Adding some spice to the beans would be a start, as they were pretty bland.  Also topping the bowl with some fresh chopped cilantro would be a good addition.

I seasoned the beans with green onion, cilantro, garlic, onion powder and pepper; and cooked them on the stove top. My daughter and I love black beans and really liked this for breakfast. It was filling and left us satisfied well into our busy day! Thanks for sharing!

Fast and tasty.  Cooked the black beans for five minutes on the stove and added in fresh cilantro.  This would make a great breakfast, but I think it made an even butter lunch.

Thanks Matt!

This was great. I added a bit of taco seasoning for extra flavor. I also added a pinch of cheese and a dollop of sour cream. Very healthy and hearty

The five star rating isn't because it a special dish...it is good, but the five stars comes from the ease and affordability of the dish.  Nice switch up from plain jane eggs.

This tasted better than what I expected. It kind of reminded me of a burrito without the tortilla. I made 2 servings using 1 egg and 1/3 can of beans each. I cooked the eggs in 1 tsp of whipped butter. I kept the rest of the ingredient amounts the same. For seasoning I added a pinch of garlic salt and a sprinkle of black pepper. Calories per serving, as made, came to about 360. ty

We really enjoyed this!  I added fresh cilantro to the eggs since I had some, we used about 2/3 of the can of beans and I split half an avocado between the two bowls.  I also didn't use the olive oil to cook the eggs, just sprayed the pan with cooking spray.  Quick, easy, healthy...what more can you ask?!

This is a super easy meal to make. My mom had the great idea to dress it up with some fresh fruit, plums and bananas, alongside fried red potatoes with onions and bell peppers.

Great recipe! I had to make some alterations:  I used a 3-bean blend (that's all u had on hand). As some viewers suggested, I added cilantro to my eggs; used avocado that my husband put on the grill! Yum! Added shredded cheese to top it all off.  Thanks for sharing!!

This was pretty good.  I am not usually a fan of meals without meat but I could get used to this. It was filling and tasty, a good source of protein. I will make this a regular go to breakfast especially since it is really quick to prepare

How could you go wrong?!  Black beans are sooo good, and good for you, and most importantly, are my favorite, so I'm always looking for ways to incorporate them. This is such a great change from my morning oatmeal keeps me full. You can always adjust amounts of items for your personal tastes/goals, but this combination is definitely a winner. Thanks for the great idea!

The idea sounds good, but I knew that black beans straight from the can won't have much flavor. So, I went ahead and sauteed some minced onions and garlic and half jalapeno pepper in some olive oil, added the beans and seasoned with some salt, pepper, cumin and some chopped cilantro. I also sprinkled some roasted Pepita seeds over the dish before serving. I served this and a Chia seed pudding for our weekend  breakfast and my family loved it!

This just hit different. I'm a poor college student right now, so this recipe was good to eat, easy to make, and cheap to buy ingredients for. This will be the reason i continue to support the black bean industry

Minor changes. Made some guacamole with the avocado and added a little mixed greens. I think this makes a great quick and healthy dinner.

GOOD carbs!  Good fiber and all-round nutrition too.  A riot of color!  Will repeat this one--it's a nice change from the typical eggs & bacon breakfast.

This was quick and delicious!  We had it for a light supper meal and loved it.   My husband doesn’t like salsa so for his bowl I put halved grape tomatoes. I also added a dollop of plain Greek yogurt to my bowl. Yum!

Have made this several times and I LOVE it! Added a few Tbsps of chopped green pepper and onion to the oiled pan before scrambling the egg, then followed the instructions completely. A wonderful breakfast or lunch. The taste and textures are super!

I don’t love beans but try to eat them because I know they’re healthy for me. That said, this was really good and a nice change to boring breakfasts. I spiced up the beans with cilantro, garlic, green onions, and jalapeños. Yummy meal any time of day.

My husband loved this dish and wouldn't change a thing. I have a texture issue with certain foods from time to time. In making this again, I would heat the black beans in some broth or something to make them softer. They were quite dry and fibrous and combined with the texture of the avocado, kind of was unappealing when I got toward the end of the bowl. That said, this was a very satisfying meal in the evening after a long day!

This was a great way to mix up my typical bland breakfast. Personally, I like my salsa spicy so I added an extra spicy pico de gallo, and it was fantastic. I actually really liked that it was mostly black beans rather than eggs. Will def make again and perfect my own flavor

This is DELICIOUS! Not to mention a snap to prepare, healthy, and the whole family loves it. I could actually eat this every day. The addition of a half tsp. or so of cumin to the black beans, and a sprinkle of cilantro at the end is the perfect touch to an excellent recipe... great combination of flavours!!!

Loved this recipe.  It was very quick, easy, and tasty.  I didn't have any avocado, so omitted that, and used "Cuban Style" black beans, as that is what I had on hand.  I sprinkled a little shredded cheddar and chopped green onions on top of each serving.  It made for a colorful, tasty meal.  I'll be making it again.

I added - 1/2 pack of bacon (diced and cooked with a little water).  Then I added black beans to the cooked bacon to warm the beans up at low heat for 5 min.
I cooked 5 eggs with a splash of tabasco, salt, pepper and onion powder.  I topped each plate with green onions, tomato, cilantro and jalapeño & served. Yummy!

My family loves beans, scrambled eggs, and avocado.  So it was a pleasant surprise to find this recipe.  Since I make black beans all the time, I used my seasonings.   But putting it all together in a bowl; absolutely fantastic.  Thank you Matt for your submission!!!!!!!

Despite the addition of spices to the beans, we found this to be just ok. The combination of beans and eggs just didn't work for us.  Thanks anyways.

Very simple and tasty.  Added some cilantro and extra salsa that was medium.

Was looking for something different and this fit the bill.  Did not have any avocado, so broiled some sliced tomatillo, which added to the flavor and cut down on calories.

My teenage son loves the black bean bowls. It's a quick and easy recipe and good anytime of day. Can be a meal or for teenagers a great hearty snack whenever they need it.

This is a very good low carb meal.  While the number of grams of carbohydrates seems large they do not  add a significant  amount to your recommended daily allowance.
