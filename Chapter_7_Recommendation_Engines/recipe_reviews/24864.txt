This really is a simple and delicious salad. There are a lot of variations possible. I substituted turkey bacon for the real bacon and added some shredded cheese. I doubleed the recipe to make a large dinner salad and served it with a loaf od french bread. My family scarfed it down.
Definately a "make-again".

So simple, yet so elegant. My only objection was the amount of bacon. I'm not much of a meat-eater, so I kept the bacon at 1/4 of a pound, and then doubled the rest of the recipe. I thought that it worked very well, having the crispness of the lettuce, carrot and bits of bacon, and the softness of the eggs and tomato. Definately something I'm going to make again.

Not sure why this received high reviews.  It was a dissapointment.
