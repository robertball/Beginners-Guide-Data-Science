Really yummy muffins! I don't have egg or diary allergies, but had all the ingredients and decided to give these a try. They were so good warm out of the oven, I "accidently" ate 3 right away! ;)  I followed the recipe exactly as written, using unsweetened applesauce and unsweetened almond milk and frozen blueberries. The muffins had the perfect amount of sweetness for me (I don't like things too sweet), and I took the recipe creator's suggestion to sprinkle a bit of turbinado sugar and cinnamon over the top.  This is a nice mid-day snack or complement to my egg white omelettes for breakfast.

Flavor's ok, but even though I baked 5+ extra minutes (to point where edges were getting too dark) mushy inside.  Applesauce may be good substitute for eggs if necessary, but if not, wouldn't bother in future.

These muffins are so moist and dense.  They are low sugar and still delicious

Made my own apple sauce, also skipped on the oil. Literally the best muffins I've ever had!
