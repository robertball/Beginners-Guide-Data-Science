I entered a meatloaf cooking contest at work and secretly entered with this recipe. I came in 2nd place and no one knew it was vegetarian! The secret is using fresh herbs (esp fresh sage, tarragon, and rosemary), the ketchup glaze mentioned in the comments below, and using the sausage style smart ground. Enjoy!

This was a big hit at a dinner party with many meat eaters & children too.  I have made it twice and plan to keep it in the favorite recipe category for the family!  I made a sauce out of ketchup, mustard and brown sugar for the top - Mostly ketchup,little mustard and little brown sugar. I also baked it in a loaf pan for 1 hr 15min.  GREAT recipe!  enjoy

My boyfriend thought he'd gone back to a school cafeteria when he was served the sauteed veg, mashed potatoes with onion gravy and the 'meat' loaf.  He doesn't like beef and I don't eat any meat and we both loved this!  Our dinner guest who eats meat thought it was real meatloaf, plates were nearly licked clean.  I used half Gimme Lean sausage and half beef and a whole bag of Quorn burger crumbles and cooked it in a loaf pan sans vegetables.  (froze the two halves of Gimme Lean for the next round)  I used 1 1/2 cups Japanese style panko bread crumbs instead of homemade as I'm used to putting crushed crackers in my meatloaf from the old days and the texture was perfect.  I only used a couple of ounces garlic and Italian spiced tomato sauce on the top and it was more than enough since it was in a loaf pan.

I was surprised at how great this turned out and how easy it was.  Instead of vegetarian ground beef and crumbles, I used what I had on hand -- 2 packages of Morningstar Sausage Crumbles, which has a little bit of spice to it already.  I also replaced the bread with Ritz crackers, but otherwise I think I followed the recipe exactly.  The vegetables were overdone, even though I added them half way through the cooking time, as other reviewers mentioned (I'll just cook them separately next time), but my fiance loved it, and I don't think I've ever had meatloaf this good, even before I was vegetarian.  My fiance and his cousins have asked me to make this for the main course at Thanksgiving dinner this year.

i made this meatloaf for my boyfriend [who is actually the vegetarian, not me], and he LOVED it.. which is the only reason i gave it a 3. instead of the tomato sauce, i used a tangy glaze [1/2 cup ketchup, 1 tsp mustard, 4 tsp brown sugar], and i took others advice and cut the worchestershire sauce down to 1 Tbsp instead of 2. however as much as my boyfriend went head over heals for it, i thought it was a little TOO "meaty" tasting, sort of like a plain veggie burger-taste. maybe more onion or spice would help out, but i probably wouldn't make this meatloaf again for myself.

I really liked this recipe!  I modified it a little bit by using bread crumbs instead of cubed bread and adding some spices I like such as onion powder and fresh garlic...it would be really easy to personalize this recipe with any spices you prefer!  I also made a glaze using ketchup, brown sugar and mustard.  I drizzled the veggies with olive oil and salt and pepper (instead of the spray) The texture was perfect!  I see no reason to make meatloaf with meat ever again!  It was so easy to make, too.  Very nice recipe...my boyfriend loved it, too!  We will definitely have this again...thank you!

This is the greatest vegetarian meatloaf recipe ever! I have been looking for a long time for something with the taste and texture of real meatloaf. Usually there is too much breadcrumbs or oatmeal, or the texture just doesn't work. I'm a diabetic vegetarian, so the amount of carbs in a dish is important. I made this last night and it was WONDERFUL. I used ketchup on the top like my mom did and I made it in a 5x9 loaf pan. We served it with mashed potatoes and roasted asparagus. YUMmee! I cannot wait to have a meatloaf sandwich for lunch today.

This was my first attempt at "fake" meatloaf. When I told my meat-eating boyfriend what I was making for dinner, he was pretty dubious. He said it was very good, even though it didn't quite taste like meat. The next night I found him eating the rest of it straight out of the pan!  Great basic recipe to build on. I made some changes to make it more like my mom's meatloaf, and didn't really measure anything. I made it in a loaf pan and skipped the veggies (I made mashed potatoes instead with Yukon Golds - yum!). I omitted the worcestershire sauce and mustard because I didn't have any on hand. I used corn flakes instead of bread cubes and ketchup instead of tomato sauce. I added a lot of ketchup to the mix as well as on top, which I think helped it be very moist inside, if somewhat crumbly. I added maybe half a large onion and several cloves of garlic that I smashed with a knife. Then for herbs I poured on a bunch of Bell's poultry seasoning till I thought it looked good. I followed the recipe on everything else.

I got my carnivore husband to eat a complete veg meal which speaks for itself.  I added zucchini, red pepper, grated parm, and tomato paste to the wet mix and a splash of balsamic to the tomato sauce.  Also subbed sausage Gimme Lean because that was all that Trader Joes carried, but am happy that I did.  Served with a side of marinara.

This recipe was great!  My vegetarian husband has never had meatloaf, and since it's one of my favorite foods I have been wanting to make him some for years.  I finally tried it with this recipe and I am so glad that I did!  It is now one of his new favorite foods and it's so good that even I didn't miss the meat at all.  It was kind of crumbly, but my regular meatloaf can be like that too sometimes so I'm not too bothered by it.  I made some changes based on what I could find in the store and to make it a little closer to my normal recipe.  I substituted Sausage flavored Gimmie Lean.  I used 1 1/2 cups crushed cheezits crackers instead of bread cubes.  I left out the sage and pepper and increased the garlic a little.  I used ketchup on the outside instead of tomato sauce, and mixed in a squirt of ketchup into the mix too.  I also cooked it without the roasted veggies because I didn't have space in the pan - I served it with mashed potatoes and a salad instead.

This is a must-have recipe if you like meatloaf and have a vegetarian in your household.  I added diced green, red, and yellow peppers, chopped mushrooms, minced garlic in place of the garlic powder, 1 cup bread crumbs instead of the cubed bread slices, dashes of thyme and parsley (basil and rosemary good too), and a tablespoon of brown sugar to the tomato sauce topping (ketchup glaze -- 1/2 cup ketchup, 1 tsp mustard, and 1 tbs brown sugar -- is good too).  Instead of placing carrots and potatoes around a formed loaf, I just added minced carrot to the mixture, pressed and baked the mixture in a large loaf pan for an hour and 15 minutes, and served it with mashed potatoes.  Mmmmm.  Moist and meaty.  It's a real winner/keeper for both me (a meat eater) and my husband (a vegetarian)!

So yummy! If you cant find veggie worschester than you can use steak sauce. I do it all the time. I  made a glaze for the top out of ketchup, mustard and brown sugar. I also made mini meatloafs so it would cook faster and get browner all over. yummy!

I tried this recipe for the first time with a group of thirty folks.  I multiplied it by 4 and it made two fabulous and beautiful "loafs"  Every bit was eaten in one sitting with this group!  I followed some of the suggestions regarding the topping (I used the one with ketsup and brown sugar) - and it looked and tasted great.  I also replaced the potatoes with broccoli and the cut carrots with the mini-carrots that are easily available in most grocery stores.    Though many in our group were NOT vegetarians, they all loved this dish and a few asked for the recipe.  Some had never even heard of the Gimme Lean "pretend meat".  By the way this recipe was very very easy, compared to many I have done with groups.  Thank you, Renee, for sharing this recipe.

Wow!  If I ever am craving that meat texture this would be my go to meatloaf.  Very, very good.  I added the sauce the others did.  It added a nice topping.  Plus instead of 2 slices of cubed bread, I added bread crumbs.  I added 1/3 c.  Next time I will add a little less.  Other than that I followed this recipe to the T.  Loved it.  My son really loved it too.  This one is going into my recipe box.

My husband asks me to cook this for dinner again and again.  I use Oroweat's Oat-Nut bread, and I substitute rosemary for sage.  Also, I toss the potatoes and carrots in some extra rosemary before tossing them in the pan.  Sooo yummy!

I've recently delved into the vegetarian world and really wanted to try this. But it came out a little off to me. This was the first time I ever used Soy Meat products, so there was definitely room for mistakes. Please help me out on this one, but my "Meat"loaf came out pretty crumbly. The "meat" wouldn't stay together. On top of that when I threw the potatoes and carrots along with the loaf, the veggies were still hard and uncooked, even after 45 minutes on one side then 45 on the other. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I must have made a mistake somewhere cause everyone else on here absolutely loves it...lol.

This recipe was a fantastic base that allowed me to put my own spin on it! I borrowed the brown sugar, mustard and ketchup glaze, I also put olive oil on the veggies and used mini red potatos. But I also added fresh basil, garlic and crimini mushrooms. It was very yummy and not too heavy.....I will definately make again!

This is definitely the best vegetarian meatloaf I've ever had. I've tried other recipes but this is the only one that actually feels and tastes like meatloaf. My husband is still a meat eater and he loves this recipe. The veggies can get dry, but if you put extra tomato sauce on them they stay moist. The best thing is that any leftovers can be made into sandwiches the next day (if there ARE any leftovers).

This was AWSOME!  I added minced mushrooms and used real garlic instead of the powder.   For the glaze, I used 1/2 cup of Ketchup, 1 Tablespoon of Honey flavoured BBQ sauce (since I don't have mustard) and 4 teaspoon of Brown sugar. It turned out to be amazing in taste!  Also, I only cooked it for 30 minutes TOTAL and that was plenty enough for my oven.. crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  MMMMM can't wait to have some more tomorrow :)

I don't cook with meat and have been craving meatloaf for quite awhile so I was pretty excited to try out this recipe. I turned out just okay, but it could be because I made a modification- I substituted bread crumbs for cubed bread. Also, I left out the surrounding carrots and potatoes and just made the meatloaf. If I make it again, I'll use mushroom gravy as an accompaniment.

Truly delicious!  I skipped the veggies since I had a different side dish planned - but the meatloak is fantastic.

This was really good!  I used Gimme Lean soysage and a bag of Boca burger crumbles.  I used a clove of fresh pressed garlic instead of powdered and used my mother's meatloaf sauce instead of tomato sauce.  It's basically ketchup, brown sugar and lemon juice.  I also added mushrooms, which I put on top of the loaf before pouring the sauce over it.

LOVED this! one of my fave meals is my mom's meatloaf so i was looking for something comparable but w/o the meat. never imagined i'd find it. i always check allrecipes 1st & once again, i found a winner here. 
like everyone else, i did a little customization due to pref or what was/not on hand.  i didn't have sage, so skipped it.  i will try onion powder next time as someone suggested. i kept pretty much everything else.  i did add half a can of Tomato Paste & "squished" some canned ones to thicken things up & add texture.  it worked great! next time i'll probably use the whole (little) can of paste.  i only used 1 bag of Morning Star soy crumbles and it worked out perfectly - i was afraid it wouldn't have enough "meat" but that wasn't the case at all.  next time i will add some Quorn Burger Crumbles though since we love their other products. topped mine w/ ketchup too since that's what i grew up with, but i'll try some of the suggestions here for mixes.
This taste just as good as mom's & i'm even reheating for lunch today which i NEVER do!

I made this for the first time tonight and wow!  I'm very pleasantly surprised!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, with only a few modifications:  My grocery store only had the Sausage Style Gimme Lean, so I used that and cut the sage down to 1/2 tsp.  I also added an extra egg just to be sure it held together.  I omitted the worchestshire sauce and planned to substitute it with soy sauce, but to my dismay, we were out!  It didn't matter...it tasted great without.  I also used plain breadcrumbs instead of cubed bread, and I tightly packed and baked this in a greased glass loaf pan for 1 hour.  I added a glaze of brown sugar, ketchup and honey mustard 1/2 way through cooking.  This received rave reviews from my family!  This is definitely a keeper, and I will make it again and again!  Thank you! After 20 years as a vegetarian, I've finally found an old favorite comfort food!    I think I will attempt to use a variation of this recipe for "meat"balls, and see how it comes out!

I tried this recipe and it turned out great! However instead of using the spices I tried a packet of meatloaf seasoning...=\ I didnt find veg. worcestershire sauce...or sage..next time I want to try this again with the original seasonings.

My husband is a vegetarian and I usually HATE the soy "burger" recipes and steer clear of them, but this one seemed to be worth a shot.  If I hadn't made it, I wouldn't have known it was "meatless."  My husband loved it and I really enjoyed it as well.  I couldn't find the vegetarian worsteshire sauce, so I found an alternative vegetarian steak marinade which worked well.  I also used egg beaters in place of real eggs, whole wheat bread, skim milk, and unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil to make more figure friendly.  I wouldn't cook with the vegetables again as they didn't cook well with the loaf.  The potatoes needed a little more time to cook and the carrots were completely raw. The "meat"loaf was GREAT though!!

Probably the best vegetarian meatloaf I've tried! I think mixing the Gimme Lean with the veggie crumbles really gives it a great texture.  I'm always looking for good ways to substitute meat in my diet and I think if you're a meatloaf lover like myself and looking for a healthy vegetarian option definitely give this a try!

I love this meatloaf.  I became vegetarian 4 months ago, and it has been a fairly easy transition.  However, I used to love meatloaf.  However, I did make change the topping from the tomato sauce to 1/2 cup ketchup, 4 tsp brown sugar, and 2 tsp mustard like others suggested.  So GOOD!  I also made mashed potatoes instead.  Such a great recipe.  It made my boyfriend very happy.  He has a harder time letting go of meat than I have.  Try this recipe!  I will be surprised if you regret it.

I have made this multiple times and it has turned out great. I have been able to tweak it for flavor and consistency. I found that the key to getting it to hold together is using one package of the refrigerated crumbles that are kind of sticky (found usually near the produce) and one package of frozen. I prefer to use a pkg of frozen sausage style crumbles along with the "beef," as it gives it more flavor. Dicing the onion up fine helps it soften as it cooks, and a bell pepper is good in there as well. I sub whole wheat bread crumbs and / or whole oats as a binder for the bread slices, and for speed, use organic ketchup for the topping. My boyfriend, a newer vegetarian, said it is better than any "real" meatloaf he has ever had. The roasted vegetables come out great if you drizzle them with a little olive oil and some fresh ground pepper.

I am a new vegetarian, but got a craving for meatloaf!   this was really tasty!!    I did a few things differently, such as use like 4-5 cloves of real garlic..  I used one piece of bread and a cup or so of store bread crumbs.. I think next time I will just use the real bread :)   I accidentally added the whole package of Gimme Lean beef, so maybe that's why mine was mushy? -probably also the bread crumbs..    I also used the ketchup/mustard/sugar glaze for mine.    I also took another reviewers advice and sauteed the onion for a few minutes so they were soft and fragrant!   other than that, I followed the recipe- oh! I didn't use the veggies.. just put the loaf in a bread loaf pan and made mashed potatoes!!!  I have been a vegetarian for almost a whole month, and I haven't felt this satisfied since I started!   it almost tasted and had the texture of meat!  so cool!! :)

This was without a doubt the best vegetarian meatloaf I have ever tried.  I made a few changes by adding about 1 1/2 cups chopped baby bella mushrooms, I used 3/4 c bread crumbs instead of bread, I also added about a cup of shredded carrots and the ketchup/brown sugar/mustard glaze.  I didn't do veggies around the loaf, I had steamed broccoli tips drizzled with raspberry basalmic vinigar instead.  I cooked it in a bread loaf pan for 1 hour 15 min.  These changes also reduced the calorie count a little and let me divide it into 8 servings. Yay!

The ultimate question is "Will my meat eating husband eat it?"  The answer is "Yes...and ask for seconds."  Other than that, all was good as is.  I used a non-stick loaf pan to create the loaf and then turned it upside down so it fell into the baking dish already formed in a loaf!  Easy way to create the right shape...and it stayed that way and did not break apart until the second day of leftovers when there was only a little bit left.  Thanks!

Very good. My wife gave it a 10. Had the Gimme Lean Sausage type instead of Beef type, so I left out the sage.

Impressive! My dad, who has high cholesterol and triglycerides, loves his beef and scorns vegetarian food. I made this for him without saying it was vegetarian, and he raved about it... in fact, he likes it more than my mom's real meatloaf!! I used more than half a 14 oz package of Gimme Lean sausage, along with 10 oz of Boca burgers, thawed and crumbled, for the 12 oz burger crumbles, and I reduced the ground sage to 1/4 tsp. I also added some onion powder, ground thyme, white pepper, and a sprig of fresh rosemary (chopped). Also used a ketchup topping as suggested by others (1 C ketchup, 1 tsp mustard, 2 tbsp brown sugar) and cooked in 9x5 loaf pan (no need to spray). I roasted my veggies in a separate pan, putting them in the oven with 15 min left for the meatloaf. Then, I raised the oven temp to 450 to finish off the veggies as the meatloaf rested for 15 min.

WOW!!! This is excellent!! I made a few minor changes. I used the sausage variety of Gimme Lean, used basil in place of sage, and used ketchup instead of tomato sauce. It came out hearty and delicious! You won't be disappointed with this recipe. I would recommend seasoning and putting butter or oil on the veggies though, instead of just cooking spray. Mine came out very dry...still good, just dry.

My husband and I enjoyed this. I subbed ground flax for the eggs, panko for the cubed bread. I added sauteed grated carrot and green pepper (cooked the onion, too)  chopped mushrooms, about 1/4 cup freshly grated asiago to the mix and used jarred pasta sauce instead of milk. Basically like I made meatloaf 30 years ago. A nice change from the regular lentil or bean loaf I usually make. I used the ketchup/brown sugar/mustard on top (I'd never tried that before and liked it.) I think BBQ sauce might be a good topping, too.  I made 1-1/2 times the recipe and baked in two bread pans. Mine did not fall apart. I didn't roast the vegetables, but served it with scalloped potatoes, salad, and peas. Good comfort food!

This recipe is great and hearty for the whole family.  I make a tasty topping that is to-die-for:  equal parts of water, brown sugar and ketchup (as much as you think you would like) pour over the top when baking in a loaf or casserole pan - makes a GREAT glaze!  I have to fight the kids to keep them from taking more than what is on the top of their serving :)

This is delicious. I used a tomato sauce with garlic, oregano & basil already in it and accidently mixed the sauce IN the loaf instead of putting it on top. It only made it better. Very moist. will make this again very soon. Thanks for a great meatless meatloaf!!!

I've made this over and over for my vegetarian husband. It's so yummy. He always requests it. You won't miss the meat at all. I don't use tomato sauce. Instead I use a glaze of 1/2 cup ketchup, 4 tsp brown sugar, 2 tsp mustard. I think this really makes a difference and gives it that sweetness and tang you get from meat meatloaf. It's really the best veg meatloaf I've tried or made. We are only 2 people and this recipe is enough to have all week long. It's so good as leftovers, although it can get a little dry (probably why the recipe says to use tomato sauce). Tip, if you are using frozen crumbles, let them warm up a bit. I'm always in pain mixing this w/ my hands 'cuz it's so cold. Lol. Enjoy!

I've never been a meatloaf fan, but it's my boyfriend's favorite.  Since he's only a vegetarian because we live together, I do my best to make vegetarian meals reminiscent of what he's been accustomed to eating.  This meatloaf was a hit!  I thought since we'd have leftovers we could eat it for dinner the following night.  

When I arrived home he asked, "So what's for dinner tonight?"  
I said, "Oh, I thought the leftover meatloaf."  
He said, "Yeah... About that... I ate the other half of the pan today for lunch."

I veganized this by using unsweetened soy milk and flax meal eggs.  Even though I cooked it a bit longer, some of the onions hadn't softened.  The next time I will saute them first but I thought it was really great.  I also used ketchup on top - my husband likes it this way.  This is a keeper in my estimation.

This was DElishious!  I did have to make a few changes because I didn't have everything on hand.  I used 1 pkg. of boca crumble  and 4 boca sausage patties, onion powder instead of onions, and did not have any vegetarian worch. sauce.  (I'm going to have to track that down because I had no idea it exsisted!)  This was a very filling dinner, and the leftovers are even better the next day.  I'm going to try it out on some of my meat eatting friends and get their opionion, but in our book it's a winner!

I've been vegetarian for 16 years so I don't really remember how meatloaf tastes, but this is a great tasting recipe that my husband who just recently became vegetarian said does indeed taste like meatloaf.  The only issue is it does fall apart and I'm not sure how to correct that problem.  I followed the directions exactly except used the 1/2 c ketchup, 2 tsp mustard and 4tbs brown sugar topping instead of tomato sauce.  I found that the extra salt called for in the recipe makes it a bit too salty.  Both my kids liked it so it gets 5 stars from me, but I would've given it a 4 for taste and texture.  I also used mashed potatoes and steamed carrots to save cooking time so it ended up only needing 30 min. total.  Overall, good winter time recipe, very savory.

I've been making this from this recipe for a long time, it is a staple for holidays. My meat-eating inlaws devour this!  A few adjustments to make it vegan:  I use NRG egg replacer instead of eggs, drop the worchestershire sauce, and use soy or almond milk. It is fabulous!

Love the flavor of this "meatloaf".  I choose to use a hearty grainy bread for the cubed bread in the recipe.

Everyone loved this dish. Meat eaters said it was the best meatloaf they'd had and asked for the recipe.   Slight changes taken from other reviewers:  - 1 tbsp. Worcesteshire rather than 2 tbsp. 1 1/2 C. Whole wheat breadcrumbs rather than making own with bread. 2 cloves fresh garlic rather than garlic salt. Used tangy sauce topping - Ketchup, mustard, brown sugar. Rather than tomato sauce.

We were very pleased with this recipe.  I am giving it 4 stars because I didn't follow it exactly.  I omitted the vegetables and the tomato sauce.  Instead I put 1/2 cup of chili sauce in the bottom of a loaf tin and then added the meatloaf (I pressed the loaf in attempts to avoid crumbling during slicing).  I also added fresh tarragon, rosemary and sage.  I used others suggestions and went down to 1 tbls of Worcestershire sauce.  After cooking I let it sit for 15 minutes as suggested and then popped it out on a serving plate.  It came out perfect.  Some slices did crumble a little, but nothing to complain about.  I will make this meatloaf again!

Hands down one of the best meals since becoming a vegetarian (9 months ago). I didn't ad ANY spices (other than salt and pepper) it was STILL wonderful! My kids LOVED IT and even my meat-eating/vegetarian-food-hating husband said it tasted like the real deal! I used a very simple brown sugar and ketchup glaze on top (like I did with 'real' meatloaf) and it was scrumptious. Can't wait to make it again! Thank you for the great recipe!!!

Good recipe but I would use twice the amount of tomato sauce and add garlic and butter to the roasted vegetables.  Otherwise it was a wonderful addition to our favorites.

This turned out wonderfully!  My b/f (not a vegetarian) said it could prob pass for regular meatloaf.  I halved the recipe and used fresh garlic and sage.  It is fine as is, but next time I will experiment with more  fresh herbs and spices (maybe some parsley and thyme?).  The only drawback, nothing to do with its flavor, is that it did not pass the slicing test.  It was less of a loaf and more of a crumble.  Thank you for this recipe!

My family loved this, even my non-vegetarian husband, who is suspicious of these kinds of recipes. I followed the recipe pretty closely first time. Am making it today again and might modify slightly just to experiment. It honestly does taste like "meat" loaf!!

I followed the recipe exactly but used the sausage gimme lean. It was just okay. I think it would of been better with a good faux burger crumble and a different topping. With some teaks I am sure it could  be very good.

This meatloaf came out very good and my meat-eater fiance told me that it was just as good as, and tasted very close to, "traditional" meatloaf.  I did make a few minor tweaks to the recipe, but mostly just based on personal preference.  First, I couldn't find the fake ground beef at the store so I used the fake ground sausage instead, which added a nice flavor but made the loaf just a tiny bit too salty for my taste. (So, if I use the sausage again, I will definitely cut down on the salt in the recipe.)  I also sauteed the onions before adding (to cut down on the crunchiness) and substituted ketchup for the tomato sauce.  (The ketchup contrasted nicely with the savory flavor of the meatloaf.) Those were the only minor changes made, though, and I feel that this is a great recipe for anyone craving the taste of a traditional meatloaf.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was delicious! I'm only giving it 4 stars and not 5 because I made a few changes- I used the tangy sauce on top, as other reviewers suggested, Ritz crackers instead of bread, and increased the amount and variety of spices- I included summer savory, a bit of cumin, a bit of cayenne, as well as smoked paprika and fresh garlic. The texture is just right, and I think it will make a great sandwich tomorrow! I will be making this again, for sure.

This was very good and a nice change of pace for a family that hasn't eaten meat in over 10 years.  I did substitute 2tbsps ground flax seeds and water for the two eggs but followed the recipe otherwise.  I would definitely make it again both as written and/or with variations.

I'm not a vegetarian, but was looking for a lower calorie and healthier alternative to meatloaf - this was great! I loved the sage, would probably try the sausage style meat substitute next time as someone else suggested. Great meat texture and flavor. This receipe should satisfy anyone who is craving meatloaf - thank you for the great recipe!

This super hit the spot when I was craving "mom" food.  I ditched the roasted veggies on the side and made mashed potatoes and green beans instead.  I nixed the Worcestershire sauce and spiced it up with a little french onion soup mix and a little bit of soy sauce (which just makes it taste a little meatier).  Instead of morningstar crumbles I used dry tvp that I reconstituted - the meatloaf didn't brown so great as a result, it looked quite pink but it was delicious regardless.  Yum!

We loved this recipe! We substituted the sausage style gimme lean and used both bredcrumbs and bread cubes. We found the vegetables to be on the dry side as well so decided the second time to bake the meatloaf in a standard loaf pan and cook the vegetables on the side. Wonderful. I will use this often.

This recipe was greeted with rave reviews!  My housemates were head over heels for the meat-like texture and saltiness of this meatloaf.  Ours didn't turn out dry at all.  It was actually very juicy... perfect.  I've never had meatloaf before, but I was told that this is as close as you could probably get.  Great recipe; I have no doubt i'll be using it again.

I really, really liked this meatloaf.  I did read some of the other suggestions/reviews and used a few of the changes.  I used the ketchup mixture instead of tomato sauce and I used a 10oz package of stuffing mix, mostly consisted of bread crumbs.  I would make it the same way again.  Delicious thank you Renee!  

Although the only other change I would make next time is that I would not cook the veggies with it.  They came out dry and not to my liking.  I'd rather make mashed potatoes and steamed veggies as the sides.  Thank you!

I gave this 3 stars because of the changes. Mixing "gimme lean" with burger crumbles provides just the right consistency, but I made many other changes. It needs more flavor (garlic and herbs), and I used panko breadcrumbs instead of cubes. I tried cooking with the vegetables around the meatloaf and they dried out and did not work at all. I now make then separately. Tomato sauce on top is far too bland, so I use a good jar of marinara or some homemade sauce instead.

My 11-year son seemed to not hate it, which is about as good a rating as you can get from him.  But I did not. My expectations were high going into the tasting, and unfortunately it didn't come close to what I had hoped for. It was partly the taste and partly the consistency.  I had to add a lot of bread crumbs to get it more solid.  I'm not a great cook, so perhaps the problem is me!

I've never written a review on here before but I just had to for this.  My sister, mom and I are all vegetarian.  I decided to try this recipe yesterday and it is FANTASTIC.  I followed it exactly except for the glaze which I used around 1/2 cup ketchup, a squirt of mustard, and a little brown sugar as other users suggested. I also used 3 teaspoons fresh minced sage instead of dry ground. It turned out moist and stayed together perfectly.  I baked it for an hour and 20 minutes and it turned out perfectly golden brown.  I think those who are having problems with it being too crumbly should use the cubed bread instead of bread crumbs.  It tasted even better than real meatloaf! We were amazed! Thanks for the keeper!

Based on all the glowing reviews I must have done something wrong.  I prepared this for my daughter who is a vegetarian and I followed the directions exactly and neither of us liked it.  

All is not lost however - I'm going to recycle the meatloaf it into a pot of vegetarian Chile and the vegetables into Stew!

this was pretty good the only problem i had was that it fell apart but it was still yummy i did make a few changes to it that might be why. i only used half an onion in the loaf it seemed like a lot with just the half so i put the other half around the loaf with the potatoes and carrots and i couldnt find vegetarian worcertershire sauce but since i am a vegetarian that eats fish it wasnt a problem. i used almond milk instead of cows milk and i used the ketchup glaze (ketchup, dry mustard and brown suger) inside and on top of the the loaf

Because I could only find meatless crumbles, this didn't hold together well. It was still just okay.

ok, so its still in the oven, but I couldn't resist taking a tiny bite. SO delicious! I used two packages of veggie crumbles, and used regular bread crumbs. I found a recipe for home made vegan worchesershire sauce, and used that. I put catsup in the meatloaf itself, instead of on top(thats how my mom used to make it). I ended up using a little more "worchestershire sauce" than the recipe called for, but I cut back on the salt in it, so the flavor is amazing. I didn't have any carrots, so I am only roasting potatoes along side it. I can't wait til dinner!

This was superb!  I cut it half, except for eggs, garlic power and bread cubs.  Added some fresh cilantro.  My very picky grandson loved it also.

This is a great recipe.  I'm always searching for good vegetarian recipes that would satisfy my taste as well as my husband's who is not a vegetarian.  We both love this recipe!  No changes needed, it is perfect!

This was o.k.  If you're looking for a very "meaty" tasting meatloaf, you'll probably like it. I was hoping for more than just a ground beef taste. But not too bad.

It was ok. Nothing great. I followed it exactly and it turned out a little dry. Plus it uses so much fake meat that it gets a little pricey.

This veggie meatloaf was good. We followed the directions except using a different combo of veggie meat. I really like the idea of baking veggies at the same time as a veggie loaf, it makes the sides easy. It did however crumble a lot and using so much veggie meat can get pricey. Overall, I have tried other veggie loafs I liked better such as the cottage cheese roast on this website and will use those in the future.

This recipe turned out pretty well. I didn't have the vegetarian worsteshire sauce, so I used soy sauce. I also used egg replacer to make it vegan. I also used ketchup instead of tomato sauce. It tasted pretty good, would make again.

This recipe was very good. I used four slices of bread (crumbs), soy milk and no eggs and actually forgot to put the onions in...ooops. Everyone seemed to like this recipe but thought the sage was a little strong, so next time  I will reduce the amount of sage. Definitely a keeper, thanks for  posting.

This was delicious, and a big hit with my meat eating husband. I also used the ketchup/brown sugar sauce on top and cooked it in a loaf pan without the vegetables. I will definitely make this again. 
My only complaint is that the loaf was very crumbly -- we had to use a spoon to get it out. Maybe I should add another egg next time?

Hated it.  And I'm a vegetarian and regularly cook with meat substitutes and love them.  But didn't like this recipe at all.  Maybe it's for the 'meat' lovers who are looking for something that 'resembles' the meat dishes they like.

This is very good, and for a vegetarian, the next best thing to the meatloaf that I remember from many years ago.   To mimic that old recipe, I put a little ketchup on the top.

The Worcestershire sauce taste was way too strong for me.  I would recommend cutting it in half (to 1 T) (or less than that, even).

Kids didn’t like it but they don’t like anything. Adults liked it a lot .  I didn’t add enough bread crumbs  or cook vegetables with it. Baked potatoes, broccoli and salad on the side..  Very good, needed the  extra bread crumbs.

I LOVE this recipe so much. When I met my boyfriend three years ago,  I told him my favorite meal growing up was my grandma's meatloaf. (I've now been vegetarian about six years) Not long into our relationship, he surprised me by preparing this for us and I thought it was the sweetest gesture. I now make double the recipe as meal prep for us all the time. It really mimics what I remember of my childhood favorite - and it's so simple to make! I used sourdough bread for the cubes and found it easier to mix the carrots and potatoes in oil, salt and pepper in a bowl before pouring them around the loafs for a little extra flavor.

I followed the recipe and I became a bit worried when I struggled a bit to create the form.  (I’ve made plenty of meatloafs in the past and all were more moist than this mixture.). In the end, the result was excellent - moist and delicious!  I did add a little mixture of ketchup and mustard (no brown sugar since I didn’t have any) to serve as a glaze.

I thought this was delicious.  The only change I made was I omitted the mustard.   Also sprinkled a little salt on the veggies.
Has anyone ever made this with an egg substitute?

The best meatloaf recipe, hands down. I've made it in a loaf pan, muffin tins and per the directions. I don't use sage or tomato sauce. For the glaze, I make a mix of ketchup, mustard and brown sugar. I use breadcrumbs instead sliced bread as well. I also use the whole package of the gimme lean and crumbles.

This is the exact same recipe that is on the LightLife website.

 I had high hopes for this but it's just not that great. This recipe sent me out looking for the roll of 'meat' to make a meatloaf and other 'meat' dishes with. The taste leaves a lot to be desired. While crumbles are bland, this tastes like stronger veggie burger patties in a roll. 

Yay for me, because I bought 4 rolls. I am thinking that it will make a better meat fried rice than meatloaf.

My meatloaf stuck to the pan even though I greased it. Once you got it out of the pan, it fell apart. Texture of a meatloaf is closer with this than lentils, but I prefer the lentils. Maybe that's because I've been using lentils since the 80's. I won't be making this again. 

When giving up meat, there are just some things that need to be let go, and meatloaf is definitely one of them!

I’m not a huge fan of “meatloaf”,but my family loves it. This is the best recipe I’ve tried though. I’ve made it twice. The first time was (almost) as written. The second I didn’t include the bread or milk, but sautéed mushrooms, onion, and garlic instead. I personally enjoyed the original recipe better in consistency. The bread makes it lighter and keeps it together nicely. Saying that, the mushrooms added a really nice flavor. Maybe next time I’ll do both. I also added lots of fresh garlic and spread a ketchup/datil pepper sauce on top instead of tomato sauce the 2nd time. It really worked! Thanks for the recipe

Excellent recipe!  My son, who is a picky eater, and my meat eating relatives all loved it!  I used 3/4 cup panko bread crumbs instead of the bread to avoid it getting pasty/gummy.  I also used fresh sage and made a glaze with ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar instead of the tomato sauce.  For the veggies, I drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled a bit of rosemary and thyme for added flavor.  Baked it 45 minutes covered to retain moisture and last 15 minutes uncovered.

Ok....I need to to totally honest here, as I hate when people change a posted recipe and rate it according to how it turns out AFTER they have altered it. I have been guilty of this myself. So, that being said I have rated this recipe 5 stars do to it's brilliant "base" that was used to adapt for a "vegan" meatloaf by my daughter (she is vegan and some of the ingredients in this recipe are not vegan friendly). I truly believe that this recipe MUST taste as fabulous as our vegan version did. Thank you for the inspiration! Our vegan meatloaf turned out soooo good that my meat eating husband even said it was good! (I posted our vegan version in case anyone wants to try it out - Vegan Meatloaf)

Love this meatloaf, but we have a daughter with celiac disease so I have to replace the bread with gluten free and that mean less stickiness. So, I do a full four slices of gluten free bread and add an extra egg. I also sprinkle some Italian seasoning on top of the tomato sauce. My family absolutely loves this!

Phenomenal! Seriously, scarily like real meat. My markets don't carry Gimme Lean so I use a combo of the Lightlife crumbles and Beyond Beef crumbles (in the freezer aisle). The Beyond Beef crumbles are a little bigger which add a nice change of texture. I used the AWESOME tip from one comment about crumbled Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs, which also allows me to omit any extra salt. I use about 1.75 stacks. After making this recipe a few times, my final version also includes these other tweaks: an extra teaspoon of fresh herbs (sage+tarragon+rosemary+thyme), a pat of softened butter folded into the loaf mixture to mimic animal fat, and that ketchup+mustard+brown sugar glaze from another reviewer. Every single person I feed this to loves it, even meat-eaters!

I'm a vegetarian, and I thought this was just all right, but my bf who loooovees meat thought it was very delicious. I used bread crumbs instead of bread and veggie sausage instead of "burger crumbles" since I don't know what that is.

I have been trying to come up with a veggie meatloaf for sometime with little success. This meatloaf is without a doubt the best ever! I am sooo happy.

Yum. I subbed store-bought, veggie Worcestershire for soy sauce, garlic, pepper, ginger, and apple cider vinegar. I also can't help but add LOTS of tomato sauce on top.

I was pleasantly surprised. I am not a vegetarian or vegan person and I do love a good meatloaf. This is not bad at all and I would not know it did not have meat in it. I did not alter the recipe but if I make it again, I definitely would use fresh garlic and green peppers and add more salt and pepper. The vegetables are very good too but definitely needs some S/P. Really surprisingly good.

OMG!!
This was soo good... as usual i tasted a small piece and.... before I knew it I had eaten 2 slices. (Before I served it for dinner) lol
I used only the Gardein beefless grounds and no worcestershire, used an additional egg, fresh red onions.  I also  added tri-colored peppees, uses fresh garlic and both sage & onion stuffing cubes and italian bred crumbs.  Squeezed about 2 tbs of ketchup into the mix as well and some crushed red peper.  
Really had a beefy texture and tast.  My meet eating husband asked for seconds!   Seeved with scalloped potatoes and veggies.

Great base, used 1/2 sausage and 1/2 ground beef by Gimme Lean to make the 7 ounces of packaged vegatarian ground beef and used Gardien crumbles, got rid of a handful as the recipe called for 12 oz, this had 13.2! I also used 4 slices of bread as what would I do with the 1/2? It was a small slice of bread, a 40 calerie per slice one. I added some tomato sauce in with the mix, about 1/2 the 8 oz can. The rest I poured on the bottom of the casserole pan, after I Pam'd it. I like tomatoey meatloaf. I also used spicy mustard from the fridge as I was not sure if the mustard was dried or the one in the fridge! I guess prepared meant already made mustard? I used Guldens and did not measure, just two good squirts. I also made the catsup, brown sugar and a few more squirts of Guldens for the topping. I had it in a 9" square casserole and baked for 55 minutes and let stand. I put the veggies in a separate dish with a little olive oil. Sorry meatloaf has to have mashed potatoes as a side so made those too. Next time I will add minced garlic but all in all, this one is a keeper. Froze two pieces for later..see how veggie meatloaf stands up to reheating! I'm new at cooking with soy products.

This was a great recipe and even my meat-eatting boyfriend said it was just like the real thing.  My only thing was it felt to heavy for me.  Overall a great recipe.  I will probably and in some more veggies next time.

This was AMAZING!  Never made veg meatloaf and it was killer.  I about halved the recipe and used only one package of Smart Ground, added extra onions, subbed the worcestershire for my fave teriyaki marinade and doubled the amount of that, and used a cup or so of bread crumbs instead of cubes.  I put marinara with a dash of teriyaki on top, put fingerlings and onions around it in the pan, and baked it for an hour and 15 minutes.  With a little ketchup it had my perfect amount of sweetness with an incredible meaty taste and moist, yet formed consistency!  Can't wait to make sandwiches out of the leftovers tomorrow.  Will make this for my next potluck, too!

Delicious "fake meat" type meatloaf. I cooked the carrots and potatoes separately. My only changes (due to what I had at home) were: Increased mustard to 2 Tbs, omitted Worcestershire sauce and used 2 tsp Sriracha sauce instead. This added a nice mild to medium spice level. And, I used catsup instead of tomato sauce on top. Delicious - would love to make again!

I printed this recipe in 2004 and I have been making it ever since!  Vegetarian and non-vegetarian alike enjoy this.  I use the Gimme Lean Sausage style "meat", but otherwise, prepare it as the recipe states.  Thanks Renee!

Used gimme lean sausage and 1pkg yves no gmo meatless ground. Did soy sauce instead of worcestershire. Used a cup crushed oyster crackers instead of bread. Used variation of tangy glaze with more sugar.  Didn’t beat eggs. Put in casserole dish and did not make veggies. Cooked with potatoes au gratin for 1:10. 

Wow, really good. A tiny bit dry (forgot the milk) and could have been greasier imo. The sauce was still saucy/gooey on top not crispy. The crackers were dry not mushy. Good flavor. We all had seconds. I had more for lunch the next day-still good. Did not have a tendency to fall apart.

My family loved this... I usually believe in trying a recipe the way it is before I alter it, but I was actually out of tomato sauce so I made my own glaze - 1/2 cup of Ketchup, 5 TB of Brown Sugar, 2 TB of Sun dried Tomatoes and 2 tsp of Sriracha sauce...  Pretty creative hunh?  It was amazing.

Both my husband and I enjoyed this thoroughly.  I added fresh herbs including sage, rosemary and marjoram(about 2 tsp each), 2 cloves of fresh garlic (smashed and chopped), about 1.5 cups of breadcrumbs and topped with a ketchup/mustard/brown sugar glaze.  I used a combo of 1 pkg Yves meatless ground and 1/2 pkg morningstar crumbles and it was quite tasty.  The crumble pieces were bigger than the meatless ground and I think mixed together it gave it a nice meat-like texture (still not like ground beef of course).  I put it together the night before and my husband threw it in the oven the next day so it would be done by the time I got home from work.  I love coming home and dinner is already made!! (although I noticed it was grazed on before I got home)  I don't think I would roast the veggies with the meatloaf next time since they were way overcooked and tasted dry and chewy.  Some garlicky mashed potatoes would be much better!  This recipe is definitely worth trying and I will make again!  Thanks!
