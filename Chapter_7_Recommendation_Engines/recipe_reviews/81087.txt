Extremely flavorful.  I did use 1 1/2" thick chops so that instead of butterflying, I could cut a pocket in the side.  It keeps all that wonderful filling in the chops where it belongs.  Instead of using toothpicks to hold the pockets close, use a piece of spaghetti, it falls apart when the chops are done.  Browned the chops on the stovetop, then placed in the oven at 325 for 45-60 minutes.  Made a pan sauce with browned bits by adding 1/2 cup of white wine, chicken stock and 1 tbls cold butter.

These were a nice and different alternative to the usual pork chop.  For the filling I did as others sugg and added in alittle of cream cheese and a spoonful or two of sourcream(had both on hand)to hold together better.  Also I added in some diced garlic & onion, and fresh parmesan and did half feta and half blue cheese.  This is a perfect filling to just go in the fridge and use up things you have left over and need to use up.  I stuffed into butterflied bone-in pork chops since that's the ones I bought and dipped them in flour and fried in olive oil to brown on each side and baked covered for 40 minutes or so.  Very good.

Awesome!  A couple things I noticed: you do not need to add salt, the blue cheese gives it enough and you can always add it later; and I used center cut thick pork chops and these needed about 40-50 minutes to cook completely.  These were really really good!

Made this for myself and 3 guys, and we all loved it! I used green onion instead of chives, and used half feta cheese and half blue cheese. I added extra bacon and flattened the pork chops before filling them. I also browned both sides of the chops in the bacon grease and added pepper and garlic salt to both sides. I had then in the oven for 40 mins and used skewers to hold the sides together. Will definitely make this one again!

Per one of the suggestions I added some pecans and one chopped granny smith apple to the filling.  I also added a few tablespoons of cream cheese to help the filling stick together.  I grilled the pork chops for about 7 minutes each side over medium high direct heat instead of baking.  They were really well received.  I served them with roasted garlic mashed potatoes.  I would make these again, its a 'guest worthy' recipe.

This was delicious!!!...I made it for my boyfriend and he loved it.  I did modify the recipe like most people said: half blue cheese and half feta. I substituted chives with green onions and I seared the chops to make them nice and golden before I put them in the oven.  I will definitely do them again.

Fantastic!  Like the other reviews stated, it took about double the cooking time.  Didn't add the pecan/apple mixture, and it was great without.  Don't add salt - doesn't need it, but did sprinkle the tops of each chop with garlic powder and fresh ground pepper.  Served with roasted potatoes and veggies.

This is very good, but has very strong flavor. I added 2 TBSP of cream cheese and used only 2 oz of blue cheese for my 1 lb of pork chops. If you dont like strong flavored cheese, do not try this or change the cheese for feta. Otherwise nice way to use up blue cheese out of fridge.

Very, very good, my son 13 loved it as well as DH.  I used Feta instead of Blue Cheese (had it on hand) Very good, very tender and flavorful.  Kept stuffed thick chops in the oven for a full hour at 325*.  Great Recipe!!

These are very good pork chops.  My husband absolutely loved them.  I was surprised that I enjoyed them as well considering I am not a blue cheese fan (at all!)  I did make some up with feta cheese in place of the blue chhese and these were also good, although I don't think they were quite as flavorful.  I will definately make again.  Thanks!

Amazing! I used some pork scallopini that I had and just put some filling (subbing green onion for the chives) and a little shredded mozz. and rolled it up (tying them to keep them closed). Seasoned them w/ s, p and garlic powder and browned them in some evoo. I moved them to a baking dish, and to the drippings I added 8oz. of fresh mushrooms that I chopped, some minced garlic and 1 Tbsp. butter. Let that cook a few mins. then added about 1/2 cup white wine. Simmered that for a few and added another Tbsp. of butter to finish it off. I poured this over the roulades, covered and baked them @ 350 for about 30 mins. Uncovered and baked about another 5-10 mins. until it reached the proper temp. All through dinner the only thing hubby kept saying was 'Mmmmm, this is REALLY good', and it was! I know I did a few things differently, but I did use all of the ingredients called for and just put my own spin on it. I will def be making this again and again! Thanks for sharing. :)

These were fabulous!  I used 1 1/2 inch thick Pork Loin chops so I baked in the oven for 1 hour @ 350 degrees.  After reading reviews, I decided to use feta cheese.  I cooked up 4 slices of Applewood thick smoked bacon and crumbled.  I used a tablespoon of sour cream and a tablespoon of chive and onion cream cheese to the feta.  I browned the chops in the bacon grease for one minute and then stuffed the chops and placed in the preheated oven.  Yummy.....

The reviewers weren't kidding when they said the blue cheese was overpowering. For my two big pork chops, the recipe yielded enough stuffing for at least four chops. (I threw the extra away, and I really hate wasting food.) I wasn't a fan of these and I wound up scraping out 90% of the filling and eating the chops that way and I still felt gross afterward. My fiance is not a huge fan of blue cheese and thought they were decent, but I doubt I will make this recipe again. I would be willing to give it another shot if I used swiss and cream cheese to make up for the blue cheese. If you LOVE blue cheese, you might love these, but if you're on the fence, keep looking.

This was very good.  I'm giving it 5 starts for flavor, but the cooking time was off quite a bit.  My pork chops were not very thick at all and this took about 35 minutes for them to cook, I also turned the heat up to 350 to help move it along.  The flavor of the blue cheese, bacon & chives was heavenly!  This was easy to make yet was so elegant.  We'll have this again. Thank you for a yummy dinner!

This was super good!!!  Did sub 2/3 feta for the blue cheese as my boyfriend doesn't like blue cheese-- I did sneek about an ounce of blue cheese in with out telling him-- next time I will go  half feta and half blue as I loved the blue cheese flavor.  He still raved, and all but licked his plate!  The chops tased super good, but they came out pale and unattractive, so I will probably brown the chops before baking next time, as other reviewers suggested, just to get the nice brown color.... other than that, super recipe, thanks!!

Yum Yum Yum. If your having hesitations on whether to make this or not, DO IT. It was wonderful! I was worried listening to some of the comments but I thought it was great. I did make a few adjustment per some advice:

In a bowl I mixed herb flavored FETA cheese, chopped green onions, and crispy bacon (cooked crispy in skillet and hand crumbled). To that I added some sour cream (just enough to hold the mixture together making it easier to stuff)and a little melted butter. I seasoned the butterfly chops with ground pepper and then coated one side with egg using a brush. In a bag (ziploc is fine) I put pork bread crumbs that I got at the grocery store for about $1, then placed the chops individually in the bag and shook enough to coat lightly. Don't worry if the other side is coated with crumbs a little. Then I placed on baking sheet (breaded side down) and spooned feta mixture on chops. I folded the chops over and placed about 4 toothpicks on perimeter of chops to hold in stuffing. Baked @ 350 for about 45-50 minutes. No worries if cheese starts to melt out of chops. These were perfect. Perfect Perfect. Served with long grain wild rice and rolls. My dad loved it. Will make for boyfriend soon.

Wonderful way to cook a pork chop.  We had company the night I made these, so I had to adjust the cheeses to everyone's liking.  I made mine as written with the bleu cheese crumbles, 2 were made with feta cheese and 1 with fresh mozzarella cheese.  The rest of the ingredients were used in each pork chop.  Rather than use a toothpick, I have kitchen twine (Christmas gift from apple.streudel) that I tied each pork chop with to hold the insides in.  The results were a moist pork chop with incredible fillings.  So glad I have a few more thick chops in the freezer to make these again.

Pretty good! I used a combination of half blue cheese, and half italian blend cheese. I also seared the pork chops first before baking. Will make these again!

This is such a great recipe.We had this for second Christmas day dinner with guests and it was liked by everyone.We followed the suggestions of some other reviewers and substitued some of the blue cheese with feta.We also used pork loin instead of pork chops.It turned out delicious,even though next time I'll probably go for blue cheese only,it was tasty but I just love blue cheese(didn't want it too overpowering this time,since we had guests).All in all a great recipe,perfect for a special occassion!

The blue cheese taste is quite strong, but I love blue cheese so it's fine for me.  I may try a different type of cheese such as feta, as well as add in more bacon and chives.  If the chops are very thick, you may want to pound them out a bit to even the cooking time.  All-in-all I quite liked this recipe.

This is an awesome recipe. Made a few changes to it. I added chopped apples and pecans with a hint of fresh ginger to the stuffing. I browned it in a skillet with EVOO and crusted the chops with finely chopped pecans before placing it in the oven! It came out great! very flavorful! Will definitely make this again!! Also i scaled back the amount of blue cheese to about 3 ounces! well balanced flavor!

Used half blue and half Stilton to use up open pkgs. Only 3 oz of cheese but 3 slices of bacon. Also added pan toasted pecans. Next time I will try some apple as suggested. I cooked in grill pan instead of oven. Cut a pocket in each thick chop then used thin kitchen twine and a large curved upholstery needle to sew up the opening.

I thought it was great and easy! I used blue cheese on my husbands and substituted cream cheese in mine. My husband said a little less blue cheese in his because its so strong... but it was still delicious!! great job!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  Lots of flavor and very easy to make- even with being a novice cook.  I would reduce the amount of cheese for my next try to make it a bit healthier- the recipe calls for too much.  Otherwise, great recipe :)

i'm not the biggest fan of blue cheese and for me it was a bit too much. my cheese melted out of the chops,they shrunk horribly...just one thing after another! this recipe was ok, idk if i'd make it again but like i said, i'm not the biggest fan of blue cheese. my hubby liked it more than i do (and he loves blue chz). i followed the recipe exactly.

Good recipe.  Adding apples & pecans will make it better.  Also - while I'm not a believer in browning most things, the presentation on these is vastly improved if you brown before you stuff & bake.  Also - don't forget the garlic salt on the outside of the chops.  The stuffing definitely flavors the chops, but there was something lacking on the outside.

This was delicious. I took other reviewers advice and browned the chops in the bacon grease before moving to the oven. About 25-30 mins in the oven was more than enough time after browning both sides. I also added cream cheese to the stuffing mixture, to keep everything together. My husband thought the blue cheese was a bit strong (would maybe try feta next time) but I thought it was perfect. We didn't have any chives (or green onions) so I just left them out. Perhaps that would have helped even out the sharpness of the cheese. Would def. make again!!

Really good combination,I also combined it with the famous chops recipe, found it worked better for me to flatten the pork to make a parcel for the filling.

I made these last night and took note of some of the other reviews. To soften the strong flavour of the blue cheese, I added some soft cheese with chives. Instead of the chives I used the greeen parts of a bunch of scallions for a more oniony flavour. Served them with Scallion mash, green beans and gravy. Very good recipe!

I have tried tons of recipes here and this is the first one I feel is worth commenting on....it really is delicious ...my husband is low carbing it so I made 2 chops for him and a large helping of fresh sauteed spinach.It went very well together. I did modify the recipe slightly as blue cheese is so overwhelming...I used all feta and then dribbled maybe 1/2 TBLSPN Blue Cheese salad dressing into the mix. I used 2 strips of really good thick bacon so I had enough grease to brown the chops in before baking, which made them a pretty golden brown and a little more delish. It's a great recipe and I will try with some of the other suggestions. My husband loved it....what man wouldn't it's pork, wrapped in pork, fried in pork. But it was worth breaking my diet for 1 yummylious bite.

I used the boneless sirloin chops. I didn't stuff them, I put the stuffing on the top.  I also threw in some apples & pecans.  I had to cover them w/foil so that the top didn't burn. This is definately a keeper!

These came out really tasty! They went together really easily. I followed the recipe, but chose to pan fry the chops instead of cooking in the oven. Easy and delicious. The only thing keeping these from a 5-star rating was that they were really salty (I did not add any extra salt). I think it was just a lot between the blue cheese and the bacon.  Next time I might try lower-sodium bacon, and see if that makes a difference.

hubby rated these at a 3 ... so-so for him.  my kids kind of picked at them, and would only eat them when drenched in ketchup.  i'm not a pork eater so i'm going off of their responses, but it wasn't a favorite.  hubby said the flavor of the cheese was overpowering and too strong.  he said he would enjoy it more with a milder cheese, like mozzarella.  he did enjoy the bacon and chives, but also felt the pork chops could have been more seasoned than they were.  he also suggested that next time i lightly dredge them in flour and saute them in a skillet instead of baking.  however, i will say this was definitely different from the usual baked pork chop, so i appreciate the creative twist and nice change from the regular.  thanks!

This is an awesome recipe and has earned its way into our family. I cut a deep pocket in the middle of each chop,seasoned inside and out with garlic powder,pepper and onion powder. then i browned the chops in bacon grease before baking. I doubled the bacon and baked them  40 minutes for 4 chops. i did not add an form of salt and believe me, as a salt lover ,I am here to say this recipe does not need salt and should never have been a part of this recipe. If you like blue cheese you will find this recipe to be a keeper. thanks for sharing.

This was an incredible dish! I made it with no substitutions and it was so good that my husband said he was falling in love with me all over again! I had made extra so we could have leftovers and it was almost better the second day because the flavors really got to soak into the pork.

I used regular pork chops instead of boneless.  I used the butterflying technique, but instead of butterflying, I made a pocket by cutting back to the bone and within 1/2" on each side.  Once stuffed, I just had to close the opening with a toothpick(less mess). To make the pork chops look more appetizing, I brushed with butter and broiled the final 2 minutes of cooking so they would have a golden brown appearance.

I didn't have a full 4oz of blue cheese, so I mixed in some left over feta and cream cheese as others had suggested. It definetly made more than enough for the two pork chops that I had. Next time I'll cut back on the amount of cheese I use. This is definetly not for someone who doesn't like the taste of blue cheese. I do like it, however, and loved the flavor of the blue cheese and the bacon. I omitted the chives because I didn't have any on hand. I will be making this again for sure.

Very good.  I followed others suggestions by mixing the blue cheese with some cream cheese.  I forgot to add the chives and it was still great.  Next time I would brown the pork chops on each side before baking.

This was amazing!! I agree that the blue cheese can be a bit overpowering, but I am a blue cheese fan so i loved it.  This tastes like something you would order in a restaraunt.

Good pork chops! Made these for my bf and I tonight. We enjoyed them, but I still think I am going to try pork chops III by Karen (the blue cheese taste was too dominant IMHO).... I followed DOMMECHEF's directions "almost" to a T with great results. My only (minor) changes were to sub gorgonzola for blue cheese (it's milder) and use 3 strips of bacon instead of 2 (I needed to clear out what was left in my fridge). Oh, and I browned my pork chops in bacon grease and then poured what was left (the grease) over the chops in my greased baking dish. I purchased a package of 2 boneless top loin chops for $3 at my local Italian market which worked out perfectly!!!! I do not know how long it took them to bake... I used my Williams-Sonoma digital thermometer and baked to an internal temperature of 170 degrees. Served alongside spinach with a twist by Elizabeth (the two paired nicely together). I think I would have liked this dish even better with chopped GrannySmith apples and pecans in the cheese mixture (which I will try next time just to see for myself). Thanks for sharing this very easy recipe!

This was very good compared to the boring pork chops i normally make. My husband can not stand blue cheese so I did sub creame cheese instead. I think next time i might use feta. That sounds interesting. My six year old ate a whole chop to herself.

What the heck? This is really a little bit of pork wrapped around a crazy blob of blue cheese!! It was good- for the first bite, and then I couldn't taste much.  A few bites more and my mouth began to numb... It could be good, but 2 oz per serving is WAY too much cheese. And it needs something creamy to improve the texture. The chives were totally lost, I didn't even know they were there, and the bacon was only apparent when it rarely outnumbered the cheese in a bite. Also, be careful- it's REALLY easy to overcook these chops (no real moisture inside). Could be good, with a few tweaks, but as is- blech. (no offense)

The filling is yummy, but my husband and I both agreed it belonged more in a quiche, omelette, or stuffed in chicken; the pork just didn't taste right with it.

This is excellent! The only thing I changed was to add double the bacon and also a fresh minced garlic clove to the stuffing mixture. It is very rich and tasty.

It turns out I do not like bleu cheese, nor does anyone in my family. This tasted terrible but I made the recipe again using Feta and a tenderloin and it got RAVE reviews at a dinner party we had. I tied up the pork and crusted t with rosemary , salt, pepper and cooked in the oven. Thanks, this was a great success with a little modification to the cheese.

I added cream cheese, apples and pecans to the stuffing. I browned the chops and then placed them in a slow cooker on high for a couple of hours. It was the best pork chop I've ever eaten.

We loved these chops. As recommended, added some feta and parmesan cheese and stuffed 4 chops with the same amount of filling. Paired them with the Herb Roasted Vegetables and Lemon Basil Carrots also from this site. Delicious!

I have to start by saying I do NOT like Blue cheese. I thought this recipe was great and so did my family. I made some slight changes. I add a scoop of sour cream and chive/onion cream cheese (like other people suggested). I browned it in the bacon fat. Then I made a gravy in the drippings (I also added an onion & shallot to the pan while it cooked in the oven). It came out great. I will make it again.

My husband and i arent typically bleu cheese fans, so i made a few changes to this reciepe. First i did the bleu cheese, but also added some cream cheese to keep it all together, some gorgonzola cheese and some mozerella cheese. I added my own spices, some cayanne red pepper, garlic... ect. I added more bacon the called for and added a bit of melted butter. MIxed all that together, and intead of butterflying the pork chop i cut it down the middle half way and did the same thing across x like... put the cheese mix in. then i added shake and bake to the pork chop to keep in the juices. It wasnt too rich and served my husband well! I served this with a side of green beans and garlic mashed potatoes.

I modified this a bit, but in the end it was quite delicious.  I had 4 pork loin portions that were about an inch thick.  I cut a pocket into each of them.  I used 4.4 oz of bleu cheese (that is the size of the package I had, and what is a girl going to do with .4 oz of bleu cheese?), 2 Tablespoons of cream cheese, 6 slices cooked bacon, and 3 chopped green onions.  I stuffed the pork chops with the stuffing, and then closed the holes using tooth picks.  I coated each chop in egg wash, and then dredged them in Shake and Bake Oven Fried Pork coating.  I baked the chops at 400 F for 20 minutes (as per the box of Shake and Bake), and they were fantastic.  This was a great recipe because in addition to being yummy, it didn't require ingredients I don't keep on hand and didn't dirty very many dishes.  I will make it again.

Outstanding! I added 1-2 tbsp of sour cream & chive cream cheese to the stuffing mixture for consistency. Also, I did use butterflied pork chops but they were quite thick and required 45-60 minutes in the oven. Overall, wonderful! I will make it again- thanks!

Wow! Very rich!! Soooo good!
It definitely takes more than 20 minutes to cook. And I think next time I make them, I'll brown them in a pan first.

Excellent!  These chops were so good and the blue cheese was not overpowering like I was afraid it might be.  I used a slightly higher ratio of bacon to blue cheese and left out the salt as per other reviews.  I also cooked for 45 minutes as my chops were thicker!  Family loved it!

My husband invited a friend over just after I'd left for the grocery store and committed to this recipe (not his usual style but okay).  This turned out great.  I did add an egg wash with bread crumbs to finish it on the outside.

I made this last night and it was a hit. I did make a few changes. I used goat cheese instead of blue cheese. Also i used butcher cut applewood smoked bacon. As others suggested I browned the chops before baking them. My husband really enjoyed these pork chops and he wished I would have doubled the recipe!!!

This recipe was very good!  I did change a few things.  I did cut the blue cheese with cream cheese like others suggested and I used store bought bacon pieces.  I browned them first in olive oil and then, after draining oil, returned them to the pan to simmer>  I made some brown gravy for them to simmer in (about 30 minutes) and they were AWESOME!  My husband loved them.  The blue cheese and gravy gave them an unique but wonderful flavor and the simmering made the chops very tender!  I will definitely be making these again! There is soo much you can do with this recipe!

I used feta cheese instead of blue cheese (husband doesn’t like blue cheese) and even though I am not a pork chop fan, these were tasty.  Thanks!

Don't change a thing delicious, unless you want to use Italian Gorgonzola instead, it's a stronger yet milder cheese, but I would definitely use a sauce like a Portabella Red Wine Reduction.

We had these a while back but I forgot to rate them.  I loved them.  The blue cheese and the cream cheese blended beautifully and gave it a subtle but definite zing.  My husband on the other hand hates blue cheese.  I thought he would like it blended with the other ingredients but he did not.  I will definitely be having this again and the hubby can have a plain baked chop.

Amazing if you love blue cheese.  I didn't have pork chops on hand and used a 1lb. pork loin instead and that required a longer cooking time.  The quantity of stuffing was more than enough for the pound of meat.

The blue cheese mixture was extremely strong tasting, but the pork itself had no flavor.  I would not make this again.

I've been making these for about five years and live them!! I use the different variations each time and they still turn out delicious!! I especially like using chive cream cheese and adding blue cheese and a bit of blue cheese dressing. Highly recommend trying these pork chops! They even taste great reheated in the rare event of leftovers.

I made some changes based on reading reviews, I added some bread crumbs, sour cream , and a 1/4 cup chopped walnuts and a tbsp of butter to the stuffing recipe.  I pan seared them and then baked for 35 minutes at 400 degrees.  I mixed a 1/2 cup white wine and some melted butter and a spritz of balsamic vinegars and then poured over chops and let bake for another 5-10 minutes.  Hubby and I both loved it, a nice change to pork chops.

Overall, pretty good recipe. Ultimately I supplemented chives for chopped green onions, added roughly twice the bacon, and forgone the oven for the grill.

Excellent recipe! Took the suggestions from other reviewers and reduced the amount of blue cheese and replaced 1/2 of the amount with goat cheese.
Using sour cream in the mix really helped with the
flavor and keeping the chops moist.

Great but leave out the salt.  Brine chops 2 hrs in advance and remove from oven when thermometer reaches 140 degrees. Cover w/ tin foil for 5 min.  I never cook pork by timing it.  I always use a meat thermometer.  Pork today is soooo lean, a couple minutes too long and you have a dried chop.

Amazing! Delicious! 
I was nervous about the blue cheese after reading the reviews, so I put in about 1/2 Feta, 1/2 Blue cheese, I did it all by eye, not weight, but I would say I probably used about 2oz. of each.
I made this a second time a few days later and I made some extra alterations:
-I added apples (Macintosh) both times. Each time I thought I put in a lot, but you could easily use an apple per serving or more!
-I added the pecans too
-Also added dried cranberries the second time around- AWESOME!
-I used green onions instead of chives and added a bit of parsley
-Browned the pork in the bacon fat before adding mixture and baking

This meal is fantastic and super easy to make. I will be making this again and again... and again!

This was a great stuffing  but not for Pork.  Pork is already salty and so is blue cheese.  This will be great on Chicken.

This is a very flavorful recipe, but I overcooked the chops.  Also I used spaghetti instead of toothpicks, as was suggested, but that didn't work out.  The spaghetti cooked and then I lost a lot of the stuffing out of the pocket. Maybe my chops were too thick for that.

As many reviews have pointed out, the blue cheese is overpowering.  You really need to like blue cheese!!  My husband enjoyed them, however I was not crazy about them at all.  Will not make these again unless my husband requests them.

This was good! I used herb goat cheese, parmesan cheese, two triangles of reduced fat laughing cow cheese, and sundried tomato feta, along with chives and bacon. I baked my 3/4" chops for about 40 minutes on 350. I also marinated the chops in some wine before browning them on each side in a pan then baking. They turned out excellent!

This was a fun thing to try.  I used 1/2 blue cheese and 1/2 cream cheese according to the comments.  Also, instead of butterflying the pork, I just cut a pocket from one side.  I used spaghetti pieces to seal the chops (this was a great suggestion--thanks!).  It turned out pretty good, but really wasn't my favorite.  I like blue cheese, but the flavor was a little too strong for me.  I think I would like it better if I hadn't used cream cheese and used rocotta instead.  I also think the chops need only about half the filling--it was a bit too much.  All in all, though, it was a fun recipe to try out!

Do not like blue cheese.  Maybe try with another kind. Took 40 min to cook pork chops.

This recipe is good, but instead of blue cheese, we substituted feta cheese (I am not a big blue cheese fan).  It was delicious!  Be careful about adding more salt though; the cheese in itself makes the dish pretty salty.

I changed this recipe so much from the original that I didn't want to rate it, but it won't let me post a review without selecting a rating! So, I'm rating MY version of this recipe, which is 5 stars. I used shredded mozzarella cheese, bacon (doubled), and green onions for the filling held together by a few tablespoons each of sour cream and cream cheese. I used 1.5 inch thick chops, and I cut a pocket in each chop. I then browned the chops in the bacon grease with a little olive oil. After that, I stuffed each chop with the filling. However, I realized that I wanted enough filling for each chop that every bite could have a large portion of the filling included, so to be able to add more filling without it all leaking out... I actually stood my pork chops on end like a taco with the pocket side up. Some of the filling leaked out, but a lot more stayed in than it would have if I had cooked the chops flat. I cooked them for 35 minutes. This will definitely be a repeat recipe in my house, though I will probably try it with chicken next time. Yummy!

This recipe was very good. I usually tend to make it just like the recipe calls and then make my judgment. I made it and after agreed with some of he other reviews. Pan sear the chop first then mix the blue cheese with feta. The blue cheese is kind'a over whelming for the pork chop. I also agreed with some of the other reviews that it was missing something. The only thing that came to mind was maybe some sun dried tomato mixed in with the cheese mixture. Other than that. this was truly a delicious meal and would recommend it no matter how you decided to prepare it.

I did as a lot of others said and added some feta cheese as well. I wasn't completely impressed with this recipe. My husband loved it and we both agreed it needed something else. Not sure what that something else is, but i do plan on making these again and maybe making a sauce to go over the pork chops.   My 3 and 4 year old didn't care for them either. My son loved the chop itself..but didn't like the "stuff" he sat disgusted.

I first made this dish in Paris when I wanted to try cooking a French dinner. I also had to cook the chops for about forty minutes. I use gorgonzola cheese and I usually have a bottle of cabernet to go along with it. I have often substituted green onions for chives when I didn't have any chives and they are still delicious. Never dry, and always leaves me wanting more!

These were so easy to make and turned out so good. I did not have chives so I used green onions instead. I dont like to much crunch in my foods so I sautéed the green onions first then added them to the blue cheese and bacon. I cooked the pork for about 30 minutes to make sure that it was done. I served this with garlic red potatos and everyone loved it!

Mu husband loves these! I use blue cheese or gorgonzola...whichever I have on hand. Sometimes I use chicken stock and white wine in the pan after the pork is done to make a little sauce to go on top.

Really good! My husband loved it. I pounded the chops and added the granny smith apples with a few dried cranberries. Very rich. Add the cream cheese to make it stick together.

This recipe sounded good, but a little bland. Instead of black pepper, I used season pepper and peppered both sides of the chop along with garlic powder instead of salt. After cooking the bacon, I sauted a little red onion (I was out of chives) and chopped mushrooms until tender (about 3 minutes) and added to the blue cheese along with chopped fresh spinach. Yes, I borrowed from another recipe. IT CAME OUT DELICIOUS!!!!

Lots of flavor.  I didn't add the bacon I used finely chopped broccoli & sea salt. And I seared them with butter before adding filling.  Will make again.

This is pretty good.  I forgot the garlic salt and pepper, and I'm glad I did--it was very salty already with the bacon and blue cheese.  Would've been overpowering if I'd salted it.  I also browned the chops before baking--I just don't really like that pale color that baking only does.  I pounded them thin, then spread the filling out and rolled back up.  Blue cheese is just such a strong flavor I didn't want it concentrated in such a small area.  Bf said the blue cheese was "strong" but good enough to eat--thankfully, as he disliked blue cheese the last time he tried it!  Thanks for the recipe!

Like some other reviewers I did not like the flavor of the blue cheese with the pork chops, but I do normally like blue cheese.  It was very strong.  I also suggest seasoning the pork chops with salt and pepper before stuffing because the cheese was not salty enough for me, just overpowering and the pork itself was a little lackluster with not much seasoning on the chop itself.  I would try it again but not exactly as written.

This was JUST good (average). I will say it was difficult from the usual which made it interesting. I will try to make it again maybe next time I will love it like the rest of the reviewers here. I did like the others here suggested by browning the pork chops in bacon oil first and the made sauce with sour cream from the dripping after removing from the oven. That made it better

To be fair to the recipe, I wasn't certain if I liked blue cheese when I initially chose this recipe.  The main purpose was to actually experiment with blue cheese a bit in my culinary endeavors.  Unfortunately, I just didn't care for the recipe.  It struck me that the blue cheese was too strong and needed to be more of an accent to the dish.  I am uncertain if it was just a strong dislike for the amount of blue cheese or if the recipe lacked the necessary combination of ingredients to push it to the top.

You **have to** make mashed potatoes and make gravy with the drippings.  Phenomenal.  To the drippings add 1 or 2 tbsp flour, and about 1/4 c. water or broth.  Mmm-mmmm.

This recipe is a good alternative for plain old pork chops.  However, as much as we love blue cheese...it was a little over-powering for the light taste of pork.  I'd use a little less blue cheese next time....but it would be PERFECT with a steak!

we couldn't even finish ours.  The idea was good, but way too much blue cheese!  Our blue  cheese just may have been really strong.  I would try this again with some alterations.

yum yum yum.... I normally do not eat blue cheese..but I thought we'd give it a try.....wwwwwoooooooowy..Yum. We use pre-butterflied thick porkchops, SO it took 50 mins to cook....next time I will buy the thinner chops and make a pocket as previous users had said. We thought we would use some cream cheese too to hold the mixture together.... A MUST TO HAVE IN THE ARSENAL OF RECIPES!!!!

Added half an apple but couldn't taste it nor the chives. Added 2 spoons of cream cheese to hold filling together - good idea. Could stand to double or triple the bacon. Seared the pork chop in bacon grease first, then filled it and cooked for 30 minutes w/ the last few minutes on broiler. Bleu cheese flavor is very strong!

Also good with chicken. I breaded my pork with breadcrumbs/egg (and chicken when I tried it) because I found baking it with just the garlic salt and pepper made the outside a little rubbery. If you try the breadcrumbs you do not need to season the meat at all with garlic salt or pepper.

Great, easy-to-make recipe!  Substituted feta for the blue cheese and it came out great.  My husband praised after his first bite.  Took about 45 minutes to cook to our liking.  Will try browning in pan before baking next time.

I would give this 3 and a half stars if I could.  I pan fried the chops instead of baking them and I will admit they were a little tough.  If I did make this again I would change the stuffing like other reviewers suggest.

Great recipe, and really easy.  Thick cut boneless pork chops really do need to cook longer than suggested, took about 40 minutes for mine.  I also basted with some BBQ sauce right before they came out.

I made some slight changes to the recipe per other reviews.  I used feta instead of bleu cheese and used a little bit of sour cream to act as a glue.  I think this dish requires a stronger cheese than feta so maybe 1/2 feta and 1/2 bleu cheese or gorgonzola.  I also think this should cook in some type of sauce or gravy.  I will definitely play with this recipe again.

The blue cheese flavor on these was great, but the pork came out very tough.  Like many reviewers, I had to bake double the time (and eventually turned the oven temp up to 350).  My husband doesn't like blue cheese, so I used shredded sharp cheddar in his, mixed with a bit of sour cream to hold it together.  He said it was good.

the blue cheese overwhelmed the taste of the pork, next time use a different cheese kemon would have helped cut the blue cheese.

I've been wanting to make this for sooo long and finally got around to it.  Alas, not what we expected.  We found it to be quite bland which surprised me.  Also, I don't see how the chops can be cooked in 20 minutes at 325 degrees.  I put it at 350 for 35 minutes and they were still a bit pink (which is how we like them).

This was very tasty.  My picky children didn't care for the strong blue cheese, but they just picked it out and ate the pork chops.  This would make a very nice main dish for an adult dinner party.

Incredible! I pounded the pork chops to make a bit thinner. I used blue cheese, already-cooked bacon from the store, and fresh chives from my herb garden.  Baked at 350 degrees for 40 minutes, but next time I will only cook for 30 minutes.  And I might try other reviewers' suggestions to mix blue cheese with feta.  Don't get me wrong, the blue cheese was fabulous.  It's just such a strong flavor that the bacon and chive seemed to get a bit lost.  I had to laugh when my husband asked "Will I ever see this recipe again?" because I'm always trying new ones!  He will see it again, I promise!

I made this last night with a friend & her family. We made some with feta cheese for the kids and blue cheese & feta mixture for the adults. We really liked the recipe. I love blue cheese but even i think the mixture of feta & blue cheese is better, just the blue cheese would over power the pork chop. but in all a very good recipe!

Very good, we love bleu cheese so this was a hit.  I added one touch, coating the filled chops with beaten egg and then with corn flake crumbs, this gave it a nice crispy coating.

Very tasty. I made this with two very thinly sliced boneless pork chops. I put the stuffing in the middle, and used toothpicks to secure the chops together. The only thing I didn't much like was the pale appearance. If I were to make this again, I would briefly brown the chops on one side in a skillet, and then proceed with the recipe. Anyway, thanks!

My husband likened this to the taste of pine-sol. I didn't think it was quite that bad, but I found that, once cooked, the taste of the blue cheese was extremely overpowering to the pork. I like the idea, though, and I may try it again with cheddar cheese crumbles.

Fantastic!!  Very quick and easy to make too.  I'm not a blue cheese fan, so I substituted with Feta and these were to die for.  I did add the apples, pecans, and cream cheese as suggested by previous reviewers.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This is really yummy!  I would highly recommend fresh chives since the blue cheese can overpower the taste of dried chives.

I think this dish has my husband fooled into thinking that I'm a good cook!  We love this, and since he doesn't like blue cheese, I use the cheddar cheese crumbles for his.  I have to set my oven temp to 375 degrees (rather than 325), and cook the chops a little longer than the recipe calls for, but other than that, the recipe is perfect!  Thank you!

You are getting this rating 2nd hand.  I do not do Blue cheese at all, but I have a neighbor that loves it.  As a food xmas basket I made this for her.  I supply 2 1 1/2 inch pork chops.  Made the stuffing, adding the pecans, but leaving out apples, as I rolled into log and froze and didn't know how apples would do.  Told her pocket your chops slice off as much of stuffing you want and put in pocket and good luck...  She called me then she made first one and couldn't rave enough.  I also made her eggplant parm that I don't eat and this was one happy camper that I took time out at xmas to make these things she liked...to me that's xmas, not something I ran out and got at Walmart just to have a gift.

This is a great recipe.   A quick and easy way to make dinner special.  I added the apples and pecans to the mixture and my entire family including my 6 and 8 year old boys both really enjoyed it.  

I used 1 1/4  thick bone-in pork chops and I had the butcher to cut a pocket in the chops.  It was neat and cooked very well.  Cooking time was double that suggested on recipe.

This was O.K. and I probably would rate it closer to a three for taste. Giving it higher marks because it looked really pretty. Served with garlic mashed red potatoes. Probably won't be making again.

Made this last night and it was a HUGE hit. I was torn between this recipe and a similar one using gorgonzola that didn't have nearly the positive reviews this one does. After reading the reviews, though, I opted to sort of merge the two recipes and adapt several of the suggestions from other reviewers. I added about 1/2c finely chopped Vidalia (sweet) onion to the bacon, I added about 2T of cream cheese and used 4oz of gorgonzola instead of bleu, and I added the apples and pecans as well. Baked as directed, then kicked on the broiler at the end to brown the chops a bit more. I had about 1/4c of the stuffing left after stuffing the chops, so I made the basic pan sauce suggested by another reviewer (white wine, chicken stock, butter) and added the leftover stuffing to the sauce. This was SO SO SO good... the rich and tangy gorgonzola was balanced beautifully by the sweet onion and apples. The smoky crunch of the bacon plus the crunch of the pecans was the *perfect* offset for what might have otherwise been a too-creamy filling. This is *definitely* going into regular rotation here.

Added apples and pecan which made the dish.  Biggest challenge was the timing in oven.  Baked at 325 but wasn’t done...added another 15 min at 350 and then had to transfer to convention oven for another 10 min at 350.  Came out delicious.

These Pork Chops were exceptional! The gown-ups in my family LOVE Blue Cheese, & we also love Pork Chops.  Bacon is always a welcomed ingredient here  (in moderation), since we DO look out for our overall health.  FYI:  Whenever a recipe calls for Garlic Salt OR Onion Salt, I always substitute those with Garlic Powder & Onion Powder, in order to keep it a bit 'healthier'.  If anyone at our table would like more salt, they're perfectly welcomed to use the  (ever present) saltshaker, but personally, .... I wouldn't recommend it.  I'm saving this recipe, and will increase it when  I need to feed  more people.

Excellent recipe...I did like as other suggested. I added half cream cheese and half blue cheese.  I used a bit more thick crumbled bacon, as well as a extra bit of chives. I browned my chops in bacon oil and a dab of butter. I added a couple splashes of red wine as well as red wine vinegar while browsning my chops. I slip a hole. Coring to the bone. I stuffed my chops. Secured with toothpicks. I added the liquid from my pan to the baking dish and covered with foil... I cooked on 300 for an hour, then reduced my heat down to 250. Let cook about 45 mins.  Next time I will be sure to make a red wine reduction sauce to pour chops and serve....this dish has excellent taste.

This was a great alternative to basic broiled or grilled chops. I took the advice of other reviewers and added some cream cheese. I didn't have chives on hand so I substituted with green onions.

IF I make this again I will be cooking the pork chops first until they are almost fully cooked before I stuff them! The top of the pork chop is not cooking even after cooking them for an additional 20 minutes. And the oven heat should be higher somewhere between 350 and 400 not 325.

Only things I changed was using garlic powder instead of garlic salt, leaving salt out altogether (which is why I have it 4 stars instead of 5). I also chose a slightly milder blue cheese than your "standard" fare called "Point Reyes" just because I could. 

Oh! Almost forgot! I DID  have these gigantic, nearly 2 inch thick monster chops. They cooked for 45 minutes. 

Obviously this is very rich, but it's also protein heavy and makes a fantastic change of pace for relatively little extra effort . Served with a show of quinoa and "Protein Blends" vegetable mix for an even higher kick of protein.

This was very good.  I used Real Bacon bits and forgot the chives, but still delicious.  I also put a little garlic powder in the blue cheese mixture.  Only problem is our pork chops were thick bone in and they took at least 30 min in a 375 degree oven.   Will make these again.

This is a can DO!!! Suggest you sear first and added a little cream cheese into the stuffing to bind it. I used regular garlic powder instead of garlic salt for lower sodium. Delish!!!

Neither my husband or I was a fan. I think any other cheese would have tasted better. Like everyone else said, they said to use way more blue cheese than needed. I don't think I will make again.

Maybe I used an extra strong blue cheese, but I mixed it half and half with cream cheese and it was still waaay powerful. It was good though, too much for my husband though.

Terrific recipe! I didnt even measure anything, just eyeballed it. Used scallions b/c it what I had. Seared the meat quickly, then stuffed & put in oven. The trick to pork is cook to 145 degrees then let rest, dont't go by time! Thank you for this recipe, will be making often!

I have made this recipe a few times with the suggestion of pecans and apple, and it is absolutely delicious! I plan to make it this week but have a friend who doesn't like blue cheese, so I'm going to try it with goat cheese instead. I bet it will be just as great!

Followed the recipe the first time around - both hubby and I thought it had good flavor.  I used thicker pork chops and probably cooked them just a little too long in the oven.  Next time, I'll try less time in the oven and searing them.  We'd also like to try them with feta cheese, and I'd like to try goat cheese too.

Thought it was really good and very easy. If you buy thicker chops, I suggest browning each side in a skillet then transferring to the oven to speed the process.

This is also great when thrown on the grill for 15-20 minutes. And I don't like blue cheese so I sub in one of those Kraft crumble blends and it's still pretty good.

This was pretty good- I used crumbled feta in place of the blue cheese, and added alittle more bacon than the recipe called for, but it came out with nice flavor. I'd love to play with this recipe alittle more to get it just right for my personal tastes, but it was certainly a great new spin on making pork chops!

The recipe was easy but it was difficult to keep the stuffing inside the porkchops.

This was a big hit at dinner with the parents last night!  I substituted feta for the bleu cheese per my preference.  I also made a pocket to stuff rather than butterflying - I think it's easier!  This is definitely a new addition to my rotation!

I like blue cheese but this was too much.  No one in my family liked the dish.  Considering the taste, the off the chart sodium level and the $$.   It will definitely never grace our table again.

Super hit with my boyfriend, who loves Bleu Cheese.  I, on the other hand, am not a fan, and though the nutritional value went down, I substituted the Bleu for Mozarella or an Italian shredded cheese blend.  Still marvelous either way.  I usually serve on a small bed of butter and herb pasta.

This recipe has the wrong cheese in it. It is too over powering. Use a milder cheese so you can still taste the pork

This is awesome!  My family LOVED it!  I did add sauted mushrooms, but everything else was the same.  This is a keeper!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

My husband rates this a 4 and I rate it a 2.  I had never had blue cheese and didn't like the flavor...way to strong for me.  However, my husband is a blue cheese fan.  I cut the blue cheese in half, added an extra piece of bacon, and more chives.  This wasn't good enough for me to make again.

Excellent dish! I took the advice of other reviewers and used feta cheese.  I think it complients pork better than the blue cheese.

I LOVE blue cheese! However, this overpowered the pork big time. I will make this again using steak.

The blue cheese and bacon mixture was great! Next time I will make with chicken though and use more fresh chopped chives. Very easy to make.
