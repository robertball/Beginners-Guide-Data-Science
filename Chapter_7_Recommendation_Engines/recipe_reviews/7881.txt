Very good, made a little change, only 1 3/4 cups sugar, also added about 4 oz. of apple sauce that made it very moist.  Served it with fresh whipped cream & it was delecious.  Have shared recipe & it always goes over quite well. - A KEEPER for sure.  MJ

Very moist.  I decreased to oil to 1/2c. and added cinnamon applesauce.  I think that made the texture better.  It also makes it a little more on the healthy side.

I love this recipe! It is so easy, pretty much just put everything together and bake! The hardest part is waiting the hour! I get asked for the recipe every time I make this. It is great to make in small loaf pans and given as gifts. We like to eat it for breakfast too. I even cheat and use reconstituted dehydrated apples and it is still wonderful. Thanks for the recipe!

I was skeptical because I don't really like apples, but my husband loves them.  I substituted Splenda for the 2 cups of sugar and 1/2c of applesauce for the 1/2c of oil.  It turned out great!  I might make carmel glaze next time to drizzel over the top.
Ok I made it again and this time I used 1/2 apples and 1/2 pears.  WONDERFUL

My husband requested I make pound cake, but all I had was self rising flour. An ingredient search lead me to this pound cake, and I was suspicious. However, after tasting the results I can't wait to make another batch and give the cake as gifts! It's absolutely delicious. I took the advice of some other reviewers and used 1 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup of oil. I also used  2 large diced apples and 1 large diced red pear. I'm going to make it again and try replacing the sugar with splenda.

This was tasty and moist. I used 1/2 cup oil + 1 cup unsweetened applesauce (and Spartan apples). I would make it again.

Maybe I did something wrong, but I checked the recipe like 4 times, but this cake didn't stay together. It completely fell apart. And it was too sweet.
Sorry!

So delicious. It is a very moist pound cake. My boyfriend loved it. I didn't make any changes to the recipe.
