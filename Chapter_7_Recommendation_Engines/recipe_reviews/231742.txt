I also think it is missing how many carrots and raisins you should put in the hot water.  Maybe I'm just missing it or we should wing it??  I definitely use a recipe and am not a great cook so when it is missing items, it is not a good thing.

This recipes is missing the sugar for the cheesecake filling. It should have 3/4 cup of sugar for the filling. Also the middle layer of cake batter can be difficult to spread over the cheesecake filling. I spoon small spoonfuls over it. My son loves cheesecake and carrot cake. He asks for this every Birthday and Holiday. I also put a pan of water in the oven when I bake cheesecake to keep it from cracking. This is delicious but I would not recommend for novices.

For those people concerned about 'missing carrots and raisins' those are contained in the packaged mix. They are in a separate pack that you soak in the hot water. I made the pineapple frosting and it was great as I find regular cream cheese frosting just too sweet.

I made this the night before easter and it was very easy to make. I made a little extra icing because it just didn't look like it was enough and i was correct. I also added i extra tsp. of pineapple juice to the icing and it was just fabulous. great recipe. thanks
