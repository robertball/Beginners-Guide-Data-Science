I just finished making this and was very disappointed. I believe I oversalted the carrots so that was my mistake. This is not creamy or bubbly. Carrots were not done in the oven so am finishing them off in the microwave. The flavor of the topping unfortunately is not very tasty either. I split this into two casseroles so I could share with the neighbors but I don't think I will do so. I don't believe for the huge amount of carrots involved that I would be attempting this one again.

It tasted like you were eating a raw plain carrot. Maybe the amount of carrots is off in this recipe not sure what exactly is wrong.

I modified the recipe and used Wildtree's Gluten Free Alfredo Extraordinaire instead of cream of celery. I used about about 3/4 cup Alfredo 3/4 cup milk saut√©d celery in the butter called for in the alfredo also added some Wildtree Garlic Sea Salt and Wildtree California Style Garlic Pepper Blend. And I used gluten free panko style bread crumbs. Turned out very good!!
