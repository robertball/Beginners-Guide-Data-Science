Sweet, spicy, tangy and zingy. This quick and easy sauce blends the flavors of the holidays and elevates ordinary pork steak to something special and new.

Loved the apples and sauce! It was just too good to waste on ugly pork steaks! Next time I want a nice cut pork loin or pork chop!

I started out making the sauce as is in the recipe but found that it was too runny and had evaporated a great amount when the meat was cooked. I made a paste of cornstarch and orange juice and added it in spurts so as to make more sauce and to thicken it. It was all round rave revues and, "oh please make this again." Thank you for this amazing recipe.

Excellent recipe. Added a little more cranberry (had a small can, so just put the whole thing in) and it worked out well.  I'd only suggest using salt and pepper over pork before cooking (maybe a wee bit of granulated onion to taste). 
Served over mashed potatoes and made a delicious meal!

Followed the recipe exactly. Smelled fantastic cooking, but actually tasted quite bland. Disappointing.

Really good! I used chicken tenderloin strips instead of pork, which was delicious - cooking the chicken in the sauce means it is not dry. I pushed the apples aside in the pan to brown the chicken before mixing with sauce. I cooked the fruit down longer until it was very soft, and used more apples so I would have lots of sauce to put over rice.  I made it in the afternoon and put back in pan to warm up at dinnertime. I did not use cranberry sauce,  and used ground cloves since that is what I had.
