The flavor was great and it baked up beautifully, once the dressing oooled it was very dense. I added one chopped carrot and extra crimini and shiitake mushrooms.

This is my recipe but I canâ€™t figure out how to edit it so I am leaving my current changes in this note.
- replaced all oil and butter with schmaltz
- replaced 1 cup of matzoh meal with 1 cup of matzoh farfel (helps to make it less dense)
- increased celery to 1 1/2 cups
- probably used at least 1 1/2 - 2 teaspoons of black pepper
