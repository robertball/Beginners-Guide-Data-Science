This is a great recipe.  A holiday staple in our house for as long as I remember.  My mom made these with Brandy.  I prefer using bourbon.  I have also used a combination of dark and coconut rum, or white cream de menth.  They all are great.  Then you can roll in confectioners sugar, ground nuts, cocoa powder...  Endless possibilities!

Delicious! Very easy to mix up, and rolled perfectly! I just rolled them all in powdered sugar b/c that's hubby's favorite. I have these in the fridge 'ripening' for Christmas, but so far, they are great, and I will report back closer to Christmas. I really liked that you didn't have to melt chocolate to make these, as you do for a lot of other recipes that I have tried. I will def be making these again and again...they are sooooo easy~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I read the good reviews but you never know, so I made these for our company Christmas dinner and they were the first item to be devoured and we had a lot of foods/desserts to choose from. Tip: Because corn syrup and whiskey are the only ingredients that add moisture to help stick together, the best way to mix is to remove all jewelry, wash hands vigorously and use your hands to mix. I hesitated in doing this and used a mixing spoon. However, had to add a little more corn syrup and whiskey for it to hold together which I wouldn't suggest doing.

Our 20 year long neighbors are moving to Kentucky from Boston and we are headed to a Farewell Party this afternoon. 
 I am always in charge of making something that has alcohol in it (like Jello Shots/Marinated Maraschino Cherries dipped in white chocolate etc) so I was looking for something with Bourbon in it to represent KENTUCKY! 

Made exactly like the recipe with only one exception, I toasted the pecans first. Only because I think that gives the BEST flavor of Pecans.  I made half with Coconut and half without in case someone doesn't like Coconut at the Party that I am bringing these to shortly.. 
They took me a LONG time to make.Start to finish about 2.5 hours but I am NO Baker so that probably lengthened the time.  I used my Food Processor for probably the first time in 10 years LOL.  
 I used a Melon Ball to start the "Ball" and I wound up with just over 50 Bourbon Balls at the last count. 
I had to taste one to make sure they were delicious and THEY ARE !
 I took the tip from someone to NOT put in extra Bourbon. They are the Perfect amount of Bourbon with what the recipe calls for.  
Can't wait to see them go...and I know they will. So Hat's off to MeeMaw.  This is a keeper.

Made these for a small Christmas party for a bourbon taster's club. They turned out great! Not too strong, just right! I made a couple of modifications by adding a tsp more of corn syrup and a couple of tsps of melted salted butter. The salt was a good addition because it added flavor to the balls. The corn syrup and butter made the batter less crumbly and easier to work with. They helped the confectioner's sugar and coconut adhere to the balls better and enhanced the flavor.

My sister and i made these to bring to a party. We made them at noon for an evening party. We used her food processor to grind the wafers and pecans. I opted to keep it simple and just used the powdered sugar instead of also using coconut. It was very easy. Good consistency. They were a big hit!!  Everyone was asking for the recipe. Without a food processor it would not have been the same. Some other recipes don't call for a food processor

My mixture came out a little dry and was hard to roll into balls.  Other than that,  they are great.

Just like I remembered.  I used Whiskey instead of Bourbon, which Google says is basically the same.  I only used 1/3 c, instead of 1/2 c.  Probably could have used a little water.  But they were great.  I also used very thin rubber gloves to mix and roll the cookies.

This is the recipe in the Southern Living cookbooks I was given when I got married. They're not too wet and they are very easy to make. One of my husband's favorites.

Super easy to make and you can less or more bourbon (obv, we did the latter!) I omitted the corn syrup for maple and added more when it seemed to get too dry to roll in to balls. 
Putting in stockings for the grown ups to enjoy on Christmas morning.

Love it!  I had no choice that I differed the recipe.  The vanilla wafers only came in an 11 oz bag.  But the nuts were 10 0z instead of the 8 oz I needed.  So I ate what I thought was 1 oz of nuts and hoped that the dry ingredients would equal out.  It did!  Great ratio of wet to dry.  Used my grandmaâ€™s shallow metal tablespoon to the the perfect sized ball.  Skipped the coconut, rolled them in powdered sugar.  Delicious!

Delicious and so easy to make!  I used my mini-processor and did in batches. Because the vanilla wafers are now 11 oz, I cut back a tad on the other ingredients, but I don't think it's necessary. I rolled in powdered sugar (looks like the photo), but I like the options of adding coconut or rolling in cocoa powder. I will place these way back in the fridge (so that I can't get at them!). Plan to place in cellophane bags with ribbon as part of gifts. Thanks for the recipe....will surely make again!

Delicious! Recipe as written works up perfectly. I made them with bourbon, but plan to try rum and brandy too â€” if only I could remember to buy vanilla wafers!

I have a friend who will be 103 on her b'day.  What does a lady of that age really need... or want???   Bourbon Balls! ?? She loves them...& Fruit Cake!  I didn't  start early enuff to get the Fruit Cake done on time....but, I was able to make these yummy Bourbon Balls.  I used Jack Daniels whiskey (bourbon? not sure, but close enuff sounding to me!)   I messed up & instead of putting the coconut on a plate to ROLL the balls in....I accidentally added it TO the mixture.  And, I ran out of powdered sugar after using a cup in the mix..so, I didn't roll the balls in that either....Oh well... my dear friend LOVED them!  I was concerned they'd be too strong in alcohol flavor, but.... she said they were perfect..& proceeded to eat 2  of  them!  I'll hafta ask her how the flavor melds over time, as I'm not a Bourbon Ball lover, so I wouldn't know.

The bourbon balls were great! My mother always made them during the holidays but this year was my turn. She liked them so much that she says she has to start making them again.

I added an additional cap full of bourbon and hence, they were not for non-adult consumption.  They had a nice kick in the end.

So yummy, and so easy to make! Reminded me my Nana's! Only rolled in powdered sugar cause the coconut wouldn't 'stick', but everyone loved them.
