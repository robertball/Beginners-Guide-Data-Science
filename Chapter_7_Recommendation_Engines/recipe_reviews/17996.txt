I made changes to this and it was very good.I used less than 8oz. spaghetti and broke into 4 sections then boiled(much easier for eating.) I used 28oz. can Contadina crushed tomatoes in puree. Omitted onion soup. Used 1/2tsp garlic powder,1/4 tsp onion powder. Franks red hot sauce & one half of a pound loaf velveeta. Used rest ing. as listd. If you use Velveeta becareful W/ adding additional salt. I put sauce ing. in bowl so I could adjust flavors,then added to meat untill cheese melted. Pored into 3 qt. oblong dish and slowly added pasta. Bake as directed. It came out creamy and not dry at all. Delish! Thanks Rhonda!

I scaled recipe to 12 since I was having a crowd of teenagers to dinner.  Added the chopped onion to beef, about 6 drops of hot sauce, a tbsp. minced garlic, some garlic salt and mindful of the comments about the onion soup mix, I only added 1 package to 3 lbs of ground beef.  Also added bread crumbs to the cheese topping.  Everyone loved it and ate and ate until there was no more.  I will definitely make again.  Thanks!

My family really liked this recipe but I did not. Per previous suggestions, used shell noodles and added a little extra basil.  It was still very bland and dry tasting to me. I even used a little extra cheese it hopes to make it creamier...it did not work. My boyfriend said he would love to see me make this one again although I doubt I will. Thanks anyways.

This is "hamburger helper" type food, but it was quick, easy, and turned out well.  I left out the onion soup-mix entirely, subbed elbow mac for the spaghetti, used a couple of real garlic cloves instead of the garlic salt, and spiced it up with "mexican" flavored diced tomatoes and some chili powder. I also diced up some green bell pepper and added it to the frying meat.  This is a good basic recipe that's easy to modify to suit your needs.

I liked this recipe because it was quick and easy. I substituted in mozzerella cheese for a more Italian taste. I also layered the ingredients instead of mixing them together (for presentation) Overall, pretty good.

I thought this recipe turned out good.  This is a recipe where you can make a few changes to suite your preferences and it wouldn't matter that much, so thats what I did.  When browning the meat, i added peppers to it.  Depending on your taste you could either use hot, green, or whatever kind of pepper you like.  INstead of using garlic powder, I diced up a few garlic cloves and put that in with the meat and peppers.  We think fresh garlic gives it food a better flavor.  I used rotini noodles and they worked really well.  I read how the other users said it was a little dry so instead of using a small can of tomatoes i used a 28 oz can.  I used about three fourths of it and saved the rest to top it when we ate it.  Next time i make it I would definitely use the whole big can.  This is also a good recipe to make if say you don't have time to cook like me on that particular day.  I made it that morning, everything but tossing it in the oven and when people were ready to eat while i was at work all they had to do was toss it in the oven and put cheese on it, presto they have a hot meal in half an hour.  Its not the best meal ever, but it is a really good quick family meal.  We used leftover sour cream, tomatoes, and cheese to top it before we ate it.  The last change I made was hot sauce, i wanted to add hot sauce to it before it was baked but i forgot to, so we just added it to our portions as we ate it.  If you like spicy things, it added a really good flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly, except used ground turkey for the beef. This is just an average casserole. We did like the flavor of the onion soup pared with sour cream. DH and I both felt like it came up short. Something big was definitely missing.

This casserole has an interesting flavor.  I really enjoyed it.  I did use mozzarella cheese because it's what I had available.  I used farfalle pasta, a better look, in my opinion.  Though this recipe turned out a tad dry, I'm still giving it the highest rating.  The flavor was awesome.  Maybe using more sour cream would keep it from turning out on the dry side.  I will probably try reduced fat sour cream next time.  The full calorie stuff may not add anything extra, but calories.  We'll see.  Good Lord willing, I will prepare this dish again and again.  Thanks, Rhonda.

Going by the other reviews, I chose to completely omit the onion soup mix, and instead added a small chopped white onion in with the meat.. I used turkey as that's all that was defrosted so I added a lil black pepper to it. I didn't salt it as the tomatoes and onion would provide enough of that, but contrary to some other repoerts, I didn't find this to be dry at all. It was bland colorwise, pretty 'white', but a healthy sprinkling of parsley fixed that without changing the taste. I thought it came out great and I will make it again.

Exceeded my expectations. I used Italian diced tomatoes, half a packet of onion soup mix, light sour cream, and reduced-fat cheddar. Otherwise, followed the directions exactly. My husband and my 3 year-old enjoyed it, too!

very good.  My family really enjoys this when I make it.  I have made it twice since finding this recipe.  Changes I made were to use half of the reccomended amount of sour cream and use a fat free variety.  Also we decided it needed veggies so we added frozen mixed veggies to the mix before putting in pan.  I use a chedder/mozza mix of shred cheeze on top.  Very enjoyable and tasty.  A true comfort food!  Thank you for the recipe.

This casserole was easy to mix together, but gave off a weird smell. The soup mix was too strong in it and my husband wouldn't go near it. Will not be trying this again.

I did some major doctoring on this recipe based on other reviews.  ie. .5tsp oregano, 3/4 cup of sour cream, stewed tomatos, 1/2 cup spaghetti sauce, 2 cups of cheddar cheese.  After all of that, it came out really tasty!

This was a hit with hubby and the kids were pretty happy with it too. I used leftover cooked spaghetti and substituted plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream and used just enough cheese on top to cover mixture (to make it a bit healthier). Wasn't dry at all. I was concerned about the salt and onion mix overload, so I used no salt diced tomatoes and only about 1/2 of the onion soup mix. It had plenty of taste and good texture. I would give it 5 stars, but to me, the name is misleading. It was more Italian tasting than "cheeseburger." But still quite easy, quick and good. I think it'll be good as leftovers too!

I made this with broad egg noodles instead of spaghetti. It definately didn't need the extra salt since the onion soup mix is already salty.  It seemed to be missing something.  I didn't have any garlic powder, so perhaps that's it.  My husband liked it, so perhaps I'll try it again andmake sure to put in some garlic.

This recipe was very good and easy to make.  I thought it would taste more "processed" b/c of the onion soup mix but the flavor was not too overpowering.  I doubled the amount of pasta and used fat free sour cream.  I accidentally put the cheese on top right away so I skipped that first 15 minute baking and just kept in in the oven for 20 minutes uncovered.

I felt that the whole pkg of onion soup mix was too strong for me and my family.  Next time I will either use half a large onion or only half of the soup mix.  There was no kissing between my husband and I after this meal.

This was very good.  I changed it a little as usual.  I added chopped onions and mushrooms along with the soup mix.  I also used a 28 oz. can of tomatoes.  I sprinkled some cayenne pepper for a little kick too.  Instead of cheddar I used mozzarella and fresh parmesan.  I also used rotini instead of spaghetti.  Very tasty.

Good casserole.  I mixed in a little cheese into the casserole along with the 1 cup of cheese for the top. Also added about 1 cup pasta sauce since we like more sauce. Easy & good.

Both my husband and I enjoyed this recipe.  I made it as directed but added onions when frying the beef.  Made great left overs!!  This is a recipe that I'll be making again.

I really enjoyed this recipe... I read the reviews and used macaroni instead of spaghetti and added some crumbled bacon and cayenne pepper.  I didn't omit the onion soup mix, used the whole package and didn't feel it was overpowering.  But I love spicy things, so perhaps the cayenne killed it.  Overall, I enjoyed this and my nieces loved the leftovers the next day.

This was good.  Not extrodinary but very good.  After reading the reviews, I made some changes.  I used small shell noodles as recomended.  When I browned the meat, I added 1 chopped green pepper and a small can of mushrooms.  I noticed that some said it was quite dry so I added an extra can of tomatoes and mixed a handful of cheese with the other ingredients and I used minced garlic from a jar rather than the other ingredients.  I did everything else as instructed.  My daughter decided that she wasn't going to like it when I was making it but after trying it  decided that she had to have seconds and then thirds.  She just asked for leftovers as an after school snack tomorrow.  I will make this again.

This recipe was very easy to make with a delicious result!  My family really enjoyed it and I would definately use the elbows.  I used jalapeno flavored tomatoes to spice things up a bit and it worked great!  Will make again and again.

This was very good.  Used a garlic herb seasoning onion mix.  Gave it a very good flavor.  Will try next time with a different type of pasta

Not a redo. Onion soup gave the recipe an odd flavor.  Kids wouldn't touch. Perhaps if the amount of onion soup was reduced it would be less pungent.  I am giving 3 stars instead of 2 because of its ease to prepare, it had a pleasant creamy texture, and I had all of the ingredients on hand before hand. But the onion soup - YUCK!

Has a beef stoganoff taste.  I think I should have put more tomato's in it you couldnt taste the tomato's.

It was easy to make.  2 of my kids did not like it.

Very easy to put together and tasty.  The onion soup mix is what gives the flavor a kick.  My husband and I both really enjoyed it.  Will make again, but the 8 serving size really serves 4-6 depending on how big of portions you like.

I have made this three times without reading the reviews, and thought that it was very good. The only problem that I found was mixing the spegetti with the other ingedients. Next time I will use elbow noddles as suggested by other reviewers. I also used fat free sour cream, and fat free shredded cheddar cheese for a low fat version. If you do not care for the taste of the onion soup mix try cutting back on it.

I enjoyed this meal very much, although my husband didn't share my opinion.  I don't know how much I should take his into account, as he isn't a very big casserole fan as it is.  My two year old loved it!  I did tweak it a bit, adding mushrooms, more tomoatoes, and using mozzarella, parmigiano, and cheddar cheeses.  I also used bowtie pasta instead of spaghetti.

With the sour cream and onion soup mix and spaghetti noodles this tasted VERY similar to a stroganoff recipe. Not quite what I had wanted when I made this recipe. Wide noodles would be better- I think it would mix easier.

I halved it for two servings and followed the recipe but used a whole can of Italian-style stewed tomatoes.  I like the onion soup flavor so I thought it was great, but I definitely prefer this type of casserole with wide egg noodles as opposed to spaghetti.  Thanks.

Just OK.  I felt that **** was overrating it.  Very dry.  If I were to make this again, I would add some tomato sauce and fresh garlic over the powdered.  It was very easy, but nothing special. Husband rated **, but said, yeah, probably easy, you could make it again.

I thought this was a great "quick" recipe with just a couple of changes.  I used egg noodles, half the soup mix, minced garlic too my taste(i.e. a lot), no salt, (enough in the soup & cheese), extra basil,& a large can of crushed tomatoes. It came out woderful for me and dear husband tonight.  I am looking forward to the left overs.

YUM!! I doctored this up a bit. I used elbow macaroni instead of spaghetti & used 2 cans of tomatoes. I also used half of the onion soup mix and added extra basil. My husband LOVED it! We both had seconds. He said this is definitely a keeper!

This was a very easy recipe to make and the taste very good. I will make this again as my family cleaned it up. I did use elbow mac instead of spaghetti.

This was terrific!! Really enjoyed the flavor.  I would add more basil next time. The appearance on the plate was a little bland/white looking. Flavor was awesome. Would make this again!!

it was easy,and very adaptable. I pretty much always add things to recipies (sometimes it's a good thing, sometimes not). This one I added fresh garlic and mushrooms. It was great. My family says it's a "keeper."

This recipe was som-what easy. Although,( not like cooking in a crockpot).The food after being prepared had absolutely no taste... This recipe was a waste of time.. I had to add some spaghetti sauce, to make it taste some-what better.

This definately needs a more substantial pasta than just spagetti - I used bowties and was quite happy with it.  A touch of hot pepper and worstershire sauce added zip, but was still kid friendly

This recipe was not that bad, but I probably won't make it again.  My kids did not like it.  My husband and I ate it, but have tasted better.  To me, using spaghetti was not the best choice of pasta, and the sauce was very rich.

It's good as is but still lacks a little flavor.  I would think that adding onions and maybe a little bacon would help a lot.

Made this for the three males in my house...2 sons and a Hub.  Doubled recipie, huge classic yellow casserole dish from my mother that I still use...BOOM.....GONE.  I layered the noodle/beef mixture with the cheese.  made a mix of Panco and cheese for topping(give this a spray with some Olive oil...or Pam, to crisp the Panco).  Since it was doubled..increased time to 20 minutes, add topping and 30 minutes more - it's a BIG dish!!  Being my sons, I was liberal with meat and cheese.  Casserole came out moist, but not runny.  YUM!  Just be sure to NOT overcook your pasta...I used elbow rather than spaghetti..
100% added to my favorites!

I made this almost exactly. Only change - I used half the onion soup mix per other reviews.  I think it would have been overwhelming if I used it all. It was perfect. Loved it and hubby did too. Will be making many more times!

turned out better than I thought it would. I only had diced tomatoes with green chilies on hand (maybe that gave it a little more flavor?) and I did not feel the need to add salt and pepper. I also used a different noodle.  I mixed the meat in with all other ingredients before mixing with the pasta as it seemed easier to add that to the browned meat first before putting in the dish for baking.  might try it with a crunchy layer of corn chips on top next time when melting cheese.  thanks for the great recipe!!

Added green bell pepper (diced), fresh onions, fresh garlic, thyme, Italian seasoning, cumin, oregano, a can of tomato sauce and 3 roma tomatoes, diced.Broke the spaghetti in half as suggested by someone. Left out the onion soup mix, did not have any, &  since a reviewer stated that it got too salty.  Still need some more peppering up to spice up the flavor.  Used ground turkey instead of beef, used 100% whole grain spaghetti.

Went down a storm, although I modified it a bit, but that's what recipes are for. Instead of onion soup mix I used 2 fresh onions, two handfuls of mushrooms, a large bell pepper and dark chilli sauce. Everything else was by the book and it was fantastic.
Wife has already said I'll be doing it again.

I made a couple of changes.  I used linguini noodles, a large can of tomatoes and only a half a pkg of onion soup mix.  Then I used a good sprinkle of parmesan and I used mozza and old cheddar.  It turned out really good.  Hubby loved it!  Oh and I also broiled it for 5 minutes at the end to turn the cheese nice and brown.  I do not like cooked cheese any other way!

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I browned the beef with onion, used a can of tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes (I didn't have any) and 12 oz of elbows so I didn't have a partial box leftover.  I mixed about 1/4-1/2 cup of cheese in with the meat and pasta, then added another cup (or more) on top as the recipe called for.  It was better than I expected.

Kids will eat this! I used light sour cream and a cheddar shredded blend plus shells for the pasta portion. Broccoli on the side plus good bread = comfort food for this frigid evening (plus a glass of wine). Warm, salty goodness that both young and adult at our house enjoyed.

Loved this recipe and so did picky hubby and 3 YO.  Only substituted fresh sliced tomatoes from garden right under cheese layer b/c we don't like canned tomatoes.  Far exceeded my expectations.  Making and keeping in crock pot for potluck tonight.  We'll see how well it turns out!

My family loves this casserole.  We love the flavor of the onion soup mix.  I did not change it at all except to cut the noodles in half before cooking which makes it easier to eat.

Easy and fast, I spiced it up a bit but kept it pretty much the same. Didn't have soup mix so did chopped onion and added some dry onion flakes too. Thanks for the recipe, it was just what my guy wanted.

this was a HUGE hit but only have i made some adjustments to the recipe.  i had to make 1 1/2 times the recipe for a household with a big appetite.  and i didn't have enough sour cream!  so i added a can of cheddar cheese soup and WOW.  so good.  i also only used half a packet of onion soup mix.  and i put extra cheese on top.  not the lowest in fat but certainly easy and very very good.  the pickiest eater i have had 3 helpings!  thanks!

Easy to make, but onion soup mix a little overwhelming, plus makes it a little salty. Made exactly as recipe directed. Not too bad.

I was in a rush and this was a good meal.  I skipped the oven part and just mixed the cheese directly in with the sour cream and tomatoes to smooth it out.  I thought it tasted great this way.  I also didn't have the soup mix, so I just used dried onions.  I mixed the onions, garlic (I used cloves) and basil right in with the meat while it was cooking instead of waiting for the rest of the stuff to be mixed together - as I said, I was in a rush.  This was quick and easy.  The dish tasted great in my opinon.  Probably would have been that much better had I been able to bake it, but then again I do like my cheese mixed in instead of as a topping.

I substitued whole wheat rotini, chopped onion in place of the soup mix and minced garlic in place of garlic powder.  I also added another can of diced tomatoes(without draining), Italian seasoning, diced green peppers and i added mozzarella and parmesean cheeses.  The additions helped.  A good recipe when modified that i will make again.

Mmmm... not my cup of tea.  I used ground turkey, but I think if I made it again, I would use beef.  I would also use half the soup mix.  But I probably won't make it again.  Sorry.

We liked it here.  I didn't add the tomato sauce (didn't feel like getting it)  I used turkey instead of beef.  I thought it was very tasty.  My husband said I could make it again.

Very good, the only thing I did different is use brown pasta and low fat sour cream.  I also sifted out about 1 tsp of the onion soup (just the powder) and that cut down on the saltiness a little.  My husband said to "feel free to make this again anytime!" and he's not a foodie at all, he'll eat anything that is put in front of him with neither complaint nor compliment.

This was pretty good, but for some reason it lacked some zip.  I made it with ground turkey and only used 1/2 the onion soup packet, but it still needed something.  I will make it again, but may experiment with some of the other suggestions.

Adding the onion soup mix gives it a good flavor, but kind of overpowers the whole casserole.  I recommend adding some season salt or other to the ground beef, and possbily leaving the onion soup mix out.

My stepchildren chowed down on this one.  It really tasted good.  Will definitely make this again.

I used ground turkey instead of hamburger because my 4-year-old doesn't like red meat, and since we're watching what we eat i used low-fat sour cream and cheese.  I thought it was really good and very filling. I think next time I'll use onion powder instead of soup mix, too oniony.

I found this recipe to be very simple and quick to make.  It was very good and the children loved it.  The only thing I did different was that I added chopped onion while browning the ground beef.  Overall you really can't go wrong with it, it's simple, quick to make and tastes great.  I'll certainly make it again.

This was an awesome dinner. The only problem I found was a little too much onion soup mix!

This was not a bad casserole, but needs improvement.I would make it using a shorter tubular macaroni product instead of spaghetti. It was also dry and needed a larger can of tomatoes or perhaps a sliced fresh tomato on the top to increase the liquid.  The onion soup mix was a plus as there were no onions to chop. I will use a low fat sour cream next time to cut down on the fat and increase the amount of basil and garlic powder to increase the flavor.

The recipe sounds great - but when I made it, we didn't care for the taste. The onion soup mix makes it taste weird. My 2 year old loved it - but we didn't care for it much.
Thanks

To cutomized, I used bow tie pasta, fat free sour cream, a little marinara with the canned tomatoes, extra garlic, and threw in some light cream cheese.  After browning the meat I cooked the tomatoes and other ingredients in the sauce pan before combining it all with the noodles to bake.  It was good, but needs something . . .

This is really delicious.  I used fat-free sour cream, and added crushed garlic and mushrooms for extra flavor.  I recommend it for a quick, basic casserole with intense, great flavor.

The taste of this recipe was very unique, and most of my family really liked it. The leftovers reheated well the next day in the microwave. The only thing I didn't like about it were the fact that the sauce was very thick, but that would be easy to remedy. I will probably make this again for myself and the kids for a good lunch.

Thanks for the recipe!  I added bread crumbs to the top with the cheese 
and it was delicious! We had company and everyone had 2nds!  My son 
liked it as well. None of the poeple that were here like sour cream, but 
they all devoured supper.  I had no leftovers!

not bad but not entirely fantastic.  I added a little tomato sauce so it wasn't so dry.
