This is an excellent and simple dish. I've made it twice and it is MUCH better with fresh broccoli.  I took 2 heads (about 1 cup) of chopped, fresh broccoli and sauteed with a little EVOO and 2 cloves of chopped garlic, salt and pepper.  I cooked the broccoli until tender but dry (all moisture evaporated) about 10 minutes. This requires a little extra work but makes all the difference. I also used a differed jar of sauce because I'm not a fan of chunky marinara sauces.

The stuffing makes enough to fill more than 18 shells, so boil up a few extra. 
I added a few chopped herbs to the cheese mixture.
Very good, I will make it again.

I love this recipe!  I have made it twice now and I am having so much fun with it.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe pretty close and it came out great and was so easy.  The second time I made it I swaped broccoli for spicy italian sausages and added artichoke hearts to the stuffing.  I also keep changing the sauce up and I added artichoke to that also.  I could probably go on for days about this one.  Can't wait to try out more.

I give this one a solid 5 stars. It's easy and quick to make and it tastes delicious. What more could you want! Instead of buying to types of shredded cheese, I just got a package of "Italian blend." I will make these again!

When I made these I took the suggestions of others and cooked up some extra shells, anticipating extra filling. The extra shells weren't necessary at all. I had just enough filling for the 18 shells and had to find a use for the leftover pasta. This was a great meal and was even better as leftovers. Can't wait to make it again!

I thought these were pretty good.  I'd recommend adding additional seasonings to the ricotta cheese/broccoli mixture.  I sprinkled some extra Parmesan cheese on the shells when serving.

The recipe is a good start, but too tasteless as is.  With some additional spices, this could  be very good.  Will try it again, but make some big changes to add more flavor.

This tasted good, but I felt it was alot of work for something that was just alright. Maybe adding some more veggies and flavor to the stuffing would be better...or maybe I just don't like stuffing manicottis.Good but a bit bland.

Delicious! My three year old is on a 'spinach is yucky' kick, so I did this instead. With a couple additions, it deserves 5 stars... I added garlic powder, onion powder, red pepper flakes and some nutmeg. I also added cheddar cheese in addition to all the other cheeses inside, and some on top with the mozza. I cooked up the whole box of shells expecting a few to break which they did, and I had just the right amount of filling. Yum!

I thought these were really good. My boys weren't crazy about them because of the broccoli of course, so if you have a picky one, they may not like them but the rest of us really like it. They were pretty easy to make and I liked it with fire roasted tomato and garlic sauce over the top.

Good foundation; it just needs enhancement for flavor, as others have written. Next time I will make it with a fresh sauté of broccoli, mushrooms, and garlic. Then I will add Italian spices and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg to the stuffing mix. I might try the suggested Gouda as well. This recipe is worth saving and innovating.

My mom hates to cook so being her kind, loving 22 year old daughter, I am always cooking and looking for new recipes. However, I am vegetarian and this usually poses as a problem but this recipe definitely satisfied even the meat lovers in my family! I would recommend using a little garlic like previous people said. Next time I will add artichokes, mushrooms, and/or spinach! DELICIOUS.

even with a few hunks of crushed garlic, italian seasoning and some sauteed onion, these still weren't a favorite.  but my 1-year-old, who has issue with the texture of broccoli, ate it up (i pureed the filling in my vitamix so it was nice and smooth).

DH and I did not care for this at all.  Used fresh broccoli, which was the only thing that made this worth cooking; the filling would be mushy if using frozen.  I added Italian seasoning to the filling, and DH made his special marinara.  Neither additions redeemed this dish.  Will not be making again.

FANTASTIC.  I even impressed my wife's parents who are avid meat eaters...they loved the vegetarian dinner night!  The only thing that was bad....I didn't get to take a picture of them before they were all GONE!  We made all the shells in the box...not just 18 so I double the fillings to match it.

I made this for my family and it was a big hit.  Next time I'll blanch the broccoli as it was a little too crunchy for my taste.  Thanks for a great recipe that I'm sure to make often.

Made as is it's way too bland for us. I added mushrooms onion and garlic to the cheese mixture. Also, I changed the cheese mixture to 1/2 the amount of ricotta and added gouda. Made this way it was a 4.5

Made according to directions. May family has long been a fan of stuffed shells and were generally pleased with these, although they did mention they like the sauce with the meat better (I usually add browned italian sausage to my red sauce, but then again I usually make my own and for this recipe I did use Paul Newman's Marinara sauce)...I'll make again and just use my own sauce next time...

I have 3 kids (11,5 & 3).  My 5 year old is a very picky eater.  She asked for thirds on this one.  I will need to double the recipe the next time I make it.  I added a bit more parm cheese then what it called for.  this was a great choice for dinner.

My kids LOVED this meal. I have one that won't eat anything that has color, but he ate ALL of his. Some went back for seconds. I gave 4 out of 5 b/c I wish it called for more veggies in the sauce or maybe soy meat crumbles. I will certainly be making this again!

Good recipe! Easy for a beginner like me. I made this tonight with just a hot plate and an Ikea stove. My boyfriend and I loved it, but could only eat about 6 out of the 21 shells. Lots of leftovers. :)

This was a pretty tasty weeknight dinner. I enjoyed the ricotta part of the mixture and used fresh broccoli out of my garden. I am looking forward to making this again.

I made this last night for dinner and I finally came up with a trick to make filling the shells easier. after draining them in a colander, I used a mini muffin pan, and simply scooped each shell onto a hole while they were still hot. This made them open up nicely and let them cool a bit while I was mixing up the filling. I didn't use quite as much broccoli as the recipe called for, but we enjoyed this even though my husband doesn't care for ricotta cheese very much.

This recipe was pretty good, and my whole family liked it. I do think it needs a little bit more flavor - maybe some garlic, Italian seasoning, etc. I think this would also be better with fresh broccoli that has been sauteed (maybe with mushrooms), because I always feel like the frozen broccoli has all of the stems that are not my favorite to eat. But if you are looking for something faster, the frozen broccoli would be the way to go. I'm sure I will make this again sometime since my family liked it, but I will probably make a few changes.

This was a great idea!  I love the idea of merging broccoli and ricotta into a dish like this.  I work full time so I am always looking for meals to make on Sunday (and easy to pop in the oven on a Tuesday).  I did add an egg to this recipe because I am used to using egg in dishes that involve ricotta.  I also used fresh broccoli (cooked it in the microwave for 3 minutes) and put it in the food processor to make it into itty bitty pieces.

Very easy recipe to make. I added one egg to cheese mixture to hold together better and I added basil and oregano to add flavor. I actually didn't use all 18 of my shells, it just depends on how full you fill them. I packed mine pretty full and only used 14 of them. I think garlic and onion would be a nice addition to the recipe as well!
