I wish they had ten stars! Fantastic fried chicken. I’m from the North and live in the South. I never learned the nuances of great Southern fried chicken that you can get everywhere around here. I have been on a quest for the perfect recipe for many years. This is it!! Many recipes sound similar to this one but the ratio of lots of milk to not too much egg or the shaking bag does the trick. Don’t know what it is but the flour really sticks (always a problem that is often corrected by messy double dipping) and gets nice and crispy.  I did change 3 things. I only used ½ a recipe—1 cut up chicken (but used a whole egg) , I added some Paprika to the flour (because many recipes use it) and I fried it in my deep fryer appliance instead of the Dutch oven. I fried larger pieces longer and smaller pieces less. Double dipping was not necessary, plenty of crust. Don’t forget to salt after cooking as it says. That seems to be one of the secrets too. I have to remark that it came out really classically golden and pretty like from a restaurant. Delicious leftover!! Thanks Southern Living.

Yummmmm. Delicious!  I am from Maryland, so of course had to add Old Bay Seasoning (about 1 TBSP.) and it is wonderful!  Going to Linganore Vineyards tomorrow and am bringing this along with Potato Salad and some wonderful cream pies from Southern Living.

Great fried chicken.  Did "double-dip" in milk/egg and flour mixture to give a thicker coating.  Don't have a Dutch oven so used electric fry pan.  Delish!

My family loves this recipe.  I made it one day just to try a new recipe and ever since I did they are always asking for me to make it.  I have tried other recipes but this one is the best that I have ever tasted.

A good recipe that you could certainly play around with to make it your own. Before I started the recipe I marinaded my chicken in buttermilk and hot sauce for several hours. I then seasoned with poultry seasonings, skipped the milk and just used eggs, added paprika to the flour and fried in my cast iron dutch oven. Didn't see the need to add more salt. The chicken came out nice and crispy and very moist. Family loved it.

This is a wonderful recipie. I did as others suggested with the buttermilk and paprika and lowering the salt, but I also had to make a seperate batch for my dad. For those of you on a LOW CARB DIET, instead of flour use 1 part crush porkrines and 1 part soy flour. My family enjoyed the pork rines more than the flour and next time we will use spicy pork rines!! But the original is very good!

I didn't think I could make good fried chicken, but my boyfriend asked for some and I used this recipe.  Ooooh, good!  The coating was thick, crunchy, tasty...my mouth waters thinking of it.  This will be my permanent fried chicken recipe.  (Note: I did do some double-dipping for extra thick coating.)

I'm no good at frying chicken, but this recipe was error-proof.  I loved the way the chicken came out & its very very good served at room temperature - I think the previous reviewer was right, its something about the combo of frying in crisco and salting while the chicken's still warm. I also added paprika to the flour mixture - every respectable southerner should!

Outstanding!  Best fried chicken recipe I have found yet.  In addition I added Old Bay Seasoning, paprika, and poultry seasoning.  Also, I cooked in our deep fat fryer in cooking oil rather than in shortening in a pan.  Great recipe.  Thanks.

Great basic recipe! I used Canola oil since it was all i had and it turned out well. I also added some garlic powder, sage, and paprika for extra flavor. You have to change the oil frequently or it won't properly fry -it'll turn everything black or cook very slow causing the breading to be soggy with oil and not crispy. A great way to test the readiness of the oil is to sprinkle a bit of water into it. If it sizzles, it's hot!

Quick and tasty. A little too salty for our tastes so have cut down on the salt quantity (Just a little).  This is now a firm family favourite - thanks...

I used chicken tenders with that grizzly piece removed out of the middle. I cooked them for 5 minutes in a deep fryer.  These are a hit!  I am always looking for a great fried chicken recipe, and this qualifies hands down!

This recipe is delicious. We absolutely loved it. Our changes were to make it a little more spicy -- marinating 2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts in buttermilk and pepper sauce overnight.. we also added 1/2 tsp. each of poultry seasoning, ground chili, paprika, and ground pepper, 1 tsp each salt and garlic powder. We also double breaded the chicken pieces. Cooked it in peanut oil. Simple and not really messy either. Tastes just like the fast food to us!

Overall this recipe was very tasy. The coating was cripy and golden and did adhere well to the chicken. I found that shaking the chicken in a plastic bag became a little difficult after coating several pieces of chicken as the flour mixture became clumpy and was sticking to the bag so I transferred the mixture to a bowl and rolled the chicken in the flour mixture, it worked just as well. It was a little too salty, I think next time I will cut down or omit the salt from the flour mixture and just spinkle over chicken when done frying. I also added paprika. This recipe would work grat w/ skinless, boneless chicken cut into strips and it also tastes great reheated in the oven-coating stays nice and crisp. I would definetly make this recipe again!

GREAT RECIPE!  I make this all the time now.  I used chicken tender strips, and they turned out great (about 1/2 the cooking time.) I would cut the "sprinkling" salt down to 1/2 tsp, and I used buttermilk.  I never thought fried chicken could be soo easy.  I SWEAR WHEN I DIE MY HUSBAND WILL STILL BE RAVING ABOUT MY FRIED CHICKEN THANKS TO THIS RECIPE!

I made this for my husband my Easter dinner.  We both love fried chicken.  This is a really good recipe.  One of the best.  I did add garlic powder and Lawry's seasoned salt to the flour mixture.  I also fried mine in my deep fryer.  This recipe turned out great!:)  Thanks for sharing!:)

This was a very good recipe.  Very simple!  I dipped the chicken in flour twice and wished that I had increased the flour mixture, because I ran out with only one chicken breaded.

Excellent!  I'm still leaning how to fry chicken properly.  There's a fine line that I need to find between cooking the chicken thoroughly while keeping it from getting to dark (burnt!?) and retaining a golden brown appearance.  I suppose I need to lower the heat after proper browing has been achieved and continue to lift the pieces of chicken so they don't adhere to the bottom of the skillet.  It often seems that the browing is done before the inside of the chicken is done.  Time will tell.  The flavor of this chicken is exceptional and I will use it again, for sure.  I did add paprika and cayenne pepper to the flour as recommended by another reviewer.

its the perfect fried chicken. i used this recipe on thigh pieces only and it still came out perfect. i din use shortening but canola oil and the end result was still delicious. try adding a little cumin or chilli powder to the flour mix for a little extra spice. this is a quick and delicious recipe.

This was very good. I added italian seasoning, accent season salt, and powdered chicken buillon to the flour mix. I also cooked in an iron skillet. Turned out crispy and yummy.

Wow! This chicken turned out perfect. I have tried to make fried chicken before without any real success. This recipe was easy and everyone ate it up. I did change one thing though, I used buttermilk instead of the regular. I also added Paprika as someone else suggested. I will be making this again and again.

Yummy. I soaked my chicken in buttermilk ahead of time. Subbed seasoning salt for the salt, added paprika. This is yummy and I loved the chicken cold! Thanks.

This is a great starting point to creating your own recipe for fried chicken.  I add a little poultry seasoning, cayenne pepper, old bay, and paprika to mine to flour to get the flavor I like.

overall this recipe is good, but i didnt really think the batter mix was thick enough on the chicken; the next time i make this recipe i will dip the chicken through the batter process twice to have a better coating.  i also added about 2 tsp of paprika and cut the salt by half.

This was delicious! The flavor was great. I did cook mine for about 12 min, cause after 10 it didn't look done. 

I will be making this again, for sure!

My husband could not stop bragging about them/. I did use buttermilk instead of regular milk, and added 1 1/2 teaspoons of paprika to the flour mixture.

Really good stuff. Used buttermilk and canola oil although crisco probably gives it a little more crispiness...kids loved it...next time I'll use an iron skillet as someone suggested and the paprika and maybe some shredded unsweetened coconut. Thanks for the great recipe!

I used this recipe and it turned out great. I am gluten intolerant so I substituted the flour for a combo of Rice flour, potato starch, and tapioca flour (6,2,1 ratio) and it still came out great. I also used it on some onions and made some tasty onion rings. It had been a while since I had been able to have fried foods due to my food sensitivity.

We really liked this recipe but I felt it needed more flavor in the breading so I added McCormicks Chicken Seasonings.  Came out pretty good.
