An excellent recipe. Easy and very tasty.
I agree with the previous reviewer that the rolls are a tad salty (I would also cut down on the teriyaki). I thought the peanut sauce, however, was excellent as is.
I fried the rolls and have a piece of advice on that front: use two rice papers to wrap each roll. With only one, they often burst in the oil!

These were SO delicious and I'm anxious to make them again adding in a few other goodies (like avocado) to the mix.    The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the recipe as it stands is a bit off.   As others have noted, the filling shrinks way down once you "toss" it and I ended up having to double it to fill 4 rice papers.   I also followed the advice of many others before me and halved the Teriyaki across the board.   Perfect advice.   Do the hot sauce to your own taste too.  If you like it hot, go with 2 T.   If you want it mild, cut it back to 1 T.   

If you've never worked with rice paper sheets before, they are a cinch!   Run under the faucet (both sides) and then place on a cutting board 1 or 2 at a time.   Within a minute the paper softens up and gets pliable.   Roll them as TIGHT as possible or they will fall apart when trying to eat later. 

The peanut sauce is AWESOME!!   Mine came out way too thick so I doubled the sesame oil and also added 2-3 T. of water for the right texture.    Again gauge the hot sauce to your own taste.

This looked like a good recipe but something was missing.  I added mung bean noodles and thin strips of cucumber which worked very well.  I also added a second layer of rice paper because the single layer kept tearing. I brought the finished rolls to a party and they were a hit.  All in all very delicious and I'll make them again soon.

This was a nice easy dish, though I would recommend to halve the teriaki sauce in both the salad and the peanut sauce. Both were a little salty. I also added some sprouts and coriander (cilantro) to the salad to make it a little more Asian.

We love spring rolls but they can usually be a bit bland. I like the concept of seasoning the vegetables and grilling the shrimp to add flavor. That being said, I still favor using the traditional rice vermicelli noodles and a thin wedge of cucumber as part of the filling. Adding the noodles will stretch the filling ingredients to at least twice the number of rolls. It balances the intensity of the seasonings.

I took this to a 4th of July picnic and it was a hit. I used a lot more napa cabbage, because once you toss it with the sauce it wilts and goes down in volume. 
I think next time I might try adding some diced cucumber or fresh beans sprouts to add a bit more texture to the fill. 

If you double or triple the recipe you don't have to do the same with the sauce there was more than enough. 

Someone in the group was allergic to peanuts and he thought they were great just plain. 

I will definitely make this again

I just made the spring roll portion of this recipe. it was quite good. I had a package of regular shredded cabbage on hand so I used that instead of the napa cabbage. I was making a thai peanut chicken dish so I just dipped these in that sauce. I baked mine a bit and theyw ere good that way but i think tonight I'll try them as they are.

I made the recipe using some fresh perch I caught.  I wrapped the mix in egg roll wrappers and then baked them @ 400 degrees for 10 minutes in the oven.  I agree w/ cutting the teriyaki sauce in half.  I also found the sauce to spicy for my taste, so cut the hot sauce in half.  Overall, very good.  The family loved them.

I have not tried this recipe, but it sounds excellent.  My reason for reviewing is to share the method I learned for working with the rice paper wrappers:  fill a wide, shallow bowl with hot water and slide the wrapper in.  Let sit until soft, then remove carefully, fill and roll.  They do need to be handled with care.  It works best if you change the water in the bowl every few wrappers.

These were yummy.  The possibilities are endless.  I've been making lumpia for 30 years.  I usually saute the filling (I use pork, bagged slaw, add garlic & onions), let it cool a bit & wrap in only romaine leaves.  You can use just about any combo of vegetables & cooked meat or make them totally vegetarian.  Serve raw in rice papers or lettuce or wrap in a spring roll or egg roll wrapper and deep fry.  For dipping, I make an egg foo young sauce; cornstarch, soy sauce, etc.  You can even use sweet and sour sauce out of the bottle.  And of course, there's peanut sauce.  Make it your own.  They go fast at parties!  Just be sure you cook your meat thoroughly.

These were fab! I also used some bagged cabbage to save time because I had to make a bunch of them. If you are having trouble with the wrappers ripping, you might be getting them too wet. Just dampen them and allow the water to be absorbed.

The portions seemed totally bizarre - way too much liquid in the rolls. Meanwhile, the sauce was REALLY thick. Decent flavor once I adjusted with more cabbage & carrot, but I think I'll search for another recipe that requires less tweaking.

These were good.  Would be better with less salt.  Will do what others have done to modify the salt content.  As far as this go round - was easy, simple, fresh, great hot summer night dinner.  Will make again - but less salt.

Very nice flavor but things didn't come together for me.  The veggie/teriyaki sauce was too watery and then affecting my rolling--they ended up a little goopy.  The peanut sauce was delicious but super super thick so I added a fair amount of hot water, to thin it out.  Then I tried the suggestion of baking them as I don't have a grill and I knew frying them wouldn't work b/c they were too goopy--but did the 10 minutes as suggested by another poster and the wrapper was gooey.  Taste wise, the flavors were so nice and it seemed like a healthy recipe with potential but it was way too garlicky for me.

Spring rolls were great.  We chose to fry them. The peanut sauce was too heavy and over powered the taste of the roll.  I would recommend a sweet chili sauce or a nuoc mam Cham sauce to compliment the delicate favors of the shrimp.  Will definitely make them again but not with this sauce.

I prepared the recipe exactly, other than following the advice of many and reducing the amount of teriyaki sauce.  The garlic and ginger flavor was so overpowering that it drowned out every other flavor in the rolls.  Strange, because both of us have eaten some pretty creative Asian/Oriental recipes (we used to live near NY and went to Chinatown often), but this dish was just plain bad.
