This recipe has potential.  Prepared according the recipe the meal is bland and dry.  Saute the chicken in the oil, garlic and pepper flakes.  I added  thyme and basil to taste.  Double the amount of the chicken and the asparagus or do equal parts of asparagus and yellow peppers.  I also added 4 chopped roma tomatoes.  Add tomatoes at the very end so they are warm and not cooked.  To the penne I added 3-4 tablespoons of butter with an equal amount of half and half and 3/4 to 1 cup of asiago, romanno and parmesan blend.  This makes the penne creamy.  You could also add sliced black olives if desired.  Salt and pepper to taste and serve.  The extra chicken and vegetables makes this a hearty 1 dish meal.

I took the suggestion of another rater and cooked my chicken with some vintage white wine, seasoned the chicken with onion powder, salt, pepper, and some crushed basil. I also simmered the asparagus in the white wine with minced garlic, fresh mushrooms, and just a dab of butter for a richer flavor. Then, seeing that previous reviews had dubbed this recipe "too dry," once the pasta was finished, I mixed in Sun Dried Tomato Alfredo sauce (from a jar, I digress) before adding my chicken and vegetables. I threw everything into my largest Pyrex mixing bowl, mixed it, and sprinkled shredded Parmesan cheese over top... and popped it in a 250 oven for 20 minutes. The dish came out FANTASTIC. It was so delicious, my  super picky "hates everything" room mate Jim plowed through three servings. I will definitely be making this for my boyfriend to impress him...

This was very delicious, and I will definitely make it many times in the future.  I made some slight variations based on past reviews, but I'm sure it would have been just as good straight from the recipe.  I cooked the chicken in the olive oil, red pepper flakes, garlic, and kosher salt.  When the chicken was about halfway done, I added about 1/4 cup of white wine.  I added the asparagus to the boiling water with the pasta for the last 3 minutes of cooking.  While the pasta was draining, I stirred in halved grape tomatoes into the chicken just to heat them through and then tossed everything together.  I loved this light meal -- it was quick, easy, and delicious!

As previous reviews have stated: this recipe is very dry and bland as is!  I love asparagus so I decided to give it a second chance only ‘kicking it up a notch’ by sautéing one yellow pepper, ½ a medium size red onion, 1 cup sliced cherry tomatoes and 3 leaves of fresh basil along with the red pepper, asparagus and garlic.  I also took other reader’s advice and added 1 cup of low sodium chicken broth to the pasta mixture.  This was wonderful!!!!  Sooo yummy I can’t wait to cook it again   The fresh basil really added to the spicy red pepper and garlic taste while the chicken broth kept things moist.  Enjoy!

The first time I made this, I thought it was bland and the flavors didn't mix well.  After experimenting several times, this is my favorite new dish.  This is what I did:  I seasoned the chicken lightly with Lawry's Salt before sauteing it, then I also doubled the garlic and pepper (I like garlic and spicy foods).  I then used about 8-10 ounces of pasta and substituted the asparagus with some other greens (for example, buck-choi) and then added the noodles to the chicken mixture and let it simmer in chicken broth.  Topped off with parmesan, it's excellent!

This was my first real kitchen experience; mom was tired, and it was MY turn to do dinner.  As a 17-year-old, I know I'm a bit behind in the cooking arena...honestly, the most I'd ever attempted before was pancakes.  So imagine the family's surprise when I was able to serve them this delicious and somewhat complicated-looking dish!  Not to mention MY surprise when it all went smoothly...truly a quick and easy recipe.  It was delicious, and I can't wait to cook again.  The only alteration I was brave enought to attempt was to use more than one tbl. spoon of olive oil to saute the chicken, and to add a bit of salt while it was sizzling; it added a lot of flavor to the chicken, very tasty!

This was ok. Needs some color maybe a red bell pepper. Some garlic and onion. I also added a little bit of chicken broth because it was a little dry.

I'm not much of a cook, and this was my first time online searching for recipes.  I really liked this recipe and my family did, too.  My 12 year old decided she liked asparagus!  I used the roma tomatoes (never tried them before either) and the chicken broth as suggested in one of the reviews.  Thanks to all you who wrote reviews, it truly helps us reluctant cooks.

Great recipe. I did a 3 things different though. 1)I baked my chicken breasts whole in olive oil, garlic powder and parsley. We like to have a piece of meat seperate from the pasta. 2)I added chicken broth and a little lemon juice to the aspargus sauce. 3) I used Romano and Parmesan cheese. I will make this again!

This was really really good!!  My kids even liked it.  I took some suggestions from other reviewers, sauted the garlic and some onion first, then added the chicken.  I added about 3/4c of white cooking wine when the chicken was about done, and added the asparagus and cooked it all togethers.  I added just a bit of butter, asagio cheese and it was perfect!!  I actually forgot to add the parmesan cheese - we didn't miss it at all!!  THANKS!

This recipe is really good.  Although I'm sure it didn't need it, I added a few more things just because I was feeling adventurous.  I added some slices of red bell pepper, whole mushrooms, and some jumbo prawns.  My husband and I loved it.

I've given this one two chances now, but have to give it the permanent thumbs-down.  My husband begged me to throw the recipe out so I wouldn't make it again by accident.  It is very bland and, as my husband says, there's not enough "good stuff" in it -- just lots and lots of pasta.

I like to grill the chicken for more flavor (sprinkle with garlic, sp) then cut up into small chunks and add to skillet with grape tomatoes. I've added feta before which was good too. the tomatoes give it some liquid.

Thought this was excellent.  Prepared everything as written except I had left over chicken breast that had been grilled the other day, just finished that up.  Will be using this in the future and will probably add some of my favorite...mushrooms.

This was a fantastic, quick meal.  I followed the directions to a tee, but also added a can of diced tomatoes.  SO good...and my picky husband even ate the asparagus!

This recipe looked really bland and dry as-is, so I admit I made some adjustments.  I used boiled, on-the-bone, dark meat chicken and cut it up then browned it in olive oil, garlic, onions, and crushed red pepper.  I then added the asparagus, made a rue of flour and butter, then added milk, salt and pepper.  Very good that way, and I'll likely make it again, noting those changes.

This was a pretty good, different dish thanks to the red pepper flakes! I did not add that many (per previous reviews) and before I served I added some chicken broth granules & water to make it less dry. I will definitely make this again! Great way to use asparagus!

Really good, but I changed it quite a bit. I added 1/2 cup diced white onion, mushrooms, dry cooking wine, and a little extra olive oil and reduced it down before adding the asparagus. I also added just a little butter to the pasta before tossing. My husband loved it, but said it might be a little spicy for him. Not too spicy for me though!

This was really good!  I made a few changes, though.  After the asparagus is tender, I squeezed half a lemon over it, added halved cherry tomatoes (about a cup) and a tbsp. light butter and heated it through.  I also used gemelli pasta, but that doesn't make a difference unless you're a texture person.  Delicious!

My husband and I really enjoyed this pasta dish.  It was a good blend of spices and the asparagus gave it a good crunch. I should have added some tomatoes for extra flavor and texture as some of the reviews noted. I will definitely make again. Thanks, Erin

I don't know if I did something wrong, but the flavor just didn't complement each other well. We made the asparagus last night just by itself, and it was excellent. We had chicken with it, but not in the same dish, and it was better. I don't know why, but it worked better for us separated. I won't make the dish again, but I'll use the recipe for the asparagus (and perhaps other veggies as well).

This recipe was delightful. I followed the additional steps suggested in previous posts. I added red bell peppers, thyme, basil, mushrooms and a garlic alfredo sauce to the noodles. Saute the bell peppers with the chicken and then add the other ingredients. The asparagus and mushrooms should go in last to ensure they don't get over cooked.

We really like this, I've made it several times. It's quick and easy and flavorful. If you salt and pepper to taste, as the recipe says, it won't be bland.  I add a bit more red pepper, 'cause we like spice, and sometimes I've tossed it in a little butter or extra EVOO, but I don't think it's necessary.  If you require your pasta to be saucy, you may want to try it that way.

This is a big favorite in our family.  My teenager says she could eat it every day.   We don't find it dry, as other reviewers say -- and we make it just as the recipe calls for.  Give it a try -- maybe you'll enjoy it as much as we do!

I made this dish, with my oldest son's help, for my wife for our anniversary/valentine's day.  This was a fairly easy dish to make and tasted great!  The only thing that I did different, was to add 2 TBSP of butter before tossing with the pasta.  The wife says that this one is definately a keeper.

I've made a variation of this recipe before, using spaghetti noodles and adding mushrooms.  When there's about 3 mins. left, I cook the asparagus with the noodles, rather than in the skillet.  Also, try adding white wine or broth to keep it from being too dry. It's a very easy recipe and is great for weekday meals.

I thought it was quite tasty.  I made no modifications.  My daughter is quite picky, but she really enjoyed it as well.  Even my ten year old son finished his plate.  I will definitely fix this again!

I made this dish for my mothers birthday dinner. It was quick, easy, and a hit. It was just the right amount of spicy and it didn't need to be salt or peppered. If you cook this amount its more for 4 people than 8. Only 5 people were eating it when I made it and we almost didn't have enough.

This recipe turned out pretty well except for the fact that the meal was dry (needed some kind of sauce), and the ratio of pasta to asparagus/chicken was off.  Perhaps if you reduce the amount of Penne pasta to 12 oz instead of 16 oz it would turn out a bit better.

No flavor at all. Good base recipe though. We ended up making a pouch of pesto sauce to dress it with.

This recipe was very good but I don't recommend the crushed red pepper flakes! I did add 1/2 lb of sliced mushrooms with the asparagus, garlic, and red peeper. I didn't fully cook the asparagus. After, I added 1/4 cup of chicken broth. I put chicken and pasta in with the asparagus and season until broth was fully gone. It's a very good recipe but a little hot for a pasta dish.

Fantastic!  Made just as is (for the most part) and it turned out great.  Cooked the chicken with same seasonings as the asparagus.  Hubby said he preferred the asparagus a little softer (boiled, vs. sauteed) but I thought it was great as is!

As written, this recipe is dry and somewhat boring. If I make it again I will use additional olive oil, more cheese, and toasted pine nuts.

I made this pasta for dinner tonight, and I thought it was fantastic, with a few adjustments. I too added about 1/4c white wine to the chicken just before it was fully cooked. I like spicy dishes so I also added a jalapeno pepper to simmer in with the wine and chicken to add some extra kick.  I added about half a chopped onion to the asparagus when I cooked it too. It turned out great!

I followed this recipe as is and then added the mushrooms and dried tomatoes as others suggested.  I really enjoyed the recipe, but thought the pepper flakes was way too much.  I will definately make this again, but will not put as much as the recipe calls for, It was just way tooo hot.

I was inspired by this recipie to use up a few odds & ends--shredded rotisserie chicken, a few asparagus spears, penne. I cooked the penne, steamed the asparagus in the micro with garlic & red pepper flakes and heated the chicken - mixes it all with the drained pasta.  Added about a 1/3 a cup of non-fat sour cream and some crumbled feta. Served hot with a spinich salad. Yummy! and even better there are leftovers for tomorrow.

This is a great recipe to build upon. I added a couple of tablespoons of butter, thinly sliced red onion, basil, and mushrooms to the asparagus and olive oil saute. I also added equal parts chicken broth and white wine. Right before adding the pasta to the sauce, I chopped some grape tomatoes in half and added them to the sauce, just to warm them through, without letting them over cook and get totally mushy. I also substituted fresh feta crumbles for the parmesean. Great dish overall.

Make this perfect with 1/2 cup chicken broth, 1 tsp crushed red peppers and 1 totmaot dieced.  Make it with 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts and 3 tablespoons of olive oil, 2 for cooking and 1 for drizzling.  Makes for a PERFECT meal, just add some salad and maybe bread,

Good and simple. It's not going to change your life, but it makes a good meal. For a little added taste, add some shallots. Also, I would have prefered my asparagus a little softer, so might boil a little beforehand next time. Otherwise, pretty good.

The first time I made this I felt it was missing something, but since then have been adding about 3 tablespoons of lemon juice during the last step and now we love this dish. It's been a great way to get my kids to eat asparagus!

This recipe definitely has great potential.  I cook this for my family and the kids couldn't eat it because it was too spicy.  My husband and I liked it, but it was too dry.  I only used about 1/4 the amount of Penne the recipe called for.  If I make this again I will cut down on the amount of red pepper and penne and add twice the amount of chicken and asparagus.  Maybe add some chicken broth to the skillet while the asparagus and garlic is cooking so that it won't be so dry.  I used whole wheat penne that could have had something to do with it.  Who knows!  Decent recipe, good flavor just needs some adjustments.

This recipe has potential if you add what you like. It was pretty dry, so I added lots of butter and more parmesan cheese and everyone said they liked it. Good idea to add cherry tomatos at the end, I will try next time.

I followed this recipe pretty much exactly, except I added some zucchini and cherry tomatoes to the asparugus mixture at the end.  It turned out very well, and I will definitely make it again.

This was way rto spicy- If I make this again I would add 1/2 amount of red pepper. I also needed to add more olive Oil because it was too dry.

Great and very easy!!! Make sure you actually know how to saute the chicken. It makes all the difference in the world. I tossed the penne in a tablespoon of butter. I will definitely make again.

I added some onions like someone suggested and also about 1/4 cup chicken broth. It was still a little dry so I would add some more next time. This will be excellent with alfredo sauce!

I love asparagus and chicken...so I was bound to enjoy this recipe. I added 3/4 of a can of cream of celery and 1/4 cup of chicken broth to this recipe because it was too dry for me without it. I enjoyed it and it was pretty easy to make.

I made this several  nights ago, and I was happy with the results.  I used the precooked Italian chicken strips, so that saved me a bunch of time.  I drizzled some extra virgin olive oil over the finished dish, as it seemed a little dry to me.  Leftovers were good, too.  You can probably experiment a lot with this dish, added different spices and veggies!  I will make this again!

Spicy goodness.  I added a bit of water when cooking the asparagus and it made them cook a little faster and got rid of some of the spiciness.

It was delicious. Not dry or bland AT ALL, as others say. Maybe they didn't make it with enough oil or added salt. I added 2 cups of chopped fresh spinach to the chicken garlic mixture at the end and let it steam covered for a couple of minutes before tossing with the pasta. Extra iron.

I put a tiny twist on this dish I suggest others to try. First of all, this recipe needs more chicken and asparagus. That's for sure. When frying up the chicken, I seasoned it with a little salt n pepper, some pizza seasoning (yes, pizza seasoning) and a little thyme, oregano, basil and sage. I sauteed the asparagus in olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette with chopped onions, garlic, and red pepper. When I added the chicken back in, I threw a splash of lemon juice in the mix. Dish turned out quite good I think. Give my  few additions a try and add your own :]

Delicious and super easy! I added broccoli for a finicky teenager who doesn't like asparagus and mushrooms as well! I even received a compliment from her on how delicious it was and to please make it again! What a great compliment from my toughest critic! Thank you for sharing it with us!

I made this for dinner this evening and found this dish to be ok. Quite dry...as others have stated.  I did use butter with olive oil to sauté the chicken and asparagus. Also I did add white wine for flavor and liquid, as I found this dish in need of great help!  I will not be making this dish again. But I love this site!

good base idea but definitely needs a sauce. I also thought it had too much garlic and peppers. I cut it into about half of what the recipe calls for and it was still very strong.

I will definitely make this again.  It was very good.  I like recipes like this because you can throw in almost anything you like.  I added what I had in the refrigerator, mushrooms, onion, roasted red peppers, yellow pepper and added some mozzarella along with the parmesan that was in the recipe.  It was delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made the recipe pretty much according to the original instructions except I added fresh cherry tomatoes, fresh basil and fresh mozzarella cheese.  It was pretty good.  I also added white wine when I sauteed the chicken and veggies as others recommended.  The dish was pretty good.  I made a second batch exactly the same but added jalepeno pecan pesto and it took the recipe from 4 to 5 stars.

I cut this one down to 3 servings and boy do i wish i had made more!  I had mushrooms on hand so i added those to the asparagus saute.

All in all a good recipe.  I like my food a bit spicy so i added more red pepper flakes.

Definitely a break from the norm hum-drum pasta dish!

I did mine differently...like other people said I cooked the chicken with olive oil AND white wine vinegar...I also aded a little bit of cream of chicken soup to give it more of a saucy taste. I didn't have crushed red pepper so I just added some red bell pepper along with the asparagus. All in all it was a good light meal.

This recipe was quick,easy and tasty.  I used it as an alternative to a "heavy" pasta dish.  My husband really liked it, and he usually doesn't touch any pasta unless it is covered in a red sauce!  I liked the kick the red pepper flakes gave to the dish.  Overall, I found it a good recipe!

Family enjoyed the dish. It's a good, quick meal.  Of course I added extra garlic because I'm a garlic fiend!  Next time, I might add some chicken broth or even better, some white wine so it's a little less dry.  The family liked it so I'm happy!

This recipe was very quick and easy to make. I substituted the Asparagus with spinach, and it turned out great! The garlic along with the crushed red pepper added a great flavor to this dish!

Ive made this recipe quite a bit and we really enjoy it. We mix it up and occasionally add red and green peppers or broccoli, its also really good if you melt some mozzarella cheese on top when its finished cooking.

Really good recipe - I followed another reviewer's suggestion and added some chicken broth to the pan to deglaze.  My husband loved it and it's a keeper.

Fantastic "base" recipe - I added store-bought pesto and my family loved it. I think it'd be good with shrimp substituted for the chicken too.

This was a good easy recipe.  I added extra asparagus because I love it.  The only thing is might be missing is a sauce.  The pasta seemed dry.

Very good, very spicy as well though, can be good or bad depending on your preference.  Would add more cheese and maybe some more veggies.  Loved the asparagus this way!  Will definately make again, thanks!!!

This dish definitely needs additional flavor.  My crew was happy with kalamata olives and fresh tomatoes.  For extra olive flavor, pour in some of the olive juice.  Also note that the spiceyness diminishes after a day in the fridge.

Absolutely disappointing.  All heat with no flavor, besides the overwhelming flavor of the asparagus.  Sorry but this was not balanced enough for me.

I made a half batch of this last night, and with one modification, it was great! I saw the reviews about it being dry, but when I make "sauceless" pasta, I always save a cup or two of the pasta cooking water to add a bit at a time when I mix everything together. It sort of glazes the dish and gives it that little bit of extra moisture. I found it a bit "summery" for late October (the asparagus), but I'm going to make a nice white wine cream sauce for the leftovers and add some peas to increase the veggie content.

I would use a whole pound of chicken instead of 3/4 and 50% more aspragus.  However, it is delecious. Very easy!!!

I did not care for this dish.  It was VERY bland and dry.  I wasn't sure that I'd like it to begin with, but was craving asparagus.  I should have steamed a bowl of asparagus and just ate that.  It would have tasted the same - and would have been cheaper and quicker to prepare.  Thanks anyways.

This is a somewhat bland recipe, which is great if you're looking for something on the light side and want a break from dishes that involve a lot of butter or cream.

I cooked the chicken with some white wine at the end, as others recommended.  Also did the fast tip of cooking the asparagus w/the pasta for the last 3 min of boiling.

To the chicken I also added thyme because I happened to have some lying around and think the flavor went well with the dish.  I've made this dish a few times and this last time tried it without the red pepper flakes.  I like the dish with and without the flakes, but think that the flavors of the dish flow better without the flakes.

Lastly, be sure to serve with bread.

This dish is extremely easy to make, and tastes even better with whole wheat penne noodles.  The red pepper flakes add just the right amount of spice.  This is a new staple.  Even my spiceaphobe husband complimented me.

Very good! I used a little less red pepper flakes, and I chopped up turkey bacon and added it when I put in the asparagus. It may sound odd, but it really added extra flavor!

Very, very good! The only thing I eased up on was the amount of red pepper flakes and I also added about a 1/4 cup of low sodium chicken broth when I added the pasta to the asparagus/chicken mixture. Would definately make this again.

I made a few changes to this dish and I thought it turned out very healthy and tasty.  I took others' advice and only used 8 oz of pasta and it was the perfect amount.  I added a can of stewed tomatoes and a cup of chicken broth to the asparagus and garlic and I grilled the chicken on my George Foreman grill before I added it to the asparagus/tomato mixture.  I didn't use any oil, which cut down the fat content.  It was just spicy enough for me and it wasn't too dry.  I am not an asparagus lover, but I liked the taste of this dish and I will definitely make it again.

I took a couple of reviewers' ideas -- less pasta (I used 8oz) and seasoning the chicken breast pieces (creole seasoning) -- and this turned out great.  Leftovers were good too.  With less pasta, this served 4.

Yum!  This is very good.  Use thin asparagus or else it will be too crunchy.  Let the vegetable/chicken mixture cook long enough, stirring enough, and it will get a nice roasted taste.  You could add lemon juice; I added bell peppers.  I wouldn't put in tomatoes because that would overhwhelm "subtle" flavours , but to each his/her own.  Doesn't take too long to make either.

Actually I'd rate this a 3 1/2;  my fiance a 5.  I used half the pasta, a dash of onion flakes (ran out of chili pepper), and an extra clove of garlic to satisfy my pallate.  I found it pretty good.  She added some cream of celery for more consistency and loved it.  But I thought that the addition killed the distinctive taste of the asparagus, garlic, and chicken.

This recipe is great.  My whole family enjoyed.  I used no olive oil.   After I stirfied the chicken I took it out.  I still had a bit of liquid in the pan and I added the asparagus.  I added red pepper and italian seasoning, andnot quite a teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  I also added three roma tomatoes cut up.  Rather than mixing together, we spooned the penne on out plate and added the rest, then sprinkled with parmesan.   Definitely will make again.  Low fat with no oil.

This is a good recipe.  I add a little extra seasonings.  I add a little cajun, and some rosemary and garlic. Also, I make about a cup of cream sauce and pour it on before the pasta.  Very good :)

Not the best pasta recipie I have ever tried.  I agree that there was too much pasta, and it was a little too dry for my taste.  I refridgerated the leftovers and added a little vinegar....as a pasta salad, its pretty darn good!

Everything about this recipe was great except for the asparagus.  The flavor just didn't blend with the chicken and penne the way I thought it should.  If I make this again (not sure yet), I might try zucchini or broccoli.  My husband really liked it though.

This is delicious!  Great flavor and low in fat!  I added a little more garlic, a chopped tomato (I'll add 2 tomatoes next time), and 1/2 cup chicken broth and it came out perfect!  If you don't care for too much spice, then I would put 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes.  I used 3/4 tsp and it was perfect for me!  I also used about 3/4 of the penne package. My son and husband love this dish.  A must try!

This was a tasty recipe, although it was somewhat dry.  I added some chicken broth, chopped sun-dried tomatoes, and cut the red pepper in half.  The chicken broth added some moisture, the tomatoes some additional color and taste.

Wonderful.  We'll probably be eating this once a week while asparagus is plentiful.  After the asparagus season, I think I'll experiment with other vegies.  Thanks for this easy, healthy and especially YUMMY recipe.

I halved the amount of red pepper flakes because my husband and I are "wimps" when it comes to spicy, but it sure was good.  Even my 5 year old loved it.

This recipe was fantabulous. It was easy and quick to prepare. We added a little of our own to the recipe when we added some mushrooms. We enjoyed the spicy dish.

My husband who is picky absolutely LOVED IT!!! My kids actually did not. I like it too. I did add yellow and orange peppers and peas(frozen) my husband is actually having a second helping as I’m writing this review I also added some chicken broth. So all in all it is a great dish.

We liked it well enough but as written it would have been bland. I dressed it up significantly.  Adding spices to the chicken, boullion to create sauce.  I also had to use up two red bell peppers. The asparagus and peppers combined with the crushed red peppers was so very good.

I only rated this 5 if it's doctored up. It's an excellent base recipe. I marinated the chicken pieces in Italian dressing, a little bit of teriyaki, seasoning salt, pepper, onion powder, Mrs. Dash, and garlic powder. I sautéed the chicken in the olive oil, set it aside, then cooked asparagus, red pepper strips, and onion. After sweating those, I added the chicken back in with chicken stock, white wine, more seasoning including basil (which I thought really made a difference). I cooked, covered, for a few minutes, then added mushrooms. With about 2 minutes left, I increased the heat slightly, and added cherry tomatoes. To finish, before bringing to the table, I added fresh chopped parsley and fresh, shaved, parmigiana cheese. Again, a great base recipe that just needed a little boost.

This was great.  Going to use this as a base and try adding in or swapping for other veggies.  This tasted like it was from a restaurant or catering company.  I will put this into my regular rotation of meals.

This worked out great. It's a simple meal and was just what I wanted for my lunch at work. I shared it with my brother in Texas and he made it and left me with this good suggestion, add some bacon to amp up the flavor profile. I agree. But this recipe was quick, easy and travel well.

I sauteed the garlic in butter, then added chicken and a small amount of white wine until the chicken was cooked. Next, I added the asparagus and put the lid on the pan until the asparagus turned bright green. Then mixed with the pasta and served with parmesan. Both adults liked it and more importantly, my 4 year old loved it!

The taste is a little bland if you don't add the Parmesan cheese. But as far as recipes go, this one was quick and easy. The longest part was dicing the garlic and cutting the asparagus, which barely took any time at all. Another winner.

We really like this recipe.  Changes we've made to suit our tastes are:  Only 1/2 box of pasta, Only 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes, add 1 cup of chicken broth or 1/4 cup white wine, add grape tomatoes.

This was really good and easy to make in a short amount of time!  It was not dry at all.  The only alteration I made was to add more garlic as to my preference.  Definitely noted down to use again in the future =)

I made this tonight for myself and pre-teen boys.  I was concerned about it being dry so when I drained the pasta, I saved some of the water.  I added it to the asparagus and chicken with just a little mozzarella cheese.  It was so good.  Everybody enjoyed it.  I'll make again.

this recipe has become a family stand-by classic.  we make it frequently, and without fail, as soon as it is set on the table, exclamations of delight ring out from all family members (and we have a family of very very picky eaters who never agree on any meal, so this is truly a miracle dish).  thank you for the awesome, fast, healthy, and absolutely delicious recipe!

This was really good. I cooked the chicken in a covered casserole dish with the oil and spices. Added broccoli and cooked vegtables sepperately. After the chicken was done I diced it and added it to the pasta with the acumulated juices.

This is delicious.  It has become a mainstay and company dinner in our house.  Easy to make and tastes great.  Try it with shrimp instead of chicken.  Really good.

It didn't taste bad...there was just nothing very good about it.  The dish was plain and seemed like the kind of thing that I could come up with by throwing together a few random ingredients laying around my house.  Not a meal worth planning.

I tried this recipe the other night! I thought the basic recipe was very good, but I did add some things as well. Instead of just the red pepper flakes, salt & pepper, I added dried parsley, cilantro, and a bit of cumin for taste. It made the dish much more flavorful. I think the dish might have been just heat with no flavor otherwise. 
Next time I think I will also add some white wine to the mix as was suggested. 
Great overall dish!

I had to defrost the chicken... so while that was happening, I cooked the asparagus.  I used quite a bit more garlic (crushed) and added white wine (not sure how much... just dumped some in) and cooked the veg in that.

Then removed the asparagus and cooked the chicken in the left over oil/wine/garlic.

It was lovely.  Oh, and I added some extra olive oil to the pasta and then served the chicken & asparagus on top.

Nice recipe but WAY too spicy for us. I guess cooking the pepper flakes in the oil with the garlic really intensified them.  I used some shrimp that I had instead of chicken and ended up adding a can of diced tomatoes to cut the heat a little.

It's not my favorite, but it's good. I did cook my chicken with some white wine, and I covered my asparagus mixture while cooking, so that the asparagus could get more tender.  It does need a little more color and less red pepper flakes.  I don't think I will make it again, but I may make some variation of it.

This recipe was tasty, light, and satisfying. It did turn out a bit dry, and so I ended up adding olive oil and plenty of salt - in future endeavors, I will certainly try the white wine, though I don't know if I'd add anything else for fear of losing the subtlety of the recipe.

Though the suggestions about tomato, basil, and onions are tempting...

SUPER quick and easy.  The family loved it.  I cut back the olive oil a tad to save calories and cut back the red pepper to about half because I thought the kick would be too much for the kids.

Easy and light.  I'll definitely do this one again.

I cooked the chicken with the spices and olive oil, and it made it very flavorful.  I was surprised at how well flavored this whole dish was, but it really was a wonderful meal.  We added oregano, basil, and parsley, along with extra red pepper flakes since we like spicy things.

This was my first time cooking fresh asparagus, and it went okay.  I decided to boil them with the pasta for a little while, and that worked well.

Just tried out this recipe - very tasty!  Although I did make a couple changes: like others said, I put a little white wine into the asparagus "stir-fry", and also added tomatoes and onions out of personal preference.  Also spiced the chicken before cooking, and bathed the whole thing in a marinara sauce at the end(b/c as others have said, it was a little dry without sauce).... so I guess it resembles the original recipe only a little?  Nevertheless, turned out delicious!

The asparagus was crispy and the red pepper flakes gave it a kick.

Great recipe! I would either eliminate the red pepper flakes or only add half of the reccomended amount. When cooking this dish people will come running from the delicous smell!

This was really good, but I made a few small adjustments.  I cooked the chicken and asparagus in chicken stock and cut down on the red pepper flakes.  The chicken stock kept it from being dry and added some more depth to the recipe.  Next time I'll try it with white wine as suggested in other reviews.  This was a nice, light dinner; great for a spring day.

It's like a gourmet meal at home!  I will be making this again and again!  If you are looking for a healthier alternative to regular pasta try this with wheat penne pasta.  The wheat pasta has a more wholesome taste to it and makes for a healthier pasta dish.  This was great!

This was OK, not great for me. I had a hard time getting anyone esle to eat it, so I ended up having it for alot of lunches. Maybe too dry... I'm not real sure what the problem was. I usually love this kind of dish, but something was missing here. I probably won't make this one again.

Very tasty and easy to make. I did alter it a little, I added cajun seasoning to the other spices.  Will reduce the amount of pasta called for next time.  Was great for leftovers the next day.  I didn't need to add any chicken broth to it, was tasty just the way it was.

This dish is spicy but the red pepper flakes can be altered to taste!  Other than that, this is a good recipe.

We did not care for this recipe.  The flavors didn't mix well, it was dry and not very tasty.  We had to add a jar of spaghetti sauce which made it OK.  I think it would be good with an alfredo sauce which I will try with the leftovers.

Very good! Everyone in the family liked this dish. I added 1 cup of chicken broth and 1 15 ounce can of diced tomatoes to the asparagus while cooking.

What a great dinner!  My husband and I both loved it.  It had the perfect amount of spiciness.  My kids enjoyed it too, though I must admit, there was lots of asparagus left on their plates.  Wonderful!  Thanks Jessie.

My husband absolutely loved this recipe.  Too much pasta, next time I will cut back.  I used cayenne pepper to add some zing and it worked.

I was so excited to find a recipe that uses asparagus, since I wanted to bring a green vegetable into our diet besides broccoli! I only used half a box of penne and it still was quite a bit. I used suggestions to from the others and added a litte chicken broth. All in all, the recipe was prety good and I'll probably maek this again, but add a red pepper or tomato for color.

My husband really loved this.  I used cayenne pepper.  Next time, I would only use about 10 ounces of pasta and maybe even more asparagus.  It doesn't eat as well being left over, so make sure you don't make too much.  We will make this recipe year after year!

This was excellent. I also added 2 tablespoons of "Pesto, Basil and Garlic sauce" by Monterey Pasta Co. When it was all cooked, I sprinkled on the parmesan cheese and threw in cubes of avocado and tomato. My husband loved it.

My husband and I loved it!!!  He couldn't stop raving!  My 4 yr. old wouldn't eat the asparagus but the 2 yr old did.  I did take the advice of some other reviewers and decreased the pasta (I used probably 3/4 of the box instead of all) and it was fine.  Also decreased by half the crushed pepper for the kids.  Will definitely make this again!!

Liked the flavor, but it was pretty dry.  Also, the recipe for 4 servings made a ton of food.  So needless to say, we had leftovers.  I made a simple white sauce to mix in when we reheated the leftovers to try to moisten it up a little.  It helped somewhat.  Might try it again using less pasta.

This has become our family favorite. Even the kids love it! We make it without chicken usually, but it is also great with shrimp. Also, I am cajun, so I add 5 or 6 drops of tabasco. Wonderful and quick!
