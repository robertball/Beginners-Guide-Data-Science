Awesome! If you've ever had grilled fruit before you'll love this! For the sauce, I used 2 Tbsp. of honey and 2 Tbsp. of brown sugar along with a bit of vanilla and cinnamon in order to give it more of a "caramel" flavor.  I didn't bother doing it on the stove top - just microwave it for quicker and easier results. Melt the margarine or in my case Land O Lakes Lite butter and add the rest of the ingredients.  I skewered the fruit and placed it on a lightly oiled grate. The strawberries cooked a bit faster than the rest of the fruit but that doesn't matter because the smell coming off the grill is Heavenly!  There's more than enough sauce for basting so it's great to drizzle over the fruit when it comes off the grill (or just about anything else you can think of). This is perfect all by itself, but would be wonderful over pound cake or ice cream if you want to take this over the top.  Great summer treat!

these were really good but I made a few changes and my family loved them.  I added a dash of cinnamon and vanilla extract to it and they came out great.  We used just peaches and strawberries and didn't cook them as long as recommended.

This was very good! I made it as suggested by the member named Jillian! I loved her caramel sauce idea! My fruits of choice were mangos, peaches, bananas and strawberries! I'll have to try this again with other fruit combos...maybe cherries and pineapples next time!

Made for Recipe Group. Peaches and plums aren't even in the store here yet. I added instead some kiwi, mango, and pineapple. The sauce was good, I caramelized another batch for dipping. I did not like the mushiness or heated fruit. Just not to my taste I guess, sorry. Thanks anyway!

I did 8 skewers exactly as recipe calls for. The plum and strawberries softened up too much.  Then I did skewers that had champagne mangos and pineapples with peach, banana and bigger strawberries. All fruit tasted wonderful, not too sweet at all. I save the sauce for redipping afterwards. I enjoyed this and will do it again.

This was the recipe group selection for March 31, 2012.  We eat a lot of fruit and this was a nice change of pace.  I used fresh fruit that was available at the market. The honey sauce adds just a smidgeon of sweetness but does not overpower the fruit and allows the grill flavor to shine through.  I served it with Greek Yogurt for a tasty, healthy lunch.

Recipe Group Selection:  31, March 2012  For starters my first mistake was sending hubby to the store for a peach and a plum.  He came home with a brick hard nectarine and a rotten plum.  He tried, I'll give him credit for that.  I cut away the bad part of the plum and used what was left along with the nectarine, kiwi, pineapple and bananas.  I really only liked the pineapple (everything else was too mushy for my taste) and would have given this 3 stars.  DH on the other hand liked all of it, hence the 4 star rating.

Made this for Recipe Group...My peaches and plums were under-ripe (they are not in season here right now) and this still turned out fantastic! LOVED, LOVED, LOVED how the bananas turned out (could've just did a skewer of bananas and been happy, lol), but looking  forward to trying this w/ other fruits, as well. These were great as is, but they would even be wonderful served w/ ice cream! Will def be making these again! Thanks or sharing. :)

The smokey flavor was freaky. Also, use sweet fruit and very firm kiwi as it is hard to keep on the skewer (also thick slice the kiwi)
