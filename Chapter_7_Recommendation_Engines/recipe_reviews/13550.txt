My family loved this. I made it for Thanksgiving and served it in place of cranberry salad. Everyone raved, EVEN the teenagers.  I will make this again, and it was sooo easy.  The only thing I added, was a little butter on top

very good recipe. I followed it exactly, the only thing I would do differently would be to omit the lemon juice. It doesen't matter to us if the apples turn brown some. Great tasting though. Thanks.

This was yummy! I used whole cranberry sauce in place of the cranberry jelly, and added both coconut and raisins to the mix.  I'll try nuts, too, next time.

I added to nuts to this, but otherwise made it exactly as stated.  It was very good.  I used canned pineapple and a can of cranberry sauce.  Will make again!

This made a great, easy Sunday dessert!  I chopped up three apples, and mixed a can of pineapple with a can of whole berry cranberry sauce.  I also added coconut and almonds to the top, and it was crunchy, sweet, tart, and delicious.  :)

This was really good. I substituted peaches for the cranberry sauce (because it's what I had) and I served it with ice cream.  I was skeptical of the amount of topping vs butter, but it worked out deliciously :-) I will definitely make this again, I can see it being a quick & tasty way to use up all sorts of fresh fruits before they go bad.

I made it as written with the exception of using whole berry cranberry sauce.  A very unique recipe that would add a festive flare to any holiday meal.  I served it as a breakfast side dish but with ice cream added it would make a delicious dessert. Thanks for sharing!
