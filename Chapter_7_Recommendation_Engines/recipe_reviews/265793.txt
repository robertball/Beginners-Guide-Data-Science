Very good flavor! I doubled the recipe since I am freezing some and I used dried herbs.  I will use fresh herbs next time. 

I could not find a good conversion for 1 bunch of fresh herbs to dried. If anyone else used dried herbs, please comment on the amount you used. Since I doubled the recipe, I used 2 Tablespoons of each.
