I love this stuff. The first taste is kind of shocking, especially if you're expecting it to taste like store-bought chocolate pudding. But after a few bites, it really grew on me, and I eat it all the time! I do find that it takes about 1/2 cup of water to make it the right consistency, and it definitely tastes better after it's chilled overnight. The ripeness of the avocados can also make a difference in taste; it tastes too "green" if they aren't fully ripe yet. I also find that the quality of the maple syrup makes a difference, 100% pure maple syrup giving the lightest and most pleasant taste.

I eat a lot of no sugar, non-fat, vegan, vegetarian foods and I don't mind if something tastes a little odd when it's good for you. However, I did not care for it at all! I thought it might just be me so I had my husband and son try it and they thought it was even worse than I did.

I had not expected chocolate and avocado to taste anything like pudding and was pleasantly surprised. It's not exactly what you'd expect and it sure beats some other vegan raw food choices hands down. I choose to leave out the lemon. If I'm hankering for some chocolate and fat I go back to this recipe. Stick with full fat avocados; the low fat ones are not thick enough to make this work. FREEZE THE AVOCADOS first by tossing them in the freezer with the peels on. This makes a super cold chocolate sherbert/icecream.

Definitely an alternative to milk based puddings!  This is better cold than at room temperature, and it has the consistency you expect in a pudding.  The combination of avocado and chocolate leaves something to be desired, but it isn't bad, it just takes getting used to!

I think this isn't for everyone- if you like funky different tastes, it might be for you. If you want jello chocolate pudding this will never taste like that. Also, you should change the recipe to suit you. I made it with dark chocolate cocoa powder instead of regular cocoa powder and 2.5 tbsp of brown sugar instead of maple syrup. I also used no water. Outcome= RICH DELICIOUSNESS. I like my chocolate bitter and rich so it was perfect for me.

Great pudding consistency.  Will make with Greek yogurt and get the protein. Guess if no dairy is your only option it's pudding. Otherwise don't waste the avocados.

SO rich, it's hard to believe this yummy dessert is made with avocado. I made our version low-carb by substituting Splenda and sugar free maple. It tastes perfect and was a snap in the food processor.

This pudding definitely tastes best when chilled overnight.  I added some non-dairy creamer (mimic unsweetened cream) and used agave nectar in addition to the maple syrup (used half the maple syrup).  Added a few teaspoons of water.  Really creamy and satisfying.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for posting!

I thought this was a nice, creamy dessert.  Yes, in the first bite you can taste a difference, but it certainly satisfied my chocolate craving!

This has the consistency of pudding but has a taste I just can't like or even remotely enjoy. I eat avocados in other things but just don't think they make a good chocolate pudding. Using the pudding on strawberries or with other fruit makes it better.

I loved this! My avocados could have been riper. The recipe should say soft or even slightly overripe. Also to my liking, it wasn’t too sweet - if I was making for kids I’d add a bit more maple sugar.

This was so creamy and delicious!  I used only 1/4 cup of cocoa powder and 1/4 cup of maple syrup and it was plenty sweet for us.  Also added a few tablespoons of whole milk. Omitted the salt. Light and tasty!

Excellent alternative to milk-based pudding.  This is really good & avocados have a lot of health benefits, but I worry about the (artery-clogging) saturated fat in it.

I used raw whole milk instead of water, and it took at least 1/2 cup because I was using a blender, but other than that, this recipe is a keeper!  Yummy, sweet, and chocolatey :) It is better chilled.  I'm sure it wouldn't be as good if the avocados aren't very ripe.  It makes enough for the whole family.  Great healthy treat!

This recipe is awesome! The measurements were perfect; I just made a couple substitutions and left out the pinch of salt. Instead of maple syrup I used light agave nectar, and instead of water I used vanilla almond milk (about 1/3 cup). I can't wait to tell everyone about this! I'll definitely make it again and again.

I'm allergic to dairy, corn derivatives, and a few other tradtional "staples"...  This recipe is AMAZING!  Definitely use a food processor, or blender...  Or Magic Bullet...  I tried using my stand mixer and it didn't smoosh in the avacado as nicely as I'd hoped. My own fault :)  But definitely making it again!
