I loved how clean and simple this dish is.  The directions are good, BUT they should say to start the water for the noodles first because they will take the longest (getting the water to boil).  Then everything else will fall into place.  LOVED the pecans.  So glad I made this!

I am freshly out of college, so I am not an expert chef. I am looking for new meal ideas and this one looked really fun. This recipe was a slight challenge for me (I couldn't quite get my timing right). I personally wasn't a huge fan of the dijon sauce, a little extra sweetness would have satisfied my taste buds a little more. 

My variations from the recipe :
   I cooked my salmon for about 2.5 minutes per side, I would recommend this for a fish lover. 
   The grocery store I went to was out of lemons, so I bought oranges, this worked very well on salmon, not sure how I liked it in the dijon sauce. 
   I added too much water to the asparagus which resulted in my overcooking the veggies. It made them very mushy, which worked out well enough I guess. 
   My noodles were a little dry, next time I will add more butter, or maybe an alfredo sauce.

   Overall, this recipe was very fun and satisfying.

AMAZING! I added one clove of garlic to the pasta. Satued it in a bit of butter then added to the pasta and sprinkled with herbs. SO GOOD. I would cut down on the fat a bit by using part olive oil and a bit of butter in the pasta and less butter in the asparagus as well. This dish may even be great with poached salmon rather than fried.

This was simply divine.  The only thing I was missing was the glass of wine.  I was concerned that the pasta was going to be too dry, but it wasn't.  The mustard sauce is fantastic.  Almost like a mock hollandaise sauce with a mustard flavor.  I just wished there was more of it!  I would have loved to have drizzled some over the asparagus.

This receipe was as good as it sounded.  The onlything I would change is to use a less butter.  I didn't have any angel hair pasta, so I used penne. I also didn't have fresh lemons so I used bottled lemon juice. My husband is not a huge fan of fish, but with each mouthful he complimented the meal.  I will definitely use this receipe again, for guests.

I absolutely loved this. Instead of the asparagus I used spinach,1 bag, and instead of Dijon I used honey mustard, I didn't use pecans, and for flavoring the salmon I used salt pepper, a little garlic powder, one  little squirt of lemon juice from bottle per salmon fillet, and parsley,also paprika,  ... I put 1 1/2 tablespoon of butter, and 2 table spoons of vegetable or olive oil, 1 table spoon of minced garlic 4 shakes of garlic salt 3 shakes of ground pepper and  sprinkle 1 table spoon of garlic powder. Mix all, after spinach is soften put 2 tablespoons of Worcester sauce. Mix all and continue the rest of ingredients.

Really yummy.  Somehow I messed up the dijon sauce though.  It separated and got "chunky" when I put it on simmer to keep warm- what gives?  Next time I think I'll try a nice citrus EVOO instead of butter to "healthy" it up a bit.

Truly fantastic and easy to make. The pasta and asparagus cook so quickly that I made them at the end while baking the salmon instead. My boyfriend and I loved it. Will absolutely make again.

i was looking for a salmon and asparagus pasta dish and this fit the bill perfectly. an amazing recipe! i added 2 medium portobello mushrooms cut into large chunks in place of the pecans (my husband doesn't like nuts). it was amazing. i was not expecting to like the sauce (i'm not much of a mustard lover) but it was a perfect complement for the rest of the dish! highly recommended. i will be making this again!

Really good and lemony. Served salmon on a bed of spinach with the pasta on the side. Sauce was plenty for two of us.

Absolutely incredible! Works with any fish (I only had flounder on hand, and it was still great!). I tasted the mustard sauce in the pan and though it might be too much, but it was really well balanced.

Will definitely be making again! Great dish for company!

I made this dish for a five-person dinner party last weekend. We had to roughly sextuple the recipe  (13 fillets, 2 bunches of asparagus, and a pound of spaghetti), but there were NO LEFTOVERS aside from a small bit of pasta. The only change we made was to cook the asparagus for 10 minutes in the butter-pecan mix, and that's just a soft texture preference. All of the flavors come together perfectly! Thank you for a new twist on an old favorite!

I made this and added enough for one extra person. I had whole wheat thin spaghetti on hand and used that instead of angel hair pasta. We all love pecans so I added extra. We all loved it.

I made this as written, except for substituting broccoli for the asparagus since it was what I had. Delicious even with the substitution and I wouldn't change anything.

Very good recipe!!  I halved most of the recipe, save the sauce so that we'd have more to help flavor the pasta.  We really liked it!!!  Next time, I'm going to cut back on the butter all around in order to shave some calories.  Also, I like to use as much as possible of my ingredients, so I went ahead and added the pulp from my lemon and some lemon zest.  Think those were positive additions.  Highly recommended!  Enjoy!!

We all liked this.  I baked the salmon, and ended up having to drain the asparagus because the water did not evaporate well enough, but otherwise was good.  I did use less butter overall, and added to the sauce a splash of white wine, a splash of milk, and some parmesan cheese

Yummy. Because I don't follow directions well and dove right in, I didn't measure anything. So when taste testing the sauce it was a bit too tangy, to fix my own mistake I improvised and added a splash of white wine, a splash of milk and parmesan cheese, oh my!!!  Excellent recipe and my picky eaters approved! Thank you

I made it in the oven on 425 for 15 min with the butter mustard sauce added already. With the pasta, we did it with fresh parsley and dry basil and a little less butter than what it called for. We sauteed the asparagus with mushrooms in olive oil, garlic, and white wine. Finally, put it all together and it was delicious!

Tasted so so good, but just a little too much butter for my taste. The only thing I would change next time I make it is just reducing the butter in the pasta.

This dish was delicious! I marinated the salmon with salt, pepper, lemon, and truffle oil beforehand. The sauce came out a little thick but it still tasted good. I love this dish! Tasted amazing...

I made the Salmon and Dijon Butter Sauce, and it was very good.  I added garlic, onion powder, black pepper, dill, basil, and parsley to the sauce as it simmered.  I served it with mashed potatoes, collard greens and okra.  This is a quick, simple and delicious meal that I will make again.

Make sure you have plenty of butter on hand for this recipe! I was a little confused on which item got which amount of butter but the meal itself turned out great!! Good lemon flavor and the pecans went well with the whole grain angel hair. The dijon butter sauce had good flavor but I must admit that mine didnt hold together very well. Not sure why it kept separating. :(

I made this recipe last night. I didn't use pecans and i used dry spices instead of fresh ones. I used a garlic and herb butter by Land O Lakes to season pasta. I didn't care for the dijon sauce. Luckily,  I had a lemon butter dill sauce for seafood in the pantry. Tasted great!
