Nothing special.  One hour of cook time was enough to cook the lamb, but the carrots and potatoes were still hard.  I used the juice to make gravy, but still not great.  Won't make it again.

I think I did something wrong. I "thought" I followed the directions exactly, but I ended up with so many veggies that it didn't fit in the casserole dish (the size stated in the recipe). Once I got everything as closely put together as possible to what the recipe called for and cooking it (for longer than stated) I tasted fine. I might make it again, but I'd definitely make some changes to the recipe.

I have made this twice now, both times my ladyfriend and I have been very happy with it. 
Since some people thought it bland, I didn't measure out, but rather just went heavy with garlic pepper, garlic salt, and parsley. I found the flavor to be great. I sliced and precooked the veggies for about 50 minutes covered, with the suggested water in the pan, and near the end of that time, browned the lamb shoulder chops in olive oil with some rosemary. I lifted up the veggies with a spatula and slid the chops underneath to cover the bottom of the pan, covered by the veggies. Added a bit more water, and cooked for 30 min covered and 30 min uncovered.
This is my introduction to cooking with lamb, and we both love it. This recipe also works very well with thin-sliced bone-in pork shoulders, should that be more to your liking.

This was absolutely delish! I precooked the veggies before baking it.  t was easy, simple & very tasteful. Even my fussy 16yo & 3yo ate it to hearts content. Will definitely be putting it in my recipe-box. Thank you

The technique was exactly what I was looking for, but browned the chops with 2 sprigs of rosemary in garlic olive oil, then layered and baked them as directed using only one onion. I did have to cook an extra hour. This was a really good recipe, thank you!

My family enjoyed this. It was a hearty meal on a cold winter day and was very easy to make.  Didnt use that many onions, and baked it probably an extra 40 minutes to get the veggies done..but the lamb was very tender.

What an easy and beautiful dish.  Needed to cook it a bit longer than it said.

This is definately the blandest recipe I have ever tried, my boyfriend and myself ate almost none of it. I definately won't be making it again, and don't suggest that anyone else does.
