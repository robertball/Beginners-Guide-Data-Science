The first time i made i did exactly what the recipe said. The next time i used Rosemary (which i prefer) instead of thyme. Tonight I toned down the salt and used some garlic salt instead, Ohh it was soooo good. I defiantly recommend these

Great potato, I do them sliced half inch thick, no oil.
they cook quicker, and no oven needed.
I start them off in butter medium heat careful 
not to burn the butter, once browned on the bottom
I flip them over and ad chicken stock, very slowly, 
or it can flare up, finish cooking till the other side is browned.
quick, easy , yum


I been cooking these for 3 years now.

Had to substitute basil for thyme in this outstanding recipe. The contrasting textures had my friends "Mmmmmmm"-ing throughout dinner.  This is a new staple in my dinner party recipe box.

Ha Cha Cha! These are great! The best potatoes I have made. Creamy with the flavor of the stock, amazing. I did not have russet potatoes so I used red potatoes making sure of the size for correct baking. I used olive oil and 1Tsp. dried thyme. Great flavor, I would love to try them with rosemary too. Can't wait to make them again!

I must say, try to watch the video before making these.  It makes the instructions so much easier.  I read some reviews before attempting to make these.  I combined spice suggestions and used thyme, rosemary & tarragon (I only had dried spices available, but am sure that using fresh would throw this over the top).  The texture of the potatoes was crispy, creamy & yummy.  I didn't think these were too time consuming, considering the professional result.  Served as a side dish to BBQ NY Strip (also on this site).  Can't wait to make these again with fresh herbs!!  Thanks Chef, for an awesome recipe.

I didn't have thyme, fresh or not, so I used rosemary.  They were divine.  I piped sour cream on top and then crumbled bacon over them with a sprinkle of parsley and my husband and I both ate 4 pieces...  I would serve these during a special occasion or holiday anytime.  I think they were the best, new potato dish I've had in a very long time.  Joined all recipes just to say that.  Yum  ...  I should probably add I browned the potatoes in the fat rendered from the bacon...  Oh, my, they were good.

I love all of Chef John's recipes, and fondant potatoes is no exception! While a bit decadent in terms of fat content, these potatoes make a unique and luxurious side dish for a special meal.  I served them alongside grilled king salmon for Christmas dinner, and it was a surprisingly great combination.

I followed the recipe to the letter, and the one thing I will say is that mine needed closer to an hour in the oven (and I used about a cup of chicken stock total) for the insides to be cooked through and nice and creamy. I ended up having to stick them back in after removing them at 40 minutes, when my daughter tasted one and commented that it wasn't done yet.  So be careful to make sure they are cooked through before serving them.  I will say that the presentation on the platter with the flourish of thyme sprigs was quite striking!  Great recipe, and fun to try to something new.

I fear it may have been user-error, but when I made these they turned out good, but certainly not great considering the amount of work and clean-up.  I went back over the instructions and believe that I did all that was required, so I'm not sure where I went wrong.

These were good. Will make them again,  fancy looking and tasty, I added some garlic and transfer them to a baking dish as i did not have a cast iron skillet. All and all good and will make them again.

Oh my I tried these potatoes last week for a dinner with family and they were fabulous!I did not have either fresh rosemary or thyme so I used chives from the garden and used some thyme in the jar for seasoning. They were so good and the presentation was wonderful. Future staple at dinner parties for me--thank you!

Please try this!  It's worth the tiny extra bit of preparation and you end up with a 5-star presentation and a wonderfully flavorful side dish.  I didn't have fresh thyme so I used fresh rosemary and it was stellar.  We'll definitely be doing this one again.  A plus:  the parts you trim off of the potatoes can be used for hash browns the following morning.  What a great recipe. Thanks, Chef John, for a new and yummy way to cook the plebian potato!

This is one of the best potato recipes I have ever used & leaves room for a lot of experimental flavors. Always nice to have people walk away wondering how many years u went to culinary school. Very elegant & impressive. As always my hats off to you chef John. thanks for all the wonderful recipes & ideas.

These are very good but I think one must be wary not to cut the potatoes too large.  I think smaller, shorter potatoes do better with this recipe.

These are so fancy and so good I like garlic and bacon bits in the butter for cooking them in then pouring over them when done baking. Awesome.

These are now a staple in our house. We follow the recipe exactly, not a single change needs to be made. Of course times may vary ever so slightly but the ingredients and directions are perfect. Watch the video before you make the first time, it is really helpful.

These were unique as well as great.  The potatoes I had on hand were not the largest and therefore made for smaller than 2" cylinder a so I  just adjusted my cooking time down a little and tested at 25 minutes and they were perfect. An iron skillet is indeed the best way to cook these.  One more thing, they do retain their heat well.

Made it as directed as a test for a future dinner. Totally delish! Since I was testing it out I had nothing to go with it, but I was hungry and wanted more than just potatoes. So I took out the potatoes, left the sauce in the pan and threw in some fresh spinach to wilt. It was not only the best potatoes ever, but also the absolute best spinach ever. Make this.

Delicious! The only addition I made was to add chopped garlic with the fresh thyme. I followed the recipe exactly as written other than that and the were amazing. My picky kids gave them the thumbs up which is quite an accomplishment.

I admit, I was just sort of expecting regular roasted potatoes, and I'm happy to say that I was wrong! The texture contrast with these is unbelievable, and the flavor is out of this world. Thanks for another hit, Chef John!

I chose these for a dinner I was making for a dear friend.  I wanted to impress!  These potatoes do require some babysitting, but they were delicious, beautiful, and special.  I was very glad I made them.

I think I have made at least a ton of roasted potatoes in my life. These were good but not any better texturally than the other much simpler preparations I've made. On the other hand- the browned butter with fresh thyme and chicken stock sauce was exquisite.

These look great, if you want a minimalist plate! I will use more salt and a bit more butter next time. I will also sprinkle extra chopped thyme over them. They really need a gravy or demi glace served with them, but I ran out of time.

Loved them - even though I forgot to drizzle the butter over at the end.  Amazing way to prepare potatoes (and much easier than I originally thought!).  My husband LOVED them!

I saw the video and was intrigued - mine were not as pretty as Chef John's, but they were crispy on the outside and crumbly/creamy on the inside. Yummy! I used chives (no thyme) and since it is more delicate, it almost burned in the oven, so I took it out about halfway thru. I will probably not make these often, as they are a little time consuming and there is more butter/oil than I like for an everyday recipe, but may attempt again for company.

These potatoes were easy to make and were very creamy.  They stay hot long after coming out of the oven, which allows time for the rest of the meal to finish.  I would definitely make these again.

They turned out so rich, creamy and flavorful! Easier than I thought, too.  The start up prep is worth it and I made sure my potatoes were completely dry before placing them in the hot oil to reduce splatter.

We both loved these potatoes, great flavour and texture. While they do take about an hour I didn't find this recipe labour intensive. I did make a few changes due to dietary restrictions and what I had on hand. I used avocado oil and Earth Balance® instead of butter. I didn't have any fresh thyme so I subbed 1/2 tsp of dried. Instead of brushing the potatoes with the thyme sprigs I spooned the liquid over the potatoes. I did have to add additional chicken broth but my potatoes were huge. I know that I will be making these often as hubs has already requested that I make them again. Another winning recipe by Chef John.

Delicious but more work than I'm willing to put forth. So if anyone wants to come over and make them for me it's totally a 5 star.

So pretty!  ....and they taste good too!  They smoked up my house and I don't normally have a problem with that.  I have an oven in my garage.  It's my (not so convenient) double oven. Next time I make them, and I will again, I will do it outside.  Mine required an extra 10 minutes to finish.

Made as written but I made the mistake of basting the potatoes so they didn't come out crispy. Darn it!  That being said these were good and guests liked them. They were a lot of work.

Potatoes tasted really creamy on the inside, but alas, mine did not crisp up on the outside, I will try this again though, also I added carrot to the roasting pan, and they tasted really good too.

these came out perfect, just like the chef john prime rib roast.  will make again and again.  just a side note: peel potatoes and then slice them.  i now have some unpeeled 'stumps' in the freezer because i didn't want to throw them away.

Made it tonight. It's a "please do this again mom, soon"!  Used rosemary instead of thyme and it was a hit with the family.  They are asking me to make it every time instead of baked potatoes.  Mahalo for the recipe!

looks intimidating but is fairly simple when you follow the steps. will be making this instead of baked potatoes in the future, and will tinker with the seasonings in the stock to see how it colors the flavor (i love tarragon, so that might be my first mod to the recipe).

I just made these, and they were literally the best potatoes I've ever made. I had to make a lot of substitutions, though, due to a lack of the required materials. 

To start, I only had small russet potatoes, so after cutting and peeling the halves ended up about 1½-2 inches wide and an inch tall. I preheated the oven to 400 instead of 425 to make up for this. For the oil, I used about ½ canola oil and ½ duck fat. 

I lightly salted and peppered them, and added a dash of Accent to each. After flipping and seasoning them again, I blotted up the oil and added butter per the recipe.

 After that, things got more weird. I didn't have thyme, fresh or otherwise, but I did have dry Italian seasoning which contains thyme, so I added a few shakes of that to the butter.

Since I didn't have chicken stock but I did have some Massel chicken-style vegetarian bouillon cubes, before I started I had added two of those and a few dashes of Knorr tomato bouillon to about a cup of piping hot water and let that dissolve, and I added the resulting liquid to the pan instead of chicken stock.

I still roasted them for 30 minutes, and despite all the substitutions, the potatoes were incredible—immensely flavorful with a nice crisp crust, and so tender inside that I didn't even need a knife to cut through them. I'm definitely making these again.

Have made these twice now  and can honestly say that  Fondants are my favorite way to have potatoes! 
So many ways to tweak and adjust  these to suit whatever you're serving them with. Very impressive as a special side for dinner with friends and family. 
Almost as though someone found a way to make mashed potatoes that can hold a shape. 
The cutoffs can be diced and frozen ( skin on ) to use for country style hash browns later!  ( I felt bad about the waste.)

While the taste was very good, the best part was the addition of something unique looking to the dinner table. I made them just as instructed, and I will make them again when I want to impress my guests.

I don't think that I've ever made a baked potato that tasted so good. They were so tender and soft, and flavourful. I made a couple minor changes. I used about 5 tbs of butter,  1 cup of a rich, thick, flavourful vegetable stock. I also put about 6 (although next time I would use more) cloves of whole garlic in the the potatoes and stalk while they baked. The garlic cloves were like little Perls full of flavour. Also, I was quite heavy handed(in a good way) with the salt, which paid off. I will definitely be making these again.

I didn’t have a high temp oil so the tops got a bit over done but these were so tasty!  They melt in your mouth. I think I will also try rosemary for the herb next time. I am also going to try to use a biscuit cutter to see if that would speed up the formation of the “fondant” and make them more uniform.

Just added garlic to the dance floor.
Mine took about 40 min as I used different potato type.
This thing is heavenly!

I made these according to the recipe; as a side for chicken piccata.  I made it in my favorite cast iron skillet; (flea markets are a great place to find skillets!)  Fantastic! Two comments: 1.) Do paint your potato tops with the thyme sprigs and butter, as recommended, and 2.) Scooch things around in the pan if you have hot spots. I did have one potato that was not as cooked as the others. Beyond that, pretty easy worry free recipe that just looks great on the plate!

These were a big hit.  I made them to accompany a steak dinner...I was looking for something different and I got it!  They looked beautiful and tasted great and no one at my dinner had tried them before.

My only change was that I had to sear my potatoes for 10-15 minutes on the first side (as opposed to 5 minutes on the recipe). This may have just been my stove or pan though.  

The only thing I didn't love was that the potatoes are fairly large so even if you season the outside well, the inside is in need of S&P.  

I am looking forward to trying some variations of this recipe...maybe making them in a smaller size (that will  help the salt issue) or maybe figuring out a way to stuff them prior to baking...  But, the original recipe was really delicious and fun to make!

These are amazing, I love this recipe. They have a really interesting texture and they're absolutely delicious. Only make them if you're prepared to do some work, there are a couple steps and they're more involved than mashed potatoes. The first time I made the mistake of not leaving them in the oven long enough and not putting in enough broth. I highly suggest actually testing the potatoes and checking that your utensil goes through the middle of the potato cleanly and easily. Cooking time really depends on the size of the potato.

These were so good and my dinner guests were so impressed. The only thing I'll do differently next time (and there will be a next time!) Is to use a brush for choosing the potatoes with the thyme butter. I don't feel  the sides absorbed enough butter and didn't quite crisp up like the end did. The potatoes still came out of the oven creamy and delicious I think it's just a matter of practicing till I get it perfect! I loved having the video to watch as added help to make sure I did everything right.

In all honesty, these potatoes take more work than I want to put into them. However, they are frigging delicious. The outside is so crisp and the inside of the potato has such a  creamy + dreamy texture. I didn't know potatoes could be so creamy without butter and cream. These potatoes are amazing. HIGHLY recommended.

First time I'd ever made fondant potatoes and they were delicious. I probably should have allowed them to crisp for longer on the top, but after hearing how hard these were to get right I was pleasantly surprised! 

Thank you so much! :)

Wonderful texture and surprisingly strong flavor. The only thing I changed was using rosemary instead of thyme since I didn't have any. The first part was really difficult, but since it was my first time and I'm not a super awesome cook or anything, I'm determined to try again. There was A LOT of smoke, and I was sure I had burnt them beyond edibility, but they turned out really yummy, with a little smoke flavor in the mix! My husband said he would rate this recipe a million out of a thousand.

Update: I made this again and it was easier. It helped to have everything set out and ready, and I turned the heat off when I wiped up the oil and put in the butter so it didn't smoke.

These were amazing. I followed the recipe ALMOST exactly... I actually peeled my potatoes instead of slicing down the sides. I had no thyme, so I used rosemary... the rest as per recipe. 

A bbq brisket on the grill, these in the oven, mushrooms and green beans in the steamer. A PERFECT meal!

Love! Love! Love it! I made these potatoes two days ago, and now as we speak am baking them. My husband said that from now on he will only eat potatoes fondant. The recipe is perfect as is, just be careful not too over salt them. I also pealed mine, felt like chopping the skin took off too much of the potato itself.

Am I the only 3 star rating?  I thought they were very good, but not so wonderful to be worth the trouble. Im wondering if you could get the same flavor with cutting thick scollops and using a 13x9 dish in the oven?

I made these with Country Style Steak from AR. Not all of my potatoes cooked thoroughly, obviously my fault, but the ones that were done were very good. A new way to make potatoes that I will try more and more. Thanks, Chef John! You are one of my favorites.

Solid recipe. The texture is very agreeable, but it's quite fiddly to get there, and uses an uncomfortable amount of butter/ oil/ things. I reckon the number of stars it gets would entirely matter on how wonderful the chicken stock was to begin with.

I made these on a rainy day when I was a little bored because they sounded tasty and time consuming, and they were definately both!  We enjoyed them, but too fussy for everyday rotation.  Impressive looking!

These turned out just great.  I made then for a Christmas potluck dinner and I had to make them the day before as I did not have enough oven time as a guest.  Out of the oven was much better than reheated but they were impressive just the same.

Very good and not too time consuming. I also used rosemary because we prefer it to thyme. I agree that the video is helpful for a technique with which I was unfamiliar. Will definitely do these again.

It seemed like a lomg time to make for just a "baked potato". I think my could have cooked a little longer yet it was over browned. Hubby thought too much work. I was tasty, love the presentation. Will give it a 2nd chance

I was making a large batch and didn't have a cast iron pan large enough, so I browned the potatoes as instructed and then transferred them to a half sheet pan to braze them in the chicken stock.

Super easy which I loved. I followed the recipe exactly and found it lacking in flavor. I will try again but maybe Enhance the recipe by adding garlic or more thyme  or something like that. FYI this recipe can be made ahead and the final step of baking it in the oven can be postponed by several hours.  Final comment  The cooking time needs to be adjusted to a longer duration may be 45 minutes

If you are looking for a delicious potato recipe that looks impressive, give this a whirl.  We loved it.   I made the recipe exactly as stated.  You'll enjoy the crisp outside and the creamy center.

I followed the recipe, and they turned out great. I certainly will make them again, but not too often because of the amount of carbs and fat (which, of course, is what makes them so good). I may experiment with what herbs I use, but I won't mess too much with success.

These were good but they are a lot of work for a potato.  Be careful with the hot oil.

Let me say first, I love this recipe as is. I made it a lot. When I changed my diet, I changed the recipe a little. No butter (mix of olive oil and avocado oil with a little more salt then) and bone broth. Still amazing. The other day I turned the 2 in “scallops” into 1/2 in “toast” and added a bruschetta mix on top. For anyone kicking bread this is so amazing. Just mind that liquid only comes half way up the potatoes when you add to oven and watch it after 10 min. Love this recipe Chef! Your amazing

I didn't have any fresh herbs, so I left them out. I also used homemade chicken broth. My husband loved them and asked for them again today. That  doesn't happen very often so it's high praise indeed!

The family enjoyed this method of potato.  I was uncomfortable with the waste of good potato that was cut off to form the correct size.  This could  be a very special meal potato but not a regular go to recipe.

I will make these again but use much smaller potatoes so that there is more surface area on the skillet. Also eat these hot.

My wife invited a gaggle of high school biddies (buddies?) over for a combined 60th birthday celebration and tossed dinner planning & execution to me.  My personal challenge then became timing the various dishes so that pan seared tenderloin, steamed asparagus, sautéed portabella mushrooms and potatoes all were ready for plating at the same time.  As my children can attest timing is not my best attribute.

I ended up with enough potatoes for the meal even though no two in the 8 pound bag were similar in size.  Thankfully size does NOT matter.  The shapes were similar enough to Chef John’s that several of the ladies thought the meal was surf & turf and skipped the beef to concentrate on the scallops.  I was able to persuade them to go back for the tenderloin despite their disappointment with the scallops.  Don’t you love ladies forgetting their reading glasses?

I try to follow Chef John’s recipes to the limit of my acumen even though that is becoming hit & miss.  The potatoes were perfect and much appreciated by all the ladies.  The entire meal was plated precisely on schedule.  Thank you Chef John!

We loved these - little bit of work, lot of smoke despite the grape seed oil, but my husband and I both loved them. Served with beef tenderloin, asparagus cooked in butter, oil and a little bacon, and chef John’s Brussel sprouts cooked in butter, olive oil and lemon juice, for a really nice meal.

These are very easy to make and they are delicious. A very welcome, new and creative way to make potatoes at home. Don't skip the bowl of water to de-starch the potatoes, and don't forget to add broth before putting them in the oven... I made both those mistakes the second time I made these because I was doing it from memory (shouldn't have attempted). Luckily I remembered to add broth about five minutes after putting them in the oven. They still came out pretty good, but they are awesome if you follow the directions properly.

These were really good, although I substituted the thyme for rosemary, and salt with garlic salt. It tastes even better with cheese and extra chicken stock! My family loves them! Although the steps are a bit tedious and for a lazy person, like myself,  the steps are a little too much, but it's still good! The second batch I made has bacon, onions, and cheese.

I've made this twice now. Preparing potatoes this way makes me feel so Continental! Even though I'm a Texan.

Pairs well with a fine New York steak from Trader Joe's, serve with a generous portion of  his Veggies and Greens salad kit and a bottle of his Charles Shaw Merlot for a well around the world meal. Wear you cowboy boots, but remove your hat 'fore you sit down.

I just made these for dinner with a top round roast, bearnaise sauce, and broccoli. WOW. Really easy directions on this recipe. I've only heard of fondant potatoes on MasterChef so I am really happy with how they turned out. Thank you!

I followed this recipe almost verbatim and it was excellent.  Crispy on the outside as Chef John showed. and the inside was fluffy and perfect. I didn't have fresh or dried thyme and we were in the midst of a snow storm so I used dried sage and parsley. I also used beef broth for the chicken broth. Such a treat.  Not too much prep or clean-up for this fabulous potato treat.

Outstanding!  I tested this recipe for a Thanksgiving menu, and it’s a keeper. My only dilemma is how I’ll make it for 12.  Putting an add in the paper for a Sous Chef.

I made these and followed the recipe carefully. They were pretty good but the extra work is not justified by the outcome. Next time I'll just bake the potatoes.

This turned out pretty well. Followed the directions. My only issue is that my pan was too hot.  My   butter and the herbs got too dark. I'll have to make adjustments with my stove. I will probably make again.

because of the chicken broth I reducuced the salt and they were beautiful but bland. this recipe does not make me like russet potatoes any more than I ever have...will try with reds. russet potatoes are dry and mealy. anything less than a cup of broth will evaporate before the potatoes are done. recipe needs tweaking for us but worth the effort.

this is a great way to add more excitement to a regular baked potato.I added a little twist to it.
I used an apple corer,and stuffed it with cheddar cheese.you have to cap the ends so as it doesn't ooze into the bottom of the pan.

I would give this a 5 rating except that mine took twice as long to cook and were still not as soft as I would have liked.  The problem seemed to be that the potatoes were too large so even cut in half was not enough.  I will make again but will either use smaller russets or cut in thirds.  Otherwise--yummy and nice presentation for a dinner party!

I think if I use spices of our liking, it will turn out really good.  I added the chicken broth but couldn't taste it so next time I'll just add water.  Why waste the broth?  Seasoned water is what I'll use.  Possibly a spoonful of onion soup mix would work well with this.

Easy recipe, and tastes great. Roasted potatoes with a beautifully delicious crispy outside. Rather than mop up the oil with a paper towel, I just removed them from the pan briefly and drained the oil. Otherwise to the letter and loved how they tried out. Will definitely make again.

Definitely will make it again! Served them with St. Louis style ribs and steamed veggies. I think next time I will use herbed butter instead of brushing with the thyme simply because I love fresh herbed  butter in my cooking. Great recipe!

These potatoes are just as described, and really tasty. I didn't get quite the crisp on the outside but that may have been because I covered them for 15 minutes while everything else was finishing.

Potatoes in butter, seared and baked with salt, pepper and thyme. Very nice, but nothing better than a regular baked potato done properly, and with a baked potato you get the skin!

I think that this recipe is more about presentation than making the potatoes in a way that creates a new food.  For the most part, these come out as ... potatoes.

These potatoes are melt in your mouth good.  So creamy, so savory.  I am thinking about using thmye and rosemary and maybe even sage or basil next time I make them.  And I WILL make these again.  BTW:  DO NOT FORGET to soak them in water before putting in the pan! Mine splashed and popped grease all over my kitchen.

This was really good.  I didn't have fresh thyme and used dry, but not enough.  It took longer to bake than I thought.  After 35 minutes, cut the potatoes into quarters.  Next time I will take the suggestion that someone made about cutting them into smaller discs and cooking them in the pan.

I made these according to the recipe; I used homemade chicken stock and not storebought.

1. Using high heat on the stovetop the potatoes were scorched black within a minute. I suggest trying medium-high heat, turning down to medium to medium-low heat before adding butter.

2. At 30 minutes in oven potatoes were half-raw, at 40 still hard in the middle. To get potatoes cooked I had to bake them 55 minutes.

3. Thyme-butter-stock 'sauce' was curdled but extremely tasty. 

I probably will make these again, but next time will use a little more stock and let them bake for an hour total. It could be that December potatoes are simply drier than autumn ones, having been stored, and may need a longer cooking time.

I made twice, first time followed the directions but for a smaller serving, turned out okay.  Second time I watched the video and decided to leave the liquids as suggested for 6 servings instead of two, added garlic salt and the flavor was better but still not worth all of the steps.

These are awesome potatoes! Fluffy and flavorful texture inside and that golden crispy outside. Perfect! And easy. Update 11/1/2016 I have made these several times since my first try and they are still perfect! They also make a nice presentation. And they go great with Lamb Chops, the seasonings in the potatoes enhance and compliment the flavor of the Lamb. Try them, you'll love them.

I was inspired during the browning process to also sear mine on the side. I think this gives it better texture and taste.

I made this according to the recipe. Very simple with fabulous results. I'm making a larger amount next time because they disappeared off the plate so fast. Delicious!

This dish was delicious.  The only reason it gets only 3 stars from me is because it's hard to improve the potato....enough salt/butter and they are delicious regardless of how you make them.  If you are looking for an elevated presentation, then this is 5 stars.

This was good.  It looked like it should, crispy bottoms, creamy insides.  It's just not something that I would make again.
It was fun making it though!
Someone mentioned cutting the slices 1/2 inch thick and using this method (with adjusted cooking times of course) and that may be something worth trying.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I prepared the potatoes like Chef John did in the video.  Went out and bought more potatoes to make it the next day.

I made a similar recipe for these a long time ago, the oly difference was the peeled potato was cut in half lengthwise.  I am glad to see this recipe here, I will definately make it again, they were delicious!
