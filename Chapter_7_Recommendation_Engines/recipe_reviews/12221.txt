This was so easy and tasted fabulous!  The only thing I did differently was use up 4 slices of swiss cheese(two on the bottom layer and two in the egg mixture)and used sandwich ham meat, cut up which I combined with the egg mixture as well.  The pie crust didn't really cook thoroughly, I'm not sure if it's because I didn't cook it long enough (45 mins), but it turned soggy, so we just ate the filling.  I think next time, we'll prebake the pie crust and then fill it.  Another thing I'd do differently is instead of layer the swiss on the bottom, I'll just combine it all with the eggs and then use about 1/4 cup of the egg on the bottom layer and then add ham to the egg mixture and top it off with that.  Other than that, it's perfect.

This was the easiest and most tasteful quiche I have made to date. The only difference was that I doubled the recipe to make 2 so that I could freeze one for later (bake for 30 minutes, remove, cool, wrap, and freeze. Bake frozen at 350 for 35 mins to serve.) and I added 1/4 cup of sour cream to the egg custard mixture. I always add sour cream to my beaten eggs!

With a few minor improvisions, this quiche turned out great. I had alot of Honeybaked ham left over from Easter; the glaze on the ham gave the quiche even more flavor. I also used evaporated milk instead of half & half and doubled the swiss cheese. For another tasty variety, substitute 1 broccoli crown for the spinach and omit the mushrooms. MMMMMM... I made two of these, and it is even better the second day!  The pies were a little soft the first day, but they firmed up nicely overnight. This is the first quiche I've ever made, and this recipe is definately a keeper!

Terrific! Ve-e-ery rich! I used frozen chopped spinach (drain very well) and fresh mushrooms, and chopped up thinly sliced deli ham instead of canned.  Also added green onions which gave it a little extra color.  Wonderful!!

I used this recipe for a baby shower and it came out great!  Everyone was asking for the recipe. It's so quick and easy too, especially if you buy Swiss cheese and Cheddar cheese that is already sliced and shredded.  A cute idea for gatherings is to make miniature pies for everyone. One 9" pie recipe is equivilant to about 12 miniature pies.  I baked 24 miniature pies for 45 minutes and they came out perfect.  This recipe is a real winner, and I know I'll keep making it for years to come!

This was a great quiche and a great way to get rid of leftover ham.  I used light cream instead of half and half, baby spinach and fresh sauteed mushrooms.  Delicious!

Very light and fluffy. I used egg beaters, fat free half nad half and canadian bacon, because that is what I had on hand. Will definitally make again! Placing sliced cheese on bottom of crust is pure genius - will do with all my quiches.

This quiche was so good!  I used a ready made crust, stuck in all the ingredients, baked and voila!  Doesn't get easier than that!

This was an amazing recipe! I used leftover Christmas HAM too.  

I just read the reviews, took a few suggestions then did what other reviewers did and tweaked it a little taking some of their suggestions:  

I used packaged frozen pie crust--prebaked 10 min; sauted the mushrooms in butter, used frozen spinach so I steamed it in the microwave and then squeezed out the excess water.  I didn't have swiss so I lined the bottom of the crust with an "italian shredded cheese" blend, then sprinkled about 1/2 cup on top of quiche before baking. I also added 1/2 tsp. tarragon and 1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. freshly grated black pepper.  WONDERFUL!!!! I served this for my family.  My husband doesn't even like spinach and he loved this!

Mmmmm-mmm!!   This was a great supper!  I used 2 containers of egg beaters (= 4 eggs) instead of real eggs, 2 sliced green onions, garlic powder, and a whole cup of chopped baby spinach leaves, along with all the other ingredients (smoked ham, not canned)....baked in a deep dish crust.  This is a keeper!!  Thanks!!

Yum.  The filling was made almost to the letter except for the following.  I added 1/4 cup of chopped red onion.  I did not have the whole amount of the half and half, so I topped up with evaporated milk.  I had two eggs so I added egg white.  Instead of the crust (higher in fat), I sprayed the pie plate with PAM, and pressed in 1 1/2 cups of shredded potatoes onto the bottom of the pie plate.  Sprayed the potatoes with more PAM and baked for 15 minutes before filling.  Delicious.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this quiche for brunch yesterday and it turned out very well, but I did change things a bit.  Here's what I did:  I sauteed a medium sized onion with the mushrooms in some butter until soft.  Then I added about a half a package of frozen chopped spinach.  I pre-baked by pie shell for about 10 minutes before adding the other ingredients.  Then I added the mushroom/onion/spinach mixture, topped it with the ham and about 1.5 cups of cheese and then the egg mixture.  I used 5 eggs and about 1.5 cups of 1% milk in place of the cream.  The end result was very tasty and one that I will make again for sure.

I think the spinach makes the crust soggy because as it cooks it loses water, like mushrooms.  Hmmm, maybe it was the mushrooms.  Anyhow, I would used frozen spinach next time and drain it really well and saute some mushrooms so the liquid is not going to make the crust soggy.

Great recipe. Used prepared pie crust, cooked for 400 for 10 min. before filling and then cooked according to recipe. Used 4 slices of swiss cheese and am really glad I did, next time I might use even more. Instead of mushrooms and spinach I used green chilies and onions. I also added an extra egg. Turned out great!

Excellent and easy quiche!  I served this for a brunch last week and have made three more since then.  We can't get enough of it.  I used fresh mushrooms sauteed in a little butter and deli ham coarsley chopped instead of canned and also used frozen chopped spinach.  If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars I would.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I've made this a million times over the last couple of years.  It was 5 stars when I followed the recipe exactly (I only rate on the exact recipe as submitted!!!)... It is now 6 stars since I've made minor modifications over time to my taste.  I have learned that I like it even better when I saute chopped deli ham (or bacon), diced onions and mushrooms in butter to get that browned taste before sprinkling it all over the top of the egg mixture.  I also add a few dashes of garlic powder and dry mustard powder to the egg mixture.  Tip:  if you use frozen spinach, be sure to thaw and squeeze/drain all excess water out.  I always double this for leftovers.  Thank you!

Made this with leftover Thanksgiving ham and it was delicious!  I discovered as I was putting it together that I didn't have any swiss cheese (sliced or otherwise and I almost always have it!), but I did have a shredded Mexican 4 cheese and used it as a substitute.  Worked great!  It was a huge hit for hubby and 7yr old son!!  One slice for leftovers and hubby took it for lunch the next day!

I'm a first-time quiche-maker, and I'm thrilled that this was the recipe I tried. Great, easy recipe. The best part about it is that it's forgiving. For instance, I didn't have Swiss cheese, so I used pepper jack in place of it. The recipe still set up just perfectly and made for a tasty dinner. I suspect that as long as the egg-cream-flour-salt to Other Ingredients proportion is kept in place, the end product would come out fine.

Like other folks who made this recipe, I did not use the canned mushrooms (IMHO, canned mushroom are just icky). Instead, I used a bit more spinach because that's what I like and that's what I had on hand. For the crust I used Pillsbury refrigerated pie crusts. I didn't bake them at all before putting in the filling, and the quiche came out fine.

I am looking forward to my brown bag lunch tomorrow because I'll get to eat this quiche!

This was incredible!!  It was my first quiche, and I must say, I was very impressed.  I used fat-free half-and-half, and it worked just fine.  I used fresh mushrooms and sliced deli ham, and would definitely do that again!  Also add a pinch of black pepper.  Thanks so much for the recipe!!

This was excellent! I used fresh sliced mushrooms sauteed in butter, frozen spinach (thawed and well-drained), and I added about 1/4 cup of scallions.  Instead of canned ham (yuk!), I simply got one 1-inch thick piece of Sara Lee honey ham from the deli.  That was plenty, after it was cubed.  Oh, and if you're like me, and you think making your own pie crust is a waste of time, make sure that you pre-bake your frozen pie crust, following the directions on the back of the package.

This was amazing! I used fresh mushrooms and bacon instead of ham and it was wonderful. Make sure to serve it when it's piping hot or else the chedder cheese forms a hard to manage crust on the top. Very easy and yummy!

This is a fantastic basic quiche recipe--easy to add your own ingredients.  My additions/ changes: -shredded cheddar, on bottom and a little on top -baked ham, diced -fresh mushrooms -scallions -Pillsbury pre-made crust -Eggland's Best eggs  Baked for 50 minutes and it came out perfectly.  The amount of eggs and half and half were right on--don't be worried if it doesn't completely fill the pie shell.  Mine rose quite a bit in the oven.

Simply delicious!  This is very hearty with a great texture and good blend of flavors.  It's very firm unlike other quiches I've had and doesn't fall apart when you cut into it.  I really enjoyed it!  I used mozzarella cheese, frozen spinach, and omitted the mushrooms.  I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe is excellent! What I did... I doubled the recipe and used 2 premade pie crusts. I used diced deli ham, fresh spinach and fresh mushrooms, along with swiss, provolone & cheddar cheese. I froze the extra one as recommended in another review. My husband has already requested it for Thanksgiving morning!

I gave this recipe a five star rating because of it's inspiration alone.  I didn't follow the recipe completely but I think that my own rendition came out great!  I used everything it calls for just different amounts and I only used sharp Cheddar cheese.  I used Ruth's Grandma'a Pie Crust recipe for the crust and it was delicious together.

I've made this quiche multiple and each time it always gets rave reviews.  I serve it with a simple side salad with a homemade citrus/olive oil vingerette. 

I have made the following alterations so it lends itself to my families taste and diet:

I use fat free half and half, 4 eggs, 2oz grated swiss, 1 deep dish pie crust, 1 small box frozen spinach, 1 cup fresh sauteed in olive oil mushrooms, 7oz cubed ham steak, and 1oz shredded cheddar. The salt and the flour remain the same.  I also defrost the pie crust and pre-bake it for 5 mintues at 350.

I find that if I use an entire box of frozen spinach I need the extra egg to hold all the veggies together, yet the extra egg is too much liquid for a normal pie crust, so a deep dish pie crust is necessary.

It's still hearty, rich, comfort food and with these alterations you can calorically eat 1/4 of the quiche and not break the bank.      Plus we always have leftovers and it reheats nicely.  Delicious!

It's delicious!  My whole family loves it!  Which is a very rare occurance.  I couldn't give it 5 *s because I've never made it with canned ham and mushrooms.  I use fresh.  I also brush the crust with beaten egg and bake unfilled for a few minutes : )

I made this quiche with some leftover ham, my entire family loved it! I made two and froze one for about two weeks. I popped the frozen one right in the oven and it baked beautifully, and tasted great. Good opportunity for batch cooking.

For a first time quiche maker, I found that this turned out better than I expected.  Eggs set up very well, swiss made it tasty.  Anytime I cam hide spinach and the family likes it, it's worth making again!

This was so good and extremely easy to make. I used pre-cut ham strips instead of the ham the recipe called for. I also used a ready made frozen pie crust and let it thaw for about 10 minutes and then poked holes in the bottom before filling it and it came out perfect. Only thing I will do differently next time is use fresh mushrooms or sauteed mushrooms. I think they would match the quality of the quiche better than with the canned mushrooms. I baked it on a cookie sheet and glad I did because it overflowed a little. We will definitely be making this again.

i wasn't going to rate this recipe because i changed a lot of stuff, but it was so good that i HAD to rate it.  to make this low carb, i didn't use a crust and left out the flour, but added an extra egg.  i used skim milk instead of half-and-half and italian-mix shredded cheese because i didn't have any cheddar.  i used turkey sausage instead of ham.  it came out so well and tastes soooooo good that you'd never guess it was "health food".

Excellent. I used frozen chopped spinach, cooked in the  microwave and squeezed dry, deli ham sliced and chopped small, and all the cheese. Didn't have half-and -half, so I used soy milk. Also, didn't use mushrooms b/c the kids don't like them.  Everyone seemed to enjoy this. I used a frozen crust with no changes to the cooking temp or time - set perfectly, and the kids ate it all. See my pic for a close-up shot.

This was excellent.  I used honey ham lunch meat as a sub for the canned ham and fresh baby bella mushrooms that I put in the microwave for a minute with a little water to blanch them.  I also added 1/2 tsp of white pepper and garlic powder.  It was easy and my husband really liked it, as did I.

I didn't have half and half so I used evaporated milk.  And I added a large dash of nutmeg, and doubled the cheddar and swiss.  This was the creamiest quiche I've ever had.  Delicious, and beautiful.

I made this quiche and it was a great success.  My 17 year old son loved it and he hates fresh spinach.  I made two this week (froze one for later).  I made two more yesterday at 5:30 am.  I did change the receipe in the smallest way.  I used Smithfield ham the first time because I had some in the freezer.  The second time I used deep dish pie shells because they were in the freezer.  One time I ate a reallly fluffy omlet in a restraunt.  I asked what the secret was.  The said add flour and mix in a blender.  This time I added a tablespoon of flour and mixed in the blender to make it fluffy enough to fill a deep pie shell. It worked.  It almost overflowed.  I gave one to my in-laws to enjoy and we are eating the other for dinner tonight. Thanks.

I've been using this recipe for almost a decade now and have modified it to suit whatever leftovers I have hanging out in the frig.....cubed, baked potato for the mushrooms, thick-sliced bacon for the ham, etc.  My only constant change is that I totally cover the bottom crust with sliced swiss cheese and top with shredded swiss but that's just a personal preference, not to mix the cheeses in the same dish.  Even the men in my family find this a hearty lunch served with a salad.

I change a few things b/c of what I had on hand. I used Fat-free milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2. I added a Tbs. butter to egg mixture. I had no mushrooms. I added Roasted red pepper and Onion. It was my first Quiche. Soooo good! I will make this again for sure!

This is a good recipe! I made the butter pie crust recipe from Land O Lakes and baked it till almost golden brown first, then added in the other ingredients. I used one extra egg and it puffed up nicely then came back to normal as it cooled. I didn't have Swiss/mushrooms on hand so I added thawed spinach and topped with shredded Mexican cheese blend. My ham was pretty salty so maybe I didn't need to add the extra salt. I also added some garlic and onion powder that I think added to the flavor.

I used leftover Thanksgiving ham for this and it turned out awesome.  Not a big swiss cheese fan, so we used monterey jack.  Love a tip I got from another recipe of packing the cheese down well on the bottom to keep the crust from getting soggy!

I love this quiche.  It's been in regular rotation since the first time I made it.  I use frozen pie crusts and prebake them.  Instead of flaked ham I cube a ham steak and add a layer of sauteed fresh mushrooms, and use frozen spinach rather than fresh.  I like to add finely chopped onion too.

Great recipe and easy to make. I pre baked the crust for about 5 mins to get it warm and added fresh mushrooms and broccoli instead of spinach. I also topped it with some thick sliced bacon. It came out very tasty and every one loved it.

Great quiche - really does taste like a restaurant recipe. I made it low carb by not using a crust. It came out fine with just mixing everything together. I used deli ham,  fresh mushrooms, frozen spinach, and skim milk instead of half and half and it was delicious.

This was great!  I used half a package of frozen spinach, thawed and drained and got fabulous results.  I diced the cheese and mixed it will all other ingredients before pouring into the shell.  You get a bit of everything in each bite!  Served it at a tea party and got lots and lots of compliments.  Easy to put together and great-tasting.  Very adaptable, too, if you have other ingredients you'd like to add.

This is an easy and tasty recipe just as it is, but I have made a few alterations to it. I serve it in tartshells as an hors d'oeuvre.  Also, I add one chopped white onion, chopped green pepper, and feta cheese.  Tastes great!  My niece (age 3) and nephew (age 7) are crazy about them.

Super recipe! I read the reviews first, did 1 1/2 times the liquid and easily made 2 pies to serve my family of 7 kids and 2 adults. It's easily modified and anything goes!  It's definitely a keeper!

I made this with broccoli and zucchini instead of mushrooms and spinach.  (My little one wouldn't have gone for that!) I also used leftover ham instead of canned and it was VERY quick and good!  :)

Loved this - and OH so easy!!  Can't wait to try different combinations!  I made two - one for the grown ups with broccoli, deli ham, and swiss cheese (oh yeah, and of course the slices of cheese on the bottom - monteray jack!) . .and one for the kids - ham and bacon and cheese.  Both were YUM-MMY!  I had just under 2 cups of heavy cream - (doubled batch) - so used up the cream - and then another 1/2 cup of sour cream - as someone suggested. FLUFFY and YUM. :)

Super easy and delish! This recipe can serve as a good base recipe for any kind of quiche by adding whatever comes to your imagination!  The only thing I changed about this was I used shredded Jack cheese instead of slices of Swiss and used frozen Spinach instead of fresh. Make sure to drain the Spinach very well if you use frozen!

I made this with very little substitutions. I used shredded monterey jack instead of sliced cheese and I used fresh mushrooms cooked in butter and wine. I was looking for a recipe for leftover ham, fresh spinach, fresh mushrooms and pie crust. This was an awesome dish. I will be making it again.

Made this last night--my first quiche!  Hubby and teenage son loved it. I sauteed fresh mushrooms and added them instead of canned,  used diced spiral ham instead of canned ham, and used fat free half and half.  Yum!  In addition to tasting great, it looked beautiful. Will probably skip the meat next time.

This was fast, easy and delicious.  My husband is a big fan--I will definitely make this again.  It's made "My Favorite Recipes" book.  I baked for 55 minutes, then let 'set' for an add'l 10 minutes.  I baked the pie crust 12 minutes before filling in with the ingredients as I read an earlier review that the crust was soggy.  I also sauteed the mushrooms before adding to get rid of some moisture.

Exceptional recipe!Easy! Even better the next day! My modifications: used fresh mushrooms and frozen spinach worked just fine. Added chopped onion and minced garlic. Didn't have the 1/2 &1/2 so used 1/2 c milk and added an extra egg. Used Swiss cheese on the bottom and shredded cheese as well. Used leftover cubed ham, which made it heartier, and topped with more shredded cheese! Modifications were fine, baked at 325 for 45 min at high altitude my kids and man loved it!!! Thanks! Will def make again!

I really thought this was a great recipe.  I made it according to the directions except I did not have the Swiss and I used leftover spiral sliced ham that I diced.  Really delicious served with leafy green salad with red wine vinaigrette and crisp white wine.  I'll be making this often with different meats, cheeses and veggies.  Great!

I changed this a bit and used fresh steamed broccoli chopped, diced ham instead of flaked, colby cheese on top and omitted the salt (due to the salt in ham).  I baked in a 11" quiche pan lined with a pillsbury pie crust.  Baked for 45 minutes and it was GREAT!  My family loved it!

I have been using this recipe as a great base for quiche for years now and it comes out great every time. I use fat free half and half to make it healthier. I also often make versions with just broccoli or sometimes spinach and onion. Great with every variation. I also use a frozen deep dish pie crust and just put it straight in the oven filled.

Great quiche recipe!  My picky husband, and 3 kids ages 5 and under really liked it!  I do agree that it could use more swiss cheese, layered in the middle.  Otherwise I enjoyed the flavors and texture, and I don't even like Swiss cheese!

Quite yummy!  I diced some leftover baked ham to use rather than the canned ham.  I also omitted the swiss cheese since I didn't have any.  Also used whole milk.  Otherwise followed the recipe...yum!  Thanks!

This recipe was great!  I also used deli ham as opposed to canned and just chopped the thin-sliced pieces.  I omitted the mushrooms and used frozen spinach - just thaw and dry first.  Be sure to pre-bake the crust for about 5 minutes.

Pretty good quiche recipe. I omitted the crust, to make it healthier. I just chopped up the cheese, spinach and mushrooms and stirred it all up before pouring it into dish. I also topped with some additional cheese. Made great breakfast with leftovers.

I was looking for a good basic quiche recipe. This worked out very well. I didn't use spinach or ham, instead I sauteed mushrooms in garlic butter and added those to the bottom of the quiche along with four strips of chopped, pre-cut bacon, cheddar and mozzerella cheeses. This recipe turned out well, I will probably try additional variations. Thanks for a great quiche recipe!

My first quiche was a success!  I used a ready made crust and I omitted the mushrooms (don't like them) and it turned out great!  I used finely chopped deli honey ham, frozen spinach and low-fat half-and-half because I had them on hand.  My boyfriend even liked it and took the leftovers to work today!  Next time, I'll try some bacon or broccoli.  What a great dish!

This is the best quiche I have ever had. Next time, however, I will use fresh mushrooms instead of canned.

Delicious!  I doubled the swiss cheese, used 1 pkg. of frozen spinach thawed and drained and fresh mushrooms sauteed in butter.  I also used leftover ham, chopped and mozzarella cheese on top.  The crust was brown and it came out perfect!  We all loved it!  Can't wait to make again.

What a terrific quiche recipe. I used 2 slices of swiss and used chopped broccoli & mushroom slices instead of spinach. I also sauteed the broc and shrooms in a little butter first. Good with leftover honey baked ham. Will definitely make this again!

This was great!  I did make some modifications.  I made 1 1/2 times the amount of liquid/flour/egg/salt mixture and got a much fuller pie (I've made this twice).  I also used evaporated milk instead of half-and-half which worked perfect.  I used all swiss cheese instead of cheddar.  I've tried both bacon and ham and loved them both.  I also used quite a bit of spinach and could hardly taste it.  Definitely didn't think it was overpowering.  Thanks!

Normally I like spinach but I thought the flavor overwhelmed everything else. If I ever made this again, I will definitely use another vegetable in place of it.  From what I could taste in bites without the spinach, it was pretty good.

This was the first quiche I had ever made - and it was WONDERFUL!  Very easy, and incredibly delicious.  Filled a family of four, and had two pieces leftover, but they disappeared early the next morning.  What a great recipe!

Very good, my husband loved it!  I put Munster cheese slices on top of the pastry shell. I used milk and forgot the flour so it was a bit moist but not runny. It's good cold too.

Made it to the letter and loved it. 
The next time I made it I used 1 cup broccoli instead of spinach and mushrooms and about 1/2 cup diced ham (from a picnic roll or whatever they are called). I sauteed 1/4 cup diced onion and 1 clove of garlic until soft and added that along with about 1 tsp dried dill. I used a 9 inch frozen pie shell and it was too shallow for the amount of egg/cream mixture so next time I will maybe only use 3/4 cup half and half... or maybe use less fillings.
Basically, the egg mixture in this recipe is perfect and you can add whatever cheese, meat and veggie combo you want as long as you don't go overboard!

Wow! This was fantastic! I used three slices of cheddar ( that was what I had on hand) and they nicely covered the crust.  I upped the chopped fresh spinach to 1.5 cups (more veggies), used 4oz fresh sliced mushrooms ( sautéed in a little butter), 3/4 to 1 c chopped left over ham, and 1/2 c shredded mozzarella (what I had).  I layered the spinach on top of the sliced cheese, according to the recipe, which really helped keep the crust crisp and not at all soggy.  I then combined the ham and mushrooms with the egg mixture.  I finished it off with a light sprinkling of shaved Parmesan. This was soo easy, and the directions were simple.  The result was fabulous! My daughter (who up to now wanted no part of cooking) asked if I could show her how to make it! A new household favorite!

perfect in terms of proportions of eggs, creamo and flour.  do not add salt to ham and do not use canned mushrooms.  i made it with leftover baked ham, garlic-butter sauteed leeks, onions, and scallions and sharp cheddar cheese.  yumm!

Really enjoyed this recipe. Cooked the pie crust first, used shredded swiss (all I had), cheddar, small can of mushrooms, and ham (no spinach). Mixed everything together instead of layering and cooked for just over 50 mminutes. Perfect, DH has already eaten almost half of the quiche, next time I will double the recipe to make one for now and one for later. Thanks for sharing!

I've already had request by my husband to make it again. I did omit the mushrooms (don't like them)and added a pinch of nutmeg seasoning. Instead of the sliced cheese, I used 3/4 cup of shredded cheddar cheese, because that's my favorite cheese. Keeper!

A nice dish. Left out the cheddar to cancel out some calories, and a lot more spinach and mushrooms into it. I used deli sliced ham and cut it "julienne" style (long thin strips). I am a hot and spice lovin' girl so I added Tobasco before tossing it into the oven. Yummy yum.

This was delicious. It was lighter than most quiches, which I loved. My husband and son loved it - my son at half of the pie! I used a frozen deep dish pie crust and precooked it. The fresh spinach was excellent. I think the thing that made this special was the layering. Most quiches I have made were a bunch of mixed ingredients poured into a crust. Oh, I used leftover honeybaked home which is wonderful. This is a keeper! Thanks.

This is the first time I have ever made quiche and it turned out SO good! I didn't have swiss cheese so I used feta instead and didn't have half and half so I used whipping cream with a little water. I also left out the mushrooms because I think they are yucky. I was very surprised how flavorful it was and it looks so pretty. This is my new go-to quiche recipe! Thanks for sharing :)

WOW!  This is so good.  I have been craving quiche and decided to make this one.  All I can say is YUM!  I used fresh, chopped spinach, deli ham, no fat 1/2 and 1/2 and fresh mushrooms.  Kids and hubby all loved it too.  A keeper!

Hands down, the best quiche recipe.  For a low-carb version, I omitted the crust and substituted 1 c. cottage cheese for the half and half.

I was surprised at how good this turned out.  I used deli sliced ham, fresh mushrooms, and fat-free evaporated milk.  I think it could have used more egg/milk though--the pie seemed a bit thin.

I used 4 slices of Swiss to line the dough.Ran out of flour and no one told me,so I substituted Tempura flour for the all-purpose. It turned out Superb!!! Extremely tasty yet mild. YAY! for Tempura mix!!! Would definitely cook it again!

I have been using this recipe for years and it comes out great every time. I make up multiple batches and put them in the disposable pie plates and cook them just underdone and freeze them. Thank you, Judy, for a great meal that even my 4 yr old will eat including the spinach!!

It is hearty.  It is rich.  It isn't all that tasty though.  There are a lot better on this site.  It cooked fine and was nice in presentation, but flavor, not so much.

I made this with leftover baked ham, frozen chopped spinach (defrosted and with moisture squeezed out), 1/2 a small onion (diced) and about 1/2 tbsp garlic powder. This made a very good dinner, but I thought the spinach itself needed seasoning added.  This was very easy to prepare and makes a very filling meal.  I'm looking forward to tomorrow's leftovers!

Wonderful! I omit the mushrooms and use the little cubed ham from the deli meat section instead of the canned ham. This is great and I just love it. These also freeze well so that you can thaw and pop in the oven when you don't have time to cook. Thanks!

This was good, but a bit salty. I had to use frozen spinach since fresh wasnt in season. Maybe next time Ill leave out the spinach all together and the additional 1/2 tsp salt.

Yum! technique is a little different--adding the ham on top of the egg mixture; I wasn't paying attention and had to pick the ham and mushrooms off and then add them back. Also used frozen spinach because that was on hand. But it still was great.

This is my new favorite quiche! Don't skip the swiss on the bottom - what a difference that makes - yum! Followed recipe as written, and it turned out perfectly after 45 min. baking time + letting sit 10 minutes to set up.

Wow, this is great.  We had it with the Slow Cooker Corn Chowder and left the ham out of both for our vegetarian friends.  Everyone loved it, even my kids.  I will make this again next week.

I use deep dish frozen pie shells, smoked ham from the deli and add sauteed onion and really stuff the crust full! I make four at a time and freeze two half-baked pies. This is the best quiche I've ever tasted and I get so many rave reviews, no matter what ingredient combo I come up with. Very easy, also. This is a great basic recipe for a variety of ingredients. Mix it up!

Easy and delicious!  Just the correct amount of egg/half and half mix to fill a small pie plate, not a deep dish.  You can use almost anything in a quiche and this is a tasty combination.   Hubby loved it, so it is going in  my recipe box, for sure.

This is a delicious recipe, although I would recommend switching out the Swiss for shredded mild cheddar, and also replace the spinach with broccoli. Add some onion and you're golden.

I love this recipe and have used it on several occasions!  I have added a little thyme, garlic and onion to flavour up a bit and our family loves it.  Even the fussy 2 year old and the husband who says he doesn't like quiche!  I tried the freeze and bake option by YUMMEST but it took over an hour to cook from frozen.  If I would try it again I would thaw it completely and then cook for 35 min.

I've made the recipe more than once and it was delicious. It had the right amount of eggs and other ingredients. I used the pre-made crust.

This was easy to put together, baked in only 35 minutes (convection) and was pretty tasty. I made it without a crust and with a couple of changes. I didn't have half and half so used half low fat milk and half greek yogurt. I also used leftover ham, not canned. Other than that the only change was to get ahead of the directions and accidentally mix everything together before I saw it was supposed to be layered. Turned out great but I was surprised that it only filled the pie pan to about 1/2 full. As a breakfast dish, without anything on the side, I got 4 servings.

I used this quiche as part of a mothers day brunch and did i ever get compliments. I made the mistake of only making one and everyone was asking for more. But as a hint I doubled the egg mixture and just used regular deli ham. Excellent!

My first quiche and it was spectacular.  I used a 9" glass pie dish and not a drop spilled over.  The ingredient amts. were on the mark.  I did saute fresh mushrooms and scallions and layered them over the swiss cheese.  I too mixed the forest ham that I used in with the egg mixture.  Then topped with the cheddar cheese.  Baked it for 55 min. and let it cool for about 20 min.  (I believe it would have been runny if I had cut into it sooner!)  I am looking forward to making this again - changing the ingredients with hot sausage or bacon, etc.  I will add some of my own spices the next time.  Thanks submitter!

didn't have swiss and made with similar cheese. No shredded ham but used finely chopped ham steak. Very easy to make and even with the changes it turned out really good.  Great recipe to try for 1st time quiche bakers.  Will try to have swiss and shredded ham next time I try this recipe .

Made this a day ahead and refrigerated it so I could throw it in the oven on Christmas morning. Everyone LOVED it! Will definitely make this again and again. I used fresh mushrooms and sauteed them to get the water out as some reviews said the crust was undercooked and soggy. This was not the case for mine. Also used frozen drained spinach and shredded Swiss cheese, not slices. Mixed Swiss in with 1/4 egg mixture and put that it the crust first. Layered the spinach next, then the mushrooms then sliced lunch meat ham. Finally added the rest of the egg mixture with the cheddar cheese mixed in 
 Turned out perfectly. Very flavorful.

Since I had ham left over from a dinner party, I decided to try this recipe.  Excellent!  I did saute the spinach and fresh mushrooms in 1 T oil before adding to pie crust . This eliminated any excess moisture some one else experienced. It turned out so delicious, I definitely  make it again.

This was absolutely delicious! I made just a couple of changes. I baked the crusts for 10 minutes prior to filling as suggested by other reviews. I doubled the recipe and also doubled the about of swiss cheese. Glad I did! Also added some diced green onions. I also used leftover ham instead of canned. I also didn't have very much half and half so I substituted whole milk. I will definitely make this again!

This tasted fantastic and was so easy! I used fresh chopped spinach, fresh portobello shrooms (as I did not have canned shrooms or frozen spinach) and added chopped scallions. I also used Pillsbury ready made pie crust and baked it for 10 minutes at 425 prior to putting the mixture in. It cooked at 350 for 1 hr in my oven and it was perfect! This is now in the rotation!

This was the best tasting quiche my family ever tasted.  I did do a few changes, as we had some diet restrictions for the guests.  Instead of flour, I used corn starch and a gluten free pie crust for the non gluten members of the party.  I also didn't include mushrooms and spinach because I thought it may make the quiche too soggy.  I added an extra ounce of ham and 2 extra slices of swiss cheese.  Lastly, I added a small can of hatch green chilis.  My dad said it was the best quiche he had ever had.  Everyone else agreed.

Best quiche I’ve ever made. My other quiche recipes were okay but came out flat. This one was fluffy yet rich and dense. Delicious! Only thing I did different was prick my crust with a fork a couple times and bake by itself for 10 min before adding the rest of the ingredients. I also added 1/4c sour cream to my eggs. This recipe is a keeper!!

This turned out great! I used ham that was leftover from Easter and grated Swiss cheese instead of cheese slices It was the perfect amount for one pie shell.

This was good!  Will make again.  I made as recipe except for mushrooms (not everyone is a fan).  I had to cook at least 15 minutes longer it was still runny in the middle after the recipe time.

Really liked this quiche!  Made own crust and baked for about 8 mins. before assembling quiche. Didn't add mushrooms b/c my kids  asked me not to...I gave in even though I love mushrooms. If I make again I'll add fresh ones and saute for 5-8 mins first before adding to quiche.  Took this and another quiche to potluck. This one was the favorite.

Very good recipe for reference.  Came out fine!  Did adjust slightly.  Instead of spinach, I used some fresh asparagus.  Also lightly cooked several fresh mushrooms with a couple slices of onion to reduce moisture and added these to the bottom of the shell, on top of the asparagus.  Yes, we'll make again!

Awesome recipe! Mix in some optional chopped green onion, chopped fresh west coast shrimp, or add some well done chopped bacon bits. Always use as much cheeses as you dare. This is a winner , go-to recipe that never disappoints.
Don't be afraid to cook it a few minutes longer! 
Enjoy!

I used lunch meat ham instead of canned. Followed the rest of the directions pretty closely. I recommend pre cooking the crust. Very good quiche. I have also made it without the mushrooms and spinach for those in my family who don't care for them. I just added another egg and it was good to go!

I make this a LOT and it's hard to mess up ! I use more swiss to cover bottom and sides of crust, and really whatever I have around, using the basic recipe. Ham, Crisp crumbled bacon or sausage, left over turkey or  chicken - really anything ! I load everything and pour the egg mixture over all, it's completely delicious. I usually bake the day before and just reheat  'by the slice' next morning, when we have overnight guests.

I made this gluten free for my wife and it was excellent! I substituted Pilsbury gluten free flour and used a coconut/almond milk blend instead of half-n-half. For the crust, I make my own gluten free crusts however the ones available at Whole Foods are quite good. I omitted the mushrooms because I didn't have any fresh and would never use a canned mushroom. This was the lightest one I've ever made and the two of us finished the whole thing in one sitting.

Made as per recipe, except owed skim milk (all I had) and softened the spinach and mushrooms to avoid excess moisture from having to use milk instead of cream.  Turned out great and used up leftovers!

I gave it a five star only because of my tweeks to the recipe.  I made this for the first time yesterday.  Used evaporated milk, instead of half & half.  I used shredded swiss on bottom of pie.  I    sauted fresh mushrooms, onion, garlic and fresh coursely chopped spinach.  A must to sautee prior to adding, it makes for a more tastey and firmer quiche....Delicious.

This is the best quiche I've ever made and the best I've eaten all around! I tweaked it just a bit by using fresh leftover chopped ham, fresh mushrooms, havarti instead of Swiss cheese slices  and extra cheddar cheese. I sprinkled it with sliced green onion.  Perfect morning or afternoon meal!

Changes: I used evaporated milk instead of half and half, and jarlsberg cheese on the bottom with white vermont cheese on top. I also added chopped onion, used a ham steak , himalayan salt and french five blend pepper.  Also - I only used fresh vegetables.

Fantastic!

I've been making quiche for years, and we all loved this recipe.  Leftover smoked ham, evaporated milk, no mushrooms- were the only changes I made.  A winning combination of smoky ham, healthy spinach and tasty custard.  Yum.

I didn't use heavy cream, just skim milk.  And I added two eggs because my pie plate appeared to be bigger than suggested.  NO mushrooms in this one but everything else went in and it was great.  I used Jarlsberg cheese on the bottom and sharp cheddar on top.  I will definitely make it again.

Very good! I mainly used this to see how many eggs and half & half I should use. I omitted the mushrooms, added pepper, and a dash of onion & garlic powders. I used Swiss and also a little cheddar and Grana Pandano on top. Nice, easy, dinner!

This was very good. I used fresh torn up spinach. I am so glad I made two.

Didn't have any Swiss cheese, but had lots of cheddar and Parmesan on hand. I added finely minced onion, just a dash, and instead of flaked ham I used finely cubed toupie style ham. Also, for health, I used 1% milk instead of cream. It came out perfect. Everyone went crazy for it, as no one had eaten quiche before. It's definitely a keeper recipe.

I used 1% milk instead of half-and-half and it was great. I also used frozen spinach instead of fresh because that's what I had. I think fresh would be better. Also used diced ham instead of canned. It set beautifully and was very delicious. I made 2 quiche and frozen one for later.  This is a keeper!

Good traditional recipe. Only thing I would add next time is some salt to the egg badder.

all the loggers loved this ...    I made this quiche with cubed ham because thats what I wanted to use up. I also mixed all the ingredients by accident and it was just fine, but I left out the mushrooms (sadly on purpose) :( Also Made the Belle and Chron's Spinach and Mushroom Quiche from all recipes at the same time. The guys really liked this one probably becfause the other one had mushrooms. and i'm obsessed with mushrooms in everything

This was easy and delicious! I substituted a few items for my own. I didn't have any swiss cheese so I just sprinkled some shredded cheddar cheese on the bottom. I also sauteed fresh mushrooms and onions. I plan on making it again this Sunday. My hubby loved it too. I made 2 pies so he had one to eat on throughout the week. He's been bragging about it all week!

This is a good quiche recipe, but nothing spectacular.  I used mozzerella cheese instead of cheddar since I had it on hand.  It filled a 9" pie plate perfectly without overflowing. It was hearty enough to satisfy my husband and had enough veggies to make me happy.  Overall, a successful combination.

Sorry, but this gets a thumbs down from me. I've made plenty of quiches and this one is very average. It needed a tablespoon or two of flour to hold it together better. It was kind of runny so I had to bake it longer. This had an unfortunate effect on all the other ingredients and actually made them taste bland. I don't recommend this one.

This was a great recipe!  It was very simple and tasted great! It was the first quiche I made and it turned out wonderfully!  The next time I make it, I will add a little more spinach and use thicker sliced ham.  I used deli ham and it was just a little too flaky for my personal taste. Yummy recipe!

I was looking for something to serve my cousins in a few weeks for our Christmas lunch.  I decided on a Quiche and found this recipe.  I tried it out on my husband and he loved it.  I just served a salad with it and it was plenty.  I used fresh spinach and I didn't think it overpowered the tast at all.  Great Quiche!
