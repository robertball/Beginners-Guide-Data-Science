I doubled the recipe and made this for thirty people at a baby shower - it was a huge hit!  There were NO leftovers!  I took the advice of many other reviewers added pecans and apples (with skins - but no celery!), added red and green grapes, used less cool whip, used low fat cool whip, strained the canned fruit overnight, added a large box of pistachio instant pudding to the whipped topping and substituted sour cream for the milk - made it very thick and creamy, not runny at all, and the colors of the fruit looked great - together it was a perfect combination!  I tossed it lightly with my hands and it was so simple.  You can't go wrong with this recipe - add any fresh fruit you want!

Very disappointed with this. I love ambrosia salad and was looking for a recipe. With all the rave reviews I thought I had found a good one. But this turned out sickly sweet and not at all what I was looking for. Needed much more fruit and the combination of the marshmallows with so much whipped topping put it over the edge for sweetness. Next time I'll try the one that uses sour cream. I think that's closer to the dish I remember.

Excellent recipe.  Everyone LOVED this!!!  I made this twice in the last week.  The first time I made it with strawberry Cool Whip and used two cans of mandarin oranges.  It was really good (a little too much coconut though).  The second time I made it I used regular Cool Whip but added a box of instant pistachio pudding to the Cool Whip and then added the rest of the stuff, still using two cans of mandarin oranges.  I only used about 1 1/4 cups of coconut this time.  Everyone raved about this recipe with the pistachio pudding in it.  I will definitely make it this way from now on.  Thanks for the recipe Didi!!! :-)

I've never made this before and I needed something easy in a hurry.  Great recipe and tastes incredibly yummy.  For those who are recipe-challenged like me, the 3 1/2 cups whipping cream comes out to roughly an 8 oz tub.  It's ever so slightly less, but not enough to make a difference.

Really good fruit salad! I omitted the milk and added 1 cup of chopped pecans and a teaspoon of vanilla. I think it would be good with more fruit too, maybe even some bananas. Update: do not omit the milk unless you will be eating this salad the same day. Overnight the marshmallows absorb all the juices.

Amazing stuff.  I made it for a few friends at a barbeque and they loved it.  I did add some other kinds of fruit (grapes and apples). Can't wait to make again.  Thanks.

We love this ambrosia. I have just altered this a little bit to our taste. I use 2 cans oranges, 1 can crushed pineapple, 3 cups cool whip, 1 cup sour cream, 2 heaping cups marshmallows, and 1jar of cherries. Oh, if I have grapes I throw some halved grapes in too. This really gets better with chill time. It is great to make it the night before. Delicious. Thanks for the inspiration.

This was delicious!  Just like I remember it at all of my family picnics when I was little.  I did leave out the coconut and served it on the side (my husband hates coconut) and I also added 1/2 cup of sour cream for extra creaminess and tang.  It was perfect!

I made this for a church picnic last night and it disappeared in no time. I'm glad I taste-tested it before I left home because there was none left when it was my turn in line! It tasted great and I will definitley be making this recipe many times again!

This was my first shot at making a fruit salad and it was so easy and quick not to expensive as well. The taste was awesome. Although I think adding more mandarine oranges would really set it off next time. My family loved it.
Thanks !

It is a good quickie salad. It was a bit bland for me. I like my food to make a statement even if it is subtle. Second time around I added a chopped gala apple quickly dipped in lemon juice. Skipped the milk and used yogurt instead and I had some vanilla syrup and added a tbls. Also let the fruit sit in a strainer for 1/2 hour. Much better ambrosia salad  offered a delicate sweet vanilla tone and a cooling tropical fling.

I made (doubled) this for Christmas Eve, and based on others' reviews, added pistacio instant pudding mix and lowfat sour cream in place of milk. I omited the cherries and added strawberries and even left out the marshmallows. I added apples, red grapes, and pecans (toasted them, didn't work, they got soggy, but the coconut was nice toasted). Everyone liked it alot, but didn't taste the pudding flavor because I made the mistake of using a small package of sugar-free (& 1 regular), which was almost flavorless! I made it again already & this time used 2 small regular packs of the pudding mix and it became a beautiful light green and very flavorful! The best part is that the regular pudding has tiny pistacio bits in it (you don't really have to add nuts at all) which makes it divine!! You really can add any fruit, fresh or canned (2nd time I replaced crushed pineapple with a can of WELL-DRAINED Dole Tropical Mixed Fruit which has pineapple chunks. It was amazing!) I'm a coconut freak, but depending on how much other fruit I choose to add, I decide the amount of coconut I want to add at the end (at least a good cup so far). I also used all lite whipped topping & it was fabulous. threw in a banana. with or without marshmallows, woo-hoo! happy mixing!

Traditional fruit fluff.  Was looking for this recipe, had this at different functions but didn't know what it was.  I am VERY happy I have found it.  At first I omitted the coconut, not a huge fan if coconut.  Tasted great!  I toned down the sweetness by doing half the whipped cream and half sour cream, and dumped in whatever fruit I was in the mood for!  I would be carefull of adding juicy fruit.  It might make it pretty watery.  Drain your fruit good!
one more time YUMMY!

This was good, however you need to REALLY like sweet things to enjoy this. It's really sweet and we found it a little too sweet for our tastes.

Made this pretty much as stated except that we liked how it was tasting and looking so much that we added a little more of everything (without actually measuring). This was SO good! No one could stay out of it. We didn't add enough of anything to really drastically change this recipe so I would have to say to make it just as the recipe states.  Very easy to make too. I'd never made it before and I love how simple this is! Just put everything in a big bowl and mix... doesn't get any easier than that!

This was a good base but like others I tweaked it a little. I added some fruit cocktail, a banana(put a little lemon juice on it and it won't turn brown), an apple and instead of milk I used sour cream...yummy. also added some walnuts.

We used fruit cocktail instead of the pineapple, and instead of milk, we used mayonnaise (NOT Miracle Whip) to cut the sweetness. I use aabout 1/3 c., but you can add it to taste. A classic recipe!

Very easy to make, fairly inexpensive. Everyone loved it at my gathering - much better than the boring fruit salad we usually have. I think I'll ad some more fruit next time, because they tended to hide in the fluff. Maybe some strawberries?

We loved this recipe!  Couldn't find Whipped Topping here in Australia (so instead used 1 cup heavy cream whipped until almost stiff, added 1/2 cup sugar and 1 tsp vanilla and beat until peaks hold) and omitted the milk.  Guests are a bit suprised at the ingredients, but there is never any left!  Thanks very much.

Being born, raised and still living in the Deep South, I know good Ambrosia and this is GOOD Ambrosia.  It's SO good that when I asked my friends what to bring to Thanksgiving Dinner, they said for me to bring one thing...this Ambrosia.  It's the best I've ever eaten.

I made this to take to a Hawaiian party.  I followed the recipe bones, so to speak, but only used 1 cup coconut.  I used coloured mini marshmallows, I added one can of fruit cocktail, 1/2 cup chopped pecans, and I eliminated the cherries and milk.  I estimated the amount of whipped topping - maybe 2 1/2 cups?  I just added until it was pretty moist.  I suggest draining your fruits very well, and I prefer it made ahead so the marshmallows get very soft and foamy.  The leftovers still taste yummy after 2 days.

I took this dish to Easter dinner and it was the talk of the evening. It is extremely easy to make and very tasty. It was a nice alternative to a heavy dessert. Thanks Didi!....I followed the recipe exactly and I didn't make any changes as suggested by other reviewers. It tasted fine to me.

Very tasty and well received at the party I attended. Instead of sour cream, I used 1 8-oz container of low fat, plain yogurt. I also used almost a 16-oz container of Cool Whip and extra fruit. Chilling the ingredients beforehand helps if you want to prepare and go.

This worked well for me as a base to start from. I added a greater variety of fruit and left out the cherries. Next time I may throw in some nuts also.

A delicious summer dessert, not too sweet. Better if chilled overnite.
Will make again!

So Yummy! I used fresh pineapple, mandarin oranges, and seedless green grapes.  It was much more like a dessert (and less like a fruit salad) with all of the cool whip and marshmallows, but really tasty and a huge hit with my guests.

I served this recipe to 27 guests on Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  However, I substituted the 1/2 cup of milk for sour cream!  It was great.  May 12 year old daughter helped make it and had lots of fun too.

This was a great (and easy recipe).  I had a craving for something sweet and citrusy on a hot summer day in the desert and this one fit the bill. One minor change, I used fresh whipped cream in lieu of the whipped topping.

This ambrosia is really good. I added less coconuts (only 1 cup) and please do not put milk in this ambrosia. It's not necessary. You don't want it to be runny! I give this recipe 4 stars because of the milk, however, mine would get a 5!

I've been making this for years.  Also tastes great with a container of pina colada or pineapple yogurt in place of the milk.  Adds a bit of tangy smoothie flavor.

This was excellent! The family gave it rave reviews.  My daughter's boyfriend who doesn't like coconut, said this was very good, he had seconds.
I used only 1 cup coconut and I also used a little of the cherry juice to color it.  Other than those two adjustments, I followed the recipe completely.  I did make it the night before, to allow the flavors to blend nicely in the refrigerator.

Quick, easy, and delicious!  I didn't measure anything.  I just used a tub of frozen whipped topping and dumped in the cans of pineapple and oranges. Used a small jar of cherries and small bag of walnuts. Then just dumped marshmallows and coconut until it looked good to me.  It couldn't be any easier and tastes GREAT!

Really good. After I noted some other suggestions here on reviews,  I added a little sour cream to cut the cool whip sweeteness a bit and a touch of milk to thin out. And I only used 1 cup of coconut...2 just seemed like too much.

I looked for this recipe because my aunt used to make an ambrosia similar to this but she also added small curd cottage cheese to the cool whip and it was awesome! I'll try this recipe and see if it tastes the same. Thanks!

Great recipe, but I added fresh clementine oranges which really added to the overall taste and appearance of the finished product. If you don't have fresh clementines I would suggest doubling the amount of mandarine oranges.

Great dessert! Everyone who tried it really liked it; some were apprehensive as to what it was ;)  

I used a 1/2 cup of sour cream (rather than milk) as someone suggested. It makes a lot too! So consider how much you need and adjust accordingly.

Have made this a couple of times now and it is a big hit!  I grew up loving ambrosia salad and am happy to have found a receipe that matches my memory of the dish.  Like some other reviewers I used sour cream rather than the whipped topping and added 2 packages of pistachio pudding mix.  I love the added crunch of the little bits of pistachio.   If the green color turns you off though, it is certainly still very good without it.  Also, I prefer to use chopped pineapple rather than crushed - I tried the crushed but think it makes it a little too mushy.  Thanks for the receipe!

I've never had ambrosia salad before, but I love all the ingredients, so I thought I would give it a try. Wow, I'm glad I did! It is such a refreshing summer dessert. I will be making this often, minus the maraschino cherries. Just going to grab some now!

I could not believe how easy and tasty this was. I added diced apples because I like "crunch" and I omitted the milk because I thought that would make it too "runny". It was so good, I will definitely be making this again!

I liked this recipe and rated it a 4 because I always add a 16 ounce tub of sourcream to my ambrosia.  You can't go wrong with the fruit and whipped topping, but add some sourcream and you get the bold flavor of all of the fruit.

This was my first attempt at making a fruit salad and it turned out great.  I following some suggestions.  I used only 20oz of cool whip and used a stick of cream cheese.  I used less coconut and added a can of fruit cocktail and a couple of apples for texture.

This is a simple to make yet delicious ambrosia salad. One thing to observe is if the coconut flakes being used are old and too dry, they will not get moist even after refrigerating the salad overnight. So, be sure to use only fresh and moist coconut.

Added a box of instant pistachio pudding, as others suggested. That helped. However, way too much whipped cream stuff and not enough fruit. Made it nearly tasteless. I added more pineapple (used an entire 15 oz. can) and a can of apricots, diced (that's all I had in the cabinet). I wasn't keen about it, but people at the barbeque seemed to like it and some even had seconds.

I made this according to the recipe the first time. Wow! I really prefer more fruit and a whole lot less topping and coconut. The second time I chopped up four navel oranges, used half whipped and half sour cream, and added celery and walnuts. Pretty darn good, and not nearly as sweet. My guests loved it with the modifications. Thanks Didi

I have always loved ambrosia and this by far is the best recipe for it I have ever come across.  I have made it four times now and I never get tired of it.  I did take one person's advice, however, and I use light sour cream in place of the milk. If you love coconut, you have to make this salad.  P

Very good but not quite "great."  I would definitely add more mandarin oranges next time and use cream cheese to make it a bit creamer.  Otherwise its a keeper!

Over thirty years, and barely any negative comments? It's all right for ambrosia, I suppose, but it's best without the cherries.

I made this dessert for a Christmas Eve party at my cousin's this past year.  I added just a bit of ground cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg to the original recipe, also instead of milk, I added sour cream.  It was delicious, just as good as what Mom used to make!!

I have made this salad twice for parties.  It went over great both times!  The changes I made were similar to the others, sour cream instead of milk, and added pistachio pudding.  I also added some orange extract to give it a little boost.  I will definitely make this again!

I've been making Ambrosia for 30 years, but instead of whipped topping, I use sour cream.  It's much better and not as sweet.

I was never a big ambrosia fan until I found this recipe. Now I can't get enough of it! I used the suggestion of other reviewers of adding pistachio pudding mix in and I think that's what really makes the recipe. I also add extra fruit, such as chopped apples, bananas, grapes, etc. We found the coconut and marshmallows to be a bit much, so we only use 1 cup of each now

I made this for my husband for Father's Day dessert and it was a hit. Even my three year old wanted some. The only thing I did different was substituting cool whip with fresh heavy whipped cream (3/4 cup cream with about 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 tsp vanilla). I also added a can of fruit cocktail. Overall, I adjusted the amount of the coconut and marshmallow to my desirable taste. Will definitely make this again for my next family gathering.

Great recipe.  I did use real cream and like others, used instant pudding.  It stablizes the cream very well.  Definately double the recipe.  It does keep well.  Thanks for the recipe.

I would give this 4.5 if I could and it's a 5 with some modifications.  I reduce the coconut to 1/2 cup and, like others, just use one tub of Cool Whip. I use 2 cans of mandarin oranges and the large can of crushed pineapple. I use 1/4c milk and 1/4c sour cream.  I've made this for several gatherings and there are never any leftovers.

This was excellent.  I've made it three times now, and it's been great!!!  The first time I made it by the book, but the next time, I made it with a small package with banana pudding mix in it, and it added a lot of flavor, as well as adding a can of fruit cocktail to add a better variety of fruit to it.  It is a great recipe!!!

My family loves this recipe. It's just like my Grandmas used to be! I always double the recipe at Christmas time. There is never any left. I followed the recipe, except I add some of the cherry juice from the maraschino's. It makes the salad a beautiful pink color, instead of soo white from the cool whip. It also adds a great flavor.

I was disappointed in this salad. It has too much coconut and not enough oranges & pineapple. The whip topping makes it too sweet. I prefer the version with sour cream and a bit less coconut, but still plenty (Grandma's Five Cup Salad from this site). To me that is more of a traditional Ambrosia. Sorry this one just didn't do it for me or my family.

A great recipe for kids of all ages to help make. My sons (ages 3 and 2yrs)helped me mix it for a family Luau and they were so proud of their dessert! Watching them explain how they made it to all those enjoying it was a treat just as delicious.

The best ambrosia I've ever made!  We aren't big coconut fans in my family, so I sprinkle just a little in the mixture and serve the rest on the side for others to use as garnish. I also use a larger can of pineapple, an 8oz. tub of Cool whip, and don't use the milk or cherries. This dish is always requested for the holidays!

Great, easy recipe.  Good comfort food and great for a quick, throw-together family pleaser.  However, I used only one 8 oz. tub of whipped topping and 16 oz. of sour cream, both low fat.  I think it tastes a bit richer and sets better with the addition of the sour cream.  My husband and father-in-law both loved it, kids too (of course!)

This was pretty good.  I cut the amount of marshmellows in half because I thought it would be too sweet.  I also add some toasted pecan bits.  There was quite a bit left after Christmas, but we had a huge selection of desserts.  I enjoyed it until the leftovers were gone.

I made this for tomorrow's church gathering. My husband insisted on taking a test taste and said it was exactly like what his mom used to make! He absolutely loved it. Added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts for some crunch. Thank you for sharing this recipe. It is simple and tastes divine. I would definately make this again.

This is a quick and easy ambrosia recipe, but I think the true secret is to mix in a stick of softened cream cheese into the cool whip. It gives it a unique and really great flavor that everyone always raves about.

This recipe turned out to be delicious, especially the day after. I used light wipped cream and only used a few maraschino cherries as they are very flavourful. I thought the dry coconut I added stood out a bit especially the first day I made it because it's texture is different from anything else in the salad, so fresh coconut might be a better choice. Anyways, I loved the flavour the coconut gave it, it was delicious. Even my boyfriend liked it, he had 3 servings and he is a VERY picky eater! Thank you!

Very Good 
I added Apples and Toastes pecans & some of the coconut I only used between 1/4 - 1/2 a cup
I only had 8 oz cool whip but it was still super. I Deleted the milk and added a couple TBS of the pineapple juice instead.
also I bought pineapple chunks insead of crushed.. It was still great.

I LOVE this recipe.  The only thing I do differently is I do not drain the pineapple & I delete the milk.  This salad has a lot of coconut, which is great if you love coconut.  I also make it the night before so the marshmallows have a chance to soak up the liquid & get all soft & foamy.  Letting it sit overnight with the cherries also gives it a slight pink tint which is great for baby showers or baptisms for little girls.  Also makes a nice salad for bridal showers, Easter or picnics.  Could also be used as a light dessert.

EVERYONE LOVED THIS!! Took suggestions and substituted sour cream for milk; reduced coconut to 1 1/4 cups; added Pistachio instant pudding to whipped topping; and added 1 to 1 1/2 cups of slices almonds. Definitely will add this to our holiday menu.

This was soooooo good.  I added one box of pistacchio pudding mix and 1/2 cup walnuts and a handful of whole green grapes.  Everyone at the party was raving about my fruit salad.  Others were happy there was no sour cream in it.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper.

Delicious!  It seemed like it had a little too much whipped topping, so next time I'll try reducing it to 3 cups instead of 3 1/2 cups.

My family resists change and we've been eating the SAME fruit salad at every family gathering for as long as I can remember.  My cousin once dyed it green and she never lived it down.  This year I found this recipe.  I couldn't believe 28 people could have rated it this good and my family not like it.  I gave it a try and at first people took very small portions or none at all.  Then after people started saying how good it was and wanting to know what was in it, it went very quickly.  I've even been asked to bring it for Christmas!  Thanks for adding a little variety to our dinners!

I tweeked this recipe a bit. I added chunks of Granny Smith apples (with the skins on) and chopped pecans. Sans the coconut (no coconut), added sour cream AND whipped topping plus a splash of whole milk. Also had the mandarins, the marshmallows and the cherries. Oh, also I chopped up a whole, fresh sweet pineapple! Chewy, refreshing and good for you. I am eating a bowl right now. Goes great with homemade lasagna.

I like to subsitiute a small container of berry flavored yogurt  (the "thick and creamy" kind) for the whipped topping and milk. Also, toast the coconut and add it right before serving. Delicious!

This was way too sweet for my taste.  Next time I will double the fruit and halve the marshmallows, coconut and cool whip.  I added bananas and they tasted good, but turned brown as bananas do.

This was a very good dessert salad. My husband is a very picky eater but ate this with dinner and took it for left overs the next day!! I did double the amount of mandarin oranges the recipe called for because I wanted more fruit in my recipe, as is it looks kind of bland. I am sure I will be making this again.

This was good, but it had way too much coconut. I made it again without the coconut, added a pack of pistachio pudding to the cool whip, threw in some chopped apples and 1/2 c of pecans, and it turned out fabulous!

This was perfect as is- I like this recipe better than the ones using sour cream- I just added extra fruit and it was great- I love coconut so the amount was great for us. I'll make this again and again!
Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  I used 1c. coconut, instead of 2.  I sub. 3tbsp. sour cream for the milk.  I did not measure the cool whip, instead I added one 8oz. container, that was the perfect amount.

This was the BEST ambrosia salad I've had in a looong time. There's only 4 people in my household and it was GONE in 2 days! We serve it as a treat or dessert and it's great to bring to parties (I've taken to bringing a copy of the recipe when I bring it anywhere!).

This is a very good recipe.  I followed others suggestions and used an 8 oz tub of cool whip, 1/2 cup of sour cream and left out the coconut.  I also tossed in more mandarin oranges (I love them).  This reminded me of a recipe my aunt made years ago.  A big hit with my family.

I, too, tweaked the recipe... I didn't get the milk in it... what taste it would enhance, so I used some of the pineapple juice -as suggested by another reviewer.  I left out the marshmallows, too, because I was afraid they would make it too (artificially) sweet with the whipped topping.  It turned out pretty good, therefore it's a good base recipe for each to tweak to their own taste.

I have made this for nearly every Thanksgiving and Xmas for the last few years in addition to lunch parties.  It is truly a great recipe, tastes great and looks great, especially with the cherries on top.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

AWESOME, worthy of more than 5 stars in my book.  This is exactly the recipe I had been searching for.  I also added a couple of tablespoons orange juice after everything is combined.  It helps flavor the whipped cream and also makes the marshmallows softer.  Just heavenly, you won't be disappointed!

This was very good, and even better the next day.  I was a little confused about what to do with the cherries, so I ended up mixing them into the whole thing and they ended up being the best part!

This is a great base recipe, I had to alter it a bit for ingredients I had on hand. No whip cream, so made my own with heavy cream and sugar. After reading reviews, I substituted greek yogurt for the milk (pineapple and vanilla flavor) and then added diced apples and walnuts. Took it to a church dinner and there was only a little left in the bottom of the bowl, so I am guessing it was good, I definitely enjoyed it!

YUM! My 19-yr. old daughter made this for a family cookout and it was delicious! We've always used pineapple chunks in ambrosia but she used the crushed pineapple and everyone thought that made it even better. Thanks Didi!

This is what I have been looking for!  My Nana made this all the time when I was growing up and this is as close as I will ever get to it!   My very picky kids loved it too!
I hate cherries- so they go on the side as a topping.  And, since I have coconut hating people in the family, I make toasted coconut and too is put on the side as topping.

Overall- wonderful, wonderful.  I just add whatever fruit I have in the house (drained in a colander for an hour or so) when I make this!!

I will definitely be making this again.  I took suggestions from other people - used less coconut, less whipped topping, substituted sour cream for milk, added some pineapple juice, more fruit, and added green grapes.  I realized after serving that I had forgotten the cherries, but that didn't matter in the least.  It was gone in a matter of minutes.

Thanks that this base recipe is available - and many thanks for all of the reviews and comments - I prepared this recipe from the base recipe, but made alterations via the advice of numerous reviewers - i.e., doubled fruit, low fat whipped topping, sour cream vs. milk, apples, grapes, peaches, and no coconut ...... great dish!

This is one of my favorite dessert-snacks. I like it with less Cool Whip though, so I usually double the fruit and keep the rest the same. Still good with fat free Cool Whip too.

This was good, but really sweet. Next time I'll either cut back on the cool-whip or use some sour cream with the cool-whip. I also added cut fresh strawberries.

Excellent!  I have made this 2 times.  Once for a catering job of 75 people.  Everyone loved it!  I also made it for a Memorial Day cookout.  Before adding the coconut I put some to the side for people who do not like coconut.  Everyone enjoyed it, both kinds.  Will make again.

I made this recipe and brought it to a party. It made a big hit. There was a small amount left in the bowl and I told the host that I would bring the bowl home and she said no way, not until I get the rest of the Ambrosia. I really wanted it for myself, because I had only tried it after I made it. The moral of the story is THAT THEY ALL
loved it. So now this will be my favorite recipe to bring to parties. Thanks for an easy and wonderful recipe

My Mother used to make this very salad every Christmas and Thanksgiving. She whipped cream from scratch, but I like going the easy way. There was really very little difference in taste so why go through all the hassle? Besides I once made this for a family gathering years ago (with real whip cream) and forgot to add the sugar to the whip cream. Yuk. That was just one of MY kitchen disasters.

The recipe has way to much coconut.  Next time I would add only half that it calls for. Otherwise it's a very good Hawaiian Salad, my grandmother couldn't get enough.

Yum.  I skipped the marshmallows and cherries, but will try them next time--I bet they'd be good.  This is not for the coconut-wary, though.  I also used "lite" whipped topping, more pineapple (a whole 15.5 oz can), and sour cream instead of milk.  I'm sure I'll have this again before the summer's over.  It's keeping nicely in the fridge, too.

This was a simple and tasty recipe for ambrosia.  Very good.  Just be sure to use the finely shredded coconut.  I didn't, but will next time to achieve a smoother texture.

I tried this ambrosia.. I didn't care for it.... it tasted like just a pineapple coconut mix... maybe some apples or other fruits would have livened it up a bit. But it had a good consistency.

It's a good salad.  I agree that it does need more fruit.  I added some chopped apples and grapes and pecans for a crunch.  I also added some cinnamon and that pushed it over the edge into delishousness!!!

I had to add way more fruit than the recipe called for. I took a spoonful and it was all marshmellows so I would say reduce the marshmellows also. I did not use the milk.

Awesome. Didn't bother measuring, just eyed everything up to the appropriate amount. Can't go wrong. Only thing this salad needs is some chopped glazed pecans for crunch. Feels like it's lacking something without them.

Turned out just as I’d hoped. I added a small package of Cheesecake Jello Pudding Mix and didn’t drain the fruit. Flavor was nice but next time I’ll do half whip half sour cream.

My friends grandmother used to make this when I was little, but the only thing that was different was the mandarine oranges.  She never used them, but they were/are really great in it.  I think the only thing wrong with this is that it taste like another bowl.  I can't stop eating it myself!! Good thing I have friends to help me eat it!! Yummmm

Very nice - a great recipe that is fast to prepare and the kids are guarateend to love it. I usually serve ambrosia as one of the dinner salads (as my mom and grandma do) and there are never any leftovers. This one was no exception!

Perfect!  I've never made Ambrosia Salad before and it turned out just great :)  I thought that adding the milk in would be odd, but it just sort of thins out the cool whip and makes it just right...not overly sweet like in another review.  Thanks!!

This morning, I grabbed all of the needed ingredients for this ambrosia salad, plus one banana, and 1 cup of walnuts per the suggestion of one allrecipes reviewer. I had no idea this recipe was going to yield such a huge amount, but, no matter! I am so happy because there is so much more of this ambrosia for me to eat!!! As they used to say in my 20's,"This is The Bomb!"!!!  I have never made ambrosia before, even though I would always see it at potlucks. It always seems to be a staple at parties held by one specific ethnicity of my ethnic background. And, I would always turn my nose up at it, thinking it would be too sweet. When first reading the recipe, I balked at the use of the marshmallows, but trudged on. This recipe is sweet, but not like it will give you a sugar high. Once I had gotten everything combined, Wow!!! This was absolutely so delicious! The crunchiness of walnuts (or I'm sure if you use any other nut, like cashews) balances the other textures of the softer ingredients. The marshmallows are so heavenly with the walnuts! Everything goes so well together! Unfortunately, my husband does not share my enthusiasm for this recipe. I would absolutely love to share what I'd made, but cannot think of a soul to share this with. Didi, thank you so much for your recipe! Whether my husband likes it or not, this will be a keeper in our recipe file!!!

I absolutely loved this ambrosia salad....I ommitted the milk and thought it was a great consistency.  Next time I will experiment with fruit cocktail and pistachio pudding mix....maybe add a shot of frangelico to give it some nutty flavor.

When I make this I add sliced bananas and a can of drained fruit cocktail , omit the marshmallows and use a little less whipped cream. My stepdad always puts apples in his and it is outstanding. Our whole family loves it , even the kids . Its sort of like a fruit salad and dessert in one and you cant beat that !

Great Recipe! I modified it based on the suggestions of others-added 1/2 box of instant pastachio pudding, used 1/4 cup of coconut, used a can of fruit cocktail, and used lite cool whip.  I omitted the milk cause I was afraid it was going to make it soggy.  I will definitely make it again!

I made this for my sister's graduation party BBQ. My grandmother absolutely loved this recipe. I thought it would've been better with about half the milk (or less.) But, it's hard to go wrong with this mix of ingredients.

I'm not a fan of Coconut so I generally make two versions of this -- one with the Coconut and one without.  This is a great dish to bring for parties - everyone loves it and it's fairly inexpensive to make.

We liked this just ok, it could be my fault as I did not add the milk and I used pineapple chunks instead of crushed because I thought it would be too juicy, I was wrong it turned out dry. My suggestion follow the recipe as is .. the flavor is delicious

In my opinion:
* less coconut
* 20 oz can crushed pineapple
* 1 cup chopped walnuts
...will make it better
otherwise, good but i like the watergate salad better (the pistachio mix version)

Very tasty as a light summer dessert or snack. I like the fluffy texture of the cool whip and the marshmallows. Make sure to drain the fruit really well or it can get runny.

It was a little sweeter than I thought it would be (but that's okay--I like sweet).  Next time, I would add more fruit and use less Cool Whip.  I added shelled, sliced almonds this time around, and it really helped give it some crunch.

Classic ambrosia!  A great, old-fashioned flavor.  The kids didn't go for it, but then, if it doesn't contain five pounds of chocolate chips, they don't love anything.  Rave reviews from grown-ups though.

This was wonderful!!  I did as others had mentioned and added the pineapple juice and used sourcream instead of milk.  It was great!  I served it yesterday at our Easter Brunch and everyone loved it.  I made it the night before and forgot to add the cherries the next day (didn't want everything to be pink in the morning) but they weren't missed.
Thanks for the recipe!

This was a big hit!  Quick and easy, with great taste!  It is definitely better to add the pineapple juice to this mixture, it makes it SO much more creamy.

I  loved this recipe with the previously suggested additions:  1 cup chopped pecans, 1 diced green apple with skin on (both added a nice crunch and the apple helped cut sweetness),  1 (15 oz) can of fruit cocktail for more volume, 1 (3.4 oz) box of pistachio instant pudding, and I replaced the milk with 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I'm glad I used unsweetened coconut flakes and I would try toasting them next time. The  only part I'd change is I'd  carefully monitor  the ratio of whipped cream to fruit as I folded the cream in.  I used 1 (8 oz)  tub of whipped topping and my family felt it was too much.  After draining the canned fruit I added it all together in a vegetable steamer which I'd  placed inside a larger glass bowl.  I sealed it and let  the fruit continue draining overnight.  This helped a lot.

Ok, so I have to admit I just used this recipe as a jumping off point.. I have never went strictly by it.. although the outcome is great! I use it as a guideline. I remember something like this my grandmother made every Christmas, so this recipe brought back so many wonderful memories.. but enough said, this is the changes I made. I added about 1 cup of coconut (what I had on hand). I use 2 cans of mandarin oranges, I omit the cherries. I also use the fruit flavored mini marshmallows. I add 1/2 cup sour cream for a little tang. I also add small box of pistachio pudding to my extra creamy cool whip.

I absolutely LOVED this recipe. This was my first time making ambrosia salad. Based on other reviews I added pecans, grapes, and pistachio pudding mix. I also omitted the milk and coconut because I am not a fan of it. I had to force myself to stop eating it. Will make again.

I hadn't made this in years!  I use a large can of fruit salad in place of the mandarins, pineapple and cherries.  If you leave a bit of juice in the fruit, you can omit the milk as well.  I do it this way to keep it extra simple.

This recipe is a hit every time I make it.  I use sour cream and I also use the multi-colored mini marshmallows--it gives it an extra flavor.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Nice option for weekday dessert. I took a reviewer's advice, used the juice of the maraschino jar. My husband loves coconut, so this was a great option. Asked for seconds two days in a row! Thanks.

This is always a hit at family gatherings. I like to add a can of fruit cocktail to this recipe to give it even more pizazz. I include the juice and add a handful more marshmallows so it isn't too juicy. It's a regular recipe used around here.

I can't say enough about how delicious this recipe is.  Beats my grandmother's ambrosia... and that is really saying somthing!  I have also used homemade whipped topping in this recipe and it turns out just as well as using the whipped topping.  Deee-licious!

With or without the cinnamon and nutmeg, the recipeis decent. it is decent. why do the others want to add sour cream? makes it taste expired. this is great. I used 12 oz mandarin orange, 12 oz CRUSHED pineapple (better than chunck) 1.5 cups coconut, large whipped cream, 6 oz cherries.

Great salad. I followed other suggestions and substituted sour cream for the milk.  I also added 1 cup of grapes and I used colored marshmallows.    I went with pineapple tidbits instead of crushed and let the fruit drain for a few hours.  I used 2 cups of sweetened shredded coconut but I found that it was maybe a little too much. Next time I will try 1 cup of coconut instead.

I've made this several times.  it is my go-to recipe.  I can eat the whole bowl alone, over a couple days' time.  often, I leave the cherries out of the recipe and it is still fantastic.  thank you for a favorite recipe.

We liked this pretty well. We doubled the recipe for a big gathering. We made some slight changes based on the package sizes from our local grocery. We used 30 oz. mandarin oranges, 20 oz. crushed pineapple, 32 oz. whipped topping, 1 cup red grapes halved, 2 cups coconut shredded further in the food processer, 20 oz maraschino cherries. Use a very very big bowl if you doubled the recipe like I did. Reserve your juices and add some back before serving if you need it (I didn't).

I used to make this every year for family holiday dinners, except I added maraschino cherries and omitted the milk.  It was really delicious, and everyone enjoyed it.  The maraschino cherries gave it a pretty pale pink color.

I tried this recipe but it was too much coconut for my taste.  I would cut back to 1 cup of coconut or add an extra can of Mandarin orange slices and an extra can of Pineapple tidbits or chunks.

This was a huge hit for our family.  I did 1/2 cool whip, 1/2 sour cream, and about 1/2 cup of whipping cream instead of milk.  I drained the fruit really well, and it didn't get watery.

I love this recipe, too!  It's been in our family for decades.  I substitue the whipped cream and milk for one pint of sour cream.  I also add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts to give it that extra crunch!

I changed up the fruit to my liking but I would omit or half the amount of coconut.

Very easy to make and delicious.  The white ambrosia salad looks much prettier then those made with colored puddings.

Try using Pistachio Instant pudding mix, or plain yogurt if your not fund of Sour Cream or to bland it out a bit, think about what will level out the flavors before mixing. This should help perfect the taste we're looking for plus don't be afraid to add in pecans,if not almonds, or even apples for a little crunch & I'm sure a heaven sent desert you could only imagine! I'm looking forward to making this for desert tonight!..

I was dissapointed in this recipe, too much coconut. I took it to Easter dinner and brought over half home. Usually people ask me for recipes, no one said a word about this one.
