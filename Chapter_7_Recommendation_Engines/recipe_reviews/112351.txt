Sorry.... I didn't like this recipe. I think it was the garlic. I nornally love garlic, but in this case it clashed with the flavor of the squirrel. I think I'll stick to braising my squirrel in a can of rotel. The tomatoes and the peppers just make the flavor pop.

I used chicken legs because to me squirrels are not a food item, and leeks because I had no onions.
The next time I make this I'm going to skip the breading - unfortunately (as I suspected would happen) once the legs are in the liquid the breading gets soggy. Plus it really doesn't add anything to the flavor or texture. I would fry the legs without breading. Otherwise the flavor is good, especially once you add the bacon, which lends a smokiness to the sauce.
