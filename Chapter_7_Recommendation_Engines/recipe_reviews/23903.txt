These were so good they didn't last even 2 hours in my house!  I used raspberry jam instead of syrup and added a bit more cream.  I put one layer of dough down, then put frozen raspberries and blueberries on it, then put another layer on top and pinched the sides together.

The flavor of these scones were allright, but the texture was a little odd. The raspberries completely lost their texture and fell apart into little itty-bitty pieces. They didn't hold their shape when cut into the traditional scone shape. I am going to feel playing with the recipe because the flavor was somewhat tantalizing.

Great recipe! I made a few changes. I use half whole wheat flour and half all purpose, jam instead of raspberry syrup, use 2/3 cup of buttermilk, no cream and I tripled the amount of baking soda as mine were really dense the first time. All in all this is a great basic recipe that you can add to and make into your own.

This produced some nice scones; however, not as sweet as I would have liked.  My mother-in-law did enjoy them very much.  Thank you.

After I formed this very sticky dough into an oblong shape on the baking pan and baked it for 15 min., it still was very sticky when I tried to cut it in wedges; I left it in the oven for another 15 min and it wasn't anywhere near done. I left it in for at least another 30 min.  It's hard to tell when it's done because the fresh berries make it kind of squishy.  The taste was mediocre.

They're very messy to seperate when you take them out of the oven for the first time, but otherwise very easy to make, even with frozen raspberries. It will seem like they are not done at all when you take them out. They taste wonderful though, and they look beautiful.

The batter for these was extremely sticky.  I had to add a bit more cream (about a tablespoon) to try to make it easier to work with.  Otherwise, I made the recipe as directed.  They turned out very tasty and tender.  I think a little icing glaze would be great on these next time.

This is a great recipe. I use half wheat flour and strawberry jam instead of syrup. My boyfriend really loves them.

Good basic recipe!  I used raspberry jelly instead of syrup and I added 1 tablespoon raspberry extract and 1 cup of white chocolate chunks to the recipe and baked the scones about 20 minutes the first time prior to cutting them. Drizzled them with white choc and they were a huge hit!

These are great! Like some others, I added a bit more buttermilk and heavy cream; and instead of the syrup used raspberry preserves.  Also, because I had some extra left over from making orange scones, I drizzled them with an orange glaze.  They didn't last ten minutes! I'll definitely be making them again.

Very good as is.  After reading other reviews, I used seedless raspberry jam instead of raspberry syrup as I could not find raspberry syrup.  I served the scones with some more jam along side.  I think I would like to add almond extract to the dough (1/4 teaspoon to start).  I also wonder when they come out of the oven the second time sprinkle some mini chocolate chips on top so they can melt on top of the scone.
