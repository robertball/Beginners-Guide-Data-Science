This dish is so delicious and so easy to prepare!!  It was the first time I cooked scallops and they turned out spectacular. It reminded me of a garlic shrimp dish I order at my favorite Thai restaurant.  It would probably work good with fish and shrimp as well. Thanks for the recipe Ken!  :)

I didn't have enough scallops, so I added flounder to the 1/2 lb. of scallops that I had. I also added white wine with the fresh lemon. We thought that this recipe was delicious! Thanks Ken!!

Our garlic burned, and I think the scallops were overcooked, but overall, pretty tasty.

Just tried this recipe tonight (was my first time making scallops) it turned out PERFECT!   I used frozen Trader Joes scallops (sashimi grade), let them defrost for a day. Served it with sauteed spinach and brown rice. I'll definitely make it again.

Love how simple and yummy this recipe is. Came out great for my first time cooking scallops, though I was a little worried about under/overcooking it with the instructions.

Yum yum yum! We loved it. I didnt have any mushrooms on hand so I used a diced tomato instead. My husband said it was something you would get in a restaraunt.

Delicious! I needed a dairy free recipe for scallops, and this fit the bill! I used diced garlic scapes instead of minced garlic because I had them. Thanks for a great recipe!

I used a whole lemon instead of wedge to take more of the fishy taste away.  I also doubled the spices and cooking time.  I was afraid that 2 minutes wasn't long enough.  It turned out great!

Made this dish last night for my mom, was fantastic! It was my first time cooking scallops. I didn't have basil so I just omitted it. I also added butter to the olive oil. Mom says it is the best scallops she's ever had. Thanks for a great post.

Quick and delicious and ready in 3 minutes! I added 1/2 a yellow pepper and served it beside spaghetti done in a fresh garlic pesto sauce. Entire  meal time start to finish - 10 minutes.

This is a nice scallop recipe.  This was my first time cooking scallops; it was a nice starter's recipe that accented the scallop's flavor. They do take longer than 3 min. to cook, especially I think if they're a large size. I think I'll use more of the basil and garlic next time; I only used one clove for a double recipe and wasn't sure how much "a bunch" of basil was. Still, it was a nice, easy- to- do recipe that I'll experiment with again!

Very good.  The recipe wasn't exceptional but it was definitely very tasty.  I did need to add a little bit of salt to the scallops but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Be careful not to overcook the scallops.  I had a couple that were overcooked and they had no flavor.  I will make this again because the seasonings do not overpower the scallops so you can still taste them.

4 1/2- This was really good! We had no basil but I bet with basil it would have been a 5 star. I think it would also go really well on a salad. Yum.
