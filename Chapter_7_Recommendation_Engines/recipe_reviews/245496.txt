VERY good starter recipe!  I had no fresh turmeric root, so I looked up the equivalent in powder (which I've always got in my spice cabinet) and found 1 tsp ground turmeric = 1 inch of fresh root.  I served my chicken thighs cut up  on a bed of rice and the Hubs loved it.  I added pepper to maximize the health benefits of turmeric and cooked the chicken in sauteed onion.  Good stuff.

I used one chicken breast instead of a thigh, as written in the notes and liked this recipe. The amounts of seasoning need some tweaking in my opinion. I used 1/4 tsp of salt and found it way too salty. I found that 1 inch of turmeric was enough only to cover one side of the breast so I doubled the turmeric and added a bit of oil to the paste to help it smooth out. I then baked the chicken instead of frying it. Adding fresh ground black pepper to turmeric gives a boost to your health.

I used six chicken thighs, so I added 1 tsp of salt and it was too much. I would make this again for myself, as my husband doesn't like chicken much, let alone thighs.  His loss.

I had some reservations about trying this because I've never used turmeric. I also had to use turmeric powder since buying it by the root is impossible in my area. I did leave the skin on and it took a little longer to cook. But this was such a pleasant surprise! Such flavor! And the skin came out crispy. The meat was gender and moist. I will be making this quite often. We served it with a spinach salad. Thank you for a new favorite!!

This is a great recipe! My husband absolutely hates chicken and he loved this. Our seven year old daughter loved it too. I used chicken thighs and followed the recipe to a T. However, when the first few chicken thighs were done I did a taste test and felt that they were missing something. I used coconut milk fat as a sort of finishing butter. Excellent addition! Next time Iâ€™ll cook the thighs in coconut oil and add the coconut milk fat again. Definitely making this again! Thanks for sharing.

I will be making this again and very soon! It was so simple with a very high flavor impact. My very picking family loved it.
