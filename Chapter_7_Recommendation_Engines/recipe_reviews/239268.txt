I have made spaghetti squash with sauce before but never twice baked until now. It is the key to melding the favors and reducing the liquid from the squash. So thank you for that! I used a good bottled sauce instead of from scratch as in the recipe and it was still delicious.

Since I don't eat meat I skipped the bacon and instead added sautéed brussel sprouts, broccoli and green pepper to the sauce.  I also used a half jar of leftover spaghetti sauce in place of some of the canned tomatoes.  This is now my favorite way to make spaghetti squash!

Made this recipe last night and followed the instructions exactly. What a fabulous dish! We had this as a side with a roasted chicken and everyone loved it. It was easy to make and tasted divine. I did cook my spaghetti squash in the microwave for 15 minutes (pierced with a knife several times) instead of doing it in the oven. Then I let it cool until I was ready to use it.  I will definitely be making this again!

I LOVE this dish! made it as my first attempt with spaghetti squash (yeah, I know, what is wrong with me?). Always loved squash made any type of way except "sweet". So easy to prepare and I love how it retains the texture after baking. For those experiencing extra water, I do suggest folks allow the sauce to evaporate/simmer thoroughly. Already planning to have this again. Thank you, "NANCY"!!!

This is delicious and I will make it again.  I made modifications.  I sautéed an onion in olive oil and then added a 28 oz can of chopped tomatoes.  After it was heated I added some fresh basil leaves and the spaghetti squash.  Once it was all heated again I added 3/4 of it in a baking pan and added a layer of shredded mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.  Then I added the rest of the spaghetti squash mixture.  On top I added the rest of the bag of shredded mozzarella and some Parmesan cheese.  Absolutely delicious!

My husband cooked this, according to the recipe. Only adaption he made was to use ground turkey in place of the bacon,and fresh chopped tomatoes in place of the canned--basically a spaghetti sauce--and it turned out yummy. This recipe is a keeper and we will use it again, when the squash comes up for harvesting.

We are not big fans of onion, so I only used half the amount called for.  I still felt like there were too many onions for how much squash and tomatoes there were, but maybe that is only the opinion of someone who feels the way I do about that ingredient!  I also think more squash is needed to match up to how much tomatoes and sauce there are.  If I were to make this again, I would use 2 squashes instead of just one (and then also a bigger pan to fit it too!)  I have some leftovers in the fridge that I am planning on mixing with some pasta, as I think the flavors would go great as a kind of pasta sauce.

We have gone grain free and this recipe is perfect as a side dish or add ground meat/sausage for main course.   I did use a two pound jar of grain free marinara sauce with a large squash when I was short on time.  Also like to mix some cheese into the squash mixture and on top.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made it but used my own home made spaghetti sauce. I did increase the bacon to two strips. I sprinkled the bacon on top. Overall not bad...a little bland but Ok. It needed more salt and pepper. I will try it again...

Simply delicious. We are big bacon fans,so needless to say I added extra.  I used fresh cheeses which gave it a nice crispy top.  This is the first spaghetti squash recipe I've tried. It's a keeper.

I read the recipie and wanted to turn it into more of a main course, so I added 1 lb of gr. beef when sautéing the onions and garlic. Then I added a 6 oz can of tomato paste to the tomato mixture. I finished off the sauce with about 2T. of balsamic vinegar and the cooked bacon.
Turned out great as main dish.

Added more bacon & more cheese, than the recipe called for. It was juicy, so next time I may drain the tomatoes some, or find another brand that's not so watery or use fresh chopped tomatoes. It was good though and again kids ate it up and had seconds. Thank you. I will try this another day, since  it was not bad for a first try.  I think the bacon gives it an added kick.

I searched and searched and decided on trying this recipe to use spaghetti squash.   My modifications:

1.  I added a pound of ground beef. 
2.  I substituted a jarred vineyard tomato sauce since I did not have wine nor Italian seasoning. 
3.  I added balsamic vinegar to taste. 
4.  I used a package of bacon, chopped into pieces
5.  I doubled the onions since i did not have garlic.
6.  I layered by starting with the mix, then cheese, then mix and topped with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
7.  I cooked it in a larger, rectangular backing dish instead of the square style shown.

My husband loved it so much he finished half the pan that night!  Will definitely make again!!

5 stars because you gave me another side dish idea. I baked the squash just as suggested. I cooked the onions and half pound of bacon together. Seasoned with salt and pepper fresh garlic   I then took the squash out of the shell and drained it. I mixed it into the bacon and onion mixture with a small amount of bacon grease. What a great side dish!,,

This was my first  time making spaghetti squash. The recipe was really easy to follow. I would definitely make this again, but next time I would allow more preparation time, as it did take over an hour to make. I only baked the squash for 45 minutes at 375 to reduce the time. Worked out great .

Don't need to cook for 80 mins. Less is fine.  Had meatloaf with it, could be baked in, too.
