This pie is great.. My 18 yr old daughter like to play around in the kitchen a little and she discovered that she is quiet the baker. She has made this 3 times in the last 2 weeks. Needless to say her boyfriend & our family are the testers but, each time it truns out great. thanks for sharing!

Kinda hard b/c of karo but pretty decent flavor.  I added a big handful of chocolate chips.

I was unable to use the Lite Karo syrup since I couldn't find it, but I used egg subtitute, smart balance and some splenda.  It was wonderful.  I look forward to trying it with the Lite Karo syrup.

My family of pecan pie lovers gave this a big two-thumbs up.  I made 4 pies for Thanksgiving and this one was the first to go.

I had rave reviews of the pie.  There was one guest who normally doesn't eat dessert tried it and loved it.
