Good flavour, was a nice meal with rice and peas. I would suggest adding water as it cooked. I tried this and it kept the chicken tender and prevented the dish from being to dry.

ai'm editing my original review.
i now use only 2 teaspoons of salt, add a couple of springs of fresh thyme,and sometimes up the curry powder (if I don't have the hot Jamaican curry powder). A great recipe...my West Indian in-laws love it.

This recipe was really good. Easy to make and very flavorful. I didn't have the special kind of curry listed, so I used regular and just cut back the amount to about 2 Tbsp. I added Paprika, black pepper, and a pinch of Cardamom. When I added the water I also added a 1//4 C of white wine.
Family loved it!

YUM! But instead of browning the chicken, I put everything in a large pot and let it simmer for about two hours. I used crushed red pepper instead of hot pepper sauce. I also threw in some lentils as an afterthought. The potatoes cooked down and the chicken absorbed the curry flavor. DElicious! My husband, who is not a big curry fan, thought it was fantastic!

I don't want to criticize, but 2 tablespoons of salt is a gross amount.1/2 teaspoon at most should suffice.

This recipe is so simple and oh so good! My husband loved it! Just as good as anything I've had in any restaurant (even though it made my house smell like curry for a day)! I've been wanting to make curried chicken forever and the fact that I can do it so simply now blows my mind! The other great thing is that you only have to use one spice which you can find in any store. I'm not even sure the curry powder I used was the best quality and the taste was still awesome! I used sliced pieces of chicken breast and browned in two batches. I also forgot the garlic and only used two small potatoes. Next time I'm going to add in some diced carrot and more potato for extra veggies! I also added a little flour after I poured in the water to ensure the sauce got thick since I didn't know if the potatoes would produce enough starch. I paired this with brown rice and it made for a nice healthy meal. FYI...I see that some reviews say it was too salty. I didn't use the salt amount from the recipe but instead just sprinkled a little all purpose seasoning on each piece of chicken and that was it. I can see how if I had added 2 tablespoons of salt it would have been way too much.

I made this for my family yesterday.  I used regular curry and about 2 tbsps less than the recipe called for and only 2 tsps of salt.  It turned out awesome! I served it over plain white rice and it was very filling. We ate it up!  No more buying ready made mixes for me.  Thank you!

I made this dish using island spice jamaican curry.  As this was pretty much a small guidline recipe for curry chicken I added some extra spices.  I added a half can of chopped pinneaple at the end and some juice, tblspoon thyme, an extra clove of garlic, brought the salt contant down to a pinch, and added a full green pepper, and used half of a red and white onion.  I made some rice with a can of mixed beans to put the curry over.  this dish ended up being wonderful.  thank you

Simple & delicious. Made w/ Roti. If you really want to kick up the spice add dried Bonnet pepper, just a little will clear the sinuses. Thanks Danielle, moved to US and lost the recipe, now its a keeper.

waaaaaaaaayyyyyyy too much salt! I made this according to the original recipe and am pulling out the blood pressure cuff as we speak! In the future, I would use only 1 tablespoon of salt (the spices and garlic flavor it enough). Served over pigeon peas & rice = HEAVEN!!

I love this recipe!  The only change I made was throwing everything into a slow cooker after I browned the chicken and let it cook on medium for a few hours stirring sporatically.  It was wonderfully spicy!  The chicken literally fell off the bones!  Will DEFINITELY make again!!!

I've made this recipe 3 times since I found it a few weeks ago.  I usually halve it since it is just for me and I use either legs or legs and thighs depending on what is on sale.

I love that it is so easy to make, but I do make a few minor alterations to the recipe.

For one thing, I like my chicken to be "falling off the bone" done, so I brown it by itself first on both sides before I add the onions and garlic.

Another change is that I don't add so much salt.  I add about a teaspoon and a half of salt.  I just sprinkle it on top and then I add the water right over it.

Then I cover it and let it simmer.  So far I've been very pleased with the results.

This was delicious! I made a couple of minor changes..I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts that I cut in pieces, cut way back on the salt, added a couple of carrots and used chicken broth rather than water as the liquid. This is a definite "do again"!! Thanks, Danielle!

This was simple and delicious! I skipped the garlic cloves and added some green pepper instead - and next time I think I will definitely cut back on the amount of salt. Also, I used 3 tbs of curry powder instead of the called for 1/4 cup. Over all, I will definitely be making this dish again!

So good!  Felt like I was back in Jamaica on vacation!  I was using a different curry chicken recipe.  But, that one has been bumped for this one!  It was a bit too salty so I will adjust the salt next time.  Also, I used a tbsp of thyme and a tsp of red pepper flakes.  I also cooked it for an hour since I like my meat to fall off the bone.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe but, be careful of salt. I used only 2 teaspoons because 2 tablespoons seem like quite a bit. I also used 2 scotch bonnet peppers. I like my curry spicey! Placed this over white rice add some steamed cabbage with some fried plantains, now you have a real West Indian meal!

all the other reviewers must have been tweaking the recipe.   Too much curry, too much salt.  This is nothing like what I was craving when I tried it.

Excellent recipe, my dad is from Trinidad and it's as close to West Indian as you can get. The only difference is, I add green onions and bell pepper to the dish. I also add tablespoon of sugar to the oil and curry powder as it's heating to get the chicken to brown. It calls for water to cover the chicken, your potatoes also need to be covered. Add water gradually, to much water can take away from the flavor.

If you can't find pepper sauce add a scotch bonnet as it simmers. HINT: The more cuts you make in a Scotch Bonnet the hotter it gets.

This was simple, but very bland.  I added jerk seasoning as others suggested but that only made it hot, not more flavorful.  Other Jamaican curry recipes indicate that, rather than a base of stock, use a combination of coconut milk (1-2 cans) and tomato sauce (1 can) plus water to bring volume up to that needed.  Also, if Jamaican curry is not available add allspice to curry at a ratio of 1:6.

Brilliant.  Saved quinoa for me, as I was finding it difficult to enjoy the grain due to it's unique flavor.  I added a tsp of cinnamon and a pinch of ginger, and omitted the salt and used a half tbs of cayenne instead of ancho.  Thanks!!

This receipe was awesome! This was my first attempt at curry chicken and it was very easy.  I used boneless chicken thighs and sprinkled some Jamaican Chiicken spice that I picked up while vacation on the chicken 15 minutes before browning to add a more authentic taste. I also cooked for an additional hour so that the chicken was very tender...DELICIOUS!

Really fantastic, this recipe is simple and VERY satisfying!  As with any recipe, adjust the salt to your own taste.  Regular curry is just fine. For a little color, add peas or frozen chopped broccoli....yummy!

Very delicious. However I did find that there were a little too many potatoes for me.  Next time I will use a little less potatoes. Otherwise very tasty!

A very tasty chicken curry that was quick and easy to make!  I'll definitely be making this again.  I overcooked the potatoes but I won't make that mistake again.  I also cut down on the salt and added a little extra curry to give it a little more bite.

Very authentic!  My Jamaican husband loves it, and so do my fussy children.  We include some roti or Naan to sop up the gravy that I make from the sauce by adding a flour/water mix.  Yum!

Great recipe. I did not have everything exactly as called for, so I substituted what was in my pantry! I used onion powder instead of onion, and canned potatoes, and organic curry powder. I served over brown rice and it was delicious even with my not as fresh substitutions.

Just made this recipe tonight.  Followed a few tips from other reviews.  Used 2 tblsp yellow curry powder.  Two tblsp salt was a bit much.  Will reduce for next time, but otherwise awesome and simple!

This was very tasty, easy and quick to make.  I used Tropical sun Jamaican curry and a home made yellow pepper sauce a friend sent to me from the Barbados. Only used 2 teaspoons of salt. Everyone enjoyed the meal so much, I am going to make some more tomorrow.  Even the potatoes were nice.

So good!  I'm a stay at home dad and this recipe made me look like I knew what I was doing.  It was super easy to prepare, made the house smell fantastic and tasted oh so good.  It was even easy to clean up after.  I'll make this again for sure!

Hmmm...I'm wondering if the curry powder I used was the culprit (Cool Runnings Jamaican Style Curry Powder), because I found this recipe to be very bland. I know West Indian spice, and this lacked a certain flavour that I can't put my finger on. I'll try it again with another powder and see how it turns out.

Loved, Loved this recipe. Very easy to make, very flavourful. This is going to be a staple in our home.  Thanks so much for sharing. I did cut salt to 3/4 tbsp as others mentioned, but other than that, followed recipe exactly.

I had troubles making good curries lately and finally I found this great basic recipe. I did cut on salt like other reviewers suggested (I added 1/3 of the suggested amount) and it turned out perfect. I also added 1/2 tsp of each chili pepper, turmeric, garam masala and cumin. Instead of adding garlic during cooking, I did the trick I learned from my Indian friend--when curry is about to be done, fry minced garlic and ginger in a separate pan on little olive oil for 2 minutes, then add it on top of the curry. It really boosts the flavors. I kept adding (little) water throughout, and at the end added 3/4 cup warm water with 1 tbsp corn starch for consistency, because I omitted potatoes. I also stirred in 1/4 cup of sour cream and served it over brown rice. Yum!

Easy and tasty.  I chose to use boneless skinless chicken thighs for this recipe.  Really, just salt and peppered the chicken and sprinkled with a little flour before browning in high heat (preferably stainless steel pan).  Add onions and garlic and cook to soften before adding liquid.  I'm going to try cooking some rice in the liquid next time.

This was bursting with flavor! Granted, I wouldn't know authentic or not, just know this was yummy on my tummy. I used masaman curry, upped the curry amount and garlic, plus added fresh-ground black pepper.

Excellent.  Quick prep, simple instructions, great recipe.  Make sure not to add too much water, otherwise you have to wait for it to boil off. I also upped the curry and added ground cayenne pepper and chipotle pepper to add some more spice. An excellent recipe

It wasn't fantastic.  Everyone ate it, but the leftovers didn't get eaten.  Usually if the leftovers have to be thrown out it isn't something I'll make again.  It was OK though.

Super simple and yummy. And perfect for leftover cooked potatoes/yams. I had some cooked yams, so I altered the recipe by adding in the cooked yams and half a can of coconut milk (instead of uncooked potatoes and water) and simmering for about 5 minutes (instead of 30-40). It turned out super well! Definitely will make it again.

Delicious! thankfully, I was able to find dhal puri for this as well. I used a whole chicken in pieces and at the end I pulled the meat piece by piece to clean it to make a roti. I need to find one of those super spicy red sauces to add a few drops while eating it. Thank you!

I made as directed but WAY too much seasoning.  To save it, I dumped out all the liquid (such a shame!) And added coconut milk too tone it down. It came out decent. I feel like it's a good foundation. But heaven help you if you add all that salt and Curry! I'll likely keep playing with it and listen to other reviews next time.

Turned out really well. While making, I found a recipe for this from my aunt. I added rosemary and oregano also since that was in her recipe. I used Cool Runnings Jamaican style curry (found at Superstore) - and simmered for a few hours  on low. The sauce was perfect and the meat was so tender. I can't wait to make it again!

VERY GOOD.
Used 2 1/2 tablespoons  regular curry and 2 1/2 tablespoons
hot curry.  Used only 1 tablespoon salt but was still a little salty.  Next time try just 1 teaspoon salt.  Did not use any hot sauce.

I made this this morning using chicken thighs with the skin removed since I find them more flavorful. Instead of water, I used chicken broth and I did not add any salt. I had a baked potato in the fridge so I removed the skin and cut it into chucks and added during the last ten minutes of cooking. Delicious!

Really good, I got some fresh spices, onions and garlic from my local Italian market. I added heavy cream to make it creamier, and depending on how much cream I added, I would add more spices/seasonings. Instead of salt, I used a local spice called Summer Garden which is like salt, but definitely adds flavor. I didn't cut up a chicken, instead I used chicken cutlets which work even better. Olive oil also worked just as good as vegetable oil! Since I'm quite young and this was my first time making a dish on my own, it definitely took longer than an hour to prep and cook; but hey, it's delicious!

Great basic! I added all spice, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder and red pepper flakes, light salt n pepper. I also added butter to the pot. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts which I cubed and added carrots. Delish

This was great!  I enjoy Roti's when in the Caribbean and this is a great substitute when I am home.  A roti is made like this recipe with goat, fish or chicken and comes wrapped in a burito type covering.  This flavorful recipe can be used as the filling and is exactly what I love about Roti's.  I did use much less salt though.

Wonderful, thank you so much! I did not have potatoes on hand, so used two green plantain, cut into chunks, and since we like things very spicy, added one green and one yellow scotch bonnet from our garden, diced. Did not use the salt at all, due to health reasons having us really cut down on salt content. Great recipe and the perfect technique for a wonderful, moist chicken, thank you so much!

I love this simple but tasty recipe! I brown the chicken first, then put it in my slow cooker. I peel the potatoes and pop them in. I then cook the onions and garlic and add the Jamaican spice mix, then add some stock and poor it in the slow cooker. I  on high for 4 hours and the chicken falls off the bone. Delicious. Minimum fuss. Thank you so much for the recipe, it's a keeper x

It was OK, I made it as stated except for the high amount of salt... I used1/2 tsp.
To me it tasted like it was missing something. I did not have the hot pepper sauce though, so that might have been it ?

It was delicious! I would suggest adding water as it cooked and more curry powder by taste and I added fresh hot peppers. It's one of my fiances New favorites I didn't give 5 only because I changed a few small things. Great recipe :)!

This recipe is fantastic! I used normal curry that I got from a local Korean store, and added half a cup of it instead of just a quarter. I also used about 10 cloves of garlic instead of the amount that it called for. I tend to like things a bit stronger. I did use the amount of salt that was called for and actually just a tad less. It turned out perfect. Those who wanted more could most certainly add more, so I think less is a little better. In any case it was delicious and popular! I will definitely be making it again.

Recipe is very simple and very good.  I made a few mods (as most everyone will);
reduce salt to 1t.,Spice Island Curry Powder (because that was what I had), , replace water with 1 can coconut milk

Thank you DANIELLE2877!  I'm all about the simple recipe.  I can improvise whenever I want to add more "flash".

Agree with most people. Two table spoons of salt seems too much. Also, some of my potatoes ended up coming out harder than others. Cut them evenly but perhaps a little too big. I'd recommend half-boiling the potatoes prior to mixing them in with the chicken to make sure they're nice and tender.

I would definitely use the Jamaican curry.. it does make a difference. I added a few shakes of cumin, turmeric, and coriander after the curry. I used red potatoes (texture was great!), and I tossed in frozen peas and garam marsala at the very end of cooking. Serve over brown rice, yum!!!

This was delicious and simple. I did use regular curry powder, half the amount was perfect, and I tossed in some diced carrots. I let it simmer about an hour, and it came out perfectly tender and not dry at all. I stirred in some frozen peas in the last ten minutes.

Delicious!!!! Super easy to make.  Definitely simmer as long as possible.  I'm watching my weight so I didn't add potatoes - but replaced them with cauliflower and peas and it was so yummy!

This was an okay starter recipe. My aunt used beside curry, garlic and black pepper to seasoned the chicken. And she let it sit in the curry for a while. She also added some pumpkin, yucca and some other starchy veggie I can't remember along with carrots and celery, . It was almost a stew of a sort, served over black eye peas and rice (cooked in fresh coconut milk).  Yum, yum!

Great recipe.  I added corn starch to thicken the sauce.  Also, I didn't have potatoes, so used sweet potatoes instead -- wonderful and easy to make.

Very easy to make. I used regular curry, rather then Jamaican curry. I also add some jerk seasoning and cayenne pepper for a bit of a kick! Ummm Ummm, good ;)

This is a simple, easy recipe with great flavor!  Even my picky husband really liked it. I only used 1 tbsp of salt and added an extra couple of potatoes.
