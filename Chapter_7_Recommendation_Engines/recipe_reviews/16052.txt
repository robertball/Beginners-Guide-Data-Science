Made this one several times, and it's always a winner! One trick I learned to keep the layers separate is to pour your bottom layer into the pie crust first, then chill in the refrigerator for half an hour or so before adding the pumpkin layer. Also, as someone previously suggested, pour the pumpkin in over the back of a spoon. It comes out perfectly every time!

This type of pie has been a Thanksgiving staple in our family for many years.  If you love pumpkin pie & cheesecake, like we do, you've got the best of both worlds in this recipe.  A few hints to those who have had problems with this recipe.  Make the pie in 2 steps, after putting the cream cheese layer in the shell, refrig. until you've mixed the pumpkin layer, it will firm up slightly, & lessen the chance of the layers mixing.  Also, if you have the problem of the layers inverting, which our family has experienced in the past, we've figured out a definite culprit.  DO NOT USE PUMPKIN PIE MIX IN THIS RECIPE.  This is the canned pumpkin with spice already added to it, it will definitely flip-flop your layers!  Try a slice with a dollop of whipped cream for that bit of extra sweetness!  YUMMY!

I have made this pie for over 20 years when a neighbor made one. It has alway been a famil request. The trick to keeping the layered look is to pour the pumpkin mixture over the back of a large spoon.

This was really easy to make.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of cloves and 1/2 teaspoon of allspice.  I also put 2 teaspoons of nutmeg  and just poured the maple syrup into the pumpikin batter.  I also added a teaspoon of almond extract to the cream cheese mixture and doubled the vanilla (can never have too much vanilla!, what can I say southern families make everything spicier!)  I did wait about 20 minutes before pouring the pumpkin onto the cream cheese it was well set by then.  I used my cast iron pan for the pie and it came out lovely!  Thanks for the recipe!  It's great!

Everything turned out well until I had to pour the pumpkin mix in the pie shell.  It mixed in with the cheesecake layer, therefore it didnt have the layered look and taste to it.  Overall, I got good compliments on the recipe.

Really tasty and easy to make.  I don't know if I did something wrong, but my bottom layer didn't stay on the bottom when I poured in the pumpkin filling.  It pushed to the sides and bottom.  I took a toothpick and swirled the colors together around the edges for a nice design and it looked great.  It did make enough for two pies, I wish I had read the first review before I made it!  I will make this pie again, everyone loved it.

This is absolutely delicious!! I made it for a party I went to and got rave reviews, and several people asked for the recipe! As for the layers combining, I had no problem with that, even though I forgot to refrigerate mine while making the second layer.

Pretty good.  When I poured the pumpkin on top it swirled with the cheesecake below for a pleasing effect.  The taste was good, but not special.

I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving dinner, everyone RAVED over it, and my husband who loves pumpkin pie, said this was the best pumpkin pie he'd ever had! I had to go home and make another one just for him! He ate every last piece, and now said that when I bake him a pumpkin pie, it has to be this one!! I now am requested to bring this for our Christmas dinner too! Thank you for a great recipe! However, I did alter it a bit too, I used all spice instead of each individual spice, I used one tsp of the allspice, and one tsp of cinnamon, and it still came out great! Also, it takes about and hour and a half to bake I found too. So, thanks again! I will use this for many years to come I'm sure!!

I have to admit I was disappointed.

Not sure what I had expected, but this pie was nothing out of the ordinary - just some pumpkin pie atop cheesecake.

Barely a quarter was eaten.  Won't make this again.

This is one great pumpkin pie and very easy to make!  I used a graham cracker/chopped pecan crust (see Carolyn Rothwell's Pumpkin Cheesecake Pie in this section) and it was great.  Might just be my oven, but it took less than an hour to bake -- more like 50 minutes.

Followed recipe with no variations and this is one of the best pumpkin pies I have ever had.  Perfect twist on traditional pie and there is never any leftovers.

I made this for a potluck at church and it went well. I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the individuals and it worked fine. I also forgot to add the egg to the cream cheese mixture, but it tasted good anyway. Will make againe.

My husband doesn't care much for pumpkin pie - but he likes this one!!  Tip one:  don't soften the cream cheese like you would butter (don't let it get warm) - soften it by beating it with a wooden spoon while it's still cold.  Tip two: I had way too much filling for my pie crust - be prepared to make some mini pies in muffin tins along with it.  Tip three: I cooked it a bit slower and only tested the pumpkin part for doneness.

I thought this was a good recipe.  Not great but yes worth making.   I like to reserve the 5 stars for exceptional recipes.    I had no problem keeping the layers separate.  I put the cream cheese in the fridge for a while..

I am not a fan of pumpkin pie but everyone in my family is and just devoured this pie right up. They said it was the best pumpkin pie ever. I used cane sugar for the cream cheese part and brown sugar to give it more depth for the pumpkin part. I heard it was very creamy and delicious!

This pie was a hit at the X-mas party. Everyone loved it. The cream cheese on the bottom is a great surprize. Over all, it was a simple recipe. I added just alittle more sugar..I love this Pie!

This recipe has been a favorite of our family's for years. I was able to make two pies out of this recipe. I drizzled the maple syrup on top and also sprinkled crushed pecans on top! This is by far the best pumpkin pie I've ever had!

I just made this for an early Thanksgiving meal and it was delicious. I read one of the reviews that said they used 12oz cream cheese and so I tried the same thing, it filled most of my pie shell up so I could only pour about half of the pumpkin mixture in but that is fine by me. I like the cheesecake layer more. I also let the cream cheese layer refrigerate over night and I had no problems with the two layers mixing when I baked. I didn't add the pecans or maple syrup. It was amazing. I probably ate most of it. Lol.

Another trick to improve separation of the layers: only mix the cream cheese portion GENTLY. Don’t whip too much air into it or it will try to float to the top. 
Also labeling the pumpkin mix onto the cream cheese putts less pressure on the cream cheese.

I made this the first time YEARS AGO.  Like a looooong time ago.  I decided to pull it out of the binder and make it again this year for Christmas.  It was a HIT again.  My kids have asked me to put it in their recipe journals I am creating for them (when they move out).

The cheesecake layer was a little spongy. The flavor was good.  If I make it again, I’ll leave the egg out of the cheesecake layer.  Also, putting the cheese layer in the fridge was a great idea.

I'm not a big fan of pumpkin pie, but my granddaughter wanted one for Thanksgiving.  She also likes cream cheese so I thought l would try this. I doubled the cream cheese, but I  could barely taste. Came out nice and thick, not runny at all.

My mom got this recipe from a friend when I was little and has made it every year since. I have always been a family favorite.  Couldn’t find her recipe this year when I went to make it so I am very happy to a found it here. My only problem is that when I make the pie the top of it always seems to crack when it comes out of the oven any suggestions.

This is different than your traditional Pumpkin Pie.  People that don't really care for pumpkin pie really liked this one. I even had to share the recipe.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit!! after I poured the cheese layer in, I put that in the freezer while I made the pumpkin layer, about 15 minutes. Then I poured the pumpkin layer in over the back of a large spoon, and it was perfect. This pie will be a staple at Thanksgiving every year.

My pie turned perfectly  I put my cream cheese mixture in the freezer while I mixed my pumpkin mixture up and cleaned up my work space.  I also poured my pumpkin mixture across a wooden spoon to prevent the mixture problem others were having and the layers stayed separate like I hoped.  My problem is that I made my own graham cracker crust in a 10" pie pan and I still didn't have room for all of my pumpkin mixture.  I don't know how you could get it all in a 9" crust  I used the excess for tarts

My husband LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this recipe! He said it was better than his mother's cheesecake (no easy feat!!) and he begged me to make it again soon. I did not have the ginger, so I substituted ground cloves and added an extra 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I skipped the maple syrup as well. I ended up with a lot of pumpkin mixture left, so I filled my small PS stone baking oval dish with crumbled graham crackers and poured the remaining filling. Was a nice extra treat later.

This one is the bomb!!!!! Topped it w/a drizzle of homemade caramel sauce and put a side of Blue Bell Homemade Vanilla ice cream next to it. Good stuff!

I didn't love it. It definitely needs longer than an hour to cook, more like an hour and a half. It has more of a flan texture than pumpkin pie or cheesecake, which I didn't like. I don't think I'll use this recipe again.

definitely refrigerate the cream cheese portion for a couple hours first, was a huge hit, very delicioius, next time I'll probably add some pumpkin spice too.

This was just what I was looking for and it turned out great.  I appreciated the other reviews comments about chilling the cream cheese layer and pouring over the back of a spoon.
