this was good but I might have put a little more than 2 cups graham cracker in which may be why it was a little dry and crumbly. I would like the cheesecake part to be a little thicker so I am thinking next time I will make in a smaller pan, put a little less crust and make sure it's the right measurement. also, I was out of butterscotch chips so I used chocolate chips.

Tasty treat, but extremely sweet imo. Wondering if cutting back to maybe 1/2 bag of butterscotch chips will ruin the consistency? I noticed several reviews wanting a thicker cream cheese layer, so I used a 9x9 instead of 13x9 pan.

Delicious and easy. Hardest part was cutting through the hard crust and getting them out of the pan without the bottoms cracking.

I found this recipe and made it on a whim.  Butterscotch, to me is a holiday flavor, and the gold tone of the dessert made me think it might make a nice addition to the Thanksgiving treat table.   
First off, Butterscotch Cheesecake Bars is an easy dessert to make - no unusual ingredients and no difficult prep steps. I always appreciate no fuss, no muss desserts, especially ones that taste as good as these bars.
If you're a butterscotch fan, you'll love the way your kitchen smells while these buttery bad boys are baking.  The word "mouthwatering" springs to mind.  The best part is, the Butterscotch Cheesecake Bars taste every bit as good as they smell;  subtly salty, sweet, melt-in-your-mouth goodness in every bite.
For those bakers who are big fans of Magic Bars (that glorious, layered concoction made with sweetened condensed milk, baking chips, coconut, graham cracker crumbs, et al), Butterscotch Cheesecake Bars may pack the the same, sweet punch.  Five shiny gold stars!

I'm making these for the church's upcoming Christmas Craft & Bake Sale, Nov. 23.  When transferring them to another dish, a piece broke off for the cook.  M-mm good.

These are good; substituted neufchatel cheese, had to bake for extra 10 minutes (high altitude effect?), refrigerated after baking. I gave 4 stars rather than 5 because these bars are awfully sweet (my taste favors savory), but they did turn out pretty well. If I have too much of a sugar rush, I'll give the rest to the neighbor with a sweet tooth!

I am certainly in the minority because I did not care for these.  The crust was too hard and the bars were too thin.   Don't think I would make these again.

These bars were delicious! I used a 9x13 pan as written and to me, they had the perfect amount of crust to filling. They are not too sweet. The butterscotch in the crust made it different and added that "extra something" to it. They were very easy to make. I took them to work where they were quickly eaten and enjoyed.

Easy and really good.  These were very popular at my event last night.  A terrific alternative to the typical cookie/brownie. Follow the directions and they will turn out great. Regarding reports of a crumbly/dry crust:  I would suggest that you simply pour the graham cracker crumbs into the measuring cup and 'ever-so-lightly' press it down a bit, but NOT pack it in firmly.  If you pack it in, then you will mess up the ratio of dry ingredients to wet ingredients, resulting in a crumbly/dry crust.  That being said, definitely press the finished crust very firmly into the baking pan before adding the creamy filling.  Cut them when they are ALMOST ENTIRELY cooled, as this also will alleviate concerns about crumbling the crust.
