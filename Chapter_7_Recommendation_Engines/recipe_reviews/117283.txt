Great, but had to add in a ton more spices. Oregano, pepper, salt, chicken bouillon, parsley, celery salt, etc. I'm going to keep the remainder of the vegetables for a chicken pot pie.

This was OK, if I make it aging I may use sliced carrots the whole baby carrots were to large in compassion to the puff pastry it self, also needs a little more flavor I added black pepper and double the can leave out the diced tomatoes and still have plenty.
