These crepes are the best!!!  I took the advice of a few of the reviewers.  I began by starting with the bananas first.  I allowed them to cook while I prepared the crepes.  I used a blender to make a smooth batter, and I also doubled the ingredients for the sauce.  This is a definite keeper!!!

My husband and I loved this recipe!

I was looking for a simple but tasty crepe recipie and this is it!  I've never made good crepes before, but twice in a row I've made yummy ones with this recipe.

We don't actually use the banana part of it, just the crepe recipe!

My friend and I made this for dessert last night.  The crepes had a slight hint of sweetness -- we loved it!  Excellent crepe recipe!  Didn't change a thing.  Thanks! Oh, and I used a non-stick pan lightly coated with cooking spray; they came out beautifully.

Excellent crepes! The sauce was delicious but it was TOO DARN sweet and the butter kept separating from the other ingredients, made an oily mess.
Might try a different sauce next time. Will keep the nutmeg.

The sauce is divine.  I made this for dessert on Christmas, made the crepes and sauce ahead of time.  I'd like to play with the recipe next time, I had bought some praline liqueur that I was thinking about adding to the sauce.  Or hazelnut.  Just fine as is.  I sliced the bananas crossways instead of longways and folded the crepes into quarters.  Oh, and make sure you simmer/boil the sauce for a bit (longer than I did), it definitely thickens up and gets better.

Wonderful!  I made these as a treat for Father's Day and they were fantastic!  I added pecan halves (along with the bananas) to the sauce and it was PERFECT!

A great crepes recipe. We use the recipe for the crepes and fill with strawberries or other fresh fruit. They are just a bit sweet, not too thin or too thick and cook so easily.

I did not have half and half, so I used half heavy cream and half 2%. I used less sugar in the sauce as some said it was too sweet. In the end I sliced the banana instead of cutting it lengthwise. It turned out quite mushy and I hated it. However, hubby loved it and he said he would give 5 stars. I didn't, but I guess this recipe should worth 4 stars. Will keep to 2 minutes cooking and cut it lengthwise next time.

Mmmmm...delicious!  We didn't have any half and half or heavy cream so I used milk and cream cheese until it had a creamy consistency .  I sliced up the bananas and used the topping as a filling instead and sprinkled the top with confectioners sugar and cinnamon.  Not too sweet, just right!

This was the first crepe recipe I've tried to do from scratch. I just made the crepes part of the recipe and used other toppings of my own. The crepes were a bit sweet, so maybe next time, I will add a bit less sugar (but hahah this is sweet crepes recipe, so I guess it's a matter of taste and preference.) Also, the batter came out a little bit thicker than I would have liked, so I ended up adding a bit more milk. I think the batter is supposed to be more like the consistency of heavy cream, and adding the milk helped thin it down to the right viscosity. And finally, when I added the wet ingrediants to the dry ones, the recipe was a bit more chunky, so I spent a few more minutes breaking up the chunks than I thought I would. I would definitely reccomend mixing this one with a whisk (which I didn't have offhand.) to break up the dry bits more .

Perfect recipe. This turned out wonderful. I placed the six crepes on a huge platter and cheated with store-bought cream in a can. Presentation was mindblowing! I wouldn't cut the bananas into circles because I think it would be easier to roll up keeping them as halves. You want a nice bite of banana in each bite. We couldn't finish everything so I put in the fridge and just reheated one for breakfast. It was good but not like it was hot out of the pan. Next time I will experiment with already made crepes --that would be a timesaver for a dinner party. I used a 1/4 measuring cup to pour the batter into the crepe pan and it made six exactly. This fantastic and I cannot wait to make again. Thank you.

Wow, I just paid $5 the other day for a crepe the other day in NYC, and came across this recipe. DELICIOUS! The only problem I ran into was that I only used half and half and no cream (didn't have any in the house) and the sauce didn't turn our smooth and brown, it was kind of curdled...it tasted great but looked wierd. No worries, next time I will follow the recipe. Served it w ReddiWhip and Chocolate sauce. My husband gave it 5 stars!!

I am only 11...and me my brother and my daddy made this recipe for my mom for mother's day!  She didn't expect it to turn out that good!  She make basic crepes very well and she has a very good recipe but she loved these!  My whole family love it but we used a slight larger skillet ( 1/2) inches so we didn't use all of the bananas!  Also I printed out this recipe in Word and the first number got cut off and we were supposed to use 2/3 cup of flower and we used 3 !  We made dough!  Out of the dough we made cookies and then made the recipe again!  It was YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY and even my classy family absolutely lovved it!

This recipe was quite tasty but it was far too sweet for me. I did double the sauce recipe so that could've been the problem. Also the crepe mixture was too runny and spread too thinly.

Made the banana filling (cut into discs) with a different crepe recipe I already love. Very good, tasted like applesauce, only made with bananas! Instead of the half and half I used evaporated milk (to reduce the fat content) with good results. May try making it with half the butter recommended next time to reduce fat further. Instead of whipped cream I topped the crepe with powdered sugar.

I used the banana sauce along wit the 'dessert crepes' recipe. Delicious. I used evaporated milk since I didn't have any cream. I would use a little less butter next time though, the sauce was hardly sticky

This is a fantastic recipe!  The crepes come out perfect.  I've used several types of fruit (drizzled with honey) for the filling and also one of the homemade whipped topping recipes from this site.  Always a HUGE hit!  Try this for presentation: Place about 1 Tbls of the cinnamon caramel sauce on the place, then place the crepe flat while it's still hot, add about 2 Tlbs of fruit filling, another Tbls of whipped cream.  Fold in two sides of the crepe and place an uncut strawberry or banana slice on top.  Drizzle with more caramel sauce and serve.  You're guests will love it.

I am rating this recipe, simply on the ingredients used to make the crepes, minus the banana part.  I haven't tried the bananas with the crepes, but I enjoy using the basic recipe for the crepes, because it is wonderful.  I really like the addition of powered sugar, rather then white sugar.  My dad made wonderful crepes and this recipe has allowed me to make them, just like him, w/o fail!  
I was asked to make crepes for Mother's Day Brunch for 15 people. They turned out perfect!  I was even able to flip them in the pan w/o a spatula!  
We used different variations of things for the fillings (i.e., strawberries & whip cream, nutella hazelnut spread with bananas, brown sugar, maple syrup, sunflower butter and hazelnut spread, plum sauce/jelly)  Thank you, Thank you!

I loved these. I wasn't able to use all my bananas though. There wasn't enough sauce to spoon over them. I will double the sauce next time. The crepes were good enough to eat by themselves. Will definately keep this recipe!!

Since other reviewers said this was very sweet, I made the crepes with just 1.5 tablespoons of white sugar, no vanilla (because I was out). They were perfection! 

I also used fat free milk for the banana filling, slicing the bananas into discs and cooking to the texture I wanted them after the sauce thickened. So delicious! My husband even scarfed them down, and he's very picky!

Very nice recipe.  I made these as the finale of a fairly fancy dinner for a large group.  I made the crepes in the morning and layered them between wax paper and also made the sauce earlier in the day.  When it was time for desert, I just heated the sauce, threw in the bananas, and while they were cooking, I drizzled chocolate syrup on the dessert plates, rolled the banana up in the crepe, and topped with the whipped cream and sauce and a strawberry and mint leaf on the side.  It was absolutely beautiful, and a hit in every way.

Really yummy!  I laugh when I see the prep time though.  This recipe takes about 45 minutes to prepare and cook.  I also felt as though there was not enough sauce.  I only used two bananas (only two of us were eating), and we had just enough.

This was my first attempt at crepes, and they turned out pretty good.  I only used 2 bananas cut in half and then split lengthwise.  I felt the sauce could have been doubled...it only made enough to coat the bananas... and there wasn't a lot left over to spoon on top of the crepes.  If I make these again, I'll double the brown sugar sauce and may decrease the butter a bit.  But overall, I enjoyed these.  Thanks Jessica.

These were sooooo good. Like many people said, these are very rich. I still served them for my guests for breakfast and they all loved them. I had to double the sauce ingredients though because I didn't have enough to cover all the bananas.

great, as far as the crepe itself goes. I did not make this sauce as I had a craving for chocolate and spread and drizzled Hershey's hot fudge over the whole thing, and crumbled a wheatmeal digestive biscuit over it. The sauce, however, does sound good and I will be trying it. But this crepe recipe beats the one I was using before, so 5 stars!

This was my first time making crepes.  They were easy to make and very delicious.  I followed my friend's suggestion and used 1/2 seltzer water and 1/2  heavy cream.   I added Grand Marnier to the sauce because I wanted it to be special.  I also added Nutella before placing the bananas inside.  (Cooked on med low heat and kept it on warm while made the crepes).  I decorated each crepe with a tablespoon of homemade whipped cream, a mint leaf, and 3 raspberries. Everyone loved it.  I will try to decrease the amount of butter and sugar next time.

I am rating the banana filling only here. It was fantastic! Very easy and quick to make. However, I made the sauce as directed per measurements, I did use milk instead of 1/2 1/2, and I only used one banana sliced in thin rounds. There was plenty of sauce and I wonder if using 6 banana's would there be enough sauce? Eitherway, fantastic and will be making this again.

Incredible!  The crepe recipe was indeed a little on the greasy side so next time I will use less butter.  For the sauce I used whole milk instead of 1/2 & 1/2 and honey instead of sugar and it turned out divine!  My husband said they were the best crepes he's ever had!

delicious!  If you can find premade crepes this recipe is very easy and quick to make!  The banana is good, but I think next time I will try broiling the bananas with a bit of honey or sugar first before putting in the crepe.

Overall, good recipe that I enjoyed.  However, mixed reviews from the family.  My daughter loved it and my son hated it.  This had a unique taste with the mix of cinnamon and bananas.  But, after trying it once, you may decide to spend the time and your desert calories on more traditional dishes in the future.  For me, I think I will fill these wonderful crepes with berries and cream next time.

I made the crepes too thick....I didn't smear around the batter so it puffed up like a flat pancake.  IT was very good other than that, but that was my fault.  The filling was dilicious!

This tasted just like the banana fosters dessert that I so love at the Melting Pot. I did double the sauce like suggested in other reviews. It was so  that even my picky daughter said "Oh my gosh, this is soooo good!"

I just have to say I'm not much of a cook but I made this for Valentine's breakfast and I (along with my Fiance) were surprised at how well it came out. It was absolutely delicious - not too sweet and the flavors of the vanilla, cinnamon and brown sugar went so well together! Definitely saving this for future breakfasts!

This would be 5 stars, except I can't get my sauce to thicken.....great taste though. I don't add the bananas to the sauce. I put the banana in the crepe and drizzle sauce over....but want it thicker. Mine never thickens much at all. Any tips? Crepes are easy and taste great. Just need some help with the sauce.

This was awesome!  The family loved it, my husband even licked his plate!  I did add fresh blueberries to the sauce as it cooked then spread it over the banana's in the crepe.  It was so good.  I think I'm going to add a little OJ next time to give it a slight tangy taste to cut the sweetness.  This one is definately a keeper.

This was my first time making crepes, so probably my technique wasn't right... my crepes were slightly thick and slimy. The flavor of these was great, but I wasn't digging the hot banana mush too much. Guess this one just wasn't for me!

Made this for the family for breakfast this morning!  Recipe is easy and tastes great!  The only thing I will do differentl next time is that I will make the crepes first and put them in a warm oven to stay warm so I am not trying to make the filling at the same time!  But thank you so much for sharing!

Since discovering this my waist line is in serious trouble!  Used store bought crepes because I didn't have the time and patience to do fresh ones. Worked perfectly.  Topped off with vanilla ice cream as if it wasn't sweet enough already! (latest pic) lol. Great dessert. I've made it twice now.

I give this four stars only because I didn't try the banana/carmel topping so I don't feel I can give the whole recipe 5. But the crepes themselves definitely deserve 5 stars! They were so yummy! I filled them with jam and whipped cream and they were delicious!!! Great crepe recipe!!

We've been using this recipe for years now. It is a wonderful way to use up a few bananas that are getting too ripe. We also serve this crepe recipe with fresh strawberries (though we don't cook those).

This was the first time I made crepes before and they turned out really good!  I halved the recipe and it still worked out well and got good practice at flipping the crepes over in the air!

I gave this four stars only because it took much longer to prepare than the recipe indicated.  The bananas need to cook in the sauce for about 10 minutes before they taste their best.  Also, I would prepare the crepe mixture first, as the recipe indicates, but I would not begin making each crepe until the bananas are cooking.  This is a dish that needs to be served as soon as it is made, while the crepe and the filling are still hot.  Fantastic flavors!!

I loved this, but would only make it for a special occasion. I didn't have leftover sauce so ended up making a little more to put on top.

My boyfriend made these and they came out perfect!!!  They are very rich & having more then one feels like a sin. I just wish they had explained the method for pouring the crepes into the skillet. Enjoy!!!

I made the vegan crepes also on this website and just used this recipe for the topping.  Instead of butter and cream, I used vegan margerine and soymilk (thickened a bit with some flour).  What a meal!!!  It turned out deliciously!  I only had two bananas, so I sliced them into disks rather than slicing lengthwise. This will become a saturday special around our house!

Delicious!! Deffinately let the sauce simmer for a while... i was in a hurry and tried to turn it up for it to cook faster... not a good idea as the brown sugar clumped up... other than that this was amazing!! Had it for lunch along with some bacon for my fiance!! Oh another tip... don't use whip cream in the spray can!! mine melted right away... that or let your crepes cool down a bit first!!

Delicious crepes!  I first saw this recipe in TOH cookbook called "french banana pancakes".  I have looked at this recipe numerous times saying "mmm Ive gotta make it".  I finally did!  It was quite a sweet crepe and for me I think it would be a great dessert.  I made them for breakfast and they was a little too sweet for me that early in the morning.  I made half the recipe since it was plenty.  The crepes in this are amazing!  They were so good I kept eating them plain while I was making them.  Great recipe.  Next time I may add in some toasted walnuts and fill the crepes with a cream cheese filling along with the sauce.

Great recipe! I could not do the banana sauce, but instead I just put redi whip and syrup on it. To tell you the truth, it tasted like caramel and was just wonderful. Huge hit with my 15 month old son and husband. Wil make again, and next time with the banana sauce. :)

Yummy! I used a differenet crepe recipe, but I made this banana filling! I halved the recipe and used just one banana sliced into many pieces.  After the bananas were eaten up (quickly), I used the remaining sauce in the pan and a little more half and half to cook up another sliced banana. Everyone loved them!

I give it a five cause my family loved it. I loved the crepe itself but the banana sauce didn't find it really good, i added more brown sugar becasue I didn't find it sweet enough. I wonder if it's becuase I didn't add the nutmeg. Family thought it was excellent though and wanted for me to make it again. :)

Overall, I personally found this recipe to be more trouble than it was worth. If I did it a second time, even though it would be even more work, I would cream the banana mixture. The solid banana just seems to be too heavy for what is supposed to be a very light dish. I won't be making it again, but if you love crepes and bananas and don't mind a little work, you'd probably like this dish.

We had this as dessert and was wonderful.  I made the crepe batter first then got the sauce cooking before starting the crepes.  I follow the directions otherwise.  The sauce was wonderful but a little rich so next time I'm going to try half and half instead of the cream and see if that suits us better.  Otherwise, yummy.

I made the banana mixture first and added a splash of rum to it, I served them warm with a good quality vanilla ice cream, yum yum.

Delicious!  Next time try it with sweet condense cream with butter instead of brown sugar.

I had one of my sixth-grade students help me with this the first time I made it.  It turned out beautifully!  The next time I made it, I had an eight-year old help me and it was even better!  GREAT recipe and really easy to do!

These crepes were better than I ever expected.  only made the crepes - did not make the banana filling/sauce.  almost too easy for how good they were.  will make again (and again) with different fillings.

This was a really good recipe.  I had some problems with it though that maybe someone can help me with.  I halved the recipe and made it verbatem. I added 2 of the bananas to the sauce and it worked, but after I removed those bananas, the sugar separated from the butter and I couldn't salvage it.  So only 2 crepes worked.  They were awesome, but a lot of work for 2 crepes.  Does anyone that has made this before know what I did wrong?  I would love to make them again because they were so good but I don't want the same thing to happened.

This is the best recipe I have gotten off this website yet! I just made them for my family, and everyone was practically licking their plates! The recipe was seemigly easy since I am a crepe rookie. One tip, DO NOT USE PAM or any other cooking spray, your crepes will not turn out. I learned this early on in the recipe. Use little butter if any to use the crepes and roll the pan, they arent supposed to be like a pancake like my 1st ones were turning out to be. Supposed to be real thin, paper like. Also, I would somehow find out how to make more of the syrup the bananas are cooked in, this was amazing. Maybe double the amount of half and half? It would thicken up in no time. I will cut the bananas in halves then in pieces next time, so you didnt have a real long banana in your crepe. Good luck, you gotta try this, i told my husband i will cook this on Christmas Morning from now on. What a tradition!

This was pretty good. I too cut the banana into slices and used my own crepe recipe. I found the sauce a little bit too sweet, so next time I'll cut down on the sugar a bit since the bananas lend sugar of their own to the sauce. I did like the flavor the spices gave to the recipe. Definitely a pleasant way to begin the day.

This was pretty good.  I think you could add a little sugar and a lot of powdered sugar to the top and it will be a lot better. Also if you have ever heard of froxen custard get some with this meal.

Our friends in Memphis used to make Banana Crepes everytime we came over for dinner & when we moved away my hubby was always asking me to make them.  So, finally we attemped this recipe & found it to be totally EXOTIC & ELEGANT!  My hubby even said it was better than the ones our friend made - which is saying ALOT!  It's an adult taste I would say though.  My daughter did not care for them!  Just means more for hubby & me!

Delicious!  I made these for my fiance and we both loved them.  The only change I'd make next time is to use a little less nutmeg.  It was slightly overpowering in my opinion.

Delicious! Loved it!!! I used skim milk instead of cream and it turned out just as delicious! Aside: I would reccommend using VERY ripe bananas as I tried this once with bananas that had just ripened and it was not nearly as delicious.

I tried this recipe tonight I did, however, double the glaze sauce recipe because the said amounts are definitely NOT enough.  But it is absolutely to die for.  I recommend everyone get in their kitchens and get started ASAP!  :)

So good. I have never made crepes before and this recipe was easy and delicious. There really was no sauce left after cooking the bananas to spoon over the crepes, but it wasn't missed, they were plenty sweet. I did add 1/4 cup of sugar to the heavy cream when whipping it, but otherwise made this as is and everyone loved it. Thanks!

These are absolutely delicious! I halved the recipe (I just had 3 bananas and was eating them by myself) and only made one alteration. I'm not a fan of whipped cream, so instead, I drizzled dark chocolate peanut butter over them. Phenomenal! Definitely will make again.

I found this recipe very good but I do not consider this a crepe recipe because it was too thick and I did like it but this is more of a pancake batter. I recommend using Julia child recipe for crepes but if you really want to try this you will find it difficult to get it to be thin when putting in the pan. Flavor is good and you can try to use it as both pancake or crepe(not thin enough) but for the banana creme I did lower the quantity of the sugar and butter to make it less sweet so it comes out with great flavor but not overpowered with too much sugar. Highly recommend that you give it a try.

This banana filling is so good! And very easy to make, I especially like that I can make it in the same pan after I'm done with with crepes.  I like to top the crepes off with a dollop of sweetened cream cheese (a mix of cream cheese, milk, vanilla, & powdered sugar, which also makes a great filling that can be made up in advance or used with leftovers the next day).

i wasn't a huge fan of the banana filling but I use these crepes with various other fillings and love them!  The secret is the powdered sugar - it really makes it! suggested fillings:  nutella and a bit of powdered sugar OR cinnamon and sugar (1:2 ratio) as much as desired and sprinkle on crepe.  Squeeze fresh lemon juice over top of cinnamon/sugar and roll up to eat!

These were pretty good! The flavour was great but they seemed a bit greasy so next time I will cut down the butter or skip it all together.

I always thought crepes were hard to make, but these were not only very simple, quick and easy, but incredibly delicious! I ran out of powdered sugar, so I used granulated and it still turned out fine (I also cut the recipe half so there wasn't as much, I don't know how it would turn out with granulated in the full recipe). I only cut one banana in half, and hubby and I were both wishing I had made more, we ate the rest of the crepes plain and they were even tasty that way. I know I'll be making a lot more of these!

Good recipe. My bananas were a little mushy, I think I let them cook a little too long. Next time I'm going to try it with berries simmered in a heavy cream. 
Thanks for the recipe!

Ever since I moved to Florida from Pittsburgh, I've been longing for Banana Walnut Crepes from Pamela's. This recipe definetely satisfies my craving. The brown sugar sauce is a little too sweet for my liking. I think it will taste just as awesome with less sugar.

Excellent crepe recipe. The bananas and sauce was really filling and a little too sweet for me. But I used the rest of the batter to make regular crepes with jam and powdered sugar. AMAZING.

For one who's never had crepes before (much less made them), I was impressed with how tasty and easy these were.   Light, airy and just a hint of sweetness.  The bananas were a bit overpowering, but the sauce itself was fantastic!  These will be rotated in, but without the bananas.  Fresh strawberries, blueberries or other berries will be used instead.  Mmm!

This is so far the best crepe, I put in a bit more powdered sugar and vanilla extract for my taste buds.  I wish I could rate this more than 5 stars, it is quite yummy plain or with honey or cream cheese and fruits. We also scarfed this down with a mesquite smoked hotdog/sausage per hubby's suggestion, it was quite delicious!  Thank you for sharing this recipe! :)

I loved this recipe. The crepe part was delicious. It was softer and chewier than most I have tried. For the filling I didn't have brown sugar so I used Molasses and Honey instead and only 1 cup milk.

Loved loved this!!! I am a banana freak and this is soooo yummy. I used fat free half & half, and next time will try light cream. The only thing is, you can sparingly spoon sauce, so I don't think it would be too fattening anyways. Also I just sprinkled cinnamon sugar over the top instead of cream at the end. Will definitely make again...everyone else loved it too (rare in house of seven)! Thanks!

I saw this recipe featured on the main page and thought I'd give it a shot. I didn't have some of the filling ingredients so I used the basic crepe recipe then used whipped creme and sliced strawberries to fill them. The crepes were great and making them in the skillet was easier then I thought. They were not very sweet but my fillings made them sweeter. There were only 2 of us so I halved the recipe and that worked well.

I halved the recipe since there was only 3 of us and found that I needed to add approx. 1 tbsp. more sugar to get it to thicken.  Make sure to keep it on low heat as to not burn the butter & sugar mixture.  Also, slowly mix in cream when adding to butter & sugar mixture.  Then, it'll turn out wonderfully!!!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  One of the best crêpe recipes I've ever tried.  I ended up adding more brown sugar than you called for, and just guessing (not measuring) the creams and cinnamon.  It tends to caramelize on the stove at medium heat and creates a very sticky, but very sweet concoction...very good.

This is a GREAT recipe! I was looking to make some crepes and I had never made them before. I did only make the crepe part, not the filling, but I'm sure the filling is great! They were REALLY easy and my family asks for them again and again! I HIGHLY reccomend this recipe

Like someone earlier wrote comment, I much liked the crepes than the bananas. The sauce didn't come quite I expected it to be. Overall, it was nice different breakfast served at our home.

Oh my gosh!  These are delicious.  They are the best crepes I've ever tasted.  I'm a college student and live alone, but when I finished eating these I was compelled to get on the phone and let my mom know how good they were, and now she wants to try them too!

These crepes were excellent, though a little too sweet for me.  If you prefer a slightly less sugary crepe, cut back on the amount of powdered and brown sugar used in the recipe.  I highly recommend them.

Great Recipe! Made these for the family the other night.  Our picky eaters enjoyed these sweet treats for dinner.  Next time I might add a little more half and half to banana for extra creaminess and maybe some brandy for extra kick.

I made the crepes as-is but for the sauce I didn't have any nutmeg so I left it out. I also doubled just the cream (I used regular cream since it was all we had) and I let the sauce boil until it became a thick cream (I started heating it while I made the crepe batter and it finished around the time I finished making all the crepes). I also cut the bananas into thin saucers. Then I put the sauce in the crepes not on top. Yummy!!!

This was so yummy! I made some minor changes. I took cream cheese, 1/4 cup of powdered sugar, and cool whip and mixed them together until creamy. I put it off to the side. I did double the sauce recipe and added cornstarch with water into the sauce to thicken it up. I didn't have heavy whipping cream do I used 1/2 & 1/2 and 2% milk. Once the sauce was thick I removed it from the heat and put it in the freezer to cool it off for 10 mins. To assemble I took a teaspoon to the cream cheese mixture spread it over the crepe, added the banana mixture, and rolled it up. My kids loved them and they weren't too sweet.

Made this for breakfast this morning.  I added a 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.  I like the sweet and spicy taste.  

Talk about yummy!!!  Next time I will serve as dessert with a scoop of ice cream on the top.

The only reason I did not give it a 5 is that it's really not healthy.  I may work on making this healthier.

The taste is all there, but portions are off.  The sauce is sufficient for at least twice as many crepes as the recipe suggests.  I only used 2/3 of what the recipe called for with the sauce, and I felt there was still too much cream for the amount of banana, so next time I would probably only use 1/3 of the heavy cream.  The bananas I used had spots on them (so I wouldn't have eaten them on their own), which made the sauce very sweet.  I think cutting it with some peanut butter or Nutella would help and give a little protein boost to the day.

This is a great recipe. We were making crepes with another recipe from this site that called for separating the eggs and only using the yolks, but this recipe makes for a thinner crepe that's easier to handle. I use a heaping 1/4 c of powdered sugar. The banana filling is very good too. I always double the sauce, though, because everyone likes it, and the amount just isn't enough for six crepes. We usually only get five crepes out of the recipe.

This has become our standard crepe recipe and the family loves it (4 kids plus a husband is a lot to please).  Sometimes we use the banana filling which is yummy but we often just use different fruits for filling.  One time I forgot to add the butter -- I found it in the microwave after dinner -- they still tasted great but it was harder to spread on the pan.  Now I half the butter so it spreads easily and we really don't detect any difference in the taste.  We love this recipe!

My whole entire family loves these! This recipe is perfect for using up over-ripe bananas! Very sweet, but not overly so. I always make a 1 1/2 recipe for the sauce, because our family likes the sauce, and it reduces too much when we have to make a couple additions of bananas, so they all fit. For those who had a problem with the butter separating, I just used my spatula to sort of press and stir the sauce ingredients together. I never had a problem with separation.

First time I tried as is and it was good. I had to wait longer for it to be "done". Second time I just added couple tablespoon of water for 'lighter" crepes and cooked in a little bit shorter time. Also added 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract and filled the crepes with banana, cream cheese, and homemade "nutella" (hazelnut butter+cocoa+honey+shredded coconut heated up and sit for a while). I will continue to use this crepe as my base. YUM!

I'd give this one 10 stars if it was an option!  This is one of the best recipes on this site.  I made it this morning as a special valentine's breakfast for the family- served it with fresh fruit on the side.  SOOOO GOOD!  It was so easy- this is our new company/special occasion breakfast- more fun that tne traditional breakfast casserole, and less effort!

Delicious! Cut bananas in half cross-wise and then in half length-wise to yield 4 pieces per each banana. This kept the filling from getting too mushy. Next time I'll use 2 TBS of butter to wet the skillet, 3 TBS was a bit much.

All I can say is WOW!!!  This recipe is quite a treat!  I have made it a few times now, we like it better with the sliced bananas.  I also double the sauce as a few others suggested.  This is really good over pancakes too!!!

Very good!  I would make more of the banana sauce and keep the bananas cut in slices like most of the other reviewers.  My kids loved these so much they thought I was magic!

OMG!!!Soooo delicious!!!My mom just gave me a brand new crepe pan with mixing bowl for my bday and this was the 1st recipe I used. To improve the recipe, please add cooking temperatures for the crepes and bananas.  I made the crepes and banana mixture on medium low heat on an electric stove.  Thanks for a tasty recipe!!

The flavor was great, but I did not like the texture of the cooked banana. Next time, I will make the sauce and add the banana after it is done cooking.  I would definitely recommend this:-)

After seeing all of the great reviews here, I decided I best try them. So glad I did! They were great! I made the batter up earlier in the day and set aside the ingerdients for the sauce earlier as well. It made putting dinner on the table much easier and faster. My husband how is very picky, (and hates trying anything new) was raving about the crepes. he def. wants me to make these again. I will be adding the recipe  to my favorites collection. THANKS!

This is a great recipe, but instead of making the batter I use pancake mix in a box. I’d also suggest maybe a glass of orange juice with it too.

It was awesome! My boyfriend (picky eater) and our 4 kids loved it! I did what everyone else suggested and doubled the sauce! I also only put half the butter it asked for in the crepes. I did not have 1/2 and 1/2 so I used evaporated milk. I did not have heavy cream either, so I used about 1/2  of a cream cheese stick. I’m really glad I made these!!

I have an electric crepe maker so I made the crepe batter per the recipe, the crepe maker to make the crepes and the rest for recipe for the bananas.  I'm a widower now and I live all alone so I'm careful not to make too much.  I wish my granddaughters were still around because like me I'm sure they would love for me to make them this breakfast treat.  A keeper!

I have never made crepes before but always loved getting them at restaurants. While making the sauce for on top, I had to keep adding some heavy cream and extra spices because so much was sticking the bananas. Other than that, this recipe was spot on and almost all of the ingredients are things that I have in stock most the time. They taste great too, so happy I can make these at home now and not have to wait for the next time I go to IHOP or somewhere of the like.

Loved this dish, tasted like caramel bananas.   My kids and husband really enjoyed this dish.  I added a little more cinnamon and nutmeg than it was called for and I sprinkled walnuts on the crepes for a nice crunch.

Crepes we're very good. I'll make them a little larger than the 3T next time and will probably double the sauce.  Just to make it easier to cover the bananas.

Easy to make and delicious!  I cooked the bananas mixture first so it was ready to put into each crepe as they finished cooking.  I also didn't use brown sugar as we didn't have any on hand.  Reducing the brown sugar or omitting it may make it the right amount of sweet for those who feel the original recipe is too sweet.  In either case the crepes came out perfect and can be used with most any filling.

I am a student of Le Cordon Bleu! During a class we made breakfast food for a buffet. Being my first time making and tasting crepes. This recipe was a smash. No half and half I used whole milk and granulated sugar instead of confectioners. Use a thin layer of clarified butter to coat small pan then just enough of crepe mixture to coat the pan. I added Nutella to the crepe before the bananas topped with freshly whipped cream and sauce. Yummy

This was my first time making crepes and I am pretty happy with the results. I used a small egg-pan for the crepes, but I wish I would have used something larger. The batter seemed a little thick, so I added 1 TBS of milk.

The sauce was mostly okay. I liked the nutmeg and cinnamon. It was a little thick and the flavor didn't jive 100% with the bananas.

Made this for a holiday brunch. It was decadent. I did mess it up because the recipe is a little confusing. It says the add the cream to the pan but doesn't specify which cream, the 1/2 & 1/2 or whipped so silly me I added it all so it was too soupy. Lesson learned for next time

Enjoyed this recipe - quick and easy to whip up. I often forget about crepes and how fun they are for breakfast! This was a fast recipe to prepare on a whim using ingredients I had on hand. I agree with some others that the sauce is a bit on the sweet side, so I'd decrease the sugar in the future, or just plan to use less sauce (we threw some away, just using what easily coated the bananas). Also, since I had ricotta on hand, we put some in the crepes to add some bulk and protein, and that was good. A schmear of peanut butter (sans ricotta) was a nice pairing too!

FAN-TAS-TIC. after devouring his, my husband said enthusiasically "that was good, you can make those anytime you want". Really good. I added some cinnamon to the crepe mix, but probably not enough to be noticed. Single batch made 11 crepes (6 inch). super good, excellent christmas morning treat.

Super delicious and simple! There are no specifications to temperature, so I put it on medium to low heat. A key I learned is to make sure the crepe mix is very smooth and not clumpy so your crepes turn out the same way. I also used very ripe/browned bananas and I think they soaked up the sauce more then green/yellow ones. Unfortunately we were out of whipped cream, so I hope to add some next time I make these, which will surely be soon!

I really enjoyed this recipe, the sauce was delicious and the crepes were moist and delicious. However, I only gave it four stars because I had to add quite a bit more cream to the sauce than was put in the recipe because it reduced so quickly. I recommend you use mildly ripened bananas.

I substituted regular flour for rice flour, the milk for coconut milk and the cream for coconut cream. I had to let it cook more but it's a great way to avoid lactose. I also started with the bananas first and it all came out great!

I'm not a big fan fluffy pancake type breakfasts so I loved the crepes. I found the sause wasn't nearly enough and a little sweet but next time that would be easy enough to tweek. Will make again for sure! Thanks for sharing!!!! :D

These are delicious, but wayyy to sweet with the banana sauce. I may try the sauce again, but with a little less sugar and a different type of fruit. I'll try it with apples or peaches and see how it turns out.

This was scrumptious!!!  It was easy to make, although took a little time for the cooking and constant watching of crepes, and I will definitely be making this again.  I took advice from another reviewer and cut the bananas into slices (mine were about 1/2" thick or so) so they were perfect for bites.  Yum!  Thanks for the recipe!

OH MY GOSH!!!  Served these at easter brunch and they flew off the table.  I am so glad that I was brave enough to try them.  I quadrupled the recipe since I was serving 15 people, it was only 1 dish out of many and I had just enough.  Everyone should try this recipe, you will be so proud of your results!!!
