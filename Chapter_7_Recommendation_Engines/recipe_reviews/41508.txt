Pretty good, but STRONG flavored.  Better with crackers than with chips.

I am a huge fan of beer cheese and find this recipe to be quite satisfying.  I usually add crushed red pepper flakes for extra heat.

They are sure to list McCormick brand spices but they don't specify the beer?  Don't pick a very hoppy beer as this results in bitterness (the brewpub red suggestion is good because "red" beers are usually malty).  Don't use the major American pale lager beers.  The brewers want you to drink them ice cold so that you cannot discern the flavor (or lack thereof).  Use a beer that does not taste bad when it is warm (if out long enough, your cheese spread will get a bit warm and there is no good reason to ruin it with bad beer).  I used a brown ale and I liked the result but a Marzen, bock or Vienna style might work equally well.  I want to try this with a strong Belgian ale, too.  That could be great!

I really liked the flavor of this spread. I added a bit more pepper (and instead of using ground, I used flakes). I have to say that the spread was OK cold, but then I tried heating it up and it was GREAT that way. Maybe I'm just not much of a cold dip person, but I thought the flavor came through way better when the dip was served hot-- it's more like a fondue that way. I used a pale beer, and the flavor was subtle, so I'd like to try it again with a darker beer.

Have made this twice.  Good texture after refrigerated.  No bitterness as some beer cheese has.  For my taste, needs more red pepper.  Great recipe.

Since I work at a brew pub, I used our own Red Lager for this recipe, which turned out awesome!  Everyone at work and in my house loved this.  I even had customers begging for me to make it again.  Tried it once with an ale, and it was not nearly as good.

It was ok but nothing special.  Maybe I should use a different kind of beer.  I used Bud Light.
