I like the idea of this recipe but I will definitely make some changes.  It calls for way too much cumin.  That's all I could taste.  Too much red pepper flake as well.  I would use more phyllo dough.  The sauce wasn't good.  I just started grabbing spices and mixing them in.  I won't make the sauce again.

I liked this idea and I may make it again... I agree that there was too much cumin and probably too much red pepper. I added more filo dough to make it flakier and I liked that, I couldn't imagine it with less... And I agree... i didn't like the sause very much, not sure what I'll do differently next time. My husband liked it but didn't love it, didn't dive for the leftovers... I couldn't finish, way too much cumin so next time I'll do changes but I do think I'd try it again.

We really like this! It's fairly easy to make and the sauce tastes really good with the wraps. I've made it two times now once with ground turkey and once with ground chicken.

it was worth the efforts. i adjusted the spices down a little to suit the kids taste, and everyone loved it, even the sauce.

Too much prep for small reward. I made a different sauce, the recipe sauce didn't sound appealing. These take some time to make!

Pretty bland.  Sounded really good, but it just didn't deliver.
