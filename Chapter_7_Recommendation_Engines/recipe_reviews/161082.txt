I'm the author of the recipe. Add as much garlic as you like. In the USA, you may need more than specified in the recipe since the garlic here in Israel is incredibly strong and potent. 

To the person who "knows" authentic chummus b/c you ate it at a few restaurants in Israel and Greece... um, well, which restaurants? Because unless you were eating in a restaurant that specialized in chummus, you were eating industrialized chummus--which is kind of like eating spaghetti at Sabarro (sp?) and saying that you know authentic Italian cuisine.

Chummus is an art here and you've got to know where to go to find the good stuff. I'm not saying this recipe parallels Abu Chasan or Bahadonas, but for homemade chummus, it's pretty good.

Delicious!!! For the Americans who can't do without garlic here is another way to add it without overpowering your hummus with it: In the last 5 minutes of your boiling water with beans add some whole cloves of garlic in the water and let them boil with your beans. Add them in the blender with the rest of your ingredients, and bon appetit!

Finally! I went to Israel on a tour in 2006 and ate hummus every chance I had. Since then I have not found a recipe or store brand that I thought was close to authentic. This is fabulous. It is so creamy and mild, and my husband is glad that I don't smell like garlic! The cumin gives it a good flavor and I added just a dash of cayenne to give a little kick. Cooking the dry beans instead of using canned also makes this a much fresher tasting dish. Thanks. Now if I could only find some fresh pita bread!

This recipe was not authentic at ALL!  I had hummus in several restaurants in Israel and Greece and none of them had the cumin in them.  If you're looking for "authentic", then DON'T try this recipe!

Excellent recipe and very authentic. I am Lebanese and the cumin makes it much more like the genuine hummus I had as a kid. Perfect!

This is almost the same recipe I have used for years. Shown how to make by a friend as my family members did not make this.  Home cooked beans are far superior to canned and much more economical. Homemade hummus (or just about anything homemade for that matter) is superior to any pre-made full of preservative thing you buy at the store. To those of you who have commented that the texture is coarse, either your beans are not cooked enough and/or you have not blended the hummus long enough, at 5 minutes in my high powered blender it is smooth, silky and fluffy. Blend, puree or process until you have the correct texture! Cumin is an authentic Near and Middle Eastern seasoning, garlic if used it is just a whisper. Remember this is not an American grocery store clone. This is the real stuff, probably a recipe passed from an elder relative to a younger one, including the most special ingredient of all, love! So if you must, add the whole bulb of garlic,  roasted red pepper or  a hot pepper or two, more or less tahini and lemon juice or whatever else you want to, make it with love and then it will be authentic to you and your family. Oh I almost forgot, my favorite way to eat it is warm on freshly baked, homemade pita bread or soft lavosh, some nice salty cured olives on the side! Yum!!!!!!

Every middle easterner knows hummus isn't real hummus without garlic, it's essential. Mince a few cloves to this recipe and you'll love it.

The texture is amazing. Absolutely genuine flavors however when cooking my beans I threw in a couple crushed garlic cloves that kicked up the flavor just enough to give a plain cracker some taste if you're not eating it with pita bread. Goes great with apples, pretzels, bagel, sandwich spread EVERYTHING!

I guess I just hate "authentic hummus." I made a larger quantity of this for a group event (everyone loves hummus), and nobody cared for it. I took it home, added a lot of minced garlic and some Tony Chachere's seasoning, and it was all but gone the next day.

The perfect hummus recipe!  Thanks for posting this recipe.  This hummus was very creamy and delicious.  I followed the exact recipe except that I used canned chickpeas instead of fresh.  I used one can of chickpeas, reserving half of the liquid in the can to use in the hummus.  I also halved the rest of the ingredients, but used only 1/3 cup of the tahini.  Very yummy.  
If you like garlic, go ahead and add a few cloves, but I found that this recipe doesn't need the garlic.

I was craving good hummus and this was easy to make.  I used 2 15 oz. cans of garbanzo beans drained and rinsed.  I added about 6 cloves of minced garlic and ended up adding abaout 1/2 cup warm water total and a little more than 1/2 cup of evoo and this gave it just the right consistency. Otherwise I followed the rest of the directions.   My daughters loved it.  Thanks for the recipe

I really liked it.  Dried garbanzo beans are a lot less expensive so I was happy to find a recipe that explained how to cook them.  Personally I like garlic so I added quite a bit.  Also used cumin seeds since that's what I had on hand.  Great recipe.  thanks for sharing.

This is good, but a little too much tahini and oil for my taste; I cut down to 1/2 cup and 1/3 cup respectively, and added more lemon juice.  My hummus ALWAYS comes out light and creamy.  Do not use a blender - use a food processor.  Even better, use a vitamix and a whole peeled lemon :)    I add black pepper and fresh cilantro near the end and pulse just a few times.   Roasted red pepper is nice too.  If I want it spicy, I will add cayenne pepper.

Absolutely the BEST hummus I've ever tasted! No alterations made. Took the author's suggestion of adding lemon juice according to one's preference. I'll definitely make this again! However, I would use a food processor instead of the blender. (on the garlic comment-when I have been to any Mediterranean restaurants, no garlic is added to the hummus)

I'm Arab. This recipe was good except for the lack of garlic and thickness. Now if you don't like garlic, then you'd like this. But if you do then it's almost essential in hummus. Add some water to water it down a bit or you might have to eat it with a knife and fork! Overall, good recipe.

The recipe is a good basic hummous. I like to put a bay leaf in when I cook the beans (never canned). Its actually traditional to serve additional tehina (diluted with water to form a sauce) on top of the hummous, with olive oil and colorful spices such as paprika for decoration. Many people also garnish with olives, hot sauce, or if you want to make a meal out of it, ful (cooked fava beans).   ps Hummous is not low quality Italian food where you douse it with garlic. It should convey the creamy nutty flavor of chickpeas and sesame. Just a bit is good imho.

I made four hummus recipes yesterday and this one was almost unanimously chosen as the least favorite. Choose the Extra Easy Hummus or the Authentic Kicked-up Syrian hummus instead.

This was simple and easy to make - And WOW did it make a LOT - but a little bland for my tastes. I prepared as directed but added garlic while boiling, a little more than 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice and sea salt. Rather than top with olive oil, I lightly dusted it with paprika (wish I would have had smoked) and it turned out great. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I liked the hummus and found it yummy with homemade pita chips.  However, this is not a blender recipe.  You need a food processer.  And I found the olive oil a bit overpowering.  Fresh, high quality olive oil is essential.  Maybe mine wasn't fresh enough, or high quality enough.  And I didn't end up using it all.

I enjoyed this recipe but found it really hard to get a good consistency in a blender.  It's probably best to puree the cooked chickpeas in batches.

Ive been trying several hummus recipes for the last year or so and I finally found the one.. I tweaked the lemon and garlic amounts a little bit to my taste but this recipe is spot on. Thank you!

To the author of the recipe: It sounds like you know your stuff and Im wondering if you have any suggestions on things to add. Im not sure if its the american version of hummus that adds things such as roasted peppers, sun dried tomatoes, etc. but I would love to hear any suggestions from someone who really knows the culture. Please let me know!!!

SUPER YUMMY!! I just got back from a trip to the Middle East and had to try to replicate the amazing hummus I experienced while I was there.  This recipe is not only easy, it is GREAT!  I was hungry so I used organic canned beans, but the result was so good I can only imagine how awesome it would be with freshly cooked beans.

VERY good!  however, know that 3 cups of beans makes a LOT of hummus!  for appetizer portions, it makes enough for like, about 75 people!!!  I took it to 2 different parties and gave lots away. (I didn't know you could freeze it or I would have done that).

Yum, yum, YUM! This was absolutely perfect, a faithful version of real hummus. I only wish I'd frozen half (or more), as this does make a HUGE amount. Love this.

I have made authentic Hummus for 30+ years and it does not and never should have oil IN the recipe nor does it have cumin in it (although some do add it as a personal preference). The oil goes on TOP after it is plated. If you find the texture too course just cook the beans a little longer and process a little longer as well.

THANK YOU for providing an authentic hummus recipe that does not used canned beans!  I thought I would have to look elsewhere for a good recipe since it seemed that every one on this site was using canned chickpeas.  This is a delicious hummus as written but can absolutely be adjusted with whatever spices/ingredients you wish to add to make it your own.  Bravo!

If you are looking for good hummus that is somewhat similar to the store or restaurant, I recommend just giving up.  I will never try making hummus again.  I tried SO HARD. I used almost two cups of water for half a recipe, I followed the recipe and even added extra.  Although it was a thick paste (how is this possible after adding all the water and pureeing for 45 minutes??) I decided not to toss the batch, although my husband recommended it. It was only edible after adding a lot of oil, seasoning salt and I actually added milk. This got good reviews, but I am not sure why!!!!

My taste buds must be adapapted to the American version with garlic. I was not crazy about it. The tahini flavor came through more than I would have preferred as well. I did add more lemon juice and a generous amount of salt as I used dried beans instead of canned. I don't think it is a bad recipe - I just think it comes down to preference.

my first time making homemade hummus, this is so easy and very good.  I think the cumin gives this recipe something special that I don't usually find in hummus.  so delicious, I will make this again, although it will be awhile as this makes a TON!  thanks for sharing!

This was a good recipe yet it definitely was more simple as far as flavor goes. So, this recipe is perfect if thats what you are looking for. When I made it I found that it really had a tahini nutty kick to it, so continually adding lemon juice to taste was KEY, as well as adding salt to taste.

This recipe was really good but it is missing one key ingredient!  GARLIC!  Maybe it's the American way, but without Garlic this recipe is blah!!  I tried it first without the garlic, then returned it to my mixer and added about 5 cloves of it.  Now that's yummy!

I love this recipe and it is very similar to the recipe given to me by the local restaurant although a they use a little more cumin and garlic. Not a fan of chilli myself but many people here add a little chilli powder just before serving. As we have lived in Greece for the last seven years, I do not understand the comment from Robin H that it is not authentic. Barbara

This hummus was different than others I have tried. It didnt have that salty canned bean after taste. I made 1/2 recipe and it really does make a TON! I am not a big fan of hummus, but had some dried chickpeas and soybeans I bought some time ago for a recipe I never made. The mix was mostly chickpeas, so I decided to try this. I cooked them with a carrot, small onion, and a 1/2 packet no sodium broth powder. I reserved 1/4 cup of the broth and used that. The vegetables were non detectable in the hummus. Instead of the dip being thick and pasty, it had a whipped airy texture. Note, have a very strong food processor or blender, because there is a lot of dip to blend. It did thicken up some after 24 hour refrigeration. I stirred in a little olive and garlic salt and served with Cedar brand flat bread. This was the freshest tasting hummus I have ever tried. I am not a big hummus eater, but would recommend this recipe to anyone wanting a recipe for hummus that has more time.

It was a good recipe, I thought I could get away without skinning the chickpeas, as it is pretty tedious work, and I thought maybe the baking soda would help disintegrate the skin, as I've read, but really I just know the end taste of Hummus where the skins have been removed and where the skins haven't... This recipe would be even better if the skins were peeled, also, not sure what the cumin added, never used it before, and couldn't really pinpoint if it was actually needed at all..

The secret is the cooked and NOT CANNED garbanzo beans. What I did was cook 6 cups of dried garbanzo beans, used half and stored the rest in the fridge (or I could have used the freezer but this recipe turned so good that I will soon make some more). By the evening only about a tablespoon was left cause I was so happy with how it turned, I shared most of it with friends, family and neighbors!

found the tahini to be overpowering, so will just use 1/4 cup next time and add more to taste.

Great basic recipe. There is definitely a difference between canned and dried beans that you have to pre-cook, with the latter being the best choice. I have had hummus in Israel and Jordan and various middle eastern restaurants in NYC and I still can't find one that compares but this comes pretty close

This is really authentic!!  
I had made a recipe for hummus from the Austin Spa that just didn't taste good at all - so I was cautious about trying my hand at this again.  I didn't alter the recipe at all and we really liked it!
Thanks

Great recipe.  As an American, I was pretty skeptical about losing the garlic, but the result was a refreshing change of pace from the hummus I'm used to.  I've even gotten lazy and used canned chickpeas with this.  The result, while admittedly not as good, was still quite nice.

Easy to make using the dry beans.  I did add more lemon juice and garlic to taste.

Used 2 dry cups of beans instead of 3. Soaked beans 2 nights instead of one, changed water and quick boiled before simmering for 1.5 hours. Definitely recommend the baking soda pinch, brings out so much more foam. Added hot water midway through the simmer, as water got too shallow.  Used same tahini sauce from the first time I made it. Beans were SO soft, and overall the hummus came out SO much smoother, nearly perfect like what you'd buy packaged at the grocery store.

This was delicious.  My family loved it! I made as directed with one change.  I added a 1/4 tsp of ginger/tumeric mix which added flavor and color.  I will add red pepper flakes next time for a bit of heat.  Will be making this often.  Thanks for posting.

I had to add water because it thickened too much in the mixer but turned out great. Will throw a jalepeno into it next try.

Loved this indeed! I’ve been trying to find a recipe that isn’t overpowered by garlic. In this one, you get the taste of chickpeas and slight hints of all the other flavors. I used the baking soda. I live in a hard water area and find that it helps soften it. Thank you for the recipe.

Excellent recipe!  We made this with a potato masher and no blender to keep the texture a bit more rustic.   Definitely taste it and adjust garlic, salt, etc, to taste once the flavors have had time to meld.  The dry beans make a huge difference.  They are very nutty and lend a nice firm bite.   I love the cumin addition--I'd never seen that before!   Thanks for a beautiful recipe!

Not a lot of flavor.  I have to ask my sister and her Egyptian in-laws why their hummus is so much more flavorful.  More garlc? More tahini?

Nothing against this specific recipe: All recipes I could find on hummus were about the same.  

Surprisingly, I think one of the problems was using home-cooked chick peas.  The chick peas held their flavor, so the hummus tasted like beans.  I learned to make my own chick peas in anything where the chick peas are prominent and one wants a strong taste, like salads.  I would also rub the chick peas around in my hands to get the skins off because they made the final product too lumpy.

Absolutely wonderful   We had trouble with using a blender because with just the beans it was too dry.  We ended up adding some oil, the lemon juice, water and the tahini before we could get it to work.  It needed a lot of salt, just FYI.  But it turned out perfect.

This recipe was the best homemade one I have found.  I did end up having to add quite a bit of water to make it smoother, but it was so worth it! The recipes makes a lot, so next time I'll just make a half recipe.

This was tasty and very mild in flavor. I would probably use it as a base and add stuff to it, like roasted pepper or more cumin. I had to add more lemon juice a few times to make it taste good to me, but that's probably a personal taste. The only thing I didn't really like was that the flavor of the extra-virgin olive oil was a bit overwhelming. Next time I'll just use light olive oil or sunflower oil. I love how easy the recipe is and I'm so happy that I can now make my own hummus at home! 
P.S. Didn't need more garlic in my opinion!

I used 4 cans of chickpeas, reserved some of the liquid from the cansa and 1/4 cup of tahini, 2 cloves of garlic, and then seasoned with lemon and cumin and salt. Super creamy and delicious. Thank you!

love the recipe and the Israeli friends i had for dinner loved it too. a couple of tweaks/suggestions:
-- 3 cups of dried garbanzo made a TON of hummus. recommend starting with one cup until you figure out what you're doing and how much you need
-- i boiled the garbanzos with a couple of cloves of garlic. after pureeing them and leaving the hummus in the fridge overnight it had an amazing flavor!
-- i also used zaatar sprinkled on top when i served, which kicked it up a notch

Can't wait to make this again!

I used maybe half of the garbanzo beans and froze  the rest. I didn't add cumin or garlic because I didn't have any and I added 1 cup sesame seeds because I can't get enough of them!  I think subtracted some olive oil, not by much. This recipe is great for basic hummus and you can always add whatever you want, for diversity.

I'm sure that if I had the right equipment, my life would've been much easier making this hummus (or any hummus).  I read comments about using blenders or food processors, and I agree that a food processor--a big one--should be used to get the right creaminess at the end.  I used a small processor to begin with, but it didn't do much good.  I then tried a blender--didn't work at all.  I switched to a hand mixer, which got it almost right--but then I put it back into the small processor in batches to get it all together.  For the actual results, I felt like I was a mad scientist trying to figure out the amount of garlic, lemon juice, olive oil, and tahini to mix in order to get it to the flavor I liked.  I read so many other reviews about adding more garlic, so I also added more minced garlic.  For garlic lovers, it's great.  I also read that the recipe called for too much olive oil.  I personally felt like I didn't have enough--so I added more to make it creamier.  I added the listed amount for lemon juice (freshly squeezed), but I may end up adding more right before serving it.  I've only had fresh hummus once, and it was so delicious compared to the store-bought versions.  I felt like I ended up with a chunkier hummus that tasted closer to peanut butter.  But I may have done this to myself, which is why I still gave this 4 star

I eat hummus served up so many different ways. I enjoyed this one. Authentic is how you make it. Everyone's pallet is different. If you don't like a lot of garlic, cut it back. If you don't like cumin, don't add it. If you don't like olive oil, leave it out. Better yet, just skip this recipe and move on to the next until you find one that fits you and your kitchen cabinets. Don't slash a recipe that someone has graciously shared unless you had issues with the preparation of the meal. For those who enjoy trying new flavors, this was yummy. Adjust to your likings. Thank you for the added recipe to my saved box.

This recipe makes a nice chummas! I love to add a little more garlic! I tend to avoid the cumin as it can overpower the chumas and I like the taste of the garlic to come through. The texture of this is better than the thick pasty type.I love it with fresh tabbouleh and homemade pita bread or pita chips toasted if the bread is not as fresh.I did not know chummas could be frozen! Thanks for the recipe and the tip!

So simple, so tasty. If cumin isn't your thing, then don't add it. Still a great foundation for subtle variations.  I added a couple tablespoons of hemp hearts for protein with a mild pine nutty flavor.

I used half the amt of chickpeas, but used the same amt of oil, lemon, and cumin, and 3 cloves garlic instead of 1 (but my garlic was old and not so potent). I left out the tehina because mine was expired, so I added a tablespoon sesame seeds. Will have to try again with tehina! Note: half the chickpeas still made a quart of hummus!!

I love this recipe.  So light and fresh tasting.  To cut down on fat, I substituted tofu for the tahini.  When I was out of tofu, I tried it with fat-free yogurt.  It works perfectly with either.

I love store bought hummus and was dissapointed after all the extra work that I put into this recipe that it did not taste anything like the store bought kind.  It took a whole morning to cook the beans, and unfortunately for me, I made enough for an army. The texture was much too course and it wasn't creamy like the store bought kind. Also, there were lots of chick pea skins that did not get thoroughly chopped that made it pretty gritty. It does freeze well, however, be warned that once you get it out of the freezer, it can only be kept in the fridge for about a week without ggoing bad.
