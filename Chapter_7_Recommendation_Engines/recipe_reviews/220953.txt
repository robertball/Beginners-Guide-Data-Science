I cooked the "glaze" for over 20 min and it never did turn into a glaze...so the chops just sat in liquid and cooked

I used this glaze over parboiled country style pork ribs and butternut squash cubes. I cooked them together for an hour at 375. I brushed with glaze and basted with pan juices every 15 minutes. The ribs were perfect. The squash was perfect. This glaze is perfect! I used honey balsamic vinegar and Jamesons whiskey.

I couldn't get the liquid to reduce to a glaze. Recipe said to double it for a ham. I did so but it stayed " liquidy" and "thin". I spent so much time on it that I didn't have time to prepare anything else. Disappointed.

Glaze took 3x specified time to reduce at low temperature. Cooking time was way too long - used 1 inch bone-in pork chops and they were at 175 by 30 minutes (USDA says they only need to be at 145). Maybe I should have used thicker chops, but an hour is way too long at 350. Glaze was one dimensional - just sweet, not much flavor. Wouldn't make this again.

Awesome!! My family loves this. Have made it several times. Im not sure what the first reviewer did wrong but i do know your not supposed to let the porch chop set in the glaze. It clearly says to brush it on the chops while they cook and its thickens as it cools

I MADE THIS LAST NIGHT FOR HUBBY AND OLDER DAUGHTER.  THEY WERE AMAZING!!!  BEST PORK LOIN CHOPS WE HAVE EVER HAD.  OURS WERE 1 1/2 TO 2 INCHES THICK, SO I BRINED THEM IN WATER, BROWN SUGAR, SALT, A FRESH THYME, ROSEMARY AND SAGE SPRIG FOR 4 HOURS BEFORE COOKING.I DID SAUTE A HALF CHOPPED ONION AND 2 FRESH GARLIC CLOVES SLICED PRIOR TO ADDING THE OTHER GLAZE INGREDIENTS, BUT THAT WAS THE ONLY CHANGE I MADE. ALSO, ONLY HAD ABOUT 2 TABLESPOONS OF WHISKEY (MAKERS MARK) BUT THE GLAZE REDUCED TO AN AMAZING SAUCE WITH THE PERFECT CONSISTENCY. I BROWNED, THEN BASTED THE CHOPS FOLLOWED BY 20 MINUTES IN THE OVEN; THEN CONTINUALLY BASTED THEM.  THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!

this is terrific!  I never could get the glaze to cook down to what i would consider a glaze consistency and that was before I added the reduced bourbon (Jack D).  I did put a little more honey in the glaze at the start as it was a little too vinegary for my husband.  regardless, it was great.  I just basted the chops about every ten minutes, kept the remainder of the liquid warm and served that as a dipping sauce. I also served cubed baked sweet potatoes and before serving, I poured some of the liquid in those as  well.  It was delicious.  My husband is a light, picky eater and even had seconds.  Will definitely make again as we enjoyed it so much.

Someone commented that the glaze was runny and didn't ever produce a glaze.  I followed the recipe exactly and my glaze turned out perfect.  I'm wondering if maybe the whisky didn't get reduced long enough.  If you reduce it, it doesn't render a whole lot, but the glaze thickened up nicey.  If you add the whisky before reducing, it will be runny.  I also always marinate my pork in Coca-cola.  It tenderizes pork beautifully.  Discard the marinade before baking for this recipe.

Took much longer for the glaze to reduce to 1/2 cup than the recipe indicates and did not thicken as it cooled.

This was delicious!  However, it took me 45-50 minutes to get the glaze reduced enough.  I would definitely make it again ... I'd just start earlier.  :)

Flavorful but not really a glaze.  I actually used a hard cider and lightly seasoned 1/2" boneless pork loin cutlets with lemon pepper and truffle salt.  I also added 2 medium Macintosh apples (sliced thin) and 1/2 a medium red onion diced to the bottom of the pan which I tossed with a teaspoon of soft butter and a touch of the  "glaze".  I baked for  30 minutes and did use my meat thermometer to verify it reached 165 degrees.    There was a lovely spice taste (not hot) to the dish and suspect it was a combination of the ingredients.  Next time I would experiment adding another apple and use the whole onion as this was a wonderful accompaniment to the dish and we wanted more.  There was plenty of liquid/glaze  to accommodate this.

Good sweet glaze, had trouble getting the glaze to cook down so we added a little water and corn starch rue to thicken it up.  Used Crown Royal Apple Whiskey as well.

Delicious! Everyone loved this, only thing is in my electric oven took about 1 hour 20 min to cook 4 chops fully. Still was a hit!

Loved the flavor but had to increase for my large family. This took significantly longer to reduce so next time I will make the glaze ahead of time. I topped it with a caramelized onion, apple, cranberry and brown sugar concoction. It was amazing. Can't wait to try it with a pork loin.
