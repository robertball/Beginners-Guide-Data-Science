The blackberry absolutely makes this pie. I used fresh peach, 1 carton of fresh blackberry (all the store had left) and half frozen. I had a lot of juice left over in the mixture, I did not put this in the pie crust. I also put the cinnamon and nutmeg sprinkled on the fruit before covering it and then another light sprinkle on the top crust. Make sure to line your oven, mine went everywhere, depite the lack of juice kept out. Excellant though. I'd make this again in a heart beat.

This is wonderful.  I had blueberries to use so I substituted those for the blackberries.  I added 1 T. sugar to the spices to sprinkle on top. I also increased the corn starch to 4 T. I made my crust with 3 c. flour, 1 t. salt, 1 c. chilled butter, 6-8 T ice water.  Instead of trimming the edges I folded the bottom dough over the top dough and crimped together.  It took longer to bake than what is directed.

Good pie!!  I used Splenda instead of sugar and cooked the filling first.  My grandma always cooks her blackberries before puting them in her pies so I did the same.  I mixed the blackberries, peaches, corn starch and splenda in a large pan over medium heat until warm.  I left as much of the resulting liquid out as possible.  I also mixed in a little cinnamon and nutmeg into the filling as well as adding some to the crust after buttered.  Turned out great.  Not too liquidy.  Next time I will cover the perimeter with foil.  My outer crust got a little too browened in that first 15 minutes.

I have made this pie twice, using frozen peaches and blackberries and both times it turned out terrible. The problem is too much liquid. The second time I made it I doubled the cornstarch to 6 Tbs. and still terribly liquidy. I'm scratching this recipe because of this problem.

I have just started learning to bake and have surprised myself, as well as everyone I know!  I have made this pie 5 or 6 times this summer to take to parties, give as gifts, or have at home.  The crust looks so amazing and has a nice rich flavor combined with the fresh fruit which creates a step back in time for many people...and they think I'm amazing!!  I've used raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries, and I personally prefer the blueberry/peach version.  Thank you for a super easy, super fresh, beautiful pie that even a novice can handle!

This recipe was a hit at my house!  I had to make some changes (My pie crust was already cooked).  It has a great aroma and it is delicious!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  It was the only blackberry peach pie recipe I could find on here!

This was excellent! I didn't have fresh peaches so I substituted canned. My family all most consumed the entire pie in one sitting. I will make it again with real peaches. My husband said,"I am buying fresh blackberries again if this is what happens to them. I don't care how much they were."

We picked fresh blackberries at a nearby farm, where we also got the peaches, and used this recipe to make one of two July 4th desserts.

I had friends over for dinner, and everyone loved this. I used frozen thawed blackberries and canned peaches, and it still turned out great.

Pretty good!  I used fresh-picked blackberries and 3 peaches, but I added an extra tablespoon of cornstarch.  Set up pretty nice.

I used four 7 oz. Del Monte cocktail cups of blueberries and blackberries in juice. After straining all of the juices out it cut down the total amount of fruit to about half what the recipe calls for. This ended up working out very well since the sugar breaks down the dark fruits, extracting plenty of rich and delicious juice. I think making up the difference with peaches rather than berries will make for a better ratio next time. 4 peaches and 1.5 - 2 c. berries. I also cut the top crust into 3/4" strips and did a lattice, which looked just lovely - and tasted just as wonderful. So, cut the berries in half and add a peach and you'll be all set!

Really good and a big hit with the family.  I probably added more corn starch than required because I put heaping tablespoons in the mix so I didn't find this runny like some reviews' mentioned.  But a note of warning: I did have to put a sheet pan on the bottom of the oven because some of the juices did spill over when it was baking.  It was so easy to make and a delicious solution to the fresh blackberries my mom gave me.  (I got sick of always making jam from them) I'm making this again very soon especially since I've got requests to make this for my in-laws and other relatives.  Thank you for a terrific recipe!

AMAZING!!!!!  The only thing that I did to the recipe was add a bit of sugar to the cinnamon and nutmeg topping.  It was the perfect complement to the Peach Ice Cream recipe also found on this sight!  (Had LOTS of fresh peaches on hand!)

I should probably blame the cook for this one.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I used fresh fruit and a store-bought crust.  The refrigerated pie crust fell apart when I tried to shape it.  Since I wasn't able to seal the crumbly pie crust, the liquid boiled over into the oven mostly.  The blackberries and peaches tasted a little odd together to me.  I like them both separately.  I probably will not make this again, but if I do I will use a frozen pie crust or make my own.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I visited a local orchard and picked fresh blackberries for the recipe. The greatest part is that blackberries and peaches are in season at the same time therefor you can have a truly fresh homemade pie. My only only complaint was the seeds. Blackberries are very seedy and you will get a lot of them stuck in your teeth. The taste was great. I think I may try the recipe with blueberries and see if it is equally good/w out the seeds. Also a side note: This was my first pie with a homemade crust (French Pastry Pie Crust from this site) and I would highly, highly recommend it. Not only is it rewarding making a pie entirely from scratch, but majorly delicious. Its easier than it seems and there are lots of helpful suggestions from reviews to help!

Picked lots of wild blackberries--what to do?  Found this fantastic recipe and everyone loves it--didn't change anything.  The peaches give some sweet balance to the tartness of the blackberries.  If you want to make your own crust, try the French Pastry Crust recipe.  It is flaky and sweet--not dry.

Simple, clean flavors, really easy and delicious. I have slightly large ceramic pie plates so I increased the filling by about 20% but the cook time didn't change. The berries were very sweet so I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. Delicious!

This is a great combination of fruits!  I made it as a pie last year and am just waiting for peaches to be a bit more in season to make it this year, maybe as a cobbler or "crumble."

Delicious!  Love the way the sweetness of the peaches plays against the tart of the berries.  This combo is way better than either alone, and the recipe couldn't be easier.  I've been canning peaches for days and wanted to do something with a few fresh ones.  Had a few blackberries still hanging on the back pasture fenceline, so seemed like a perfect match!  I increased the cornstarch to 4T, as recommended by other reviewers.  Still a juicy mess in my oven, but thanks to other reviews, I was warned to put foil down and that did contain it.  I'm gonna make another one tonight and might try cooking the fruit, sugar and cornstarch (SureGel!) on the stove for a few min and letting it gel up a bit, then toss it in the crust.  Will report back.

This recipe tasted great, although the instructions should include that to seal the dough for the crust, you should dampen the edges with a bit of water. This will prevent the pieces from separating while baking. Otherwise, it came out great!

Every year we get fresh peaches and blackberries from our local orchard and every year I look for a recipe to combine them into a fresh tasty summer dessert. I'm glad to finally have found the one I'll stick with! I made this for a family gathering where desserts are always plenty. It was a hit and was gobbled up before all the others! We served with a big glob of cool whip on top. Can't wait to try this with homemade crusts and real whipped cream!

This pie was a big hit!  I've made it several times and got raving reviews each time!  I made it sugar-free by substituting "Splenda for Cooking" in place of the sugar and it worked perfectly!  I've had several people ask for the recipe!  Best with fresh fruit.

Amazing pie!! My whole family loved it. I used slightly more fruit than called for because I like a lot of fruit; I used 6 small peaches and 4 cups blackberries (3 of the containers from the store). I used 3/4 C Splenda in place of the sugar. Also, I used "Pie Crust III" from this website to make the crust (it's a healthier crust with canola oil, and I use white whole wheat flour in it). Looking forward to making this one again!

What a nice summer pie.  Peaches and blackberries are in season at the same time here in the Northwest and so it seemed perfect to pair them in a pie.  The peaches and berries really have a nice flavor together and the berries give the pie filling a lovely red color.  I used more peaches and less berries just because I could only get 2 cups of berries off my small bushes but I had a ton of peaches to use.  Serve with a little vanilla icecream and enjoy.

This pie is fabulous! We got fresh blackberries and white peaches from our local farmer's market. Be sure that your peaches are still somewhat firm so they're easier to peel and cut. Also they add some texture and substance to the pie. I squeezed some fresh lime juice over the fruit (lemon would also be great) for freshness. I dotted the top of the fruit with the butter before putting on the top crust, then omitted the melted butter later. I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top of the crust, left out the nutmeg (which I typically love, but wanted the flavors to be more subtle). Line your baking sheet with foil, as it will bubble over. Next time I will use an additional peach, but otherwise do everything the same. I can't imagine anyone not liking this pie.

This pie was a huge hit. The berries are more dominant than the peaches. I might add more peaches the next time.

This was sooooo delicious! Picked the blackberries last night, found this recipe today, and decided to give it a try. Served it warm with some vanilla ice cream, yummm!

I made this with fresh peaches and blueberries (5 peaches and 1/2 C. Blueberries so that the blueberries would not overpower the peaches)!  It is a delicious pie, and I will certainly make it again.  Next time, however, I will use flour to thicken it.  Yummy recipe!!

My husband said this pie was "pretty darn good" but I really know he likes it when he wants me to "keep practicing"! The taste was delicious- although I did change the recipe by mixing the cinnamon into the corn starch and sugar mixture and sprinkling only the nutmeg on top. It's a good balance of sweet and tart. I will definitely make this pie again. (Maybe with boysenberries because I think they have less seeds.)

I was looking for a mulberry pie recipe. Where I live, there are no other berries available and no peaches, so I used mulberries and mango. Used just a little less sugar since the mangoes were quite sweet, but did everything else as written. It was just right!

always make this recipe with fresh blackberries and peaches.  I add 1/2 cup additional sugar and 5 tbls corn starch.  My blackberries were not very sweet and it needed the extra sugar.  also I like a thicker filler as opposed to juicy filling so added more thickener.

This was a good recipe.  I did make a couple of changes after reading the reviews.  I upped the cornstarch to 4 tbsp and didn't have the problem with it being too runny, but it did overflow in the oven so line the rack with foil.

This was amazing. I used a little less sugar (about a quarter of called for) because I don't like over sweet pies, and although I LOVED it and was true fruit flavored, the recipes amount probably would have been just fine, thus 5 stars. Wonderful! Love the "glaze" over the top crust, made it special.

Excellent! I used the basic flaky piecrust recipe from this site. I did use 4 tablespoons of tapioca in the fruit rather than the cornstarch. I will definitely use this recipe again. Oh, I also dotted the butter on the filling before putting on the top crust. Mmmmmm!

We had fresh picked blackberries and peaches so what could be better than a pie?  This was a wonderful recipe which I followed to a "T".  I made my own pie crusts and made two of these pies.  My husband couldn't get enough!
