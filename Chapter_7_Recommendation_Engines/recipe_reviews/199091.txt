This is a wonderful recipe!!  I, too, used cornstarch, because I did not have tapioca flour on hand.  This satisfied my craving.  Thanks!!  =-D

Good flavor, but the tapioca starch made a texture that I personally don't care for. The family liked it, but like cornstarch version better.

Perfect. Far better than the too thick artificial yellow soup you get out. I followed the directions as noted and made beautiful egg ribbons that were delicate and abundent. I used cornstarch instead of tapioca flour because that is what I had  but I will make this again with tapioca flour to note what the difference is. I used the sesame oil and thought the amount called for was just right. Use quality chicken broth for a delicious and quick satisfying pot of wholesome healthy soup. Very nice recipe Fei Fei, thanks for sharing!

This was really good.  I used homemade chicken bone broth and a local free range egg, I did use the tapioca flour (my son is allergic to cornstarch and the rest of us do not care to eat genetically modified foods) and I wouldn't change a thing.  I liked it with the sesame oil on top, but it is good without as well.  I did need to add a little salt because my broth didn't contain salt.  But I wouldn't think you would need to add salt if you use storebought broth.  Thanks for the great (and super healthy) recipe!

This was great! The sesame oil really made it for me.  Mmm.  I used chicken stock instead of broth (it was what was on hand) and chives instead of green onion (also what was on hand).  I also added an extra egg because I'm recovering from an operation and need extra protein.  Excellent recipe!  I'll definitely be eating the leftovers today.

This was pretty close to the restaurant ones except I used cornstarch and added a little soy sauce for taste. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe as written is bland. Needs more ginger and some salt. When the extra seasoning is added it is very tasty.

Was salty, but may be because we used bullion cubes.

This was good and very easy.  I didn't care much for the underlying flavor of the sesame oil, so will leave it out next time.  Also, I used fresh eggs from our backyard hens, therefore I didn't exactly know if they were medium or large eggs.  One egg just didn't look like it was going to be enough, so I used two.  Two was perfect.

I made the following changes: I omitted the oil and white pepper, changed the tapioca flour to potato starch and added about 1 1/2 TBSP of Better Than Broth Chicken Soup Base. It's yummier and heartier than bouillon and it chased away that "texture" I saw other reviewers commenting on. After adding that, it was PERFECT. I recommend adding it by the teaspoon to taste. Otherwise chicken bouillon would do the trick as well.

Very good soup, I loved to ginger taste, better than restaurant I thought. I used the optional sesame oil in one bowl but didn't like it, just say'in.

Finally a great base that tastes delicious on its own! Same consistency, clarity, and taste as my favorite Cantonese restaurant and incredibly easy to make. When I'm looking to doctor it up I'll add some shredded leftover roast chicken, water chestnuts, and occasionally corn. The egg ribbons also come out beautifully with little to no effort and 1 egg is plenty doing it this way. Thank you!

This was simple and delicious!  Love the tip for achieving the ribbons with the egg.  I didn't have tapioca flour, but used cornstarch and it was fine.  Thank you!

Delicious. I love egg drop soup. I ate it when I felt a cold coming on one day and was perfectly fine by the next morning. I substituted the 2 tablespoons of tapioca flour with all purpose flour, and it didn't taste any different. I also used frozen peas instead of corn. I put them in right before the egg so they would have time to heat all the way through (about a minute). Overall great recipe.

This is very good could use a bit more thickener and if you make a swirl in your soup then add your stream of egg it works out good then don't stir til egg is set I added corn Orleans and carrots I believe water chessnuts would be good also

Very good. It tastes so authentic and the ginger and sesame oil really puts it over the top. I put chives and a bit of soy sauce in mine, and used corn starch rather than tapioca flour. Delish!

Did not have green onions on hand, grated some white onion, that's fine. Also used the corn starch, that's fine.  Frankly I love this recipe.  It has become one of my favorites as I always have all the ingredients on hand. (Using the above substitutes)It is quick and easy, and freezes well!
