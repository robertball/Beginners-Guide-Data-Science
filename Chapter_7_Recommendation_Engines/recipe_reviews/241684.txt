The recipe fails to mention that you have to cover the casserole in order for it to cook properly. We covered it with tinfoil and poked holes for steam to escape, then baked for an extra hour at 450. Once properly cooked, it was delicious!

The flavor is very good, but getting the potatoes to be tender is a challenge. I added tin foil and an extra 30 minutes in the oven and the potatoes still were a tad too crisp. Perhaps using a larger casserole dish, and thinner layers? 4 potatoes may have been too many. I suggest 3. Still, flavor was spot on. Worth trying again if I can get a fix for the potatoes.

Be sure to cover with foil and next time I'll add another pound of ground beef. Other than that we really loved it!

Even after cooking it for 90 min my potatoes (even cut thin) still weren't quite done. Unusual flavor that only the adults in the house would ea.

Pretty dull. I d eliminate the water in the first 30 minutes and do half the tahini lemon water in the second 30 minute bake. Even slicing the potatoes super-thin they were undercooked.

Like many other reviewers I ended up having to cover this up in foil to cook it properly. I may have to try this recipe again since I was unable to find regular tahini and ended up using tahini sauce from trader joe's. I have since found where the tahini at trader joe's was finding so I may have to return to this recipe.

I should have read the reviews before fixing this dish. I too had undercooked potatoes after an hour. Maybe partially cook the potatoes slices before building the casserole would be a solution. As for the taste, shredded cheese on top would have been better than Tahini. Save the Tahini for Hummus.

I followed some of the suggestions in other reviews - covered with foil, about half the lemon juice & my whole family enjoyed it!

Very tasty casserole.  The ground beef was seasoned wonderfully and the tahini sauce was delish! We had seconds.  A delightfully savory change of pace for a weeknight meal!

Yeah - my potatoes came out still crunchy because I didn't foil it. I even thought putting it in the oven..."this is something I would usually foil." 5 stars for a new way to make ground beef. 2 stars for the follow through. This recipe I think will turn out great if: put the potatoes on the bottom reduce the amount of lemon juice significantly reduce the amount of water (what was that? I had a moat of greasy water around it) put the tomatoes on the top and layer it so that it doesn't fall all over the place. I will definitely try again the new way and most likely will just get hummus to keep things simple.

This is definitely different from standard American cuisine so if you are not an adventurous eater you may not like it. My family likes Middle Eastern food so we enjoyed it. I made a couple minor changes: I put a tablespoon of cornstarch into the Tahini sauce to make it more like a gravy than a soup and I drained the meat when I took it out before adding the Tahini sauce. As other reviewers recommended I covered it for both halves of baking. Even so it still took more like 90 minutes before the potatoes were done.
