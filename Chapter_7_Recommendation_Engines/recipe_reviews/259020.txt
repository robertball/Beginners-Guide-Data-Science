4.20.18  Garlic really mellows out after it’s roasted, so be sure to you use a LARGE head of garlic, otherwise, you won’t get a lot of garlic  flavor.  I made this twice, the second time using a large bulb of garlic, and since I was serving with  spaghetti and meatballs, I added some basil.  Nice recipe.
