Very good quick dish, but I did make a lot of changes. I added alot more garlic and next time will throw the garlic in the beef at the end of the saute time to cook it a little. I also added a bit of crushed red pepper flake to the cheese mixture and meat. After the meat was cooked I sauted some veggies too and threw those is. I used onion, red and yellow pepper and zuchini. I also used a little more sauce and added some basil and oregano.   Very tasty and we will have leftovers for a week! Which I love.

Yum, yum, yummy.  My family loved it.  All three kids had second helpings, which is highly rare.  I made a small change because I hate when people completely change a recipie and then rate it.  I added some italian herb season to the turkey as I cooked it.  Only becuase I'm not a fan of plain ground turkey.  Everything else the same and it was so good.  The only problem I had is that it did not heat through enough.  Next time I will crank the heat up to 350 and cook for 35-40 minutes.  Also, definitely cover with foil.  Ours was a little dry on top.

Very good!  I added some more flavor by adding garlic, crushed red pepper, oregano, basil, and rosemary to the turkey while cooking, and I used an entire jar of sauce even though I halved the recipe.  (What can I say?  I LOVE tomato sauce!).  I didn't have ricotta so I just left it out, and I added broccoli to the cheese mixture to up the veggie count.  Turned out excellent.  Very nice, very flavorful.  Turkey doesn't always have  much of a flavor so I'm always spicing it up.  I made this up and refrigerated the night before, so instead of the oven on 300 for 30 minutes I upped the temp to 350 and the time to 50 minutes so it would heat through and melt the cheese.  I don't think this would have been necessary if I'd made the entire thing the same day.  Thanks for the recipe!

After reading other reviews, I made a few changes.  I used low fat cottage cheese instead of ricotta and I added oregano and 6 cloves of garlic to the cheese mixture, with these changes, the flavor wasn't bland as others stated.  I also thawed frozen spinach, squeezed the moisture out and added it to the cheese mixture too.  I found that it needed more sauce, so I used a jar and a half, and I used whole wheat penne pasta.

Tasty!  Only part I changed was that I saved some of the mozzarella cheese for the top.

This was very good! I only gave it four stars because I needed to add extra sauce and spices to give it a little more flavor. I used extra garlic, sauteed the turkey with onions (and more garlic), and added oregano and crushed red pepper flakes. All my guests had seconds and i received lots of praise for such a simple recipe. I served with a salad and that was plenty of food.

I loved this! I definitely added some spices and garlic to the turkey while cooking, but overall this recipe was excellent. My toddler, boyfriend and I all enjoyed it a lot. Good leftover too!

Good, comfort food receipe. I made a few changes. I used whole wheat spaghetti instead of penne pasta (I didn't feel like making yet another trip to the store) I added garlic salt and Italian bread crumbs to the ground turkey. I also used a deep glass casserole dish which probably resulted in a longer cook time (45 min.)  Still tastes great, and next time around I won't be as conservative with the seasoning as I was this time. Also I found that for me the prep time was considerably longer than 15 minutes.  I agree with the other viewers, either cover with foil or add more spaghetti sauce. Love the recipe thanks a bunch.

This was excellent.  Really enjoyed and so easy to make.  Use the foil because the pasta on top gets hard and crunchy.  My daughter's friend told her I didn't cook the pasta LOL

I am not big fan of ground turkey, so used mild Italian sausage for a bit more flavor.  Used 3 garlic cloves (per suggestion of reviewers).  Also used reg Penne pasta (had on hand).  Also sprinkled a smally amount of shredded Parmesean over top.  Definately needed the extra baking time at a higher temp (350   35-40 min) very good recipe.....will keep making

Disappointingly bland.  I added chopped onion, broccoli and mushrooms, and additional sauce, and it was still very pasta heavy and flavorless. Additional spices and sauce are a must.

A bit dry, not very flavorful. Could be improved greatly with sundried tomatoes, maybe some other veggies, and definately more herbs.

This was so good!  I made a few alterations.  I used whole wheat spiral noodles.  I sauteed up some mushrooms, onions and added them to the pasta mixture I also cooked up some broccoli and added that also.  Instead of ricotta cheese I used cottage cheese and it was delicious!!!  I cannot wait to eat the left overs!  next time I might try some left over roasted chicken!

This was a good, easy recipe to make. Not the best gourmat meal by any means, but it did the trick and reheated very well. I would say the leftovers were even better! I did add a package of frozen chopped spinach to increase the veggies. Will make again!

This is a very tasty and healthy recipe that went over very well with my husband, who doesn't usually care for recipes with ground turkey. I did make some changes based on other reviews. I used garlic salt in place of the salt. I added 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes. I added 1/2 tsp each of basil, oregano, and a garlic & herb seasoning. I doubled the amount of spaghetti sauce, and baked it at 325 for 30 minutes. This is a keeper!!

Made this last night and it is very good and easy.  You will definitely need more sauce!  I used a 24oz jar and it still could've used more.  About 1/2 way through cooking, I poured a 8 oz can of tomato sauce on top.  I would also highly recommend covering while cooking, or it will be very dry.  I used fat free ricotta and it was awesome.  I also chopped up onion and sauteed with the meat.  This did not get hot enough for me, so I cooked 10 mins longer and may cook on higher heat next time.

Very good and super fast to make. Didn't have jar spaghetti sauce, so I made my own, still only took the time the pasta took to be done until it was ready to be popped in the oven. A whole grain pasta dish that tastes great. Will definitly make this again.

I used a large can of sauce - 26.5 oz, and it still was dry. Plus, very bland even though I added extra garlic and italian seasoning in the meat. I won't make this again.

We made this using chicken sausage instead of ground turkey. It came out really delicious and cheesy. Yum.

I love this concept; I used regular whole-milk dairy products and sprinkled more mozzarella on top before throwing it in the oven. Also, I used a 24-oz. jar of sauce -- I think 13 oz. would be way too dry.

Five stars with these changes: I used cottage cheese in place of ricotta, 4 cloves of garlic, and added wilted spinach and crushed red pepper. SO GOOD! We couldn't stop eating it! Highly,  highly recommended.

A good basic recipe, but like Amanda details, I doctored it to my liking.  1 - I used 12 ounces of mozzarella cheese, and I also added some chopped spinach to the cheese mixture.  2 - I used 3 garlic cloves, but browned them with the turkey.  I also added to the turkey 1/2 a sweet onion, 1 medium sized green pepper, and 1 zucchini thing.  3 - Instead of a 13 x 9 glass pan, I used a deeper casserole dish, and baked it at 350F until it browned on top (about 50 minutes).  4 - I used a whole jar, about 26 ounces, of Prego spaghetti sauce. 5 - I used regular penne pasta as I think whole wheat pasta is sour tasting.  When I make it again, I think I will add 4 or 5 shakes of red pepper flakes to the sauce.  The cheese layers were very creamy and the vegetables with the turkey makes the turkey taste sweeter.  It was very good.

It was not too bad, but it needed more spices.  It was kind of bland.  Next time I think I will add more garlic and maybe some italian seasoning.

This seems like it would have potential with a lot more sauce and seasoning of the turkey meat... unfortunately, I'm a rookie cook, so I did not think of that until the meal was made and served to my family. Next recipe i'll be sure to read the changes people made!

This was our fisrt time trying ground turky and whole wheat pasta as we start to chnage to healthuer habits and we loved it! to jazz it up add large chopped onion, use 28 oz jar of bertolli garlic, basil & olive oil sauce. 20 mins cover in foil, last 20 uncovered, add spinach & black olives and serve w/ sauce on side. add oregano, basil, salt, pepper and more garlic to turkey when cooking and when mixing all together.

I added diced green peppers, onions & garlic to the meat while it was cooking. Used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and added a small can of mushrooms to the sauce mixture. Its a good base recipe.

Not bad, but not exciting either.   I normally believe that when people change a recipe and then rate it, it provides an inaccurate report.    However, the changes I made did not help, nor would they hurt my rating.  I made it as prepared, with the exception of adding about 2 tablespoons of sauce to the cheese mixture, since it was way too dry to mix, and added some chopped broccoli to the cheese mix for color, texture, and flavor.  I also added a dash of Italian seasoning to the turkey as it cooked.  I halved the pasta and turkey, yet used a full 25 oz jar of sauce and it was still rather dry.  Overall, this is a bland dish.  I'd certainly be more generous with the spices to try and give it some character.  There are some very good baked ziti dishes on here to which one could add some cooked ground turkey and have a much more flavorful and satisfying version of this meal.

Made this recipe for the first time tonight for my very health conscious boyfriend. It was very easy to make. And it came out ok. My only complaint was that it was kind of dry. And a little bit bland. I even used a larger jar of sauce than the recipe suggested and a smaller box of pasta. Next time I will try more sauce. Hopefully that will give it a little more moisture and flavor. Also, another recommendation: make sure you let the cheese mix get to room temp. It is very difficult to spread on the pasta mix if it's not. Then as it bakes you get these huge cheese clumps. Not bad, just weird. Overall, not bad. I'll try it again for sure. And the health-nut approved too!!

I enjoyed this recipe quite a bit and so did my family. I did add some crushed red pepper for a little bite! And when shopping I forgot the ricotta - but used a low fat mild cheddar and it turned out great!!

Due to tomato allergies, I also made some changes, and it turned out really yummy! All six of us in our family loved it. Here are the few changes I made: Instead of ricotta, I used cottage cheese since that is what I had, and instead of garlic cloves I used the powder. In place of the spaghetti sauce I used a thin white alfredo type sauce to which I added lots of chives. I think I added a little more of the sauce on the bottom of the pan than the recipe called for, and as a result it was very creamy. Not a bit of dryness, but it also helped to use cottage cheese instead of ricotta because it has more liquid. YUM! :)
