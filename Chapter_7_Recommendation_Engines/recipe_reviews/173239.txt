This dish is bursting with flavor. Great job, and thanks for sharing. This would be a great potluck dish. I will admit, I omitted the white sugar and only used half the rice. :)

I left out the sugar and added a bit of red onion but this recipe is delicious. If I had a food processor to do the chopping for me I'd probably makes this regularly.

The depth of flavor in this is amazing. I would give it more than five stars if I could. I substituted a scotch bonnet for the Thai chile pepper because my grocery doesn't have thai chile's. I also had to use lemongrass paste in place of fresh lemongrass because it's what was available. Otherwise I made this as written and it was delicious. I will definitely be making this again.

Delicious, yummy!  Personal preference is less rice and more shrimp.  I also used Sambal Oelek instead of thai chili.  For short cuts, I am a huge fan of Gourmet Blends so I used tube lemon grass, basil and fresh ginger - but supplemented with fresh for garnish and presentation.  I will for sure be using this recipe in the future.  FYI - check the cooking time on the bag of rice, I followed this recipe and in burned and had to redo (must have been my type of organic rice).
