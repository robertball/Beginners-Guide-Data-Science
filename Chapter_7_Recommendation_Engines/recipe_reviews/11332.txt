These were good, but I prefer making the Spicy Oatmeal cookie recipe (sans raisins) from this site and making the filling using 1/2 c shortening, 1 regular-sized jar of marshmellow fluff, 1/3 c powdered sugar and 3 tsp of hot water with 1/4 tsp salt dissolved in it. More like the Little Debbie Filling, and doesn't need to be refridgerated!

I used 1 cup butter, 2tsp vanilla, 4 cups confectioner's sugar for the filling and still had a lot of filling leftover. Don't use raw eggs in recipes as it can cause food poisoning.

Very Good! This is just my own little by accident tip. I made these on a hot day and the icing started to melt between the cookies so I put the cookies in the freezer. I wrapped each cookie in saran wrap and froze. So yummy, not too hard and the icing still soft. A yummy treat into a cool treat.

Excellent!  I did think however they are way too rich.  I am going to try to cut down on the shortening the next time maybe by a few tablespons.  Definatley give these a try.

I loved these, they remind of "Little Debbies" oatmeal cookies with a homemade taste. I under bake my cookies and flatten them a little with a fork so they are really chewy. Great recipe!

Cookies were soft and delicious (and stayed soft!), the filling was the crowning glory, but you need to have a sweet tooth. MMMMMM! Will definitely make again!

DELICIOUS! I took a previous poster's advice and did 1/2 c shortening, 1 regular-sized jar of marshmellow fluff, 1/3 c powdered sugar and 3 tsp of hot water for the icing. I also cooked the cookies for 9 minutes so they were chewy. YUM YUM YUM!!!

The oatmeal "pies" are just great oatmeal cookies themselves... but if you're looking for something really sweet then add the filling and sandwich them.  They're great either way!!

these were really good. I would recommend making them on the smaller side as I made very large ones and some of them broke before we could make them into sandwiches.

I'm thinking this cookie will never get a bad review!  I read some of the notes and baked mine for 8.5 minutes plus I used a marshmallow/powdered sugar/butter filling.  These cookies are just about as perfect as I have ever tasted and after 3 days they are better than the first day.  Thank you for the recipe and all of the great tips.

I loved the cookie part of this recipe! I also underbaked mine; they were so nice and chewy that way! The filling, however, tasted a little too much like shortening to me. Altogether, this is a good recipe, but if I make it again, I would definitely make a different filling. Thanks for sharing!

Wow - these cookies are amazing.  I would recommend that you unbake them slightly for a very soft and chewy cookie.  The vanilla filling is perfect, not overly sweet.  A definite crowd pleaser.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Great, tastes just like an oatmeal cookie and thankfully without raisins!  My only problem was that they ended up more like cookies, and less like flat whoopie pies.

These were yummy! I would call them homemade oatmeal cream pies, since they aren't a true whoopie pie. I omitted the egg whites from the frosting (kiddos and pregnant ladies would be eating them) and reduced the shortening based on other reviews. I got more than 30 cookies from my batch (maybe 38), and there is not enough frosting to fill all of them, even if I used the extra 1/4 of shortening. I suggest doubling the frosting.

Fantastic cookies!  A little time consuming, but well worth it.  My kids (and kid-at-heart husband) are huge fans of the Little Debbie Oatmeal Cookies, and they loved these.  I felt the most important thing in having these turn out pretty was to use a cookie scoop to make these all the same size.  That way they all fit together nicely with the filling.

These were so sweet it was hard to finish a whole cookie.  Also, I could taste the shortening.  If I ever make again, I will reduce the shortening to only 1/2 cup.

I love this recipe!  At a suggestion from a friend who tried it first, I used 1 cup of butter.  It turned out perfectly - looked and tasted wonderfully.

Double Those Stars!!!  A very yummy cookie from a "Little Debbie Oatmeal pie" addict.  A crispy outside, chewy inside bit of magic!  I cooked for the minimum to keep them chewy.  If you do the same, just put some foil on the cooling rack or the cookies will fall through. Thanks for a tasty change from the ho hum choc. chip cookie.

I made these for the Super Bowl.  They were fantastic, and everyone loved them!  After I read the reviews of under-baking them slightly to make a more "chewy" texture, I decided to bake some of them for 8 minutes and some for 9.  The key word is SLIGHTLY, because the ones I baked for 8 minutes were too soft and they started falling apart.  The ones I baked for 9 minutes were perfect.  After reading the reviews about the vanilla filling I decided to use a different icing.  I used the easy buttercream frosting recipe from this website (using all butter and no shortening) and the results were fabulous.  I thought it complemented the oatmeal flavor perfectly.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

These cookies are awesome but they're too big, especially when the filling is pure delicious fat and there's two cookies instead of one.  I make mine mini size. They're still super soft and chewy. I just put the batter in the freezer for about fifteen minutes so they don't come apart during baking.  They stay nice and tiny in the oven if you chill them first. I never use egg whites for the filling though, too scary. I've made these cookies three years in a row for cookie exchange and they're just unbeatable even though I have to make three hundred cookies... so worth it. Yum! Thanks for the recipe!

My fiance and his son CANNOT keep their hands off these whoopie pies! Completely great according to them.  I do wish the filling ingredients were increased according to the amount of cookies one can make.  Each time I make this dish I do not have enough filling.  Will increase next time and see what happens. :)

I'd like to give this five stars but I couldn't bring myself to use the shortening called for in the cream recipe.  The cookie made as directed is delicious.  Others advised cooking for only 9 minutes but I had to cook for a total of 11, must have been the difference in my oven.  I recommend flattening them before baking so they're easier to eat later.  I also added a tad of molasses to the cookie batter.  I cut the recipe by 3/4 so I came away with 9 cookies and made the following cream mix:  2 tbs. butter, 3/4 c. marshmallow fluff, 1 tbs. cream cheese.  YUM!

these were absolutely amazing! I was short on eggs, so I used a peanut butter filling (3/4 cup butter, 3/4 cup peanut butter, beat. add 1/2 teaspoon salt, 3/4 cup confectioner's sugar. incorporate on low, and then beat on medium for 4 minutes.) and they turned out perfectly.

Oatmeal Whoopie Pies' Haiku: "Insanely tasty. Add zucchini and walnuts! Devoured so fast." I made these for a St. Patty's party, so I tinted the frosting green and added grated zucchini and some toasted, chopped walnuts to the cookie mix. They were totally like those oatmeal cream pies that I remember my Dad tucking in my lunchbox when I was a kid. These were seriously good, and I would've enjoyed them just as much w/o the decadent frosting. And yes, there were lots of "Whoopies!" being blurted out in between bites.

Awesome! You have to try these. I'm not even a big fan of oatmeal cookies, but these changed my mind. Took the suggestion of others, and refrigerated them after baking. I think it brought the flavors of the filling together better so that it didn't taste like shortening.

These were amazing.  My husband used to love the L.D. oatmeal creme pies until he found out they contain coconut.  He harbors a deep hatred and disgust for it.  These are pretty similar.  I always adjust recipes to my taste.  Added vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice to the cookie part, and added a dash of salt to the creme filling.  It helps to alleviate some of the sweetness.  Thanks for a great recipe.

These are way better than the store bought version (and way less preservatives). I used the medium sized Pampered Chef scoop and flatened the dough out a tad on the cookie sheet. I baked them for a little over eight minutes and they came out perfectly done. With the PC scoop, the recipes made twenty sandwiches. I also sneaked a little (okay maybe a lot) of raw dough, so it may have made a few more. I used a little less shortening in my filling also. Yummy, yummy, yummy!

I love this recipe. What a neat twist on a whoopie pie. I was afraid the cookies may flatten too much with all butter and I considered using half butter flavored crisco but i decided to use half butter and half margarine and had good results. They held up well. I added 2 teas. vanilla to the cookie mix(I love vanilla extract and use it in nearly everything)! The only other thing I did was to add 1/4 cup marshmallow fluff to the filling ( and a little extra vanilla, of course)! These are great. Make them small though, because they are very sweet and rich. Yum

I did not use the recipe for the filling (I used my aunt’s tried and true whoopie pie filling that we all love—wasn’t worth the risk to try someone new); but the cookies were delicious and only got better with time. By day 3 they tasted almost identical to Little Debbie’s oatmeal cream pies (in a very very good way).

These are very good. I agree with other reviewers, they would make excellent oatmeal cookies just on their own. I used butter-flavored shortening in the cookies. When assembling the cookies for baking, I rolled them into small balls and then partially flattened them with the bottom of a glass. Next time I will flatten them even more since they still puffed up quite a bit. Even a little too thick, they still made excellent sandwich cookies and my DH was a very happy guy!

These were EXCELLENT!

Please learn from my mistakes.  I made them in a whoopie pie pan.  It is completely unnecessary to do so, and in fact the pan screwed up the batch.  I will have to remake because of the way they turned out.

In the meantime, my neighbors and I are eating the screw ups, and yum-o!

I was so excited about these, and they did not turn out well at all.  The cookies looked like pancakes as they came out of the oven (they expanded and all mushed into each other, and they were totally flat) and they were rock hard.  Not at all what I was expecting.  I gave two stars instead of one because they did taste good.  I didn't bother making the frosting since it wouldn't have worked out with hard cookies.  :(  Bummer.

Excellent! These taste just like the Little Debbie oatmeal creme pies but even better. I kept the cookies the same, baking them for 10 minutes to keep them super soft. I used a different filling consisting of 7 oz. marshmallow creme, 1/2 cup shortening, 1/3 cup powdered sugar, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, and 1/4 teaspoon salt dissolved in 2 teaspoons hot water. Delicious.

Oatmeal cookie recipe is great.  I followed others' advice and cut down on shortening when making the filling but, it was still too (painfully) sweet.  I'll go with cream cheese filling next time.

I had everything on hand to make these! Everyone loved them. After tasting the frosting I did add more sugar because it was a bit heavy on the shortening flavor but still 5 stars because it was still so delicious with the cookies. I will definitely make these again! Thanks for the recipe!

I know my husband would love these, one cook said they're Like little Debbies and he gobbles them up but I'd much prefer making my own. Now here's my ???. For the filling, are the egg whites just beaten, are they foamy, soft peaks, stiff? I'd hate to wreck the cookies w/a silly mistake.

These are VERY good.  I made these as directed, but I did take them out at 9 minutes.  These are really sweet, though, and I have a big sweet tooth.

Delicious!  I baked the cookies fro about 10 minutes...they didn't look done but the edges were brown.  Once the cookies cooled they were perfect and chewy.  Very similar to a Little Debbie Oatmeal Cream Pie!

Really great cookies.  For the cream filling, I was able to cut back on the shortening by two tablespoons without sacrificing consistency.  I also used rolled oats (not quick oats) and the cookies turned out just fine.

I substitued 3/4 c. refined coconut oil for the butter. The cookies turned out fabulous.  I made large cookies and was able to make 24 or 12 pairs.  To keep this soy free, for the filling I used Spectrum Organic Palm shortening, reducing the amount to 1/2 + 1/8 cup. Substituted coconut milk for regular milk.  Overall very good results.  Doesn't taste exactly like a LD Oatmeal creme pie but I'm happy and chemical free.

holy cow, these are sweet. i really like the cookies (although mine turned out crispy instead of soft - maybe i should have made them bigger?), but the filling is a bit too sweet for me. and it's a little synthetic tasting, due to all the shortening, i'm sure. i think perhaps a cream cheese filling that's a little less sweet would be better. so, these turn out incredibly sweet and rich. if that's what you're into, go for it! i baked mine at 325 for 12 minutes, because they got a little overdone at 350. once again, it could be that i made them too small. i rolled them into balls for a nice round shape.

Great recipe! I made the filling as directed and tried it. it was good but I don't like raw egg in anything I serve others so I made a simple buttercream with a tad salt to cut the sweetness and it was delicious!

Followed the recipe and they came out nicely.  They are super rich, though so I split the cookies in half; half sandwiches, half single cookies.  The cookies by themselves were pretty tasty too!

The cookies were delicious, but I can't say the same thing for the frosting. In the frosting I substituted the shortening for butter, and it tasted like butter and sugar and I had to put extra vanilla. I will probably not make them again.

The cookies are good, the filling is very bland and tastes like a copycat of oreo filling. Trade the shortening for a softened butter to make a buttercream frosting instead and it makes it substantially better.

An ok recipe, but needs more detailed instructions. Makes 18 pies, so you need 36 "cookies." I didn't read this prior to and made my cookies too big. Use a cookie scoop. I didn't care for the frosting. It was gritty and just really sweet. I added additional vanilla to take the edge off, but it still lacked something. Marshmallow cream? Either way, I won't go to the time to make again.

I think this recipe calls for way too much sugar and shortening.  I would replace the shortening with butter or a substitute and use marshmallow creme also as other reviewers suggested .

Not as good as a friend makes them - I like a little more flavor in my cookies and these were fairly bland (my opinion) tasting.  I used the substitute frosting as suggested by one reviewer (to avoid the use of a raw egg white) and it also wasn’t the whoopie cookie frosting flavor I remember.  Will have to play with the flavoring in the future.  Also took longer to bake for me - about 12 minutes so they kept their shape.

I loved this recipe.  I took into account that many reviewers thought the cookie was good as well but a bit too sweet so I adjusted the brown sugar amount.  I used 10 3/4 oz (2 cups of brown sugar is approx 14 oz.)  I already have another basic filling recipe I like so I used that (9 oz shortening, 1 7-oz jar marshmallow cream, 1 cup conf sugar, 1 tbsp vanilla) and I think it helps balance the sweetness.  This recipe is definitely a keeper for me.

I can't review the cookie part fairly because I altered the recipe too much.  But I made the filling accordingly, only lowering the amount of shortening based on reviews to 1/2...still, shortening is ALL I can taste!

These are tasty! I only added 1 1/2 cups of oats & it seemed like enough. I recommend flattening the cookies a little before baking, I did not & my sandwiches ended up pretty thick. I've had cookies that were softer, more cake-like & this recipe is definitely cookie-like. Also I used butter in place of shortening to avoid hydrogenated fats & it turned out great!

I only gave this a 4 star because I didn't make the filling.  For a twist, I used vanilla ice cream for the filling and kept them in the freezer. The cookies are fabulous!  I do agree with the other reviews to take them out of the oven after 8-9 minutes. I went 10 minutes and they were just a tad too hard.  9 minutes would have been perfect. Love this recipe!!

I made these yesterday and my family loved them.  I must admit that mine came out more like Little Debbie Oatmeal Pies (flat) instead of small rounded cakes, but they were still very good.  I also used 3 cups of confectioner's sugar as I felt 2 cups left the filling tasting like Crisco.  I will definitely make these again.

These cookies were great.  The only complaints I received was that I ruined some diets.  I used paterized liquid egg whites that I found in the egg product/egg substitute section of the store.  It was a lot more expensive than regular egg, but preferable to salmonella.

Good cookies.  Was a little wigged out by the shortening, so I used heavy whipping cream for the filling.  Clearly it was a little too light for the cookies but it tasted great and once they are frozen they are truly a treat...the cookies were not rock hard at all!

The cookie part kept breaking. It was almost impossible to get them off the pan and to frost the cookie.

These were a hit, but you do need a glass of water nearby - they are super sweet!  I would definitely double the filling recipe, although the cookies are good by themselves.  Also, pay attention to the size of the cookies.  I made pretty big cookies, and then it's almost too much.  Great recipe when I have a sweet tooth, though!

These are wonderful!!!!!! I have made them a few times and everyone has loved them. I thought the icing to be too rich...at first but I refrigerated some of the pies and froze others. I think after setting the flavors balanced. I threw a btch togetehr for mothers day and My sister in law who is always watching her weight and never keeps sweets in the house actually took a few home. SO I suggested whip them up, wrap them in palstic wrap and refrigerate or freeze! Pull them out when you need a fix they are great!!!!!!!

These are awesome! My boyfriend always begs for oatmeal cream pies at the grocery store, so I made these for him instead. These would be a great treat for bake sales and picnics, and are suprisingly quick to make and assemble. The cookie recipe is great alone, but made even better by the filling. I used a 1/2 cup of shortening for the filling, and will try butter next time. Be generous with the filling, I used it sparingly and had lots left over. Great recipe!

I thought these were great not to sweet at all. I followed the recipe exactly and cooked the right at 10 minutes and they turned out soft and stayed that way. The only problem I had with the recipe was that it didn't say how or what size to drop them on the pan, I ended up do rounded tablespoons full and ended up with 48 cookies=24 pies and they were the perfect size! ENJOY!!

I didn't use the filling recipe because I made these to use up some frosting I already had.  The cookies were good...a bit too sweet, and I would suggest baking for less time than in the directions.  10 minutes made mine a bit too crunchy.

I usually make chocolate whoopie pies, but was looking for a recipe to use up some oatmeal.  This recipe was quick, easy, and YUMMY!  It got rave reviews from the guys my hubby works with - they say I am better than Little Debbie ;-)

Great recipe, thank you for keeping it traditional! I spent a great deal of my youth in Pennsylvania Dutch country, where whoopie pies are still pretty much a staple. The filling has always been made with Crisco and egg whites and I never heard of anyone contracting "food poisoning", ever.  In fact, you will see most any version of a whoopie pie at any local bake sale, wrapped individually in wax paper (just like the Tastykakes of yore,sigh) and I would bet they were made from a recipe handed down through the generations which included egg whites in the filling. Whoopie Pies are what they are...changing anything out would be breaking a long-standing traditional recipe.

I did not try these finished, (just the raw cookie dough), but the family really likes these and told me to give them 4 stars.  I couldn't get past the shortening taste of the filling in the little bit I tried on my finger.  My family didn't seem to notice.  I'm sure I will make these again for them.

The cookie itself tasted very good. I am giving this only 3 stars because i felt that the cookies were a little too hard. I thought they would be softer. Maybe i will try to undercook them next time to get them chewier. Also i wasn't too excited about the filling. Too sweet and wasnt too crazy about eating shortening. Will try again, with some adjustments. But not a bad start.

It was delicious!  Cookies turned out really thick, made for a very big "sandwich" - would try to get the cookies a bit flatter next time.

Very yummy, but my cookies were too hard for a whoopie pie.  Maybe I did something wrong.
