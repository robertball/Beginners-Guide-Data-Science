I thought this recipe would be very sweet and bubbly,instead it was very refreshing and not real sweet. The 1/4 cup sugar isn't enough to really sweeten the tea, it just cuts the bite. I used the juice of frozen crushed raspberries and that wasn't overly sweet either. I used Club Soda in place of carbonated water because its what I had on hand. The fizz of the soda was diluted by the tea, leaving the tea with just a little tingle but no sparkle, bubbles or fizzes. All in all its a very tasty iced tea for those who don't care for the cloyingly sweet kind.Its unlike any of the raspberry teas I have had in the past. Thanks for sharing Scott!

I am completely addicted to this stuff! I make it with raspberry zinger teabags. Like the previous reviewer notes, this is a super refreshing drink that is neither overly-sweet nor super fizzy. I usually just chill it in the fridge and omit the ice cubes. I seriously cannot get enough of it. Thanks so much!

This is a great summer-time beverage!  Mine had just the right amount of zip, thanks to the combo of sun-brewed black tea, raspberry tonic, and lemon sparkling water.  I didn't even need to add sugar!

I used a raspberry-peach black tea, fresh black raspberries from my own yard and berry seltzer. Puréed raspberries with immersion blender and then pressed them through a sieve. Purée was a little thick so I thinned it with a little of the seltzer. Fresh mint from my yard. Couldn’t get fresher than that! Absolutely delicious!
