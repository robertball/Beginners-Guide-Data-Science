This is a wonderful slaw. It's excellent fresh, 'as is' without being drained and adding mayo.  I'll be making plenty with the garden cabbage to use through the winter.  Brought a rave from my husband.

This was the closest recipe I could find that matched my grandmother's freezer slaw.  It can be simplified and still has a great taste!  
I skipped step one altogether.  Just do steps 2 and 3 and skip the mayo, it's not needed. The longer it sits in the vinegar, the tastier it gets.  I ate a good sized bowl before it even made it to the freezer!

I made this recipe a couple of weeks ago. We had some for dinner the day I made it, and I liked it. I put the rest in the freezer, and was so curious to find out what it would be like after having been frozen. I thawed it out for dinner last night, and served it with our Turkey Avocado Paninis (also from this site). No one in my family cared for this after having been frozen. It was soggy (even after draining all the liquid) and limp. I tried adding a little mayo to it, to see if that would help, but it only made it worse. It ended up in the garbage. I would give it 4 stars before freezing, but 1 star after being frozen - so I'm settling on 2 stars, considering it's supposed to be "freezer slaw".

I had been looking for a good coleslaw with a vinegar base. I found it! This coleslaw is delicious!  Bonus: you can always have some on hand in the freezer!

I have been looking for a while for a freezer cole slaw.  My aunt used to make it and I always remembered it.  It is very good even though I cut the sugar in half and it was still a little too sweet.  Only problem is that it hasn’t made it to the freezer yet.  Just can’t bring myself to put it away.   Will probably have to make another batch to freeze.

The mayo, just went lightly with mayo.  Salad was good either way, mayo or no mayo!
