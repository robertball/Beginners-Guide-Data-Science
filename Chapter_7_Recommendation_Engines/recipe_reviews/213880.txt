Wow - this was excellent, and a really nice departure from the more "traditional" bbq chicken. Since I didn't have Bobby Flay's Sixteen Spice Rub, I used "All-Around Spice Rub" by Fight the Fat Foodie as my base and added some ancho chile powder, cumin, coriander, ginger, allspice, cinnamon, cloves, and ground fennel. I pounded my chicken down thin and dried it with a paper towel then coated both sides of the chicken with the spice rub. (no oil needed) I let that set for a few hours in the fridge. For the sauce I lightened it up with Hellman's light mayonnaise and used a good quality horseradish. This turned out fabulous with a wonderful combination of flavors. You get a bit of sweet and spicy from the rub and the sauce seals in the moisture while grilling. Plus it does make a great dipping sauce!

I don't like traditional Texas bbq chicken, so I thought this might be a good alternative. I've never heard of a mayo-based bbq sauce, but it was surprisingly good *AND* it honestly kept the chicken very tender on the grill. I used low-fat mayo, but didn't change anything else...*MAYBE* added a bit more cayenne than it called for. I grilled at a pretty high heat and used the rub on both sides of the meat...it seemed weird to just put in on one side. It didn't take long. Definitely cover and wait before you cut into it. I served this with roasted potatoes and a green salad and it was a quick, easy, tasty summer meal. I only used three breasts and have a lot leftover. I'm going to make sandwiches on hamburger buns with the leftover sauce as mayo for lunch tomorrow. Should be delicious!

Amazing!  We didn't have any of Bobby Flay's Spice Rub, so we used our own.  The Alabama Barbecue Sauce makes the chicken so flavorful and moist.  We will use this recipe again and again.

This intrigued me since I don’t think I’ve ever had a mayonnaise based BBQ sauce, so I decided to try it out.  I immediately thought a full cup of mayonnaise was excessive (although this is a Hellmann’s recipe), so I cut the sauce ingredients in half for four chicken breasts and had plenty.  I didn’t have the Bobby Flay spice rub, so I used the seasoning blend in Sarah’s Dry Rubbed Chicken recipe here on AR, which turned out to be an excellent choice.  I did season both sides of the chicken early in the day and refrigerated them until it was time to grill.  This was good and I’m glad I tried it, but I don’t think it will become a favorite of ours.

Most tender chicken I've cooked.  Sauce was simple to make and had good taste.  Used Emeril's Chicken Rub since the other wasn't available at the local store.  Added a little additional Cayenne Pepper and it was excellent.

This was very good.  I would recommend using slghtly less vinegar than what the recipe calls for. The sauce was a little too tangy for me,  but otherwise very good. Chicken was super tender and moist!

I omitted the horseradish due to personal taste, and this was one of the best chicken dishes I've ever had. Hours later after dinner I was still saying 'that chicken was delicious!'.
