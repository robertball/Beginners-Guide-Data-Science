These are really tasty cookies - but for me, I felt like the baking time and temp were off.  I followed the recipe to a "t" . . . and my first sheet pan, I put in the oven and set the timer for 8 minutes so I could check on them. After the 8 minutes, they were nowhere near done, so I added 4 more minutes, still not done . . . that's when I bumped the oven up to 350 and let them go for another 5 minutes, and then they were done. The 2nd tray I baked at 350 for 12 minutes, and they were perfect. I have to say, this made exactly 24 cookies, using a 1" cookie scoop - so the servings are spot on. I did press them down slightly before baking (like little hockey pucks), which I recommend doing, as they don't flatten very much on their own. All-in-all, a great recipe - just watch the time and temp according to your own oven, and press down slightly before baking. Thanks for the recipe!

Heavenly, creamy, but still contains that nutty texture. Took off one star because of the baking time that many others mentioned...I took a bite of my 9 minute cookie and realized there was still soft dough inside! Hope I don't get sick...baked it for another 6 minutes at 325 and they were done. I also added about 1/4 cup of Milkadamia (macadamia nut milk) because the cookie dough was way too dry. Flavors were spot on though.

I loved these pretty little cookies. I used salted pistachios so I did not add any additional salt. I loved the crunch of the chopped salty pistachios with the contrast of the sweet coconut. Another plus for this recipe is that there is no need to chill the dough to get a slightly puffy cookie. I used a # 50 scoop and, as Kim suggested, I flattened the dough a bit as it did make for more even baking of the cookie. I too baked these at 350 for 11-12 minutes and got about 30 cookies. I doubled the recipe the second time I made these as they were gobbled up quickly by the family.

They didn't spread at all during baking and came out a bit doughy on the inside. 8-10 minutes at 325 wasn't enough. I used another reviewers tip and did 12-13 minutes at 350 and the came out a bit more done. I think flattening the shape out before baking would help. I would add another 2-3 tablespoons butter as I found the dough to be too dry and decrease the amount of flour by maybe a half cup. 

I would try this recipe again, but with some changes.

Followed the recipe exactly- everyone enjoyed  them! 8-10 minutes cooking time was perfect.
