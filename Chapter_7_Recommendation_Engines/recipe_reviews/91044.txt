This recipe is great!  I was looking for another pumpkin chili recipe after tying "Pumpkin Chili Mexicana" from this site last year.  This one was great for using up leftover Thanksgiving turkey!  And, it contains 4 of the "superfoods"; turkey, tomatoes, black beans, and pumpkin!  It's a great-tasting combo at that!  I used one 14 oz can of chicken broth instead of beef and omitted the sherry.  Cooked the veggies on the stovetop first and then dumped that, along with everything else, in my crockpot for a few hours.

Very interesting and different recipe. The pumpkin makes the chili smooth and creamy. The spice level is conservative, however. I boosted this with extra "hot" chili powder and jalapenos which gave it a little more tang.

Very good, not as thick as the traditional tomato based chili's. Also very seasonal, loved the spice combination. I substituted plain yogurt in the place of sourcream.

This is pretty good.  My husband loved it.  I had to save my canned pumpkin for a pie so I used frozen pureed winter squash.
