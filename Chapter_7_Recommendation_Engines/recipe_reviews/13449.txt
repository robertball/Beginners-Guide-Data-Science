An excellent venison stew recipe for folks who do not like a "wild game taste".  A slow cooker is essential.  The looker to slow cook it, the better the flavors will blend, and the less gamey it will taste.  I recommend slow cooking for 5 hours, chilling overnight, and then again slow cooking for another 5 hours. This maximizes flavor without making the veggies mushy.  Also, additional flour should not be needed if the meat is first dredged in flour before browning.

I made this yesterday and it was awesome!  I did make a couple of changes though... I omitted the onion and used onion juice instead.  And I only used half the amount of onion that was listed in the recipe.  Also, I used carrots instead of parsnips.  We thought it was really good... I served it with cornbread.  Great recipe!!

This is a good easy recipe for venison. Use whatever root vegetables you have on hand.I personally use a crock pot on a low simmer, and leave it for several hours. It is quite good!

I made this last night. Delicious! I did make a few changes. 
~ I used my crockpot and put it on low for about 8 hours
~ I used a box of beef stock and a splash of red wine instead of water
~ I didn't have parsnips, but I did add 1 cubed sweet potato, a couple chopped carrots and some celery

I thought it was very tasty!

This was a fantastic recipe. I followed it to the letter with great results with only two exceptions.I used carrots instead of parsnips, and instead of mixing the flour in water in at the end, I made a rue (really simple!) with butter and flour and added that instead. The result was a thick, hearty, and savory stew that everyone just loved!

This recipe is delicious! I've tried many ways to cook venison tenderloin and this is sooo good! I did make a couple of changes: only used 2 onions, and substituted baby carrots for parsnips which I had on hand. This cooked in the crockpot on low all day. When I got home from work, I whipped up some hot, homemade buttermilk biscuits to use in "sopping up" the gravy -- oh my goodness! Talk about some comfort food!

I'm not a stew or venison lover, but hubby is and he went wild over this. I did have to add a few of my own seasonings and I bought a bag of soup greens which included all of the root vegies that normally go into a stew. Thanks so much Nancy!

Awesome!  We have made this 3 times already.  Great cold weather food.  Excellent flavor.  The first time we found that we had too many potatoes and it sucked up all the juice.  The next time we adjusted a bit and loved it even more.  We are thoroughly enjoying cooking up all our venison.  Thanks for the recipe!

I browned the meat with the onions, garlic, and spices then transferred to crockpot with all of the remaining ingredients. I added about a cup of both carrots and celery. The thing I didn't like about this recipe is that there are too many potatoes and not enough other veggies. If I didnt add the carrots and celery it would just be venison, potatoes, onions, and parsnips- nothing else. Also, my hushand added a few splashes of Frank's Hot Sauce to the whole stew and it really livened it up with out giving it too much of a kick.I would use this recipes again but with my few changes.

This was a good way to cook up venison stew meat.  I am not a huge venison fan, but thought this was very good.  I made this in the slow cooker.  I used 5C beef broth in place of the water (and upped the spices as a result of the additional liquid).  I used carrots in place of the parsnip and also added mushrooms.

Just made this today, and my oh my it is a keeper!  Wonderful taste and aroma. I had the time, so I just slow cooked it on top of the stove all day. I was afraid 3 onions were too many and since mine were BIG, I decided to use only 2.  I have to say now it came out perfect but another onion would not have hurt. I also used carrots instead of parsnips cause that's just what I had on hand. I also added a few shakes of crushed red pepper because we like spicy. Again, it is a great stew! Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is AMAZING! I used various cuts of the deer, and was worried that some would be tough as it was all very lean. I seasoned the meat as I coated it in flour and once I had seared it, I tossed in some merlot to scrap the flour reminents off the pan. I would HIGHLY reccomend doing this as it gives an amazing flavor to the meat and the broth. The meat was perfect and fell apart in your mouth. I put potatoes, carrots, peas, celery and whole wheat noodles in. I also used some extra flour at the very end to thicken it up a little, but only because hubby prefers it that way. This is a fantastic recipe and very forgiving.

I made this last night, it was Great.  Next time I would also use beef stock instead of the water as others had suggested I like stronger, bolder flavors.  Very simple classic stew, very easy to make, very good!  Will definately make this again with a few changes.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent stew consistency if you make it exactly like the recipe calls for.  I think it needs a little more spice, but if you don't change a thing it really allows you to taste the individual flavors.  Its a keeper.

I added more water and cooked it in the crock pot.  It went fast- this stew has  excellent flavor, even my picky kids were asking for more. You could add any type of root vegetable you had on hand.

Parsnip is out of season in Australia at the moment, so I used white sweet potatoe, and followed the recipe for 7 exactly with intentions of leftovers for the next day. However, there is only 3 of us and the entire pot was consumed in one sitting. Loved it and shall definitely cook it again.

This was delicious!!!  Followed the directions exactly except I added 3 beef bouillons...and only two onions...but to tell you the truth the onions cooked away to nothing.  I did thicken at the end with flour.  Meat melted in your mouth!!  A definite keeper

We loved this recipe. Simple and tastey! I did saute' a leek along with the onion simply because I had it on hand. It really seemed to lend a wonderful flavor. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

I've never been a fan of venison because I never liked the 'gamey' taste (probably wasn't prepared right!!) but I was given some by a friend and figured I'd give it a try with this recipe.  All I can say is - when I tasted it after it simmered for 2 hours and was adding the potatos & carrots was - WOW!  The meat was tender and falling apart and there was no gamey or strange taste!  It was awesome!  The only thing I did differently was I browned the meat in bacon grease instead of the oil, drained the grease off and then followed the rest of the steps (stir in onions, garlic, etc. etc.)  I also simmered this in an electric skillet on low for the recommended time (should've used my crock pot!!) but it turned out perfect!!

Not “too” bad, but with modifications it can really sizzle!!!  First off; not nearly enough salt.  Bump it up to FOUR tablespoons.  For a simply Devine flavor, slice up some portabella mushroomed, sautéed in a bacon grease and horseradish paste.  Replace the water with FIVE tablespoons of Peppermint Schnapps. Let simmer on low for about 30 minute.  Drain excess liquid and drizzle over the top with sorghum molasses!  This dish won four blue ribbons in a row at the “Oh Deer” festival in my  home county and is a favorite at Knights of Columba’s annual pot luck.

I wouldn't have been able to tell that this was venison, had I not made it myself. I added extra liquid as it cooked, and a smidge of beef bullion. The potatoes and parsnips took me an hour to cook at the low simmer I kept the meat at, next time I think I'll throw them in much sooner. I also forgot to thicken it! Still good.

I didn't do parsnips as I didn't have any. I substituted carrots with a dash of cinnamon for the flavor that parsnips have. I also put in half of  a turnip as we like that in stews. Those are the only differences. My family loved it!

My husband made this in the crock pot yesterday with venison steak. We absolutely LOVED it. We used carrots instead of the parsnips and gluten free flour. We will definitely be making this crock pot dish again as it was delicious.

Fan-feakin-tastic. This was my first time cooking with deer sausage, and I gotta say, I would gladly pay top dollar at any restaurant for big bowl of stew this good.

I floured the meat & sautéed in butter. Used carrots in place of parsnips.

Great dish---but I would say if you do plan on cooking this dish---DO NOT use the recommended 3 onions--I'd say use 1 at the very most.

I thought this was a great recipe!  My hubby didn't care for it as much as my regular beef stew recipe I've made for him with beef.  I usually just use a dry package mix and build with the veggies, etc.  Lately, that has been giving me heartburn.  I was thrilled when I tasted this!  He said it wasn't salty enough.  Funny thing is, I made a mistake and grabbed the bottle of soy sauce by mistake.  Soy sauce is salty!!! :)  I later added the Worcestershire sauce.  I would highly recommend this recipe!  It really is the best stew recipe I've tasted.....ever!  Keep in mind, my hubby is very finicky and has a very bland and stubborn palate.  It's extremely hard to find new recipes that he will enjoy.  I try new recipes for my adult son and I.  If hubby happens to like it, that's an added bonus.  I might wait a few months and try this one again and see if his "taster" works better for me.    I did substitute the parsnip for carrots as others have done.  I give this the most stars possible here: FIVE STARS!  I'd give it more if I could!

Wonderful stew recipe. I always change up things a little, so for us I used beef and veggie or chicken broth instead of the 3 cups of water. Added carrots and only used 1 onion.

Wonderful! and easy.  I used beef broth and i browned my meat in flour.  that allowed me to omit the final step in the process.  I used carrots.  i will use this recipe again and again

I married a hunter so I'm trying to learn to cook venison.  I wasn't a big fan at first, but after I've made a few recipes like this I'm beginning to enjoy it.  I actually used venison steak and it turned out very tender.  Thanks!

This stew was really good.  You couldn't even tell it was venison, there was not a gamey taste at all.  It takes a long time in the slow cooker, but it's well worth it.
