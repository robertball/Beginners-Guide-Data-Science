Great recipe.  Things I like about it:  simple, quick, healthy.  I used about 1/2 lb chicken as we are not big meat eaters, and it was plenty.  Instead of jar of pasta sauce (which I don't like) I used one can Italian-seasoned diced tomatoes and one 8oz can tomato sauce and it was perfect. If you like Quinoa, try the Black Beans and Quinoa recipe on this site ... excellent.

I LOVE this dish.  It is so versatile, and incredibly simple to prepare.  Instead of peas, we like to substitute spring veggies or mixed veggies. You can also use different flavors of spaghetti sauce to change it up a bit.  Serve with a spring mix salad and yeast rolls and you have a great, filling dinner that even some of the pickiest kids will eat!

Delicious and easy.  If you follow this recipe exactly, it comes out perfectly.  Really simple meal to make after work.  I added 2 cloves minced garlic for extra taste.  I recommend this one!

Thanks for a great recipe!  It was something different and a great way to use quinoa.  I actually made my italian sauce from scratch to decrease the sodium in the dish.  I also seasoned my chicken tenders with garlic Mrs. Dash to give more flavor.  It is a great weeknight dish that is easy to prepare and filling.

Not sure what about this recipe I liked the least, I think it's the veggie smart sauce.  I doubled the recipe to 8, which made way too much quinoa.  The taste was bland.  I also had a horrible time finding quinoa, finally found it at Whole Foods.  I won't be making this agin...

I really enjoyed this! I only put in one cup of chicken broth, though, since I like a thicker sauce.

I prepair quinoa often but I have never prepaired it like this so I thought that I would try it.  I soaked my quinoa ahead of time, which is a trick that I have learned and followed the directions as stated, with all of the ingredients that are listed.  I changed the recipe to serve 4 people, but even then it made wayyy to much.  I was surprised because this was pretty gross.  My husband, who loves quinoa, wouldn't finish it.  I was very dissapointed and I feel like it was a waste of time and a huge waste of ingredients.

Too soupy. I wanted to try a quinoa dish as an alternative to rice, but I ended up having to serve this over rice anyway because it was too runny to serve alone yet not liquid enough to pass for a soup. The flavor was okay but on the bland side even though I added onion, garlic, salt and pepper.

There are four in my family 2 liked it and two didn't. Although it was our first time ever using or eating Quinoa. I liked it and plan to try other recipes with Quinoa since it was so healthy.

Our family loved this recipe.  You have to follow the directions for the quinoa, no soaking, just dump it in.  I used a spicy garlic spaghetti sauce, and cooked everything until the liquid was absorbed.  It does make a lot, but it's great to take for lunches the next day or two.  I'm passing this on to my niece who is vegetarian.  Change the chicken broth to vegetable broth and add tofu or just leave the meat out totally, and it will be a great recipe for her!

EASY, Tasty & Filling.  Since quinoa is a new food/taste to my family, I was looking for a fairly simple and tasty dish to present it to them.  All but my picky 7 year old enjoyed this dish! Based on a couple of reviews that mentioned not liking the Veggie Smart sauce and the blandness of the recipe, I did add just a few things to it. [I am a far cry from a master chef so don't expect anything major. ;-) ]  
1) I added salt, pepper and minced garlic to the skillet while browning the chicken to give it a little flavor.
2) I used regular paprika since I didn't have any smoked.
3) I used the recommended amount of chicken stock but just used the local grocery store's organic version.
4) I used one of my kids' favorite jarred sauces from Bertolli. 
The results were great and I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe was a very nice quick and easy throw together kind of meal. I wasn't overly thrilled with it and wish I would have added some garlic. My 3 young children however ate it, and two of them are picky! It's healthy,easy, and budget friendly. I'll be keeping this one for future use.

Second time I've made this.  The quinoa took a very long time to cook, (at least 40 minutes and then wasn't fully done.  Didn't taste as good as the first time I made it.

I believe the ingredients did not list all the seasonings for this recipe. I found it was bland and dry. I would not serve this to my family again.

I am not a big fan of quinoa, I've tried to cook it a few different ways.. this was the best I have done. I cut up bnls skls chicken breast and let it sit in some evoo, garlic, minced onion, paparika and a little black pepper for about 30 min. Used 1c broth, per other reviewer, and Prego "Chunky Garden- tomato, onion and garlic". Had to cook longer for my quinoa to be done.. but good, easy dish. Sprinkled grated parm on top.

Alright.  Was first time cooking quinoa and I think it went well.  Didn't have chicken broth, so subbed beef broth.  Omitted peas (family doesn't like them) and used some basic spaghetti sauce from the cabinet.  Didn't take long at all to cook.  Accidently cooked my chicken all the way through in the first step, but did allow a little time for the chicken to simmer with the quinoa.
