If you like the nutty quinoa flavor, you'll enjoy this decadent preparation.

I followed the recipe except I did not put the bread crumbs or tomato on top.  It really was delicious.  Very cheesy and creamy.  The only thing I will do different next time is make a half recipe.  It made a lot.  Quinoa is much more filling than macaroni so our family of 3 barely ate a 3rd of it and we all had 2nd helpings.

Before I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, oven baked smoked Gouda mac and cheese was one of my go to dishes. Pasta has too many carbs for me these days, and this recipe is a delicious, less carb alternative. I used almond milk because it has fewer carbs than milk, and, after reading the other reviews, I opted to add 1/4 teaspoon of smoked paprika, and it tasted just right. I might add more tomato and less cheese the next go around, just to see. Also, like most mac and cheese recipes, this one would probably be good with some chopped broccoli.

I really wanted to love this, especially after reading all of the positive reviews.  I love Quinoa, and I LOVE mac n cheese, so I thought this would be amazing.  However, I really wasn't a fan of the unique Quinoa flavour combined with this dish.  I made this twice--once following the recipe (except I used 2% milk instead of skim) and decided it needed a little bit more flavour, so the second time I added some paprika, garlic and onion powder to step 5.  I also cut up the tomatoes and mixed them throughout the quinoa, and added some extra cheese, and crumbled bacon over the top.  Whole family agreed it was much better with the additions!  My husband and toddler both liked it, but as I wasn't a fan, I won't be making it again.  Thanks anyway for the new idea!

fantastic!  I made it exactly as recipe stated.  Next time I will chop up the tomatoes more.  Would be great with crumbled bacon w/ the tomatoes too.

Delicious. I love quinoa!! I admit to 2 changes. First, no tomatoes (we have an allergy in the house). Second, used crushed goldfish crackers instead of breadcrumbs as I do with all my mac n cheese. Decadent. To put it over the top use flavor blasted goldfish.

Tasty, although I would not make it with mozzarella cheese again. The flavor is not strong enough and comes out a little bland. Suggestion would be a cheese with more bite like fresh Parmesan.

Absolutely loved this recipe.  Did not change a thing (except I did not add the tomatoes since I am not a fan)!  Even brought leftovers into work and gave out 10 copies of the recipe.  Before this, no one knew what quinoa was and now they are all running to buy it!

Wow! I just served this for dinner, and my hubby just said "mmm!!!" after the first bite. He'll eat almost anything, but that's a sure sign of a hit. I scaled it down for two, but it's so delish and rich that I split one serving between the two of us with a salad on the side. Oh, darn, we'll have to have this again, cause it took extreme willpower not to scarf it all up. I made it as written but used 2% milk cause that's all I had, and I sprinkled on some bacon lardons (which I always keep on hand, pre-cooked in the fridge) before the tomatoes (one large roma, seeded and diced). It kind of tasted like a classy BLT. Yummy, and a definite addition to the faves! I look forward to playing around with this by using veggie stock and adding diced jalape√±os and cumin, then garnishing with cilantro. This is now my fave quinoa recipe. Thanks SO much for sharing!!!
