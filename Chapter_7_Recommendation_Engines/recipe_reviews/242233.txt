My husband and I both really loved this! I gave it 4 stars because I did make a change based on preference. I added a Tbsp. of honey to the sauce after removing it from the heat to make the taste a little less bitter. I'm glad I made the change! Also, I didn't have any lemons so I skipped on that as well. In the end, it turned out great and will go down as one of my favorite salmon dishes!

I'm supposing that if you are considering making this recipe that you like those ingredients for the sauce.  In that case, I highly recommend that you double it because it is just that good!  It can be made ahead, leaving you plenty of time for any other tasks you have before serving dinner.  The only change I made was to use a touch of tarragon in place of the chervil called for because I don't normally have that.  We really loved the quartered lemon that went into the sauce, so don't skimp on that!  Thank you so much!  I want to have this again this week!  That says it all, I believe!

I had to cook this fillet about 4 min longer than the recipe called for.  This is the second time I cooked a similar sized fillet. The first time, I stopped at five and it was almost like eating sushi.  The lemon dill sauce needs lots of dill. Probably like 3 Tbsp.

I'm a big fan of lemon and dill on salmon, my BF not so much.  I used a bit of tarragon as I didn't have the chervil and I wish I had used a bit more cornstarch or less water as I felt the sauce was too thin.  My BF like the grilled lemon but not the lemon slices in the sauce as he felt it too lemon forward.
