I had this recipe years ago and lost it.  So I came to this sight to see if I could find it.  I am very happy to have it again, as I really liked it and would take it to holiday luncheons and just substitute dried cranberries for raisens.  Everyone always liked it.  I was craving it again.

This recipe was a smash at my Moms birthday picnic! She just raves about it. Very refreshing and lite on a hot day. Like that it didnt have bacon. Made a few changes: Used Dried cranberries instead of raisens and used orange juice (fresh sqeezed) instead of lemon juice. Also only used 1 tbs of sugar since orange juice is sweeter than lemon.

Very big hit at a number of different parties. I love this salad so much and often want leftovers, but there aren't any! It is lighter than the traditional version which is all mayonnaise (no yogurt) and also has bacon. This is much nicer. I usually add more broccoli than this recipe calls for as the amount of dressing is quite generous.

I've been using this recipe for years   These are my modifications: omit feta cheese and sunflower seeds. I have been asked and asked and asked for this recipe!  People who say they hate salads love this recipe!

Awesome salad! I didn't have any yogurt on hand, so I used all mayo. And the lemon juice struck me as odd for some reason, so I subbed apple cider vinegar instead (only 1/2T). I also used only a 1/2T of sugar, and that, along with the apple cider vinegar, made it sweet enough.    The feta in this recipe is wonderful. And like others, I used dried cranberries instead of raisins. I knew I wouldn't be able to eat all of this salad by myself, so I kept the broccoli separate from the "dressing." Outstanding recipe! Next time, I'll throw in some crumbled turkey bacon! Thanks!

Great salad for a party. I substitued light sour cream for yogurt and added crasins instead of raisins. Also, I used dry roasted sunflower seeds for a little smoky favor. Delicious and colorful.

I took this to a church picnic & didn't bring any leftovers home, so that's always a good sign.  :)  The changes I made were minimal: used low fat greek yogurt and used a bit more lemon juice than called for.  Next time I might cut back on the onions a little, but that is just a personal preferance.  Thanks for sharing such an easy & tasty recipe!

This is a good, quick and easy recipe.  I only made a few changes: added crumbled bacon and diced cooked chicken, and used shredded cheddar cheese instead of the feta.  Delicious!

I played with the proportions a bit, did 1 tsp of honey in place of some of the sugar, and did add about 8 slices of crumbled bacon to the top. I hate mayonnaise, but you can't taste it in this salad - I think "cutting" it with yogurt helped.

Delicious!!  Add bacon!!! Didn't have any feta though and used golden raisins as I don't like regular ones.  Came out great!!  Will definitely use again. Maybe trying dried cranberries instead of raisins next time.  And adding walnuts next time too.  Thanks for sharing!!!

This is an excellent salad to take to a cookout or potluck if you are looking to take something different.  I don't like showing up with a typical dish such as potato salad so I tried this.  It was a great hit and I had people begging for the recipe.  I replaced the raisins with dried cranberries and added real bacon bits.  Delicious!

This is a great potluck recipe.  It saves in the fridge for a couple days.
Dried cranberries or dried cherries are a nice alternative, taste-wise and also for colour.
Instead of all sugar, I've used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 stevia or sucralose.
The dressing is a bit too much - if you're making a batch of 3x, only make 2x of the dressing.

We thought this was ok, not great.  My husband thought it was too sweet, and I added about half the sugar called for.  I added more feta for our taste.  It would be good for a summer pot luck.

This is a great salad! I love broccoli salads, but the typical recipe is pretty unhealthy. This one looked a bit better than most, with yogurt instead of all that mayonnaise and lighter on some of the other ingredients that make these salads so heavy and fattening. I personally don't care for raisins in this salad, and I also don't like (and didn't have any) feta cheese, so I skipped both of those ingredients.  As the submitter suggested, I added about 4 strips of crumbled bacon, to add some extra flavor. It came out absolutely delicious this way, and pretty healthy as well. Thanks for sharing this...I'll be making it again!

This was a very tasty treat for those hot summer days. I'm not too fond of the yogurt flavor in the dressing, but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

I served this for a friend lunch visit and it was a success. I omitted the raisins for cranberries and used chocolate yogurt since that's what I had on hand. I liked the addition of feta cheese.

I have to make a double recipe of this as my other half and son eat it up really quickly. My other half's son eats broccoli only this way. He has always driven me nuts with his pickiness and non veggie eating habits. I may have to triple the recipe in the future. I use craisin and lots of bacon. I also use vanilla greek yogurt and 1/2 the sugar as it is sweeter. If I don't have feta cheese I use cotija which I always have on hand.

I added bacon bits, but other than that it was an awesome salad.  I make a batch for snacking on instead of eating a bag of Cheetos.  Not only is it delicious, but I could feel my body respond better to healthier eating.  Basically I felt great physically after eating this salad versus junk food.

Didn't work for me? Feta cheese is odd in this salad. I think it has potential and I also like that it is lower in calories and fat than several other recipes. I will change it drastically next time I make it.

Easy salad that everyone (even kids) will like! I made a couple of updates:
- Cut florets to very small pieces
- Used dried cranberries instead of raisins and cut the sugar
- Added more Feta and cut out the extra salt

I have made this many, many times.  I often double the recipe and bring it to pot luck dinners.  I have also added 'craisins' instead of raisins, and salted pumpkin seeds instead of sunflower seeds.

This is the same recipe that my Mum uses for broccoli salad and it's my favourite version. She typed it out for me several years ago, lost hers, and had to call me for the dressing ingredients! My sister has been replacing the feta with grated cheddar and it adds a nice flavour. Thanks for posting, kelcampbell!

Added 1 tsp of organic sugar because it's not at sweet. I don't think I will add any sugar next time. Does not need it.

We loved the salad. It was a little sweet, next time we will add less sughr. We like the idea of using cranberries. We added chicken to the salad and made a meal out of it.

perfect!! I used bacon in place of the cheese and dried cranberries in place of the raisins.  Left out the onion so my husband would eat it. Wonderful recipe!

This is a nice, refreshing salad that would be great for on the go. The preparation time is quick, about 10 minutes. Instead of using the sunflower seeds, I used the sunflower kernels, and I also substituted American cheese instead of feta cheese. This is a light, healthy dish. For the sauce you could also not add the sugar to make it healthier. This would also be great for summer, on those hot days in the sun.

Just made this as a side dish for dinner tonight! I doubled the recipe so I would have leftovers for lunch this week. And I used plain GREEK yogurt instead of regular yogurt and Splenda instead of white sugar. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!!!!! :)

This dressing is perfect.  I only had almonds & goat cheese so substituted those, I didn't chop the raisins & I added orange slices & this was a great salad.

LOVE this salad.  The yogurt was wonderful; I used Greek yogurt and that added a tangy flavor as well.  A definite keeper for my family and to take to picnics as well.

Definite keeper.  Love that it's light.  We used cheddar cheese, craisins, and 6 cups of fresh broccoli florets.

this is great! I changed it to my diet and it was terrific.  I used chopped almonds instead of raisins, used fat free plain yogurt, low fat feta and turkey bacon diced.  I also used 1/2 packet of splenda instead of the sugar.  My husband loved it as much as I did.  thanks
