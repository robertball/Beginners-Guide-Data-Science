This was soooooo good!  I had to make some changes because I didn't have all the stuff.  So: ground turkey instead of chicken, half can cream of mushroom plus half can cheddar cheese soup instead of sour cream, salsa instead of tomatoes.  And then I didn't have black beans so I spread some refried beans on the top before adding the cheese.  Also, on the advice of the other review, I skipped the cinnamon.  I noticed that I also forgot the salt and pepper after it was done, but I don't think that hurt it.  This was really good, really a lot of food!

This was a good recipe. My family loved it except for the high calorie content.In the future, I will cut the amount of cheese and torn tortillas in half. Also, a 9x13 baking dish is not big enough. I used a 9x15x3 deep, and the recipe filled it to the brim. I will drop the cinnamon next time also. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was pretty good.

This was an excellent Mexican casserole.  I didn't have enough tortillas so I crushed some tortilla chips and mixed with the cheese. It made a crispy top that my kids enjoyed.

This was really good and easy to make.  I didn't have everything, so I made some substitutions.  Instead of tomatoes, I used a combination of red and green salsa.  We had a pot of black beans so I just used those....no other beans.  It was delicious!

I was just not impressed. I am sure it is just my personal preference.
