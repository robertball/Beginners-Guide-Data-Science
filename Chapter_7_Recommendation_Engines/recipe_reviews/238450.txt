Honey isn't vegan so I sadly couldn't eat it but my family loved it! Please don't put in the title 'vegan' if it's not. Thanks

I loved this recipe! They are crunchy on the sides and chewy in the center. I made one batch with walnuts and one with pecans(fresh from the backyard) and both were delicious. I also added extra dates because i felt the original did not have enough and that was my most favorite part of these bars. I used a shallow small cookie sheet for my first batch and i think that worked a lot better; it was easier to cut and fill. The cookie sheet also made them a lot thinner which made them crispier instead of mushy. This is a super easy recipe!

Surprisingly good. I used apricots, honey and cinnamon in place of  the dates, agave nectar, and nutmeg.

I was looking for recipes to use overripe bananas plus rolled oats and found this. While not looking for vegan specifically, I found this recipe simple and easy to make. I substituted slivered almonds for the walnuts and replaced the honey with 2-tablespoons of granulated Splenda. The ripe bananas give it plenty of sweetness.
