This cake was very very delicious.  I made with 1 1/2 cups fresh strawberries diced up fine instead of the frozen and I took in other sugg and used a french vanilla cake mix.  I doubled the recipe as well and only used one box of the gelatin and it was perfect. I made 3- 9 inch round cakes and my kids made a bunch of heart cupcakes for themselves.  I used vanilla instant vanilla pudding for the filling and topped with "whipped cream cream cheese frosting" from this site.  Out of this world cake! Everyone ate it up.

I got RAVE reviews at work with the cake.  I actually had some co-workers upset because it went so quick and there wasn't enough for everyone. One comment was "it was the best cake he has ever had"!  I used the pinapple filling recipe from this site and just subsituted strawberries for the pinapple and then used a traditional buttercream frosting with strained strawberry puree instead of milk or water.

Excellent. I made a few changes. I used fresh strawberries and pureed them, then omitted the oil. I actually made this into cupcakes and they are excellent. They baked for about 21 minutes

I have been told I make excellent cakes and after reading the reviews on this
cake I decided to make it.  Maybe it was my fault but I had to throw this cake out
it was awful.  Sickening sweet.

I made this for a bridal shower it was a big hit. Many people asked me for the recipe. I doubled the ingredients, except for the gelatin as other reviewers said it was too sweet. I made a three layer 9" cake and then about a dozen cupcakes. (I used vanilla pudding for the filling and smothered it with two whipped up containers of cream cheese frosting. Pile pink carnations on the top and it almost looks as good as it tastes!) Thanks for the recipe!

This was a fantastic cake!!!  i used a bit more strawberries than the receipe called for and I made a frosting which was white icing and cool whip and then dazzled it up with shaved white chocolate.  Quite a site!

I plan to make this for my daughters birthday cake.

After trying several strawberry cake recipes, this one was the best.  I used fresh garden strawberries and will definitely use this recipe again.

Made this for my daughter's 5th birthday party.  I pureed 1 cup of diced fresh strawberries (rather than frozen) and substituted the white cake mix with french vanilla (per other members' suggestions).  I whipped white icing and Cool Whip to ice the cake and decorated with fresh strawberries.  It was a hit with the kids and many adults.  I only gave it four stars, though, because I personally felt it was overly sweet.

Great cake!  This recipe is very similar to one that I use from 'The Cake Mix Doctor' book, which also uses gelatin.  I had been searching for a way to make a strawberry cake with enough flavor but without having to add to many fresh strawberries (which makes the cake very dense and heavy).  The only changes I made to this reipe were as follows:  only 3 eggs, add one cup of sour cream (makes the cake very moist), one cup of mashed strawberries (about 1 and a half cups whole), and only two T. flour.  I usually make a double layer, torte the two layers, and fill them with a strawberry glaze or whipped cream.

I love this cake. Growing up every year for my bithday my grandma would make me a strawberry cake and as I got older she got older and has been unable to make. I found this receipe, I made a 16 inch round, and I barely had enough for 20 people. Everyone raved about this cake. For the last 3 years I have been making strawberry cake for my son's birthday. I have tried lots of strawberry receipes and this has been the best one so far. I tried this receipe because of the buttermilk, I figured it was something different. 
Since trying this receipe I have decided to keep the tradition going and my 3 young boys are having strawberry cake as well for their birthday. 
As far as icing I used butter, confectioners sugar, and strawberry puree. I started with 1 stick of butter, 3 tablespoons of puree, did not measure confec. sugar just kept adding,and mixing until it was thick. 
What a delightful sugar rush..

I was inspired by the gelatin for the most part and didn't use most of the other key ingredients listed here so you can ignore my review if you wish. As per request, I used 1 package of French Vanilla cake mix and only 1 oz strawberry flavored gelatin as a prophylactic against an overbearingly sweet cake. I also used 1 cup of milk, 1/3 cup of butter, 4 eggs, and sandwiched strawberry pie filling between 2 cake layers in lieu of mixing in frozen strawberries to the cake batter.

I frosted the cake with Kristen Pontier's French Buttercream frosting recipe, which can be found on this site, then coated with crushed french vanilla wafers and peanuts.

I made this cake on a Thursday night and the leftovers tasted better on Saturday morning. By then, the frosting and cake were well-married. The cake itself was firm but still very moist and perfectly sweet.  It wasn't the best cake I've ever tasted... but I didn't really follow this recipe so I may have missed out! One of my co-workers said he didn't believe that I made it and said I bought it from a bakery! Another said she usually hates "fruit" cakes but loved this one.

I've uploaded a photo of my cake.

Loved this!  I would use more frozen strawberries, and I had to increase the baking time by about 10 minutes.  I used a previous suggestion to put the whipped cream cream cheese frosting on top (on allrecipes.com) and then I topped it with quartered fresh strawberries.  It was a hit!

I just made this cake today, and it is sooo good!  I read other reviews and used French Vanilla cake mix and only half a packet of sugar-free strawberry jello.  I baked it for 24 minutes in two 9-inch round pans.  I also defrosted and pureed the strawberries (about 1 cup).  I mixed all the liquid ingredients first and then stirred in the dry.  Mine didn't turn out the bright color of the picture, but more of a pretty medium pink color.  I also frosted with the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting recipe from this site.  Try this recipe!  : )

Great recipe! I also modified it a bit. I also halved the amount of strawberry jello. Additionally, I used a butter cake mix instead and added a softened stick of butter to the batter. I used frozen strawberries in syrup. After they thawed, I drained the juice into a cup and saved it. After the cake had baked in the oven, I poked holes through the cake with a large toothpick and drizzled the juice across the top, then "frosted" with cool whip. Fabulous! The butter and strawberry juice made it so moist.

I made this cake for my daughter's 5th birthday.  It turned out quite yummy (and pink). Per others' suggestions, I used fresh strawberries (1 1/2 cups, diced) instead of frozen, and a french vanilla cake mix. As some reviewers said, it was a touch too sweet, so I think I'll cut down on the strawberry jello mix next time.  Made 2- 9" rounds and baked for 25 minutes. Came out moist and perfectly cooked.  Frosted with buttercream frosting tinted pink~very pretty.  Will definitely make again!

This is a WONDERFUL cake. I have used this for the past two kids birthday cake and then I use the wedding cake icing recipe off this site. It's wonderful. I put sliced strawberries and their juice in here and it makes it even better! I also use a mixer for mixing the cake, makes it cook more evenly.

EXCELLENT EXCELLENT recipe.  Very easy.  I doubled this recipe and used a total of 10 oz. frozen strawberries.  If you place the frozen strawberries in a bowl and cover with warm water, they will that in just enough time to add at the end.  I did cook a little longer than indicated.  They are perfect!

This was very good.  I had to cook it about 10 minutes longer that instructed.  Also, the cake was concave in the middle for some reason.  I iced it with chocolate icing and put fresh strawberries on top and all said it was delicous. I think I'd use the whole carton (10 oz.) strawberries (drained) next time instead of just 4 oz.

I've made this cake and another similar for two of my boys' b-days cakes. It is fab! 
I wonder if the woman who said it was "sickening sweet and had to throw it out" used sweetened strawberries?  That would definitely make it overly sweet. Use fresh or flash frozen - no sugar.

I made this for my little sister's birthday! I used added vanilla pudding between the two layers and used cream cheese frosting with strawberries on top. My sister loved it and my dad said it was the best cake he's had in a long time! It turned out great :)

Yummy and easy cake! I didn't have buttermilk, so I added 1Tbs. to 2% milk and let it sit for 5 minutes before adding it to the mix--a perfect buttermilk substitute anytime. I also used about 3/4 cup of fresh strawberries from the garden (the kind that are juicy, sweet, & red on the INSIDE too!), and minced them before adding them to the batter. I topped my cake with the lemon glaze from the "Lemon Glazed Cake" recipe and it was a nice Strawberry-Lemon pairing, though pretty sweet/tart! Might have liked some not-too-sweet whipped cream with it, to cut the sweet/tartness a bit or just use cream cheese frosting instead next time.  I gave it 4 stars because I think fresh strawberries are in order, and it doesn't suggest a topping/frosting/pairing to serve it with. Enjoy!

The cake was so so for me.  I used the whole gelatin but used cut up fresh strawberries instead of frozen.  I frosted the cake with chocolate pudding and coolwhip mixed together.

This was a great looking cake- super bright pink!  However I found it to be a little too sweet for my taste.

A very pink cake!  This would be fun for kids but I thought it was a little too sweet because it had the recognizable Jello flavor to it.   The real strawberries are tasty but they make it a bit soggy.

Very easy and pretty cupcakes and the flavor was nice, just a little dry.  Maybe I added too much flour?  Will try again with more strawberries and/or less flour.  Smelled fabulous while baking though!

This was very good.  I don't like Strawberry Cake, but I made it for my Mom (it's her favorite).  I didn't have buttermilk, but did the substitution method (1 T. vinegar or lemon juice to 1 c. milk) and it seemd to work fine.  My cake fell quite a bit in the middle and I had to cook it longer than recipe states AND I messed up (my fault...I'm NOT a "Baker" hee hee) on my frosting (salvagable), but the CAKE ITSELF was GREAT!!  Will make again using another type of frosting ~ Thanks a bunch!

Absolutely delicious! I got raving compliments over this cake and it is so easy to make. I used about 1 cup diced fresh strawberries in the batter instead of frozen. Frosted with Betty's Light and Fluffy White icing and garnished with strawberries and mint leaves - i wish I would've taken a picture. Everyone commented on how moist the cake was and I think it is due to using fresh strawberries. Will def keep this one for a summertime dessert!

I used a yellow butter cake mix that worked perfectly. I also used an entire box of gelatin and I didn't fine it too sweet as many have said. I think a cake is suppose to be sweet, so call me crazy for my thinking. Anyway, I also added a one tsp of vanilla flavoring which I always add to box cake mixes. I used a 9 X 13 pan along with fresh strawberries that I pureed. Lastly, I just put a powered sugar glaze that I make up that includes milk, butter and vanilla along with the powered sugar. It's light and goes very well. I will try the whipped cream cheese frosting eventually.

I rated a 4 because I based my recipe on this one. I do not use box mixed cake. Instead I used grandma's recipe and did as Miss Molly said. I used a little over a pint of strawberries, pureed and used that instead of the oil. Fantastic without the fat! My use more strawberies next time. I tried finding a recipe with out gelitin, first because I din't have it, and second, I thought was was the point of it. 
Thanks so much for sharing your recipe.

We did not like this cake. It came out really dry although I followed the recipe exactly, had to pry it out of the pan in chunks. And we all thought it was too sweet.

I followed other reviewers advice and only used half of the strawberry jello, but kept everything else the same.  I made this for a friends birthday, and did not get to try any of it, so I am basing my review on how much they liked it.

Very good!  Questioned whether the jello would give a fake flavor, but delicious.  Made in two layers--Also used the pineapple filling (substituting strawberries) and frosted w/ cream cheese icing! Will make again!

This recipe was great, I just made a few changes & took a few suggestions to make it more healthful and it was still amazing, I made it for my friend's 25th birthday and it got raves!  I used unsweet apple sauce in the place of the oil, 2 eggs and 2 egg whites instead of 4 whole eggs and I used half a .6 oz package sugar-free strawberry jello and it was just right.  For the filling I used the recipe for pineapple cake filling on here and substituted chopped, thawed frozen strawberries for the pineapple but still used the pineapple jiuce andI used Splenda instead of white sugar.  And finally for the frosting I used the recipe for Cool Whipped Frosting on here, but used White Chocolate Pudding mix instead of Vanilla and I used Free Cool Whip for the container of whipped topping.  I garnished the cake with fresh strawberry slices and just a touch of white chocolate shavings.  The cake ended up being a treat for the tastebuds and the eyes, and it wasn't terribly guilt inducing.

This is so much better than boxed strawberry cake mix!!!  The only thing I changed was to double the amount of strawberries (4 ounces only equaled 3 large flash frozen berries) and I pureed them so there were no icky wet chunks of berries.  Love this cake paired with cream cheese icing!

I loved this cake! I made it for a little girl's party and everyone absolutely loved it. I expected it to be really sweet, as another reviewer stated but it wasn't overly sweet at all. I don't even like strawberry cake and I couldn't stay out of this! Excellent.

This is a great cake. It is quite sweet, but we loved it. I used a vanilla cake mix and followed the recipe with the exception of the berries. I used a mixed bag of frozen berries (strawberries, raspberries and blueberries) and pureed them. I folded the berries into the batter and baked for about 40 minutes. I frosted this with a vanilla frosting but wish I hadn't used frosting at all. Because the cake is so sweet it would be much better if left unfrosted and served with fresh or pureed berries spooned over the top. This is a really good cake recipe and we really enjoyed the flavor. The mixed berry puree gave mine a pink/purple color that the kids loved.

This cake was delightfully flavorful and moist.  I used the french vanilla cake mix and frozen strawberries which I drained first.  Also made the whipped cream cream cheese frosting, and will use a more traditional cream cheese frosting next time.

I made this with homemade chocolate frosting between the layers, a buttercream icing mixed with strawberry jam (seedless), and topped it with chocolate-covered strawberries for a chocolate-covered-strawberry cake.  Yum!

I work in food service and made this cake for the staff.  They raved!  I use industrial cake mix so I had to adjust the recipe.  The strawberries were individually frozen so they weren't over juicy. It wasn't too heavy and turned out just right.  Can't wait to try it at home.

The cake was not as moist as I anticipated...I  use powered buttermilk so maybe that affected the cake.  I will definitely try the recipe again with liquid buttermilk.

Used half the box and fresh strawberries, but found this tasteless?!? I'm soooo upset. I make cupcakes allll the time and had a request for strawberry. After reading the reviews I thought this would be the winner! I should have tasted the cake before frosting,  Maybe it was the buttermilk? The cake tasted 'eggy'... So sad

I read other reviews about the sweetness of this cake, so I used 1/3 box of jello mix instead of the whole box. Also, I pureed a whole container of strawberries to mix into the batter. Also, I used fresh strawberries instead of frozen. I used a buttercake mix and included a stick of butter in the batter (not the healthiest...but it was for Valentine's day...it's a special occasion!!) I used a buttercream icing (storebought) and put fresh raspberries and strawberries on top. It came out beautifully & the cake was soft, moist, and not too sweet. You could really taste the real strawberries in the mix. Overall, this is a great cake for something a little out of the ordinary!

This is soooooo-oo yummy. I used the Rich Chocolate Frosting recipe for the frosting. I'm so happy to find a recipe that calls for frozen strawberries, I bought a bunch for 50 cents a bag!

This recipe turned out pretty good expect I followed the directions on the cake mix instead of adding the extra oil and eggs. I baked them in mini square pans and they turned out really cute and bright pink!  If your brave try adding a few drops of almond extract for extra taste.

I baked this cake for my niece's birthday and it was a huge hit! Even those who don't typically like strawberry cake came back for seconds.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I followed the reviewers suggestion and used only half of the jello. It would have been too sweet for my family with the whole packet.  I'll definitely be making this again!

This cake is dangerous!  Made it exactly per the recipe, topped each piece Reddi-Whip and thawed strawberry/blueberry mixture.  My husband ate 3 pieces!!  Will definitely make again.

Wonderful! Even though the strawberries were thawed, they were still whole; so I did beat the batter until it was well blended. The cupcakes and the loaf I made from the batter were very fluffy, moist and delicious even with out icing!

I made these as cupcakes for this past mother's day and they were a HUGE hit!!  It's made with store bought ingredients and with the fresh strawberries baked into them, they really had a from scratch feel.  I used half the gelatin and have made this with yellow cake mix and white cake mix.  Both are great! I also used the "Cream cheese Frosting II" from this website and went together perfectly!!  I'm working on a batch right now for my boyfriend's birthday! I never liked strawberry cake before this too! This is a must try!

I am not a big strawberry cake fan, and I thought this this cake was just okay - not amazing as many reviewers claimed. Maybe it's because I don't care for strawberry cake. I followed the recipe exactly (except sub French Vanilla cake for white) and frosted the cake with a mixture of cool whip, cream cheese and strawberry jelly.

Absolutley Divine !!!  I made this cake for my sons birthday and everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe.  I did as other posters did and used 1 1/2 C. fresh strawberries and doubled the recipe.  I could have eaten the whole thing myself.  Wonderful recipe !

when i read all the positive reviews i expected this cake to be delicious, the best strawberry cake ever.  But it wasn't all that.  I used fresh strawberries instead and used french vanilla cake mix. The cake was soft, but the flavor was somewhat unusual. Somewhat bland, not much of a flavor.  Regular strawberry cake mix actually tastes better than this recipe.   Its not a cake that I would make again.

The strawberry pieces in the batter turned out well. The frosting was great. The strawberries that I put on top sweated and dripped pink water on the top of the cake. Served this for bunko and the entire cake got eaten. Not my favorite, only because I know I can do better, but it certainly wasn't bad. Good for Vday or a little girl's birthday.

I made these into cupcakes for my husband's birthday because he loves strawberry cake.  These were ok for us.  I followed the directions and only made a few minor substitutions which could have caused my lowere rating.  They had an almost bitter taste or like something was missing.  I used sugar-free jellow and french vanilla cake mix.  I blended fresh strawberries and used 8oz in the mix to give a real strawberry taste.  We topped the cupcakes with whipped cream and fresh stawberries.  They were moist and tasted good but not what I was expecting.  I will probably try another recipe before I use this one again.

A little sweet for my taste, but it was a big hit at Bible study. I made this as cupcakes and cooked them for 12 minutes, but they could have used more time... maybe more like 14. I topped them with cream cheese frosting. Mmmm!

Great! I used french vanilla cake, the entire 16 oz package of thawed-frozen strawberries,  and 1/2 of the jello packet as other members suggested. I made it for my nephew's birthday party and again for my best friends party. Excellent reviews.

Delish!! I used a french vanilla cake as others suggested and frosted with Whipped Cream Cheese frosting from this site. It was perfect. The only change I will make next time is to use the entire 16 oz. package of strawberries.

Very good!! I haven't even tried it yet but based on the batter (yes I always taste the batter) I know it will be delicious.  I used french vanilla cake mix and half the gelatin as others suggested. Yes, half the gelatin is plenty -- I'm in my 20s and definitely not afraid of sweetness but forgot how sweet straight gelatin was. I didn't have buttermilk so used a little less than half a cup of milk..I'm no cook so I hoped it would be a decent replacement.  I just put the strawberries in with the batter and the mixer cut the pieces small enough. I also used this for cupcakes and it seemed like parts of the cupcake hadn't cooked all the way or were moist..not sure if it was b/c of the milk or what but I don't mind that.  The reason I made this was because I had bought the duncan hines strawberry cake mix but got the idea to look up how to make a strawberry cake "from scratch" and found this.  However, I'm going to use the recipe for icing from their "strawberry refrigerator cake" which uses vanilla pudding and cool whip as the icing. Thanks for a good recipe

Made this for a co-worker's birthday and it was awesome! Sweet but not too sweet. Next time I think I'll try it with fresh strawberries instead of frozen.

WOW!  This was excellent.  Followed the recipe to the letter and the cake was perfect.   Just had to cook it longer then stated - about 50 minutes.  I made this with the whipped cream cheese frosting recipie from this site and there was NO cake left and many asked for the recipe.  This is a keeper!

I made this for Easter and got raves about it. I've made many strawberry cakes but this is the best. I even had one friend ask me to bake it for her wedding cake!!

I'm a beginner baker and decided to try this recipe out. I made cupcakes rather than cake, and I didn't use any strawberries due to their price (being out of season and all). I also didn't pay close enough attention to the ingredients and ended up with approximately 2 1/2, or slightly less, ounces of gelatin rather than 3. Vegetable oil was also substituted with canola oil, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  The batter was thick (though looked beautiful!), and I worried the cupcakes would end up dry -- and they did. I'm not sure how to fix that, not knowing much about baking. They taste great though, and they smell fantastic! They're sweet with a slightly tart taste from the gelatin. I iced them with a mixture of icing sugar and milk (and one drop of red food colouring to make it a nice pale pink colour). I'll definitely make these again with real strawberries once I get the chance. Did I mention they smell fantastic?

I followed this recipe exactly and I was surprised at how thick the batter was. I baked this recipe in a 6x6 and a 4.4x4.5 pan and it burned on the top and was still batter in the middle. I threw it out. This may have worked in a 9x13 pan but most cake recipes are more versatile.

This is a great version of this classic recipe. I chose to try this one over my original, that I've used for years, because of the buttermilk. I find that buttermilk gives baked goods a nice texture. Will use this recipe again!

I own a small cake business and received an order for strawberry cake which I had never made before.  Your recipe seemed simple. I used a different icing recipe with marshmallow in it.  I just heard from my customer.  She said the cake was delicious and it reminded her of one from her childhood.  This is a keeper.

Oh, man, this cake was to die for!!  I pureed 1.5 cup frozen strawberries and used a French Vanilla cake mix, then followed the rest of the recipe to a "T".  Came out so moist and delicious. Followed others suggestions and topped it with Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting. YUMMY, A+ recipe.

Wow! This cake was good.  I served it with lemon icing and it was hard to resist.  It came out very moist and the flavor of the strawberries helped  so that it was not too sweet.

I was in the mood for something fruity rather than my usual double chocolate cake for my birthday, so my family used this recipe. It was so moist and delicious, I couldn't get enough! We topped it with a cream cheese frosting, which was a perfect combination. Will definitely make it again!

The classic strawberry cake. I baked cupcakes for 21 minutes and I would suggest less than that. Mine were a bit dry but still tasty.

Even though I sprayed my cake pan and the muffin tins, everything stuck! Flavour of cake/cupcakes was good tho. I only used 1/2 of the gelatin powder otherwise would have been too sweet.

This is not as sweet as some other strawberry cakes, so my friends really liked it better than others they have had. I didn't think it had as much flavor  as other cakes, but that could be the tartness of the buttermilk. I topped it with a mixture of frozen strawberries and chopped fresh straberries.  It really looked pretty and looked a little more homemade. I like to cheat and take credit for everything, even if I start with a mix. Hahaha.
