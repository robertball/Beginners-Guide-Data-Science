This cookie presents very well. However, I wish I would have add some type of natural apple extract, of some sort, to the cookie base. It is a very butter tasting cookie. The apple concentrate is more or less to hold the dough together. I rolled them into balls as suggested, but as they bake they flatten out. I used a cookie scoop and got 19 cookies, that I could actually bake all at once. I used 30 Lancaster caramels. When they were half way cooked down the liquid seemed like too much and I removed about 2 tbslp of the liquid and it was the right consistency. They may be a smaller caramel than what was called for in the recipe. I would very finely chop the walnuts, they are the only ones that easily stuck. I baked them on parchment and when they were almost cooled I just left them on the sheet and drizzled over the caramel. it is a rather messy process and the last 5 or 6 started to have the toothpicks slide right out. I would actually try this again, but add a natural apple extract or apple pie spice. I think a snowball type cookie base would be my choice too. Appearance wise, though, these are cute. I would like to see how others fare with this recipe and the changes they make to improve the flavor or texture.

Needs some tweaks-but cute cookies!!  I froze mine for 10 minutes, but they still spread a little. Might try baking them in my donut hole pan. WAY too much liquid in the caramel. 14oz pack of caramels w/ 1 1/2 tbsp of liquid is plenty. Also reduced apple juice by half instead of using frozen concentrate.

The name in these cookies is deceiving.  While they might look like mini caramel apples, they taste nothing like an apple.  They taste more like a shortbread cookie with caramel and nuts.  I did not experience the same thing as the others in that they did not flatten out.  They stayed round. So I made a second batch and added applesauce to the batter.  They flattened a little more but still held a good shape.  But still didn't taste the apple very much.  So I simply drizzled the caramel on top of that batch and I used chopped peanuts and sprinkled them on top.  They were decent but need to find a different name for them.  There was nothing "apple" about the flavor.
