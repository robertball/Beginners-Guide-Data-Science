I used baby porobello's and did not cut them. The taste was awesome, Husband say's I should half them. Even still he made me take the plate away because he could not stop eating them. I also used the batter to make the broccoli for fried Friday and Hubby ate more then half of the veggies.

made this tonight. batter was super easy but bland. when I added garlic salt, onion powder, smoked Spanish paprika and a hint of cayenne pepper it made it so much better. we used whole baby Portabella mushrooms to make it easier on cooking.

These were totally delicious and we will definitely have them again and again. We do Keto most of the time so I used these instead of potatoes last time I grilled steak. I used coconut and almond flour instead of wheat flour and Heinekin light beer which still has the very hoppy flavor but lots less carbs. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!
