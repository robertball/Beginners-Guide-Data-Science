I made it and took it to the office and people liked it. It made a nice big cake, but it took a whole lot longer for me to make, especially the part of cutting the cranberries in half.

I made this to take as a dessert for a BBQ. I had about 5 small navel oranges that needed to be eaten up. I decided to make this with all five oranges and no cranberries. It was a huge hit. My Husband hates cake and never eats it. He went back for seconds of this cake, (after I begged him to have a first serving to begin with.)

This cake is very good, but has a little too much orange.  If I make it again I will only use one orange instead of two.  The cake was moist, and overall the recipe is pretty good.

This was delicious! Such a great way to use those lovely fresh cranberries that call to me at the grocery store every fall.

I made this dessert for Thanksgiving this year. It was very tastey. The cake was moist and soft. I thought the cranberries were going to be too overpowering but weren't. Next time I might add 3/4 cup of o.j. instead of the 1/2 cup. This is a very good summertime recipe!
