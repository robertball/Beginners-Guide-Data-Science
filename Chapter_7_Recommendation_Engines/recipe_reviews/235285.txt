Sorry, I must have missed the 1 before the 3/4 cups of brown sugar in my recipe. It is actually 1 and 3/4 cups (1.75 cups) of brown sugar. Trying to update...

Perfect blend of tart and sweet. Did find I cooked it for about 5-10 minutes longer than stated to thicken it up a bit more.
Fortunately I did see that the recipe should have been 1 3/4 cups of sugar, I may have used closer to 2 cups.

I'm sorry, but this recipe is no good.  It was lacking in flavor and definitely needs more sugar - way too tart!

The proportions are off on this recipe. As written it was bitter! I added another cup of brown sugar and now it's edible. Actually quite good.

This is very close to the recipe I remember as a child when my Grandmother & Mother made it.
