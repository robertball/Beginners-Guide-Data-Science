I have made this salad with a few alterations that make this recipe the bomb! Substitute the flour, and use 1 heaping tablespoon of corn starch. Once the pasta and the liquid mixture have been made wait until custardy mixture and pasta cool to room temperature. Once custard is room temperature add in the whip topping, until thouroughly blended.  Then add the marshmellows, pasta, pineapple and mandarin oranges.  I omit the cherries altogether.  Whalla, I much better way of combining this salad with creamier results!  :)

My family loves this!  I took it to a potluck with friends, and they loved it too!  I had to use orzo since I couldn't find acini di pepe in my 3 local supermarkets (I live in Hilo, Hawaii).  I will definitely be making this again.

This salad is great. I followed someone elses lead and changed flour to cornstarch and cooled custard mixture to room temp then added cool whip. Easy to make. Fruity and refreshing. I will make this again!

It must be me, since most other reviewers loved this recipe. I couldn't get past the texture. For me, this type of pasta doesn't work in a fruit salad. Also I believe the addition of marshmallows puts this way over the top on sweetness. Sorry!

This is a family favorite of ours.  I always chill the pasta and liquid mixture several hours or overnight then add the whipped topping, marshmellows and fruit.  The cherries are a bit too much, so I just add the pineapple and oranges.

I was not overly impressed.  It tasted okay at first, but knowing that you're eating pasta made this unappealing.  If you can replace the pasta with something else, I'd try it again.  The rest of the ingredients work well together.

I have been making this for years and people always request me to bring it.  I am making it today for a huge family reunion tomorrow.  Sometimes I will throw in a couple cans of drained fruit cocktail or tropical fruit.  Never have added coconut.  You must refrigerate overnight the pasta and sauce.  Quit using cool whip because of the nasty  they put in it.  I use heavy whip cream now and it is delicious.  Much better in my opinion.  I keep 1/3 of it set aside and do not add marshmallows to that bowl for those who do not like that much sweetness.  The rest I add the colored marshmallows to.  The kids love that one.  We also have to keep some at home because there is never any left to take back home.

Love the taste but 447 calories?  Wow.  Wish I'd known beforehand.  To the person who disliked eating pasta in his/her salad, why not try tapioca?  More calories, but maybe the texture would be more to your liking.  We love pasta salad ... all kinds.

yummmm, we've eaten this for years.Every gathering in Utah has a version of this,you can even get it at the groc store already made.I love it as is,made in two steps overnight only substitute a can of drained pineapple tidbits for the cherries.Polite society somewhere may call it Acini di Pepe salad but us casual folks know it as Frog eye salad.

This was good, but for my taste there was too much whipped topping.  I only added about 6oz. and that was too much.  I also left out the marshmallows since I don't care for them and I substituted grapes for the cherries.  If I do make this again, I think I'll only use 4 oz. of the whipped topping and see if I like it better.  Or I might use real whipped cream.

I think this is WAY too sweet -- I made the mistake of adding the colored marshmallows - it looked like an easter bunny threw up on the salad.

I had this for the first time at a wedding over the summer and I just had to make it myself. I've made it at least four times and my family begs for it at every holiday get together! I left out the marshmallows but other then that... its just perfect!

I love this recipe.  My uncle's wife used to make this when I was a kid and I seem to have forgotten about it until I saw it here.  This recipe is as good as I remembered.  I did make a few changes: I added some of the cherry liquid which made the salad a pretty pink color and gave a nice cherry taste as well; I used pineapple tidbits because I like larger pieces of pineapple and I stirred the cherries right into the salad.  This is a very different and delicious recipe.

This turned out great! I added strawberries and seedless red grapes instead of the cherries. I also only chilled the pasta/custard for 6 hours instead of overnight and it turned out fine.

I LOVED this recipe! My parents both loved it as well. My 2 children (17 & 10) & my husband were not so crazy about it, though. My husband's only complaint was he didn't like the marshmallows in it. I think it is great & the little pasta balls remind me of tapioca pudding. Out of the 6 of us that tried it, 1/2 liked it, but the 1/2 that liked it REALLY liked it a lot! It does make a ton, so it is great to take to potluck.

This is so refreshing that it makes an awesome summertime treat.  Although you'll crave it all year long!  The flavor is great but what adds to it is the texture of the tiny acini di pepe balls mixed with the puffiness of the marshmallows and the burst of juciness as you bite into the pineapple chunks and mandarin oranges.  This is a family favorite for sure!

I doubled the recipe for a block party and was shocked by the quantity it made.  The serving size was double what I would have expected.
I used lite cool whip to cut some of the calories.  It tasted great and everyone seemed to like it.

I got this recipe from a family member a few years ago after a family reunion. I loved it! The consistency was so different; I couldn't guess the pasta! I have made a few changes - I don't use marshmallows. I cut way back on the sugar and have added in small curd cottage cheese with the Cool Whip when I double the recipe. The consistency is the same or better and it makes it a little "healthier" Almost everyone loved it. Some people have a problem with the texture though.

I made this for my daughter's birthday party and out of about 30 people, only 3 liked it, and no one LOVED it.  I was so disappointed, as I've been wanting to try this for a long time.  The pasta gave it such a strange texture (and I love tapioca).  None of the kids or teenagers liked it at all.  It was a nice presentation, but the taste left much to be desired.  Without the pasta, it may have been better.  And it sure does make a TON!!!  I hated wasting all that food.

This has been a long time favorite in our family.  On the Ancini di Pepe box the company calls the recipe "Frog Eye Salad", much to the amusement of my grandchildren!

Ancini de pepe is the favorite dessert from aunt peg.  Everyone asks me to bring it.  Just a little variation, use colored marshmellows instead of plain.  The kids think it is great and it adds a little more color.  I also add mixed fruit and if it's being eaten right away, apple chunks (with skin) are great and give the salad a bit of a crunch.

This is an excellent recipe.  I am so glad I found it here on allrecipes.com because I had it at a party years ago, and just thought of it the other day for a summer picnic!  I'm going to keep this one in a safe place.  LOVE IT!

I have tried many recipes in the past few months with much success. The reviews were so good, I looked forward to it. I made this Christmas Eve and was very disappointed. No one liked it, inclduing me.  They expected it to taste like Hawaiian Salad - and the pasta turned them off! I'm sorry to say that I will not be making it again.

So good and so simple!  Love it!
Some changes I made: no marshmallows, and I used fruit cocktail instead of mandarin oranges.  I didn't use marachino cherries, either, except on top.  I also added 1/2 cup of walnuts and pecans (mixed, whatever I had on hand) and that was PERFECT!

I really loved this salad. It does make a lot, though. I love the texture of the pasta with the cooked egg mixture. I can understand it isn't for everybody (my husband wasn't a huge fan), but I really liked it. Great summery taste.

I just made this last night and finished it up this morning and it is WONDERFUL! You have to get past the pasta and sweetness thing for some people but it is a great combo. I left out the marshmallows and cherries and added a bit more Cool Whip and it's great. I'm taking it to my parents house this evening to make them try it!

This is my most requested recipe for fruit salads.  Anytime I take it anywhere, everyone loves it.  I like this version of the recipe better than the one on the Acini di pepe pasta box (frog eye salad).  Try this one out!

This is the only salad with fruit that my husband will actually request - delicious!  This recipe is a little different than the one I had gotten from my grandma, which included 3 eggs instead of 2.  I also have never chilled the pasta overnight before adding the other ingredients.  It works just as well to mix it all together and chill it for several hours.

SO GOOD!!!  I made this to bring to a potluck Christmas party and it was a big hit.  I did add an extra partial can of oranges because I didn't think it had enough.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful.  It made a huge amount but still managed to be entirely gone by the end of the party.

I've made this a few times and keep forgetting to review - it's very tasty.  I do halve the sugar (it's quite sweet) and would like to try it with orzo instead of the acini di pepe at some point.  I have also used extra fruit instead of the marshmallows.  I could very happily just eat the custard ... it is wonderful stuff.  :)

Really good. My fiance was a little skeptical, he thought it was going to be savory like other pasta salads, but he was really suprised when he tried it. The first thing he said was that it was amazing. The marshmellows are my favorite part.

I made this for a work pot luck. I even doubled it, since I wasn't sure how much I was going to get. Didn't need to do that! It makes enough as a single batch. But everyone loved it and more than one person asked for the recipe!

To a previous reviewer:  I live in Kansas and used to live in the Washington DC area, near Virginia.  In both places people have loved this salad/dessert.  Please, don't be discouraged by the very rude comments  made by the people you served it to!  I just can't imagine people who would do that.

I have one word to describe this recipe...
FABULOUS!!!  The recipe made a huge bowl full and I was wondering how we were ever going to finish all of it.  It was not hard.  That was a few days ago and today I made another batch.  I found it very kid friendly and the ingredients were incredibly easy to find in my grocery store.  Thank you for sharing this with us.

I have been making this salad for years and it is a favorite at family gatherings. I use a scant 1/2 cup sugar and 1 cup heavy cream instead of the frozen stuff.  You won't believe the difference it makes! I also omit the cherries and add 2 cups red and/or green grapes, cut in half. I have always used pineapple tidbits as it gives the salad more texture. Note: using colored marshmallows would totally change the flavor of the salad and not in a good way!

I love this salad. I have loved it since I was a kid. My family recipe is a little different though. No marshmallows and different measurements for the ingredients.

Absolutely delicous!!!  Took this to a picnic, and someone else had brought the same thing except with elbow macaroni.  Hers was passed up by many, but mine was nearly gone!  It may seem like an odd combination, but it is YUMMY!  Will definately make again.

My mother has been making this recipe since I was a kid and my entire family loves it. We have always called it frog eyes salad (scary name I know). Since it is such a hit with the family I made it for everyone at work for a big potluck we had and it was a total flop. With the exception of maybe 1 or 2 people I was given the hardest time for months. It is definitely a love or hate dish. Better left in the family if you ask me.

My mom has been making this since I was a kid.  I recently made it for my baby shower, using the colored mini marshmallows and stirring the maraschino cherries (halved) in.  It had a nice pastel color to it and my mother-in-law now requests it at every holiday meal!  Great recipe! (P.S. I've also tried adding a can of tropical fruit salad that I slightly blitzed in the food processor, and it turned out really well)

I served this to week-end guests as  breakfast brunch dish.  It was a big hit.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I added 1/2 C. coconut, and deleted the cherries.  It is surprising how much it makes.

I used Orzo pasta instead of the acini de pepe and it was wonderful, left out the marshmellows since we don't like to much sweetness.

This is my absolute favorite side dish! It really is the kind of thing you either love or hate because of the texture. We always ask my mom to make this for bridal/baby showers, or holidays like Easter or 4th of July and people always ask for the recipe.

I took the salad to a church potluck and everybody loved it!  I did not add the marshmallows, though, thinking it was sweet enough as it was. I will definitely be making this salad again.

Not bad. I ended up spending quite a bit of time waiting for the sauce to thicken - the juices ended up being more than 1 1/2 cups - I think next time I'll make sure to not use more than the 1 1/2 cups. I too left out the marshmallows.
Definitely will make this one again.

I used fruit cocktail and diced peaches, I get monster canker sores from pineapple. Tastes great!
Oh, and I poured in a bit of maraschino cherry juice to add flavor and color. 
No one believes it's pasta!!

My mother used to make this and I haven't thought about it in years until I came across it on allrecipes. It was always a hit at family gatherings and parties. After seeing it on this site, I just had to make it to bring back the old memories. It was exactly like mom used to make. I gave it four stars because it's my personal opinion on the taste. But in fairness, everyone seems to love it.

I added diced mangoes, red and green grapes cut in half, and added fruit colored Marshmallows in plain yogurt refrigerated overnight.  I  also used real whipping cream.  It was very good and very Eastery.  Yes it made a lot but at the end of the day only a few servings were left.

I love this little dish. My family makes it at holidays. I used real whipping cream and added raspberries and blueberries. I also use about half of the crushed pineapple and it cuts back on the sweetness and stringy chunks.

This is one of my favs to make for a group..

There is only two of us, so if I make it without an event I then share a bowl with a friend.
I just LOVE the texture of the pasta ..yum yum yum

I was searching for the original recipe that was on the box of pasta. ThatFrog Eye Salad recipe calls for a can of drained fruit cocktail instead of the Mandarine oranges and does not call for the cherries. It is my daughter-in-law's favorite!

I liked the concept of this salad but I thought it would be too sweet with whipped topping and marshmallows.  I omitted the marshmallows and used sour cream instead of the whipped topping.  Yum.  I bet it would taste just as good if it was mixed with a nice creamy greek yogurt.
