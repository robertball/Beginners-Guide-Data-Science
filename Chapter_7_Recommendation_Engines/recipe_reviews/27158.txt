another way to do it is to make the potato part of the candy into a big ball and roll it out flat. Then spread peanut butter over it and roll up.  Cut into slices that look like spirals.

My mom made this candy for us kids every holiday, and special occasions. It may sound terrible-potatoes and chocolate, but it is so good. Mom used to also put peanut butter in at times which is very very good, and often would leave off the coconut if she didn't have any. It was still yummy. As another member suggested, making in a log and then slicing is how mom made it, much less time consuming and that is how i do it.

A lady at our church made this candy years ago and I thought it was so good..Glad I could find the recipe! I did find you had to add more sugar than the recipe called for..You just keep slowly adding sugar in small increments until the dough gets so stiff you're not able to easily stir it, then cover and chill..Then, I dusted my surface and dough with powdered sugar, rolled it out & divided the dough into four sections to make it easier to work with..Then, section by section, I spread peanut butter on the dough, rolled it up and made the roll very thin(much like you did with playdough when you were little, making skinny 'wiggly' worms..lol)..Cut into small pieces and..yum!..enjoy...Overall, a great recipe but makes ALOT of candy..I'm going to half it next time..

My mom used to make this but rolled it out and coated with peanut butter, ten cooled and sliced and dipped in choc/coconut... I really like the added taste of peanut butter!

I have made potato candy plenty of times before and this has way too much potato to powdered sugar to roll out.  I thought maybe my judgement was wrong when I made it since this has so many great reviews but unfortunately I was right.
