This is a very easy recipe.  Everything turned out wonderfully, until we tried to eat them.  If you are looking for a cookie that is super easy, but tastes awful...this is the one.  Completely inedible.

Everybody who said that these cookies taste good must have scalded their taste buds off before eating them.... I've never had a worse-tasting cookie, and that's saying a lot.  You might as well eat flour straight out of the bag.  

I'm not sure if using confectioners' sugar is the norm for sugar cookies, but it sure makes these taste terrible.

I was looking for this recipe for the last couple yrs. The only thing I do differant is use Butter Flavored Crisco. I'm so glad I found it again. I made these all the time kids love them and a elderly lady I took care of wanted me to make them for her too.

This is the perfect cookie, with these changes: 1. Leave out the egg.  2. Add 1/4 cup more of flour.  3. Add 1 TB milk.  With these changes, it is the butter cookie that has been passed down in my family and is irresistable especially when combined with icing.  I used to make a buttercream frosting, until this year, when I tried the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe here at allrecipes.com.  The recipe has Karo Syrup in it, which when dry, allows you to stack the cookies on top of each other and you don't even need wax paper to divide the layers.  But if you want gooey frosting for the cookies and you don't care as much about storing them, just combine 1/4 cup butter with as much powdered sugar and milk to make the amount you need (and don't forget the almond extract because that is what makes these cookies special).  I would have combined the icing recipe with the cookie recipe because it's the combo that makes this cookie great.

I made this recipe for using it for christmas cookies.  I found it very easy and well worth the time to make.  I refrigerated the dough for two hours.  The only thing I did different is when I rolled out the dough I rolled it between two sheets of wax paper.  Didn't use any flour to roll them out.  It makes a big difference and works wonderful.  Didn't have all the flour mess to clean up and didn't dry out the cookies like flour does.

The cookies turned out well and I agree the flavor wasn't spectacular. Refigerating the dough seemed to cause problems though. It was stuck to the bowl and had to be pried out in spoonfuls. I'd look for an easier recipie next time.

for taste I give this 5 stars, but as for using as a cut out recipe I am not sure what I did wrong.  I refrigerated the dough then after I rolled it out and the kids used cookie cutters, the dough was like mush and the dough was to soft to maintain the shapes. We ended up making balls and doing our thumb prints in the middle then putting sprinkles on them.  I would not use this for cut outs but as for a quick easy circular decorated cookie it works great!

Yesterday my 3-year-old son and I baked these cookies.  I was dreading having to roll out the dough and cut them out--I only do drop cookies--But my son wanted to use the Christmas cookie cutters.  WE HAD SUCH AN AWESOME TIME!!!  These cookies ARE SIMPLE to make and delicious.  Three people have already asked me for the recipe.  This recipe is a keeper!

I made these easy and tasty cookies for my niece's first birthday party last Saturday. They were a huge hit, even with my husband whose mother bakes like Betty Crocker! I'm trying to get a photo submitted so you can see the result. I'll make these again.

I didn't like this recipe that much simply because the cookie dough needs to be refrigerated for longer than "at least two hours".  I refrigerated the dough for 4 hours and it was still a pretty messy ordeal.  If you choose this recipe refrigerate the dough for at least 5 hours.

Great easy to use recipe. For those of you who found it sticky - this is probably due to the flour/confectioner sugar ratio. I just added more confectioners sugar, bit by bit to make sure it didnt stick to the sides of the bowl, then in the fridge it went. You can also if you wish roll it out with confectioners sugar. This may also stop it being floury. You do have to work quickly when rolling out as the dough starts to warm up and become soft and unworkable. I would just harden again in the fridge and resue. These cookies tasted delicious (as we added more confectioners sugar) and the kids love using it to make things as well as using cookie cutters.

I was in a bind and had to do something with ingredients I had but I ended up not even taking them to the party we were going to because it was a pain to roll out, hard to cut out shapes, and when they came out of the oven they totally fell apart.

I made this cookies today and they turned out fine. I did use Crisco butter flavored shortening and white sugar instead of confectioner's sugar (as others suggested). I left the dough in the fridge for about 4-5 hrs. It was impossible to roll (too crumbly) so I added some milk, little by little, until I got a good ball formed and rolled it out between 2 sheets of wax paper. Baked each cookie for around 12 min as they just didn't seem done to me after 8-10 min. They are good but not the best I've had.

I made these cookies last year for Christmas and was very pleased. I frosted and decorated them with my daughter and we had a blast. The only problem I ran into was the cookies' shape didn't stay intact. I don't know if I should use smaller cookie cutters or what. We had a lot of broken xmas trees and snowmen!! But they tasted great so we didn't mind!I am definitely making them this year:)

The cookie recipe was easy, but the taste was awful.  My husband who will pretty much eat anything wouldn't even eat these. They tasted like pure confectioners sugar. 
I would not suggest making these unless you like the taste of confectioners sugar.

Great Family activity/decent cookies. We as in my 3yr. old daughter & husband, We made it light & thin, First off I cut the recipe in 1/2 (we're not big on Sweets)I halfed everything except the Egg, used unsalted butter, and used 1 cup unbleached white flour, and 1.5 tablespoon whole wheat flour, placed in the fridge for 3 hours, rolled on lightly dusted wood tabletop, and used wood rolling pin (also lightly dusted)with unbleached white flour. It yielded 30 cookies, we used small cut-outs (Dragonfly & Heart 3.5x3.5 inches).  We still had to put some up!

This recipe certainly has potential. I followed the directions, but once cooked, I melted some bakers chocolate (semi-sweet) and coated one side of the cookies then sprinkled that side with confectioners sugar. I placed them on wax paper (but any surface would be fine as long as it is something that won't stick or the cookies get turned upside down.) Also, make sure the cookies are rolled pretty thin so that they cook all the way through in just 10 minutes. If you do drop cookies then they don't cook that quickly.

I don't know WHAT went wrong, but what came out of my fridge was not dough.  It looked like a brick and would not roll at all!  We tried dropping the dough by spoonfuls and baking it that way, but the result was dismal.  I carefully re-traced my steps am left to assume that I will never be able to make a decent sugar cookie.  I'm cursed.  Maybe someone had a similar experience?

I have been using this recipe for years. The reason they dont tast right to some poeple is because they didn't cook them long enough, plus the cookies need to sit for a least 5 hours after baking so the flavors blend. The only thing I do different is not melt the butter. I cut into little pieces and cut it into the dry, thus making themflakey. I just made these for valentines day

A great sugar cookie recipe. Loved the fact that there were so few ingredients.  And of course that they were delicious.  Probably some of the most light and airy cookies I've ever had. My younger sister helped and they were a hit!

This was wonderful!  I can do it and I have problems in the kitchen.  My children love em.  I did leave the dough in the fridge overnight and that made it better to work with.  They tasted great.

I tried another recipe before this one and ended up dumping it because I couldn't roll it out.  This one is easy to do!  I recommend rolling out sandwiched between wax paper.  The flavor isn't spectacular but it's good!  =)

I like my sugar cookies to be sugary when I bite into it, at first bite it wasn’t the greatest, but I didn’t want to throw away the dough. So, instead of dusting it with flour, I dusted myit with powdered sugar instead and that seems to have helped make it sweeter!

I made these for my granddaughter's class Christmas party. While they aren't overly sweet,  when royal icing is applied it makes for a perfect sweetness. I loved that the dough was so easy to work with and the cookies kept their shapes. I'll definitely use this recipe again!
I've posted a picture of the snowflake cookies. :)

These cookies were easy to make and made cooking with my 5 year old a breeze. We did not like the taste, so   we added another cup of flour, a cup of grandulated white sugar, & 1/2 cup of butter to the rest of the batch, which made them better. Won't make again.

I was really worried because I didn't read some of the negative reviews until AFTER I made the dough.  I thought I did something wrong because the dough was, well, goopey.  But after refrigerating it overnight, it was fine.  Once the dough softened a little, it was very easy to roll out and work with and it held its shape very well.  As far as the taste, I think they were fine; sort of plain and not overly sweet.  I suppose you could add almond extract or a bit more sugar, but I thought the recipe was fine as written.  And remember,   you're probably going to frost them anyway.

Simple and easy to make. Used Wax paper for rolling dough out. Next time will use a little flour, dough can be very sticky. Flavor is a little dull. Might try a little (very little) cinnamon for stars, spearmint for trees, etc... next time. Will make again.
