This really made a lot and the noodles stuck together big time! The recipe calls for four noodle packages, but it doesn't state how much seasoning mix is to be used as there is a packet for each package.

Great salad.  My kids really enjoyed it.  I didn't add the water chesnuts but instead added brocoli.  Also I only used half of the ramen seasoning and it was perfect.  Adding dill was a nice touch.  Thanks for the recipe.

Really great make-a-day-ahead salad - enjoyed by all ages.  We added tiny shrimp and mixed red, yellow and green pepper for color.  Well worth the time it takes to cut everything up!

Made this for company (first time I made it) and we all loved it.  I had no problems with the noodles sticking.  I had the veggies cut and the peas in a bowl.  As soon as I drained the noodles, I rinsed with cold water and immediately added to the bowl and mixed it up.  I only used 3 packages of the noodles (all I had), added 2 cups of peas, and mixed 3 packages of the noodle seasoning to the 1 cup of mayo.  Turned out great!

I loved this recipe! If you break up the noodles and add just a touch of olive oil while boiling, the noodles don't stick.  I left out the bell pepper, and added almond slivers.  I used 3 packets of the seasoning to the 1 cup of mayonnaise, and it had just the right flavoring.  I minced the onion and celery, and did a course chop of the waterchestnuts, so no single ingredient was too overpowering.  It got rave reviews at the potluck.  Thanks for this recipe!

I made this to bring for X-mas. Everyone loved the refreshing taste of it. I doubled the recipe and unfortunately, the noodles were quite unruly to deal with. I will make it again for a party.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!! You can get creative w/ it! I didn't have water chestnuts on hand or red onion so I simply added more green pepper & I used wild leeks instead of onion. My family loves it! Thanks!!!!

This is a great salad, especially for the summer.  Quick to prepare and delicious. My family loved it and I will be making it again and again.  I substituted some of the veggies (not a pea fan) and it turned out great.  I also added some toasted sesame seeds which added a nice flavour.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This salad is a definite keeper. It is so quick to make. Fifteen minutes before I had to have lunch on the table I needed extra food and this was ready and delicious when we sat down to eat.

I don't normally serve a salad at a pot luck or family gathering until I've tried it, but I thought I'd take a chance on this one because of the great reviews.  I'm so glad that I did!  I received many requests for the recipe!  I following the recipe exactly for the salad ingredients, but I only added 2 of the packets of ramen noodle seasoning to the mayo rather than all 4 after reading through some of the comments that it was a little salty.  Plus I added some dill week like the previous poster.  

This salad is best served chilled for at least a couple hours or over night.  I plan to make again at a family gathering next month.

This was a big hit at the church potluck! I used all the seasoning packets and it seemed to turn out well. I do think next time I'll try using 3 packages of noodles instead of 4 and see if I like the noodle-vegetable ratio any better.

This has to be one of the least healthy salads I've ever eaten, however, it is so yummy! My husband always asks me to make it and our left-overs are usually gone within a day.

This noodle salad was really good.  Everyone loves it.  I did make a couple of changes to it. I added some fresh dill, which really added to the flavor.  Also, when I mixed the mayo sauce with the other ingredients, it seemed much too thick and a little too salty. I added two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar to cut the salt taste down a little and to make it a little less thick.  It was perfect!

What a great and easy to prepare salad; it is also easily customizable and extremely pocket friendly.  My secret to preventing the Ramen noodles from sticking is to first break up the noodles slightly and then to add a few drops of Asian Flavored Sesame Oil while the noodles are boiling.  Some of the Sesame Oil still sticks to the noodles when you run them under the cold water, and instantly adds a nice flavor.  I added frozen carrots and peas which I boiled beforehand. I noticed the can of water chestnuts I had was made in China so I eliminated them entirely (mainly due to the recent food scare there) and opted to double the green pepper and celery instead. I also added one shallot, chopped finely, along with two green onions, also chopped finely. I used regular Mayonaise but ended up using less than the recipe called for and I only used a little of the pre-packet Ramen seasoning because of the sodium content but added a few drops of low sodium soy sauce for color and consistency. Overall, this is a great recipe that can be easily adapted to whatever ingredients you prefer or what you may happen to have on hand.  I'll definitely be keeping this one in my rotation and I'll keep experimenting but for now, it's definitely a keeper!

I made this salad at the request of my 19 year old son, who loves ramen (like many college students!)  The only change I made was to use fat free mayonnaise instead of regular mayo. It was great - my family loved it. Thank you!

Chill this several hours or overnight to give the flavors time to meld.  I added a splash of milk & a few squirts of dijon mustard.  Next time I will add some shrimp & crab with a few shakes of Old Bay for a change.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was a GREAT recipe!  I have made it several times and absolutely love it. It's irritating when users rate recipes based on all the changes they make, so I made this recipe according to the directions.  Having said that, I may tweak it a bit according to my taste, but I was completely happy with the recipe as-is!

This is wonderful! At first, I was unsure how this would come out, but it's great! I omitted the peas since I don't care for them, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. This is a keeper for sure, thank you! *12/26/07* I made this again today, and this time added bacon bits and dill weed as other reviewers suggested. These additions are a nice touch to the orginal recipe. Give it a try.

Although this was highly rated, I thought it was a little bland for my taste. I followed the other reviewer's advice and only used 2 packets of ramen seasoning. I'm thinking that it really needed all 4. I added dill and vinegar as other's suggested, doubled the peas and added extra veggies. I liked the simplicity and the crunchiness was great. I will probably try again after I figure out what will give it some more "zip".

Good recipe.   I made it just like it said except I forgot to add the ramen seasoning to mayo and it was still eaten.  I'm sure w/the ramen seasoing it will be even better.

I made this for a Fourth of July picnic because I happened to have most of the ingredients.I wasn't sure about how it would taste, but I made it anyways. I got a lot of complements! It was very good. I omitted the water chestnuts, and added more celery. I used frozen stirfry peppers, although I would've liked fresh better. All in all, VERY EASY and VERY TASTY!

I made this because my teenage son likes ramen noodle soup and I wasnt expecting much from this recipe but I ended up loving this.  It is nothing like the soup.  I only used two of the soup packets to cut back a little on the high sodium and it was still very tasty.  I will definitely make this again!

definitely needs some sprucing up!! dressing fell flat for me, had to give 2 *'s. Only use the flavoring fromthe soup sparingly, very salty. I put 1 clove of grated garlic and ginger, 1/2 tsp of sesame oil and chili oil (very spicy), and 1 tblsp of honey. you can probably adjust these according to taste. But very good after I changed the dressing

I have made this recipe TONS of times because of the rave reviews I get on it!  I am not a big cook and like things quick and easy. This fits the bill!  VERY easy to make and loved by all!  I have been asked to make it for graduation parties and even a wedding!!  You definitely want to try it!!!  TIPS:  I break up the noodles before I cook it so they are easier to handle.  I use all the 4 packets of seasoning and usually add some extra mayo.  (I use Hellmans Lite) but you can use whatever you prefer.  It is fun to add other substitutions/additions as well!  Anything with color!

I thought this was very good and easy to make. I changed some ingredients, putting into it what I had in the frig. I diced 1 whole tomato and did not add the water chestnuts, peas or celery. I put in a little thawed frozen spinach too. I also added a little vinegar as recommended and topped it with bacon bits (the kids loved that). Yummy!!!

I made this recipe for a family picnic on Memorial Day and everyone loved it.  I gave some to my sister and a friend of mine and they both requested the recipe as well.  It is very much like a recipe with mock crab in it that I have eaten before from the deli.  Will make it again!!

I will definitely make it again.  I did spray the noodles with spray butter after rinsing and the noodles did not clump.  I made 1/2 a batch and added celery, onion and green pepper with peas.  Could add anything else. I used both packets to the dressing.  Was still good the next day.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Reviewers mentioned that their noodles stuck together--that's why you have to rinse the finished noodles under cold wate4r--to remove the starch.  This recipe was remarkably good for something so simple to put together.  Took it to a church picnic.  I wish I had reserved some to eat later on.

I took it to a girls get together and it was a hit.  I made exactly as written.  I made the day before the party.  No one thought it was too salty.  I did use low fat mayo.

Fantastic! I made this for a potluck lunch, and it was a big hit! I live in Japan, and for some reason could not locate all the of ingredients listed. I subbed fresh snow peas for the frozen green peas, and added in some finely sliced green onion and it was delicious! The noodles do stick together but the taste was really nice. I also used soy-sauce based mayo, which gave it a nice little kick.

Vegan Adaptation:
This is quick and easy. I used 4 packets of noodles, and instead of the seasoning packets, I used a T. or so of Chickpea Miso. Instead of green peas, I used diced avacado, and used red bell pepper and white sweet onion and added some chopped black olives. For the Mayo, I used Veganaise, which was delicious. Thank you for posting this recipie.

I tried this on the recommendation  of a friend and the whole family really liked it.   I found it a little too salty;  next time I'll use 3 packets of seasoning instead of four, and maybe substitute diced daikon for the water chestnuts.

I stumbled across this recipe a year ago and have made it several times since.  It's fabulous!!  I've added chopped chicken breast and used it as a meal during the summer.  It's so versatile.  Making it again today to take to a church cook out.  I can't wait to eat!!  :)

I love this recipe. It's a big hit at all our get togethers. I did change it a bit. I only add half the amount of seasoning packets(2 instead of 4). I also added diced up chicken from a roasted chicken. It makes it even yummier.

This is the perfect recipe for someone to tweek to their personal tastes.  A friend had this at a party and I make it with just the ramen noodles, mayo, carrots (cooked slightly), celery, onion and a little parsley.  Was TERRIFIC.  Going to make this again very soon!

Break each ramen into at least 8 pieces so that it is easy to work with.  Cook the noodles a little less than the 3 minutes directed on the package.  Also, I would use sweet yellow onion instead of red, it was a little strong.  I also made a version with vegetable oil instead of mayo, and they were both very delicious!

I made this and only used 3 packages of noodles and omitted the seasoning packets because of the high sodium content. Instead I made a simple dressing withe the mayonnaise adding sugar, a few dashes of lemon juice, a few dashes of apple cider vinegar,  and a few tablespoons of sugar to taste. I didn't use peas but added a cup of  chopped  broccoli, a grated carrot,and some shredded cheddar cheese. It turned out delicious. in

It was easy enough for my small brain to handle. I got bored one day, and made this.  I didn't have peas, so I used corn, and a yellow onion. That was it. I was too lazy to try and hunt down the other ingredients besides ramen and mayonnaise.
I made it, and served it immediately, and my family loved it! Then I decided to look at the instructions and realized that it should be chilled. It was better chilled. I got mayonnaise all over my favorite dress because I'm mentally incapable of doing anything without some type of catastrophe, but overall, a success.

My family really liked it.  I made a couple changes the second time I made it and we personally liked it even more.  Used only 3 of the seasoning packets,  used green onions instead of the red (which were too strong) and doubled the amount of peas.  Tried the chicken and the roasted chicken flavors and liked them equally.

Delish! Was a big hit at a Memorial Day Pool Party. I used Oriental Ramen flavored pkgs, made the day before. Used a little bit of Sesame seed oil in the cooking water and rinsed the noodles thoroughly so they wouldn't stick together. I changed the green peppers to red and added frozen peas and carrots I wanted to color it up a bit. But in reality, you could really use whatever veggies you wanted to change it up. I tried just the 3 pkg of seasoning with the mayo and found it needed more so I used all 4 pkgs, wasn't too salty as other reviewers mentioned. Loved it, will definitely be keeping this recipe close. It's super easy and inexpensive to make for get togethers'.

Very good, and easy to make.  There are only two of us, so I used one package of noodles and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly.  I didn't have water chestnuts, so cut up some broccoli together with the other  veggies instead.

This was a big hit at a company cover dish. I doctored it up a little by adding a can of yellow corn for more color, and I doubled the amount of peas. Finally I seasoned with a generous amount of smoked paprika which added a good flavor and a nice color.

This was really good I didn't have celery or water chestnuts so I used red yellow and orange peppers instead of green, onion, peas and I used three packs of ramen noodles but only 2 seasoning packets. I also added a little dill.

This recipe provide a great "jumping off point." I bought a bottle of delicious asian dressing but had no idea what went into an asian noodle salad. I followed the recipe very loosely, swapping some of the veggies and swapping half the mayonnaise for my bottled dressing plus some chili garlic sauce. Added cold chopped rotisserie chicken. Delish! And I can think of a dozens of yummy variations now that I have the basic idea!

I am not a picky eater but I did not care for this at all. Definitely will not make again.

I tried it with spicy ramen flavoring and it was pretty good.

very good salad and easy to make.  I made it for a sport function and everyone kept asking who made it and when they found me I was asked for the recipe.  Thanks for posting.

I made this as a half recipe only I used 3 packages of noodles. Only use half the seasoning for the dressing.

I would not even give this one a so so and would not make it again. It sounded pretty good but not one person liked it out of five served.

This salad was so good, I think I liked it better then anyone else in the house.  I didn't have any peppers on hand so I used cucumber, I only had 2 teriyaki chic and 1 beef ramen packets so that it what I used and it was still delicious!  So easy and cheap to make! Oh and I added a little bit of chopped dry salami

I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted like imitation crab meat, I am not sure why it must be the seasoning packets combined with the mayo.

I made this for a Superbowl party.  Got very mixed reviews.  I myself didn't like it at all...way to onion-y and I even cut that in half from the original recipe.  My husband disagreed and thought this was very tasty.  Hense, the 3 star rating.  All in all, I doubt I will make this again.  Sorry!
