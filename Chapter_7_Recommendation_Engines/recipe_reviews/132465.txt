I've been making this 'salad' for years ... Though I drain the Mandarin Oranges and save the liquid, adding this liquid to make the 2 cups of water ...  Also, try using Vanilla Ice cream in place of the Orange Sherbet ... The end result is very much like a Half & Half Creamsicle ...

Growing up in the Midwest farm country, we kids were allowed to have desserts like this with meals, since they were called "salads."  I continue this tradition today with my family, and my kids and guests feel like they are getting away with something.  This is a simple, very tasty recipe.  Remember to allow the gelatin to thicken slightly before stirring in the mandarin oranges, and they won't tend to float. Thanks for the recipe and the memories.

We did make this for Easter! It was fantastic!  We didn't flip it out but rather just served it from a bowl. For others who are mold-shy like myself, I reccommend using a shallow dish as the oranges float to the surface!

Some of the family loved this, others not so much.  Not sure I will make it again.  I have another similar recipe that has whipped cream in it that the whole family likes.

This was great!  I followed the suggestions of using the liquid the oranges were in.  Great idea.  I also whipped in 4 ounces of cream cheese to the hot jello mixture and used orange cream sherbert.  My husband loved it and so did I.  We will definitely make again and experiment with different flavors/fruit.

This is almost identical to a salad I've made at Easter for many years.  The only difference is I use 1 1/2 C boiling water, 2 cans of mandarin oranges, drained and I add the very small can of frozen orange juice.  It's a refreshing salad!

Not bad.  Not great.  Would have liked if there were more mandarin oranges in it.  I won't make it again.

We've been making this recipe every Easter and Thanksgiving for at least thirty years.  First we drain the juice from the can of mandarin oranges, then add water to that to equal two cups.  Wonderful, classic, pretty!

Altho we enjoyed the rich flavor, mine came out a little "firm". Next time I may add a little more sherbet.

I made changes, with the goal to have the Dreamsicle flavor we like, for my granddaughter's graduation party. I used the drained mandarin orange juice, plus regular orange juice, in place of the plain water, to give it a stronger orange flavor, as I replaced orange sherbet with vanilla ice cream.  It did the trick!   I'll be making it again for a different occasion this week, but will stick to the original recipe.

I love this salad....it's been an old standby for me.  I get compliments every time I serve it.  Just to pretty it up a bit I add some chopped/drained maraschino cherries to the mix.  Thanks, Tara Holt for submitting an old time favorite!!

Delicious - but we love things made with gelatin.  I wanted to use up a partial carton of orange sherbet and this hit the spot.  I chose to put in individual glasses rather than a mold.  I would make this again.

The hello was great, the addition of oranges was a distraction. I acknowledge the quality of oranges maybe to blame.
