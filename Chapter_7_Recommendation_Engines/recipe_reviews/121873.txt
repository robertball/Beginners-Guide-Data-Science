These were really good.  They came out a bit puffier then I would have liked, but the taste is excellent.  If you're really short on time you can use canned cream cheese frosting.  Everyone said they tasted like soft oreos.  Thanks for the recipe.
*Made them again, and this time flattened them slightly with a glass before baking.  They came out perfect.

These are absolutely incredible. I could eat the whole plate. They are amazing after letting them sit for a night. Like a lot of other people said, take them out sort of early. Before they look they are really done. And I ran out of the filling, so I would also making just a bit more than that. -----UPDATE-----I made more filling the second time and it was much much better. So, adjusted amounts for the filling were 10 oz cream cheese, 3 cups powdered sugar, 5 tbsp butter, and a little over a tsp of vanilla. Also, the first time I made it with 1 package devil's food and one package dark chocolate cake mix, and I liked that a little better.

I give this recipe 4 1/2 stars (wasn't an option)! They were DELICIOUS. The only thing that I believe I did wrong was bake a couple of batches for too long. They will NOT look like they are done when they are actually ready to come out. 9 minutes seemed to do the trick. It's important not to over bake them because they will become rather hard once they have set. I am going to try this recipe again with different kinds of cake mix as well... YUMMY!

These are AWESOME! So easy to make!  The first time I made them, I noticed the cookie dough was SUPER oily.  Don't worry about this though, they come out beautifully despite this!!  I also agree with other reviews regarding bake time.  They come out much better if they are slightly underbaked.  About 9 minutes in my oven.  I love making them 'mini' size . . .SO delicious!!

Super easy to make!  I received rave reviews from co-workers & friends.  However, it is awfully sweet.  The next time I make it, I will use more cream cheese and less confectioner's sugar.  You may also want to make 25% more filling.

These are not only quick and easy cookies to make but they are yummy.  These are the cookies that my kids will try and hide from the others so they get more.

Recommend highly. I made mini cookies and made a simple buttercream frosting instead. They are for a bake sale and thought the cream cheese frosting would get too slippery because its a sale outside and what if the day was warm. The batter is thick as is most recipes made with a cake mix. I rolled up little balls that were mabye 3/4" and just touched the tops to flatten a little. They spread wonderfully and after they cooled I matched circles that would best fit together. When I put the frosting on and then the top I did take a small untensil and smoothes the outside and added sprinkles by sprinkling around edges. Pretty

DON'T make these cookies unless you are prepared to make them again, and again, and again.  I made them for the first time, Christmas Eve dinner a couple of years ago and now I HAVE to make them for EVERY get together!  I didn't make them last Thanksgiving, I took some delicious chocolate cookies that were a HIT, but as many compliments I received I had as many comments on how they had been looking forward to the Chocolate Sandwich Cookies and wished I brought them as well.  I even have requests to bring them for birthday parties!

These are super simple and delicious! I make these every year for Christmas and I usually tint the icing (1/2 red and 1/2 green), for a festive look. Everyone really enjoys these! Thanks for posting. :)

These were GREAT! I made them for a birthday celebration for someone who loves oreos, and they were just perfect. Easy to make and very quick, although you'd never guess how basic they are from the taste. I'm looking forward to trying filling variants.

These came out great and taste delicious! I am using them for a cookie swap today. I made them yesterday and put them in the fridge overnight. This morning the cookies were soft and the frosting was perfect. I would definitely reccommend them!

These are very easy and delightful!!!! I even added white chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate chips in the filling, which made them even better! :) These are just technically whoopie pies, but easier. They are great for kids also! You can even possibly get the kids in there to help. These are tasty!!

These were dynamic!  I halved the recipe, since I only had one cake mix on hand.  I also substituted pre-made cream cheese frosting for the filling.  super easy and TASTY!

The hubby absolutely loved them, he ate them all. I on the other hand didn't really care much for them I think the cookies need to be cooked a little longer to me it feels like the cookie is raw and I could taste the saltines of the mix. I will them again and I am going to cook the cookie a couple min longer.oh and I loved the frosting .

I loved the cookies and the recipe was really simple.  But I didn't like the filling as much.  I thought it was a little too thin and too "cream-cheesy" and didn't set well.  I am going to try the recipe again and work on refining the filling.   Made these a 2nd time with different filling and they were AWESOME!  I got tons of rave reviews.  I just used a simple white icing (powdered sugar, egg whites, shortening & vanilla) for the filling and it was about as close to an Oreo as you can get.
