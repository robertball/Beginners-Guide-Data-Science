Delightfully yummy.  I made it on the Cuisinart griddler and was surprised at how the. Chocolate nutty flavor paired so nicely with the grilled pineapple flavor.  I topped our servings with whipped cream and the whole effect reminded me of a banana split.  My husband liked it also and I plan to make it again.

Oh my word . . . this was delicious! I'm a huge Nutella fan, and loved how the milk thinned it out to drizzle consistency. I did add a little dollop of whipped cream, just to make it pretty! Yummy is right!

You can't beat this for a great 'no brainer' desert. That said I just use the canned fruit.
