When making this recipe, I was in a hurry and didn't have cream at hand.  I browned the veggies rather than cook them in water, added onions, doubled the flour and, because there was no broth, added some veggie boullion cubes.  I added no water, but rather, used fat free milk for the whole thing.  Added in some frozen brocolli, just for fun.  It was sooooo good!

This recipe is easy and very good. As with any recipe, we all tweek it to our own.
So, I added some fresh mushrooms at the onion-butter cooking stage.  Added 
extra paprika, salt and pepper and in the end I pureed about 1/3 of the soup to make it a little
thicker and that way I was able to add quite a bit of the veggie stock you make 
with the potato broth.  This is a scrumptous recipe and I will recommend it to my friends.

This was really good!  After reading other reviews, I cooked the carrots and celery with the onions.  I also added garlic to the butter and vegetables.  I added much more paprika and pepper than were called for in the recipe, and it wasn't spicy at all.  I also salted the water when I cooked the potatoes, which I diced.  And I added some frozen peas toward the end of cooking for color.  It was delicious, and I can't wait to tweak it again sometime with some cheese and other vegetables.

Great standard recipe for veggie stew to start and lots of room to add ingredients for your preferences. I don't believe you need the whole cream, I used 2% milk seemed a little overboard. You may need to add a little additional flour. I also added other veggies, beans, spices to this stew. Very satisfying..

A hearty, filling vegetarian stew that I have made several times.  I usually use whole milk rather than cream since that is what I have on hand.  Like others have mentioned, I find that it needs more spice to make it flavorful enough, so I generously double the paprika and am heavy handed with the black pepper.

This soup was easy and a great hit with my family.  First time I've ever made a cream-of-anything soup, and it turned out so well, I'm going to try other cream based soups.    I didn't have any cream on hand, so instead of using cream and water, I used 2% milk for the liquid.  Like the other posters, I added quite a lot more of the salt and pepper (about triple) than this recipe called for, but it was just right.  I garnished with a small amount of shredded sharp cheddar when serving.

I didn't have high hopes for this, but it actually was pretty good. I do agree that it's a little bland--even after I upped the paprika to 2 tsp. I found that I should have sauteed the onions a little longer than 10 minutes, but if you are good at doing a fine dice (I'm not), then 10 minutes might be fine. Keep a careful eye on the potatoes, carrots and celery while boiling, so the potatoes don't get too mushy. (And try to dice the carrots small so they cook through.) I used white potatoes, which worked well. I think this might benefit from substituting chicken or vegetable broth for the water. I added a European seasoning called Vegeta that I like, and that perked the soup right up.

Really really good! We added more pepper than the recipe called for, and sprinkled lots of parmesan on top. We also substituted mushrooms for celery. Turned out fantastic. Highly recommended!

Very very very nice - I can believe I made something that tasted so good. Only comments: If you don't dislike black pepper triple the amount - it adds flavor and still doesnt overpower.

I customized this a bit to my taste.  Sauteed one onion, 2 carrots, and 1 1/2 stalk celery together in about 1 1/2 tbs butter with a couple shakes of pepper salt and garlic powder added 5 cubed potatoes 5 cups broth, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, paprika and some Mrs Dash...brought to a boil lowered to simmer covered and cooked for about 15 minutes(I diced potatoes very small) In small bowl I mixed together 1 can evaporated milk and 2 tbs cornstarch added to soup brought to a boil until thickened.  YUMMY!!!  I also didn't make as large of pot as the recipe makes cuz I'm the only person in my home who'll touch a potato.  Good base recipe as listed but I would never cook the potatoes seperate throw it all in together.

My children love this recipe.  I use fat free half and half to cut calories and sprinkle with grated cheese.  I have taken it to work for soup day.  It was a hit.  I have shared the recipe with family and friends and they have all loved it as much as I do.

It's a pretty basic potato soup, all the essentials are there but there just isn't enough flavor for my tastes.  I'd add plenty of garlic to this when cooking the onions, and i'd double the amount of black pepper. It's good if you're just learning to make soup (especially cream based ones), but there are better potato soups out there with lots more flavor.

This was easy and creamy, but really lacked flavor. After making this today, I had to add a lot more seasonings to give it any flavor. The 4 stars are based on the changes I made after following the recipe. I appreciate the ease of this recipe, but there are other recipes on AR with much more flavor.

This was a perfect "starter" soup recipe. Today was the first time I've ever made soup (ever) and this was a great way to start. I used mushrooms instead of celery, used less butter, didn't use any paprika, and instead of heavy cream I used whole milk. When I fried the onion and mushrooms, I also used oregano and a generic "spaghetti" spice blend. I also didn't use any water in the soup. The result was fantastic! I'm keeping this recipie to make again. It was soooo good, and just what I needed to warm my family up on a cold day. :)

I really liked this, but I really changed the seasoning; I think had I made this as written, it would have been impossibly bland. I cut the recipe in half, btw. I left the skin on the potatoes, I used half and half instead of cream, and I used about four stalks of celery. For seasoning, I put in 1 Tbsp basil, 1-1/2 tsp pepper, 3/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp ground chipotle pepper, 1 tsp paprika, and 1/2 tsp celery seed. At the end, I stirred it fairly roughly, smooshing some of the potatoes, which really helped thicken the stew. 

While I'd probably only rate this two or three stars as written, because I'd imagine the first adjective that would come to mind would be "tasteless," I'll give it five stars with my additional seasoning. The basil and pepper combined to make a taste explosion. I will definitely make this again! Next time, I think I might grate some colby cheese to sprinkle on the top.

Just like other reviews, I doubled the paprika and salt. I also added minced garlic in with the onions. Topped with sharp cheddar and served with sour dough. It was a hit with my family of 6. Even the 5-year-old gobbled it up.

Good basic potato stew recipe.  I didn't have paprika, but I added some sage to the spice mixture.   Also added a little soy sauce while the onions sauteed and then veggie crumbles for extra protein.  It turned out great! My kids loved it too.

I thought that the recipe was good, but not great.  I will say, though, I subbed the cream for two percent milk, and contrary to what the others said, I found it not to be creamy enough.  I will try it again with whole milk and I think that will make a good difference.

So simple to make and very good.  The only problem I had was cooking some of the vegetables too long.  I was adding them to boiling water while I was still preparing them.  Still is was spectacular stew!

Not happy with how bland it is, even though I added salt to the water, added garlic to the onions, added way more paprika and black pepper and salt than written, added garlic powder, added roasted asparagus at the end my roommate made, and then parmesan cheese, and then some halved grape tomatoes per my boyfriend's suggestion, and he added a bunch more pepper as well. Just super super bland.

This dish was a hit for my family. A couple modifications as we used kale and milk instead of the cream. It was delicious  and will definitely try again! Thanks for this!!!

This definitely needed a flavor boost. I used red potatoes with skin. I added more salt and pepper, along with some basil, rosemary, and a dash of cinnamon. It turned out pretty good. Even better the next day.

Three stars only because I used it as a starting point. I had all the veggies here, and also sweet potato, asparagus, broccoli and green onion. Chunked all into bite-size, sparingly poured OOVO on top, a litte S&P, and roasted at 375F for an hour. Once veggies are soft, remove from oven and let cool while completing next step. Put half the veggies into a food processer and puree with some of the 1/2&1/2, set aside. Chopped cilantro and the green onion and cooked in butter in my pot for a couple minutes, then began to add flour, butter, and half-and-half (fat free lowers the fat content of this recipe) until thickening, added the pureed veggies, and added broth and then chunked veggies. I completed with pouring  1/2&1/2 into the mix to the consistency I desired, alternating with the broth. Try it, play with it.

This was a wonderful recipe. I adapted it to make a seafood chowder as I was looking for something really creamy. I used seafood broth instead of water to boil the potatoes and celery (didn't put carrots) then, I couldn't find "heavy cream" so I used whipping cream instead. I put in baby clams with the juice once I had added the flower and spices to the butter and onion combo. I also out in salmon, baby shrimps, scallops and imitation crab meat when I put in my heavy whipping cream. I then added the cooked potatoes and celery and about 1 cup of the seafood broth leftover. As a final step before serving, I added 1.5 cups of shredded mozzarella. wow this was tasty!

I added more vegetables and water to this stew to make a healthy soup.

I used coconut heavy cream instead of cow milk heavy cream to make it vegan. Also doubled the flour and paprika, added garlic, peas and a couple veggie bouillon cubes. You can taste the coconut a little but the salt, pepper and bouillon dilute it a bit. Served with biscuits!

Delicious! Took a bit longer than 30 minutes for prep, but came it perfectly.

I took it to church potluck and everyone like it. However, I did make some changes, I added 3 cloves of garlic and added about 2 tablespoons of cilantro. I also make it a little more soupy by adding 1/2 to 1/4 cups of the reserved water at a time. At the end I pureed some of the potatoes and a couple of carrot pieces (not too many carrots though because it would change the color of the potatoes.

I changed my soup up with vegetable broth, whole milk, a tad of whipping cream, and a little corn starch. I also added in broccoli and cheddar cheese. My potatoes were red potatoes and I diced them up small. I also like many others added in more salt, pepper, and paprika. It came out delicious paired with bread bowls.

Good base recipe. I upped the flavors by substituting vegetable broth for half the water; cooking onions with carrots, celery and garlic; and included extra black pepper, a dash of cayenne pepper and a few tablespoons of dried thyme. I skipped the cream altogether because one of my dinner guests is dairy free; instead, I substituted the reserved cooking liquid from boiling the potatoes. The stew turned out thick, flavorful, and all my guests loved it!

Made this stew tonight and it was delicious! I added about 1/8 tsp. of minced garlic and 1/4 tsp of seasoning salt just to up the flavor factor. This one is definitely going to become a staple for me.
