I give this recipe a 5 because it was simple and delicious. I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so i improvised. I only used ketchup, mustard, sugar in the raw, vinegar and chili powder and it still turned out delicous. A lot healthier plus it does not disappoint on flavor. Just double or triple the recipe for sloppier joes..lol. Definitely a quick recipe for those lazy days!!! This recipe will be my go to recipe for manwich or sloppy joes.

I think this may be one of those recipes that needs to be tweaked to your own personal tastes.  When I saw “El Pato,” I thought Y-E-S, this is going to be a different sloppy joe, and it was.  El Pato is available in my area in the spicy Salsa de Jalapeno (green can) and Salsa de Chile Fresco (hotter) in the yellow can.   I had the Salsa de Jalapeno on hand, so that’s what I used.  I followed the instructions, tasted, and we wanted something a little spicier.  I added some more of the tomato sauce and even a good sprinkle of cayenne, as well as some salt and pepper. Don’t think for a minute traditional “sloppy joes,” otherwise, you may be disappointed.  We didn’t, and we weren’t, and they were good!

After tasting the original recipe I found that it needed more of a tomato flavor and tweaked it to our liking. I did not have the Mexican tomato sauce, so I substituted it with 8 ounces of canned tomato sauce and 8 slices of pickled  jalapeno slices (chopped). I added 4 tablespoons of tomato paste and about 1/2 cup water. (You may have to adjust the amount of water.) I cut back on the brown sugar to 1 tablespoon. I increased the chili powder to 1+1/2 teaspoons. Now my husband likes it much better.

Made this and loved it.  I didn't have cider vinegar so used red wine vinegar instead.  And used Kroger brand fire roasted tomatoes -- DELICIOUS.  The next day I added elbow macaroni and ate it on a plate instead of a bun --- might do that from now on with the leftovers.   Looking forward to fixing it again.

Easy to make and everybody at home loved it.  I need it exactly the way the recipe said but added diced red bell pepper.  toasted the buns with butter and garlic salt. this was definitely the best sloppy joe/manwich I've ever had the pleasure of eating.

Good recipe but I made some modifications that I liked. Instead of the Mexican style tomato sauce I used tomato paste (140 g) and instead of the ketchup (sugar!) I used 330 g of plain canned tomato sauce.

This is a recipe I have been loving since I was a little girl. It was a staple at all of our family functions. No matter what the occasion, someone always brought this to a pot luck. It is always delicious no matter what you add or leave out!

I think these were the best sloppy joes I've had especially with the buttered garlic buns toasted.  I didn't have Mexican tomato  sauce so I just added some chopped pickled jalapenos to regular tomato sauce .

I've made so many types of sloppy joes in the past, and this is by far the best recipe I've ever had. I make it exactly as-is every time, and it's always hugely popular in our household. A couple of pro tips: try putting this on hot dogs, sort of like a coney sauce. It's unbelievably good. Also, to convert to Instant Pot, add everything to the cooker plus an extra 1/2 cup of water, and cook on the Meat setting for 30 minutes.

This is a great base recipe that you can "jujj" up as needed. If you like it hot, you'll likely want to add way more chili pepper or even a custom hot spice blend from somewhere like Tea and Spice exchange. Have fun!

This was the hit of the potluck at work.  It was easy to make and I followed the recipe to the T.  Only change I would make is maybe a little more spice, but otherwise I loved it!

As far as sloppy joes go,  these are the best! Way better than canned stuff. There's a perfect blend of spiciness, sweetness, and tanginess. The heat and sweet combination really make these great. I've made them twice (once in the slow cooker for a potluck at work, and once on the stovetop for family), and both times they've been gobbled up and I've received lots of compliments. I suggest doubling the recipe - they're even more tasty the next day (if there's any leftover)!
I was able to find the Mexican style tomato sauce at Wal-Mart. It's good stuff!

Amazing! I put the whole can of tomato paste and some salt and it's so good. I've eaten on it for days, I've taken to football parties and it's all gone by the end. Perfect with some coleslaw and rice

I couldn't find Mexican Style Tomato sauce so i improvised, using regular tomato sauce with 2 Tablespoons of jalapeno relish and a 2 teaspoons of Sirracha. Turned out great on a toasted potato buns.

This was the BEST Sloppy Joe recipe!  I too grew up on canned sloppy joes. Ick
Instead of a slow cooker, I used my simmer plate on my cooktop (2 hours).  Served with Wickles Pickles, French's fried onions, and on a Hawaiian Roll.  Delish!
