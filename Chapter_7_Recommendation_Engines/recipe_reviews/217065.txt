Good ! You can replace the sugar with a bit of honey and also add vanilla extract.Texture is good and you can play around with different types of G/F flour mixtures and still get a tasty result...

This bread was moist, fluffy, flavorful, everything a bread should be.  I just used whatever GF flour I had on hand, some all purpose flour, and it was wonderful.  I followed directions EXACTLY.  I think that's important.  I'm going on a trip in a few days, and I'm baking 2 dozen of these to take with and share.  This does NOT taste gluten free.  It doesn't rise up as much as wheat based muffins, so go ahead and fill the cups pretty full. It took 30 min to cook the muffins, 45-50 min to cook the bread.  I sprayed the pan very thoroughly, as GF stuff tends  to stick.  Again, everything was perfect.  The bread did not fall apart, or have a dense texture like most gf breads.  Remember what yummy wheat-based muffins were like?  Well you will.  My next adventure is to try the recipe and replace the bananas with pumpkin!

Excellent!  I skipped the sugar and only used 2 tbsp of maple syrup.  I only had 5 bananas. 
The bread was sweet (but not overly sweet) and moist.  My mother couldn't even tell that it was gluten-free and my children both loved it.

I have made several gluten-free breads/cakes since going gluten-free January 2013.  It takes some research and practice to get the right combination of flours.  I used the gf flour recipe that already has xanthan gum in it but not all gf flour mixtures do.  Read the label if you buy a pre-made mix.  Xanthan gum or guar gum are absolutely necessary in this recipe.  When adding the flour to the wet mixture, mix for at least a few minutes with an electric mixer, not just until mixed like the recipe says.  That gets the flours/gum to work together better.  I used 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar in place of the turbinado and syrup.  Creamed those for several minutes with margarine and 2 tsp vanilla then added eggs and 6 medium very ripe bananas.  My muffins were done in 20 minutes and raised pretty well.  I got 18 out of this recipe.  I am very happy with how they turned out.

The taste and texture were excellent.  However, it took 60 minutes to bake through.  (I used a bread loaf pan)

Terrific recipe.  I did not have 6 ripe bananas (only 4) so I added some fresh, sliced strawberries to the mix.  I also added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp clove and nutmeg, and 1 tsp vanilla. Very easy to make.

This was a very good recipe.  Missing something, cinnamon perhaps.  I used 1 1/2 cups white rice flour and 1/2 cup flax meal and this seemed to work quite well.  I also added chocolate chips and made muffins instead of a loaf.  The batter made 15 muffins which I baked for 30 min.  I would use this recipe again, but tweak it next time.

Recipe could have used some basic info such as "sift dry ingredients together" (obvious, I know, but still) and how many cups 6 bananas should equal, since bananas vary in size.  

The bigger problem is that the muffins barely rose and took 45 minutes to cook (brand new oven, worked fine with other recipes), not 15.  In addition, they weren't very flavorful.  The texture was nice, and I liked that it didn't call for xanthan gum like most other gluten free recipes, so I'll probably try again with some tweaks.

I am not gluten free, however as one of jehovah's Witnesses I have very dear friends that are.  Each assembly I bake a variety of cookies for the friends and this year I baked 4 different cookies or bars.  Two were gf recipes and 2 were converted from my old recipes.  All 4 were considered very good.  At that i found this recipe and made the bread last night which I shared this morning in the ministry.  One and all were very excited and loved what I did.  This bread was wonderful as gluten free, and very creamy.  Thank you

I added some vanilla extract and it tasted great! The only problem I had was I needed to bake it for 60 minutes instead of 30. I wonder if I add less banana next time will help.

Excellent! Made a couple changes by replacing applesauce instead of the butter (since I am also dairy free), added chopped walnuts and a dash of vanilla.  Baked the muffins for 30 minutes.  Turned out great!!!  My husband loved them and he is not gluten / dairy free.  Very Moist.

Good recipe.  I cut the sugar back to 1/3 cup.  I also used Earth's Balance natural buttery spread in order to make it dairy free.  If you need a good gluten-free flour blend recipe, check out http://www.naturalcookingrecipes.com/gluten-free-flour-blend-recipe

I did not have enough bananas so I cut the recipe in half. I used 2 bananas & added 1/2 Cup plain pumpkin, brown sugar (instead of the other sugar and maple syrup), and only used 1 Tablespoon of butter. These turned out so yummy! Oh and I also added pumpkin spice!

This is a good basic recipe that can be adjusted easily to taste.  I used Bette Hagman's GF flour mix with 2 tsp of guar gum added in.  Because of the reviews saying it was bland I followed advice and added the spices; never met a banana bread without spices (1 tsp cinnamon, pinch nutmeg, and pinch cardamom) and I went for the full teaspoon of salt.  I was looking for something to satisfy the sweet tooth and used 3/4 cup of sugar (no maple syrup).  5 bananas were plenty.  I used the muffin option, filled those cups to full and baked at 350 for 1/2 hour.  It made 18 muffins instead of the 24.  I never met a banana bread loaf that took less than an hour, so be sure and make that adjustment if making the loaf.  Turned out super tasty with myself and two kids as the reviewers!

Freakin' amazing!  My whole family thought so too.  I substituted honey for sugar and added about 2/3 cup  sour cream (you could also use plain yogurt) and 1 tsp. baking soda to the banana mixture.  Yummy!!!

I made muffins from this recipe and used one cup of oat flour along with one cup of all purpose gluten free flour. I also added 3 tablespoons of flaxseed meal and 1/2 cup of pecans. They needed to bake 45 or 50 min. at 325 to be completely done without getting dry. Delicious!!

This doesn't taste gluten free! Excellent moist texture! I only had five medium bananas.  I used a mini loaf pan, and had to bake for 45 minutes.  after the second round, I gave it a tbsp of cinnamon. We love it with peanut butter on it as a snack.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I used coconut oil in place of butter and sugar in the raw in place of the T sugar I also used 2 tsp of blue agave in place of maple syrup. I added organic chocolate chips and walnuts. I had to cook this for one hour. I think this was great. My husband loved it! Will be making this for now on. Thank you Christina for sharing a fantastic recipe.

I'll admit, I did alter the recipe…however, my loaf came out very moist with 5 bananas & baking for 45 min. I cannot imagine how everyone else's is turning out if they're using 6 bananas and only baking it for a half an hour.
This is how I altered the recipe intentionally & uninntenionally. Lemme explain…
I assumed you needed Xanthan gum so I added 1 1/2 tsp. My family likes pecans & cinnamon so I added 1 cup & 1 tsp respectively. And finally, as previously mentioned, I only added 5 bananas & baked for 45 min.
We really liked the flavour but it was very moist. I will make one final adjustment next time I make it & that is to bake it at 325 F for 45-60 min.

This was a great bread and I added a few things and wish I would have added some xantham gum.  I used the GF Bible all purpose mix which is a great blend of white rice, sorghum, tapioca, cornstarch and coconut.  I only used 1/2 the sugar and with a shortage of bananas, added some left over raspberries and chocolate chips.  A great GF bread!

Excellent Banana bread!! I made it with a friend who is gluten free and it was delicious. I was wary because the batter wasn't so yummy, but when it cooled out of the oven it was so delish!!

Very good! I loved the texture and they don't taste gluten-free at all! I added about a cup of chocolate chips to the muffins and they turned out great. They took 20 minutes to bake for me. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

For dairy free sugar free delights: Subbed coconut oil for butter and 12 packets of stevia for sugar. Added 1TB cocoa powder and 1/2 cup dairy free, sugar free dark cocoa chips. Deeeelish!

I am giving this one four stars, these muffins turned out pretty good. My kids and hubby loved them, and I ate more than one so all in all pretty tasty. What I didn't like is that the recipe called for an all purpose baking flour and since all gluten free flours are different it wasn't easy to see how these would turn out. I used ww all purpose  gf mix. They were a bit doughy inside even though I cooked them for over 30 min (in muffin tins). Hubby said they tasted creamy?? Idk but Give it a go there pretty good. I will try again with another flour mix!

I am not sure if it was just too hot to bake, but this bread is only so/so.  There are too many bananas and not enough bread and I only used 5 bananas (decent size though, so maybe I only needed to use 4).  The bread is dense and too moist....Uck. It tastes okay, but not great.  I wonder how regular sugar would work vs. the turbinado sugar?  I plan to tweak this to see if I can get it to come out better.

I used 1 1/4c bobs red mill gluten free flour mix, 3/4c almond/hazelnut flour, I added 1 tsp baking soda, 1 tsp vanilla, 1tsp cinn, and a dash or two of nutmeg. This made 6 generously sized "mega muffins". I did not use maple syrup, as my bananas were VERY ripe and very sweet. I resisted the temptation to add nuts or choc chips, but I may next time. these rose very well, I cooked for just under 30 min. The tops are a little crusty around the edges, the inside is moist and dense just like banana bread should be. I think next time I will try a different ratio of spices, as it just needs a little "zing", but overall, I am very pleased with the result!

This was so yummy!  My first endeavor with gluten free baking was a disaster, but this was excellent!  I used regular sugar, added a tsp of cinnamon and some xanthan gum.

It just didn't turn out at all for me. It was greasy with butter and too moist. The only changes I made was adding a few spoonfuls of applesauce because I was short 1 banana. I'm a veteran gluten-free baker and I've made several other gluten-free banana bread recipes that have turned out so much better - I won't be making this one again.

I just made these because I had a bunch of bananas that were turning faster then eaten. I can't eat much wheat or flour products it makes me sick afterwards. I used my gluten flour and baked these as muffins, figuring the kids could eat these for breakfast. I added some walnuts in it. Baked for 15-20 minutes. These came out great! My kids tasted them and loved them! I will make these again. Quick easy and healthy.

This recipe is GREAT! My kids loooved these!! 
I made a couple adjustments they are: 
for the gf flour mixture I used:
 1/2 cup rice flour
 1/2 cup sorhgum flour
 1/2 cup tapioca flour
 1/2 cup almond meal
In place of the turbinado sugar I used organic coconut sugar and replace the butter with organic extra virgin coconut oil. I also only had 4 ripe bananas so I threw in a couple handfulls of frozen blueberries. WOW!! They came out super moist and delicous! Not at all gummy like other recipes that I have tried. This is going to be a staple muffin recipe from now on in our home.. Looking forward to when Hubby gets home so I can watch him devour one and not realize that it is gluten free. hehe ;)

Egg free, replaced egg with ground flax/water (to act as the egg white) and added some veggie oil to act like the fat egg yolk.

Used a combination of Gluten free flour.

Used non-dairy butter.

Even my non-gluten free company loved it!! :)

I have mixed feelings about this recipe.  On one hand, I am new to the world of GF recipes so I think my taste buds are still adjusting.  That being said, bland is bland, gluten free or not.  I added a little vanilla and a dash of cinnamon, but I think it needed more.  The all purpose GF flour I used suggested using xanthan gum, so I did.  Maybe next time I'll try without, but honestly, the texture was fine.  I will make these again, maybe next time with a different flour, a little more vanilla and cinnamon, and using super over-ripened bananas.

My kids LOVED it!  I used spelt flour, so it was a little more dense, but that's the way we like it.  The loaf took 60 minutes to bake.

Followed directions completely except I ended up baking it for 60 minutes. At which point the outside was the perfect shade of brown, so I pulled it out of the oven. After it cooled, I cut a slice only to find lower half of the loaf still mostly unbaked ?? Tasted tested anyways - extremely sweet (explains kid approved). I will be trying again with one less egg, less butter & no sugar.

Gluten free recipes can be tricky, the end result depends on a lot of factors including the type of flour you use. I used Pamela's artisan bread mix for this recipe and thought it came out just ok. I added cinnamon and I think it could probably use a little bit of brown sugar. This tasted almost like regular bread to me, I like my banana bread to be on the sweeter side.

I tried the vegan version of this recipe, and the muffins were completely inedible.  Baked much longer than recipe stated, but texture was very dense and still gummy.  I think 8 bananas is probably way too many.  Very dissappointed!

I made this today and it was amazing.  I made a few alterations.  I used half almond and have GF oat flour.  For the banana's I only had two so I blended in 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 3 apricots. I have to admit this was the best banana bread I have ever eaten hands down

Good, especially for gluten free but I always sub vegetable oil for the butter as it makes a more moist, soft bread.  After the loaves are cooled, wrap in plastic wrap before eating at least overnight to improve flavor and texture

Great GF recipe! Like others, I did make minor adjustments: I used Earth Balance Coconut Spread as a replacement for the butter to make it dairy-free, I also added 1/2 teaspoon of xantham gum, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and used 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce in place of the sugar. The texture is wonderful - not crumbly or rubbery as some gluten-free products tend to be. The muffins rose nicely and were moist and very delicious! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

WONDERFUL base recipe for banana muffins - FINALLY I CAN BAKE AGAIN! Mine were not vegan (I used the 2 eggs) but I did use 1/2 cup of vegan stick butter. I used 2 cups of white rice flour, 3 tablespoons of apple sauce instead of maple syrup because I had none in my pantry. I only had 4 bananas so I went with that. I also added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and 4 teaspoons of ground flaxseed meal.  My 2 teenage boys (who don't eat dairy free/GF like mom has to do) RAVED about them.  I used a Pampered Chef muffin stone tray to cook them in and this recipe filled it completely; between letting the oveN heat with the stone tray + baking time it was roughly 38 mins in my oven.  These are moist and even better, don't cost $3.00 a piece like they do in the health food store. Thank you for this recipe!

I used Bob's Red Mill all purpose flour blend to make this bread; followed the recipe closely (except for bake time; I baked it longer, as reviewers recommended). It turned out like a sort of pudding, gooey flattened loaves in my pans. Such a disappointment! 
I wonder if having a measured amount for the bananas would help?

Terrible. I kept checking with a toothpick every 5 minutes after the 30 minute estimated bake time and after 60 minutes and the outside becoming almost burnt, I pulled it out of the oven. The inside was complete mush and the outside was rubbery. I even microwaved it for 6 minutes and that didn't help either. What a terrible waste of ingredients and time!

I very recently found out the I have a gluten sensitivity. This was very disappointing since I bake a lot. This was my first attempt to bake with gluten free flour and it turned out great! The bread was a little denser than I'm normally used too, but delicious none the less. A lot of people were complaining that the bread was too moist but it was just perfect for me. I added some cinnamon, vanilla, and chocolate chips. The bread does take a little different (not in a bad way) to me than my normal baked goods, but I think it might be the different flour. Also I notice the recipe didn't mention using xanthan gum but I added some since my flour bag said it was highly recommended to do this. All-in-all, this recipe is definitely a keeper for me!

Sooo yummy! I used this recipe to make muffins instead of bread. I used Gluten Free Pantry's muffin mix and also added cinnamon and vanilla, as others had suggested. I filled the muffin cups pretty much to the top and yielded 12 muffins. I only had 5 bananas on hand and they still came out perfect! Moist and tasty..the kids and I couldn't stop eating them!  You would never be able to tell that they are gluten free.

I made vegan substitutions to this bread and it is so incredibly yummy!  I used Bob's Red Mill gluten free all purpose flour, substituted 1 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons milled flax added to the dry ingredients, 6 tablespoons water added to the wet ingredients, coconut oil for the butter, and since I only had 4 bananas I subbed about 1/4 cup of applesauce for the remainder of the bananas.  The Bob's has beans in it so make sure it cools completely before eating and it loses the bean flavor.  This bread has the taste and texture of the traditional banana bread recipes without any guilt!

I changed the recipe considerably to make it low-fat and sugar-free, and mixed everything together using a food processor. It came out great. I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for the butter and 1 cup Splenda for the turbinado sugar, and I used sugar-free maple syrup. I also added 2 teaspoons of xanthan gum and 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon. First, I mashed the bananas and applesauce together in a food processor. Then I added the eggs, Splenda, and maple syrup and mixed everything together for a few seconds. Finally, I added the flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt and blended everything togther a few seconds until combined. I baked it in an 8x11-inch pan for 30 minutes.

Excellent recipe, tastes just like regular banana bread! I omitted the maple syrup and added walnuts and it was plenty sweet.

Well first of, I had to bake it for a full hour and a half. I think the recipe as written sounds kinda bland, so I added 1 tsp. of vanilla, and 2tsp. of cinnamon. The flavor is good, but honestly I think it could use a full cup of sugar. I will try that next time. I will make it again, but clearly it won't be the same recipe. Not that there is anything wrong with being healthy, I am a nutrition major, but you will need to add more sugar if you hope it will taste like its gluten filled counterpart.

After 30 minutes in the oven @350 F, and even after an hour, my loaf was still raw in the middle. I would recommend a much longer cooking time.

Followed the recipe exactly. Made both one loaf pan and muffins. Extended the muffins baking by 15 minutes and still underdone. I blew it with loaf pan even though I extended baking by 35 minutes. Yes- I have an oven thermometer.  Took it out and it fell. Kind of a custard consistency- my dogs loved bits of it as treats.  I did like the flavor, though. I will try again.

I make this all the time! depending on the type of flour used, they can vary in texture. You can substitute coconut oil for butter and they still taste great. I often add chocolate chips too for extra sweetness. Great recipe!

I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  I'd recommend testing with a toothpick and it may need extra time to be all the way cooked.

I’ve made this recipe three times now and have no clue what I’m doing wrong based on other reviews, if it’s my flour blends, or just me. Flour blends I used were King Arthur’s GF Measure for Measure and Better Batter All Purpose flour. First time making it I made two (as written with eggs and the other made using author’s recommendations for vegan). Followed the recipe as written and it took forever to bake…1hr 15 min and the center was still uncooked (cooked loaves separately). It was very dense and my husband felt it could use some cinnamon. Third time I followed the recipe with 5 bananas + 1 flax egg, added some ground cinnamon and vanilla extract, but results were the same—long bake time and dense, but flavor was better. I’m learning to bake gluten free, but suspect there’s just too many bananas in this recipe. If I make this again, I’ll reduce to 2-3 bananas or just 4 bananas (no eggs and no flax eggs) to see how it comes out. Thanks for helping me play and get rid of bananas, but this just isn’t working for us.

While the flavor is great and identical to the non gluten banana bread I make, the texture is quite doughy and I even cooked it longer than suggested.  I know gluten free baking takes some getting used to as the baked goods tend to be so dense.  I call this "banana pudding bread" =)

Made it in a cake pan instead of bread pan and frosted it with cream-cheese frosting. GF doesn't seem to rise as well as wheat flour, but still it tasted good.

I've made this recipe a dozen times. I have to say, it's quite a pain and I have to diverge from the recipe instructions to make it work, but I really enjoy the taste. I'm not culinarily advanced enough to know how to fix the issues I keep running into with it, but I'll just report what I've learned.

I cannot make this recipe in a loaf pan. It does not cook all the way through. I once left it in the oven for an hour and the middle was still completely uncooked batter while the outside was burnt. This has happened to me several times.

The best (and for me, only) way to make this recipe is with a muffin or cupcake tin, and liners. I will fill the cups 2/3 of the way and cook for about 20-25 minutes. Once they're done baking, I take them out and chill them in the fridge. 

Once they've completely cooled, I can peel the paper off. If I desire, I can then rewarm them in the toaster oven. But if I try to peel the paper off while they're still hot, half of it sticks to the paper. But chilled, they come off super clean. 

The other thing that helps immensely is adding a scoop or two of vanilla protein powder. Makes them more protein packed, and helps thicken the batter so it cooks easier!

I don't know if I'm just making this recipe wrong or what, but this is the only way I can get it to work. But once it's made, it's glorious. Great for when I have a little bit of hunger that I want to stave off for a larger meal, or a quick pre-breakfast in the morning.

This banana bread did not come out very well.  After cooking for about 1 hour and 10 minutes this bread was still under cooked.  In researching causes of  this I think is because there are too many bananas, which adds moisture to the dough.  I have not seen any recipes with this many bananas.

I was sorely disappointed with this recipe. I've never made "bleh" banana bread until now. I used Trader Joe's gluten-free flour blend, and cut the sugar down to about 1/4 cup with 5  very ripe bananas.  The bread turned out gluey in texture, bland in flavor, and was still way too sweet for my taste. I also had to double the baking time to get this fully cooked.

I had to throw out the muffins as they would NOT finish baking, even with almost two hours baking time. WAY to many bananas and to little baking powder. I found another recipe with 2 bananas, NOT six and two teaspoons of baking powder plus a quarter teaspoon of baking soda. That recipe worked OK.

Very good recipe.  I made it according to directions the first time, the exception being that it needed about 70 minutes baking time.  I measured the bananas, sort of, and it filled my glass pyrex 2 cup measure to heaping.  That amount of bananas worked fine.  It is a tasty, very moist bread.  The second time I made it I substituted molasses for the maple syrup and added some grated fresh ginger, about a tsp.  It is also very good and tastes more like gingerbread.

Made these tonight for an event at my work tomorrow. Gotta have GF option and I have Celiac so it’s a win/win. I followed the recipe and was going to do the suggestions of 1/2 sugar 1/2 honey. BUT...didn’t realize I was out of honey so I subbed Agave. I also had 11 bananas in my freezer. (I throw hem in there when they begin to turn for easy recipe use, don’t wanna waste). They turned out very good! Light in color but cooked through. Family didn’t know they were GF when I had them taste test either!

I made it with cafe gluten free flour and 5 bananas and used coconut sugar added nutmeg and cinnamon , I baked  it in a glass loaf pan greased with coconut oil and cafe gluten free flour then I mixed 1/4 cup of coconut sugar  and tablespoon of maple syrup and some cinnamon and took a knife and swirled it on top before baking some pecan would have been a great addition , I baked  for 30 min at 350 but was still not done lowered to 300 and baked till done checking every 12 min with a took pick it was moist and so very good like a cake saving this recipe forever Enjoy!

Tasteful! I added blueberries, ginger and cardamom. My cake required 60 minutes in the oven (30 minutes was way too short).

I followed this recipe exactly except that substituted turbinado sugar with raw cane sugar - it's all I had in hand. I mixed all the wet together in the stand mixer for quite some time (10 minutes or more) to thaw the bananas a bit more. I mixed the dry ingredients separately - Robin Hood Nutri Gluten Free flour blend, baking powder and a bit of xanthan gum (1tsp)... and then I blended tighten together. I used 6 bananas and so the batter was enough to completely fill one loaf pan - it took 55-60 minutes to cook through.

I made the bread mixture exactly as per the recipe. The only thing I did differently is added chocolate chips. It turned out horrible. I was very concerned about the number of bananas and my bananas were pretty large, but I went ahead and used four large ones, which was pretty much equivalent to six medium. I baked it for an hour and 10 minutes. It was like a VERY moist, super dense brick. I I won't make this recipe again.

This is the first gluten-free baking I have done besides doing some pancakes. The bread tastes really good! I had to half the recipe because I didn't have 6 bananas. In fact, I only had 2 bananas. I'd done regular banana bread with 2 so I figured it would be ok. The only issue I have is the bread didn't rise. I don't know if that has to do with missing a banana or what. I compared this recipe to a standard banana bread recipe (in my BH&G cookbook). The amount of flour, sugar, etc is definitely different. Also, it took closer to an hour to cook which is what a normal recipe calls for. I was going for taste & texture, however, and this bread had it!

Excellent finished product. Made a double batch and ended up with 4 - 1# loaves. Even though my loaf pans were the smaller 1# size, I still had to increase the cook time to 40+ minutes. Bread was golden on the edges and just beginning to get a little golden on top when the toothpick came out clean. Kids had some slices right out of the oven with a side of fresh berries, I did too! Delicious!

I did exactly what the recipe asked for except we have a maple allergy so we used honey instead and it was barely okay in taste and texture.  Slightly dry and bland actually.

This was okay.  It needs a little extra something though...maybe cinnamon and vanilla or some nuts.  I added some blueberries as well to mine.

Really impressed with my first GF baking. I made my own flour blend after consulting with a specialty whole food retailer (1/2C cornmeal flour, 1/2C white rice flour, 1/2C coconut flour, 1/4C almond meal, 1/4C rice bran)...used a 50/50 Splenda/coconut sugar blend, olive oil spread instead of butter and added 1ts vanilla, 1ts cinnamon and 1/2C chopped macadamia nuts. Sprinkled a little coconut sugar on the top. I baked this in a mini loaf pan (8 loaves) for about 45 minutes. So yummy, love the texture of the different flours. Want to add some chopped dates next time. I plan on having this as my easy breakfast, so full of goodness.

I didn't like this recipe, I have recently went gluten free due to gluten sensitivity. I was hoping this recipe would be moist just like gluten made banana bread. Like most said, it did take longer to bake which really isn't a problem. I made UDI's recipe for banana donuts, I think I will just use that for banana bread, because you wouldn't know it was GF. Thanks for the recipe though! For everyone else, I suggest tweaking it like most people have said they were going to do, I think it may turn out better with a twist or two done.

Hit with the whole family.  I just sprinkled the top with a bit of cinnamon and sugar to give it a more browned look since that is what they are used to seeing.

I make this bread often and my family loves it even more so when I add raisins.  It turns out so moist every time I think that has to do with the 6 bananas I whip together really well before I even add them.  I use a small and a large loaf pan and works better than using one large.  Yummy and no gluten!

This is the best and easiest gluten-free muffin recipe I have found so far. I'm already sharing this with GF friends. My non-GF husband really likes these also. Incidentally, I used dried lemon peel instead of lemon zest, reducing the amount slightly.

Very yummy indeed.  We used home ground rice flour and I did add a splash of vanilla after reading the reviews.  I also replaced the sugar with half as much splenda as my husband can not have sugar.   This came out very good.  We made them into muffins and ate half of them before they cooled completely.

I made this for my family, I cut the recipe in half since I didn’t have enough bananas, and I also used honey instead of sugar. I would have to say this was great. I don’t think I really got more than a slice, because my husband and daughter ate the rest the first day I made it. This time I will stick to the two loafs. Great Recipe, I will make this many times.

Realllly really good, definitely don't taste gluten-free! This is how I made them: Simply used a mixture of white and brown sugars, left out the syrup; Added a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon, some walnuts and chocolate chips, and a tsp of vanilla extract; Needed about 35 minutes in the oven for muffins

The result turned out it little too dry at the end. I had to bake it for longer than instructed. I also added cinnamon and raisins, walnuts, flax seed, sunflower seeds and it made it a little less boring.

Really yummy!! I added a cup of chopped pecans. My loaf took just under an hour to bake through in a convection oven at 350 degrees. I used a loaf pan. I think the baking times should be altered depending on loaf pan, cupcake pan or cake pan. It's pesky to have to keep checking it.

I just made this recipe and it turned out very good. The only thing different that I did was instead of sugar I used organic coconut sugar and instead of butter I used refined coconut oil. It was delicious and even my husband liked it!

We are a bit torn on this one... we loved it BUT it took a VERY long time to cook. It took an hour and could have cooked longer (in a loaf pan.) We were short on bananas so the flavor was probably not as strong as it could have been, but the kids still loved it...even the non-gf kids!

Excellent! I used 1/2 can pumpkin puree instead of two of the bananas.  Wow - did not taste GF.  This is a keeper.

Ok i just make this, but i use zuccini and banana, and cinn. I put hafe the batter in then sprinkaled cinn & sugar, then put the last of the batter in and sprinkal move cinn & sugar. But i had to bake for 90 min. I don't know why but i do live for then 16000 ft above sea leavel. I must say it is the best banana bread i ever had. one more thing i covered it after 60 min with foil so it wouldn't burn.
