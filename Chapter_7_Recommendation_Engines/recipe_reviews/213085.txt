I LOVE this recipe!  I make this in my crock pot - I throw all the ingredients in, except for the chicken sausage (becuase it can dry out if you slow cook - its fully cooked already) then about 10 minutes before its down, i throw the chicken sausage in!  Its so YUMMY!!

It was good.  I left out the soy beans, and cooked it covered for about an hour.  I also made a pot of spanish rice, mixed in a can of diced tomatoes, and mixed it all together.  Topped it with some shredded cheese, green onions, and sour cream.  It was perfect for a rainy day like today.
