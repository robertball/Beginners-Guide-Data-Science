This is a very good and easy sauce.  It reheats well too.  For a fast meal, I make the "A Good Easy Garlic Chicken" in the pan first and then this sauce.  I serve the chicken and sauce over whatever pasta I have on-hand.  The only thing I do different is to 1/2 the chicken bouillon and leave the sauce on the burner while stirring in the parm. cheese.  It's a definite keeper! *UPDATE* I've made this 3 times (w/the chicken) and each time it leaves me wanting to lick the bowl clean.

I loved this flavour!  I didn't use heavy cream - I used milk and it turned out very nicely still.  I used on chicken ravioli and it was delicious!

This recipe was absolutely delicious! and very easy to make.  I didn't have much luck with the parmesan.  It didn't melt into the sauce well - staying, rather, in a clump at the bottom of the pan.  

I used the sauce with gnocchi, asparagus and scallops.  I found it to be a good combination.  My friends were very impressed.  I will definitely make this again.

This dish is so fabulous...love it!  I actually added turkey sausage with it, it is a little less spicy so it doesn't overwhelm the sauce.  Also instead of heavy cream I used chicken stock and 1/3 less fat cream cheese, it is still creamy and yummy but a bit more healthy for you...great trick with any cream sauce!

This is a great recipe! I could only use ingredients I had. So what I did instead of using cream, I used 2% milk (1 1/2 cup) and omitted the chicken granules (I'm a vegetarian). I didn't have any parmesan cheese, I actually forgot to add regular cheese at the end. But it turned out really good. As a thickening agent I used a roux (2 TBSP of unsalted butter and 3 TBSP of flour) it worked really well. I would add though for fettuccine I would add a 1/2-1 cup of pasta water.

I followed the recipe exactly only adding a bit of  minced garlic and I found the sauce tasted more like a creamy "french onion soup" sauce possibly due to the carmelizing of the onions and the addition of the chicken bouillon.  In order to cut down on the sodium I used unsalted butter, 1 tsp. of sodium free bouillon and 1 tsp. of regular bouillon.  In order to avoid the cheese clumping into the sauce, while it was simmering I added the shredded parmesan a little at a time and whisked it in vigorously. I served it over penne pasta and topped it with a bit more shredded parmesan and fresh parsley.  My husband enjoyed it, but in the future I would use only 1 tsp. of bouillon and avoid carmelizing the onion.

This was a very nice and pleasant surprise for a quick and simple sauce that had me planning what to use it on the next time I make it. I admit, I forgot to get the heavy cream and didn't realize it until the last minute so I did sub evaporated milk for it. Everything else was done as per the recipe and it worked beautifully. Start to finish it was about 25 minutes til dinner was on the table. I served it over cheese tortellini. I also served a spinach salad on the side dressed with a strawberry vinaigrette and toasted almonds. A nice quick, meatless dinner in under a 1/2 hour. ...take that Rachel Ray :)

This recipe was so easy and tastes great! I added chicken breast strips and spinach to it and I used 1/4 cup Asiago with 1/4 parmesan rather than 1/2 cup of parmesan... I also added a dash of garlic. It looked nice on the plate and was very flavourful!

Superb! I saut√©ed onions, garlic, chick peas and swiss chard from our garden for about 30 minutes and prepared millet for the side. I drizzled this sauce over it all and it was perfect! I subbed 1/2 and 1/2 for heavy cream because it was what I had on hand. I imagine with heavy cream it would be simple divine drizzled over anything.


A quick and interesting sauce to add  something special to a dish.

This is a fantastic Balsamic Cream Sauce. I served it with penne pasta and chicken. My boyfriend and kids loved it.  It is a very easy recipe to follow and I highly recommend it.

Wonderful sauce!! I made it last night and served it over unsalted pasta! The texture is spot on - alot of sauces clump, but not this one. While making this i felt it was too salty, but once i mixed it with the pasta it was PERFECT! Make as is, or do what i did - I added roasted red & yellow peppers, garlic, and spinach - to create a type of Primavara. I also used 1/2 and 1/2 as i had it and not heavy cream, still came out thick and dreamy. Next time i will make this with ONE bouillon cube to see if it cuts the salty down, but otherwise this is truly a delish and EASY sauce to make. Cannot go wrong here!

Wow. THis was so good served over sauteed chicken and penne. I used only 1 tsp of chicken base rather than 2 tsp of boullion (which I think would've been quite salty).  Next time, I'll add sauteed mushrooms as well.   And there will be a next time...soon.

Delicious and lovely sauce! I made a few changes which worked out well: used shallots instead of onions, mixed 1 tblsp of corn starch with milk added that to 1/2 cup of milk in addition to the cream, and added 2 cloves of garlic to the sauce. Also skipped the ckn bouillon granules and doubled the balsamic vinegar & cheese. I mixed the sauce with fresh garlic linguine pasta mixed with sauteed spinach, mushroom, onions, and peppers.

this was very good but lack appeal there was no colour  so i would use coloured pasta so give this dish a bit of appeal 
I also added chicken breast cubes and green pepper and a bit of garlic (everything can use garlic)to the sauce over all a great sauce and will make a gain for sure!

This is a really excellent recipe - good consistency and good flavor. It's very easy to make too. I used milk instead of heavy cream for less fat. I served it on top of mushroom ravioli, but it seems so versatile that it would go well over almost anything. If you have trouble stirring in the cheese, use a more finely shredded or grated variety, keep on low heat, and stir for at least a minute.

OMG...I could eat this sauce with a spoon.  Made a few slight changes...added sliced mushrooms with the onion and carmelized them.  Seasoned them with a little bit of garlic salt & pepper.  Only used 1 tsp of boulion and used 3 tbs of balsamic and like 1/2 tsp of thyme.  Served over tortellini.  DELISH!!!!

This is an amazing dish that I've used many times over pasta and sometimes even over london broil (it's delicious). I add a whole onion because I like onions and I don't mince them I cut them thickly. Sometimes my guests don't like onions so it's easy for them to pick out. I also throw in some mushrooms at the beginning with the onions adds a deeper flavor. Sometimes that I've made it I have substituted the heavy cream for a bechamel sauce (1 cup milk + 1-2 T flour). I add the flour to the butter, onions, and mushrooms after they have cooked, then add the milk at the end. The sauce isn't as thick, which have been the only complaints.

OUTSTANDING! Simple, different, and so impressive. I used half and half instead of cream, and added garlic and basil. Made a double batch so I would have leftovers, but my boyfriend loved it so much the extra never made it to the fridge. I'll definitely make this again, and will add fresh mushrooms next time.

Just a tip... Be sure to use a good balsamic and cook it until it starts to reduce. This will cut the strong acidic flavor and bring out the sweetness. And if you have trouble mixing the grated parm into the sauce, skip the canned stuff and grate it yourself. Makes a world of difference.

Great sauce! Very easy to make! I poured this over whole wheat penne and it was delicious. I added saute chicken breast and black pepper and it was very yummy.

Excellent! I doubled the recipe, added some cut up chicken breast that I browned in oil in another pan, and used 1/2 c. cream and 1/2 c. milk instead of all cream.  Turned out terrific!  Even my picky 10-year-old loved it!

I could not believe this sauce.  I made as directed but minced a little more onion and added some minced garlic.  I used it for the Turkey and Blue Cheese Meatballs as had been suggested by a review review of the meatballs and it was sensational.  I then imagined how it would taste with beef stroganoff, over baked chicken, with any seafood or just about anything that required a cream sauce.  I will use it again and again.  Thanks Kevin

Oh yumm-o.  Since I discovered that I LOVE balsamic, it has been my new fav so I love anything with it, so far :-)  I saw the picture that mommyluvs2cook posted so I thought I would try it.  I didn't change it much, but I didnt have everything on hand and I really wanted to make it anyways.  No EVO, so I used canola.  I added a little extra butter.  I also added in some leftover chicken, part of a quarter, from the Tasty Baked Chicken from AR.  I only had 2% milk, so I also added about 2 TBS of yogart since I had it.  I wanted it a little thicker so I added a little cornstarch to some water and mixed it up before pouring it in to the mixture.  Then I realized I forgot the cheese, so that probably would have thickened it up plenty and I didnt have any parm so I topped our pasta w/sauce using Moz.  My daughter who is home from college today, requested a grilled cheese and I made this instead and we both LOVED it.  Thank you for sharing.

Mine turned out thinner than i expected, more like gravy than sauce.  I browned the onions too long and they are very dark clumpy bits in the sauce.  Despite this, it is rather tasty but nothing remarkable to look at.

Only 3 stars-all for the flavor. My sauce broke as soon as I poured in the cream. Correction, fat free 1/2 & 1/2 - note to self and others, NOT a good sub. No milk solids & will break and curdle because of the heat. BUT - It has a great flavor and I managed to save it with a slurry of cornstarch. We just didn't pay attention to the small white bits (looked like non dairy creamer sprinkled throughout). Served it over cheese tortolini w/steamed broccoli.

Good recipe!  The only change that I would suggest would be the one that other reviews has said, which was to reduce the amount of Chicken Bouillon granules.

I made this w/o the granules - added salt, pepper and garlic - and it was really good. It wasn't AWESOME but I had a bottle of store-brand $3 balsamic. I think with good quality vinegar, this'll be slap-yo-mama good!

I do have to say that this was some pretty good sauce!  I was wanting to make a quick side dish and I remembered recently seeing this recipe.  I decided to make it and throw over some pasta to have.  It was great!  I loved the flavor that it got from the balsamic.  It was very nice!  It had a nice texture, not to thin and not to thick.  I do agree this would be great over lots of things...chicken, asparagus, even steak!  For steak it would be good to reduce the cream in half, so it gets thicker, and to pour over top of them.  YUM! Im going to have to try that next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I had saved a tablespoon of the glaze from Filet Mignon with Rich Balsamic Glaze from a previous meal, and I was looking for a way to extend it for another meal.  I stumbled on this, and am I ever happy with that find!  I made it as written with the exception of using only one teaspoon of the bouillon.  Served over a little angelhair pasta with chicken cooked with a little olive oil/balsamic mixture, this was superb.  I saved the shaved parmesan for the finishing touches.  I may dream about this yummy taste!  Next time?  Maybe mushrooms, since those flavors certainly would mix well.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Wonderful flavor!  Served with whole wheat penne, grilled chicken and asparagus.  We are trying to eat a little more health, so I used 2% milk instead of cream.  Forgot to make the roux as suggested by an earlier review (2 TBSP of unsalted butter and 3 TBSP of flour).  It was watery, not a cream sauce, but still had wonderful flavor.  Will also cut down on the butter next time, esp. if it is extra is added in the roux.

This sauce was absolutely delicious.  Served it on top of the Garlic Chicken recipe from this site.  We also dipped our bread and baked potato in the sauce.  Not sure about the negative reviews.  The sauce was creamy and had a wonderful flavor.  The only change I made to the recipe was adding garlic.

My husband and I both love this.  We've used it twice, both on pork chops.  The only change I made was to use fat free half-and-half instead of cream, and we used chopped shallot instead of onion (we halve the recipe and 1/8 of an onion is just annoying, so we use half of a shallot).  Can't wait to try this with pasta and chicken!

This sauce is delicious! I put in 1 onion and did not use the chicken bouillon granules because I did not have any. I also used 2% milk instead of the heavy cream to reduce the caloric and fat content. I also added 1 potato chopped up. It turned out great! As another reviewer suggested I made the "A Good Easy Garlic Chicken" recipe from this site for the chicken. After the chicken was about cooked I put it in the sauce to simmer and soak up the flavors. We will definitely make this again in our home!

This was really good.  I had to sub milk for cream, but turned out really yummy.  Served over homemade pierogies and baked chicken.  Next time I will cut this recipe in half.  I made a LOT and a little goes a long way!

I was looking for a basic cream sauce recipe to use up some heavy cream I had in the fridge.  I wasn't interested in any that I saw until this one; I had all the ingredients and it looked very simple to do.  I served it over whole grain penne, and my hubby loved it over the spiced pork loin I served this evening.  It made a very simple meal seem very elegant.  The balsamic vinegar gives this a wonderful flavor! I give this an enthusiastic thumbs-up!

Great!  Followed recipe as is.  I felt the need to add some salt to it and will next try with regular parmesan cheese vs the grated. All in all a fantastic recipe.

This recipe was interesting... I don't know if I've ever cooked with balsamic vinegar before, so that was a new experience for me.  It was very different from anything I've ever made before.  I won't be making it too frequently, but it will be good as an occasional meal.  I too followed another reviewers advice and served it with "A Good Easy Garlic Chicken" and linguine noodles.

Delicious!!! Made 6 servings rather than 4.  Also added 1 clove of garlic. Used as a sauce for a mixture of penne, sauted spinach and sliced beef tenderloin.   Turned out a fantastic one-dish  meal.  Thanks for the recipe. Will make this sauce over and over.

Fantastic sauce.  I added chopped mushrooms,and lots of sliced garlic, and topped with fresh minced parsley.  My son said mix half the sauce into the pasta and pour the rest over the top.  Loved it - even using 1/2 cream and 1/2 milk. Update: w/2 lbs pasta I use 1/2 c olive oil, 1 chopped onion, 1 cup balsamic vinegar, 3 lrg portabello mushrooms chopped, 6 T chicken bullion, 1 qt milk, 3 c heavy cream, 2 8-oz pkgs Sargento parmesan.  LOVE IT for 12-16 people!!!!

This has got to be the best sauce ever and easy to make.  I think the key is to make sure you really carmelize those onions.  I recommend going by the recipe of 15 minutes on the onions.  The flavor of the carmelized onions makes it.  I also put chicken and either penne or rigatoni noodles in it.

This was very good. I served it over chicken. Went together very easy. I used fat free half and half instead of the heavy cream other than that made it as written. Next time I am going to try it with shrimp and some veggies...Thanks for the recipe!

My family didn't like this at all. I was expecting a thick, cream sauce and this was definitely not thick or creamy. The only change I made was to cut the chicken bouillon amount in half. We've never had balsamic vinegar, so I thought maybe it's an acquired taste. But my sister-in-law who loves balsamic vinegar wasn't a fan, either. She said the texture was weird and she couldn't really taste the vinegar.

I used a little less dairy (i used milk) than called for to make it a more hearty sauce. I served it over parmesan chicken and mushroom/broccoli rice. This is a keeper.

Very good!  This is what I did:  I sauteed onions and mushrooms together in some butter, olive oil, garlic, and S&P then made the sauce in the same pan.  I used half and half and added some parsley.  I used the sauce to top chicken that I had coated in parmesean and bread crumbs and cooked on the stove top.  Served with broiled red potatoes (from this site) and green beans- the combination was wonderful!  Made for yummy leftovers :)

I thought this sauce was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding a tsp of garlic when I sauteed the onion. This is a quick and easy sauce that can be prepared in no time at all, perfect for those days when you arrive home late from work but still want to prepare a delicious meal for your family. This won't be the last time I make this recipe.

O.M.G. This sauce is great with EVERYTHING! Wonderful mix of flavors that truely complement eachother. I've already made this with chicken, lamb, beef... even as the "gravy" for plain mashed potatoes.   Excellent every time.

Fantastic sauce. I served it with a recipe from this site called A Good Easy Garlic Chicken. I cooked the chicken, removed it from the pan and made this sauce in the same pan scraping the flavors from the chicken recipe into the sauce. I did not have heavy cream but the half & half worked out just fine.  Made whole wheat noodles and asparagus and served the sauce over every thing. Great flavor.

Yes yes yes! Really good restaruant quality flavor. Loved it. As usual I didn't have everything it called for, so here's what I did. I was generous with the butter and olive oil. I minced a half an onion (and threw in some minced garlic) and sauted it for a bit until real soft.  Then I sauted chicken breast strips that I had cut in the oil/butter/onion mixture.  Then pulled out the chicken when done and set it aside, covered. Then I added the balsamic to the pan (I already had some in the fridge that I reduced slightly with a little sugar) and let it simmer on medium-high heat for another 3 minutes or so. I didn't have the granules, so I put in about a quarter cup of chicken stock. Let that simmer for another minute or two. I seasoned it heavily with "rustic italian seasoning" (from Costco, a blend of basil, rosemary, oregano, garlic, salt, etc.). Then put in the half and half (didn't have cream). Let that simmer for 5 minutes. Then, in a separate small dish, I disolved about a tablespoon of flour with a little bit of the simmering sauce and two big spoonsful of hot water from the pasta I had boiling. Then I whisked that back into the simmering sauce. Then once it thickens up a bit, its done. I put the chicken back in the simmering sauce and voila! The sauce was so darn good as it was, I didn't want to put the cheese in the pan. So I let everyone put the parmesan on his or her own helping, as desired. We ate it with pasta and sauted zucchini. Absolutely delicous.

This was really good!  I used 1/2 cup cream and 1/2 cup skim milk in an attempt to cut down the fat.  I also did not have enough of the cheese so I had to add a handful of shredded italian mix cheese.  This tasted wonderful on top of baked chicken and grilled asparagus.  I think this would be wonderful on pasta in place of an alfredo sauce.

This was awesome! I added a little extra balsalmic and chicken bouillon. Plus some milk and sour cream to make it a little creamier. I topped this on noodles with chicken and added peppers, green onions, celery, and tomatoes. Brilliant!

Great taste fast and easy. I had to fudge on the ingredients as this was a last minute quick sauce for pasta so I used what was on hand - one cup of Trader Giotto's grated Parmesan and Romano and added a handful of ready made bacon crumbles and already liquid soup stock. Mixed in the already cooked cold penne till it was hot.  Served with a sprinkle of parsley. Hubby and I loved it.

This will most definitely be in our regular rotation; it's THAT delicious! I know it's a winner when the BF says "you can make this again!" I omitted the chicken granules as I don't eat meat and found that the sauce was wonderful without it. I also used a combination of fat free half and half and regular half and half with great results.  No problem with the cheese clumping; adding it slowly prevented this.  I think I'll add a little more balsamic vinegar next time.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

We're HUGE fans of balsamic vinegar so I think when I was done, I put in about a 1/4 cup.  Great sauce!

This recipe was awesome! I cooked it for my boyfriend, and I was a little worried since I'd never made it before, but it knocked his socks off. The only thing I would suggest is using less bouillon. It was just a little salty for us. But it wasn't that big of a deal. I will definitley make this again!

It wasn't for everyone. I used real parm cheese not the sprinkle type. It didn't melt as smoothly as I wanted. Out of my family, 3 liked it, 2 tried and didn't like it and 2 didn't even try it. If you really like balsamic vinegar, you will like this. Picky eaters probably won't enjoy. The color was a little off-putting (a creamy brown).

It was delicious. Used 1/2 cup of light cream and an extra tbsp of balsamic. Parmesan cheese was good, but next time I will use less - enough good flavours.

I used more onion - because I love onion! And I think it would have been better if I‚Äôd cooked the balsamic vinegar down a bit longer - the sauce was still a little too acidic. But I‚Äôm not a sauce pro, and this still turned out great, to complement my pork medallions!

Made a non-dairy version using coconut cream and nutritional yeast flakes and this turned out AMAZING!!!!!!! Very rich and flavorful. We poured it over roasted chicken and roasted red potatoes- it tasted the best of potatoes. I would straight up drink this sauce ??

It's ok in a pinch. The bullion makes it very salty and it's relatively thin. I was hoping for something much creamier.

Yum!!! So simple, but truly plate-licking good! I had a lot of leftover balsamic-marinated grilled chicken from a chicken caprese salad I made for lunch and I wanted to  use it up, but didn't want to just have the same thing again for dinner so I looked and found this recipe. I omitted the balsamic vinegar from the sauce because the chicken already had a very strong balsamic flavor, but combined with this sauce it was absolutely delicious!  I also added some roasted asparagus and served over linguine. My husband raved!

This was a very delightful sauce. I too thought that the balsamic vinegar added a twist.  My husband really liked it and so did I, and mom did too.  I made it and put it over baked salmon and baked tilapia.  Very, very good. Will definitely be making again.  I wish there were 10 stars.

Wow!  Simply and delicious.  I added chicken, fresh tomatoes and marinated artichokes into the sauce and poured over fettuccine pasta.  This is a very versatile sauce and could easily be spiced up with chili powder and sausage for an andouille type meal.

I loved this recipe. Very easy, ready in a few minutes and allowed me to do something different for lunch. To lower the fat level, I replaced the heavy cream by lean yoghurt, and used less parmesan.

Used ingredients on hand: Substituted 1 diced leek for onion, part of 1 packet vegetable flavored Swanson's "Flavor Boost" for bullion cubes, added chopped prosciutto after leeks had saut√©ed to golden brown, then proceeded with a sweet balsamic vinegar per rest of recipe. Served over hearty Penne Rigate pasta and garnished with capers. Easy, delicious, fairly quick, forgiving and interchangeable ingredients. Family raved over it.

This review is a long-time coming! I have been using this recipe for four years now and have used this sauce on everything from linguine to chicken to sauteed mushrooms and more. In fact, this recipe was the reason I signed up for an Allrecipes account in the first place. It's just simply delicious and so versatile. Thank you for an incredible recipe!

Just OK.  The Parmesan did not incorporate into the sauce, it ended up being a big glob and I had to fish it out to make it edible.  I have made many fettuccine sauces without ever having this problem, I suspect it either has something to do with the acidity of the balsamic or the fact that the cream was warm, I feel the parm and cold cream should have been added at the same time.  Aside from the cheese debacle, I found the sauce to taste mostly like onion, the balsamic did not shine through at all, I really like balsamic and love cream sauces, but I will not be using this recipe again.

Wow! Wanted to lick the pan.  I modified it to go with a pork shoulder roast that I had thrown in the slow cooker on low and slow with 10 shakes of worcestershire sauce and some Italian rub.

I followed the recipe as written , but I used shallots instead of onions, chopped fine.  Also, I used Better than Bouillon Beef flavor instead of chicken bouillon granules, and grated parmesan off the big block from Costco. Delicious!

Delicious!!!  I have been looking for a recipe similar to "Kelsey's" Balsamic Chicken and I have found it!!  This is so good.  I was skeptical about the balsamic vinegar and the cream, surprisingly it went well together.  I added 2 cloves of minced garlic with the onion and the butter/oil mixture.  I also didn't have enough cream and used some milk as well.  It wasn't very thick so I added about 1 tsp of flour at the end to thicken it and it did the trick.  Served it with garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed red pepper and asparagus.  YUM!

I made this sauce and added browned chicken and fresh mushrooms served over pasta.   It was so flavorful and delicious.   I used milk and will try cream next time.   I added 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar and more Parmesan cheese but other than that changed nothing.

A little too much on the sweet side for my taste, probably because of the caramelized onions. Also not very appealing visually. Don't think I will make this again.

Delish!  Just topped chicken and cheese ravioli with this sauce.  A great alternative to alfredo when you don't want a tomato sauce.

This one is a keeper!! I'm a newly wed and trying this whole "cooking dinner" thing. My husband couldn't wait to taste this while I was cooking it. We both loved it! It was just as good the next day for lunch! I also used milk instead of cream, but it still turned out awesome!

Absolutely delicious.  Even my 10 & 11 yr old grandchildren love it.  I served it over some bow-tie pasta and added some grilled chicken for some protein and sauteed mushrooms on the side.  Next time, I'm going to try it as a sauce over some chicken and rice.

Great recipe!  I only used 1 tsp of the chicken bouillon, and it was delicious!  Husband and I loved it but, alas, the kids (ages 3 and 8) did not.  :(  Oh well, it will be a grown up dish.

Super mega delicious! This is my go-to dinner. I have served it with broccoli, Quorn chicken, mushrooms, spinach and the whole spectrum of pasta! I usually add a bit of minced garlic in with the onions because garlic is my jam! Parsley makes a lovely addition at the end as well. This is my all time favorite All Recipes find!!! Yum x 1,000,000!

I wasn't sure if I would like this, but wow, it was divine!  LOVED the flavor, even if my onions got a little too done.    Just before serving, I added a couple handfulls of chopped fresh baby spinach, then served this over grilled chicken and cheese tortellini.  Will make again!

This was absolutely delicious!  I added a clove of garlic, pressed, at the end of carmelizing the onions, used chicken base instead of granules, and added sauteed chicken breast and asparagus. I used Romano instead of Parmesan, freshly grated, and added it a little at a time. At the end of stirring it in, it seemed to be a little stringy, so I stirred in a tablespoon or so of the liquid that had collected in the pan when I sauteed the chicken and asparagus pieces, and that loosened it up nicely. All in all, I will DEFINITELY be making this one again!

I made this sauce to top some chicken and it was SO good!  I completely forgot to add the parmesan...but it turned out nicely anyways.  I will be making the sauce again (and this time include the parmesan cheese).

Awesome as is. My husband's eyes rolled into the back in delight when he took his first bite. And the kids didn't even detect the onions (minced them ultra fine).   Thanks, Kevin.

This is absolutely delicious.  I served it over pasta stuffed with mushrooms and it was wonderful.  I used the shredded parmesan do the texture wasn't grainy.  We eat this once a week.

This was SO amazing!  My family loved everything about this sauce.  I added and extera tablespoon or two of balsamic vinegar. This recipe reminded me so much of my Grandmothers cooking.  It's a great comfort food.

All in all a great sauce- but would also cut back on the bullion- it ws a bit salty for me. Used Locatelli instead of parmesean- maybe that was part of the problem. Will def make again!

This sauce is full of flavor.  I made 2 batches...one was served over tortellini and husband devoured it.  The second was served with whole wheat pasta, broccoli, chicken, sundried tomatoes & fresh corn cut from the cob.  Both were great!

Ummm....Soooo GOOD!!! I sauteed fresh mushrooms and garlic with the butter and oil and left out the chicken bouillon b/c I didn't have any. Used half and half instead of heavy cream and it turned out GREAT!!! Served over spinach and cheese tortellini with a side of garlic grilled chicken. Yum!!!

This was very good, rich sauce.  Served with AR's  Garlic Chicken.  Next time, I think I will just add chicken strips to the pasta and sauce.  Since the sauce was so rich, it needed a less seasoned chicken.

This sauce is amazing.   Reheats well and is so so good.  I put it on some stuffed chicken breasts and mashed potatoes.   Can't wait to see what else to put it on.  This will be my new gravy.

Very yummy sauce, but I couldn't get my grated Parmesan cheese to melt, which is ok. I used this on top of A Good Garlic Chicken from this site. My boyfriend even rated this sauce as a 5, and he rarely gives all 5 stars. I also poored this on top of mashed potatoes. I imagine it would be great on pasta or rice as well... Thanks for the great recipe!

This sauce is insane, super rich and decadent.  I served it over roasted chicken , red potatoes and asparagus.  I followed the recipe exactly (even the heavy cream) and it paid off.  I swear I have tasted this sauce at a posh British restaurant in London.  I will definitely make this one again.

Oh my! This was absolutely one of the best sauces I've ever had. I served it over pasta with chicken and asparagus. I didn't change a thing (and wouldn't)!  I highly recommend that you give this one a try, because you won't regret it (even the extra calories are worth it).

Very Good indeed !  Left out the parmesan because I didn't have any and it turned out just fine. Next time I will try it with the Parmesan though.

Delicious!  I had to use beef bouillon granules and cheddar cheese because it was all I had, and the sauce still turned out yummy.  I can't wait to try try this again with the chicken bouillon and some of my other favorite cheeses.

Very good - almost 5 stars. It was a little heavy-handed on the chicken bouillion for me, so I cut it in half - I'm not really sure it needs it at all, may try without next time. I used onion powder instead of onion because I didn't feel like chopping, and made my sauce in the pan I browned my chicken breasts in. Added a little black pepper when served. Thanks! :)

Very nice flavor, although a bit too rich and thick.  Next time I will try adding a cup of so of milk in addition to the cream.

We really liked this and would make it again. I added chicken to it. Next time, I think I would cut back on the vinegar though.

Followed recipe exactly. YUM! If you like balsamic and you like cream sauces this is the recipe for you! Balsamic vinegar in a cream sauce may seem weird but works great. I made this for my sister for her birthday with just saut√©ed mushrooms over penne and we couldn‚Äôt stop eating it!  Unlike other reviewers who said they had trouble mixing in the cheese, I had no problem. Like any other sauce with cheese you just have to make sure to simmer first, and add cheese slowly while stirring constantly. Now stop reading reviews and make this recipe!

I made this sauce and added chicken breast with brocolli and red pepper served over elbow maccaroni.  I would say this sauce lacks a bit of the zip that I thought it would have.  I probably should have added some salt and pepper when preparing it.

I added mushrooms to this and served it over a chicken breast and pasta.  It was very good but my husband thought the balsamic was a little on the strong side and part of that might have been the kind I used since I pulled out the good stuff for this recipe and not my usual cooking bottle.

I think it's a great sauce, but I definitely made a mistake along the way.  I tried using light cream instead of heavy cream, and I accidentally left out the butter.  I also used light cheese.  I found even before I added the cheese it was forming small clumps.  I'm not sure if this was because of using light cream or not.  It still had the right flavouring, so we got over it, although I did add a bit of skim milk to try and thin it out a bit.  Tastes great, though!

Best cream sauce. I used only the butter to saute' the onions. Used white vinegar and milk instead of cream. Thickened with flour. Made this twice now and added some mix vegtable's to the noodles and put the sauce on top.

I didn't care for this.  All the different flavors clashed.  Plus like another commenter said, the grated cheese didn't mix well with the cream sauce, even though I added it a little at a time.

I absolutely loved this recipe, it's very unique!  My picky eaters didn't care for it but my mother and myself thought it was restaurant quality, yummy!
