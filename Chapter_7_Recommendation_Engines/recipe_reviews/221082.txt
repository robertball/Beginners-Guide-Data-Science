I made this for a family barbeque. Because we don't like green bell peppers, I used one large bell pepper in exchange. I also added some shredded sharp cheddar cheese. The italian dressing I used was Newman's Family Recipe Italian Dressing. Very simple. I liked that this used ingredients that I had on hand and it literally took 15 minutes to throw together. Everyone seemed to like it--my aunt took all the leftovers home.

Very, very basic pasta salad but cool and refreshing.  Easy to make, loaded with veggies, and great for a summer evening!

I didn't have green, so I used a red and yellow bell pepper. I'm not a fan of the celery in this. I like the cucumber though. I added some green peas. I used Bruschetta Italian Vinaigrette by Wishbone. For leftovers I wanted to make this a meal, so I added pepperoni, chunked cheese, onions and carrots, then spruced it up with more dressing and we had dinner.

I absolutely love this recipe. I omitted the green bell pepper, used Kalamata olives instead of regular, and added a carton of peppercorn feta. It makes plenty to share.

This was very easy to make.  Overall, a good base to start with.    There is more room to add or subtract from the recipe.  I highly encourage anyone to enjoy trying different variations each time.  Enjoy!
