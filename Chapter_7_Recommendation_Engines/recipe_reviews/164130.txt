Well, not every recipe can be a homerun.. I gave this one 3 stars because it does have the potential to be great.  1st and foremost if you make it as written, you better like salty foods.  Next time I'll add the salt after the quinoa is done cooking before it cools.  Black pepper could be switched for white pepper, or eliminated all together.  Instead of garlic powder and salt try a good solid 1/4 tsp garlic salt or what I'll be trying next time is Garlic gourmet Zesty Garlic.  I added apricot because my mango was pretty small, next time though I think I'd like to add some color intstead, cranberries has been mentioned but I think strawberries or tart cherries would also freshen it up a bit.  I also toasted some almonds and gave em a rough chop.  I'll definately try it again, but absolutely not as written.

This was great, but I changed a lot!  1) I used 2 tsp curry powder, 2) I added a stalk of celery, 3) I added a few sliced almonds, 4) I didn't have quite enough mango so I added a few dried blueberries, 5) I used red onion instead of green onion, and 6) I omitted the salt.   I thought the flavor was great except it was too much black pepper for my liking.  It just didn't seem to flow with the fruit.  So I think next time I will just put a dash in or so.

Made it for a potluck at work and got rave reviews.  I added 20 whole almonds to the recipe.  The almonds provided a great crunch to the salad.

This was my first foray into quinoa and it won’t be my last as I enjoyed it very much.  I didn’t find this recipe too salty, but that is very dependent on the broth that you use (so taste test before adding the salt and add a little at a time).  I made the recipe as is and taste tested each step of the way (just to see what adding each thing did for the flavor).  I used an African curry that I brought back from Morocco which really complimented the sweet mango flavor well.  For texture I added pine nuts right at the end.  I also confess, I didn’t wait for this to cool down…I ate it hot and loved it.  I’ll experiment a little with the leftovers (trying it cold for one).  I think adding a squeeze of lime and a little cayenne could step this up a notch, but this was delicious as is.

This had nice flavor. Everyone seemed to like it. I liked that it didn't make 12 gallons of salad. My mango was pretty ripe, so it added a nice juicy flavor, but didn't do much for the texture in my opinion. Was really easy to make in stages -- cooked the quinoa, then fed a baby, chopped a mango, fed a baby, chopped an onion, fed a baby, mixed and served. Enjoy.

This is a delicious basic recipe.  I love that the flavor is boiled right into the quinoa.  The first time I made this, it was precisely to recipe, with rave reviews.  Since then, I have made different variations, with bell peppers, red onion, tofu, or even served hot stuffed in acorn squash.  Perhaps my only complaint is that unless your fruit/veggies are nice and juicy, it can taste a little dry.  I add a bit of oil and balsamic vinegar or lime juice to make it more moist.

I'm hoping that a better mango will make this dish taste better.  I liked it...it was just lacking something.  Wish I could figure it out.

Very good!  I love savory recipes that include fruit.  I used Inca Red Quinoa and that added a very nice burgundy color to the yellow mango and green onion.  I would also cut back a bit on the green onion.  Delicious, protein-rich side dish.

This was absolutely delicious!  I added the cranberries and almonds as other reviewers mentioned and it provided for a wonderful blend of flavors.  I liked it better cold and it held up in the fridge for 3 days.

I liked it well enough but my fiance did not like the mango.  Apparently he hates mango.  I read a review suggesting using less green onion and I almost did that, but then figured it didnt look like much, but after eating it, I realized I did not enjoy the green onion taste in this dish.  I would cut out the onion, increase the curry a lot and maybe substitute the mango for something we both like.

I love this recipe!  I use low sodium chicken boullion (sp?), and last time I just dumped in the powder after cooking in water.  Even my kids love this recipe - super healthy and super easy! 
Hint - I use frozen mangos, which makes the recipe easier and cheaper.

Fabulous!  That is because I used a miso soup base instead of the chicken stock, and used a diced medium onion instead of the green onions.  The frozen mango's I had in the freezer gave this dish the perfect sweetness.

Very tasty side dish, although I changed it a quite a bit.  First I sauteed 1/4 an onion and 1/4 a red bell pepper, before adding a garlic clove and the quinoa. I omitted the salt altogether.  Also, I added a handful of raisins along with mango.  Finally, I tossed in cilantro in place of the green onions.  My family loved it!

This was good - but pretty salty! I'd cut back on the salt if you're serving as written as a salad. I served it as a warm side dish for apple marsala pork chops and "sweet and savory kale" (from this site). The saltiness worked only because I purposely undersalted the pork i made after tasting the quinoa.

Simple to prepare, attractive presentation, and oh, so tasty!  I did increase the garlic powder to 1 tsp, but that was to suit our tastes.  Thanks for sharing.

I made the dish according to the recipe and found it a little boring. I had to add some chopped almonds and cranberries to make it a little more interesting.

OMG delicious and totally boyfriend approved. The only think I would do is cut back on the curry powder (1 tsp instead of 1.5) and cut back a little on the green onion (maybe 1 or 2 instead of 3)...or leave in 3 but don't put in much of the green stem parts.

Just a little too strongly flavored for me.  I ended up making a second batch that was a little less spiced and together they were great!  Used frozen mango already diced from Trader Joes!  Always have some on hand in the summer!

Really great, but next time I might scale back the curry a bit.  I loved the flavor, but it was so strong here that I felt it overwhelmed the mango, which is by far my favorite part of the dish.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Overall flavor was pretty good, but it was waaayy to salty.  If I try it again, I will omit the salt completely and let people add their own if they want it.

Fantastic and even better the next day!  Added red bell peppers and served with chicken.  The english cucumber was fantastic.  I may never go back!  As suggested, I doubled the curry.  I couldn't find mango chutney so I used mango salsa.  It was ok but spicier than I expected.  Next time I'll track down that elusive chutney.  Worth repeating!

Wow! I've never had quinoa before, but have just started the Elimination Diet and was looking for recipes using it as a base. This was delicious and will make my diet easy to get through!  I would agree with other people's comments that there was too much salt (and I like salt). I would cut the salt in half. I also doubled the pepper (but I like food with a kick). I only used 2 green onions instead of 3. Lastly, I didn't have cranberries (per other people's suggestions) and almonds are not allowed in my diet, so I used sunflower seeds.  It was delicious! Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is EASY and wonderful!  My friend and I absolutely loved it.  When I make it again, I will add less salt or use a low sodium chicken broth though because I made it with regular chicken broth and it was a touch too salty.  I also added too many green onions (they were too large) and that was a bit overpowering.  However, it was still delicious!  And I will definitely be making this many times more.

This was a very good recipe, although I did not use the mango and green onion.  My youngest who is very picky will never eat quinoa, and did made this way.  I served curried honey mustard chicken (from this site) over top (instead of adding the mango and green onion) and it was great!

This was very good and healthy too! I added blanched snap peas (cut in half), dash of tumeric and some fresh lemon juice to brighten the dish! I bet it would be good with garbanzo beans too for more protein and a different texture.

I really liked this and it was liked by my guests but I thought it was salty and not curry enough so next time I make it I will reduce the salt by at least half and add about half again as much curry.  I also doubled the recipe.  As far as being able to put anything in it...well you can.  It reminds me of tabouli that way but depending on what you put in it it might need a different name!

Absolutely loved it!  Even my finicky m-I-l loved it. I read thru some of the comments & threw in some basil - yum!  Next time I'm going to chop up some almonds or pecans and maybe try some other types of curry. This dish will become a frequent visitor to our dinner table.

Made this as a side dish for marinated steaks tonight and it was delicious! I used low sodium organic chicken broth (70 grams v. 570 grams sodium) and I think that helped cure the saltiness issue mentioned in previous reviews. My husband took a second helping!!

I made this for one of my fast days on the 5:2 diet as it's fairly high protein and low fat. I didn't have a mango so I used half a can of pineapple chunks in juice. The sweetness worked well but it needed some more kick so I added some chili flakes. I would definitely make this again and will experiment with adding different veg such as sweetcorn and peas and will buy a mango next time.

This is great for summer. First off, I put in fresh minced garlic & then I added a few things: cranberries, cucumbers, cilantro & for a little more of a hearty meal, curried chicken chunks. If you have a Trader Joe's nearby, they have already seasoned/marinated curry chicken tenders. Cut them up into but sized pieces before you cook them & add them in. So awesome!! Bring that to your next outing!!

I cut salt in half and probably could cut more.  I added about 1/4 red bell pepper and one stalk celery ( both chopped). I used frozen mango partly thawed that thawed rest of way when I mixed it with the hot quinoa.  Also added 1 clove fresh chopped garlic to the hot quinoa.  It was very good right away and excellent cold for lunch for the next two days!

I had a salad similar to this at a restaurant, only it was pretty greasy. Found this recipe to taste very similar w/o the grease and fat. Add whole almonds for a great twist. This will be a hit at any party and only takes about 15 minutes to make! LOVE it!

Great idea but way too salty, I would try a sodium free stock or adding desired amount later on.  I love the cranberries idea, I did add some almonds but celery will be my next addition!

Thought this was great the second time around when I made some adjustments. There was too much green onion for my taste as the recipe is written. I have also made this with yellow onions and enjoyed that as well. A few walnut pieces sprinkled in add texture, flavor, and protein.

I seem to be inexplicably unable to cook whole grains.  I even checked my Betty Crocker whole grain cookbook (which said to cook the quinoa 10-to 12 miniutes).  I checked it after 12 miniutes and it was no where close to done.  Then I checked it after 20 miniutes and it was still hard.  It ended up taking 30 miniutes and had the consistancy of cream of wheat.  I would never downgrade a recipe due to my whole grain impairment though.  We loved the flavors, the mango was excellent (I found a really good one).  We did end up eating it hot instead of cold due to the consistancy and it went well with the pork roast I made from another recipe on this site.  Thanks so much for the recipe, Cinderella.  I'll just keep slogging on with my feeble attempts to cook whole grains.

Deeeeelish!!!! I used veggie broth instead of chicken broth to keep it totally vegetarian and I used fresh garlic instead of powder (didn't have any powder). The flavor is amazing, the quinoa is sufficiently chewy, but not too much. I will definitely make this again and again while mangoes are fresh in stock! I can also see how this recipe can be switched up to make a variety of sides and main courses. Well done!

Definately use low sodium chicken broth--way too salty. Next time I will add more crunchy things, almonds or some other kind of nuts. And BTW, do NOT use canned mango--way too soft and, um, I think DH said slimey. Interesting basic recipe, needs some tweaking.

Hey folks, try this recipe with Dried Cranberries (in lieu of the raisins) too, it is YUMMMY! I am so thankful to find this recipe. It is pretty much exactly the same as one at Marlenes Health food Deli that I LOVE LOVE LOVE. THey do not share the recipes, but will tell you the ingredients. I made it and it was the same wonderful, delicious, refreshing salad I enjoy without the premium price. THank you! *only reason I didnt give 5 stars is I reserve that for recipes that I coud eat until I explode. I love this, but c'mon, its not chocolate. :)

I really wanted to like this recipe - it had everything in it that I like. Unfortunately, the flavour combinations just didn't work for me.  The dish overall was very, very sweet, too much so for my taste.  I even tried adding red onion and celery as other suggested, but that didn't help.  I still have half the recipe remaining and will try a couple things to cut the sweetness, but as is, this is not the recipe for me.  Thanks anyway for sharing, Cinderella - I look forward to trying some of your other submissions!

This was good.  I used vegetable stock but would reduce the stock next time - as I did think it was too salty.  Next time I would also add more veggies!

Pretty good. I used vegetable stock to make it vegetarian. It could have used a little more curry.

VERY salty. Next time I would add more mango and cut the salt and I think it would come out well.

From the first time I made this it was a success eaten by even those not fond of curry in my household. The only thing I do that is not on the recipe is using frozen mango so I don't have to chop. I have made it many times and it is always a winner.

Did not change a darn thing.  It was a big hit with my gals poker group.  Light and refreshing.  Perfectly spiced and the mangos are a nice addition.

My first time making quinoa which I love. Although I modified it, it's an excellent recipe...but still a little on the salty side. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken, added celery, cilantro & dried cranberries! I had mango ready to put in it, but forgot and it was still very tasty! I couldn't even believe that I made it! Next time I will cut down on the salt by 50%.

I made this as my son needed soft food after oral surgery. I didn't have green onions, and I added a handful of raisins when it was done cooking.  I actually cooked in my pressure cooker (1 min on high pressure, then let it sit for 10 min before releasing the rest of the pressure) as learned from Hip pressure cooking website.  It is delicious as made and I could see adding other ingredients if desired.

Seemed like it was missing something, so I added 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 tablespoon honey.  Also added some cooked peas and unsweetened coconut flakes.  Next time I would reduce the amount of curry powder to 1 teaspoon.

Made this for dinner tonight -  Hubby said "this is a keeper, give it an eleven and half rating". 
I only made a few minor changes using vegetable stock in place of chicken stock (which I ran out of), adding dried cranberries, with the mango, and diced fresh basil, chives and garlic cloves.  
I served it with blackened chicken breasts, which the mango helped tame the seasonings down.  
All in all it is delicious and I will be making it again for sure.

Very good and simple.  I added red pepper flakes to the top of the cooked Quinoa before adding Mango and shallots.  Also added several stalks of celery.  So tasty - hot or cold..

I haven't cooked in years, so I tried this recipe because it looked uncomplicated and with not too many ingredients.  It was for a make-ahead lunch for my daughter, who said she loved it.  Yay!  She added a few vegetables she had handy, and had enough for five lunches.  Not part of the review, but I gotta say, I was sure happy to be back in the kitchen!  :-D

It wasn't exactly what I expected but it was good. I did use more curry powder than specified  (to taste) and I used frozen mango rather than fresh for it be a bit softer. I also added turkey sausage that I seasoned with the curry powder. It all went together very well and is good cold or warm.

Way too salty!  I added a few handfuls of raw chopped spinach at the end. I'll make this again but with 1/8 the salt, it will probably be good then.

I made this following the recipe exactly and it was a big hit! The mango I used was not too soft, so the pieces held their shape in the salad. Next time I'd reduce the chicken stock a little, as it was a little salty. I made it again one night when I didn't have any mango, so I used some mandarin orange sections and added a few sauteed mushrooms too - a nice variation. A great way to add quinoa to your repertoire!

I used spelt instead of Quinoa (My origonal plan was to use quinoa but when i opened my pantry I saw I did not have enough for this recipe, but had alread set my mind o making it....) I added mango, dried cranberries, scallions, diced celery, dried coconut and 3 tbsp. olive oil, 3 tbsp. of lime juice, salt & pepper and curry powder - WOW!

I recently read about the amazing nutritional value of quinoa (it's a complete protein by itself and has iron too - essential for vegetarians!) in a local paper. I've been a vegetarian for almost 25 years and couldn't beleive I'd never heard of this incredible grain. This was the first recipe I tried and it was a hit! I was a little nervous because I couldn't remember if my husband liked curry (you'd think I'd know after nearly 18 years!) and I know he's not crazy about mangos. He loved it! He says it's a great way for me to get him to eat mangos! I love that you can eat it cold so it's a great make ahead dish The only change I made the first time was to use vegetable broth instead of chicken. The second time I only used 1 tsp. curry because it was a little strong for me (though my husband liked it fine with 1 1/2). My 3 and 5 year-olds did not like it, which isn't surprising. They're in a "don't want to eat new things stage" right now. If you're wanting to try Quinoa and like curry you should defnitely make this recipe.

Wonderful dish. Perfect for a warm summer evening meal.
