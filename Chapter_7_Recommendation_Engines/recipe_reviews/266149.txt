This was super simple to make and quick delicious. I didnâ€™t have any sage so I added mint and hot peppers. Thank you for the recipe.

I have a lot of eggplant from my garden and was looking for ways to use it. I remembered a marinated eggplant from an Italian restaurant where I worked. This recipe is quite similar and so delicious! I made it with sage the first time but am not a huge fan of sage so second time around I used mint. It was wonderful! I've made it several times since and always play around with the seasonings. I took some as an appetizer for a dinner at my stepmom's house. She asked for the recipe!
