I leave in the spice bag until the wassail is finished, and I never add the milk.  I think it tastes much better that way!

This was such a hit last Christmas that I made it again this year. It's just delicious! The addition of milk is wonderful--gives this drink a body and fullness hard to duplicate. I do leave out the apples since I don't feel they added much and are a bit of a pain.
