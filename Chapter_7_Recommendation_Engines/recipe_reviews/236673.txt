HUGE disappointment!  I followed the instructions to the letter and yet it turned out so salty.

These shells turned out beautiful, and very yummy. Will be a great addition to my Easter menu this year

I made my own sauce and that's when this 3-star recipe went to 5 stars.

Barilla pastas never fail to please this cook. I boiled the shells for 6 minutes, rinsed with cold water to stop the cooking process. After baking  covered for 45 minutes, the shells were perfectly al dente. I scaled down the recipe for 2 servings, that could have easily fed 4 diners. I counted out 16 shells, equaling about 4.5 ounces, not 8 ounces as a half recipe would indicate. Kept the filling amount the same. This filled the 16 shells perfectly. Added 1/2 teaspoon crushed basil to the filling and another 1/2 teaspoon to the jarred sauce. Couldn't find Barilla's 3 cheese sauce, so subbed with another brand. This made for an over-the-top richness. Would enjoy this dish with a vodka sauce. Steamed fresh thin asparagus for 1 1/2 minutes. Perfect addition. Would I make this recipe again? Yes, with my recommendations!

Great recipe, if you are looking for something a little different!
I followed it as written, except that I chose to use fresh asparagus (While my water was heating to a boil for the pasta, I lightly steamed the asparagus over it!).  I was not able to find the Barilla Three-Cheese sauce, and substituted Barilla Tomato Basil sauce with some extra grated Parmesian-Romano cheese mixed in.
I served it with garlic bread and a salad.
This was simple to put together, but could be a WOW dish to serve guests!

We found this recipe to be quite salty.  The filling was a little bland otherwise, so I added some Italian seasoning and onion powder for flavor and an egg to help firm it up.   We're used to a smooth cheese filling in stuffed shells, so the asparagus and prosciutto seemed a little strange texturally, but they added great flavor.  I used the Barilla sauce, but I "doctored it up" with my own seasonings (I do this every time I use jarred sauce).  I have to rave about the pasta shells!  This is the first time I've used Barilla brand jumbo shells and the difference is amazing.  Other brands are starchy and they never seem to reach that perfect al dente texture, but instead get gummy and then go straight to mush.  Great pasta, Barilla!  I'll probably give this another try, omitting the salt completely, mincing the prosciutto more finely, and just serving the asparagus on the side.

Pretty good. I did find them to be quite salty. I only added half the salt, but next time would likely omit plus might reduce amount of prosciutto to cut back on saltiness. Made half with asparagus (fresh, steamed) and half without, but the asparagus flavor is quite understated.  My teen did not like this dish at all, but the adults each had several shells each. Couldn't find the stated sauce, so I used Barilla Roasted Garlic sauce.   I wondered if the three cheese sauce would have been too heavy/cheesy. Overall pretty good, if I do make again would likely make several changes.

This was good!  I followed the recipe as instructed. I over cooked my asparagus a bit, but you couldn't really notice once it was all together. I think I'm just not a huge fan of prosciutto. I think I might make it with sausage next time instead. I absolutely love this barilla sauce though!

Made as directed without substitutes, I had way too many shells go to waste. Boil half as much noodles and you will have plenty to work with. In the future, I will omit the asparagus as it threw us off texture and flavor-wise.  Also, I'd substitute prosciutto next time as it was hard to find fresh in the south. Good prosciutto is suppose to smell and taste similarly to bacon. It should never feel slimy to the touch and should slice easily.

Our family loves stuffed shells and so we were excited to try these!!  They were easy to make and they turned out well.  The only issues we had were the prosciutto was expensive to buy and made the shells a little too salty.

Made this for my husband and two kids last night.  My 9 year old daughter had 3 servings...she loved it!  My husband and I both thought it was a tad salty, so next time I will omit 1 tsp of salt.  Overall a delicious and very easy dish that looks fancy enough to serve to company!

I used bacon in place of the prosciutto and fresh asparagus in place of the frozen and those were the only changes made. I cooked my bacon first until it was nice and crispy, drained it on paper towels until cool, and then crumbled it into the ricotta mixture. It stayed nice and crisp during the baking step and was still crispy in the leftovers the next day. I stuffed my shells pretty full and there was enough for 18 shells. These turned out really good but there is SO much cheese in the filling that I think a marinara sauce would do this recipe more justice.

I made this recipe last night for my sisters bday dinner. I followed the recipe except I could not find the Barilla three cheese sauce so I used another brand & I didn't use the full 9oz of asparagus or the full amount of salt. Everyone ate & enjoyed there dinner but was not over the top about it. My daughter picked out all the asparagus & my husband & brother in law suggested a homemade sauce. I would make this again just without the veggies & with my own sauce .

Made this last night and it was delicious!!!! My husband and family could not say it enough.  Cooked the shells 5 minutes with the heat, then 2 minutes with the heat off.  While the water was hot I warmed up the asparagus, about 5 minutes.  I did use the frozen.  I followed the recipe, but added herbs that I like to the ricotta.  A little bit of dried basil and oregano.  I had left over cuttings of red onions, tomatoes and cilantro, chopped them up and added it to the ricotta.  Left out the salt and added pepper.  Used a whole jar of (14 oz) of three cheese sauce for the bottom of the pan and another jar for over the shells.  It was so good, there were only two shells left after dinner :(

I wanted to be inspired and came up with my own version since the jumbo shells were almost the only ingredients I had at that moment. I used a full frozen veggie bag and 3 different types of cheeses. I heated the veggies in a pan with some salt and pepper. For the cheese part, I used pepper jack, Pecorino Romano and medium cheddar cheese. The tomato sauce was homemade too; the tomato paste, basil, smoked salt and 1/3 c water boiled to be a thick sauce. I drizzled olive oil before I cover the dish with the foil. I used same amounts of ingredients though. It turned out so yummy.

My family followed the recipe exactly and it was far too salty for any of us.  With the cheese and prosciutto there is no need for any extra salt in here.  I would make this again but with a few tweaks.

I was pleasantly surprised by this entree. I wasn't sure I would even like it, but I enjoyed every bite of it. I did sauté the prosciutto to crisp it up, but otherwise no changes. Thanks Barilla!

Overall it was good, but I would omit the salt. The prosciutto makes the meal salty enough.

Kids weren't too crazy for it, but my husband and I LOVED it!!!!  I used fresh asparagus verses frozen.  And I used Barillas garlic bacon white sauce since I couldn't find the three cheese sauce.  Will definitely make again.

I would opt for fresh asparagus over frozen next time.  It made the dish watery.  The prosciutto became a bit rubbery.

I made this recipe and it turned out pretty well.  I made 12 oz of jumbo shells and this was way too much to fit into a 9 x 13 pan.  I think around 8 oz would have been perfect.  I also didn't have that much prosciutto so I added in some Jennie-O Turkey Store Italian ground turkey.  I thought that was a good addition and it balanced well with the cheeses and sauce.
