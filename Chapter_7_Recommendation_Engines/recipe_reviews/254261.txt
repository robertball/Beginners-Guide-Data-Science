It was good. I would have put less powder. It turned out very grainy when you get to the bottom. Overall I will make it again with a few changes to the recipe. Less cocoa powder and a little more chocolate. Whipped Cream is not needed because it is already very sweet. Thank you for inputting this recipe! -FreeOfGluten

This was ok. I see it as an enjoyable after school or hot summertime treat.  Kids would love it! It took on the flavor of the semi sweet chocolate chips I used, which was different from what I have made in the past. I only needed 1 cup of ice; otherwise, it would have been too weak tasting for me.
