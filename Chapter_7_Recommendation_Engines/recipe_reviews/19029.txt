I haven't made this person's recipe, but I have made Creme Brulee a number of times at a restaraunt.  Some observations;

1. Seems light on the eggs.  If I were making this would probably add 1 more yolk.  Three yolks might be fine.  Trial and error.

2. Cover pan with foil?  Seems unneccesary, though it might just be an aid to cut down on overall baking time which I expected to be closer to 35-40 minutes.  I usually leave them in the oven until the custard tops set and start to show signs of developing darker spots on top.  The spots become unnoticible (irrelevant) after you caramelize the sugar on top.

3. Unless you caramelize the sugar on top it's not really creme brulee'.  This step is done only when you are about to serve this dessert.  Doing it beforehand and putting it in the fridge is an unpleasant experience (sugar becomes liquified).  Use enough sugar (white or turbinado) on top or your ramekin to get a nice light covering (you should still be able to see the custard).  Light your torch and start melting the sugar on top in a circular motion.  You're not done until the sugar has gotten bubbly and brown.  Garnish & Serve!

Note:  With this recipe, you could substitute the vanilla extract for 1/2 a vanilla bean.  Add the split bean & scraped seeds to the heated milk, not the egg mixture.  Remove the bean shell before adding to egg mixture.

I tried this recipe because it was so different from the one I usually make. (From the book, Elegantly Easy Creme Brulee.) First of all, it lacks enough eggs to make it a rich creamy custard. There was hardly an egg flavor at all. And the stovetop step is not needed. The recipe I use takes the cold cream right from the icebox and mixes it with the sugar/egg mixture. I'll just stick to my tried and true recipe from the book. (2 cups cream, 1/3 cup sugar, 1 teas. vanilla, 8 egg yolks...and no pre-cooking before it goes into the oven.) Also, brown sugar is so hard to work with...I would only use white sugar for the topping. I'm sure you meant butane, not propane.

I followed the advice of the other makers and used 4 eggs yolks.  However, I double the recipe (using 8 egg yolks).  I used one Calphalon metal 13x9 tray and one Pyrex glass cassarole.  The ramekins in the baking dish turned out great.  The ramekins in the glass would not set, and it did not matter how long I let it bake.  For everyone having a problem with the recipe not setting, make sure to use a metal bakeware.  I am sure that was the problem because the ingredients were exactly the same.

This was awesome.  My boyfriend is a MAJOR cooking snob and he was SO down on me when I said I was going to make creme brulee.  He basically laughed in my face and said "impossible".  Whit this recipe, it IS possible.  I followed the reviews and made it with 4 eggs, and I also upped the cooking time to EXACTLY 45 minutes.  It couldn't have come out more perfect.  He was definitely eating his words and I got a huge apology.  This is going to be SO great to make at dinner parties and such, as it will SUPER impress.  

I gave it 4 stars ONLY because of the edits that it needed.  Stick the the 4 egg yolks and 45 minutes and you'll be SET!

This turned out just awful. I even tried making it a second time - same results. Wouldn't set. I even baked it 1 hr and 10 minutes, and it still wouldn't set.

On my first trial the custard didn't set all the way. The times were followed exactly.  The sugar topping was also inconsistent.  On the second try, I added another yolk (4 total) and decreased the sugar topping to ~ 1.5 tsp.  It came out perfectly; the custard set and the sugar melted quickly and predictably.  I also let the ramekins cool to room temp before putting in the fridge to avoid condensation.

I have been making this recipe for about 2 years, and LOVE it - I also use 4 egg yolks and a little more vanilla, and it turns out perfectly every time.  I have never had to strain the mixture as others have mentioned - the trick is to continually and vigorously whisk the egg mixture while SLOWLY incorporating the hot cream a tiny bit at a time; otherwise, the hot cream will cook the eggs and you will end up with lumps.  Also make sure to use a thin layer of sugar, or it will not caramelize properly - I personally find white sugar to work best.  This is my dessert recipe of choice to serve to dinner guests!  I think it is every bit as good as the creme brulee served in most restaurants!

Hey!  This is a tasty recipe.  I have been taking pastry classes and I discoved something.  Chef's recomend NOT to use brown sugar on top because of the moisture content and it affects overall appearance.

I love this recipe.  Very simple, and it usually turns out wonderfully.  Unfortunately, I made it for 6 people tonight and I forgot to increase the cooking time for the extra custard to set.  It looked runny when I took it out of the oven after 30 minutes, so I should have known.  I hoped it would set in the fridge but it didn't.  So if you increase serving size, remember to increase oven time!

Good recipe, however you forgot to mention that the baking pan should be covered loosely with foil before putting into the oven.  Otherwise, the custard tops will be brown and when it cools down, it becomes soggy. Not a pretty presentation.

Very good dessert. We made this when I met my girlfriend's parents for the first time. After all, you only get one chance to impress the parents! I think the recipe has been updated based on the reviews because the custard did set for me. Though I did have to increase the cook time by about 15 minutes for a total of about 45 minutes. I didn't have a torch so I used the broiler with only half of the sugar topping. The oven broiler worked well, but be aware that it will also heat up the custard. I may try the torch if I make it again.

Very good.  Used 4 egg yolks like other reviews and had to cook it in shallow custard ramekins for about 38 min but it came out wonderfully done.  Used a kitchen torch on top.

READ THE REVIEWS FIRST!! Oh my goodness... I made it according to recipe the first time and it would not set.  I went back and read all the reviews and put together the best mixture of ideas: Add one more egg (very important), Change the Oven Temperature to 325 degrees, and Change Time to 1 hour.  Then, let it cool to room temperature before cooling.  You can put it into the freezer for 45 mins to speed up the process or do the 4-6 hours in the fridge.  After I made these adjustments, I have to say that it did turn out perfect and delicious.  Hope this helps save someone else a headache!

I'm glad I read a good number of member comments before starting this and it turned out great!  Here's what I did (which repeats what many others have said):

- 4 egg yolks, not 3
- used whipping cream instead of heavy cream, the consistency of the custard (more below) came out pretty much like high end restaurants
- baked for 45min
- used a metal baking pan (I actually don't know if this really makes a difference, but apparently it did for one person who used both a metal and glass baking pan at the same time)

Like I said, the consistency came out great and after chilling, I actually thought it seemed too firm. BUT, once you caramelize the top and apply heat to it, it's perfect.

Don't put too much sugar on top (1 tblspoon is too much) and don't caramelize it for TOO long. It shouldn't be too hard that you can't break it and flake it easily with a spoon, but should still be crispy. Also, I think fruit on top helps a lot.

The best part is that it really impresses the ladies!

This was awful, worse than the ones you buy frozen in the grocery store.  I suggest using the recipe in the review by ILOVETOLUNCH, thats a fantastic recipe.  Also because her recipe has more yolks, you can cook it for about 35-40 minutes longer at 200 degrees and eat it warm but not runny.  Delicious.

Yuk!  This was an awful waste of perfectly good cream.  It turned out like a dish of fatty lard.  Not worth making, not worth eating.  This is nothing like the creme brulees I've had before.  It was more like the grease drained off of cheap hamburger.

Very good recipe; I followed the other reviewers and used 4 yolks.  Very smooth with good flavor.  I also used the wide flat ramekins, like I'd seen in restaurants, so the 25 minute cooking time was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

I fell for this recipe b/c it had a lot of reviews and 4.5 stars.  Little did i realize that people gave this recipe 5 stars but they were actually using a different recipe with more eggs.  If you follow THIS recipe the creme brulee will never set.

This is a great recipe, BUT, written here pretty poorly.  I recommend going slowly and adding common sense before following the recipe word for word...otherwise, you may end up with a flopped brulee.  It does taste great, and if you don't mind figuring out the recipe, definately try this!!!!

I made this recipe as directed, and after 30 minutes I removed the foil to find ramekins full of liquid.  It did eventually set and was tasty, but getting it there required removing the foil (using it is pointless) and an additional 45 mins in the oven.  Creme brulee can almost always be saved, but save yourself the aggravation and choose a different recipe.

I only made this once, added the extra yolk and cooked it for 45 minutes like the recipe said.  I also added fresh raspberries from our garden into the liquid just before pouring into ramekins.  They seemed set when I took them out of the oven, but weren't set when I went to eat one with my hubby for dessert.  I don't know if the raspberries extra water content did that, but if I could do it over I would serve the fruit on top instead.  My husband and I love creme brulee and have eaten it many times at nice restaurants around Portland...the flavor seemed a little off for us.

I had never attempted my own until I found this recipe; now I make it about every week. I add one extra egg yolk as other suggested, and I use 2 cups of lowfat half-and-half. I also prefer using demerara sugar for better flavor and texture. This is truly one of our favorite indulgences, and hubby loves getting to to play with fire when they are ready to scorch. Thanks so much!

*NOTE* Some reviewers said there's didn't set or it took too long in the oven. Mine did too the first time. The second time I put the pan with the wet towel in the oven while it preheated. This heats up the wet towel so when you put in the ramekins and add the boiling water it starts cooking immediately. It then will only take the 25 to 30 minutes instead of 1 to 1/2 hours. Huge difference! Oh, and you do need to add the extra egg! It's incredibly delicious!

WOW! This is an amazing creme brulee recipe that was easy to make and tasted as good or even better than a resturaunt. I also used 4 egg yolks in this recipe and it turned out just great. I used 1/2 of a vanilla bean and just a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla extract. The only problem I had was that the it took alot more time to bake than 25 to 30 minutes, but that was no big deal especially after tasting it. I mixed together 4 teaspoons of white sugar and 4 teaspoons of brown sugar for the brulee sugar and topped each one with 2 teaspoons of the sugar combo then broiled them. My parents 19th aniversery is tomorrow so I was planning on serving them this, but I made the creme brulee today since I have school tomorrow and it looked so good and nobody could wait so we ate them today!

EXCELLENT!  I have made this recipe dozens of times, and would recommend a few modifications.  Use 4 egg yolks so it will set up firmer.  Substitute a real vanilla bean for the extract.  It is not necessary to boil the water for the baking dish, and I never cover it with foil because I need to be able to see when it jiggles right.  Make sure to bake it long enough, and if you double the recipe then bake 35-40 min at 325 F.  And (important) use raw cane sugar instead of white sugar for the caramelized crust.

This turned out great, even with two different sizes of ramekins cooking at the same time.  I have had Creme Brulee with a hint of lavender at a local restaurant and it's a real treat. This recipe works well with that treatment.  (Take a loose tea infuser and add dried lavender buds. Add to the cream mixture as it is warming up.)  I can imagine that this would work with many things -- lemon peel, cinnamon, etc.)

Excellent recipe.  My changes were: I used a single souffle dish instead of four individual dishes.  It baked for 55 minutes before it was set.  (I turned it up from 300 to 325 for the final 10 minutes.)  I sprinkled half brown sugar and the other half white sugar and I'd say the brown sugar looked better and browned better under the broiler.  Also, before pouring the mixture into the souffle dish, I melted chocolate chips and spread them in the bottom and sides of the dish so the chocolate suprise added a special flavor and treat while eating the dessert.  I also used 4 egg yolks rather than 3.  Killer recipe with no chance of left-overs!

Baking time and temperature is not enough.  Custard is still liquid after 30 minutes at 300.  I recommend 325 for 50-60 minutes.

This was so simple ! I'm amazed.  I made this before I had read all the reviews- so I did not add the extra egg yolk.  It tuned out just fine.  It set great- although a little more on the pudding side rather than custard ( next time I will try the extra yolk)  I did use a torch rather than the broiler.  I will definatly be making this again.

Used one baking dish instead of four.  It would NOT set until it had been baking 1 hour and 10 minutes (and we're not a high altitude).  Just before we served it we tried to burn the sugar with a propane torch.  That also took much longer than expected (at least 5 mins), and it still wouldn't completely brown.  The heat from the torch effectively melted the custard, though.  The taste was okay, but definately not worth the effort or the fat.  I made the mistake of trying this recipe out on company.  Would suggest increasing the number of yolks to make it less soupy, decreasing the sugar on top to melt faster, and testing the recipe ahead of time.

Makes a superb dessert, I tried it the first time as you suggested and loved it.  I then added 1 tsp. Napoleon Brandy (with the eggs and vanilla) and enjoyed that a little more. I plan on attempting two tsp. brandy and also lining the bottom of the ramekin with raspberries.

I made this recipe as it was written (3 egg yolks).  The creme brulee took about 75 minutes to cook and it never really set properly-- the result was not as thick as it should have been--even after it had cooled.
The taste was good, but it definitely needed more eggs to make it firmer.
I wish I had read the reviews before trying this recipe.....

awesome.  just awesome.  tastes just like the kind you get at the 5-star steakhouse restaurant.  my only tip: it took a lot longer than 30 minutes for the custard to "set."  Not sure if it was the new oven/temperature calibration, or what.  I used the larger shallow ramekins so i was surprised at how long it took.

Also, invest in a torch.  The broiler can take too long and wind up leaving the custard a little soupy and warm.  Better to just "candy" the top and have the custard itself still be cold from the fridge.

Great recipe!!

Recipe needs a few adjustments. I agree with the folks who say add one more egg yolk. Also, the cooking time is WAY off. I'd say I ended up leaving them for about 50 minutes before they were set. All in all, though, it was delicious. UPDATE: I’ve made this recipe roughly a dozen times with very good results, though I stand by it needing a longer cooking time. I recently made it with the quantities verbatim, for my husband’s colleagues. It was so good, one man ate FOUR servings. I think all the hubbub about egg yolks is due to large eggs vs. not-large eggs. Probably 9 times it turned out fine with three yolks. After switching to organic eggs, though, I found out they are not consistently sized the way other eggs are. It would be nice to come up with a weight for the yolks to take away the guesswork, but I’ll probably go with 4-5 yolks in the future. Just one more update: I've now made this at least 20-30 times and, tail between my legs, I now say that the quantities, cooking time, and technique are PERFECT AS IS. One thing I've noted over time is that you have to let the cream get hot enough - just as the recipe states, let it heat up until small bubbles begin to form. When you stir it, a generous amount of steam should rise up. The one and only OPTIONAL modification I make is to use a 4-inch segment of vanilla bean, adding the scraped insides to the yolks and letting the husk steep with the cream. I still add a dash of vanilla from a bottle. Kudos to whomever originated this

This turned out fabulous! Per other recommendations, I added an extra egg yolk and increased the sugar to 1/3 cup. They took 45 minutes to cook, I put them in the freezer for about 35 minutes, and finally relocated them to the fridge for another couple hours before we ate them. Will definitely make this again! Oh and be sure to put a thin layer of sugar on top (I didn't use a full tbsp) because if it's too thick of a layer of sugar, it's a little harder to torch without it burning by the time it's all caramelized.

This was my first attempt at creme brulee (made for a pre-Valentine Day dinner) and it turned out AMAZING! I followed others tips and used 4 egg yolks and cooked it for a solid 45 min and it was perfect. I did up the sugar to a skimpy 1/3 cup just because we like it a little on the sweet side. I used a cooking torch and it was very yummy.

I halved this but used two full egg yolks.  After consulting other recipes I didn't line the pan with a towel, I left off the foil tent, and I baked them at 350*F.  It still took longer than the recommended time for them to set-- I left them in at least twice as long. I used my new kitchen torch to caramelize the sugar and it worked wonderfully.

Absolutely delicious!  I followed suggestions from other users: used one additional egg yolk, cooked for twice as long as recipe calls for and used 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 a vanilla bean, (for the topping 2 tsp white sugar, 2 tsp brown sugar, mixed together and put 2 tsp on each cup).  This recipe is a keeper! Thank you!

Thank you for this wonderful recipe... i couldnt believe that it would just take 10 min in preparing the brulee.... the baking time was definitely longer than mentioned in the recipe...! Since i was trying a brulee recipe for the first time so i just halved the quantity of the ingredients and it came out just perfect... Also i dint cover it with foil !! My picky husband was asking for more and wants me to make it for him more often now....

I followed some of the tips from other reviewers and upped the egg yolks considerably, and this was so delicious I could have cried. Creme brulee is my absolute favorite dessert, but I've never made it at home before because I didn't think I could do it justice. This was so creamy and rich and just amazing. It's my favorite thing I've ever done for myself!

So simple yet decadent and impressive! Loved this recipe, will make it again for sure. 
I did the original vanilla brulee, then I also made a lemon-ginger brulee by throwing in lemon peel and a peice of ginger when boiling the cream and an almond version where I simply substituted the vanilla for almond extract. Get creative!

Great Brulee Brian! I used five yolks and decided to turn this into a chocolate dessert. To the cream I added 2 ounces of unsweetened cocoa powder and 1 ounce of unsweetened dark bakers chocolate. Like the directions say, make sure you temper your eggs by adding the hot cream a little bit at a time so your eggs don't scramble. The family had a blast using the little torch to carmalize the sugar on top! Thanks!

This is sooo good, it's been my dessert obsession since I first made it almost three months ago.  Now I make it about two times a month.  It's so good and so easy.  Putting just a bit of jam, raspberry is good, at the bottom of the ramekins before putting the mixture in is very nice.  I also tried one with a little bit of orange juice and rind for an orange cream flavour, that was ok too...just watch how much rind you use.  Again, this is such a delicious dessert.

Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews before making this and therefore didn't include enough eggs.  I scaled the recipe to make 5 servings and used 4 eggs as called for.  Despite cooking for 1 hour, they did not set.  Disappointing....the recipe should really be changed to reflect the correct number of eggs.

I have always wanted to make Creme Brulee, and this recipe looked so easy, it seemed there must be something wrong with it. But there wasn't! It was excellent! I substituted Splenda for the sugar in the custard, but kept sugar for the topping. I also added an extra egg yoke as recommended by others. Turned out WONDERFUL! I broiled the topping, but next time I will torch it (once I buy one) to get a more even appearance. Yum!! Not sure how others screwed it up so much, since it was so easy!

This turned out perfect.  I increased the recipe by 50% and made 6 ramikins.  I increased the egg by one yolk and baked it for much longer.  I think it baked for about an hour and 15 minutes before it set up.  I set them on wire racks to cool.  Then, I covered them with plastic wrap and put them in the fridge overnight.  

The next day, I sprinkled only 1.5 teaspoons of sugar over the top and broiled it in the oven.  I then covered each ramikin with plastic wrap and put them back in the refrigerator to chill again.  They are wonderful and I've even had one a couple of days later.  It's still wonderful.  

I was scared to try this recipe because it looked like it could flop and so many people seemed to have had trouble with it.  But, it turned out absolutely wonderful and everyone now thinks I'm the Goddess of the kitchen!

This recipe did not work at all. I think it does need more eggs. I was so embarressed when I had no desert available for my guests. The little that it did set was ruined when I put it in the broiler to brown the sugar. Terrible!

This recipe worked out wonderfully for me. I did not make any changes - I simply used my broiler at the end and I loved it. If it was a lighter dessert I'd have it more often but I will definitely make it again!! Thanks.

Loved it, loved it, loved it!  I did add the extra egg yolk as per other reviewers, but other than that I followed the directions to the T.  Best creme brulee I have ever had.  I used the whites to make Authentic French Meringue cookies, also from this site, which happen to use the 4 whites.

Excellent . But as  another review suggested use the blender to mix all together saves a step or 2 and tastes perfect .Flavor 5 stars. Recipe process 3 stars.... Save a ton of work and use your blender

This was my first creme brûlée attempt. The recipe worked fine with an additional egg yolk. I also mixed the sugar, salt and vanilla into the egg yolks instead of the warmed cream. It set beautifully and I torched it with a kitchen torch. Tastes great and good consistency! Better than any restaurant version.

First review and I'm using it just to say, I did not care for this recipe.  I currently have had some watery concoction sitting in the oven for about an hour.  I should have read the reviews and added extra eggs to my doubled recipe but since this recipe had such a high rating I didn't think I needed to!  

So I'm reviewing this in hopes that someone else doesn't make the same mistake!

This was PERFECT, but I had to change it a bit. I cut the recipe in half and used 2 egg yolks (1.5 is not only silly, but not enough egg yolk!). I did everything else as directed... but I accidentally cooked it for an hour. I was going to for at least 40 minutes, but forgot about it. The consistencey is AMAZING. I will make this one for ever!!

I forgot to read the reviews which I regretted later. This brulee definitely needs more eggs. Mine did not set very well but it still tasted good!

This is an easy and wonderfully tasty recipe.  I used 4 egg yolks and increased the baking time.  I didn't realize it would take 4-6 hours to set so I let it cool enough to put it in the freezer and let it cool of in there for about 45 mins.  It was cooled and ready to put the sugar on.  I will definitely make this one again.

I'm a pastry chef and couldn't find my own recipe, so I just got on here and picked one out. There aren't enough egg yolks to make the thing set, it congealed and curdled before it got anywhere near being done.

I give this a rating based on making it as the recipe was written.  I baked these for over an hour hoping they would firm up more and it never happened.  This was a waste of time for me.  Adding more egg yolks might help next time, but then it would be a different recipe, right?  I'll keep searching for a creme brulee recipe that works.

This is the first time I have ever made creme brulee. I gave this a four because I, like others, altered the recipe. After reading the other reviews and recipes on other web sites, I used 1/2 cup sugar and 8 egg yolks. The recipe turned out divine. I was happy I attempted it!

This turned out great!  Yes, you have to add more eggs to get the right texture.  I used 8 egg yolks for 6 servings.  Skip the step with the foil and make sure they set for at least 5 or 6 hours.  Good stuff!

I was a little disappointed by the consistency.  It was runny so I looked at otehr recipes and the majority of the other recipes used a ration of 5 egg yolk to the 2 cups of cream.  It still tasted good, but was a very thin custard.

I tried this recipe twice. The first time it didn't set for me at all. We ended up drinking it with a straw. I tried it again with heavier cream (whipping cream instead of half and half), and baked for 45 minutes instead of the 37 minutes I baked it at the first time. I also added another egg yolk. We also did a test with both brown sugar and white sugar on top, and using the torch method, the brown sugar ended up burning and had to be scraped off. So I wouldn't try that again unless I used the oven broiler. With those modifications, I would rate the recipe with 5 stars.

Deee-licious!  But let me warn you, I followed others advice and used 4 egg yolks instead of 3.  Please do this.  It was the PERFECT consistency!  It was wonderful, it was heavenly ... and it was simple!  I would make it everyday if I didn't mind gaining weight :)  I served it to 7 people and everyone raved.

This is a great recipe. Very delicious!  Very easy to make.  However, it did take almost an hour to bake.  Other than that, this is a really good recipe.  I will definitely make it again.

I added one extra egg yolk and also salted the water bath to adjust for our high altitude (4200ft) and it worked out perfectly- wonderful recipe- as good as any I've had!

Makes a nice "light" crème brulee.  Required an extra 10 minutes to cook.

I've only tried to make creme brulee at home once (pumpkin creme brulee).  It wasn't a disaster, but it wasn't super good...
This one, WOW!  I made it last night and let it chill over night.  The custard is nice and stiff, but still perfectly creamy.  I baked mine at 300 degrees for 35 minutes.  The tops stayed uncracked and the taste and texture are spot on. (Unlike the pumpkin which took longer to cook and was still a little loose)  I also like that you don't need a ton of egg yolks to get that texture.  3 works just fine and you don't get that "eggy" taste you do with some other bain marie custards that call for more yolks. (I try to tell my self this makes this recipe a little "light" LOL!)
I did heat my cream with a vanilla bean thrown in, just because I love vanilla.  I didn't scrape the seeds, but did also add the extract.  I don't know if this made it more vanilla-y, but I'd like to think it did.
This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Thanks for posting it!

Simple and Fantastic! Followed recipe as stated. Cooking technique: used large roasting pan with the kitchen towel in the bottom of it (and boiled water). To prevent (or help) condensation forming on the Crème Brulee's in the refrigerator, I placed stretch wrap directly over/on the top of each. Have made three times thus far.

I made it twice.  Ruined it second time because I watched timer vs checking that custard was set before I took it out of oven.  Chilled it and it was runny.   Like to add candied ginger for extra flavor.

This recipe was my first successful attempt at creme brulee. I had to bake it about 15 minutes longer for the custard to set up, and I had a few trials and errors with the kitchen torch. Overall, very nice and easier than I thought it would be.

If your creme brulee did not set, you could have gotten water in the creme brulee. There can absolutely not be any water drops AT ALL in the ramekins before you add the mixure or after you add the mixture. Take care when moving it in and out of the oven so this does not happen.

I am bewildered at the positive responses for this recipe. I was attracted to this creme brule version because it uses few eggs / serving that others I have tried, but I had the same problems that many others had unless I increased the # of eggs and cooking time. What good is a recipe as simple as this one that isn't bulletproof? Creme brule isn't complicated to make, and this low egg / short cooking time version has frustrated countless reviewers ... if you like creme brule, fine. But don't rate this recipe highly if it is unreliable!

This was wonderful. My husband and I are Creme Brulee snobs. I was worried when I made this because the last recipie I used called for egg whites so the yolks surprised me. The recipe I made from the whites tasted like egg this recipe tasted like burnt cream...PERFECT! I did use an extra egg yolk (4 total) and I used a slight 1/4 cup of sugar. It was perfect.

I used 4 egg yolks and cooked for 45 minutes.  They came out amazing!  It was my first try at creme brulee and my husband was impressed with the results.  I put a bit less sugar on top just for personal preference

This crème brulée is delicious! I made it for mother's day, and again for a family meal. Everyone loved it! HOWEVER, I followed previous reviewers' suggestions and added an extra egg. It worked perfectly. And as a side note, using a light to crust the sugar doesn't work, unfortunately.

OMG this is like more than amazing!!! My husband and 4 year old LOVE this! I added 1 more egg york as suggested and turned out great! Make sure you pour the hot cream very very slowly over te egg yorks & stirring all time or else you'll get scrambled eggs not creme brulee. Try it! You'll make this for your guests with no regrets :)

This was just ok. The recipe can be better. The custard flavor was lacking, I'm just not sure what, but could definitely use more flavor. I will definitely be experimenting with this recipe to reflect my tastes.

The first time I made this (with ingredient changes of whipping cream rather than heavy cream and 4 egg yokes rather than 3) I used a single serving pan (actually used a 9X9 metal pan for the Brulee and a large metal pan for the water bath)and baked it for 45 minutes it came out PERFECT! I just repeated the same but put the Brulee into 6 ramkins which just filled all of them. After baking, however, I have lost 1/2 of all the Brulee. Possibly, the 45 mins was too long?

THIS IS SO DELICIOUS!!! My husband took me out to eat and this was the first time I had cream brulee.  I came home looked for the recipe and now I'm making my own.  When buying a piece for almost $10 I can make 4 remikins at home for less than $5.  The only thing is that I need to get a kitchen torch cause the broiler will not brown sugar.  Looking into invest in a kitchen torch to make some for parties.  Great recipe.

Super! my boyfriend thought i was getting "all fancy" when i busted this one out but he really liked it and so did i.  careful not to load up the top with to much sugar.  the crust will be to thick and hard to break with a spoon. =)

Great taste.  I used very shallow creme brulee dishes that came with my butane torch, and they needed a lot more time cooling in the fridge to attain the thickness desired with Creme Brulee. I made half of this recipe and it was more than enough for 3 people.

Not good.  It was way too runny and had little flavor.  The only saving grace was I wanted to make it seasonal so I added peppermint schnapps which gave it some great flavor.  It also took forever to cook.

This was absolutely delicious!  Because I raise my own chickens and get a dozen eggs a day, I went ahead and increased the egg yolks to 4.  Everything else was followed exactly.  We used a torch to brown the sugar on top, and the crème remained cold underneath it.  The crème was delicate and oh, so good.  I recommend this recipe!

This was very GOOD.  I didn't give it 5 because like everyone else I altered the recipe.  I added 5 egg yolks and a little ameretto.  I came out very creamy and tasty.  Good starter recipe to add on.  I use a butane torch to create the yummy, crunchy crust.  We top it with fresh berries (raspberries, black berries etc..) with a little licquor of your choice added.  YUMMY!!

This recipes came out perfect. Sfter reading the other suggestions, I made some changes. I used only 1 and 2/3 cups of whipping cream and I used 4 egg yolks. I also cooked it for 45 minutes. In my opinion 1 tbsp of sugar on top was too much. The custard turned out perfect though

I tried this recipe twice.  First exactly as the recipe states and second as suggested by another reviewer (with an extra egg yolk and whipping cream instead of heavy cream).  The first test was watery and took over an hour to set properly in the oven.  It never had a that custard-like texture that I love.
The second test was better, but still not satisfactory.  This one took just under an hour to set up and still had a grease-like liquid surface that had to be poured off (even after allowing to cool in the fridge for 6 hours) before it was palatable.

Just what I hoped for.
I did follow the tip and used 3 egg yolks for 2 servings - made in heart shape ramkeins with heart shaped Scottish Shortbread I for valentines.

I have had good luck with this recipe.  You can increase the egg yolk.  It is important that you follow the directions about heating the cream...I think that this might be where some are coming out soupy.  This is simple and produces an impressive dessert.

this recipe is fabulous!  I used four egg yolks instead of three, as the other reviewers suggested & the consistency was perfect.  It wasn't lumpy at all, when I combined the yolks with the cream.  I just put the yolks into my Kitchenaid mixer & turned it on low while I added the cream.  I also used brown sugar instead of white to top it, though either would work.    The taste was excellent!

I used the 4 egg yolks, baked about 5 minutes longer than suggested and strained the mixture (with a fine mesh hand held sieve) before pouring into the ramekins. I am glad I strained it because there were some lumps that would have been less than appetizing. It turned out absolutely wonderful with these recommended steps. A five star taste, but I gave the recipe 4 stars because of the necessary modifications.

I added the extra egg yolk and baked it for an additional 20 minutes (45 total).  I baked two recipes, one with the damp kitchen cloth (which I found odd) and one without.  I did the water bath to both.  Both turned out with the same consistency. I also topped and broiled one with white sugar and one with brown sugar.  The brown sugar turned out better. We all loved the flavor!  Would do it again.  4 stars because of the adaptations.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I added an extra egg yolk as suggested by other reviews, and I also baked my custard in one 9 inch pie dish (due to the lack of ramequins in my collegiate apartment). Because I did not intend to serve this all at once (however tempting), I had to improvise with the crust. We buttered and sugared a piece of aluminum foil (you could even sugar it in a shape for aesthetics), placed it on a cookie sheet, and broiled it for a minute. We spooned the custard into bowls and added the carmelized sugar on top. Not as pretty perhaps, but it worked and was very tasty.

This was my first time making creme brule and it was wonderful! I did take the advise of some of the other reviews and added  an extra egg yoke, more vannila, and I cooked it a little longer. All in all it turned out great and was really easy. I can't wait to make it again.

I'm a lousy baker but I had no problem using this recipe and it turned out perfect. I followed the directions exactly, even used the broiler to brown the sugar and it was a great hit. Not sure why others wouldn't have great success with this. If I can do it, anyone can!

This is the first Creme Brulee I ever made and it turned out fantastic! I used 4 yolks and real vanilla bean and baked it for 30 minutes.  Even the sugar crust turned out perfect usuing a broiler. I put it in the freezer after that for maybe 5 minutes to get it chilled again.

I added an extra yolk, and  left this in the oven for almost twice as long, and it does not set up.

The taste is good, but there it simply does not set like it should.

i made this today and it was wonderful!  i couldn't even wait till it cooled to begin eating it.  the only problem now, is that i'll probably get really really fat.  i think i'll take everyone's suggestions next time, though, and add an extra yolk or two.

This is wonderful! I did have to almost double the baking time, but I used one larger container instead of the 4 smaller ones. A 12 year old neighbor made this for New Year's Eve last year and it didn't set up properly (she used one medium casserole dish instead of ramikins and probably didn't adjust the baking time) so she put it in the freezer.  It was the absolute BEST vanilla 'ice cream' I've ever had!  I made this along with 'Apple Spice Dump Cake' also found on this site and it was pure heaven!

I used 3 10 oz ramekins since I didn't have any 8 oz.  Plus my water boiled over so it took almost twice as long to bake, but it was worth it.  Such a wonderful taste!

I have made this recipe numerous time for christmas and the kids like.  we eat creme brulee every chance we can when we find on a menu at a restaurant and my wife and kids always comment the this recipe is ALWAYS better than any at restaurant.  Period.

I will continue to use this recipe because it is perfection,  and yeah, covering the bowls while baking makes a huge difference. It preserves taste and moisture.  I skipped the foil once.  Never again.  Absolutely love this recipe!

Never made creme brulee before.  Now I am amazed at how easy and pretty fool-proof it is.  The only time required is in the fridge setting up.  I will save this recipe for times when folks a dumb as I was come for dinner to falsely impress them!

Three egg yolks seemed insufficient to me so I added an extra yolk.  The brulee came out smooth and creamy, just what you'd expect for a delicious brulee.

Made this for the first time and took the advice of other reviewers. I used 3 eggs and put in the oven with no foil for exactly 45 minutes. Came out perfect!!  Soo easy and such a crowd pleaser.  Putting this down on my tried and true list of desserts.  I doubled the recipe and it was perfect. Thank you!

Very smooth and velvet texture.  I used extra fine sugar for topping and torching.  Seems like it’s easier and more even when broiling or using torch.

The actual custard is amazing however i suggest using less sugar on the crust, it becomes to thick and difficult to eat, almost impossible to enjoy.

I did go with the 4 egg yolks and 1/3 c. sugar based on reviews and it turned out fabulously. Baking time was about 50 minutes. My only problem was that all the vanilla bean specks sunk to the bottom of the ramekins and were not distributed throughout the custard like I thought they would be. Any thoughts/suggestions?

I didn't have to change a thing except for adding a few extra minutes in the oven. I read the reviews about adding the 4th egg yolk after I tried this recipe and I started to worry... I did notice that the mixture was really foamy when I poured them into my ramekins and that overall it was really pale yellow. However, IMO this creme brulee is just right! Not overly sweet, and light & creamy. I didn't have any problems with it setting; it's definitely not thick like pudding but it's not watery either. I waited until they cooled to about room temperature, covered with foil and placed in the fridge. This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

Very delicious.  The first time, I followed directions exactly.  The second time rather than using vanilla extract, I chose to use 1/2 tsp.  vanilla bean.  OMG!  What a difference.  It tasted just like a creme brulee that I enjoy at our favorite restaurant.  Try the vanilla bean.  You won't be disappointed!

Yummy! This was the best creme brulee.  It was very easy to make and tasted great.  It came out perfectly.  I didn't use the towel in the pan, I just put the ramikins in w/ hot water.  I did increase the cooking time to 40 min.  Will make again soon.

I also used 4 egg yolks and didn't cover the pan with a foil. I baked it for about 30 minutes and it came out delicious. My family and friends loved it. This is one of the easiest desserts to make.

This elegant dessert is a breeze to make. No one would guess it would take less than 10 minutes to prepare! I use 4 egg yolks like others here and bake it for 45 minutes. I also use less sugar on the top because personally I don't like a thick layer of caramelized sugar. Plus, I find it's harder to torch and keep it from burning if there's a thicker layer. This is my go-to recipe when I'm looking to impress guests.

After reading the other reviews I know why mine didn't set properly. Not enough egg yolks.  The flavour was good and so we used it as a custard with berries.  I'll give it another try with more yolks.

This is a great recipe but because I don't like the heavy egg tasted, this is perfect.  Just like any reciepe you have to decide you want more or less of anything you put in it.  On this one don't use as much sugar, that way the creme will set and wont look like liquid after 45mins of baking.

This recipe is AWESOME!!!!!  I used 4 egg yokes and baked for 40 minutes.  Turned out PERFECT!!!! I used a metal cake pan and no towel.  I removed the cream/sugar from the heat and added the egg mixture to the pan I was using on the stove.  Use a wire whisk.

I used a few of the suggestions and it was amazing!  I increased my yolks to 5  and used half of a vanilla bean. I didn't use foil to cover while baking either. It did take a bit longer baking time to set. The creamy texture was perfect. My family & guests raved about it.  It is now a permenant family recipe.

Well......I should of read reviews before making. I thought this was the recipe I used twice before and they turned out perfect. This time it never set up. I let cook for a lot longer time, and it never set up properly. The flavor was good, just to runny.  I should of used more egg yoks per the other reviews. I don't think I will make this again. I will search for the other one I made before.

This recipe is excellent. Everybody loves it. But I suggest you leave the creme brulee in the oven for a little over 35 minutes and check it once in awhile for a jiggle. 4 yolks, just like everybody said, is better.

I loved this recipe.  I did add an extra yolk based on reading the other reviews.  It turned out wonderfully.

This was an excellent Creme Brulee. Almost like resturant's. I added an extra egg, to keep it firm. I'll be using this one for all my special occaions! Great Job!

I had never made creme brulee before using this recipe, tho I've eaten many times in restaurants and at a friend's who makes it often using a recipe from a French friend's grandmother. Everyone raved even the friends who have eaten the Frenchman's recipe for it. So I have only good things to say about this recipe. I followed it exactly. I'm making it again next week for a Christmas dinner party. Sure hope I'm as lucky with this batch...

I lost my regular creme brulee recipe, so decided to try another one.  I used 4 egg yolks (instead of 3) after reading other people's suggestions. It tasted very "eggy" and didn't have a smooth, creamy consistency.  Not sure if making the recipe as written would have improved the flavor/consistency, but won't make again.  Sorry!

I have never tried to make nor have eaten Creme Brulee before. I tried this recipe as is for 4 servings. I baked for the 30 min without the foil cover and it set up well. Once I put the ramekins in the fridge to finish setting a layer of grease solified on top. I scraped that off and I enjoyed it better. I tried carmelizing the sugar with a torch and ended up with a butane aftertaste. I will broil from now on. I enjoyed the flavoring suggestions and how to go about having a variety of flavors to choose from in the future.

The previous reviews helped a lot and I did add an extra egg yolk and more vanilla to the recipe. Turned out awesome. I think I'll add 5 eggs instead of 3/4 next time to get a thicker consistency. Other than that, the recipe is really good.

this always comes out good for me. but if you do not have a kitchen torch it is best to let the creme brulee settle first before placing it back into the oven with the brown sugar on top so that it can caramelize. thank you for this recipe.

I adjusted the recipe to serve 2 and added an extra yolk - next time I think i will add another to make the custard even firmer.  the flavor was very good - over all i really enjoyed it and it was VERY easy to make.

Tried the alterations that were mentioned in reviews.  I added an extra egg and cooked it for longer.  Still was a bit too watery for creme brulee.

These creme brulee are beautiful, I used 4 egg yolks instead of 3 and used 1/2 a vanilla bean in the cream whilst it was heating on the stove. I ended up cooking it for 45 minutes as it wasnt set properly. Still not as good as restuarant quality but pretty close.

This was so easy to make. I added the extra yolk as others recommended and upped the cook time. I prefer very sweet creme brulee so, I added extra sugar and vanilla. I also added 1/4 cup white chocolate chips to the heavy cream. I do not make this in ramekins either rather, I cook it in a flan dish. Tastes just like the creme brulee I pay $10.00 for at our local steak house.

This was pretty easy to make, and it was really delicious.  I did coat the dishes with melted chocolate and that was an excellent additional treat.  I used 4 eggs yolks rather than 3 and probably cooked about 45 minutes rather than just 30 minutes.  It was really yummy!

This was a terrific, and surprisingly easy recipe for a first-timer.  I skipped the towel in the bottom of the pan, and the water turned my cake pan an unfortunate tin color.  That aside, the custard turned out fabulous, and instead of melting sugar on top of the brulees, I opted to make a caramel sauce stolen from another recipe on this site, which I drizzled over the top.  Fantastic!

I followed the suggestions to add the extra yolk and increase the baking time and it came out great!  Definitely better than paying $10 for it at a restaurant.  I like a stronger vanilla flavor so I think I'll add a bit more next time and play around with other flavors.

Very nice.  I added the extra yolk, as others suggested, and made twice the amount to serve 10.  I cheated with the topping (being short of time), making toffee in a saucepan and then drizzling over the top of the brulee (room temperature) before serving.  It did go crisp and was certainly pretty, but probably wasn't as nice as the kitchen torch method.  I also topped it with a dollop of double cream, blueberries and strawberries on the side.  I'll definitely make it again.  Thanks for a nice recipe.

Like another reviewer, I had used 8 yolks and 1/3 cup sugar in previous trial.  The 8 yolks add the egg taste to the custard.  I have tried pre cooking and not.  The Pre cooking tends to reduce amount of foaming of mixture and reduces need to strain the mixture before pouring into ramekins.

It came out great.  The only reason I didn't rate it "5" is because I had to make modifictions several others suggested.  I added an additional egg yolk and used real vanilla bean instead.  I also baked it longer.  Easy!

This recipe is very simple but it does need 4 egg yokes to get it to set up.  I've made it twice now.  The first time with 4 yokes and it set up fine.  The second time I only used 3 and it was soupy.  Both times I baked it for 45 minutes.  I will make again but will always use 4 yokes.  Otherwise it's a five star.

This recipe is perfect if you are on a low carb diet.  All you have to do is substitute the sugar for splenda and it tastes great.  It is so simple and easy I make it at least twice a week. But make sure to use real sugar on the top because splenda just blows away and burns.  This recipe is wonderful the best I have found, I would encourage anyone to try it.

this was really great. my only problem was that accidently poured some boiling water into one of the ramikins while pouring the boiling water in the baking pan. Oh well, i'll try harder next time (there will be a next time!). Otherwise, awesome!!
