The dough was far too sticky for me to work with. In order to flatten it with my fingers I had to use quite a bit of flour on the countertop to get it to where I could work with it. I would use this again but I would cut back the water a bit.

This Navajo fry bread is the best...serve with refried beans and grated cheese or red chile.  Serve as a dessert with honey or powdered sugar.  Good feedback S J

This was pretty good. I was looking for a quick bread to go with our soup, besides my usual go-to sourdough biscuits, and this did the trick. I almost rated this at 3 stars, however, because of the lack of important details in the directions. 

The directions don't tell you to flatten the dough at all, which is quite essential information! I could tell from the type of recipe and the photo that the dough needed to be flattened before cooking so I did, but someone who is a cooking novice might not know that and just do what the directions say: To form dough into a ball with your hands and then move on to frying. If left in ball form I think it would be VERY difficult to fully cook the bread in the middle without burning the outside, since I had a hard enough time with that even with flattened dough. And since the recipe didn't say to flatten the dough at all, I had to guess at how thick to make the pieces and didn't guess overly well. I flattened to about 1/4-3/8" or so each but the dough rose while cooking to about twice that so, as I mentioned, I had a hard time getting the bread cooked in the middle without burning the outside. I would start with thinner dough next time to get a more golden exterior with a non-doughy middle.

All that said, these were pretty tasty and quick to make, so I will probably try it again with those changes. I think they would also make a yummy, doughnut-like dessert treat rolled in powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar after frying.

Sorry to be a stickler, but it's spelled Navajo. Please correct this in your title. 

Other then that, very good recipe.

I double the recipe, and don't mix all of the water in at once.  Make a pocket in the center and mix as you go.  The more stuff that comes off your hands and goes back into the bowl will make the next pieces a little more tough.  Shape them about the size of a "honey bun".  I drain them on paper until cooled, then I place them into a plastic bag to soften up.  I also make "snow ball" by cooking round balls and dropping them into powder sugar after they cool.  Rotate and repeat the balls about three times.  Make them bigger than a walnut, and watch the fun.

great simple fry bread, not like fry bread is complicated.

I used 1/4 cup of water and add 1-2 tsp. of sugar to the mix.

the recipe was a bit bland....I used milk only to hold the dough together and added a few sashes of garlic salt and parmesan which topped it nicely for me! plus it gave me a great opportunity to research the history behind the bread! such a sad but wonderful story of how it came about! I would recommend this to anyone!

I made this bread as written. It's very quick, easy andwonderful. I plan to double recipe & hope the bread will reheat well. Much less time consuming than making naan. Thank you for sharing this recipe.
