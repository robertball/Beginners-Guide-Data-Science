This was our first time trying Endive.  I liked these but they were a little salty, I am not sure if it was the prosciutto or the cheese or both.  Next time I might try bacon and a different cheese and see how that turns out.

To those of you who are British this is called Chicory. Just a tip for those of you who are going to make this dish, chicory can be bitter. To take a bit of the bitterness away, remove part of the core. Normal ham can also be used, and grated cheese of any kind, we use Gouda. Grilling is nice but you can also caramelize in an oven dish, and bake.
