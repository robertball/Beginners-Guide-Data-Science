I hate to be the first reviewer and give this such a poor rating, but this particular recipe was just not a good match for me or my family.  We did not care for the sweetend condensed milk in this, as it gave it a very sweet flavor that was overpowering for us.  For those that like a sweeter mac n cheese, this would be a good recipe to try.  Thanks for sharing, garlic_in_a_windmill!

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe. The dish does have a sweet taste but that is what makes it unique from all other mac & cheese recipes. The only thing I would do differently is use a little less butter.  My husband wants me try it again but next time using a four cheese blend with some pepper jack.  We are definitely adding this to our family recipe book.

Was amazing without the condensed milk though. This was my first homemade Mac and cheese recipe and I didn't have the condensed milk and it came out amazing!

I didn't have evaporated milk only sweetened. I searched the web to see if there was a recipe that used sweetened with good result. This one was iffy, so I used HALF of the sweetened condensed milk and added regular milk and doubled the amount of macaroni. At dinner, people STILL said it was too sweet. NO ONE liked it. Looked at the can. 220 grams of sugar. OVER ONE CUP. So I put a little over a half a cup in my mac and cheese.
The good reviews where people made half the macaroni and twice the sugar...I think they threw it out to and didn't want to admit it was too sweet. 
Dinner ruined. Threw out what wasn't eaten.Please do us all a favor and remove this recipe. Oh, and people, do us a favor...if you leave out an ingredient and it comes out good make your own recipe, don't give 5 stars to the one that had all the sugar.

I love this mac n cheese recipe and this is gonna be my go-to recipe from now on! I read some of the other reviews stating that this mac n cheese is too sweet, and it does have a hint of sweetness, but i didn't find it overpowering in any way. Besides, that's what makes this recipe standout. It is wonderful.

Way to sweet. Didn't taste anything like mac n cheese. I only used about 1lb of cheese which was plenty. I won't be making this again.

Skip the condensed milk, it doesn't need it. I used sharp  shredded cheese and it turned out good. Next time, I'm going to be a little heavier handed with the cheese on each of the layers. That being said, this recipe is an absolute winner.

This is nothing but traditional soul food mac and cheese.  Where this recipe is different
- you must swap out the sweetened condensed milk and use evaporated milk (sweetened milk has no place in mac n cheese (of course just my opinion)
-No bread crumbs
-Lots of cheese and don't be afraid to use other types of cheese
-you can add a little pepper and garlic powder.

This is now a family favorite with just one adjustment. Instead of the sweetened condensed milk I substituted 1 Pint, 16 oz., of whipping cream. The top came out beautifully browned and appealing. So much so I didn’t have time to take a picture before it was being eaten. Next time!!

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for! My husband's late Grandmother made her macaroni and cheese similar, minus the topping. I cut the sweetened condensed milk in half and used regular milk with instead of  evaporated. I also just used seasoning salt and leave out the extra paparika. This is a great southern recipe with a slight sweet taste. Thank you!

I make a similar Mac and cheese.. No evaporated milk thou.. I layer mine ( like yours ) but in between each layer I do .. A lil flour mixed with with salt and pepper and a little powdered garlic .. Dot with butter ( not margarine) sprinkle then shredded mix of cheese ( example Colby jack .. Mild white cheddar.. Swiss..) don't just use sharp cheddar! Then pour 1 1/3 cup of milk over the dish.. Bake the same as your time above!

I wish I read the reviews first about how sweet it is. I really didn't like it but my husband thought it was ok. I put ground beef in it which helped. I'll try it again without the condensed milk. Probably will try cream instead.

I'm only going to give this recipe two stars. My eggs separated, and the cooking time over-browned my top. That said, the pan was cleaned out when I picked it up at the end of the potluck, so the overall flavor was good. Instead of this version, I am going to use the "Southern Macaroni and Cheese Pie" which has good instructions on how to temper the sauce. (I did not use the sweetened condensed milk).

I used one pound of sharp cheddar and 8 oz of blue cheese. It was very rich tasting and a hit for my family.  Very easy to make.

This was an awesome twist on an old classic. I added a dash of  nutmeg and some red pepper flakes to the milk sauce which complemented the sweetness. I also used a larger macaroni pasta.
