Made this for Faceless Frenzy July 2012.  This has great flavor but made with 8 eggs and no milk or cream makes it is rather dense.  I would use 4 or 5 eggs and about a cup of half and half or cream.  This is perfect for a summer brunch.

I loved this recipe! I made this yesterday and last week for my family, as I just had an urge to make a quiche (the first time was a trial round). Because I couldn't get hold of any basil or mozzarella, I instead used oregano (apparently a good basil substitute!) and parmesan. I took one of the reviews into consideration, and added lite cream to the 8 eggs for a fluffier, lighter texture. I made my own pastry and also added diced button mushrooms the second time - it turned out perfectly! The caramelized onions with the added herbs and tomatoes created such a great, heartwarming flavour, and the addition of mushrooms added just a little bit more texture to the filling. I will definitely make this again! 5 stars!

A very tasty quiche- the caramelized onions are so good in this!  I only had 6 eggs, so I added in 1/2 cup of milk.

Excellent! I added bacon and mushrooms. I fried the onions in the bacon pan. I used lots of dried basil. I doubled the recipe and froze extras for kids lunches (in small tarts) and quick meals. I used 13 eggs and some milk and cream. This made three tender flake pies and twelve mini tarts. I also used a combo of cheeses, some homemade. Probably the best quiche I have ever made. I also used strained canned tomatoes as I had no fresh tomatoes.

This was fantastic!  I wouldn't change a thing and I couldn't stop eating it!  I used about 3/4 of a 2 cup bag of shredded mozzarella and 5 big leaves of basil.  I think the only thing I may do next time (if I have more time) is make homemade pastry because it is so much better than store-bought!

This is a delicious easy quiche to make. I served it for a dinner dish along with cabbage salad and steamed artichokes.   It was really liked by dinner guest.  I'll be making it again, as it has become one of my favorites.

Like another user, I reduced the amount of eggs and added half and half. 6 eggs and about 1/2 cup half and half. Made it lighter. Great quiche. And a great way to use a bunch of eggs and CSA veggies.

Every time I make this quiche everyone wants the recipe. I find it takes a little longer than 40 minutes to cook and at least 10 minutes to set up so I allow a bit more time than the recipe calls for. I've also varied the cheeses - last time I used about 9 oz mozzarella and 3 oz gruyere which was delicious. And if you have the option of using tomatoes fresh from the garden, that's the best!

I thought I had a pie crust when I began making this; went to the deep freeze and found only mini crusts. I didn't use all the egg mixture and cheese. Also, I had to substitute a few things (spinach for basil leaves and a little basil leaves seasoning) and added some olives. If you like cheesy, doughy food like we do, these mini quiches are little pieces of heaven:)

Flavor is good, but if you are really using fresh mozarella, I think you need to get some of the water out of it and or the tomatoes first. Took twice as long as it said to cook and still had some liquid in pan.

This quiche is WONDERFUL. I always make more classic quiches (broccoli & cheddar, ham & swiss), but had all the caprese ingredients on hand, so decided to give it a try. We all loved it! I will definitely make this again. (Note: I am really just reviewing the flavours added, since I used my own quiche base (half & half, eggs, milk).

Love this recipe! I made this today for lunch with friends. It turned out beautifully and was very filling. The only thing we all agreed on, is to add some pancetta next time. Bacon makes everything better!

I used 6 eggs instead of 8, as it would have overflowed the deep dish pie pan.

I made this exactly as written, it was delicious! Next time I plan to a add chopped red pepper and sautéed mushrooms. I will also use a teaspoon of dried basil. I made 2 quiches using 12 eggs, baked them for 1 hour. They came out great, we have them for breakfast, there is very little left over.

Very good!  My friends all had 2nds so I had minimal left overs.  I took the suggestion of 6 eggs and 1/2 cup of half & half.  It took longer to cook, like 50 minutes, but was yummy.  Next time I want to add some pepper flakes and maybe little garlic.  Cant wait to make again!

This was delicious.  I did find that 8 eggs was actually too many so will reduce to six the next time I make this (and I will make this again).  I would also reduce the mozzarella from 12 ounces to closer to 8 (I used a 7 or 8 oz package of sliced mozzarella.  Covered the bottom of the pie crust and broke the remaining 2-3 slices up and dropped on final mixture).

This is a wonderful alternative to the "traditional" quiche.  The fresh herbs and tomatoes give it a "straight from the garden" flavor.  It is delicious for lunch or dinner served with a salad.

I liked it very much.  When I make it again I do believe I shall add a little cream, changing  the texture just a bit.  It had wonderful flavor, however, and was well received at Sunday brunch.

I use only fresh ingredients  and grate cheese. As with all recipes using onion, I thinly slice and pre cook them to carmelize for more flavor in a little olive oil/butter mix and pepper. I may add a little more onion. This is one of my go to recipes for any function.  Everyone loves it.

I was going to make a basic caprese for a snack, but saw this recipe and decided to try it. It was really quick and easy to make. I baked mine quite a bit longer because I was worried that the center was not firming up like I wanted it to. Once it got to a certain point, I figured it would sit and firm the rest of the way because I did not want to dry it out. It is very tasty and I will certainly make it again.

My family loves this quiche.  Made it as is with no changes.  Just great.  The only difference was I did not cook the onions as long as recommended as I don't like onions really well done.  Other than that, definitely a keeper.

De-lish! Tastes like summer in Italy! I added pancetta, substituted mozzarella pearls,  and halved cherry tomatoes.  I bought a deep dish store bought crust and used only  6 eggs with an additional .25 cup of half and half. It think it is best to start with the cheese as the base layer of the pie crust cheese, then sprinkle with pancetta and basil, and merely dot the top with tomatoes. It took closer to an hour to cook  and requires cooling to to set up.

I made this for work today. The eggs kinda pushed the pie crust upward and above the pan (I used a deep dish crust!), so I may use fewer eggs and slightly less cheese or tomoatoes next time. Otherwise, this is awesome!

Prep time was closer to 30 minutes when you have to cut everything up. Now that I know that, I can be ready for that next time.

This was a hit! Easy to make and delicious! I made some minor alterations, adding Canadian bacon and mixing in raw onions.

There wasn't enough flavor  to recommend this recipe to others. Consistency was good - took about an hour to bake. I used the fresh sliced mozzarella on the bottom, not the shredded and perhaps that took away from the flavors of the basil and tomatoes because the slices were a quarter inch thick and it seemed to be more of a cheese quiche than anything else. I added a little heavy cream and used one less egg than was listed in the recipe.

Used 4 eggs, a half cup of milk and 1Tbsp of mayo. Split the cheese in half and layered half on bottom and half on top just before the egg mixture. Delicious!

Yum! (I only had 6 eggs, though. So I did use 1/2C heavy cream and 1/2C skim milk.) The caramelized onions really made a nice touch.

This quiche turned out a bit dry for me, despite adding a quarter cup of whole milk and baking for less than the recommended 30-40 minutes. Next time, I'll add a bit more milk and leave the baking time the same. Aside from that, the flavors were great. I stirred in sautéed kale along with the sautéed onions and used feta instead of mozzarella.

Had to cook for over an hour and it was still runny.. Did like others said and used 5 eggs and 1/2c of half and half. Family loved the tomatoes/mozz and basil! It was a big hit except for the middle being runny.

This turned out great. I did not have fresh basil or fresh mozzarella so I used dried basil, and shredded mozzarella. I only had 6 eggs so I added 1/2 cup of milk. I also added 10oz of frozen spinach (thawed and drained)Everyone raved about how yummy it was.

Very easy and tastes GREAT!  Didn't have a pie pan so I used a Corning Ware dish.  We eat this for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I never have fresh tomatoes on hand so I use canned diced tomatoes.

This was delicious!  I omitted the onions because my boyfriend doesn't like them, but I'm sure they would be very good in this recipe.  I also added a bit of parmesan cheese...maybe about an ounce or two.  It was easy to make and very tasty!
