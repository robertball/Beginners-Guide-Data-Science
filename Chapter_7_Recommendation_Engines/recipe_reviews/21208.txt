Wow! I have made this granola 4 times since I found the recipe a few weeks ago. As soon as the family eats it up, I make more. I've changed it a bit each time, after reading all the reviews, and I think I've finally settled on my favorite: I use oats, sliced almonds and sunflower seeds (but no other nuts), whole flax seed, wheat germ (about 1/2 cup each)for added nutrition, plus coconut for sweetness. I up the oil and honey just a bit, plus add a bit of real maple syrup for flavor. I add a combo of regular and golden raisins, but only at the very end (otherwise they burn-yuck!). I bake it on parchment, on a lower temp (about 225) and stir often, every 7-10 minutes. I pulled it off to another pan to cool - trust me, this is a must! And then finally, since we like ours clumpy, as it was cooling, I pulled off bits and squeezed hunks together. I then mixed about half the still warm granola with about 1/3 cup powdered milk. It gave amazing flavor and texture to the finished product. This recipe is PHENOMENALLY good - and versatile and cheap. Wow, what's not to love?

Holy Cow. This is fabulous. I followed some other reviewer's advice and made some adjustments. I used about 3/4 of a cup of applesauce and just a splash of olive oil in place of the canola oil. I also increased the honey to 1 cup. I added probably 1/3 cup of crunchy peanut butter to the  "oil" mix and added orange flavored crasins to soak while I mixed the dry ingredients. I think the only thing I added to the dry part was about 1/3 cup brown sugar.  I baked it all at 275 for about 25 minutes. I took it out and stirred it every 7 minutes and then reset the timer for another 7 minutes when I was done, and I did that 3 times total plus I left it in for about 4 minutes at the end. I dumped both pans onto paper towels to cool before I stored it, and neither my husband or I could keep from grabbing handfuls of it while it sat there. YUM!

Delicious!  Don't forget (like I did) to let the granola cool on paper towels; otherwise you'll be scrubbing the cookie sheet for a long time.  Will definitely make again.

I make this ALL the time...as soon as I run out I'm back at the store stocking up on supplies to make more.  After baking, I add cranberries, golden raisins, coconut, chopped dried apricot...whatever I have.  It's just so delicious. I gave away tins of it at Christmas.

This granola is the absolute best I have ever had!!! I will NEVER buy it from a grocery store again, so easy to make and turns out absolutely delicious. I added in some wheat germ, flax seeds and used a locally produced wildflower honey. I would definitely suggest for people to bake the granola on either a sheet of parchment or in a non-stick oven roaster, that way you'll have no problems and won't have to scrape it off baking sheets!!!

Love, love, love it! I've been making this recipe for 2 1/2 years.  As soon as it's gone, the family is begging for more.  I have tried other recipes now and then, but always come back to this one.  I double the recipe for the dry stuff and triple the recipe for the wet ingredients.  Makes it a little higher in fat, but it bakes up in nice chunks and tastes super!  I also add 1/2 cup of wheat germ and 1/2 cup of ground flax seed for nutrition.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Nice and crunchy--like store bought granola cereal. My kids love this in their yogurt. I cut the calories by decreasing the oil to 2 T. (I use olive instead of canola) and adding 1/3 c. applesauce. I also add 1/4 c. wheat germ and cut the cinnamon a bit for my personal preference. I then bake for 20 min. instead of 10 (stirring twice) and add 1 c. mini-chocolate chips after the granola cools a bit.

A wonderful gift recipe--friends and family received it last Christmas.  And I've been making it regularly since.  Great for breakfast or out-of-hand afternoon snack.  I increase the honey to 2/3 cup and mix it with the oil and vanilla before adding to the oatmeal for more thorough combining of ingredients.  If adding fruit (dried cherries, cranberries, or raisins), let them soak in the oil/honey while you chop nuts or combine the dry ingredients.  Keeps them chewy even after baking.

THis recipe was very easy.  However, It needed about twice as much honey to get the clumping going on.  I also thought the sunflower seeds took the nutty flavor over the top.  I made a second batch replacing the sunflower kernals with rice crispies, and doubling the honey.  It was perfect then,

It is very rewarding (and so easy!) to make your own granola! I never buy it premade anymore. I've made this recipe several times and have adjusted it slightly to my preferences. Adding a cup or so of dried cranberries gives it a lot more oomph. Also, walnuts work just as well as pecans. I double the honey and add only a couple of tablespoons of oil, and add extra vanilla. Instead of two baking sheets, it works just as well to throw the whole thing in a big roasting pan, as long as you turn the granola over a few times. It's best to simply monitor the granola in the oven, baking it until it's the right amount of golden for your taste.

I was looking for a granola recipe so that I could stop spending $5 on little bags of granola from the grocery store.  This recipe is the perfect solution!  My huband loves it, and I make a double batch every other weekend to keep him stocked up.  I add it my yogurt for breakfast most mornings.  It's so yummy!!  I make a few changes: add some unsweetened, very finely shredded organic coconut (from Whole Foods) shredded), add some organic puffed rice cereal, skip the pecans (not a big fan), add 1/4 cup of golden flax seeds, and add a little more honey.  I also bake it a little longer than the recipe calls for, just watching for the right light golden color.  This might be because I double the recipe and my cookie sheets are nearly overflowing.  I can't say enough about this recipe.  It's so versatile.  You can make it entirely organic if you want, add ingredients, and play around with it for different tastes and textures.  I'm so glad I found it!!

This granola is very good.  It became crunchy after it cooled, which was what I was looking for.  I added only about 3T of oil and about a cup of honey, and I also added about 3/4 cup of coconut and some extra cinnamon before I baked it. I stirred it every 5-10 minutes while baking (I used 13"x9"x2" pans instead of cookie sheets to make stirring easier), and it took about 25-30 minutes at 275 degrees.  It browned nicely without burning.  I'll be making this again, and I'm looking forward to trying some different variations!

SOOO yummy and so easy.  I could have eaten it all!  I did let mine cook about 30 minutes total, but keep an eye on it,  because it will go from toasted to burnt quickly

I would DEFINITELY give this as a gift!!!  Looks great and tastes great.  We made this for a road trip and it was great.  Doubled the honey (and then some) to get bigger clumps as previously suggested, and half the sunflower seeds, and even that may have been too much.  Bought rice krispies but forgot to put them in - I will try that next time!  At first when I took it out of the oven, I did not think it was done because it was still loose and wet looking, but after sitting for like 15 minutes, it firmed up and dried out.  I was able to break it off in chunks but rolling up the aluminum foil that I baked it on, and pouring it directly into a ziplock bag.  If they are still moist, keep that bag open until it dries out before you seal it!!  Great road trip food.  DELICIOUS!!!

so good!
i doubled the batch and gave out as christmas gifts.  I agree with some of the others that it could use a bit more honey.  I made the recipes as follows, but added some orange zest with the honey/oil mixture.  I also mixed dried cranberries, blueberries and raisins after it cooled.
I lined my cookie sheets with foil and let it cool on the pan - no problems with clean up!

Great recipe to start with.  I use the oats and wet ingredients,, but everything else changes each time.  I add whatever add-ins I have on hand.  Usually I use lots of dried fruit and some nuts. I also like more cinnamon, so I double that.

Good- I added some coarse sea salt to give it a little punch and that did the trick. I turned the oven down to 250 after the first 10 minutes, then stirred it every 7 minutes thereafter for a total of three 7 minute stints. It came out perfectly.

This is a great recipe. I omitted the sunflower seeds, and pecans. the first time i made these i used 1/2 cup of honey...my family said it wasn't sweet enough so the second time i used 3/4 cup of honey and 1/4 cup of light brown sugar they loved it that time. It is a great recipe. I also added raisins for my family (i don't prefer raisins). It is great in yogurt...i used greek honey flavor...and also great as cereal....I will definently make these alot.

Added wheat germ, flax seed and raisins. Upped the honey, and used a high quality evoo. I baked on parchment for easy cleanup, and It took about 30 minutes (stirring every 7 minutes) to toast to golden brown at 300 degrees. I use this as a yogurt topping most mornings for breakfast. Absolutly yum!

This stuff is amazing! I use 5 c. oats, 1 c of whatever nuts I have on hand, and also add in fresh nutmeg (I add a little more honey and oil since I add in the extra ingredients). When it's done cooling I add in raisins, craisins, and apricots. Perfect by itself, as cereal, or as a yogurt topping!

:) this is so good! I didn't put in the sunflower seeds, but I doubled the almonds. I replaced canola oil with olive oil. It turned out perfect. It's good for dessert or breakfast, and makes a great cereal!

This is a very good and easy to make recipe! I like to add 1/2-3/4 cup of craisins/raisins/other dried chopped fruit. This recipe also works wonderfully as a breakfast cereal, just add milk and you have quiet the satisfying breakfast.

This recipe is great.  My husband liked it so well that he told me to make a larger batch so I could share it with a couple of friends of His.
It is such a nice alternative for oatmeal.

This was a really good recipe that's easy to customize to your personal tastes.  I added peanut butter based on other suggestions, and changed around my nut/seed combinations to what my family enjoys.  With some extra honey and brown sugar it stays chewy and you can keep it in larger chunks for snacking or easily break it up to sprinkle over greek yogurt (my favorite way to eat it).  YUM!

This is soo yummy! I made it a few years ago and decided to make it again. Way better then last time!! I made some changes, I doubled the honey to make it stick together, instead of sunflower seeds I added 1/2 cup of walnuts and cut down the pecans to 1/2 cup instead of 1, with the walnuts it was too many nuts. After baking it I put it in a gallon ziploc bag and then added a little more then 1 cup cranberries(I LOVE cranberries in my granola!) and around a cup of white chocolate chips and then shook it up to mix! I also only used 2 tablespoons of olive oil instead of canola oil and added 1/3 cup of applesauce instead of so much oil!

This is the best granola recipe.  I always double the recipe because we eat it up so fast.  I cut the fat by using all applesauce in place of the oil.  Smells great when baking.  It makes a nice gift too.  I just put it in quart canning jar and decorate the top with pretty fabric and decorative cord to tie it up.

I, too, added more honey than the recipe called for.  Probably about 3-4T more.  I also substituted walnut pieces for the sunflower seeds and baked about 5-8 min. longer than suggested.  This is a great recipe.  Is delicious with vanilla yogurt or plain with dried cranberries as a snack.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I love granola and this stuff is delicious! I am not eating processed sugar and the honey works perfectly adding a perfect amoung of sweetness. I added cashews instead of pecans and replaced the canola oil with coconut oil. I put the wet ingredients in a small pot on the stove first. I LOVE this stuff, SO delicious!

Couldn't believe how easy it was to make my own granola.  Next time, I would use coconut oil instead and bumping up the honey to 1 cup as I wanted more clumps.  I baked mine for 25 mins, making sure to stir every 5 mins as I was paranoid about it getting too toasty.

This was very good granola. I made a 1/2 recipe, to test it, and it did fill the baking sheet I used. I realized the sunflower seeds I bought were seasoned, so I just left them out. I also hand chopped my almonds, and that was fine. I got 6 servings, approximately, with the half a recipe and missing sunflower seeds. I lined the baking sheet with parchment and had no problems with sticking or any issues. This granola is not overly sweet, sticky, or too crunchy like many I have tried. It was fine in milk, but it was excellent on some plain yogurt.

Very, very nice granola.  I bake at 250 degrees for a longer time and add organic raisins and dried cranberries half way thru.  I then add flax seeds when its comes out of the oven.  It's a real hit with everybody I serve it to.

I have made this recipe week after week and it never fails! I have to do gluten free and it is so expensive to buy gluten free granola! I have adapted this to be gluten free (I use Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Oats) I also change up the nuts every time, but I keep the same ratio as the recipe gives. So good! Highly recommended.

I prefer granola to be sweeter; I'll probably double the honey or add some sugar if I make it again.

super delicious! however, i let it cool on foil because my first batch seemed to stick on the paper towels. Also, used just a splash of olive oil and added ground flax seed, maple syrup and a little brown sugar. will make this again!

I do love this granola recipe because it is so basic and you can add whatever you want. I added a touch more brown sugar & unsweetened coconut and whole lot of other nuts and it was simply delish!!

No one seems to make this recipe as is because it's so basic.  Adding coconut changes the recipe completely since it's so sweet. I found the baking time to be highly dependant on the cookie sheet you use, this recipe seems to assume a thin cookie sheet.  I had one batch on a dark thin sheet, and another on a thicker aluminum sheet, and the granola was close to burning on the first sheet while still raw on the second.

This was so easy! I mixed the wet ingredients in a saucepan over very low heat to give the honey a chance to thin a bit and mix well with the oil. I baked it on a cookie sheet with a silicone mat so it didn't stick. After baking I put it on another silicone mat to cool (although it probably would have been fine on the original one).

A very good basic recipe.  I would only add that you should cover your baking sheets with parchment paper or foil to prevent any mess and sticking.  Otherwise, you'll be trying to scrape granola off of your sheets for a week.  Also, if adding nuts, use raw (not roasted) when baking the mix. If you (like me) only have roasted nuts, add them in after baking, but before the mixture is cooled.  I also add in raisins and chopped dates at this time.  Anyway, it's a very good recipe and you're going to enjoy it!

Very good but consider lowering the temperature to 250 so it does not burn. Next time I will add a little more honey.  Try adding some raisins after cooking for sweetness.

This was good, I think next time I will add more honey though, I like my granola to have big chunks. And I would also add a little more flavor, maybe some extra vanilla. I also used dried cranberries in mine, that was really yummy.

I love this recipe!  It is so perfect in yogurt. The only change i made was to use coconut oil instead of canola.  I didnt have any canola oil.
I also found that i had to leave it in the oven a bit longer to make it really crunchy.. My favorite so far.

Good recipe.  The kids and I liked it.  A nice break from the other granolas I have made that are a lot more time consuming.  I substituted walnuts for the sunflower seeds and decreased the amount of nuts by a little bit so that I could also add 1/4 cup flax seed and 1/4 cup wheat germ.  Will make again!

I increased the honey to 1 cup.  I also added whole almonds and pecans instead of chopping them.  I added cranraisins and raisins at to the cooling granola.

I don't often rate recipes, but this one is worthy. If you buy much granola you know it is much more expensive than the sum of its parts. This is not only outstanding, you can pick your nut addition, I don't always have the exact ones and also use walnuts. I also add a 1/4 cup of flax seed for a little health kick without changing the flavor. I have found that baking it works best for me if I stir it every 10 minutes the first couple of times and then drop back to 7 for the finish laps. I bake my until there is a noticeable color change, I.E. it starts to darken. This makes a granola that breaks up easily and stays that way in storage for me.

great recipe.
i added about 1/2 tsp. sea salt and didn't use the seeds. 
i also used coconut oil - which is pretty solid at room temperature and seems to help the granola clump up better. 
so easy.  thanks for this great recipe - i'll be making this often.

This granola is WONDERFUL!!!  I've made it 3 times in the past week.  I used applesauce instead of the oil and doubled the honey... I had to bake it a little longer when using the applesauce. SOO good!!

I love this!  I like knowing exactly what's in it and I love knowing this is a healthy snack for the kids! (and me) I changed it slightly, I used a jar of mixed nuts and gave them a light chopping.  I also don't like TOO overwhelming of a honey flavor so I decreased the honey by about 1/8 cup and added a tablespoon of brown sugar.  OH and the nuts and sunflower seeds I used were salted to give just a slight salt punch.  This is a hit!

Love this recipe.  I have added less oil and added mashed banana and applesauce.  This recipe is a classic because there are so many possibilities to add what you want to it.

This is a very good base recipe. I've been replacing butter/oil with applesauce in all my baking recipes and I think it's a nice improvement in this one also. I've added so many variations to this recipe and it never fails!

I substituted the almonds and pecans with flax seeds, sesame seeds and puffed rice cereal. Mine took about 25 minutes to cook. If you add dried fruit, I would recommend waiting until the granola only has about 10 minutes left to cook before adding it. My raisins got a little puffy and hard! Next time I will add more oats as this was very seed/nut heavy, and I will take some of the advice posted here on how to make it stick together better. Mine was very crumbly. But it tastes good!

Awesome! Made it yesterday, and it's even better today. I did read some reviews, and I did increase my honey to 1 cup, and add a 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also baked mine for 30 min, stirring every ten minutes.

Very good! My daughter is allergic to nuts so I left out the almonds and pecans. Instead, I added 1 cup of sweetened shredded coconut, 1/4 cup of ground flax sead and 3/4 cup of assorted chopped dried berries. I usually like crunchy granola that clumps together. This came out kind of chewy and didn't really clump, but I still really liked it. I cooked it at 275 for 15-20 minutes, mixing once or twice.

Awesome granola recipe! I used 1/3 cup of extra-virgin olive oil instead of the canola and accidentally used 1 tablespoon of vanilla instead of one teaspoon. Came out amazing!!  I intend to keep using the 1 tbsp from now on!  Really good base recipe for granola...I'm excited to start experimenting with it.  My husband says he wants this as a staple from now on. That's a lot coming form him!!  :)

Very good!  I followed the recipe and used parchment paper.  Next time I'll try some of the additions others have suggested like cashews, raisens and coconut.  We're eating it like a snack until I can get some yogurt at the store!

Great granola.   Omitted oil and used applesauce and added 1/4 c wheat germ and more honey.  Can also add cranberries, raisins, dates and/or coconut-I've added 1 cup of each during the last 10 minutues.   I'll never buy granola in the store again.   This is so easy to make.

The adults in the family loved this!  Would use a little more honey to help it stick into clusters and a touch more cinnamon.  As for the recipe/taste - wouldn't change a thing.

My husband loved this recipe. It's the first thing I've been able to get him to bring to work to snack on instead of buying junk from the vending machine.  I also learned that you really do need to spread it out on two baking sheets and add more honey.

Very good. I used the reviews as a guide and maybe I should have started with the original recipe and modified from there. It was too cinnamon-y and not quite sweet enough. It also took a very long time to brown up enough. I think sticking to the original would have been a better starting point for me!

I have made this several times and it comes out great every time!  Like others I doubled the honey and  used applesauce instead of oil (with just a small splash of olive oil.)  Delish.  I also added additional vanilla and cinnamon, since I prefer strong flavors.  Overall it is wonderful

This is a great recipe!  We have it all the time, and I have never made it the same way twice.  You can substitute different kinds of nuts, add coconut or wheat germ, or use maple extract instead of vanilla.  It's great as cereal, or sprinkled over yogurt.

I made this first the way the recipe said, but it wasn't very sweet, and I think the temperature was too high. I substituted 1/3 cup maple syrup and 1/3 cup light brown sugar instead of the honey. It was much better. I also added dried cranberries. This is a good recipe, it just needs a little work.

we really like this! my only change is adding about a half cup of ground flax seed, and reducing the honey to just a tad over 1/3c because we like it not so sweet. it's all we eat for breakfast now - I'm in love!

quick and easy granola. we love it in parfaits. I didn't use honey but maple (pancake) syrup as my honey had clumped up. bought quick oats and still worked out fine. a nice crunchy, naturally sweet snack.

Delicious and easy -- except I left mine to cool overnight and woke up to hard-as-rock granola stuck to the middle of the pan.  Next time I'll line the pan.  I also subbed coconut oil and pumpkin seeds, which were great.

This is the first time I've ever made granola, and it turned out pretty good. I used walnuts & almonds but no sunflower seeds, added some flaxseed and low sugar craisins. I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon which gave it a wonderful "fall" flavor, and I baked it a little longer, stirring it often. I would have liked to have it clump together more and will try adding some applesauce as some have suggested.

I make this all the time with hazelnuts instead of pecans. I also add an extra cup of oats to make it go a little further, but the recipe is perfect as written.

I'm making this recipe once a week for my family.  We all love it!  I adjust things to add once baked - dried cranberries, raw cacao nibs, flax seeds...
I always bake on oil-sprayed parchment paper for ease of removal from the sheet and clean up.

I have made this granola many times.  It is still my favorite, and so quick and easy to make.  I usually add about 1/4 cup of coconut.   It is especially good on my homemade yogurt.

This is a very good recipe. I added flax seed, wheat bran, and a pinch of salt, and it ended up being really delicious. I did end up having to bake it longer than the recipe calls for, however; I think it was about 40 minutes total at 275 degrees. I will make this again and play around with different nuts/fruits to add.

Worked great! I only changed a few things. First  I added a little extra honey and oil to the liquid. I then brought the mixture to a boil on the stove to promote crunchiness and clusters. Pretty much the rest was the same and I turned out with golden crunchy  sheets perfect for breaking into clusters for breakfast or snacking.

Perfect, exactly the basic recipe I was looking for.  The oil/honey ratio is perfect, the granola is crispy and doesn't stick together.  I might add a little brown sugar for extra sweetness next time.  You can add any nut mixture you want, I used macadamia nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts and I'll add dried fruit to the baked/cooled mixture.  Thank you Karen for a basic and crunchy recipe.  I'll use this over and over again.

This granola is excellent! I like that it uses vegetable oil and not butter. I also added chopped walnuts, sesame seeds and dried blueberries - a very versatile and delicious recipe. Great for a change when breakfasts get boring!

A very forgiving recipe! I subbed wheat germ for the almonds, used roasted, salted sunflower seeds, added about 1/3 c. peanut butter, and sprinkled with brown sugar (just had to). We all loved it. Served with yogurt.

I was so excited to finally finda Granola recipe that was delicious! I used the Olive oil instead of Canola oil, only to save on calories and fat. This was amazing and easy to cut recipe in half or double! This is extremely simple and whats best is that you can add things to it! If you are waiting for a great Granola recipe; I don't what is keeping you. Thank you for this great, simple recipe!

I make this all the time. Very yummy and easy to sub different nuts and seeds to suit your tastes. The first time I made it, I used all the oil. But I've made it since replacing all but 1 tablespoon with applesauce and found its just as good. Sometimes I add a couple of tablespoons of maple syrup for some extra flavour. I cook mine for closer to 30 minutes and I line the baking sheet with waxed paper which makes for easy clean-up.

Great recipe. I did make some changes though. The bake time seemed very short to me and after 20 minutes my granola was still very soft. I baked it for another 30 minutes, stirring every 10. I also added 1/2 cup of wheat germ and about 1/4 cup ground flaxseed. I added cranberries and used whole almonds instead of sliced and also used a Tb of almond extract which gave it great flavor! Yum!!

I like this granola a lot. I didn't have sunflower seeds so I just doubled the almonds and I used walnuts instead of pecans because that's what I had. After it was cooked and cooled I added some crasins. I like the bits of chewiness the crasins add. This recipe (as with most granola recipes) is great because you can add and subtract what you and your family likes. I eat mine in a bowl with milk like cereal.

I made this for my boyfriend as a treat for Valentine's Day - he loves granola more than any other food!  And sure enough, he LOVES this recipe!  (I do too!)    Some adjustments: I used 1 cup of honey (and next time I think I'll use even more).  I also used 3/4 cup of apple sauce and just a splash of canola oil.  I added roughly smashed cashews, sliced almonds, sunflower seeds, roughly smashed walnuts, and dried, unsweetened coconut.  Next time I think I'll add a bit of brown sugar or maple syrup, too.

Really tasty and easy to make! I used a mixture of old-fashioned and quick oats. I omitted the sunflower seeds and instead used 1/2 cup whole flax seeds. I didn't have enough honey so I used 1/2 cup of a mixture of honey, maple syrup and corn syrup. Tasted just as well. I had to bake for about 8 extra minutes before it seemed done. I agree it needs a lot more honey or something to sweeten it though. It's a good cereal.

OUTSTANDING!  I Made this for my family to rave reviews.  This recipe is also good for people like me, who are not allergic to nuts but are allergic to dairy (many boxed granolas contain milk!) At least I know whats in my granola now!
Once again...outstanding!

Love it love it love it!!!  I used half quick oats and half regular (diff textures) and 1c each of craisins, almonds, rice crispies and ground flax seeds.  Doubled the honey as recomended by others and baked an extra 5 min (25 min total). Beautiful and tastes great!!

This has been a staple in my home.  We eat it with plain yogart and berries or just as it's own cereal.  I also like it because it is so easy to improvise.  I usally don't buy pecans, however, you can add just about anything (flax seed, sesame seed, coconut. etc.) and it still tastes good b/c there is so much honey.  I also sometimes add raisins after it has cooked.

This recipe was very yummy. It didn't have as much flavor as I would have liked so I would suggest adding some extra honey, but it was still delicious.

I found the cook time listed on this recipe far too long. It was delicious once mixed with other ingredients, but the mixture was very heavy on its own.

Very nice!  The good thing about this recipe is that you can really play with what you put in and how much.  As per other reviewers suggestions, I used homemade applesauce but almost tripled the amount (ie. almost 1 cup) and halved the amount of honey.  I also had to change the bake time to 200 degrees for an hour cause mine burnt a bit on the recommended temp. as it wasn't near done after 20 min.  All in all, a great recipe and lots of good suggestions from others.

This is wonderful, I cooked it at about 225 for around 30min stirring every 3-4min to keep it from burning I like it crunchy.

This was very good. I also added applesauce instead od oil. I think it made it more moist. I also added raisens in place of sunflower seeds. But be sure to add them after baking. You wont be sorry if you make this not too sweet and not too tasteless.

Really good flavor...better than you buy at stores.  I added extra honey like many others and still found I should have added more.  Next time I might double the honey just to get extra chewiness.  I've given out the recipe to 2 people already and I just made it yesterday!  Thank you!

Excellent recipe!  I substituted applesauce for the oil and it turned out great!  Definitely watch that it doesn't burn - I didn't bake it for as long as the recipe suggested and it still got a little too brown.  Perhaps lowering the oven setting would help.

This is a really good recipe. I modified it by adding twice the honey half the oil, omitting the almonds and sunflower seeds(I didn't have any), and adding some brown sugar. I also baked it at a lower temp, 275d, for about 23 min. First batch burned at 300d. Could be my oven, though. Try it!

I was looking for something crunchy to put on the yogurt and fruit I eat for lunch.  This wasn't quite it, but with some tweaking I think it might be.

This is a great overall recipe.  I tinkered with it a bit to match my tastes: I substitued crispy rice cereal for the almonds, omitted the sunflower seeds, added about 1/2 cup of wheat germ, substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil, and substituted maple syrup for the honey.  I added maybe another tablespoon of honey because I like my granola pretty sweet.  Be sure to bake in very shallow layers on baking sheets, though; I tried to be clever and use a cake pan and just dump all of it in there at once, and it took about an hour and a half to brown it all!  Next time I make this, I will use two baking sheets with sides.

Love this and keep making more. I use cashews instead of pecans and add mixed seeds such as pumkin and flax as well as soy nuts. As other reviewers have done I skipped the oil and used applesauce and increased the honey.

This was delicious.  I made up a batch to eat with vanilla yogurt and it stayed fresh and crunchy for several days. All I had were almonds and raisins, so that's what I used. I meant to mix in some peanut butter but forgot, so maybe next time I'll do that.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a really great starter recipe. I have never made granola before but it turned out better than expected. I put almost a cup of honey in but it definitely needed more. I added flavored craisins and it was so good. I couldnt believe I made my own cereal and it was better than some I have bought. My husband thought of all kinds of things to add for variety. So I will be making this more often. And it was so easy!!

Definitely a great flavor and combination of nuts and oats.  Like the others before me, I'll add a little more honey for bigger chunks.  Definitely a great choice for a snack!

I make this recipe plain (no nuts or seeds), using an entire 18.5 ounce carton of oatmeal (about 6 cups).  Delicious warm from the oven! 

(P.S - I have better luck mixing the honey in if I warm it a little in the microwave oven first.)

This was absolutely wonderful! I wanted a decent granola to give my yogurt some crunch and the store bought stuff way too sweet for me (Type 1 diabetic). This not only filled the bill, but the taste is great!
I did not use wheat germ, used coconut instead, and cut the recipe in half because it is just my husband and myself. I had a difficult time not eating an entire bowl.

Love this recipe! I've  made it before. I'm just reviewing now. I  made a couple of additions. I used grapeseed oil because i didn't  have coconut oil. Instead of vanilla, I used almond and coconut extract. I added flax seeds, walnuts and flaked coconut. At the end fresh out the oven I added raisins and dried cranberries. I love it! I use  as topping for yogurt and ice cream, as cereal and as snack. The uses are many.

The first time I made the granola, I halved the recipe but put a tsp of dried, minced coconut in since we love the taste of coconut. It was really good! The second time around, we added some cashews, a few tblsp. of  dried grated coconut and about 1/4 cup of craisins to the mix, still making half the amount at a time since there are only 2 of us in the house regularly. This recipe can be varied quite a bit and we love this granola. Thank you!

I made it and it was delicious! I covered my cookie sheet with foil and it was sticking to the foil. The second time I made it, I greased the foil with cooking spray and it came out much better.

I don't put the volume of nuts in to reduce calories and sprinkle much more cinnamon! I'll add dried cranberries or chocolate chips for variety depending on my mood. I mostly use is on my morning yogurt.

I probably shouldn't be leaving a review because I made so many changes to it. We were out of granola and this was a "I'm not going to the store, use what we have" moment.
I used 1 cup flax seeds, one cup sunflower seeds, and 1 cup peanuts for the add ins. and then I used coconut oil instead of canola and used a 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup maple syrup instead of honey. 
The house smelled great and it tastes great.

Delicious and addictive! I’ve made this recipe many times and every time I put it in the oven the whole house smells like cinnamon rolls! Normally I’ll cut the recipe in half because it makes too much for me. This granola isn’t too sweet and it has just the right amount of cinnamon. I definitely would recommend making this granola!

A very tasty healthy granola option! You can tasty the difference from the store bought granola! Used almonds, pecans and walnuts and threw in raisins at the end.  Baked for 40 minutes, turning every 10 minutes or so.  Very happy with this recipe!

This is so much better than store bought granola.  I've added golden raisins after baking, I've added pumpkin seeds and different nuts each time I've made it.  You can't mess this recipe up.

I have made this granola countless times and never do it exactly the same. You can use coconut oil and it’s still great. Add pepitas, cranberries, loads more cinnamon: you can cut back on the honey and it’s still awesome. Thanks for the great recipe! I’ve shared it more than once with friends.

Super easy and yummy breakfast treat. I might make it a bit sweeter in the future. I let them cool on paper towels and squeezed them when cooling as others suggested.

I have made this 4 times and I really like it.  Mostly I add fresh fruit and eat it with milk as a substitute for sugar-filled cold cereals. To mix it up I have used maple syrup for the honey and coconut oil for the canola. I always have this on hand for a quick snack.

Great recipe!  I've made this several times & we always love it.  I've made several variations of this-my most recent was with hazelnuts & mixed dried berries (strawberries, blueberries & cranberries).  I've made a tropical version with dried mango & candied ginger with macadamia nuts. Very yummy!  I used coconut oil instead of canola and use a mix of sunflower seeds, millet & pepitas instead of straight sunflower seeds.  I also up the cinnamon & vanilla and add a bit of salt to enhance the flavors.  I add 1/3 cup dried milk at the end - I think that puts it over the top!

I made this granola for my daughter to take on her trip to Paris! I put it in a clear bag, tied it with a bow, added a spoon and viola....breakfast in the morning! Just add milk.

So easy to make, and really tasty! I love having granola on hand to make yogurt parfaits, or for an afternoon snack. I made this as directed (except I used veg oil in place of the canola, because that's what I had on hand.). Lined my baking sheet with parchment paper for easy clean up. Granola will crisp up as it cools, so don't worry if it still seems moist when you pull it from the oven. Will make again!

This recipe is great. My first time making granola and I'm thrilled. I added craisins. It's the perfect combination of crunch, nuts, and craisin.

This is the first time I've ever made granola and I liked the way it turned out.  Instead of using 1 whole cup of sunflower seeds I used about 2/3 of a cup.  Then I used 1/3 of a cup of flax seeds to make it a little more healthy.  I'm excited to try it on some Greek yogurt for breakfast tomorrow!

Good good good! Followed the recipe exact with the exception of cashews instead of pecans. After baking for 20 minutes, the mixture was a little too dry so I added another batch of wet ingredients.  I was a little worried because it was very moist and wasn't  sure it would dry enough to eat it but after another  15 minutes baking and cooled, it turned out great!  Next time I may line my baking sheets with parchment paper as the mixture stuck pretty well to my cookie sheets...oh yeah I split the mixture into two batches as it made too much to fit on one sheet. I made one with cranberries and the other with chocolate chips

This is an excellent basic recipe for granola!  Like other reviewers, I've adjusted the ingredients with each new batch, using different nuts, cereals, etc., while keeping the "bones" of the recipe - oats, honey, nuts and oil - intact.   I highly recommend coconut oil in place of canola/vegetable oil.

Very good. I add coconut for my tastes and whatever variety of nuts I have on hand,  and I cook it on parchment longer than stipulated to get it crunchy.

My mom told me about this recipe.  She doesn't add the sunflower seeds.  I baked this at 7 minutes at a time, mixing in between, to total more than 20 minutes.  I had it all on one pan and clumped it up a little at the end to make it more sticky.  I added the Trader Joe's cran/blueberry/golden/raisin mix to it after it baked. I used this for teachers' gifts.  It's also really yummy with dried strawberries!

Love it! I add extras like cocoanut and dates, and don't use the cinnamon or vanilla, but that's personal preference. The ratio of oats to oil/honey is perfect. It's great with yoghurt, milk, or ice cream!

Good recipe!

I adjusted the recipe a little I put 2 cups of the oats through the food processor. It made the granola have more clusters.

I also prefer other nuts so I used almonds, pecans, cashews, and coconut. I just made the total amount of nuts match the recipe.

Easy recipe! If you want add chopped dried fruit to be more chewier and sweeter.  Add them at the end when granola is out of the oven and cooling down.

Divine! I love how its not super sweet and the cinnamon gives it an incredible punch. I make my own Greek yogurt and this granola is FABULOUS on it. I will never buy prepackaged granola again! Thank you for sharing your recipe. Its pretty amazing!

I've made this twice now, for GIFTS..once just to the recipe's instructions--it was EXCELLENT. The second time I made do with some things on hand (and it was vegan)....still turned out great. 
The second time I used melted coconut oil instead of canola-that was great. I also used agave syrup instead of honey. I personally like it with honey better, but it was very good with agave as well. 
I'm making it again, today, back to the recipe's instructions!

Came out looking nothing like the stock picture but came out good! I like it because it's not ad sweet as store-bought honey granola. I can't wait to top this on my yogurt.

This is delicious! I took the suggestions of others and doubled the honey, and baked on wax paper. Other than that followed the recipe as written. Turned out great!

My family and I love this recipe as is. I had a hard time finding raw sunflower seeds at the grocery store. I had to go to a specialty and health food store. This recipe makes a lot. Be sure to stir often while it is baking. I had to cook mine a little longer than what the recipe says. This is one I will keep forever!

I've made this granola many times, exactly to the recipe. We eat this on yogurt for breakfast most mornings, but family visitors fill bowls and eat it with milk. It's lightly sweetened with the honey, which is the way we like it.

Loved this recipe!  I had just read an article about the benefits of honey and cinnamon and this granola is delicious!  I added a bit more cinnamon.  My daughter made it as well and omitted the pecans to make it lower in fat . She said it was excellent!

This is perfect - even DH who does not like granola loves this recipe. I did a slightly healthier version with gluten free organic oats, peanuts (all I had in the cupboard), only 3T olive oil, 1/3C honey, vegan cocao nibs, cinnamon and craisins and baked it for 25 minutes. DH said that was the reason he liked it was because the oatmeal was crunchy sweet (instead of dry and gummy like store-bought). Thanks for sharing!

I have made this granola time and time again. Everyone always loves it, its so easy, and it makes a ton so its perfect to bag and give as a gift! I usually substitute walnuts for pecans. I also add 1/4 cup ground flaxseed for nutritional value. I bake for 20 minutes like the recipe suggests but I take it out and stir it every 7 minutes. It seems like 3 minutes wouldn't really make a difference but it does. This can get very brown (borderline burnt) very quickly so I think every 7 minutes is perfect. I bake it on wax paper for easy clean up and as its cooling I add some craisins. Perfect!

First time I've ever reviewed something online.  This is my go-to granola and I had to rate it.  It's great,  in the original recipe form.  But best of all... it's sooo easy to make, and so easy to mix-and-match.  Just this morning, I put in raw pumpkin seeds, a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, and dried cranberries.   Still with chopped pecans, too.  ( You can never have too many nuts.)  I've made it in many ways.  Next... I want to try with coconut oil, instead of canola oil.  Delicious!  Have to make it a couple of times a week.

this came out great!to make it less calories i did a few changes
i halved the recipe. used 2C oats, 1/4C walnuts, 1/4 almonds and a handful of sunflower seeds. i used 2 tbsp of coconut oil(gives awesome flavor) and 2 tbsp honey. i may have cooked mine 5 mins too long bc i didnt think it was brown enough but it came out crunchy with a toasty flavor. i think i would prefer if i made it a lil chewier. have to test that out on the next batch. overall awesome recipe with lots of room for variations with flavors and mixins. thanks! BF loved it too, we have been adding it to our greek yogurt!

Wonderful! I started to dig into it before it even cooled off and I love the delicious smell it fills my kitchen. I did however add just a 1/4 water and that created some nice big chunky clusters. A+ recipe!

Absolutely fantastic, I'll never buy pre-made granola again.  And it's easy to changed to fit your tastes; I ran out of honey in the middle of making this and substituted peanut butter, added walnuts in place of pecans and used regular oil and it still came out fantastic.  Makes quite a bit though, but it can be stored for quite awhile.

Really good recipe. The sunflower seeds didn't sound good so instead I used rough cut walnuts. Also I cooked more like 25 minutes. Thank you.

So good! Cant wait to have this on my yogurt tomorrow morning...the only thing I did different was to also add 1/2c. wheat germ. Delicious, crunchy, and so cinnamon-y. May add some dried fruits next time.  Thanks!

This recipe was perfect for my husband and I!  We were able to omit most of the 'optionals' and still have it turn out delicious.  It will really cut down on the money we spend trying to keep granola in stock.

Super easy and fun to make! I substituted walnuts for the sunflowers and added dried cranberries. I also doubled the honey as others did. Delicious!

For me, the beauty of this recipe is that it does not call for sugar!  My husband and I try to refrain from sugar as much as possible, and we enjoy using honey and agave for substitutes.  I made this into a cinnamon almond raisin granola to put on yogurt and it turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe Karen!

Awesome as written - but...we used 3/4 cup honey and added about 1/3 cup creamy peanut butter.  No trouble with it sticking to the pan - it came out perfect.  We stirred it about every 8-10 minutes and baked at 275 F for about 30 minutes total.  We made two batches and just used almonds, peanuts, and walnuts in one - and to the second batch we added coconut with all of the nuts and stirred in banana chips and craisins when it was just about done.  Awesome!  We probably spent $50 to buy all of the ingredients...but we bought big bags of nuts so we'll have plenty on hand.  Awesome with vanilla yogurt and ripe peaches!

EASY granola recipe! This is delicious and so simple. I had all the ingredients on hand unlike many other recipes. I made it according to directions but with a couple substitutions. I do not like sunflower seeds so I used almonds and walnuts, 1 & 1/2 cups total and 1 cup of dried cherries added during the last half of baking. I like the versatility of adding whatever nuts and or fruits you like or have on hand. I think I will add coconut and pecans next time. I will make this again and again. I normally mix up my own muesli concoction for breakfast with plain yogurt since commercial granola prices have gone through the roof. This will be a nice change from that. Great recipe. Thanks!

Excellent recipe.  I did modify the ingredients a bit though. I omitted the pecans, and substituted flax seed. I really enjoyed the nutty flavor from the flax. I also used 2/3 cup of honey rather than 1/2. And I didn't have any vanilla. I'll bet it would've been even better if I had!

Great granola!  I made it to the recipe at first but have since changed it: no nuts, added pumpkin seeds, flax seed, buchwheat groats, maple syrup, raisins and dried cranberries. I use olive oil instead of canola. It doesn't change the taste at all.  My brother loves it and eats it dry, as a snack. I prefer to mix mine with yogurt for breakfast. I'll never buy commercial granola again!

Really good! I used half the sunflower seeds and upped the oatmeal.  I don't think that it will make it to the container, before it is eaten up!

I love this recipe. I did exactly how the recipe went. Its got a perfect little crunch. The only thing i did different was cut it in half so it made less which was still a great amount! and i added raisins. 

I think next time i might add a little brown sugar to give it a little more sweetness!

Really delicious!  My only disappointment was that it didn't stick together more. I added more honey, less cinnamon, no sunflower seeds.  I liked the chewiness that craisins and golden raisins add to the granola.  It is really good to eat with vanilla yogurt layered with fresh fruit(strawberries/peaches).  YUMMY!!

This is a very good recipe and very easy!  I swaped sunflower seeds for dried cranberries otherwise followed to a T.  Mine took almost 40 minutes to brown.  I will be using this as my base recipe from now on.  I love that there isn't any sugar or corn syrup!

This is the best granola recipe. I was looking for a way to get my husband to eat oatmeal to help with his high cholestrerol. He refuses to eat oatmeal but eats this granola like candy. He thinks it is desert! Thanks!

So, I've never made granola or even eaten granola (except in the form of granola bars) so I wasn't quite sure what to expect w/this, but it "looked" healthy and included lots of things I like, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I did NOT use pecans (personal preference) and I decreased cin to 1 tsp and added 1 tsp of almond extract (I love almond!). I also added about double the vanilla because I used cheap imitation extract as opposed to the good stuff.  This recipe was a bit ambiguous for me, thought it could just be that I'm a moron (I wasn't sure when/how to combine the wet & dry...I ended up mixing both sep and then combining before baking).  Per an earlier review, I spread in 2 parchment lined cake pans for easier stirring.  I stirred regularly, though I question whether I really needed to.  I started at 275 for first 15 min, then upped to 300 for the remaining 25.  Both my husband and I have snatched bites from the pans and like it; he'll probably eat w/milk as cereal and I'll prob just eat dry for a snack.  

UPDATE:  It's the next day and I'm really enjoying this dry as a snack...the almond extract is really what's making it work for me!

This was so easy and really good. I used cashews instead of sunflower seeds. I was out of cinnamon, so obviously it was missing a little something. I'm sure next time it will be even better when I can use cinnamon.

AT LAST!!!!!!  My husband eats granola every day.  It got so expensive I thought I'd try to make it myself, after all, how hard could it be???  Little did I know, it would be a real chore to find a recipe that my husband liked.  Other recipes were too sweet, too oily, etc., etc., This one is perfection and I am so GRATEFUL!!!!  Thank you so much!

I needed to add more honey and vanilla for more flavor.  With out those two things it was a 3 star.  With them it was a 5 in flavor and 4 in consistancy.

I make at least one batch of this per week. My husband just loves it in the morning. One thing we like to add is just a hint (one half tsp) of Almond extract. Yummy, thanks a bunch for this gem of a recipe.

I love this recipe.  I have made it many times.  I cook the granola for 1 - 1 1/2 hours though to give it a more roasted flavor.  I also substitute maple syrup for part of the honey sometimes.

My boyfriend and I made this because we couldn't find our favorite cereal at the store for weeks.  This is our new favorite cereal!!  We also added raisins and M&M's for a hiking snack.  We baked ours for the regular time and it got a little crispy on the bottom shelf, so next time we will put it on the top shelf or in for less time.  Delicious!

I don't make any modifications and use the recipe as is.  Actually, that's not quite true.  I have been known to throw in a handful of dried cranberries after it's out of the oven.  I make this for gifts all the time - looks awesome in a large mason jar.  Everyone loves it.  Great with milk, stirred into yogurt or just eaten by the handful :-).  Do put it on parchment paper for baking.  Makes clean up a breeze!

Great tasting! I omitted the nuts due to allergies and added 1/4 c wheat germ. This is great with milk on top. Hubby raved about it, kids liked it. Will definitely make again.

Could use more bake time.  I used Ocean Spray's "Craisins" Orange Flavor Sweetened Dried Cranberries...which added a tangy surprise to my granola.  I also added some shreaded coconut.  Overall, a good recipe.  SUPER EASY!

This is awesome! Could use a little less cinnamon and a little more bake time, otherwise fantastic. With the right nuts and dried fruits it could be the best i've ever had.

This is wonderful...made for a church breakfast (planning on a yogurt trifle) and can hardly keep my hands off! I have tried to make several granola recipes, and they have turned out to be not what I was looking for, but this is a keeper. I did lightly sprinkle the top with white sugar...gave a bit more sweetness. Thanks for sharing!

This was good, but there is another recipe on this site I like a lot better.  This is a little heavy, but I bet it will be delicious with yogurt for breakfast.  The honey made it stick to the pan, and I had sprayed the pans with cooking spray.  So grease those pans!  I didn't have enough pecans, so I compensated with extra almonds and sunflower seeds.  I also lowered the baking time to 275, for 45 minutes, and stirred every 15 minutes.  The longer baking time made my granola a little dark, so cut back if that's not what you want.  But I don't think the baking time indicated in the recipe is long enough.

I used some suggestions from other reviews, but it really needs some more peanut butter!  1/3 cup was not enough!  Other than that, it was my first time making granola and it could not have been easier.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This recipe gets 5 stars for taste, but 1 star for easy of preparation. This may be because I altered the recipe. I added a ½ half cup of molasses and a ½ cup Karo syrup along with ½ tsp. cloves and ½ tsp. nutmeg. I also added 1 cup of raisins. I let the granola cool on the pan as the recipe suggested and I couldn’t get the granola off the pan. It was a huge mess! Next time I’ll transfer the warm granola to cool on parchment paper.

I've made this three times now and love it! I haven't added a lot of different things just the basic stuff with the original recipe and it's still great. I live in Africa and the cereal choices are few. Thanks for sharing this recipe...I'll be making many more times!

Good starter recipe. I took the advice of others and used a full cup of honey, and it was still not very sweet, which I liked.  I also added cranberries and golden raisins.  My 2 y-o loved it!

The only reason I didn't give this recipe 5 stars is because I changed its sweetness.  I know the recipe's called "honey" nut granola and many of the reviewers thought it needed more honey.  I don't ordinarily eat sweet cereals though, & it was too sweet & had way too much cinnamon for my taste.  I used a 2 oz. package of slivered almonds, 1/2 cup of sunflower seeds from a jar, 1/4 cup honey, & 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.  I also added 1/4 cup of wheat germ to the oat/nut mixture & added 1/3 cup of chunky peanut butter to the oil/honey mixture.  Before eating it, I add some raisons too.  Yummy!  My husband's been enjoying it as well.

Excellent, crunchy, tasty, and fun! I followed recommendations from some other reviewers here. I added walnuts, raisins, extra honey and switched the oil to applesauce. Also needed a little extra baking time.

This was really good.  My 6 year old son kept wanting to take it to school for snack.  It's not really sweet like a lot of other granola. I don't like pecans so I didn't use them.  Also, I only had vegetable oil so I used that instead of Canola oil.  I will make it again.  I think I will add honey wheat germ  like another one of my granola recipes calls for to get that extra fiber for my kids.

I really like this, but I bake it for much longer than it states in the recipe to get it good and crunchy. My son also likes me to double the sweetener.

Awesome recipe. I added brown sugar and dried cranberries. I also only used almonds but doubled up. I used twice as much honey and half the oil. Next time I will use applesauce in place of the oil (just didn't have any). I needed granola for another recipe and this is perfect. I plan on making it for xmas gifts this year.

I am enjoying this granola, however, I don't think I used quite enough honey. I would have added a bit more like some of the reviewers suggested.  ALso, although I like sunflower seeds, I found 1 cup to be a bit much.

Very good! I really like that it is not too sweet like most of the recipes I've tried.  I've made this several times and we eat it like cereal.  I'd like to make it into actual bars - has anyone done this with out adding tons more oil or honey??

My family and I love this recipe.  We make it every week, sometimes changing the ingredients for variety.  Our favorite variations are maple (1/4 c. maple syrup, 1/4 c. honey, no cinnamon) and coconut (add 1 cup grated, unsweetened, to either honey or maple varieties.) I usually bake a little longer--probably 30 minutes.  Thanks Karen!

I've made this granola a couple times and I love it.  Made a double batch at Christmas and gave as gifts in pretty celophane bags tied with beautiful ribbon.  For a double batch, I used 1/3 cup oil and 1 cup honey.  Also added dried cranberries after baking.  Baked at 250 for a longer period of time, turning often.  Wonderful!!!

I made it per the recipe and it turned out very tastey.  Next time I'll add more honey as others suggested to get the granola to clump together more.  As I made it, the oats didn't really stick together in clumps like we prefer it to.  Very good flavor though...and definitely worth experimenting with!

I loved this recipe!  I added and extra 1/4C honey and replaced the sunflower seeds for walnutes.  I sprayed a jelly roll pan with non stick spray and wiped off the excess.  Baked for the length of time suggested.  Important to stir while the mixture is cooling.  This is great for a diet that doesn't allow for refined sugar!  The natural sugar in honey makes this very tasty!

I definately have to try making this again.  I followed some suggestions in reviews I had read, and added lots more honey.  But I think that is where my troubles started.  This turned out really gooey for me, even with additional baking time.  I dont know if thats what people were going for, but next time I am going to try it per the recipe and see what consistency I get.  So three stars, but that is my fault.

Delicious granola.  My kids love it.  What a healthy snack.  Yummy.
