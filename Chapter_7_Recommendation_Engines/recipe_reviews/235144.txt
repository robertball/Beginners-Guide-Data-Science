Perfect! Sauté the onions and marinade while the steak is grilling. Serve with yellow rice and grilled zucchini and summer squash.YUM! Great for taco leftovers.

The marinade has good flavor.  I set some aside and made a sauce.  It’s important to cook and cut the steak properly so it’s tender.

Did not use London Broil, used round steaks.  So Tender!  A little unsure about the number of onions.  Seemed way too much, but we put them on the grill on foil and all was delicious.  Made street tacos with the leftovers!
