Absolutely wonderful potatoes!!  I did make a few minor changes though.  I never actually have mayo - I only have Miracle Whip Light in the fridge so that's what I used.  And taking the advice from some others, I used 1 cup of Miracle Whip Light and 1 cup of light sour cream.  I also used Lite Velveeta Cheese & the potatoes still tasted very rich and yummy even using all light ingredients.  I stirred the bacon bits in with everything else instead of putting them on top & added some dried chives instead of the chopped onion.  I combined some crushed cornflakes and melted butter and sprinkled it on top before baking.  For some reason, my kids will eat anything with a crunchy topping!  I did bake the dish covered for the first half hour so the cornflakes didn't get too brown.  Everyone loved this dish.  In fact the kids like to call it Potato Skin Casserole because they said it tastes just like potato skins - but so much easier for me to make!!

These potatoes are okay, but I would recommend the Hash Brown Casserole by Diane also off this site.  I like it much better.  I used half mayo and half sour cream.  The potatoes were heavy, but not greasy.  I also used fresh bacon rather than bacon bits.  It wasn't bad, but I will go back to my usual recipe.  I think it is much better.

This recipe was not only yummy, but very easy to make.  I made this for a father's day cookout and it was a hit.  I would recommend a few changes:
instead of the bottled bacon bits, cook up about 12 pieces of bacon and cut them up in small pieces.  Also, I used 1 cup each of mayonnaise / sour cream and 3/4 brick of Velveeta rather than 1lb.  One other suggestions, use the southern style hash browns rather than the shredded.  It makes mixing a lot easier.  Try this recipe with these few changes and you won't be sorry!!!!

Not at all healthy or elegant--just a really yummy, cheese-y potato casserole.  I've tried several variations on the potato casserole theme (usually they call for canned soup and I just don't like the flavor it imparts)--this is by far the best I've tried.  I cut this in half for our family of four--it worked beautifully.  I baked it in a 1.5 quart round casserole and baked for approx. 35 mins.  I'd highly recommend giving this a try!

I try to lighten the recipe up a little bit by using 1 cup of light mayo and 1 cup of light sour cream instead of 2 cups regular mayo.  I also like to saute the onion with some garlic before adding it to the potatoes.  This recipe is killer !

I have made this recipe for several years both in the oven and in the crockpot. It is always a big hit at our annual Superbowl parties.  The only difference is that I use the O'Brien style hashbrowns w/the peppers and onions already in them and all sour cream, no mayo.  I'll have to try the mayo version sometime, though.  It's also great if you add leftover cooked chicken or ham.  Makes an easy casserole dinner & the kids always love it.

One of my son's favorite dishes...but only when
I brown the potatoes and onions first, add pepper, and use l/2 mayo and l/2 sour cream.  The
browning gives it more flavor and also cuts down
on baking time.  Use real (soft) bacon bits.

I made this for my family Easter gathering.  This recipe was GREAT.  It was super easy to put together.  I assembled it and put it in the refrigerator until I was ready to pop it in the oven.  I told everyone to rate the potatoes with 5 stars being the best.  Everyone, I mean everyone gave it 5 stars!  My mother-in-law took the recipe home with her.  Out of 10 people we almost ate the whole casserole.  One thing I did do, was what another reviewer suggested.  I substituted 1 cup lite sour cream and used 1 cup lite mayo.  I also used lite velveeta and didn't used all of the bacon bits it called for. It's a keeper!!!  Thank you.

Very easy and tatsy!  Got several compliments and had requests to keep the leftovers.  Used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream.  Mixed 1/2 bacon bits in with potatoes. Remaining bacon on top.  Added a little shredded cheddar on top last few minutes of cooking.

This is the absolute best potato casserole I have ever made! I can't believe how easy it was. Use Velveeta cheese and Hormel real bacon bits are the best. You won't be disappointed! Thanks for this recipe!

this is one tasty side dish, if you like potatoes and cheese, I highly recommend trying this. I used velveeta cheese as someone else recommended and it was just as good the next day

I LOVE these potatoes.  My mom has been making these "heart attack on a plate" potatoes for years sans the onion and bacon bits.  To cut down on the fat, use light mayo and light velveeta cheese.  Still has the same great taste, but half the fat!!!!!  Always a favorite at any kind of potluck dinner!

I wanted to cook this, but didn't have all of the exact ingredients.  So, I tossed peeled & diced whole potatoes with grated cheddar cheese along with all of the other ingredients.  (I also seasoned with some parsley, ground black pepper and onion salt.) After pouring into the baking dish, I added a splash of milk here & there.  Baked for 1 1/4 hour.  We all loved it--toddler, too.

Kinda bland as written - in my opinion.  I made again last night with some modifications.  I had a 16 oz jar of 4 Cheese Salsa Con Queso that I have been wanting to do something with for a while now, so I used that in place of the processed cheese & added enough to taste of salt and pepper.  I also crumbed up fresh fried bacon instead of using bacon bits - and it turned out so much better!

I've made this recipe three times, always doing as other suggested and using 1 cup of sour cream in place of a cup of the mayo and using O'Brien hashbrowns with onions and peppers.  This time, I used Velvetta Pepper Jack, which made it the best ever.  The pepper jack definitely added a nice touch.

Edited nine years later:  I've made these potatoes many times over the years.  This time, because of all the other foods we had, I had almost half left over.  I turned that into a delicious loaded potato soup.  Just sauteed some chopped onion and celery in a bit of butter.   Added the remaining potato casserole and enough chicken broth to cover it.  Simmered it until the casserole had broken down and was incorporated into the liquid mixture.  Added a bit more broth and some milk.  Turned into a delicious soup.  I may never make potato soup from scratch again.

THE CHEESY POTOTATO CASSEROLE IS AWESOME! If there was a category for 6 stars, this would be in it!   It's so easy to make. It's a super side side dish -- we had it with ham and it went perfectly!  DELICIOUS!

These were good, just nothing really spectacular. I found it to be a bit too much mayo for our taste.  They needed something to "spice" them up, next time I'll try to think of something.

This casserole got rave reviews for Christmas! I actually substituted cream of chicken soup and sour cream for the mayo and everyone loved the chicken/bacon/potato flavor combination. It's much easier to use shredded cheddar cheese, too. I will definitely be making this again, thanks!

Just tried this recipe tonight.  Had made other potatoe recipes in the past, but this one is a keeper.  I did, however, change a couple of things...due to not having some of the ingredients on hand.  Instead of the 2 cups of mayo, I used 8 ounces of fat free cream cheese and 8 ounces of fat free sour cream.  The casserole turned out wonderful!  My husband said it was much better than the ones I've made in the past.

This was absolutely delicious!  And fairly easy to make.  I too have tried several cheesy potato recipes, and this one will be added to my permanent recipe file.  Great recipe!  Can't say enough about it.  I was just munching on the cold leftovers if that tells you anything! LOL.

Changed the recipe for my dairy-free family.  Tried dairy-free sour cream and regular mayo.  Next time will do all mayo.  Added bacon and green onions in the mixture and on top.  Definitely cook full hour at 400 degrees.  Tried to cook longer and lower since sharing the oven with other casseroles--no go.  Nice top.  Good flavor.  Used Country Hash Browns.

I get nothing but rave reviews when I make this dish, my family loves it. I substituted shredded cheddar cheese instead of the processed cheese and onion powder instead of the chopped onion with great results!

This recipe was ok.... I am not a mayo fan unless it's on a burger so I took the advice of other's and only used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream, had you used another cup of either, it would have been too much. I also used shredded cheddar cheese instead of the processed cheese and real bacon crumbled up. I would probably make this again but it needs to be spiced up with a little salt and pepper, maybe a little garlic and onion powder.

I love this recipe!!!  I made it once to try at home before taking it a potluck dinner and loved it!  I used the 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 mayo suggestion and mixed 1/2 the bacon bits in with the other ingredients, topped it with the rest and a crushed cornflakes/melted butter combo.  The night I made it for the potluck, my Velveeta clumped and scorched in the microwave, so I had to take some of it out.  I threw in some shredded cheddar to make up for it, and it tasted better than before!  It got LOTS of compliments and I will definitely make again, and probably continue to add about 1/2 cup shredded cheddar to the mix!  Awesome recipe!!!

Recipe turned out great, but too much of a mayo taste for me. Next time I'll substitute lite sour cream for the mayo.

Wow! My husband and I LOVE this recipe. We make it often and is just as yummy the next day. It is a big hit whenever we serve it for people. I don't like onions so I leave those out. I always use velveeta cheese. Also it is so easy to make.

I used 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream.  Recipe was good but maybe a little dry.  Unfortunately, I overcooked it (we were out on the deck and I didn't hear the timer go off), so it was slightly overdone.  That's probably why it was a little dry.  I will try it again and pay more attention next time.

I think it a crowd pleaser if you like bland food-very boring in taste. I won't make it again but I would offer the suggestion of using onion that is sauteed first, using sharp cheddar or pepperjack cheese and adding perhaps some diced green chile's to give it a little extra somethin-somethin. But if you like your flavors plain-this is for you

I used 3/4 cup of mayo and 3/4 cup sour cream instead of 2 cups mayo as one reviewer suggested.  I also topped with shredded cheddar cheese during the last 10 minutes of cooking time as a reviewer suggested.  Very good!

I made this recipe in a hurry, so I increased the oven temp to 400 and cooked it for just over a half hour.  Not sure if it turned out with the expected consistency, I thought it was a little wet.  However, I brought it to a dinner party and every inch was scraped out of the dish by the rest of the guests.  Definitely a crowd pleaser, but it's very unhealthy!!  I also used 1 cup of sour cream instead of mayo.

Awesome & simple!! I used the sour cream & mayo combination. The store was out of ham so I chopped up a smoked pork butt. I also used the Ore Ida O'Brien hash brown frozen potatoes and put the bacon bits on top. I raised the temperature to 375 because the hash browns were frozen. Took this to a potluck and it was a hit!

This is SOOOO good. I did make a slight change on the onion though. The first time I made this I used 1/2 the onion, and I still thought it was WAY too onioney, so they second time I used about 1/3 of a 1/2 section, and it was perfect. I also made a crunchy crust using crushed corn flakes topped with a little bit of drizzled butter.

this was so good! i took it to a bbq and it was all gone very quickly! i took other's advice and took out some of the mayo (actually used miracle whip) and added sour cream. i used the diced potatoes and real bacon. i sauteed the onion in the bacon pan with a few cloves of garlic as well. i also added in some diced roasted red pepper. mmm! so good!

I've made this recipe 3-4 times now with all kinds of variances on which hashbrowns to use... although we have enjoyed it every which way, our favorite is with half regular hashbrowns and half o'brien...  a huge hit at our holiday gatherings, but simple enough for those sunday dinners!

This dish was very good......we made it for New Years dinner. The only change I made was that I added a package of real bacon to the mixture then put it into the pan then added a sprinkle of bacon to the top......it would be great for a breakfast dish with some eggs. I will make this again

First time making a hash brown casserole...I served this casserole at my son's birthday brunch yesterday along with Apple Raisin French Toast Casserole from this site.  Both were a big hit and devoured completely!  My mother-in-law was raving about this one.  I used all light ingredients - Light Velveeta, Light Sour Cream (in place of 1 cup of mayo), and Light Mayo.  You couldn't even tell the difference.  I also omitted the bacon completely (if I had used it, I would have used real bacon) and instead, added about half a large can of French Fried onions on top when there was 15 min. of cooking time left.  GREAT FLAVOR!!  This will be in my recipe box for years!!  Thanks!!

I always prepare this recipe for pot lucks!  It's easy to make.  People will definitely ask you for the recipe.

I used this recipe for 2 dinner parties.  It was great because you can mix everything up in advance and throw it in the oven when you are ready to cook.  Almost everyone asked me for the recipe.  I had one guest call me the next night for the recipe because she wanted it again.  I used Velveeta Light to try and save a few fat and calories and it was awesome.

This was good.  I used Velveeta cheese, 1 cup mayo, 1 cup sour cream, southern style potatoes, and a 2 oz of real bacon bits mixed in and 1 oz of bacon sprinked on top.  Instead of baking in the open, I put it in the crock pot on low for several hours.  (I had to bring to a dinner right after work; no oven at my work place.)  I couldn't get the cheese to melt in the microwave smoothly without burning  the sides-so had some clumps.  But that was ok, it all melted in the crock pot.  People at the dinner seemed to enjoy it.  I thought it was little bit too cheesy but still very good.  Thanks for the recipe.

Puuuuuure comfort food! This was amazingly good. Don't skimp on the onion if you make this, because it adds a lot to it. I used half mayo, half sour cream, and this dish got raves at a family gathering. I've experimented several times with this, sometimes using chopped ham instead of bacon or baking cocktail weiners into it. Yummy any way you make it.

This dish is awesome!!! I don't consider myself that much of a chef, but I recently threw my husband a surprise party for his 30th birthday and wanted to make a common dish I thought everyone would eat, so I decided on this one. I am very glad I did. I used Velveeta cheese (A MUST), I used all sour cream, no mayo. Put half the Hormel real bacon bits in mixture and the rest on top. I also used the O'Brien hashbrowns with peppers and onions already in them and added fully cooked cubed ham. Everyone and I mean everyone at the party was complimenting me on the dish and could not get enough. My mother in law even asked me to make it whenever we go to her house for the holidays. She makes great cheesy potatoes, but not like this one. I came up with a new name for the way I made it. I call it Ham and Cheese Potato Caserole. Try it...You won't be disappointed!!!

We loved this recipe.  I have made it two times.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was great.  Just out of curiosity, I made it with one cup mayo and one cup sour cream to see if it would be good also.  It was just as good.  I served it with a pork tenderloin but I also think it would be good in the summertime with grilled hamburgers.

Very delicious! My family loved these potatoes and I love how quick and easy they were to put together. Always use velveeta cheese and hormel real bacon bits. You can't go wrong!

Great recipe, only thing is, with all of that mayo, it sort of tastes like hot potato salad, so I would recommend using sour cream instead.  I made this yesterday for a party & I added cubed ham to it & everyone loved it!  I also used potatoes O'Brien with onions & peppers already in it, so it was very easy.  I think next time I'll try cheddar cheese & see how that turns out.  Overall, a great dish!

Good and cheesy.  I used regular cheddar rather than processed and I added fresh chopped chives over the onion...it gave color and the onion flavor!

My family really enjoyed this dish. I made half the amount, making my own personal adjustments (part mayo, sour cream and a bit more cheese).  My kids weren't thrilled about it, but at least ate it.  They love french fries with cheese and bacon, so I expected them to dive in on these.  It is a tasty variation and I really enjoyed it, and my hubby did too.  Nice change for a potato dish.

This casserole was really good, but also VERY rich. Definitely meant to be a side dish rather than served as a main course.

I made this for our Easter dinner and it was a real hit.  I did follow the suggestion to use 1/2 Miracle Whip and 1/2 sour cream.  Also added the corn flakes.  Perfect side dish that everyone enjoyed.

This was a decent basic recipe, but needed some help. First of all, I think melting the cheese in a pot on the stove might actually be easier because you can watch the melting process closer. I didn't like doing it in the microwave. I did a whole smallish yellow onions chopped very finely cuz I don't like crunchy onion in casseroles. I also used light mayo (no sacrifice on flavor). I added about a tsp of granulated garlic and wish that I had added a tsp each of pepper and salt cuz it needed it. It also needed some milk in that mixture cuz once it was cooked it got pretty stiff and wasn't as nice to dish out as some other potato casseroles I've made. I also think crushed corn flakes on top would have been nice... Overall it is a decent recipe, just not sure if I'll replace my regular party potatoes with this one....

Awesome.  Tasted great.  I've had many variations of this kind of recipe, but this was quick, easy, and requested again.  I did follow some recommendation given by others...  I did add about 1/4 cup of sour cream to the mixture, and I also added some of the bacon bits to the center.  It turned out really well, and couldn't have been easier to make.

Good - and a nice change.  Easily lightened up:  2% Milk Velveeta, 1 cp Light Mayo, 1 cp FF Sour Cream.  You'll want to sautee the onion (I also added green & red pepper). I also added a bit more cheese to the top (sharp cheddar), but it really didn't need anymore cheese.

YUM! I did make a couple changes. I used fresh potatoes and diced them, sauteed some green & red pepper and onion, added that to mix, added a lb cooked lean hamburger, used the mexican velveeta & used one cup fat free sour cream in place of mayo. Used light mayo for the other cup......
I am sure it is great as written, but I wanted to reduce calories AND make it a one dish meal. Served it a garden salad

Great recipe!  Realized at the last minute I'd left my mayo at the lake, so I subbed 1/2 Miracle Whip (actually just the Aldi brand) & 1/2 sour cream).  I'll try the mayo next time, but I don't know that it could get much better.  I did sprinkle some plain bread crumbs over the top of the bacon bits & then sprayed it with spray butter.  It gave it a nice little crunch.

Its okay, but I didn't even use all the mayo(I did use miricale whip I was out of reg mayo)and could taste it. Its tasted like twice baked potatos and I wonder what a package of ranch dressinng mix would taste like mixed in with the mayo first wasn't bad though.

We fixed this as a side for ham on Christmas day and loved it. I omitted the onion because one family member doesn'tlike it and it was still delicious.

This was a convenient recipe for me because I had no soup to make my normal Hash Brown Casserole II from this site. I added about 1/2 lb ground beef, browned with 1/2 diced red pepper, minced garlic clove, a can of diced green chiles, and I used 1/2 cup mayo plus 1 cup sour cream; I also used 1/2 chopped green onion. It was a tasty recipe, but I will go back to my usual.

Yuck! Much too heavy tasting! Maybe if I would've modified the recipe as suggested in several reviews I would've had better luck. Too much mayo in this recipe!

So easy and so good! I used half mayo and half sour cream as others suggested and sprinkled fried bacon on top.  Took it to a potluck and it was devoured!

OY!!  This is great! I followed other advice and used half mayo and half sour cream.  I also cut the velveeta down a wee bit and added colby cheese.  I added some smoked sausage to it, to give me some meat with my work lunch.  It was great that way.  Without it though, it's still wonderful cheesy potatos!!!  I think I know what I'm taking to the next pot luck ;-D

Pretty yummy and very easy on one of those rushed weeknights. A big hit with the teenagers and the husband. The only different thing I did was put a little cheddar cheese on top for the last 10 minutes or so. I will be adding this to my permanent recipe book.

Was very good and an easy recipe but we were not happy with the bacon bits.We will definitely try this again but we are thinking maybe french fried onions or perhaps crunched up potatoe chips.

This recipe is a fantastic staple!  It's going in the permanent recipe book at home.  I doubled the recipe (using half sour cream and half miracle whip light, as suggested by other reviews) and it came out great.  Thanks Annette!

i was so dissapointed w/ this recipe.  I was trying to get away from making the usual mashed potatoes for the holiday but this wasn't a good choice.  the potatoes were mushy, the mayo overpower the cheese taste.  This will not do.

A perfect addition to Christmas morning brunch.  I used 1 cup mayonnaise and 1 cup sour cream and sauteed the onion. Quick and easy to put together the night before baking. So much better than recipes that use canned cream soup. This is a keeper.

This works well in a crockpot too with the dehydrated hash browns.  This is my all-time go to recipe for cheesy potatoes.  It’s so much simpler than others with so few ingredients.  I use the fresh bacon bits from Sams club ??

This was a big hit in my house!   I sauteed the onion before adding it.   I used 1 1/2C mayo and 1/2C sout cream.  I used a bag of shredded hashbrowns because that is what I had. Easy to make and nice flavor.

A friend's son is graduating, she asked how to make really good cheesy potatoes so I turned to AllRecipes, I had given my recipe to my sister.  I used Velveeta Cheese.  They were delicious and they also reheat very nicely in the oven at  300 degrees.  Out of all the recipes on AllRecipes.com I looked at I feel, while it might be a little more expensive by using Velveeta Cheese, these would be the easiest to pull together when hosting a party.

We made these potatoes for this year's Thanksgiving dinner and everyone enjoyed them.  We did however; make a significant change.  We used the specified amount of Velveeta, mayonnaise, onions and bacon bits but added this to 4lbs of hash browns instead of 2lbs.  They were very cheesy and rich with double the amount of potatoes. We will make these again using our method.

I made a few changes and additions. I used gold potatoes. I made a mixture of mayo, ranch dressing and cream cheese. Along with a three shredded cheese mix of sharp cheddar, Mexican, and Colby and Monterey Jack.  There was less then half of each cheese in our freezer so I just went with it. Cooked up real bacon.  Boiled the potatoes for 20 minutes. Layered (cubed) potatoes, mayo mix, onion, bacon and cheese mix until I filled the 9 by 13 pan. Baked as shown.  So good!

Wonderful!   Was very skeptical it would be greasy with all that mayonnaise but it wasn't!!   I topped mine with crushed Rusk toasts (it's a Dutch thing) mixed with butter.  I did not add the bacon but will if it goes along with my main dish.    This is my new fave cheesy potatoes recipe!!!   So so easy!  Thank you!!!

My husband love it, I thought it was good but not really what I was going for.  I didn't put the bacon on top I just put it all in the casserole.  I will probably make it again because he loved it so much but might try to change it up a bit!

Very easy to make and tasted awesome.  I didn't have frozen potatoes on hand I just pealed and sliced regular potatoes. (My only issue was the 3 ounces of bacon bits; I purchase in bulk so I weighed it out and there were way too many and I put like 1/2 back but it's a bakers choice on that as it's a topper.)  Definite hit!

We LOVED this recipe! It is supper easy and I made the sauce the day before and had my husband add the hashbrowns and bake it. I sort of followed the directions. I added 1 lb. of ground pork to the recipe, because we wanted to have it as a meal instead of just a side dish. Also, instead of the 2 cups of mayo I did as suggested by others and added 1 cup of mayo and 1 cup of sour cream. It came out wonderful! This will definetly be a keeper and go into the regular rounds!

YUMMY!  I made this for a family dinner and it was gone in no time.  I did follow some other reviewer's advice and substituted 1 cup sour cream for 1 cup of mayo.  (Did use real mayo instead of Miracle Whip)

Easy and awsome, everyone loves it.  I changed a few things and it was even better.  Use defrosted tater tots (mashed up) instead of hash brown potatoes.  Use (2) 16 oz. jars of cheese wiz instead of melted velveta.  Mix in 3oz and 2oz bacon bits into mixture.

I didn't have any hash browns so I diced up some potatoes.  I cooked it at 350 for 1 hour and it came out perfect.  I used the mayo/sour cream combo and added some garlic and cayenne because we like things a little spicier.  Has a fantastic taste and I will definitely use this recipe again.

This was a good quick dish. However, I guess I'm just not a huge fan of processed cheese so I would not rate it more than average.

I'm not so sure my rating should count.  I used light Miracle Whip for the mayo.  It was like eating spoonsful of Miracle Whip!  Do not use it unless you really really like it!

Very easy to make and delicious!!! Certainly not a health food but really good for special occasions.  I took other reviewers suggestions and used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream-it was delicious.  I thought my kids would go crazy over this but neither one seemed to care for it (they're 6 and 2 so who knows) but hubby and I loved it!

This is the best potato side dish I have ever had!  I used one cup of mayo and one cup of sour cream and it was perfect - much tastier than hashbrown recipes using condensed soups!

The first time I made this I didn't have the onions or the bacon.  It was very bland.  The next time I made it, I made sure I had the onion, and I fried up my own bacon bits.  I recently took some to work for a holiday luncheon.  They disappeared rather quickly.  This recipe is easy and definitely a keeper.

This is my new favorite recipe! I admit, I was a little afraid of using the Velveeta but this is great. I don't even like bacon but it is a must for this recipe. Very easy to make yet it is a bit sticky while mixing together. It is good re-heated too, we actually finished the leftovers. My kids loved it.

Yummy...I loved this recipes. I only had a 1 pound, 4 oz baf of Southwest Hashbrowns by Simply Potatoes, so I scaled down the ingredients to match. I did use some sour cream along with the mayo and by far, this is the best hasbrown casserole I have ever eaten. This will replace the old one. Thanx for a fantastic recipe

Delicious!  This casserole is the best potato casserole I've found and I will definately make it again.  Followed the directions just as stated and it turned out wonderful!  Used southern style hashbrowns & Velveeta cheese. Tastes very similar to a loaded baked potato.  Thanks for sharing!

A member of my family does not care for sour cream so I tried this one for a family dinner. It was a hit and the mayo gave it an added zing

I made this last night as a side dish.  It was just not what I expected.  I usually love this type of dish, but this was dry and bland tasting.  The bacon would have been better mixed in with the ingredients, and there was too much mayonaisse taste.  It also overbrowned during the alloted cooking time.  I would not make this recipe again, and I will continue to search for a good cheesy potato casserole recipe.

Really easy and great flavor. I also lightened this up by using low-fat mayo.... very yummy!
