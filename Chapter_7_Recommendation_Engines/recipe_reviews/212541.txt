Fantabulous!  Extremely pleased w/how this meal turned out. With a little prep-work, this comes together very quickly & easily. I'm on a budget & have 4 kids (all boys). I try my best to use about $5 worth of meat per meal. I used 2 package portions of chicken breast tenders from Costco (total 6 package portions in a pack, $2.49 lb. I think. Probalby 1 lb. per package portion.) I used 1 can of Chicken stock (not condensed) + 1C water, 3 T Corn starch, Olive oil, 20 oz can Pineapple chunks, 2/3 C. Sugar, 3/4 C Vinegar, and chopped up all of the following: 1 green pepper, 1 sm onion, 4 green onions, handful of carrots, handful mushrooms.  I did simmer the carrots in the stock, but now I don't think that was necessary.  **And here's what perfected the recipe...I added two handsful of lightly salted cashew halves and stirred in some soy sauce (to taste) at the end of the simmering time.  The cashews added just enough crunch and the soy sauce added the perfect saltiness to the tangy sweet sauce.  I think I used about 2-3 T of soy sauce. What a keeper recipe.  Next time I'll try the condensed stock (or add some stock granules to intensify the flavor).  Don't skip the cashews..or maybe try lightly salted almonds. 3, 5, 15 and 16 yr olds & hubby ate it up. Served with seasoned fresh hot rice (made with plain water, but stir fried uncooked rice first in some olive oil & butter.) Will post picture. Oh, I also added some minced garlic to the stir-frying chicken in the beginning.

I actually really enjoyed this and so did my husband who loves sweet and sour chicken.  I didn't have any white vinegar so I substituted apple cider vinegar.  I was afraid it was going to be too sweet but the flavors were nice.  My husband can't eat green peppers so I substituted yellow bell peppers.  I also threw in half of small onion, sliced and some sliced carrots(I enjoy lots of veges).  I agree with another review in that it wasn't very eye appealing.  I was looking for a way to add some color in so I threw in a Tbsp of black sesame seeds.  That did it! It also adds a nice crunch.  Next time I think I will try a red bell pepper for more color.  The contrast between the peppers and the sweet pineapple was very nice.  Overall, a great dish but it barely feeds 4 people.  If you want seconds or leftovers, double the recipe except the rice. Going to add it to my weekly recipes!

Wow, this was actually really great! I sauteed a couple cloves of garlic, a small onion, a handful of celery and a handful of carrots, then added chicken, cooked until brown, then added a large handful of fresh chopped pineapple and the sauce ingredients. My boyfriend is diabetic, so I used Splenda instead of sugar, and I didn't have cornstarch, so I used flour instead. I then added about a cup of frozen mixed bell peppers, a little salt, and a handful of peanuts, and served over brown rice. Very yummy!

We added lite soy sauce to it after it was finished cooking, as well as green onions and red pepper instead of green. I like red pepper with pineapple more than green and it adds more color! Adding these extras helped it get to a 5 stars for me. Very good!

This dish came out with great texture, and tasted good, but it was a little bland. We added some ginger and soy sauce, and then we loved it.

For speed, taste, and simplicity I have to give this five stars.  This may not be a gourmet nor terribly visually appealing recipe (mine did not look like pic as peppers loose their color and meat turns a bit milky looking), BUT  - - - the flavors were wonderful.  We served over rice and sprinkled crispy noodles on top - added a dash of Chinese hot sauce (we're spicy peoples lol).  Seconds all around.  Nice job and thank you.  Will certainly make again.

This was okay. It  needs flavor, it's bland. It was easy to make though and smelled good. The sauce was good over rice, but it lacks spices and onions, I think.

So amazing! Use soy sauce on the rice and eat up! I never seen my husband eat so fast! I'd recommend a little more chicken than 1lb.

This was a quick, easy, and delicious recipe; I'll definitely be making it again! Being a vegetarian I substituted cubed MorningStar chicken nuggets for the chicken breast and veggie bouillon in water in place of the chicken broth. I also cheated and used the "steam in the bag" microwave brown rice. The only changes I would make next time would be doubling the sauce and adding sesame seeds.

Followed the recipe, it isn't the traditional sweet and sour color since no ketchup is added.  It had a nice flavor.  Spicing it up a little would go well with the flavor.  I did add bell peppers to the dish to add extra color.  Served over steamed brown rice.

This dish was fabulous!  I did what one gal said, added carrots, onion, green onion , and 3 TBSPs of Soy Sauce.  After I browned the chicken, I drained the juice from pan and added 1/4 C butter to sautee vegetables for a few minutes because one post mentioned the milky look from chicken which happens sometimes and then added rest of ingredients.  Loved it and it looked beautiful too!

Marinated pieces of chicken thigh meat in teriyaki sauce before stir frying.  Added lots of colorful hot peppers from our garden along with the green peppers. Gave it just the right kick!

Ok basic recipe but more needs to be done to it and doesn't get 5 stars in my book.  Worth trying once but won't make again.

I add some cut up carrots and celery while cooking the chicken and then add green and red peppers as well as mushrooms.  It doesn't look the best as it looks milky but it is sooooo good!

I followed this recipe exactly. It was very easy and very good. Was hoping for leftovers for lunch, but no such luck. Next time Imay add some onion as suggested by another reviewer, this is a good basic recipe that you can change by adding other veggies for variety.

It was easy to make but wasn't like the sweet and sour chicken in restaurants which has a bit of a kick.  The sauce tasted a little strange with the bell peppers.  If I make it again, I might just do chicken and pineapples only.
