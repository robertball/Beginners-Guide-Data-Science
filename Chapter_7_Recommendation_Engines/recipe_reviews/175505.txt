Everyone loves this recipe! The only changes I make are that I use butter instead of shortening and I don't chop the cranberries. I love seeing the whole cranberry when the bread is sliced. I use walnuts, but I'm sure pecans would  be equally as good.

Very good! This is the recipe from the back of the Ocean Spray cranberries bag, and also the same as several other recipes on this site. When I took it out of the oven I immediately put aluminum foil over the top and left it in the pan for 15-20 mins, the steam helps to moisten the bread. I will make this again!

I've made this recipe twice.  Each time the bread was disappointingly dry & not very flavorful. But after adding some of your suggestions, I can now give this 5 Stars.  I used canola oil instead of shortening & increased the amount to 4 tablespoons.  Also increased cranberries to 2 cups & nuts to 1 cup.  Superb, moist, delicous!

Great loaf of bread!  I actually doubled the recipe and got 3 8x4" loafs...worked out perfectly!  Also omitted the orange peel and used fresh squeezed (w/pulp) juice...it was delicious!

This is my favorite Cranberry bread recipe except my recipe calls for 1/4 cup butter instead of the shortening.  I have also added 1 1/2 cups of light raisins along with the 1 1/2 cups of cranberries - delish and beautiful as well.  The original changes I found in a children's book called "Cranberry Thanksgiving" by Wende and Harry Devlin.

SO GOOD!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used butter instead of shortening.  Used walnuts, and would make it exactly the same way next time!  Very flavorful (and FULL of cranberries)!

I made this for Christmas. After baking, it looked a little pale so I made a simple  confectionery sugar/milk icing to put on top of the bread. It was fantastic. I think the icing gave it a little more sweetness which we liked. My husband raved about it. Thank you for such a great new Christmas tradition.

This recipe is the same one that has been handed down in our family for many generations. It is wonderful. Sometimes we add pecans instead of walnuts for a change.

I love this recipe!  It tasted so good I couldn't believe it.  The fresh chopped cranberries were delicious.  I didn't have orange juice, so I substituted cranberry juice, I used canola oil, I didn't add the nuts, and I cut the sugar down to 3/4 Cup.  It still was pretty sweet, so I might cut the sugar down to 1/2 Cup next time.  I'm definitely going to make this again and share this recipe with other people.

Wow!  To make this bread, I used the last of the cranberries I froze in January.  The bread is still warm from the oven and i couldn't wait for it to cool before trying it. And it is FABULOUS!  The only nuts i had on hand were macadamias...not what i would normally have chosen...but it is really a yummy combination!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good!! I used fresh cranberries...which seemed a little tart.  Perhaps, frozen cranberries would help... Also, I doubled the recipe EXACTLY ~worked out great....second loaf is in the freezer to be used on Thanksgiving.

This recipe is very simalar to my zucchini bread recipe.  Made as per recipe with fresh chopped cranberries and pecans.  Added all of one orange zest (which was a little more than recipe).  Squeezed orange into the proper 3/4 cup size and top off with orange juice to have the proper measurement instead of using another orange.  Greased with butter and floured loaf pan instead of spraying Pam. This made bread to come out very easy.  Family all loved it. Thanks for sharing!

I ended up with a decent product, but I wish I would have sifted all of the dry ingredients so it was a little lighter. I also wish I would have used butter instead of shortening.

I LOVE making this bread! I add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of raisins and up to 2 very ripe bananas! It makes the bread extra sweet and moist!

Everyone loved this.  Unfortunately I did not get to try any!  But I will be making this again with my leftover cranberries and will post a review.  I subbed oil and butter for the shortening and it baked up perfectly in 55 minutes.  I also added a little vanilla extract, a pinch of nutmeg and a tiny pinch of ginger.

this is a classic.  (every year my family makes it the night before thanksgiving, and we enjoy it when watching the parade on tv the next day and while preparing the turkey and sides.)  it has always been a huge hit with friends and family alike-- no one can eat just one piece!!

I found this same recipe several years ago, and absolutely fell in love with it. However, since I don't own any loaf pans I just make muffins with this recipe. They are delicious for breakfast or anytime.

I always giggle when I see these reviews and the cooks will say "it was a great recipe.....except I added blah blah blah". But I was craving cranberry bread and didn't have orange juice so I used buttermilk and a bit of tangerine zest. Wow - what a great recipe! ha ha. Enjoy!

As close to the amazing cranberry nut bread you can get at Whole Foods.  YUM!!!  Add more walnuts or cranberries depending on how you like it!

Really a moist and delicious bread,  the orange juice makes it nicely tangy and it's not too sweet.  A family favorite.

Absolutely delicious.  My modifications are: 1/2 the sugar,  I added more nuts I forgot the salt.  I substituted 1/2 cup orange juice concentrate with enough water for 3/4 cup.    Cranberries mixed in whole.  Yum!
