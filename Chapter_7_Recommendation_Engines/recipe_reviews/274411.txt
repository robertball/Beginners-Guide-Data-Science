This is THE true recipe for Cacio e Pepe. No garlic, no frozen peas, no bacon: just the pasta, cheese and pepper. This was a regular Friday evening dish growing up. It is still a favorite because it is delicious and very inexpensive. Thanks for your submission of an authentic Italian recipe. Close your eyes and you're in Rome.

I've made this recipe a dozen or more times and it's so quick and delicious to make! In fact, I just made a little bit for my lunch today using GF spaghetti (can't get GF bucatini pasta). I did have problems getting the technique down the first few times I made it as the cheese was just glumping up on me instead of being more like a cream (still delicious with the little glumps of cheese here and there). After some time and much trial and error I have it down pat to the way it's written. If you find it tricky making this, try adding a little pasta water to bottom of dish first, then add your pasta, and put the finely grated pecorino romano on top and stir with a fork, adding a little more of the pasta water as needed. Delicious and a favorite quick meal in our house to this day! Thank you for the recipe and for all the help you gave us in making this recipe successfully BQ, to Bikerfamily for making this recipe in which we otherwise would not have discovered it before publication, and to DIZ for sharing in our crazy 'must master Cacio e Pepe' adventure!  :-)

Bucatini is such a fun pasta to work with, in recipes - I love it.  This is a simple dish that has a lot of flavor!  Don't leave out the "freshly ground" pepper.  It needs to be freshly ground b/c it adds such a nice depth of flavor to the cream sauce.  
Don't use table pepper or restaurant pepper - "freshly ground" - lol.  :-)  Trust me, it makes a difference.
Awesome recipe - thank you for sharing with us!

This is a personal favourite. I learned out to make it when Anthony Bourdain said it was one of his favourites, and now I make it all the time because it's easy and everyone likes it.

DO NOT. I repeat; do not add as much pepper to the pasta as the recipe calls for. Or your lips will burn off. Otherwise quite tasty and filling.
