This were sooooo good especially for being gluten free and vegan. The best cookie recipe I've made.

This turned out far better than I expected, with a good amount of flavor! I omitted the maple syrup, and added almond milk (unsweetened vanilla) to help the mix take on a better texture before cooking. The biggest surprise? My kids LOVED mommyâ€™s healthy cookies (and we have Girl Scout cookies in the house)! Definitely will make again!

It was good. I needed to add milk though because it was to dry to put together. Might not make it again but it is a good treat.
