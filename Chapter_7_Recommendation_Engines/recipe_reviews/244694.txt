Made this for a pre-workout drink.  I didn't have frozen mango so I used fresh thus needed to add ice. I should have added more ice.  I prefer these type of drinks very cold.  Used unsweetened almond milk instead of whole milk and added chia seeds to help fill up the void in my stomach pre-workout.  The recipe says it is one serving, but I think it is more like 2 servings.  Makes a large amount!! I will make it again!
