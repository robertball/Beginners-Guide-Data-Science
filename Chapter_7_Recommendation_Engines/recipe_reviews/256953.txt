Excellent recipe and easy to make. Used sausage instead of ham and a little bit of pepper jack cheese. Had to bake longer than 20 minutes , it was closer to 30 but could be my oven. Easy breakfast on the go!

Definitely need to bake at least 30minutes to 35.  Do not put in paper as this is more of a quiche.  I cubed and cooked the grease and water out of the ham
