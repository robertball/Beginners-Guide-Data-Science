Light and refreshing.  Great as a side for any meal.  Fantastic during peak citrus season.

I left the walnuts out ... it doesn't need them. The citrus alone, with the added kick of lime and honey (I used less honey than called for, and it was certainly sweet enough!), is more than enough! Very refreshing, simply delicious! One interesting addition might be pomegranate seeds .... maybe next time!

This salad was perfect for brunch.  The night before, I cut the oranges and grapefruit into bite-size pieces, added some clementines, tossed in some dried cranberries for a little extra color.   In the morning, I toasted the walnuts, and added the honey and fresh sqeezed lime.juice.  Next time, I may add bananas ??.

I used a lemon instead of a lime, as that what I had on hand. I also used  less honey.  It was refreshing and tasty.

I had a great deal of citrus fruit to use up, and looked up recipes. I found this one and thought I would try it. I used what was on hand, oranges, a pink grapefruit, and the lime. I did not have tangerines, but had mandarin oranges. I put that all together and added the honey and nuts. I liked the crunch the nuts added. I also added coconut flakes. I think this turned out to be a great dish. Was glad to be able to use the fruits! I would make it again.
