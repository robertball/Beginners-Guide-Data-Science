Made it for my family and my dad had 4 helpings! Instead of just putting 1 T of soy sauce over the beef strips, I marinated them in 1/2 C soy, plus the garlic and cornstarch. Then before I stir-fried it, I strained off most of the excess soy sauce. Worked fine, but I did have to add a little extra cornstarch at the end to get the sauce to thicken. This is definitely a keeper, thanks for the recipe!

Very good, but i did have to adjust some things, based on prevous reviews. I tripled the sauce and added some ginger (1tsp.) and chilipowder (1/2 tsp) to it. I also added some mushrooms, but that's cause i just had some left. One thing i really missed in the marinade was some ketjap manis (indonesian, very sugary type of soy sauce) for extra flavour, so i added 2 tablespoons. I also reduced the red peper.  
Overal it came out awesome served with some plain white rice. But there was lotsa preperation and it would have been bland and way too hot (just peper flavour) without the adjustments.

Fabulous! I added more red pepper, only because we like spicey - I also added honey to even out the saltiness of the soy sauce. Ginger, garlic and sesame oil compliment well, too.

This recipe is the first time I made Mongolian Beef.  My advice is to cut up everything before you start to cook because there is alot to chop up.  The recipe is pretty spicy, so have cold drinks on hand!

This was a very tasty and easy recipe.  I recommend slicing the round steak very thin or you will have to cook it a little longer than indicated.  I used fresh sliced mushrooms (my husband requested them) and more carrots and green onions than listed.

Although this doesn't taste like the traditional "Mongolian Beef" dish, it is delicious!! People- do NOT make changes to this dish, I promise it's great as is! It's a 5 star dish in my opinion. And I will definitely be making it again.
Word of warning though- it does make a lot of dishes :)

My husband who is not a beef fan LOVED this dish!!!  I added snow peas and bean sprouts(because we love them) to the final dish and for some more spice I added a few quirts of SRIRACHA HOT CHILI SAUCE(normally found at Thai restaurants, yet you can purchase in the Asian food section at the grocery store.) I served it all atop of Lo Mein noodles.  YUMMY!
P.S. Made this again but used Low Sodium Soy Sauce...bad, bad move..better for you, just not as good as the regular soy sauce.

Everyone thought this was excellent.  Think I will double the sauce part next time..like more juice for our noodles!  Great blend of flavors..we like spicy food and this could have been spicier.

Very quick, easy, and tasty dish. We left off the red pepper flakes because we do not like spicy dishes and it was still very flavorful. Our five year old even loved it. Thanks for the recipe! We'll definitely make this again.

Yummy! And very easy, but don't expect it to taste like the mongolian beef you would get in a Chinese restaurant.

This wasn't quite the mongolian beef I was looking for, however, it was a very tasty recipe. I will keep looking for the "one" but this one will be a standby until I find that one.

Not bad!  Definitely easy and quick to make for those nights when you don't feel like driving to pick up your chinese food.  This will be a good side dish for when we make eggrolls.

I thought this was a good recipe, but I will make some changes to it next time. I did take some of the reviewers tip on either doubling or tripling the sauce which I doubled. Next time I will omit the cornstarch in which the meat is marinated it. It made the beef too creamy for my taste.

Good, but tastes nothing like Mongolian beef from a Chinese restaurant. Tastes a little boring as written but easy enough for a fast weeknight dinner. That's why I gave it 3 stars. Probably won't make again however.

This recipe is fantastic!  I followed suggestions from others and marinated the beef for a couple hours.  I also added brown sugar, ginger, and chili powder to the marinade.  

I doubled the sauce recipe, but not the hot pepper flakes.  

This was just so yummy!  We loved it.  This recipe is a keeper.

Excellent for a pepper belly!  I made mine with my own peppers that I had dried, and found it gave a nice "hello"; my wife thought it was a little too spicy, but, just cut back a bit on the peppers for the lightweights, and it's an excellent dish over rice or noodles.

This is what was for dinner tonight and it was DELISH! I did make a little more of the sauce since I wanted more to wet my rice :) The flavor was wonderful! I did add chili powder since I like my food more on the spicy side, and it was even better! This dish turned out better than any restaurant!

Very quick, but needed more taste. I only used 1/2 tsp of pepper flakes and the kids were good with it.  But it lacked flavor.

Tasty.  I had 1.32 lbs of steak so I upped the soy sauce to 4 tablespoons.  I had plenty of "gravy" for rice.  Also, I didn't have carrots so I used a large green bell pepper thinly sliced and doing so reminded me of pepper steak.  Easy, fairly quick, affordable, and good leftovers for the next day.

This was a great recipe.  HOWEVER, lol to anyone that is reading this I wouldn't recommend using a teaspoon of the red pepper it is way too spicy.  Use only a dash of red pepper.   I did do some subsitutions  I used the frozen sugar snap peas stir fry and 1 teaspoon of ginger. There were leftovers only b/c this was spicy with the tsp of red pepper.  If you want this to be a spicy dish DEFINITELY use a tsp of red pepper.  Other than that it was very delicious!!

I made this recipe with shrimp but left everything else the same. It was good and had a nice kick to it. But I didn't feel as if there was enough "body" behind the hot pepper taste. I much prefer the sauce from the Szechuan Shrimp recipe also on this site.

Okay, but DON'T use lite soy sauce, it needed salt!  Also, triple or even quadruple the sauce part to make enough for the rice.  I still think it needed "something" but can't quite put my finger on it.  Slice the meat really really thin or it will take a while to cook.  Like another said, chop everything beforehand, it takes a while.  Next time I think I'll skip the cornstarch on the meat and just keep the soy sauce marinade (increase) and only use the cornstarch in the sauce part.  I'll try it again, but change some things.

Loved it.  Didn't have any sesame seeds, probably would have been even better.  I did add 1/2 small cabbage with the carrots, thinly sliced (like lotsa veggies.)  I recommend it, not too difficult--but I agree, chop ahead of time.

I added a tiny bit of grated ginger to the marinade the second time I made it and liked it better.

As is this recipe is pretty bland so I added ginger and more soy sauce and some red and orange peppers and it taste. You do have to cook the beef more than 1 minute. I had to put the lid on the skillet after i poured the sauce in so that the steam could cook the beef because it was still pretty raw after 1 minute. Overall it was a good base recipe. Thank you!

This recipe is kicka$$!  I added a few more veggies and bumped the sauce (you may want to as well). I have made it twice within a week. My husband and his cousin fought over the last little bit that was supposed to be our daughters. I don't think she has been able to try it yet... LOL  You certainly want to have everything ready to go at the same time! get yer choppin and saucin done then go for it!

OMG!!!!It was great! My husband and I went to the mongolian grill 2 days in a row. That didn't even compare. This is great. I did change a few things....I put marinaded the beef in 1/2 cup soy sauce instead of 1 tbsp and I put in a bag of the mixed veggies that the family enjoys. I also added a red onion. Both my kids and my husband came back for more.

This was very good, but way to spicy for my little ones, and they enjoy a bit of heat.  A little too spicy for me too, but my husband loved it.

I personally loved this recipe... and it was easy too!  I added thin sliced red bell peppers to the mix and next time I will add snow peas!  I doubled this recipe and served over long grain and wild rices with steamed broccoli.  You could use anything though. I did make it a bit too hot as I added a little (lot) too much red pepper.  VERY GOOD though, will absolutely make it again. Maybe next time try out some others suggestions for fun!

This is very tasty, however there is absolutely nothing 'mongolian' about it.  Adding soy sauce and sesame seeds to a stirfry doesn't make it Asian or exotic...that said, it is a good, American meal.

This is the first time that I ever reviewed a recipe. I have made a lot of dishes from this website and I must say this is one of the best ones. I used a sirloin steak and it was very tender. It is so tasty and garlicky and my husband and I just loved it. I served it with buttered brown rice with fresh minced parsley and a salad.

This turned out unsuspectingly good for the relatively simple list of ingredients! Reminded me of my favorite local Chinese restaurant's version of Mongoloan Beef, although I think mine was better since it didn't have as much cornstarch in the sauce, and was less jelly-like! If I were to make this again, I would add some sauteed peanuts into the mix, maybe some sambal olek (to really spice it up!) info the sauce fpr a taste more like the restaurant's.

This was GREAT!  My picky eaters (husband, 9 y/o, and 11 y/o) loved it.  While the kids were shoveling it in their mouth, they were asking me to  make it for dinner the next night.  I halved the pepper flakes and it was just the right heat for us.  I added broccoli.  This is a yummy way to get my kids to eat their veggies.  Thanks for sharing!

This is in essence a great recipe. I took out some of the soy sauce, and added 1/2 teaspoon of beef boullion. I also added sliced celery, used shredded carrots, and 6 oz. sliced mushrooms. Turned out FANTASTIC!! Thanks

Not bad but not a real keeper either. And definitely not an authentic mongolian beef! The dish lacks flavour (SO asked for bottled curry sauce to put on it!) and it could definitely use more veggies (like snow peas or brocoli). However, with a few tweaks, this could become a nice weeknight stir-fry.

This is a great recipe I made a few small changes. I used about 1/2 teaspoon of Chinese five spice powder, a half of a bag of matchstick carrots and two stalks of celery. ( I love carrots, garlic , onion and celery mixed together). My family really loved this dish I will be making this one again.

The first time we had this, it was rather bland.  Marinading the meat overnight rather than for a piddly 10 minutes makes it much, much better.

This was surprisingly good and very easy.  We really enjoyed it, even though it may not be the most authentic recipe.  I was more generous with the crushed red pepper than the recipe states.  Next time however, I will add more garlic and some fresh grated ginger as well as either double the green onions or add a vegetable (I think sugar snap peas or broccoli).  All in all, a solid recipe that will be going into my regular rotation.

We liked this a lot.  I used mule deer and it turned out great.  I was out of red pepper flakes so I substituted a few shakes of cayenne and it worked fine.  It is a super quick meal (don't quite get all the people saying it's a lot of chopping).  I served it with rice and we were waiting on the rice to finish cooking. The kids loved it too so I will be keeping this recipe.

Sauce didn't have such a great flavor.  Was edible but probably won't make again for my picky husband. Was easy and quick, though.

This was a great recipe.  Going to make more sauce next time per my wife's request but otherwise this was amazing.  For less spicy version I suppose you could cut down on the red pepper and up the sugar just a bit.

Wonderful recipe but I made a few changes, skip the carrots and add another bunch of green onions.  Skip the pepper flakes and add 1 tbs of minced ginger and 1 tbs of sesame oil.  Yum yum yum, I'll never but takeout again!

This was very tasty. I let the meat marinade in water, soy sauce and garlic w/o the cornstarch for a bit longer than 10 minutes. I added some Sriracha to the marinade as well as after it was done cooking to spice it up some more. Keeper status!

I really liked this!! I didn't add red pepper flakes because my kids were eating this! I didn't have green onion so I just diced up some white onion and added it with the carrots. Served with rice and a mix of broccoli, carrots and snap peas. Easy dinner.

This was really good! I doubled the sauce as some recommended and added a lot more veggies. It does have quite a kick as others said. I also added a bit of honey as i knew my friend is sensitive to spicy/hot dishes. Unless you love hot dishes, I recommend doubling everything in the sauce except the pepper. That said, the flavor was good and I would definitely make this again!

Easy to prepare, but a little spicy for my taste as well as for my youngest son. My husband and eldest son loved it, but of course they love spicy food.  Will make again but may tone down on the spices and let my husband and son add their own.

DELICIOUS! I agree with previous notes...you've gotta double or triple the sauces.  I used toasted sesame seed oil instead of vegetable oil and brown sugar instead of white.  I also added lots of ginger and a little bit of garlic to the mix (not too much because you don't want it to compete with the ginger). Great flavor combination.

I loved this recipe!  With just a few tweaks (used low sodium/fat beef broth in place of water and added in snow pea pods) this will definitely be added to the rotation.  It's a fairly simple dish as it is...but purchasing pre-cut meat (labled as being for stroganoff) and pre-shredded carrot (awesome!) made it too simple for words.

I changed up the marinade for the meat a little bit, but it was really good served over fried rice. I added some mustard, pomegranate juice, low sodium soy sauce...lots of it and extra garlic. My Husband loved it. I will make this again.

This was good but not a favorite of mine.  I did add some ginger as others suggested and it bought out the taste a bit.  I also used stew meat and frozen veggies.  I probably would've given four stars if I made more sauce then what the recipe called for.

I made this the other night for my husband and father and they loved it! I doubled the sauce and served it over those crispy noodles that you fry up (I can't remember their name) and I also added water chestnuts and baby corn. Served with homemade fried rice. Will definately make again and add a little more garlic and pound the steak a little thinner. Great recipe!

This tasted GREAT..That is for what little portion I got to eat.  My three teenagers ate this up before I knew it.  I didn't add the red pepper flakes because we are all extreme wimps around here.  It did take a bit of time to prepare, but worth it.  Next time I will add a few veggies to stretch the portions.  I've had several requests to make it again soon!

A very tasty dish and one I'll make again.  I added a few sliced mushrooms and some green bell pepper and doubled the sauce.  Next time I will cut back a bit on the red pepper flakes.  A keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good + spicy.  I wouldn't add as many peppers next time, although my 2 year old still ate it!  I also used a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies with it.

Eh.  Stir-fried beef with a little kick is always okay and this dish was
nothing more.  Basically what you'd get in a mediocre americanized Chinese
restaurant. The odd brown gravy slightly bothered me, and I felt this
recipe missed something about mongolian beef, but it might simply be that
it wasn't spicy enough.

I let the meat sit in the sauce for just over an hour in the fridge, and used garlic powder instead of fresh. My green onions were already pre-cut into small slices, and I used 3 carrots since mine were sort of small. Otherwise, I kept everything the same and we ate it over white rice, as suggested. We ended up wishing I had made more!

I did not care for this. My husband liked it though. I felt that it was missing something. It didn't have enough flavor for me - even after adding Chinese Five Spice powder to it. The only modifications I made was omitting the sesame seeds, used low-sodium soy sauce, and added water chestnuts. Probably won't make again.

I did not understand what the fuss it about.  I followed the recipe exactly and my husband and I found this recipe very bland.  I will not be making this recipe again.

I tried this last night...I doubled the sauce as advised, but would cut back a little on the pepper flakes...it was a little too spicy for my husband.  Great served over rice...I added fresh mushrooms.

I made this for my husband who always orders this at Chinese restaurants. I doubled the sauce, served over rice and omitted the sesame seeds. My husband was doubtful and thought this would be a knockoff of the restaurant version. Once he tried it, he could not stop saying how exactly like the restaurant version this was. He LOVED the recipe. He said the restaurant usually makes the recipe mild, and he likes it spicy. He said this was not only spicy, but exactly like the restaurant. I think it's his new favorite recipe. If you like your recipes saucy - I would highly recommend doubling the sauce. It was very very simple to make.

This was pretty good.  I did make a few substitutions though.  Instead of using green onions (don't care for them), I used a regular white onion cut into thin strips.  I also did not have any red pepper flakes, so I ended up using cayenne pepper. Next time, I will make sure I have the pepper flakes since both my husband and I thought it needed more spice.  I also doubled the sauce as others suggested.  I will be making this again.

This was OK; the trick is not to overcook the beef or it will be tough.

This recipe was quick, easy and very tasty!  I had read other review before preparing and saw that more sauce was needed, so I doubled the sauce and I thought it was perfect.  I'll be passing this recipe on to others.

As a new cook this was a great meal. It was very easy to make. My family thought there was something missing in the sauce also and we think we might add more sugar to it next time.

This recipe was great for my family who is bored with meatloaf and mashed potatoes!
I added a little more red pepper flakes and more water to make more sauce at the end.
It turned out great!  Served it up with some white rice and egg rolls and we had a great dinner!
Thanks Onemina!!

This was a great dish.  I found it a little bland, so I trippled the red pepper flakes.

Thanks for this delicious and simple recipe.  I made it for my husband and 8 children and there was not one complaint.  I tripled the recipe and there was nothing left-they loved it.  I only used 1 teaspoon of the red pepper flakes (instead of tripling it)  and it was perfect for the kids- three would have been too spicy.

Just made this for my father, doubling the sauce mixture as I usually do for all my recipes - and I will say this. 

FREAKIN AWESOME! And, VERY easy to make. 

As a side note, the beef stuck to the bottom of my non stick pan as I cooked it, despite the oil, so I cleaned off the gunk before the reduction step to make sure there's no mysterious chunks in the final mixture. 

And one last note: I halved the red pepper to tone it down a notch. Still extremely tasty. 

THANK YOU!!!!

Made it, tastes great. I edited the recipe though: I added ginger and doubled the sauce portion, and also used some cayenne pepper in the beef marinade. Would recommend!

This was delicious. We were on a diet, so we left out the sugar and the cornstarch.  It was still really good! We like spice so we added 1 Tablespoon of fresh ginger.  Our beef was already cooked so we added it last.

I doubled the sauce (as others recommended) and added extra red pepper flakes (I like things with kick). This was amazing! Deliciously tender beef and crunchy vegetables. I'll make this again. I forgot to add ginger and mushrooms as others suggested...I'd do that next time.

Very easy and very good! Made as shown with exception of adding 1 tsp ginger and 1/2 tsp chili powder as suggested by others, and only 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes. Just enough heat for us and delicious!

This was a quick and easy one to make. The prep time was right on and the clean up was easy. It goes great over white rice as the sauce mixes right in to give it extra flavor.

The only thing I would recommend doing is tenderizing the meat ahead of time.

I was looking for a beef stir fry recipe that 1-had all the ingredients in my pantry and 2-could use up left over grilled steak and veggies from my garden.  I ended up adding a green pepper and a bit of broccoli to the carrots and onions.  Very good.  I will make again.  Thanks for sharing!

Was delicious. Based on other reviews, I added ginger and doubled the sauce. The ginger flavor really made the difference so I highly recommend it.

Rice was too crunchy for me and so was the brocolli- but i can cook those seperately- The Flavor is phenomenal!!! Its like totally worth it- cheap (i bought enough to make it twice and it was under $36 (cause i bought other stuff & have not calculated just for this) It was easy, fast and a total hit with my family! Thank You!

This recipe is a pretty good base.  I think it could use a little more flavor.  I did take recommendations regarding doubling the sauce but really could've used more of a "kick" to it.

I'm diffently no expert, but this could be just what Mongolian Beef is suppose to taste like. [It was a little on the plain side.] I will make again, but maybe add some different seasonings.

This recipe was fantastic.  We added some bean sprouts which made it even better.  I suggest maybe using the low sodium soy sauce or finding some other substitute.  It was rather salty, but hey that could just be us.

This was difficult for me to make.  I don't consider myself an expert at cooking, but I do think I have some amount of skill.  The beef was tough and the flavors weren't that impressive.  I think I could have made it better, but the steps were confusing and didn't work well.  I ended up burning the sesame seeds, and the beef wasn't able to totally cook.  It burned too quickly.  I used the heat setting recommended.  If you want to make this, at least lower the heat and have all the ingredients ready to hop in the pan.  
fyi, I used a wok.

This tasted really good. I did as others suggested and added in onions, snow peas, green pepper. I also doubled the sauce. I guess the only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because this didn't have the "mongolian" taste to it. It was an EXCELLENT stir fry though. I served it over ramen noodles since I couldn't find any low mein.

I added snow peas and baby corn to this and left out the carrots. I was pretty good but not as good as I thought it would be. I think my added veggies took up some of the sauce. Next time I will double the sauce and add more red pepper and some ginger for more flavor!

I did not have green onions or carrots but tried this recipe anyway thinking that the sauce (including garlic, red pepper and soy) would be a good enough flavor.  It tasted kind of bland.  I could taste a bit of the red pepper but that was it.  It tasted more like a thick stew.  Maybe it would taste much better with the green onions??

Really good AND easy recipe. I didn't have beef, but made it with thin pork chops cut into "strips".I'm just starting to get into cooking so I love it when something is as fail-safe as this was. 2 year old liked it! Thanks!

I gave 4 stars only b/c of the changes you need to make.  I went with others reviews & doubled the sauce & also added 1 tsp sesame oil & 1/2 tsp ginger & 1 freshly pressed garlic clove.  I didn't like the meat I used but it is my favorite stir fry I have ever made.  It is not a true Mongolian Beef as others have said, yet a great stir-fry.  I did cut the pepper flakes in 1/2 & it was still too spicy for our family, so we will lessen it again.  But it allows a good taste so I will still add some.  We also did the mushrooms & peapods & it was very yummy.  Shared with neighbors & they loved it too!

I thought this was really delicious and fun to make.  I made it with extra sauce so I could have plenty to soak up with white rice.  I let it reduce a long time with the beef and I think this helped tenderize the meat more.

I did something wrong because the beef was very tough! Otherwise, the flavor was good enough.  Definitely needed something- I'm not sure what.

Great recipe. Though I must admit I winged it a bit. To get a more authentic flavor I used Thai garlic chili paste instead of the  fresh garlic and red pepper flake (can be found at most markets in the import aisle), and used a couple drops of sesame oil in the sauce in addition to the roasted sesame seeds. I also added the typical stir fry veggies - green bell pepper sliced onion and snow peas. The result was fantastic.

This was a wonderful recipe. I was origionally worried about the red pepper being too hot, but it was a perfect amount. The recipe says this serves six, but it served more like three or four.  I should have doubled the sauce as suggested by other reviewers. I did use lite soy sauce and did not have to add any additional salt (which is unusal for me). I can't wait to make this one again!

My family loved this recipe! I had to skip the carrots due to allergies, but used green bell peppers and fresh green beans. Took others advice, which I was so happy I did, and doubled the liquids. Once the dish was done I mixed it all together with ramen noodles. Great dish and thank you!

This was a tasty recipe but I wouldn't call it Mongolian Beef. I felt that this recipe called for too much corn starch because the color of the gravy turned out a milky brown which was not very appealing. Along with the carrots and green onions, I also sauteed some snow peas and served this dish with white rice. My husband thought this dish was good since he likes spicy stuff but I didn't tell him it was Mongolian Beef....I just said it was a beef stir-fry.

Excellent! Made this with my new girlfriend and we both enjoyed it very much. Paired with a blended Traminer/Riesling wine to cut the spiciness a bit.

This recipe didn't turn out at all like I expected. Like other reviewer's mentioned, it's not like the Mongolian Beef from the restaurants. My husband and I thought it was "OK", but it needed a lot of tweaking in the seasoning department. I'll probably not make this recipe again, since it turned out more like "slightly-Asian" stir-fry. We were disappointed.

While the flavor was nice, it just wasn't like the Mongolian beef I get from our local Chinese restaurants.  I think it lacked ginger?  The sauce however could easily be used in a stir fry recipe, which I will keep handy.

This was a treat. I think next time I will add more onions, carrots, and some green pepper. I agree that more sauce would do some good, but this was a great recipe because even the picky one ate it. Thanks for sharing!

This was really good, but this was hot for even my taste. I didn't even use the entire amount of red pepper either!  It would have been REALLY hot as written.  I doubled the recipie and used 1 1/4tsp. crushed red pepper instead of 2 tsp.  Next time I will cut it down to 1 tsp. and see how that does.

This was soooooooo good!  I made this recipe exactly as stated, except the sesame seeds, (I didn't have any on hand) and it was great!  Next time I may use a bit more red pepper flakes, it was spicy, but I like spicier.  Thanks for the great recipe, will be making again and again!

I gave this dish a 4, but fiance gave it a 5. He said it was the best Chinese dish I'd ever made. I made it very spicy with extra red pepper flakes since we like hot food. It was very good. Depending on your tastes, it ranges from good to spectacular.

This dish is simple enough to make and adds interest to my dinner menu.  I have used both the green onions and yellow too-thick cut and loved both.  I do crush the red pepper flakes in my hand before adding it- it brings out more heat.  I use a little sesame oil to add more flavor too.

This was great! The sauce was tasty. I am not a fan of HOT and I have kids, so I made it without the red pepper. I used a small amount of black pepper instead. I served this over rice. It was a hit!

Very good! Couldn't find seasame seeds at grocery but it was still good.  The red pepper flakes makes it spicy and good.  I served over white rice with some broccoli.  Will make again.

This is a good starter recipe :) We found it too bland as written, because we like our mongolian beef really spicy. I substituted broccoli for the carrots the second time I made it(just personal preference), marinated the beef for 2-3 hours in extra soy sauce, some sesame oil, and chili oil(1 tsp.), and added several drops of chili oil to the sauce. Then even the leftovers were good. Thanks for your recipe!

it's decent-- not real mongolian beef as I knew it, but it's ok. doesn't quite have the carmelized sweetness that I was expecting. . .

This receipe was really good, great flavour and tender meat, I would as others have suggested increase the sauce as there was not enough and it did go a bit too thick because of this.  But overall great.

This is a great "start" of a recipe.  You have to tweak it a lot.  I took others suggestions that there was not enough sauce.  I tripled the sauce. Used sesame seeds that were already toasted.  I did not add carrots but used mushrooms, red and yellow pepper instead. Used New York steak. Will make again

I tried to jazz up the flavor a bit by marinating the beef whole, grilling it, then slicing it into strips. I also added extra garlic and red pepper. The overall dish turned out okay, but I doubt I'll make it again. I just prefer a different recipe I've found.

The sauce was too similar to thick brown gravy.  I did not like it nor did my family.

I marinated the beef for 24hrs, doubled the sauce, used PAM instead of 2T oil, and replaced the carrots with broccoli -- we loved it!

I cannot think of a word to describe how good this is. My husband and I had a hard time stop eating this once we were full. My husband said oh I don’t know how many times “This recipe is a keeper. Don’t ever lose this recipe.” We had it left over the next day (and I hate leftovers) it was better the next day (if it could get any better). I did triple the sauce ingredients, as I and my husband like a lot of sauce with ours for putting over rice. I will make this one over and over and over.

This was good, but it definitely needs more spices.  I will make it again except add extra spices.  I also added mushrooms which we really liked.

This is a good base recipe for mongolian beef. To add more flavor, I added 2 teaspons of chili oil and it really made the difference!

The sauce was really bland. Luckily I hade some "Lawry's" sesame ginger 30 min marinade on hand which completely saved it. 1 1/2c did the trick. After that this was the BEST mongolian beef ever!! My family looooved it and we'll never order it out again. Thanks alot!

I found the sauce to be a great base but it needs more flavor. Its wonderfull for how quickly its done. I think it also a good idea to double the sauce, but I cant figure out how to make it more exciting. Too bland for me.

A very tasty recipe, although I needed more garlic and more soy.  It is not an especially quick recipe, as I'd thought.  I'm a pretty experienced cook, but all the prepping, marinating, and several stages of cooking make this more like a 30 minute recipe.
