I remember this from my mother making it.  We use 1 can of mushroom soup and 1 can of tomato soup mixed together.  The mushroom soup really adds flavor.  I couldn't remember how to make it until I found this recipe and it came back to me.  Thank you!!

My mom used to make this the only difference was that she always layered it. The hamburger/tomato mixture went at the bottom of a large bowl, next layer was green beans, then mashed potatoes, topped with lots of cheese! Very good

Very good. I did have to substitute tomatoe sauce for the tomatoe soup, and I only used one can of sauce. I also used french style green beans, and added more seasoning- garlic and pepper.Using instant potatoes also made it a lot quicker. I will put mushrooms in it next time.
Overall, a very easy to make meal.
I'll probally play around with this recipe and see what else I can come up with.
Again, VERY GOOD !!!!

Really good basic meal. Super easy to put together. I use instant potatoes (4-6 serving size) and add 2 tsp (or more) of basil and some minced onion & garlic. I only cook it until the cheese melts.

My mom used to make this dish, years ago; it was from the old red&white checkered BH&G cookbook.  I used the 1lb ground beef, 1/2 an onion, 1 can low-sodium tomato soup, & subbed the green beans with corn.  I added 1/2c milk and 1 egg to the mashed potatoes, covered the meat with them, & used 1/2c cheddar cheese to top.  Thanks for reminding me of this good old comfort food recipe, Corrie!

Very, very good!  The whole family loved it.  I
added a 4 oz. can of sliced mushrooms and cut the
onion down by half.  I also added garlic.  I took
another reviewer's suggestion and used instant
mashed potatoes to reduce the prep time.  As 
always, I used chicken broth instead of water
when making the instant taters.  We'll be having
this again real soon!

I used to make this dish many years ago, but had lost the recipe. It's great to have found it again.  The one difference I remember is that my old recipe used instant mashed potato flakes with an egg beaten in. It was very good that way, and faster to make.

This is the kind of recipe I look for! Excellent one Corrie! I used 1/2 bag of frozen broccoli for veggie instead (could probably use anything) and added some onion and garlic like I like to. Also to make it faster I added instant potatoes on the top and those were good.

I have made this recipe for over 30 years.  It is really wonderful.  The only thing I do different is I omit the tomato soup (too bland)  and just use ketchup in the ground beef.  Makes it more tangy.  I don't measure just eyeball it.  Gives the green beans a better flavor. I let the beef, ketchup, onion and beans simmer all together for awhile... also I use the Shellie green beans.  Yum...I'm getting hungry.

I'm a vegetarian so I subbed meatless crumbles for the ground cow. I also used instant mashed potatoes because I had some in the pantry that I've been meaning to use up. I added green peas, as well. This dish was delicious and seems super kid friendly.  There were three of us and we ate the whole thing.  My hamless pie was a huge success.

My substitutions probably caused the lower rating. I used Healthy Choice tomato soup, corn instead of green beans, and mashed redskins with sour cream due to availability in my pantry.

A good quick simple recipe. I couldnt of asked for more. I did add some spices to make it a little more flavorful or else it would of been too bland.

As written this would be very bland.  Where are the seasonings?  I took the suggestions of others and used one can of tomato and one can of cream of mushroom soup.  I seasoned the meat/soup mixture to my taste, and made the mashed potatoes with a little butter and salt as I normally would.  Also, I did not mix in the green beans -- I just cooked them as a side dish.  Edit:  I thought this dish was great with the modifications I made.  Also, I wanted to note that I used ground turkey instead of ground beef.

This is a comfort food recipe from way back in my family. Easy to put together and satisfying as well. My mother always added a bit of chili powder and that's how I like it. She also used a can of diced tomatoes with juice, too.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars because despite it's appearance, my entire family gobbled it up.  I followed the recipe to a 't' and although it was good, I will probably make a couple of changes next time.  I am going to sub out one can of tomato soup for a can of cream of mushroom as other posters have suggested.  I will probably add a can of drained niblet corn too.  Like I mentioned before, it was very tasty but when you scoop a portion onto your plate, it looks like gloppy mush.  The soup/beef/green mixture was very thin.  I will definitely make this again with only a couple of modifications.

I made this word for word what the recipe called for - and we decided it was a little bland.  I'll try adding the can of mushroom soup next time, and maybe some garlic when sauteeing the meat/onions.  Just didn't meet my expectations based on the version I ate coming up.  Will try again and see how it goes.

My family loves this casserole and so do I because when all else fails these ingredients I always have on hand.  I pretty much follow the recipe except I make a few more potatoes bc my family likes them.  Great leftover to take to work.

This is definately a variation of shepherd's pie but a tasty one at that.  A friend of mine used to make this but I never got the recipe from her.  Only thing I remember that was different was that she used white cheese - mozzarella I believe and she put the potatoes in the middle leaving an edge open so that the soup mixture would bubble up over the potatoes as it cooked.  So...here is what I did.  I used ground turkey and seasoned it with garlic pepper and kosher salt and added 2 chopped garlic cloves, used low sodium tomato soups, and added some mozzarella cheese right in with the mashed potatoes.  I then made a ring with the potatoes as directed and sprinkled with monterey jack cheese and a colby/jack mix ( I had some bags of shredded cheese I needed to use up ).  I did cook mine for about 15 min. longer than the time called for.  This turned out great and the cheese in the mashed potatoes was awesome and I do think the mozzarella and monterey jack cheeses go better with the tomato sauce.  Nice comfort style dinner with a tossed salad and some bread - yum!!!  I'm glad to have found this recipe.

This recipe is a great base, and it really is one of those staples that just about all of our mothers probably made at some point. It's also, obviously, a variation of Shepard's pie. I've tried the recipe as-is and while good...I just felt like it needed some help.  I use a can of tomato sauce instead of the soup and I toss in some sliced fresh mushrooms. The real change is in the potatoes. I roast 2 heads of garlic with olive oil and rosemary. While that's roasting I cook the potatoes, unpeeled, in chicken stock, then drain... and reserve some of the cooking liquid. I add the garlic to the potatoes, then mash that up with some Kosher salt and cracked peppercorns. Then I heat the butter, some sour cream, heavy cream (or crème fraîche if I have it...whole milk if I have neither) and the reserved stock from the potatoes until it forms a nice, warm sauce (don't boil it!).   The warm sauce is then mashed in with the potato and garlic mixture. Once that is done, I mix in some chopped green onions and cubed cheddar cheese.  It's a lumpy, gooey mess of mashed potatoes, but it is amazingly good and helps add a little something to the dish that everyone seems to really like.   So, really... it's essentially the same dish but I just do a much fancier mashed potato dish on top.

Probably 3 and a half.  I made this tonight and it was quite good with some of the changes I made. I followed the advice of some here and did one can of tomato and one of mushroom.  I added more veggies as well.  I used the onion, half a red pepper, I had a small zucchini that needed to be used,  so I threw that in, about half a bag of frozen corn and the beans.  I also added a few good splashes of Franks.  All in all a good quick dinner.  Thanks Corrie!

I remembered something similar as a family favorite growing up, but have to say I am really disappointed. This dish REALLY lacks flavor. I'd recommend adding worchestire sauce, or other herbs/spices to jazz it up before putting it in the casserole. Big time bummer.

I made this recipe tonight. My husband and I prefer spicy food, so I diced eight already sliced jalapeños. I then added instead of JUST green beans, a mixture of frozen peas, carrots and green beans. Also, like other users have suggested, I used mushroom soup instead of tomato. Beautiful. :]

I've been making this since I was 12 yrs old. We found this recipe on a pamphlet that came with a tube of Prell shampoo. Anyone remember Prell!! It had some other very simple receipes a young girl could make. I guess you could call this my first cookbook. Why Prell was premoting it I could not  tell you It called for a beaten egg in the potatos

VERY good!!  Added a bit more salt, sauteed onion and garlic with the meat, and made the potatoes from scratch with green onion and cream cheese.  Kids LOVED it!!  We loved it, too!!  Sent the recipe on to my parents, and THEY loved it as well.  Easy!!

My hubby and I whipped this recipe up last night and it was SCRUMPTIOUS!! We substituted frozen peas for green be. We always use ground turkey when a recipe calls for ground beef. Next go round, we're going to use mushrooms and fresh, organic green beans for this recipe. A mighty thanks to the author of this recipe and also the folks who reviewed it and made suggestions!

I would give this a 3.5. It's quick, easy, and doesn't taste bad, but no recipe that uses condensed soups deserves a 5 in my opinion.  Like another reviewer suggested, I used tomato sauce mixed with cream of mushroom soup.  This was exactly the recipe I was looking for because we were hungry and I didn't want to cook long.

I didnt use tomato soup, i used cream of mushroom instead and added a squeeze of ketchup and a dash of worsteshire, and saute onion, garlic with the beef. Sometimes i add a small can of corn to the mix just depending on what i have on hand.So i altered it quite a bit to suit my families tastes but the base recipe was great inspiration. Its a great cheap filling meal that everyone in my family has seconds of.

You just saved my backside!  I didn't feel like cooking, which disappointed the hubby of course; however, I hopped to it with only a few ingredients on hand.  I came across your recipe and gave it a whirl.  Hubby entered the kitchen and immediately said, "Mmm"!  He's very hard to please when it comes to something new so this gave me a huge smile & sigh of relief.  Next came the taste test which is where he exclaimed, "This is good"!  My opioion - fast, easy, comforting, inexpensive, and MUCH BETTER than sheppard's pie!!!  This goes n2 the family favs.  Thank you!

I used a few other reviews and altered this a bit. I used 2 cans of mushroom soup, 1 can of diced tomatoes, corn and leftover green bean casserole and mashed potatoes from Thanksgiving..My family LOVED it. Thanks for this posting :)

Great casserole.  I have been using the base of this recipe for years.  I add some frozen mixed veggies (defrosted in the microwave) & seasoned diced tomatoes.  Instant (prepared) mashed potatoes mixed with an egg, garlic and seasoned salt is a quick topping.  I usually use parmesan for the cheese.  This is a very forgiving recipe in that you can use whatever veggies  and cheeses that you like. This is total comfort food!

Mom made this all the time when I was growing up.  It is easy to make in a foil container and give away.  I have often done this for friends who have just moved or brought home a new baby.  It freezes well if need be, or can be reheated in the micro serving by serving as people are hungry.

This is a very quick and easy recipe. I used 1/2 pound of lean hamburger and 1/2 pound of lean sausage. I added garlic, diced up a tomato and actually used ketchup instead of tomato soup. (The vinegar in ketchup adds a nice flavor to the dish.)

This meal was a hit with my family.  I made the recipe "as is" with a couple simple modifications. I took other suggestions and used one can tomato soup and the other tomato sauce.  Also added a squirt of worchester and ketchup to kick it up a bit. My daughter suggested adding corn to it, so I did and it was great.  The only change I would make is using MORE potatos.  I knew 4 potatoes were not enough, so I boiled 7 small ones and it still was not as much potato as I would have wanted.  I covered the entire casserole with potatoes and not just the edges.  Thanks for the recipe...this was great as lunch leftovers and I will make it again for sure!

I thought this was a pretty good recipe.  Nothing special, but pretty tasty if you add some extra spices.  I added garlic salt and pepper to my meat mixture.  Only used three potatoes, then mashed them with some butter, salt and pepper. I put the potatoes on top of the meat mixture and covered the top with about twice the amount of cheese called for. I wish I would have put some cheese between the meat and potato mixture as well.  In the end, this recipe just seemed to me and my husband to be another version of Sheperd's Pie.  Not bad though.

Terrific starter recipe.  Another reviewer said it right: you probably can use just about any kind of veggie.  And creamy soup.  We used Condensed cheddar cheese soup, added a little milk, mixed it with browned ground turkey that was cooked with the onions and garlic, with some basil and pepper.  Topped with french cut green beans and homemade mashies with a colby/jack shredded cheese mix on top.  Baked until cheese good and melty.  Fiance said a definite 'make-again' !!!  Thank you!!

I made a few changes to this...and it was WONDERFUL! It was really good as written, but a little bland - but would be good for young children. I used 1 can tomato and 1 can cream of mushroom as others have done. I also added about a half cup red wine, a little worcestershire, I used 3/4ths of a thawed bag of frozen corn/green beans/carrots, added a bit of garlic also. This really is shephard's pie and should go under that heading....I cooked up about 5 lbs of potatoes too so there would be plenty! this is one I'll make over and over again! =)

Great recipe with a few alterations:  I added 4 cloves of garlic, some basil, and some frozen corn.  Used one can tomato soup, one can cream of mushroom.  I greased the bottom of baking dish and put frozen crispy crowns (tator tots) on the bottom of the dish.  Used instant mashed potatoes for the top.  Brother  liked it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Hamburger pie is delicious.  I like to add a 15 oz can of drained sweet corn with the ground beef and green beans. Another shortcut I take is using dried minced onion, which you can add to the ground beef when browning.  This casserole freezes well, so you can make a double batch and freeze one for later.

I have been making this dish for years!, but I do find that 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can tomato soup has better flavor and also I spread the meat mixture out to cover the whole pan and make enough potato's to cover all the meat mixture, This really is comfort food!!

This was good.  My 2 year old ate 2 plates full.  I did not have 2 cans of tomato soup so I used 1 can tomato soup and one can reduced sodium cream of mushroom.  I also used french cut green beans instead of canned and chicken broth to make the mashed potatoes (boxed of course!).  I added fresh garlic to the hamburger meat along with basil and a dash of oregano.  Yummy!

Good, fast, and easy.  I also added 2 cloves of garlic, salt and pepper, and would probably use 1/2 the onion.
I used instant mashed potatoes and it was still good, however if I had more time I'd make real mashed.  The cheese is a good addition so add enough.  I only baked it until the cheese was melted. Good.

Read reviews and decided to go with (1) can cream of mushroom, (1) can cream of tomato which I added to the hamburger, (1) c. peas & (1) c. corn (no green beans) and also added Worcestershire. Had chix stock leftover so cooked potatoes in this (would not do this unless I had it around). Added spices, sour cream as well as milk to the potatoes once mashed. I thought it was great!

A classic recipe that my mother raised me on. It was one of my favorites growing up and one of my children's favorites and now they're grown. The only thing to do differently is that there is NO reason - whatsoever - to NOT cover the meat with mashed potatoes. We always have and it's divine. It does bubble up through potatoes sometimes, and perhaps that's why this person said not to, but who cares? It's about yummy goodness and the potatoes on top look beautiful. I'd recommend putting your baking dish on a lined baking sheet, just in case it does bubble up. Don't forget to add pepper either!

Yummy! My mom used to make this when I was little, and it was just as good as I remembered. I prepared the mashed potatoes my usual way with milk and a couple spoonfuls of mayo, but followed everything else exactly. It was shunned by my kids (ages 2 & 3) but that's not unusual. The grownups went back for seconds!

this one's a keeper...
I took the advice of another and did 1 can of mushroom soup/1 tomato.  Also about a half can drained mushrooms.  I squeezed garlic into my mashed potatoes and covered with half cheddar half jalepeno jack, and it was a GREAT family meal :)   The rest I left the same and will make it again!

we all decided that we did in fact LIKE the dish, but none of us touched the leftovers.  It was very different, resulting in confusion but in a good way.  Don't think I'll make it again though, if I do I will cut back on the soup, I think that it was a bit overwhelming.

This was amazing! So easy and simple. I didn't have the tomato soup, so I just chopped some tomato and added it in, I also added about 1/2c. (or so) of BBQ sauce. I just mixed those in with the meat sauce. It was GREAT! :-) I had never thought of putting all of this stuff together...yum!

This was SOOO Good! I used two cans of cream of mushroom soup per someone's suggestion; I also seasoned the meat mixture with salt and pepper and used frozen mixed vegetables instead of the green beans.

The only change I made is when making the mashed potatoes also add quarter stick of real butter and a half cup of sour cream also over the shredded cheddar cheese sprinkle real crushed baccon.

This was a tasty comfort food recipe ~ took the recommendation on using 1 can of mushroom soup instead of 2 tomato soup and it turned out great, you just can't get enough!  I also decided to use one of the recipes for garlic mashed potatoes for the topping and felt that it really added some flavor to this dish

Delicious!  I used the modifications that many reviewers have suggested.  I added one can of tomato soup and one can cream of mushroom.  I also used minced onion (I was out of fresh), garlic powder and lots of Worcestershire sauce in the meat, probably a good 3 T.  This turned out very flavorful and my entire family ate it right up...especially my 1 year old and picky 11 year old!  I will definitely be making this again and again.

I made mashed potatoes with red potatoes, salt, butter and milk. My ground beef was cooked with a cup and a half of small diced onions and a tablespoon of minced garlic. I added a can of condensed tomato soup and 1 can of diced Italian tomatoes. I put it in a 9"x13" glass dish. I then put a layer of steamed corn (i had no french cut green beans like I usually use). I topped it all with the potatoes. Then I added a generous layer of cheddar/Monterey mix. Finally I added French's Onions to the top and baked in the 350  oven for about 25 minutes. ** Result** YUM-O! Kids liked it, hubby liked it and I liked it.

This is one of our go-to favorites.  I like to use ground turkey instead of beef and I spice it up with a bit of garlic salt, pepper, and sometimes brown it with onions.

This was a quick easy meal.  Had everything I needed in the house.  I did make changes, based on other feedback.  I doctored the meat with onions, garlic, parsley, Italian Seasoning.  I used canned corn and canned green beans.  I also used one can of tomato soup and one can of diced tomatoes.  I would make this again.  I would probably rate this a 3-1/2 star.

This is an old BH & G recipe. I browned the meat in an iron skillet and used Bob Evans southwestern style potatoes (the kind in the refrigerated section of the market). I then stuck the whole skillet in the oven so I only have one pan to clean. Quick, easy and delicious. I have used mushroom soup with this as well. Corn is a nice addition.

Meh...not that amazing. A great base though. I used one can tomato and one can mushrrom soup as suggested. It would have been quite bland if I only had used tomato soup. I also layered it. The potatoes definately need some butter/milk/egg. I am determined to make it better next time and plan on adding a bunch more spices, using more pepper jack cheese and mixing in more veggies.

I thought this was fabulous, even with using condensed soup.  It has a surprisingly great taste, is simple, cheap and quick to make.  And in my opinion, this deserves five stars, BECAUSE it achieves everything a mom wants for a meal, without the slaving time and effort.  Definite keeper!!

I had to make a few changes as I only had instant potatoes on hand and I had to use (1 can) tomato sauce instead of tomato soup.  I spiced it up a little with some garlic powder and italian seasoning just for flavor.  I also used 2 cans of green beans.  It was very tasty and so easy that I thought I was missing a step.  My toddlers love this so it's a keeper.

It's a keeper! I added 1 can of corn and an additional can of green beans. I also cooked the meat and onions with garlic. I would suggest making your mashed potatoes how you like to eat them, just mashing cooked potatoes is so plain. I put the potatoes on top since I had no room in my dish for them to go around. Will make a lot. Also you can cook everything up and throw it on a plate. I really don't see the point in baking it for 30 mins!!!!

Thank you for posting this! My mom used to make this exact recipe w/ one can of tomato soup and I've been craving it lately, it wasn't easy to find online! The only thing I change is adding a can of corn to the ground beef mixture (like mom did) and putting the potatoes over the entire top instead of just the outside ring. Makes great economical lunches since it's even tastier once it sits in the fridge =)

I thought that it ended up being a bit too soupy, but it had really good flavor. I added a little garlic, but otherwise followed the recipe. I would maybe add another potato or two, next time.

This was a good recipe!  One serving was very filling, yet my wonderful man had two servings.  Very easy to make, I used instant potatoes (6 servings) and I added some garlic to the meat mixture, and cooked the green beans with the meat mixture too.  I only had one can of tomato soup, so i opened a can of tomato paste, used 2/3rds of that and added just a 1/4 cup of water .... it's tasty and will be nice for a hot lunch in my boyfriend's thermos!  Thanks!

I thought this looked boring, but tried it because of the good reviews, and we were not disappointed.  It's delicious!  I added a few cloves of crushed garlic to the meat and used frozen green beans, which I steamed first.  It was very good on a cold winter day.

I found this recipe while trying to find a way to use my leftover mashed potatoes. My whole family loved this recipe-the kids asked for 3rd's. We used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato soup and sauteed fresh mushrooms with the hamburger and onion. I layered the green beans on top of the meat mixture and then our leftover mashed potatoes and cheese. Delicious!

I made it with the recommendations...used instant potatoes (made 6 servings) added 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 tsp basil and 1 tsp garlic powder to ground beef and used french cut green beans. This one is a keeper!

My family LOVED this meal! I tweaked it a little for my own tastes. I didn't have an onion handy, so I added onion powder and garlic powder to the hamburger as it was cooking. I used boxed mashed potatoes (cheddar flavored). I also used 1 can of tomato soup, and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup. The cream of mushroom soup really made it creamy and yummy! The cheddar flavored potatoes really added a lot of flavor as well. I will definately make this again!

I gave this recipe a four because of all the things I added. The result was great! I think my 4 yr old & 2 yr old ate more than I did! I added carrots, celery, corn and shredded cabbage. Also I used 1/2 a can of tomato and 1/2 a can of cream of mushroom soups. This was a great way to get my kids to eat a ton of veggies and love it!! Thanks for the great idea!!

Cut this recipe in half.  Used leftovers for the potatoes and mashed potatoes.  Used canned tomatoes instead of the tomato soup and added chili sauce to add spice.  It was a hit.  It is a simple recipe that can be altered to use up you leftovers.

Good. I took the other suggestions and made it with 1/2 cream of mushroom and 1/2 tomato soup. I also used corn instead of green beans so my son would eat it. 
My husband said he would prefer it without cheese....but what does he know?! :)

This is a staple in my house.  My only variations are cooking a chopped onion with the meat and using only 1 can of soup.  I also spread the potatoes evenly over the top and omit the cheese.  LOVE!

I have always loved this recipe, but lost the recipe a little while back. I am glad to have found it again! The only thing I did different was to add 4 cloves of fresh garlic, chopped up, to the browning meat. I also used instant mashed potatoes and I used 2 cups of cheese instead of the 1. Yum!!

We thought it was pretty bland.  Next time we will add a lot more things to spice it up.  I try to follow the recipe before I change it so I know what the original product was going to be.  In this case, spice the recipe up your first time around.  We will continue changing this recipe b/c it is nice to have something different to do with ground beef.

I thought this recipe was pretty good..my husband and 1 yr old son absolutely loved it though. I finally have a way for my son to eat green beans!  Like some of the other reviewers I used instant potatoes and added mushrooms to the meat mix--although I think I'll leave the mushrooms out next time since what I didn't like about this was the flavor of the mushrooms.

WOW...my kids gobbled this up.  I don't use tomato soup so I pureed some canned stewed tomatoes instean and since they don't like green beans I used canned corn.  It was great and I'll be making this again!

Very good! I however,did do some things different. I made a big batch so I added a lil more hamburger and a half of bag of egg noodles(cooked)and because of the noodles and extra meat I added extra soup, 1 lrg can of tomato soup and 1 sm can as well as 1 sm can of cream of mushroom soup,minced onion, a tablespoon of sugar,garlic pepper and some cayanne pepper for a lil kick. 2 cans green beans and 1 can corn. I also used instant mashed potatoes topped with shredded monterey jack & colby cheese. turned out great!

Loved it! Good stick to your ribs food. 10 yr old loved it too. I splashed a little tobasco in it. Not enough to make it hot but enough to ad some flavour. I also put in green beans and corn. and some garli, black pepper, a little italian seasoning, 2 cloves of garlic. Best with home made mash potatoes.

I made a few changes...split recipe between two pie plates with crust (had one for dinner and the other went to the freezer). Increased the mashed potatoes, deleted the tomato sauce and substituted 3/4 cup brown gravy per ea pie plate/dough. Also used fresh green beans. My finicky 9 yr old son loved it. Next time I will add a dough topping to make a true pie.

I made it with green beans once and 3 out of five family members really liked it.  So next time I made it I used corn instead of green beans.  Much better.  I recommened corn!

This tasted great!! Suggest lightly greasing the baking pan for easier clean-up. I used tomato soup with rice because that was all I had, and it worked just fine.

This was okay.  It was different.  I didn't have tomato soup, so I used tomato sauce instead.  I also added more cheese since my family loves cheese.  My 5 year old liked it too, so I'm sure I will make it againg.  Thanks.

I was looking for something to make that did require a trip to the store. This was great! I did not have two cans of tomato soup, so I used one can of soup and a can of condensed veg. soup. It added some color and the tasts blend very well. I also used instant butter potatoes and sharp chedder cheese. This was so quick and it made tons! I would probably use more instant potatoes if I was feeding a family larger than two. Thank you for this recipe; it will be a keeper! :)

I made this recipe for my "finicky" husband last night and was so pleased to get a thumbs up.  He said " honey, this is one of the best meals I have ever had.  So I will indeed make it again.  I used very lean hanburger and it came out perfect. A definite Keep.

I made this recipe and my husband loved it, the only thing different I did was to add diced carrots and it seemed to give a nice added flavor. I will make this again and recommend it to anyone one who likes a real meat and potato meal.

Very hearty home style meal in one that my parents and I really liked.  We just finished eating dinner and my parents had seconds.  Hope my brother didn't want any!!!
I do think it needs something else some kind of seasoning like maybe garlic?
My parents added sour cream.  Good recipe, I would recommend.

This was a tasty recipe using things everyone has around their kitchen.  However, it was a little too time-consuming to prepare for my tastes.  Next time I will substitute instant mashed potatoes to save time.

What a great idea. I used Hunts Traditional Pasta Sauce instead of tomato soup. Also, I added frozen mixed vegetables instead of just green beans.  Great raves from everyone. I would make this delightful dinner again and again.

I had a similar recipe years ago and this sounded very similar. I cut it in half, used left over mashed potatoes and used the frozen green beans! I like to layer the green beans on top of the hamburger and tomato soup mixture and I cover the whole thing with the mashed potatoes.

I enjoyed this recipe, however mine seemed like it had too much tomato soup, next time I will make with 1 can. Also, not sure if you’re supposed to assume, but I made the mashed potatoes with butter, milk, salt, and pepper...

I rated it high because it’s simple ingredients and takes a few minutes to prep. At first I was skeptical  because I didn’t think the ingredients would taste good together. My picky 7 year old liked it and my husband said “it’s not too bad!” It’s a good meal when things need to be done quick and taste pretty good.

Made with sliced, canned potatoes, but, in hindsight, I don't think that was a good idea.  Next time, I might try boxed instant potatoes.  Also, this recipe is bland.  Needs something....maybe garlic powder or Mrs. Dash????

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used all ingredients but added diced celery, carrots and 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes  sauteed with the onions and ground beef. I had fresh parsley to use up and added that to the mashed potatoes with milk & butter.

This was just delicious! Comfort food  on a cold rainy day! I too did the 1 can tomato soup and 1 can mushroom soup as other reviewers suggested.
Also added half a pound more hamburger, other than that just made my usual mashed/whipped potatoes, loved it!
Will be making this again for sure!!

This came from 8th grade Home Ec Class.  Tomato sauce (no Tomato Soup, please); no cheese (please).  Basic recipe that men seem to really like (meat and potatoes).  Make it when I have leftover mashed potatoes to use up.

Loved it! Great recipe to clear out your pantry! I made a few changes but overall it was great. I browned the meat with garlic powder and onions. For the potatoes I used instant because it was what I had on hand (2 packages buttery homestyle, then some sprinkles of regular). I did what someone else suggested and put an egg, garlic and seasoned salt in the potatoes, and I also used cream of mushroom with the tomato soup. I mixed a can of diced tomatoes with garlic, onion and pepper along with a frozen bag of mixed veggies along with the green beans. Added a few squirts of worchester, ketchup, sprinkle of salt and pepper, cheddar and parmesan shredded cheese then mixed the mixture all up and placed it in a pan with the potatoes and cheese on top. SCRUMPTIOUS!

I make this once a week for my family and it makes a great dish to take to a potluck.  My recipe is out of  the Better Homes ad Gardens New Cookbook on page 245.   The differences/substitutions are it only calls for 1 can beans,  1 can of tomato soup and 1/2 cup onion and 3/4 tsp salt &  1/8 tsp pepper. Since this recipe doesn't use any salt pepper it could be the reason some think it is bland.  My recipe says to add 1 beaten egg and milk  when you mash your potatoes and to  make them  stiff enough  to hold shape so you can drop the potatoes in mounds atop meat mixture sprinkle with cheese.  I serve garlic bread as a side. Yummy!!

I made this exactly as the recipe is written the first time with absolutely positive results and comments from all the enjoyed eating it.  The second time I substituted corn for the green beans with less the enthusiastic results  from the family.  Back to green beans and a wonderful tasty meal all in one dish!!

My family loves this recipe but we substitute cream of celery or cream of mushroom soup for the tomato soup. The recipe is less tangy and sweet with this substitution but the flavor is excellent.

Added butter, milk, pepper and garlic salt to my mashed potatoes but otherwise, I made it as directed.  There was a contradiction in the recipe.  It said to cook 30 minutes or until potatoes are golden brown.  If you cover the potatoes with the grated cheese, the potatoes don't brown.  It was good and easy to make.

I used a beef broth gravy . Added extra vegetables and instead of just going around the edges with the potatoes I dropped it in by spoonfuls plus I added the cheese into the potatoes.

This a great quick and easy meal to make. I followed the recipe as directed only adding a can of corn also. Even in its simplicity, it came out quite tasty and I was able to make it look like I put more work into it than I did. I will make this again!

I tried this recipe but put the mashed potatoes on the bottom, the ground beef/onion/pepper mixture with tomato sauce next, then added a cornbread topping. Really good

My mother in law made it for my husband while he was growing up so it was one of the 1st things I learned to make after getting married. My husband, and then my kids too, like it with cut green beans AND corn. With extra cheese in it and an egg in the potatoes. One can of tomato soup and 2 pounds of beef. 
When my daughter got married this was one of the 1st things she called me about learning how to make!

Meat mixture tasted a little bland to me, so I add a little bit of ketchup & mustard to it. I then put the potato's around the edge of the dish first the dumped in the mixture, and then I add chopped dill pickles on top of the cheese. I liked it & so did the family. Kind of reminded me a little like shepherd's pie with less vegys.

Super easy comfort food. I've been making this dish for years. The only substitution I make is to use 1 14.5 oz. can Italian Stewed Tomatoes instead of tomato soup. It adds great flavor!

This was pretty good!  My husband actually liked it and he's picky!  I added a can of corn to it but pretty much stuck to the recipe (though I cut it in half - too much as it is).  I will definately do this again.  My husband said not to cook it in the oven but in a pan on the stove and he doesn't want the cheese though I do.  I will put this recipe in my back pocket.

I thought this was great!  Here is what I did different:  I added one can tomato soup, one can mushroom soup (as suggested), Cavander's Greek seasoning, one can of corn for texture and I added all the mashed potatoes to the top (I used 2 pouches of instant).  Cheap, easy and it feed a family of 5 with 2nds to be had plus some left overs.

I made this and it was pretty good. I would tweak the recipe with lining the bottom of the dish with potatoes, not just on the side. I would also tweak the tomato soup. It was kind of bland. I would add ketch up or leave out the tomato soup and use tomatoe sauce. I spiced mine up with, basil, oregano, chili powder, etc. I also added a bit of hot sauce to the tomato soup.  I'm not crazy about tomatoe soup, anyway, so I would replace that with a substitute. I a,so would add a little olive oil to the tomato base and add mllk and butter to the mashed potatoes. I definetly make more potatoes to put into it , next time. I would like to add corn to it, too. The basic idea was great, though. I just have to tweak it , to suit my taste buds. A little on the bland side, as it was originally posted.

This is a delightful recipe and everyone loved it.  I didn't want the tomato base so I substituted a can of cream of mushroom soup.  A regular menu item for my family now.

I fixed this last night with some of the tweaks others mentioned. I used ground turkey instead of beef; one can of tomato sauce with one can of Cream of Mushroom soup; instant mashed potatoes. 

I left the green beans out since our daughter does not like them. We didn't have corn handy so left these out. 

I added minced garlic, onion powder, kosher salt, and ground pepper to the meat while it browned. 

I baked it for 40 minutes instead of 30. Just great! 

My hubby at over 1/2 of this before I realized it! Not good for his wt., but it does speak as to how good it tastes. 

Our very picky 12 year old loved it too! Will make this again, but add corn into it.

I learned how to make this recipe in junior high school food class.  I still make it 50 years later and my family loves it.  I use a casserole dish and pile the potato mixture on top, then the shredded cheese.  It turns out perfect every time.

Made this for dinner last night and my family RAVED! There are four of us and everyone (including the super-picky teenage girl) had seconds. I did use real mashed potatoes, made with butter and whole milk. The flavor of instant just isn't the same and my family complains every time I try to use it. The only substitutions were 1 can tomato soup and 1 can diced tomatoes (because I didn't have 2 cans of soup), undrained. Also, I have an italian spice mix that I threw in a teaspoon(ish) of. I also added a teaspoon(ish) of minced garlic while sauteing. Sea salt and cracked pepper, of course. I tend to always spice things up, so that does not affect how I rate a recipe.

I like this because it was so simple. I added 3 garlic cloves and used instant mashed potatoes. Next time I think I will replace the green beens with peas and carrots.

This is a family favorite! We usually make it with leftover mashed potatoes and we use only 1/3 pound of ground beef which makes it leaner.

Exactly what I grew up on, but I always use two cans of green beans and cover the entire surface with the mashed potatoes. Great comfort food!

I added quite a few spices (thyme, salt, pepper, fresh garlic, and paprika) and substituted tomato soup for one can of organic tomato sauce and a small amount of water.  Against my better judgment, I followed the mashed potato recipe to the letter except for the spices mentioned above. The potatoes were dry and bland. Next time, I'll use my own recipe for the mashed potatoes. I think pretty much any veggie could be substituted for the green beans. This is a decent basic recipe.

I loved this recipe it was great! Due to the request of super picky boyfriend, I dont cook with onions. So, I had to use onion salt as a sub. I did use lots of salt and pepper to season but other than that it was great will make agian!

I made this for dinner tonight. I did not have tomato soup so I used spaghetti sauce. Added a few spices and it was GREAT!  Would make this again!  Thanks for the recipe.....

I enjoyed this dish.   A little bland, but good.  Kids didn't like so much though.  I used spegehtti sauce instead of tomato soup since I didn't have any tomato soup on hand.  Wonder if the kids would like it better with the soup?  Will try again.

This was really good! and was so quick to make. I used instant mashed potatoes, and substituted 1 can cream of mushroom in for one of the tomato soups as suggested. Only left in the oven for about 10 minutes. Will add corn in next time!

This was a good, warm meal for a rainy day. I used canned corn and frozen peas instead of green beans, and used one can of condensed soup and one can of diced tomatoes.  I just spread the mashed potatoes over the top, and switched the oven to broil for the last minute to kind of crisp them up.  All in all, a good recipe to keep on hand!

It went over well with my three-year-old, so it must be good! It was easy to make and tasted great! The potatoes were a little dry, so I might try some variations next time. I recommend this recipe! Very good!

very easy! i made mine with ground venison though. i had to find a recipe that i could use it up with. i also used a box of herb and garlic and a box of four cheese instant potatoes to offset the flavor of the meat. i didnt add onions because my husband does not like them, so i used onion powder instead, garlic, seasonings and i had to use mozz cheese because i ran out of cheddar. i also added grated parm cheese to the meat mix. baked as directed and it turned out pretty good! ill be making this whenever deer season comes around

Very easy & and the better half Loved it! I also altered it slightly by adding corn instead of beans, adding jalapenos and garlic to the meat mixture, and layering the meat mixture on the bottom and potatoes on top, and of course cheese on top of that.  I found that layering it gives a more equal proportion of everything in each serving.... Enjoy!

Very good and simple recipe. Did recipe as followed, but added one extra lb of meat and corn. I also used instant potatoes like others had suggested. The taste is really good, but pretty much resembles a stew that I already make. Only difference was it wasnt as soupy as a stew would be!

I make this recipe all the time but with a few changes. I use a can of corn plus the green beans. Sometimes I add regular mac noodles and I layer the ground beef, then tomato soup, then green beans, then corn, then I cover the whole thing with mashed potatoes and sprinkle cheese on top. My family loves it! Great recipe!

I like to add a healthy squirt of ketchup with the tomato soup. Gives it some extra zing. Also I cover the meat with mashed potatoes not just around the outside.

Very soupy the first day.  I would cut down on the tomato soup next time. I also do not understand the point of putting it in such a large pan for the amount of meat there was.  I would decrease the pan size and soup, or increase the amount of meat.  It is much better as leftovers than it is the first day.

Substituted broccoli and carrots for the green beans because I didn't have any on hand, and added 2 cloves of minced garlic when I added the onion.  Also used instant mashed potatoes to speed it up.  EVERYONE loved it!!

Four stars as written, five stars with some changes and additions. I browned the hamburg with chopped onions and garlic. I added a can of condensed tomato and one can of cream of mushroom to the browned beef. I then added 2T of worcestershire to the beef. I poured the beef mixture in the bottom of a 13x9. I then layered canned french style gb and whole kernel corn, both drained on top of the beef. For the mashed potatoes, I used the pre-made, refrigerated kind. I addded 4T of sour cream and a 1/2C of shredded gruyere cheese to potatoes. After I layered the potatoes on top of the veggies, I shredded more gruyere cheese and cheddar cheese. I baked it for the full 1/2H, then broiled it on low for 3 mins. It was very similiar to shepherd's pie but more creamier. My husband suggestion was adding some Durkee Fried Onions to it,  I think it needs more veggies. So, next time I will add a can of carrots and fried onions.

This was good!  I am only giving it 4 stars only because I try to reserve the 5 stars for recipes that blow me away.  It was easy to make and my husband and I liked all of it.  My kids didn't care for the potatoes on top, but liked the beef/green bean mixture.  I also mixed it with 1 can of tomato soup and 1 can of crm of mushroom soup.  I would think that 2 cans of tomato soup would be too runny.

I can say that this is a great way to mix veggies in dinner. I gave 3 stars because I didnt have tomato soup so used tomato sauce and some catchup.  Still very bland though.

I loved this one, it's hearty, comforting and easy. I added garlic to the meat, used one can of mushroom and one of tomato. I used frozen beans (and forgot to cook them first) and they were still good. Sometimes I'm funny about too many canned ingredients. I also put cheese all over the top and not just on the potatoes. Make sure to let the cheese brown a bit.

We called this "favorite casserole" at my house when I was little. I am thrilled to find it on this website. I'm not really a big fan of casseroles now, but this comfort food sounds yummy for this chilly fall day.

O my goodness EXCELLENT!!! This was a huge hit with my husband and kids! Unfortunately I didn't have any tomato soup so I used a can of tomato sauce and a generous squeeze of ketchup and it was simply delicious! Next time we would love to try it with the tomato soup and there will absolutely be a next time!! This was so quick and easy and fits our family's fun loving interest for trying new things! Thanks for sharing!

I have been making this for probably 20 years. My kids grew up eating this at least once a month and it is still one of their very favorites. I omit the onions just because my kids don't like them.

This was surprisingly tasty.  My 2 1/2 even ate it. I did use green beans from the garden, added some garlic powder, and covered the hamburger in cheese too.  Next time, I think I'll make it in a round casserole dish to cover all the hamburger completely.

We were pleasantly suprised, it tasted really good and was  easy to prepare.  I was looking for something wholesome and easy to eat for my 10 month old and thought it would be good for him, not thinking my husband and I would enjoy it as much as we did.  Definitely will become a staple in our house.  only thing I did different was use one can of mushroom soup like others suggested and spiced up the meat a bit.

Yummy and easy recipe. I used a small can of green beans and another of carrots and added some minced garlic when I browned the meat and onion. Next time I might add a little more spices to the meat and vary the veggies.

This wasn't bad whatsoever, but it didn't excite my taste buds. It's quick and easy, especially if you use instant taters. I did not, however, in the future I will because I don't think it would affect the taste at all. I added a can of corn and did the layering suggested by another reviewer...meat mixture, corn/veggies, taters, and cheese.  I'd make again for something wholesome, filling, and easy.

Really liked this recipe.(So did the family) Did change a few things; added yellow bell pepper,extra seasoning(garlic powder, bl.pepper, & season all). I also used corn,& instant garlic & chedder mashed potatoes. I will be making this again. It's also something fairly quick & easy to take to a church potluck.

Like everyone else I added additional spices and the flavor was fantastic. But I'm not sure why no one else has commented about the consistency.  It was hardly thicker than soup.

My husband made this and it turned out fine.  It wasn't anything too exciting.  He used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup in place of a can of tomato soup and added a can of corn.  Milk and butter were added to the potatoes and garlic and basil were added to the meat mixture.  I probably won't make this recipe again...it tasted fine, it just wasn't very exciting.

This recipe was well liked by the family. I did make some changes. I doubled the recipe, used 1 small can of tomato soup and 1 1/2 large can of cream of chicken soup. The other 1/2 can of chicken soup I added to the mashed potatoes. As suggested by someone else, I used corn instead of green beans. I put the hamburger/soup mixture on bottom, then cheese and mashed potatoes on top. I broiled it in the oven until the mashed potatoes were golden brown. Usually when I prepare something new, my husband will say, "I liked it better the last time" or "Not bad if you add lots of margarine, salt and pepper." This time he said that this had really good flavor.

I made this for years for my family growing up after a friend brought it over when my grampa died. Taught my husband to make it when he took over cooking dinner. He makes it with deerburger now, adds garlic, thyme, and basil while browning, uses the cheapest tomato soup I can find, and instant potatoes on top. We love this!

i was looking for something i could "dump" together and this it. my husband looked at it and said im only going to try it cause im starving. he ate half the pie. i did do as others suggested lots of seasoning i also used tomato and cream of potato with a can of mushrooms, im sure it was about the same as cream of mushroom. i also didnt have shredded cheese so i used sliced american. it did not look attractive but was good.

This was delicious.  I only added 1 can of tomato soup because that's all I had.  I added sour cream and garlic powder to the mashed potatoes (I just used instant)... and I covered the whole dish with the potatoes, I think it turned out very well.  Thanks for the great idea!

I'm so happy to have found this recipe again! It was a childhood favorite of mine and now I can share it with my family.  My family looked at the "slop" of a meal, with frowns on there faces, but after one bite they were hooked.

I tried this dish for dinner and my whole family loved it!  It was also very easy to clean up after because while it was baking I was able to clean the worst of the dishes and after dinner was only left with plates and a serving spoon!  Very easy for a busy wife and mother of 3!

This was very bland even though I added chopped garlic and basil like others suggested.  My husband and I each forced down one serving.  The ingredients just didn't go well together.
