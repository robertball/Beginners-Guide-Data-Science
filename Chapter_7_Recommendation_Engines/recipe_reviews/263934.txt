This turned out good. I used a spicy tomato juice and I really liked the way the water chestnuts soaked up the flavor. I did let the water chestnuts cook longer than called for prior to adding the shrimp. I really wanted them to soak up the flavor and they did. It also thickened the sauce nicely which would have been great served over rice but they were great on their own too. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!
