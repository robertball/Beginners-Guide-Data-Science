My family loved this salad. I only had cans of blackeye peas, so used those instead. The taste is wonderful.

Crisp, tangy and fresh.  This bean salad is so scrumptious!  I could eat it every day.  I soak and cook extra beans and freeze them so I can prepare the salad on the spot the next time. Thank you for sharing this recipe, its a keeper.

Beans and vegetables have never been so addictive. I first made this recipe at midday so that the marinade would really seep into the vegetables. By dinnertime, my family had finished it already. We all really enjoy the flavor combination of this salad. It's something different - i.e. refreshing - to take along to a summer barbecue and it is a side dish that works well with both beef and some fish meals. Like another reviewer, I do use canned beans (just make sure to drain and rinse well), so the hardest part is prepping the vegetables. There is only one tiny issue - I still think the dressing is missing an ingredient, but I'm not sure what exactly. Perhaps some lime juice to add a bit more zing (FYI: If you have lemon balm growing in your herb garden, use it) or  another spice in addition to the coriander? If I discover it, I will post accordingly. In the meanwhile, try this recipe; it's wonderful.

As usual I did my share of substitutions for what I had on hand.  Lime for lemon, dried parsley for fresh, cumin for coriander, and Equal for brown sugar. I was happy to put to use the mint growing in the yard. Bean salad of any variety is great in the summer!

I didn't have carrots so left it out, but this salad probably needs it.  I love fresh mint and thought this would jack up the flavor, but it was surprisingly not minty at all.  I also couldn't taste the parsley.  It was a tad citrus-y and a bit sweet, but overall rather bland.  Hubs didn't like it at all.  I thought it was okay but I think I'd need different beans and maybe a bit of a different flavor in the dressing to try it again.  Thanks for the recipe!
