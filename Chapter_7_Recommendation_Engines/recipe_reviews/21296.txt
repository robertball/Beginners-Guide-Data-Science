A fun, tasty recipe! I used small apples, and the pudding batter rose up nearly to the top of them as it baked.  I used whipping cream because there was no milk in the fridge- way more fat and calories, but it sure did taste amazing!  I mixed the nutmeg and some cinnamon into the brown sugar, and added a scoop of flax (to make them "healthy" after all that cream!) The pudding part is like a bread pudding without the bread cubes- it's sliceable and soft.  Don't forget to START THE APPLES BAKING WHILE YOU ARE MAKING THE PUDDING BATTER! I missed that step in the directions, and it will make a difference, as mine took longer than an hour to bake- I had to cover it with foil to keep the pudding part from getting too browned while the apples softened. I will make this again- especially when we are reading (and re-reading) Little House books!

I was reading to my sons farmer boy. After Almonzo talked about eating birds nest pudding I had to look this up. After reading the ingredients I was eager to make it. I had some family over and we all enjoyed this very much. The pudding came out perfectly. Thank you for sharing this recipe.
