I took this to a picnic and received a lot of compliments.  However, I thought it was a little bland, and this is after adding basil, oregano, garlic powder, and more salt and pepper.  I think I will add some cayenne pepper next time and maybe use a salsa instead of the V-8.  I also used venison salami instead of the chicken, which defiantly added to the flavor.

Quick and delicious, very light and refreshing for summertime.  I did not use chicken this time, and it was great without it.  The only change I made was that I didn't have the spicy V8 juice and subbed regular and added a bit of crushed red pepper for the bite.  I think it's also a great recipe you could play around with.  Fresh grated parmesan would have been nice.

Sorry, this sounded so good but it really was rather bland. I even added a few more spices, along with some onion and celery (so it would be closer to the gazpacho I make)  before serving and it still was rather blah :( Not a keeper for me.
