We used this sauce as part of a Watermelon Theme Party (Fresh Watermelon, Watermelon Margaritas, Watermelon Sorbet, etc.) and it was a huge hit!  Substitute this for any rib, chicken, pork glaze/marinade...its great!  Soak ribs in this overnight, use more to cook in the oven over low (300 degrees) heat in foil for three hours, and baste over hickory chips for 15 minutes for perfect, mouth watering, falling-off-the-bone ribs!

I have been cooking a LONG time.  This recipe was not good!  I should have realized, watermelon is almost pure sugar to begin with, but then to add 2 cups!!! of sugar...what a disaster!!!

The barbecue sauce is quite sweet and sticky, but it has an exceptional flavor.  Even though it takes about 5 hours to make, I gave it an overall rating of 5, because of the flavor.  Delicious!!!

Since I retired, I have become the cook in our household.  I like to try different things.  This has good flavor, a little too sweet, but not worth the time and effort it takes.  I followed the recipe exactly, measuring everything.  The consistancy comes out like glue.  It is going to take about 3 hours to clean my barbeque tomorrow.  There are so many better, faster, easier barbeque sauce recipes on the web.

After reading previous reviews I decided to cut the brown sugar in half and I'm glad I did. This was REALLY sweet and if I were to make again I'd cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 cup.Loved the watermelon flavor though. This needs tweaking in my opinion but it is definitely one I'll make again once I have an abundance of watermelon in the garden.

I love sweet barbeque sauces (and my son is allergic to corn, so any storebought sauces with hfcs are not an option for us), so I was really excited to try this recipe.  What a huge disappointment - it was cloyingly sticky sweet, with way too much artificial smoky flavor.  If I were to make it again (which I won't), I would start by leaving the liquid smoke out.  And cutting the brown sugar down a bit.  But even with those changes, I don't think it would be that great, and definitely not worth the work involved.  I have found other from-scratch BBQ sauce recipes that take less work and are much tastier.
