This is a really good recipe.  I followed it pretty much as written but used pepper jack cheese and added a layer of cheese to the top.  It turned out great! Next time I might make the sausage the night before and just throw it together in the morning.

So good! I made this a little deconstructed since I was cooking for just me (2 servings). I had some Jimmy Dean turkey sausage links (two, thawed in the microwave) that I chopped up and tossed into the grits once they were done. I added a handful of shredded cheddar (in place of the gouda) and scrambled two eggs up with a little hot sauce, salt and pepper. The grit mixture went in the bottom of a bowl with the scrambled eggs on top. SO good! I will definitely make this again for a crowd. Thanks for the recipe!

These were good, but I will not use spicy sausage next time.  We love spicy food, but it took over the dish.

Quick, easy, and delicious!  I substituted Mexican melting cheese (Panela), since Wal-mart didn't have Gouda.  Sprinkled a little sharp cheddar on top - otherwise, followed the recipe exactly - oh, and I used regular sausage instead of Spicy.  You know it's a hit when people request the recipe!

All I can say is "Wow", these were great and the whole family really enjoyed this for breakfast.  Never thought my son would eat this due to the texture of the grits.  He even called me the best cook in the world.  Have made twice so far and used regular grits and cheddar instead of Gouda ( Gouda was a little pricey).

Yum!  I used regular sausage and omited the hot sauce due to having small kids.  I didn't have Gouda but used cheddar, mont. jack and colby mix.  This was so good.  I made homemade bread with it.  My diet took a day off today....any maybe tomorrow for leftovers!

Made this last night and all I can say is that we all loved it.  I made this as written and I wouldn't change a thing. My oldest son loves breakfast for dinner so this will be made often. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I halved this recipe and used pre-cooked turkey sausage. I also used mild cheddar cheese because that's all I had. My husband loved it.

Made this and let it cool, then I cut into rectangles and froze them. Great for a quick grab-n-go breakfast; just nuke each rectangle until warm!

I had some grits I needed to use up and came across this recipe.  It was super easy to throw together and came out delicious!  I baked mine in an 8x11 pan and I'm fairly certain I used more than 4 oz of cheese.  My husband and I loved this for our breakfast!  Will definitely make it again.

These were fantastic!  I made these, with about 5 other dishes, for my boyfriend's birthday brunch.  This is the only dish he ate seconds of...he even asked for more the next morning.  I will be making these often.  I think the gouda is the key!

Very good!  I wasn't sure about how my family would react, but my husband had thirds, and even my picky 5, 3, and 2 year old kids ate it!  I only had cheddar/jack cheese on hand and used that, which caused it to need a little salt.  But I don't really think I'd change anything!  Super good as left overs, too!

Loved this!  We are a family of seven, so we doubled the grits (and used polenta instead of grits) and added a bit of extra cheese, but not more meat or butter.  We ate almost a whole 9X13 pan of it for supper!  Thanks for another winner!

I love cheese grits and using Gouda puts this over the top!  I pretty much followed the directions, except used beef sausage and about 6 oz. Gouda.

This is such a great dish. I rated it 4-stars instead of 5-stars die Due to the martyr vacations it with minced garlic & 4 Oz green Chiles. In addition to Gouda cheese add a little shredded cheddar cheese also. Season grits with salt and pepper.

A good warm, different than usual, breakfast for a cloudy day. 
I thought it needed more flavor, maybe the garlic other reviewers have mentioned, but my guy loved it. So four stars. 
Thanks.

Yummy and filling breakfast dish, made with 1/2 wheatlets and 1/2 cornmeal (we don't have grits in Canada) and it turned out great.

I will make this again, I love having warm casseroles for breakfast!

I made this as written, but with a mix of hot and mild sausage, cheddar cheese (it's what I had), and scaled down for two servings. It got a big thumbs up from my hubby, who said it tasted very like a dish he often orders from that big waffle chain restaurant that we don't have in our town, which is great, cause that's what I was shooting for. I'm personally not terribly fond of grits, but I'll make it again for my hubby every couple of months or so, especially for cold winter mornings. I like the idea of being able to make it ahead and bake it after church. I also like the fact that it's not terribly high in calories for a relatively decadent dish. Thanks for sharing.

I love this recipe, great to make in ramekins and reheat in the mornings before work.  Very tasty!

This turned out ok. It was filling for sure but it was dry and tough and lacked flavor. I even used half mild/spicy sausage. I'll stick with the 'Cheesy Ham & Grits Breakfast Casserole' from this site.

We have made this twice.  Used sharp cheddar and Gouda.  We also added a pinch of salt while grits cooked.  Only added a couple of dashes of hot sauce.  We mix everything in the pan with the grits.  It's fabulous and savory comfort food.

My husband went crazy over these.  I did change things up a little and used cheddar cheese and pepper jack instead of what the recipe calls for.

Comfort food at its finest.  Just don't heat your milk too high cause it will boil over fast!  I added onion powder to mine as suggested, for more flavor.  Soooo good!
