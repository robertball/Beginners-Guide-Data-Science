This was the perfect summer dessert! We made it for a dinner party and everyone absolutely loved it. Parchment paper is a must for this recipe. The dough will stick to the paper but will loosen itself once you bake and cool. I would recommend dividing the dough evenly into four sections. The filling takes about ten minutes of mixing before it reaches the right consistency, so make sure it isn't undermixed or you'll end up with a gooey mess instead of a light, fluffy filling. Also, it took way more than 8 to 10 minutes to bake each part of the dough. 
This recipe was so wonderful without any modifications and you can use almost any kind of fruit for the filling.

Just made this, and we haven't eaten it yet, but it really looks beautiful and i think it's going to taste delicious!  I only used 3 layers because my 4th one broke :P but it still looks great.

Big hit!  Only change I made was to add vanilla into the batter and the whipped cream.  Next time I wil add lemon zest to the batter

This recipe looks beautiful, and it's fun to make.  The tarts came out surprisingly well, although they were difficult to spread out.  

My problem with the recipe was how painfully sweet the entire thing was.  The tart circles were extremely sweet, and the whipped cream was achingly sweet.  There's way, way too much sugar in this recipe!  I think, if I make this again, I'll cut the granulated sugar in the whipped cream from 1/2 cup to 1/4 cup.

I made this for the 4th of July dinner at work.  It was a huge hit. I didn't even have crumbs to take home.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out beautiful.
