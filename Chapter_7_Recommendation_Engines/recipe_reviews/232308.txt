Delicious.  Honey was substituted for agave and cranberries for cherries because those were on hand.  Thanks Ali

These are delish! I used maple syrup for sweetener and omitted the brown sugar, otherwise followed the recipe. Definitely better than store bought bars. Also easy peasy - which is a major selling point of any recipe as far as I am concerned.

I made these gluten-free with coconut flour instead of all-purpose, and messed up the recipe halfway through, and they STILL turned out delicious. I substituted dried blueberries for the cherries, and left out the shredded coconut, since these were for a work function and I know a lot of people don't like the texture. I got a huge number of compliments from a lot of coworkers, even ones who AREN'T vegan or gluten-intolerant. :)

I inadvertently left out brown sugar and the bars were very good still.

I subbed honey for agave and dried figs for cherries. They're so easy to make, taste just right for us (because we like low sugar desserts) and are so healthy that you practically feel the halo  growing round your head as you eat !! I can't wait to try it out with different nuts/ dry fruit combinations!!

I will defiantly be making this again! This is the second time I have made these and they are incredible. HIGHLY suggest. The second time I made them I doubled the recipe and removed the coconut for a better result. (  I just don't like coconut. ) thanks for the recipient!

These  turned out delicious! I also substituted cranberries for the cherries since I bought them in bulk and they were cheaper.  I used honey because I want to go vegan but wanted to use up the honey that I had left.

My son loves them, and my friend from church too. I did double the coconut, cherries and chocolate, also adding an extra cup of oats. We used quick oats. I opted for 2-3 teaspoons of vanilla almond milk for moisture to compensate the extra oats, replacing the vanilla extract. Defiantly will make again and try other items like raisins vs cherries and maybe Peanut Butter vs chocolates. The possibilities are endless with this snack!

I followed the instructions (but didn't have a 7 x 12 pan, only 9 x 13) delicious. The pan size is important, might use my 8 x 8 next time. Very good and quite easy.

I used whole wheat flour and honey but otherwise followed the recipe as shown. The only thing I could smell when this came out of the oven was the flour. I was hopeful they would still taste ok but nope, dry and muted flavor that tasted of flour.  Thankfully my husband works with guys who will pretty much eat anything otherwise these would have gone in the trash. I have been making a lot of different granola bar recipes lately and this goes in the do not make again pile.

Love this granola recipe that does not need dairy or oil! I made it for my daughters first swim meet and shared with friends to rave reviews. I did not have the correct pan size, but it was solid enough to shape into the perfect sized rectangle in a larger pan. 
The mix looked dry, but it baked up perfect with enough moisture while still holding its shape. Making right now for a weeks worth of quick snack on the way to swim practice.
