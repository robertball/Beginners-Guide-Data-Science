Some cautions: drinking too much molasses can have a laxative effect. (Blackstrap molasses at least gives you a level of very absorbable iron for your blood if you ladies feel anemic.)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The previous comments lead me to suspect they're imagining the incorrect form of chicory. 

Chicory root is the correct form--a brown, woody/grainy type of product that looks similar to ground-up coffee beans. In other words, NOT the chicory that's a leafy green, a somewhat bitter type of lettuce for salads or soups). Chicory root has a beautiful, true-blue flower on it.

Chicory root mellows out coffee's bitterness, rather than making coffee moreso. You won't find a bitter cup of coffee in New Orleans because most coffee served there is creole coffee.

Slaves brought it with them to this country from Africa. When coffee was among the many goods that were harder to get during the Civil War, Southerners made-do by using chicory root.

I didn't have chicory coffee, I used a dark blend coffee. I also added a little more milk, only because I like it that way. I know it's not the same but even so, I enjoyed this very much. This reminds me of my Grandmother. She uses molasses in everything, including coffee. It's like nothing I've had before. Very good. Next time, I think I'd add just a touch more molasses.

This is a simple, easy recipe.  Chicory is a bitter herb, and I'm not really accustomed to it.  I'll have to get used to the drink before I can truly enjoy it.  Even with the molasses to sweeten this, the bitterness is still there.  Like I said, I'll have to drink a lot of this before I'm used to it!

I have sweetened my caf√© au lait with molasses for decades, never knew it was called Creole Coffee.  One of my favorite beverages!  This recipe is spot-on. :-)
