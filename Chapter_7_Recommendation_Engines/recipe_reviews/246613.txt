I make one of these every day using unsweetened almond milk, frozen blueberries and strawberries, a banana and add a tablespoon of PBfit (powdered peanut butter..85% less fat).
I have at times added other fruit that might be in season, but always add the PBfit, it gives an amazing flavor and protein.

Yummy. I like a green smoothie every day so I  added a handful of baby kale and spinach. Also increased almond milk to full cup and added 1 cup of water (I always start with 2 cups of water for my smoothies). 24 ounces of goodness!

So yummy! I added 1/4 cup of vanilla Greek yogurt to mine and used frozen mixed berries in place of blueberries.  I also used unsweetened almond milk. I will make this one again and again!!

Very good and filling.  I also added some protein powder and used only half of a banana.  I like the taste the almond butter gives!  Will make again.

Delicious and easy smoothie! I added just a pinch of cinnamon to it, and that really added a nice flavor. This makes for a quick breakfast too! Thanks for the recipe!

I did not have almond butter so i used regular smooth peanut butter, and did not add water.Always on the lookout for a good smoothie and this one did not disappoint. Thank you for the recipe.

I totally loved this recipe.  Initially I made it just as written.  Lately I've been adding some zucchini to my green smoothies and have been very pleased with the results.

I didn't have any almond butter so I used peanut butter. I only used half a banana since I don't love bananas and I used a cup of almond milk and some frozen mango with the blueberries. It was really good, very sweet. I can't even imagine how sweet it would have been if I'd used a whole banana!

Just made this.  Great meal replacement.  I added a bit of honey for some sweetness.  Used mixed berries instead of just blueberries.  Awesome!

I use no banana and instead add 2-5 strawberries and a handful of spinach. I have it for breakfast with eggs or banana bread for a full meal!

I made this, but added 2-3 T. of white kidney beans for protein, as I wanted it to be a breakfast smoothie. It tasted quite yummy!
Then I made one with frozen raspberries. It was a wee bit sour due to the tart berries, so I added 2 t. of honey. I probably would've liked a T of honey, but I'm diabetic and trying to curb the sweet teeth my mouth is full of..  
Also, I'm trying a technique of freezing smoothies in Zip-lok bags, so that is why this picture may look a little odd.

Good base recipe. The almond milk takes your smoothie from ordinary to so yummy and tasteful. I would have never tried it. Iâ€™m sure any fruit can be used. I chose strawberries. I added ice as I used fresh fruit and decreased milk portion to 1/2 cup and added water to keep the calories lower. Thanks for the concept.

Super tasty! Used banana I had frozen before it turned bad, increased the almond milk to one cup, and added some collagen protein powder and chia seeds. Great consistency and kind of tastes like a liquified PB&J!

Tastes great but it could use a little more protein. Might try adding some protein powder to it. Also the color in the picture is off. With a full cup of blueberries it's a much darker purple than what is shown.

I use unsweetened vanilla almond milk. Can't beat 30 calories per 8 ozs!  Also sub peanut butter (staple in the house) instead of almond butter. Frozen berries along with a banana make for a fast low cal on the go breakfast. I think I'll add some chia seeds at the suggestion of another smoothie buddy.

I make a smoothie similar to this.  I make my own almond milk with blanched almonds (1/4 cup) and 1/2 cup of water.  I add frozen strawberries and banana.

Delicious. As usual. I had to use half strawberries and half blueberries. Still good though. :-)
