I have to say I was disappointed with this recipe.  The seasonings smelled very good.  Everything seemed fine when I stirred after 20 minutes, so I set the timer for 8 more minutes to be on the cautious side, but the damage was already done after 28 minutes in the oven.  The spices were burnt!  The nuts were a little too.  Check the pecans more frequently than I did, so you don't make the same mistake.

A great recipe!  I omitted the salt since the nuts were already salted.  I also decreased the oven temp. to 250 degrees since I was concerned about burning and was also making a batch of Cinnamon-Roasted Almonds in another pan so it was very handy to make them both at the same time.  Makes a great gift idea- just be sure to make extra for yourself!!!

Very good!  I use these on top of green salads.  Mine were ready in only 20 minutes though, possibly because I used a very dark baking sheet.

This is exactly what I was looking for.  After reading the reviews I was careful not to overcook them.  I used a Pampered Chef stone and they turned out perfect.  I took them out after about 27 minutes.  Be sure to check on them every 8 minutes or so.

Yum!  Have made these several times, and were wonderful each time.  I like them a little spicy, so make them just as the recipe says.

Very good - even better with 1 tsp soy sauce in place of salt, and cayenne instead of red pepper.

Fantastic! Followed the recipe exactly and it was very good. The next time I made it (about 15 minutes after the first batch was gone... LOL) I added a teaspoon of Louisiana Hot Sauce... WOW..... really good and highly recommended if you would like to "kick" the recipe up a notch. Thank you for sharing a great snack recipe.

Hot & Spicy Pecan Haiku: "These were pretty good. Left 'dorito' dust on hands. Lick your fingers clean!" I think I would've rather mixed the chili powder into the butter/seasoning mix in an attempt to avoid the powdery dust that the pecans left on my fingers after every bite. I followed the recipe, but dropped the oven temp to 250, shaking the pan frequently to avoid burning. It was a nice way to jazz up pecans, but in all honesty, I think if I were to make it again, I would either skip the chili powder all-together and increase the cayenne (as well as possibly adding coriander, onion powder, or paprika), or as mentioned, stirring the chili powder into the butter/worcestershire b4 tossing everything together.

These were good and really easy. I followed the recipe exactly. I felt like they may need just a little something else, but no idea what. I may add a bit more worcestershire & cayenne next time - because, yes, there will probably be a next time.

Good, but as written would have been way too much chili powder for me. I added more garlic & cayenne & less chili, but it's really just a taste preference. I also am out of butter so I used a bit of olive oil.

Absolutely loved these! Sprayed with butter pam instead of real butter, then moistened with worchestershire before sprinkling the powdered spices on.  Spicey but not hot, lots of raves at the potluck! will make again and again! maybe try with almonds, but the pecans were wonderful

I really loved this recipe, but agreed with a previous reviewer that "something" was missing.  I added a heaping tablespoon of brown sugar to the butter & spice mixture & that did it--all the tastebuds are engaged and awake, but without an obviously sweet taste.

Also, I used my own blend of chili powder (cinnamon, ginger, cumin, and ground chipotle chili) and it turned out beautifully.  Be sure to use good-quality spices because they really do get a chance to shine in this recipe!

I made these for the first time last night and they didn't turn out as great as I expected. They taste okay but I will make some changes next time. I made a double batch, half pecans and half almonds. The seasonings didn't stick to the almonds at all; most of the seasoning is in the bottom of the bowl - next time I will be super careful when stirring the nuts, maybe that will help. I thought the chili powder was way too much - that is all I taste when I eat them! I will decrease that next time and probably increase the cayenne, Worcestershire, and garlic powder - I also added onion powder, because I love it.  The nuts didn't burn, I cooked them at 250 degrees for the first 20 min, then upped it to 300 degrees for the last 10 min (stirred every 8-10 min). I will definitely try these again!

Spicy, but no too hot.  I always get compliments when I prepare these,  These are excellent for outdoor parties. But, watch humidity.  They can loose their curnchiness on humid days.

Yummy!  Made exactly as recipe directed, but cooked only 15 minutes, stirring every 5.  Very good.  My husband took them to an A.S.I.D. Christmas party and they were gone literally in minutes.  Thanks for posting!

That much chili powder scared me so I halved it.  The nuts were good but really nothing special.  I think I'll stick to butter and salt next time.

We just tried this recipe, and love it.  We are going to make some more tonight.  We finished this batch in about 3 days.  This time we will double the recipe.  We have no picture, because we ate them all.  Not many grocery stores sell tasty pecans, so that makes this recipe a keeper.

These smelled wonderful while cooking, but honestly were very bland to the taste.  I would make these again with additional spices added to make them actually "hot and spicy."

Delish, made em for super bowl sunday (unfortunately the dogs got ahold of the first batch so I had to make another).  I used mixed nuts.  No problems with burning here although they did not really dry out either.

I didn't have chili powder, so I substituted 1/4 tsp of curry powder and 1 tsp paprika. SO GOOD. Not too spicy. Just be sure to line your pan with foil or parchment because of the red stickiness. 

I'm looking forward to trying the original version next time. Thanks for the good, easy recipe.

These were okay, but the chili powder was a bit much.  My niece loved them, though.  I gave her the whole batch. I guess I just prefer a different texture to the coating.

A real winner here - just the right amount of "hot" & "spice" to make you want more. Get ready to make a 2nd batch!

Easy and good. I wish they were a tiny bit spicier though, so next time I will add more red pepper. I only had to cook them about 22 minutes and they were done perfectly.

I concur with other cooks who advise to lower temp.  Consider a test run with small batch first.  If you have unsatisfactory results at 300 degrees, reduce temp to 275 on successive batch, and watch carefully between the 20 minute -30 minute cooking time so as not to over bake.  It may seem as though nuts are not finished because coating seems moist, but as nuts cool, the coating congeals and coats well.  Stir nuts frequently as they cool out of oven so they do not adhear to baking sheet.  You can make this recipe work with practice.  Try honey or brown sugar if you want sweet and spicy!

Although I kept stirring, I should have taken them out much earlier or turned the oven heat WAY down.  Even though they looked edible, although over cooked when I first took them out, after they cooled they were totally inedible--spices were so burnt.  Bummer because nuts are so expensive!

A little overwhelming a first (although that could have been due to the massive amounts of salt I put in them) these mellowed out after a day or two to be absolutely delicious!

OK.  Maybe a bit too greasy, coating didn't stick real well.  baked at 250 and checked every 7-8 minutes so they didn't burn.  added a teaspoon of hot sauce and omitted salt since the nuts were salted.  used mixed nuts

This recipe was pretty good. I used mixed nuts instead of pecans and I doubled it. After tasting the seasoning once it was on the nuts, I thought it needed a little something, so I added some of Penzey's Old World seasoning (paprika, salt, sugar, celery, garlic, onion, black pepper, parsley, dill seed, caraway seed, tumeric, dill weed, bay leaf, marjoram, thyme, savory, basil, and rosemary.) This helped tremendously. Next time I may just use this entirely. Has anyone tried using olive oil instead of the butter?

I made this recipe twice over the holidays and it got rave reviews each time! The first time I didn't have chili powder so I used a combination of Hot Shot(a blend of red and black peppers you buy in spice isle) and ground chipolte pepper. Either way, recipe was great!

Easy recipe, and great if you don’t over bake !  I cooked mine in the toaster oven at the stated temp and they were done in 18 minutes.  They had a crispy bite, but still had the nutty texture I wanted on the inside.

This is my go-to recipe for pecans! We buy the big bags from Sam's club. I follow the recipe but am heavy handed with the spices, especially the red pepper flakes! I also add a good sized tbsp of brown sugar and a heavy shake or 3 of ground cayenne pepper. I snack on these and use them in salads. If I bring then to work my colleagues go crazy over them!

This is so easy and so tasty. Only comment I would make is to be aware of the heat in the chile powder and gauge how much cayenne to add based on that. We like it with lots of heat but I tone it down if I am serving it to people who prefer it milder. It is just so easy and  quick to make.

I've made these several times, starting with pecans straight from the shell. The first time I was conservative with the pepper and chili powder, afraid I was about to ruin my pecans; these aren't the spices I'd usually choose. But by the second time, and every time since (half a dozen times by now), I've followed this to the letter and they've come out perfectly. Perhaps if you started with store-bought pecans that were drier you'd need to adjust the cooking time or temp, but for just-shelled pecans the directions and ingredients are perfect.
