Although I was put off by the name (I don't like salmon) my husband was intrigued! I made them for Easter dinner and my husband, mother, and mother-in-law thought they were great! My hubby said he would give it 5 stars - very creamy with just a light taste of salmon, more of a cream cheese taste (so don't be afraid to try them!)

I expected to like these a lot more because I love smoked salmon, and I really like smoked salmon cream cheese. Once everything was put together, I thought they were good, but not anything I'd likely make again, at least not without some tweaking. This is a great base recipe though. It definitely needs "something", I'm just not sure what. Salt and pepper helped once I added them. The salmon taste is very mild like the other reviewer mentioned, so don't be afraid to try this recipe. I think these would be quite tasty with capers.  I had to add in extra mayo because the filling was too dry.  The are definitely quick and easy though!
