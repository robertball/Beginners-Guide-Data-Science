Made as written and this was excellent. I originally forgot the cilantro and realized it as soon as I took the first bite. In doing so I have to say that if you left out the cilantro and added a bit of taco seasoning  you'd end up with a pretty close knock off of Frito Lay's original flavored bean dip in a can. I love cilantro and enjoyed it in this dip but for those who don't, it was good without it too.

Easy to make, but bland. Probably will not make again.

very good, I used dry pintos cooked and added a tsp of sugar with extra jalape√±os and onion/garlic powder.
