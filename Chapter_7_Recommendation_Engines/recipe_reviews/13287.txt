I love Tuscan White Bean soup. This recipe is a good base, however many of the suggested modifications should be considered. Chicken or vegetable broth, extra garlic, and extra thyme & rosemary. I prefer using broccoli over spinach for much more taste. 

As a final touch, three necessities:

1. Fresh Parsley! About a handful chopped. Really adds a fresh taste.

2. Good Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Stir in about a 1/4 cup at the very end. Can't make a decent italian soup without using a decent olive oil.

3. And finally, some freshly grated quality parmesan cheese on top. None of that store shelf canned stuff. Good cheese goes a long, long way.

Only an average, 3-star recipe as written with obvious flaws, but I saw its potential to become something wonderful so I made this knowing I would be putting my spin on it.  I can say for certain that Italians wouldn't use vegetable oil, so it wouldn't be used in soup either...change to olive oil.  The soup looked like it needed a serious boost of flavor, so I started by using some homemade chicken broth I had in the freezer that also had pieces of chicken in it - and no water. I didn't understand why the submitter chose to dilute her soup with water!   I also sauteed some chopped bacon (more flavor!) in a little olive oil, then added the onions, celery and extra garlic and thyme.  I think these changes really did the trick because this turned out to be really outstanding! I served it with a mix of freshly grated Parmesan and Romano cheeses, then gave it a finish of a drizzle of white truffle oil,  which took this over the top!  So with a couple of small but important changes this is definitely a 5-star soup!

Wonderful with the following additions:
double garlic,l/4 more beans, use chix broth in place of water, add onion salt and chix boullion to taste, add 3 teaspoons fresh Rosemary,double the lemon juice. Cut up your spinich about 3/4" wide by 3/4" or you'll end up with long strings hanging from your spoon.  Made such a hit last winter at a church supper months ago and I'm  still being asking me for the recipe.

Being Italian, I *always* add more galic than recommended.  This recipe is no exception.  I used 4 good sized cloves instead of the one suggested.  This is a variation of something I grew up with, which my mom affectionately called "greens & beans".  It was more of two side dishes sort of put together; not a soup.  Very, very much like mom's taste-wise.  Super easy and warming on a cold evening.  Served up with some chunky bread and a glass of wine ~ fantastic!  Another suggestion; in addition to the parmesan cheese on top, drizzle evoo (extra virgin olive oil) on top and add more fresh cracked pepper...delish!

I loved this soup. I added 4c.fat free/low sodium chix broth. I also pureed 1 can of beans with more chix broth instead of the water. I sauteed the onions,celery, and 2 leeks in evoo first. I also added a box of frozen spinach. Great texture with the pureed and whole beans. Lots of fiber and healthy, I sprinkled mine with red pepper flakes and pecorino romano cheese!

This is a delicious soup with the modifications I included, some of which were suggested by other reviewers.  I soaked 1 cup of cannelini beans in water the night before and simmered the beans for about an hour until soft.  I added the thyme to the vegetables as I was sauteing them in olive oil. If it's a good olive oil, the taste is hard to beat.  I added 3 tsp. or chicken base along with the vegetables and a TB. of tomato paste.  I used a hand blender to blend the soup and then added a handful of macaroni.  I did not add any salt as there's a lot of salt in the chicken base.  A very satisfying soup.  Thanks for the contribution.

This was really good! The lemon juice added a nice tang and brightened it up. I followed the suggestion to use a submersion blender, don't think I'll do that next time because it didn't get it as smooth as I would have like without breaking all the beans up. I also used some frozen chopped spinach and this worked well. I will definately make this again!

I loved this recipe. I added ( but didn't need too )smoked turkey sausage. A very healthy creamy soup.

I, too, took some advice from other reviewers.  I used olive oil, added chicken, and used only chicken stock-no water.  I also added a fair amount of garlic pepper mix, a bay leaf, Italian seasoning, and a pinch of cayenne pepper.  When it had simmered for a while, I added the spinach to wilt.  Finally, in went the lemon juice and the sprinkle of Parmesan.  I saw no need to blend the soup.  Wonderful flavor.  We ate it with buttered crusty rolls.  Molto bello dish!

I love this soup! I didn't have white kidney beans, so I substituted garbanzo beans. Italian seasoning provided fabulous flavor and chopped tomato gave this recipe color! Whole wheat rotini pasta is the perfect filler. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe should specify WHITE kidney (cannelini) beans, otherwise there is the problem with the tough skins on the red variety that don't want to blend.  The 5 stars I'm giving are based on these changes I made: add 1 can roasted garlic diced tomatos, 1 tbs. tomato paste, 1 tbs. chopped fresh rosemary, 1 tsp. dried rubbed sage, increase the garlic, and don't use the thyme.  I also agree with another reviewer that another can of beans is needed, although I just cut back on 1 cup of the liquid instead.  I used all broth instead of the water.  This recipe as is inspired me to experiment, and I think the spinach is the best part.  Thanks!

This is a really yummy soup! I made a couple changes for more flavor; I used two cloves of garlic instead of one, and doubled the amount of thyme. I also added salt to taste, as it was a little bland. I loved the addition of the lemon juice in this recipe, as it gave a unique flavor twist that was very tasty. I used a handheld immersion blender to blend the soup, and was a little disappointed by the result, as it was not very smooth. Next time, I think I'll blend it until smooth in my Vitamix. Altogether, though, I really like this recipe and will make it again. Thanks for sharing!

Yummy! I followed some advice from other commenters and added some additional garlic and swapped out the water for extra stock.  I also added some turkey bacon at the end. Will definitely make again!

Pretty good. I found it a little bland, even though I used the juice of half a lemon and zested the lemon rind as well. If I had to do it over, I would increase the garlic and thyme as well. I also used an entire bunch of fresh spinach, and it was WAY too much (and I love spinach)...I was getting whole mouthsful of nothing but spinach, so better to cut that in half. But tasty overall, and will make again with alterations.

I wouldn't change or add a thing to the recipe.

I am always happy to find quick, healthy recipes like this. I used olive oil for flavor, more thyme and garlic,low-sodium organic chicken broth. The soup was a tad thin for my liking however it did thicken up when stored in the fridge overnight.

Amazing!!!!  Followed the suggestions of others and added more garlic and fresh chopped rosemary.  Also added more lemon juice (almost a full lemon).  Used extra chicken broth instead of water and added turkey sausage.  Wish I would have added another can of beans like other reviewers suggested.  Used a handheld immersion blender instead of regular blender.  I was afraid this would be bland, but it is DEFINITELY not!!!  This will be added to our regular dinner rotation!

I made this with only minor modifications. I'm trying to save on groceries so I made it with dried white navy beans. It took about an hour to simmer to cook the dried beans after soaking. It was delicious. I'll definitely be making this often. It is economical and healthy too.

I used this as my basic recipe but I also used a leftover smoked ham bone.  Instead of spinachy I used escarole - it is much heartier.  I gave to this friends that eat and make a lot od soup.  They both raved and were so impressed!

Just made this one and added finely chopped leek to the onion, celery and garlic.The soup tastes great and just as some other reviewers suggested, it helps to add some fresh ground pepper along with the Parmesan when serving. Will make again.

Sorry, but I did not care for this soup at all.When I read the recipe I thought it sounded bland, but because of the reviews I thought I would try it anyway. I added two boullion cubes and extra garlic, but I just don't think it was worth the effort.To those of you who did like it, I suggest adding some ditalini or other small macaroni to make it heartier.

Yum! Super easy to make, creamy and light.  I will probably double this recipe next time, as there was almost no leftovers after my husband and I had it for dinner.

This soup was absolutely delicious.  My entire family loved it.  My children couldn't believe that they had just eaten beans and spinach. I think it would be a great soup even if you didn't have any spinach in it.

All  you need to complete this recipe is a crusty loaf of bread and a good bottle of wine.  I only used a handful of spinach.

This is a delicious soup.  Having to blend the soup is a little time consuming and adds a lot more cleanup, but it's really worth it in taste.  I left out the thyme and it was still very flavorful.  It goes wonderfully with slightly stale white bread.  Almost a meal.

I was really happy with the flavor of this soup (substituted fake chicken stock as we're all veggies), but the texture was strange. I couldn't get my handy immersion blender to blend up the bean skin. So I finally had to strain the soup through a colander, which resulted in a wonderful smooth soup. Topped with mozzerella as we were out of parmesan. Crowd pleaser.

A delicious recipe.  I do not own a blender;  extracting the two
cups of vegetables and mashing them into a paste with a fork
worked well instead.  I am a novice cook and this recipe
yielded extremely tasty soup the first time.

I was thinking of adding a little Worstershire next time.  This
would balance the hearty bean flavor with some tartness.

Yummy! I have made this soup twice, once with linguisa and once with chicken Italian sausage. Also, I had to make it with only one can of white kidney beans and one can of regular white beans (the store ran out of the white kidney beans). Both versions were wonderful. I also think that it would be good without the sausage.

I loved this soup with a couple modifications. I used no water and all chicken broth. Also chopped up a pound of cooked hot italian  sausage and added it at the end with the spinach. Served with a drizzle of olive oil. Very delicious and will definitely make again!

This came out pretty good, although I think I added a little too much black pepper, even for my taste.  (I'm not used to measuring ingredients for soup.)  I did add 4 cloves of garlic, and used extra virgin olive oil, which I think was a good idea.  will make again.

I love this.  Granted, I haven't put the spinach in yet, but I can tell it's going to be wonderful once the flavors meld.  As written, I can see where it'd be a little bland ... but everyone's tastes are different and the concept itself is simple and perfect.  I did omit the water and used all chicken broth.  I also used my own pre-cooked cannelli (sp) beans (yeah - the white kidney ones).  Threw in extra garlic and then a chunk of parmesan cheese rind for added depth of flavor.  *IF* I had had an open tube of tomato paste, I think I might have thrown a tablespoon of that in as well.  But I didn't (shrug).  I will next time (grin).

Basic's of soup alright, but needed a large amount of modifying to make it a 5 star recipe.  We used EVOO instead of vegetable oil,we used more garlic and only a half of a sweet onion.  We also used less liquid, using only 2 cans of chicken Broth and no water. I also cut up the spinach and did not use as much as was called for in the recipe.  I did not use the Thyme or lemon juice, but used crushed red pepper and rosemary for spices.  Also we used two different varieties of white beans, and we did not puree any of the broth and beans, with less liquid it thickened enough for our liking.

This is a healthy and simple soup that you can easily modify to suit your taste.  I added more spices than it called for, as I think it would be pretty bland as written.

Absolutely yummy! I've made this several times and have served it to guests and neighbors. Everyone loves it! So comforting! I followed some of the suggestions - didn't dilute with water, if I felt it needed more liquid I added more stock.  I use frozen spinach instead of fresh because I've always got that on hand. I definitely add more garlic! And I sautee the veggies first.  I also add ground italian sausage if I want a more 'meaty' meal, but even without, this is a very hearty dish!

My review is for this recipe as written. I would suggest using all broth over the water as the base was a little 'thin' tasting. Otherwise it was quite nice.

It was a decent soup, a little on the bland side for my tastes.  It is incredibly healthy and is good for those that enjoy milder flavored soups.

Tasty! I didn't bother doing any of the blender stuff, though - I just left it all whole and simmered together and thought it was yummy. I did make a few changes, but I don't think they were so radical that it ended up being a different recipe, so I'll still rate/comment.  I reduced the recipe to 2 servings, added ground chicken, forgot to buy celery so I added celery seed, skipped the water, and simply added enough low sodium veggie broth to cover the other ingredients. It ended up being thick and stew-like, which I liked. I did have to add more seasonings in the end to give it a little more kick flavor-wise, but I tried rosemary (like other reviewers suggested) in one bowl and didn't care for it, so I ended up just adding more pepper as well as some garlic powder. Definitely hearty and healthy, so I found this very satisfying and will most certainly make it again. Thanks, colleenlora!

I was looking for something different to make for my weekday lunches and this is it! Flavorful, fragrant, filling without making you feel stuffed and/or bloated mid-day. The addition of the lemon gives it just the right amount of tang and the simplicity of the ingredients combines to make one powerful combination of tastes. The only change to the actual recipe I made was I used all chicken broth in place of the water, and I might have added a handful more of spinach.

Yummy!   I LOVE having soup -so I am always looking for a new soup recipe.  This one will become a regular.  I like that it is easy to add on to.  I added some ham.  Oh, I did make a little mistake, I added about a 1 TBL of thyme, but I still thought that it was great.

Great soup that has a gourmet look and taste to it. I loved it the first time and then the 2nd time added rosemary. That was a BIG mistake! It tastes much better without it and I would suggest a 3rd can of beans.

Very good!  I was looking for recipes that included spinach, and came across this one.  I took some other reviewers' suggestions - doubled the garlic, added extra thyme and some rosemary.  I also used an immersion blender to puree.  I may try adding some cooked chicken next time, but this is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

This soup was great.  I made it during a huge snow storm last night, and my fiance and I loved it.  I made a few changes, I added more celery, more garlic, and more thyme, then followed the recipe as written.  What an excellent way to warm a cold snowy evening.  Thanks!

Great soup!  I modified the recipe by substituting the water with Chicken broth.  My husband enjoyed this soup and it is healthy too.

Delicious!  Very hearty and filling.  I took the advice of the previous reviewers and made the following changes:  I added 1 can roasted garlic diced tomatos and 1 tbs. tomato paste, and used all broth instead of the water.  I also used the suggestion to add fresh rosemary, which was a wonderful addition.  My family loved it and I'm sure I'll be making it again!  Thanks for the recipe!

One of my favorites & my boyfriend's too. I've made this more times than I can count. Very quick to make; I use an immersion blender to puree the beans. I add at least one more can of beans, sometimes two.

Even though this soup has gotten nothing but great reviews I thought it was just O.K. It was flavorless.  I would not make it again.  There are much better recipes out there that are very similar.

This soup is so easy and very delicious! I had some ground turkey and added little turkey meatballs to this soup ( my mother used to make a similar soup with these little polpetinas ) I mixed the ground turkey with grated pecorino Romano cheese, fresh parsley, a beaten egg, some garlic powder and fresh ground pepper. Before adding the spinach as the recipe calls for, i added the little turkey meatballs to the soup to cook which took about 8 minutes. Check to see that they are cooked all the way through and not still pink. Then I added the spinach and lemon juice. Great recipe to start with and it inspired me to add my mama’s polpetinas!

Like others I used olive oil instead of vegetable  oil and chicken broth instead of plain water. I had some carrots I needed to use so chopped those up and threw them in with the onion and celery saute. This soup is quite delicious and I will definitely make it again.

I did make a few changes.  I had some leftover veggies that I also added.  Didn't use a food processor--just mashed with my potato masher.  On the Weight Watcher's Program--this soup is 0pts without the cheese.  I added freshly grated Parm and counted 2 points.  You'll love it!

I made the mistake of throwing in a whole box of frozen spinach. Way too much spinach. But, it tasted wonderful anyway. Next time I will use the fresh spinach, like the recipe said.  Other than that change, I didn't change a thing about this. Such good flavor.

This was a good soup and it was served for someone who had bronchitis and made her feel so much better.  It is also easy and fast to make.    I'm calling it the Get Well, Creamy Italian White Bean Soup.

Wonderful with several additions: 1)  5 garlic cloves instead of one. 2.) sprigs of parsley, rosemary, and thyme  3) soup stock instead of water  4)  2 cups cooked rice  5) 1/2 bag of thawed frozen leaf spinach instead of fresh spinach--it's all I had  6)  2 cups cooked soy crumbles meat substitute 7) Omitted the onion because a family member is allergic to onions. This made a hearty stew and a complete meal. Also, I did not puree it. I know these are many changes--I just kept thinking of things to add and it really improved the recipe.

Many reviewers added meat to this to improve it. I was looking for a vegetarian soup and this fit the bill. I simply used veg broth for all of the liquid and, call me crazy but I added some marinated artichoke hearts to the blender just because. It is a super simple recipe that tastes good. Sometimes less IS more! Cheers!

A hearty soup. Quite good.  My minor mods: 1 I had navy beans in my pantry so that's what I used - undrained. 2 No broth or extra water.  3 Sauteed the onion and celery in water.  I will make this again.
Made again.  This is so easy to throw together for lunch.   This time I used Northern Beans and topped with fresh chopped parsley from my garden.

Used dried navy beans (soaked over night then slow cooked over the course of the day...crockpot perfect for this), added extra garlic, used Penzey’s vegetable soup base instead of chicken broth, and in addition to the spinach, at the end I added green onion tops (white parts cooked down with the onions) and about 1/4 C of cream. Cream adds calories, but its totally worth it...gives a rich, buttery tasted. 4 stars because the original recipe needs some sprucing up but is a solid base.

Fabulous as written.  Can be easily converted to a heartier soup with the addition of carrots, roasted tomatoes,...and additional herbs to balance the flavour. I used a bouquet garni of Rosemary, parsley and Thyme. And I didn't purée it. My dad is 97 and tasty, nutritious  meals like this are sheer perfection. Thank you.

This came together quite quickly and was delicious!  Perfect for a cold drizzly evening.  I used vegetable broth for all liquid - no water. Two cloves of garlic instead of one.  Topped with homemade croutons from a baguette I had around.

Very rich and flavorful soup. I'm not a big bean soup enthusiast, but I loved this recipe. The lemon juice took it from a 4-star recipe to 5 stars. Followed the recipe exactly, but I really packed in the spinach (around 6 cups sliced).

I'm an Italian who loves old school recipes (peasant style similar to this one), but also like to delve into complex recipes.  This is one that is a good old school base, but begs for more flavor i.e., more garlic, crushed red pepper, chicken broth (not water), escarole as the green.  The celery and onions, along with rosemary,  are totally unnecessary. This type of greens and beans is served in many local South Philly restaurants.

I really enjoyed this. It reminded me of a soup I had in Sienna,Italy.  I didn't deviate much from the recipe: I added 2 large cloves of garlic, 2 ribs of celery, used EVOO and used 2 chkn bullion cubes instead of a can of stock.  I may have used less water next time because I like a bit thicker soup but it was fantastically tasty and very hearty.  I very much enjoyed this soup.

I had really high hopes, so high in fact that I made a double batch. Unfortunately, for my family, it was just ok.  Luckily my MIL loves all types of soup and she received a nice big container of this one.

More celery and garlic. I cooked from dry beans and over cooked them so...I put half in at the beginning and added the other half at the end just to heat thru for a few minutes. I didn't blend just let the beans break down. Instead of spinach I used a lb of frozen collard greens that I nuked before adding to the soup. Also added 2 sausage links to use them up.

I, too, added more garlic - but only because no recipe ever has enough for our taste! I also added chicken soup base to the water and used a hand blender.  I agree with other reviewers, the hand blender certainly didn't get the soup puree-smooth, but we liked the thicker, more rustic consistency it produced. Finally, LOVED the surprising burst of flavor from the lemon juice! This is an excellent "starter" recipe, which is very easy to adjust for personal taste, and doesn't set off the kid's "too healthy to be good" radar... Woot!

WOW. One of the best and most flavorful soups I've had. Excellent for the cold weather, but still not too heavy to have any other season. Very refreshing. Go heavy on the thyme.

I gave this 5 stars because it was easy to make and it was good. I added more garlic and I put in 2 cups of broth to 1 cup water. When you puree the remaining soup and beans, this totally makes the soup taste like you've been slaving all day.  I substituted fresh rosemary for the thyme and it made a huge difference! This is a keeper!!

What a wonderful soup! I made some accidental and some purposeful changes to the recipe: I didn't add celery because I didn't have any, I used only chicken stock - not plain water, I added leftover chicken just to use it up, I ran out of time to put some of the soup in the blender, and I forgot about the lemon juice.
This soup was really so wonderful.  I will definitely make it again with celery as called for.  I loved it with the chicken, but I also plan to make it without.  I doubt I will do the blending step because it was so good the way it was.  
Thank you for a great soup recipe!

Left out celeray (not a huge fan), added pancetta and small pasta shells.  Did not puree.  Was a great hit at our dinner party.

This was a very delicious savory soup that we enjoyed eating for breakfast and lunch.  I made a few substitutions, including using 3 cans of Trapper's brand Navy Beans flavored with bacon. Two cans were drained and then added to the vegetables and broth (we used chicken bouillon and water). The third undrained can was blended with a cup of the vegetable and broth mix, until smooth. I used a drained can of spinach instead of fresh or frozen.  At this point the soup was a little salty, so I added about a ½ cup of water and ½ tsp or so of thyme and pepper, and then let it simmered for about an hour.  The final product was tasty.

A great soup as is or with some alterations. I always add fresh parsley as one reviewer suggested and it really makes a difference. My husband prefers it without the lemon but I think the lemon gives it a nice tang. I add the lemon just before serving. I also add a little milk and next time I might try a mix of chickpeas and white kidney beans. It is not difficult to make and it's healthy and tasty. Try it!

with minor changes to boost the flavor...same ones as previous posters.......used chicken stock instead of water a bay leaf and an extra clove of garlic. I also added chicken to mine just because I had leftover bits from a roasted chicken the night before and this was a good "home" to toss them in!

This was very tasty! I did make some slight changes based on other suggestions. I used all chicken broth, substituted parsley for the thyme (don't like thyme), and drizzled my serving with a little olive oil. I would make this again!

I was excited to make this but the end result was just ok.  Needs a lot of additions like more garlic, salt, Rosemary, whatever else sounds good. Otherwise it's very bland.  I guess it's a good base recipe!

This was a good soup.  I doubled the garlic and used celery seed in place of cerery because I didn't have any.  I also used frozen chopped spinach.  I used the immersion blender to semi-puree the soup and it worked very well...and I didn't have to clean the blender!  Very healthy and pretty tasty.

I cooked the beans in a pressure cooker rather than using canned.  I also used frozen spinach instead of fresh (too time consuming for me).  Could have used a little extra thyme and a little salt.  But all-in-all, I liked it.  My husband thought there was too much spinach.

Just made it...pretty good. I sauteed the onion, celery (and handful of chopped carrot) in a little roasted garlic olive oil and because I didn't have fresh spinach, added frozen. It's tasty as is, but I might try around with a few more spices or turkey ham chunks for even more flavor.

The only change I wanted to make with this recipe was to eliminate the water and use chicken stock. It made a rich base that was a quick rich hearty supper. Oh, and I used olive oil. Using a hand-held blender cut the prep and cleanup time. Just serve with hot bread and get ready for compliments!

Amazing! A couple changes: I roasted 3 slices of bacon in oven at 425 for 10 minutes, then chopped it and added to soup, no water only chicken broth, 2 more cans of white beans, little crushed red pepper, finely chop spinach, and I used fresh thyme instead of dry. My whole family, even my toddler loved it!! Definitely going on winter rotation. CAUTION: if you use Vitamix to blend, do NOT fill above half way point!! I even took off middle part to let out heat and held lid closed with a dish towel, but the lid still popped off and I got burned on arms and chest. I would stick with immersion blender, although it may not be as smooth, you won't be looking for burn cream!

This was wonderful!  I did use an immersion blender to blend maybe half to 2/3rds of the soup, then put it back in the pot.  I also added 2 plus links of broken up Italian turkey sausage -- browned it after using the immersion blender, then added to soup.  I also drizzled a bit of white truffle oil at the end, which another reviewer suggested -- the perfect addition!

I was disappointed with this recipe, even after applying some of the suggested modifications from others.  I will try again to work on improvement.  Overall, I just found this soup lacking more depth than anything and missing flavor, but I couldn't put my finger on specifics.  I will keep trying!

I made a few modifications based on other reviewers. I like my bean soup thicker, so I used more beans: 4 cans of great northern beans and 32 oz of chicken broth and then blended 2 cans of beans and added that to the mixture. I also increased the herbs and garlic and added 2 slices of prosciutto as it simmered. And olive oil is a must... not true Italian would use vegetable oil.

Only gave it 4 stars because this is a wonderful starter for vegetarian soup, except for some major issues: I added low sodium ( I watch my sodium intake) chicken broth and chicken stock 1 carton of each instead of water . I also used EVOO instead of veggie oil   And sautéed with EVOO and also added some EVOO at the end I also used some hot pepper flakes at the end just a pinch served it with fresh grated Romano next time I would add more beans to make it thicker and possibly more spinach I really like this recipe it’s  A good base to start with and the changes that I’ve made here made it delicious I’m not a huge fan of lemon juice so I only used a teaspoon of lemon juice I will definitely make this again with the changes that I incorporated and even because I try to eat a high-fiber I’m going to add even more possibly one or two more cans of beans .  This could also be changed to a non-vegetarian soup by adding freshly sautéed pieces of chicken breast I think this soup would do well either way  I may try the chicken next time it’s not hard there’s just a lot a little tedious prep work and I Grew up making things homemade in the kitchen with my mom she cooked everything at home . But I digress lol enjoy!

I used all chicken broth because I felt adding 2 cups of water to one can of broth would result in a very weak broth...and I was right. The recipe also needed a bit more garlic and salt. It was a light first course to a heavy meal but I think it needs some reworking.

This is a very hearty soup, and fits in well with my dietary requirements. I doubled the recipe, used only no-salt-added chicken stock (no water), and added some mushrooms. YUM! I also added a dash of smoked paprika. Delicious! I'm glad I made extra!!

Tasty but a little thin.  Omit the water.  After removing some of the beans, puree the rest of the soup and add the beans  back in.  Then add water or chicken broth to bring it to the desired consistency.  Recipe does not mention salt, but it needs a teaspoon or to taste.

It's 5 star with the changes made.  Otherwise I think it would have been 3 stars.  I took the suggestion of Naples 34102 and other reviews and it turned out absolutely delicious!!  My non-soup lover and skeptical hubby just took out a small portion thinking he was not going to like it...well, he ended up going back for 2 big helpings.  I really liked the kick that the cayenne pepper and the multiple herbs I added extra contributed to the overall tastiness.  Thanks colleenlois for a really good basic recipe.  Next time I am going to add some cooked crumbled Italian Sausage!

This turned out pretty well. The soup goes together quickly and was well-received at the potluck where I brought it. I used an immersion blender instead of a regular blender to puree the soup. My version didn't seem particularly creamy, and I wonder if it would have turned out differently in the full blender. I personally would add more seasoning the next time I make this. The recipe version is definitely tame.

Quite tasty. I thought it needed a little more pepper and I’d definitely make again.

I made it using all chicken broth instead of 2 cups of water.  Omitted the onion and garlic because my husband cannot eat them anymore.  I used baby spinach and just tore the leaves into the pot instead of cutting it up. Also omitted the lemon juice (daughter doesn't like it in soup). It was good, we all liked it.  I would recommend doubling the recipe, 3 of us ate it and I only had about 1 cup left over.  Would have been nice to have more left over for the week.

Delicious, easy and CHEAP. I used chicken buillion for all the liquid, added one cubed chicken breast with the beans, and served with grated fresh parmesan. I also added a chopped carrot at the start as I meeded to use it, maybe a half tablespoon of dried rosemary, and a bunch of fresh thyme.) The two of us finished it within a day. (Next time, I’ll make double.)

Brought it to "Italian" family dinner night. Everyone loved it. I did not modify anything. Usually I spice things up, turn up the heat, but there are several members who don't like things spicy.

I loved this soup. I substituted vegetable broth for chicken. (I'm a vegetarian) and used dry beans rather than canned.  We loved it.

This soup was a hit with my kids! The only changes I made were I added 1 carrot and used Tuscan Italian Seasoning instead of just the thyme. I also used my Instant Pot for this recipe (8 min manual with QR), so I did not add the 2 cups of water as called for in the recipe. It tasted amazing... wish I made a double batch!

Like so many others stated, it is a nice base that needs a flavor boost.  I did like many others and started with homemade chicken broth, and used frozen spinach because that's what I had.  For the rest I followed directions and found it lacking in flavor.  I will definitely use more garlic next time and add leeks as well as celery and carrot and top it off with red pepper flakes, fresh sliced romano and a drizzle of good evoo.  I will let you know how the updated soup comes out.

Good recipe. I did swap out broth for stock, just because that is what I always use. I do agree with some other reviewers regarding adding water, I replaced the water with more stock; those are the only changes I made. 

Even my picky eater daughter liked it, and that’s saying something!  

Will definitely make again!

I made some changes in that I used ingredients I had on hand, e.g.  I used Navy white beans instead of kidney.   I did not use the celery as I am not fond of celery in soup, nor  did I use the spinach or cheese as I had none on hand.    That is what cook's do.  You have a starting base and you build from there using the original recipe as guideline.

Delicious, made with dried beans that were first pressure cooked in an Instant Pot after 1/2 the onion was cooked on sauté feature.  Then used slow cooker setting, added the rest of the ingredients + diced carrot and it took about 2 hours. Recommend using a stick blender right in the pot.
Making again  adding ditalini pasta and a parmesan cheese rind.

Though this was really nice. I used bacon grease and upped the garlic and added red pepper flakes. Used vegetable and chicken stocks/ no water. Put one can of beans in some of liquid and processed that so as to do it while liquid was room temperature. Added purée and rest of liquids , other can of beans and spices and cooked down. Then finished recipe as stated. Easy and very tasty.  Definitely will make again but will double next time for sure maybe even triple to have leftovers and freeze some!

I made this recipe twice.  It was very good both times.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe. The second time I made it, I used vegetable stock for all the liquid, added 2 vegetable broth cubes, added a bay leaf, a little extra garlic, and added 1 extra can of beans (just because I wanted it a little thicker).  

It is an excellent recipe no matter how you make it.  Thank you Colleenlora.

Bland as written. I doctored it up with a lot more garlic, thyme and also added 1/2 tsp red chilli flakes. Used chicken broth instead of water. Used kale instead of spinach. With these changes, it was a 4 star.

I use this basic recipe, replacing chicken with veggie stock. If I don't have lemon at hand, I brighten it with  red wine vinegar, white would work too.  It's one of those great recipes that after many preps .becomes your own

Now I'm one of those reviewers who totally changes the recipe, lol.  I have made this twice and will make it again. Here goes: Olive oil not veg oil,  used all broth (chicken or vegetable) not water.  3-4 stalks celery. Any white-ish bean will do-- I used black-eyed peas which were great.  I used kale from my garden rather than spinach.  Added 1/8-1/4t rosemary. Added sliced mushrooms at the same time as the kale. Forgot to add the lemon juice.

I gave it four stars instead of three because of what it can easily be turned into. Like others, I added no water (why would you do that unless you were unable to get broth?) and doubled the broth. I also doubled the celery because it’s not much, and added rosemary and doubled the thyme. Using the submersion blender is easy and effective. I would double the recipe next time because it doesn’t leave much left overs with the two of us.

If you are looking for a heart healthy and delicious soup this one is right on.  I misread the recipe and only had 1 can of beans but decided to make the full recipe any way and it was fine.  Next time I will use the 2 cans though. I did up the garlic per other reviewers and maybe a little less water. Also good to chop the spinach fairly small for easier eating!
Have now made a second time and still with only 1 can of beans but added 3 turkey sausages, casing removed and meat browned, drained and crumbled.  A very nice addition to make a full meal soup.

After reading some reviews I decided to add 3 slices of bacon and a pinch of dried rosemary. It was delicious!  Will be making this again!

If you have to add so many things to the recipe, it should be called a base soup. This is too much work for the bland taste without the add ins others have listed. My husband and I went back to the recipe while eating to make sure we had not left out a major ingredient. The amount of graded parm we used on top to add flavor was definitely not healthy! Do not waste your time on this one.

This was simple to make. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, onion powder and celery seed instead of onion and celery. I found this ok, but very bland. If I were to make it again, I might try doubling the garlic, and maybe increasing the thyme.

A tasty and healthy soup that is creamy from the beans. 
I used all chicken broth (no water), upped garlic cloves to 4 and used kale instead of spinach. 
Will make again with my changes. Oh and the lemon adds a great flavor!

Was very bland. Needed more chicken stock flavor,  seasoning. I added grated cheese while it was simmering which helped. 

I would try it again but wound't rinse the beans, add more seasoning saute onions, celery and garlic in olive oil and tbs butter for more flavor and incude bite size pieces of chicken. 
I would also read the other reviews first.

Five stars with minor modification. I doubled the recipe, and subbed high quality chicken boullion for the chicken broth. I left out essentially half the water (used 6 cups,  instead of the 8 cups of liquid called for a doubled recipe). I would suggest leaving out some of the water and adding it after blending only if needed. I will be making again and really want to try with sorrel in place of the spinach.

Great soup and will make again. I used all veggie broth and highly recommend using all broth (chicken or veggie) rather than some broth and some water. Double up on your rosemary and thyme and if you can handle it add the lightest pinch of crushed red pepper. Very comforting and full of flavor.

The lemon juice takes it from A to A+. This is really fantastic. I've made it a couple times. It's easy, quick, and utterly delicious. I never use spinach because, frankly, I never have it, and once I substituted shredded cabbage for the celery, but no matter what little tweaks I make, it's one of my favorite soups ever.

I really  liked this recipe. It was super easy and tasty.  The only thing I did differently was use vegetable broth instead of chicken and I didn't drain the beans because I'm lazy ;) and I also thought it would make the soup a touch thicker.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe (ingredient wise or cooking wise) but I did take out only 1.5 cups of the concoction to puree---I thought 2 cups seemed like MOST of the soup and I wanted the texture to remain a bit meatier.
Next time I would add more beans, but I also love beans!

These are the changes I made--- doubled both thyme and garlic and used all chicken stock.  Still very bland.  The only thing that saved it was abundant use of Parmesan cheese.  Won't be making this again.

I love this soup. It’s a good soup base. You can add what you like to make it your own.  I made the following modifications to the recipe:  I used olive oil and added additional cloves of garlic.  I replaced the water with chicken broth and used fresh thyme instead of the dried.  Will I make it again – yes!

I love bean soups, wether Mediterranean  or Latin style. But, I had to read some reviews before making this one. 1 clove  of garlic  and 1/8 teaspoon thyme wouldn't be enough to flavor white beans and spinach (both  very mild in taste ). So following some reviews,  I doubled the garlic and thyme, used chicken broth all the way and good extra virgin olive oil and Parmesan cheese.This way, it made a hearty and tasty soup.

We loved this and will definitely make it again!  I blended it with an immersion blender which makes it incredibly fast and easy.  I blended all of it, and then added a third can of beans since other reviewers suggested more beans.  I also added sausage, but you don't have to do that for this soup to be great.

Delicious!  I took the advice of others and made this with all chix broth, no water.  I also used an Italian seasoning mix in place of the the dried Thyme because it's all I had on hand and olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Easy to make and yummy.

Apart from substituting vegetable broth for chicken broth, I followed the recipe exactly. I pureed the amount of beans specified, but this just turned the liquid opaque. It didn't really thicken the soup, and the end result was thin and rather bland.   It was definitely not as thick as the soup in the picture. Not sure what went wrong there. In any case, it probably needs more spices and aromatic vegetables.

I made this pretty much as written except I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and fresh rosemary and thyme because I had it on hand.  I also added mushrooms - personal preference.  When it was done I tasted it - thought it needed something.  Then I remembered - the Parmesan cheese!  Added grated Romano-Parmesan to it - Superb! Thanks for the recipe.

Nice, easy and healthy recipe, perfect for colder seasons! However did follow the comments and have added extra garlic and herbs. Also not big fan of blending soups it reminds hospital food also breaks down the fibers, which are necessary for the healthy digestion plus you see the goodies you eat!

I used 4 cups of chicken broth, 4 cloves of garlic, and 1/4 tsp of finely ground thyme in an attempt to jazz this soup up.  It was still rather bland.  Edible, but I tried to bribe my daughters to finish their soup with the promise of a Popsicle and they asked if they could help fold laundry for a Popsicle instead.

Pretty good. A little boring but good for a quick meal. I added all vegetable broth instead of water to keep it vegetarian. Also used olive oil, not vegetable. Added some garlic croutons for some added flavor. Not bad. Will make again.

I've made this twice. First time I added chicken, second time I added Italian sausage. Both tasted great. The only thing I didn't do was purée the beans. Left them all whole. Tasted great. Will definitely continue to make this soup. Thanks.

10/15. For Ray and me. Loved this nutritious , hearty, thick soup.  Used extra garlic and extra spinach.  Blended with hand blender in the pot and it was nice and thick without needing to add flour or cornstarch. Loved it!

I made this tonight. From the pic, it looked like a creamy Tuscan bean soup, like some of the Italian restaurants serve. It was mildly thick, and mild in flavor. Thank goodness for the Better 'n Bouillon I had on hand, to seriously boost the flavor and save the day.

I've made this a couple of times and love it. I used vegetable broth since that 's all I stock but added 2 non chicken broth cubes and 2 red curry broth cubes from Edwards & Sons.  So delicious. This time Instead of spinach, I added Kale. Yummy!!

Good! Did what a lot of others did and eliminated the water and used more broth. Also with the veggies added one very large carrot finely diced. Love so put a lot extra. Be sure to use lots of pepper and some salt.

A great soup on a cold day.  I used all veggie stock, added more garlic, and olive oil.  I seasoned with salt and pepper as it cooked, making sure it was well seasoned.  Served with fresh parsley, Parmesan, and olive oil.

Read the reviews, they offer a lot of insight on how to make this a great soup.  I used 3 cans of Northern White Beans, 1 teaspoon tomato paste, no water, 2 -32 oz organic chicken broth.  Topped with fresh parmigiano reggiano and white truffle oil.  Oh, and olive oil!  This was restaurant quality soup.

This was good.  I started out by frying up half a package of bacon (I doubled the recipe) then removing that with a slotted spoon then sautéing the veggies in the bacon grease.  Next, I doubled the garlic and after reading reviews I added chicken bouillon cubes because I did add the water....next time I'll just use all chicken broth.  Oh, and don't forget to add that yummy bacon back in when it's all finished.  :-)

This soup is amazing with some modifications. I replaced the water with low sodium chicken broth, added a 3rd can of beans, and doubled the garllc cloves, thyme, and lemon. I garnished with a drizzle of EVOO, red pepper flakes, cracked black pepper, and parmesan cheese.

Loved it!  Made with extra garlic and thyme as recommended.  Finished with EVOO, extra grind or two of black pepper and fresh shaved parmesan cheese at the end.  The base was very good, but think especially the EVOO made it!

Made it pretty much as written except used veggie broth in place of the water and shredded fresh parm on top. An  immersion blender works perfectly for mashing the bean mixture. The soup was pretty bland the first day and somewhat better the next day but not worth making again.

I just made this.  I think a fresh bunch of chopped cilantro would be great next time.  I served it with shredded cheddar cheese on top.  Also I think more garlic would be good too.  Easy and fast it what I like.  It has potential!

Delicious, and I will definitely make it again, but I made changes based on other reviews.  I browned lean bacon and sautéed the veggies in the render fat plus some additional olive oil and used all chicken broth instead of  water.

I took previous suggestions and increased the thyme, olive oil, lemons juice and really increased the garlic, as well as added lemon zest.  I left off the broth for a lower sodium option and it really turned out great.  Do not forget the parmesan with the lemon at the end.  This is a keeper!

This was a pleasant soup.  I cheated a little and used frozen chopped spinach and my homemade chicken broth which worked out fine.  I also added a shredded chicken breast. Although good, next time I would add more garlic.

Wonderful! My husband added salt, but I liked it just as it was. I did substitute rainbow chard for the spinach, since that's what we had, and doubled the garlic, just because we always double the garlic in every recipe we do. I even gave some to the baby, and he loved it!

This was exactly what I wanted for dinner tonight. Before reading the reviews I had already made most of the recommended changes. There seems to be a pretty cohesive opinion that it should have olive oil, more chicken stock and less water, more garlic and thyme (I had to use poultry seasoning)  and some type of wonderful cheese. We actually threw some crumbled feta in there with some parm, and it really made it for me. Without the base recipe I wouldn't have known where to start (i just was craving a cozy soup and had lots of spinach to use) so I' m grateful I found it.

Doubled the garlic, used all chicken broth, used 1tsp. Thyme, and used another can of beans.  It was so yummy!  A great soup to take to work for lunch.

We did not care for this soup.  It was watery and bland.  I love the combo of beans and greens in soups, but this one just didn't measure up.

This was great. My kids didn't eat it, but I was expecting that.  I used water and beef bullion (only had 1 can of chicken stock) instead of the 2 cups of water. I also added more garlic, rosemary, no celery and used frozen spinach and added frozen broccoli as well. Ate it with buttered bread. I will make this again.

This is such a quick recipe for such an elegant soup! I loved this. I used chicken broth in place of the water and added more garlic.  I also used a dollop of sour cream when I added the blended mixture to the soup.  It gave the soup a great color and added a subtle creamy taste! I will definitely make this recipe again...it took me only 20 minutes, start to finish.

Very Yummy.  I added a little more garlic, sprinkled in some tarragon, and added some ground beef.  Easy, inexpensive, and quick.

This was okay as directed, but it was too thick and too bland. I ended up adding 3 cups of chicken broth so that it was more like a soup and less like a thick stew.

This is a great bean soup recipe.  To make mine heartier, I added an extra can of beans after pureeing the soup.  At the suggestion of others, I also used a lot more garlic (5 cloves) and threw in a bay leaf while sauteeing the vegetables.  Tarragon is a great susbstitue for the thyme.  Just use a couple of tablespoons of whole fresh tarragon leaves in its place.

Delicious! I used 5 cloves of garlic, some thyme, and some dried parsley. I also used escarole instead of spinach - which was delish! And a bay leaf. I also used 32 oz of chicken broth instead of the water, but there was a little too much liquid - I'll try for 28 oz next time.  So to soak up the extra broth, I  added half a box of orzo noodles, uncooked, to the pot, and let it soak up the additional liquid. It came out more like a stew than a soup, but it was delicious! I will make it the same way next time!

Great basic recipe.  I used a large onion, 2 cloves of garlic, and 2 cans of chicken stock - omitting the water.  Very tasty and satisfying, however next time I will start with sauteing some pancetta then adding the onion.  Also when I make this soup again I will add the chicken sausage suggested by one of the other reviewers.

What a simple yet delicious soup. I only used one can of white kidney beans and 1 cup of water and forgot the garlic (I know, how do you forget garlic!). It is fabulous!
Thank you!

This is a fine and tasty, and different, bean soup. Extra lemon juice and olive oil is nice, as other reviewers have recommended. I've also added more veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, and green beans) which was pretty good too.

Tast was good, the texture was not what I would call creamy, though, more like grainy. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken because I am vegetarian, but I really don't think that is what made the difference. Thanks.

I found the soup a bit bland until I added a heaping teaspoon of cumin and a couple dashes of cayenne.  I also doubled the lemon juice.  Next time I won't puree quite as much of the soup so it's a bit chunkier.  Very good though!

Really nice and not bland at all. I used chicken boullion instead of stock, and added a small potato to thicken the soup. A bit of parsley helps too.

Followed the recipe except omitted the water and used two cans of chicken broth. Added other reviewers recommended spices as well. At first I thought I liked this and then after subsequent tastes, I didn't. I think it needs something else -- like browned Italian sausage.

Wonderful!  The delicious flavor of an unhealthy cream based soup, but it's so good for you!
