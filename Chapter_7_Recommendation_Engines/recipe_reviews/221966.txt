I upped both the butter and olive oil to tablespoons. I did saute these a little longer than the recipe asked for, only because mine were not quite ready after 45 seconds. Though my family was lukewarm about this, I loved it. What my family didn't want, I happily ate for them. VERY good. Next time, I think I might throw in some chopped shallots. I think that would make this dish even tastier!

First, I'll confess that I actually like Brussels sprouts! I started slicing them long ago to trick my husband into eating them! For the longest time he thought it was cabbage, lol! Anyway, this recipe is really outstanding, and the lemon juice brightens it up nicely. I almost follow it exactly except I add teaspoon of lemon zest and cut back on the lemon juice. I also sprinkle red pepper flakes onto the finished dish.  I cook mine longer than 45 seconds, probably closer to 2 minutes, and they still have the nice bright color and texture.  I served this with grilled chicken wings and rice.

These Brussels sprouts are indeed “truly delicious”.  For years I have used the Julia Child method of lightly steaming the sprouts and then thinly slicing and sautéing them in butter.  I now know that the steaming was an unnecessary step.  Mine took longer than 45 seconds to soften but were still speedy and effortless to prepare.  Most people who profess to dislike this healthy vegetable have usually only had the overcooked variety.  This recipe will surely bring them around.

Yummy sprouts!  Thanks, Chef John!  So light and uplifting!  Works well with cabbage too!  I've been eating this regularly with either sprouts or cabbage.  So much so that I've begun trying some variations these days. I still love the lemon especially well, but sometimes I also like leaving out the lemon and subbing in one of the following: (1)  cider vinegar & brown or raw sugar with mustard seeds &/or red pepper flakes or sometimes I use stevia), (2) -or- balsamic vinegar & almond slices (also with red pepper flakes and/or raw sugar), or (3) lime juice with garlic powder and chipotle (or cayenne powder - no sugar here, though).  Should also be good with (4) curry spices or (5) white wine vinegar and cajun spices - or (6) OJ and 5 spice OR jamaican jerk OR add in some fennel.....perhaps anise & coriander & garlic..... (7) five spice powder and a touch of soy sauce, though I haven't tried those options yet..... Bunches of yum!!!!!

I am looking forward to making these again for our Thanksgiving dinner. I bumped up the flavor last time by adding some bacon bits and some sliced almonds in as well near the end ( even a handful of dried cranberries for color). I agree they do take approx 2 minutes, not 45 seconds to heat and cook through. Hubby hated Brussels sprouts before, now he asks for them!

Oh, my goodness... this was amazing.  Beats steamed or microwaved sprouts all hollow!

They needed about 4 minutes before they started to brown, but I was starting with frozen sprouts which I'd had to thaw briefly in hot water in order to slice them.

So, yes, it works with frozen sprouts too.  Just be careful when adding half-frozen sprouts to the hot butter-oil mixture, because the veggies are wet and will spatter.

45 seconds is NOT enough time for these to soften. I cooked them a full 2 minutes and they were still pretty tough. They had a great flavor and the butter and lemon juice, but they were just not cooked enough according to the recipe time...and since when does 1-2 minutes + 45 seconds= 5 minutes?

Went to find out how long to steam brussel sprouts and found this recipe.  Followed it to a tea!  Never enjoyed brussel sprouts so much!  Thought I was eating dessert!  Absoulutely delicious and so easy!  Thank you again Chef John.  Have been making the "Just chicken and Mushroom" recipe for months! We have it at least 4 times a month!  You are the man!

Even as a lifelong brussels sprouts hater, I know how healthy they are. I've been trying to like them. I used another recipe from this site a few months ago, I gagged. I came across this recipe a few days ago and made them just for me last night, using 6 sprouts. Since I had read the reviews the day before, I forgot that they should be cooked longer than 45 seconds. Some of the outer leaves were too tough to eat, but I devoured the parts that were edible. Delicious!

When I tried this the first time I thought 45 seconds was too short. Then I watched his video and he showed how to half, remove stem and then slice very thinly. I did not slice thin enough the first time. What a difference.

I am not a brussel sprout eater and neither were my kids BUT I made this tonight for dinner and we all loved it. I followed the recipe as directed. Kids said it "didn't taste like sprouts" so....I will definitely be making this dish again. Thank you, Chef John.

I hate brussels sprouts, but I absolutely loved these.  Followed the recipe exactly, until it came to the fresh lemon.  I only had limes, so I used half a lime.  My husband couldn't believe how good they were.  I don't know how many people the recipes was supposed to feed, but two of us devoured them.

I love brussels sprouts, but this doesn't even taste like them! I'll be sure to serve it to someone who doesn't care for them. And then tell them after the rave.

I just prepared this awesome dish for dinner, I gave it a little kick with some fresh chopped garlic and wished ground pepper. It is awesome and now I wished that I had made more.  After everyone tasted, there was not much left.  Great recipe and it will be on our table every Thanksgiving!

I probably used more oil and butter, I don't really measure those kinds of things. I cooked them until they had a bit of brown and the loose bits were wilted. I didn't use the lemon juice, instead I sprinkled with garlic and a little salt. Soooo good, but then I do like brussels sprouts anyway.

These are truly delicious! Make sure your butter starts to brown before adding the Brussels.. That's what's makes them truly delish! I added the lemon juice just before serving. Mine cooked to my liking in 90 seconds. I got about 6 slices from each Brussel sprout. Loved the simplicity of this dish.

I have to say I had major doubts. But all the reviews gave me courage to try this recipe. OUTSTANDING! My mother claims to dislike brussel sprouts but she said they were perfect. I used two teaspoons of butter and a dash of olive oil. I cooked them about two minutes and turned the burner off. I let the steam make them more tender.

Outstanding... simple and delicious!  YES, 45 to 60 seconds is correct.  If you found that it was not enough cooking time, then you did not slice/chiffonade the sprouts thinly enough.  OR, the heat was not high enough.   Just watch the Chef's video!  He doesn't quarter the sprouts or even slice them thickly.  This recipe needs to be executed very precisely before you review it negatively for needing longer cooking time!  Thanks Chef John for another great recipe!

I bought ready to cook brussell sprouts that were already seasoned with salt and pepper and a lemon pepper seasoning (they weren't frozen, they were in the produce section of the store, kind of by the bagged salads). I cooked a little longer than it said to.

I doubled the oil, butter and lemon juice and had probably about 20 brussel sprouts. The sprouts didn't cook fast enough in the pan before the edges started to brown darker, so I put them in the oven at 300 for 15 min. DELICIOUS! That lemon juice makes them really perky. Will make again multiple times!

Really delicious recipe for Brussels sprouts.  Not a word I would normally use to describe Brussels sprouts.  It's fresh and light tasting.  I think it would be good in summer as a cold salad as well.  LOVED  it!  I liked that they weren't soft and mushy like usual recipes.

Made as is.  Not bad for me which is saying a lot since I have a checkered past with Brussel sprouts.  Went over well in general and although cutting them 'thin' took some time cooking was quick and easy.

I really enjoyed the butter and lemon flavors together! I used roasted Garlic olive oil in place of regular. Took longer to cook than 45 seconds.  Will absolutely cooked this recipe again.

I've become a big Chef John fan and have learned to trust his recipes to be good. This one does not disappoint. I've been roasting brussels sprouts in the oven for a long time, but this is much quicker without any loss of taste. Keep em coming chef!

Everyone really loved this (even the one who doesn't like brussels sprouts)! I have made this twice now, and added red peppers the second time which was very good too.

Mine started to burn and melted the tip of my tongs...lol...but it tasted good!  Only cooked it for about 30 seconds due to melting tongs.  I used a heavy copper bottomed pan....next time I'll use a different cooking utensil.

I did not discover Brussels sprouts until my mid-40s. They are soooo good and this recipe is perfect and easy. I cooked them for 4 minutes and they were perfect. Finish with a little Parm or Romano cheese.

Delicious! I didn't have lemon juice on hand so I substituted balsamic vinegar. It took quite a bit longer than 45 seconds for them to soften and brown.

Husband and 3yo liked it, they added some raisins and raspberry vinigrette to tone own the lemon. My Brussel sprouts were smaller, so maybe that's why the lemon was a little much - but I enjoyed them.

Our favorite recipe for Brussels sprouts! I never do only 12 sprouts, so I up the amount of oil and butter. Browning the butter is key for me as I think it adds a great nutty flavor to the sprouts. I end up cooking these for more like 15 minutes but that's for a 2 pound bag from Costco!

This really was a great, simple, and quick recipe.  I usually roast brussels sprouts and was making dinner and forgot it took 35-40 min.  So I found this recipe in hopes for them to cook faster.  It was great!  We had it with grilled marinated pork chop and home made mac n cheese.  The brussels sprouts went great for a perfect summer meal.

I was disappointed in the end result after all the work of slicing and trimming. We didn't like the browned lemony flavor as well as plain steamed, buttered, salted and peppered sprouts.

I love Brussels sprouts but my husband will only eat them with tabasco.  I made these and told him I would let him salt and pepper to taste.  He said he was going to use tabasco not s&p.  I told him to taste them first, he did and did not use the tabasco.  Told me to hang on to the recipe, it's a good one.  He does most of the cooking because he is pickier than I am so this was a very good sign.

This was much better than I expected. I did make one change to the recipe. I used 1 tablespoon of  fresh squeezed orange juice since I was out of lemon juice. I really liked this dish, I will try it with lemon juice but oj is my first choice.

I misread the recipe and used a Tbsp each of butter and oil.  I think I had more than 12 brussels sprouts, anyway.  I had to cook them just a little longer.  They were still crisp, though.  My husband couldn't stop raving about them.  I think it's the lemon juice that really shines!

Yummy brussel sprout recipe! I used just a little oil, no butter, and added a tsp of ground mustard seed. I too sauteed longer than suggested, until the spouts turned a nice bright green.

These were fantastic. I didn't have any lemon juice on hand so I substituted lime juice and added a little chipolte powder for a kick. Not a Brussels sprouts fan, but love these and most every recipe Chef John puts out.

I added the butter and olive oil to a cast iron pan that I had just finished browning some Greek marinated chicken in. After it was deglazed I added the brussel sprouts, cooked the for about two minutes, then added the salt and pepper, squeezed half a lemon over them and tossed. OH. EM. GEE. These are SO GOOD  and super easy!

I may never eat Brussel sprouts any other way. I doubled this recipe and it did take a little longer to cook them, but I like my vegies with a little crunch, not mushy. My mates couldn't believe this was Brussel sprouts.  There was none of that Sulphury smell.  Oh, and I didn't have a lemon so I used a lime and it was great.

I just made this tonight.  I had to prepare a large batch, at least double this recipe, because my sprouts were starting to show signs of going bad.  I also ended up using the juice of a whole, large lemon.  It is a very simple yet good dish.  I will make this again, but be advised that the prep time is a bit lengthy.

Like other reviewers, cooked longer, more like 3 min, but halved the sprouts, doubled the recipe and added a dash of red pepper flakes. Perfect.

Best brussel sprout recipe that I've had so far, but I can't ever follow a recipe exactly. I used more butter and probably more Olive oil. Also added garlic salt. This will be a repeat recipe for me.

I made this tonight and did not taste one bit of awful bitterness at all, but as mentioned by other members I cooked it roughly two minutes or longer, added more butter, olive oil and lemon zest and it was delicious!! Husband and myself gave it the thumbs up. We’re not a big fan of brussel sprouts but after finding this recipe I think this would be making a come back.

Confession: all I had were frozen ones. But I steamed those just long enough to thaw a little then followed the recipe as written. Brussel sprouts are hit or miss for me but I really liked this recipe.

Wonderful!  There was a nutty flavor to this dish that I had not experienced in Brussels sprouts before, nicely offset by the lemon.

I usually do sprouts whole or half. I was surprised how easy they sliced, and I also liked how they came out. I upped the olive oil and butter to about a tblsp. The cooking time of 45 sec didn't work for me (as others mentioned, as well). I sauteed them at least 3 min, and they started to brown just a little. They were not soggy, just cooked right. New, delicious way to do sprouts!

Modified the thin slice sprouts concept to add 4-5 shallots (ring-sliced to similar thickness) and one diced apple kicked this recipe from a 4 to an easy 5.

I had a bag of shredded sprouts that needed using so this recipe did me well! During the cooking process, I plopped in a bit of minced garlic (to finish off the jar) and finely grated a few baby carrots that were nearing the end of their life for added color and sweetness! Squeezed a bit of lemon on top before serving.  So simple, nice and easily adjustable for different flavors!

Liked Chef John's meat loaf, like Brussels sprouts, this recipe seemed like a sure thing.  So I started with 2 lbs of fresh sprouts.  Trimming per instructions took  a solid hour.  To accommodate the larger volume of sprouts I doubled the butter and oil, and the cooking time.  Maybe should have doubled cooking time yet again.  Taste was alright but too crunchy and lacking that smelly cabbage scent that makes sprouts sprouts.  Without the coring and confetti chopping I could have cleaned them in 10 minutes, microwaved them in 15 and in 25 minutes had the sprouts that I like.  Turns out that with lilies or sprouts, gilding isn't necessary.

I finally got my husband to like brussel sprouts!!! I used a bag of frozen baby brussel sprouts and steamed them in their bag for about 3 minutes. I probably should have just done 2 minutes because they were tender before even going in the pan. I thought these were great!

Maybe it was my Brussels sprouts, but I did not care for this at all. No one liked it. And I love lemon on my steamed veggies. The outer leaves were tasted but the stems were bitter and just awful.

LOVED IT EASY. The work is in the shredding. Once that is done, it's an easy vegetable. I use my hand mandolin.  I do
a full bag of Costco Brussels sprouts and I am set for a while.
It keeps in fridge, but am going to try and freeze. Watch the lemon juice, necessary but doesn't need a lot. If I have on hand I will add a little bacon next time.

I'll give this 5 stars because it's a fantastic starting point.  Only thing I would add is some freshly grated parmesan while cooking and needs to be cooked much longer than the recommendation.   3-6 minutes pending on how big of a batch you are making.   Make sure you slice them extremely thin.  That's the trick.

My husband hated Brussels sprouts when I met him. He will try one or maybe two if they are over cooked and  drenched with bacon/bacon fat or cheese. But even then he will not eat a whole serving. He absolutely loves this recipe, as do I. Be careful not to overcook. I did that once and they were much too wilted (I slice them fairly thin). But even then they were still edible. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I made it and will try it again. I did it as written but I over cooked  it. I just didn't think it was done at 45 seconds but it was. I thought the flavor was good but I wanted just a bit more so I added a pinch of cayenne and some garlic powder. I am going to try it again.

Yes, thinly cut does make a difference, as does the squeeze of lemon. Will make it again. Also,  most Brussel sprouts recipes call for bacon and maple syrup which takes away the nutrition and masks the taste. This recipe doesn't and allows the nutrition to shine through

Great recipe.  Even my hubby who hates Brussel sprouts liked it.  I omitted the lemon juice just because I didn't have any and added 6 tiny chopped pearl onions and 1/2 tsp chopped garlic.  Cooked on high for about 3 minutes til they were soft.  So delicious! Definitely a keeper and I'll be making this regularly!

This was a really nice alternative way to make B sprouts. We both love them anyway so it wasn't a matter of being converted, but will make this way again. (The chiffonading takes way more time than making the crosshairs in the bottoms and steaming them, but again, it's an entirely different texture.)

I loved this change up to my usual roasted brussel sprouts. I followed exactly except did pan fry for more than 45 seconds...no big deal...I imagine the size and freshness of the sprouts and the heat of the pan would affect the timing. DELICIOUS!

This recipe is a godsend.!! Brussels sprouts in an instant - with none of the bothersome gas associated with this vegetable. I added a bit of onion powder, garlic powder, and seasoned salt. It's critical that the vegetables be cut thinly and uniformly.  Preparation takes more time than cooking - but it's well worth the effort.

I hate brussels sprouts!  But even I had a second helping of these! 

 I was looking for a recipe for Thanksgiving dinner because my husband loves them. This is a great recipe.  It does take longer to prep but it is worth the time as the sprouts are delicious. I think the next time  I will add pancetta or bacon but since I was cooking for a crowd in which there were vegetarians and vegans, I decided to follow the recipe.

Absolutely amazing!!! This really only serves 1. If you want to share you will have to double, or quadruple, etc. The 45 sec cooking time yeilds a more 'al dente' texture. I cooked for about 1 1/2 min to get it slightly browned.

I never knew Brussel Sprouts could taste so good. So quick and easy to make also. Not having and lemon juice handy, I substituted key lime juice, it was exquisite. The accompanying
Video was particularly helpful. There is no finer way to prepare Brussel Sprouts.

This is our favorite way to eat the Brussels. I do cook mine longer until there is a good bit of golden brown throughout and they are pretty soft. I also add garlic, either a minced clove or just some garlic powder. Sometimes I will use a splash of white wine in place of the lemon juice  for a different twist and we enjoy that, too. Most people I have made this for love it, even the former sprout haters. Thanks for a fun recipe.

All 9 of us loved this recipe.  I doubled the recipe and it was licked clean, I could of made more.  I did fry it 4 min.  What a great way to eat brussel sprouts.

We enjoyed these. I did add a few chopped mushrooms as they needed to be used and sprinkled the finished dish with toasted, sliced almonds for additional crunch.  Slicing the brussels sprouts reduces the bitterness so I sliced them as thin as possible. The browned butter adds a sweetness to the dish. I will make these again but I'll sub in a good, aged balsamic vinegar instead of the lemon juice. Thanks Chef John.

I usually make Brussels sprouts in the oven. This method was much faster. Takes 5 to 10 minutes depending how many you make. I added other spices to taste and some spinach on the skillet and fresh tomatoes on the plate. Very nice side dish.

i have found a new love for Brussel Sprouts and this recipe just adds to it.  The browned butter just takes these sprouts over the top! Will definitely be making these again and again. Thanks for sharing a great recipe Chef John!

Delicious!  I tweaked it quite a bit. I used sea salt and amino acids instead of lemon juice. I also browned the brussel sprouts for 3 min then put a lid on them to steam for about 10 min.

Nice light side dish.  I sliced the brussels sprouts very thin, but still cooked them about 4 minutes. This is a  good basic recipe to add to, also.  I'm going to throw in some shallots next time.  Thanks Chef John!

I did have to cook this a bit longer than recipe said...about 3 minutes...but I probably didn't cut the sprouts as thin as chef did. However, these were absolutely lovely. Next time I might add a bit of chopped garlic. Definitely a keeper. Thanks chef!

Really simple, yet really delicious.  Nice little zing from the lemon juice.  I did cook this for 2-3 minutes in the frying pan to suit our tastes. Served with scalloped potatoes and cottage roll (ham).

Loved this recipe, and am a lover of Brussel Sprouts. I added some sliced garlic cloves and a sprinkle of parmesan. Delicious and I love the fact that you don't cook for long maintaining all the goodness.  Also cooked for about 2 mins.

Make just as written!  I do let my brussel sprouts cook until just a little brown and squeeze half a lemon before adding salt and pepper.  That's just my personal preference.  I could seriously eat brussel sprouts this way every day!

I love Brussels sprouts but neither me or my husband liked this recipe.  My favorite way to fix Brussels sprouts is to simmer them until tender and top with buttered bread crumbs.

My daughter and I are already huge Brussels Sprouts fans, but I was looking for a recipe that might entice my two boys to try them. i omitted the lemon juice, but made no other changes. I did get my boys to try a bite, they still aren't crazy about them, but these were very tasty and I will definitely be fixing them this way again. As always, THANKS, Chef John!

Everybody gave me grief for making brussel sprouts for Easter... until they tried them.  I doubled the recipe and they were completely gone.  Everybody wanted the recipe -- even those who claimed not to like brussel sprouts.  Not sure about the cooking time (45 seconds) as mine were still raw then but no big deal -- just cook them until you get them how you like them.

Pretty good, but not as good as roasted.

I was surprised when we made this and none of us liked it. It must be down to a matter of taste, but we much prefer the traditional butter, salt, pepper and grating of nutmeg to this. would have been better with garlic, perhaps.

Delicious but a lot of work to shred.  Family prefers the steamed version because you have substance to dip it in vinegar.

I had never thought of slicing brussel sprouts before.  I don't care for whole, steamed brussel sprouts, but I loved these. The rest of the family including greatgrandma, grandpa, and my 8 year old who do love whole, steamed brussel sprouts did not care for these at all. So, 4 stars from me and 1 from the rest of the family.  More brussel sprouts for me!  I did promise everyone that I wouldn't make them again.

I made this recipe tonight for dinner with Salmon. It turned out ok, but seems like it needed more seasoning.

So super easy, and so deliciously yummy! I didn't change a thing and my husband "brussel sprout hater" was a convert! Thanks for this superb recipe! I bought a whole stalk of sprouts so we'll be having this again soon!

I cannot believe these tasted as good as they did. Husband said he hated brussel sprouts but he would try, at the end we were scraping out the last bits from the bowl. Thank you so much. Followed the recipe exactly.

Love the slight lemony flavor.  I sauteed them just until they wilted and they were fantastic.  Thanks John.

These were really delicious!  I added shallots & fresh garlic and cooked it all a bit longer, and it turned out great!

I have always disliked brussel sprouts and would not eat them anywhere.  This recipe is fabulous!  The only adjustment I made was adding some freshly crushed garlic to the pan when I add the butter.  I still probably won't eat whole brussel sprouts but, will certainly make this recipe again and enjoy eating it.

Taste was great but a bit dried out.  May try softening a bit in microwave first next time.

Nice to have a different way of doing Brussels sprouts. They definitely needed more than 2 min though.
