A nice change of pace from the usual. I liked the sweetness and tangy flavors mixed together, along with the crunch from the pistachios. I used 1-inch thick center-cut salmon and would highly recommend cooking less than the stated time. You definitely don't want to overcook salmon, especially at 400F, or else it starts to get dry. I roasted mine for 6 minutes, added the pistachios, then roasted 6-7 minutes more. Perfectly juicy!
