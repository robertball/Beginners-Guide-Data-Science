The tortillas and chipotle/mayo sauce help this recipe.  The shrimp by iteself is a bit overpowered by the marinade.  I would try again, but also might try a different variety of the Lawry's marinade - there were many in the store that sounded good when we went to buy this one.

An excellent recipe! I served mine with sweet corn, and it was loved by everyone who tried it. The variety of flavors and textures makes this a very interesting (and very tasty) meal - I particularly enjoy the tortillas with the mayo/sour cream/chipotle spread. Fun to put together, fun to eat, and quick to grill -- a great summer dinner!

This was very good.  I did not use the skewers but broiled it in the oven.  Very tasty!

Well, I couldn't find the 'Baja Chipotle Marinade With Lime Juice' so I made my own. I'm not sure what the Lawry's version is like, but mine was SPICY! I made this using regular peel-and-eat-shrimp, as that's what they had at the store, and I also used flour tortillas instead of corn. We had them with some thinly shredded iceberg lettuce. Tasty (but a tad too spicy for me!)!

We enjoyed this one a lot.  I didn't have any bell peppers so I just used shrimp and pineapple.  I served them as a side to grilled t-bone steak.  There were no left-overs.  Also, because I was in a hurry the shrimp was only in the marinade about 5 minutes.  But it didn't seem to matter as they tasted great.  I'll buy Lawrey's marinades again...thanks

Only change I made was to marinate the shrimp for a little longer.  Very good - the mayo/sour cream sauce makes it even better.  Only moderately spicy.  My kids didn't care for the flavor, but the adults voted it a definte keeper.

This was pretty good. I didnt use skewers. I just cooked it on the outdoor grill using a screen.
