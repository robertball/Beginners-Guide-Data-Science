Great recipe. Thank you. Some people are so rude! It's called this not that. I added this this and that etc... If people are going to add so much to a recipe, then you are not following the recipe, so how can you rate it one way or another? If you insist on changing so much on a recipe, write your own and don't say you followed somone's recipe (but made your own additions) and then leave them 4 stars after you completely changed the recipe.

First of all, this salad is called "SUNOMONO", not "Sunomo".  It's Japanese.  I give this recipe 4 stars because it's quite good but I made a few additions that made it 5 stars.  I added some thin carrot shavings made with my vegetable peeler.  The carrot tastes good with this dressing and adds a really nice touch of colour.  I also added several drops of toasted sesame oil and a tiny bit of cracked pepper.  Just before serving I added toasted sesame seeds.  Everyone loved it :)

Delicious and light. I use Mizkan rice vinegar, there are two versions - seasoned and unseasoned. If you use the seasoned variety like I did here, you do not need to add salt or sugar. I simply sliced the cucumber, added the vinegar and grated the ginger and that was it for a fab salad!
As a tip, freeze your ginger and take it out of the freezer to grate as necessary (no need to wait to thaw out, just grate and pop the rest back in the freezer). Ginger grated like this will be finer than you can chop with a knife and give a lighter background finish to your dish.

This was tasty and refreshing.  It went great  with our main dish, "Japanese Beef Stir Fry," recipe also from this site, and would also be wonderful with sushi.  I had something similar at an excellent sushi restaurant in Minneapolis and this was almost a carbon copy.  A little sweet (I used Splenda), a little gingery, but that's the way it's supposed to be. A definite "make again."

Excellent summer salad.  Refreshing and light.  I omitted the ginger and added some shredded carrot and nori (seaweed).  The perfect side dish for our sushi roll dinner.  Even my toddler liked the salad.

This is a standby for a light, palate-cleansing, cooling side to many of the spicy dishes we enjoy at my house.  It's not a stand-alone salad though.  I sometimes substitute dry ginger (about 3/4 tsp) for the fresh, if I don't have any.  I always use Splenda instead of sugar for lower calories and carbs.

This reminds me of a similar cucumber dish my Mom makes - this one's is just a bit sweeter.  My mom also includes thinly sliced red onion in her's - it adds a nice little variety in texture.  A deliciously light side dish.

Very good!  The only part that takes some time is the cutting of the cucumbers.  I omitted the ginger because I did not have any at home, but it still was delicious!

Very tasty cucumbers just as I remember while growing up. I used a mandolin to slice the two Japanese cucumbers paper thin. I used Splenda in place of white sugar and followed the rest of the ingredients and meaurements as instructed. I love the vinegar "tang", sweetness with gingery taste in each bite. You can always adjust the amount of sweetness and tartness to your liking but the vinegar, sugar and ginger is key and what makes this dish. I especially like this super cold on a hot day-very refreshing! I served this along with, Japanese-Style Sesame Green Beans, ""Japanese Shrimp Sauce I,""Japanese Style Deep Fried Shrimp," and "Miso Soup," all from this website.

The minced ginger adds a really nice zing to this low calorie/zero fat side dish.  It was a bit too salty for us, so I would cut back on that the next time.  Served with Tropical Grilled Chicken Breast, Carrot Rice, and Mama's Blackberry Cobbler for dessert (all from this site).ºººººUPDATE 6.17.17ººººº  I used an English cucumber, so I didn’t bother to peel or scoop out the seeds this time.  Knowing our personal taste preferences, I cut way back on the sugar and the salt.  Since I had a small piece of red onion in the fridge, I added some slices to the cukes which gave it some nice eye appeal.  The single thing that differentiates this salad from many other similar cucumber salads is the minced ginger root in the dressing.  Like this a lot, could eat it all day!!

Just like in the best sushi places! Just need to prepare in a covered bowl and shake very well then store in the fridge (covered) for at least two hours. Serve with soy sauce reduced with water and a little bit of lemon

This is a really good basic recipe for sunomono. But for my family's taste, it calls for WAY too much vinegar. I cut it down to 1/4 cup of rice vinegar (actually just a tiny bit less. I only fill the 1/4 measuring cup about 3/4 of the way) and I only use 1 tsps of grated ginger root. I also sprinkle sesame seeds on it and pour a little bit of soy sauce over it to give it a little more flavor. For us, it is perfect :o)

This is a staple in our fridge when the cucumbers start growing in like mad. Kids love to snack on it. We also add sweet onion. One tip is to pay attention if you are using 'Seasoned' Rice vinegar. This already contains sugar and I just cut out adding additional sugar or just add the tiniest bit

I didn't have rice wine vinegar so I used plain. TO make up for the boring vinegar I used fancy turbinado sugar instead of white and oh my GOODNESS. Just delicious. I did use powdered ginger and it was fine.

This recipe is super easy and my family loved it!  I have way too many cucumbers from my garden this year and this was a great way to use them.  It is refreshing and light, which is perfect for summer.   Make sure you use fresh ginger!!!  Don't use the ginger spice in your cupboard!!!

Darn..I didn't read the reviews before I tried this recipe.  It was too salty for me...and I like salt.  I would use 1/2 the salt next time.  I will make this again because we have a ton of cucumbers in our garden, but just with less salt.

This tastes just like the cucumber salad we've had in Sushi restaurants. Delicious, easy to make & very light tasting. Can't tell you how it is the next day, because it was devoured at dinner last night!

Fabulous. Hubby is a convert after being reluctant to try. So easy and refreshing. I did have to substitute wine vinegar once and its just as good. For a twist, try adding a few thinly sliced onions to the mix instead of the ginger. We live near Vidalia, so sweet onions are frequently in our pantry. They make an excellent addition.

This is the best recipe I have ever made using cucumbers in a vinegar marinade.  I used Marukan Seasoned Gourmet Rice Vinegar with low salt and low sugar bought from our local health food grocery store.  My husband devoured it.  I added shavings of carrots as well.  Wish I had more cucumbers to make another batch right away.  It was not vinegary.  If anything it was a perfect mix and nothing overpowered on flavor.  Thanks to all the other reviewers who mention other recipes.  I have found some delicious ones in the reviews for this dish and actually found this dish by reading someone else's review of another dish I made to go with the cucumber salad: Yakitori marinade from this site.

For the first time EVER we are using all the cucumbers in our garden thanks to this recipe! Thank you for posting it! The only change I really made was using powdered ginger instead of fresh because I didn't have any fresh on hand. I have used both and my husband prefers the powdered - I however like the fresh. Wonderful and thanks again!

Perfect, absolutely perfect.  A nice change from my husband's Germany cuke salad.  The ginger adds so much to this.

Love it! A perfect cucumber salad! I used agave nectar and used much less than 4t, so it wouldn't be too sweet. I also added 2 shredded carrots and probably had more ginger than the recipe called for (I love ginger). I also added some black pepper. It is very refreshing and I can't wait to take it to a summer potluck!

I make a similar marinade for my cucumbers, but I had never thought to add ginger.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  Also used small seedless cucumbers which made preparing easier.  No peeling and seeding :)

Unless I used the wrong measuring spoon, this was too salty.  BUT it was just what I was looking for.  Used a collossally huge cucumber from the farmer's market so I doubled the recipe.  This morning they are swimming so I didn't need to.  Used powdered ginger.  Tastes good but turned everything a funny light brown.  Due to the freshness of the cucumber, it's still pretty crunchy the next day.  Next time:  1/2 the salt, fresh ginger, freshest cucember possible.  Definately a keeper!

My Japanese wife loves it just as it is!  Thinks it to be quite authentic, although feels that the sugar should be reduced to 2 1/2 teaspoons(but that's just her...I like it just fine.)

Somewhat light in flavor. The vinegar flavor is a lot less intimidating than I had expected.  Made this for guests, as well as my entire class of students--everyone enjoyed this Japanese dish!

Simple recipe and delicious cool salad. Next time I will add some finely shredded carrot, finely shredded or zested ginger and black sesame seeds.  It will add a little pizaz to it.

Fantastic!  The ginger gave it a refreshing flavor.  I didn't scoop out the seeds as I used hot-house cucumbers, which have very few seeds in them.  I also only let it sit about 40 minutes in the fridge but they were plenty flavorful at even that length.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! Better than the one we have been making for years. I like the addition of fresh ginger-- totally makes it! Flavor Tip:  I sprinkled sesame seeds on the salad before serving.

Overall a bland, boring recipe.  I think it's missing sesame oil or soy sauce.  This did not impress anyone.  I won't make this again.

For the most part, yummy, but next time I will do half the salt, a bit too salty, and a few bites had way too much salt taste. Giving it four only for this reason. Will make again for sure, thanks for the recipe!

I thought this easy recipe was too good to be true, and unfortunately it was. The Vinagrette definitely was missing something. I added more ginger and some soy sauce to perk it up, but it still wasn't very interesting. 

I think if you're looking for a fairly bland and easy to make side salad with japanese food you could get away with this--but don't go out of your way if you're trying to impress someone.

Great  recipe.  I made it. Ate it.  Added my favs (garlic, etc). People need to get over themselves as far as rating.  I almost always add or decrease amounts for my families taste.  I will make this over and over but I'll adjust to my liking.  The recipe is still 5 stars in my book!

I brought this to a potluck and an Asian friend said it reminded her of the food of her youth. Several people asked me for the recipe. My twist on it is adding 1 T sesame oil and a dash of red pepper flakes. That will up it to 5 stars!

Loved it and very simple to make. I cut way back on the salt, using perhaps a 1/4 - 1/3 tsp and it was fine. I also added approx. 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes which gave a nice kick.

Very good. Very simple. I'll make it often. It goes with just about everything from breakfast and on. Nice to have in the fridge. Used a mandolin for very thin slices and a seedless, hot house or English cucumber which has no (or very little ) seeds...so no need to remove them.

pretty yummy!  I used less sugar and added a few drops of sesame oil and a few shakes of crushed red pepper because I thought it  needed a little bit of jazzing up (I was serving it as a stand-alone salad, not as a side dish).

Used ground ginger (that's all I had on hand) and added toasted sesame seeds.  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  Easy and awesome.

Agreed, this should be SUNOMONO, not sunomo. It still had a great flavor. I wouldn't let this sit for longer than a day though.

I have always made cucumbers with a mayonnaise and vinegar sauce. I tried this for a little variety, and I don't think I'll ever go back to my old recipe. This was wonderful, so tasty and summery. I'm a big fan of ginger, so I made it just like the recipe said. As some others have suggested, I may add some carrot next time just for some added color.

yummy and easy to make. I didn't cut out the seeds, just sliced thinly. I also added some carrot as a previous reviewer suggested and it was a great addition.

I love anything with ginger in it, this is a great twist to the traditional marinated cucumber salad. I didnt de-seed my cucumber, since I like the seeds. This one will be getting made over and over in my house!

This was great. I only put 1 tsp white sugar and didn't have fresh ginger root, so I put about 1/2-1 tsp ground ginger. I wasn't expecting it to be good, and I'm not sure if I'd like it with all the fresh ginger, but everyone loved it. Easy to put together too.

Tasty. Has a unique sweet and a slight ginger taste. Served with 2 types of Chicken Katsus ("Chicken Katsu" and "Ashley's Chicken Katsu with Tonkatsu Sauce") and "Sesame Noodles."

This was good - no doubt about that. I really thought it needed some soy sauce and sesame oil to finish it off. I also added some crab - to mimic the cucumber salad at my favorite local sushi restaurant.

This was really fantastic!  The only bad thing I have to say about it is that it seemed like there was too much of the "dressing" for the cucumbers.  But I just used a slotted spoon to serve them, and they turned out fine.  Great recipe, I would definitely recommend it!

This is really more like a pickled side dish, but unfortunately, I tried to use it as the main vegetable.  Not a good idea, unless you want a stomachache from all the vinegar, :(

This was an interesting change from the typical cucumber salads. I don't like it too sweet, so I cut down on the sugar. I didn't have fresh ginger, so I used dried/ground ginger instead.

I started using this recipe a while ago and it has become a standard.  Goes fabulously well with grilled and/or asian style dinners.  (Loved it even more when I discovered the local sushi bar had a similar dish!)

Great recipe!  I decided to use this when I was in a rush and needed a recipe that was faster than my usual.  I used 1 large european cucumber to avoid the seeds and kept everything else at the listed amount.  Served with asian fire meat, steamed rice and kimchee.  Will be making this often!

I hate to rate recipes and change them. That being said, i hate ginger, so that was left out and i love soy sauce, so i included a dash...just enough to make the sauce an amber color. LOVE this dish. Perfect when I cant get to a sushi restaurant. Very tasty.

Very good basic recipe to fool around with a little.
I decided to cut the cucumbers into paper-thin strips using a vegetable peeler. Did the same to a carrot, and the color combination looks beautiful. The strips remind me of confetti and are fun to eat. Delicious salad!

Not bad, but not very special.  I expected more pizazz from the ginger, but the salad was fairly bland.  Doubt I'll make it again.

This was excellent served with a spicy soup [I served it with Thai Coconut Carrot soup].  For the recipe, I did add a touch of sesame oil [to balance the vinegar] and used half of much sugar, seeded the cucumbers and topped the salad with white sesame seeds right out of the jar, thinly sliced green onions and chopped cilantro.  Will make this again for certain.

I increased the sugar to 4 Tablespoons, to make a 5 star Cucumber Salad. Made and refrigerated the night before (16 hours prior). Leftovers holdup well (still crunchy) for several days.  Not necessary to core or fully peal cucumber.

07.27.17 ~ Another use for cucumbers.  We have quite a few cukes coming on all at the same time in the garden.  This was a good use.  We liked the little zip that the ginger provided.  They paired nicely with 'Fast, Fresh Grape Tomato Salad', 'BLT', and 'Huckleberry peach Cobbler', all AR recipes for our dinner.  I sliced the cucumbers with a mandolin to get a nice even thickness.  I would use this recipe again.  Next time I'm going to add some thinly sliced onion.

I love sweet stuff but this was way too sweet.  I will try it again with about half sugar and add salt to balance the flavors.

EDIT: I finished my whole bowl so I guess it wasn't THAT sweet!  I will try adding soy sauce though.

The flavor of this dish was very close to the flavor of the sunomono at my local Japanese restaurant. I definitely recommend using a mandoline to slice the cucumbers--you want them as thin as possible. Also use a microplane or extra fine cheese grater to grate the ginger so you don't end up with chunks of ginger and so the flavor really permeates the vinegar. I might try adding some seaweed to up the authenticity a bit, but it tastes great as is.

Love, love this simple healthy recipe! I used half seasoned rice vinegar and half unseasoned rice vinegar so I only added 1 tsp. of sugar. We both really enjoyed it. I like any dish that includes fresh ginger!

I didn't think that there was enough dressing for the pile of cucumber slices, but after stirring it a few times over the hour it was in the fridge, it really was! Amazingly fresh, crisp taste. Love it!

This is a great recipe.  I went light on the Ginger but that is a personal preference.  It went great with the Indonesian Satay Recipe from this site.  BTW I didn't bother cleaning out the seeds, I just peeled all but 3 narrow strips of skin from the cucumber, sliced it thin, and it was excellent AND pretty!

There is way too much salt. There is insufficient vinegar to adequately marinate the quantity of cucumbers. The ginger is too strong.

If it were not for a mandolin, I'm not sure I would have tried this recipe.  I use English cucumbers and leave the skins on, plus have added about 1/2 tsp dark sesame oil when I've made it.  The fresh ginger makes this recipe.  I brought this in to work for a potluck, and it received rave reviews.  Thanks for sharing!

I like this recipe.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I do like to add a splash or two of soy sauce to mine, I think the soy sauce gives it that flavor it's missing.  

We have a local restaurant that serves a mixed green salad topped with sunomono, carrots, bell peppers, Maifun (rice noodles), diced avocado and seared tuna with a soy ginger dressing.  This recipe taste exactly like the restaurant makes their cucumbers that they put on the salad.

We really liked this.  I'm surprised hubby liked it as much as he did considering it's a little unusual. Even though I'm pretty timid with spicy things, I think I'll add a tiny pinch of red pepper flakes the next time.

I love this recipe - so impressive and so simple! Just remember if you are using ground ginger (not the fresh kind) to use far less of it, or it will end up with quite a bite.

This was an excellent way to prepare cucumbers!  I will be using this again.  I also added celery since I had some that was about to go bad and it blended nicely.  I think it would also be great with tomatoes added.  Add some feta cheese and it would make an excellent side for greek dishes.

Very nice change of pace. Simple, easy, light and would be wonderful on a hot summer day. This would also taste great with some cherry tomatoes added. I plan on trying my hand at gardening this year and this is a keeper for the large supply of cucumbers I will hopefully grow. Thank you!

This was good, except there was ALMOST too much vinegar for my taste. I had so much sauce that I threw in a third cucumber. This is tastey in a martini glass with raw fish on top. Will make again.

This dish is wonderful.  I make a double recipe and snack on it for several days afterwards.  I have fed this  to two people who say they don't like ginger and they both liked it (some folks just think they don't like ginger, I guess).  It’s a great side dish to rich or heavy foods since it is light and refreshing.   This one has become a standby in my home.

This Sunomono recipe is very good. Using rice vinegar with a dash of apple cider vinegar is better and adding crab meat makes it over the top.

My gramma used to make something like this and since the alzheimer's I've been trying to find the recipe somewhere.  this was a GREAT base for me.  I just sliced the cukes, added the same amt of vinegar except i use white vinegar, and the same sugar and salt.  Voila!  A perfect replica of my gramma's....thank u

Fantastic! I followed a reviewer's suggestion and added a few drops of sesame oil and some shredded carrots. What a delightful salad! I served it alongside rice and sesame-seared tuna steaks.

This salad is awesome!    Quick and easy and I always have all the ingredients on hand.  I use English cucumbers that I get at Costco and then I do not need to seed them.  Excellent side dish for Asian food.  I would recommend making it the day you are going to eat it.  I made it once, didn't get to eat it until the next day and the cucumbers were not as crunchy.  One of our family favorites.

This is a good starter recipe.  I gave it 4 stars because I did as another reviewer recommended and added shaved carrots, sesame oil, black pepper, & toasted sesame seeds.  My husband ate almost half of the salad in one sitting.

Like several others ... I believe it is sunomono ... the spelling doesn't matter .. this is a really good recipe for fans of Sushi Bars. Typically this includes pieces of fish but alone it's really good. I added the carrots, sesame seeds and oil. It was really good. Will make this again ... but will leave the sliced cucumbers a tad thicker. Thank you!!

This is so fast and easy.  Read the reviews first and used less salt...I used sea salt.  Also used the fresh ginger that comes in tubes that you can freeze. I also used 1 large English cucumber as suggested.  These are actually better than the cucumbers that are served at PF Chang's!!Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I was worried about the fresh ginger, as it has quite a bit of bite on its own, but after marinating for the hour suggested, the flavors meld together perfectly! Admittedly this is more appropriate for warmer weather, but I'm pretty sure I'll be making it year round.

This was great! We had some fresh from the garden cukes that we needed to use and this was the perfect lite summer salad that we were looking for. I made exactly as directed. Next time I will add carrot as suggested. I served with baked teriyaki chicken from this site and they complimented each other very nicely.

This dish was simple, quick, and it tasted great! The only thing that required any effort was mincing the ginger root, and that was well worth it for the wonderful flavor.

i didn't have ginger so i just left it out but did the rest the same. after 2 hours of marinating, i hated it, and thought it was a waste of good cucumbers. but after about 10 hours of marinating, i now love it, and made tasty sandwiches with it.

Simple, yet delicious.  Very different from the usual cucumber salad.  I did cut back the sugar to 3t. based on other reviews that it was too sweet (started with 1t., taste tested by increments of 1/2 t. until I was finally happy at 3t.) This dish adds a nice cooling element to any meal featuring spicy food.  I served it with BBQ pulled pork.  I will definitely be making this again and don't feel the need to change anything other than the sugar adjustment.

Made it twice as written.  Put it in the FoodSavor marinator to speed up the process.

Was a great side with seared tuna and cilantro lime cauliflower "rice" from this site.

This is so good during the summer as a refreshing side dish. Sometimes I add a little thinly sliced onion since my family and I are nuts for onions. I just started making Bento lunches to bring to work and this is a perfect side! Thank you so much for the recipe. My mom has always made something similar to this with regular vinegar and no ginger, her cucumber salad. This one is even better, a lot more flavor and flair.

I have always HATED cucumbers! If a piece ended up in my salad, even if I took it out, the salad was ruined for me because I could still taste it. But when a friend shared this recipe with me, I could tell it sounded like it could make cucumbers palatable to me. It did more than that! I LOVE this recipe. It's very quick to prepare. I add some pepper flakes and even some pieces of red onion. It's a wonderful, healthy quick snack between meals. It goes great as a condiment on sandwiches or as an addition to salads. I may still not like cukes on their own, but prepared this way? Terrific!

So flavorful, you'd think more ingredients went into this! Very refreshing on a summer day, and would pair perfectly with lettuce wraps. The ginger and rice vinegar add a nice brightness. The only thing I might do differently is to slice the cucumber a bit thicker to prevent them from going soft.  I used a mandolin to make slicing easier.  Delicious!

This is one of our favorite salads.  My daughter was a sushi chef for several years, and this was pretty much the recipe for the sunomono at the restaurant she worked.  any veggie, thinly sliced works when combined with the cucumber.  we have added blueberries, strawberries, huckleberries (when we are lucky enough to find some) and watermelon.  adds color and the dressing is so complimentary to so many fruits and vegetables.

I've had cucumber sunomono at restaurants before, and this is pretty much just like it. One or two people  mentioned adding sesame seeds. It seems like a good idea, and I may try it when I make this again. But really, this recipe is great as is. I will definitely be making this again for my family - even the picky eaters love this.

This tasted good, and I'll probably try it again. We don't like things too sweet, so I used 3 tsp sugar, and that was plenty. I added thinly sliced red onion, because my husband won't eat a cucumber salad without onions. I upped the amount of ginger, probably to 2 1/2 teaspoons. I used 1 large English cucumber which doesn't have seeds, so I left the slices in circles. It was a nice, interesting change for cucumbers. Thanks!

I decreased the salt by half due to all the reviews and I used a sugar substitute. Still a good way to use my English cucumber.

Been searching for a cucumber recipe similar to one I enjoy at a local Chinese restaurant. This isn't quite it, but it is the tastiest one I've found and I've been looking for years. Very happy! I add a few sprinkles of red pepper flakes. Really love the sweet/sour/spice  combo. Thanks for posting this recipe!

This is also good without the ginger, if you don't have it. I personally like a little less sugar, but that's just my preference. Adding a little dash of sesame oil does give it a slightly more complex flavor, but it's still 5 stars as is! People always say "Mmmmmm" when they eat these.

Not quite as sweet as some versions of your basic Su, but still very good and classic Japanese. Variations of this include radish and carrot instead of cucumber.

This is my go to recipe for cucumber salad. Much less calories than the sour cream types. You can make it exactly as written but can substitute ginger powder for fresh ginger if you don't have any on hand.  A drop or two of sesame oil before serving is also a wonderful variation. Make extra as it's hard not to snack on the cucumbers as they are marinating,

I made this for a Japanese themed dinner as a starter.  It was good, but I think next time I would reduce the salt.  It over powered all the other tastes, but everyone enjoyed it.

This is a great tasting and refreshing salad.  My mom used to make it for me when I was young.  I later made it myself.  One of the commentators talked about how rude it was to change the recipe, but many people who comment add their flair to the recipe when they comment.  The original recipe is a modification from what might be considered the original recipe from Japan, but that's ok because she made it to her taste.  Others talked about other ingredients they added.  All these give us ideas to try otherwise you might never think on the variations that might make it even tastier or give it variety.  I myself add onions and sometimes seaweed.  Enjoy!

Always liked this at our favorite Japanese restaurant, so I finally decided to try it myself. Easy to make, and everyone liked it, which is quite rare. 

I added about six radishes per cucumber, which added a nice color and a little more bite, otherwise made as the recipe.

I made the dish exactly as the recipe specified but used Penzey's powdered ginger. It was wonderful. I liked the balance of sweet and tangy.  Next time I will use fresh ginger.

I loved this recipe, although I only had seasoned rice vinegar on hand, I did however add just 2-3 chopped Thai chili peppers seeds and all to give it a little kick, I will make again with and without the peppers..I added the peppers because I live on spicy food while my family doesn't.But it is going in my recipe box for future use.

It is delicious! I have made it several times and have added thinly sliced onion the last few times and that is good too.The basic recipe is a good way to start, then tweak as you like.

Excellent. I used powdered ginger instead of fresh ginger root and it still tasted great. It had the perfect amount of kick for me. I think fresh ginger might have been too much.

I will definitely make this again. Such an easy lunch snack!

I've been making this recipe for years!  It's wonderfully refreshing, and very easy to throw together.  I usually serve it with spicier meals like dakgalbi.  In a pinch I will sub sweet cooking rice wine for the rice vinegar, and at times use half of each.  Excellent!!!

One of my favorites. I don't add salt, and substitute Splenda Spoonful for sugar. I also use 1/2 cup of rice vinegar.  Great shelf life on summer picnic.

Husband won't touch cucumbers, which is fine by me, since I can enjoy this tasty little salad all by myself! Generally using English cucs, I always use the garlic-flavored or seasoned rice vinegar and whisk in a couple pinches of dried ginger, a pinch of garlic powder and a quick shake of  black pepper. I always omit the sugar, as I prefer the tang of the vinegar. I like to toss in a few paper-thin slivered raw onions. Other variations which compliment this salad include shredded carrots or thinly sliced radishes. Experiment and enjoy!

These cucumbers were light and crisp.  The rice vinegar was not strong at all.  They were served at an "International Tea" as a side dish and received good comments.

This is excellent.  It's very refreshing and addictive.  The only thing differently I did was add two thinly sliced scallions and probably used a little more than half the amount of sugar.  It came out great.  I'll definately make it again and again.

Enjoyed this recipe very much. I did add toasted sesame seeds and that added a wonderful favour.Not quite like the sunomo salad in a Japanese restaurant..next time I may add a few cooked,cold shrimp and rice noodles for fun.

My sister is allergic to all legumes, so she can't eat most japanese food that we have found recipes for.
But I wanted to have a food to represent each movie for the Oscars this year and needed a japanese recipe for "Lost in Translation". I was about to despair (the other option was whiskey cake and I didn't want everyone getting drunk) and then I found this!
We bought the ingredients and hoped it would work.

Well, we are all fans of spicy food here so the bite was just suited to our tastes. We also love veggies and now we have a recipe to fall back on for pot-lucks were it seems that there will be twelve variations on "hot dogs in sauce" but lacking green vegetables.

So, we now have a food we all can eat without trips to the ER AND love.

While this didn't taste like the sunomono that we normally get from restaurants, it had a fresh clean taste to it.  I went with the recipe as written and it worked out quite well.
