With a few variations, this has been my family's stuffing recipe for three generations.  We use a stick of butter and six onions, slowly sauteeing the celery and onions until very soft.  Add eight cups of cubed bread that you've left sit out overnight.  Moisten with turkey broth.  The stuffing should be a bit on the "mushy" side, but not too much.

I made a few changes and it ended up just like my Mom used to make...no chicken broth, 2 rolls of sausage (don't drain) and a stick of butter with the celery and only one onion. And lots of sage and poultry seasoning! The actual stuffing out of the bird was terrific. Cutting the bread in small cubes also helps keep if from being too dry.

This was my first year cooking for Thanksgiving and I was very stressed. This receipe was so easy and tasted great. My Mother-in-Law doesn't eat sausage and she loved it (she even took some home). I didn't stuff it in my turkey and it still came out great. I put it in the oven for about one hour at 350. I also added a little more chicken broth half way through cooking. Thank you Kimberly and Mother-in-Law, I will be using this receipe forever.

Great recipe, same as my mom made my whole life. This is the stuffing that makes it feel like thanksgiving.  We do make it a bit different:  We use 2 packages of jimmy dean (regular) sausage, (do not drain) 1 stick butter, 6 stalks of celery, two med onions, 1 1/2 to 2 packages of bread (depending on size).  Poultry seasoning, sage, and pepper to taste. (no salt as sausage is salty enough)  Two eggs and 1/4 cup milk.  For the broth we boil the neck, liver, gizzard and heart with 4-6 bouilion cubes.  (makes a great stock). Cook in a Oven safe dish for approximately 30 min, 350 degrees, Make sure stuffing reaches 165 degrees.  If you stuff the bird see internet for temp. regulations for health reasons.

I really liked this, I thought it had good flavor.I am going to use this as my recipe from now on. I froze the bread first and then sliced it frozen into cubes with a serrated knife. Very easy. Let the bread sit out overnight, tossed it to get it stale. Like the cubes in the bags but much cheaper--Use any old cheap sandwich bread.  Thanks.

Woohooooooo!  Another great recipe keeper.  We just had our Thanksgiving Dinner yesterday and this stuffing was awesome.  I made it in a pan and placed it in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes as we deep fried the turkey.  My husband was amazed.  Thanks Kimberly!

Great dish!  I used the Jimmy Dean sausage with Sage and after browning the sausage I removed it from the pan and then added the butter to the sausage drippings to cook the celery and onion mixture.  I increased the sage to my personal preference and like other reviewers also added in some poultry seasoning.  I also added in some garlic powder and parsley.  I had halved the recipe because I was only serving 4 people, but still ended up using the full cup of chicken broth as I prefer a very wet, moist stuffing.  I made this along side a roasted chicken so I only baked it for approximately 20 minutes at 350 degrees.  I have always used Stove Top from the box for my stuffing but NEVER AGAIN!  This is my new stuffing recipe and I can't wait to serve it to the family at Thanksgiving this year.  I may even try it with turkey sausage the next time to cut down on some of the calories and fat.  Thank you so much for sharing - a definite keeper!

very delicious, relatively easy to make.  I added 3/4 tsp. salt, and it was a tad on the salty side, I'd go 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. depending on how salty you like your food.  Also, by some weird fluke, I had no chicken broth in my house, so I used a can of condensed chicken and rice(just the broth) and added enough water to make 1 cup.  And still this was wonderful, even with my oops of no chicken broth.  I cooked this in a cassarole dish for about 1/2 an hour.  Delicious!!  a must try!

This is a good recipe for stuffing.  I do have one hint when you stuff the turkey and also bake some in the oven.  I mix the two after cooking and then it all tastes like it was made in the bird.

I also fry my dressing before I stuff the bird.  What a difference.

This is a great base recipe that I have been looking for, but doctored up.  I fried up Jimmy Dean sage sausage, drained it and sauteed the celery and onion in a stick of butter with poultry seasoning and salt and pepper.  I omitted the eggs, and used 2 bags of pepperidge farm herb stuffing crumbles, and a few pieces of day old stale bread.  I mixed it all in a large bowl and used chicken broth to bind it, and stuffed the turkey.  The stuffing was incredible, everyone loved it!  I was glad to find this recipe because it was most like the one my grandmother used when I was growing up, but I didnt have her recipe.  Thanks!

This turns out wonderfully. When I am short on time I just use Mrs. Cubbisons dried stuffing breadcrumbs and add more chicken broth.

Very good stuffing.  Followed almost exactly but I let the bread set out overnight to dry out, and I thought 2 pounds of bread really was a lot.  Probably used more like a pound and a half of dried bread, and more chicken stock.

My favorite bread stuffing recipe! I toast the bread the day before and let sit on stackable cookie racks overnight(with wax paper underneath to catch any crumbs). I use low fat sausage and cook in muffin pans the next day with a dolop of butter on top!! YUM!

Our favorite stuffing recipe. I don't add eggs though, and if you are baking the stuffing outside the turkey, there is nothing better than to get some bastings off the turkey and squirt it on before baking. If you use a bag to cook your turkey, just insert the baster into one of the slits you make in the top of the bag.
This is so tasty and we have every time we make a turkey, I will not even try another recipe.

This turned out wonderful!  I would recommend tearing the bread into pieces and leaving it on the counter on waxed paper the night before.  The first time we made this we just left the bag open overnight and the bread was way too soft and we got mushy stuffing.  The second time we cut the bread into small cubes, covered the kitchen island with waxed paper and left the bread out overnight uncovered and it was perfect!  We did two loaves of white bread and one of wheat and it turned out great.

Very very good stuffing recipe.  I took the advice of others and used extra chicken broth since I did not stuff the turkey.  Came out moist and delicious and made enough for everyone plus some leftovers!  Great recipe!

This was a very easy recipe to follow and the result was excellent.  I did not stuff a bird and so cooked the stuffing for 30 minutes at 350 F before serving.  Delicious.  Will definitely make again.

This is good, but only because I added a bunch of seasonings and more chicken broth.  As the recipe is would NOT be good at all.

Fantastic...easy to do but I cheated with 2 lbs of herb garlic croutons.  I had to add a another carton of chicken broth to compensate.  This was my first attempt at stuffing...

I am not a stuffing fan, so I personally can not comment on the taste of this recipe.  I included my own personal addition, I looked for apple flavor sausage like suggested by others, sold out.  So I cooked the sausage in a cup of unpasteurized apple cider (the really sweet yummy stuff) and the aroma and taste was wonderful in the sausage.  I stuffed a 16lbs turkey with this mixture and the remaining I did in a seperate dish in the oven while the turkey was resting.  The stuffing in the turkey turned out wonderfully moist and people raved about it.  The remaing I did in the oven seperately came out rather dry, so if you are doing this without stuffing a bird, I would recommend adding a bit more chicken stock.  Overall the stuffing eaters did enjoy it.

This stuffing was good, I received many compliments. It was the first time that I had made stuffing from scratch and it turned out very well.  The sausage gave it extra flavor.

The recipe was basically okay, but it needed an additional egg and a full 14.5 ounce can of broth --- otherwise it would have been horribly dry (unless you cooked it in the turkey).  The lack of seasoning made for a somewhat bland stuffing, it definitely needs more flavor.  I will make a very modified version of this from now on, but it was a good start.

Made this stuffing for Christmas and it was good but I needed to add more salt and spices. Otherwise, it is a very good stuffing.

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving with a couple modifications - instead of two loaves of white bread, I used one loaf and a bag of cornbread stuffing mix.  I also used a sage flavored pork sausage.  It came out great!  I will be using this one again next year.

I grew up eating this stuffing on holidays. Since I do not stuff the bird I vary by adding the sausage uncooked and baking for 30-45 minutes. Either way it is a great recipe.

Oh yeah! First rate recipe!!! I added two cloves of garlic. Also added 1/2 cup of crushed walnuts to the mixture. I used a large loaf of wonderbread. Used a large red and a large yellow onion. I skipped the salt. Did anyone notice that Sara Lee cloned this recipe and credited Kimberly for the original?!! That's so kewl!!! Congrats and thank you! It tastes great, with great texture and very filling. Awesome and easy!!!

This recipie is a lot like mine but if you really want the taste of something much more FLAVORFUL try adding a large can of Cream of Chicken soup.  Found the recipie years ago and will never make it any other way...FANTASTIC.

I'm not a fan of bread stuffing, so I can't really judge this one myself, but my partner thought it was really good. Here are the changes that I made: I didn't use all of the bread because 2 loaves was quite a bit too much, I dried the bread out fairly well and toasted it a bit in the oven, and I used vegetarian sausage (I refuse to cook or eat meat) and that turned out very well. Thanks!!  :)

This is just like the stuffing my grandmother used to make.  It's delicious.  I omit the sausage and use poultry seasoning instead of sage.  This is a classic for sure!

I tried making stuffing for the first time and used this recipe.  I added 1 more tsp of sage, 1 tsp poultry seasoning, an additional egg, didn't drain the (hot)sausage and used 1/2 stick of butter to cook the celery & onion, and about 1 1/2 cans of chicken broth.  The only change I'll make for next time is to use both cans of broth, as I thought it was a bit dry.  I cooked it in a 9x13 dish @ 350 for 30 min.  I found that 2 loafs of bread was a little much, and omitted about 8 pieces from the 2 loafs.

This was the first time I made stuffing from scratch.  I loved it from the bird.  It needs a lot more liquid to cook in a separate dish.

This was my first attempt at making stuffing.  I didn't use it to stuff the bird so I had to add more chicken broth than the recipe called for.  The pork sausage gave it a great taste.  All the leftovers were eaten so that's a good sign.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This was the best stuffing I've ever had!!! It is perfect just the way it is, I chose to add sauteed mushrooms and absolutely loved it!! It was good in the bird and baked in a casserole dish. Kimberly thanks for sharing!

First - I love this website!  It saved me!  I used this recipe last year for Christmas dinner with the entire extended family to rave reviews!  I have now been told that it will be our staple for Christmas and Thanksgiving.  I made it exactly per the recipe and it came out great!  Thanks.

Though the recipe title said stuffing the directions said dressing.  I stopped doing stuffing years ago because dressing is almost always foolproof.  Only a couple minor changes; I added poultry seasoning as well. My grandmother gave me a tip years ago that makes a world of difference.  She told me "when you think you have added enough celery add some more"  It makes it moist without being mushy. In this recipe I used 8 celery stalks.

Oh yeah.  Add an apple or two to this and I think it would really be out of this world good.  We had a ten pound bird and half the recipe was enough for stuffing the turkey and a pan of dressing besides.

Terrific stuffing. I gave it four starts only because I modified it by adding raisins plumped in stock and subbing Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute (killer on everything) for the sage mix. It needed a little more stock for our taste, too, but we like a wetter stuffing. This will be my go-to recipe from now on.

I am a southerner who has a mom who is allergic to corn. So no cornbread stuffing for her.  I made this alongside our usual cornbread stuffing and baked both outside the turkey in the oven.  The whole family loved this recipe and couldn't believe there was a bread stuffing they liked!! Thanks for sharing we will be making this every year along with cornbread stuffing (can't give that up :) What a hit! Oh, I halved the recipe with great success.

So excellent - my family loved it. My Sis-in-law made it. Then I did too. Suggestion, when stuffing it into the bird, Line the bird with cheese cloth, then stuff. That way you don't miss a single bit of this wonderful stuffing!

This recipe is a good, basic stuffing recipe - good for those that may be preparing stuffing for the first time.  I used this as my base recipe, but like many reviewers, I made my own changes.  I use a bit more sage, a bit more celery, pecans, diced apple, and mushrooms in ours.

I LOVE this!  It's a hearty dish that will make your tummy very happy!  I don't use white bread; I buy a loaf of day-old french bread and tear it up into chunks.  Works like a charm!

First time making homemade stuffing, we'll never go back to store bought!  Very easy to make.  A bit salty so we didn't add it the second time around...I think the sausage makes it salty enough.  We also added more chix broth since it came out a bit dry the first time.  Second time around was perfect, so yummy!!  Family enjoyed it!  Kimberly, thanks for the great recipe!

This is an awesome stuffing recipe and I've been using this for a while now.  I season the sausage with sage as it's cooking and also add shredded carrots to the mix.  YUM!

I really liked this stuffing.  I liked mine mushy so I did use a can of the broth instead of just 1 cup.  I used a bag a seasoned bread cubes and it still came out great!

I made this for Thanksgiving for 9 people.  Every bit of it was GONE!  I didn't stuff the turkey so took other people's advice and added more chicken broth.  Midway through I stirred it all up because the bottom seemed to be soggy and the top was crunchy.  I thought it was good but seemed to lack something.  Everyone else seemed to love it though.

I used this recipe as a guide, but made a lot of substitutions with things I had on hand. I did use the sausage and celery, but I also added a small apple, diced. I only had one small loaf of bread available (oh, and I took another commenter's advice and cut the pieces into cubes while the bread was still frozen -- works great!), so I made cornbread in a large cast-iron pan (which made the cornbread thinner.) Then, I cut up about 3/4 of the cornbread and added it to the mix. For spices, I used parsley, rosemary, sage -- and some chopped-up fresh cilantro I had. I ended up with way more than I could stuff into the turkey, so the rest went into a 9x12 pan, doused with some more chicken broth, and baked for about 30 minutes. Everybody loved both the stuffed and pan varieties. I was really surprised at how good the cilantro was -- and how fragrant. I'll be making this one again at Christmas.

We really enjoyed this stuffing. I made it the day ahead (using fresh herbs, mushrooms, and quite a bit more broth than the recipe called for) and then reheated it the next day for our Thanksgiving meal. Very easy and very tasty!

Was really good, used Italian sausage instead of regular pork sausage and that gave it a little more kick.

This recipe tastes so good and was simple to make. I had never had sausage in my stuffing before. I can't believe I waited so long to try this. Next time I will try apple sausage! Thanx for making me a fan!

It was just ok.  As I was making it, it seemed like way too much bread, but not having made stuffing before, I stuck to the recipe.  Turns out it was WAY too much bread for my liking.  The flavor was good.  I added sliced mushrooms which helped to have more than just bread.  If I were to make again, I'd at least half the bread amount.

I used a stick of butter, added 3 cloves of crushed garlic with the onion mixture, and 2 Tbls of poultry seasoning. It was delicious. I did not stuff the turkey so added more chicken stock during baking to keep it moist. Fabulous! Easy! Can do ahead and refrigerate in a ziplock bag.

I used 1 loaf of white and 1 loaf of wheat bread pulled into small pieces.  2 packages of regular sausage, 1 onion, and two stalks of celery, with 1 stick of butter.  I didn't use any chicken broth or an egg.  I then seasoned it with s&p, sage, and poultry seasoning.    I baked it at 325 for 30 min.  It turned out  great.  Not too moist or dry.

I didn't have sage, so I used half a teaspoon each of Thyme and Marjoram. At Thanksgiving dinner, those who already liked stuffing were heavily praising it. My oldest (adult) son tried it. He normally doesn't eat stuffing, but really enjoyed this one. I've added it to my recipes!

The best stuffing I have had. I think it was even better than my grandmas. We followed the recipe, except for the fact that instead of chicken broth, we used leftover turkey stock we had after making Chef John's recipe for make ahead turkey gravy (also found on all recipes). The richer stock put this over the top. I could eat a whole plate of this!

I gave it a 4 star just because it needs more seasoning and butter (IMHO). This recipe also needs the cooking time at the top of the recipe changed from 20 min. to 1 hour. The written directions say 1 hour. This is a great basic dressing that anyone can use as a base and then add their personal favorite add-ins. I added toasted pecans and slivered almonds. Our family likes mushrooms, water chestnuts and a small amount of cranberries. Yum. I had to add a little more liquid due to my alterations.

When I make stuffing, the dog won't even eat it. However, the Yankee bread stuffing turned out to be my good luck recipe. I did make 1 change. I added 1 1/2 Tbs of cognac. Really gave it a nice rich flavor, over all the guests enjoyed it. I used local sourced sausage, french bread, 1/2 red onion & 1/2 vidalia onion, & organic seasonings. I will definitely make this again, only this time I won't be using french bread.

I made this recipe  this past Thanksgiving Day and it was a hit.  The one change I made was to use bagged cubed potato bread (Martin's Dutch Brand, 12 oz).  As such, I added my chicken broth slowly,  so as not to drench the bread too much.  My nephew, who is a really finicky eater, asked me to make it every year.  I will be making it again for Christmas dinner, with the only change I plan on making (besides the bagged cubed potato bread), is to use crumbled breakfast sausage in place of the ground pork.  THANK YOU so much for the great and easy recipe!!!!

With a couple of additions, this has been my moms recipe for 60 years. She uses a stick of butter, more Bell Seasoning. and the big difference is adding 2 lg. sized russet potatoes, simmered in salted water until cooked. Also, lightly toast the bread and add more broth. Oh, and 1 and half pounds of sage sausage. The best stuffing in the world!...5 STAR!

I have been making this for 10 years or so and it is always a crowd pleaser. I use zesty hot breakfast sausage which gives it a little kick.

This recipe will be a staple for my holiday table.  I found a seasoned turkey stuffing bread and decided to give that a try for this recipe.  As a result, I reduced the sage to 1 tsp. from 1 1/2 tsp.  Also, the seasoned loaf seemed more dense than a regular loaf so I reduced the bread content to 1 loaf in place of the 2 loaves of white bread.   It was a really nice savoury dressing.

This is a great stuffing.  I have made this recipe the past two Thanksgiving's and there are never any leftovers.  My son refused to eat stuffing out of a box after eating this.  It is easy to prepare and a winner everytime.  Thanks for the great recipe

I usually do not enjoy stuffing - AT ALL - but this one is good!  I didn't drain the sausage and added a little more chicken broth for moisture.  My family keeps asking for it at during the holidays!  A simple and 'traditional' recipe.

This was great! I made it twice. First time I cut the bread up to big, and it wasn't quite right. The flavor was good but the appearance was not. Second time around I made the cuts smaller and it was perfect. This was a great change for us in the south. Our stuffings are usually seafood or cornbread.

Very good stuffing.  Some family members weren't crazy about the sausage but most of us really liked it.  Thanks!

This recipe is very tasty if you add your own seasonings(which I think it needed more) and also it needed 1 more egg to help bind it all together.

instead of using 1 lb of sausage, I use 1/2 lb of sage flavored sausage, delete the sage addition, and put in 1 c. of broasted chicken that we have the night before thanksgiving so I don't have to cook.  the other half of the sausage, I make sausage with gravy and eggs for breakfast the morning of the Holiday because I like to have a dinner atmosphere with the candles being a great essence of evening

I've never stuffed a chicken before, and this turned out great!  The only things I changed were much more garlic and I added boiled raisins, which I highly recommend.  Thanks, this is a keeper!
