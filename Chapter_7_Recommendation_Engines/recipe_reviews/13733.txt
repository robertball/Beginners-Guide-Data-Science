I let these sit in the refrigerator for about a week, tossing once a day before we tasted them.  These are great!  I like them for a quick snack.  I also added garlic and didn't bother to wrap the pickling spice, it just settles on the bottom anyway.

The best pickled egg recipe I have tried.
I didn't wrap the pickling spice, just added it to the jar. Turned out great.

This is my goto recipe for deer camp pickled eggs.  My tweaks are as follows. I add a tablespoon of minced garlic, one juliened red bell pepper, two hungarian peppers, two jalepeno peppers and layer everything. They are so tasty to eat with the eggs and there is a mild or hot pepper piece in the jar depending on the persons taste.  I also leave the pickle spice free as it has a nice look in the bottle with the minced garlic.  I use a bulk sized valasic pickle jar like you can buy from walmart(got to eat the pickles first of course) and keep all of the quantities the same as the recipe calls for, except I find that I can fit 18 eggs in the jar.  You may need a tad bit more liquid, but with the added ingrediants, it shouldn't be to much.

A great recipe. I use this and modify it whenever I pickle eggs or veggies. I do use apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar and I have found that red pepper flakes make it look good and help add to the flavor.

This is my first time making pickled eggs. Easy to make. Excellent flavor not overpowering. Just like the ones I had last fall at deer camp. Thank you for sharing Tracy.

Great recipe.  I added the pickling spices direcly to my brine and I also boiled my onions with it as well.  It turns out perfect everytime.  I also use this recipe for pickled hotdogs, my kids go crazy for them.

I have made these twice now and used raspberry balsamic vinegar which I love and it made the eggs pink/red on the outside. I did not put the spices into cheesecloth, just boiled them with the other ingredients and put in the jars. They were a hit!

I love this recipe. Using some others "adds" we like red bell, jalapeno, lots of onion and garlic, along with some chili flake. Like others I just add the pickling spice to the jar. These always come out perfect! Easy to modify if your making for others. Would love to make a batch with dill and possibly lemon peel one of these times, but always seem to "do" the same version. Very tasty, and everyone who eats one wants another.
As a kid my mother would off and on make pickled eggs, they were horrible. These aren't your moms pickled eggs, thank god!
Enjoy-

update: I've been using this recipe for years now.  Everyone loves them.  I make three dozen at a time for our camping trips!  I have a friend who loves them super spicey.  I add habaneros to my "standard" veggie add ins.  He loves them and looks forward to the delivery of "huevos diablo"  every year!

I've had many different pickled eggs in my life, but none I'd write home about. However, these were incredible and the best tasting I've ever eaten. What a treat!

I reduced the water to one cup and water bath canned the jars.
.
We use turkey eggs from our heritage turkey flock for this recipe. Just had the last jar from 4 years ago and they were spectacular. Stored in pantry at about 60 degrees.

Just ate one that I made yesterday and it was pretty good, I'm sure it'll be even better in a week. I couldn't find pickling spice at my regular mega grocery store for some reason, maybe they were out.  I just mixed my own with maybe a teaspoon of whole mustard seed, a dozen whole peppercorns, half a bay leaf crushed, a pinch of ground allspice, a pinch of cinnamon, garlic powder, ginger powder and ground clove and put that in the bottom of the jar.  Also added a sliced hot pepper.  Didn't have a jar to fit 12 eggs so I made half the brine but that left me with enough to fill two jars of 6 eggs, which is good because the white wine vinegar wasn't exactly cheap compared to regular white vinegar.  The eggs are really packed in (it looks like one is getting crushed) so I'll have to buy smaller eggs next time (I normally buy large or extra large).  Nice summertime snack.  I'd like to try it with regular vinegar.

Not bad. I have made pickled eggs several different ways, and I'd call this recipe fairly 'vanilla'. Not really any defining flavors other than vinegar with a slight hint of onion. I also did add a ton of fresh garlic.

I’ve made these a number of times.  They have great flavour and are wonderful to share, right it of the jar, as a snack, or even to make egg salad from.
