Wow!  This was delicious.  It's always nice to find a new way to appreciate zucchini, and this was new to me.  I can see this recipe becoming a summer staple.  I threw it all in the blender and added a little extra water towards the end to thin it.

Zucchini is a very-neutral flavored veggie, and I wondered if this gazpacho would be bland. Well, it was anything but bland,  full of good flavors.  That little bit of vinegar and the jalape√±o bring it to life, the avocado gives it a creamy texture, and the lemon juice brightens the flavor.  After I took the photo, I put it back into the food processor, and added a bit of water because I thought it was too thick (sort of like baby food), but that just may be a personal preference.  Do give it a chance to chill to allow the flavors to meld.  Thanks, Maria, for a tasty new gazpacho, a real summer treat!
