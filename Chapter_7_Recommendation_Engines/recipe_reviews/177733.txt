Have had this one for years.  Even our picky girls eat it up.   One change we make is adding frozen veggies (corn/peas/etc) as the soup comes to a boil.

I was hungry for white chicken chili but didn't have a lot of ingredients on hand to make it.  This recipe fit the bill.  The dry onion soup mix gave the chili an awesome flavor.  I did add a can of diced tomatoes with mild green chilis for a little more pep but other then that I made the recipe just like stated.  I will make this chili again and again.

Loved it.  I marinated the chicken with poultry seasoning and chili powder.  I also added more beans and peppers for an extra kick.

Overall really great, easy to make.  A little too oniony for our taste so I would probably cut the onion soup mix in half.  I would also look at adding white corn instead of so many beans.  We'll see how it works out!

This was my first attempt at White Chili and it came out quite well!  I did tweak it a bit though.  I used a bag of Pictsweet seasoning blend (frozen onions, celery, green peppers, red peppers), 1 TSP of minced garlic with the chicken, sauteed in olive oil.  I also used Progresso Chicken Cheese Enchilada soup in addition to the plain cream of chicken soup, as well as substituting chicken broth for the water. Cooked in slow cooker for 2 hours on Low.

I thought this was a good base recipe. Next time I will add more things to it - other Chicken Chili's I have had have sour cream in them to make it a little creamy.

There was way too many beans but very flavorful. Next time I will put in 1/2 can beans and more chicken. Thanks for the recipe!

I had to substitute pinto beans, and it was still good. I also used pre-cooked and chopped chicken and it took no time at all.

Pretty good.  A little salty. Could've been thicker, but had a good taste.

This is such an awesome start for a different chili.  I added diced sweet red peppers to the oil and chicken, also added a can of Tomatoes Okra and Corn mixture(brand i found was Margaret Holmes), didn't add quite as much dry onion soup due to the saltiness.  The last big change I made was using one can of Black Beans in place of one can,-(I love lots of beans in my chili) which changes the name to Black and White Chicken Chili! I also added a can of cheddar cheese soup at the end, instead of cheese on top, but definitely add the green onions, oh yum, yum, yum.

pretty good, though I had to make some adjustments. I agree with one reviewer the  soup tasted too oniony. I added 2 (4 oz) cans diced green chilis, 1/4 cup hot sauce, 1(15oz)can of drained corn, aprox. 1 tablespoon of chili powder to counter the taste of the onion soup mix. I than added 1 cup of sour cream prior to serving.

This was easy to make - I made it even faster by using canned chicken.  Not amazing but tasty and quick for a busy weeknight.

This was the first time I had made white chili, and I was satisfied.  It takes very little time and has a good flavor.

This dish had good flavor, but the recipe calls for too much water.  To eliminate the excess water, I added flour, which gave the dish the consistency of chili as intended.  Also added mushrooms for extra flavor.  Overall, a good dish but it did require "tweaking" to make it right.

After preparing the chicken as directed, I dumped everything into my crock pot and cooked it on low all day. It was delicious! As my family says, "It is a keeper."

I gave this 1 star and that was being generous. All I can say is if you liked this then you've never had good white chili.

I have made this several times.  My kids love it!  its an easy weeknight meal for sure!  I have made it exactly the way the recipe calls for and felt it was decent.  Then as I made it a few more times I have tweaked it a bit and it has become a family staple. Just a couple of notes:  I usually add a can of diced tomatoes for color and texture.  One time I didn't have the onion soup mix so I just chopped onion and garlic and sauteed until soft just prior to adding the chicken.  I added some cumin and salt/black pepper/ (to taste and crushed red pepper).  then prepared as directed.  Served with green onion cheese and avacodo...it came out amazing.  I like it better--tasted more fresh and less "processed" than it did when I used the onion soup mix.
