Because we've got issues with sugar and weight, I did use fat free evaporated milk, Splenda and Trader Joe's organic peanut butter. I'll tell you, noone could tell that they were lower in fat! Even my husband who turns up his nose at most of the lightened recipes I make ate three in one sitting! Thanks for sharing this....huge hit!

These were really good! I've made two batches so far. Both times I used skim milk and once I added a few tablespoons of cocoa powder. Definately will make again!

VERY GOOD!  This is a peanut butter lovers delight, a very rich and creamy treat.  The only change I made was to use 2% milk in place of whole milk.  I had a hard time unmolding them, so my suggestion would be to use cups that you could tear away in place of molds.  Thank you Heidi Lynn for your recipe!

Suprisingly we didnt like these.. must just be our personal preference I guess, as they seem to be very popular.

It was just ok for me... It's not that special as I was expecting. I adjusted the amount of the peanut butter to 1/2 cup, but still too rich for me.. I used the ZOKU quick pop maker I just purchased, so I didn't actually wait for 4hrs. I can still make this some other time, but maybe if I already forget the taste of it.

My daughter enjoyed them, but my husband and I didn't care for them.
