Just made it last night. I added a red pepper as well and at the end added a can of black beans that I had rinsed before. Not only was it nice looking but it tasted very good. Both my husband and son loved it.
Thank you!

I made this recipe precisely, except that I added about a 1/4 tsp. of cayenne and 1 tsp. of paprika for a little more kick. I thought it tasted excellent, and I'll definitely be saving it for future use as a side dish or a light main course. Thank you for a great recipe!

I added one green onion, a stalk of celery, about 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper.   I used 2 level  teaspoons of vegetable bouillon and slightly more than 2 cups water.    

This is my first dish with millet and I was afraid it might get too soft.  I stopped cooking just in time.  Next time I will use slightly less liquid and stop a little sooner in hopes of a little more crunch.

The time cooking seems a little greater than is stated but I always monitor it  toward the end and rarely pay close attention to time.  It is more important to inspect and taste.

I followed this as directed, only adding 1t. smoked paprika and 1/4 t cayenne.  It took about 15 minutes longer to cook than stated, and came out slightly crunchy, but mostly mushy.  I'm not sure if I did something wrong in the cooking or it's supposed to be mushy.  It was still a bit boring as a side dish, so I will probably add black beans and other spices to it.  I may then add cheese and eat as a meal.

This is surprisingly good, and it's a great way to hide veggies for picky eaters.  My 11 year old who "hates carrots" gobbled it up.

I would definitely make this again.  I did use organic chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.

This was super tasty as is, had with some grilled chicken. Not sure how diet it is since millet is known to block thyroid hormone, but it sure is tasty!
