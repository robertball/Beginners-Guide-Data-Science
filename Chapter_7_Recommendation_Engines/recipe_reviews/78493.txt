This looks alot like the recipe I use. Only I use Italian bread crumbs, a little in the meat and to coat, instead of the cracker crumbs. I also use two eggs and one grated carrot in the meat to keep it from getting too dry. The kicker is that I don't fry them in oil I just put them in the oven on 380 for about 35 min. This is a much healthier version. Served with ketchup or gravy, either is good.

Delicious with mashed potatoes and country gravy!  Only complaint - the patties didn't need to be cooked 7 minutes on each side, mine were definitely a bit overdone.  The crackers give a nice crispy coating.  I used the Lipton Beefy Onion soup mix instead of chili powder, and it was great.  Absolutely one of our new regulars.

This is soooo good!  I did make a couple of changes.  I brushed the patties with egg and then pressed the cracker crumbs in.  Like others, I had to keep cleaning out the skillet to get rid of burnt breading. Kept done ones on a rack on a cookie sheet in the oven at 300F while cooking the rest to keep warm.  I  used two eggs in the meat mixture. Did not need to be cooked 7 minutes... only until nicely browned. I made up a packet of Country Gravy and had mashed potatoes and corn.  True comfort food!  Will definately make again!

My husband loves these.  He calls them "hamburger steaks".  I get a package of hamburger patties already made up, which are pretty thick, season them them garlic powder, onion powder, steak seasoning, and pepper.   Cover them with flour, dip in mixture of egg and buttermilk, put them back in the flour and cook covered on medium heat till done.  About 4-5 min on each side.  Then I scrape the bottom of the iron skillet to get all the goodies off, drain all but about 2-3 tablespoons of oil, then add about 3-4 tablespoons of flour, cooking till brown, then I mix up a cup of milk and half a cup of water together and add it a little at a time till I get a thick gravy.  Pour over the steaks and serve with garlic mashed potatoes and veggie.  One delish meal.

I really get a kick out of "mock" anything, but I must admit I was kind of surprised at how close this came to real chicken fried steak!  I used ground turkey instead of beef, but in every other way I followed the recipe to the letter.  The chili powder is definitely noticeable, but since we like chili powder that was no problem.  And I actually think it's the combination of the chili powder and the saltines that makes this so steak-like.  I used a nonstick pan with a light coat of olive oil, and fried them on 7 minutes for the first side and 5 for the second (covered so that the meat would "bake" while it fried).  I served it with brown rice and a mushroom cream gravy - very tasty!  Thanks!

DELICIOUS!!! I'm currently living overseas and finding certain spices is nearly impossible... chili powder included, so I didn't use any. I used extra parsley instead. Aside from that one tweak, everything else was done by the book. I served with mashed potatoes and glazed carrots. I also used the drippings to make a basic gravy that you typically find being served with chicken fried steak. The ingredients are simple, the preparation is simple and the cooking part is simple... no complaints from me at all. This recipe definitely gets 5 stars from me! Thanks. =)

This was a nice change of pace from tacos and burgers, but I think it needs some changes.  As written, the chili powder is overwhelming and the crumbs don't stick to the patties.  I would half the amount of chili powder and dip the patties as regular chicken fried steak--flour, egg, flour or cracker crumb.  I lined and sprayed a baking sheet and cooked at 375 for 30 minutes like another reviewer suggested.  They cooked up great, but forgot to make the patties thin, as they shrink and plump when cooked.  I loved that these can be baked, so much healthier for you.  Next time I will try these changes and it could be a keeper.

All 3 of my kids loved this--a rare feat in our household!  I substituted ground turkey for the beef & added a packet of onion soup mix.  I also needed more than 1 cup of crushed crackers to coat the patties, maybe because of the texture of the turkey.  Served w/mashed potatoes & country gravy.  YUM!

Very good and easy.
I too did not use the chili powder, but used some dry onion mix(I get mine from the bulk store).
Don't need near the amout of saltine's listed. I wasted a lot.  Maybe 1/2 to 3/4 cup in the meat and then another 1/2 cup to coat.  I did not put in any salt, but did add pepper.  Loved the crunchy coating.  Also used very little oil to cook.  Just cook a bit more slowly so it doesn't burn.  Healthier that way.

Excellent. This is a super fast weeknight meal. Whole family loved it. I forgot the egg, omitted the chili powder and salt and instead put in a 2 minced garlic cloves, 1/2 package onion soup mix, 1/4 of a grated onion, 1 T of ketchup and pushed the patties into crushed club crackers (pulse in food processor until fine). Awesome and didn't even need gravy. I'll be making this over and over again. Soo fast too!

Great recipe! one thing i hate about "real" Chicken Fried Steak is the chewyness, This melts in your mouth. 
Great for saving on money too. Thanks! 
I always bake mine instead of frying. I have tried many alterations but the original recipe is great as is.

This was good...but was even better when I toasted some hamburger buns and put the chicken fried steak on it with some cream gravy topping.  Now that was good!

I season mine with a packet of the dry onion soup mix.  My family likes this.  Great for a quick meal on a busy night.  Experiment with different seasonings.  Serve on Burger Buns or with White Country Gravy.  Homemade french fries for your side.  Not very healthy, but sometimes you have to splurge...lol

This was pretty good.  I was very skeptical when I made this because I thought that it would just taste like hamburgers; well I was wrong.  I did not add the chili powder, instead I added Lawry's seasoned salt, garlic salt and pepper.  I was also out of crackers so I used panko crumbs.  I also added the same seasonings I used in the meat on the panko crumbs.  Turned out pretty good.  I will make again.

How easy is this recipe! My husband & I liked it very much. Good flavor. I put a beef gravy with it but it actually took away from the flavor of the meat. (Glad it was on the side) I will definitely make it again!

This was so good!   I had 1/2 lb of hamburger for two people, so I only added 1/4 cup crackers, since I didn't need to stretch it so far.  I didn't have any parsley, and I don't like chili powder, so I added a dash of garlic powder and a dash of onion powder.  It was plenty salty from the crackers,so I'm glad I didn't add salt.  I fried them in 2 Tbls oil and 1 Tbls margarine.  I've never been a fan of hamburger steak, but I'll be making this again!  Hubby wolfed his down. :)

This tasted sooooooooooooo good. I NEVER fry anything but i did this and I am glad. I did not measure any of the seasonings i just eyeballed it. I did add minced garlic, onion, mrs dash seasoning and some shredded cheese to the meat mixture. I had a few issues in making this, all my fault! I had problems with my crumbs that fell off burning in the oil, in moving the hot oil in the skillet to a different burning i dripped some and it caught on fire....OOPS, and i made mashed potatoes with it and burnt my stomach with boiling water, I was having a BAD night last night. But when I sat down with my husband to eat it and he ate THREE..it made it all worth it! so tasty and will DEFINITELY make again. I also threw these in the oven at 350 for 10 or 15 minutes on a cookie sheet to make sure they were fully cook

Other than omitting salt, we followed the ingredients as written. We stuck the “chicken” patties in the freezer for approx. 15 min. instead of using the refrigerator for 30.  This is a very quick, easy & tasty recipe.

These really are a lot like chicken fried steak.  Even my picky 16 year old son gave it a thumbs up.  I didn't have the crackers so I kind of did what Lavonda did. I made my patties & then dipped them in some floor that had all the spices in it, including some garlic, seasoned salt, & pepper, then dipped them in eggs, & in the flour again, and then fried.  I made some gravy with some of the grease, flour, & milk & water and I also made mashed potatoes.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing.

Very Very good!  I only had to change the egg due to my realization that I didn't have any :(  I used 1 Tbsp cornstarch and 3 Tbsp water as a substitute.  This worked very well.  The crackers gave this recipe some great crunch.  Thank you so much for sharing.  I will definetaly be keeping this one!

this is a good recipe. I did not have fresh ground beef but I had frozen hamburger patties. I made half a recipe and breaded the patties like it said to do with the fresh ground beef. they were good but I think I will try with fresh beef next time and mix the spices in. overall it was very good and will make again.

Made this as written except I had no fresh parsley and I baked it according to another reviewer's suggestion.  Delicious and simple; served it with rice; I bet macaroni and cheese with freshly-sliced tomatoes would go great with this.  Will definitely make again.

This wasn't bad, just lacking in something. It was pretty dry and not much flavor.  My son said if I put it in front of him again he'd probably eat it; but if asked if he wanted me to make it again, he'd want to know all of his options before saying yes.  I don't think I'll make this again.  I made mashed potatoes and green beans to go with this, along with a brown gravy.

I used Panko crumbs to coat the patties and saltine crackers in the mixture, used extra lean ground beef, and added some seasoning salt and pepper. Used very little oil in the pan. Did not refrigerate ahead. And, it was easy and delicious. No question, a 5-star.

What a great idea! I only had ritz type crackers in the pantry for the  coating-I just realized I forgot to add any into the ground beef mixture but it was still delish. I made a milk gravy in the pan with 2 tbl. of the drippings, 2 tbl. flour and 1 cup milk and served it over the meat and mashed potatoes for a side. Sliced vine ripened tomatoes for our veggie, gosh I felt like I was at grandmas house back east once again. Comfort food for sure! Thank you, OJ for a wonderful recipe.

Goodness my kids LOVED thesE!  The official request was can we have them for lunch AND dinner tomorrow???  LOL  My hubby who hates chicken fried steak liked this too!  I didn't use the spices recommended by the author but used the onion soup mix and baked for 30 min at 380F as one of the other reviewers suggested.  YUMMMY!

This was SUPER delicious. It was gobbled up by everyone in my family, including my 2 year old.  I didn't change anything at all - although I think next time I may try baking it because it was pretty greasy. I will be making this over and over again!

I made this last night and it taste just like chicken fried steak (without the gravy). I used 97% lean ground beef and it came out over-done and dried up but this is due to my cooking abitlities and not to the recipe. Maybe using more fatty beef will make a difference?

This recipe was so good! Of course, being the first time I made it and all, it took some work and seemed sloppy, but that's what gettin your feet wet is all about! My family loved it! The only problem I had was I couldn't keep the bits of coating that would fall of from burning, so I only seared them on the outside and baked them through. I also made Super Sausage Gravy on this site from Bob Evans and it turned out delish! This is a keeper. Thanks for putting this recipe up!

In my family we always called this "Poor Man's Steak".  It's delicious, easy and a good base recipe to add things (like soup mix) to change it up!  Very good!! My daughter (3 years old) LOVES this!!

Excellent. And simple. Its more of a Salisbury Steak than a chicken fried steak though. I served it with brown gravy and mashed potatoes and we ate the heck out of it. Will definitely make again.

This is pretty good.  My son is 28 and sooo picky and he didn't realize I had made it with ground beef.  He wanted seconds.  It is so hard to find something that he likes and so it is definately a keeper!

ok... so i thought this looked different and like something fun to do with ground turkey.  however, let's just call it like it is.  this is basically a fried hamburger.  we did think it was pretty good, but i don't think it was any better than a regular hamburger, and was a lot worse for you after being dredged in crumbs and fried.  i don't think i'll make this again.

Would they serve this in a 5 star restaurant? no, probably not...so why the 5 star rating then?! Because for so few ingredients and so little time, this is really really good. All I had on hand was some ground beef I needed to use and was sure I didn't wan't tacos, or pasta, as most ground beef recipes are. I came across this recipe and thought "why not?" For the herbs/spices I substituted 1 tablespoon of steak seasoning and used bread crumbs instead of saltines because it's what I had on hand. Quick, easy, and filling. We put some country gravy on top. Kids loved it and I will definetly add this to the rotating menu.

Awesome recipe!!  Being from Texas, I've had my share of chicken fried steak...and I have to say, this tasted amazingly authentic.  I have never had success making chicken fried steak at home, until now!!  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using dried parsley.  I didn't have any problem with the cracker crumbs falling off and burning, nor were the steaks overcooked.  I did cook them in two batches with half of the oil.  I served them with country gravy, mashed potatoes and corn. This was comfort food at its best...the entire family gobbled it up!!

This was a very pleasant surprise.  Great flavor! I made a pepper milk gravy to put over and it was a hit at my house. Used only enough oil to thinly coat the pan, but otherwise made as written.  Will make this again.

This was fantastic!  I changed a little up, but stuck to the basic idea of the recipe.  I left out the chili powder, and added in it's place; garlic, pepper, dry onion soup mix, and a tiny pinch of crushed red pepper.  I also substituted the crackers for plain bread crumbs, which I seasoned with garlic, pepper, onion powder and parsley.  I fried it for 6 minutes per side in a little bit of olive oil.  This turned out to be the best chicken fried steak I have ever had...

This was exceptionally good for a "mock" anything.  I can't believe how simple it was to make and just how closely it resembled CFS.  Tip- you do not want to crush the crackers to finely.  A medium blend is perfect for this recipe.    My family prefers this to real CFS now because we actually know whats under the breading. This is awesome served with a pepper gravy or country gravy.  Simple recipe. Excellent likeness. Will absolutely be sharing with family and friends.  Thanks for sharing!!!

My kids say this is a five star recipe. I made it gluten free by substituting rice crackers for the saltines. They are not as salty as saltines so I had to add 2 extra teaspoons of salt. They seemed to brown quickly so I only cooked them 5 minutes per side.

I made so many changes that I feel silly even rating this recipe. 

I used ground turkey seasoned with garlic powder onion powder and pepper. I used saltine crumbs and baked the patties in a 375 degree oven for 30 minutes. They turned out great. Thanks for a chance to have my favorite greasy spoo dinner without the extra fat and calories.

Cooked this last night for my picky family of 5 and had no complaints. Followed the directions of one of the reader by using itallian bread crumbs, 2 eggs .. After 15 mins of baking, removed them from the lined pan and replaced with another sheet of foil to remove the excess fat and turned them over and cooked another 15. Served with creamed white gravy, mashed potatos,corn and bisquits. Highly recommend!

my husband love chicken fried steak, but i never order it because they always use the worst cut of beef. using ground beef, however, seemed better because it's more like a hamburger. i tried it out last night with mashed potatoes and gravy and we will definitely be having it again. thanks for the creative recipe. other than using dried parsley instead of fresh (it's what i had on hand)i didn't change a thing.

I love chicken fried steak, but it is sometimes chewy and isn't super healthy.

I've made this a few times and my wife and I love it.

I've even made it with turkey meat and used olive oil to cook it in.  It's super tasty and much healthier than regular CFS.  Great recipe!

Delicious! Husband and 2 year old loved it.  Used only about 1 1/2 cups cracker crumbs.  Be sure to not make the patties too thick or it takes too long to cook.  Served with a quick pan beef gravy

I enjoyed making this{so easy} as much as eating it--yum. Most important my husband and kids(age 2&5)ate it very!! well. We've had it twice in two weeks. I also used the lipton beef&onion soup mix because it sounded more flavorfull. Glad I found this recipe!!

My whole family of 6 loves this recipe.  We make a gravy from the drippings...(found it on this site from another chicken fried steak recipe), with mashed spuds and corn we have a complete, inexpensive meal!

I loved this and so did my 20 month old daughter.  I did only put in  1/4 tsp of chili powder and I added a little granulated garlic.

I ground my own beef. I use London broil and trim off the fat. I used ½ teaspoon kosher salt, and one egg white whisked with water instead of the whole egg. I used unsalted Saltine crackers and fry in canola or grapeseed oil.

I love CFS but often I find that it's not the tenderest cut of meat and I hate to have CFS that is chewy.I love this recipe it was great, so easy to make & tender. Now here is what I did different from the recipe: I had some Spicy Tennessee Pride roll sausage left over from yesterday's breakfast that I mixed in to make it stretch and to give it a kick, I was out of parsley, I used just a teaspoon of chili powder, lightly seasoned the meat with garlic & onion powder, salt, black pepper, Tony Chachere's Famous Creole Seasoning, & Cavender's Greek Seasoning. Also I would suggest crush the saltine crackers very fine in a bag. I served it with Southern Mills Old Fashion Pepper Gravy, and mashed potatoes. Next time I make this I'm going to do it breakfast style with cheddar scrambled eggs, & hash browns,

This was really tasty, and of course less chewy than chicken fried steak I've had.  I made some simple beef gravy, but white gravy would be good.

These were yummy, although I must admit I didn't exactly follow the recipe.  I used the chili powder but I added a packet of Ranch dressing mix.  Next time I will add some onion soup mix, i just didn't have any today.  Oh - and I added an extra egg.  As for the cooking - i did it two ways.  Fried them in canola oil for my kids and baked at 380 in the oven for about 30 minutes for me.  Both ways were equally yummy. No need to add all those fat grams -- the baked were crispy and yummuy too!

I have to give this 5 stars.  This was excellent and easy to prepare.  I cooked for the recommended time and it was about right.  I probably could've done about 5 mins on each side though.

no matter how you slice it ? it's breaded meatloaf. It just doesn't have the same taste and texture as real chicken fried steak.   It reminded me of when I'm out of coffee and have to resort to tea. no matter how strong I make it it just isnt' coffee.

This was GREAT.  I'm making it for a second time because we had no leftovers the first time, and I like finding things that are different to do with ground beef.  My husband LOVED it and so did I and the elementary age kids!  We didn't serve with gravy - didn't want the extra calories, and didn't feel like we were missing anything not having.  Thanks for sharing an easy and really delicious dinner recipe!

This was a great easy meal!  I didn't use the chili powder, but put in some Nature's Seasoning, and used Italian bread crumbs instead of crackers.  These were great as left overs too!

Very quick and easy. I only substituted Ritz for the crackers b/c we didn't have Saltine. I also didn't add salt. I served w/ gravy and it was yummy. You know it's not the real thing, but not a bad copycat:)

Absolutely loved the flavor, I used Italian bread crumbs instead, and I am a garlic lover so of course I added that. My 18 month old son loved it. I paired it with mashed potatoes/ green beans and gravy! YUM I also cut the oil so it was not as greasy, just enough to coat the pan!

This was very tasty!  The chili powder added a nice, slightly smoky flavor.  I did change the recipe by baking, as others suggested, at 380, instead of frying, to avoid extra oil and a messy stovetop.  Genius!  This was a real kid pleaser, too.

This was a great way to stretch a pound of ground beef. My family loved this and it was very similar in texture and taste to the type of CFS you get from a frozen product. Personally I wasn't impressed, but it was okay. I would eat this again. Thanks for a great way to serve up boring ground beef.

This was totally awesome! The whole family loved it, even the kids! That's hard to do! I was going to change what I coated the patties in but my daughter and I stuck to the recipe and it turned out great! The hubby wished there was more! I made a nice, white gravy to go with it. Awesome! Will definitely make again and will be sure to take a picture next time! Yummmm-meeeeee!

I'm rating the meat part 5 stars.  Fantastic.  Solves the problem of chewiness/toughness in cube steak.  I used ground turkey.  Had to add a few tablespoons bread crumbs bc too sticky.  Delicous and tender.  For the coating and gravy, I used "The Best Chicken Fried Steak" from this site.  Best meal at our house in weeks.  NO ONE COMPLAINED!  Definitely a repeat.

I have made this several times now, and I think I have it down pretty well. I can use either one egg or a little mayo to bind the ground beef together with a little parsley, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, a dash of cayenne pepper, some butter cracker crumbs, salt, and ground black pepper. I premake the patties the night before and refrigerate overnight, it seems to meld everything together better and keeps the patties from breaking apart. I use butter crackers for the coating seasoned with the same seasonings as in the patties. I coat the patties directly in the cracker crumbs, turning several times to ensure a good coating, and pressing the crumbs into the patty, then I fry in hot oil in my electric skillet for about 5-7 minutes each side. You have to make sure that both sides are cooked thoroughly, even a little dark, or the coating falls off or turns soggy. I place a sheet of foil over a large cookie sheet and place a cookie cooling rack over the foil, set my oven to 200, and when a patty comes out of the skillet, I place it directly onto the cooling rack and keep in the oven until dinner is ready, and the patties lose the greasy exterior and stay crunchy and warm. Husband didn't like this recipe and wouldn't hardly eat any of it when I first started making it, now he likes it and eats it all!

I prepared my patties ahead of time, and let them rest in the refrigerator for about an hour and a half.  Doing this kept the coating from falling off while frying. Very easy and my family enjoyed it!

My husband LOVES this recipe and it is less expensive to make than other chicken friend recipes because we always have ground beef on hand.  I make it different everytime depending on what ingredients I have so it doesn't require anything to be bought especially for the recipe.  Lots of good ideas in the reviews of this recipe, too.

Very good recipe.  I substituted 1/3 c of saltines with Italian bread crumbs.  Made a few slight alterations because I like spicy.  Thank you very much for the recipe.

The family loved this!  Even our 3 year old!  It's definitely a keeper.  My husband said "It will keep husbands happy.  That's man food!" lol.  I didn't use the chili powder but rather some onion powder, garlic powder, and pepper instead.

I gave it 4 because you have to add gravy which isn't included in the recipe.  I was stunned how this held together and everyone thought it was good.  It needs to be spiced up a little for us in the future, but I won't ramble on like many do.  Just like C.F.S. just don't need a knife to eat it.

My Mom is 95 and she knows her Chicken Fried Steak, she loved this. For someone like me that doesn't like to even try and fry steak this is perfect. Tender, seasoned well and served with MacCormicks white gravy it is great.

very impressed!  i figured this wasn't going to be very good because it was "mock" but it was very good!  i left out the chili powder and used a bunch of crushed up crackers but other than that, i followed the recipe exactly...like i said, very impressed!  the whole family loved it!  would definitely make again!

We really love this - especially by making some pan gravy to go along with it.  I use a mixture of gr sirloin and gr turkey to lighten it up a little and it still turns out great.

I made this for 3 Navy men, me and my 10 year old daughter. I doubled the recipe and there was only one patty left. I made it with Kickin' Collard Greens(on Allrecipes) It was delicious and relatively simple. The only thing I did differently was to dip the meat patties in milk before covering in the saltines, I found it made it stick more easily. A tip* Crush the saltines in the bag, its fast and easy, and mess free.

You know, this is a really good recipe.  I even forgot to add an egg to the patties AND forgot to coat the outside with the leftover cracker crumbs and it STILL turned out really good.  I would definitely make this again and make it like the recipe reads.  The only change I made (besides the stuff I forgot) is I used about a pound and a half of meat instead of just the one pound.

I rated this recipe three stars, but I think with some changes, it could be a four (maybe even 5 stars).  I followed the recipe exactly with a few very minor changes (I added some garlic powder, Worcestershire sauce and a bit of soya to the meat mixture to try to moisten it up a bit).  We found that the patties were WAYYYYY too salty in the end.  It's really important to note (and I'm surprised nobody has mentioned it yet), that if you are using salted crackers (salted tops), then there is no need to add salt to the meat mixture.  Also, as I mentioned, the meat mixture was pretty dry; IMHO 1 cup of crackers is way too much to add - 1/2 cup would be more than sufficient.  Lastly, I made a peppercorn gravy to serve with it and both my DH and I agree that this dish would be pretty bland without it.  Here is my recipe for peppercorn gravy.  Once the patties are cooked, remove from the (cast iron) skillet.  Reserve 1/4 cup of the drippings; to the oil add the following to the pan: 4 Tbsp of flour, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp paprika and 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  Cook for a few minutes (to cook the floury taste out of the mixture).  Add 2 cups milk and stir until thick, then add 1 1/2 tsp of crushed peppercorns, stir and serve with the patties.  This gravy recipe is also really good with the real thing (real chicken fried steak!)

My family loved this recipe.  I didn't have saltines, so I substituted ritz crackers and used just a little less chili powder.  My 6 yr old son (picky eater) said this was the best dinner ever!

It wasn't what I expected. It was bland, and the crackers didn't stick to the outside of the meat when frying. I made my own country gravy, and that made the difference. Together it was good. My husband tried it with the gravy and without and didn't like it. Instead, he added ketchup, and was able to finish his dinner. I doubt I'll make this again.

This was a really good recipe. The only thing I changed was I put in less chili powder because I know my husband isn't fond of overly spiced foods. I really did enjoy it, but I will be adding less chili powder next time for my husband. This really is a good mock recipe. Very much like chicken fried steak.

While these were good I am not exactly sure I would relate them to chicken fried steak. To make them more CFS like I would ditch the crackers and dip the patties in an egg/milk mixture then dip in regular old flour - they would be much more authentic this way. I also don't really see the need to have the bread crumbs mixed into the meat. I added more seasonings to suite my families taste, shredded carrots into the meat to sneak in veggies and help with moisture, and pan fried them in about a tablespoon of oil. While they came out good as the recipe is written I will definetly make my changes next time to see if they can be even better. I will also try baking them on racks in the oven to emliminate the need for oil.

This is a good idea to build on. I made it without the salt and chili powder and mixed up a package of white cream gravy and poured it over the steaks. DH didn't know he was eating ground meat. It could use some seasoning, onion etc. It fried up really well after sitting in the fridge.

This was a great recipe! I cut down on the salt that was supposed to be added because of all the saltines. I also used less oil and substituted cracked balck pepper instead of chilli pepper. Served with country gravy and was a very yummy meal. Thanks!

I'm adding this recipe to my repertoire. It's a quick and tasty way to turn plain old hamburger into something a bit more classy. I did find this to be a bit too salty, so I'll cut some of the salt next time. The chili powder was interesting, but a bit overpowering--try halving the amount you use and adding an equal amount of fresh-cracked black pepper instead. Overall very tasty.

This is a great, easy dinner.  My husband and son both loved it.  I thought it was pretty good too.  I did not use the chili powder and subbed Lipton soup mix instead, as others had advised.  Didn't need to cook all 7 minutes per side.  Made gravy to go with and had a great new item to add to our menu!

This was a great new twist on another use for ground beef. Since my children don't like spicy food I used a Lipton Soup mix to season the meat. I also used an egg wash so that the cracker crumbs would coat the patties better. We had fried potatoes, pepper gravy, and steamed brocolli to complete the meal.

My boyfreind cared for this much more than I did.  He actually had seconds! I did not have saltine crackers on hand so I used garlic flavored ritz crackers.  I did not use as much oil listed on the recipe.  I used a non-stick pan and about two tablespoons oil.  I will keep because my boyfreind liked so much however not a favorite of mine

I did not make any changes . The mocked chicken fried steak was delicious. Everyone in my family said make sure I cook this dish again.

One of my favorite dinners to make! They are just as good (or better) baked instead of fried. Flat on a baking sheet, 350-375 until they are golden and the inside is done. Perfect with mashed potatoes and gravy!

Family loved it! I used panko instead of crackers.  I also added chopped fresh garlic, a little fresh dried basil and oregano to the panko. I omitted the parsley but still used the chili powder.  Served with beef gravy. Will be making this again!

Mine tasted like meatloaf patties, not sure if I messed up or what but we're big fans of meatloaf so there were no complaints.  Definately CUT BACK the cook time.  I forgot to make gravy so we topped with bbq and ketchup.

My family genuinely loved this so I can't vote it poorly but I wasn't happy with it.  I'm a very amateur cook and had hoped for a tad more wow effect considering the attention those little buggers required, the impossible to clean pan afterwards, and the blasted bread crumbs when they somehow find their way to the floor.

This was delicious. I didn't have chili powder so used Tabasco Green, also crackers in the mixture and bread crumbs for the topping. I combined recipes with "Country Fried Stack and Milk Gravy" by using their recipe for the gravy. Also because I thought the roux would turn out better, I used butter to fry rather than oil. Perfect for a cold February night in Wisconsin. Thank you for sharing.

My eldest son liked this but the two younger ones and husband snubbed it.  I have to admit, it didn't taste very good.  Maybe because I used Panko crumbs instead of saltine crackers.  I need to try this with saltine crackers to be able to give a fare rating.  This is a good alternative though, to use ground beef.

This was pretty good. I really liked the flavor but i found the cooking time to be a little too long. The first batch i cooked for the full 7 min. on each side like the recipe states and they turned out very dry. The next batch I cook for almost 5 min. on each side and they turned much better.

Wow!! It really did taste like chicken fried steak! It was delicious! I substituted ground turkey for the beef b/c that's what i had, but still turned out awesome. Even my picky eaters gobbled this up. Thanks for this super recipe!

This was awesome and so much easier than making real chicken fried steak!  I adjusted the seasonings a little ( added Montreal steak seasoning and cut back on the chili powder), but followed the recipe exactly after that.  Served it w/ gravy, mashed potatoes, and green beans, YUM!  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I followed this recipe with following exceptions: I ran out of crackers so I used cornflakes for the outer crust. Also, I cooked each sid eonly 3-4 minutes and it was well done. I served this the first time with mashed potatoes and cream of mushroom for gravy. This recipe warmed up well out of the fridge and served again with corn and green beans. Very filling and husband pleasing, had everything on hand, will definately make again.

Sorry but i did NOT like this.  Very bland to me needs more flavor.  I even had it with milk gravy. Maybe i used to lean of burger because it was very dry and not moist at all.

Why this is called Mock Chicken, I'll never know.  It's good, but it's just hamburgers.  I don't understand the title of Mock CHicken Fried Steak.  It IS good though.

OMG! *sobbing with culinary joy*  What a great idea!  The only thing I did different was the ground beef itself.  I buy chuck roast when it's dirt cheap, cut it into cubes and freeze in one lb pkgs.  Then I pulse in the food processor (in 2 batches) until it's ground however I want it.  For this I ground it a bit coarser than for burgers.  The texture was perfect.   Thank you for posting this!

this was a first for me making CFSteak. It was pretty easy, I substituted onion soup mix for the spices called for. Hubby thought it was good.  Defintely need the country gravy to make it great. I'll probably make this again, but not an every month recipe for me.

Hubby LOVED this!  I made it exactly the way the recipe says except i used dried parsley and grated carrot to sneak some veggies into his diet.  Served it with homemade hashbrowns and homemade brown gravy. Yummo :-)

I followed the recipe  (added dried onions and garlic powder) up until rolling in the crackers.  I dipped each patty in a dish with an egg in it, then I dipped it in the dish that had the mixed crackers with Italian style breadcrumbs.  I fried this on a lower heat. I ended up avoiding the burning of the breadcrumbs because of this.  Country style gravy and homemade smashed potatoes rounded out the meal. 
One of my favorite things is Chicken fried steak, so I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.

This was a good week night meal.  It was easy and fast.  I also served mine with a package of gravy, and cut back on the salt.

I think that I did a few things wrong here - first, I used ritz crackers instead of saltines, which made it too rich.  And, the tablespoon of chili powder was way too much - I'd use a quarter or a half tablespoon next time.  
But, overall, my husband said it didn't really work for him, using hamburger instead of steak...
