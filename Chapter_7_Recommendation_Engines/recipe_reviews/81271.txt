I made just the meringue from this recipe to go on "Easy Key Lime Pie I" from this site. It called for 5 egg whites, so it was perfect. I think it called for a bit too much sugar- I would use only 1/2 cup next time. But it was easy to whip up and tasted great on the pie. I'll try using the rest of this recipe next time.

Great recipe!  I added some green food colouring so it looked different than lemon meringue.

I also just made the meringue it was fantastic and super simple.  Update 2/20 I just made this again but just the pie part, i only used 4 egg yolks and 3/4 cup lime juice and 1/4 lemon juice, baked for 25 mins was absolutely fabulous!  Thanks for the awesome recipe can't wait to make the meringue and pie together in the near future!

I made this, but as it chilled the eggs whites sort of lost their oxygen and turned back into liquid. What did I do wrong?

The pie is in the oven, so I haven't tasted it yet. But it looks FABULOUS! This recipe was very easy to make. It took some time, but I think it will be well worth it! I didn't have a gram cracker crust, so I made a regular crust myself. Got to go check on it......

Had a hard time to get the meringue to get fluffy so I had to resort to an old cook book. Other than that it turned out great and was enjoyed by the whole family.

The key to making the meringue better is to add the cream of tartar AFTER the egg whites have been whipped into soft peaks and sift only 1/2 cup of powdered sugar. Any more and it becomes too sugary and loses that creamy meringue taste and texture.

Followed it exactly- pie total liquid, meringue didn't set.  Never made a meringue pie before. Maybe there are some presumptions made in the directions that I don't know about.
