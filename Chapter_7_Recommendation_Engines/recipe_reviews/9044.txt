Delicious!  After one bite, my husband said this was the best chicken parmesan he has ever had and told me immediately to put this one in the recipe box.  I have to agree, this dish is definitely more than worthy of 5 stars.  There are changes I would say is a must though, and I read a lot of the reviews.  If you don't do anything else, do these three things - #1) Pound your chicken breasts to an even half-inch thickness.  This allows the chicken to stay moist and cook evenly in the skillet.  #2) Cut the breading/parmesan mixture in half and reduce the beaten egg to 1.  It was more than enough for me, and this is the type of ingredient you can always make more of, but if you make too much at first it will go to waste. #3) Add the cheese slices the last 5 minutes of cooking.  20 min. would be too long and burn the cheese.  After 5 min. my cheese melted perfectly.
 I also added a bit of garlic powder & onion powder to the bread crumb mixture, and used Mozzarella cheese slices instead.  As a time saver, when you buy a value pack of chicken breasts, pound some and put them individually in ziplock bags in the freezer.  You can defrost them on short notice for this meal.  I also prepared most of it while my 10 month old napped, and put the prepared 9x13 dish in the fridge until I was ready to pop it in the oven.  I love everything about this recipe, from prep to taste - try it!!

This recipe is the BOMB! It's so easy and incredibly delicious. The only thing that I did differently was that after I coated the chicken with the breadcrumb/parmesan cheese mixture, I set it aside in the refridgerator for about 30 minutes so that the coating would stick really well to the chicken when it was cooking in the skillet later. I also used mozarella cheese slices rather than monterey jack cheese.

OMG!  This was fabulous!!!  Only made a few changes out of necessity as I didn't have all the ingredients on hand....  Added extra dried onion and garlic powder, dried oregano and sweet basil to the bread crumbs as I didn't have the seasoned variety on hand.  Tip from other reviewers:  Pound the chicken to 3/4", let the coated chicken sit in the fridge for 20 minutes prior to preparation so that the breading will stick better.  Didn't have Monterey Jack cheese so I subbed smoked mozzarella which sent it over the top!!!!  Absolutely sublime!!!  Used Bertolli's tomato and basil sauce and mixed the remainder of the sauce with cooked egg noodles al dente and then layered the egg noodles on the bottom of the baking dish.  Put the chicken on top and then cooked for 15 minutes.  Per other reviews, added the cheese the last 5 to 7 minutes to melt and brown.  This was unbelievabley good and definitely going into my rotation.  You absolutely have to try this!  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!!!!

I did like everyone else and refrigerated the breaded raw chicken before cooking- that really does work well.  I didn't fry the chicken, just baked on a cookie sheet about 20 minutes, before putting the whole thing together in a lasagna pan.  I also added the jack cheese during the last 5 minutes, as others suggested.  My husband thought he didn't care for chicken parm, but this was a real hit. It turned out perfect, crispy and moist. Thank you Alicia

This was a delicious dish! I did not follow the recipe exactly... Instead of only putting the sauce in the pan, and setting the chicken ON TOP, I poured the sauce on the bottom of the casserole dish, and then I poured the rest of the jar ON TOP of the chicken! This made for a more tender dish. Also, I sprinkled parm. cheese on the dish before I put it in the oven. Overall, it was delicious, tender and tangy-- YUM!! Overall grade: A+

This is a great recipe! My family of 6 all loved it. I used Italian bread crumbs, and took advice of others and baked the coated chicken for about 20 minutes prior to baking the dish, instead of frying. I then assembled the chicken over the sauce and baked for 15 minutes then last 5 minutes I added the cheese. I think that this makes delish chicken nuggests/strips as well.

This was a great recipe! The whole family LOVED it!  I did make a few minor changes.  I used chicken tenders instead of filets.  The chicken cooked much quicker and uniformly.  I also preheated the oven to 350, sprayed a cookie sheat whith Pam and baked chicken for 20 min. to cut down on fat from the oil in pan frying.  I also added parm. cheese, salt & pepper to the Italian bread crumbs!  Will make over and over again!

My kids light up when I tell them we're having chicken parm for dinner. Without having to make your own sauce, this is a nice quick dinner for those on the run evenings. I liked the idea of the Monterey Jack cheese instead of the traditional mozarella. A tip for "BRANDYNM" who's breading was falling off while frying; place your breaded chicken cutlets in the fridge for about thirty minutes or so and you won't have a problem. (a non stick pan helps too) Thanks Alicia.

I don't know what makes this so good, but this is the best chicken parmesan that I have ever had.  I followed the recipe and had wonderful results.  I didn't use the monteray jack but rather mozzarella out of personal prefrence.

This is a great dish! Everyone in the family loves this chicken parmesan!  Here are my suggestions: 1. Use Olive Oil instead of veggie oil. It has better taste and is better for you!   2. Use Italian Seasoned Panko Bread Crumbs. They hold together and crisp up better.  3. To avoid having your chicken stick to the pan, and the coating fall off, warm your pan up first before adding the oil. Warm pan + cold oil= less stick.  4. Pan fry the chicken first for 4-5 minutes each side then stick in oven for 15 minutes on a cookie sheet. Pull out and add sauce, stick back in oven for 15 more minutes (adding cheese the last 5 minutes). Perfectly crispy, juicy chicken!  5. Use more sauce and serve over spagetti noodles!

Tasty and was enjoyed by all. Per previous reviews, served over fetticine alfredo.  I added cooked chopped brocoli over all.  The only thing I'd change is that next time, I plan to make my homemade alfredo sauce...used store bought and didnt taste as well.  Still, my family agrees it should be made again.  I should also note how easy this recipe was! Thanks for the good dinner idea!

This is the best Chicken Parmesan ever! My husband loves this and asks for it at least once a week. I usually cook it on a George Foreman grill to cut down on the oil in frying it. Make sure to use the real grated Parmesan cheese.

I made this for dinner for me and my boyfriend.  My chicken parm has never come out so good!  I used this recipe as a base, also read about 10 pages of reviews to modify mine.  Since it was just me and my bf, I didn't even have to pound out the chicken, I just cut a piece in half long ways and that was good for both of us!  I used a little less than an egg in one dish.  In my mixture dish, I added bread crumbs, parm cheese, basil, oregano, a bit of garlic powder, and adobe.  I dipped each piece in those and put on tin foil in the fridge for 20 minutes.  I then cooked the chicken in the oven for 15 minutes on 350 degrees.  Then, I took the chicken out, added some pasta sauce under the chicken (it was a garden veggie sauce), put the chicken back in, the put sauce on top, then put the chicken back in at 375 degrees for 10 minutes-once it was in for 5 minutes, I added some provolone to the top and put back in.  Thought 5 mins would be enough to melt the cheese, but it really needs more time.  Served over pasta with tomato sauce on top, then chicken (with tomato sauce on top and provolone).  Last I garnished with a bit of parsley.  It was great!

I make this all the time and my family loves it! I dredge a little differently though. First I pat the meat dry, dredge in salt n' peppered all purpose flour, tap of the excess flour, dip in beaten eggs, and finally coat with the breadcrumb-parmesan mix to which I add some dried rosemary. The chicken breasts stay incredibly tender and moist when I do it this way. And the added rosemary adds a warm and fragrant touch to the chicken.  Wonderfully easy and so good! Thanks for the recipe!

This dish is amazing! I bought thin chicken breasts to make the cooking more even & so they would take on the flavor of the breading & cheese. I mixed italian bread crumbs, additional italian seasoning, garlic salt, onion powder & a little crushed red pepper. I coated the chicken in milk & egg then breaded them. I put them in the refrigerator for approximately an hour before pan searing them to help keep the breading from falling off when searing. I doubled the sauce (we like a lot of sauce) & didn't add the cheese until the last 5 minutes of cooking. I layered a piece of mozarella on each chicken breast and sprinkled parmesan cheese over the whole dish before baking the final 5 minutes. I served with angel hair pasta & a garden salad. This is definitely a keeper!!

I realized when reading this recipe that cooking any chicken on medium-high for 8-10 minutes per side is completely crazy and will result in ruined chicken.  I pounded my chicken very thin (about 1/2 inch) like other suggested.  I put the chicken on medium-high for about 2 minutes on each side.  Next time I'll put the burner at medium because medium-high almost burnt them, even at 2 minutes.  Using a non-stick pan with a little extra oil kept the coating on just fine.  I followed the rest of the recipe just as it is written and it was very good.  The chicken comes out very juicy.  It's so easy that I will definitely make this again.

This is how my mother made chicken parmesan.  I always "double bread" or dip my chicken in the bread crumb and egg mixtures twice for an extra thick coating.  I add garlic powder and oregano to the italian bread crumbs along with the parmesan cheese.  I use olive oil instead of veg. oil and mozzarella instead of monterey jack. Any kind of pasta sauce will work, but homemade is the best!

This was so simple & delicious! I kept to the two eggs and used a whole jar of Pulix brand tomato/mushroom/garlic pasta sauce instead. I found that the chicken breasts were finished cooking in the skillet (covered) around 5-6 minutes on each side, 8-10 would've burned them. In the bread crumbs I added parsley, onion powder & garlic salt for flavoring and for the cheese I used a blend of mozzarella, cheddar and Monterey jack! Not mybusual choice but I was feeling it. Once everything wad ready to go in the oven I layered the dish with sauce, then chicken then sauce, then sprinkled the cheese ALL OVER te dish and topped with Parmesan. I added spaghetti noodles with olive oil & parmesan sprinkles along with it and my family was literally linking their bowls; wow!! I started preparing the meal when my hubby took our son to Home Depot and it was just finished upon heir return- roughly 45 minutes or less. Bonus!

I want to add a "me too" review to the other glowing reviews for this recipe. After my husband had taken two bites, he said, "Wow! This is some good chicken!"

Like others, I chilled the chicken after breading to make a better coating. I also substituted mozzarella cheese for the monterey jack.

My breading mixture was 2 to 1 bread crumbs to parmesan cheese ratio (specifically 1/2 c. crumbs & 1/4 c. parmesan cheese, for 2 chicken breasts). Used 1/4 c. egg beaters with a splash of milk rather than whole egg to cut down the cholesterol a little.

I spooned sauce over the tops of the chicken  breasts before they went into the oven & I didn't add the cheese until the last five minutes - just long enough for it to melt down over the chicken!

Served with a nice red wine blend of cabernet savignon & shiraz ... delicious!!

This will become a regular to the repertoire!

This is my husbands favorite meal. He always has me make this when we have company. To avoid soggy breading, I pour sauce over the top after I take it out of the oven. There are never any leftovers when I make this!

This chicken parmesan is great and easy to make!  I skipped the frying step and put the chicken straight in the oven (adding the cheese for the last 15 minutes or so) and used fat-free mozarella to keep it light.  Great recipe!

Excellent!  Family loved it.  Used provolone instead of Montery Jack (goofed and picked up the wrong cheese at the store) - Still tasted great!  Served with "Green Beans with Cherry Tomatoes" recipe from this site, salad and garlic bread.  Yummy!

I made this recipe tonight and it was excellent.  The only changes I made were:  I pounded out my chicken breasts so they weren't so thick.  I dipped the chicken in egg and then flour and then the breadcrumb mixture.  I baked it in the oven for 15 minutes, then added sauce on top of the chicken and added whole milk mozzarella cheese on top at that point.  Then I left it in the oven for another 6-7 minutes.  

I didn't have any homemade sauce around so I used Old World Ragu which was parmesan and romano cheese flavored.  It was really good.  The cheesy sauce was a good combination (if you have to use jar sauce).

EXCELLENT RECIPE!!!!

OH yummy Alicia...we liked this a lot.  This is really easy and quick to put together.  Perfect for those nights where there's not a lot of time to spare in the kitchen.  I love Monterey Jack, but like to sub Provolone when I have it.  I didn't have any trouble with the breading.  Like a previous reviewer suggested...put your breaded chicken in the fridge for about 30 minutes before time to cook and you shouldn't have any problems.  I prefer using Ragu spaghetti sauce with this recipe rather than making my own. Will make again.  Thanks for submitting.

Awesome!!!!  I made just a few changes.  Used chicken tenders instead of the full breasts.  Added fresh oregano and basil to the bread crumb mixture and used mozzzerella instead of jack cheese.  Paul NEwman's Bombolina sauce is great with this and used the whole jar if you want some left over for pasta.  Family loved it!! It also looks "pretty" to serve for company.  Mange!

This was fabulous! For the parmesean breading, i used half fresh grated parmesan and half powdery parmesan. I double coated the chicken, put them in the fridge before sauteing for 1/2 hour.  I sauted them in olive oil.  I used 'Classico' Sweet Basil Pasta Sauce.  I put it on the bottom of the pan, then placed the chicken, then more pasta sauce, cooked them for 15 min.  Next I used italian blend shredded cheese on top and cooked it for the last 5 minutes. I was asked if i went to the famous italian "OLIVE" restaurant to pick up dinner!  I would give it more than 5 stars if i could and it was SOOO EASY! THANKS!

Absolutely excellent.  Instead of sauteing though I baked the chiken for 40 minutes adding cheese for the last 17.  A superb recipe!

All I can say is WOW!  Awesome! My husband who is not a big fan of Italian loved it.  I totally skipped the "frying" step for health reasons and you'd never know it.  I covered the dish for about 35 mins, then removed the foil and let the cheese brown a little.  

I also added pepper and fresh parsley to the bread crumb mixture, and used freshly grated parmesan.  My only complaint is that there was too much coating leftover that I had to throw away.  Next time, I'll adjust the coating amount.

Otherwise, BRAVO!

Not only did this have a nice presentation but it tasted as good as it looked. I scaled it down to four servings and used a combination of colby/jack and mozzarella. Like other reviewers, I fried some garlic in the olive oil before adding the chicken and seasoned the chicken with basil and garlic powder before breading it. I'll definitely be making this again.

overall a hit!  served with pasta, steamed broccoli and garlic bread.  i doubled the sauce and i still had to warm an entire additional regular size jar so there'd be some for the pasta i was serving on the side.  also, i took the advice of another reviewer and double dredged the breasts in the egg and crumbs.  i won't do that again - that was too much breading for my taste. Thanks for the recipe!  I will make again!

Thought the flavor of this was great. The only changes I made were tossing in a little garlic salt with the bread crumbs and parmesan and adding the cheese the last 5 min.

By far best chicken parm ever! My friend gave me her grandmas authentic recipe and this beats it. I used motz instead of monteray jack to keep it traditional.

I am usually not a huge fan of chicken Parmesan, but this recipe has changed my mind. After reading the reviews, and trying both frying the chicken in a pan, and baking, I have come to the conclusion that baking the chicken first, without the sauce, is the easiest way to do it. I also shred my monterey jack cheese, instead of slicing it, and it melts a little more evenly across the top. I use a can of Hunt's garlic and herb spaghetti sauce, and everything turns out wonderful! Even my 5 year old gobbles this up, and she's not a big chicken eater!

As written, I give it a 4, but with a few changes, definitely a 5.  You will need at least a full jar of pasta sauce (24 oz) which is twice what the recipe called for.  I would have preferred a little bit more than that even.  As others have said, you can half the eggs and bread crumb mixture.  Otherwise you will end up having to through the rest away.  I baked the breaded chicken for 20 minutes instead of frying because it was easier and didn't require frying in oil.  Also, I used provolone instead of Monterey Jack cheese...much tastier.  With these changes, it is wonderful and SUPER easy.  It is about the quickest, fancy dish a know how to make.  I've impressed a lot of company with it.

I used mozzarella instead of the Jack cheese, and I made my own quick sauce. Almost as easy as opening a jar and so much better. Adding spices to the bread crumb mix is definitely needed. The cheese needs to melt for a longer period of time then the five minutes that has been suggested, if you want it to be golden brown. I served this with whole wheat spaghetti.

My family really liked this recipe and I liked it because it was so easy to make. Make sure you use a good pasta sauce because that can make or break this recipe. I used a homemade marinara sauce from this site. I also used mozzarella instead of the Monterey Jack and I flattened the chicken to about a half inch.

This chicken parm is great if you DO NOT fry it in the pain first! The chicken totally burned! There needs to be a direction telling you to pound the chicken.

Really, really good!  Such great flavor!  I baked the chicken instead of frying it, so it didn't come out as crunchy as I would have liked.  Will fry next time!

Really have to review after recommending at least 5 times since making it last week.  I did bake it and it came out crispy on the outside, moist on the inside .   (Can be changed up using enchilada sauce and garlic salt in the bread crumbs).  I mean SERIOUSLY GOOD!

Perfect recipe!!  It's our reliable standby for Sunday nights with the Sopranos.  We use the "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" recipe...complements it perfectly.  I'm not a huge fan of canned sauces, and I'll say the homemade sauce perfects this.  Also, I used Mozzerella. cheese; rather than Monterey Jack

If cooked according to the recipe, the chicken coating burns.  No, I didn't have my heat too high, in fact I had it on medium rather than medium-high and my stove does not cook hot.  I did use suggestions such as coating and refrigerating which DID keep the coating on.  I will try this with other recipes now and appreciate this.  I've generally been very happy with recipes rated so high by so many, but this time I just can not agree.  It was OK at best and will not be kept in our recipe box.

Loved this! I used boneless skinless chicken tenders and I loved it so much more than the chicken breast. It makes the portions more reasonable and easier for leftovers. It also absorbed more flavor with the smaller portion of meat. Served over angel hair, and used 1 3/4 cans of marinara sauce to use it up, and I'm glad I did because we still have leftover noodles, but no chicken or sauce left. I also used thick slices of Mozzarella to top it with and sprinkled it all with Parsley to give it more color.

This was absolutely delish!!!!! My husband isn't a fan of most chicken parmesan's, and as soon as he saw what I was making he gave me the, "Eh... don't put my chicken in the red sauce... I don't know about this dear..." Of course I still added all the chicken to the spaghetti sauce! And as soon as he put a bite in his mouth I don't think he made another sound until he was done devouring it! And he LOVED it! I give this a full 5 stars! Here are the changes I made: I used a little bit more oil to fry it in (on accident) and I used EVOO. It gave it an extra crunch, and EVOO is better to use than veg. oil. I also added my cheese the last 5 minutes of cooking that way it didn't get burned.

Delicious!  I prepared 3 chicken breasts with the following changes: First I patted the chicken dry and dredged in a flour/pepper mixture, shook off excess flour, dipped in 1 egg, then in parmesan cheese mixture (1/2 cup parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup Italian bread crumbs, dash of onion powder and garlic powder).  I skipped the frying step and baked instead at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes adding the sauce and mozzarella cheese slice during the last few minutes of cooking.  I also used homemade sauce from the World’s Best Lasagna recipe which beats jar sauce any day.  The result was wonderful chicken that was moist on the inside with a crunchy coating on the outside!

This is a great recipe. We have made it 5 or 6 times in the last 2 months. My family just loves it. There is enough bread crumb mixture to do 9 or 10 chicken breasts. I also use mozzarella cheese instead and it turns out great. We serve this with either fettucine or thin spaghetti and a green salad. YUMMY!

Wow, what a great recipe.  I forgot to saute the chicken breasts before immersing in Prego sauce, so I baked it for 40 minutes instead.  They were thin breasts, and came out perfect.  Everyone said it was the best they've ever had, like restaurant quality.  The chicken melted in our mouths.  Also took one commentator's advice and refrigerated the coated breasts for 30 minutes.  It really held together.  Thanks for sharing.

The fact that this recipe is so incredibly good, yet so fast and easy completely stuns me.  I am never afraid of making complex, time consuming meals and often prefer to, but you simply cannot make better Chicken Parm than this.  The one step I would never leave out is to flatten the chicken breasts.  Like a few other reviewers, I also cook my chicken on the stove-top for less time than the recipe calls for - it is still pink on the inside when I put it into the oven on top of the sauce.  I like for the chicken to finish cooking with the sauce. I probably cook it for about 20 minutes in the oven, then put the cheese on top and cook for another 10 or so minutes just until the cheese is bubbly.  Simply fantastic!

Delicious! To the chicken I added some of my favorite seasonings like some garlic powder, poultry seasoning, black pepper just to satisfy my taste but overall this is a fantastic recipe just how it is. My family loves it and now it's a staple in our menu.

Great recipe. Really no changes except I pounded the chicken thin. I use Monterey Jack if I have it and Mozzarella if I don't. This always gets great reviews from my husband and all three children (and that's unusual to get all three). Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is outstanding! To be honest, I thought it was going to be bland based on the small number of ingredients and the simple steps. It turned out to be the best chicken parm I've ever had (and it was even better for lunch the next day)! I used mozzerella cheese over the top because that was all I had, but other than that, no changes.

This was pretty good. I followed the advice of several other reviewers and allowed time to let the breading "set" by sticking it in the fridge for about 15-20 minutes before sauteeing the chicken. Instead of Monterey Jack, I used mozzarella-provolone cheese. I only had a three-cheese bread crumb on hand, so I added some oregano and garlic powder to that, but not enough. I think if I used seasoned bread crumbs, this dish would have had a little more of the "oomph" that would bring it to a 5-star level. Overall, this was extremely easy and looked and tasted good, so it'll be something I definitely make again.

This was excellent and so easy! I used chicken tenderloins instead of a chicken breast halves, used mozzarella instead of monterey jack, and sprinkled a little bit of dried parsley flakes on top before baking. I will definitely be making this again soon!

This is a great Chicken Parmesan recipe. I took the suggestions of other reviewers, and flattened my chicken first and added onion and garlic powder to the breading. My hubby and children loved it. Thanks for sharing!

this was excellent.  my husband and i both loved it.  it would be better to either flatten the chicken a bit, or sautee it a lot lower heat just to brown the coating and then bake a little longer.  we used pepper jack instead of monterey jack and loved the little kick.  will definitely make again soon.

My family loves when I make this for dinner. I kinda wing the ingredients, plus I add in some garlic powder, italian seasoning & black pepper. I also use tenderloin pieces, they cook faster. Very good recipe.

This dish was scrumptious!!  A new family favorite!!  I pounded the chicken so that the pieces were a half and inch thick and then coated with flour, the egg (with a tsp. of garlic and pepper added), and the bread crumbs (added a half tsp. of onion powder and garlic powder), then set in the fridge for 30 min.  I coated a cookie sheet with pam and baked for 20 min. at 350, then I added the chicken to the casserole dish with sauce (and fresh basil to taste) and baked for 20 min. mpre adding mozzerella chesse for the last five min.  FABULOUS!!  I served with angel hair, ceasar salad and garlic bread.  Will make again and again:)  ENJOY

We loved this!  So simple to make and so very tasty!  I used a ratio of about 1:2 Parmesan:Crumbs and homemade sauce.  Topped with Mozzarella since that's what I had on hand.  I really think this is one of those recipes that will easily lend itself to creative or last-minute, use-what's-in-the-pantry substitutions and alterations (cracker crumbs, jarred sauces/soups, various cheeses).  I would recommend at least slightly flattening your chicken breasts so that they are a more uniform thickness.  They cook so much more evenly that way.  I just place between sheets of plastic wrap and use my heavy marble rolling pin to pound and roll it a bit.  Thank you for a wonderful, super easy recipe! :-)

This was very good and we loved it.  The only comment I will make is that the 1 cup of parmesan cheese plus the 7 oz of bread crumbs was way too much for the amount of chicken breasts.  I had alot of the breading mixture that I had to throw away.  Other than that, excellent!

Very delicious. Worth the work. I would recommend even putting some tomato sauce on top of the chicken to add some extra flavor. Everybody in my family liked it.

I used this as a guideline and it was delicious. I used half Romano and half Parmesan cheese, browned the chicken and then put my homemade meat sauce on the bottom of the pan, topped with the chicken and mozzarella cheese slices. Baked for 30 minutes with foil on top. The kids and family absolutely loved it, had a sidedish of spagetti with meat sauce. So moist and juicy.

My plus one absolutely loved this and he is very picky. I made only 3 breasts since it's only the 2 of us.  Here are the few changes I made after reading reviews.  1) used Parmesan herb panko bread crumbs and added some dried Basil, Oregano, Parsley and about a 1/4 C of Parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs 2) used mozzarella slices instead of Monterrey jack. 3) refrigerated the breasts after coating them for at least 30 min (I read this helps to prevent the coating from falling off  4) Fried in olive oil in non-stick pan for 4-5 minutes per side 4) placed in greased pie plate for 15 min by themselves then covered them with sauce and baking for another 10 minutes before adding cheese for the last 5 minutes (so a total of 30 min in oven).  The next time I make it, I will incorporate fresh garlic.

This recipe did not work for me. Me and my brother made this for mother's day and did exactly as the recipe said. After about 10 seconds (I'm not exaggerating) of the chicken sitting in the oil, there was smoke filling the entire kitchen and the chicken was burnt to a crisp on the outside and completely raw in the inside. We had to completely redo everything at a much lower temperature and at a much shorter time. Even then it really wasn't very good. I would never even think about using this recipe again.

Medium high heat is a bad plan.  had to throw away batch one. the second batch came out pretty good after I pounded down the chicken before coating.

Tasted better than Olive Garden. My kids begged me to make it again. I used Panko bread crumbs. My chicken breasts were a little thick, so I sliced them in half lengthwise. I also used Classico Fire Roasted Tomato and Garlic Spaghetti Sauce. I lined the pan with that new Reynolds foil that has parchment paper on one side. PERFECT!!!

HOLY  is this good! I admit to adding a healthy dose of garlic powder, onion powder and italian seasoning to the bread crumb/parm mixture as suggested by others and it is heaven on a plate! This is my new chicken parm recipe. SO easy and SOOOOOOOO YUM!

This has been the best recipe I have found for chicken parm except I use mozz chesse. I also added my own minced garlic. I pounded the chicken thin first.  I did not put sauce on top of the chicken to bake as we like out chicken with hard crust on it. I added sauce just before I put the cheese on at the end of baking. Next I will add even more garlic, technic is good now just need to adjust taste.

My daughter says "It was the most fantastic dinner I've ever had for my birthday." I only used one egg and put only part of the bread crumb mixture in a a bag to coat the chicken and had some of it left for a quick lunch another day.
Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe.

Really delicious and easy. I added parmesan cheese and oregano to the bread crumbs. I topped the fried chicken with a three cheese blend of roman, parmesan, and colby. Served with garlic mashed potatoes and green bean casserole.

This is a good tasting recipe. As written, this makes too much greasing; so, next time, I will halve the amount (along with the egg). It will (did) burn if you fry the chicken for the directed time. I used shredded mozzarella, because that is what I had on hand. My 3 year old, who doesn't eat or like a lot of chicken, ate and seemed to like it! Will make again with mentioned modifications.

This was great but we used mozzarella on top. Even stuffed one of the breasts with artichoke filling we had left over from the stuffed mushrooms (recipe on this site). A keeper.

This was excellent!! My husband loved it, and thought it was better than any he has had at the restaurants. I used sliced Mozzarella instead of Monterey Jack to top the chicken. I also added a can of italian diced tomatoes to the sauce. I used sweet basil sauce. YUMMMM! I will definetly be making this again!

4 stars because I used the most amazing homemade marinara sauce, and it makes everything taste fantastic.  (See "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" by Jackie)  Honestly the pasta sauce you use will make or break any Italian dish so use the best you can!  I pounded the chicken breasts out to 1/2"-3/4" before sauteing so that they cooked evenly and much quicker.  I also cut the breasts in half so that the pieces were smaller which was enough for the girls and the guys just took more.  The whole family (and the teenaged boyfriends of my daughters) loved it.  Use the sauce recipe I referenced!!!!!  It's a staple.  I don't use anything else.

LOVE IT!! It was simple to follow even though it was my first time trying to make this dish.  I took some of the other suggestions and I put my own variety of seasonings with the Parm. cheese and bread crumbs.  I usually use some Italian seasoning, Adobo, salt, pepper, and garlic salt.  I bake the breasts about 20-25 min, and when they are done, I then put mozzarella cheese on top and melt it.  Chicken turns out moist and delicious!!

Outstanding and oh so easy. Will be in our top favorites for a long time. I went very easy on the oil and used breast tenders. Add sliced mushrooms. Used Cabernet pasta sauce. Great as leftovers too!

I used five chicken breasts that I had butterflied--I was feeding a crowd and was easier than pounding flat.  I had to use more oil than was called for because I had more surface area to cook!  Added garlic and onion powder to the egg wash and to the bread crumbs--that's what I was taught to do.  Used sliced provolone instead of mozzarella simply because that's what the grocery store had.  It was perfect.  Next time I might try baking the breasts in the oven instead of frying first, more of a set and forget then a constant watch.  The leftovers were excellent cold the next day! Thanks!

Turned out great!  Tasty and very filling chicken parm for 4 adults and 2 small children.  I didn't pound the breasts out to even thickness (this time), but I definitely will next time.  This was a snap!  Thank you!

I tried this recipe out tonight for the first time ever and it was AWESOME!  Everyone raved and cleaned their plates.  I used thin chicken breasts so I ended up cooking for less time but other than that, I followed the recipe pretty closely (I don't really measure anything).  Next time, I'll make sure to have a canister of parm on hand instead of the shredded... the powdery stuff mixes much better with the bread crumbs.  It still turned out fabulous!  This one will go in the rotation.

love it love it love it. I can't believe chicken parmesan can taste so good at home. This recipe is amazing! and oh so simple. The only thing I did differently was to use grated romano cheese instead of parmesan (that was all I had on hand) and it was fantastic. I can't wait to make again with parmesan.

This is so good! I served it with linguine noodles, so to make sure I had enough sauce, I used 3 15 oz. containers of Buitoni Marinara sauce (sold in the section of the grocery store where fresh pasta is sold), 1 14.5 oz. can diced tomatoes, and 1 26 oz. can Hunt's garlic and herb spaghetti sauce. I added 2 cloves of minced garlic and a dash of garlic salt to the sauce. (I like salt, though.)   I browned the chicken with 3 tbsp. butter instead of oil, (personal preference) for about 5 minutes on each side on medium heat, until the cheese/bread crumb coating was crispy and slightly browned. I put about 2 cups of sauce in a casserole pan, and topped with the browned chicken breasts & baked (without the cheese topping) for 30 minutes at 375 (since my chicken breasts were thick).  I mixed the remaining sauce with the cooked linguine noodles and about 1 cup of shredded parmesan cheese and put it all into a separate casserole dish, and topped with shredded mozzarella cheese.  After the chicken had baked for 30 minutes, I added a scoop of grated mozzarella cheese (didn't measure, just grabbed it out of the bag) to the top of each chicken breast, and put it back into the oven, along with the pan of mozzarella layered linguine noodles, and baked both for 15 minutes to melt the cheese.  I thought this was divine, and my son, his girlfriend, and my boyfriend all loved it.

This was delicious! I used mozzarella cheese instead of monterey jack. Instead of baking the cheese for the full 20 minutes, I baked the chicken and sauce for 15 minutes, then added the cheese for the last 5. Served over spaghetti with green beans, carrots and garlic bread. Definitely a keeper!

I have made this dish twice now, both times scaling it down to 3 servings. My husband asked me to make it for a work partner of his who was joining us for dinner.  Big hit!  I tenderized the chicken, sautéed it about 4min each side and used mozzarella cheese to top. Thanks for the recipe.

This is super easy and very tasty! My husband requests it regularly. I use mozzerella cheese instead of monteray jack (personal preference), and I add in some garlic powder and dried basil to the breading.

Fantastic recipe! However, I baked the chicken in the oven instead of on the stove. I added the cheese/bread crumb mixture to the chicken and baked in the 350 degree over for approximately 10-15 minutes. Then I topped the chicken with the pasta sauce and baked for another 10-15 minutes. I added the cheese on the top of the sauce and baked for another 5 minutes. The chicken came out tender and juicy....yum!

So, I made this for my 3 year old and boyfriend.  My daughter asked for second and my boyfriend told me that he thinks he loves me more now!  It took me a little longer to cook than 30 minutes (more like 45), but it was so worth it.  I took everyone's advce and pounded the chicken first.  I only used  about half of the bread crumb/cheese mixture and added dried minced onion and dried garlic to the bread crumb mixture.  I used mozzarella cheese in the last 5 minutes of cook time.  There were wonderful!  Next time, I will double the pasta sauce so there will be enough for the noodles.

Best chicken parmeasn I have EVER made. Taste just like the one from Olive Garden! However, it is essential to pound out your chicken before! It makes the world of difference.

Bake the chicken instead of frying to start.  Bake the chicken for 25 with just the breading and then another 20 with the pasta sauce.

Fantastic! I pounded the chicken thin and I also used premade spaghetti sauce and added some dicecd tomatoes. I used panko bread crumbs and added Italian seasoning and parm. cheese to the bread crumbs. Put sauce & tomatoes in bottom of pan placed chicken on top and baked for 20 min. then added mozz. cheese and baked for additional 10 min. (at 400) Served with angel hair pasta and a spincah salad. This would be a great dish to impress company!!

Good recipe for a quick and easy Chicken Parmesan.
I think you need twice the  sauce... (I used Paul Newman's Sockarooni), extra seasonong in the breadcrumbs (such as dried basil, parsley, rosemary and a touch of oregano), and traditionally, Chicken Parm is made with Mozzarella, not Jack cheese. Baking time was right on for breasts that have NOT been pounded. Thank you, Alicia.

This was a great recipe. Easy to fix. I didn't fry the chicken, just breaded it, put it in the baking pan with the sauce making a bed for it, and baked for 20 minutes. Added the cheese (I used mozzerella), and baked 10 minutes more. Delicious! Just because a recipe is easy doesn't mean it's not a good recipe! Everyone loved this dish. I served it with fresh linguini noodles. Nothing fancy. Also made a cooked kale, and onion and apple dish for the vegetable. Will make again and again and again!

This is very good and surprisingly light.  I tend to saute breaded chicken for 3 minutes/side prior to baking the full 20 minutes.  No need to marinate chicken as the tomato/marinara sauce on the bottom of your baking dish acts as a "waterbed" and steams and moistens the chicken.

i haven't tried this recipe but i cook one almost exactly like this one .. it goes like this.. i season the chicken with salt, pepper, and onion powder then i coat it with bread crumbs or crackers.. fry the chicken and then put a layer of tomato sauce in the pan than the chicken heat it for 20 min or until cooked COVER THE CHICKEN WITH MORE TOMATO SAUCE and mozzarella cheese and heated until the cheese is melted... putting tomato sauce over the chicken gives it a great taste
my husband loves this dish and so do I

Yum. The only thing I did different from the recipe was to flatten the chicken first. Very tasty. I liked the jack cheese on it.

This recipe was yummy and I will probably make it again. The only change I made was to use mozzarella cheese instead of Monterey Jack cheese. It had great flavor and was VERY easy to make. In the future I will only cook it on the frying pan for 3 to 4 minutes per side.

I have no idea what happened here, but this didn't turn out well at all for me and I didn't change anything. Usually, DH will gobble up the leftovers, but he didn't even care if I saved this or not. Oh well, thanks anyway!

Absolutely delicious. I'll tell you one thing, I'm no longer going to crave for the chicken parm from this italian restaurant near me. Followed it exactly except for the cooking time since I sliced my chicken breasts in half because they are so thick. Then I put them in a toasted long roll and .. WOW! Definite keeper.

Great recipe.  I have made several times and I recommend Ragu Traditional (24 oz)  for the pasta saunce (the sauce is just perfect for this dish).  I also use mozzerella for the topping.  The extra sauce is great and you can serve with spaghetti noodles.

Definately a keeper, I added granulated garlic and cajun season, as someone else had suggested, to the bread crumbs.  This was really good.

This is totally awesome! We also used chicken tenders instead of chicken breast which made everything cook faster and easier. Otherwise we followed everything as planned. I am definately going to make this recipe again. My hubbie loved it too!

Excellent...will make this again...kid friendly. If you can't find seasoned bread crumbs (which my grocery store was out of), use seasoned stuffing packages...just mash the bread crumbs...works great. Debated about frying the chicken...glad I did...gave it an extra kick.

This chicken parmesan was BETTER than restaurant quality! I added garlic and basil after the egg but before breading and refrigerated for about an hour before cooking so that it would "stay." I used mozarella cheese and baked until it was melted...soooo moist! Thanks for the great recipe.

Wow! This recipe was great! I browned the chicken breasts like directed but instead of dipping it in egg first i just coated it with the breadcrumbs and parmsean cheese. i used two jars of prego sauce and put the chicken breasts on top of it and instead of monterey cheese i used 2 slices of mozzarella on each breast and cooked it for only 15 minutes. I boiled some noodles off to the side and when it was done i cut up the breasts and mixed the sauce, pasta and chicken together. Absoutely great! It tasted like the chicken parmsean you get at Vinnie's down in Medford, Oregon. I will definitly make this dish again

i was skeptical of the reviewers who said it tasted like "restaurant" chicken parmesan, but it's true.  actually, it's better. i pounded the chicken flat and seasoned it with italian seasonings first before breading, and i substituted mozzarella for the monterey jack slices.

GREAT chicken recipe...just a few things--(1) cut the amt of bread crumbs you use or else you will end up with a lot left over, like me...(2) watch the chicken carefully when you saute it b/c i ended up with chicken that was a little too brown in some places...lucky for me i like it that way though...but overall, it's excellent, especially over some noodles...thanks, alicia! =)

Wow, like MomSavedbyGrace, my husband said this was the best Parmesan chicken he had ever had.  That's saying something, because his mother is a gourmet cook!  I made it exactly as written, but with the added step of putting the breaded chicken into the refrigerator for 30 minutes before cooking it in the pan (I heard this tip in the recipe video).  In fact, I think that's what put this dish over the top.  My husband looked at me curiously and said something like "Did you do something different to make the chicken sort of crunchy?"  I've made Parmesan chicken before, but not this one, and he said that was what he liked so much about it.  The kids liked it too, even my picky 11 yo, which is why this recipe will be my go to recipe for Parmesan chicken from now on.  Incidentally, I used Vigo Italian Style Seasoned Bread Crumbs.

Not bad...just make sure the chicken is pretty thin (mine was thick in some places), and don't over-fry.

My daughter and I give it 4 stars. You need way more than 1 tbsp oil to fry 6 chicken breast halves. I had 3 large chicken breast halves that I knew to pound thin, first. I'd say the weight would have been equivalent to the 6 mentioned in the recipe, so I am certain 1 tbsp of oil is not enough. I followed directions after seasoning and pounding my CB, except like someone else posted, flour first. I have to say, after the sauce became involved in the baking, I didn't really notice the Parmesan in the crust. However, the chicken came out good and juicy and it was a nice, homecooked meal. Regarding the frying time, I also did 2 minutes on each side at medium-high. All total, I think I used about 4 tbsp of oil. It's a recipe you can go a lot of directions with. I'd like to know how some of the CB in the pictures turned out so light, as mine were on the darker side.

This recipe was a pretty big hit.  I fileted and tenderized the chicken breasts and substituted the Monterey Jack cheese for Sargento 4 Cheese Italian Blend.  This recipe took me from Zero to Hero in 45 minutes!!

This recipe's super easy & tastes out of this world. I added a few ingredients but that's it. My husband raved over it. It beats any restaurant chicken parmesan I've ever had.

This is how I always make mine. If the chicken is done while in the skillet and I bake it for another 20 minutes, it's going to be dry and tough. It's much easier to simply top it with cheese while in the skillet and cover with a lid so it melts. Heated the pasta sauce (what I use) in a small pan and pour it over the chicken and pasta when hot.

These were very savory.  I had dipped the chicken in breadcrumb mixture then the egg then the breadcrumb mixture again until the egg on the chicken can no longer be absorbed my more breadcrumbs.  I did this because I wanted my crust thick and there was an abundance of the parmesan/crumb mixture.  Thanks for sharing your formula.

Absolutely delicious! Used chicken tenders. Halved the egg, crumb mixtures & added garlic powder & onion powder as suggested by other reviewers. Served over whole grain pasta.  This is going in my family recipe book... A keeper.

OK... so on a busy weeknight chicken Parmesan sounded really good. I picked up some whole wheat thin spaghetti, a jar of sauce, and a pound of fresh boneless skinless chicken tenders. Then I began looking for a recipe....and decided to use this recipe, with changes based on my schedule and ingredients.  So I used 1 egg to dip the chicken tenders in, and mixed bread crumbs with garlic powder, Parmesan cheese, and onion powder. I then dipped each tender in egg then in bread crumb mixture and placed in a sprayed 9x13 pan (I sprinkled the remaining bread crumbs over the tenders). Once all were breaded I covered with saran wrap and placed in the fridge while my daughter had basketball, then about 1.5 hrs later I put it uncovered in the oven on 350, started my pasta water boiling in a pan, and dumped sauce into a separate pan to heat up. Once the water was boiling I up the oven temp to 425 and kept it there until the noodles and sauce were ready (approx 5 min). Then I plated noodles topped with sauce topped with a couple chicken tenders, topped with more sauce and finished off with shredded mozzarella cheese. Also had a fresh salad.....it was amazing my 2yr, 5yr, and 10yr LOVED it! I will definitely be making it again soon.

This chicken was fabulous!  I have made chicken parm for years and always fussed about the sauce.  I followed this recipe, using jarred sauce only, and it was terrific.  The chicken was perfectly moist and the sauce was flavored a bit by the parm in the breading.  Only thing I did different was to use shredded mozzarella in place of the Monterey Jack.  Perfect!  Thank you!

We try not to use oil in cooking so we baked the chicken in the crumb mix. We thought this was very tasty but we spoilt it by using the Rago Basil pasta sauce which was just too overpowering.  We will definately do it again but with a plain tomato sauce.  Thanks for sharing

This is the first time I've made chicken parm at home. It was so easy and delicious. I only had a shredded colby jack cheese blend on hand so that's what I went with. I got rave reviews and it was rated a keeper.

Tastes great and really easy to put together. I used one whole jar of sauce (24oz) and I also used fresh mozzerella on top instead of the jack. Tasted fab. Next time I would like to use the italian bread crums to give it a bit more flavor.

So simple, so delicious!  I pounded the chicken really thin and add some italian seasoning to the flour/bread crumb mix.  Also, I think you only need about half the amount of parm and bread crumbs listed, or else you will be throwing a lot away.  Thanks for sharing!

very good.   I didn't cook the chicken 8-10 min per side because the crust was getting too brown.  So, I'm sure it wasn't cooked all the way through at that point, but by the end of 20 minutes in the oven, it was.

This is our favorite chicken parmesean recipe! I followed EXACTLY as written. I didn't feel the need to pound the chicken, since i'm baking them in the oven, not trying to cook them thoroughly on the stove. I make this in the morning and then just pop it in the oven for 30 minutes in the evening.

One of my favorites and a go-to for taking supper to someone.  My tip:  After we have pretzels, chips, crackers, etc. that go stale, we throw them all into the food processor and grind them into crumbs.  I keep them in the freezer, then use 2 handfuls of these "breadcrumbs" to 1 handful of parmesan cheese plus 1 palmful of both dried oregano and basil for my seasoned bread crumb mixture.   That, and I make sure to use a cheesy pasta sauce (often Wegmans' four-cheese pasta sauce).  Ho.  Lee.  Cow:  SO good!

This recipe was just OKAY for me. I followed the recipe exactly the way is it stated and had alot of trouble keeping the breading on the chicken while it was frying. It turned pretty messy so I had to take the chicken out of the frying pan and finish cooking it in the oven, after cooking in the oven I added the sauce and cheese. It turned out pretty soggy, overall this could have been a really good recipe, I think I am going to give it one more try and see how it goes. Overall it has alot of potential.

OMG!!! I made this today and my husband said this was the absolute best chicken Parm he has ever had! He ate 2 helpings and is now asleep! I only altered slightly, I used mozzarella slices and also placed sauce on top of chicken instead of the bottom and put the cheese on top of that! Came out perfect!!!

Fabulous family dinner.  I use about 1 1/2 lbs of chicken breast, pounded flat and cut into 6 portions, half the amount of parm/crumb mixture, and 1 egg thinned with a little milk.  Easy to bread and even fry ahead of time, refrigerate, then finish in the oven.  Great for casual company!

I'm not sure what happened, but when I was frying the chicken all the breading came off. It was still good, but I think next time I will just stick with baking in the oven. I used mozzarella cheese instead of jack due to personal preference.  Served over angel hair pasta.

Definitely a keeper. I pounded the breasts first, and it took much less time to brown than the time recommended - more like a couple of minutes on each side at most. I only made half the recipe, so instead of opening a whole jar of pasta sauce I made my own with an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce and italian spices, garlic, s&p. Added a handful of shredded italian cheese blend during last 5 minutes of baking. Perfect!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Although edible, this was nothing special to me or my family.  A bit bland.  Not understanding the out-of-this-world ratings.

I wanted to try making chicken parmesan for the first time so I headed here to find a good recipe.  This one was great!  I followed some of the comments and made a few alterations.  I breaded chicken tenders with  Italian style bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, and salt & pepper.  Popping them in the fridge for 30 minutes prior to cooking worked like a charm to keep the breading on.  I baked the chicken on a cookie sheet sprayed with some olive oil (10 minutes each side).  Then I put marinara sauce at the bottom of a baking dish, the chicken and more sauce.  Baked for 20 minutes, added shredded mozzarella and baked for 5 more minutes.  Served over angel hair pasta.    The only thing I'd say is that it needed a bit more of a kick.  I'm not sure if it needed more salt or another spice.  I think that problem would be fixed if I made my own sauce instead of using jarred.  I'm going to keep playing with this to suit my taste but overall, it's a great basic recipe.

Very good and very easy. I thook the advise of other reviewers and used 2 eggs, but only half of the breadcrumb/parmesean mixture. There was more than enough to cover the chicken breasts. Also, I flattened the breasts using a meat tenderizer. Instead of cooking the chicken in a pan with oil, I cooked them on a greased cookie sheet for 20 min at 350. Then added them to the pasta sauce for 20 minutes at 375. Added mozzarella slices for the last 5 min.

BLAND, BLAND, BLAND.  I was extremely disappointed by this recipe.  I did EXACTLY what the recipe called for and even added the onion powder and garlic powder like others had suggested ... and it STILL came out bland.

This dish was awesome!  My Dh loved it!  I mixed seasoning salt, pepper and garlic powder in with the parmesan cheese and I used Italian Panko bread crumbs.  Once I coated the chicken, I baked in the oven for 20 mins and then placed some sauce over the top and continued to cook for another 20 mins.  I added the Monterey Jack cheese and left in the oven until the cheese melted.  I served this with thin spaghetti and additionel pasta sauce on the side for the spaghetti.  Will definitely make again.  The chicken was sooo tasty and juicy....YUM!

I've now made this recipe on several occasions and it certainly doesn't disappoint. It's quick, simple and very very tasty. Also apparently perfect for those last minute dinner guests. I served with multigrain penne (tossed with garlic, olive oil and chopped fresh parsley) and zucchini. My 5 year old is also a big fan.

Very good recipe. I followed other reviews, cutting the egg and bread crumbs in half. We didn't bake the dish at the end, using the same pan the chicken was fried in and simmering on top of the stove with a lid. This saved another dish to wash. Will definitely do again.

This is an easy and delicious Chicken Parm recipe! I cut the recipe in half and pounded out the chicken breast halves to ½ inch.  I also used a combination of mozzarella and provolone cheese rather than the monterey jack- A trick I use for getting the cheese perfect and bubbly is turning the broiler on with about 2 minutes cooking time left- the cheese gets perfectly golden and bubbly!  I served with whole wheat pasta and a salad of mixed greens with balsamic vinaigrette.  My hubby frequently requests this recipe and the leftovers never last very long in our house!

Very good and easy. I also used only 1 egg and added some Parmesan cheese and black pepper to my italian bread crumbs. As another reviewer suggested, I poured the pasta sauce on top of the chicken too and Italian shredded cheese for the last five minutes of cooking time. Paired it with angel hair pasta and salad. Yum!

This recipe was pretty good, except I couldn't get the bread crumbs to stick to the egg-coated chicken. The baking time suggested was a bit long for me as well. My chicken could probably have been baked for just 15 min (instead of 20) & kept the cheese thicker. Still, not a bad recipe at all!

A very yummy recipe! Even my husband who usually doesn't like Chicken Parmesan said he loved it. I used panko instead of breadcrumbs, and added oregano, pepper and garlic salt to it. I also used moz. cheese. So moist and delicious.

Excellent!  I added the cheese five minutes before it was done, and it has turned out perfectly every time.  It is the moistest chicken I have ever had.

I can't rave about this recipe the way others did -- it wasn't bad, but it wasn't fantastic either. Not bad for a weeknight dinner, but would never serve for company. I seasoned the bread crumbs with garlic and onion powder. Pounded the chicken down to what I thought should have been plenty thin, but should have pounded it down even more. The cook time in the skillet just wasn't enough to turn pink to white in the center before the breading started to get overdone and the pan started to become a crusty mess. The 20 minute oven/baking time was not too much in my book, plus, it ensures the chicken is done through. One egg was sufficient for coating three chicken breasts; could have done another one or two pieces with that one egg. Too much bread crumb mixture went in the trash. In the end, this recipe ended my search for a Thursday night dinner recipe, but it did not end my quest for a great chicken parmesan recipe.

Delicious recipe, Alicia!  I followed your recipe pretty closely, except at the end when I poured marinara sauce over the chicken and cheese slices.  I would suggest using the whole jar of sauce since my husband wanted to mix the extra sauce with the fettucini that I also served.  I only baked four chicken breasts, so I had plenty of sauce left over.  Great served with steamed broccoli.  This is a keeper!

Very good recipe, tastes like a restaurant. I needed to cook my chicken a little longer than stated but it may have been becuase they were larger breasts. I would recommend this to anyone.

I have never been a fan of chicken parmesan, but this is so yummy!!! A few things though; cut the coating in half or you will have A LOT left over, and use thinly sliced chicken breasts instead of the really thick ones because the thick ones take too long to fry and end up burning before they are cooked through. It seems like most people used mozzarella instead of monterey jack, but I thought the monterey jack was great! All in all, its frickin' delicious and not hard at all!

Nearly burnt (took it off heat before recipe says to) breading that fell off the chicken and ended up a globby mess.  Even so would have give 3 stars but there was not flavor.

Yummmm I made this on a week night and it was simple and quick!! Tastes like it took hours. I did bake it a bit longer because I cut back on the saute time I went about 5 minutes per side as I didn't want the cheese to burn. I baked it for 40 minutes and then let it rest for 10 additional minutes while I prepared angel hair pasta and heated some marinara sauce to top it with. It was perfect!!!

This is a wonderful dish!  I did marinate the chicken for a couple of hours in a Italian flavored marinade.  The only things I'll change next time is make about 1/3 less of the bread crumb mix.  I will also add about double the amount of the red sauce.  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

i made it a little easier by keeping it in one pan - after the chicken had cooked, i just added a jar of marinara directly to the pan (paul newman's tomato and garlic), heated through about 15-20 min, and added mozzarella to the chicken until melted. served over thin spaghetti - not an overly interesting meal, but definitly satisfying and easy.

I've made this recipe 3X at least and keep getting rave reviews!  The last time I made it, I topped the fried chicken with sliced fresh mozarella.  Yum!  Add wheat germ to the breading mix for some extra nutrition.  I'm crazy about wheat germ.  :)  One time I made my own sauce and added, among other things, cayenne pepper to give it zing but not burn your lips off. Yummy! Will make this one over and over!

Hands down, the best homemade Chicken Parm I've ever had.  I did everything MomSavedbyGrace said to do in altering the recipe.  I think refrigerating for 30 mins after the breading is on to make it stick was definitely key as well.  I use Emeril kicked up tomato sauce and its fantastic.

I make this recipe all of the time.  The only change I made was to pound the chicken breasts to a uniform thickness.  I also use mozzarella cheese most of the time.  This is so good and easy to make.  People have told me that it is as good as you can buy in any restaurant.

WOW! WOW! WOW!  This was the BEST chicken parm EVER!  Very moist and delicious.  I did coat mine in seasoned flour before coating with the egg and bread crumbs, and I used Italian seasoned bred crumbs.  Also, adding the cheese the last 5 minutes was a great suggestion.

This recipe is delicious!  The only change I made was to dip the chicken breasts into flour, then the egg and coating.  It seemed to help the crumbs stick better. Thanks for the great recipe.

Very easy recipe, and tastes great!
You can also skip the breading and make in a skillet ontop of the stove. Serve over pasta with side of fresh veggies!

This was really delicious.  Smells wonderful as it is baking. I butterflied my chicken breasts and cut them in two. Then I pounded them as thinly as I could. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and first coated chicken in seasoned flour, then dunked in egg substitute (no cholesterol), then in the  seasoned breadcrumb/parmesan cheese mixture.  I also let them sit in the frig for about 20 minutes to let coating seal. I debated about whether to saute or not but then sauteed in non stick skillet with a little olive oil and melted Smart Balance.  They turned a beautiful golden and since they were so thin didn't take long-maybe 4 minutes total.  I placed on top of red spaghetti sauce and baked covered for about 35 minutes. Then I added shredded fat free mozarella and baked uncovered another 10 minutes until cheese melted. Very good and left overs great the next day!

I found the chicken to bland. I double dipped the chicken in seasoned panko bread crumbs and as others suggested, refrigerated for 30 minutes. No problem with breading sticking.  I plan to try again, but will brine the breast meat first.

This recipe was very tasty. My husband went back for seconds and so did my daughter. The meat was very tender, although I did skip the saute step...only because I don't have a very good non-stick skillet. To make up for skipping the step, I baked it for 40 min. PERFECT!

We thought this was delicious when you add the appropriate spices: garlic, basil, oregano.  Also, I cooked some spaghetti (didn't have fettuccine) and more sauce to put the chicken on top.  It was great!  I will definitely make again.

This is one of the easiest chicken recipes ever, but it tastes like you really fussed.  I pounded my chicken flat like other reviewers suggested and I only had to brown the chicken about 5 minutes on each side.  I used "Newman's Own" pasta sauce and provolone cheese.  My husband told me that this one is a keeper!

This is an awesome recipe. It's been a huge hit everytime I make it. I have a slight variation in the preparation - I first pound the chicken breasts w/ a meat tenderizer ... it does wonders and makes the chicken so tender. This chicken dish served with a side of pasta is absolutely incredible!

I used this new Prego sauce called "Roasted Chicken", instead of plain tomato sauce.

Truly one of the best new dishes I have made in a while.  My family was thrilled and wanted to know when I would be making this again! I did make use mozzeralla instead and didn't add the sause till the chicken was out of the oven for a crispier taste.

My husband raved about this recipe.  I added some italian seasonings and garlic to the tomato sauce and used shredded mozzerella rather than monterey jack cheese and it turned out great.  I served it with a size of spiral pasta and there was enough sauce to cover the pasta.  I am going to make it again tonite.

This recipe was all right.  I found it a little mushy and lacking flavor. Next time I am going to mix more spices in the bread crumbs or cook the chicken separate from the sauce to get it crispy then melt cheese on the top and place it in the sauce.

Refrigerated coated chicken for 30 minutes. Removed from fridge and baked on cookie sheet for 20 minutes before putting everything together in a baking dish.  Put a layer of sauce (fresh spinach marinara) on bottom of baking dish, placed baked chicken on top, and poured remaining sauce on top of chicken and baked for another ~20 minutes or until the sauce was bubbling.  Added slices of garlic & herb cheese for the last 5 minutes. Served over angle hair pasta. Delicious!

Loved it!  I cut down browning time to what others had posted (5-6 mins per side) and the Monteray Jack worked out great baked in oven.  Big success - will be making again :) Recipe is "a keeper"

The Best! My family LOVED it, but I did make a few changes. I was all set to make it & realized I I was out of bread crumbs so I used dry potato flakes seasoned with Italian seasoning, garlic, & a bit of Morton's Nature's Seasons (I use that in almost everything). I also pounded the breasts before breading them & used mozzarella cheese instead of Monterey Jack. It was so super good! My entire family said it was the best I have ever made so this will be the recipe I use from now on!

Chicken parm is one of my all time favorite pasta dishes. This is a super easy recipe to follow. I tenderize my chicken breasts to make them a bit thinner, used mozzarella (what I had on hand in place of parm), and Newman's Own Fire Roasted Tomato & Garlic Sauce...everything turned out amazing!

I tried this recipe tonight. As others, I baked rather than frying. I baked for 20 minutes on a rack on a cookie sheet then I added sauceto the bottom of a pan, added breasts, added more sauce on top and some parm. Baked 20 more minutes then added Italian blend cheese and baked 10 more minutes. I had 3 breasts pounded thin and seasoned those prior to breading with S&P, garlic powder and no salt added Italian seasoning. I only used 1 large egg with a little water added and I double breaded with seasoned bread crumbs. I made the sauce with home canned tomatoes, paste and seasonings. Served with a salad and garlic cheese bread. Very tasty and thanks for the recipe!

Delicious and very easy to make.  The only change I made was using provolone instead of monterrey jack cheese.

This is an above average recipe..BUT it is NOT the best Parmesan chicken ever! My expectations were so high after reading the reviews that I was a little disappointed when I ate it (my boyfriend loved it) I did do several changes as mentioned from other reviewers.. 1.I pounded the chicken til it was thin and added onion and garlic powder to the breading. I also used one egg and halved the breading ingredients ( it made just the right amount for 4 chicken breasts) 2.Put in refrigerator for 30 min. So breading would stick 3. Fried the chicken on med. for 3-5min. 4. Last 5 min. I added provolone and mozzarella cheese. I served on spaghetti noodles and a side of garlic mushrooms.. I will make this again cause it is fast, easy and very good..BUT you cannot compare it to a REAL family Italian Restaurant..

Once you fix the recipe, it's 5 stars, but I can't give this recipe as written 5 stars because I think you should cook the chicken on on medium. Other than that, these are amazing =).

made this with a friend recently & everyone LOVED it! Adding the parmasean directly to the chicken breading was delicious, plus I added extra finely sliced garlic & lots of fresh basil to the pasta sauce. We couldn't stop eating it! This will definitely become a staple recipe for cold nights! So comforting.

This is soooooooo good.  I used shredded colby jack cheese instead of the monterey jack cheese.  Only baked the chicken until the cheese was melted.  Was a huge hit, so easy to make.  Definitely making this again.

This is very much like the chicken parm recipe I have used for years and my whole family loves it. I make it with fresh chicken whenever possible. But if I'm really tight on time I make it with Foster Farms frozen chicken breast patties. Pour some sauce in the bottom of the pan, arrange frozen chicken on top of the sauce, pour on a little more sauce, cover with cheese (I use shredded mozzarella and little bit of parmasean) and pop it in the oven. Not as good as the real thing but kids still like it.

Very good! It was the best chicken parm I've made. I adjusted by lowering the cooking temp on the stovetop and nuked it in the microwave until it was mostly cooked so the outside breading wouldn't burn. I then baked according to directions and it was so moist and yummy. I'd give it a five stars, except I think following the directions exactly you'd burn the breading and then maybe dry out the chicken. I think with those changes it's a 5 star!

Pretty good! While I don't agree that this is the BEST chicken Parm I've ever had (my mom's recipe is MUCH better), it made for a decent meal nonetheless. Having said this, I think this would make a fantastic sandwich. I had a PHENOMENOL chicken Parmesan sandwich at Cooper's Hawk, a restaurant / winery local to the Midwest and Chicagoland area. It was layered with thinly pounded (breaded) chicken, marinara & Provolone. House made giardiniera & pesto mayo were the crowning touches that took it over the top, IMHO. Vero's chicken Parm tasted EXACTLY like Cooper's (totally SPOT on!), so maybe that's why the sandwich idea appeals to me... :) As with any new recipe, I improvised to suit my (and my husband's) tastes. Instead of pounding out chicken breasts (many reviewers suggested this step to ensure even cooking), I purchased thinly sliced chicken cutlets. I also halved this since I was only feeding two people. The last change I made was to refrigerate my breaded chicken for a half hour PRIOR TO frying it (this helped the breading adhere and worked like a charm). NOTE: While it is VERY important to brown your chicken well, the suggested 8-10 minute per side timeframe is WAAAY off (especially on medium-high heat). Watch closely, but I'll bet your chicken will be PLENTY done (and crisp brown) after 8-10 minutes - TOTAL. Served with penne tossed with Alfredo sauce, parmesan crusted carrots (becky1618) and garlic bread. Thanks for sharing your idea, vero! :-)

Perfect. I used Chicken Tenderloins, our choice.
The great thing about this recipe, is the addition of  grated cheese to breadcrumbs. I Used  mozzarella cheese,
which I had on hand/sauce and angel hair pasta.
Perfecto....... Thank You for Sharing
I have now added fresh basil to the breadcrumb mixture  and
What a difference.... An entirely new taste ....

delicious recipe. cooked chicken in oil on stove top first. unfortunately i burned the first breast (im a cooking newb), had better luck with the 2nd and 3rd breast. then baked the chicken (without the sauce) for 15 minutes, THEN added the sauce and cheese. cooked for another 10 minutes. boiled some riggatoni in this 10 minute window. added a few asaparagus spears and a large portion of leafy green salad (with light basalmic vinegar dressing) and sunday dinner was served. 

next time: make homemade pasta sauce. kthk!

So easy and so good! Some of my chicken wasn't completely cook all the way through, so I put them in the casserole dish poured the whole jar of sauce on it (bertolli's tomato and basil), cooked it for 20 mins then I put the cheese slices on top and baked it until the cheese melted. we ate it with angel hair spaghetti and pesto sauce.

Well, the meat fried in the parmesan+Italian breadcrumbs was delicious. For our taste, it would have been better without the tomato sauce.

I used alfredo sauce instead of spaghetti sauce and my family loved it. My husband asked if it was Roquefort chicken and my daughter said it was her favorite chicken. I didn't serve it with pasta either.

This is one of my favorite recipes. This is really east to make and is very delicious. I even made Tomato Turkey Parmesan and it was still really good. I would recommend this for anyone who wants a good dish and not spend a lot of time making it. It's also not necessary to make with the cheeses they suggest. I make it with whichever cheeses I have at home and it always comes out great.

This was sooo good! Next time I will pound the chicken breasts to 1/4in thick like other reviews have suggested. I think that would've made the chicken more juicy. The only slight variation I did was to brown the chicken in olive oil and a pinch of minced garlic. This is definitely in the rotation now!

Yummy yummy yummy!  I always imagined chicken parm being something that would take a lot of time and I would have to go out shopping for ingredients.  I had every single thing in my fridge/cabinets.  

So good!  My boyfriend and I thank you!

Easy & excellent.  I pounded the breasts to help with even cooking.  I put some sliced mushrooms on the chicken, then the monterey jack, then (as another reviewer mentioned) the balance of the jar of pasta sauce.  Moist, tender, lots of flavor.

This has been put on permanent rotation at our house! It's super easy, tastes great and everyone loves it. I use the three cheese tomato sauce from Trader Joe's and that makes it. I used a regular pasta sauce one night when we were out of our normal sauce and it wasn't as good. I think it's better with sauce that isn't bitter or have any sugar added. Sticking the chicken in the fridge for a little bit before cooking makes such a huge difference! Best tip I've gotten in a long time! I serve it over whole wheat egg noodles and always make a little extra for leftovers!

My husband could not stop talking about how delicious this was! Instead of using bread crumbs from the store, I made my own. I just tore some 1 c. of some stale sourdough, 1/4 c. flat leaf parsley, probably 1 tsp. of Italian seasoning and 1/4 c. parm cheese, some salt and pepper and mixed in in my food processor until the crumbs were tiny. This is really what made the recipe. Next time I am going to make my own sauce as well.

This recipe was wonderful! I made a couple of changes though. I marinated my chicken in Lawry's Herb & Garlic marinade for 2 hours before coating them with the breadcrumbs. The breadcrumbs still stuck, and with leaving them in the fridge for about 20 mins prior to cooking I did not have any problems with them falling off. I did not pound my chicken, as suggested, but with cooking them in a bit of oil in a covered skillet at medium heat for 5 minutes and low heat for 5 minutes they all took the same amount of time to cook. I also made up some spaghetti and sauce, put the chicken on top, and then put additional sauce on the chicken. I used shredded four cheese blend for my cheese, and it was amazing! The marinade is what really made the chicken have a great flavor, and I will be making this again!

This is a good, basic recipe for how to make a chicken Parmesan. However, don't use Monterey Jack! The flavor is all wrong for this sort of dish. Substitute Mozzarella and you're good!

Yummy!!! The only thing I would change is probably to halve the breadcrumbs & parmesan in the chicken coating, I threw a lot out. Maybe use the leftover parm to sprinkle over the top.

Given the simplicity of the recipe I didn't expect this to be so good. It was delicious! I used buffalo mozzarella to top, a spicy marinara and served over angel hair.

I followed the recipe. Very bland. As written I didn't care for it. I have had better, but it just needs a little tweeking. Like pounding the chicken, a little more spices, more cheese, and maybe the sauce over the chicken instead of just laying in it. I needed a quick recipe for lasts nights dinner and chose this one, thank you but I will look for others.

I've made this several times -- excellent and very easy.  I make it as written except for one thing - I can't imagine that 12 oz of sauce would be enough; I use nearly double that amount and it's just right.  Sometimes I use chicken tenders and the only adjustment I make is to cook them only 4 to 4 1/2 minutes on each side.

I seasoned the bread crumb/cheese mixture with garlic powder, red pepper flakes and dried basil. I flattened out the chicken breast but might try cutting each breast into 2 thinner servings next time.

This was very good.  My daughter declared that this was her new favorite dinner, and said we should have this again soon.  The only thing I did different was use up some shredded italian cheese that I had on hand.  Other than that I made a stated in recipe.

so good!  i made minor changes: - i used red pepper havarti instead of monterey jack... and i stuffed the chicken breasts with the havarti before dunking them in the egg bath.   - it's also important to sprinkle a little bit of salt on to the chicken breasts before the egg wash, this will help them hold their moisture.   - also, i added some basil to the bread crumbs. with these changes, the recipe came out amazingly good!  the chicken was juicy and tender.  enjoy!  =)

I really liked this - but like most changed it up a little.  I didn't put the sauce in the casserole dish.  Instead I cooked the chicken by itself and then made angel hair pasta on the side, put the cooked chicken on the pasta and then covered everything with the sauce (which I warmed in a saucepan).  I was worried that baking the chicken in the sauce would make it soggy - but nobody says that, so maybe I will try baking it like that next time.

Delicious, I used mozarella cheese instead of Monterey Jack. Next time, I will only use one egg and half of the bread crumbs and cheese mixture...thanks for sharing!

Absolutely delicious.  I used more oil (olive oil) to brown the chicken.  Italian Panko instead of breadcrumbs.  Made it taste so yummy.  Crispy on the outside, tender and juicy inside.  I've made this numerous times and we eat it all up.  I'm not one for breaded food, but the Panko changed all that.  Served with linquini. (May have spelled that wrong)  I have no more left to use as a spelling reference. All the times I've made it, I've used different kinds of cheese on top. From Provolone, Mozz. and Jack cheese.  You have to try this. #1 in my book. Thanks for a great recipe that was excellent and so simple.

This is a good recipe. I recommend reading the other reviews for mor recommendations, you might want to season your meat so it can have some flavor, and watch  it closely when fryingbecause it will get dark fast. I'm looking forward to cooking this meal again.

Fan-freakin'-tastic!  Reduce the egg to 1 and the bread crumbs to half.  Double the sauce.   Used fat free mozzarella and Italian bread crumbs and it was the bomb!

This was excellent!  As suggested by other reviewers I baked the chicken for 20 minutes, added the marinara and baked for an add'l 15 minutes, then added the cheese and baked for the last 5 minutes.  My whole family loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe submission!

Stupid me thought that I had parmesan in the fridge and guess what... I had used it all. SO...lazy me didn't go to the store and just skipped the parmesan. Yep, chicken parmesan WITHOUT the parmesan. A sin. Forgive me. Instead of Monterey I used shredded mozarella. I pounded the chicken thin and added twice as much sauce because we LOVE sauce. Served it with spagetti ... Yum Yum. It turned out pretty awesome. Of course, with parmesan (like it is supposed to be) would be even better. Quick, easy and flavorful = I'm happy.

Very good dish.  I substituted two ingredients -- a can of Italian-recipe diced tomatoes and mozzarella cheese -- since I already had them.  The chicken turned out tender and the combo with tomatoes and cheese was delicious.  This would be a great company meal as it looks very nice too.

Super easy and delicious.  I butterflied the breasts and pounded them really thin.  I used some cornmeal   because I had no breadcrumbs(!!!).  Still it was (to quote my fiancée) "excellent."  Not bad, huh?

This is a great recipe!  I used a fairly standard marinara sauce and wished I had added some fresh garlic to it.  A lot of garlic actually!  The chicken was very moist and flavorful.

This is the best chicken parm I've ever had. I usually don't like chicken parm and I made this for my husband. We both loved it and will definitely make this again. We followed suggestions to mix onion powder and garlic powder with the bread crumbs and parmesan and we used mozarella for the last 5 minutes of baking time.

When we dine out my boyfriend always orders Chicken Parmesan so I decided to try it myself and it was a huge success.  I followed the recipe exactly, served over fresh pasta with garlic bread and it was a big hit.    The only negative: it was really expensive to make.  I used fresh parm ($4) it is much better than the powder stuff and fresh pasta, so some of the expense was by choice.  WELL WORTH IT!

This is my husbands favourite meal that I make. I also use italian seasoned bread crumbs (or add Italian seasoning to the bread crumbs, or some dried oregano and basil, garlic powder) I also used mozzarella instead of Monterey Jack.  And my husband loves double breaded.  Thanks for the recipe. It's a household favourite!

I've never had Chicken Parmesan but it is my husband's favorite. So I tried it. Its good. He likes it. Easy to make. I also made it "light" by using mozzarella and baked the chicken before adding it to the pasta sauce. I also added more spices to the store-bought sauce... Looks like its found a spot on my menu.

These were really flavorful.  My chicken breasts were pretty large so we butterflied them to an even thickness and then put them in the eggwash and breading.  I only cooked them in the frying pan about 3 minutes on each side - just long enough to get them golden brown and crispy.  I then baked them in the oven about 20-25 minutes.  Definitely will make them again.  Next time I think I'll pound them out thinner and use them in a sub roll for a chicken parm sandwich.

The baked version of this recipe was a hit in our house.  I wanted to try something lighter and went with the reviewer's recommendations to bake it the whole way.  I pounded the chicken flat, double coated the chicken (added onion powder, garlic powder, and parsley to the coating), baked it 20 minutes, broiled it to get the coating crunchy, then put sauce on top and underneath and baked it for 10 more minutes.  Added mozzarella and shaved parmesan on top during the last five minutes.  Deeeelicious!

Instead of Monterey Jack cheese, I use Mozza, White Cheddar and Provolone.
It is fabulous!

My husband told me that this was better than Olive Garden!  This is the second time I made this recipe and it was much better than the first time.  I did pound the chicken a little so it'd cook more evenly.  Also, I marinated the chicken in a little oil and McCormick's garlic and herb seasoning.  This gave the chicken added flavor (the first time it just tasted like bland chicken).  It was so easy to make this and we'll definitely make it again!

This is delicious.  I also covered the chicken in tomato sauce.  I only had parmesan cheese so the last 5 minutes I put some of that on the top and let it melt.  mmmm....

This was great... Easy and delicious from first to last BITE !
Didn't have monterey jack on hand but did have shredded mozerella which worked out beautifally. I used Classico Traditional sweet basil sauce for the bottom of the pan. Next time I will also sautee' some mushrooms in Olive Oil and Butter to go with it. Served this entree with a Indian saffron rice which can be found on this site as well.

An absolutely GREAT recipe! I only made a couple changes:  I cut the parmesan/bread crumb mixture in half, and after I finished frying the coated pieces, I popped some fresh sliced mushrooms with some zuchinni and yellow squash that I'd julienned (sp) into the pan with just a smidge of extra olive oil.  Served all with angel hair pasta on the side to make a complete meal.  My family loved it!

This recipe couldn't have been much easier to make and it was very yummy!  I'd give it 5 stars, but I think the breading needs a little flavor tweaking. I did as suggested, and pounded the chicken breasts to an even 1/2" thickness.  I used crushed Pepperidge Farm "Zesty Italian" croutons for the breading and Prego organic tomato & basil sauce. I poured about half of the sauce in the pan before I put the chicken breasts in and then poured the other half over the top. My daughter liked it that way, but next time I think I'll leave half of the breasts uncovered, because I want to see if the breading stays crispier - plus I think the pretty golden color of the chicken breading adds visual appeal. Also, next time I make it, I'm going to jazz up the breading a bit by adding some garlic powder, onion powder and a little more Italian seasoning. Thanks for the recipe!!

This is delish!  I use mozzarella instead of jack, and when I serve it, I dish out a chicken breast per plate, then pour the warmed sauce over fresh pasta noodles for a full meal.  I made this last night and my company went nuts over it.  Frozen Foster Farms chicken breasts always come out super tender and this recipe is a favorite that I have been making for 3 years!

Delicious recipe, with a few tweaks to it!  I only dipped the chicken in an egg and bread crumb mixture, saving the cheese for later.  I put a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of the dish as the recipe says, then added the chicken, THEN I smothered each piece with shredded mozzarella, a healthy layer of sauce, and another layer of shredded parmesan on top.  I have been told this recipe tastes better than restaurant chicken parmesan!!

I wanted a change, so came onto this site looking for meals with chicken.  When I saw that this had recipe had alot of feedback and stars, I had to try it.  Well my family couldn't get enough of it.  My 4yr old son who is so fussy asked for more, he had more again now for lunch.  My daughter first thing this morning asked if she could have it for lunch at school today.  My hubby who is also fussy, especially with coated food like breadcrumbs also was licking his lips asking if I did enough for dinner today. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe. It's definitely a keeper and for sure I will be passing this onto family and friends. Thanks again from a happy wife and mum.

I really liked how this turned out, but when I tried to saute the chicken it just didn't work. I think it might have only been the second time I've ever tried sauteing something, but other than that fact it turned out great!! I made the following changes, as suggested: 1 - Pound the chicken to half-inch thickness. 2 - Cut the breading/parmesan mixture in half and reduce the beaten egg to 1. 3 - Add the cheese slices the last 5-7 minutes of cooking. Also, since when I sauted it most of the breading/parmesan mixture came off, I just sprinkled more on top before it went into the oven. Good stuff!

Make sure the chicken is nice a crispy from the fry pan and only use a little sauce. I serve with a side of sauce so there is the crispy and extra sauce! The Jack cheese makes this chicken parm! LOVE IT

This was wonderful.  The chicken was so tender.  Anyone heard of Tastefully Simple?  I added their Italian Seasoning to the bread crumbs and it gave it a great Italian/garlic flavor.  Every time I've ever made chicken parm I've always used a different recipe (never seem to remember what I used before).  Now I will always use this one!

this is unbelievable.  the chicken was so moist and tender, and the sauce afterwards was delectable.  ummm, heavenly.  the change i made, was to add honey to the bottom of the pan to the tomato sauce.  also, i marinated the chicken with apple juice and honey for 24 hours.  the knife slid right through and the chicken was thoroughly tasty.  2 thumbs up!

The only reason this one lost a star with me is because I had trouble frying the chicken before baking it. I ended up frying it halfway done and then just baking it longer, and it turned out fine, but a little burnt from where I kept it frying too long. It says to fry for 8-10 minutes on BOTH sides, but I could barely keep it on for 2 minutes on each side before it started to burn! Anyone have a solution for this? Otherwise, I loved it, hubby loved it, and I will definitely make again!

My husband loves to have chicken parmesan when we go to our favorite Italian restaurant so he was thrilled when I made it at home. He thought this dish was even better than the kind we get at the restaurant. He asks me to make it all the time. Excellent recipe!

This was definitely better than I thought it would be. I pounded the chicken breasts til they were an even thickness, and I used canned breadcrumbs with Italian seasoning. I sliced my cheese nice and thick so it would melt down and cover the chicken. We had it over 'Enhanced Spagetti.' Great meal. Thanks, Alicia!

Delicous!  I also pounded my chicken thinner (due to variations in size and thickness.)  Used Italian bread crumbs and cooked in olive oil.  Baked per directions.  Served with Cajun Pasta Fresca from this site.  Thanks

I made this for my best friend and her mom when they came to visit, and they said it was the best thing they've ever had!  So easy, too. I put the cheese on the last 10 minutes of cooking to keep it from burning.  Very good!

This was SOOO excellent.  Next time I will use more sauce but all in all, really delicious.  It was very easy too, I pounded 3 chicken breast halves pretty thin, then followed the recipe exactly.

Fantastic recipe. I haven't a clue what makes this one taste so good but it really is to die for. Followed the recipe to a "T" and it came out great.

I'm not always the best cook so this recipe was great! It was easy and tasty. My husband really enjoyed it too. Some people complained about the breading falling off, I didn't have that problem at all. It all worked! I will be making this again, but with more sauce (I like lots of sauce). Thanks!

Absolutely wonderful recipe.  Easy and delicious.  I've tried other Chicken Parmesan recipes but this one is the best! I'll be sticking to this recipe and toss the others.  
My husband also raved about it!  
The only modification I made was adding some cheddar cheese over the top of the mozzerella and adding a bit more sauce to fit our taste.  Garlic bread and/or pasta and its a complete meal!  Thank you so much!

This recipe is very good and easy to make. I did change it a bit though. When preparing the chicken, I dipped it into the beaten eggs and then the bread crumbs twice. I did not fry the chicken. I just put it in the oven for 40 minutes, then added the tomato sauce and shredded Monterey Jack cheese in the last 10 minutes... This has become a favorite in our family!

I just made this last night for some company.  Yummy!  After I pat the chicken dry, I dredged it in a salt, pepper, garlic powder, and flour mixture.  Then I dipped it in the egg mixture before I coated it in the (1 cup)Italian seasoned bread crumbs and (1 cup) parmesan cheese mixture.  I didn't have monterey jack cheese or any sliced cheese.  So I used 2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese.  I also mixed 1 Tbp sugar w/ Prego pasta sauce.  My husband and friends really enjoyed it.  He even asked me to make it again next week.  The only reason this is not rated five stars is because there are other recipes that we absolutely love.  But this is a keeper.

I've made this recipe 3 times.  And it just gets better everytime.  I always use Pepperjack cheese though, gives it a kick!  And I usually add sliced mushrooms to the sauce as well.  One time I used (more on accident from buying the wrong kind) chicken tenders (like, strips) instead of breasts, and it turned out pretty well like that, with shredding the cheese over it instead of slices.

I ended up following the recipe, but added an old technique of seasoned flour before the egg step.  This made everything coat very nicely.  Since I pounded the chicken, it didn't take long to cook the chicken to a golden brown.  Since I used my grandma's old cast iron skillet I was able to brown the chicken then add the sauce and cheese (mozzarella) and stick it right in the oven.  My husband loved it!  Thank you.

This was the first time I ever made Chicken Parmesan and it was fantastic.  I dipped my chicken in melted butter then the breadcrumbs mixed with parmesan.  I didn't pan fry them first, but just put them straight into a 9X13 pan, topping them with spaghetti sauce and LOTS of mozzarella cheese.  350 degrees for 30 minutes and dinner was served!

Fast, easy, and delicious!  I added garlic to the
seasoned bread crumbs and used Classico brand basil and tomato sauce run through the food processor to get rid of the chunks of tomato.  A
sprinkle of freshly grated parmesan cheese on top
of each serving gives it great flavor.

This recipe is a favorite of my husbands, he requests this often! I put the chicken in a plastic ziploc bag one peice at a time and pound with a mallet to tenderize and then coat with the bread crumb mixture, brown in the oil, drain on paper towel. I then bake it on a cookie sheet for 25 mins. until cooked thru. We can then use the chicken in a variety of ways. We make parsmean chicken as the recipe directs or our favorite way is to use it cut up on a salad with honey mustard dressing!! Yummy!!

This was good and smelled great.  Not anything to write home about, but maybe that's because I don't like chicken parmesan.  All in all, an easy and pretty good recipe.  3/31/08 - Ok, I am changing this from 4 stars to 5 stars.  I made this again and the boyfriend just LOVED it.  I did too.  So easy and so good.  Will go into our regular rotation.

This recipe was quick and easy.  I added minced garlic to olive oil and cut the cooking time.  Instead of Monteray Jack, I used Mozzarella and freshly greated Parmesan.  My kids and and my boyfriend really loved it!  Definitely restaurant quality.

Good Chicken Parmesan, Alicia. I don't use bottled pasta sauce. Instead I have one I do in the microwave that takes 10 minutes and tastes like you spent all day on it. My family loved this recipe. I'll definitely be making this again and again. Thanks.

EXCELLENT..it's sooo easy to make and I can probably make it a second time (which, I WILL) without looking at the recipe. It tastes absolutely fabulous my boyfriend kept thanking me for a delicious meal. If you don't like this recipe, you need to get your taste buds checked. 
My only recommendation is to pound the chicken breast so it's not so thick.

Wow!! We eat a lot of chicken and I am always trying new recipes, and this one is the best I've tried in a very long time! It was excellent. I can't wait to make it again. Next time, I will add a little more tomato sauce, since the kids were scrapping the dish for more. I'm on a low fat diet, so I will use low fat cheese and an egg substitute and see how that works! Great recipe.

This recipe was excellent.  My sister took leftovers to lunch and called me as she was eating it to say how good it was.  The only changes I'll make the next time is to decrease the amount of cheese and breadcrumbs to a little over 1/2 cup, I ended up throwing alot of it out after coating the chicken.

June 20/00 - My family enjoyed this dish.  I added Italian seasoning to the tomato sauce to give it more flavor.

I followed the recommendation to add garlic, put a little sauce on top, and added mozzarella cheese for just the last 8 min. It was delicious!

Loved it! Could someone assist me with this problem? Even if I refrigerate the chicken breadcrumb mixture I find it sticks a bit to the saucepan. I generally spray it, I try different saucepans & it still sticks. My family loves this recipe -very filling.

Loved it! Used Rao’s Marinara (the best in my opinion) and used about 20oz. I shop at Krogers and used Private Selection brand of their herb Parmesan panko bread crumbs. Didn’t need to add Parmesan or any other seasonings. I pounded 3 breasts and then shook in flour, then egg wash, then bread crumbs. Fried for only a couple of minutes on each side and then baked in sauce for about 15 min, added sliced fresh mozzarella for a couple more minutes. Hubs loved it! You could also slice the breasts in half horizontally instead of pounding.

I used a homemade tomato basil sauce to cook the chicken in, and topped it with both mozzerella and some habanero monterey jack cheese.  Used a mix of panko and cornmeal instead of bread crumbs and put garlic powder and dried onions in the breading mix and pounded the breasts flan and about 3/4" thick. Cook for 35 to 40 minutes covered with tin foul, then add cheese.  So good!! So juicy!! Amazing!!!

This was pretty good.  Everyone liked it.  I only used two large chicken breasts and sliced them thin to make four pieces.  There was plenty for the 3 of us and even some leftover for lunch.  Served with angel hair pasta and a salad.

Everyone loved this and already requested a repeat. Like a few others, I added granulated onion, garlic and Italian seasoning to the breadcrumb mix. I panfried about 4- 5 minutes a side then put in the oven with extra sauce on top and cheese. I used Victoria’s Marinara in jar.

My mind was still in work when I started cooking, so I accidentally skipped the step to brown the chicken after coating it. Regardless, it turned out great. I used thin sliced chicken breast topped with thick mozzarella cheese slices from the deli. Took about 25 min. Served over angel hair pasta with steamed broccoli and toast with garlic salt.

This was amazing! I read a lot of reviews before making this. I added a ton more spices to my bread mixture including, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning, garlic powder and onion powder, and chilled it for a little bit after breading it. I fried mine in a cast iron skillet and after the first one started to stick, I realized I needed way more oil than 1 tbs and that fixed the problem instantly. I only cooked them on both sides until golden brown, then finished them in the oven for 10 minutes, then put shredded mozzarella (all I had) on top for another 5 minutes. Served over angel hair pasta. Delicious!

With the exception of the cheese (I used fresh mozzarella) because I didn't have monterey jack cheese, the recipe was made as written. My husband and I found it very bland and we wouldn't make it again.

I took others advice and double dipped the coating, I refrigerated the breaded chicken for an hour in order for the breading to stick better during cooking. browned it on both sides ...I put it on a cookie sheet and baked it for 20 minutes..the breading fell off anyway..I was very dissapointed with this dish.

This is a terrific recipe, however, sautéing the chicken for 8-12 minutes per side is ridiculous, unless you want to eat shoe leather! I brown the chicken for 2-3 minutes per side just to get them golden. They will finish cooking in the oven. Come out perfect every time!!!

Loved it. I made three chicken breast with cheese just like the recipe. I made one more but with plane non seasoned bread crumbs add garlic powder and some all season. Because I can't eat dairy I wasn't sure it was gonna work out for me. It was delicious without cheese. Its super simple but has lots of flavor not to mention pretty fast. My fiance let let know to save this forever. Oh and my two year old ate all her dinner. :)

Another favourite dish that I make often. My boyfriend gets pumped whenever he walks in and smells it cooking. I also make this for my neighbour as a thank you when he works on my vehicle.  Such a great dish! Thank you for sharing

This got the enthusiastic approval of my picky, 14 year old son. I used mozzarella cheese and olive oil, but no other changes. We'll add this to the rotation for sure! My son said it would easily be $14 per serving at a restaurant- great endorsement for him :)

I am 14 and I cooked this for my family of 4 last night. We did not have all the ingredients so we replaced the eggs with milk, Parmesan with Mozzarella and  Monterey Jack with Provolone. Either way, it was very good on a bed of spaghetti noodles!

This recipe is simple. I pounded out my chicken breast and dipped in flour before the egg. I fried the chicken then cut it up and let it simmer in pasta sauce. My husband, my teenage son and and I enjoyed it . I couldnt give it 5 stars because it wasn't anything spectacular. I definitely will be making this again though.

Great recipe. My husband thinks I can cook now after making this dish. I switched the cheese to Pepper Jack instead of Monterey Jack for some bite. It did turn out good.

Family loved it but one didn't like the pepper jack cheese that i used instead of monterrey jack so the next time, (and there will be a next time ) I'll change that. I just cooked in the skillet till the crust was brown then baked in the oven for thirty or forty five minutes till no longer pink in the middle. Came out nice and juicy and pulled apart with a fork. Can't wait to make this again.

This was incredibly delicious!! I added 1 tablespoon of garlic powder to the bread crumb mix and a half of tablespoon of onion salt. I cooked the chicken in the pan for only 5-6 minutes per side. I didn't put a lot of the sauce in the baking pan bc I didn't want the chicken to be soggy. I cooked the chicken in the oven around 30 minutes and then put 1 mozzarella cheese slice on each chicken breast and put it back in the oven for 3-5 minutes.

This was very easy to make and delicious. I however used mozzarella instead, and I butterflied my chicken breast.  I'll definitely have to make a big batch and freeze some of it to have easy homemade meals

Really like the simplicity of this recipe. One item: the advised breadcrumbs and parmesan was a larger amount than required to coat the chicken. Probably 2/3's of the original amounts should be fine. Good stuff!

Great, simple recipe. Only small change was I used grated double cheddar cheese instead and covered with tinfoil for first 10 minutes of cooking. Hubby said it was the best chicken Parmesan he's ever had.

I really liked the flavor of the breading on this,  I did make a few changes however.  I cut a bit on the breadcrumbs and added a bit more cheese.  turned out smashing.  also, word to the wise, if you have rather thick chicken breast I would suggest cutting them in half horizontally to maximise your breading to chicken ratio.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out super moist and very flavorful. I was just cooking for two tonight so I used two smaller chicken breasts and only fried them for 8 minutes total with 4 minutes per side. I also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and parmesan cheese. It tasted like a nice take out dinner but much cheaper to make! Thanks for sharing this yummy and easy recipe. :)

This is quick and really flavorful! To make it even easier, after sautéing the chicken in a cast iron pan, I pour heated sauce right on top, top with the cheese (had and used provolone) and put it straight into the oven.

Slicing the chicken in half or pounding it thin helps a lot! I used three breasts sliced in half and it fit perfectly in the 9x13 dish. I agree with others that one egg and half the bread crumb mixture. I had to waste a lot do it.  Delicious and easy recipe! Will make again.

Super delicious. I didn't pound the chicken--just butterflied them and then cut at the "line of symmetry" to get 2 thinner breasts from one. I do that with all my chicken as I don't care to take the time and energy to pound. Used Panko bread crumbs. Added about 1 teaspoon of salt, about 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning, and a couple dashes of thyme to the bread crumbs. The chicken was perfectly moist and the flavor was fantastic. I was so happy to have leftovers to eat the next day. Will definitely add to the dinner rotation. Thank you for an outstanding recipe!

This was really good! Just make sure you rotate your chicken on all four sides. Mine got a little to brown but it was amazing. I'll make this all the time!

I made this yesterday with my boyfriend. I must say this is probably the best chicken Parmesan recipe I've ever tried and my boyfriend agrees. Very easy to make, the only thing I did differently was instead of seasoned breadcrumbs I bought normal breadcrumbs and just added my own seasoning. Which was garlic salt, black pepper and smoked paprika and that worked really well. Please try this recipe you won't be disappointed.

This was so yummy and easy, great weeknight chicken parm recipe.  I made as written, but my cutlets were thin, so I just added my hot sauce after browning and finished on the stove.  Yummy do-over, for sure! Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR,

My Italian boyfriend said this was the best chicken parmesan he has ever had! It is so delicious! This was my first time making it so I stuck fairly close to the recipe. However, I did use chicken breast tenders which produced many smaller portions in a shorter time frame, and I switched the cheddar to provolone. Next time I might experiment a little more, but it is delectable as it!

Very delicious used some of the advice of reviews and found that yes the last five minutes was better for the cheese but if you cooked the chicken entirely on the skillet why would u have to bake it more than just to melt cheese... Anyway great meal

This was my first time making Chicken Parmesan, and honestly, this recipe is AMAZING!! I used Italian bread crumbs for a boost of extra flavor, and I shook the chicken in a Ziploc plastic bag to prevent a mess in the kitchen. Although the recipe calls for Monterey jack cheese, I used a combination of shredded Romano, Fontina, Parmesan and Mozzarella cheese. I served the Chicken Parmesan over a bed of angel hair pasta. This recipe is a HUGE hit at my place, and I want to try to make sandwiches for lunch sometime. :-)

This was delicious! I butterflied my chicken breasts instead of halving them, then coated them in seasoned flour before breading them. I also added some honey mustard to the egg before dipping the floured chicken in. The mustard gives it a little extra zing. I seasoned the breadcrumb/cheese mixture also.   I like to make sure that everything is seasoned so that I can add as much tastiness as possible :) Garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, smoked paprika, and Italian seasoning I believe is what I added. But I still think it would be great without, just a matter of personal preference. After breading it, I put it in the fridge for 30 mins to make sure the breading stuck to the chicken well.  I didn't fry the chicken for as long as the recipe says because I was worried that it would dry out in the oven if it was cooked for so long in the pan. So I just made sure they were nicely browned (about 3 mins per side) then finished them off in the oven with the sauce. Added the cheese with 5 mins left as others have suggested. Chicken stayed crispier that way and the cheese didn't burn. The chicken came out super moist inside and packed with flavour. I served it with fettuccine Alfredo (used a sauce recipe from this site) and garden salad. My boyfriend ate all of his and the rest of mine that I couldn't finish! Will definitely make this again.

This was absolutely delicious!I read a ton of the reviews & like many of you out there, I was tossed between "should I make this how it's stated by frying & then baking?"  OR "should I skip the frying part like many others have and just bake it?"  Well, I'm glad I decided to do the recipe as it WAS STATED. I fried them first on MEDIUM heat.  For about 3 or 4 min. per side. The chicken was slightly pink inside afterwards but that was fine because I knew it would finish off when baking. I'm glad I did this step because it developed a beautiful deep golden crunchy texture on the outside. I then baked in oven for 25 min. I conducted a test & on only one piece of chicken I put a slice of mozzarella on it. It was fine for the 25 min! It did not burn as some has stated. Perhaps they used thinly sliced mozzarella from the deli? I cut a block of mozzarella and didn't cut it paper thin. For the rest of them I added the cheese 10 min. before it was done. Next time I will put the cheese on right from the start. It melted beautifully during the 25 min. I had it in the oven.  

There was no need for me to pound my ckn breasts down because when I buy them, I slice them lengthwise and get 2 pieces out of it & there is no need to pound them down. They are about the 1/2" thick anyway.
I NEVER measure out breadcrumbs, to me it's silly. I eyeball it and use half the amt of cheese.  I used 1 egg.  It was fine for 9 pieces of chicken cutlet! This is a WONDERFUL recipe enjoyed by ALL! Must try! :)

I think this is a great Chicken Parm recipe! I usually make double the recipe. The only thing that I changed that I've always done when chicken is breaded is that I dip it in FLOUR, then egg, then breadcrumbs. The flour allows you to skip the refrigeration step that some added because it allows the egg to better stick to the "slimy" chicken :-) I also used Moz instead of Monterey Jack, but I think it's just a preference thing. Thanks for the great recipe and all of the good reviews!

Well done and definitely worthy of 5 stars. Only changes I made was dusted mine in flour/pepper and seasoning salt. Let them rest in the fridge for half hr the pulled them out, dipped em in egg wash, then breadind and back to the fridge for another half hr or so. I used jarlsberg cheese instead as cheese topping and my own home made bread crumb mix. I only had newmans own pasta sauce on hand (not a fan of it, to salty) next time I will make my own. I reduced amounts for 3 large breast pounded to 1/2 in. 1/2 cup packed freshly grated parm. Fried in medium heated cast iron pan 4 min a side then baked them for 20 to 30 min @ 350 to a internal temp 165 then turned off oven and put jarlsberg ontop to sit in warm oven for 5 min just to melt nicely. This one is definitely a keeper.

So yummy! As many other people, I used thin sliced chicken breasts. I cut the bread crumbs and Parmesan in half and only used 1 egg. Also, I cooked the spaghetti and then put it in the bottom of the baking dish. Poured double the amount of sauce on the spaghetti and then put the chicken on top.  Cooked for 10 mins and then added mozzarella cheese for the last 10 mins.  Turned out delicious!

This is delicious!  I was initially a little concerned because of the lack of seasoning on the chicken, but the seasoned bread crumbs were more than enough.  The flavor was perfect.  The other reviewers were dead on, you only need one egg and I waited until the last 5 minutes to add the cheese (I used mozarella).  I skipped the pasta because I'm trying to lose weight and didn't feel like I missed a thing.  I'll definitely make again, and again...and again.

This recipe is delicious!  I've tried other chicken parmesan recipes from this site and this one is our favorite.  I added a little garlic and onion powder to my breadcrumb mixture just to give it a little more flavor, and I used a roasted garlic tomato sauce.  Hubby went back for more.  I will be making this again!!

Just perfect.  I used chicken cutlets, fresh parmesan, and added some salt and pepper to the egg.  The chicken was juicy and not over-breaded as in other recipes I have tried.  I served this over some creamy polenta for a great meal.

This has become one of my husband's and my favorite recipes! It is super easy, and it turns out tasting just like the chicken parmesan you get at restaurants! The only adjustment we make is using mozzarella cheese instead of monterrey jack cheese, and then waiting until the chicken has five minutes left in the oven to put the cheese on so it doesn't burn. We also don't cook the chicken quite all the way through before putting it in the oven so it is still able to soak up the moisture from the spaghetti sauce while it finishes cooking in the oven.

Exceptional! I followed other reviewers' suggestions to flatten the chicken and use mozzerella cheese, as well as start with half of the bread crumb / parmesan mixture.

I was unsure about this recipe, because of the jack cheese. However, this was so good, it could become a weekly favorite!!

Very, very good.  I followed the recipe as is, except for substituting swiss for the Monterey Jack cheese.  Overall, since the husband was very happy, so was I!

This is one of my family's favorite meals. Instead of bread crumbs I use crushed cereal and add some garlic power, oregano & Italian seasoning to the mix. I make some spaghetti and place the cooked chicken on top and melt some Mozzarella or Provolone slices over the chicken and it always turns out great!

I modified by mixing a half jar of Alfredo with a half jar of regular spaghetti sauce to make pink sauce. I layered 1/4 of the sauce on bottom of dish, then a half package of al dente spaghetti noodles, then 1/2 cup shredded cheese. I put the cooked chicken on top, spooned the rest of the sauce and sprinkled with a cup of shredded mozzarella. From there, baked as directed. My 6 yr old LOVED it and I thought it was great too.

I think this recipe needs tweaking.

I struggled with the burning the outside of the breadcrumbs even though I had the heat med low.

Also the chicken was bland.

I suggest after coating with egg, season the chicken then add breadcrumbs.

Also skip saute and bake only. Use extra sauce & mozzarella cheese.

We luved this. I made a few changes because I did not have bread crumbs. In a ziplock bag I put some onion crackers , some club crackers and seasonings and cruched them up. I also used sliced provelone instead of mon. jack cheese. I used Ragu chunky spag. sauce. It came out fantastic.

An easy recipe and it tastes really good! I cut and tenderized the meat really thin, because I like it better this way, also I breaded it twice to make it more crunchy. Because of a lack of time the Chicken and sauce were in the oven for just 15 min, which was totally fine and I think it doesn't even need to stay longer in there since the meat it is already cooked. All in all it took me a little more than an hour.

This was pretty good but the chicken was a tiny bit bland, and I even added a little salt and dried basil to the bread crumbs.  I will make this again but it does need a few adjustments.

Very good for such an easy recipe! As suggested I pound the chicken breasts and then seasoned them with garlic powder, salt and pepper before breading them. I also use olive oil instead of vegetable.

This was very very good, even leftover for lunch the next day! These are a few changes: cut the breading/parmesan mixture in half & reduce the egg to 1. I also added a bit of garlic powder & onion powder to the bread crumb mixture. Use Italian bread crumbs, cut the chicken into smaller pieces & took advice of others and baked the coated chicken for about 20 minutes prior to baking the dish, instead of frying. Then assembled the chicken over the sauce and baked for 15 minutes then last 5 minutes I added the cheese.

My first chicken parm and it was wonderful.  I double dipped the chicken to get a good bread coating so I ended up using more eggs (though the same amount of breading the recipe called for).  I only fried them until the coating was nice and golden and then put the cheese on in the last 5 minutes of baking.  Perfect!

Ok.... this came out so, so good. I breaded with Italian Seasoned Panko Bread Crumbs, and fired in Canola Oil until both sides got golden. Placed them in a baking pan poured home made spaghetti sauce over the chicken, placed a slice of swiss cheese over them and baked for 30 minutes.

Excellent tasty dish and fairly easy to put together!  Best review tips:  1) Pound chicken breasts to 1/2" thickness 2) After breading, set in fridge for 1/2 hour before sauteeing 3) Add cheese slices the last 5 minutes of cooking.  And my one addition - cut each breast in half so that there is more yummy breaded pieces to go around!

Good base recipe.  I used 1/2 flour, 1/2 bread crumbs.  It needs some spices and a bit of salt.  Definitely used more oil and mozarella instead of Monterey Jack.

Pretty good---baked the chicken instead of frying---health reasons.

Wow! This was the best Chicken Parm ever! I beat the breasts and also cut them in half. Mixed 1/2 cup of Italian bread crumbs with about 2/3 cup parm cheese. I did fry them, but only for about 4 minutes on each side, then baked them. YUM!

Really simple and really tasty recipe! As others said, the amount of breading is too much so I mixed some of it in with my Italian style zucchini and tomato side dish :o)  Next time I will reduce the amount and also add some garlic power and salt to the mix. I used Prego mushroom pasta sauce and it was excellent! I baked my chicken for 15 minutes, then topped with mozarella cheese and baked for 5 more minutes and it was perfect. Thanks for this easy weeknight meal!

Excellent!  I did what others said and cut down the egg as well as the parmesan and bread crumbs.  I was only making 3 breasts so I cut the recipie in half.  I used the rest of the pasta sauce for the spaghetti I served with it.  Very good!  We will definitely be having this again......soon!

This is a great base recipe to experiment with. I'm quite the novice at cooking, but I made a few changes with surprisingly tasty results.   Before breading, try marinading the chicken. I went with some olive oil, lemon juice, whatever red wine you have on hand (syrah in my case), and crushed garlic. I added some basil and garlic powder to the breading mix - not much, but enough to taste. I used a ratio of 2:1 for crumbs to Parmesan cheese.   I found 8-10 minutes to be WAY too long for sauteing - 2-4 was more than enough. Before baking, I covered all the breasts with (marinara) sauce, a layer of diced mushrooms, and finally shredded cheese. In retrospect, I would probably add the mushrooms with about 5-10 minutes left in the oven, as they ended up a bit tasteless.   All in all, a fun recipe with plenty of options for substitutions and experimenting.

Wow, this was so tasty and easy.  This will be my go to recipe for Chicken Parmesan   I used bread crumb with parmesan cheese already added but still added the listed amount (we love cheese) and used provolone cheese instead.

Pretty good and not too much hassle.  I started out making this exactly as is, using a pasta sauce I created the day before instead of some jarred thing for once.  But there is just WAY too much breading - it probably only needs half this.  Since the Parmesan is probably what is partially making the flavor, I considered if I make it again to cut the Parmesan to 2/3 and then cut the breadcrumbs themselves in half, or less.  The medium high is just too much - it just started to burn easily.  I think medium is fine for browning & then maybe a bit lower (with a lid) for cooking through.  Don't think that's my stove cause I'm seeing many comments about that.

This is the one of the BEST recipes I've found on AR.  The chicken is SO GOOD, I honestly can't believe I made this myself.  My family literally inhaled this.  The only thing I did differently was to use only 1/2 cup parm and bake the chicken instead of sautee.  Did I mention this recipe was amazing?

AMAZING! so simple and tasty, here's what i did>  I used only 2 chicken breasts and one egg and just did my own mix of Italian breadcrumbs with a little Parmesan cheese. Let them sit breaded in the fridge for like 25 minutes, and put them on a baking sheet for  15 minutes. Covered bottom of 9x13 pan sauce than put in breasts and covered them with sauce. Last few minutes i added mozzarella cheese slices. Total time i cooked chicken was about 20 minutes. Than shredded a little Parmesan cheese over them as well. Cooked pasta and done! great meal!!

This was very good. I did use Mozzarella and Parmesan for the cheese topping. Also I didn't cook the breasts all the way on the stove. I only cooked them until they were golden brown. I was worried about them over cooking in the oven. My whole family enjoyed this very much.

Yummm!!! Made this with Best Marinara In Existence from this site and it was amazing!  Coated the chicken in flour, egg, then crumb mixture. I was making it for about 20 people so I baked them, rather than frying.

We loved the recipe. I used my own marinara sauce. I also used mozzarella cheese instead of the jack. I served it over whole wheat rotini noodles. Next time I'll make garlic bread and a salad to go with the meal. Since I already had the crumb mix I made extra chicken and this half I baked for 20 minutes instead of pan frying to lower the fat. I didn't have the breading falling of that I had with the pan fried ones. These extras I'll freeze for a quick dinner on a busy day. Thank you loved the chicken.

Very good.  I used canned pizza sauce and this worked perfectly.  I only had parmesan so I sprinkled it on top of the chicken in place of the cheese slices.  Next time I want to try the slices though...

I used fresh mozzarella slices. Next time I will flatten out the chicken. It will cook faster and seem more breaded. Flavor was very good. Even my 22 month old kept asking for more "kitchen" (her word for chicken)

This was really delicious! My husband and I both loved it, as well as our picky 1yr old! This will definitely be a regular in our house from now on. The only changes I made were that I used only 1 egg so there would be less waste, and I added garlic powder and italien seasoning to the bread crumb mixture. YUM! :)

Excellent.  I used chicken tender/cutlets so the cooking time was greatly decreased.  I also used twice as much sauce because I served it over whole wheat pasta.  Tasted fantastic!

It is pretty good, though the breading didn't work for me at all, just stuck to the bottom of the skillet.  Nevertheless, it was good.  I used provolone instead of Monterey Jack cheese.  You may want to add more spices into the breading mixture (if you can get it to stick) for more flavor.

Took one reviewers suggestions: 1) Pound the chicken breasts to an even thickness; 2) Cut the egg and breading mix in half; 3) Just bake for 25-30 minutes, adding the cheese the last 5/10 minutes.

Wow, this was a great dish! I followed another reviewer's advice and pounded the chicken to about a 1/2" thick. I used mozzarella because that's what I had and placed it on top of the chicken during the last 10 minutes of baking. My boyfriend was already full with 1/2 of his meal left, but he ended up eating the whole thing anyways because it was so good!

So yummy, I'm not a fan of chicken breast, as I always think it dries out.  But this was moist and awesome!  I followed the recipe and made no changes, as I didn't feel any were necessary.

Yummy.  Husband, who "doesn't like Italian food" ate it right up.  I added garlic powder to the bread/Parmesan cheese mixture and topped with shredded Parmesan since we didn't have mozzerella or jack.

I loved this recipe! It was tasty, although I recommend doing the egg wash again and re-breading it. Much better. Also instead of tomato sauce, i recommend putting a high quality marinara over it. Yum!

Fast and easy!  I did pound my chicken breasts so that they would all be the same thickness.  This made cooking the chicken even quicker.

There's another chicken parmesan recipe on this site that doesn't use tomato sauce, and while I think that one is even better, this is still a delicious and easy-to-make chicken parmesan that is excellent served with spaghetti.  I used mozzarella over monterey jack for a more traditional flavor.  Depending on the thickness of the chicken breasts you are using, you may need to increase the cooking time as I did.

This was one of the few meals where my boyfriend went back for seconds, so I'm giving it five stars.  I served it with minute rice and sliced green peppers and it seemed to be a good combo.  I did vary from the recipe a bit.  We didn't have any bread crumbs or parm cheese in the house so I crushed up some saltines and omitted the parmesean.  We butterflied and pounded the chicken to be about 1/4 inch uncooked - it thickened to about 3/4 of an inch cooked.  Also I put a loose sheet (laid on top but not tight) of foil over the pan so the cheese wouldn't burn.  I cooked it for the full 20 minutes and it was still moist.  My only complaint was that I could detect a little chicken fat taste in the sauce.  Maybe the parm or some garlic would have masked that.  Any suggestions?  Oh and I used mozzerella cheese because that's what was in the house.

This was simple yet delicious!  I fried the chicken in olive oil and I also used homemade spaghetti sauce I had frozen.  My chicken breasts took a little longer than 20 mins and I kind of figured they would so I didnt add the cheese until the last 10 mins.  Great recipe!  I will make this again :)

This was delicious!  I had two chicken breasts I needed to use and needed to make a quick dinner.  I didn't have pasta sauce but opened a can of stewed tomatoes and added all the italian seasonings and garlic etc. to beef it up.  I also used some shredded mozzarella cheese for the top.  I browned the chicken put them on the bed of sauce and baked for about 20 mins. then added the cheese on top and baked another 10 mins.  fantastic dinner, hubby and I loved it.

This was the best chicken parmesan I have ever had. In the past I would lay the chicken on a pan and spoon some sauce over each one but this time i put the chicken in the sauce and it kept the chicken really moist. I used italian breadcrumbs and subbed mozzarella cheese instead of monterey jack.

Very good recipe.  I used thin sliced chicken breast.  I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs so I seasoned plain with salt, onion mrs dash, italian mrs dash.  I used cooking spray and browned (no oil).  It was very good and I will make again and again.

This is a good, quick recipe and it tsted great over angel hair pasta. I made the mistake of not pounding the chicken, therefore, it got a little to dark in the skillet and it took longer to cook in the oven. I will def make again but I will pound the chicken.

Great base recipe.  I gave four because I tweaked it a lot.  Whole wheat bread crumbs, pounded out first, baked only, used Stephanie's Freezer Spaghetti Sauce recipe from this site, added spices and used mozzerella.  Poured sauce over top then put cheese on.  My guests really enjoyed it

OK, it was good, but did lack a little flavor(as per my tastes). The first two cutlets I put in the pan, the breading stuck to the pan.The rest I cooked @400 for 15min and broiled on high for six mins(to brown the top). I used my own sauce, and I didn't think it overpowered the chicken at all.Unlike most other reviewers I did use the Monterrey cheese (and liked it)! I will make again, but add a few more spices to fit my taste.

I really liked this recipe.  I also made some changes that others posted in their comments: I used Mozzarella cheese instead & put it on the last 5 min of baking. Made my own pasta sauce: fresh tomatoes, can crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, salt & pepper & sugar, sauteed garlic & onions in white wine & oil.  I put the sauce on the bottom and on top of the chicken.

I'm a fan! I pounded out the chicken breasts so they were thinner before dredging them. I also used flour first before the egg wash, it helped the egg wash stick to the chicken so the bread crumbs and parm could coat the chicken. So I used flour, then egg wash, then bread crumb mixture. I also used olive oil vs vegetable to fry the chicken. This recipe has good flavor, will definatley make it again. My fiance loved it too!

This is a great recipe.  I came across it almost 6 years ago on this website and have been making it ever since.   I butterfly the chicken breast and then pound it so it’s nice and thin.  I use really good olive oil, real Parmigiano Reggiano and finish it off with mozzarella.

Tasty--no problems to speak of.  If you don't have seasoned bread crumbs, crush unsalted crackers with dried Italian herbs (namely basil, oregano, and thyme) and subsitute into the recipe.  As previous reviewers noted, it is very beneficial to pound your chicken to allow the marinara flavors to fully penetrate the chicken.

What's not to love?  Breaded and fried chicken, pasta sauce and cheese!  This is really good and really easy.  We serve it over spaghetti with a side of bread and salad!

pretty tasty for quick n easy. I didn't have monteray jack cheese, I had weight watchers chedar cheese. It still tasted really good but next time i will try pepper jack or monteray jack. Otherwise, very good. I would recommend seasoning the chicken before dipping in the egg. YUMMM!!

Very good. Serve it on top of pasta and it is amazing. Don't waste your parmesan cheese and bread crumbs, you really only need around half of what is suggested. Pound the chicken to tenderize and flatten, make sure to get as much of the egg off of the chicken before breading, you may need more oil when sautéing, and provolone cheese slices work well on top of the chicken if you don't have Monterey. Good, easy, and economical.

When my husband went for seconds I was shocked!  Chicken Parm is a dish he uses to rate the level of a restaurant.  He loved it.  I used plain bread crumbs that I seasoned myself (garlic, basil, salt, pepper, touch of oregeno) and made my own sauce.  Also used mozz, on top

I made this for my boyfriend and he really enjoyed it!!  I took the others advice and I baked the chicken for 20 minutes, then I put mozzerella cheese on it and baked for 15 more minutes.  I did not bake it in the sauce, I put the sauce just over the chicken and spaghetti on the plate and it was warmed up from that.  I also double dipped the chicken for extra breading.  Pretty easy to make but used a lot of dishes!

This is okay. The Chicken Parmesan comes out a bit soggy from the sauce - I think next time I'll bake it without the sauce and just add that at the end.

I'm still new to cooking, but this got rave reviews! I've made this twice now. I used mozzarella instead of monterey jack cheese, and I made marinara sauce using Allrecipes' Best Marinara Sauce Yet. My one suggestion is to hammer the chicken breasts so they're all the same thickness. Maybe this is a given for people who actually know how to cook, but someone had to tell me.

Excellent!  My first time making chicken parm, and everyone loved it.  Will definitely make it again.  This wasn't quite enough for my crowd of four, so I may add 2-4 additional chicken breast halves next time; there were enough leftover crumbs and eggs to accomodate additional chicken.  Thanks for this excellent recipe!

This is our family's newest "fave" for dinner.  I use the Italian Panko Breadcrumbs and it turns out perfect each time.  I also use a combination of cheddar and mozzarella cheese.

This was the best chicken parmesan I have ever made.  The chicken came out so tender and moist.  The only change I made was I cooked my chicken for about 30 minutes.  Wonderful recipe!!!

This recipe was very good and easy to make. I skipped frying the chicken breast to make it faster and more healthy. I fileted three chicken breast so they were thin, which made them bake through without getting dry. I used a combination of monterry jack and mozzarella cheeses. The cheese got a little too bubbly for my taste but otherwise it was good. I would recommend using more sauce if you're a sauce fiend like myself. I served it with parsley to garnish.

I didn't think it was that great. I wish I would have done the breaded chicken in the oven instead of a fry pan; that might have made it a little better.

Excellent recipe. I poured pasta sauce in dish, added chicken/cheese and then poured more pasta sauce over top. I covered the dish with aluminum foil for the first 15 min of cooking. I then removed the foil and cooked an additional 5 min. The chicken was moist and delicious. Will definitely make many times again. Thanks.

This was delicious and simple to make.  I read a review from someone else saying to cut the amount of dry ingredients in half, well I think you need more than half but maybe not the full amount.  Chicken was perfectly done.  I added garlic powder, onion powder and red pepper flakes to the dry ingredients.  Will make again.

So easy and yummy. I used mozerrella to melt over it and put it under the broiler for 3 minutes at the very end to make a beautifal presentation. I also took the advice of beating the chicken down flatter with a rolling pin in a plastic bag first to ensure it was cooked more even. mmm mmm. will make again

so simple but bland.I think the prego jarred sauce ruined it for me. I think next time I'd either find a better jarred sauce or make my own. Family was just picking at it. Wasn't that great.

Too good to be true! If you like chicken parmesan, you will L-O-V-E this recipe! It's painfully easy, yet it tastes like what you'd get at a restaurant. My DF tore this UP! I am definitely going to be adding this to our regular rotation. Also try serving on a bed of pasta with red sauce and chunky vegetables, like onion and zucchini. No matter how you serve it, this recipe is the bomb! Thanks!

It was ok....when I fried my chicken it burnt both sides.  Not sure why as I had it on low heat.  Went 8 minutes on one side and then only 4 on the other.  If I did this again I might just try broiling them on a cookie sheet instead.

this is absolutley amazing! my family would not quit raving about this! (its so easy to make, too!) the only change I made was to use egg whites instead of whole eggs to make it alittle healthier. Not sure what cheese I actually used..I think just straight up cheddar, but you could almost use any cheese..

This is the best chicken parmesan recipe I've ever fixed!  The whole family loved it. As suggested by others, I only used 1/2 C of parmesan and 1/2 C of breadcrumb with garlic powder added, and just one egg, which was plenty. I put pizza sauce on the bottom of the baking dish, and a traditional pasta sauce on top of the chicken.  Very very yummy!!!

very moist and tender chicken. It had such a wonderful flavor. I ended up cutting the recipe in half because I only cook for 2 people. I did add garlic and onion powder to the breadcrumbs. The breadcrumbs I used were Italian seasoned. Thank you for this recipe

My family loved this. The recipe makes way too much bread crumb mix.Add crumbs to coating bowl in small amounts and bag up the rest to use on something else later....like eggplant. Very quick and easy to make.

Terrific! I made this for my family and modified it with the help of the other reviews. I used panko bread crumbs and added garlic powder to the mix. Lastly, I baked the chicken for 15 minutes and sprinkled the mozzarella cheese during the final 5 minutes of baking.

Very good.  I used chicken cutlets to cut down on cooking time.  Also, I used an entire jar of spaghetti sauce since I was serving the chicken over angel hair pasta.  I added garlic powder to the bread crumb mixture (next time I will decrease the bread crumb mixture...I had a lot leftover).  And I added the cheese at the last five minutes.

This was great! My boyfriend just raved about it. The chicken was so moist and the flavor was excellent. The only thing I did different was to add some garlic powder and onion salt to the bread crumbs and cheese. I will absolutely be making this again!

Great meal-added garlic powder in the bread crumb mixture,sprinkled with more Parm., cooked at 350 for 30 min and used a slice of Prov. instead of Jack (putting on the chicken during the last 5 min.) Will make again soon!

I didn't have all the correct ingredients, but I decided to give it a try with the types of cheese I had on hand. I used shredded mozzarella and slices of havarti. I didn't like the idea of frying, so I baked them on a cookie sheet at 350*. After 20 minutes, I took the chicken out and assembled them in a lasagna pan over the sauce. I continued baking for another 15 minutes, adding the cheese slices during the last 5. My cheese wasn't melted quite the way I wanted, so I flipped the oven to broil and waited until the cheese got slightly brown and bubblely. It came out great! I served it with a mixed greens salad and corn bread with garlic butter.

As written I would only give this 3 stars. I did pound the breasts out thinner before breading. I used a 3 step breading process by dredging the chicken in seasoned flour before the egg wash-the bread crumbs will adhere better during browning. I put the browned breasts in a low oven to keep them warm and crisp while I heated the marinara sauce and cooked some pasta. About 10 min. before serving I spooned about 1/2 cup sauce over each breast and then sprinkled a combination of shredded Parmesan and mozzarella over the top.  I put the dish under the broiler to melt and brown up the cheese. Seved with sauce over the pasta (penne) on the side and more shredded parm. Yum!

I make this often, as my whole family loves it. I always pound the chicken thin, and top with either Cheddar or an Italian cheese blend. And I don't put the cheese on until the last few minutes. Really easy!

This was pretty good.  For the cheese, I used mozzarella.  And for the pasta sauce I used the Old World style by Ragu.  I found that it needed a little more sauce than it called for, but only a little.

Amazingly easy recipe.  Chose to do three breasts with a double dipping of Parmesan breading.  I recommend if you like the parmesan breading for the chicken.  Served with Fusilloni noodles. The large noodles complemented the large chicken breasts. Ended up using sauce used to cook chicken to dress the pasta.  Recommend for bigger family event.

I pounded the chicken first and it cooked more evenly and faster.  Frying first made the chicken so much more moist that it is when I just bake.  Yummy!

Loved the chicken!  I used tips recommened by other reviewers like adding the cheese at the end, using seasoned bread crumbs and flattening the chicken is a must.  The ingredients can certainly be cut down as I also had leftovers.  I like my chicken parm to be crunchy so I did not cook the chicken with tomato sauce.  Rather, I served the sauce over spaghetti.  The jack cheese was fantastic.  I have some picky eaters and I will definitely make this again.

This is a staple for my family. I prefer to flatten the chicken prior to dipping in egg and breadcrumb/cheese mixture. I have used provolone and mozzarella at the end when I didn't have mont. jack. Still really good.

This was great! I made some changes to make it healthy. I did not use any chz. For the breading mixture I used breadcrumbs, wheat germ, garlic powder, basil, paprika, and parsley. I cooked it olive oil which almost burned it (next time I'll use canola). I put some chopped onions and garlic in the bottom of my 9x13 and poured in some red wine and cooked that for 8 minutes, then added 1/2 a large can of Hunts no sugar added pasta sauce, and added a little basil. I scooped some of the sauce w/ garlic and onions on top of the chicken and baked. No cheese was needed to make this chicken absolutely delicious. I just served this w/ some steamed and sauted (in butter Pam) green beans. Fancy meal...my family loved it!

Yummy!  I made this with my own home made sauce.  My only changes were: I cut each chicken breast in half for a thinner breast which cut the skillet time to 5 - 7 mins per side.  I placed the chicken in the greased pan without pouring the sauce in first.  I topped each breast with some sauce and placed a slice of Mozzarella rather than Jack cheese on top.  My family loved it!

I've been making Chicken Parmesan like this for years - I think it may have been the very first thing I learned how to cook correctly!  I do pound the chicken flat first, season the chicken with garlic salt and pepper, and use mozzarella cheese.  This is delicious with Best Marinara Sauce Yet, but a good jarred sauce will work in a pinch too!

I was initially scared that the chicken would be dried after cooking it in the skillet, but it was surprisingly tender and juicy, not to mention, very tasty. The night before, I had actually seasoned it with Italian seasoning, and pounded it for about five minutes. I find the seasoning gives the chicken more taste, and the pounding tenderizes the chicken.

This was so simple and really good!! I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs so I used regular and added garlic salt and italian seasoning. I didn't read the reviews til after (I was in a rush) or I would have flattened the chicken a little. It was a bit too thick for me. Also waited til the last 5 minutes to add the cheese.

This is delicious and easy.  Its not necessary to sautee the chicken first.  Just throw it all in the oven for 25 mins or so.

Had this for supper tonight.  Very good.  Served it over angel hair pasta.  The only thing I did differant was to add a chopped jalapeno and finely chopped onion to the bread crumbs.  Thanks.

It was very good. My daughter wanted me to make more. I made a few changes though. I only made three chicken breast. Also, after dipping it in egg and then the crumb mixture, I dipped it in egg and the crumb mixture a second time. I used plain bread crumbs and added onion and garlic powder. I also used a canola oil spray rather than using vegetable oil to cook the chicken in. Last, I couldn't find the cheese slices so I used shredded. It was wonderful and I know I'll be making it again.

I went into cooking this thinking there is just NO WAY making a memorable Chicken Parm could be tis easy and use so few ingredients.  Not feeling very creative last night, I followed recipe exactly.  My family went nuts!!  Was it the Monterey Jack Cheese (instead of the normal Mozarella)??  I don't know...but they have begged me to make it again soon.  This has made the "rotation"!!  Thanks

This was just okay. I was expecting a lot better from what I had read in the reviews but it was quite a disappointment. I will not make this again.

Great chicken- tastes just like my favorite Italian restaurant's Chicken Parm!  I added about 2 tablespoons of milk to the egg, and let the chicken sit in the egg for about 2 minutes before breading.  I also poked the chicken lightly with a sharp knife to tenderize while they were in the egg.  I added the cheddar toward the end of the baking time, as well.  Really great chicken; my picky husband's favorite!

I made this last night and it was pretty good. My husband said it was a 7 or 8 out of 10 so I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars. I might use more tomato sauce if I make this again.

This was pretty good.  A nice change from the regular chicken dinners.  I needed more oil to cook the chicken in.  I haven't quite figured out how to cook chicken in a tablespoon of oil without burning it.  It also needed more sauce if you're going to put it with pasta.

This was so yummy! I used chicken tenders, so that I did not need to flatten. I had to turn the heat down because they started burning in the skillet, and I doubled the sauce so that we'd have extra to put on top of garlic butter angel hair. I also served with a caesar salad and cheese garlic bread. This was an allaround success, and staying in the recipe box!

I have tried many variations of chicken parm recipes for years.  What I liked especially about this was the fact that the frying beforehand sealed in the juices.  I also liked the variation of cheese opposed to standard shredded mozzerlla.  I agree that allowing the cutlets ( i halved my pieces down the middle)  to chill in the fridge for minutes before frying does allow the breading to stick.  I think the best about this most basic standby recipe is that is allows for variation in terms of cheese,tomatoe sauce, flavoring, etc

This was good- I made it with the best marinara sauce found on allrecipes instead of marinara from a jar. It was wonderful- I would agree-- less crumbs. I also used shredded parm. cheese (1/2) cup mixed with 1/2 cup italian cheese blend shredded cheese. Put 1/2 of the marinara in bottom of pan- put chicken breasts on top with marinara covering the rest of the chicken breasts. Put shredded moz. cheese on top about 5 min before serving. Baked in oven at 350 for about 1 hour.

This was okay.  I think it would have been better w/mozerella.  The meat just didn't have enough flavor.  I re-read a lot of the reviews. Can you give a recipe 5 stars when you make so many adjustments??  The recipe it's self is only a few stars but perhaps if you go through and read all the diff ways ppl variatied then it might turn out better.

I'd give this recipe 4.5 stars...it was very good.  As recommended by others, I dipped the chicken in egg, then flour and then the bread crumbs.  I baked it instead of doing the saute.

I tried this chicken parmesan, it was the first time I cooked it as well as the first time I ate ii and I loved it. I've just added some oregons on the cheese and some parmesan on the tomato sauce. I think that It would be be better if only made with chicken breasts stakes because it gets too heavy and a little dry with the breasts halves (maybe the chicken breasts I used were too big). Besides that I found it very delicious!

Yum!  I made this lastnight for my boyfriend, he said it's the best chicken parmesan he's ever had.  It was my first time making it, so it didn't go exactly as planned.  The breading browned very quickly in the skillet, after only 1-2 minutes, so I had to finish cooking it in the oven (about 30 minutes).  I used a combination of Classico Spicy Red Pepper and Spicy Tomato & Basil spaghetti sauce.  I used the Monteray Jack cheese (added in the last 7-8 minutes of baking), and the flavors of the Garlic & Herb breading, sauce, and cheese, all meshed perfectly.  I served it over buttery spaghetti noodles, with a crisp, green salad and garlic bread.  Will definitely be making this one again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good chicken parm.  I used shredded mozzerella cheese just because of preference and only put the cheese on the last 5 minutes of baking and it was very yummy.  I do think that the amount of bread crumbs it calls for is a little much.  I didn't use as much as called for and still have some left over.  So next time I will reduce the amount of bread crumbs and parm cheese.  Very good though!

Great! I love this dish. Very simple to make. I am going to double the amount of sauce the next time because I served over a plate of angel hair pasta. Sprinkle a few parsley flakes on top of the cheese and you have a very attractive dish to serve- and tasty too! The chicken tasted great. Thanx.

This was really good but the breading did not stay on the chicken as good as I was hoping it would. Served with a garlic & olive oil spaghetti. Will make again.

This recipe has a very good flavor and always turns out well. I always use mozarella over the top out of preference. Make sure you use a big enough pan to do all the breasts at once, or the bread crumbs that drop off of the first will start to burn as you are cooking other batches.

We regurally go to an Italian resturant and always order their chicken parmesan and the meal costs over $50.00. After going there last Saturday, I decided that I would give this recipe a try for comparson. I think this is just as good, if not better, than the fancy restaruant. Definately 5 stars both for taste and being easy to prepare.

Very good recipe.  I did follow the top 2, "most helpful" suggestions though.  Even after refridgerating for over an hour, the breading did fall off.  I suspect this might be because the oil was not hot enough or not enough.  I can't wait to try again.  The taste was great.

Very easy and tasty. Only gave 4 stars because it was on the dry side. Next time I will add more sauce. I followed others and only used 1 egg and 1/2 of crumbs and cheese called for.

This recipe was fantastic, but I did change it a little bit. I used spaghetti sauce with mushrooms, and instead of doing the bread crumb/egg mixture, I used Shake N Bake Italian to save some time.

I served over spaghetti noodles and we ate it up in minutes! Very tasty.

Everyone liked this one.  I had to cut short the cooking time on the stove because it started burning.  So then I also had to leave it in the oven longer to cook through.  And I didn't have mozzerella, but it still was good.

THis was soo good. I kind of mix this recipe and the "easy chicken parmesan" one. The only thing is that I got easy confused with quick. It does take a bit of time to get it all prepared, but its worth it!

Wow, good!  I used Muenster cheese instead.  I also used plain breadcrumbs and mixed in some basil, marjoram, oregano & freshly crushed black pepper.  For the sauce, I used a spicy three pepper spaghetti sauce.  Highly recommended!

Delicious! I made this for my parents with some fresh sauteed spinach in olive oil and garlic -- the meal was fantastic. My only change to the recipe was to use fresh bread crumbs (put bread in food processes, then brown in pan with some butter and seasonings if you'd like). Enjoy!

This recipe was great. I didnt have pasta sauce on hand so I made my own using diced tomatoes in herb roasted garlic, red wine, garlic powder and a few more ingredients. I loved the recipe and added cheddar cheeese instead of Montery Jack.
I'll be making this recipe again for sure. Thanx for sharing

Very good and SO SIMPLE to make!!  Chicken turned out fork tender and very tasty!  I did butterfly the breast (cooking 5 minutes per side), and used a 26 oz jar of sauce – everything else to the letter.  Went really well with angel hair pasta!  Next time I will try some garlic-mashed potatoes!  A definite keeper! Thank you for sharing!

Great recipe!!!  My husband and I are not big chicken eaters, but this was wonderful.  My only suggestion is to add garlic powder to the egg and also the crumbs.

This was so delicious!  It was quick and easy enough to make on a weeknight after work, especially if you use jarred sauce or make your own ahead of time.  It tasted like it took a lot longer than about 30 minutes!

this recipe is fabulous!!! although, i had to reduce the amount of bread crumbs and parmesan  (i was only making enough for two, and the "division" didn't come out right, there was so much left over!!) I had to add some basil, oregano, garlic and onion to the sauce so it would really be Italian. AND we also were out of the m.j. cheese, so i shredded good ol' mozzerella on each breast before baking. My fiance was impressed at how JUICY the chicken was. No more take out for us :-) thanks, alicia

This was okay. I used whole wheat crust cut from sliced bread and pulsed them in my food processor. I skipped cooking the chicken in the skillet and went straight into the oven. I cooked them for 30 minutes at 400, sprinkled shredded cheese blend over the tops of the breasts and returned them to the oven for another 10 minutes. WOrked great!

Pretty good chicken parmesan recipe.  I added a dash or two of garlic salt and oregano while browning chicken.  Good staple recipe.  I made cheese garlic biscuits to go with this dish, YUM!!!  Will make again soon!  Thanks Alicia!

Huge hit in my house.  My husband was very impressed at my first attempt at Chicken Parmesan.  I used shredded Mozzerella cheese because I had it on hand.  I found that I had lots of bread crumbs/parmesan left over so I sliced up some zucchini and used it to make fried zucchini to go along with the chicken.

Great and easy recipe. I always look for something fast to fix, and this recipe met my search. I did follow others suggestion of using 1/2 the quantity for the bread crumbs and parmesan. I am glad I did, thus not wasting good ingredients. I had 3 chicken breasts, and since they were quite thick, I thinned them and then cut them in half. I ended up with 6 good pieces of chicken. Using the Marsala Wine (cooking wine) really spiced things up. I also used olive oil instead of the veggie one. Keep it italian! Enjoy the recipe. It's really good! My husband loved it too!!!

I've been making chicken parmesan for years, but the one step I'd left out was the saute.  It makes all the difference in the world!  Another tip is to cut the chicken breasts in half lengthwise using a sharp knife.  This realy stretches the recipe and shortens the amount of time you need to saute the chicken because it's not so thick.

This is not only a simple recipie to follow but a very delicious one as well. I browned the breast in olive oil and finished cooking in the oven like others suggested. I must admitt the left over piece was just as good cold the next day for lunch. Thanks for such a yummy recipie.

I don't usually like chicken with tomatoes or bread crumbs, but I tried this recipe and it was actually really good. I added a few veggies: mushrooms, zuccini, etc. and ate it with some linguini. It was good.

This recipie was wonderful, however, rather than purchase commercial brand dried breadcrumbs it is much better if you have a food processor to put in a couple of slices of bread, mix with oregano, basil, salt, pepper, spices etc and some parmesean cheese.  Also vegeteble cocktain, such as V8 is a great substitute rather than plain tomato juice.

I didn't bread my chicken breasts so I didn't use the eggs, bread crumbs or the parmesan.  I used low fat spaghetti sauce.   It turned out great.  Very easy to make.   Will definitely make again.

This was a great dish!  I made it for a birthday dinner (subs. Mozz for MJ Cheese) and all my friends loved it!  The Birthday girl said it was the best b-day dinner she'd ever had!  I was proud, since I'm a 21 y/o male college student and even I had no problems - very easy to prepare!  I served it with a side of pasta, salad, and garlic bread.

I made it for my hubby 'cause I'm no big fan... but we both loved it!  Hubby wants  me to make it more often and vows never to eat out again.  I used pounded thighs instead of white meat and definitely watch it while it's frying, 'cause if you don't it can burn.  I got mine just in time. GREAT recipe, thanx!

Fantastic.  Halved the breadcrumb mixture and had just enough.  Used olive oil, mozzarella and hunts 4-cheese canned spaghetti sauce.  Heated up extra sauce on the side.  My guests though it was really good.

This recipe was really good.I used provolone cheese. My husband really liked it too.I had a lot of breading left over so I froze it to use for another day. I use all of my breading over again instead of throwing it away...saves a lot of money....but freeze it right away....
Had a lot of leftovers for another day..

This was really good...We did use my husbands homemade pasta sauce that we had freezed so that helped make it delicious.. The chicken had a very good flavor..We served with a big fresh green salad and "Angel's Yummy Bruschetta" (also from this site)...My husband has already requested the same meal again for next week...

Wow!!! This is a keeper. Only thing is you really have to flatten out the chicken. I used a bottle of store bought tomatoe and basil sauce and it was great. Thanks!

This was really good and easy - the only thing is I found that cooking the chicken on medium-high heat for 8-10 minutes almost burned it - so I reduced the heat a little and cooked it for only about 5 minutes per side - then baked it for about 35 minutes - very good!

A great chicken parmesan that is so easy! I added Italian herb seasoning and garlic to the tomato sauce and then spooned it over the breasts before serving. My husband raved and said it was the best chicken parmesan he's ever had.

My entire family loved this recipe and my picky daughter asked for seconds. Our chicken breasts were thick, so I could not completely cook them in the skillet - the crust would burn; so I left them in the oven for 40 minutes and they were perfect and moist. I used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is awesome!!  I made this exactly as the recipe called for except I used Five Brothers, Marinara and Burgundy Wine tomato sauce.  Everyone loves this, (even the 6 year old that only eats Peanut butter and Jelly!!!).

I've used this recipe close to a dozen times now!  It's fabulous with a couple of minor alterations.  I add 1 TBSP Flour to the dry mix (helps hold fragile breading), substitute jack cheese for mozzarella and it's a hit!!  Definitely my favorite recipe in the box.

Wonderful chicken recipe! The second time I made this recipe, I decided to use Hunt's seasoned diced tomato sauce for pasta instead of just plain tomato sauce. This plus mushrooms gave it an extra zing!

Excellant!  I made it GLUTON FREE, replacing bread crumbs with almond flour.  The 10 women I cooked for in my womens group gave it rave reviews.  I improvised on the seasoning , as I often do with recipes.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I used chicken tenderloin, as that's what I had, and it turned out well.  Instead of transferring everything to a different pan to bake, I cooked the chicken on the stove top in an oven-safe pan. After the chicken was cooked, I took out the excess oil left from frying, then added the sauce to the pan, and put it in the oven. I agree with other reviewers not to add the cheese until 5 minutes before removing it from the oven,  and also you probably only need 1 egg.  I used half of a jar of store bought pasta sauce in the chicken and heated the remaining sauce to serve over spaghetti as a side dish.

This Chicken Parm recipe is admirably no-frills. The sort of simple classic that aims to warm the soul rather than seeking to impress. I point this out with respect to the origins of this dish, because what I’m about to suggest may shock future readers. My love of cottage cheese is no secret. I find the combination of its silky rubber texture and mildly salty notes a truly divine expression of human ingenuity. That “melt-in-your-mouth” quality can elevate ANY dish and that’s NOT hyperbole. All this is to say, a 1:1 ratio of Parmesan and cottage cheese takes this recipe to another level. Want to impress the new young neighbors? Influence the mayor to allow for that shed extension despite city zoning codes? Take first place in the Hawthorne middle school Fall Function? Yes to all of the above and more? Then follow my advice and make the chicken coup a cottage.

Flavorful and moist.  I appreciated the suggestions to pound the chicken to an even thickness. I used 4 chicken breasts, cut into 8-9 pieces and had just the right amount of coating  using one egg and halving the parmesan and bread crumbs  as had been suggested.   I also added a little garlic powder to the coating and used mozzarella for the cheese.

yes. It was good but not wonderful. Followed the recipe exactly except for baking the chicken instead of frying. The sauce was thick and heavy but that may be because of the sauce I had bought for another recipe and did not use. I probably will make again using less sauce or a lighter variety.   Judi D

My husband loves this dish.  I do add more sauce because he likes extra sauce.  I also switch up the cheese on top with whatever I have, usually mozzarella.
I pan fry in a large heavy nonstick pan and find I have to cook it on medium, but for the same amount of time.  
Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe!  This is easy and great for company as well.

With a small bit of basil, this chicken is great. With a great deal of tenderness and moisture, this makes the perfect meal. This takes me about an hour to hour 1/2. It costed me 40 bucks. It goes really well with some percitelli pasta. Try your best not to go cheap on this recipe, because some things in this recipe are not very good cheap, ex. Marinara sauce. And use a little extra marinara.

Because I am from Baton Rouge, La. and we like seasoning and spices I seasoned my chicken breast before coating them with the egg & bread crumbs. I also added Italian seasoning to the filleted chicken breast and the bread crumbs. I took the advice of a previous user and baked my cheese (shredded mozzarella, shredded Parmesan, and sliced Colby Jack) only for the last 5 minutes of the 20 minute bake time and it was perfectly melted. I prepared for an 8 serving size and I thought I should’ve used 1 lb & 1/2 of pasta sauce as I paired the meal with fettuccini noodles. More sauce would add a little moisture to the noodles.

Delicious; my picky family all loved it!  For an even quicker version, you can use frozen breaded chicken filets, and skip all the breading & frying time. If you are going to make it from scratch though, the other reviewers are definitely correct about reducint the breadcrumbs & grated parmesan by half; there's simply too much to stick on the chicken.

PS: I always season my spaghetti with a little olive oil & butter, salt and garlic.

I ended up using tenderloins since that’s what I had handy, but my husband said that it tasted as good as something he’d order at a restaurant! I also used mozzarella on top as well.

Love this!!  And will not make the same mistake twice: I breaded the chicken, then put all breasts into the baking dish and covered them with cheese, forgetting to first cook them in the frying pan!!  Aaaahhh!! So, I removed the chicken from the dish, gently lifted the cheese off (best I could), and cooked the breasts.  They blackened! The tomato sauce, etc., not pretty. STILL, they turned out delicious!  Can't wait to try again.  :)

This was very good. Being that I don't really measure much, I threw the coating together and would add more parmesan to it. Also didn't have monterey jack, used white cheddar.  Used chicken thighs also.

yes for some reason it was very bland. & the time given for baking the chicken was not near long enough. I must have had larger pieces of chicken but not sure what to do for adding flavor.

Was very delicious! Tip: just because the chicken breasts are huge you don’t have to change the cooking time at all.

Fabulous "chicken parm".  Scrumptious - my husband loved it.  
I used my homemade sauce with mushrooms.Reviewers were right - refrigerate breaded chicken breast for 30 minutes to keep breading PERFECT when sauteing.  Used  extra cheese - mozzarella and provolone.  Yum!!  Thanks so much.

Looked great but as my husband is Gluten Free he used a Rice flour instead of the bread crumbs and dried spices in the flour.  Was easy and will make this again.

Excellent, pretty easy for a cook who doesn't like to dirty many pans!  Husband thought it was the best chicken parm he's ever had!  I think frying the coated chicken first helped seal in the juices and I did cover the chicken which kept it moist while baking.  I also added some mozzarella to the colby jack and served it with penne pasta.  Delicious:-)

Really really good!! My first time ever making this dish and my husband loved it!! I added a few seasonings to the bread crumbs (totally our preference based on how I normally season baked chicken) and pounded out the chicken breasts to be thinner and used more pasta sauce 24oz (kiddos eating more pasta than chicken) Will definitely make again!!

My BF said "This is what chicken parm should be.  Better than any restaurant."  
I had thinner breasts and so both fried and baked for far less time.
So easy, so good.  It helped that we had a really nice sauce from one of our favorite restaurants.

Made the recipe as directed but used chicken boneless chicken thighs, add salt and pepper and used both grated and shredded Parmesan.  Delicious!  My husband said it was the best chicken parm he'd ever had.  Loved the simple preparation and perfect flavors. Will definitely become a standard favorites in our household

This was fantastic! Took advice from others and cut the breading in half.  Pounded the chicken until it was 3/4 of an inch thick. I also let the chicken rest in the fridge after breading. The taste was great. Chicken was moist and flavorful. Will definitely make again!

Was great, my very picky uncle even ate it. I didn’t have seasoned breadcrumbs so I seasoned them with garlic salt and Italian seasoning. I will probably make this again next time I visit my mothers house. I’m 18 and it was in no way difficult, would recommend for anyone younger and wanting to cook! (:

We loved this! Seasoning is key in this recipe! Good ole salt and pepper do the trick, just make sure you use enough of it!  Season the pasta water too! I used provolone because it's what I could find. Served it with brussel sprouts too.  We will make this again!

This was a delicious meal on top of a bed of angel hair pasta! I added garlic powder and basil to the coating and waited till there was about 6 minutes left in the oven to add mozzarella. Easy recipe to follow and prepare. I'll make it again!

Great recipe and quick! I pounded my chicken breast pretty flat so I did not cook it 8-10 minutes per side - more like 4-5. It finishes cooking in the oven. Also used Mozzarella instead of Monterey Jack. Hubby's new favorite- made twice this week!

This is my go-to chicken recipe that is a total hit with my fiancé. It is a little less involved than other chicken parmesan recipes, so its a good, easy to make dish.

My only advice: pound the chicken filets thin before coating, and after coating the chicken in breadcrumbs let it sit in the fridge for ~30 min -- makes the coating stay on much  better!

I serve this over angel hair pasta, so yummy!

This is so good! It's not exactly quick but it is extremely easy. I used thin-sliced chicken breasts, so I didn't cook quite as long as the recipe said - I fried them for about 8 minutes on each side, and then baked for 15-16 minutes. Like other reviewers, I added the cheese for the last 5 minutes of baking, and used mozzarella. It came out great! I will definitely make this again.

Not bad! I've never made chicken parmesan before, and it was pretty good. There just seemed to be something missing. Maybe more cheese? I'm not sure what it was, but I'll make it again!

Followed the recipe exactly except I used provolone cheese on top of the chicken.  I don't get the rave reviews.  I thought the dish was bland and needed a lot more flavor.  Maybe it was the pasta sauce I used or the cheese?  Even though I pounded my chicken breasts to make them thinner and consistent in size, the chicken still seemed tough.  If I try it again, I'll cut my breasts down to cutlets, spice up the bread crumbs, and choose a different sauce.  I will say the leftovers taste pretty good reheated! Almost better than freshly prepared.

This is a recipe with few ingredients and just a few steps, and yet the return in terms of taste is high. We loved it. The key as with most chicken recipes, is to avoid overcooking the chicken. This is not as easy as it sounds and is best left to trial and error of each individual cook. 

Baking vs. frying, and the thickness of the chicken are big factors in terms of how quickly the chicken is cooked through. Frying for 8 minutes per side will surely come close to burning your chicken, so even if the juices are not running clear, let the chicken finish cooking in the oven and let the browning be your guide; the recipe doesn't seem to account for the oven time and the potential for overcooking the chicken, which can make the dish less than optimum. If frying, I recommend a temperature between medium and medium high. And once you get your golden brown color, take the chicken out of the pan and let it finish cooking in the oven.

My boys loved it!! Added oregano, basil and thyme to the bread crumb mixture; used barillo marinara sauce! Did not put oil into the baking dish just the sauce; Served with penne.

Love this chicken! Easy, delicious and my family loves it. I coat the chicken with the egg and breadcrumb/parm mix then put into the fridge for 30 minutes before sautéing in the olive oil. I find that the breading stays on better this way. I also use mozzarella to top the chicken instead of Monterey Jack. So good!

I baked the breaded chicken instead of pan-frying it as others recommended. It turned out very moist and tender.  I also doubled the amount of pasta sauce and used mozarella cheese.  It turned out wonderfully!

Refrigerated the coated chicken for a half hour as suggested, before frying. Instead of pounding the chicken, I cut the pieces in half, and I only used 4 chicken breasts.  I doubled the pasta sauce and added red pepper flakes quite liberally. Finally, I added the cheese slices in the last 15 minutes of baking. My friends loved it, thank you for the recipe. I would make this again.

The croutons soaked up the moisture in the marinara sauce.  The recipe needs a cup of wine to keep it moist.  Otherwise you could pave a road with it.

Super easy...did the preparation the night prior, as I was pressed for time...assembled it the next morning, stuck it in the oven on a timer...I did cook the chicken slightly longer and covered it with foil once the cheese was starting to brown...served it with spaghetti, garlic bread and Caesar salad as a side...big hit at our house

I thought this was a good, quick recipe.  As suggested by some other reviewers, I did pound my chicken and added a little 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and 1 Tbs. minced onion.  I put all the dry ingredients in a plastic bag and shook the chicken after dipping it in the egg batter.  Make sure your oil is hot before you fry your chicken so it crisps up.

Excellent I didn't have bread crumbs so I crushed some garlic toasties (from the bakery at my grocer). I also made my own sauce in the skillet that I cooked the chicken in. one 28 oz can tomato sauce plus 1/2 cup of water. 1/2 tablespoon each of garlic and onion powder, basil, oregano and sage and 1 teaspoon of salt. Spooned 1/2 the sauce into baking dish, added chicken and spooned more sauce on top and added the cheese. We used the rest of the sauce on the spaghetti

This receipt is amazing!!  My family loved it and my 6-year old ate up her whole plate!  thats rare.  I used Jack cheese that had spices and peppers in it so it kicked it up a bit as well.  I usually tweak all recipes after I've made it the first time - but this one is a keeper as is!  Will most definitely be making this again.

I used Costco chicken breasts and they are way too big.  It took longer to cook and it turned out a bit dry.  Next time I will cut them in half. Otherwise great flavour and easy to put together.

Use a non stick skillet, halve the parm bread mix (add garlic & onion powder), use mozzarella slices, and add it last 5 min of baking. Serve over spaghetti noodles. Perfecto!

Great recipe. Made a few changes: as a general rule, do not skillet / brown chicken, or any other meat, for 8-10 minutes *per side*, that's over cooking it, 3 minutes tops for chicken, especially when you plan on finishing the meat in the oven.  I used eggs, and used Panko, Japanese style bread crumbs by Kikkoman, mixed in Italian herbs and spices. Poured home made tomato sauce on bottom, arranged chicken on top, spread a little mozzarella on top and garnished with fresh parsley. Meat was literally overdone at 20 minutes at 350 degrees. It is best to use a meat thermometer to make sure that you don't overcook the meat. Great recipe otherwise, thank you !

Great recipe! I made my own sauce though and it turned out delicious! Everyone had seconds! I followed a few suggestions, pounding the chicken to an even 1/2in. and adding garlic, onion, and Italian herbs to the breading mix. I would rate this 5 stars however, the breading and egg measurements are way too much! I used the measurements for 8 chicken breasts even though I used 12! Other than that this is the best chicken parmesan I've ever tasted!

Delicious. I had plain bread crumbs which i added basil, oregano, and a bit of garlic salt and pepper to...and used mozzarella cheese. I also cut each chicken breast into 4 long pieces, made it all the better with more deliciously seared and sauced-up surface area. Thank you!

This is so delicious! I'm not usually a fan of a bunch of steps on a weeknight but I'm glad I tried this. I followed the comments and used one egg and about 5oz of bread crumbs. I had three large breasts so I cut it into six and pounded them thin. I only had plain panko bread crumbs so I seasoned it with basil, pink Himalayan sea salt, black pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. I had to bribe my husband so that we could have leftovers.

Will make this again in a heartbeat.  Husband really liked it.  I did add portabella mushrooms and a half bunch of fresh  spinach leaves to the red sauce.  Really really like it and very easy to do.  Would serve at a dinner party.

We loved this. Easy, quick and very good!  I only changed the cheese and marinading. We are used to mozzarella cheese and that's all we had. But no matter, my husband and I made this together . but we were pressed for time so we did not marinade the chicken.  But no problem, it browned up just fine. We loved this and will make it again. For Sure!

Good recipe, and I'll make it again with some changes, but I don't think it's 5 stas as is. I used seasoned bread crumbs but it could have used more herbs for breading.  I made 8 thin-sliced breasts and only needed one egg. Also the thinner meat needed shorter cook time so plan to adjust as needed for your meat.

I did like others. Breaded it then put chicken in fridge for 20min.  I baked the chicken breast for20 minutes then put in a oven dish over egg noodles and poored sauce on top. Baked another 15 minutes. Added cheese baked for 5. Very simple. Good meal.

Yummy in my tummy!  That's what my baby said after eating this. I used chicken tenders, I actually fried them in some canola oil and topped it with mozzarella. I left it in the oven until the mozzarella melted. The chicken was perfectly cooked and full of flavor. Delicious!!!!

This tasted good and was easy to fix.  You can get away with reducing the Parmesan, egg, and bread crumbs by half.  I used a full 24oz jar of pasta sauce as I thought 12oz would not be enough to spoon over the spaghetti.  I did not flatten the breasts as suggested by another reviewer, but will do so next time I fix this.

I've made this twice now and both times have been delicious! The first time I followed exactly only substituting the cheese for provolone. The second time I substituted the cheese for baby Swiss and I also skipped the frying step and baked it instead; I used thinly sliced chicken breasts and  followed the suggestions of others and and let the chicken sit uncovered in the fridge with the breadcrumb mixture (I used Progresso Italian style breadcrumbs) for about 10-15 minutes while the oven was heating up. I then put the sauce on a the bottom of a 2 quart casserole dish, baked it for 20 minutes, and during the last 5-6 minutes, put the cheese on top and it was perfect! My husband said it was so tender and delicious and "the best chicken I ever made"  when I followed the directions for the second time around, so that is how I will make it from now on!

Amazing!! This chicken parm was outstanding. I have been to authentic Italian restaurants, and some still don't top this. You may look at the Monterery Jack cheese and think it's weird, although it adds a new flavor to the chicken parm that is simply amazing. Highly recommend.

just delicious! i pan fried as i like the chicken coating crispy. i used more oil than called for as the chicken would stick to the pan otherwise. i also refrigerated it for several hours and used tuscan herb panko crumbs(from costco). this was an absolute hit in my house.

I use this recipe all the time but make a few changes.  Instead of breadcrumbs I use saltines and add a little flour, a little salt, and a little pepper.  I use provolone cheese on top.

I will likely make this again. It was very simple and pretty good. Medium-high heat was WAY to high for me to cook the chicken. It was already burned after the first 2 minutes. I never would have made it the full 8-10 recommended by the directions. Once I got the heat turned down for the next batch of chicken, it turned out great. Not my family's favorite meal, but I might throw it in the rotation every now and then.

The whole family loved this recipe.  We used Mozzarella since that is all we had, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  YUM! So weird that didn't have to add a ton of seasonings... yet it is soo tasty!

I would make this again.  My grown children really liked it.  Next time, I would use 6 chicken fillets cut thin.  (or buy only 3 breasts and cut in half length-wise).  Even though I pounded out regular chicken breasts, they were still too thick.  Too much thickness.  Not a pleasure to eat and took 30 minutes in the oven instead of 20 min. 

I seasoned regular Planko crumbs.  Next time will try seasoned regular bread crumbs.  I added el-dente sea shell pasta and sauce under the casserole at the end, at the time I added the cheese. 

I used Montery Jack which was good.  Next time I will try with Mozzarella cheese.  Next time I will use 2 jars of sauce.  

Next time, I will serve along with stir fry veggies or steamed broccoli.

Everything about this recipe was amazing! I put it over some spaghetti noodles and added a little extra sauce and it was a huge hit! Even with our pickiest of eaters.

This was great!!! Easy too! For smaller serving I used 2 chicken breasts. Pounded to even out then cut to make 4 pieces.  Used 2 medium sized eggs to double coat all 4 pieces. Followed suggestions to put in the fridge for 30 mins so coating would stick. Fried in olive oil until brown on each side. Put sauce in a 9x13 pan. Also used mozzarella instead of Monterey Jack cheese. Served with spaghetti. Turned out delicious!

Wow this was great!!  I did everything the # 1 reviewer recommended which was really just halving the breading/parmesan mixture, pounding out the chicken, and adding the cheese in the last 5 minutes. I did slightly salt and pepper the chicken breasts before breading and it did not turn out too salty.   Meant to refrigerate the breaded breasts in fridge for a little while to help the breading stick but forgot and it stuck anyway!  Served with pasta.  Loved this!  The breading was THE BEST!

Great recipe and so tasty but I had to make a change because we do not like breaded chicken so just left it off and browned the chicken well on each side and did not overcook it.  
This work fine for us but am sure breading it is the way I will go for company.

It was amazing!  We mixed regular bread crumbs with panko style and I used shredded cheddar cheese instead of parmesan.  I also used mozzarella instead of Monterey Jack!  Awesome sauce!

This is a great chicken recipe! Definitely a family favorite in our house. I add seasonings to the egg mixture to add to the flavor, other than that it doesn't need anything in my opinion.

Best chicken Parmesan recipe ever! My family loved it - even my husband who doesn't love marinara sauce! I used thin, skinless chicken breasts and it was so easy to make. It's requested often for dinner. One tip: make sure you keep an eye on it when it's in the oven so the cheese doesn't burn.

I loved it.  It tasted great someone who does not like a lot of sauce can always adjust it to what they want.  The only reason why there was leftovers was I made a double batch so my DH and myself could take some to work. Also, it was SO easy to make.  I do not like to cook so spending little time in the kitchen is better for me.
I did add a little garlic (we love garlic) and fine chopped onions. But even without that it would be wonderful.

Fantastic with my homemade sauce yet a couple adjustments. Pounded the chicken breasts to 1/2 inch thickness. Refrigerated breaded breasts for 30 min. though next time I will for an hour as some of the breading fell off during frying. Used provolone cheese which I added the final @8 min. of cooking. Served over linguine with extra sauce. Husband who is not an Italian food fan LOVED it. My only concern was the chicken meat itself though very tender needed more flavor.  Next time I will use seasoning salt on chicken before breading. Definitely a keeper for the recipe box.

Hubby and kids loved this meal. Hubby was skeptical at first as I was making it but he said it was good and add it to  the menu.  Only changes I made was marinated the bread crumb mix on chicken for an hour and added garlic salt and onion POWEDER to bread crumb mixture. EXCELLENT

LOVED IT!!! I will take the advice of the others and let the chicken sit in the fridge for 30 minutes or so before I start to fry it up. But is was so juicy. I will be making this one again!

The only thing I didn't like about this recipe was using sliced cheese on top of the chicken breasts, which gave it an unusual look and texture on top.  I made this again using shredded cheese on top and it came out perfect.

This was sooooo good!! The only change I made was to the breading.  I added garlic powder, salt, pepper, and a bit more parmesan cheese to avoid a bland breading.  This was so easy and delicious!! My whole family thoroughly enjoyed this!!

Very nice my first time cooking chicken parm it was lovely, I think next time I might not cook the chicken in the sauce though I liked the crisp coating the chicken got after cooking in the pan. very simple and a good crowd pleaser!

Excellent recipe! The changes I've made were: 
Extra beef (1lb or little extra), fresh basil in addition to dried basil (about 1/4 cup chopped)  instead of using canned tomatoes I used fresh chopped Roma & Vine (tomato sauce made fresh is amazing), also more garlic, used authentic Italian ricotta and mozzarella.

This recipe is simply, i like it. Even my picky husband loved it. I did do minor changes. I sliced the chicken breasts in half instead of pounding it, I let it sit in the fridge for 20 min after coating it (whole wheat bread crumbs) and baked it instead of frying. The taste is amazing and its so quick and easy to make. This will be going in our rotation. You really only need 1 egg if you have 6 pieces of chicken. Thank you for posting

Made this almost exactly as written. The only change I made was with the cooking times and the cheese. I placed it in the oven for 25 minutes, took it out, added the cheese, and placed it back in the oven for another 5 minutes. Came out perfect!

This is one of my favorite weeknight recipes because it's so easy and delicious. My husband and I eat grain free, so I mix the parmesan with tapioca flour instead of regular flour, and they still turn out amazing!

This has been my favorite recipe thus far! I couldn’t get any Monterey Jack cheese so I replaced it with Pepper Jack. I pounded out the chicken so it was very thin and just came apart. Needless to say… there was no left overs!

We loved this! Easy, too! Definitely pound down the chicken to a thinner size. I baked it for about 20 min (10 min per side) then put it together in the dish with the sauce. I added provolone & 4-cheese blend for the last 5 minutes. I removed the chicken to plates, tossed pasta in with the sauce and served it on the side of the chicken. The whole family loved it!

I needed a lot more oil to keep the chicken from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Otherwise an amazing dinner. We added provolone cheese as well.

Very simple and delicious recipe. My boyfriend asks me to make spaghetti at least twice a month, which is tiresome for my tastebuds so I am trying to mix things up a bit with different pasta dishes. He absolutely loved the chicken parmesan, I dare say more than my spaghetti!

We loved this!  I did flatten the chicken and cut it in smaller pieces before coating and sauteing. It wasn't all done at that point, but it was once I baked it for 20 minutes.  I did sprinkle it with shredded mozzarella cheese and put it back in for the last 5 minutes, also, rather than baking it with cheese for the full 20 minutes.

Added some lemon pepper to the chicken and Italian seasonings and garlic powder to the bread/cheese. Also topped with Mozzarella, since that is what I had. Great recipe. Thank you so much.

I made this on Thursday and it was just perfect. I seasoned the chicken a bit before breading it, and I added a bit of seasoning to the breaded mix as well. Overall I was very much impressed with the succulence of the chicken, which I garnished with parsley. For the side, I used Penne. Since there was excess pasta sauce with the chicken, I added it to the Penne after using a cream cheese mix. Def going to be using more recipes from here. Thanks!

This was a hit even though I used the wrong ingredient and didn't think that it was going to come out at all.  Make sure to use GRATED parmesan like the recipe calls for.  I tried using shredded parmesan since that's what I had in my frig. and the bread crumbs and cheese came right off while I pan fried them.  I ended up just browning both sides, then finishing them off in the oven in the sauce, checking every 5-7 minutes until it was done.  I think that it took about 20-30 minutes. Thank goodness for seasoning it before I put it in the egg/parmesan&bread crumb mixture otherwise it might not have any flavor.  My kids loved it and commented on how I should have made more!  The chicken was definitely moist and delicious. I'll definitely try it again using grated parmesan. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

My family loved it - even my picky 1 & 2 year olds!  The changes I made to this recipe is that instead of egg, I coated the chicken with Olive Garden creamy italian dressing purchased from Sam's Club.  I also added freshly grated Asiago and Romano cheese because the whole family are cheese freaks.  After coating in dressing then adding my cheese, I smothered the top of the chicken breasts in panko crumbs and placed in my toaster oven for 20 minutes at 350. I never bread the bottom of anything since it tends to get soggy and it saves on calories.  After 20 minutes in the toaster oven, I covered the bottom of another pyrex dish in pasta sauce, then placed the chicken breasts on top of that, then added another thin layer of sauce then cheese again.  Popped it back into the toaster oven for another 15 minutes and served with a green salad and freshly sauteed veggies.  This is a wonderful recipe to use as a base then alter to meet your families' taste.

This was great! I did bake it instead of frying, to make it healthier. I added mozzarella and provolone cheese in the last 5-10 minutes, because I wanted gooey cheese, not burnt. I have picky kids, and they LOVED this! This recipe will definitely be going into dinner rotation.

This was very good. I cooked six chicken breast (pounded them thin) and only used half the parmesan/bread crumbs mix. It definitely needs more than 12 ounces of sauce.

This was an exceptional recipe!  My husband is usually pretty noncommittal about his meals (everyone else says I'm a good cook!)but his remark was that this was better than his favorite Italian restaurant,  good!  The only thing I changed was to use Panko instead of bread crumbs and double dipped in those and the egg. Coating stayed on and remained crispy so this is my permanent chicken parm recipe...thanks so much!

My go-to for a family gathering.  I usually use Prego Traditional sauce (the big plastic jar).  Be sure to pound out the chicken, makes it perfectly moist!

I don't usually follow recipes exactly but this time I gave it a try and it came out delicious! My family truly enjoyed it, I think this is the best chicken parm I've ever had! Only thing I changed was add a bit of water to the pan when cooking the chicken just to soften it up... It comes out juicier that way. I never made it with Monterey cheese, neither do i like it much so I made some with fresh mozzarella and some with Monterey and Both were excellent!

This dish was delicious! I double breaded the chicken so you'll need 4 eggs and double the breading mixture. I also used a meat tenderizer to make the chicken an even half inch thick and generously garlic salted the top of the chicken after it was done baking. I served it with angel hair pasta and garlic bread. My whole family loved it!

This was very good...cheaper and better than something like Olive Garden. I seasoned plain breadcrumbs w italian seasonings, garlic & fresh parmesan cheese,used mozzerella on top & made my own pasta sauce- homemade pasta sauce is key to any great italian dish on this site!So easy: 1 can italian tomato sauce, 1 can paste w/garlic & 1 can italian diced tomatoes-- makes the dish!

Perfect. Followed the tips by the other reviewers (pounded chicken, cut bread mix in half and melted cheese for 5 mins). Used all the ingredients it called for.  Yummy. Will do again.

I gave this 5 stars because it was so easy and delicious, didnt have bread crumbs but used some croutons that I crushed, added seasoning that is usually for dipping oil, also replaced spaghetti sauce with vodka sauce from Aldi's, and provolone cheese,since thats what was available, easy and delicious!!!!

This is the very best chicken parm I have ever made! Followed the recipe exactly as written and couldn't make it any better than it already is. My husband and son love it!!! So easy and quick to make. A little sauce and pasta on the side, salad and some garlic bread, you have a wonderful Italian meal!!!

This turned out just great! I used bone-in opposed to boneless. I left it left in the fridge with the eggwash/breading like many of the others, and baked it in the oven instead of frying it. And made whole wheat linguine as a side yum yum! :)

Good recipe...my husband loved it. I used plain tomato sauce; I think I'll use a flavored sauce next time.

I used mozzarella cheese instead of monterey jack, putting the cheese on top five minutes before the end of the baking time so the cheese wouldn't burn. I had a bunch of bread crumbs/cheese left over, so I recommend starting with less and then adding as needed.

10 star dish!  Made this last week and my wife absolutely crushed it.  The only thing I changed was I added about 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper to the tomato mixture/sauce because I like just a little bite.  This recipe is an absolutely keeper.  The wife asked me to add this one to the normal rotation.

This was fabulous and delicious! I can't believe I had been going to restaurants and paying $12-$15 for this meal! Never again! I made my own seasoned bread crumbs (because I only had plain in the house) and my parmesan cheese was a garlic/herb blend. My secret to baking chicken breast is fileting it so it's 1/2" thick; it cuts down cooking/baking time considerably. I did follow other recommendations and used motzzarella cheese. I put extra sauce on top of chicken and then cheese on for last 15 minutes, baked for a total of about 20 minutes (prior to seared on stove for about 4-5 minutes). Thank you for the recipe!

It's a top recipe when you add some seasoning in the mix, for 250 gm chicken my dipping mix was as follows (4 tbsp bread crumbs, 4 tbsp grated Parmigiano reggiano,1 tsp onion powder,1 tsp garlic powder,1 tsp dried thyme,1 tsp paprika,1/2 tsp salt), when i used the original dipping mix it was way too bland.

Very good and simple too!  Rather than frying, I baked the chicken with the coating on at 425 for about 20 minutes.  Then I added the sauce and cheese (used Mozzarella) and baked for a little over 5 more minutes.  I also used Italian breadcrumbs.  Great quick and easy dinner!

I just made this for me and my boyfriend and it turned out great! We don't have an oven at the hotel we are staying so I had to rely on using only the stove, but it still worked out pretty well.  Instead of using Montery Jack cheese, i topped it off with Emental cheese and it was amazing.  Thanks for the great recipe!! Will be making this again! :)

Very good! I am on a diet so I made it with a salad instead of over pasta and it was delicious. I also used shredded Mozzarella instead of Monterey Jack and Olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Great filling meal!

Turned out delicious. Made three pans for my sister's birthday and we finished it off completely. I would suggest making your own bread crumbs....easy, cheap and homemade is always better anyway. That's what I did.

Our family all LOVED it and so did our neighbors we had over for dinner!  I followed other reviews and flattened chicken to a more uniform thickness and also baked instead of frying.  EASY recipe and now a family favorite!

We loved this recipe.  I tweeked it a little by tossing my cooked pasta in 1/2 jar of alfredo (would be awesome with my own alfredo recipe but time was an issue) Everything else worked perfectly.  Used Mozzorella and cooked until golden brown and bubbly.  I was sad there werent more leftovers.   Huge Hit.  Highly Recommend...

After reading pages and pages of reviews I went ahead and follow the advice of others:  first off, I added some salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and parsley to my Italian breadcrumb/  parmesan cheese mixture.  I've been cooked my chicken for 20 to 25 minutes on a baking sheet in the preheated oven, making sure to spray nonstick spray on the pan first.  The other change was that I used mozzarella cheese  and put on the slices approximately 5 to 7 minutes before the entire recipe was done cooking.  Hubby really liked this recipe, so thank you so much !!

Ph-Nominal! I changed the meat up. Used Grouse and Pork, but other than that...I made it as the recipe is written (maybe a little extra cheese). Will use over and over again.

Very tasty.  My breading stuck in the pan but I think that was my fault more than the recipe's.  Next time I'll try baking the breading on as another review suggested.

It's so tasty and easy! Especially wonderful if you make your own sauce. You don't really need two eggs, though. I had a ton left over; one would have sufficed. Also, I subbed fresh shredded Parmesan for the slices of Monterey Jack.

This recipe is very good, just make sure you spray the skillet with cooking spray before you cook the chicken. Even if you chill the chicken it still sticks and comes apart.

This was great!! The combination of pan frying and then baking seemed to make the chicken very tender. I have made with a couple different kinds of cheese, I just use whatever I have on hand, and it always turns out great! I like regular, unflavored bread crumbs best, I always feel like the flavored ones have a funny taste.

If you take a meat pounder to the chicken, the cooking time in the pan is much less. haha I found that out the hard way the first time.

So Very Yummy! I did make a few twists of my own, I used pepperjack slices, instead of Monterey.  I add a dash of milk to my one egg and I took others' advice on refrigerating the meat while it was coated with crumbs in a gallon zip lock.  Also my Boyfriend Loves Cheese, and Romano is his favorite, so I loaded the top with it, while cooking and then again when it was done.

My friend invited me over for lunch yesterday and this is what she had made. It was fabulous! I asked her for the recipe and she directed me to this site. Needless to say, I'll be making this for my family. Her tips included using what tomato sauce you prefer (I'd say not chunky) and less bread crumbs. The chicken was very tender. She told me to put the breasts in a zip lock bag and beat them with a rolling pin, making them all a little thinner. Hope this helps! Yum!!!

This was really good and so easy. I would recommend using only half the parmesan / breadcrumb mixture to coat the chicken with as I had a LOT left over after breading my chicken. (so a lot got wasted!) Sauteeing the chicken for 8 to 10 minutes on each side over med. high heat was too long! Mine were getting burned (even after turning the heat to med.), so I heated just until the breading was golden brown and left in the oven longer (about 35 - 40 min) so that the chicken cooked through. I used almost a whole jar (24 oz.) of Newman's Own tomato basil bombolina sauce (so good!) and put really thick slices of montery jack cheese on the chicken. It turned out great. I served this with mashed potatoes per my daughters request and it was yummy. I will make again.

Easy to prepare!! I used the Italian style bread crumbs (generic brand), beat my chicken out some before coating, baked it in the oven for 20 minutes (flipping half way through) instead of frying, and put some pasta sauce on top of the chicken as well as additional parm. cheese. It was delicious!! I have made this recipe before, but with frying the chicken instead, and I can honestly say it was much better not fried. Mixing the parm. cheese with the bread crumbs makes it sooooo wonderful!!

Delicious and so simple to make.  If you've ever made chicken parmesan then this is basically the same thing, with a few simple extra details. The chicken came out juicy and flavorful (I did marinate the chicken breast before hand though, to make sure it had lots of flavor).  Couldn't ask for anything better. Quick, easy, good!

This recipe is awesome. I only changed the monterey jack cheese to fresh mozzarella slice to melt on top. Everytime I have made this people love it! I always serve it with angel hair pasta & my favorite homemade garlic bread. Fantastic!

It was a great recipe! Definitely don't preheat the oven first if you are doing everything from the beginning. Preheat it when you start browning the chicken in the pan. This will be made in our house forever from now on...thanks!

Tasted great, but the texture was not crunchy like we prefer. Next time I will pan fry and omit the oven baking.

Let me just say my fiance finished his plate (with pasta and broccoli) in less than 5 minutes.  I too didn't  pan fry but baked the chicken breasts for 20 minutes.  Also I borrowed the idea from another recipe and spread a thin layer of mayo on the chicken in lieu of using eggs.  Lastly, I marinated the chicken with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, parprika and a little canjun spice and let them sit in the fridge overnight before cooking.

LOVED this! It was VERY easy to make! My boyfriend inhaled it within minutes! We used 100% all natural fresh mozzarella cheese instead of monterey jack and we also used all natural fresh ingredients for the sauce! Fabulous! Can't wait to make it again!

This was very yummy. I took other people's advice and baked the chicken for 20 minutes before putting the sauce down and baking another 25 minutes, then put cheese on top for another 5 minutes. I also put some of the sauce in the bottom of the pan on the chicken before putting the cheese down. All in all a very good dinner!

I rated this recipe 4 stars, but will preface by saying that I made a lot of revisions. I thought it was a great base recipe, but wanted to add some additional flavour. I wanted to share the modifications and therefore had to rate the recipe.   Modifications: I added basil, oregano, parsley, salt and garlic pepper to the parmesan/bread crumb mixture. I also put chopped garlic in the beaten eggs. I didn't fry the chicken. Instead I put the chicken in the oven without cheese topping and pasta sauce for 14 minutes to make the breading crispy.  I then created my own pasta sauce, put it in a glass baking dish, placed the breaded chicken on top, topped the chicken with cheese and baked an additional 10 minutes. It turned out great and my husband loved it :)

This was a very easy and very tasty recipe.  The only thing I did different was to marinade the chicken in the juice from a tin of peaches in light syrup for a couple of hours in the fridge first just to give the chicken itself a little sweet kick and extra moisture

This was a great recipe.  Nice and simple, I added some fresh parsley to the bread crumb mixture and used a simple tomato & basil sauce and it came out great.  Sometimes less is better.  My boyfriend said this was the best chicken parmesan I’ve made, possibly the best he’s had.

This recipe was absolutely excellent!! I had a dinner party and everyone loved it!!! I made a few changes and worked with what I had. The changes I made. I did not have parmesan cheese so I used a Colby mix. I mixed the Italian bread crumbs, Colby mix cheese, garlic powder, onion powder, and basil. After breading the chicken, I placed it in the refrigerator for 1 hour. The coating sticks much better. Instead of frying with oil, I baked it for 20 minutes. I put a layer of sauce in bottom of pan, added the chicken, and topped with additional sauce and baked for 20 minutes. I added a slice of pepper jack cheese the last 5 minutes. They turned out great and everyone enjoyed!!

Absolutely fantastic!!!  My husband loved it so much that I made it for guests the following week...and they loved it even more than he did.  I changed the vegetable oil to olive oil.  However, the recipe is perfectly delicious as is.

I made this for my family and nobody like it. I followed the recipe exactly and the smell coming from the oven was heavenly! But there is something about soggy breaded chicken that non of us enjoy... Oh well we will move on to better chicken recipes. I haven't found many things on this site we havent enjoyed.

This is how I always make my chicken parmesan, but (like rae) I also don't cook it all the way through in the frying pan, just enough to brown it on both sides (so it doesn't over-cook in the oven).  Like others, I use mozzarella (or provalone) cheese. This is a wonderful chicken recipe and one of my favorite dinners! :)

I also put sauce on the top of the chicken, but used Mozzarella cheese, and a little shaved Parmesan instead of Monterey Jack.  I then layered this on spaghetti and baked it in the oven for about 10 minutes to warm it all together. The chicken was tender and juicy!

We really enjoyed this recipe. Make sure you pound the chicken breasts to about 1/2 inch so they cook even. That is the most important step.

This was delicious! I cut a large chicken breast into 4 pieces and used about 2/3 Italian style bread crumbs and 1/3 Panko (plus some Parmesan)...I also topped with shredded Mozzarella. Yummy! Just like at a restaurant, take that Bucca!

Excellent! I cooked the chicken in the oven because it seemed easier and it turned out great! I didn't use the eggs and the bread crumb mixture stuck well. I will be making this again!

I love this recipe! I followed it almost exactly, except I cut the chicken breasts width wise so that they were restaurant-style thin. This decreased the sauteeing time by half. I did, however, use olive oil in place of vegetable oil. The dish was delicious and my very picky husband loved it!

Baking this before adding the sauce was perfect...chicken came out nice and moist.  I added some Italian seasonings to the breadcrumbs (basil, oregano, garlic) along with the parmesan cheese.  Topped it with a slice of Provolone for the last 5 minutes in the oven.  Made a lot and had leftovers...delicious.

Simmered 1 can of Hunts spag sauce, bay leaf, fresh chopped garlic, chopped onion, sliced mush. Dried hot pepper (because we like spicy), black & white pepper, onion & garlic powder for 2 hr. Added parm cheese, garlic & onion powder to Italian bread crumbs (eyeball it). I coated 3 LG chicken breasts & baked on rack at 350 for 20 min. I then layered some sauce, chicken, rest of sauce on top of chicken in baking dish & baked for 20 min. Topped with pepperjack cheese & put under broiler until golden. VERY FLAVORFUL & MOIST!! Served with angel hair pasta. I did not follow recipe exactly. But gave me something to start with. I now have something new for dinner & will be making this monthly. Thanks!

This was YUMMY!!! I normally do not like chicken breast, but I had it at the house and had to use it up. The chicken came out so tender and moist. The key is to let is cook for about 6-8 minutes on each side (depending on thickness, I didn't pound it) WITHOUT moving it around. I put it in and didn't come back to touch it until 8 minutes was up. If you move it around in the pan while it's cooking, it will lose heat penetration and will never cook through. My husband who does not enjoy Italian dishes and/or chicken breast, loved it. He said it was by far the best Italian dish he has EVER had. Only reason I gave it 4 stars was because next time I make this, I'll make my own pasta sauce. When you pour straight out of a pre-made jar the pasta sauce tastes so bland. I'll add onions, green peppers, garlic, etc. to enhance my sauce next time around. Thanks for sharing, this is a keeper!

Delicious!   I double breaded the chicken breasts and when I cooked in the oil they were so thick that they did not cook through.  So what I ended up doing was increasing the cook time in the oven to 30 minutes.  I like others, added the cheese to the chicken the last 10 minutes.  I used shredded mozzarella.  This was fantastic!  We all loved it! A real keeper!

Very easy to make! I would suggest to double dip into the bread crumbs and put half the cheese on for the last ten minutes than add the rest after five mintues. Overall very good and will make again!!!!

Awesome!!!  I was also pleased that I was able to bread and fry the chicken before going to work, allow to cool and then store in the fridge.  When I returned in the evening, we assembled the dish with the sauce and cheese, popped it in the oven for 30 minutes, and dinner was served.  Thank you for this great recipe.

Not my favorite recipe but still good. Surprisingly it tasted better after being in the fridge overnight than it did when it was fresh out of the oven

This was very good.  I made the mistake of having the skillet up to high so the breading browned a little too much but I will fix that next time, I will also butterfly the breast  b/c I think they were too thick but the breading was really tasty, I did add Garlic powder & red pepper flakes and it was very good!

Excellent recipe!  I agree with another reviewer that you can use one egg and half the bread crumb mixture.  I added some sauteed mushrooms to the sauce.  The entire family loved it!

Fantastic! I did all as above but used marble cheese instead of the Jack cheese.  Placed chicken in fridge after breading and used the George Foreman grill (why add the added fat of oil?) as suggested, and came out far beyond delicious!  Boyfriend & mother in law approved :)!

WOW this was delicious!  I didn't change anything but used egg whites in the egg bath.  My husband loves chicken parm and he scarfed it down, saying it was the best he had ever had!  5 stars for sure!!

We love this recipe! It is more time consuming than what it says, but well worth it! I cook this about once a week! Instead of using the sliced monterey jack, I use shredded mozarella. We are cheese eaters and the shredded melts quicker and I can use more of it.

Really yummy flavor.  I would suggest flattening the chicken breasts with a mallet first to serve them restaurant-style.  The breading was not very crispy, though.  Maybe next time I'll use less sauce???  Will make again.

Great recipe! Instead of using pasta sauce, I used tomato sauce mixed with some oregano, garlic powder, basil and a little sugar to cut the acidity. Yummo!

Very good except the breading never got crispy. I baked in the oven without sauce. I'll try again frying next time to see if that helps.The chicken was very moist.

Made this tonight for dinner and it was a hit. I used croutons that my husband smashed for me mixed with Ritz Crackers for my bread crumbs. I live overseas and was unable to find bread crumbs. I added garlic and pepper to the bread crumbs, parmesan cheese mixture. I also seasoned my chicken prior to coating with the egg. As another person stated one egg would have been sufficient as I ended up throwing egg away. I too used Mozzarella Cheese instead of the Monterey Jack and sided with whole wheat pasta. I used about a jar and a half of regular ole ragu....after taking out the oven i sprinked shredded parmesan across the chicken. It was FABULOUS and easy. I have made eggplant parmesan and this was my first experience with chicken parmesan and I will be making this again.

This has become a staple for us.  So simple to make!  I tend to put sauce in pan, place chicken on top, more sauce, then Mozzarella cheese, topped by the rest of the jar of sauce.  Served over whole grain spaghetti! Very filling dinner.  Thanks!

Excellent chicken parmesan!! The flavor was outstanding. My chicken breasts were a little thick, so I would suggest pounding them thinner so they all cook evenly. I ended up having to cover mine, as there were still pink spots in the thicker breasts, which caused the breading to get soggy. I'll definately make these again & again!!

Tasty and delicious...I did pound them a bit before hand like another reviewer suggested..and next time I will refridgerate them a little after breading them because I did have some difficulty with the breading coming off during the frying process.

Mine burnt. I think on medium high its a bit much. It was burnt on the outside but uncooked on the inside. Maybe the thickness of the breasts should be stated.

Very good, might add some garlic and more seasonings basil, oregeno to the bread crumbs even though I used italian seasoned crumbs. Used mozzarella cheese because that is what I had, and Prego traditional sauce instead of home made. Pretty tasty.

This was pretty good.  Next time I make it I'll add a little more spices to the bread crumbs and use the thin chicken tenderloins because the chicken breast halves were too thick and the breadcrumbs tried to overcook a little.

That was my first chicken parmesan I made and it turned out perfect! As mentioned in other reviews I also poured some pasta sauce over the chicken and sprinkled parmesan cheese on top of it. The chicken was so tender. It was unbelievable! Thanks for the great recipe!

ok so the only reason i tried this recipe was because of the picture. it made it look very appetizing. normally i do NOT like chicken parm. i think it tastes like dog food, but this recipe is AMAZING!!! i was totally shocked and so happy it turned out wonderful. the ONLY thing i did different was use mozzarella cheese instead of pepper jack. this is a definite recipe for the books.

Delicious! Easy to make (I've never made chicken parmesan before and this recipe made it simple!) It was pretty inexpensive to make and very tasty! I think it will become a meal I make often!

Wow!  This turned out so good.  Only difference I did was use mozzerella.  One thing to note - doesn't make the best of leftovers.  Much better the first night eaten.  Defenitely a keeper!

Definitely a good recipe.  I really liked the idea of the Mont. Jack cheese......I wouldn't have picked it otherwise.   I think with a good sauce and maybe a few tweaks I will make this 5 star!  Thanks for a good dinner recipe!

This is a great recipe! Like others, I baked the chicken and it was still great. Make sure to pound the chicken to an even thickness. Thanks for sharing the recipe! We loved it!

This was soo yummy!! I followed the recipe mostly the way it was with a few minor changes. First off I used veal instead of chicken, I sprinkled shredded monery jack cheese because I didn't have sliced on hand. And lastly I skipped the frying method completley to make it a little healthier. I served it over spagetti & it was GREAT!!! My hubby & I enjoyed ourselves! Will definatley be making this one again :)

Very good recipe. I used two chicken breasts, beaten thin, and halved the rest of the recipe. I used panko crumbs in place of bread crumbs and seasoned the mix with 1/2 tsp each basil, oregano, onion powder and garlic powder. Next time I will add 1 tsp course kosher salt or 1/2 tsp regular salt. I baked the chicken for 15 minutes at 350, then put them on sauce, cooked for 10 minutes at 375 and then added the cheese and cooked for 5 minutes more. I served this with angel hair pasta and sauce.

Definitely a keeper! Followed instructions as is except subbed pepper jack for monterey cheese. Used Barilla Tomato & Basil Sauce and served with buttered thin spaghetti and steamed veggies.  Next time will use 1/2 of cheese/bread crumb mixture as I ended up throwing out a lot.  Also from other reviews, I may try sauteing chicken in garlic and adding mozzarella last 5 minutes of cooking.

Give yourself more prep time for this meal. It's worth it. I made my own sauce. Next time I will make sure to make more sauce and just lightly mix it in with my noodles on the side.

Fantastic.  The only things I changed were I sauted the breaded chicken in olive oil with 2 cloves of garlic - chopped (I LOVE GARLIC!).  Also, instead of monterey jack cheese I used mozzerella cheese and then sprinkled parmesan cheese on top of that along with some black pepper.  Great "go-to"recipe and very easy to make.

I wish i read the other reviews first.  i usually do, but i was in a rush, and didn't.  i would have put the breaded chicken in the fridge first, and then i would have bake in the over versus frying in the pan.  it just burned.  i don't know what my husband did, but he stepped in and saved the meal.  i did catch a review to add the cheese at the end, so i did, thankfully.  other than the issues i had, the meal was great.  i would make it again with the suggestions.

The coating for this chicken was great. Really tasty and easy. I thought the tomato sauce really overpowered the taste of the parmesan unfortunately. I will probably make this again, but without the tomato sauce.

Very easy to make!  I double coated the chicken and baked it instead of frying it. I baked the chicken by itself for 20 then put it on top of the sauce with cheese on top and baked for another 30 minutes.

Give this one 4 stars for being fast and easy to prepare.  A little short on taste though, but that could have been from my choice of pasta sauce. Add Italian Seasoning to the bread crumb mixture for extra flavour.

This is great recipe. I agree that for best results you should filet the chicken breast for half the thickness -- just reduce cooking time by a few minutes also.  Use a ready-made Italian flavored bread crumb OR make your own with Italian herbs and a little salt.  NEVER use Swiss or cheddar -- always mozzarella! This is Italian.

This recipe is so easy to make, and really tastes pretty good in a pinch. I've definitely had tastier Chicken Parmesean in my day, but this gets points for the ability to have it ready in half an hour. I altered only the cook time in the oven. Set it to broil, and let the cheese melt for 4-5 min. (The red sauce was already hot.) We enjoyed a nice meal without a lot of fuss.

This was delicious. In the egg and parm mixture I had to add salt, pepper and italian seasoning before dipping them in "panko" crumbs.

Wow!  This was delicious!  I followed another poster's advice and only dirtied one dish (brown in skillet and then finish cooking until no longer pink; deglaze pan with pasta sauce and then simmer) but I was a little disappointed that the outside got soggy.  Next time I will follow the recipe 100%.  Nonetheless this was well received by all and I'm already looking forward to making it again.  Yum!

I have never cooked chicken on my own but this recipe was super easy and tasted so good. I used swiss cheese to melt on top and i baked the chicken for 25 minutes after semi-frying it.

I love the taste of this recipe. Very easy to put together. I did have some problems with the batter sticking in the pan but I think with the addition of more oil it would help (or I could just bake it next time) I love this with some pasta on the side.

Very good! I used the suggestions of other reviewers and used chicken tenders and baked the chicken instead of frying on the pan. I also seasoned the bread crumb and parmesan mixture with salt pepper, and garlic powder.

This was average to me.  The chicken was bland, it would definitely help to add some spices, or at least salt & pepper before adding the bread crumbs.  Or even better - marinade the chicken.  The cheese on top was a good addition but not enough to save the overall taste.  My kids didn't like it and my husband gave it a 6 out of 10.  But our family likes very tasty meals. If I make it again, I'll definitely marinade the chicken and work with the crust, to get a crispier texture.

This recipe was absolutely delish!!!!  I scale down some of the ingredients, as recommended by other reviewers.  Thus, I only used one egg, 1/2 cup Romano cheese, (purchased from a local Italian food store..it's the best), and 1/2 the amount of seasoned bread crumbs.  It was plenty with some even left over.  I used olive oil vs. veggie oil and used 16 oz. of my homemade Italian sauce. I used provolone cheese slices because that's what I had at home.  I followed the cooking instructions as is and it came out so tender with an excellent flavor. My hubby was impressed.  It really seems to melt in your mouth:)

Fantastic dinner!  Pounding the chicken is a must, and leaves them sooo tender.  I also halved the parm mixture, and it was plenty.  Also added garlic and onion powder, which I do to most dinners.  Everyone was very impressed, including me!  Thanks.

This was a good dinner!  I halved the eggs and breading mixture, still had plenty left.  I added italian seasoning to the breading mixture and used olive oil to fry the chicken in. Used 2 cups of my homemade sauce to the 9x11 pan.  Baked without cheese for the first 10 minutes then added mozzerella for another 5.  Boiled up some pasta and viola!!  We will be using this recipe again:)

This is so good!  As good or better than any Chicken Parm I've had in any restaurant.  It's so juicy and so simple.  As several reviewers said, be sure to pound the chicken to an even thickness.   
Also, it really does make a difference how good the sauce you use is.  Make sure the sauce is flavorful and this is a sure bet.  Left overs were good the next day, too.

This was a very good recipe. I did take the suggestions of others, and here is what I did: 1- I used chicken tenders and marinated them overnight in olive oil and Italian seasoning. 2- I cut the breadcrumb/Parmesan cheese mixture in half and only used one egg. 3- I did not pan fry before baking, I added melted butter to the breadcrumb mixture before coating the chicken. 4- I baked for 30 min (350*), then topped w/ mozz cheese for the last 5 min and broiled until the breading and cheese were golden. This resulted in a crispy crust w/o needing to pan fry. I recommend this recipe and will make it again.

This was alot like a erecipe I got from watching Rachel Ray. I did pound the chicken down, other than that I didn't change a thing. My fiance' loved this and asks for it often. A great, easy delicious recipe. You can't go wrong with this one.

This recipe is absolutely the best!  The only suggestion i would make is to add more pasta sauce to the recipe if you want to use some sauce to put over noodles.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and put about 3/4 of the sauce on the bottom of the pan and the rest over the chicken once it's in the pan.  Then i put the cheese on top. (i used mozzarella to better suite our tastes!)  Very yummy!

Absolutely tasty and the best Chicken Parmesan I have ever had!  I pounded my chicken before breading them to make them cook more evenly.  I served over pasta.  Very good meal!

Very tasty! I added some garlic & salt to give it additional flavor & used mozz. cheese instead. Serving over pasta makes a great meal. I'm going to try baking my chicken instead of frying to be healthier & quicker. YUMMY!

This is by far the best Chicken Parmesan I have ever had!! I made my own breadcrumbs and added plenty freshly ground pepper as well as Italian Seasoning. Commercial bread crumbs scare me with all the additives. I pounded the chicken before seasoning and frying which I find to be very important! I used a sun dried tomato sauce (Classico) and topped with Monterey Jack cheese the last five minutes in the oven. Don't put the cheese on for the full twenty minutes! Mmmmmm, the chicken was so flavorful and juicy. Will most certainly make this again and again! Thanks for the recipe!

My daughter requested this recipe. It was very, very good! The only thing I changed was the type of cheese (what I had on hand). I will make this again!

wonderful chicken.  though i followed the heat setting recommended, my chicken browned too quickly to allow it to fry for 20 minutes... so, when it was browned both sides, i put in oven early.  delicious!

Fantastic!  My hubby made it for dinner and declared he liked it so much he would make that instead of spaghetti! (an almost weekly staple in our house)
The chicken was so juicy and tender even my 20 month old ate a little of it.

This is great! However, I think next time I'll marinate the chicken and use less crumb/cheese mixture since I had tons left over. Thanks for sharing!

This did not live up to what I was expecting from the reviews.  I don't think I'll try this recipe again.  I've seen chicken parmesan recipes where the chicken is pounded thin.  I should have done that for this recipe.

This was fabulous! I used crushed saltines and added some garlic powder, pepper, oregano & basil to them. I also used a homemade pasta sauce & since I didn't have montery, I subtituted with mozza. Still turned out wonderful.

Wow, great! Only thing I had to change was the oil.  No way  was 1 Tablespoon of oil enough. I had three chicken breasts so cut them in half and pounded them so they were equal in thickness. Browned them in my electric frying pan, then put in the oven for about ten minutes.  I served with angel hair pasta with a pasta sauce from a jar.  Any pasta sauce would taste good with this recipe. It is a keeper for sure. Oh... I had enough egg (that I mixed with a little milk) and crumbs left to double dip some of the pieces. I would  cut the crumb mixture in half. I really had to toss a lot of it.  I've made it twice now and  would like to have it very often. more.  In fact, I never raid the refrigerator, but I did for this. The second time I made it with  Best Marinara , from this website.Yummy

My husband and kids went crazy for this dish! I, however, thought it was just a *little* too bland. Good, but not great. I followed the directions exactly, didn't change a thing. I will definitely make it again, but I'll just add more seasoning/sauce for more of a kick.

Really good. I used very thin chicken breasts (like veal cutlets) to reduce cooking time. Will become a favorite.

Quite possibly the best meal I have ever made! I followed the recipe exactly and it was faaabulous. I was going to substitute the jack cheese for mozzerella, but I didn't and I'm glad I didn't.

My family loved this recipe, despite the fact that, instead of the montery jack slices, I substituted a pre-grated italian cheese mix which didn't melt well. It tasted fine, just didn't look as nice. Next time I'll try the montery jack. And the only other change I might make would be to pound the breasts between wax paper so they're thinner.

Very simple and delicious recipe.  I also used "The Best Marinara Sauce" recipe from this site.  I added  a 1/2 tsp of salt to the beaten eggs.  Also used Provolone cheese on top and shredded Mozzerello cheese as well.(Can never get too much cheese. I pounded the chicken breasts and they came out very moist and tender.  Served to 8 last night and tonight we will eat the leftovers!!!!  Thanks for the recipe.

Only thing I did different was double dip in the batter and bread. Used mozzorella cheese and put some sauce on top also. Do wait 5 mins till done to put cheese on. Next time Ill probally make my own sauce instead of using sauce from out of the jar. Best Parmesan Chicken Ive ever had!! Thats what this recipe should be called bec everyone at the dinner table said that and I agree:)

This is the best recipe for homemade chicken parm. This is my fiance's favorite dish and I was pleasantly surprised when I made this for him, he could not get enough! I kept everything the same except I used the whole 26oz. jar of my favorite local pasta sauce so I could serve the chicken with some pasta. Other than that this is divine and not too difficult.

This really turned out yummy.  :-)  My husband and two younger brothers devoured it.  :-D  It was great.  I made a couple changes though.  
I did what another reviewer suggested and poured the remaining sauce over the top of the chicken and the sprinkled the top w/ Parmesan Cheese (I didn't have any monteray Jack).  It turned out perfect.  Very filling.  Just a note, after sauteing the chicken, if you notice that the juices still aren't clear, don't worry, because the chicken will finish it's cooking when it is in the oven.  

Very yummy!

I made this for my family and they absolutely loved it!  I followed the variations suggested by the reviewers: 1/2 c parm cheese and 1/2 cup bread crumbs, 1 egg instead of 2, and mozzarella cheese added the last 5 min.  My brother only hums while he's eating when the food is delicious.  Only does it at my grandpa's thanksgiving.  He hummed at this meal.

Delicious!  I have to admit my husband is not a chicken lover AT ALL and has asked me to do this recipe again for the weekend!  My kids even gobble it up, Wow!  I only made a few changes: I use chicken tenders that I flatten out slightly, I processed my own breadcrumbs, used real parmesan reggiano, and served over angel hair pasta.  I also added the parmesan butter breadsticks from this site (super easy) and it makes a perfect meal with a crisp side salad! Thanks for making this such an easy dinner option, we will use this again and again!

This is delicious and very simple! I made a few changes. I cut the Parmesan cheese to about 3/4 c. and 1/2 c. breadcrumbs. I also added about a cup of sauce in the bottom of the dish, added the chicken then topped with the remainder of the sauce. I used fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced it and melted over the chicken, then sprinkled with fresh Parmesan cheese right before serving. This has become a staple in my dinner rotation!

I made this with my grandmother's sauce. It is wonderful. The only thing that I did not use was the cheese. I did not have any. I can only imagine how much better it will be with the cheese. Thanks!

My whole family loved this recipe! Neither my husband, son or myself had ever had chicken parmesan and we absolutely loved it! It was very simple and very tasty. I did follow the suggestions of pounding the chicken and adding a few extra seasonings to the bread crumb mix such as Italian seasonings and a bit of garlic salt. I will definitely make this again!

This was quick, easy, and delicious!  I didn't like the sauce I used, but that was my fault...  I modified the recipe slightly: used 1 egg for 2 large pounded-out chicken breasts, equal parts parm and breadcrumbs, and shredded mozz.  Fantastic!

I loved this. I was never crazy about chicken parmesan but this recipe has chnaged my mind. I took the advice to flatten the chicken and to put the chicken in to hold the breading together. I added some garlic to the oil before frying the chicken. I think those who thought this was boring may need to try a different tomato sauce.

The family just loved it.  I did make my own bread crumbs out of crushed crackers and spiced it myself with garlic, onion, paprika, oregano and a dash of chili powder.  It was extremely delicious!

This was great. Made a few minor changes. Browned chicken & then baked with sauce until cooked. I used grated mozzarella cheese & cooked until cheese was browned. Yummy!

Wonderful! I also cut the eggs and batter in half.  I used pre-sliced red pepper Monterey Jack the second time I made it and   that added a subtle hint of great flavour.

Mmm good. Made some modifications as others had suggested. Flattened chicken, used mozzarella instead of monterey jack,  added  good seasonings parmesan /garlic dry salad & dip mix w/ italian breadcrumbs.   I also browned the chicken (w/ breadcrumbs) for a few minutes just to give it a crust and the rest of the time simmering in the oven w/ the sauce.  And added the mozzarella the final few minutes on broil to brown the cheese a bit.

This recipe is great!  We made this for a family gathering and everyone said it could be served in a restrant.  The only thing I would alter is the fact that there were alot of leftover bread crumb mixture.  This recipe I definatly recommend!

This recipe is really good as is, but like others I would suggest pounding the chicken out to about a half inch and instead of using a skillet I just pop the breaded breasts into the oven in a 9X13 baking dish for about 25 minutes then pour the sauce over it and sprinkle with grated mozz cheese and cook for another 10-15 minutes.  I don't have a dishwasher and hate dishes so this cuts out the skillet = )  Really easy!

Absolutely awesome. The best chicken parm that I have ever made. I used to always bake the chicken but this is so much better. The chicken comes out so moist and tender. I used left over homemade spaghetti sauce and Mozzarella cheese. It was great.

I made this with alfredo sauce instead and it was just as great! Will definitely make again. I also didn't need as much cheese and bread crumbs...I cut the amound in half and it was more than enough for 4 chicken breasts.

We used ritz cracker crumbs in place of bread crumbs and jazzed it up with some dried herbs.  Then deglazed the pan with some red wine after browning the chicken and added this to the pasta sauce in the baking dish, along with some broccoli.  Delicious chicken over linguini.

Yum!!!  This turned out so well. I omitted the oil all together by cooking the breaded chicken on my pancake griddle and then transferring to the pan on top of the sauce then sprinkled a bit of garlic powder over the top. I cooked at 400 for about 30 minutes then topped with shredded mozzarella and Parmesan and cooked another 10 minutes at 350 to melt the cheese.  I think the higher oven temp might help prevent the chicken from getting soggy. Also, I wouldn't pour the sauce on top of the chicken, you can always scoop up more sauce when serving.

This was an easy recipe and great flavor. I think the next time I would pound the chicken out and just fry it in the pan with the coating. I think that putting it in the oven made the crust on the soggy side. The house smelled wonderful when the chicken was frying!!

This was GREAT!  I did use the advice of someone else and only used 1 egg.  Used a homemade sauce.  Will make this again and again.

Great as written. Followed the most helpful suggestions. Having the three most helpful at the bottom of the recipe really helps.

I am re-reviewing this recipe. Last time I made this dish as the recipe called for & it wasn't that great. This time I made a few changes & it turned out fantastic. Here's what I did. I didn't pound out the chicken as the recipe calls for. I wanted a very juicy chicken & pounding it out makes it less so to me. I used Panko breadcrumbs instead of seasoned. It makes a crispier crust. I also used shredded Parmesan cheese. I browned the coated chicken in olive oil on both sides & placed them in a 9x13 baking dish. Topped the chicken with my favorite spaghetti sauce & sprinkled with mozzarella cheese. Then baked until cheese was melted. Very yummy this way.

This was awesome- but i made a couple minor changes. I used chicken tenders from Trader Joes and panko bread crumbs instead of plain bread crumbs. To me, chicken parm is all about mozzarella cheese on top so i used fresh mozzarella instead of jack. YUMMY! This will be a part of my rotation- thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is very similar to the one I use, except I like to use a homemade sauce from this website 'Best Marinara Sauce Yet.' It is simply to make, and helps make this recipe taste even more delicious.

I can't believe I've never rated this. I make this ALLLLL the time! This is a family favorite- the flavors are just amazing! The chicken is so tender and it's just a delicious meal. I usually just sprinkle mozzarella on top since I hardly ever buy Monterey jack. This is a must-try!!

By far, the very best chicken Parmesan recipe I have ever tried.  I work in a fine dining Italian restaurant, and I swear, this rivals the version or chef's make!  Bravo!!

All I changed was that I pour some sauce over the chicken as well as under and switched the cheese to Mozzerella, which I added last 5 min. of cooking.  My brother, who doesn't eat anything outside of a fast food box, loved it as did the rest of the family.

This was just okay. It was good for a quick weeknight dinner but nothing special. My friend makes a version of this that was really good. Using mostly the same ingredients and it was very good. I will ask her for her recipe and probably not make this one again.

I've made this quite a few times now, and my husband and I really like it. I use either Monterey Jack cheese or mozzarella, whichever I have at the time and I pour the pasta sauce over the top of the chicken before I put it in the oven. It's incredibily delicious!

Great for an easy meal.  I used mozsarella and added garlic powder and extra herbs to the sauce, but otherwise was great and easy as is for a weeknight dinner.

Pretty tasty, It didn't get that crunchy crust, but I used seasoned breadcrumbs that I made that day that weren't as dry as I would have liked.  I've made this several times and it has always come out well.

This recipe was great.  I tried out outsmart the directions the first time and pour tomato sauce over the top before baking, but it just made the breading soggy.  The second time I followed exactly and it was fantastic!  Thanks :)

I followed this recipe mostly. I read other reviewers so I pound the chicken and browned them for 5 minutes total (2.5 min each side) instead of 6-10 min each side. I also included dried basil and garlic flakes to the bread crumb and cheese mixture. The dish came out great!! It was also very easy to make. DH immediately questioned about the cheese on top, since he knew it wasn't mozzorala. The Jack cheese made this dish stand out. This is a keeper recipe.

Based on all the reviews I expected this dish to be out of this world.  Unfortunately me and my family thought it was just "OK".  In fact, the fam. prefers my own chicken parm recipe where I don't use breading at all, and put the sauce on top of the chicken and not underneath.  Go figure.

Very tasty traditional chicken parm.  Don't brown in the pan as long as the recipe says.  Just get it golden and then let the oven do the rest.

I love this recipe.  The only thing I did differently was add 1 teaspoon dried basil to the bread crumb mixture and 1 minced clove of garlic to the oil before adding the chicken to the pan.  This recipe is easy and delicious.

This was a very good and easy recipe.  The only difference was that I used Pepper Jack cheese instead of the Mont. Jack cheese.  Gave it a nice flavor.  Not too spicy, but just enough.  Will definately make this again.

This came out very dry and flavorless.  Next time I'm just going to make the chicken and stir fry, and avoid the oven and tomato sauce and cheese.

I made some major changes to this recipe as I couldn't get it to go right.Instaed of coating the chicken with the breadcrumb mix i put it in a baking dish with the sauce and added the crumbs on top and left out the slices of montery jack. But it was still lovely and the whole family cleaned their plates!

I redid this recipe this time using a thicker chicken(before I used scallops which proved to be just too thin) and it turned out fabulous. Has a great "restaurant-quality" taste.

This was a wonderful recipe, and easy too. I,as well, refrigerated the chicken first for 20 min. then baked for 15 min put on the cheese the last 5 min. Didnt change anything else. Definately a keeper.

This was delicious!!! I made it just like the recipe said except I didn't have any eggs so I just ran the chicken under water to make the bread crumb mixture stick....I didn't know how it was going to turn out but it was amazing. Will for sure make this again!

Very easy recipe.  I'm a vegetarian, and I made this with chicken for my fiance, and substituted with sliced firm tofu for myself.  Mine was delicious and he says his was too!  Excellent either way!

This is a great recipe! Have made it twice in two weeks. I used mozz cheese rather than Mont Jack but I am sure it is good either way.I did cut my chicken breats in half butterfly style to get yummy thin pieces.

This is excellent.  I too followed Momsavedbygrace's advice and made a few small changes to the recipe. The chicken was so moist and tender!  My picky 6 and 4 year olds both loved it!!  Thank you for another family favorite to add to my recipe box.  Can't ask for more: quick, easy, yummy, and a hit with the entire family!!

Absolutely delicious!
I poured more sauce over the chicken when it had about 10 minutes left of baking. I also added LOTS of mozarella cheese.
This will be a regular at our house.

Yum. I will make a few adjustments but will definitely keep this in the rotation, especially now that I have found some bread crumbs without hydrogenated oils.

Great traditional chicken parm recipe. As suggested, I used flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs (added garlic powder). I forgot just how messy it is to make this recipe...next time I will try shaking it in large bags to coat chicken with the flour & breadcrumbs.

We loved this recipe.  It was very simple.  I actually coated the chicken with egg and then the seasoning and baked it first instead of frying.  My hubby loved it! :)

Great recipe.  Feel free to mess around with it yourself!  I made my own breadcrumbs by adding six slices of bread to a food processor and adding italian seasoning and parmesan cheese to that.  I also flatten the chicken breasts.  I also used mozzarella instead of monterey jack.  Everyone loves this served over spaghetti.

Very yummy and easy to make. I used tomato sause and added some seasonings to it - basil, garlic, onion powder and parsley. I also used shredded mozzarella on top. Everyone enjoyed and I will make again.

This was wonderful!  The only thing I changed is to brown the breasts in 1/2 butter 1/2 oil as I think it gives a better result.  Two of my daughters and my husband fought over the last breast, next time I'll have to make more!

This is one of the most-requested things I make. Served over linguine. I usually make more than the recipe (there's plenty of coating mix), then it makes for great lunches the next day!

WOW! It did take a bit of time, only because I pounded chicken to cook evenly & made double to feed my growing teenager.  Also added garlic powder & a pinch of salt to breading. After reading reviews, couldn't decide so used 1/2 Mozz & 1/2 Mont. Jack cheeses.  Wonderful!  Served over fettuccine with salad & bread on the side...Thank you!

Very easy to prepare, and delicious. I used Mozz. cheese instead to cut some fat. But otherwise great "Don't have much time" dinner.

This turned out great! As always, I made a few changes...I used crushed garlic and herb croutons (I was out of bread crumbs)for the chicken breading and fried it in canola oil. Can you say YUM!!! And I used a mushroom spaghetti sauce and cooked the chicken for 25 minutes at 350 and then covered it with shredded Italian cheese. I served it with angel hair pasta with garlic and parmesan butter sauce. It was quick and easy and I think that if you don't have on hand exactly what the recipe calls for then you can substitute just about anything. Great recipe!!!

mmmmmm, what a delicious chicken dinner this made! i followed the directions as written with the exception of baking the chicken for 10 minutes, then putting the cheese on top & baking it for 10 minutes more. i also heated the tomato sauce (barilla's garlic & mushroom) ahead of time. we enjoyed this with angel hair pasta on the side. thank you alicia!

This is so easy and GREAT! My husband loved it! I took the advice of seasoning the chicken well to give it more flavor and used mozzarella cheese. The sauce tasted great from the chicken cooking in it. I served it with lightly buttered spaghetti, crusty french bread and a green salad. This is a keeper!!! Thanks!

Perfect! I used provolone because that's what I had on hand, but I think any cheese would work. Just like another reviewer mentioned, the sauce tastes wonderful with the chicken flavor in it. I would probably use Italian bread crumbs next time for more flavor. I did add garlic powder as someone suggested. I'll be making this a lot! Thanks!

Delicious!  One of the best things about this recipie is how great the sauce tastes after cooking in the oven with the chicken.  Monterey Jack is good on top but I've tried others with success also.

this is excellent! i used mozarella instead of monterey jack, since they don't sell monterey jack here. i made a mistake though, instead of placing the chicken on the sauce, i drowned the chicken in the sauce before baking it! will read instructions properly next time. yum yum!

Absolutely perfect exactly what I was looking for. I used 3 full chicken breast beat them down and cut them in half. For the sauce I made a simple sauce by simmering a 12oz can of tomato sauce, 2 tsp of oregano, and 1 cup of chicken broth. This was great served with linguine alfrado.

Very good. I substituted Water Buffalo Mozzerella for the Jack and served on a bed of spaghetti with Marinara. I added a little butter to the oil when browning and used Panko Italian breadcrumbs 50-50with grated parm (refrig 1/2 hour before browning). I salted the pasta water well so the dish was not bland.

Quite good, although I did find the chicken a little bland... perhaps marinating it in the tomato sauce for half an hour or so would give it a little more kick. I'll definately experiment with this recipe.

Simply delicious!  Wish I could give it more than 5 stars.  I only needed one egg.  The bread crumb mixture makes a lot and could probably be cut in half.  I'm putting the leftover in a plastic bag to be used another time.  I only had pepper jack cheese and it was so tasty.  We all loved it.  Thanks, Alicia!

This was great served with pasta.  I subbed in shredded mozzarella instead of Monterey Jack and it worked really well!

This was pretty good. I don't like to saute stuff, so I stuck it straight in the oven for about half an hour or so. I honestly don't know the difference in taste and it saves dishes and extra work! I forgot to put the cheese on the last 5-19 minutes and put in on right away, but it still was fine.

Excellent recipe! I pounded my chicken breasts and lighly seasoned them with a little season salt and garlic before dipping in the egg.  I followed other reviewer's suggestion and refridgerated my chicken for 15 minutes so that the coating would stay on better.  Next time I think I will try to oven fry the chicken to be a little healthier.

Pretty good recipe..I used 6 chicken thighs and coated w/ seasoned flour before dipping in 1 egg and bread crumb/cheese mixture.. I made my own seasoned bread crumbs and pasta sauce so was able to season to our liking and topped w/ mozzarella...I served w/ buttered fettuccine, Cold Green Bean Salad and garlic toast...will probably make again.

I didn't have any breadcrumbs, so I crushed some Italian flavored croutons and used that instead.  The flavor was awesome!  The only thing I would change is to pound the chicken thinner (to about 1/2 inch thickness) because I like my meat thin. Still, this recipe is great!

I used chicken cutlets and added extra oregano to the bread crumbs. I think making sure the chicken is nice and brown and crispy is important too. I took the leftovers to my daughter and she left a message on my phone tnat it was the best chicken parm she'd ever had and she had to have my sauce recipe. I laughed because I had used Ragu's Robusto parmesan and romano and added a pinch of sugar. Great recipe!

THis was pretty good.  I don't think my family will specifically ask for it again, but they would eat it if I made it again.  I used plain tomato sauce- it's all I had, and added some italian spices to it and a touch of sugar.

Wonderful!  I tried this recipe twice, once with monterey jack and once with mozerella.  It was great both times.  My husband and I both prefer the monterey jack, as called for in the recipe!  Thanks!!

Very easy and very good.  Pounding the chicken definitely helped, but also doubled the amount of chicken we had... each breast pounded out created 2 servings, so we ended up with a lot of leftover chicken.  Definitely didn't need to use all that bread mixture.

I thought this was "okay" but on the other hand, I'm really picky when it comes to tomato-based sauce dishes.. so, it wasn't as good as I was expecting it to be. My huband, on the other hand, LOVED it and kept on reminding me how great it was throughout the meal. As another reviewer, I pounded the chicken to get a more even thickness, which made nicer presentation. I used traditional spaghetti sauce but next time will probably just use a can of tomato sauce with Italian seasoning mixed into it, which would pretty much taste the same.

EXCELLENT! Very simple and VERY tasty! Made exactly as stated, but added some basil & oregano to the bread crumb mixture, and used Olive oil for the frying. Will probably put extra sauce in baking dish next time - we like lots of sauce! It makes a nice covering for whatever side dish you serve. The Monterey Jack cheese was a great compliment to the dish! Thanks for the post! Enjoyed it!

Wow!  This recipe is my favorite so far.  It was easy to make, made a beautiful presentation, and tasted delicious!  It's excellent made as directed, but you can also change it up by adding mushrooms, using tomato sauce instead of pasta sauce, and using different cheeses.  It's a perfect meal when served with pasta, salad and garlic bread.  I felt like I was eating in my favorite Italian restaurant!

This is probably my favorite of all of the recipes I have tried for chicken on this website. It is fantastic! It is simple to make, tastes incredible, and has quickly become a favorite of mine and my boyfriend's. Thanks for this wonderful recipe! :)

good recipe, i used to make mine without frying first.  what was i thinking?  this is much better.  i pounded out 3 chicky breast, and used mozzy cheese instead of monterey jack.  breading stuck to the chicken not to the pan, will make again soon!

This is a good recipe.  I usually pound the chicken so that it doesn't have to stay in the pan too long.  That way your breading doesn't get browned too much.

This is so easy to make.  My husband, a picky eater, had 2 helpings of it.  I took the advice of cutting the breading portion in half and refridgerating before cooking.  It turned out perfect!

Excellent! My boyfriend's favorite food is Chicken Parmesan (he orders it at every restaurant that offers it) and he said this is definitely the best he has ever tried! I only used 1 egg, and sauteed the chicken in olive oil. I used Emeril's Kicked Up Tomato Sauce which added a little spice to the meal & served over fresh linquine (using the left over sauce from the jar for the pasta). I suggest using Sargento Italian style shredded cheese, sprinkling it on for just the last 5 minutes of baking time. This not only turns out more attractive, but also gives a more authentic taste than the Monterey Jack cheese. This went great with some homemade garlic bread! Try this and you won't be sorry!!!

This was a hit with my whole family, and so easy to make too!  I didn't brown the chicken, I just baked it, about 20 minutes or so each side and added the sauce and cheese the last few minutes.  Served over thin spaghetti with a salad and french bread.  I will be making this often!

This was much better the second time I made it.  I seasoned the chicken with Lawry's seasoning salt and pepper before browning it in the pan.  That made all the difference in the world and the dish was fabulous!

My family thought this recipe was wonderful. Based on other reviews, I did halve the crumb mixture, and found 1 egg was sufficient. I took the advice of a few, and used chicken tenders pounded flat, did the breading step and refridgerated it for 30 minutes and did not brown it. This recipe is a keeper, thanks for sharing this, Alicia! :)

So, so good!  Loved this dish!  I dipped the breasts in egg, then rolled the breasts in Italian bread crumb, grated parmesean, and garlic salt mixture.  Then put breasts in skillet for about 8 minutes.  In meantime, I took a 9 x 13 pan and poured about 13 oz. of Classico tomato basil sauce (as suggested by another user), then I added marsala wine to the sauce and added capers.  Then put the breasts on top of the sauce mixture, added one slice of mozarella instead of monterey cheese per breast and sprinkled parmesean cheese on top of that - covered everything and baked for 20 minutes on 375. Chicken was so moist.  Only suggestion I would make is half the bread crumbs and parmesan because I ended up throwing the other half away and increase the tomato sauce, 12 ounces was not enough. Will definitely be a regular!

Fabulous!  The bread crumbs and parmasean did not stick to the chicken so I was left with a whole bowl of wasted bread crumbs and parmasean. I would suggest using half of what is indicated and add more if neccessary.

This recipe was great, we didn't have the monteray jack cheese, so we substituted the shredded mozzeralla cheese instead, and was still delicous.

This was very very very good.   I used the "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" in place of the can of tomato sauce.  The marinara sauce along with the parmesan/italian bread crumb chicken coating made this recipe great.

I have made this twice and it is soooooo yummy!  Freezes very well, too.  I took the recommendation os another poster and put the chicken in the fridge for about 20 minutes and then the raw breaded chicken on top of the sauce and cooked in the oven for about 45 minutes.  Put cheese on with about 15 minutes left and added more sauce on top.  Served with fettucinne and a caesar salad with breadsticks. YUM...this recipe is my favorite so far from this site!

Absolutely delicious!!!! I made this tonight and it got rave reviews from all.  I used mozzarella cheese unstead and cut down the frying time.  I put it in the oven with sauce underneath and on top.  Baked for 10 mins then added sliced cheese.  My friends thought this was better then at the restaurants.  Thanks for a great recipe.

MMMMM - I used a mixture of Parmesan/Mozz and Italian Bread crumbs when coating the chicken.  I also used Chicken Tenders.  I then put on top of the spaghetti sauce (just Hunts)...and then covered with more Parmesan/Mozz mix.  It was very tender, juicy and yummy!

The bread crumbs fell off the chicken making the sauce full of lumpy bread crumbs. I think it would be best to leave out the bread crumbs.

Wow! We were in heaven with this recipe.  I messed up and accidently used whole chicken breasts instead of halves, but it still turned out great.  Used a sauce flavored with sausage, and it was dynamite.  Will definitely make this again - for company!

This was good.  Add some garlic salt to it and when cooking the breaded chicken, use more of a medium heat to cook thoroughly without burning the outside breading...if using thicker chicken breasts.  It doesn't need much tomato sauce either...the chicken is very flavorful with the cheeses.

This is superb! And defintely a keeper, especially for those days that you  have so very little time yet really want a good meal. I used chicken cutlets and made as per the recipe. Served it with steamed broccoli and a tossed salad. Rave reviews!

This recipe is very good & easy.  I do recommend adding a little seasoning to the recipe for a litel added flavor.

This has become standard fare at our house!  Very easy and economical and tasty.  I use a combo of pounded-thin breasts and boneless, skinless thighs--hubby's not fond of white meat.  Serve with salad and breadsticks or garlic bread and you've got a complete, satisfying meal!  Thanks Alicia

I made this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and he absolutely loved it! It's his favorite restaurant dish, but this was the first time he'd had it homemade and he said it was 10 times better than in restaurants! It's somewhat cheap and very easy~ something a college girl like my self loves in a recipe! Thanks Alicia!

Everyone liked the taste of the chicken dish, however the amount of Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs was way more than needed.  Other than that it makes a good no fuss meal.

This is one of the easiest recipes I've tried in awhile and everyone loved it!  I used the small jar of Ragu Traditional sauce, and paired the dish with a pasta side tauced in an alfredo sauce.
Quite often leftovers are there for a few days, however this was gone by the next day.

This recipe tasted ok. I had to make a few slight modifications. Like i cooked it on med low heat instead of med high. I used Colby-Jack shredded cheese instead of plain colby. Was a little too salty and isnt real kid friendly. I probably wont make this one again.

I put sliced mushrooms, onions, and minced garlic into the tomato sauce for a bit more of flavor.  Put over angel-hair pasta.
I think the cheese could use some more flavor...maybe a different kind of cheese

This was really good.  I only had moz. cheese though so I had to use that.  I think the Monterrey would have been even better.  I baked the chicken in a whole jar of sauce and then served Spag. with the meal.  The chicken had an excellent flavor and the kids absolutley loved it.  Will make this again and again I'm sure.

Fantastic!  By substituting plain yogurt for the eggs and cooking spray for the oil, I was able to make the recipe a bit more cholesterol-friendly for my hubby.  We both loved it and it's even good reheated!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very easy to make and taste great.  Definately don't need as much crumb mixture.  Used a really good pasta sauce and flattened the chicken pieces slightly.  I will keep this recipe in my collection.

We really liked this, I'll definitely be making it again.  I scaled back the bread crumb/cheese amounts because I only had 4 pieces of chicken and still had a bunch left over. I also used a whole jar of spaghetti sauce so there would be plenty for the spaghetti I served with it.

i used spaghetti sauce and tomato, being that i wanted more sauce, since i cut my breats up into 1/4 pcs., i added very little flour also, and it was a hit for dinner. i served with a little spaghetti as well as another reviewer, and added alot of garlic to my chicken before frying, for taste inside chicken-----easy and yummy!

This was AWESOME!! I used Italian bread crumbs and sliced mozzarella. Instead of parmesean I used shredded asiago cheese...yummy!! I served with brocolli pasta sauce over fettucinni noodles. The guys loved this one!!

AWESOME!  This was the best.  Great taste, simple ingredients and easy.  I substituted large slices of mozzarella and used Italian Bread Crumbs.  I used Hunts Spaghetti Sauce - Roasted Garlic flavor.  Made it for my in-laws and they raved about it.  I served it over linguini noodles.  Needed extra sauce for the noodles.  Served with french-style green beans, Romaine salad and cheesy garlic bread!  I am definitely going to make this again, especially if I want to impress somebody.

This is the BEST quick dinner idea.  My daughter who NEVER likes chicken unless it's so well done that it's tough, proclaimed that this is better than any "gourmet restaurant meal". Quite a compliment from this gal! I made up extra dishes, and froze them for her to take back to college.

Excellent! But probably only half the breadcrumbs and parmesan is really needed.

DELISH!!!  I followed the recipe with one exception--I added a couple of minced garlic cloves (I'm a garlic lover;)).  I just stirred them into the tomato sauce and it added a nice flavor.

This recipe was super!  My husband and I both loved it.  I used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese.  I served the chicken with spaghetti and spooned the sauce over both.  Very good and going into my recipe box.

I made this dish for 3 families and everyone seemed to really enjoy it.  Definitely need to scale back the breading amounts.

This is an excellent recipe, easy to make and very tasty. The result is an entree comparable to what you would find in a fine Italian restaurant.
