Yummy!  I cubed a fresh potato and let those cook in the bacon grease for about 10 minutes before adding the peppers and onions.  This is a little tricky to get on a plate in one swoop unless you have a VERY large spatula.  It takes some doctoring to make it look pretty ;)  Taste great!

Used diced left over baked potatoes, and skipped the pepper.  I ended up finishing this for the last 10 min in a 350* oven, as the potatoes were starting to get too brown.  Tasty, quick breakfast!

My family has used this recipe for many years and it is one of our favorites.  We leave out the green pepper since no one likes it much in our house, but leave everything else as specified in the recipe.  It is a great "breakfast for dinner" recipe for busy weeknights.

I used fresh potatoes that I sliced very fine and didn't use any green pepper. I also added a bit of olive oil to mine to get the potatoes to crunch up a bit more. It was very tasty, but I don't think my stove is up to the task on the eggs. I eventually got tired of waiting on them and just chopped them up into the potatoes, which got them done very very fast. So mine was not as pretty as some others, but it was very tasty and I will make again :)

This dish is very good.  However, we preferred serving the bacon along side this dish and topping with loads of sliced green onions and it was sooooo good!

I liked this but be careful.  In the 8-10 minutes it took to cook the eggs they had hardened yolks.  yuck.  I'll probably try again since the only thing left on everyone's plates was the ball of hardened yolk.  Also, we needed more salt.

Ok, so I totally just used this recipe as a base for the one I actually made. We didn't have cubed hash browns, so I used regular ones, we didn't have bacon, so I used breakfast sausage. I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup. And....WOW!! It was so good!

Very good!  We ate the bacon separately and I sprinkled the dish with shredded cheese.  Definitely a make-againer!

Made this without the eggs as I already had a quiche to accompany it - it was very simple, though took longer to cook than anticipated - hubby finished it right out of the dish standing up (I guess calories don't count that way... : )

This recipe is sooooo good. i really enjoyed how the cheese blended everything together as one big meal. I very much say that anyone who loves skillets should make and eat this masterpiece.
