I added some shredded cheddar cheese and baked in a muffin pan for about 25 minutes. Very good!

I have been making this for years and everyone loves it.  If I don't make it they are asking for it.  Nice and easy.

This was good, but i am used to broccoli corn bread being a little sweeter, so I added 1/4 cup of sugar and used sauteed vidalia onion. Also if it is for just your family I would half the recipe because it makes a lot!

YUM...this recipe is pure comfort food. It does not have a strong flavor...next time I may add grated parmasan. FYI: I didnt dice my onions well enough, so run them through a food processor.

Followed the recipe exactly - but made half in a muffin pan, and half in a baking dish.  Both turned out very moist - will definitely be making again!

This is one of those recipes you can TRUST to be a HIT! I am totally addicted!!! I made them in 12 count muffin pan and my husband and I wrestle over them. They are SO good and hit the spot when you are lookin for a snack that will satisfy all your cravings; sweet, bready, and veggie all in one! I make my own honey butter and it brings it all together! I praise this recipe! thankyou!!!

I've used this recipe for years and we just LOVE them, esp. as mini muffins.  It's always been a healthy snack for my children, because of the slightly sweet taste of the cornbread mix!

Wow! This recipe is outstanding. I love the texture and the salty & sweet taste. Half the recipe if you want to make 12 regular-sized muffins (and decrease baking time to 20-25 minutes). Like a previous reviewer suggested, topping it with honey butter makes it taste even better!

We just didn't care for these.  My husband is the only one who ate it.  My daughter and I love cornbread and we love broccoli but just didn't like the combination unfortunately.

This is a great recipe.  For variety I add shredded cheese and a small can of green chiles.  Nice mexican twist.

This was good however I think it would be better with homemade cornbread instead of the jiffy mix. The people at worked liked it though and asked for the recipe.

I used steamed fresh broccoli, but kept everything else the same.  I just can't get enough and have gone back for seconds at least 4 times now!  YUMMY!!

Very Tasty...Needed to do a substitution, used Greek Yogurt in place of Cottage Cheese, I believe this was a good sub due to the creamy texture and tang.

It was pretty yummy, but when I used the 13x9 baking pan, it was not cooked all the way in the middle.  I'll make muffins next time.

I've been making this ever since I was a kid. Perfect and filling-- I wouldn't change a thing! Tastes great either warm or cold.

This was moist and enjoyed by most at a gathering. Personally, I think a small onion would have been sufficient, no need for a large one.

I thought these were tasty. My family and a few friends thought they were on the mushy side. I will use less cottage cheese next time. I also added shredded cheddar cheese to the batter.

Made this for my picky husband (who literally gags at the smell or taste of broccoli) and he loved it.  His exact word:  "INCREDIBLE."  My only alteration:  cut back cottage cheese to 1 cup and added 1 cup shredded cheddar to the batter and sprinkled about another half cup on the top.   I had this wonderful concoction growing up, mainly at potluck socials or family gatherings.  I had never made it myself and am so happy this turned out just like I remembered it.
