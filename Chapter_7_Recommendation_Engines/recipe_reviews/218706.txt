I used pecan pieces instead of walnuts and I made my own oven dried apple chips--I made no other changes. This was incredible! Awesome movie snack. I'll make this again and again.

Really good the grandkids and Grandma couldn't keep our hands out of it.  We drizzled melted carmel over the mix.  It was to die for.

Excellent Snack.  I made some for a Sunday Afternoon Football gathering and it was all gone within a couple of hours!  I used Apple Chips instead of freeze dried apples and it worked great.  Try this one!

Very tasty...my family devoured it while watching the game and awaiting Thanksgiving dinner. One note for those who have problem melting the white chips in the microwave...use a double boiler instead. Bring water to a boil over medium heat, add the top pot, making sure the water doesn't touch the top pot. Add chips and shortening, stirring constantly. It will be melted and creamy in about 5 minutes this way without seizing up.

Delicious! Microwave the white chocolate chips and shortening for 30 seconds at 50% power. Stir until the bowl is no longer warm. Continue to microwave at 15 to 30 seconds-stir after each time-until the chips are melted smoothly. Drizzling is easier when the melted chocolate is put in a Ziplock bag-cut a tiny hole in the corner of the bag and drizzle away!

Yum!  The only thing I didn't do was add walnuts.  I didn't think alot of the dried apples, either.  The ones I had were rather chewy so next time I'll leave those out, too.  Otherwise, yum!  Update:  I found crunchy dried apples so I used those.  Also - I found that microwaving for only 2 minutes instead of 4 worked better.  At 4 it was burned.

It didn't taste awful, but I wouldn't call it good. I won't be making it again.

I used dried cranberries instead of apples and a dash of cardamom  for part of the nutmeg.  Will try with  dried apples or pears though!

I made this yesterday and served it to some dear friends in my Bible Study.  We all loved it.  I used pecans instead of walnuts. That's a southern thing!  I highly recommend this recipe and it was pretty easy to make.  Debbie

I used apple-cinnamon chex in place of cinnamon chex, and corn chex in place of rice. No walnuts. No dried apples. No drizzle. Nice apple flavor, although could have been prettier and had more texture variety to use dried apples.
