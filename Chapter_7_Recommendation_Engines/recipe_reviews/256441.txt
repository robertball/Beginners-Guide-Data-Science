This was a nice Sunday breakfast.  One note - start the hash browns first, they will take longer than 10 minutes.  I used Monterey Jack cheese which was great with roasted tomato salsa.  Based on the name of the recipe, hubby wanted to know where the waffle was.  :)

I used green chilies and added mushrooms and definitely will be making this again
