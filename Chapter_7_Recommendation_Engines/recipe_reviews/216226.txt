I made this bread last week.  It was GREAT! It's exactly what I was looking for in a pumpkin bread recipe.  It has a lot of flavor and the beer gives it a good balance and moist texture.  I used Red Hook WIT brew in mine it isn't a pumpkin beer but the grocery store was completely out.  If you want a really good pumpkin flavored beer try Sam Adams Octoberfest.  I also used brown turbinado sugar and replaced half of the oil with applesauce for a slightly healthier version.  I could not find chia seeds so i left those out and opted out of the walnuts.  I did make a glaze for the top with 3 oz. cream cheese, milk, powdered sugar and crushed pecans that was A-FRICKIN-MAZING! If you had pumpkin bread as a child and loved it you will love this healthier/adult recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe!  Virtually impossible to mess up, so easy to mix.  I accidentally doubled the nutmeg and it was STILL amazing.  Everyone I shared it with enjoyed it and practically licked the crumbs off of the plate.  

The only thing I will say is be careful with the baking time.  I had to bake mine for about an hour and ten minutes, and to avoid burning it, I checked it every five minutes after the suggested 50 minutes was up.  Parts were still a bit underdone, but it was still delicious!

This is a very good recipe - my kids loved it.  I added chocolate chips to it. I live at high altitude, so it needed an additional 10 minutes.

This is a great recipe for pumpkin bread.  I used equal amount of coconut oil instead of the canola oil.  And for the pumpkin beer I used Lakefront Brewery Pumpkin Spice beer from Milwaukee, WI.

This was excellent! I used white whole wheat flour and Oktoberfest beer. I also cooked it in a ceramic loaf pan, so I put the temp down 25 degrees and cooked it for a bit longer. Everything else was exactly according to the recipe and my family gave it a thumbs up! 

Just a note though: If you double the recipe, you don't need 76 cups of chia seeds. I have no idea why it did that, but 1/2 cup will do. ;)

Absolutely incredible. I’ve made this many times and it always comes out delicious. I will say make sure to put your chia seeds in the water right before mixing them in. They’ll soak up all the 1/4 cup liquid if you do this step in advance. I used a heavy pumpkin stout for the beer. One that was too heavy for me to drink normally. I’ve made this with chocolate chips as well

Really good and moist. We made it with raisins in half the loaf and it was delicious.

So I made two Pumpkin Beer Breads.  This  was so easy to make just following the directions. So the two beers I used were the New Belgium Pumpkick and the other beer I used was called "America's Orginal Pumpkin Ale made by Buffalo's Bill Brewery.. On the Pumpkick Beer Bread I chopped up some pecans and spread them on top before placing the pan in the oven.  On the Pumpkin Ale Beer Bread is a  crumb topping and is actually pecans in which I put into my NutritBullet and I turn on it until it came to a crumb /paste lookking mixture.  Then I just sprinkled it on top of the bread mixture before putting it into the oven.  I did set the timer for the 50 minutes as recommended, but I had to put in back in for anther 20 minutes ( two 10 minute intervals ) for the center of the bread to cook.  Both breads turned out just fine.

This is an excellent recipe; probably the best pumpkin bread recipe I've ever stumbled on to.  What really makes it good is the addition of chia seeds and the beer.  The texture, moisture and rich flavor of this bread is incredible.  My husband went nuts over it.  The only different things I did was that I used a chocolate lager beer since I did not have pumpkin beer on hand.  Also I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  Sprinkled roasted pumpkin seeds and a bit of sugar on top before placing in oven.  Doubled the recipe and was glad I did.  Will be making this again and again.

Delicious!.  We prefer pecans so I used pecans instead of walnuts.  I followed the recipe the first time as written and my husband loved it.  I was looking for a sweeter and spicier twist so the second time I doubled the cinnamon and added extra pumpkin pie spice.  I also used 1 1/2 cups of sugar to make it a sweeter bread.  Both ways were outstanding.

Delicious bread! My husband was hovering wanting to know when he could finally eat it! The smells are amazing while its cooking! 
I used coconut oil in stead of the canola oil and it still turned out amazing. I'll be playing with this recipe to change it up too! Chocolate chips, raisins, etc. Great recipe! Thank you!
