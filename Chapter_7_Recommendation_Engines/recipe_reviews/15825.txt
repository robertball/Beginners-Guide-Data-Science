This was my first attempt at making meatloaf and although the directions were a little vague for a novice like me (how finely does the onion and bell pepper need to be chopped?? I didn't know!)it was REALLY good! I didn't have bay leaves and it didn't suffer because of it. I used a little less breadcrumbs, and more ground beef and garlic. I didn't find it too spicy as other reviewers had commented. It was a little greasy, but I just poured the oil off when it was cooked. Leaving it to stand for 15 minutes was definitely good advice. I will be making this again!

This is fantastic!  I've tried other recipes for Cajun Meatloaf, but this is the best yet.  Spicy, but didn't need to sleep with a pack of antacids next to bed.  I followed the recipe to the tee & did not find it soggy or mushy.  On the contrary, texture was perfect; making for great sandwiches the following two days!  Highly recommend to all that generally hate meatloaf (such as I).

This is an awesome loaf.  However, you must precisely follow all directions.  Be patient cooking down the milk and veggies into sauce.  Bake the loaf on a rack to drain off the fat.  Use evaporated milk.  Skip any of these three and you will get mush.  Add a pince of thyme.  Wait until the next day and it just gets better for sandwiches.

Too spicy for kids, however.

Finally - FINALLY - a recipe for meatloaf that isn't bland and boring and convered with a sickly sweet sauce. This one is flavorful and delicious, and if you follow the recipe carefully it has a nice texture. I couldn't find andouille in my area so I had to substitute hot Italian sausage. My children love this. My 1 year old ate 3 helpings! I'll make this one often.

I am relatively new to cooking so I was taking a big step with this, but it was a hit and turned out great! We served it with a simple green salad with tomatoes and balsamic dressing -- anything heavier (potatoes, bread, even brocolli) might have been too much.  For the other novice cooks attempting this -- the hot pepper sauce I used was Cholula, but you can use tobasco too. We chopped the vegies into small chunks -- not so fine that you'd use a food processor, but not too chunky either. This way the flavors blend together and you won't bite into a big piece of pepper or something. When we pulled it out of the oven the grease had pooled to the sides which you can just pour off. We let it stand for about 15 min before serving. Perfect time to make a salad and set the table! We will definitely make again and are looking forward to the cold meatloaf for lunch today!

This is the best meatloaf recipe I've tried.  I am usually not a meatloaf fan, but this has changed my mind.  I've also used this to make the juciest bbq'd burgers.  My entire family loves them!!!  Definitely try this!!!!!

I love this recipe and I love any type of meatloaf. My family hates it. I thought maybe they would like this one, they didn't. Hard crowd to please. I loved it! Thanks for sharing it with me.

Absolutely fool-proof!!!  I have cooked this recipe on three occasions to the letter, with the exception of the sausauge -- I used italian sausage; it's always turned out perfectly.  It hasn't failed to be a hit, even with those who are not meatloaf lovers!  Highly recommended

I made this for my husband, who is a meatloaf expert, and he LOVED it.  Very moist, very spicy and flavorful, and great for leftovers as it makes a lot.  Served it with mashed potatoes and crescent rolls... a great dinner.

I love the flavor combination of the spices and hot sauce ( Chalula).  Not too hot, but still zippy.  I used ground pork instead of beef and left out the sausage, which seemed to cut out the grease issue that some people were having.  I put a thin layer of Chipotle BBQ sauce on the top before cooking and it added an awesome sweet flavor that mingled in with the spicy of the meatloaf.  I will definitely be making this often.  Thanks!

This is an awesome recipe.  I have been making it for years and it's a family favorite (and envied by everyone).   I have made a few minor changes to reduce the heat a bit... I omit the hot pepper sauce, white pepper, and reduce the cayenne and black pepper to about a 1/4 tsp each.

I am not a meatloaf fan and I love this one. Just do yourself a favour and make it in a loaf pan. If you shape it loose on a sheet tray it falls apart. And I had to add more hot sauce and cayenne and chilli as it was a bit too bland for pour taste at beginning - just try the “sauce” or slurry you are making to add and adjust the seasoning then, before adding it into the meat mixture.

I used Bob Evan's spicy sausage instead of the andouille sausage. I also add extra hot sauce. Very good!!

In all fairness the spice composition of this recipie is awesome but we did not like the sausage flavor in this so next time I will will make it with extra ground beef and omit the sausage but the flavoring of the other spices was awesome!

This is the best recipe you'll ever taste. You will never have regular meatloaf again. You can make it as hot or mild as you want.

Really wonderful! We loved it. Only thing we didn't do is put in bay leaves, and the store didn't have andouille so we used chorizo - which seemed to be a great substitute in case you end up in the same situation as us. It's very filling, so it'll go pretty far. I loved it with garlic potatoes.  I plan on using some of the leftovers in burritos.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I have been making this for years, following the recipe exactly.   My husband's family is from South Louisiana and they LOVE it.  I use extra lean ground beef and have made this with both the andouille and even with Healthy Choice sausage and it comes out great either way.  Bill knows his stuff.

I thought it was good... Added a little ketchup and 3 bacon slices over the top before baking.  Only problem I had was I doubled the recipe and I think the amount of butter probably shouldn't have been doubled.  The vege mixture never really stuck to the pan...even after cooking on high heat for 12 minutes...I split the mix in two loaves and baked separately...but they fell apart.  The flavor was good, but it was just a little messy!

I've made this a couple of times because I really enjoy Cajun food and this meatloaf is a winner. Tastes even better on the second day. Spicy, maybe a bit too much for children but great for people that enjoy some heat.

Do use the andouille if possible, it really makes the dish.  I have used both smoked and fresh andouille. When using smoked I strip off the casings and break it up using a food processor or blender.  When using fresh I removed the casing and just mixed it into the meat.  To lower the fat content ground turkey instead of beef works well.  I found when using the smoked andouille there was less fat rendered.

I reduced the amount of butter to 2 TBS.  It takes longer than 6 minutes to cook down the veg but be patient.  It is the vegatable mixture that makes this one so unique.

To reduce the spice level I don't recommend using Tabasco but some other brand of hot sauce.

This was my first time making meatloaf and it turned out SUPER AWESOME! My fiance and I love spicy, so this was fantastic. I added minced jalapenos because I had it on hand and wanted to use it up. I couldn't find andouille sausage, so I used a spicy sausage from Sobey's. I will definitely be making this again as it was seriously amazing!

The strong scent of the andouille really turned off both my wife and I.  I 1/2 again-ed the recipe when I made it in hopes of having left-overs to take to work with me.  I made this in three loaf pans, and when we decided we didn't care for it, I took it to work and everyone loved it.  We have several very good cooks at work and I guess I was the only one who didn't care for the smell.  I did like the taste and the "heat" was very good.   I would make this recipe again substituting the sausage for something else.  Will let you know when I try it again.

This was fantastic! My husband inhaled in before letting me know that I could make it for him again any time I wanted. I drained off the grease after it was done baking, and it wasn't greasy at all. I will definitely be making this again.

This meatloaf is so tasty!  My husband and I both loved it.  The spicy vegetable mix is perfect.  I had a pound of hot sausage, so I used that instead of the andouille, but I'm sure it would have been wonderful with the andouille.  I was a little afraid of the spice, so I didn't use the cayenne pepper, but it would have been good with it, if you like cayenne.  I don't really like meatloaf that much, but this is a winner!

Made this for the first time last night ... cut the recipe in half for a serving of 4 expecting that my boyfriend and I would have leftovers.  We ate the ENTIRE thing!  The only difference was that I used beef and turkey because we needed to use the remaining ground turkey we had bought.  Next time using the sausage ... it can only be even better!

I didn't have andouille sausage so I used hot Italian sausage and left out the green bell peppers (not a fan) and have cooked it both in the slow cooker and oven. Both times are a SMASH! Not mushy or greasy at all. Now it's a usual staple at the house and a constant request among friends.

ok... I hate to be the odd ball but I made this meat loaf tonight for dinner and my mother and I both love meat loaf. neither she or I really cared for it. I went by the recipe just as it said. The only difference was I forgot to buy the white pepper. I wouldnt say that its terrible just not a keeper for my family of 5. I was the only one that ate. The rest is just sitting there. Sorry Bill but you do have alot of others that seem to love it. Thanks

Amazing!  I double the recipe and put into 7 small disposable loaf pans.  I then put them in a Ziploc freezer bag, suck all the air out (no need for a vacuum sealer) and put them in the freezer for a quick go to meal or on hand to give away.  They freeze great.  Only takes me a an hour and a half and I have 7 meals.  Everyone loves them.

Wow! That's got some kick to it! Any restaurant would be proud to have that on its menu. I didn't use any butter because I wanted to make it a lil' heart healthy. It's a great way to get my kid to drink milk too! :D

This recipe is HANDS DOWN the BEST meatloaf I have ever MADE and ever TASTED! Followed the recipe almost exactly and it couldn't have come out more perfect. The only change I made was using a Ground Turkey/Ground Pork mixture instead. The extra steps to this delicious meatloaf recipe are all very worth it. You won't be disappointed. Big hit with the entire family! I will absolutely be making this again... and again!

This was delicious!!!! Definitely the best meatloaf I've ever tasted. My husband and kids really liked it too. I didn't have evaporated milk so I used regular whole milk and I was worried it'd be too spicy for my kids so I didn't add in the hot pepper sauce. Still delicious. Will be my new recipe now; I already had a good one but this brings so much more flavor!

I really enjoyed this meatloaf with a little unexpected extra flavor and kick. I increased the amount of cayenne since we like things pretty spicy at our house. I chose Cholula Chipotle for the pepper sauce and it was perfect, added just a touch of smokey flavor. I made a thin sauce layer for the top with ketchup, worcestershire, brown sugar, ground yellow mustard, and more hot sauce. Thanks for the recipe! I will definitely make this again.

I have never like meatloaf before, actually I hated it, but given the reviews, I decided to give it a go. And I'm so glad that I did! I do tweak the recipe a bit according to taste and what we usually have in the house, such as leaving out the sausage and just using all ground beef, subbing yellow onion for green, 2% milk for evap. and cayenne pepper for hot pepper sauce. Good eatin' :) UPDATE: I whipped up a batch of this meatloaf and formed it into patties for homemade hamburgers. Let me just say that I will never crave another restaurant burger again!! Delicious!!

I LOVE this recipe.  Thanks for sharing Bill.  The only thing I do differently is for one, I spray my baking dish with cooking spray.  It makes it much easier to serve and clean.  I put my andouille or chorizo (which ever one is on sale) in the food processor to grind it up, then mix in a bowl with ground TURKEY and the eggs, etc.  It's so yummy. One of my husband's favorites!

My boyfriend gave this a 4, but I had to round up :) This was the best meatloaf I've ever had! I completely forgot to add the bayleaves, I used red pepper instead of green (personal preference), and I didn't have any sausage so I used 2lb beef. This meatloaf is so moist and spicy. It takes a long time to make, so I won't make it on week days anymore, but it's totally worth the time. We had it on sandwiches for breakfast the next day - delicious! Thanks so much, this is a keeper!

I made this several years ago and lost the recipe. At the time I made it for my husband and his work crew who went nuts for it.   So glad to have found it again as he has been asking for it over the years.   While it is a lot of work, it's totally worth the effort. I didn't change a thing to the original recipe.

Awesome... I substituted mild italian sausage for andouille and fit the entire loaf into a 5 x 9 pan.  I had to pour off a little grease after baking and blot the loaf with a paper towel before slicing, but after that the appearance, taste and texture was out of this world!  I served with garlic mashed red potatoes.  Thanks Bill... I am making again later this week.  This has become my favorite meatloaf, and hence, my only meatloaf.

I made this the other night & it was so good!  The texture turned out fine for me, was not mushy like someone else stated.  I made it just like it said to, but wasn't sure about the sausage, so I bought regular ground sausage & it worked great.  It is pretty spicy, but the three of us loved it!  This will be a regular in our house now I'm sure.

Wonderful!  Made this with 1 pound beef and 1 pound hot Italian sausage.  It was spicy and delicious.  Note: I didn't have evaporated milk, so I just reduced 1 cup whole milk by 1/2 on the stovetop.  This was perfect with simple mashed potatoes and a citrusy arugula salad.

THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!!! My husband's 2nd favorite dinner  is meatloaf and the poor guy... he's claimed to love my last 3  pitiful attempts at it. lol This one however is now a keeper!  The whole thing was just perfect, from the texture, to the flavor,  and even simplicity! I followed instructions to a T except I didnt  have any cumin or white pepper, so i substituted more black pepper  for each, added one diced jalapeno, and for bread crumbs used  crushed seasoned croutons. For the top of the loaf I glazed on a  mix of ketchup, worstershire(sp?) sauce,and brown sugar when I put  the loaf in, and let it carmelize. Also, I didn't open the oven  door no matter how badly I wanted to! lol

This was great for dinner and super great the next day fried in olive oil for sandwiches.  Loved the sandwiches!!!  The only change I made was to leave out the green peppers, doubled the amount of onions and used hot Italian sausage.  I also used regular milk since I didn't have evaporated and I don't think it made any difference.  Next time I make this I am going to make two loaves and freeze one to have on hand for sandwiches.  Thanks submitter.

This is THE ONE!  Ive been searching for an awesome meatloaf recipe and here it is!!  The only change I made was using all beef as I dont care for pork.  I love to bake so this works well for me, forming it on the baking sheet gives it that hard edged texture I love but I also try them in a muffin tin for 30min on 400.  UPDATE: Ive been making this for years now and while trying to eat healthier I altered this recipe by using ground turkey and turkey kielbasa. I was worried at first it wouldnt come out as flavorful but its delicious!!  GREAT recipe!!

Thank you, reviewers, for ideas for substitutions and to Bill for the excellent original recipe. Made this last night and it was delicious. Mostly followed the recipe except for using 2% milk, "cajun blend" seasoning, added nutmeg, used mortar-ground cumin and cilantro seeds, oil instead of butter, and a mix of panko and oatmeal. After cooking down the vegetable and liquid mixture (what a good idea!) and letting it cool, I mixed the 2 beaten eggs directly into the vegetables before adding the whole thing to the meat mixture. Like others, my andouille was partly cooked, making it hard to crumble; I skinned as much as possible then chopped it with a hand blender (thanks for that idea, too). Mixed it all in a large bowl rather than in a baking dish, turned it out onto a cutting board to shape it into the flat loaf, then transferred it to the grill rack for my toaster over. The fat then dripped into the foil placed in the pan for easy cleanup. Let it sit for 15 minutes, then sliced it. Great texture, great flavor. It's still a 5-star recipe, even if you fiddle with it a bit.

This was so good.  I was nervous that my family would not like it because it is an untraditional recipe for meatloaf.  I took the chance and I'm glad I did.  Everyone loved it, even my daughter.  The next day I made grilled sandwiches with it, which was even better. I couldn't find the sausage that the recipe called for so I just used Jimmy Dean Hot sausage and it was really good.

We LOVE this meatloaf! I like it as is- it has a Great kick to it. It is a little too spicy for my boyfriend so I make a brownsugar/ketchup/worchestshire sauce glaze for him and then he scarfs it down. I kind of like the mixture of sweet and spicy with it too but its great as is as well.  The only thing i did differently was a little more onion and bell pepper than called for and I used Spicy italian sausage per other reviews. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was good! I used ground turkey and chicken andouille sausage and olive oil instead of butter. It was a little time consuming removing the casings, but other that that, it was not difficult to make. I also formed the loaf on a large grilling pan so that any fatty juices would run off. So the meatloaf was perfect and not greasy like others seemed to have. Good &amp spicy. Thanks!

This was a GREAT tasting meat loaf.  Very different from all other meatloaves I've had in the past.  One word of caution, everytime I ate this (leftovers included) I got heartburn!  Be sure you have some Tums on hand!

This recipe is pretty good, but it needs a few tweaks before I make it again.  I HIGHLY recommend that you pay heed to reviews left by others.  For example, use italian sausage instead of andouille sausage (or NO sausage), cook the meatloaf on a rack in the dish so that it is not so greasy and leave out the cumin.  if you like it REALLY spicy, use "hot link sausage" instead of andouille sausage, but be ready for EXTRA greasy meatloaf.

This recipe made an excellent meatloaf.  I like spicy meatloaf and had been using a can of Rotelle tomatoes in my basic meatloaf recipe, but the spices in this recipe were great.  I was out of bay leaves, and I had ground pork rather than the sausage it called for, but it turned out great. I also used 1% milk rather than evaporated, and it seemed to be fine.  I still like catsup on my meatloaf, though. It was great on this, served with smashed potatoes and baby peas.

I must say that I was a bit skeptical about a meatloaf that was baked in a 13x9 inch pan.  It was more like a meatcake than meatloaf.  But what absolute terrific flavor!  I couldn't find andouille so I substituted hot pork sausage and it tasted great but I am going to keep searching for andouille because Emerill always talks about it so it must be great.  I think that next time I am going to bake it in a loaf pan though, the sides and a bit of the underside were burnt which was a bit of a turn off.  Make this with some mashed potatoes and crusty roll and you will be the star of the evening!

"Now dat's-a-spicey-meatloaf". It was wonderful even though I had to make a low salt version of it! I used all ground beef instead of the andouille sausage. (dang) I omitted the salt. I used cracker meal instead of dried bread crumbs. (lower salt) and only used 1 teaspoon instead of tablespoon of worcestershire. And it was STILL the best meatloaf we have ever had! Yum!

I love this dish and have made it many times. Play around with it a bit. I use pre-mixed cajun spices and put in five teaspoons (I like it hot!). I also use fresh milk because there's never any evaporated milk in the house. I also use less milk than the recipe suggests and cook the tomato sauce/milk mixture quite a long time to reduce it to a thick paste. In place of andouille sausage I also use ordinary pork sausage. Of course, the way I make it, the kids won't touch it, so there's more for me!

I omitted the evaporated milk but added 2 teaspoons of sugar to balance out the taste, so the meatloaf didn't turn out meshy.  Didn't add the sausage either 'cos I couldn't get hold of any.  Great taste and good texture anyway.

My husband loved this meatloaf. I, however, found it to be on the spicy side. Next time I would use a teaspoon of hot sauce instead of a tablespoon. Also, I used Italian sausage instead of the recommended sausages.

Overall, a good meatloaf recipe.  Had a nice "zip", but not much heat (IMHO).  I read all of the reviews and added some changes of my own.  Here's what I did: a) substituted red bell pepper for the green one called for (since so many reviewers warned about the "heat factor", I thought a red pepper would  tame the heat as red peppers are sweeter than green ones), b) substituted ground chorizo for andouille (the andouille I found was very firm, not crumbly) and c) patted the meatloaf mixture into a loaf pan instead of a 9x13 inch pan.  As far as preparation goes, there are a couple of things to note.  First, my veggie mixture took WAY longer to cook down than the recipe directed (i.e. to form a thick paste).  I ended up cooking the mixture over medium, then very high heat for at least 15 minutes (this was after adding the milk and katsup).  I still had to drain off some of the oil after that, but otherwise seemed fine.  Second, the veggie reduction does take a while to cool, so be sure to allow time for it.  Finally, WATCH YOUR LOAF!  Mine came out a bit burnt on top, but not too bad.  Perhaps covering it with foil (at least part of the cooking time) would eliminate this?  Served with au gratin potatoes on the side, but would also go well with mac & cheese (I served left-overs with mac).  Thanks for sharing!

Yum, Yum, Yum.  Meatloaf is a staple in our house, and this was a awesome twist on an overplayed favorite.  Not mushy, not too spicy (but definitely has a good kick - we love spicy food!)  I followed the recipe almost exactly, increasing the cooking time for the vegetables just a bit and used a spicy andouille sausage.  I'm a total amateur in the kitchen, so it did take me quite a bit longer to prepare this than stated, but it was well worth the effort and the directions were easy enough for me to follow.  Served with "Cajun Sweet Potatoes" from allrecipes, green beans, and Banana's Foster for dessert.  Got a "wow!" from everyone!  Thank you for posting this, will make again and again.

This meatloaf was outstanding.  The first time I made it, because my andoiulle sausage came partially cooked, it was hard to crumble.  The next time I made it with Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage, much easier to crumble, and it tasted just as good!  Note to review readers: make sure your veggie mix is cooked into a nice thick paste before mixing with the meat, or you will have a mushy loaf!  Also, if you have little ones like we do, cut the recipe in half, and make one half with a little less spice, recipe as is is a little too spicy for kids...

Truth be told, I'm a meatloaf junkie.  I LOVE meatloaf.  I also hate spicy food. But my cousin made this recipe for me when I visited her in Texas and I immediately asked for the recipe.  This is the BEST MEATLOAF EVER. I has a heck of a kick.  Too much for my cousin...she says she wouldn't make it again. I, however, have made this several times since that visit.  I absoltely love it!!!  In fact, I'm about to make it again for the girls at work to try out.  This is GREAT STUFF!

I took a chance and made this for the first time, on the reviews alone, for a new boy "friend" ... and we both loved it.  It has the perfect heat/flavor combo, and was awesome served with mashed potatoes and green beans.  I didn't change one thing about the recipe.  Would definitely make again.  My only warning -- you have to let the veggie mixture cool before finishing out the meatloaf and putting it in the oven, so you might want to plan some extra time for that.

It's not often that I feel compelled to write a review of anything.  But this meatloaf is incredible.  It's easily become our households favorite meal!  It is quite spicy but my partner who does not like spicy foods (nor meatloaf) adores it.  Lots of flavor!  Very moist, sort of the antithesis to (dry, boring) meatloaf.  I love it and continue to cook it a couple of times a month.

I left out the green onions, green peppers, used a little less of the hot spices, and used italian sausage. It was so good! My boyfriend loved it and he's a little picky. It was a little greasy from all the sausage so the next time I made it I used turkey sausage and there was no difference in taste. I also baked it on a small rack in the pan. You lose a little off the bottom of the loaf but it is worth it not to have it swimming in grease.

This was yummy.  We all liked it but i'm only giving it a four rating because I probably won't make it again unless my husband asks me too.  I left out the cayenne pepper to make it less spicy for my toddler and she ate it and liked it.  It needs some sort of sauce over the top too.  Maybe hotsauce mixed with ketcup?

Fun to make....so full of great spices along with onions, garlic, and green pepper. The flavor is wonderful and has created wonderful leftovers for sandwiches! Quite a bit of heat from the spices, but that is what makes it GREAT!

Yum! I hate meatloaf, but I loved this! I made it for my boyfriend, a spicy food fanatic, and he thought it was great too. I added a little more hot sauce the second time I made it, to add more hotness. I definitely recommend waiting a while before taking it out of the pan. I used panco for the bread part; you can find it at Ouwajimiya (sp?), it is also good for breading.

Really tasty, my new favorite meatloaf.  I went with a full pound of andouille, worked out great.  The spice sneaks up on you, but it's worth it for sure.  Thanks for a well put-together recipe.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe. It was good but not as good to me as I had expected from the reviews. It is an expensive dish by the time you buy the beef and the sausage, and to me, it just wasn't worth the extra expense.

Very tasty recipe.  I didn't change a thing.  I might try with pork instead of  sausage next time(I used chorizo), it was a tiny bit greasy for me.  It was definitely spicey hot- I might cut down a bit on the heat(cayenne) next time, but the other spices tasted great.

I'm always looking for a new take on one of my favorites, meatloaf.  This did not let me down.  Lots of flavor.  Just a bit too spicy for my family but I'll just decrease the hot sauce and/or cayenne next time around.

I finally found a meatloaf with plenty of flavor.  My husband really loved it, but we both feel it could be just a little less spicy-hot.  Will cut down on the heat spices a bit next time.  Made great sandwiches on bulkie rolls with provolone melted on top.

This was the best meatloaf and I don't like meatloaf! I omitted the green peppers and onions and added some roasted garlic to it. I also made 2 loaves in the 9x13 pan so it would cook quicker and it turned out wonderful. Thanks Bill!

This was very good and I don't like meatloaf.  I omitted the green pepper due to a picky husband and I used hot Italian sausage, other than that, followed the recipe and cooking time.

Very good recipe. I made a few changes due to availability and lowering fat. I used canola oil instead of butter (and only 2 TB, not 4 TB). I used quick-cooking oats instead of bread. I used mild sausage instead of adouille and a very small amount of chipolte powder instead of cayenne pepper. (The latter substitutions due to what I had on hand.) I like the changes I made, but would probably put in even less chipolte powder next time (just one shake instead of three). The outcome was good, but a shade  too spicy for my taste. 
I agree with those who suggest waiting 15 minutes before cutting into the meatloaf.

I really liked this!! It definately had that wonderful Cajun flavor, but my husband just thought it was OK, even though he loves Cajun food. I would recommend greasing the pan because with mine, the bottom of the meatloaf stuck to it.

I accidentally bought smoked andoulle sausage so I cut it in small pieces and used cajun seasoning because I did not have all the spices on hand. I was skeptical but hopeful and it turned out great. I still had to make my favorite meatloaf sauce to put on top (ketchup, brown sugar and hotsauce) and it was even better on sanwhiches the next day . I melted swiss cheese on slices of meatloaf and slapped it on some toast (with the sauce) mmmm. Oh and the recipe says make it into a LOAF in the pan, not spread it out to cover the pan, some of the reviews questioned the pan size.I will make it again for sure.

I really liked this recipe. I had to change a couple of things due to ingredients on hand. I used 2% milk and italian sausage. I didn't have any nutmeg and I don't like green peppers so I left them out.

I had 2.5 pounds of meat thawed so I used it all and the amount worked well for a 9x13 pan.  I increased the amount of spices but not by a huge amount. I can imagine this would have been too spicy if I had done the math correctly.

It had a great flavor and not too much of a difference from regular meatloaf but enough to make it interesting. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes. My husband really liked it too. I will definitely be making this again.

Fabulous!  The andouille sausage at my local Harris Teeter butcher counter doesn't have a casing that can be removed.  It's also very firm so I pulverize it in a food processor and then add it to the ground beef.  Though I love the recipe as is, it's too spicy for my kids so I now cut way back on the cayenne and hot pepper sauce (andouille sausage has enough of a kick on its own).  Thanks for the recipe, Bill!

Between the chopping and simmering of vegetables and pulling the casing off the andouille sausages, this recipe was much more effort than the typical meatloaf recipe.  In the end, it was tasty although a bit too hot for even this Southern Californian.  I think in a west coast Thai restaurant this would rate a 4 or 5 in spiciness from a scale of 1 to 10.  We tend to like it in the 3 to 4 range.  So it was a bit hot for us.  Definitely hotter than your taco bell fast food type hot sauce.

Still looking for a great all-American tender, tasty meatloaf for those days when we want comfort food -- but this is good for variety.

P.S. My husband took some to work the next day and RAVED about the taste but said he couldn't take any more from this loaf because it was too hot.  Looking forward to making it again without so much cayenne pepper next time.

I have a bit of a cold so I could not taste all the flavors in this, but my parents both said it tasted great.  The only change I made was to use some crushed ritz crackers, but only because I didn't have enough bread crumbs.  I will definately make this recipe again.

I made this for my neighbor after she had surgery and couldn't move around a lot.  Maybe it was just because she couldn't cook herself (and wanted free food!) but she said this was really scrummy.  Her 10 year old son even liked it, which I was surprised about because it's just a wee bit spicy (too spicy for me!)  The only thing I found difficult was the pan suggestion.  It came out a little flat, I think next time I would stuff it all in a standard loaf pan - other than that it was primo delish!

This recipe was great I served it to my family and they loved it I thought it was a tad bit on the spicy side so I made some stewed tomatoes with sugar and balsimic vinegar to serve on the side.  I didn't make any other changes.  And the loaf came out so moist It was the best and only non-failed meatloaf I made.  I did put strips of bacon on top to keep the top from cracking.  My boyfriend loved it! he said it was just the right amount of seasoning.

My husband LOVED this.  Normally he won't even touch meatloaf.  However, the kids thought it was too spicy.

I NEVER liked meatloaf until I made this. I use more breadcrumbs, and substitute ground pork instead of the sausage. This is now a family favorite! GREAT RECIPE! Thanks

very flavorful... but perhaps a TINY bit too hot... would decrease intensity just a little next time... but definitely a hit!

This recipe is all the good things that other reviewers said.  Only difference I made: had only 2% milk, ordinary sausage - used what I had but otherwise followed recipe exactly.  This will replace my regular (good) recipe.  Thanks.

A little background:  My mom is an amazing cook, but her normal meatloaf contains cheese, which my husband hates.  I found this tasty recipe, which we absolutely love.  I passed the recipe on to my mother, who served it to the rest of my family.  My grandmother lovingly attempted to compliment her, "This makes your meatloaf taste like s**t!"

This meatloaf is delicious.. Just leave out the sausage and the evaporated milk and the nutmeg. I also added a teaspoon of chili powder. Everyone loved it.

This is my go to recipe, but isn’t this Paul Prudomme’s recipe? In any case it’s a good charge from the more bland traditional meatloaf recipe. And it does make great sandwiches the next day.

I'm from Louisiana and I always laugh at how some recipes don't live up to the "Cajun" name, and have to say this was amazing.  It had the perfect amount of spice to it and full of flavor.  I followed it to the tee and was not disappointed. I had to cook it another 5 minutes and it came out cooked to perfection.  My Husband hates meatloaf but every time I make this he can't get enough. Can't wait to make it again!

I love this recipe. I found this recipe in Chef Paul Prudhomme's cookbook  The meatloaf has a nice kick.  You can adjust the heat by changing the amount of cayenne pepper you use.  There is a sauce you can add, but for my family adds more heat than we can handle.  It's been a favorite for years.

Made this for the family last night. I didn't know they avoided Meatloaf like the plaque. By the time all was said and done, THERE WERE NO LEFTOVERS!! So much for meatloaf sandwiches this week for work.
Minor changes to the original recipe. Peppers were omitted. Heavy cream was substituted for evap milk. Since we don't care for ketchup, I used tomato sauce. I could not find andouille (whatever that is) sausage so I used 1lb Jimmy Dean's Hot Pork Sausage. 3 eggs since what I had were rather small. The bread crumbs were a combination of stale salines & rolled oats.
Overall- It was fabulous. I need to work on the consistency. I didn't think it held together as well as I had hoped. NOT A COMPLAINT. I seldom get meatloaf to hold well.
This is definitely a keeper.

This is definitely a good meatloaf.  Although I did not have any nutmeg and I used crackers instead of the bread crumbs, it turned out just fine.  The spice is good....not too much at all.  Will make this again!

Well, my BF'S favorite meatloaf USED to be Paula Deen's Bacon Cheeseburger Meatloaf, but now he says he likes this one even better!  We both like spicy food, and we agreed that the surface crunch is what really makes this one stand out. (You should definately place the loaf on a baking rack, as this promotes a lot of grease). I did forget to buy some green onions for this, so just used 1 cup chopped regular onion, and when I reached for the nutmeg I was out of it! So I don't know what the nutmeg might have added to it, but it didn't appear to need it.  This will be made many, many times!

Very tsty.  I did save myself a step by not frying the vegetables.  There really isn't a need to because, they are going to cook in the loaf anyways.  I'm looking forward to some great meatloaf sandwiches.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I never thought I'd love meatloaf so much.  I used another reviewer's suggestion for a glaze - 1 cup ketchup, 1 tb brown sugar, 1 tb worcestershire.

My boyfriend and I just made this for the first time.  We used tabasco and found it a little spicy and next time will try a milder pepper sauce.  This is replacing our plain old boring meatloaf.  We absolutely love this recipe!

This is a very tasty meatloaf! We made it twice, and will definitively make it again!  Notes: Remove meatloaf from the cooking pan promptly, and place it either on a rack or paper towel, to let access juices, etc, out.

OK. Expected better from all the reviews.  I followed the suggestions of lowering the spice factor for kids. (I cut the hot spices in half)  Definitely heat spices/milk mixture until a thick paste before adding to meat.  Also allow allow to stand 15 minutes before serving or it will fall apart.  May try it again, but will keep  my Dads recipe.

Wonderful!  I talked my husband into eating this (he hates meatloaf, but was curious about the cajun aspect) and now he's addicted!  He can't wait for lunch tomorrow to put it on a sandwich.

I followed the recipe exactly except I cooked it on a broiler pan as others described to prevent it from being too greasy.

Neither my husband or I are huge meatloaf fans, but I still wanted to try a meatloaf recipe.  We liked the blend of spices...a bit unusual.  Would have prefered another sausage instead of andouille. Still not huge meatloaf fans, but we didnt dislike this dish.  Will not make again though.

A real keeper for a change on meatloaf. I used hot sausage & want to try with regular andouille sausage so you can taste the other spices more. My husband loved this.

Very good!  I used half ground turkey and half ground sirloin and no sausage,  The turkey made it very tender and not at all hard like some other mestloaves..  I served fried potatoes and onions on the side.  It was great and not too spicy to us!  Will definitely add this to my menu

This was a big hit with my kids, who as a general rule don't even like meatloaf. "It's got a nice zip" as one of my sons said.  Three of us ate it all up in 2 meals.  I used chorizo instead of andouille sausage (chopped it in the blender first) and cut back a little on the hot sauce, maybe a teaspoon instead of a tablespoon.  It was plenty hot though.  If you like hot foods, this recipe is very tasty!

This was really really good. It wasn't hot enough for us, so next time we'll add more hot sauce and cayenne. I used oats instead of bread crumbs and 2 T of olive oil instead of butter. And turkey instead of beef. Everything else remained the same. Delicious!
I didn't give it a 5 because it was more time consuming than I would expect from a meatloaf.

I made this for my father's birthday, as a joke.  (Well, Dad, I knew you didn't already have this...)  It has since become "The Traditional Birthday Meatloaf."

I didn't change a thing.

YUMMY!  I was given permission by my  hubby to make it again.  I didn't have evaporated milk nor the andoullie sausage, instead i used italian sausage.  I used bread crumbs and instant oatmeal.  Probably add more spices and hot sauce than i should of, but it still came out yummy!

This was the best meatloaf I have ever had!  I personally don't care for meatloaf, but I decided to make this one and WOW! was it good!  My boys went back for seconds, they probably would have gone back for more, but it was all gone!  (I fed 7 people) I omitted the onions, bell peppers, and green onions, the cumin, nutmeg, and the sausage ONLY because I didn't have any of those ingredients here at the time.  I used 2% milk instead of the evaporated and I added 1 tsp. of Cajun Seasoning mix. It was wonderful!  I will definately make it again.

This was so good! We used chorizo sausage instead and just a little less cayenne pepper (3/4 t)because I was afraid it was going to be too spicy. It turned out just right and we will definitely be making this again. Thanks so much for sharing!

All I can say is WOW!!!  My husband HATES meatloaf but had three helpings of this one!  The only changes I made was to tone down the spice a little so my four year old could eat it and I made it in two loaf pans and froze one.  It was moist, flavourful and easy!  A true keeper!
Thanks Bill!

I just made this for my mother-in-law for mother’s day.  What a wonderful twist on an old favorite. While I wouldn't serve this to my toddler, (much too spicy) the rest of my family really enjoyed it.  I had absolutely no problems making this recipe. I found the Andouille sausage was carried by AJ's here in Arizona, and I would suggest getting an extra link to make sure you have half a pound AFTER you remove the casings or it might be a bit soggy.  
I served it with some corn on the cob and it complimented the spicy dish very well! 
Thanks for the recipe Bill, I will make this again and again!

Mmm. Mmm. Good.  I would lighten up on the spice a bit, unless you really like it super spicy.  Otherwise, it was fantastic.

Awesome spicy meatloaf! I couldn't find andouille here in the southwest, so I used chorizo instead. Also, I didn't care for the way it sagged and cracked  in the pan, so the second time I packed everything into two loaf pans to cook. Perfect!

I used pork instead of the andouille sausage (was going to make a boring meatloaf until I ran across this recipe).  This is absolutely the best meatloaf recipe I have ever made!!  I love the spicy seasoning and can't imagine going back to 'normal' meatloaf.  Thanks so much!

Was very excited to try this but won't give it a 5-star rating.  Loved the flavors and spice but thought it TOO GREASY, too bread crumby and too mushy even after standing for 5 min out of the oven (we like our meatloaf more 'meaty' - add less/no bread crumbs!).  I am sure this will be delicious when cold.  Recommend this set for at least 15 min and not the suggested 5 minutes.  It was still way too mushy.  As it achieved room temp it was perfect consistency.  Surprisingly, no one raved about it and everyone at our Halloween dinner party ate other things that were offered; we practically had a full loaf left!

This is a great alternative to bland meatloaf!  I did not use sausage and cut down on some of the milk.  I also use a meatloaf pan to cut down on some of the grease and use a high-quality ground beef (90% lean).  My husband adores this and asks for it every week.  It's a little too spicy for the kids though.

This recipe sounded so delicious!  It did taste great, but we couldn't eat it.  It was so soggy, you couldn't even cut it with a knife...it just fell apart.  I even tried cooking it twice as long as the directions stated.  I am not sure how they would eat this down in Cajun country, but this is not what I would call meatloaf.  More like, meatmush.

No complaints here.  I used venison with homemade venison habanero sausage.  I also cut the cayenne in half and used regular milk since I didn't have condensed.  I also recommend Frank's hot sauce, it's not over powering.  

The result was very tasty.  I pulled it out early, 150 degrees because I was worried about it drying out.  Nice hearty meal on a cold New England day.

Tasted good and a pleasant spiciness to it but a little to soft. Will try again but probably with extra breadcrumbs.

Hands down the best meatloaf I ever made. It has a kick, which I like, but if others like it a bit milder, cut the cayenne pepper and hot sauce in half. Served with mashed potatoes and your favorite green and you'll have a Sunday night dinner you'll love.

It was very, very good. I had stopped making meatloaf because of the bland flavor even with french onion soup mix. But I had some deer sausage and looked for a recipe when I found this and read the reviews. I cut the recipe in half because there are only 2 of us.  I didn't have white pepper and just left it out since some comments mentioned it being too spicy and my son occasionally gets heartburn. I also didn't have evaporated milk, so I used coffee creamer instead. To keep from having it cook in it's own grease, I rolled up aluminum foil and set it in the dish to put the meatloaf on top to cook since I don't have a rack that fits in my pans or casserole dish.  About 3 rolls close together so it wouldn't fall.  350 degrees for  25 minutes and 25 min's on 400 degrees. It did fall apart a little when I put it in the serving dish, but that's ok. Next time I'll use 2 eggs. I like some  spice and this was just  right. We really enjoyed it and will make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband loved this recipe. I left out the Cayenne pepper and hot sauce and am happy I did. It was spicy enough. Personally, I thought the amount of baking time was too much. Not sure I'll adjust the temperature up so high next time and will check it frequently so that it doesn't get overdone.

I use 1.5 #'s of lean ground beef and 1# of lean turkey. My son says my meatloaf has gone to an A+ instead of being a D-. That says a lot for this recipe! It makes 2 large loaves so the second night we can have meatloaf sandwiches.

I skipped the sausage simply because I didn’t have it, and it was DELICIOUS. This is definitely the best meatloaf I’ve made, and I can see myself continuing to make it over the years.

This is delicious every time.  I make the recipe exactly as is.  My husband and I were having a dinner party--the number of guests equalled the number of servings.  We doubled it "just in case" and had NO leftovers.   Huge hit.

Excellent meat loaf! Have made it multiple times but after the first time it suits us to drastically reduce the cayenne red pepper. The andouille sausage provides plenty of spice and heat.

This is my favorite meatloaf.  I’ve been making it for at least 10 years and am finally reviewing it.  Hands down, best meatloaf ever.  But it does pack a ton of heat.  Only complaint is that it takes me FOREVER to make it.

I have made this recipe numerous times over the years and it is a family favorite.  I am from South Louisiana and am a proud Cajun through and through.  If you are looking to make a traditional meatloaf, this is not it.  However, it is a wonderful meatloaf and will definitely give you a recipe with some variety.  Please give it a try.  You can adjust the seasonings based on your personal preference.  I have also made it without the sausage and like it that way as well.

The only change I made was omitting the peppers, as my youngest son would have called that a deal breaker.  Other than that, this recipe is spot on and delicious!  A keeper for sure!

I don't add a tablespoon of hot sauce but rather a couple dashes of my husband's hot sauce. Otherwise it is too hot for me. I also use wegman's meatloaf mix along with some sausage patties mixed in. We love this recipe!

Too salty, spicy, and didn't taste like traditional meatloaf.

A lot of work for a meatloaf, but truly tasty enough to be a "special occasion" meal.

We leave out the green onions & substitute Sweet Italian Sausage for the Andouille.  Absolute hit whenever we make it!

Don't let the bland word "meatloaf" fool you--this is spicy and  delicious!  I've been making it (exactly as is) for many years and never have leftovers.  I was cooking for a group not too long ago, and although one meatloaf should've been just enough for the crowd, I made two, just in case.  BOTH got eaten.

this was a very very good meatloaf, had just the right kick to it, served it with mashed garden red potatoes, and long green beans with some unsalted butter and pieces of bacon on top..an excellent recipe that we'll definitely do again. I do the cooking in our home and my Wife gave instructions, DO NOT LOSE this recipe..

First time making meatloaf, I tend to tweak recipes to comport with the ingredients I have on hand and my dietary restrictions, so this recipe was a guide for me and the first thing I did was to change it, and the next time I make it (it was delicious, so I will make it again), I will make additional changes.  I left out the green pepper, scallions, Worcestershire sauce, milk, and sausage, and I used panko instead of breadcrumbs.  Also, I used a "healthy" meatloaf pan, so the fat dripped away from the meat while it was cooking.  My only complaint was that the onion/spice mixture was too mushy, so next time I will try it with dried minced onion instead of a fresh onion and I may use rice instead of panko or bread crumbs.  The seasoning was really perfect, it had a nice kick.  Highly recommend, will definitely make again.  If you're a new cook, remember that meatloaf doesn't have to be exactly according to a recipe.  There's a lot of room to experiment :)

This recipe was incredible.  I couldn't stop eating it.  I made minor changes.  1# ground beef, 1# ground sausage, regular milk instead of evaporated, made mini loaves.  It's the spices that make the recipe.  Don't mess with them.  They're perfect.  There IS a kick to it.  My new favorite meatloaf recipe!

This meatloaf was pretty good and had some good flavors. I had to use chorizo in place of the sausage as I couldn't find any around here. I would adjust the spices just a bit to give it a little more heat but other than that I will make again.

I used 2 teaspoons of Chili Powder instead of the Cayenne, Cumin, and Nutmeg, along with crushed croutons. Kicked it Up!!!  The guys loved it!!

I used minced carrots instead of onions and peppers and used a little less cayenne pepper. My husband said it was the best dinner he has ever eaten. It was truly an outstanding meatloaf. Thank you so much for this recipe!

This is a great meatloaf - stays very moist. I normally use turkey in place of the sausage to keep it on the healthier side.  I'm not crazy about cajun, but my husband asks for this meatloaf all the time!!
