There's a Japanese food/sushi buffet just south of Boston that my husband and I both love and they serve this delicious red snapper that's topped with spicy mayo. I recently bought some red snapper filets, baked them and topped them with this mayo recipe right out of the oven...bingo! Tasted exactly like the restaurant's!

I'm not used to the sesame oil in the sauce, but it kind of smoothed it out and added a nice smell. The sriracha was more than I normally have in it as well, but I like my sushi spicy, so I was not complaining!

I doubled the recipe but added only 3 tsp of Siracha and that was enough! It’s spicy but the sesame oil really adds to the taste. Yummy...thanks for the base recipe!

Definitely add less sesame oil and more sriracha if you want it spicy and more accurate to a restaurant. It’s good though!

Outstanding! For my kids, I used a little less siracha but I prefer it just as specified in the recipe. Identical  to our local sushi bar.

Tastes weird. This is my fav dish at sushi places. Ive even been to japan. This is NOT good. Not even close. Siracha is a mistake. Maybe try a japanese or korean sauce.

Excellent. The sesame oil was a really nice touch. I didn't have sriracha on hand so I used tabasco but will definitely try sriracha next time. My low fodmap diet friend was ecstatic to find spicy mayo she could eat!

Don't limit this to just sushi. The sesame oil adds a nice twist.
