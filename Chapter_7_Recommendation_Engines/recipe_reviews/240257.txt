This is a good way to use up the stalks of your cauliflower (or even broccoli would work). I didn't have bacon drippings so I used lard. I bet that coconut oil would go nicely here too. I've made soups out of the stalks before and never really cared for it, but with these ingredients, it works. Thanks for the recipe.

Texture was not very pleasant and taste was ok. Could skimp a little on the spinach and add some cream cheese for better flavor. We added some bacon as a topping with the sour cream.

This recipe is genius!  I followed instructions exactly, but also added some  chopped celery, and roasted the stems, leaves, onions and celery before adding to bacon drippings. Results were delicious. I don't know if this will appeal to all tastes, however.  You must enjoy pur√©ed soups, and love cruciferous veggies. If you do, and are a fan of getting the most from your healthy foods by using every bit, this will not disappoint.
