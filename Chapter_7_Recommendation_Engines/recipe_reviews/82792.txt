I actually used this as a sauce to sautee chicken, mushrooms and scallions in.  I steamed asparagus and served it all over whole wheat linguini.  I did make a few tweeks, added some lemon juice, seasoned rice vinegar, a little bit of garlic infused and oil and two cloves of garlic.  I put it all in my mini food processor and used about a 1/4 of it for the sautee-ing then added the rest right before serving.  Next time I would add cornstarch or the like to thicken the sauce up, because it was DELICIOUS!!!!  I will make again and again, especially with the mushrooms, asparagus and scallions, perfect combo!

Wonderful! Added 1 teaspoon of sugar, but just great. Really easy (I keep grated ginger in my freezer, so had everything at the ready).

This sauce has good flavor but it is way too salty if you use that amount of soy sauce. However, if you use a little less and a low-sodium soy sauce it is tasty. I also added approx 3 tsp sugar and 2 tsp honey, sesame seeds, green onion, 1 more tablespoon of water and a little cornstarch and marinated the chicken in part of the sauce before grilling. Hope this helps.

This sauce was very salty.  I added a little extra water, some honey and some actual sesame seeds.  I used it to marinate chicken and then grill it.  The chicken was fabulous, great flavor!  I also stir fried some veggies in the sauce as well, and they were also good.  I think I can find many options for this yummy sauce.

Sorry, just didn't care for this at all...too much dijon and too much soy sauce.  I tweaked it to make it work for dinner, but won't be making this again.

This recipe, while slightly salty, is quite tasty. Its also very good when tossed with lo-mein noodles, chicken, and vegetables... which makes for a nice quick meal.

I tried this sauce as a chicken marinade. I had several pieces of chicken to do so naturally I adjusted the recipe. As is, it was horribly salty. I even used low sodium soy sauce. I doctored it up with honey, brown sugar, and orange juice just to make it edible. I'm sorry but I will not be using this sauce again.

Excellent as is. I added a little bit of honey and chili flakes for some extra kick.

Added a little rice vinegar and used as an Asian-style slaw dressing.  Rave reviews!
