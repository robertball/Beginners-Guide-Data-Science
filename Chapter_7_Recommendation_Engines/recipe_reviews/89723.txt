This was always my husband's favorite comfort food.  I didn't quite get it (bland, blah) but after trying MANY recipes, I'm a believer after this one.  I had to change a few things as to what I had on hand.  I was trying to use up mashed potatoes so I added 1 T. of garlic powder and the 1 t. oregano to the meat mixture.  Only had 12 oz. frozen corn and the tomato sauce had jalapenos in it.  Had 6oz. Feta that I sprinkled over the meat mixture then frosted it all in a 9x13 dish with about an inch of mashed potatoes (at room temp. to ease spreading).  Next time, I'll add chives or parsley for color and sprinkle paprika on top.  This was SO tasty.  I know it is my husband's favorite but he ate almost half of the whole dish himself.  This will be the only recipe we use now.  Thank you!!!

YUMMY!  I omitted the diced tomatoes since I do not care for them, used frozen mixed veggies instead of canned, and used two packages of "Simply Potatoes" mashed potatoes instead of making them from scratch.  I also added shredded mozzerella to the potato mixture before baking and it was awesome!  My husband does not like veggies and he had seconds.  I will definitely make again.

This was very easy to prepare and very good to eat. I would recommend using a deep dish for baking as it over flowed in the oven. I used ground turkey as suggested.

Way beyong the 10 minute cooking time for the potatoes, even though I peeled and quartered mine. Now after rereading the recipe I'm assuming the skins are left on and the potatoes are the little baby reds. I think the potato directions are sketchy (particularly for a novice cook). If you are on any kind of dinner schedule, you need to adjust your timetable accordingly.

The meat/vegetable mixture of this recipe makes a lot. I added a large handful of matchstick carrots when I sauteed the onion and garlic and canned corn in place of the mixed veggies. When I made the potato mixture, I used half potato, half cauliflower. Other than that, I made no other changes. The potato portion of this recipe was enough to cover half of the meat mixture in one of my circular casserole dishes. I plan on freezing the other half and using on a busier day. Let's hope the boys like this one!

I modified this recipe to my family.  I used ground turkey, substituted Mrs. Dash for salt and left out the rosemary. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Sending some to my daughter in college. It was that good.

I will make this often.  The potatoes were delicious!  I used frozen corn (thawed) and 1 can of Italian green beans (drained) instead of the mixed veggies and added extra garlic.  Great comforting meal!

I usually use a shepherd's pie recipe with cream of mushroom soup, but wanted to try something different. I don't think I'll ever go back, this is quite good.

I did make a number of changes, as follows:

- I cut the whole recipe in half and used an 8x8 casserole dish.

- I used Italian turkey sausage instead of ground beef (as suggested by others). This gives it a great flavor.

- I tried to get rid of some of the grease from the ground turkey before adding the tomato sauce and veggies.

- I omitted the can of diced tomatoes (I'm a bit peculiar about where I like my tomatoes and shepherd's pie is not one of them).

- Instead of the canned vegetables, I used fresh asparagus, red bell pepper, and mushrooms. I really enjoyed this combination.

- I steamed the potatoes instead of boiling them (heard this keeps in more of the nutrients) - this increased the cooking time to 20 minutes.

- I added some feta cheese to the potato mixture; I don't know if this had much effect on the final product.

- I used the water from the boiled potatoes instead of milk (healthier).

- I didn't broil it at the end (my broiler is frustrating - separate from the main oven - didn't seem worth it).

Overall, I really enjoyed this. And it's a super easy recipe. Definitely a keeper!

This is a great basic recipe that can be easily altered to your taste! In my most recent version, I used fresh vegetables (peas and green beans), diced them and sauteed them in a bit of olive oil in a skillet before adding them to the beef. After the beef was browned, I added 1/2 cup of red wine and reduced the mixture until most of the liquid was evaporated. Then I mixed in the vegetables and herbs. This added a lot of flavour.

Wow this was an easy quick dinner to make and serve.  I used a mix of cheeses that I had left over in the fridge and it was great.  Thanks for a great recipe :)

Tried and true.  I use this recipe every time.  Rosemary was the missing ingredient in my old Shepherd's Pie recipe.  Sometime instead of the Garlic Romano Potatoes, I use plain mashed or sometimes hashbrowns.  Good any way you choose.

This is a great basic recipe that you can easily customize. I put mushrooms, black olives and green peppers in with the meat---since I did not have any vegetables. And my husband added hot peppers to his. Great recipe---thank you.

The rosemary was a little too prominant for my taste, and it was a little dry.  A gravy might solve both those problems.  But it got decent reviews from the family, and the romano potatoes were delicious, even though I used boxed garlic mashed potatoes as a shortcut, so it is worth playing with.  I may try Shepherd's Pie V with the romano poatoes.

This was pretty good! The potatoes really do make this dish. I followed the recipe except I used parmesan instead of romano cheese and italian seasoning instead of oregano and basil. I love that you can put all those veggies in and still get my toddler to eat it up! Try adding a layer of shredded cheese under the potatoes.

This was really good! I made this because hubs had dental work done and wanted something soft. Really pleased. I made 4 crocks (the kind with the tops by Corning). I put 2 in the freezer for another time. I followed the recipe only I used frozen mixed vegetables. Thank you!

I only used the potatoes from this recipe based on the rave reviews from others, and used the meat recipe from "Shepherd's Pie VI" on this site...  it came out AMAZING!!  My boyfriend loved the garlic potatoes paired with the meat.  He said it was even better than the authentic shepherd's pie that he ate IN Ireland!!  I recommend the garlic potatoes 100%!!

Love this recipe! I have made a couple of times now. Opted to use parmesian cheese rather than romano and that has worked out fine. Made to recipe otherwise. Give this one a try!

Great twist on an old favorite. I used a butternut squash instead of potatoes (more fiber and nutrients and it cooks up to have the exact some texture with more flavor). Next time I will cut the garlic in half, however. We love garlic but this was just a little too much! Very easy and very good. I'll make it again.

True, this shepherd's pie is a bit different from what I grew up on but by using frozen veg it came out alright. The potatoes on top of this were FANTASTIC!!!  I was leary of using the amount of garlic it called for so I cut back a bit but will definetely make this next time using the full amount.  Husband enjoyed this a lot and it was much better the next day.

Thanks to the many reviews claiming the potatoes were fantastic and the meat was just "ok", I took some suggestions from a couple of different recipes to improve the meat.  I omitted the rosemary (not a fan of the herb) and added a packet of brown gravy mix and a beef bouillon cube to the water.  I added way more water than called for, hoping to have more gravy, but was still pretty unsuccesful with that.  I only used 15 oz veggies (frozen) and thought that was plenty.  I also added alot more milk to the potatoes to make them easier to spread.  Consistent with most of the reviews, I thought the potatoes were amazing!!  I think I'll continue to look for another recipe for the filling...something with a bit more flavor and a lot more gravy, but will without a doubt use these potatoes.  This was an excellent start though, and my boyfriend devoured it (you're your own worst critic, right?).

Served this for Christmas dinner, 2005.  My family LOVED IT!  It was the talk of the dinner!!!  Everyone wanted seconds and then asked for portions to take home.

The "garlic romano potatoes" are DELICIOUS!!!  Seasonings make this just a scrumptious, scrumptious meal!!!

You can't go wrong trying this recipe.....  !!!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and we loved it.

I ended up baking it in a 9X13 glass pan and it fit perfectly.

I will make this one again for sure, the potatoes were awesome!

Thank you!

I made this for an extended family dinner.  I did make a few alterations to it though.  Instead of Rosemary, I used Italian Seasoning blend and I did not add diced tomatoes. I used frozen veggie blend (corn, carrot, asparagus) instead of canned.  I also added some garlic and red wine to the beef mixture. It was a definite hit and will be added to our go-to meals!

My shepherd's pie from now on! I was leery of the tomato sauce, thinking it would have a Tex Mex look and taste I wasn't going for, but I went with the tomatoes anyway--- in large part because I'm so tired of people reviewing recipes that they alter dramatically. The tomatoes were great! I accidentally over-whipped the potatoes, but the garlic, herbs, and some extra cheese saved me. Delicious! I look forward to trying this with lamb.

Fresh rosemary will make this even more delicious, since dried will feel like you've bitten into a few tiny toothpicks. 

My husband and I love this one. I add a bay leaf or two on top for garnish.

I had limited items at home and did an ingredient search based on things i had in my pantry. This recipe popped up and I'm glad it did. I used a mix of red potatoes and yellow yukon gold, green beans, peas, carrots, corn and mushrooms. then diced tomatoes w/green chilies. Instead of tomato sauce(i didn't have) i used a can of cream of mushroom soup to hold it all together. I used Italian blend cheese in the potatoes. Cooked in a 13x9 in pan.  A hodge-podge meal for cheapo! Very good! Thanks for the inspiration!

Good recipe.  Instead of cans of mixed  vegtables, I added frozen corn, frozen peas and cooked carrots.  The final result as a little soupy so next time I may eliminate the diced tomatoes.  The potato topping was yummy.

The mashed potatoes for this pie are amazing but the meat/vegetables need work, too tomato-y. Not sure how to fix that. Might make the potatoes again, however.

I would agree about the potatoes, they need more like 20-25 minutes, even cut up. I would also suggest simmering the beef mixture for another 10 minutes  to reduce the water. Other than that, great recipe. I would make it again. Btw, great potatoes!

My entire family loved this!  I made it with frozen veggies and chicken broth, and I used home-canned tomato puree in place of the diced tomatoes and tomato paste.  It was delicious!  I will most definitely be serving this again.

This recipe is good and easy.  Ours came out rather wet and soupy.  I would add less vegetables next time.  A few days after making this I had some shepard's pie off a friend's plate at an Irish restaurant.  The potatoes were not as good as this recipe, but I liked the meat portion better.  Less chunky consistency.

A few changes I made were to use fresh veggies. I diced carrots, green pepper, onion, zucchini, and added frozen corn to the ground beef while browning. I added tomato sauce but no diced tomatoes. I like a beefy taste so added a can of onion soup instead and it was really good.
When I add garlic to mashed potatoes I always throw the whole clove in the boiling water and then mash it together with the potatoes. Always tasty and the Romano cheese was great in the topping.. Everyone had seconds.

This is now my go to recipe. I changed a couple things though. I omitted the onions and diced tomatoes as I do not care for them and I use one can of corn and one can of green beans instead of mixed vegetables. I also only used HALF of the garlic it calls for in the mashed potatoes which is odd for me because I am a garlic lover and put it in everything, but when I used the full amount the first time I tried it, it was way to garlicky. I also sprinkle some cheddar cheese on the top before baking. I love this recipe!!!!!!!!

I LOVED this! I didn't feel like putting in the effort to make the potatoes from scratch, so I did as another reviewer suggested and prepared two packages of "Simply Potatoes," mixing in the cheese, a couple splashes of half and half, garlic powder, chopped chives, and a few shakes of Italian seasoning. My oven doesn't have a broiler, but it turned out just fine, even though I'd have liked a browned crust. I put some of the excess cheese on top and it melted nicely! I also used one bag of frozen veggies instead of canned. When prepared with ready-made potatoes, this is SUPER easy and quick to put together. I'll make this again and again. Thank you!

Followed directions exactly, except for using frozen mixed veggies in place of the canned and I left the peels on the red potatoes. This is SO good. Better the next day. I will make again!!

I've made this recipe a couple of times now - it's great! And so easy to modify to your personal preferences. Instead of canned veggies, I dice about 4-5 large carrots to cook with the onions, and then throw in about a cup of frozen peas right before taking the beef mixture off the stove. I use about 2lbs of red potatoes, weighed before peeled, and a head of cauliflower for the mash. I also use greek yogurt instead of butter - we really like the taste and texture and it's much healthier. I omit the diced tomatoes altogether. Great recipe!

This shepherd's pie is very tasty. The only (minor) problems with this recipe were that the meat mixture needs to be seasoned with salt & pepper and that the potatoes need to be cooked for way longer than 10 minutes. I also used frozen mixed vegetables instead of canned vegetables.

This was GREAT!  The only changes I made was to use a can of corn and a can of peas, and used cheddar cheese since that was what I had on hand. Split into two 8 x 8 pans (only cooking for 2) and froze the extra pan. Highly recommend!

The seasonings in this recipe were a bit much for my taste and I even only used half. It was also a bit runny. Next time I will use less seasonings, cut the tomato sauce all together, and use 1.5 pounds of meat instead of 1 pound. For the potatoes I will cut the oregano and use fresh green onions instead. My potatoes were a bit gooey, but I think its my fault as I used too much cheese. It was a good base recipe, but I will definitely be making some changes to suit my tastes.

Delicious. I had to use what was in the kitchen so I cut up a fresh tomato, used a can of corn and a can of green beans and 2 packets of instant mashed potatoes and it was so good. Next time I am going to add some hot sauce and Worcestershire since I put hot sauce on it when I eat it anyway,

This was just "Eh".  I made it exactly how the recipe called for.  I LOVE tomatoes but I have to say they don't belong in Shepherd's Pie.  It just didn't seem right.  The Mashed Potatoes were amazing however and the only reason I gave it 3 stars.

My family really enjoyed this dish. The slight alterations I made were to not use the tomato sauce or tomatoes, and instead of dried herbs I used fresh. Also in place of red potatoes I used russet. Very tasty!

Excellent!  I substituted fresh carrots and celery instead of the canned mixed veggies because if I'm going to cook I prefer not to use canned veggies.

This is delicious!  My husband asks for this dish all the time and I know it off by heart.  I have changed nothing, it is good as written.  The garlic mashed potatoes really make the dish.  Thanks for a great keeper.

This was such a hit!  I left out the tomatoes because I thought it would make it too soupy (plus we don't love cooked tomatoes).  I also used frozen corn, peas & green beans (about half what it called for) instead of canned.  It was VERY yummy!  My husband wants me to make the potatoes by themselves in the future!

Nice variation on the potatoes (Romano cheese). I use heavy cream instead of milk along with butter, garlic powder, salt and pepper to make my mashed potatoes. For an easy BUSY MOM recipe, add a large can of vegetable soup to the beef after it is browned (instead of adding veggies or tomato sauce). Let it simmer for a few minutes and then place beef mixture in the bottom of a glass baking dish. Continue layering with a large can of sweet corn (drained) and then mashed potatoes. Top with pats of butter and paprika - and serve with beef gravy. Talk about a crowd pleaser! You can make this dish well in advance and keep it in the fridge until you get home from work. Pop it in the oven on at 350 for approximately 1/2 hour and serve with a green leafy salad.  My family loves this meal, and I am thankful that it is so easy.

This was great!  Really very easy and tasty.  We halved the recipe, and used a 16 oz bag of frozen California mix veggies (defrosted in the microwave and left/pressed to drain) that we diced in place of the canned veggies.  I didn't care for the rosemary, but I never do :) so I'll substitute another herb for that next time.  Also used Parmesan instead of Romano because we always have a hunk in the house.  We added a few large spoonfuls of baked winter squash to the potatoes, per another reviewer's suggestion, and you couldn't even taste it - but it added vitamins for sure!  Left out the butter in the potatoes, but we may have added just a little more Parmesan in its place... :)  Thanks for the recipe - it's a keeper!

A pretty good casserole. I have a similar recipe I make that uses tomato soup. Didn't have any so I tried this recipe, as I had the ingrediants on hand. The potatoes were fabulous! I used parmejan cheese and they were absolutly delicious! I still think I'm partial to my own recipe, but will definitely use this potato recipe on top. Thanks!

This one is definately going in our family cookbook!  Everyone went back for seconds and thirds.  The only things we changed was the veggies and we used fresh shredded carrots and zucchini and fresh green beans and cooked them until tender crisp prior to putting then in the pan to cook in the oven.  I cant say this could get any better!

This recipe was great.  I cut it in half and made it for my girlfriend and I tonight.  I used peas and corn for the veggies.  I loved the flavors from the basil and rosemary.  It was very filling.  It paired great with a home brewed English porter.  

I am definitely making this again.  I used ground sirloin tonight but plan on trying it with venison and with lamb.

My husband did not like this at all.  He couldn't quite explain what it was about it he didn't like.  One of my boys thought it was OK...he mainly liked the potatoes, I think.  Other son did not like it too much.  Maybe it would be better to peel the potatoes and use frozen veges (?).  I used canned Veg-All - I think that's what it was called.  I only tasted a little bit and I thought it was alright.  My hubby wants me to throw out the recipe! (Sorry!)

I did not find this "easy."  It took me an hour to prepare it plus cooking time.  And it was just okay.  The romano was a bit overpowering.  Have half left over (no one ate much) and am hoping it will be better tomorrow.  Won't make this again. Sorry.

This was a very good change from my usual shepherds pie recipe. I used a lb. of frozen broccoli and cauliflower instead of canned veggies. I didn't have romano cheese but I always have cheddar so I used that. It was great. This was very delicious and easy to prepare. Next time per DH I will add corn also.

I was skeptical, but this was a very delicious dinner.  My husband, son and guest all loved it and we didn't have any leftovers!  Next time I will use a deep dish pan because this bubbled over in the oven.  I also used one can of cut green beans and one can of corn.  I will definitely make this again!

This was surprisingly easy, but it still took me about 30 minutes to prep - I'm NOT a skilled cook, so I am super inefficient! But it was worth it - my 11 year old said it was the best meal I've ever made! The mashed potato topping was really tasty - if you're as inefficient as I am (is that possible?), you could save time by not messing with adding cheese, garlic, etc, but you'd miss out on what makes this really unique. I will definitely be making this again (striving for 20 minute prep next time ;-)

This was really basic. If I hadn’t added a lot more seasoning than called for it would’ve been super bland. I have made many different shepherd pie recipes searching for one I really enjoy(my bf loves it). This is not it. It isn’t bad, but isn’t great. Too much tomato flavor.

I enjoyed it enough.  I think that in the future I will leave out the tomatoes, though.  Instead of canned veggies, I diced up some carrots and celery and added some green beans that I had frozen for later use.  (I also tossed in a piece of jalapeño, but it wasn't enough that I could really taste it.)  I put the oregano (fresh) and the garlic into the meat mixture instead of the potato mixture.  Because we use dry milk here, I didn't fully drain the potatoes and used that to reconstitute the milk.  It was a little time consuming, but I should have enough for a fair number of meals; so I think it was worth it.

Only substitutions I made were using frozen veggies (peas and carrots) instead of canned and cheddar instead of Romano cheese as that's what I had on hand.  Family really enjoyed this filling dish -- a good way to get a lot of mileage out of a pound of ground beef too.  Will definitely be making this one again.

The recipe was quite good.  I do increase the spices, especially salt and pepper & mix /14 C of mayonaise in the mashed potatoes for silkiness.

I really enjoy this take however I'm going to use different veggies next time, plus I added spicy pepper jack cheese to the top during the broil. I like a little more kick to mine. but I loved it.

Will make this again!  Great flavor.  Will totally add in more potatoes for the topping as the potatoes tasted awesome.  Used mild cheddar instead of romano.

Excellent!!  For the most part I followed the recipe.  I had leftover mashed potatoes from another night so I just used those.  I steamed fresh sliced carrots and sugar snap peas as the vegetable.  Any vegetable would work well.   These are what my kids prefer.

I omitted the diced tomatoes and used a 10oz package of frozen mixed veggies. Good, yummy comfort food. The recipe fit perfectly into a 7x11 glass baking dish.

Good for a Sheperds Pie but not exceptional - possibly my fault. Made a minor change to make it go faster for supper. Used instant potatoes instead of the real thing. As a result, neglected to mix cheese into potato mixture. Added cheese to top during broiling.

Very tasty!  I added more garlic and used a light Celtic cheddar, and it turned out great!  My family thought it could have used slightly more potatoes, so I might add a potato or two next time to balance the meat and potatoes a little better.

Following some suggestions, and since i'm not a fan of vegitables, i only used half the can of tomatoes. I couldn't believe how good this was! It's definately a keeper.

This was so good.  Definitely a new favorite in our house.  I didn't have a lot of time, so I used powdered potatoes instead of boiling fresh ones, but the recipe still turned out great!  Thanks - made a wonderful St. Pat's Day dinner!

The reason for four stars is because I only used half the recipe.  I only used the mashed potato part.  I was a little skeptical about the tomato sauce so I decided to make a different meat base but still use the potato recipe.  The mashed potatoes are the best I have ever had on shepherd's pie.  The only thing I change was the garlic.  I smash one big clove and add it the the water as I'm boiling the potatoes.  I find it a little less mild, but yet you can still fully taste it once you mix it with the rest of the ingredients.  Don't throw the garlic out, add it to the rest of the stuff.  The cheese really tops it all off.  I use freshly grated parmesan and find it just as good.

This was o.k.  I think the romano was way too strong and overpowered the rest of the flavors.

Edible but not my favorite flavors together.  Reminded me more of spaghetti.  Will stick with the more traditional recipe.

This recipe is much better than most Shepard's Pie recipes I've tried.  Still doesn't compare to recipes I've had at restaurants.  Still it was relatively simple to prepare using ingrediants i usually have on hand and was a satisfying meal.  I thought the rosemary was a bit overpowering, so next time I will cut that down a bit.  The mashed potatoes are to die for, tho I did end up using a bit more milk for mine just to get it to a spreading conistancy.  Overall, a good recipe and one that I will make again.

What a delicious meal. I was afraid it would taste too strongly of tomatoes but it was perfect. What a good twist on an old favorite. I had two helpings and my boyfriend had THREE. I've printed this recipe and handed it out to my friends and I also have another new favorite mashed potato recipe too! Thank you :)

I used leftover mashed potatoes from the previous night's dinner and simply reheated them and added the cheese (I had parmesan on hand) and garlic.  It turned out perfectly.  This recipe is a subtle twist on a family favorite that makes all the difference.

Very good....I substituted a package of soy meat for the hamburger....and it came out very good! Also used a 32 oz package of frozen mixed veggies instead of canned. And more than plenty for two people plus several lunches!!

Best shepherds pie recipe i have ever tried!  I would use the potatoes themselves as a side dish they were so good!
