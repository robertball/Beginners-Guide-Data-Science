Really good & easy. I didn't have evaporated milk so I just used whole milk. The recipe doesn't say what to do with the chocolate squares so I melted them with the butter. Also didn't have quick cooking oats so just used my old fashioned. Thanks for a quick treat for the sweet tooths in my family.

This is an excellent "no bake" recipe.  Couple of changes - I didn't have salted peanuts, but the unsalted worked just as great - also, I added twice the amount of chocolate, but I used chocolate chips.  I think the extra chocolate made them have a smoother texture, which helped them not taste "grainy" like most "no bake" recipes.  Overall, great recipe!!!  Has definitely replaced my old one.

I made these with smooth peanut butter as that's what I had on hand, and they came out great. Thanks!

These were a hit at our Election Night party! I doubled the recipe and there were none left over. I made these at the last minute using ingredients I had in my pantry so I had to modify juts a bit: we didn't have crunchy peanut butter so used the creamy version and then only chocolate we had in stock was a bag of Nestle sweet chocolate chips. Even with the changes, the cookies were delicious and sooooo easy!

These were soooooooooooooooooo good. I didn't have any peanuts on hand so I used walnuts instead. Can also substitute chocolate chips for the chocolate squares.

Just make sure that you don't make these on a rainy day.  The cookies will not 'set' right if you do.

Great Recipe! Never made no-bakes before but had tasted them many times.  Was ecstatic at how easy and tasty this recipe was.  Will make again and again. Recommend to anyone short on time.

Perfect quick-fix for a sweet tooth. I did not have evaporated milk, so I used half and half; also had to substitute brown sugar for the white. Even so, these no-bakes set up beautifully and we really enjoyed them. Thank you!

I used normal milk in place of evap..  turned out very well.  Not the best no bake recipe I've ever made, but very good.  I like that it doesn't use cocoa.

I thought it was perfect. I too used chocolate chips. I put them in the warmed mixture until they were barely melted and then added it to the oats. That way we tasked some chocolate pieces.

These are delicious, the only thing I would recommend is to leave out the peanuts.  If you use crunchy peanut butter, that supplies enough of the peanut "crunchy" taste.  Plus leaving out the peanuts helps them firm up better in the fridge.

Great and easy recipe! I made it with creamy peanut butter and it came out delicious. They did not last long here so I will have to double it next time!
