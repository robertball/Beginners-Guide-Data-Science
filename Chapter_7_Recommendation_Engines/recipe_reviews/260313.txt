My rating is just for the topping, not the actual cupcake. So adorable!

Didn't change a thing. This was a trial run, but I'll definitely be making them for Christmas for my grand babies. They loved them!

The Reindeer Cupcakes were a big hit with our family and neighbors. 

I did not use red jelly beans (too big). Jellybeans are not always available anyway; instead,  I used Imperials (red cinnamon candies) found in the baking section of many stores.
