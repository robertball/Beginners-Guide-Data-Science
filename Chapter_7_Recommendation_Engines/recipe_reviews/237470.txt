Very nice banana bread.  I admit, because of the name, I added more ginger (I love ginger.)  I added 1/2 tsp. instead of 1/4th tsp. and also added some crystallized ginger to the batter.   My bananas were quite ripe and sweet, so I used a little less sugar than called for.

This is a wonderful recipe.  This is actually the 2nd time I have made it and while the basic recipe is great I did add a few things to mine:
I increased the ginger from half to a full teaspoon, 
I increased the vanilla likewise.
I also layered the batter with about a half a cup of white chocolate chips. Batter on the bottom 1/4 cup of chips, repeat. 
I also made a ginger cinnamon simple syrup and as soon as it leaves the oven I poke the top several times and pour the syrup over.  When cooled it really increases flavor and moistness.

Aroma while baking was wonderful. Tasted sweet, with an excellent balance of flavors.  Texture was very moist and luscious. I will be making this again.

This was GREAT. I messed up a bit....no lemon or ginger at home. I used raw ginger but I didn't add enough. I added a finger sized piece. I should have added 5 or 6 times that amount, but I didn't know. I used 3 large bananas and that part was perfect. Thank you.

As per one ginger-loving reviewer, I used 1/2 tsp ginger.  I used 3 good sized very ripe bananas, but don't know what that translates to in cups.  Baked for 55 minutes, turned once during baking.  Absolutely perfect--very moist, great flavor (more ginger would be welcome in our house), and a beautiful golden brown color.  Maybe add nuts next time?  I'll definitely make it again.

As with most quick breads, this tastes better the day after you make it.  I think next time I'll play around with the spice levels a bit.  All in all a good bread, though.

I've made many banana breads over my many years, but this is seriously the best one ever.  I don't know how many cups of mashed bananas I had because they were all shriveled up little things I'd stuck in the freezer...I had 5 and I used them all.  Oh. My. Word.  This is so moist, so wonderfully tasty...I'm trying not to gobble it up, but I suspect I will fail.

This is so easy to make, and she is right about not skimping on the bananas.
I have tried other banana bread recipes but this one is the best!

This recipe has a nice blend of flavors. I like the texture, it*s not rubbery. I added  1/2 cup of walnuts.

Great recipe! I wanted a more gingerbread type feel so I substituted the brown sugar with molasses and added more ginger and some pecans for texture. Yum!

I'm never making banana bread differently! Everything ingredient added a certain layer of perfection to it. I could independently taste the nutmeg, ginger, cinnamon. And together it was .... (kisses fingers) beautiful.

As others suggested, I made some modifications to create a spicier banana bread, and based on what I had on hand. I got 2 dozen scrumptious muffins out of one batch of batter.
Mods:
1 C whole wheat/1 C white flour
1/4 C coconut oil/1/4 C unsalted butter
2/3 C sugar (no brown sugar, I didn't have any)
2 t vanilla
1/4 C crystallized ginger, finely minced
1 t ginger
1/4 t cardamom
2/3 C toasted pecans, diced

For muffins, reduce baking time to 20 min. and check for doneness as oven temps vary. Will definitely make again!

I followed the recipe as written. I absolutely love this recipe! Moist on the inside, a bit of a crust on the outside, wonderful flavour. I am not picking up the ginger flavour, as such, like other reviewers, I would double the amount of ginger to see how that compares. I also had to bake an additional 10min so it was fully cooked through.

It was moist and beautiful, but lacked flavor. My husband and I agreed that it needed lots more spice, even though I had used more than called for.

This was SO Delicious! I've made banana bread in the past and it's never been this good. The only alteration I made was I used Self Rising flour vs. All Purpose flour. Also, my bananas were very ripe. I stored this in the fridge after it cooled and ate it for breakfast the next morning. So, this is good hot or cold. Its so moist, you don't need a drink with it.
Will definitely keep this recipe.
Thanks for sharing!

Hubby had a taste for ginger bread and we had bananas that needed to be used.  Found this recipe and thought I'd give it try. Glad I did! The only change I made was to increase the ginger to a heaping half teaspoon.  Good recipe. Will definitely make again.

I am not a big fan of banana bread, but this bread was/is excellent! The ginger is what made it so good! Powdered and candied! (Thanks, Renee!) I took some slices in to work, and they all loved it!
