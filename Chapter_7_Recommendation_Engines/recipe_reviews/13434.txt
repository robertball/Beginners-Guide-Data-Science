I noticed on reviewer commented on how labor intensive it was to make the tiny meatballs.  I saw a chef make them by shaping some of the meat into a "rope", cutting the rope into 3/4" segments, and then rolling a bunch of them at once with his hand pressing them against the counter.  It was very clever and made quick work of it - hope this helps!

I replaced the onion with some garlic powder.  I also browned the meatballs in a frying pan before putting them in the soup.. It added a great flavor to the meatballs and the soup

Delicious! I used 1 cup of bread crumbs in the meatballs. I added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to the pot (that seems to get rid of the "canned broth" smell somehow). I've never made a recipe where meatballs weren't browned first, but I didn't pre-cook them. The soup wasn't greasy and the meatballs weren't too anemic loooking. I used my small cookie scoop for the meatballs and it was easy and quick! I used orzo pasta and precooked it and added it to the soup right at the end to avoid having it absorb all the broth. The best thing  was that my husband was pretty sure he was not going to like this soup and after he tried it, he liked it a lot.

Yummy! I was initially skeptical because I though the broth might lack flavour. It was really good! I only had 1/2 chicken broth and the other half vegetable. Omitted the onion because I had none. Still delicious.

My tip is to drop the meatballs into the soup slowly, going around the pot so they don't all sit on top of each other. The meatballs will rise to the top as they cook. Once most of the meatballs have risen (about 4 minutes), then stir gently. Don't stir when you initially put the meatballs in.

Great recipe Lalena. Thanks so much!

Very Good!  Everyone in the family loved this soup. I used 80% lean beef instead of the extra lean. I decided to bake the meatballs @ 350 degrees for 15 minutes on a broiler pan to drain some of the extra fat.  I did double the breadcrumbs on the meatballs - a personal preference. I just dumped the meatballs into the soup mixture for the last 5 minutes of cooking.  I doubled the pasta to make it a thicker soup and added a dash of garlic powder to the broth.  When served with parmesean on top it was awesome.

We absolutely loved this!  I added a little garlic powder when making the meatballs and used frozen chopped spinach.  It's a meal in one bowl--just add some bread.

This is an excellent soup.  I tried this once in an Italian restaurant and loved it and this was just as good if not better.  I used Orzo pasta, nice and small, and added 1 clove of garlic to meatballs.  Quick, easy and delicious meal.  Definitely 5 stars.

Good soup, but one addition.  I've always added small cheese balls to the soup.  Beat an egg or 2 and add Parmesan cheese until it's stiff enough to make into a ball, then drop into the hot soup at the end so they don't cook too long.  These are my favorite part of the soup, so I always make more rather than less.  They also add more flavor to the soup.  Just be sure to make the cheese balls very tiny (about grape size) because they expand in the soup.  Extra effort but well worth it.

Exactly what I was looking for!  I added old bay seasoning to the broth though since it seemed a little bland to me.  I also cooked/baked the meatballs and noodles (half way) prior to adding them to the soup.

I live with two Italian men and they LOVED this soup.  It is SO hearty and SO healthy.  I'm going to make it a part of my dinner rotation from now on.  Thanks.

My family loves Italian Wedding Soup, but it takes so much work the way my Nonna made it, I usually only make it twice a year.  This recipe has changed our lives because it simplifies the whole process!  Use a high quality chicken broth as it is a key ingredient.  In the last 5 minutes, add a mixture of 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese and 2 beaten eggs.  This will cook and float on the top.  This adds something authentic to the recipe.  I will eliminate the carrots next time as my "connoisseur" family suggested this.  You can substitute acini di pepe or orzo pasta for the seashell pasta.

To match my grandmother's recipe, here is how I made the meatballs which is very similar to Laiena's version:
- 1 pound  lean ground beef
- 2 eggs, beaten
- 1 cup Italian bread crumbs
- 2 T grated parmesan cheese
- 1/4 cup water
- 1 tablespoon dried parsley (or double if fresh)
- 2 gloves of minced for pressed garlic
- 1 teaspoon salt

Buon appetito!

Success all around as per the recipe!  As with many soups, there is definitely seasoning preferences that one could apply to this recipe.  However, made as per the recipe, my wife came by the kitchen as I was making this and said:”Wow!  I can’t wait to taste that!  It smells so good!”  Well it is a keeper.  My two young boys just gobbled it, and they did not even notice the spinach!  The preparation work is pretty much spot on: it took me about 20 minutes.  To save time on slicing all the spinach, you can do a chiffonade.  Just stack a bunch of the leaves, roll the pile lengthwise into a fairly tight cigar shape, and slice across the cigar in close cuts.  It seriously makes those two cups processed nicely in a jiffy!

Great recipe!  Instead of shells I used Acine De Pepi.  Great taste and very hearty.  Will certainly make again.

This recipe is a good start but a few small additions make for a terrific soup. 
 In my experience, sauteing onions, garlic & celery is a must. It will add flavor to the chicken broth and is worth the extra effort. 
Dice the veggies finely and you've improved your soup before you've added a thing.
  Wedding Soup is a wonderful treat to come home to on a cold winter day. If you have family members who don't eat meat, you can substitute turkey for the ground beef. 
  Thanks, Lalena. This is comfort food at its best.

It would be better if the meatballs were cooked first.  Otherwise it makes the soup too greasy.

My friends served this soup to over 40 guests at our Soup 'n Bread Luncheon today.  It was very delicious!!!   Other than needing a significant amount of garlic  (I LOVE garlic) to enhance all the flavors, I'd not change a thing.  Rolling the meat into a rope & cutting meatball sizes is an amazing technique.   Our chef baked the meatballs in the oven so they weren't that boiled gray color which I'm not fond of.   GOOD RECIPE!!!

Really good, and even my picky, soup-avoiding husband liked it!  I baked the meatballs first, cooked the pasta separately, added cheese tortellini and served with crusty garlic bread.  Very tasty!

Easy and requires only a few ingredients.  I would recommend adding  ingredients in the order they cook (carrots, then pasta, and spinach last) rather than all at once.  Also, if using a pasta smaller than shells, such as orzo, either use less pasta or more broth otherwise you'll end up with too little broth for the soup.

If I could give more than 5 stars I would!!!! I had never had Italian Wedding Soup before and this was incredible! I used a crockpot and cut the recipe in half. I also made the meatballs in a pan and in the oven beforehand. Even if the noodles get mushy it's YUMMY!!!!

This is an absolute wonderful recipe. I don't normally like any soup (chicken broth based) This one however I loved. My Grandfather whom was born in Italy would roll over in his grave and say, God Bless you Brenda for always keeping up with traditional Italian Foods. I made it this Mother's Day Weekend and my Momma, who's 80 years old and Italian of course like Gramps, was quite impressed. Being a diabetic she was happy with a soup that was nutritious and delicious! My Dad 83 years of age, loved it also. He has some peptic problems and this was gentle on his tummy. I pretty much followed this to the T, but I did add some fresh mushrooms,as well all my spices & onions & carrots where fresh from my garden! This is a keeper and I'm making it again this weekend so I can have some to bring for my lunches and also to my Mom & Dads! Thanks!!!!!

Very good!  Try using a small cookie scoop for the meatballs.  They come out perfect, and you don't have to touch the meat with your hands.

Wonderful Soup!!!  I make this frequently because my husband and boys ask for it. I made it as the recipe states except I sear the meatballs (Broil in the oven until the "tops" start to turn from grayish color to dark brown - time will depend on size of meatballs, it takes me ~ 7 minutes because I make tiny meatballs, larger ones will take more time). I just always sear any type of meatball I make. Also, if I don't have broth, I dissolve 10 chicken bouillon cubes in 2.5 quarts boiling water, then add 2 cups baby carrots, simmer for ~ 10 minutes until soft. Then I skim them out with a Chinese strainer and let cool a little. This allows me to "easily" cut them into small discs, which I like because they are little discs packed with flavor.  Lastly, I use whole grain seashell pasta. I am eating some right now. Delicious!! Thanks Lalena!!

Excellent soup! I had some precooked frozen Ialitan meatballs on hand and used those and it made this recipe even better. I also used another cup of spinach and next time I make it will double the amount. Delicious!

Quite often acidity is left out of recipes.   This is spot on served with a wedge of lemon.  Balances everything nicely.

This soup was a big hit with my family.  I used reviewers suggestions and sauteed the meatballs first.  I didn't alter the recipe much, except to add fresh minced parsley, garlic powder and grated cheese to the meatballs.  Instead of adding the onion to the meatballs, I sauteed it in the pot before adding the broth.  Everyone loved it, and other than making the small meatballs, it was extremely easy and quick to make.    Edit to review:  I just made this soup using ground chicken instead of beef.  It was WONDERFUL!  My entire family said the soup tasted even better with the chicken meatballs.

I have made a similar recipe for years with one big difference. Instead of Ground beef, use Italian sausage. It is awesome.

This soup came out awesome. I used half lean beef and half ground pork. Used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and used the really petite carrots in a bag and chopped them up they were perfect when time was up. I used a melon ballet to size meat balls which also were perfectly cooked at this time. I agree that the spinach needed to be switched with escarole because it holds up more but other than that being a true Italian this was awesome!

Talk about a marriage of flavor!  This was wonderful.  I made about 3 gallons (quadrupled the recipe) for some veterans and was really disappointed that I didn't have even a spoonful to bring home, but they sure were smiling.  I only made a couple of modifications.  First, I used 3/4 beef, and 1/4 ground pork for the meatballs.  I made the meatballs ahead, (large marble size) and browned them in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes.  Then, instead of using fresh spinach which was just too darned expensive, I used well drained frozen chopped spinach, and added diced celery, then some diced cooked chicken.  Believe me, no one complained.  Also, intead of shell pasta, I used the smallest I could get as it is more for show instead of flavor anyway. And, because I was serving so many, I just added the parmesan cheese right into the broth.  OH!  One thing..if you do go beyond doubling this recipe, cut way back on the eggs.  You will use more meat, but won't need as many eggs.  Okay...I'm done now.

I've been using this recipe for several years now and am finally getting around to reviewing it.  I love this soup--it comes together relatively quickly and makes a LOT; great for feeding a crowd.  I've used ground turkey for the meatballs and it works very well.  It is a challenge to get small meatballs; I find that coating my hands with non-stick cooking spray helps.  I also substitute onion & garlic powder for the chopped onion; I prefer the texture given the meatballs were so small.  I also leave out the pasta and add it to individual bowls, otherwise it does absorb the broth and become mushy.  Thanks, Lalena for this tasty recipe!

This recipe is fantastic.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and I had to also increase the bread crumbs because the meat was too sticky.  The flavor was really great.  No need to add salt even.

Meatballs when dropped in the simmering broth some fell apart and it also clouded the broth. I like a clearer broth for my wedding soup, more appetizing looking. I will make this again, but next time roll into a long tube, and cut the balls off that, and then bake in the oven until browned, THEN add them to the broth after the grease is rendered.

Very good and super easy, the only change I made was to use wide egg noodles cut in half. The funny thing is I live in Italy and like many other "ITALIAN" recipes this doesn't existe here!!! Just like "italian bread crumbs".. no such thing here!!

Wow this turned out great.  I did as others suggested and cooked the meatballs for a little while in the oven first, and the pasta on the stove for a little while before adding them to my soup.  I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could.

Great recipe.  I'm very fortunate to have an Italian deli that makes the best tiny meatballs.  We always have them on hand.  This recipe is almost the same that I have been using for several years.  Always a favorite with family and friends.

This is good stuff! I also make the long version, but thought I'd give this shorter recipe a try. It was much quicker and the end result was very near the same. I was pleasantly surpirsed. Really good!

Very good soup.  I added mushrooms and used escarole instead of spinach.  Also used whole wheat pasta.  Excellent for a low calorie meal.  Be sure to use extra lean meat !!  This is the 2nd time I've made it and its perfect

I simmered two chicken breasts in the broth to make it more flavorful.  I removed them to cool and skimmed the broth.  To reduce the fat a bit, I cooked the meatballs in the oven for a few minutes before putting them in the soup and I added the diced chicken at the end.  Orzo was all I had, but I would have preferred acine de pepi.  Everybody raved about this, even my picky daughter!

This was a very easy recipe that tastes GREAT!  I used pepe pasta instead of seashells.  Also, I used canned chicken stock instead of homemade and it still turned out really rich and flavorful!  Thanks!  My family loved it!

Everyone loved this! Because the meatballs are cooked in the soup, definitely use the leanest ground beef you can find. I used Laura's Lean (97/3), and the soup was perfect. If your beef isn't lean enough, you'll end up with greasy soup (ick). Wonderful recipe and I will definitely make it again.

I tried this as written and liked it a lot.  Then I tweaked it by using Ditalini instead of shells and escarole (soaked in salted water for 20 minutes to get rid of the bitterness) in place of spinach.  This is an excellent recipe.  thanks Lalena.

While I did tweak the recipe a bit, it was a solid base for me to make an awesome soup, similar to what's served at some Olive Garden restaurants (notably, the one in Ross Park in Pittsburgh).  I had about 2lbs of beef to use, so I doubled the meatball "stuff" (though I did sub about 1/4C cottage cheese for one of the eggs, simply because it needed to be used or tossed).  I elected to use dried minced onion as opposed to fresh because my knife skills are lacking and can never seem to get a fine enough mince for my liking.  Since I had so much meat, I used 3 cartons of stock:  2 chicken and 1 beef (I also added 2 packets of Swanson's Beef Flavor Boost).  I began by sauteing about 1/4 of an onion and a spoonful of minced garlic in a dash of EVOO and then added the broth on high.  I added the carrots as I diced them and then got to work on the meatballs, adding them as I rolled them (I was afraid I'd have too many meatballs, so I elected to bake some and freeze for even easier future soup).  Once the meatballs were all added, I boiled the ancini de pepe (instead of the shells) in another pan (this is key or else the pasta will soak up all of the broth) while I chopped and added the spinach.  Once the pasta was drained and rinsed, I added it to the soup, ladled it into bowls, topped w/fresh parmesan, and thoroughly enjoyed every last drop!  THANKS for the jumping off point, Lalena!

Delicious!  Very easy to make, and with great results.  I used "pearl municion" pasta by La Moderna (Mexican pasta) which is just like the little ball pasta in the canned version of this soup.  I made my own chicken broth using chicken cubes, which I like better than the canned broths that can sometimes be too watery.  This is one for the recipe box!  Thanks.

This was an instant Family Favorite! Even my picky eaters ate it. I only changed a few MINOR things: I used Dried minced onion in the meatballs, and I added 1/2 cup of diced fresh celery along with the 1 cup diced carrots. I added about 1 1/2-2cups of whole wheat rotini noodles insted of the shells(only because that is what I had) I just ripped the spinach instead of taking the time to cut it up :0) WONDERFUL soup!! Thank you so much for Posting!! LET EVERYTHING THAT HAS BREATH PRAISE THE LORD! ~PSALM 150:6

I decide to brown the meatballs lightly before putting in the soup and I am glad I did.  Got rid of some of the fat and they held together well.  I really liked the addition of the carrotts.  My soup was such a hit that everyone had two bowls.  This one is a keeper.  Fun to make and great tasting.

This is REALLY good soup!!  This was my first attempt at Italian Wedding Soup and we loved it!  I added 1 clove of garlic to the meatballs and just eyeballed the rest of the ingredients.  Next time I would add more garlic (2 large cloves).  I also added a lot more fresh spinach than called for, I used a 10oz package of roughly chopped baby spinach and thought it was the right amount; I also used about 1 cup of orzo. The recipe made 66 meatballs (I rolled out the meat mixture and cut with a knife) and found that the meatballs probably should have been smaller.  All in all - a delicious soup that we will definitely make again.

This is fantastic soup. I had some homemade stock on hand so I used that. And I also followed the technique of one other reviewer who mentioned making a rope of the meat and cutting meatballs out of it. Clever!! Because I wanted the soup to keep for a while and freeze well, I left out the pasta. If you use fresh stock, the broth is really rich enough without the additional starch. I will definitely be making this again. It hits the spot!

Good recipe, but one that you should definitely play with according to your tastes. I will try baking the meatballs next time and add a bit more flavor to them with spices or ground pork. I sauteed the veggies in a touch of butter before adding the broth. Certainly hearty enough for dinner. I will try again!

This soup was very tasty.  The only thing I found is that you had to eat it within two days or it went very mushy.  I would suggest to cut the recipe if it is only 2 or 4 people.

This was a very tasty soup.  I used ground turkey instead of beef.  The only thing I'd do differently next time is cook the pasta separately and add it when the soup is done.  The pasta was a little mushy by the time the meatballs were completely cooked.  
I will make this soup again!!!

The flavor of this soup is sooo good!  The only change I will make next time will be to fry or bake the meatballs before adding them to the soup.  I found that boiling them left that layer of funkiness on the top of the soup, and I tried to skim it off, but the spinach gets skimmed off with it.  It doesn't change the flavor though, so that's good.

Overall a great recipe that's easy to make.  I will surely use again!

My mother made this reciepe with small pieces of chicken added to the broth.  Boil 1 chicken breast before adding to soup mixture.  Goes great with the meatballs and gives it extra flavor.

I make this frequently, however, I prefer to use the meatloaf mix (veal, pork, and beef combined).  Most grocery stores sell it as meatloaf mix.  In addition, I use BOTH garlic (fresh) and onion.  Makes a big difference to not use garlic powder.  Also, it is just as nutritious to use frozen chopped spinach.  MUSIC_MINX, below has a great tip for making the meatballs. Tried it, and it works great!  Enjoy!

good and easy to make.  If you don't like making small meatballs just make big ones; they break up easily with a spoon once cooked.

I used this recipe as an inspiration...changed a few things to fit my tastes, mainly I traded the pasta for potatoes...probably not traditional but it was really, really yummy! Thanks for the base recipe, which I expanded upon with my own ideas.

This soup recipe is easy and delicious. You could easily halve the amount of meat; there were too many meatballs. And yes, as other reviewers have said, you could add more seasoning/spices - though I suspect my kids (ages 6 and 4) liked it in part because it was not overly seasoned. The meatballs are by far the most time consuming thing. Other than that, it's very quick!

This soup was delicious. I used homemade chicken broth, shallot for the onion, and frozen spinach instead of fresh. This was well received by my picky family ... and the MIL also liked it! Will definitely make again on a week night (very quick and easy to make).

Absolutely delicious! Exactly what I was looking for. I didn't have enough chicken stock so I used half chicken stock and half beef stock. I used acini d pepe for the pasta. We ate it for dinner, and the leftovers were gone by the morning!

Delicious!! I did make some changes though, I made half pork and half beef meatballs. To the broth I added 1/4 cup of barley and 2 tins of diced tomatoes. I also had no spinach so I used swiss chard for my garden. I made it a day ahead, and enough to last us two suppers, it was actually the best by day 3 :) So the pasta didn't get mushy, I cooked it in a different pot and just added the pasta to everyone's bowls. With these changes, this soup is now a regular!

This soup is a lot like one I learned from my MIL and hubby. It's one of my favorites! I added diced celery, carrots and onions and let that simmer for a while with minced garlic and Italian seasoning in my homemade chicken broth before adding the other ingredients. I also added a can of Italian style tomatoes and used frozen meatballs rather than making my own from scratch. The homemade chicken broth and spinach are my favorite ingredients in this recipe! It smells so wonderful while cooking and tastes even better the second day. Another bonus is that leftovers freeze very well and can become the base for your next pot of this delicious soup!! Definitely don't leave out the recommended parmesan cheese when serving. I love to grind fresh black pepper and sea salt in each bowl too! Yum

This is the best recipe for Italian wedding soup I have found. Very close to my mom's recipe from the old country. I make this every once in a while as it is time consuming. This was usually reserved for Sunday lunches and holidays.

I made this recipe twice so far and my family loved it! I also squeezed a lemon into it to get rid of the canned taste. The first time I made it I used baby spinach which came out a little better than the regular spinach (more tender). I also added 1 can of beef broth to the rest of the chicken broth to intensify the flavors a little more....delicious!

This is one of my favorite homemade soups--I really haven't met anyone who doesn't like it.  I cook my meatballs in the broth for a little longer before adding the other ingredients.  Add a little extra water when you reheat the left-overs and the soup won't be so salty--Enjoy

This soup is wonderful.  I made it for my parents when they came to visit and they asked for the recipe.  Only changed a couple of things... no onions in the meatballs (allergy issue) I added a little garlic powder instead.  Also, I put the carrots and spinach in the broth to boil while rolling the meatballs.  I add the meatballs and pasta in at the end.  I like to use spaghetti for the pasta.  Make sure to wait until after cooking the meatballs to see if you need extra seasonings though.  They make a huge taste difference.  I will make over and over again.

This was REALLY good... I doubled the meat balls and browned them in the oven first (450 for about 15 minutes) this was the best soup ever!!!

This was pretty good. I made it exactly like the recipe called for exept I used 10 ounces of frozen spinch instead. I cooked everything as directed except the spinch. The spinch I had to cook in the microwave since it was frozen and then drain the water, I then added it to the soup the last 2 min. It was pretty good and I will make this again.

I was running a kitchen in a local tavern a few years back and used this recipie as a soup of the day.
 Well, I had to be sure it was on at least once a week due to demand by our patrons.

WOW!  Awesome recipe!  This soup was SOOO good, it hit the spot.  I had the flu and italian wedding soup was the only thing I had a craving for.  Comfort food, totally.  I made my own meatballs with ground pork, ritz crazkers, 2 eggs and various spices.  I baked them for 20 min on 400 and then added them to the soup.  I added more spinach then recommended, for nutritional value, I used fresh chopped spinach that I tore into smaller pieces.  Will make this recipe again, and again, and again.  :o)

I made this last night-what a hit! I did make minimal changes. I used meatloaf mix (ground veal, beef and pork combined) instead of just ground beef for the meatballs, added about 1/4 cup parmesan to it and also grated the onion for more flavor in the meatballs. And used tiny egg bows pasta. My 2 year old ate the whole bowl and she is a picky eater with a capital "P". Loved it, great recipe, will definitely make again.

Yum! SO easy to make and fast! Meatballs were tender and juicy and spinach was so fresh tasing (I used fresh). I used beef broth instead of chicken broth and my husband loved it! Try this recipe!

This was an awesome recipe when I didn't really follow the recipe like the broth amount..I made it once used alot of broth and cooked meatballs for 20mins in the oven before putting in soup..the next time I went by your recipe by the time it was done cooking there weren't any meatballs just broken up hamburg...with not broth left..so those are the only changes..very good recipe otherwise.

I changed this recipe just a bit.  I used egg whites only (2 egg whites to one egg), oatbran instead of bread crumbs, fat-free parm. chz., Italian seasoning with additional basil, and garlic for the meatballs.  I cooked the meatballs in the oven for 15-20 minutes at 350 and then patted off the grease.  This makes a healthier meatball as well as a delicious one.  Then I followed the recipe as it goes except I added salt, pepper, and basil to the broth before the first boil.  I also waited for the second boil before I added my pasta.  This soup was delicious.  My boyfriend loved it, I loved it - just a wonderful array of flavors.

This was okay. The flavor was good, but way too much spinach for our liking.  If you don't like spinach, this soup is not for you.  I'd recommend pan-frying the meatballs first for a better flavor.

This is five stars in my books, definitely will make it for my Italian daughter-in-law to be when she comes to town.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I made this soup for Lenten Services on 4/9/2014 after searching the web for an easy
to do soup 30 servings. I was a little leery of serving a new recipe to the members of our 2 church parish. I had never made this soup before......the ladies are fabulous cooks...
the soup was a big hit......many comments and requests for the recipe!!!!   My husband
got up the morning after and requested a bowl for his breakfast.....wow!this is a first!
However....it rates 5 stars. Caroleann

I made several changes based on these reviews and the soup was a big hit with my family: Used ground turkey instead of beef, Italian pizza seasoning instead of basil,added 2 cloves of garlic, (was "season to taste" assumed in the original? it needed about 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper),mixed in food processor for finer texture (could have used a bit more bread crumbs), and precooked in oven at 350 degrees until done - the meatballs really evoked the taste of sausage. Escarole instead of spinach was best suggestion here. Couldn't find pearl pasta and used precooked tiny shells - tiny bow-ties would have been better.

I doubled the panko breadcrumbs for the meatballs and added a dash of granulated garlic.  I used a small scoop to make the meatballs.  I baked the meatballs @ 350 degrees for 15 minutes on a broiler pan to drain some of the extra fat. I brought the broth to a boil, added shredded carrots and whole wheat seashell pasta and cooked for 5-10 minutes. For the last five minutes, I added the cooked meatballs and fresh spinach ((I didn't waste my time cutting or dicing it, I used whole spinach leaves (not baby).)) Very delicious!

YUM! I added the spinach in at the very last minute. You should not cook it for 10 minutes. I also used half grounf beef half sausage and sprinkled the top with fresh parm. I also LOVE the idea of making the meatballs into a rope and slicing them. Great idea!

This is a great recipe to substitute venison for the beef, since it is extra lean.  I'm always looking for different ways to use the venison since my husband and friends are hunters.  It was delicious!!  The only thing I changed was adding a bit of minced garlic to the meat.

I made it with the meatballs and it was great however, the next time I substituted sliced lean chicken and it was amazing.  Made it for school and the kids inhaled it.

Great recipe. I do 1/2 beef and 1/2 chicken broth. Also use orzo, fresh garlic, fresh spinach. This is the perfect italian dish-use whatever broth, mixture of meat and pasta you want. Grew up in an italian family and a dish never comes out the same way twice-that what makes all the dishes great-put your own spin on it-It's The Italian Way! (Also use a oiled melon baller for the meatballs)

This is one of our favorite soups.  I do add some garlic powder to the meatballs and I brown them before I put them in the soup.  My husband doesn't like spinach, but he loves this soup!  I serve this with some garlic bread sticks. This is a quick and easy meal for us!

This is as close to the Italian Wedding Soup my mother used to make.  There wa never a recipe so I was not able to duplicate it.  I tried this recipe the other day and it is definately a keeper.

I never had Italian wedding soup before but my fiancée daughter loves it so I decided to try it out and chose this recipe. Not only did she love it but I loved it too! The only thing I slightly changed was I used 1 cup of chopped spinach and 1 cup of fresh chopped parsley and I added a little salt and pepper while it was cooking. Mmmmm this may be mynnew favorite soup!

This soup was excellent! I browned the meatballs in the empty pot before putting any of the other ingredients in so that I could use the drippings for extra flavor. I also added some garlic to the meatballs. My recommendation to anyone making this soup is to make sure you don't use low sodium broth.  Since the flavors of this soup are so mild, you really need a more flavorful broth for flavor.  I think a low sodium broth would make this very bland. I will be making this soup again!

I love this soup.  I did alter it a bit, used acini de pepe pasta and cut back in the spinach.  Very tasty and easy to make.

I used this recipe as a base to use what I had on hand.  I used a bag of frozen meatballs.  I put cooked them in 2 quarts of chicken broth for 3 hours on high.  About 20 minutes before eating, I threw in two handfuls of spinach and half a cup of couscous.  This was very easy and delicious!

This is an excellent authentic version.  Every year our church has a "Taste"  festival to showcase the ethnic  and racial diversity of our parish.  This recipe is one of the stars. Every year people ask me " your soup is going to be at the taste right? I  coax those that have never had nor heard of "Italian Wedding Soup" to try it, they  always come back for more.

I tweak it a little bit by using a beef/veal or beef/ pork combo and season to my personal taste. I also prefer the smaller orzo pasta, and cut back on the amount of spinach about 1/3rd.

Very good and easy.  Used 3 cans chick broth (college inn).  Made meatballs as directed but made some bigger ones for sauce later.  Used spinach too.

My husband loves Italian Wedding soup and was skeptical about this recipe.  BUT, he complimented it at least 12 times during, after and even the next day eating it!   *I used beef broth because I didn't have chicken on hand.

Very easy and tasty soup.  I did follow other suggestions on browning the meatballs first.  I followed the ingredients as written and thought the flavor was wonderful.  As a broth base, I used "Better than Bullion" found next to the canned broth in the grocery store.  My recommended change would be after browning the meatballs, insert them into broth until cooked through.  Then strain the broth with gravy separator to rid it of the fat.  The carrots and spinach can be added immediately after.  I also recommend not adding the shells until 8 minutes before serving as they will overcook and become mushy.

Soup was to die for and I didn't get to put in the greens!! I read through the reviews and decided to use Kale instead of spinach. Went to the store and bought everything I didn't have and started cooking. Got towards the end and went to add the Kale and couldn't find it!! Found it 3 days later in the back of the car!! YUK!! At least I didn't leave it at the store!!  The soup was very good though and my lady friend liked it as well. I guess that's all that counts!

I used homemade broth and browned the meatballs before adding the liquid. For the meatballs, I left out the parmesan with no ill effects; added garlic powder, oregano, a dash of black pepper, and was generous with the basil. I made breadcrumbs from a slice of bread. Excellent!

This was a very simple and delicious recipe!  I used 1/2 lb ground turkey for the meatballs and cooked them in the oven first (this ended up being plenty of meatballs).  I added celery for some added vegetables. Overall, it was very yummy!

This was my first attempt at making this kind of soup, and I was surprised how quickly it came together-we were enjoying it in no time at all!After reading reviews, I did add a little garlic powder to the meatball mixture, as it made sense to me. It's Italian, isn't it? It was delicious, and really healthy! I'll be making this recipe often.

Great recipe ~ I did change & add a few things.  I added boiled torn chicken breast, used "Miller's" chicken flavored soup base instead of canned broth (i use this in different flavors for all my soups, has more flavor), this time around I used pre-cooked mini meatballs & I always mix 2 egg whites & then add them when soup is boiling before serving.  I have grown up eating this soup but we never had an official written recipe so this helped w/the measurements.

Nice simple soup, I like it! The meatballs were easier to make with the rope technique but I could only roll them in my hand, two at a time instead of on the board. It was worth the effort, they are fun in this soup. I used orzo and added mushrooms. I added a little extra chicken base to give the stock a little more flavor.

This recipe is healthy comfort food at it's finest.  Of course I modified to suit my taste.  I used ground turkey rather than ground beef and made the meatballs with fresh, minced onion, italian style breadcrumbs (you'll need at least a cup if you are using 2 eggs; if not, reduce to one egg), and parmesan cheese.  Also I used half chicken stock and half chicken broth and added 5 stalks of celery.  I doubled the recipe and every bit was savored.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I love this recipe!  My husband loved it, and so did I.  There was plenty for leftovers for a few days and had it when we had dreary weather here.  Would do it again.  As I read in a previous review, I shaped the meat into a log and cut those into smaller sections - it made it every easy.  I added frozen spinach and some broccoli for added veggies.

Really tasty.  I did find it a bit strange for the first couple of bites.  Tasting what is essentially a chicken soup but tasting meatballs! You get used to it though.  I'm not rating it 5 stars because I found cooking the meatballs in the soup added too much extra fat.  I know this step is to add flavour but if your watching your fat intake it would be a good idea to cook the meatballs in the oven first and then add them to the soup.  I will do this next time.

This soup was wonderful! My family really liked it. I did use Italian flavored ground turkey instead of beef, though, and skipped the basil in the meatball mixture. I added a little extra onion and some celery as well. The soup cooked together very quickly and tasted delicious. Thanks for the great recipe!

It seemed that 2 eggs were too much (the meatballs were very hard to form with so much liquid - I'm not sure why it would matter, but maybe because I used turkey burger?).  Other than that, it was glorious and hit the spot.  I will definitely make again (with only 1 egg).  Final note: if you're big onto presentation, you may want to brown the meatballs - with turkey burger, they were whitish/gray cooked in the soup and not browned. Still tasted perfect though :)

Great recipe.  I use orzo's instead of shells, add a diced boneless chicken breast, use fresh basil, and use either fresh spinache or escarole.  

Turns out perfect everytime.

I have used this website to try out many recipes and this recipe actually made my boyfriend say "honestly this is the best meal you have ever made". Its very simple and I actually thought it was going to flop while I was making it. I would very much use extra lean ground beef as I used lean and I ended up taking a lot of grease off the top although I didn't cook the meatballs before which probably would have helped in removing the grease. I used a lot of garlic and more breadcrumbs than the recipe called for and used pepper and salt and many different spices as I was afraid it may turn out bland like others had said. I cooked the pasta seperatly for a bit and put it in to the soup only at the last 5 minutes. All in all very easy to make!

Wow, what a soup! I got tired of making the same soups over and over again and decided to try something new. My husband and I absolutely LOVED it! In fact we just ate it last night and he is asking for the leftovers for lunch (which makes this a winner). I followed the recipe to the t and it was delicious just as it is without any modifications. Try it you'll love it!

This was delicious and so easy to make. The grandkids loved helping to make the meatballs. Needless to say, the meatballs were all different shapes and sizes. Update~ I've gotten lazy and was in a hurry so I used frozen cocktail sized meatballs (thawed), added the basil and onion to my broth and in no time flat I had delicious Italian Wedding soup. NOBODY knew the difference. Now I will make homemade meatballs when my grandkids are here (just for the fun of it).  Enjoy

This was very good.  I did make a couple adjustments.  I made my own bread crumbs from left over Italian bread.  I also added 3 cloves of garlic to the meatball mix, was on the generous side of all the measurements and used Romano cheese instead of Parm.  I also sauted the extra onion I had and added that to the broth along with a couple shakes of Italian seasoning and 2 bay leaves.  I didn't add the spinach until the very end.  All in all it was very satifying.

This soup was very good. I used 1 package of frozen spinach, bowtie noodles and I precooked the meatballs in a frying pan, it turned out perfect! I will definitely make this one again.

I had gone to a restaurant and tried it but this recipe is better! Also good for the beginner cook as well. Although, on a bit of a budget (changed extra lean to lean ground beef, omitted the cheese) this recipe turned out very well, I will be making this again!

this is VERY yummy and very easy, just a bit tiring on the wrists rolling all those teeny meatballs.  i tried the trick of rolling them on the counter and just couldnt get it to stick.  its a bit of work, but its worth it.

Doubled this recipe for our large family - turned out wonderful!  The only thing I changed is making my own chicken broth/soup. Drained veggies (onion, celery, carrots, several potatoes). I used the cooked carrots from the broth instead of cutting my own up. Meatballls were fantastic - cook them in broth - I didn't see grease rise up at all.  This is the BEST Italian Wedding Soup I've ever had.  It puts the canned Italian Wedding Soups to shame.  Try it - you will not be disappointed.

Made this soup today and it was just as good as everyone said.  I used Acini di Pepe in place of pasta.  Didn't add to the soup though let everyone add their own as it really would have soaked up the broth.  Easiest wedding soup I have ever made!  Definite keeper.

This was really good. The meatballs turned out great and the soup was very tasty. My daughter who said she hated this dish when tried at a resturant went nuts for this recipe. My sons also raved about it flavor. Everyone including my picky husband had seconds. Luckily I made lots. I will make it again. Tastes good even as leftovers!

Hearty, filling, and flavorful for few ingredients and very little preparation. Like some others, I used ground turkey rather than beef. Also substituted 1/2 cup of rice for the breadcrumbs and used gluten free corn pasta for an entirely gluten free meal. It came out wonderfully! I'll definitely make it again!

This was a big hit at my house.  And I wasnt so sure it was going to be.  We never eat soup for dinner for some reason.  I left out the basil because I didnt have any, and I left out the onion because of picky children, but I added a bit of onion salt to the meatballs.  My husband was worried about "simmered" meatballs.  He has this thing about crispy meat.  But everyone loved it.  I thought it had a lot of flavor and it was incredibly easy to make.  I started the broth and dropped the meatballs in while i cut the veggies and just dropped in the spinach at the last minute.  We put grated parmesan on top and ate it with french bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great soup!  It was my first time making italian wedding and it turned out great.  I modified the recipe like others by browning the meatballs in a pan first with some fresh garlic- I think this really made a difference.  I also used ground turkey, low sodium-non fat chicken broth and it still tasted great!  Only change I'd make next time is add more spinach for more fiber :)  The only negative to this recipe is that it takes quite some time to roll all of the little meatballs- but its worth it!

This soup is great but I made so many changes I am not sure if the original recipe is what inspired the 5 stars. These are my changes: I added 1 tsp of minced garlic to the meatballs, I sauted the vegetables first, I browned the meatballs before adding to soup, I added a stalk of celery, I used Acini de pepe pasta, I used fresh basil in the meatballs and when everything was cooked and just about ready to serve, I added 3 eggs beaten with 1 cup Parmesan to the soup while I stired constantly. It was delicious and inspired by a soup that I had in Rome.

Good...but not dramatically good. I had some years ago and I was hoping this was it. It was a little more dense and flavorful. However, the recipe was not bad. Definitly pre cook the meatballs a little so you seal in the flavor and don't have all the grease. Also, Orzo works really well instead of shells.

Overall, this wasn't bad, but...  Next time, I am going to try to make it in a crockpot to let it simmer all day.  Maybe, that will add more flavor to it.  I think that that is what soup needs.  Also, it seems to need more broth.

I thought the soup had a good flavor. Realy a hearty meal,  serve it with biscuts or home made bread.  It takes a little time to make, but it's worth it.. My brother said to leave out the chick peas..

I can't say enough about this wonderful recipe. It is a complete and hearty meal in a pot. We froze leftovers in individual serving bowls for meals another day. I prefer to cook the meatballs first before putting them in the soup and I made my own chicken broth to make it less salty. It's a fabulous recipe and a better than fabulous meal.
Thanks, Lalena

I will definitely make this soup again. My husband LOVED it. The salt from the chicken stock had just enough flavor, so no need to add more salt! I used ground turkey and added an additional cup of pasta. I saw another review that recommended cooking the meatballs in the oven a little before adding it to the broth, so I tried it and I think it helped to keep the little meatballs in tact.  Really enjoyed it.

We loved this soup! My mom is usually the one in charge fo making the wedding soup, but I wanted to give it a try today myself. I did brown the meatballs before putting them into the soup and used pastina pasta instead of the seashell shape.  I served the soup with a parmesan crisp for dipping and the family really liked that. The family loves wedding soup and this version was no exception...I will be making this simple soup again and again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Excellent soup! So fast and easy. I used homemade chicken stock and rolled out the meatballs in 10 minutes. ...start to finish. ...done in 30 min.  Oh ya! Fried the meatballs first in 2tbsp cisco so they held together in the broth. Delicious!

Super yummy!  I used elk meat and added a little garlic.  Both of my boys ate and enjoyed it, daddy was gone hunting and missed out though.

This was great and I received lots of great compliments.  I did another reviewers addition of home made Parmesan cheeseballs instead of sprinkling the Parmesan overtop and it was a real hit!

I added the meatballs first to make sure they would be cooked through, then a few minutes later the pasta and carrots, and the spinach right at the end. Everything was perfect. Kids and parents all enjoyed it.

I made this yesterday for my family and they loved it. It has lots of flavour. I did use a pinch of Italian seasoning in my meatballs.chopped up an onion and put it in my soup instead. Also if you shape the meatballs into a rope then cut them in to equal sizes then roll them it's much easier less time consuming.

I make it often. Tried with meatballs cooked in the soup/broth and already baked in the oven. It's easier to pre cook the meatballs and freeze to have on hand when the urge hit to make another batch. This is one of our favorite soups and thanks for sharing!

I didn't have enough broth, so I had to add quite a bit of water to mine. My fault, I know. To compensate for the watered down broth, I added about a tablespoon of lemon juice, and about a teaspoon of lemmon and pepper seasoning, which did help to give it flavor. The meatballs were awesome, no complaints there. M really liked it, I wasn't too crazy about it. I might give this another go sometime. Thanks, Lalena.

Excellent soup! Took the following tips from previous comments: brown the meatballs before adding to the broth. Serve soup with a wedge of lemon to enhance the taste.

I made Italian Wedding Soup for the first time today and followed this recipe fairly closely.  I did do celery/onion/garlic first, added broth, then added carrots and simmered.  I browned the meatballs before putting them in the broth. The only thing I may change with those in the future is to use onion powder and perhaps some garlic powder instead of minced onion as it was hard to work with given the size of the meatballs.  I might also increase the breadcrumbs.  I used cut spaghetti and as usual used to much so had to add more broth.  The bottom line is that my family raved about this so much saying it was the best soup I ever made and I make a lot of soups they love.  Five + stars for this ones.  Thanks.

Awesome!  My husband said it was the best soup I've ever made.  It was really easy, too.  I did precook the meatballs a little in the oven, so they would be brown.  I also used about 2 cups bowtie pasta instead of the shells.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum!  We're moving soon, and I was trying to figure out ways to use frozen Italian meatballs other than just with pasta/red sauce.  I also had frozen spinach and frozen crinkle-cut carrots, so this was perfect.

I used my last 2 cartons of low sodium chicken broth + 2 cups water + 2 chicken bouillon cube and brought it to a boil, then just added 20 or 24 frozen meatballs, 1 pkg frozen spinach, the 3/4 bag of carrots I had left, and 2 cups of small shell pasta (I like noodles a lot, but maybe next time only 1.5 cups).    I also added a bit of basil, thyme, garlic salt, and onion powder, as I have a hard time not "spicing things up"...  Boiled for 8-10 mins, until the noodles were soft.  Couldn't have been easier!

Frozen meatballs are BIG, so I ended up cutting them into quarters once they were cooked (picked them up in Chinese soup spoon and kitchen-sheared them).

I asked my husband what he thought, and he said, "Meaty!"  High praise indeed!  ;)

This is a great soup, it scared me the first time I made it I though I had made spinach soup. Was so afraid it would taste just like spinach, but I was surprised and it turned out great. It is a simple thinish soup but really nice.

My husband is Italian and grew up with meatball soup.  He really liked this recipe.  I thought it didn't have a lot of flavor, but apparently that's how meatball soup is supposed to be.

This soup is surprisingly delicious, so simple and easy to make but really tastes like you spend all day making this soup.  I added celery to the soup and used Acini Di Pepe pasta (tiny round balls), but otherwise followed the recipe.  SO happy with the result!  Definitely will be making this one again.

Great easy soup! I substituted orzo as the pasta for personal preference. I also simmered the soup for about 20 min. which made the broth more flavorful, I think. Very hearty! My family was stuffed after 1 bowl and we had lots of leftovers.

This soup recipe was not my favorite tasting. I really didn't like the taste of it. What I might do next time is change the chicken broth; I used Progresso which I used in other dishes and Progresso is not my favorite tasting broth either. I will try this recipe again. The meatballs were okay but I think 3/4 size is too big for this soup. And the pasta was not enough; more pasta. That being said, this soup was just okay for me.

Used a melon ball scoop to make the meatballs.
They are uniform in size.  Also in original Wedding soup, you beat one egg with a few tbls. of paresan/romano cheese and with a fork draw each forkful  through the soup . Try it and eliminate the seashell pasta.

Excellent as is. A great light dinner served with italian bread.  My family loves eating it while watching TV.  They slurp on small bowls all evening.  What's not to like? While I hate reviews where people change the recipe I confess I do sometimes I add 1 clove of Garlic.  Another pet peve is the recipe calls for seashells and the picture shows rotelli!!!

I have been making this for quite a while. I have made a couple of changes. I use Orzo noodles instead of the pasta and I get my meatballs from Gordon's foods. They are already cooked which cuts prep time in half.

Almost as good as East Side Marios! I loved the flavor the spinach brought to the dish. I used those little balls of pasta instead of seashells and think it was a good idea. Easy to make dish I highly recommend!

Not bad! I used ground chicken for my meatballs and it came out pretty tasty. I added some garlic powder and a LOT of Italian seasoning. Doubled the spinach and used protein rich pasta elbows. The only thing I would do different and will do to my leftovers is add a chicken boullion cube to enhance the flavor of the broth or specifically purchas Wolfgang Pucks chix broth due to the added seasonings and flavors. Overall - this is a great recipe, I've got the base adn can add flare going forward! Thanks for sharing :)

Really good soup! I have always loved Italian Wedding Soup from a can so I decided to make my own. Nice flavors for a mild soup. Followed suggestions from others and baked the meatballs before adding them into the soup (be sure to use non-stick cooking spray on the baking sheet) and added garlic. Nice addition. Also, since all the Italian Wedding Soup I have had in the past had chicken meatballs, (not beef) I used ground chicken instead of ground beef, and it was very good.

excellent soup. I added 2 sliced Italian squash, 1 cup diced white onion and used half chicken stock & half broth. Added a little dry oregano to the soup, it came out very, very good.

I made this with homemade chicken bone broth and grassfed ground beef, and I didn't have regular bread crumbs, so I used panko.  I used a small cookie scoop to make the meatballs and that worked out really nicely (quick and easy). I did not pre-cook the meatballs, and that worked out great, not at all greasy.   I would definitely make this again.  My husband had two helpings and was still picking out meatballs from the children's bowls afterwards, he loved it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

The meatballs lacked flavor so next time I will follow other reviewers advice and add garlic to them.  otherwise it was very easy and quick to make.  A nice winter meal!

Absolutely a great soup. I took it to our monthly church gathering and I had numerous people ask me for the recipe. I double the batch since it was for a potluck, I added extra shells. To the meat, I added garlic powder, a good dash of season salt, and pepper. After reading the other reviews, I also baked the meatballs. It was excellent. I will make it again.

Really good, made just as directed, although the spinach was frozen. Used 'better than bullion' for the broth. Will be putting this in the rotation!

This was delicious!  I used extra lean ground chicken and omitted the eggs in the meatballs (I can't eat red meat or eggs), subbed a tsp of garlic powder for the onions and added a tsp of dried parsley and a pinch of black pepper.  The meatballs stayed together wonderfully and tasted great!  Also, I used 1/2 cup mini alphabet pasta.  My only complaint (and this is with any soup that contains pasta) is that leftovers become stew as all the pasta soaks up the liquid.  Next time I might cook the pasta separately and then add only when I'm serving the soup or just used 1/4 cup of the mini pasta.

Amazing Soup...the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I changed it up and I didn't try the original. I added more breadcrumbs and used the Italian kind I also used turkey burger instead so it was healthier and added a minced glove of garlic. I also cooked the meatballs in 350 degrees for 15 minutes and used orzo pasta. It was AMAZING!!

We enjoyed this.  I followed the ingredients exactly.  The only change I made was cooking the meatballs in a pan before transfering them to the soup.  It was surprisingly easy to put together and is going fast!

Really good simple and easy.  I just made regular size meatballs.  I accidentally put the meatballs in before the broth boiled and they came apart slightly but overall was delish!

I love this recipe and make often.  The things I do different is use turkey for the meatballs.  Saute carrots and onions and some garlic then add the chicken broth.

I made this a couple of months ago for a dinner party - it was a great hit.  I made my own meatballs and used Acini di Pepe for the pasta - it was difficult to find but "Prince" does make it.  As far as making the small meatballs, I used a mellon baller for scouping it before rolling it around in my hand, only a little bit quicker - but this soup is well worth it. I had made extra and froze it [without the pasta] just added pasta to it after defrosting it, tasted just as good as the day I made it.  Yes, this can be a bit time consuming , but it is very easy to make. Thanks for the receipe.

This just turned out okay. The broth didn't have much flavor and the meatballs didn't stay together well. It would take a lot of tweaking to make this delicious.

I browned the meatballs first and added some chopped red bell pepper, it was great. My daughter was calling it "Rainbow soup" and ate 2 bowls.

my family liked this a lot.  i thought it could use more umph in the broth, seasoning-wise, but this was my first time with italian wedding soup & i don't know if this is standard fare or not.  i think my kids liked it because it wasn't too seasoned/spicey.  next time i would add more spinach & carrots than listed in the recipe.

We really liked this recipe.  I browned the meatballs and I didn't have any basil so I used oregano.  The first bite didn't WOW me but after I ate a few more I was impressed.  I had never had Italian Wedding Soup before; my boyfriend had only had it out of a can, but we both thought this was a great recipe that we would like to try again.

Very good. I will make again. I will, however, not use chicken base (bouillon) to make the broth as it was rather salty!

I was very excited with how this came out - I will admit, I am one of those people who made changes the first time that I made it but not on purpose!!  I ended up not having the carrots and fresh spinach like I thought but had already made the meatballs so improvised with great results!   I made the meatballs with fresh parsley instead of basil, added garlic powder and a little extra onion with no bread crumbs.   I used about half of box of defrosted frozen spinach, celery, and since I was out of carrots I put in a can of cannellini beans so it wouldn't be too much meat.  I used a bit more pasta and VOILA!!  All family members approved - including my Italian hubby!

I can't believe how good this came out.  Followed ingredient list exactly, except I added some salt and pepper to the broth. Pre-cooked the pasta, which made the end result much better--just threw al dente pasta in the soup right before serving. My very picky husband was so thrilled! I always known he likes something if he says, "On a scale of one to ten, how difficult was this to make?" That means he wants me to make it again and again.

I thought this was an excellent soup. My husband commented that it even tasted healthy. To him that's a good thing. I didn't change the basic ingredients at all. I only used egg whites instead of whole to cut some fat and cholesterol. I didn't have the full 2 1/2 quarts of stock so I made up for it with water and. I didn't have bread crumbs on hand so I double toasted 2 slices of dill rye bread and crumbled them into the meat mixture. Over all very good!

WOW! My hubby and kids will not stop talking about how much they LOVED this soup!  I read other reviews and tweaked the recipe a bit.  I added to the meatballs (fresh crushed garlic, onion powder, oregano, parm cheese, parsley) and cooked them in olive oil before adding to soup (my family would not like boiled meatballs).  I also cooked the pasta (al dente).  I also used less broth (it was all I had) so it was a bit less soupy and more stew like.   I used a small scoop to make the meatballs (and I still think they were a bit too big) but easy none the less.   All in all.....it was DELISH!  And I will be making this again and again!!!

This is a good recipe!  My husband insists on buying ground turkey, which I just do not like, so I decided to use it for the meatballs.  Worked out well, used liquid egg substitute rather than eggs and chilled the meatballs after making them. Added some garlic powder too. The meatballs are white, but taste good.  Orzo rather than shell pasta, but just because that is what I had on hand.  I love flexible recipes, this is a keeper!  Thanks!

Great, straightforward comfort-food dish. Also, super easy. Didn't have ground beef, so we used ground chicken instead (boneless, skinless chicken breast in a food processor). Left the onion out of the meatballs and instead added onion powder, garlic powder, and pepper. We halved the recipe but more than doubled the veggies to make it more filling - carrots, celery, and mushrooms were a total of 2cups. 1cup of spinach. Finally 1/2cup of pasta, dash of oregano, a sprig of thyme, a bay leaf and Voila!

AMAZING!  This was a quick and easy recipe to make.  I felt that the prep time was right on for me.  I opted to add three cloves of minced garlic and 1/4 cup of feta cheese to the meatball mixture.  I also think that I will add mushrooms to the soup next time around.  I hope you keep going to weddings and posting more of your inspired recipes :D

The basil and onion was a bit much in the meatball. I added two hard boiled eggs(like my gramma used to), and the extra 1/2 quart of broth. Next time I'll use less basil and omit the onion(add garlic).

Thanks for the recipe.  I found this recipe to be rather bland; I tried to jazz up the meatballs a bit with a little extra onion, some minced garlic, and extra basil, and I put a few bay leaves in the chicken broth also.  Still found this to be bland; added lots of Tabasco (which I do to everything...), and that helped a bit.

I'm a big wedding soup fan but don't have tons of time.  I still utilized a Sunday to make this recipe, for the meatballs, but it was fairly quick, easy, and surprisingly very good - definitely a make again recipe. Could easily make the meatballs ahead of time and then make the soup on a weeknight.

This was a very tasty soup and really hit the spot.  I had never made meatballs before, but it was a lot easier than I thought.  Sangiovese is a really good wine to pair with this because it's so nice and smooth.

Deee-lish.  This is a keeper. A couple of minor changes that I will keep.  Added garlic powder to the meatballs.  Forgot the minced onion in the meatballs, but finely diced 1/2 medium onion and added with the carrots and spinach.  Added some garlic powder and a touch of dried oregano and dried thyme to broth before added vegetables, meatballs, and pasta (used tiny pasta).

Great recipe - tasty and very easy to make.  Based on other reviews, I used more breadcrumbs and added minced garlic to the meatballs.  Next time, I would also use more veggies and/or less broth, because I somehow ended up with a weird broth/meat/veggie ratio (i.e. too meat- and broth-heavy and not enough veggies)

I made this yesterday (on a cold and SNOWY October day in Boston). It was so good and warming.  I used acini di pepe for the pasta and added garlic to my meatballs.  Can't wait for lunch!!

Like others noted, the meatballs need a little kick, but other than that, great recipe that is easy to make wtih ingredients around the kitchen.  I added more pasta than it called for and it absorbed a lot of the broth - bad move.

I was looking for a new soup to make.  Husband really enjoyed this....I thought it was ok! I read other reviews, and I agree that the meatballs needed more breadcrumbs otherwise they would be too wet for my liking. I think the next time I make this I will cook the meatballs in the broth first, then add veggies and cook pasta separately.

Just whipped up a batch of this for my dog who has not only a insulinoma but, liver cancer and needs to eat a high protein , low sugar  diet!  I used one can chicken broth, opened a can of spinach and threw a good pinch of it directly into the beef , egg, parmesan , oregano, parsley and oatmeal mixture.  I used ditali pasta as he has lost some teeth so, smaller pasta is easier for him to  lap up :D  Just took a taste of it and Yum!  I just know my dog is going to "woof" this right up!!  Thanks for the fast easy recipe

***** My baby passed away 11.4.2009,  so glad he got to have some of this yummy soup before leaving us*****

Loved the flavor of these little meatballs! I baked them in the oven for 15 min to drain some of the fat first, then added them at the end. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. Great tasting soup!

This.is.amazing.  Seriously, try this soup!  Like other reviewers, I added garlic powder and onion powder to the broth (used home-made).  I also added brown rice instead of pasta.  I think the secret is to let all the ingredients simmer together for a long time, at least 30 minutes--this way, the broth absorbs the flavor of the meatballs, even if they have been precooked.

I made this soup because my son loves the Campell's version, which I never found very impressive.  This is delicious and even though it was a fair amount of work, with all those tiny meatballs, it was so worth it, although I think it spoiled my son to the store-bought type.

I didn't use the pasta or the carrots in this soup and I doubled the cheese in the meatballs.  It is delicious!  I actually made it several months ago and froze the leftovers in small jars in my freezer.  I had one of the last servings today for lunch.  It freezes beautifully!  Thanks for a great recipe!

WONDERFUL!!  I have kiddos that stick their noses up to any type of veggies, but they loved this.  It has great vitamins from the spinach and protein from the meat.  Nothing like sneaking nutrition into your childrens food!!

Easy soup to make and great tasting! I did like someone suggested by putting a squeeze of lemon juice into it at the end and it made all the difference. My kids loved it. I did cook the meatballs in the oven for 10 minutes at 350 but I really don't think they need it. I will be making this again.

Absolutely fantastic! I have used different types of pasta like small bow ties and shells also added ¼ cup diced celery. My wife isn’t a big spinach fan and she loves this soup too.

This was a good base as written but needed more flavor to satisfy my family. I added 2 tablespoons parley flakes and 2 teaspoons of pizza seasoning (Oregano, Basil, Marjoram, Garlic Granules.) Very Tasty.  Gave it four stars because I had to add seasonings.

Excellent soup! Family loved it. I did add cut up onions and fresh garlic to the broth and it was delish!  Also thought adding stewed tomatoes next time would be really good.  Sprinkled with parmesan cheese and it was an easy and delicious dinner!!

:-(  Both my husband and I thought this recipe was bland.  It tasted like ground beef in broth.  I tried to doctor it up ~ adding fresh garlic, some italian seasoning.  Nothing helped.  Maybe our taste buds just need a little more pow!

This was absolutley delicious.  I added pork to the meatballs and spinach to the soup, as that is what I had on hand.  With fall approaching, I'm sure this will be a staple on a cold night! Thank you

This tastes just like it came from a restaurant.  Delicious.  We did a few things differently:  we used ground turkey instead of beef, we were out of bread crumbs so we used some oats and cornmeal, we used a 10-oz frozen spinach box and we added some fennel seeds to it.

Wow!  This soup was soooooo good.  My husband loved it as well as I.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and made a rope out of the meat mixture and make small slices which I then rolled into mini meatballs.  This really helped and it only took 10 minutes to roll about 50 of them.

This was very good and hearty. I used fresh spinach and canned corn because I didn't have carrots. Also used venison burger because we have a friend that hunts and gives us a lot. Used about a cup and a half of shells but you don't need to, recipe was right.

Solid 41/2 stars!  I was totally prepared to add more spices to this when it was done.  The only spice listed is in the meatballs, none in the soup. To my surprise, it didn't need a thing added for taste! I had to use chopped frozen spinach, since I couldn't find fresh in December in Wisconsin :) and I always make my own broth from Orrington Farms soup base.  This was a great hot soup for a cold winter night and will be added to our regular rotation.  Even the picky 6 year old loved it (spinach and all).  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent!! The meatballs take a little extra time, but well worth the effort.  I cooked them first and used reduced sodium chicken broth for a poprtion of the chicken broth.

This soup was PERFECT for my neighborhood's Italian Progressive Dinner.  (I had 'soup/salad' course).  I received rave compliments.  I also precooked the meatballs in the oven the night before. Doing that also got this most labor intensive part out of the way. I tried to use a melon baller to shape them, but it really didn't work well for me.  I then had this simmer to cook in my crockpot the entire day of the party.  Yum!

I like this soup a lot. I tweak it by using beef broth because I tend to use chicken broth quite a bit in cooking and it's nice to have some variety.

Wonderful! Very close to real wedding soup. Agree that to make the meatballs less time intensive, roll out the beef (or turkey, both work fine) into a long 'rope' then cut meatballs. Also makes it easier to keep them small.

Fabulous!  I made this recipe and really loved it. My family got nuts with it.  My Husband is Italian and told me it was as good as his mom used to make. Love it!

Very good.  I did add minced garlic, 1 splash of hot sauce, white pepper and salt to taste.  The broth seemed to  need a little something. The seasonings helped make it excellent.

This was an excellent meal that I prepared. The meatballs were so good, and I would like to try the recipe for meatballs to go with spaghetti. I didn't know if you used fresh spinach or frozen, but I used fresh and it turned out wonderful. I will definantly make again, especially on very cold wintery days. This was my first try making an Italian Wedding Soup and I was highly impressed. Mmmmmmm.

i followed the advice on baking the meatballs first and adding minced garlic to the meatballs. also used italian style breadcrumbs.first soup i have ever made and it was really good. except cambells chicken broth is way too salty. next time ill use swanson's low sodium. thanks for the recipe.update, i added more water to the soup and it helped with the saltyness and my 6 year old son has had 4 bowls of it for the past two days. best meal ive made from scratch.

My husband loves soup, and we agreed this rates about four stars. We took the advice of previous posters and fiddled a little ourselves on the minor details, like adding more herbs and taking out the minced onion (we're picky and don't like them). That's all personal preference; but we would have enjoyed another half cup of carrots and and a LOT more broth. Once the pasta and the meatballs soaked it up, it was denser than stew! We used 96 ounces and should have had another 49-ounce can, so use a huge pot if you're reading this! But that's easy enough to add later, thankfully. We dished up enough for about 10 servings if you add a little more broth. More carrots + more broth = five stars!

This receipe was AWESOME.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and browned the minnie meatballs in garlic flavored olive oil.  I may add garlic to the meatball mixture next time, but I cannot wait to try this after it has been sitting in the fridge all night.  Bravo !!!!!!!!!!

This soup was absolutely delicious.  My husband is very picky and he LOVED it - he took leftovers for lunch today so he could brag about it.  I used the basic recipe and made very few changes.  I baked the meatballs at 350F for 20 minutes and simmered everything but the pasta for a few hours.  I used orzo instead of seashells and it soaked up a bit of the broth so next time I will add a cup or two of broth.  This is a definite keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

I just finished making this soup..it is just as good..if not better than the restaraunts!  I followed some of the advice and made a few alterations.  I added garlic to the meatballs, and I browned them before adding them to the broth.  I also added a little minced onion to the broth.  All in all this is a recipe I will make again and again! Thanks for sharing it!

Great Recipe.  I would add more noodles.  Be sure to use a lean hamburger.  I used 73% lean and there was too much fat.

I just loved this soup! I did make changes but I know the basic taste is there.  I just wanted to make the meat balls a bit healthier so I used ground turkey, I used blended whole oats and added some ground flaxseed to make my measurement correct for the breadcrumbs.  I feel I saved some fat calories and added a touch of fiber.  And since I used Acina de pepe I used about twice as much.  You get a good number of small meatballs with this also, maybe 80 or so.  Really the best I have have ever tasted.  YUMMY!

Very good and easy to make. I cut the recipe in half and it turned out well. Something was missing in the seasoning, though, so I think I will fiddle with the spices a bit. I found myself adding salt and pepper before eating it.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and everybody absolutely LOVED IT!!  I took the advice of others and broiled the meatballs first (which were very tasty), and added the pasta just 15 minutes prior to serving it.  Serve with grated parmesan cheese and I'm sure they'll love it too!!

I made this with a lot of changes, based on what I had available. First, I used a mix about 50% ground pork, 40% beef, and 10% chicken. 

I doubled the amount of basil and minced onion called for. Instead of just diced carrots, I used an equivalent amount of mixed frozen veggies (carrots, corn, and peas), and added it to the meatballs. I also used panko instead of breadcrumbs. 

For the broth, I didn’t have chicken broth, so I used a vegetarian mushroom broth powder that I got from Taiwan (it has MSG in it), put some dried Italian parsley in the soup, plus some salt and freshly ground black pepper.

I cooked some spiral pasta in a separate pot, then ladled some from each pot into serving bowls.

Overall, it was great, except I would try to use a leaner cut of ground meat next time, and maybe baking it first to render out some of the fat. As some people before me have said, cooking the meat in the soup made the soup greasy.

No matter what the soup, I always start off with diced onions , celery & carrot simmering in extra virgin olive oil . Mirepoix is the name give this process by French chefs.

A friend made this and posted it on facebook. I am just adding the comments here to what she did different so I can make it like that next time I crave it. 

I doubled the meatball part of the recipe and actually used Jimmy Dean’s Sage Italian Sausage roll (2lbs) instead of beef. Added about 2.5c of seashells, and one whole carrot... to be honest, I basically eyeballed...to my liking, the amounts of all the ingredients. You really can’t go wrong.

My family loved this soup and it was so easy to make! I swapped out the spinach and used baby kale instead, I also used a little chopped onion and garlic that I sautéed before heating but the chicken broth and then threw in a bay leaf.

Very good and filling. This recipe puts the canned version to shame, which every homemade soup should. My only changes were that I used turkey sausage with the skins removed instead of ground beef and better than bullion instead of chicken broth. In the future, I think I will add sauteed onions and cannellini beans.

Easy, very good, and I will make it again. I might cut down on the minced onion next time. I thought it was a touch strong. I did make 2 changes. I'm not a fan of spinach; so I used escarole. Also, I did not have any shells; so I used acini de pepe as the pasta.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated. I always do.  I thought the soup was bland and tasteless.  I added salt, which helped but somehow it just misses. I will look for another recipe and try it again.

Yum, I did use ground turkey and matzoh crackers as I didn't have bread crumbs for the meatballs.  Used frozen spinach per other users and orzo noodles.  It turned out great!

we love this recipe. my husbands favorite. we made some changes. I found that if I use chicken base and water as opposed to premade broth, we get a more rich great tasting broth. I dont have to dump in tons of salt to get a better flavor. for my meatballs I use half ground chicken and half bulk sweet Italian sausage. that really steps up the game flavor wise. its a great freezer meal. I cook the meatballs and vacumn seal everything together except for spinach and broth. I add those of course when we go to make it. this is our tried and true wedding soup recipe!

This was so delicious and so easy. I cheated and used Costco meatballs (cut into fourths) and added them at the end. A sprinkle of Italian cheese on top is a must.

Made this with the same ingredients, but added the pasta 15 minutes before it was done and then the meatballs and spinach just 8 minutes before the end.  Added red pepper flakes to the meatballs and baked them at 350 for 22 minutes rather than cooking in the soup. I took the advice of another reviewer by creating little Parmesan/egg/bread crumb balls to add to the top of the soup in the last five minutes. Turned out terrific, my husband and I love it.

Don't let the simple ingredients fool you.  This is a tasty, soup esp on cold nights. I made a double a batch and gave half to my daughter. Between her and her roommate, it was eaten within 2 days.

This soup is really delicious! The meatballs were in fact labor intensive but the end result was worth it. I did precook the balls in the oven to get some of the fat out but otherwise made it as written. Big WOW! Next time I’ll try the little cheese ball additions but truly this recipe is outstanding as is.

This was excellent. The only change I made was to sear off the meatballs in a skillet but I don't think that is necessary. I'll probably try just dropping them in the boiling broth the next time. I made no other changes to the receipe. This dish was super easy to follow and quick. Only time consuming part was rolling out the tiny meatballs but really no big deal. All the picky eaters in my house wolfed it down, even after they found out it had spinach in it. Will definitely make again.

My husband loved it.  I thought it was a little bland.  Added celery, onion, salt and pepper to the leftovers and it was yummy!  Will be making it again.  I also used ground venison and baked the meatballs at 350 till they were almost done.

It was delicious! I served the soup with crusty Italian bread which was  lovely.  My family really enjoyed it and are looking foward to having it again.  I made the meatballs with ground turkey rather than beef and baked it  in the oven seperately before adding to the soup.  I only used 1/2 C pasta  which was perfect for us. The next day we had the soup for lunch. There wasnt quite enough for 4 of us so i   With added more chicken broth and heated it up for a delicious hearty lunch the next day.  Thanks for the recipe!

LOVE this recipe and have made it a dozen times! It's one of my favourite cool fall day go to comfort recipes. So simple and so flavourful. Labour intensive sure, takes about 20min rolling little meatballs but totally worth it. I bake the meatballs a little first until they are 3/4 done to avoid some of the grease.

I made this soup and added onion and celery along with the carrots.  I also added some oregano and bay leaf.    For my choice of pasta I used pastina  and all the vegetables were cut very very small.   To the bowl of soup I sprinkled some Parmesan Romano cheese.  Very delicious!!  Everyone loved it!

Very satisfying!  I used very lean ground beef so it was not greasy.  Added a few slices of jalapeño and 1/4 tsp of red pepper.  Loved it and shared the recipe right away.

This is the tastiest and easiest soup I've ever made!!! No peeling potatoes, low in fat, and so filling! I've made this as listed multiple times and still love the flavor. Just make sure to add your fresh spinach at the end when there's only about 2 or less minutes of cooking time left. I'm not sure why a few people have complained about the time consuming meatballs. I just pinch and roll. This soup is DONE in less than 20 minutes.

I changed a few things, but my family said it was the best they had ever had. I used mild Italian sausage instead of ground beef to make the meatballs.

Just added 2-3 T lemon juice to broth. Also added garlic powder to meatballs and cooked the carrots with some chopped onion and garlic in a T of olive oil  just to soften. I also cook the pasta by itself while I'm making the meatballs because I like that a little al dente. Perfecto! My family loves it and requests it about once a week.  I use ground turkey and have never had any greasiness just dropping them right in soup to cook.

As a time-saver, I used thawed spinach, and pre-made mini-meatballs and pre-boiled the pasta. The broth ingredients were cooked ahead of time, and then added the meatballs and pasta at the end. Got compliments from company.

Just made this, but with a few changes.....used 2 boxes of Chicken broth and 1 Vegetable broth and cooked down 2 Turkey wings for added flavor......worked!!   Also sauteed celery, carrots , shallots & garlic....worked nicely.  Saved Turkey meat for another use.   Added 1 Italian sausage link into the meatballs for added flavor, plus fresh parsley.  Baked the meatballs for 9 min. on 350* convection which worked well.
We both enjoyed the flavors of this soup very much...worth the meatball effort.   Would not hesitate to serve for company with baguettes and a nice salad!

Great recipe and super easy!  I did make a couple tweaks.  1.  I left out the cheese because I didn't want the dairy.  2.  I added an additional tspn of Italian seasoning to the meatballs to give them more flavor.  3.  I added about a tspn each of oregano paste, basil paste and tomato paste to the broth.  4.  I used orzo instead of shells.   Make sure you use 93/7 ground beef.

I thought the carrot made it too sweet. But it was an ok soup. I would rather have a Cajun Court Bouillon.

My partner had a craving for Italian wedding, and I caved. This soup was great and used a bunch of veggies I had in my fridge. I added a few substitutions: kale instead of spinach and turnips mixed with carrots. Followed some other reviews and seared the (turkey) meatballs before cooking. I also added about 2.5 tsps lemon juice at the very end. Look forward to making this again!

This recipe is pretty tasty. I substituted noodles and bread crumbs for gluten free ingredients (rice shell noodles and gluten free bread crumbs). It translates very well to a gluten free recipe. My two kids (who take HOURS to eat their dinners) had little trouble finishing their bowls.

My family loved it! They all went back for more. We added some tortellini, which made it absolutely delicious (not that it wasn’t already). Amazing recipe!

Really good soup. I did cook my meatballs before adding them to soup. Glad I did because the beef still made the soup kinda greasy. I also used escarole instead of spinach just because that's how much family always made it.

Perfect!  Adapt it to your liking, using what you have on hand.  Doesn't have to be so rigid.  I had to use oregano instead of basil, still delicious.  I like the idea of making the mini meatballs by rolling the meat into a rope and cutting it into 3/4" pieces.  I made my meatballs a little bigger.  Next time I will double my batch!

This soup was a hit in my house. I only had ground pork on hand so used that and the meatballs turned out great. Instead of the pasta I used a can of butter beans. Will make this again.

I used a combo of chicken and beef broth for a richer flavor and upped the amount of pasta for a heartier consistency. This is as close to the soup from the ladies at St. Francis of Assisi as you can get!

I used orzo pasta and frozen meatballs. I used high-quality small frozen meatballs that were already cooked, so it cut down on the time to make it and added flavor. I added quite a bit of salt and pepper to ensure the flavor, but that's because I used unsalted chicken stock. With these substitutions it ended up being one of the best soups I've ever made. Allrecipes never steers me wrong!

I use triple mix (ground beef, veal and pork) instead of extra lean ground beef and then fry the meatballs first. Excellent recipe.

This was my first attempt at making Italian Wedding Soup and it turned out perfectly, better than any I had tasted in restaurants. I did not have any seashell pasta on hand but I had some pearl coucous  and it worked wonderfully well. The only note I made for future use was to give more time for making the meatballs as it took me another hour but I will gladly sacrifice more time to reproduce this recipe.

Scrumptious! Like many,  I changed the recipe a bit for my taste.  I added a bit of Italian seasoning, pepper, and more breadcrumbs to the meatballs. I then chose to bake the meatballs before adding them to the soup. (350 degrees, about 12 mins) I think baking helped the flavor and to decrease the grease  in the soup. 
When starting the soup,  to build flavor,  I first  cooked the carrots, along with some onion and celery until soft with pepper, Italian seasoning, and garlic salt. I only had two quarts of broth/stock, so I just used that.  I ended up  using about double the spinach and rather than regular noodles, I substituted with a package of tri-color cheese tortellini. ( I cooked the tortellini before adding to soup)
All in all, really yummy soup! Great for a cool day!

Very good!  Next time, I'll decrease the basil and increase the pasta.  I had not-so-lean hamburger, so baked my meatballs at 350 for 15 minutes and drained them on paper towels before putting them in the soup.

Incredibly easy to make, and it's ready in less than half an hour. These ingredients are usually here in the house, so I don't fret over something I'm missing. Next time, smaller meatballs half-inch

I thought it was a four but my soup hating hubs said 5. I made this exactly as written. I tried the rope method for the meatballs that someone suggested but I will stick with the cookie scoop method.  This is a top notch recipe but the meatballs would be much better with fresh garlic and parsley, IMHO, and perhaps a parmesan cheese rind in the broth. Sorry, I did make two changes, I had planned on using pastina but was out so I used tubetti rigati that I cooked separately.

This soup was really good.  My dad especially loved it.  I added 2 cloves of garlic and used smaller noodles (about 1/2 of what was called for the shells).  I also prepared the meatballs according to another review, omitting the parmesan cheese.  It was really tasty.  Thanks for all of the reviews.

This soup is really good.  Quicker way to make the meatballs, use a very small cookie dough scooper, like an ice cream scooper, but much smaller.  Also, use ground chicken or turkey instead of beef.  Not greasy at all and do not cook them first.  I also use powdered chicken soup base and water instead of canned chicken broth.  It has much more flavour.  I have been asked to make this many times for different dinners.  Love it.

My family loved this!  I made a few tweaks, though:  I used ground chicken instead of beef, added garlic to the meatballs, added escarole/endive at the end & used Barilla tortellini!   Also, I dropped the meatballs into the broth using a cookie scoop-saved time. I'll definitely be making this again.!!

Made as written except for using escarole instead of spinach. Excellent recipe, the meatballs were very flavorful. Thanks for the great recipe. The whole family loved it. Also, no need to precook the meatballs. I believe it taste better when you cook as directed.
Made the 2nd time as written with frozen chopped spinach, again a big hit with everyone!

It's quite good IF: you brown the meatballs first, put the carrots in the broth to cook a bit while you brown the meat, DON'T put the spinach in til everything is done, then just 2 minutes to wilt the spinach. THEN it's really good.

I followed another reviewer and rolled the meat into a roll and cut into segments. It worked out great and saves time. As u added the meatballs it seemed like they weren't going to brown and they looked a little unappetizing so I quickly browned the remaining ones in the oven. Will def make this again!

I made this and it turned out delicious! I did substitute Italian sausage for the hamburger and the mix was pretty wet so we added another 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs. Everyone crowed it down!

The only change I made was I fried the meatballs a little bit before putting them in. But overall it was a really good meal. No complaints from this family!

This had a good broth base to it but I found that I didn't like the spinach in it at all. I also thought it lacked flavor. I made it exactly as the recipe stated except used frozen Italian meatballs. Which could have contributed to the flavorless taste. I would not make this soup again.

I really liked this recipe.  I used ditalini instead of the larger shells, which worked better in my opinion.  Make sure to make the meatballs small enough to easily eat in one bite; otherwise you will be splashing hot soup.  I've added a variety of vegetables as well, including diced summer squash, zucchini, carrots, celery, button mushrooms, even tiny Roma tomatoes.  I have added the vegetables raw to the soup, and I've sautéed them a bit in garlicky olive oil, and I liked the lightly sautéed vegetables better.  I used homemade stock whenever possible, as the stock really is an important component of the dish.

Delicious! Here's what i did for the meatballs: used a mix of pork and beef, omitted the parmesan, added 1/2 tsp salt, browned the meatballs. For the stock: added 3tbsp italian seasoning, 1 tbsp garlic seasoning, fresh ground pepper, added an extra 1/2 cup pasta shells, reduced spinach by 1/2 cup and made sure to add it last so it was vibrant green when served.

Soup was delicious, but I did make some changes.  Definitely  need more broth (if you are feeding more than 3 people), do not cook the pasta in the broth, do it separately and add to bowl.  Seasoned the broth with George Washington Seasoning and much more seasoning in the meatballs.  Made with spinach.  Bottom line is that you have to taste as you are going along.  Everyone has their own preferences.

I've made this using homemade meatballs and pre made meatballs from the store. Both were delicious! Making the meatballs was a bit time consuming, but they did taste better than the store bought ones. I'll make this recipe using both methods depending on how much time I have. Wonderful with crescent rolls for dipping in the broth!

This soup is delicious!  I have made it numerous times and have tweaked the recipe based on my preference.  Go heavy on the cheese!  I prefer Romano cheese and add a package of mushrooms to the soup as well.   I made this for my boyfriend and he liked it so much he ate it for lunch and dinner for the next three days!

I'll definitely make this again.  I did make a few changes though.  I used ground pork instead of beef, and I baked them for 25 minutes at 350 before putting them in the soup.  I used a crock pot, which worked great!  And I added some pesto and a store-bought grated parmesan with Italian spices to the broth, which ended up tasting fantastic.

OH SO DELICIOUS.  I would give more stars if I could.  Made this with ground turkey and low sodium chicken broth.    I had to add more bread crumbs to the mix because of the turkey.  Formed the meatballs, put them on two cookie sheets and baked them at 325 for 15 minutes to firm them up.    Used Acini de Pepi pasta and it was the perfect size.  Had to take it for lunch the next day and could not wait for a dinner leftover.  Wonderful

I was looking for a quick and easy Italian wedding soup recipe to make (which this was). However, this soup was pretty bland when I served it. I would definitely suggest adding salt and pepper to the pot, especially if you used low-sodium chicken broth like I did. I would also suggest adding garlic to both the meatballs and the soup as well as some other spices like oregano and basil. Lastly, I would suggest quickly baking the meatballs first before adding them to the soup. This recipe was a good, basic attempt, but you definitely have to tweak it to give it some flavor.

I love Italian wedding soup and this recipe was straightforward and easy to make! It is perfect for a fall day or to cure a sniffling cold. The only thing I would recommend is seasoning the meatballs a bit more with pepper/salt for taste. At the Italian restaurant I used to work for, we used ancini dI Pepe (small bead-like pasta) which gave the soup a nice texture. Enjoy!

We loved it. I used Costco's grass-fed lean ground beef and it was perfect. I also had a box of Panko Italian Bread Crumbs, so I used that -- very easy to measure the required amount of bread crumbs into the mix. As another reviewer mentioned, I rolled the meat mixture between my hands to make a rope, then I was able to cut or pinch off just the right amount for a meatball. I did use the option to change the 10 servings to 5 servings, and it worked perfectly. I will definitely use this recipe again -- but next time, I may try ground chicken. I wonder what it would be like to use fresh-frozen and thawed fish pieces?

Beef broth works here too. Club House brand Parmesan & Herbs one-step seasoning (3 TBs) along with the 2 eggs & bread crumbs works like a charm. Instead of lumpy onion bits (or basil) inside the balls, sauté and add onions to the broth along with the un-sautéed carrots. Shape meat into a "rope", cutting the rope into segments, then roll a bunch of the segments  at once with your hand pressed against the counter, on parchment, for easy cleanup. And for heavens sake, sauté them prior to adding to the soup!
Yummy cheese balls: beat an egg and add enough Parmesan to form a stiff ball. Make them small - about grape size -  bc they expand. Drop into soup at the end, to avoid overcooking. Always make more of these rather than less. Pickled eggs make a perfect side.

I tweaked the recipe... In a hot soup pot w/ EVOO add the chopped carrors, 1 cup sliced thin celery and 1 cup of chopped onion. Saute for about 10 min... I did 2 boxes of 48 oz chicken stock. Make the meatballs according to the directions. We made them the 3/4 in size, but they can go a little smaller. Bring the soup to boil and then add meatballs and simmer for about 15 min ... Add Spinach - start another boil and then simmer for 10 min.... As for the pasta I cook it by itself and not in the soup. I used about 2 cups of dry small shells -- 1 1/2 cups would have been better. After the 10 min cooking of the spinach turn the pot off and add the cooked pasta. Serve w/ grated Parmesan cheese.... Oh, use the fresh or wedge of Parmesan ... Grate really fine for the meatballs and more chunky when serving the soup

I've had this before from a can, but never made it. It's way tastier home made for sure, and not that time consuming using the "rope" method mentioned here for making the meatballs. Followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have seashell pasta so I used up some bow ties I had. Thought it could have had a little more spice, will try some garlic as suggested next time. Will serve this again. Don't forget to sprinkle Parmesan to your liking on top when it's in the bowl, i used grated and it melted all nice and stringy.

LOVED IT!!!! I added mushroom slices and 2 extra cups of spinash.  Also we used sodium free chicken broth (trying to watch that salt).  Kinda made this at the last min and didn't have any ground meat in the house but I did have sweat Italian sausage in the freezer. I took them out of their casing and rolled them into little balls.  We also used Bow ties instead of shells for the pasta.  We made a big pot to last all week and it was gone in two days!!! I will totally be making this again and again.

This soup is really very good, I will be adding this into my dinner rotation for sure!  I took the suggestion of a few reviewers and browned the meatballs in a pan just to try it, and it was good. Next time I will try as written, to just throw them in the broth to cook for comparison.

Love this!  have made it twice now, the homemade meatballs, while seriously labor intensive - are well worth it!  I browned them in a frying pan first with a bit of oil, drained on paper towels and tossed them into the soup later.  sooo good with some crusty bread!!!!

Loved the recipe but I made the meatballs with 1/2 lb ground turkey and 1/2 lb sweet sausage. Sausage made the soup so savory that I will never go back.

Yummy! Did add garlic powder as some reviews suggested. I also read another review that cooked the pasta, then added it to dish to keep it from absorbing all the broth, which I will do next time since I like my broth! Either way this recipe is a keeper!

My husband absolutely loved it.I used one can of chicken broth, added a can of water and 1 packet Lipton golden onion soup mix (sifted out the onions) instead of the 2 cans of broth. I also made my normal meatball mixture with ground beef and ground pork and fried them in olive oil then added them to the soup.

Came out great!!!! I was craving this soup all week so I made it with the ingredients I on hand. I needed to make a few substitutions but would use them again based on how it came out. 1. I added a little garlic to the meat when mixing. 2. I needed to use dried chopped onion in place of the minced onion. I liked it. It helped make the burger and little drier when forming the balls. 3. I used Fideo cut spaghetti in place of shells. Thought it was better. The pasta lasted until the last bowl.

Absolutely delicious, and easy enough for a college student to make! ;) It's a good idea to brown the meatballs in a pan and drain the excess oil/fat before adding to the soup, though.

This is amazing!  I do have to admit that I've never had wedding soup before, but if this is it, then i love it!  I used a whole bag of frozen chopped spinach because we love spinach, and I browned the meatballs just because, but that's all I did differently.  I was surprised that a soup with so little seasoning had so much flavor!  I'm making it again tonight!

Every year the closest weekend to April 1st a group of us hikers get together and rent an AMC hut for the night. I cook for 50 people, both dinner and breakfast, as well as supply soup to day hikers who happen by. This year I made the Italian Wedding soup. I always use whatever recipe is rated the highest then add my own secret ingredients to the recipe. In this case I added equal amounts of hot Italian sausage to the ground beef and when I added the eggs I also added a generous amount of Gray Poupon Country Dijon mustard to the mix. I found that the Gray Poupon gives it a nice kick, though not overpowering. I also add some garlic pepper/power to the meat before I make the small meatballs. Since I am hauling in all this food into the backcountry, I used broth paste and not canned liquid.

Very good and simple. Tip: if you like a saltier soup don't use sodium free chicken broth. Or ensure you add salt. Also good with ground turkey meatballs.

Super recipe! I made it as written except with gluten-free (brown rice) noodles and breadcrumbs as I don't eat wheat. I would recommend adding Italian spice instead of plain basil as well as salt and pepper, as it was a bit bland until I added those. Also I added 2 extra cups of broth because the noodles soaked up a lot of the liquid. I might even add more next time as it is still pretty thick. I may also strain some of the fat too next time, as it was a bit oily from the meat. Overall an excellent and hearty soup I will definitely make again!

This is how I make my wedding soup with one change. I do not add pasta I make cheese croutons. 1 dozen eggs, 2 1/2 cups Parmesan cheese, 1 1/2 cups Italian bread crumbs. Beat eggs and then add cheese and bread crumbs. Add just enough milk so that it looks like a cake batter. Grease a cookie sheet and spread the mixture evenly. Bake 350 degrees for 25-30 minutes until the bottom is slightly brown. Cool and cut into small cubes. Add to soup when you serve it. Yummy!

I tried it and it was delicious. Didn't have seashell pasta on hand so I used no yolk egg noodles. Just as good and 1 cup is the perfect amount because you don't want too much. I also used a store bought Italian blend of like 4 cheeses instead of just Parmesan. Next time I will use homemade or organic chicken stock instead of msg store bought.

I precooked the meatballs and doubled the carrots and used celery and acini or orzo pasta. Also seasoned with bay leaf and salt/ pepper. I also doubled the pasta, I thought it was thick, but everyone else loved it.

This is good stuff! I am so glad I tried this. I was skeptical about this one for a few reasons. 1. I thought the soup would get greasy. 2. It didn't seem like it would have enough seasoning. 3. I thought the pasta would absorb all of the broth. I used venison burger, which is much leaner so perhaps that's why grease wasn't an issue. I did add some fresh garlic to the meatball mixture and more bread crumbs than called for. (It was too wet otherwise.) I kept adding spinach. Almost used a whole bag. You don't even need to slice it because it shrinks so much. I did cook the pasta separately and then added it at the end. Just added a tiny bit of black pepper too.

Loved this!
Always wanted to make it.
I used Bovril chicken stock (100ml) to 10cups of water.
Added 2 minced garlic gloves to the meat mix.
Used fresh Parmesan cheese.
Used DeCecco-Acini di pepe no.78 tiny pasta. (Looks like little tiny round dots)
Very tasty, everyone liked it!

I loved this! I did add some things and make some changes. I added 2 celery stalks and a can of chunk chicken. I cooked the meatballs for 15 mins at 370 in the oven. I also cooked the pasta before hand than added it to the broth. I will be eating this all week for lunch!

I've not had Italian Wedding soup before, but I'm sold on it with this recipe. Very good! It's a soup for meat lovers.

My daughter can't get enough of this soup.  We substituted ground turkey for the beef, but otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter.  It was delightful!

This was just okay. Nobody in my family was really thrilled with it.  I think it was the meatballs.  They changed consistency a little after simmering in the soup for an hour.  Maybe if we ate it right away I could rate it higher.

I made this soup just as the recipe tells, and the only thing I think I'd change would be cooking the meatballs in a separate pan. The soup is wonderfully delicious, but has a nice fat residue film on top the longer it cools. I'll skim it off, but make it differently next time

I would rate this 5 stars but I cooked my meatballs before putting them in the broth. Baked them for 15 minutes at 350 degrees. Was not willing to take a chance on the grease or the color. Added some onion to broth as well. This was very good. I will make this again.

I bake the meatballs first then add to the soup. I also add extra parm to the broth. I find it best to cook the pasta aside then add as i serve as the noodles can get too soft. It has been a hit every time i make it

I thought this soup was okay. I had some similar flavored chicken meatballs to use up. When I did a keyword search, this came up. I definitely recommend making the homemade meatballs. They just flavor the soup well and are softer. However, besides that switch I had to made. It seemed like there was more broth than typical Italian wedding soup, it was saltier than I remember, and when I had made it homemade it also had more vegetables. It definitely needed zucchini. Not sure why, but when I sprinkled on the parmesan on top it clumped to the vegetables. Never had that happen before.

Absolutely EXCELLENT! I cooked the 250 little meatballs in the broth. thought the broth was too "muddy' colored and planned on putting them in "fresh" broth. My dinner guests had to cancel, so being left with 250 little meat balls in muddy broth, I decided to freeze them for another occasion. I put all the meat balls in a container, poured some broth over them, and froze. My dogs loved the remaining broth added to their dry food.  When a dinner party popped up, I unfroze the balls, boiled the 2 1/2 qts of organic chicken broth, then added the remaining ingredients. Honestly less than a half hour later we were enjoying the soup. One of our guests was from a large Italian family with awesome some cooks in it, so I was a little worried my "Italian Wedding Soup", which I never made before, would not measure up. Well, he absolutely loved it! He ate 3 bowls, and asked if he could take any left over soup home. There was only a small bowl so I gave it to him with the recipe. Thank you Lalena, for sharing!

Wonderful soup. Everyone loved it and it was easy to do. Hubby suggested that I bake the meatballs or brown them first. Althought he liked them he felt the didn't look good.  I used 2 tsp of onion powder in place of the minced onion. Was great!

I think that it was very good.  The only thing I changed was adding minced garlic, seasoning salt and montreal steak seasoning to my meatballs. I also substituted beef for turkey meatballs. In addition, I felt like the broth was missing a little bit of extra flavoring.

Terrefic soup.  Only thing I will change next time around is to make the meatballs smaller.  I had a meal in each meatball.  Ex father-in-law used to make this with tiny, tiny meatballs.  Nothing will ever beat his version, but this one is good.

Added lots of garlic powder and pre-browned meatballs.  Sauted onions and carrots before adding broth.  Added zest of 1/2 lemon to broth.

I made this for three very hungry teenage boys.  The entire family loved it and I will be making it again soon.  I made a loaf of the Focaccia Bread found on this site by Terri McCarrell and can say the two recipes are meant for each other. As I always say...follow the recipe to the letter for the first time and then tweak for your liking.  This recipe needs no changes as far as I am concerned.

I tired this recipe but used turkey meat instaed of lean ground beef. i also used organic pasta and less broth. I knew I was going to be freezing the soup, so I bought extra broth and didn't add. When I reheat I will use fresh broth.

I cooked the meatballs separately and onion.  I also added some italian seasoning to the broth and salt.  It needed just a little more.  I also copied what others used and added garlic to the meatballs.  Taste wonderful!!!

Really a wonderful soup.  I doubled the bread crumbs as suggested and added some garlic powder to the meatballs.  I used ditalini pasta because that is what I hand on hand.

Fabulous!! One of my favorite go to recipes, I have also used half ground turkey with the lean ground beef, still outstanding.  I have had rave reviews when I have shared with co workers and family.The only thing I do different is keep the pasta separate so it does not get too mushy if using leftover the next day.

To make it better, I bake my meatballs at 425 degrees place on a pan spray meatballs with oil cook around 8-10 minutes. In a pot saute 1/2 chopped, onion in oil then add your remaining ingredients. I made this with bison meat, which is leaner than beef and will taste the same.

Easy recipe that everyone enjoyed.  I did add cut-up chicken to make it more of a meal at dinner time.  Next time I will add more spinach.  Used ditalini and it worked very well.  Topped soup off with freshly grated parmesan cheese.  Would definitely make this recipe again this winter.

Followed the recipe to a T, except I added much more carrots, about 2 cups.  And I used orzo pasta instead of shells since that's all I had.  And everyone in my family loved it.  We are having leftovers tomorrow and everyone is looking forward to it.  It is now in the cold weather rotation.

Very good, but the measurements were off.  I did brown the meatballs before adding to soup and would suggest sautéing the spinach before adding to soup.

Very yummy. Everyone loved it. Used 32oz veggie stock and 48oz chicken stock. Increased by 3 more cups of chicken bullion. Used whole box of shell noodles. Added 3/4 packet of Italian dressing seasoning packet to the broth.

This is a great recipe.  I do the same just about, but I add a little more herbs.  I do like the small meatballs.. so I can get a bit of veggie on my spoon along with the meat.  You won't be disappointed if you use this recipe.

meatballs weren't as flavorful as i would've liked but overall a great recipe. it looked just like the soup i get at our italian restaurant near us. meatballs were labor intensive but i used another reviewers tip to roll meat into a rope and cut small pieces off. my daughter helped too. flavor was good. we used acini de pepe bc thats just how I've always had it. just don't ad too much pepe like i did. it was great the first day but we stored left overs in the fridge and by morning the pepe puffed up and really took over the soup. there wasn't enough liquid in it to call it soup anymore lol! it was sadly pepe surprise lol!

We really enjoyed this recipe. My only change was to use a combination of ground beef and spicy bulk sausage for the meatballs and to brown them a bit before putting in the broth.

Absolutely perfetto! After reading some reviews I substituted sweet Italian sausage for the extra lean ground beef, added spinach a few minutes before serving and used bow tie noodles instead of seashell pasta. Those three changes were my only recipe alterations, all else was followed. The sweet Italian sausage gave the chicken broth a wonderful flavor. Has become a family favorite.

I have made this delicious recipe many many times. It was wonderful as it is but I liked lots of spinach and used orzo pasta. I also cooked up the meat balls before adding to soup as to get rid of any fat content.  Absolutely wonderful> I make this so much as when I make it for the family I always freeze about 4 containers for my 85 year old mother who really enjoys it and looks forward to eating it.  Thanks so much for sharing this great soup Barb

This was a delicious recipe!  I had to cheat and use premade meatballs that I just cut into fourths and added at the end, but I'm sure it's just as great with the homemade meatballs.

I added 1 lg garlic clove minced to meatballs and substituted 1/2 c dry milk powder for eggs in meatballs. I also baked meatballs for about 30 min @  375 and added them at the end. I used sm cookie scoop to make meatballs. I also added about 1 tsp of dried basil to broth. We loved this soup. I have made twice in a week!

We LOVED this!  Delicious! I pre-baked the meatballs for 12 minutes before adding them to the soup. I used a large can of sliced carrots and also used both penne and the shells.  SO good with Garlic Ciabatta bread.  My husband and I enjoyed every bite!  Will make again and again!

Awesome recipe!! The meatball are heavenly. I made a few modifications for my own personal taste. I added about 1 tablespoon of ground pepper to the broth along with a pinch of oregono leaves. 5 star with the modifications!

I've made this recipe many times and it's become my favourite soup, hands down.  I always use orzo pasta and fresh spinach, and of course salt and pepper (both in the meatballs and broth). Thanks for sharing!!

When I make a recipe that I get online I like to read the reviews.  I read the reviews on this one and made some changes.  The meatballs I also added minced garlic,salt,and pepper. I also baked the meatballs for 15 minutes at 350.  The soup I sautéed the carrots, celery, garlic in olive oil and a little salt.  Then I added the chicken broth, plus 2 cups beef broth. Then I added the baked meatballs, fresh spinach, 1/2 to 3/4 cup Orzo pasta.  I made this for the hunters when they came in from a wet chilly day and they ate it all up.  My son even wanted some to take back to college.

This soup was good. I used low sodium chicken broth but then at the end had to add salt because of the lack of salt. So, use regular chicken broth, don't try low sodium. I used frozen spinach and Trader Joe's frozen Italian style meatballs. It was excellent with the quick ingredients. I followed one reviewers advice and sauteed the spinach and carrots in some garlic first (I also used some pepper and dried basil in the saute).

Very good. My husband and I ate it and liked it. My little ones did not, but that's not a big shocker.

This turned out really good.  Followed the recipe pretty closely other than adding a tad of garlic powder to the meatballs and a little oregano for our tastes.  I also browned the meatballs before adding to the soup since I did not have lean meat and wanted to get some of the fat off them.  The whole family ate it and liked it.  Update:  I make this regularly now and I just drop the meatballs in the soup as written usually before the noodles a bit and put the spinach in just to wilt at the end.

After tasting this soup I thought it was lacking in a tomato taste. I placed a small portion of diced tomato at the bottom of each dish before serving. It had exactly the desired effect. Yummm!

This was pretty good. I have a favorite Rachael Ray recipe that is similar to this, but this came close. Rolling the meatballs was a little time consuming, and I would probably use ground turkey if I make this again. I did add a little lemon juice to the broth as well. Made a huge batch.

Really yummy and healthy.....my only change was to use 1lb of extra lean ground chicken breast instead of beef....the lil chicken meatballs were so tasty. Dropped them into the soup to cook and they were perfect. Will make again.....Thanks!

Excellent! This is a keeper! My husband who is 1/2 sicilian loved it and said it reminded him of his mother's and aunts! I did add garlic, salt, pepper, extra basil and a tad bit oregano and used high quality chicken stock vs. reg broth. Also, next time will take another's advice and add cooked pasta at the end to avoid it from soaking up most of the broth. Thx for sharing!

Very good!  Quick and easy to make!  I did make some minor changes - minced garlic instead of onion, rotini instead of sea shells and shredded carrots instead of diced.  I also used frozen spinach.  Will definitely make again.

When I saw this recipe I wanted to make it right away, but did not have the ground beef.  I decided to make it and replaced the meatballs with boneless chicken (cut into small pieces).  I used fresh spinach and fresh basil leaves and added a fresh minced garlic clove.  The end result was great.  It was very easy and yummy.  Can't wait to make it with meatballs next time.  This recipe is definitely a KEEPER.

This is one of the best soups I've ever made!  The only thing I changed was that I used ground turkey instead of beef.  Also, didn't have basil so used oregano instead.  Turned out perfectly!  Thank you so much for the recipe!  :)

Nice simple healthy soup recipe.  For my meatballs, I used ground chicken instead , added a little garlic and used only one egg.  My small cookie scoop made them a very quick process to prepare.  For the soup, I added garlic and used fresh spinach.  I made orzo on the side, and then added to each bowl along with some soup.  My husband really enjoyed it as well.  I will definitely add it to my rotation of soup recipes.

super delish!!! I added one lemon to the chicken broth, as well as some salt and garlic powder. To the meat balls I added about 1 1/2 cloves of minced garlic and some extra italian bread crumbs. Next time will try adding zucchini to the vegetable mix, or maybe some rice to the meatballs, the variations are endless. But all in all a wonderful meal, my husband really enjoyed it ( huge soup fan) and even my 2 yr old, whom we have to sneak veggies in for, if they cleaned their bowls then I know its a keeper!!

This is good, simple recipe.  I made a few modifications - my sister won't eat red meat so I substituted ground chicken.  I also added more breadcrumbs to the meatballs because I found they were a bit sticky with the amount the recipe called for.  Next time, I may use oregano instead of basil and add a pinch of garlic powder to the meatballs.

Very good flavor that our whole family enjoyed.  Our children don't like as much broth so we added more carrots and pasta than origionally called for.  A bit of fresh ground pepper also adds great taste.

I forgot cheese in balls..Used pastina+ extra 1/2 C. Man this was so AWSOME..5 stars are NOT enough..This will be a staple in my freezer from now on I tell you!! The switch of shells to pastina is what makes this. My Neices Goddaughter who 'plays' at eating, got SERIOUS here..had 2&1/2 bowls and she is 21 months old. Thank you so much. I now have a new weapon in my arsenal..now to do this vegitarian for the above niece...

Wonderful recipe. I doubled the meatball ingredients and froze half for next time I make this soup.I had a roasted chicken left over from a previous meal so I steamed it and removed the meat and used the broth for part of the soup base.  I used shells for the pasta. Yummy!

So good and easy to make. I threw in a couple of zucchini, and used orzo pasta, which I cooked separately. I also added garlic and red pepper flakes to the meatballs. Delicious on a cool fall day.

Nice hearty soup. I added lots of minced garlic and some red pepper flakes to the meatballs after reading reviews.  Broth just seemed to be lacking a little something.  Will try again with some tweaking.

This was great.  The first time I made it my husband found the meatballs bland so I used seasoned breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese to the meatballs and it added a lot of flavor.  I also used homemade chicken broth which added a lot of flavor. I will make this soup the same week I cook a whole chicken so I can make the stock.

When I made this, I was hoping that it amazing because this is my favorite kind of soup and I didn't want to be disappointed... and I wasn't! Simply the best recipe I've found on this website so far. I thought about frying the meatballs before hand, but am so glad that I followed the recipe. It would've been WAY too greasy if I did that. Love, love, love!

This soup is so good!  Yes the meatballs are a little labor intensive but if you make them all first before you do anything else you just need to drop them in and let them go.  I did add extra breadcrumbs and Parmesan to the meatballs as well as using Italian flavored breadcrumbs instead of plain.  Poaching the meatballs in the broth with out any previous browning or baking gave the broth all kinds of flavor.  This is going into regular rotation.  THANKS!

This was an awesome recipe!  I followed it the best I could, but I didn't have enough stock.  I didn't know the quarts to 0z conversion when I was in the store, so I added 1 cup of water to it and then added onions and garlic to the stock while it was boiling.  Followed the recipe, got mini shells and boiled it in the stock also.  Everything came out excellent.  The boyfriend made the meatballs and thankfully, the meatballs brought the flavor to the soup.  I was amazed.

Perfect for a cold winter day.  I used more parm and bread crumbs in my meatballs along with some garlic powder and a bit of oregano (it's not italian without it IMO).  I used mostly homemade turkey stock (great way to get flavor out of the leftover thanksgiving bird) and I added about 2 cups of water since it just didn't seem to have enough liquid.  I also added some leeks since I had them in the fridge.  Very tasty and you could add/subtract what was on hand to make it.

This soup was incredible.  My family loved, loved, loved it!  I made it almost exactly like the original recipie.  Only thing I did different was I minced up garlic and put in in the boiling broth,  and I used trader joes cous cous (they are not the usual cous cous, more like pasta)  All I can say is that I will make this again and again. Thanks so much :)

Great recipe
I found that using a tsp measuring spoon helped speed up meatball making.  Browning the meatballs also helps speed up the process - direct heat helps the egg hold the meatball together!

This recipe was excellent and very close to what my mother-in-law makes. The only variation I made was I had some chicken in my freezer. I cooked it, with the chicken broth because I had to use part water so it added some natural flavor to the broth. Then I shredded the chicken and added it to the soup. My husband raved that it was great!

My family loved this soup ! I added a can of Garlic seasoned chicken broth and it added a good flavor(husband bought the wrong chicken broth but it turned out to be in his favor because it really added to the flavor)Didnt think making the meatballs was to hard used small cookie scoop.This recipe is worth passing on !

Wow...this was good. While cooking, my 11 yr. old thought this would be disgusting because of all the spinach. Much to her  surprise, she liked it. I, too, like one of the other raters thought the meatballs would look weird upon boiling; however, they looked fine. This was fast!!! I used a 1 tsp cookie scoop for the meatballs and it took no time. Hearty, warm on a cold day and very satisfying. I will definitely make this soup again!

So easy to make and very tasty with simple ingredients. I omitted the onion and used macaroni pasta because that is what I had on hand. I cooked it separately because I didn't want it to soak up the broth and added at the end. Sprinkled parmesan cheese right before eating and it's sooooo yummy!

Excellent soup. I made a few changes---fresh garlic in the stock while it was boiling, added 1/2 cup of noodles and I made the meatballs very small and flashed browned the meatballs. 

Terrific recipe--in my recipe box it goes.

Very good recipe! The meatballs need a little more seasoning. They were somewhat bland and also very time consuming to make. Overall the soup tastes great on a nice cold day!

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe. I did notice however that the meatballs were lacking something, maybe a bit of salt? Could have just been the parmasean I was using. I also added some parsley and a bit of dried basil to the soup. Thanks for the recipe!

Good recipe, but I agree with the reviews. Next time, I'll add garlic salt to the meatballs and consider baking them ahead of time to drain off the grease. Otherwise, very solid dish

This turned out GREAT. I made this last night for a church ethnic potluck and it was a hit. I put mozzarella in the meatballs instead of parmesan ( I was all out) I also used itallian bread crumbs so I didnt add any of the herbs. I also doubled the spinach ( We love spinach) and didnt add the carrots but onion instead. All in All it was great. Actually handed out a copy of the recipe last night. Good belly filler.

I made this last night.  I added some garlic to it.  I used half beef half turkey burger and baked the meatballs for a bit as several people suggested and used orzo pasta.  It was wonderful.  I will definately make it again.

I used used my regular meatball recipe (with matzo meal and onion powder) and omitted the basil as my husband isn't a big fan.  I browned the meatballs first in a pan so there'd be less fat in the soup.  I also cooked the pasta separately and added it to the soup plates when serving so it wouldn't get mushy, especially when reheating. This was tasty but pretty labor intensive to make so many tiny meatballs.

At the suggestion of others I added garlic to the meatballs.  Next time I may add a bit of tomato sauce because they were lacking a little bit.  I also sauteed the carrots in chicken broth, along with added celery and onion before combining with rest of ingredients.  Overall a pretty good soup.  Could use a touch more flavor.

My husband was eating a canned version of this soup. He kept raving about it. So, I thought that I could probably make it home made. Found this recipe and made it. I also made my home made dinner rolls with it and it was a hit!!!!! I've made it 3 times in the past 2 weeks! Even made it for my mom who hurt her back and couldn't cook. She loved it! Thanks for submitting this recipe!!!!

This recipe is excellent on so many levels.  The ingredients are simple.  The directions are easy to follow.  The soup is restaurant quality or better.

This is a GREAT soup! I used more chicken broth. Depending on the pasta you use, the pasta may soak up a lot of the broth, so it's good to have some on-hand for leftovers.  I might try half gr. beef and half gr. pork for the meatballs, next time.  I did fry the meatballs.  I believe and the pork makes for more flavorable meatballs

This made a nice, hearty soup.  The quality of the chicken broth is important in this recipe, so choose carefully.  I baked the meatballs first and then drained them on paper towels to reduce the fat.  The next time I make this, I'll add more chopped carrot, substitute onion powder or dried onion for the fresh onion, and add garlic powder to the meatballs.

Fabulous recipe!
Made a change though, sauteed meatballs and carrots, first in small amt olive oil.
Everyone just loved this soup. I am planing on making it for the holidays!

I thought it was very good.  Everyone did eat it.  My husband thought that meatballs didn't meld well with the chicken broth.  If I used chicken instead of meatballs or beef broth instead of chicken broth, he would of liked it better.  He still ate two bowls.

Great Recipe. The only time consuming part of this soup is making the meatballs. This is a family favorite
