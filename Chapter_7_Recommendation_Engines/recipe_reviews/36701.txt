I run through this with the braun drink mixer to make it more like a puree. But we love the taste and, it's almost free if you're on weight watchers.

Made with Mr. Stripey tomatoes, with an extra dash of Worcestershire sauce, some cilantro and a splash of tabasco - served to rave reviews. Great, fresh flavor!

Excellent spicier version of gazpacho, and the cucumber and cumin chips complimented it well.  As is, the recipe has a chunkier texture, similar to salsa.  A quick swipe with a stick blender would make this smoother and more traditional (which I plan on trying next time).

To make preparation easier, I used a large can of diced tomatoes in juice.  After I removed the tomatoes, the remaining juice was the same amount called for in the recipe.

I think the problem was that I used a Bloody mix with horsradish, bubt the flavors just clashed. Maybe I'll try next summer when I get this craving again, or maybe I'll just go out for it.

SO good!  I like things spicy, so I used spicy bloody mary mix.  It was too spicy for some people, who compared it to salsa.  Everyone used chips to eat it!  Really great for summer.

Soooo easy!  Why didn't I think of something so good and so easy.  You can always add some celery, cilantro, fresh tomato... but you don't need to do anything.  It's excellent!
