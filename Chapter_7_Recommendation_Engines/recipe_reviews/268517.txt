Dangerous, bowl-licking deliciousness!

I also am no lavender fan so  I have successfully subbed this recipe with any one of the following:
shaved lemongrass,
 grated ginger, 
or  sprinkles of thyme.....

loved them all!

A little bit of work to get things timed out with the other dishes (not my strong suit), but it was really good.  Wife liked it, but she also liked that she didn't have to cook.
