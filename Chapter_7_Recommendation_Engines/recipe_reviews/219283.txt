Extremely good; loved the gingersnap crust as a change from the familiar graham.  Definitely requires at least this size pan or larger: we had a lot of filling and too much crust with a 9" pan.  Either that or the author meant to say 2 packages of cream cheese instead of 2 pounds!  It was very tasty though and we will be tweaking this and making again!  Everyone who tasted it raved!
