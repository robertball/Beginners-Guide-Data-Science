This is how we prepare our abalone, and it always comes out great.  If we don't have bread crumbs (or want a different texture) we use Krusteaz Bake & Fry Coating Mix.  We pound our 1/2 inch to 1/4 inch slices with the flat side of the mallet first to even it out, then with the tenderizing side.  Don't pound it into paste, but pound it enough to knock all the toughness out of it.  When it looks it's just about ready to fall apart, it is perfect.  I can't stand it when it is tough, and I think this is why people don't like it.

Pretty delicious, as abalone always is, if cooked right. Try cutting the ab very thin, and add dill and shredded parmesan cheese to the bread crumb mix-Keeblers crackers are a nice touch too. Don't cook it any longer than 10 seconds a side, or it'll be chewy.

This was pretty good - the cocktail sauce, too. I did add some salt and pepper to the bread crumbs. This recipe does not say which way to slice the abalone and that makes a big difference. Strangely enough, I get the best results by slicing with the grain instead of across it - go figure.

I grew up here in San Diego in Little Italy. I dove for Abalone alot when I was younger when you could still harvest it here in southern California. All the old Italians slice it 1/4 inch thick beat it to with a tenderizing  hammer untill it almost falls apart. Coat with breadcrumbs and fry it in hot oil for 30 seconds  on each side .I put no seasoning on  it. I find you an hide the taste of Abalone if you season to much

No changes , will make it again.  I might use a little less coarse bread crumbs . That might enhance the Abalone even more

My first time cooking abalone and they turned out really nice. Kids ate it too. Didn't make the sauce.
