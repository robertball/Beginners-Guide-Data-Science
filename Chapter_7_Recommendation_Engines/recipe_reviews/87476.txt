Wonderful!  However I did not have time to make the salsa, so I just used a jar of Renfro's mango habanero salsa with the addition of some pineapple juice to replace the handmade fruit salsa... BAM! It was done in no time!

My family and I loved these pork chops. I will definitely be making this again. I did cheat and use Newman's Mango Salsa instead of cutting up mango, and added it to the vinegar, soy and sugar. It was terrific.

I live in a fairly small town so my local grocery store is not what you would call "well-stocked" so the cardomum seeds and the rice wine vinegar were items I had to track down. Also, the mortar and pestle is something you pick up at a garage sale as decoration and not something used in the kitchen. I followed the instructions and used a mini chopper instead of the mortar and pestle. I also doubled the marinade recipe and used have as a marinade and the other half for basting. I am not big on heating used marinade for basting (I guess it's a bug thing I have). The tenderness of the chops depends on your grilling ability. The chops went well with the spicy salsa. Served with steamed rice and was a big hit. Great recipe all around and will do again. Thanks!

Excellent.  I put rosemary on the Pork before marinating and substituted coriander for cardamom seeds.  I also baked the pork at 350 for about 50 minutes instead of grilling.  I put salsa with it in the pan and sealed it with aluminum foil.  It probably tasted differently than grilling but came out very tender.  It definitely had some kick, I'm going to enjoy eating the leftovers.

We LOVE this! It is a regular feature during grilling season at our house! As others have mentioned, we used a jar of Newman's Own Mango Salsa, and then added the vinagar and soy to that for the marinade. I also double batch the marinade and mix with a little sugar, as my husband likes to put some over rice with this dish. Wonderful; my kids even love it!

Followed the recipe exactly, except I omitted the jalapenos.  THIS WAS OUTRAGEOUS!  I couldn't stop tasting the simmered ingredients!  The key to any pork chop is not to overcook it and to only turn it once on the grill (never close the lid while cooking meet and it's stays moist).  Will be adding this to my rotation of dinners.  I'm going to try this marinade with grilled salmon and shrimp next...OH YUM...a MUST DO recipe!

OUTSTANDING flavor! I've used chicken also with great success. I used coriander for the cardamom seeds and had to resort to frozen chunked mango but all was still great. I love this recipe!!

Wow, these were delicious!  When I read the recipe, I wasn't sure how it would taste, given the amalgamation of ingredients (e.g. white pepper has a very pungent flavor and so I always want to use it very sparingly) but when I cooked the chutney ingredients together as written, I realized that the flavor combination is excellent.  Instead of grilling, I just covered the chops in the sauce and baked in the oven for an hour at 350 degrees.  Served over rice.  It tasted great.  Thanks for the recipe - I will be making this again.

Made this perfectly in one shot, I made sure to use real thick pork chops also. Do not understand the other reviews where people subbed a canned salsa, why don't you just go to McDonalds and get a Mcrib while your at it.

These are really, really good!  Especially when you're looking for something a bit different to spice up the menu.  On weeknights when we want something quick, we do the marinade without the sauce - that really speeds it up because you can cook the sauce and chops at the same time and don't have to refrigerate/reheat the sauce.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I have made this twice and it was a hit.  It made the pork chops so flavorful!!  It is time consuming, but worth the effort.  We used leftovers on chicken and it was just as good.  I didn't have a mango on hand and used fresh peaches instead.  I also didn't have cardamom seeds - just omitted it.  Highly recommended if you like flavorful food!

Don't get mad that I didn't follow to a "T."  I'm rating the mango sauce a 5 - I didn't try the rest of the recipe. I only used the mango sauce to make pork fajitas.  Grilled some pork loin chops with salt/pepper/olive oil only, let them rest, slice julienne and then simmer for 15 min or so in the mango sauce.   Stir fried some red/green pepper with onion and garli and then added to the pork mixture.  Served on tortillas with rice and corn.

These take a while to make, so I would suggest making a double or triple recipe of the marinade for future use. Well worth the time, though. Delicious!

This was one excellent meal !!! If you want a change up for your pallet from the typical pork chop....this is it!! nice blend of flavors with a tad bit of a bite to it (not too much though the kids still liked it!!!). Cooked it for my family and parents whom happened to be in town and all loved it.

With 5 star reviews, I had high expectations... and they were exceeded!  Delicous.  We're unpacking from a move, the grill isn't accessible so I fried the chops (with the marinade) in a covered skillet, medium heat, for 7-8 mins per side.  This reduced the marinade to a concentrated mouth watering mixture of distinct tropical flavors.  Compared to the refrigerated salsa, the cooked/reduced version was far tastier. So next time all the salsa is going into the skillet with the chops along with the marinade. We have half an "organic" pig (ever seen an "inorganic" pig?) still in our freezer with a dozen pork chops packages that are all a bit tough. The marinade even softened them up enough so our jaws didn't hurt from the chewing. With babysitting the salsa, 15 mins prep time was more like 45 for me.  Maybe we'll make a "pot load of salsa next time.  Highly recommend!

I used this recipe with salmon instead of pork and it was awesome! The salsa was delicious, but I would cut those ingredients in half as there was a lot left over.

This was FANTASTIC!  My kids loved the way it smelled cooking it and they loved the way it tasted when finished!  We will certainly have this again.  I made two changes - coconut oil for veggie oil and brown sugar for sugar.

We loved it. I used 2 pork tenderloins from Costco rather than pork chops. Chops tend to get tough on the grill whereas the tenderloins, if cooked properly stay moist. 30 minutes on the grill at 350 is my method and they always turn out perfect. I turn them only once after 15 minutes. Let them rest 5 minutes before cutting. The only ingredient I left out of this recipe was the cardamom seeds. I did a side order of Yukon golds and some sliced pineapple. It was a great dinner and our guest loved it too. I'm adding this one to our every growing list of easy, tasty recipes.

very nice. I didn't have cardomom pods on hand and used ground cardomom which I do have....had to guess at the amount and used 1/4 tsp. I didn';t want spicy ot overpower the delicate cardomom and mango flavor so I only used 1/8 tsp of red pepper....but that is personal taste. You can add more or less to suit your own heat taste.  This makes a lot of leftovers...either cut the sauce in half or use it on something else later. As another posted noted....it is good on chicken to use the leftovers! For those that like the spice on the milder side I have also made without the jalepeno and that was excellent too.

These were delicious!!  I used a pork butt steak instead of the chops and marinated it overnight, turning every 8 hours or so.  I also omitted the cayenne from the salsa and didn't have cardamom, but honestly we thought the salsa was delicious without it!  I baked the steak in the marinade at 350, turning it once every 20 minutes for about 50-60 minutes, just until it was done (covered for the first 40, then uncovered for the remaining time).  We will definitely have this again!

These are really great for outdoor grilling, as well. We loved them.   I add half the sugar to the sauce, because I find it too sweet. I also add half a cup of chopped red onion. Preferring fresh cilantro, I wait until the sauce has cooled to add it.

The pork chops came out yummy and would make them again.  However, I would reduce the amount of apple sauce - I used 3 of the single serve, 4 oz. type  and would use only one next time.  There is too much chutney/relish left.  I also used canned mango and would NOT recommend this.  When I went to buy the mango, the store only had unripe mangoes so I got the canned variety.  The canned stuff does not taste like mangoes!

The basic structure of this recipe is so perfect it didn't matter that I had to make some changes(I didn't have mangos, rice wine vinegar, or jalapeno and I only had 3/4cup of applesauce) So here we go: for the "marinade" I used 2/3cup plain medium salsa, soy sauce, & a scant 1/3cup plain white vinegar with a little seasoned sushi rice vinegar to make it 1/3cup (this type of vinegar is highly seasoned w/sugar & salt so you'll see why I made other adjustments below).  For the "salsa" sauce I used 1clove garlic, 1tsp chili powder, & only 1/8tsp red pepper, then added 1/8cup white vinegar & 1/8cup of the sushi vinegar, omitted the salt & used 2 TSP splenda blend (which is equiv of 1/4 cup sugar).  In a food processor I blended one can of drained peaches (the no sugar added kind), 3/4cup applesauce, 2tsp fresh lemon juice, & prob 1/4cup fresh cilantro leaves(I LOVE cilantro).  Added the peaches mixture to the spices/vinegar as directed & let this simmer for about 20 min(ended up using 1tsp of corn startch to thicken it b/c it looked watery), lastly added 1cup of drained coarsely chopped pineapple chunks and generous pinch of white pepper. I baked 4 pork chops in the "marinade" (covered 350/375 for approx 45 min) set them aside to stay warm & boiled the marinade until it was super thick. To serve, dip the chop in the thick glaze, place on a bed of brown/wild rice, spoon over the "salsa" & garnish with chopped cilantro, lemon zest, & some sauteed red bell pepper. YUM! Thanks Eve11

Scaled it down to four pork chops and we absolutely loved i! Made the recipe exactly as it says. The dish had heat, but wasn't crazy spicy.

The sauce for this recipe is excellent, but the pork chops were not all that.  They were not tender at all, no matter how long I marinated them.  The sauce was so good that I was eating it with fish, chicken, chicken nuggets, and whatever kind of meat I could find in the refrigerator.  I seriously thought about just getting a spoon and eating it without anything.  I did omit the cardamom seeds because I did not know where to begin to look for it in the grocery store and I was not 100% sure on the pronunciation to ask for help.  Again the sauce is GOOD!!!

Fantastic.  I put a couple more garlic cloves in the salsa and substituted 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg & cinnamon for the cardamom pod.  Other than that, everything was the same.  Really, really great salsa and overall recipe.

Prep time was longer than 15 minutes.  Tasty pork chops, but disliked "texture" of applesauce in this.  Reminded me of baby food more so than salsa or relish.

There were the best pork chops.  I made this recipe so much easier by using Mango Papaya Salsa from trader joes.  Other than that I followed exactly. Had a salad with balsomic dressing and fresh tomatoes from the garden and yellow rice.

Yummy! The sauce ended up being the perfect blend of sweet and spicy, which goes really well with pork chops. I didn't have the cardamom or cilantro on hand, so I just used some coriander. Next time I will make sure to get all of the ingredients.

Pork tasted fabulous with the marinade.  I would not recommend the utilizing the marinade after it has been over the meat.  Just use the remaining 1/3 of the salsa for additional flavor to meat.

This was really awesome!  The salsa is fabulous.  I made these pork chops for our dinner club and everyone loved them.  I didn't have good luck heating up the leftovers, though.  I warmed them covered at 350, but they were a bit tough compared to how they tasted the first night.

These were pretty good-I accidentally added two tablespoons of lemon juice to the salsa, instead of two teaspoons and I only had cinnamon flavored applesauce, but it worked just fine and complimented the other flavors nicely.

These are fantastic! Best pork chops we've ever had.   Didn't know where to get cardamom pods, and don't like cilantro....so omitted those. Didn't miss them.

the salsa was great and surprised me, i usually dont care for fruit on protein but even my 5 y/o liked the salsa, he thought he was getting to eat dessert with dinner.  My husband gave some great advice for sides for this as i struggled to figure out what would pair with this, sweet potato fries, or a baked sweet potato, with a little butter.  The salsa could get on the potatoes and you probably wouldnt mind.

This recipe was great!! Followed to a T for an impromptu dinner party and it turned out wonderful.  Words from my guests "perfect blend of sweet & savory, the perfect marriage of the succulent pork chop & sweet juicy pineapple/mango salsa was a delight for the senses."  Yes, they do reviews for restaurants. Will definitely make over and over again!

Fantastic!!  We tend not to eat pork chops much since they are usually so bland.  When we do have them, I always serve applesauce with it so when I saw the recipe, I couldn't resist.  I did not change a thing on this and it was great.  The spiciness melds so good with the sweetness of the pineapples and mango.  In fact, that was the first time I ever tried fresh mango!  Grilled some thick chops perfectly (for a change) and had a generous topping of the salsa.  Couldn't get enough of it!

There is some very time consuming parts to this recipe. I ran out of time (because I didn't read in detail ahead of time that you have to simmer the marinade for a total of 30 minutes before it is ready) so I skipped the marinade process. I also didn't have any applesauce on hand so I pureed an apple and it worked great. I simmered the pork in a broth/white wine mix while my sauce was simmering. It left me with a very tender flavorful chop! This has EXCELLENT taste! I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out with all of the seasonings mixed with the fruit, but it is AWESOME! Give it a try!!!!

This was the exact flavour that I was looking for when I choose to make this recipe. It is a bit of work to make the salsa, but worth it in my opinion. You could always make the salsa the day before though.

This delicious dish was the first dish my boyfriend and I made together. We used all the ingredients except for the pineapple (could not find pineapple rings in the store + too cheap to buy a whole pineapple :D )and I must say - IT IS AMAAAAAAAAZING! We used hot chilli powder because we were unsure what heat to use - and woaw what a salsa! We'll be boasting about that salsa for years to come! The only change I would make in the future would be to experiment with different pork meats and marinade for longer. It is a really easy dish to make and I highly recommend it - especially the salsa chutney - you don't know what your missing! Delicious even when using the cheapest ingredients out there!

I had to make a few changes to the recipe, I couldn't locate Rice Wine Vinegar, so I substituted Cider Vinegar.  I didn't have a Mango, but I had frozen peaches.  The salsa was sweet, and had quite the bite.  I am not a fan of spicy food, but this was different!!  My 15 year old son actually ate a second helping for like the first time EVER!!  It was really good!  Highly recommend this recipe.

This was marvelous.  The mango chutney was fabulous and the pork chops were tasty and moist.  We had leftover chutney and I used it two nights later on grilled chicken breasts.  Really, really good.

wonderful!  worth the effort....i did not have cardamon on hand but used a tsp of allspice instead...also, we did not boil the marinade after the meat had marinated in it i just had my husband baste it a few times while he was grilling it and it worked out well

This was fine, but it didn't knock our socks off.  The salsa was more work than I had planned on. Like I said, the pork chops were yummy, but I probably won't go to the trouble again for a fairly modest return.

I left out the jalapeños because I have young kids - regretted it afterward. There was no “heat” to the sauce, just tasted like chili powder with applesauce.

Soooo good! Going to be one of our new family favorites! Put over rice.. Wish had more sauce- so good! I didn't add cardamom seeds because didn't have and would prob never use again if I bought. Never picked out a mango so used a small container of fresh mango salsa which had cilantro in it so didn't add extra. Also skipped unsweetened applesauce.  I'm sure delish with everything the recipe called for... But loved recipe with what I switched up too. Sweet, with a kick- gotta try!!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I make the salsa as stated and always double it for my family as they love it. When I do not have time to marinate the pork chops I use a mango haberno glaze when on the grill and have awesome results. The mango salsa smells divine as it is cooking and I have also used it on chicken. This one is a keeper for my house.

This recipe had a great taste probably would have been better on the grill. The best part was the salsa. I would recommend letting it marinate for more than an hour. Im giving it 4 stars because making the salsa is a lot of work. more than 15 minutes for prep time!

Very good! I don't really eat pork but my hubby loves it, so if I cook it, I want to make sure I really make it count. This was so good, I even enjoyed it! I tried to follow the recipe to a tee but I'm not even going to pretend what a "cardamom pod" is. I did search my local grocery but I didn't even know where to look, produce?, spices?... I did find a tiny bottle of ground cardamom for $12.99!!! Yeah, I substituted. I used a sprinkle of ginger and a few sprinkles of nutmeg as suggested on a Google search. I also don't know if there's much of a difference with unsweetened applesauce and no sugar added but the only kind I had was no sugar added which was still worked fine. I do think the amount of sauce is a bit excessive though, I had a lot left over which I froze for next time.

One of the best recipes I've ever made! I used hot pepper flakes (about 1 tsp.) instead of cayenne pepper, and seeds from about 4 pods of cardamom. I can't get applesauce where I live, so made my own with gala apples the day before. Well worth the work! Served with spicy black beans and fresh pineapple.

This would have been 5 stars except for the fact that I had to make a change to the recipe. I cut the sugar in half, but it was still too sweet. With all the fruit, even though I used unsweetened pineapple and applesauce, there is no need to add more sugar. I tasted it partway through and stopped after adding half the amount called for. Next time I will omit the sugar, and then it will be 5 stars!

This was fantastic just as written! And as far as a reviewer that said they did not recommend using the marinade after is had been over meat..well it is fine to use. The recipe here tells you to boil it first. I don't think it would have been as flavorful without that step.

The sauce was great! I could not find cardamom seeds so I used coriander about a teaspoon, could not find rice wine vinegar so I used apple juice! Did not use the jalapeno! The pork chops even after marinadeing them was extrememly tough! I will try chicken, next time and there will be a next time! The sauce was great! I will try with thicker pork chops, I think that was my problem, mine was too thin, possibley simply bake them in oven, like others said they chose to do.

Delicious! I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, but the sauce still turned out great without the cayenne pepper, cardamom seeds, or cilantro. I used canned diced jalapenos and probably more than what the recipe called for. Also, I used it on baked salmon, but will be trying it on the pork chops tonight!

I gave these 4 stars, they were fantastic. I didn’t use the cardamom, the store I went to was out, so I left it out. After dinner I was looking at the recipe and notice I forgot to add the pineapple and the applesauce. Not sure how I forgot it but maybe if I had used it, then this would have been 5 stars.

This was very good. I followed this recipe almost exactly (I left out the jalapeno). I used an outdoor charcoal grill. I admit, it was a lot of work, but I thought it was fun. I made it with saffron rice and broccoli. I'd make it again, considering its low caloric value.

This is a great recipe!  The salsa is a little bit of work, but well worth it.  I substitued coriander seeds for cardamom because I didn't have any.  I made the salsa the day before and marinated the pork for about 24 hours and it turned out tender and juicy.

Very tasty!  Does not take a great amount to put together depending on how small you want to chop the mango.  The chops were very moist which was a bonus.  My wife loved the leftovers!

The Salsa had a LOT of ingredients, so I cheated, like others and went with the Newman's Own Mango salsa. We used pork tenderloin...It was very tasty and got very positive comments. 
What would I do differently? I might add - on the side - some fresh jalapenos for additional "crunch" and heat. Overall, very tasty!

I'm not a huge pork chop fan, but my husband is, so I was looking for a way to make them that wouldn't be boring. This recipe made me into a fan. It's delicious. The chutney itself is good, but when paired with the pork, it really just comes together. This really dresses up pork like nothing else I've tried.  We had enough chutney left to have with another type of meat.  I think this would go well with salmon or chicken just as well. Will definitely make again.

Prepared this dish yesterday. Made the salsa & marinade and put the marinade on 4 chops bone in and 2 boneless chops.
Placed in fridge for 1 hour.

I grilled these on my Big Green Egg. Pulled when internal temps hit 160 and then wrapped in foil for 10 minutes  before we ate them. Everyone loved the flavor, yeah, no leftovers.... The salsa had just the right amount of bite, not too hot. The bone in chops were  better than the boneless, more flavorful and more moist. 

I will do these again next Saturday using only bone in chops. I will also brine the chops before I marinate them. I want to make sure they are moist when finished cooking.

There is a BBQ restaurant in the area and the founder/chef has a pork  chops on his menu. They are the best and most moist I have ever eaten. Over drinks at his bar after dinner one night he shared that he  brines his chops for 24 hours to help flavorize them and keep them moist. 

I need to perfect this recipe for the 2018 Eggtoberfest in Atlanta where we will be cooking and serving them. 
I will post my results here, stay tuned.......

I made this as per the original recipe.  It was very much worth the effort.  Use fresh ingredients and start early as the prep does take about an hour.  I like spicy foods so next time I might add something hotter than chili pepper.  As a side dish we used white rice and garden fresh green beans.

This was a fabulous  recipe . I used ginger in place of the cardamom. I also used the salsa on grilled chicken. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! A day or two after making it I had workers in my yard and the were all commenting about the yummy smells still emanating from the grill. Cardamom is a key flavor but I bought mine ground.  Like other reviewers I didn't  follow the recipe exactly - used prepared mango chutney instead of simmering the fruit but kept other seasonings the same.  One of my favorite grill recipes of all time.

It had a great taste and great feed back. Will be making this again. Didn't have all the mangoes at first so I made two different batches. Heated them both up. Cooled on for the marinade and heated the other till thick for an after finish.

A bit of effort, and I had my doubts about it because I didn't think the salsa smelled that good while I was preparing it, but it resulted in some very delicious chicken! I immediately took some of the unused salsa and started marinating some tofu for my vegetarian husband for tomorrow night!

I actually changed it up a bit... here are my changes: 1. I used thin cut pork chops 2. I used a herb seasoning blend (basil, orageno, tyme, etc), garlic, sweet apple sauce, lime, lemon, salt, and pepper to taste. I threw the pork (coated good in the herbs, salt, and pepper) in a pan with olive oil, butter, garlic (chopped fine), and a half of a lime and lemon. Then after the meat had time to cook, I poured in apple sauce. Then I took out the pork and put it on a platter... and with the left-over sauce in the pan, I just poured it over the meat. I served it with mashed potatoes. My family loved it! Even my picky brother ate it and said he loved it. Thank you Eve11 for sharing this! :D

I fixed this for two, and it was fantastic, a bit of work time I suggest making it a day ahead of time and let the meat sit overnight in the marinade, but its well worth it. I am using the left over Salsa on every type of meat, and it always compliments it and makes it taste better.

I very much appreciate reading what changes others have made to a recipe.  I have no smell, and can taste only sugar and salt.  I made this recipe today.  I live in the country.....and made some substitutes...some based on others changes.  I could not find cardamom seeds in my small town, so used cinnamon and nutmeg...as a previous poster did, also did not have enough white sugar, so added some brown...as a previous poster did.  I had only 1 jalapeno pepper, but by some reviews, figured it would be hot enough with only 1.  Thought I had cilantro in my herb garden, but did not, and used sweet basil.  I have no idea what either of these herbs taste like.  Added a bit more applesauce, to empty the bottle, and slipped with the fresh lemon, and added a bit more juice.  Everyone loved it, and I will be making the salsa again on the w/e, to serve with chili lime tostitoes, at a friends pool party.  Thanks to much to ALL WHO POST...I value everyones opinion, and regularly read reviews before using a new recipe.

Incredible.  A lot of work though - but worth it.  Clearly I need to learn how to cut a mango because that was the toughest part.  The kids ate every bit.  It had a bit too much spice for them but they still ate.  It was fine for us though so I might cut the jalapeno to just half for the kids.  This recipe is a BIG hit.  I will try it again with jarred mango salsa to cut some time and see if it's just as good but the recipe as stated is perfect.

Although I didn't actually make the pork in this recipe, the tropical sauce is incredibly good!  I made as per recipe minus the cardamom as I didn't have any - can't complain, this sauce is a keeper.  Has some heat with sweet!

My husband really liked these pork chops.  A little time consuming for someone who does not like to cook, but it was well worth the effort.  I could not find a "pod" of cardamom nor was I going to purchase ground cardamom for $12 that I may never use again.  I found a spice substitute list and used ginger instead.  This is a 5 star for me.

Wonderful flavour! Might not use the whole pod of cardamom next time, but in all fairness I did it a little different. Rather than using the ingredients as a marinade that gets thrown away, I just spun up everything in the Vitamix, pan seared the pork chops and then poured the sauce into the pan to simmer with some extra chopped pineapple and mango for the last 10-15 minutes... delicious!

As usual, I didn't follow the recipe. I had a bottle of cardamom seed... No idea how much a pod is so I put the seed on top of the chili powder and cayenne pepper... About half of the cayenne pepper... I tasted the seed... Wasn't impressed. Tasted dirty. The marinade tasted wonderful right before I added the applesauce. I want happy about the addition of applesauce so I decided to not add the soy sauce or the additional rice wine vinegar... The pork chops were omg good! The family really enjoyed them!

For taste I'm giving it a 5 star review.    This was very good and had some nice heat to it.   I used half a jalapeno since the one I bought was on the large side. 

For written instructions I would give it a 4.   I felt that there were too many individual steps within step 2.   In fact, I missed a step and had to alter the cooking process slightly.   I'm a seasoned cook and I very rarely miss a step as I read recipes before I even begin.   So, next time I make this I'm going to highlight out the steps in bullet point 2.

Best pork chops ever!!  I changed two things. I used peaches instead of mangos and since I hate rice wine I used white wine vinegar. Fixing it tonight over blackened salmon (without the marinated). A good idea for a side is to cut up flour tortillas into triangles and fry in olive oil. Serve with the salsa.

The end result was tasty, but this is definitely a plan-ahead meal.  The salsa took a bit of work to prepare and next time I will just make it in the morning or even the day before.  I skipped making the spice paste and just combined the items in the saucepan.  I only used a small amount of jalapeno since we do not like things too spicy and I also used fresh pineapple.  Because of the weather I had to cook my chops on the stovetop, but I think grilling would be even better.

I so wanted to love this recipe. I prepared it exactly as written. The salsa was delicious - right up to the point of adding the applesauce. Applesauce ruined the texture and taste. Following through, I added the vinegar to the marinade then grilled the chops. All I could taste was vinegar. Now I'm trying to decide how to salvage the meat I couldn't eat. I'm giving this recipe two stars for the salsa which I will make again without the applesauce.

Excellent recipe prepared exactly as posted!
However, fresh mango can be a difficult item to locate in some areas, especially rural areas in the middle of winter. For when mango is out of season, buy it tinned and use the juice - do not add the sugar. Or, as some have suggested, buy a jar of prepared mango salsa :-)
When I am strapped for time, I prepare the salsa the day before and chill it overnight with the meat, and cook the marinade to use as a baste - cooking kills all the bugs that may have been left by the raw pork.
For those who, like me, do not have a food processor, a mortar and pestle works great and creates a nice paste. ;-)
A very nice, tasty recipe overall and will be prepared here often.

Short on time so used Renfros mango habanero salsa instead of making my own.  Will definitely make from scratch next time - I'm sure it will be much better.

This was amazing! I didn't have soy sauce or pineapple,  but used two mango, and a bit of worstishire sauce. i also cut the sugar in half, but it could be omitted as i thought it was sweet enough with the fruit. cooked the pork in the marinade. I then used this as the protein and the dressing on my salad. Wow, so good!
