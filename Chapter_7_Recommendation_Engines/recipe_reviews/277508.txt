I am a caramel lover, so for taste I rated this recipe at 5 stars. However, If possible to rate a recipe for more than one attribute, consistency would have been rated lower.  When I removed the cookies from the oven, they looked like cookies.  After  cooling on the pans for 5 minutes or so, they melted right into very tasty, chewy pancakes. For that reason we ate them. I even added another half cup of flour to the batter that remained after baking two pans, but no luck. If you're looking for a more conventional type of cookie, this one isn't for you. I have to wonder if there isn't a mistake in the flour measurement.  I will try again and add at least another cup of flour.  Another change I may try would be to dissolve instant coffee in a smaller amount of water,  say 1/8 cup, to see if that helps.

I appreciate you liking the flavors of the cookies and you are absolutely right about the cookies being very delicate. My husband loved them so I haven't played around with the cookie texture but will do so the next time I'm baking. Thank you for trying and reviewing!!!
