Beware this stuff is addictive. Forgot the baking soda, got distracted by my nephews needs. I turned out well. Very tasty!

We took this to a church gathering and it was a huge hit!  I used the parchment paper on the bottom and top.  It stuck to the top, so I will try spraying the candy on top with oil next time.  The baking soda does cause it to bubble up quite a bit, so a big pot is better!  I found my candy thermometer to be very helpful, especially because I had the burner up too high so it the sugar mixture was done in five minutes.

This is amazing.  Followed the directions and watched the video, everything worked wonderfully.  Only problem is you can't stop eating it.  Love all of Chef John's recipes.

You really need to work fast after adding the baking soda!  Have everything ready to go ahead of time.

I have made this for 4 years. So easy! Have your ingredients ready though. Very favorite fall treat.
