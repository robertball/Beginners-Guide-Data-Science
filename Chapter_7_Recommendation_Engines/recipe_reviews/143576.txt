Loved this recipe - thank you for sharing! Note for those wanting to make this for the first time...make sure your mangos are RIPE and of the sweeter variety - not sure how well it would work otherwise...

This is really good! I used a 9x9 square baking dish and had plenty of room for the recipe as written, so I would suggest using that size unless you like your bread pudding very thin - it will still bake for the same amount of  time. The cardamom was a nice touch, but a bit heavy-handed for me - I would probably use 1/2 the amount next time. I served this with a little warm coconut cream drizzled on top. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! I had stale baguette and 2 almost over-ripe mangoes to use up so this was perfect. I used cinnamon in place of cardamom and baked this in a 9x9 ceramic dish for just under 50 minutes. It tastes like delicious French toast!

I have made both this recipe and the one from which it derived which is made with sugar.  They are both very good. I made once using cinnamon and another time using the cardamom that the recipe calls for.  Again, both were very good. I used leftover multi-grain hamburger buns and the second time leftover challah bread.  A really simple, yet versatile recipe. Several other reviewers noted that very ripe mangoes should used and I agree. Really great bread pudding!

I used cinnamon instead of the cardamom, I also instead used a 9x9 square baking dish thanks to someone elses review and it was so plump! It turned out perfect.
