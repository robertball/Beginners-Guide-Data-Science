This is a great recipe. People frequently ask me to make this salad. And it's fairly easy to make too. I normally use 1/2 lb of salad shrimp (from the frozen section) instead of the canned shrimp. Sometimes I'll add a little bit of Old Bay seasoning. One time I did not green onions so I substituted chopped sweet onion, and it did not turn out as well. Stick with the green onion. Also, when I mix the ingredients, I start by combining the mayo and the tuna at the bottom of the bowl so that I can mix it well. Then I add the pasta and other ingredients.

Great starter salad but some changes seemed to make it better.  Too dry for 16 servings, so figured on only 8 so only used 1 lb of pasta.  But once made, there was plenty for more! For the dressing, I increased mayo to 2 cups, then used 1/2 cup Italian Dressing (Bernstein) & 1/2 cup Catalina (you can play around with other dressings too) & I added 1.5 Tablespoons of Old Bay, as other's have done.  Mixed all together and used 1/2 of the mix on the cooked pasta.  Let chill for 3 hrs, then added the seafood & the rest of the dressing mix.  I only used 1 can of Albacore Tuna (drained), 1 lb of fresh salad shrimp, and added a package of immatation crab (shredded).  I also added 2-3 cups of shredded Mozzarella cheese.  And it does get better each day, YUMMY!

Everyone at the potluck I brought this to, was asking for some to take home with them.  I added 16oz. of imitation crab meat. I could have done w/o the tuna, but that is just my personal preference. I also made a batch w/ fat free dressings and fat free miracle whip, perfect for my diet!

I make it the same way, but only mayo and not the dressings.  Never thought of that.  I will have to try it that way!

Pretty good - the longer it stays in the fridge the better it tastes IMO.Something is missing though.

Had twenty people over for a BBQ and this salad was a big hit. I was asked by several people for the recipe. Will make this for other events I cook for. Thanks for the recipe NOLLEEZ!

I really liked this pasta salad.  I get so tired of the Italian dressing pasta salads.  I didn't give it five stars, because I made some changes based on my family's personal tastes.
Here are the changes I made:
 ~ substituted imitation crab for the tuna
 ~ Western Dressing (aka "cow dressing") for the French dressing
 ~ No mayo...I added more thousand island dressing
 ~ added black olives and corn
