Excellent! Instead of putting it on a pan, try putting the shrimp in separate cups made of aluminum foil.  Pour in the butter mixture and broil.  The aluminum foil kept in all the sweet juices from the shrimp! Yummm!

I can't get enough of these.  They are far better than any prawns i've ever had at a restaurant. I make the sauce in the microwave, and don't usually need it to dip them in after. also, i find it a lot easier to make them assembly line style - dunk in the sauce, then flop each side on a plate of parmesan, then put them on a broiling rack. They come out perfect every time.

Bon appetite!  I didn't know what to do with all these prawns my husband brought home, and I have to admit, I was getting tired of butterflying all those shrimp, but the result was worth it.  I can't wait to make some more.  1/2 as much butter next time though, I had a lot wasted.  I may switch to part olive oil also to make it healthier.

This recipe was very easy,quick and delicious.  I love garlic, so I added a little more than the recipe asked for, and I put some of the pieces of garlic on the shrimp after I brushed them with the butter for a little extra flavor.  I didn't eat them as an appetizer though, it was great with pasta, and also great w/steamed rice, it had lots of flavor.

I made these last night to go with the Almond Crusted Halibut on this sight, and they were really good. I followed the recipe to a T and they came out pretty raw in the center. I used the Giant Tiger Prawns and I think that this wasn't enought time for the size of them in the broiler. Maybe 6-7 minutes next time.  THe parmesean cheese was awesome on them.. I'd even add more next time I do this recipe. :)

I butterflied them stuck them in a grill basket and grilled them. I grilled them shell side up first and brushed the butter mixture on them when I turned them over. The shell cradled the butter mixture and the prawns where fabulous. I didn't use the parmesan and they were still great.

These were absolutely fantastic!  I made them as a side dish using large prawns - which cut the broiling time to 1-1/2 minutes.  They turned out great!  A definite keeper!

Flavorful, easy. I lined a heavy sheet pan with foil to do mine, paying special attention to getting the garlic pieces and parmesan to stay on top of each shrimp. I gave a sprinkling of salt and cracked pepper for more flavor...My broiler did require a few more minutes to ensure they got done well. Also, with lining the pan with foil, it made it easy to pour off the excess butter and juices to use as a dipping sauce on the side. Wonderful idea and flavors here--highly recommended!

My husband LOVES shrimp...me, not so much.  I loved this one though.  The first time I made it, it was WAY to hot to turn the oven on.  So, I put the shrimp on foil, poured the sauce over the shrimp and sealed it up.  Put it on the barbeque grill for about 10 minutes...oh my, so tasty!

This is a good recipe ! The only thing that I would do different and did do is soak the peeled prawns in a bowl of water with salt added and dissolved to make a salt water brine to season the peeled Tiger Prawns with salt for 10 minutes ! Dissolve the salt in the bowl of water and taste for desired salty taste and than add your peeled prawns to soak to absorb the salt flavor for 10 minutes ! I would make this step 1 in the recipe instructions ! Than follow the original directions ! You'll now find that the Tiger Prawns are not flat tasting and are seasoned more Delicious for a much better  taste ! Enjoy !

I made this last night for my wife and was told to make it again today! It goes great with filet mignon and a couple of side veggies! I did cut the butter by half and still had plenty left for dipping. Thanks so much for such a simple yet DELICIOUS recipe!

Excellent and easy.  I marinated the shrimp with salt and pepper earlier in the day and like another reviewer had mentioned, prepared the butter (1/2 cup), lemon and garlic powder in the microwave then poured over shrimp and placed on aluminum foil lined cookie sheet into broiler. I served it over penne pasta mixed with pesto and olive oil. Kids love it - thanks for a keeper!

We made these for supper tonight - used smaller shrimp - and they were delicious. Didn't use as much butter as the recipe called for to keep the calories down.  Paired these up with penne pasta with marinara sauce side and asparagus.  Very delicious and easy.

These were very tasty and very easy!  I broiled for probably 7 minutes and it was a little too long.  Next time no more than 4 or 5.  I used the extra butter as a dipping sauce... it was delicious!

i will make this every time shrimp goes on sale from now on!!!  i made the sauce with about half a cup of butter, and used med sized shrimp (didn't have to butterfly them) and threw them in the pan to soak up the butter and begin to cook before i put them under the broiler.  since it was just my husband, my one year old, and me, we made the butter sauce one night and used half a lb of shrimp, then microwaved the leftover butter sauce the next night to use with the rest of the shrimp.  we served it with angel hair and broccoli.  PERFECT!

This recipe was AWESOME! I don't get the others who didn't like it.  Bland?  Needs salt?  No way, the butter and parm add plenty of salt and flavor.  If you don't add the cheese, you lose the YUMMMY crusted flavor.  Although I don't really measure things so I added like 4 cloves of garlic, which really adds to the flavor and was a bit like scampi.  But who doesn't like scampi?!  I poured the garlic lemon butter over the shrimp in a bowl and mixed it all up.  Then I sprinkled half the shrimp on a cookie sheet with red pepper chili flakes for my family who likes things KICKED UP a notch!  I served it with a side of pesto orzo pasta mixed with peas and the whole dish was to DIE for!  I could not stop eating the prawns!  So butterly flavorful, using a quick & perfectly timed cooking method...definitely a keeper!  Even used the extra garlic butter to go with the steamed crab "side dish" I also prepared.  Only downfall was the prep time, but next time I will splurge on peeled and deveined shrimp (which it called for) to save time.  But it was all worth it in the end!  DELISH!!

I used regular shrimp and put them in foil cups like someone else suggested.  Then I dumped the whole cup on top of some cooked pasta and sauteed mushrooms and red peppers.  Very good for a complete meal!

Maybe it was the Sam's Club prawns or that I didn't let them marinade long, but these were just neutral.  Not bad, just not great.

THIS RECIPE WAS DELICIOUS... MY FIANCEE AND I LOVED IT. A FEW THINGS I CHANGED AROUND THOU. I LEFT THE SHRIMP SHELL ON INCLUDING THE TAIL PART. THEN WHILE THE SHRIMP WAS ON THE BROILING GRILL, I KEPT THE DRIPPINGS AS A DIPPING SAUCE AND ADDED A LITTLE GARLIC SALT FOR MORE TASTE. ITS AWESOME...

This was a hit! I prepared the prawns brushed the sauce on top, some salt and fresh pepper then just sliced tasty cheddar cheese to fit the cavity and put them under the griller until the cheese was golden and bubbly. I drizzled a little more sauce over them as I placed them on the serving tray and served with a large green salad and garlic bread. Hubby ate all the leftovers and I cleaned his plate!

Nummy!  But garlic and prawns, how can you go wrong.  One small suggestion, as this is recommended for a movie night (read, it's dark).  Peel the shells first, pulling those off in a dark room is going to be messy.

This was a big hit with my guests.
I used fresh garlic but found that the lemon juice turned it a little blueish in color. It was also suggested by my health conscious wife that it was not necessary to have butter to dip the prawns in as they had enough juice/butter on their own. Hence, next time I will cut back on the butter to about 1/3 of a cup.

Quick, easy, delicious.  Might marinate the shrimp a bit next time.  Put it over spinach rice pilaf, side of steamed broccoli and cauliflower.  A keeper.  Thank you

Awesome!  I did not have tiger prawns so it took a really long time to butterfly my large shrimp but I made the mixture with less margarine and more garlic.  I marinated my shrimp in the mixture -laid them out and sprinkled them with a mixture of paprika, season salt and slap yo mama instead of the cheese.  Me and my kids loved them and waited up to have me fix more.  Served with mac and cheese and green beans and they were moaning like never before.  For the adult palate my choice would be jasmine rice and asparagus sides.  Delicious - cant wait to use the tiger prawns though.

I have been using this recipe for quite awhile now and everyone loves it. I often use regular shrimp instead of prawns with equally good results. Very quick and easy to make and very delicious.

After reading all of the reviews - I thought that this would be really great. It was good, but not great. I really liked the butter, lemon, garlic mixture. However, I felt that the parmesan gave it almost a pasty texture on the shrimp. Not sure if that was something I did or the recipe. Will use the idea, but probably not the exact recipe again.

This has quickly become a family favorite. I have even used scallops with the butter mixture and cooked them alongside the shrimp. It's easy to make and we serve it with rice for a meal the whole family enjoys.

I made them with lime and they were absolutely delicious. I cleaned, deveined, and butterflied the shrimp prior to broiling so they were easier to eat; we used the remaining butter mixture as a dipping sauce. Unbelievably tasty.

This was so nice and yummy. These prawns are easy to make and fun to pick up and eat. You really do have to use the large size shrimp with this one. The classic oxymoron: jumbo shrimp. Go with it.

The taste was good. I used only half the butter called for, per the suggestion of others. I think I may skip the butterflying next time, and simply flip them over halfway through the broiling. I had 3 thawed shrimp that wouldn't fit on my broiler pan, so I coated them and popped them in the oven for about 5 minutes; the result was basically the same.

I followed the recipe to a 't'  (with the exception of about 5 leaves of basil out of my herb garden, finely chopped) and these babies were devine... so good!

So I made mine a little different. Instead of melting the butter, i put it and the fresh garlic cloves in the food processor, crushed it and poured in the lemon juice.

Added a few things, 1T smoked paprika, 2T fine chopped parsley, 1 lemon grated with micro plainer. Heated the butter with the garlic until just bubbling, removed it from the heat and added everything except the prawns and cheese, let the butter mixture cool to room temp (5 min) . Added the prawns to coat, skewered 6 per skewer with a 1.5" chunk of pineapple and green bell cut 1" square between each prawn.
Sprinkled on some cheese. Broiled at 500 for 5 minutes on the top rack turning once after first 3 minutes. Super tasty!

Yummy! I used a bit more lemon juice, garlic, and parmesan cheese than called for, and also added a pinch of red pepper flakes. Definitely be careful not to over-broil these, as the shrimp will be rubbery and chewy! These beauties were mixed into our Christmas Eve fettucine, along with some sautéed mushrooms, garlic bread and a lovely Sauvignon Blanc. I can't wait to try these shrimp skewered and grilled - - I think they'd be over-the-top good that way!

EXCELLENT!  My changes were to use fresh garlic, butterfly from the top side, and I forgot the parmesan cheese.  This took such little time to make.  Earlier in the day I had made twice baked potatoes, so dinner was ready in a flash!   I served with a side of brussel sprouts.   This meal will definitely be seen again!   We really enjoyed it!   Thank you SP JENSEN for sharing!

These were a big hit at our bbq. We used jumbo shrimp and did not butterfly. We also used less butter as some others suggested. Delicious.

These were a hit!  I left the tails on and arranged shrimp in a pie dish, going around the perimeter of the dish.  First I (accidentally) baked the shrimp for about 5 minutes, at 450 - then I realized the broiler wasn't on, and let them sit under the broiler for minute as they were perfectly done.  The butter was the secret - so simple, but so good.

I adjusted for our taste as follows: melted 1/2c margarine and 1/4c olive oil in a pot over the stove; added 1 heaping tablespoon of garlic paste, 1 1/2 tbsp lemon juice from the bottle, a generous sprinkling of dried red pepper flakes, and 1/4c freshly grated asiago cheese; removed from heat and stirred just enough to mix it without cheese melting; then I dumped the raw peeled and deveined shrimp in the pot; stirred to coat all shrimp with the buttery cheesy sauce; dumped all on foil lined baking sheet; broiled on low for 8 minutes and when that didn't quite do it, I cranked the broiler up to high and broiled 3 more minutes. There was lots of juicy goodness in the pan so I poured it into a small bowl for dipping.  Easy and superb! Next time I'll reduce the amount of margarine and olive oil as there was plenty left over after the shrimp were gone. Thank you for submitting this delicious shrimp recipe!

This was a terrific appetizer, if a bit messy to make (what with all the melted butter). The guests would've been happy if there'd just been more of this and no entree at all!

I used jumbo prawns, and the end result tasted more like lobster than shrimp. This will become a favorite go to for seafood at my house.

This was FANTASTIC!!! - I did not have a broil pan so I put on a no baking dish and broiled - turned out fabulous!!! Lots of butter mix left over - i did not need to dunk but the boyfriend decided to... melted a fresh piece of grated parm cheese over each piece.

I thought these were just okay.  However, I did not add parmesan cheese.  It just didn't seem to go on the shrimp.  I took the advice of another user and placed the shrimp in a muffin pan and filled each cup halfway with the butter mixture.  The butter mixture was good but reminded me of shrimp scampi.  There was really nothing spectacular about this recipe, in my opinion.  I added some lemon and herb seafood seasoning to the shrimp before adding the butter mixture and baking them.  I would probably make this again but would add a little more spice to them.

Very nice flavor and is not hard on prep.  Only thing that I found was that I liked them under the boiler for about 30 minutes to get them a little more crunchy. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good, but I think it needed a little kick.  We'll definitely try it again, but maybe season the shrimp with some spices first.

I made these Friday for lent. They were very good.
