My husband LOVED this!  I used Taco Shells because that is what I had on hand (also made it easier to eat) and I used Jimmy Dean Sausage Patties, chopped up into pieces.  I also scrambled the eggs.  Next time I'll make homemade salsa to go with them.  Yummy!

Very delicious and easy to make. I followed the recipe and used pace picante salsa and ground pork sausage. Yum!
