I think if I would have made the frosting as is it would have been 4 stars, but I zested an orange and added it into the mix and it was definately a five star recipe with that addition.  Also, I think I ended up adding more than 2 T of orange juice.  I squeezed in what I thought was 2 T and it seemed a bit stiff and not quite creamy enough so I juiced the entire orange into the bowl.  This is NOT a glaze as one reviewer said... I can't even imagine what that person did wrong to make it runny enough to pass as a glaze.

My son asked for white cake with orange cream frosting for his birthday.  I found this and after reading the reviews I decided to use it but added 1 tsp. orange zest for a little more flavor.  It's perfect with a nice creamy flavor.  The only thing I'll do next time (and there will be next times) is make an additional half recipe of it.  I had to skimp to frost my 9" round cake.

This frosting is delicious and very creamy.  I added an extra tablespoon of orange juice for a slightly stronger flavor.  It generously frosted 18 chocolate cupcakes with some left over.  For a decorative touch, I drizzled melted chocolate on top.

I used 1 tablespoon fresh squeezed o.j. and 1 tablespoon o.j. concentrate. I really like the addition of the corn syrup. Yummy! It was the perfect icing for my orange chiffon cake.

this frosting is fantastic 5 out of 5 for if you are wanting a smooth creamy frosting  regardless of how much sugar was included in order to achieve the frosting supreme.
Enormous sugar content in this frosting, but delicious all the same.

This is good, but would love to have it taste more like orange. Perhaps next time, I will try to intensify the flavor.

Great recipe! 
As noted earlier 1 1/2 batches would be better for a 9" round cake. I blended all the liquid ingredients prior to adding to the sugar mix for better diffusion.I also deleted the vanilla and replaced it with 2 teaspoons of orange oil to intensify the flavor.

I made the recipe as is, but I halved it.  There's not enough of an orange flavour for me, and I feel like its too soft for me - I like to pipe my frosting instead of spreading it.  I felt like the orange juice dissolved the sugar once it was added, so even though my frosting was basically a dough before I added it, I just could not get it to be the consistency I wanted.  Next time I'll use orange concentrate instead of juice, and just use half of what the recipe calls for.

I was not blown away but this was definitely better than the pre-made, store frosting. A bit over sweet, but still good.

Turned out poorly! I had to turn to another recipe to help fix the damage done. The texture was just terrible, unspreadable, and did not taste well.

Absolutely fantastic frosting. I first made it in May 2018 for my own birthday cake that I made. I made in June for girlfriend's birthday cake. I made it again in early August to use as a crumb coat under fondant for a Rainbow Citrus cake for a co-worker. You have to manage the consistency on your own... most recipes need some tweaking. And yes, please use fresh zest whenever possible like one reviewer pointed out. Need I say more....

I loved this frosting!  I also added a bit extra orange juice and some orange extract to heighten the flavor.  Frosted 24 cupcakes for a bake sale and I couldn't keep them on the shelf!  Next time (and there will definitely be a next time) I will also add some orange zest and less extract.

I made this as a frosting for Chocolate Cake II from this website, trying to create a festive Chinese New Year feel. I quadrupled the recipe and used only 2 cups of sugar. It was already plenty sweet, and frosted almost 90 mini cupcakes. I did follow some reviewer's advice and added in the zest of an orange (I forgot I needed to quadruple the recipe when I zested the orange, and had no time to zest more later on). Instead of corn syrup, I used the sugar syrup I had leftover from candying orange slices for a topper. That helped to add the orange flavor to the frosting. I skipped the coloring and simply topped the cupcake with a quarter slice candied orange. It was a huge hit at the party I brought it to!

Tried this frosting with a chocolate cake!  Terrific.  Did think it was a little sweeter than i prefer.  Next time I make it, will probably not use the corn syrup.  Also used the orange peel as suggested by several others.  Used fresh squeezed juice and added the pulp as well.  Gave little bursts of extra orange flavor throughout.

Good basic frosting.  It doesn't taste orangey that I noticed.  Just use this as a base and add whatever flavour or colours you like.  I used this to ice Pumpkin Cake I from this website to make it look a bit like a pumpkin...you could put a green-icing cupcake on top to complete the effect.

I made this today to put on a chocolate Mother’s Day cake. I’ll preface this review by saying I have not made a cake or icing in many years. (And it’s a good thing my moms obligated to like it because I did not make it pretty - but that’s unrelated)

As others have mentioned, this frosting is improved with the addition of orange zest. I used the zest from a whole orange, which gave pretty orange flecks to the cream-colored icing.  The corn syrup is unnecessary and tilts the frosting into the "too sweet" range. This recipe works fine with vegan butter, e.g. Earth Balance. Rather than use orange dye, use your imagination to suggest orange -- orange candles, candied orange peel, orange-slide candy, or, if you are lucky, as I am, to have access to kumquats or calamondin oranges, (see my photo), use the real thing, in miniature, as an accent.

The basic recipe is okay, but like others, I had to enhance the orange flavor. I didn’t have any oranges for fresh zest so I added a little bit of orange extract. The frosting was also too thick and I had to add a bit more orange juice to thin it. After these two additions, it was perfect.

Pretty good recipe. I used OJ concentrate to flavor. Probably used 6 or 7 tablespoons to get the right consistency. Added a few shakes of lemon zest for fun. Didn't add color, but the concentrate have it a nice lightly orange color. I would definitely use this recipe again.

Pretty tasty. I added orange zest and the juice of a whole orange because I wanted a really strong orange flavor. I ended up adding more powdered sugar though because it wasn't as stiff as I wanted (so maybe the original post is the right mix?). Also skipped the food coloring, and it was still a nice color.

Way too sweet!  I needed to drink a big glass of milk after a cupcake with this frosting.   The sweetness deadened my taste buds.  Next time I'd like to try a thin glaze with my citrus layer cake.

Be sure to add an extra tablespoon of orange juice (fresh squeezed is a must!) and add zest from one medium orange. This makes it outstanding! I paired it with white cake and it tastes like a creamsicle :))

After reading the reviews, I decided to tweak the recipe a bit myself and my husband and I just loved it. I had about two tablespoons of cream cheese so I only used 6 T. of butter and the 2 T. of cream cheese. I also grated some orange peel into the frosting and probably used a tsp. more of orange juice.  I don't know how much of a difference it made, but it sure is good. I did not use any food coloring, but I wasn't interested in the color being orange. I will certainly make again, and maybe next time use 4T of butter and 4T of cream cheese.

Very tasty. I did add orange zest and extra powdered sugar to it to get the consistency right for icing cookies. The extra powdered sugar DID NOT change the flavor any though.

This was super good but I added more juice and some orange zest. I also didn't add the Orange dye. But in all I liked it.

I didn't have vanilla extract so I used almond extract because I used that in my cake. I also used maraschino cherry juice. It turned out perfect and I didn't have to use food coloring, great for Valentine's Day

I made this to top the Rainbow Citrus Cake. I didn't think there would be enough but it just covered the cake. It's a little too sweet and could be a little thicker. Love the vanilla flavor!
