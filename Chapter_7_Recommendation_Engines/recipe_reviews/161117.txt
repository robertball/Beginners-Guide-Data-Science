Hard to pinpoint why I wasn't crazy about this recipe - I think I wanted more of an oyster sauce flavor but the pepper in it was pretty overwhelming.  I know that's why the person who submitted the recipe likes it so much, but I would tone down the pepper next time (and I like spicy).  Served it with some nice steamed veggies over brown rice and it made a very nice meal.

Instead of vegetable oil, I soaked my beef strips in 1 tablespoon cooking white wine, 1 tablespoon cornstarch. I added the oyster sauce last just before turning off the stove. Serve it over rice.

I like this recipe, but agree with the other reviewer who said that the black pepper overwhelms the dish.  Oyster sauce is a rather delicate flavor.  I will cut back the pepper to 1/4 teaspoon next time I make it and maybe add some red pepper flakes if I want it spicy.

This recipe is a pretty standard beef stir-fry. I cooked it in a wok,  and added a package of stir-fry vegetables. I served it over white rice.

Loved how spicy it was and put more water to it at the end because we loved the sauce. The sugar made a huge difference, it was so tasteful.

I bought oyster sauce months ago and never used it. Today I was looking for a recipe for my beef filet and found this recipe, it's easy and my children loved it, even my little boy who is not a big fan of meat. I made it with mashed potatoes as a side dish and it went well with the sauce, I only put a pinch of black pepper and added a bit of water while cooking to make more sauce.

I made it twice. The first time as is. Liked it but wanted more sauce.   The second time I added a lot more oyster sauce. It made it quite salty but still yummy. I also added chopped red and yellow peppers, green onions and garlic to the meat. I'll probably make it again.
