The 'crumb' was off for me personally, from the original version of the cake.  I used 1 cup of mini chocolate chips to keep them from sinking to the bottom of the cake.  It was drier and less dense, but no one noticed the difference--the cake plate was empty!  Glazed it with the "Chocolatey Satin Glaze" from AR.

I DID BOTH VERSIONS AND HAVE DONE THIS ONE TWICE BY ACCIDENT BECAUSE I BOUGHT LOW FAT SOUR CREAM FOR SOMETHING ELSE AND ENDED UP USING IT. I DID THE HALF OIL BECAUSE OF OTHERS SAYING THAT 1 CUP WAS TOO MUCH....AND ITS STILL DELICIOUS. I ASLO USED THE SATINY CHOCOLATE GLAZE FOR THE TOPPING AND ITS SPOT ON. THE RECIPE IS ON THIS SITE AS WELL. IT ONLY TAKES A MINUTE TO MAKE IT IN THE MICROWAVE OVEN.

The original is still my preference, but this was still very good and everyone enjoyed it.

This is a great recipe...easy to follow, inexpensive to make, and very tasty without  the calories.  This recipe stretched to 36 cupcakes that are (unfrosted without confectioners sugar or icing) 146 calories each! And, they taste quite nice , not requiring icing to balance out a less than appealing cupcake flavor.  Worth making again....and again!!

This cake was a hit at a party. I used a 17 oz package of chocolate cake mix, 5 g instant pudding mix, 3/4 cup oil, and 1.75 cups mini chocolate chips with a whipped cream and cream cheese icing. I baked it in two 9" round pans for 40 minutes with buttered sides and parchment paper on the bottom. The batter was unusually thick, but the cake still turned out very soft. Everyone loved it! Will make again but will try substituting the oil next time with something else to make it "healthier".
