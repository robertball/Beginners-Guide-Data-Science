This was so easy and very tasty.  I didn't have a lime, but I did have a lemon so I used the zest from that.  Other than that, I made it as written.  The raisins were a nice addition.  I also added some sliced scallions on the top for added color.  I will definitely make this again.

Made as written - and it was extremely  fragrant (which I don't prefer my meat dishes to be) and the types and amounts of spices seemed way out of proportion.  I would definitely halve or omit the thyme and ginger, and consider adding something to give it some heat.  The sauce is very liquid-y and could use some thickening as well.  I don't think i'd make it again!

There are lots of good ingredients in this meal, and the flavors come through, but for my family they just didn't play well together. Another problem for me is that this was done in just 4 hours on low heat. I turned it down to Warm, but the potatoes were mush by the time we ate 2 hours later. We all tasted it, but no one ate it; none of us could figure out how to make it work for us, and we really like like Jamaican food. Thanks for the recipe, but we won't be making it again.

This was good. I served it with rolls as sugested. I liked it alot and will definity make it again. The minor prep made it a breeze to make, and my little brother had fun helping me with it.

Just too sweet for us. The flavor got old quickly.

I made this because I wanted something different and healthy in the slow cooker, and I was pleased. I did change the recipe based off of my available ingredients. I used 
1tsp onion powder in lieu of onions (Im pregnant and the scent of onions makes me sick and I cant eat anything with onions), 
1 tablspoon lime juice
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tblespoon BBQ rub (didnt have jamacian jerk-could have used 1.5-2tbsp)
1/2 tsp curry (its island-y) since I was worried about the lack of flavor from the other reviews
and skipped the raisins and tyme as I didn't have any.
Overall very good, different, and slightly sweet. NOT overly sweet but I did change the recipe. The curry wa a nice touch, could probably go to 1 teaspoon while still keeping the Jamacian flavor. It was a nice change to the average beef in the crock pot, and was healthy.  I paired with steamed spinach and Tostones (delish!), and my husband scooped it up with pita bread.  I would make this again, but feel comfortable playing with the recipe--although Im sure they would serve this over white rice in the islands, might be too plain.

Awesome recipe even though I misread "slow cooker" for "Pressure cooker" Duh.  Anyway, cooked it in the Pressure cooker for 3 and a half hours - came out great!!  I also modified it slightly because my family likes more spicy recipies. I added 2 heaping tbsps of hot paprika, fresh ginger (1 tbsp), half a cup of coconut flakes, and the juice of the lime (and a handful of hot peppers).  I also used 1 tbsp of roasted cumin instead of the tsp of regular.  The recipe is the bomb!  If you like spicier food - this oughtta do it for you!

I found this recipe to be extremely bland. It didn't turn to mush in the slow cooker but on my plate it did. I won't be making this again.
