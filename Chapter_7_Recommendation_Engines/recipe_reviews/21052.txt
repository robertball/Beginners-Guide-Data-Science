My mother has made this for as long as I can remember and its fabulous. The only thing to note is storing it in plastic containers will give it a strange taste after several days.

I have had nothing but success with this recipe! I've made it rocky road-style, with walnuts and marshmallows, and I've also made it with just marshmallows to appease my boyfriend. Both times, the fudge came out perfectly. A tip if you're using the microwave-- keep an eye on it and stir a little bit partway through to keep smooth. I've also used fat-free condensed milk, which made no difference to the recipe. I'm heading to the store now to get the ingredients to make it for tomorrow!

I've used a recipe much like this for several years.  I found adding salt, like 1/4 teaspoon, gives it a buttery flavor.  And I always use the milk choc. morsals.  very creamy!

Never made fudge before. The first time I made this, I didn't measure the ingredients because I only wanted to use what I had in the kitchen. The fudge didn't set even when I froze it. I realize I  added too much milk! So I melted everything again and added more chocolate. This time it set up just the way it should! Delicious!!! I recommend storing these in an air-tight container coz if left in the fridge just wrapped in foil, the fudge will absorb the odor of other food.

Fantastic and easy. I stirred my mixture every 30 seconds and cooked it for a total of 2 minutes and it was perfect. I also used semisweet chocolate chips. My only possible critique was that I feel it used a little too much vanilla extract, so I'll probably only put in  1.5 tsp next time. But there will definitely be a next time. :) EDIT: I made this a second time with raspberry-chocolate chips and it came out just as well. I only used one tsp of vanilla and probably could've used none. Just a really good recipe.

This is FABULOUS, and so EASY!!  I have made quite a few batches of this fudge in the past couple of weeks.  I made rocky road fudge by adding marshmallows.  Then I made peanut butter (with no nuts) by adding about 3/4 cup peanut butter chips to the mix, and sprinkling the peanut butter chips on top.  And finally, I made raspberry white chocolate chip fudge (with no nuts) by using raspberry flavored chocolate in place of 10 oz of the regular semi-sweet chocolate, and added white chocolate chips on top.  GREAT recipe--everyone loves it!  Thanks!

Simply divine! My 5 and 7 year olds made batch after batch for Christmas presents. I used semi sweet chocolate chips instead of baking chocolate and it was even easier to make

this is the easiest, and most wonderful fudge I've ever made! You can't mess it up, and believe me I'm very capable of messing things up.. but it's completely foolproof! I gave my mom this recipe, and she told me I was crazy, that it had to be nasty because "she's never heard of good fudge coming out of a microwave". BUT, she tried it, and LOVED it. Sorry mom, you were wrong weren't you? 5 stars all the way :)

Five stars because it's super easy and requires only two ingredients (vanilla and walnuts are optional)! I'm no fudge expert but this one was very satisfying. Thank you for posting!

Eh...not so much.  It was okay, but I think I'm spoiled on real fudge.  I like my fudge to taste and feel like fudge regardless of the cooking method.  I will make this again, but with different expectations and different chocolate.  It was really pretty, though and sliced like a dream!  Anyway, not good, not bad, so I gave it a three.

Rich, deep chocolate flavor when made with high grade semisweet chocolate pieces. Here is a great way to serve it a la Brazilian style: cool the fudge to room temperature, scoop one level teaspoon of it, fold in a piece of nut, roll into a ball in your hands and then roll on chocolate sprinkles to cover it evenly. Place it in a tiny little paper cup. Repeat the steps until all of the fudge is in little cups. Arrange them around a cake or scatter throughout the table where you have other desserts. Let your guests eat them as they please. (1) ROLLING TIP: You may want to lightly grease the palms of your hand with butter before handling the fudge -- this will prevent it from sticking to your hands. (2) SCALING: Microwave only ONE BATCH AT A TIME, as the results from increasing the ingredients may not be satisfactory. (3) SUBSTITUTE TIP: Do you like caramel flavor more than chocolate? Don't have chocolate chips/squares at home? No problem. Make the recipe as is tradicionally made in Brazil. Replace the chocolate chips with 3 heaping tablespoons of cocoa power and one tablespoon butter (softened). Mix well with the condensed milk before microwaving. Let it cool and form it as indicated above. And voila -- now you have Brigadeiro, as they call it in Brazil. (4) RATING: chocolaty, very sweet, and tasty. Its flavor is different from that of "true" fudge. Keep this in mind when rating the recipe. Please don't rate it low based on taste comparison. It is a delicious chocolate candy sna

Very smooth and creamy. I added 1/4 tsp salt per another reviewer's suggestion but I think I'll leave it out next time. Very simple yet tastes authentic.

My friend made this for Eid to celebrate the end of Ramadan and we all looooooved it!  Here are her tips --- (1) spray the pan and the spatula with cooking spray, (2) use chocolate chips for easier melting, (3) toss in some mini marshmallows,(4) sprinkle chocolate/white chocolate swirled chips on top, and (5) use a sharp knife to cut the fudge.  She cut them into little cubes and served them in mini-paper cups.  Adorable and delicious!

I made this last Christmas after spending a couple of days making truffles that would not stiffen... (So much for wasting food).

I loved it since it is an easy recipe, which does not take much time or money. 

A couple of comments to some of the other reviews.  Some people said theirs turned out like a chocolate bar.  Mine didn't, however, when I made it a second time and had it in the fridge for a while it was rather hard and almost like a chocolate bar.  Letting it sit out for a bit made it smooth and easy to cut again.

Regarding the fudge tasting like chocolate morsles:  Since I am sitting here in Europe (Germany to be exact) I did not use Chocolate morsles as you can't get them.  American chocolate has in general a lot more wax in it - a reason why I don't care much for it...  Anyway, if you want good fudge use good chocolate.  Any German, Swiss or Belgian chocolate may cost more, but it will make your fudge taste better (and you don't have to go for Lindt - Ritter Sport will do).

I am getting adventurous over here and will try out my next fudge with a bit more chocolate and added Bailey's.

Wow Melissa, THANKS!  I gave up making fudge years ago.  We live in the woods down in a hollow where it's usually humid.  My fudge was always grainy.  Even on hot sunny summer days it wouldn't come out right.  I made this yesterday while it was snowing and it's the greatest!  I'm surprised how creamy it was.  Thanks again for a great recipe!

This recipe is AWESOME!  I made a batch last night, and it's already gone.  So, I made more tonight.  I found it worked better over a double boiler than in teh microwave.  Mine burned a little in the microwave and the chocolate chips never got smooth.  The double boiler was easier to regulate.  We will keep this forever!!!

So easy anybody can do it. I make mine dark chocolate fudge by using a 12 oz. bag of semi-sweet chips and 4 oz. of unsweetened baking chocolate. It is still plenty sweet to me. For Christmas try sprinkling with crushed candy cane pieces while still warm - be sure to press them down so they stay.

This fudge was sooo easy to make and yummy.  The only problem is that it is very sticky.  But it had the fudge flavor, not the buttery fudge flavor.  But, for someone who can't make fudge, this fudge turned out awesome.  I wanted PB fudge so I used a bag of PB chips.  Next time I am going to use Chocolate/Mint chips.  I also did one other reviewer said to do, stirred the mix every 30 secs...turned out perfect.

Fast and Easy! I used half semi-sweet chocolate chips and half milk chocolate chips.  Next time I will use only the milk chocolate chips.  I found I only needed 60 seconds in the microwave to melt the chocolate enough to be stirred smooth. So, I recommend checking every 30 seconds so you don't over-cook it and make it grainy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Simple and quick, this is a great fudge recipe for kids to make. I used fat-free sweetened condensed milk and it was still delicious. I love "no fuss" especially at Christmas when time always seems short but you still want to make something fun and festive.

This fudge turned out SO well! It literally took five minutes to make and then you just stick it in the fridge and forget about it for a few hours. Will definitely be making this again.

I can't believe how easy and delicious these were.  I only had pecans on hand and used about a cup of them.  When he bit into one my husband exclaimed, "You made these?!".  I chose not to tell him that all I did was microwave and stir :)  I also only had a 12 oz bag of semisweet chocolate so I added about 4 oz of white chocolate chips and it still tasted delicious.  I put the full two tsp of vanilla and thought it tasted great.  Will def be a holiday go to.

I add a couple tablespoons of butter to this to give it a little shine and a very smooth texture. A really rich recipe that should definitely be taken in small portions, but so good!

Super easy, no double boiler or candy thermometer required!  As noted earlier, add 1/4 tsp salt.  It will take this from great to amazing!

This by far was the easiest fudge I have ever made. A while ago I bought fudge "kits" which gave you all the ingredients needed, cost $10, and told you how to make it. This fudge was easier to make and tasted better. I used mini semisweet chocolate chips for 12 oz of the chocolate and 4 oz of milk chocolate chips. I did not use the walnuts and did everything else like the recipe said. I literally measured, dumped, melted, refridgerated. My chocolate only took 1 minute to melt; I checked it to stir it and it was melted without me having to stir it much. Again, it tasted great but the fudge was a little to thin(heightwise) for me. Maybe next time Ill use a 6 inch dish. Great recipe!

I was looking for a sugar free recipe and converted this one by using unsweetened chocolate, evaporated milk, and 3.5 cups of splenda sweetner.  I added the splenda and vanilla to the milk and then added the chocolate.  I stirred the mix every 30 seconds.  This is the best recipe ever.

I love this fudge recipe because the finished product comes out smooth, not grainy like when you use that nasty, gooey marshmallow stuff in a jar.  This is very versatile when it comes to mix-in's, too.  I've added nuts, crushed peppermint candies, and even crumbled pretzels.

Really great texture and base to add all kinds of nuts, dried fruit and whatever you can think of. 
I usually use 72% Cocoa Chocolate and I have tried different combinations of Crasins, candied ginger, dried apricots, walnuts, almonds, etc. All very tasty.

This is the best fudge recipe I have ever used. It is a fool-proof way to make delicious fudge. For the holidays place in a foil-lined funnel to make giant homemade "kisses".

The are very easy and the texture of them is good when they cool.  However, they taste a lot like eating semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I'll keep looking for a good, easy fudge recipe.

This is a great recipe!! It's so easy that I made it in my dorm room to take to a potluck!! I used 1 bag of milk chocolate chips and 1/2 bag of semi-sweet, just so that it was a bit sweeter.  I also substituted peppermint extract for the vanilla extract (I used about 1 teaspoon instead of 2) to make mint chocolate fudge.  I also omitted the walnuts (personal preferance).  No one could believe I made it in the microwave!! Definitely a keeper!

I LOVED this recipe. Simply perfect.

Instead of using the semisweet chocolate, I just bought 16 oz of my favorite chocolate and used that.

Sweeter than intended, so I took out the walnuts and added some 76% dark chocolate chunks instaed.

AMAZING and easy!

Very easy and very delicious. I used 8oz semi-sweet baking chocolate and 8oz of hershey dark chocolate baking bar. Refrigerated overnight.  The texture came out perfect. Firm, easy to cut and stayed perfect even at room temp - a hit at our holiday party. Next I will try adding flavorings.

This gets 5 stars because it is just so simple! I have been making this recipe for years and it is great to make as a last minute holiday gift. Leave extra foil on the sides so you can pull it out of the pan- so easy to cut into small squares.

This was great.  It tasted just about as good as the Fantasy Fudge recipe that I've made for years.  I threw in a handful of marshmallows and used both chopped pecans and walnuts.  I used a glass 9x9 inch baking dish and just microwaved and stirred everything in it rather than dirtying up a bowl...and making sure I sprayed it with pam first.  Good recipe.

This fudge was so easy to make and oohh so chocolaty!  I did cut down on the walnuts when mixing ingredients together, but I sprinkled some on top before refrigerating for appearance.  I would also recommend when the fudge has set in the fridge, to take it out and let it come to room temperature before cutting.  I broke one of my cheap knives trying to cut it!

This recipe is really quick, easy, and yummy.  I like it better when it's harder, so I cut the fudge into smaller pieces and refridgerated it more.  I didn't add any nuts, and it still tasted good.

I could not begin to say how wonderful this fudge tastes.  It would be a 10 star if I could go that high.  Who would believe it, as it is so simple to make?  My kind of recipe, easy.  Also the top is so beautifully shiney, it looks gorgeous on a serving platter.  I will keep this recipe and take it to functions when I need to carry a tray of food.  Thanks so much Melissa for  sharing this with me.

This was very easy and delicious! We gave it to someone as a gift and they kept asking for the recipe. It tasted just like real fudge. You MUST make this chocolatey delight! Also, we made it with marshmallows and nuts. This was just as well. Five stars! AWESOME and YUMMY!

No, no, no, a perfect way to waste a lot of food. I did not like this at all. Way too chocolaty, and strong, not smooth. No one in my family liked this. Will not be making this one again.

This was my first attempt at fudge and it went great! It was easy, and I was told it the results were better than one of the more complicated recipes someone always makes.

it was a little rich tasting but it was very good. i would recommend maybe using milk chocolate maybe it wont be so rich tasting. i cut the serving size down to 32 and i was able to make it in a square 5x5 inch glad plastic container. and i quick cooled it before dinner in the freezer and was able to enjoy it after dinner.

This turned out perfect!!! I substituted 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips so used 1 1/2 cups of semi-sweet chips and 1/2 cup of butterscotch, and WOW!  I think this is the BEST fudge I've ever had!!  So easy, and doesn't require the marshmallow creme!!

Completely awesome!  So easy!  Substituted semi-sweet chocolate chips to make it even easier!  Have made this SO much this holiday season and still have more to make as people love it!  You will not get a more decadent, rich and creamier fudge then this!

Yay. This turned out great. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips to make things SUPER easy. I also used pecans instead of walnuts and added craisins. Try the pecans and craisins, it is soooo good. My husband and BIL loved them.

Another unbelievable result from something so easy.  I used a full bag of semisweet chips and a little bit of milk chocolate chips (to use them up!).  I'd add a pinch of salt to this - but other than that, it's PERFECTION.

I mixed in 3 chopped Heath bars with the vanilla and then coarsely chopped a 4th Heath bar up and sprinkled it on top of the fudge. I also used milk chocolate and we loved the results. I imagine there are a lot of candy mix ins that would be great with this recipe.

This is the best fudge recipe that's out there.  Instead of microwaving the chocolate I slow cooked it useing a double boiler the first time I made it.  The second and third time I made it I microwaved it and will melt the chocolate on the stove when ever I make it again - I really think it comes out better that way, it hardens up real nice melting on the stove.  The second/third time I made it I used dark chocolate candy bars/mixed dark with milk chocolate chips - also came out real nice (though softer because I microwaved them I belive).  When these batches are gone I'm going to experiment with different kinds of chocolate.  Thank you very much for this recipe!!

I took this to a church picnic, and everyone LOVED it. Since I don't like chocolate to be too sweet, I made 3 ounces of the chocolate unsweetened. It was not even close to being bitter. Then I melted some peanut butter chips and spread it on top of the fudge-- delicious! I think next I'll replace an ounce or two of the chocolate with creme de menthe chips and try some mint fudge. There is a lot you can do with this recipe!

This was very disappointing. It did not taste like traditional fudge, but more like plain old melted chocolate chips. It actually brought out a waxy taste in the chocolate chips (I used Toll-House chocolate chips). Maybe it would be better using more of a premium brand of chocolate chips? I won’t be making this again.

So quick, qo easy, so delicious! I used chocolate chips which melted down very well. Would love to try this with maybe some Peanut Butter & Chocolate chips. I don't care for anything too rich, and, surprisingly, even with all the sweetened condensed milk, the fudge wasn't too rich at all. Great recipe!

I'm not too sure about this one. I love semi-sweet chocolate but thought the flavor just didn't seem quite right for this recipe.  I appreciated the convenience of doing it in the microwave and the way it quickly sets.  Certainly it is something that will help satisfy the sweet tooth, but I don't think I'll be using this recipe again.  The flavor just isn't  what I had in mind for chocolate fudge.

This was the easiest fudge recipe ever!  The fudge turned out very creamy.  And there are so many ways you could spice up this recipe, add marshmallows and nuts for Rocky Road Fudge, peanut butter or even orange extract for Orange Fudge.

My previous attempt at fudge looked more like that chocolate river the chubby German kid fell into in Willy Wonka; however, this recipe was WONDERFUL!  The fudge turned out delicious, there were simple ingredients and directions to follow, and it was so delightfully EASY!!!!  This will be my new fudge recipe to use at  Christmas.  Thank you!!

This fudge tastes really amazing, it was pretty easy to make, except for the fact that I spent a really long time chopping up the chocolate, so the prep time was much more than 15 minutes. The other thing that I didn't really like about this recipe is that I made it for 36 servings thinking it would be enough for my class of 12 and for my mum and I, but it ended up being only enough for my class. This was a little bit annoying but it's okay, the fudge is GREAT!

This fudge is soooo easy! I did use fat free sweetened condensed milk, sugar-free chocolate chips and i made one batch with the nuts and another with dried cherries. Everyone thought they were awesome. Just a tip if you use sugar-free chocolate, it is a natural laxative, so please warn people to limit themselves to 1 or 2 pieces. :)

This did not work at all. I even put it in the freezer to speed it out. all afternoon and all night! I give this 3 stars because it was still yummy. But it's a waste cuz it's too much to eat!

I used about 1½ cups Hershey's Dark Chocolate chips and about 1½ cups semi-sweet chips. I omitted the walnuts and sprinkled the top of the fudge with peppermint decorator's sugar before popping the pan in the fridge. Is it fudge? Not really, but it sure is tasty! And I'm storing it in a plastic container with no funky flavour issues. :) Thanks for sharing, Melissa!

Like others say, it's not really fudge. But it's good chocolate candy that's easy and fast. I used half milk chocolate chips in my rocky road version, which made it too sweet and not chocolately enough. Next time I will use really dark chocolate because the sweetened condensed milk adds all the sugar needed.

i'm not a big fan of semi sweet chocolate (unless they're in Mrs. Fields cookies) so i went on and used half semi sweet & half milk chocolate chips for my version.  it came out GREAT!  excellent topping for ice cream and is great on top of fudge brownies.  yum!

I thought this was good for such a simple recipe.  My husband loved it though!  Will make again for the ease of it if anything else.  I also made it a second time replacing the semisweet chocolate with white chocolate chips, and additionally I added 1 tsp. of orange extract... YUM!!  I took it to our holiday party & it was gone long before any other food & I had tons of recipe requests.  Will make that variation again too!

Very good flavor. I added the 1/4 tsp of salt and 1/4 cup of margaring to the mix. I also used half semi sweet chocolate chips and half milf chocolate chips. Turned out very well and sets up nicely.

The is so easy to make and simply delicious!!  Everyone loved it.  The first batch I made according to directions, it was a huge hit.  The next batch I added 2 teaspoons of a coffee liquor instead of the vanilla, and it was equally delicious!!  Couldn't ask for an easier or faster recipe, especially when you are in a time crunch around the holidays.

Delish! Not the best fudge I've ever had, but definitely a no-fail, no-prep version. It tastes good and you could mix it up by adding various nuts or changing the type of chips- milk chocolate works great!

This recipe is great, but I gave it four stars because it turns out much more like a chocolate bar/candy rather than fudge. Overall the taste is excellent and it's super easy to make, so I'll definitely be adding it to my holiday goodie list, but I'll still probably keep an eye out for other more traditional fudge recipes.

I love this fudge recipe, we make it for Christmas gifts every year. Our variation is to mix up two batches, one made with chocolate chips, one made with peanut butter chips, and layer them in a 13x9 pan to make peanut butter fudge. The possible variations are endless!

This is a great and easy recipe. I've made this several times. I did change it up a bit on one batch. Used white chocolate morsels and added crushed Oreo cookies for a cookies and cream fudge. Turned out awesome! Had so many compliments.

It passed the mom test-the biggest critic of all.

This was my first attempt at making fudge. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was delicious! I will definitely be making this again. I couldn't believe how easy it was!

Delicious and easy! This fudge is good as is, or you can add nuts, marshmallows, candy. I put red and green M&Ms over the top before putting it in the fridge.

I made it without nuts, but sprinkled crushed candy canes on top & tapped them into the fudge while it was still warm. Loved it! Super easy - 10 min from pan prep & crushing candy canes, to fridge!

I first made this fudge when I was in 4-H. It was one of the items I had to make.  I have tried others, but this one is the easiest and richest.  My kids and grandkids love It.

Great recipe! I used Ghirardelli 60% cocoa chips because I prefer those over milk or semi sweet chocolate chips, skipped the nuts and used orange extract instead, WONDERFUL!! Thanks for providing a base for my fudge making! so creamy!

This was my first time attempting to make fudge...
It was so delicious that I was proud to say I made it.
I used a rum-Vanilla extract in one batch and it was wonderful.
I used perpermint extract in my second batch and sprinkled the top with crushed pepermint stick, (patting it into the fudge).
Both batches were thoroughly enjoyed by all.

I used to make this before I had my gastric bypass surgery. It's PHENOMENAL and I miss it, lol. If I were still "allowed" to have it, I totally would. ;)

So easy to make! It's also so dense I could only eat some small piece at a time. I would like to make it again, but this time use a good portion of milk chocolate chips.

I made this recipe this evening. The only changes I made were adding a cup of small marshmellows instead of nuts and I used sweet chocolate chips. The fudge set up really well. Husband loves it. My only question is how did you get 48 servings out of the recipe? I will add this to my list of favorites. Thanks for sharing.

Excellent with lots of walnuts!  If you make it with Peanut Butter swirled in, it takes longer to dry.  Make sure you spread out on cookie sheet and dry in refrigerator not freezer.  Very easy and very fast!

It came out perfect. Adding the 1/4 tsp. of salt was a good idea. Be sure to pour into pan before it cools too much.

This is great fudge. My boss' wife made some of this for us last year and I was so impressed I had to get the recipe. I can't believe how easy this is. I do use chocolate chips also. The consistency is different from fudge, it's more like a candy bar.

This is a easy and good chocolate candy- but I wouldn't call it fudge- it just doesn't have that fudgy flavor and texture. I gave it a 3 because it was super easy... but for fudge I'll stick to my stove top recipe.

For a quick fudge recipe, this is the best!  We like real dark chocolate so I added two ounces of chopped unsweetened chocolate, and I omitted the nuts this time.  Does get real hard while chilling, but I just let it sit at room temp it out for about 15 minutes and it cuts like a dream.  It is not like old-fashioned, stove top & candy thermometer type fudge, but it is definitely a quality recipe!

Flavor-wise this was all right (you can't go too far wrong with chocolate, after all!), but I've definitely had better tasting fudge before, plus I found its texture to be a bit harder than I'd prefer. But it gets 5 stars for ease of preparation, so I settled on a 4-star rating overall.

I left out the nuts and swirled peanut butter over the top. People said it was soft but that it tasted good. For as easy as it was I'd make it if someone wanted fudge but I don't know that I would eat it myself.

This was the first time I've ever made fudge! My mother (who Loooooves fudge) said it was wonderful & my three children loved it too! It took me 5 minutes to make and I added mini marshmellows & a sprinkling of walnuts over the top! I can't wait to try variations on this with 1/2 cup peanut butter or butterscotch chips or white chocolate swirls!
