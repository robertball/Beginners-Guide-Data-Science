Very good!  They were light, had a good flavor and I added 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese.  My family and company loved them.  I served them with Ken's Honey Mustard Salad Dressing and also some blue cheese dressing.

My family loves carrots, but we always get tired of raw, or steamed. That was the only way I knew how to prepare them. When I found this recipe I was so excited. I had everything on hand and I made them immediately. The family ate them up and they ask for them all the time. I have to at least make them once a week. I think my son would eat them everyday if I would make them. Thanks so much for this recipe.

These were perfect! I prepared them according to the directions with the exception that I didn't fry them quite as long as stated. They seemed to be cooked in half the time. I might have gotten a rather strong shallot because the amount called for in the recipe seemed a little strong. They were very easy to prepare and tasted wonderful paired with a salad and some broiled fish. Thanks for the keeper recipe!

These are soooo good.  I didn't have shallots so I added a touch of garlic powder and some finely chopped sweet onion.  Yummmmm!

These were actually pretty good.  Different then your normal carrot recipe.  I cheated and did not make my own bearnaise sauce, I bought one of those packages which turned out really good.  The sauce really adds a lot to the flavor of the fritters.  I did not want to pull out my big fryer so I just made is a medium size sauce pan.  It uses less oil and I could still fit about 3 at a time. I will make these again.

They were just ok. Nothing to tell anyone about.  Not much taste.

Followed the recipe, and they were way too salty and flour-y (did not even taste like carrots).

Wow! We loved these. I was in a hurry & didn't even rest the batter-they still turned out delicious. The spices are really important or they will be bland. I didn't have hollandaise so we used Ranch dressing. My picky non-veggie eater ate several. Thanks!

These were awesome!  I have to admit I was a little skeptical about Carrot Fritters but after months and months of debating I made them and they are fantastic!   My oldest son almost ate half the batch.  He loved them. Thank you so much for a great recipe!

Schockingly delicious!  I used some of the variations below (garlic and onion powder in place of shallots, added some parmesan).  My husband wants me to make these once a week now!  I had leftover chicken gravy which worked great instead of bernaise.  I also made a quick Buffalo Blue Cheese dip which was equally tasty.  I was surprised by how thick the batter was, but it worked out perfectly.  A wonderful recipe!

Very nice, could possibly be improved with a little coriander.
