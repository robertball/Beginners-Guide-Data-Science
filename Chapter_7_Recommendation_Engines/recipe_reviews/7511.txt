If you are old enough to remember the "Pillsbury" Butter Brickle cake from the 70's, you know that this cake tastes nothing like it. The cake was dry and the icing too rich. Even with Heath bars crumbled up in the icing...it just didn't taste like the Butter Brickle cake I remembered when I was much younger.

This is GREAT!  I've made this several times for different occassions and its always a hit!  -I cut it into bite sized pieces and put them into little cupcake cups on a tray -that way none gets wasted b/c some people think its too sweet.  I've also ground up some hazlenuts and pecans and sprinkled them over the top when it is still warm.

It's a nice change from other cakes.  Not too sweet, kinda dense and crumbly though.  I was hoping for more of a moist cake.

This cake is absolutely delicious.  It was easy to make and turned out perfectly.  The texture was very soft and moist.  I would recommend this cake strongly to everyone, even if it's your first!

Good cake for something a little different.  I added 3oz cream cheese and toffee bits to the batter.  I baked mine as a bundt at 350 for 55 minutes.  Be sure to grease and flour the pan really well if you make the bundt, mine still stuck a little.

Well, there went the diet...  I couldn't stop eating this thing! Never had a Butter Brickle cake before. Thankfully, curiosity made me try it.  SOOO GOOD!!! I did add a bag of Heath Toffee bits to the batter (saved some for the glaze).  And for the glaze, I forgot to add in the evaporated milk, but it was still wonderful. (Halfway melted some of the toffee bits into the glaze, and then sprinkled some more toffee bits on the top, for aesthetics). **UPDATE:  These do not translate well into cupcakes**

I made this cake for my brothers birthday, with the Best Buttercream Frosting from this site also. Unbelivable!!! The cakes has great flavor and moist. For the frosting it went very well with the cake. I followed another review to beat the sugar and butter mix for 15 min. to break down the grain of the sugar what a difference. Its a Keeper!!!

Delicious!  Next time I'll add toffee bits to the batter and on top of the icing.  It was also pretty easy to make.

crushed Skor/Heath bars on top a MUST. I added half a bag of butterscotch chips to the batter which gave it more dimension. frosting had real nice flavor. served this   as a birthday cake at a small gathering and got rave reveiws! I baked it in a 12" round and it took way longer than 20 minutes. Will make again.

I wasn't very optimistic about trying new cakes off the internet, until I baked this cake.  Great crowd pleaser and a very welcomed change!

Very good recipe, very moist, and perfectly sweet.  I added 1/3 cup of cream cheese to the cake batter. I didn't use the glaze on the recipe, but used a chocolate frosting and topped with nuts.

I made this cake for my brother's birthday, but I didn't use the icing recipe included with the cake.  That might explain why the cake was not quite as moist as I would have liked.  Instead I used a buttercream frosting that I got from the website.  I will probably make the cake again but will go with the original icing.

It's very good and buttery. I used half a cup of milk and half buttemilk. I ended up having to bake it twice as long. I don't know if it's because of the buttmilk. Very good and rich cake.
