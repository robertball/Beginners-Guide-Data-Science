This turned out great and I just realized that I totally spaced the parsley which would have made it even better. After tasting it I thought it could use more pepper (the parsley I overlooked would have solved that) and I added some crushed pink peppercorn. So with that being said, this would be perfect as written!

This was really good. I usually donâ€™t like honey mustard dressing, but this was pretty yummy. My daughter that likes honey mustard tasted it, said it was really tasty, and asked if I had any left.
