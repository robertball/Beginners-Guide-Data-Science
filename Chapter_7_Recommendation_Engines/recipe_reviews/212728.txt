This recipe was fantastic! I added the cooked chicken to the pasta and sauce to mix it altogether just before serving. Don't skip on the basil it adds amazing fresh flavor. Next time I may add capers or artichokes!

very good! I used a KRAFT red pepper vinaigrette because i couldn't find the sun-dried tomato kind. I added extra veggies (red pepper zucchini) and cooked them in the dressing for a while to marinate them a bit. I also marinated the chicken in the dressing for a while too. Very good! will for sure save this recipe and make it again!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious! I'll be making this again but next time I may cut down on the amount of pasta. I like my pasta with a little bit more sauce but that's a personal preference. This one is definitely a keeper!

This recipe is very tasty. I was surprised by how much flavor the chicken had. It was very moist also. (Be sure to let it rest before slicing.) I sliced the chicken very thinly and we had leftovers for chicken salad the next day. The sauce is very rich and flavorful. The only downside is that my tomatoes were too tart. Next time I'll use halved cherry tomatoes on the vine. They are sweeter and have a better texture when cooked.

This was a great early spring way to enjoy tomato and basil pasta one of our summer favorites. Next time I'll add some garlic. I squeezed a bit of lemon juice on after my first bit for some extra tang. I recommend that.

We just made this recipe tonight and it was delicious! We did not have grape or cherry tomatoes but diced up a few Roma tomatoes. We also cut up zucchini and yellow squash to give it some extra color and sneak in veggies for our daughter. It was perfect and we look forward to making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

This is amazing this was the first meal my boyfriend made me and it was sooo good. Although we used regular cream cheese in place of the neufchatel cause we didnt know what that was and we used cherry tomatoes instead of grape and it was so much better. I really recommend trying it out!!!

Marinate and grill the chicken it is amazing! It adds a nice charred flavor. I always use fresh garlic in this recipe and somtimes I use the garlic phiadelphia cooking creme instead of regular cream cheese. You might want to double the sauce recipe too because you just can't get enough of it.

This was so good! I added some sauteed mushrooms a dash of red pepper flakes and crushed bacon to it. You'll probably want to double the amount of sauce. The sauce was a little thin but let it sit for 5 minutes and it will thicken perfectly. A!!

We all really enjoyed this even the picky teenagers. I used both chicken and shrimp. A definate keeper. The only changes were that I marinated the shrimp and chicken in the dressing for a few hours and used a couple cloves of pressed garlic.

This was very good! I used regular cream cheese and McCormic crushed basil. I think next time I would cut the tomatoes in half though. And I think I will take the suggestion of marinating the chicken in the dressing overnite before making the dish for more flavor in the chicken. But overall a good dish and I would make it again for sure.

Delicious and simple chicken and pasta dish. I used cream cheese instead of neufchatel not sure if there's a difference. Definitely use sun-dried tomato dressing if you can find it. I add dressing on the chicken when serving because the chicken breast is a little dry thanks to a terrible Polder food thermometer that is now in the trash. I'd also recommend pounding the chicken breast flat for even cooking.

I enjoyed this recipe. It was relatively simple and tasted great. I marinaded the chicken in the vinaigrette before cooking and I used diced canned tomatoes instead of fresh.

This was delicious I liked the tangy-ness. I didn't use fresh basil leaves just the fresh dried ones but other than that followed it to the letter and I would definitely make it again!

Super good. I used kraft Italian dressing and rotini. Modified the ingredients for 6 and had a great proportion of sauce to noodles. I also cut the tomatoes in half to insure they d break down a bit in the sauce. They did.

My family loves this recipe and we have been making it for a few years now. Last night I subbed in cream cheese which I often do because we have it on hand but I also used the entire 8 oz instead of 4. It was extra creamy and even more loved. Will be doing that again!

My husband and daughter loved it! I think I put a little too much cheese in it and I am not a "cheesy" person myself; so when the air hit it and it began to coagulate I couldn't bear the cheese sauce. The fam had no complaints at all!

This was amazing! I couldn't find the correct vinaigrette so I bought Olive Garden Red Wine Vinaigrette and added sun dried tomato pesto. Also marinated the chicken for a few hrs in the vinaigrette/pesto pan seared it sliced it and proceeded to cook in same vinaigrette dressing with sun dried tomato pesto. Great recipe!!

Twin 9 year olds had seconds and thirds!  They Want leftovers for school lunch.  I used velveeta, garlic parmesan, and added a tablespoon of butter at end.  Amazing how noodles sucked up the broth!  So very good -- a new, easy to make favorite!
