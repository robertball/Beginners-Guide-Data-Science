Very yummy, followed the recipe except that I used fresh jalapeño and it was the perfect amount of spice. Served it with rice and edimame.

I thought this sounded so good that I made it tonight, even though I didn't have some ingredients. It was great!! I didn't have sesame oil so used olive oil, and didn't have the pine nuts (which sounds yummy) but I followed the rest of the recipe. I did serve it with noodles and we loved it!

Nice mix of ingredients. Tasty. I used fresh jalapeño also. Pickled? It really helps to have most of the ingredients...though I'm all for tweeking them. Pine Nuts are good to have in your freezer, a bag goes a long way unless you're making pesto. Toast them, roast them...or use them raw, they are a nice texture and taste component. Sesame oil is even more critical for its specific taste...toasted Seasame would work too. It's so flavorful. Keep in mind it has a low smoke point, so don't over heat it. Not to mention using reduced fat PB and low salt Soy Sauce. A touch of Sriracha is another option. I would want more protein than listed, so I upped that a bit. Thighs would be good too. Also, I like a lot more PB than listed...even if I need to increase the other sauce ingredients.

This was great! I didn't have pine nuts so I just left out that part. Being as I LOVE peanut butter, I double or even tripled that. I served with rice and it was amazing!!!!

I'd give it 6 stars if I could! Love this recipe. I used a whole fresh jalapeño, diced, and sautéed it with the garlic and chicken. Instead of using water, I used low-fat milk. Made for a very creamy sauce.  Will have to make triple the sauce next time because it's to die for. Thanks for sharing!

We love this and make it pretty much all the time, whether or not we have leftover chicken. I use one dried cayenne pepper (that we dried ourselves from our garden) instead of jalapeno, because I just prefer the taste of cayenne to jalapeno. I also use a ton more peanut butter: I would say I use about a cup, but the cayenne makes up for the increase in sweetness. I also always use sesame oil - there's something about the depth that sesame oil adds. I have made this both with pine nuts and without. It's definitely better with the nuts, but it's still awesome without. Go easy on the soya sauce because it can overtake the other flavours easily. And finally, I love to serve this over a huge bed of spinach.

Quite good with a few modifications: add in brown sugar if using unsweetened peanut butter, change the jalapeño for spicy peppers (red Thai style), triple the peanut butter and double the soy. Taste as you go along to get your ideal balance of flavours.

I doubled the recipe to use some as a marinade (I grilled the chicken on skewers) and some as a dip. I used 1/4 cup total of the pine nuts, instead of the half cup for a double recipe, crushing them before adding them. I think peanuts would have worked well, too, to give it that bit of texture. I also added about a teaspoon of fresh thai basil. Husband ate it all up and I was really wishing I had made some rice noodles, for the sauce would have been wonderful on them.

Saw this while browsing for peanut butter sauces. Simple and quick. Using what i had on hand, I switched the pine nuts for cashews. Simmered peppercorn with garlic. Added green onions, mint leaves and cilantro at the end just before removing from heat. Thanks for this recipe.

It's amazing! I changed a few things: added onions, saffron and garlic to the chicken first. Served it with yellow rice and it was perfect!

I thought this was absolutely amazing. Shockingly, neither my husband nor son cared for it. I kept asking, them "but, WHY?" I guess that means next time I make it, I can keep it all to myself!!

Wonderful flavor. Like so many other reviewers, I didn't have pinenuts on hand. Neither did I have sesame oil or seeds. I ended up tripling the other ingredients, and to add a touch more spice, I sprinkled red pepper flakes. Served with stir fried veggies and jasmine rice. Was very good. I'll definitely make again.

Pretty good!  I made it with tofu instead of chicken.  The peanut/pine nut/tofu flavors go nicely together.  Instead of the pickled pepper, I subbed fresh chopped jalapeno and pickled ginger.  The sauce really needs the bit of sweetness from the pickled ingredients.   Added a shake more soy sauce , too.   DH liked it so I'll make it again.  Thanks!
