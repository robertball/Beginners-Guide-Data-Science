Very good.  I marinated fish for 6-7 hrs in garlic,olive oil cilantro and lime juice, then seared in olive oil, and added a lid to finish cooking. After removing the fish to a plate, I dumped the marinade into the fry pan, cooked for a few minutes with some additional lime juice, then stirred in the butter until melted. Fresh cilantro is a must in this recipe.

Delicious and easy!  My husband said this was his favorite thing I've ever made.  I used tilapia, as well, and added some capers to the saute pan.  Served with wild rice and baked sweet potato.  The flavors merged well!  I'll definitely make again.

This turned out better than I thought it might! I melted the butter in pan under the broiler added the garlic for a couple min. then put the halibut in and salted it and sqeezed fresh lime juice over and cilantro chopped. I had a small amount of halibut so I just used the ingredients here to give me the way to cook it. The flavor was good

I thought this lacked flavor. I think I should have subbed Old Bay for salt & maybe added some italian seasoning. I also think it needs more lime juice (I used fresh)...& it would probably  benefit from a quick marinade in a little olive oil w/ lime. This was quick & easy & required little prep though...thanks for lettng me try it.

This was a wonderful meal.  All of my picky eaters ate it.  I love the way the cilantro butter sauce tasted with the fish.  Will probably use it on shrimp too next time

I loved this dish mainly because I really love lime. I think any white fish will do.

This was so easy and quick. I think the general concensus was that it was a little heavy on the lime but perhaps that was because I didn't measure! I used Red Snapper instead of halibut and it was good. My kids complained about the cilantro - they thought it was spinach! So maybe I'd cut down on the amount of cilantro next time - more for presentation than taste though.

This was really really good.  I used mahi mahi instead of halibut.  I served this with the Baked Asparagus with Balsamic Butter Sauce from this site and also a side of lemon pasta.  It was a great meal!

This was super easy to make and even my picky teenager ate it! I used Tilapia rather than the halibut, and served it over fresh spinach.

This was a great meal idea! I used mahi mahi, and made the butter while the fish was on the grill.  I will try some different spices, as it could have used some more flavoring, but was an easy to make and quick meal with great taste!

I cut the recipe in half since the meal was just for my husband and me and I needed to add more liquid to give me enough to adequately cover the fish... so I added a little more butter, and even then I was cutting it tight. If I were to make this again, I'd use the recipe for 4 to serve just the two of us, since adding more butter altered the balance of flavor. I tasted the sauce before adding the extra butter, and I'd have preferred that blend to what I wound up with. The sauce is really great in the proportions of this recipe.

SO glad Hubs preferred to have a steak tonight, leaving this all to me!  I had him grill this for me on a cast iron skillet (alongside his steak) while I prepared the sauce indoors.  Outside of backing off on the cilantro just a wee bit, I followed the directions - and couldn't have been more in love with this!  I used halibut cheeks I brought home with me from Pike Place Market in Seattle - the best of the best. Good enough just on its own, the submitter is right on the money when she just so delicately enhances this beautiful fish with the flavors of lime, garlic and cilantro.

I made this last night and it was really easy and had fantastic flavour, it's a keeper.  I elected to bake the halibut at 400 for 15 minutes vice grilling.

This was amazing!  We doubled the lime juice and only used more olive oil and only 1/2 the butter and it was great.  Very easy and our guests loved it. I will definitely make it again!

Excellent!  Used a little more lime on the fish to give it more citrus flavor.  Also used double the butter.  Extremely easy and quick to make on a week night.

This is a great recipe. I used Orange Ruffy instead of Halibut. The fish was good the next day and the marinate kept well.

I will make this again as it was nice and light.  I used Haddock and think any white fish would work.  I did mine in a skillet as it was raining so we could not grill.

Loved it! Added just a smidge of white wine and maybe a tablespoon more butter because of that addition. First thing my husband said was "this is a keeper".....

I loved this!  I did marinate the fish for about an hour prior to grilling, however, in olive oil, cilantro and garlic.  I drained the marinade off and grilled.  Making a fresh batch of the sauce up to serve atop the fish.  I think this is my favorite summer way for halibut, for sure!

A very good way to prepare halibut. I followed the recipe as indicated, except I baked it at 400 degrees for 15 minutes (while Sean's Mommy's Roasted Root Vegetables [also on this site] were roasting). The cilantro butter sauce was especially tasty.

This was such a simple way of cooking halibut.  It took about 20 minutes, and it tasted great.  Even better, it used ingredients which were common to the household and readily available!- Jeff

Seriously GOOD - heaven in your mouth good! (Truth, marinate for 1-2 hours in a zip lock with olive oil, cilantro, garlic, and lime juice - then make your own cilantro garlic butter as described, baste with while grilling).  AMAZING!

This is meant to be a recipe that doesn't over-power or cover up the flavor of the fish. Halibut (when fresh) is buttery, succulent, delicate and delicious. Who would want to cover that up? So, no.. the flavors in this recipe are not assertive. If you find it to be bland, try seasoning the fish with your favorite fish rub first. We like the subtle flavors of the cilantro and the garlic in this recipe, so this is usually how I make my halibut. An alternative is to steam the fish directly in the sauce mixture. Cook it en papillote, if you will. Create packets out of foil or baking paper. Create a paste out of the garlic, butter, and olive oil. Brush it on the fish and season with salt, black pepper (or crushed red pepper), fresh lime juice, and chopped cilantro. Seal the packets and cook in a preheated oven for about 10 minutes depending on the thickness of your fish. The great thing about this is that everything will cook in the natural juices of the halibut. Let it rest for a few minutes and then serve directly in the packet. An alternative (or a way to up the flavor of the butter) is to create a compound butter with the above ingredients using very fresh cilantro, dill, and a bit of parsley. Hope this helps! Results will vary depending on the type of fish, but this should be good on any delicate white fish

Really delicious!  My husband and I enjoyed this very much tonight.  Easy although a fair amount of chopping to make enough cilantro to use.  We both loved it and will definitely enjoy it again when the halibut looks delicious.  Try it.....

This is one of our favorite recipes.  Very easy to prepare and the combination of cilantro and garlic make this dish succulent.  We've actually cooked this with Halibut and with Tilapia and it turned out great for both.  I finally got a grilling platter for my gas grill and it makes it 100 times easier to cook the fish on the grill.

Made a cilantro lime butter to put on top so you could add a little or a lot. Seasoned fish with a little Johnny's seafood seasoning. Ate it next day for lunch it was good!

My husband and I loved this! I am crazy about cilantro and lime, so this was very satisfying as a topping for the halibut! I added a little olive oil and old bay to the lime on the fish. It was very yummy! Will definitely make this again! Thanks!

I normally don't like fish, but this recipe may get me to eat fish on a regular basis!  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  I grilled the fish inside aluminum foil which helped keep it very moist.

We thought the flavor was a wee bit too subtle for our taste, followed exactly as directed. Could have benefitted from more seasoning? Or possibly would have been improved via longer marinating time?

I loved the flavor of this. It's now my go to recipe when we have the freezer filled with Halibut. I didn't grill it, but pan fried and then moved it to the oven to finish, was so yummy with the butter to dip it in!

This was delicious, and the fish was like butter. We did add a little salt and pepper at the table, and I might try seasoning with red pepper before cooking. But, overall, fantastic.

My husband flipped over this one. He likes my cooking, but loved this dish. I did marinate the fish for a while in a couple of tablespoons of fresh, chopped cilantro, some olive oil, and crushed, dried Persian limes (didn't have any fresh limes) and skipped the lime juice. Served with a red cabbage slaw made with thinly sliced cabbage, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, 1/4 grated onion. It went well with the fish.

This recipe was good, fast, and easy.  I don't eat a whole lot of fish because I find the flavor too overwhelming (except salmon).  My husband thought the lime and cilantro really helped cover the fishy flavor.  It was a good recipe, but I wasn't blown away by it.

made this with snapper.  the fish needed a little more seasoning than just the lime juice.  Used a little old bay.  The cilantro-garlic butter was outstanding and will use it on other grilled fish and shrimp.  yum!

I don't personally eat fish but my hubby brought back Halibut from Alaska so I cooked it for guests and they loved this recipe!  Didn't change a thing.  The Cilantro Butter was a hit.  Thanks!

This was alright. I think that it works as a quick dish. There wasn't that much flavor. I will be using a garlic lemon and salt marinate next time, and forgoing this recipe altogether...

This is the first fish dish I have ever made -- EVER.  I'm not much of a fish-eater either (Dad was severely allergic to fish so I never had it growing up and frankly, it sort of scared me to eat it).  Fortunately for me, I got over my trepidation and now enjoy many different types of firm, white fish.  I saw this recipe and decided to try it.  Fresh halibut is expensive here ($25/lb and up) but with just two of us I decided to splurge to see if I liked it and if I could prepare it properly.  I marinated the fish with evoo, garlic, cilantro and lime juice for about 4 hours in the fridge and then followed the recipe, grilling the fillets exactly as written.  I was amazed at how flaky, moist and mouth-waterlingly delicious the fish turned out.  The recipe is a definite keeper - thanks very much Serena.

This recipe is perfect for a nice thick piece of halibut. The sauce adds a very nice flavour to the fish. I used parsley instead of cilantro as that is all I had.

Delicious. My only advice is to wait to cook the sauce until the fish is nearly cooked.  I slightly overcooked it while waiting for the fish to cook.

The sauce is amazing! This recipe has a great overall flavor, and tastes great when grilled directly on the grill. It needed only 4 min. on each side with our propane grill on high - 5 min. would have been too long. Very tender and moist halibut!  :o)

Really yummy! I read another review that said they wished they had used Old Bay seasoning, so I did. It was great! We love cilantro and the lime and garlic were very subtle.The Old Bay added just the right spice. We'll be doing this again and again! Thanks for a really simple and fresh recipe for halibut!

I took some hints from other reviewers and marinated this in olive oil, lime juice, and salt and pepper for a few hours before hand, and it turned out with a lovely subtle flavour. My boyfriend hates cilantro, and he finished this, went back for seconds, and said he loved it. Granted, that was before he knew what was in it... ;)

My husband catches fresh halibut each year up in Alaska so we have tons of it in our freezer and I wanted to try this recipe.  This recipe is so easy, the flavors of the garlic, lime and cilantro are really good! And they taste great with the halibut.  If you like cilantro, that is.  Could maybe use parsley instead of cilantro but may not come out with the same taste...?

This was absolutely delicious! I marinated the fish for about 6 hours in a lime juice/olive oil/garlic mixture before grilling...it came out full of flavor :)

Simply delicous! I will make my white fish this way from now on. So easy and I felt like I was eating something very healthy. I did use Talapia. I put the fish on a piece of foil so clean up was easy too! I also cooked the sauce outside on the grill. Thanks for sharing.

The only thing I did differently was to marinade the halibut in the lime juice, salt and pepper for 4 hours. Great flavor. This would work really well with chicken too. Thanks!

I substituted tilapia for the halibut and used lime juice from a jar as well as parsley instead of cilantro. My husband liked it so I will make it again. I have added a picture of the dish as I served it with peas and a baked potato.

This sauce is the perfect compliment to halibut!  So many sauces overpower the delicate flavor of halibut, but not this one.  The only change I made was to substitute parsley for the cilantro, as that is what I have on hand.  I know it will be even better with cilantro, but parsley worked great, too.  I've been looking for a "go to" recipe for halibut, and after trying many, this one is it!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Excellent! Easy to make, and the cilantro-lime garlic butter is the perfect addition of flavors to the mild halibut. My son said it tasted like "fine restaurant" cuisine!

A nice change from the Heavenly Halibut receipe on this website which we also like.   Both are exceptionally easy.  This one is a great use of fresh cilantro.

I almost didn't try this recipe because I thought halibut deserved something more complex, but I ran short on time and gave it a whirl. It was AWESOME and perfect. Cooked the halibut on the grill over hardwood charcoal following the recipe (unusual for me!). I made it for two but still used the full amount of garlic (we LOVE garlic) with the butter and cilantro. This recipe is definitely a keeper! If you like this one, try Accidental Fish from Allrecipes. It's another recipe that seems too simple/basic but is easy to make and a great combo of flavors.

Very good recipe. I am not a cilantro lover so I left it out. I substituted Penzey's Mural of Flavor seasoning as a rub applied to both sides followed with squirts of lime juice before putting it on the grill. Grilled on high heat for 5 minutes, flipped, then grilled them on medium heat for 6 minutes. I used a mixture inspired by this recipe of lime juice, butter, virgin olive oil, dried garlic, and garlic salt as a drizzling sauce. Delicious!

This recipe is awesome.  The Garlic really brings the X factor.  Lime on any white fish? Hellz yea.   We did on the grill with the fish tossed in olive oil, salt n pepper before put on the grill.  Served with grilled peppers  also tossed in oil, salt n pepper then grilled as well.  The sauce really topped off every bite.

Delicious. Simple, delicate. I had no lime so used lemon. It was fabulous.  I'm sure lime is great also. I also brushed with a little melted butter before cooking. Had fillets that were only about 2/3 inch and cut time to 8 minutes but should probably cut to 6-7 minutes. Consider searing 1 minute and then over low heat.

Made with Tilapia. Served with broccoli and a Cilantro Lime Quinoa. -Quinoa cooked in chicken broth, and when done, toss in cilantro, garlic, salt, and lime juice. -  (Had a lot of cilantro I had to harvest from our garden!) There was a lotof green on our plate, but I wasn't worried about presentation, since it was just for us and the kids. :)
 Kids and Husband loved it .

I added another tbs lime juice to the sauce, but otherwise kept it pretty much the same. I wasn't overly impressed with the recipe but my better half said it was one of the best fish meals he's ever eaten, and we eat quite a bit of fish. We'll make this again since but I'll probably play with it a bit  :-)

Excellent.  The cilantro doesn't overpower the halibut and creates a superb flavor.  Our kids eat it, too.  I went with the recommendations and marinated it for 2-3 hours ahead of time in olive oil and lime juice.

I eat a lot of fish so I am always on the hunt for a good, simple recipe. This was a keeper, even my husband who isn't really a fish guy and hates cilantro (he calls it the soap plant) liked this one. I used Albacore fillets instead but would make it for just about any fish. I also always use more garlic than called for in any recipe.

I made this as written and my husband and I both thought that it needed more sauce and that the sauce was pretty bland.  The fish was ready so I had no time to fuss with the sauce; perhaps a little more garlic and some old bay seasoning would have done it for us.  It certainly gets points for being a quick meal!

I was really hoping for much more...my husband and I found the flavor to be a bit boring and would prefer our white fish prepared other ways.

This was pretty boring.  There are plenty of other healthy fish recipes out there that are a lot tastier.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't great.

Very good.  Couldn't find Halibut to cook with at my grocery store (fresh at least) so I substituted for Cod.  It made a tough fish very yummy.  Even my picky boyfriend loved it.

Tasteless, which was suprising as I love cilantro, lime and garlic. I cooked the fish in a covered frypan with a little olive oil, salt, pepper and crushed garlic with lime squeezed over the fish then continued with the recipe as written. Fish was moist and tender but tastless.  Too bad I had high hopes for this recipe.

I loved this! I made it with salmon and let it soak in lime juice, s&p, and chili lime seasoning for 30 mins. I then put it under the broiler till golden. When making the sauce i added the leftover marinade and it was so good there was no leftovers. YUM!

This was really good! the only thing I changed was I added seasoned salt. I served it over steamed rice.  I also made extra cilantro butter sauce for the rice! and to balance the flavors I added a few raisins to the rice too.  Thank you.

This recipe was soooo easy and my husband and I love love LOVED it!! It's the simple recipes that let the fresh flavours shine through and are definitely the best. I would cut down your prep time though, it was a maximum of 10 mins. I'm totally going to remember this for summer cause it's a wonderful fresh, light, dish. Also I added a dash of ground cumin to the fish before grilling and it was superb. Thanx!

The first time I made this I used Tilapia which was delicious and the second time I used halibut. They were both delicious and super easy to make. Everyone raved about how good it was. This has become a staple in our recipe book!

Delicious flavors! I felt the sauce needed more "wetness" so added quite a bit more butter, lime juice, and a bit more olive oil, too. The coarsely chopped garlic was a great touch. Definitely put the sauce together in the pan that the fish cooked in because that adds a lot of great flavor.

There are only two of us and I only had a small piece of halibut.  So I salted and peppered the fish and  sautéed it in the olive butter  adding the garlic when turning. I squeezed the lime juice over at this time. Browned beautifully on both sides.  My husband doesn’t normally eat seafood but declared this dish excellent.

Have made this a couple times, once with dried cilantro, the  second with fresh - fresh makes a big difference!  Will most likely not use all the lime juice next time, it was a little too much for my taste.  Served with risotto rice, delicious.

This recipe is excellent. Now, for those saying that it is bland here are my recommendations: Adjust the salt and pepper when preparing the butter. Add a bit of minced onion along with the garlic and cook it as directed. When you add the cilantro, add the juice of one extra lemon. Mine was "bland" because I used unsalted butter. My basic change was to add extra of mainly the ingredients that make this recipe. This,  made all the difference without altering the recipe drastically.

I made this pretty much as written.  Grilled the halibut on my Big Green Egg at about 400 degrees and used apple wood to smoke it.  Marinated in lime juice for a couple of hours prior to grilling.  Cooked fish to about 135 degrees internal temperature.  With the cilantro butter, it was fantastic.

This is a decent enough fish recipe. I’m always looking out for new fish recipes. I did use salmon instead of halibut because I had some to be eaten. I followed the advice of one reviewer and marinated the fish in the mixture for a few hours, cooked the salmon and then the mixture and added butter.  I think next time I will do it as the recipe calls for and grill the fish instead of frying. I’d like to see if there is a difference. Other than that it’s very easy to assemble and quick cooking.

When I first told my husband, “let’s make this for dinner”, he said “no” too much work, I assured him it was quick and easy!  He gave in, did it all and after he took his first bite, he said, “I am so happy that you told me to do this, it is delicious, absolutely fantastic!”  Thank you!

Very simple yet delicious recipe. If you have a good, fresh piece of fish,  the less you donto it , the better! I pan seared it in butter & coconut oil. The next time I make it I will marinate the fish in lime juice and some of the garlic, cilantro butter.
But it’s excellent as is!

I sautéed zucchini slices in the garlic butter and poured that over the fish. Had couscous alongside. Delicious and very light.

Tasty and easy recipe. I followed recipe exactly except my fish was Haddock and I loved the flavour. Cilantro is a different flavour that we have learned to love, most likely from my favourite appetizer in Florida.......Ceviche!! Thanks for the recipe.

Quite tasty. I was too scared to do the halibut directly on the grill, so I used a cage, which worked well.

I agree with other reviewers who had to tweak the recipe by adding capers, more olive oil , lime juice or butter.  I followed the recipe given but wish I had made all the sauce for 2 fillets and marinated the fish a long time before grilling it. It lacked flavor but was speedy to prepare.  I used a grill pan.

Yummy and so easy.  Only had cod and I did add a tablespoon of capers, but other than that, I made it according to the recipe.  My hubby loved it.  Will make it again, especially when needing a quick recipe.  Served it with lime basmati rice and a green salad.

Awesome recipe.  Easy to make and very flavorful.  Added chopped green onion with the garlic to the sauce mix.  We are going to try this sauce with chicken and beef as well.

This is a great recipe. I took the advice of a few reviewers and marinated the halibut without changing anything else. I got my pan screaming hot, seared the fish nicely, lowered the heat and finished cooking. I used the remaining marinade for the sauce and added butter (smart balance) to the pan I used for the fish. The sauce was awesome, super concentrated and delicious.  Fresh cilantro is a must. I served with couscous and roasted veggies for a superb dinner that my hubby and I were very pleased with.  Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe for fish. This one is definitely a keeper for us.

Definitely a great way to cook Halibut. I added dill seasoning just to see if it made a difference. I couldn't really taste it though.  This is now my go to Halibut recipe.

Sauce is soooo good!!!!  I accidentally crisped the garlic, but it ended up being so delicious, and added a little crunch. Will definitely make again.

I made this exactly as directed and it was very bland, although it has potential.  Much more lime and garlic is needed, perhaps even marinating it for a half hour or so.  I cooked it on the grill wrapped in foil, so maybe just grilled open and spread the butter on it.  It's worth a try.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, I just substituted Sea Bass for Halibut because Halibut is outrageously expensive here. We all found this bland and uninteresting. Which was too bad, because I had high expectations.

Pretty much anything with Cilantro and Lime is a winner in my book.  I used Tilapia (baked @ 400 for 15 minutes).  The sauce was GREAT - IF you drained off the excess liquid. Was this an error on my part or is it supposed to be this way?  I liked it a lot better with just the "solid" bits of the sauce piled on top of the fish.

I really liked this preparation, but my wife doesn't like cilantro.  I'd like a suggestion for a substitute herb for cilantro.  As you can tell, I'm no chef, but I like to experiment.  Creighton

I was lucky enough to have freshly caught halibut from my neighbor so this recipe was perfect! I did not change a thing except that I used a grill pan and it was delightful!! Served over greens with tomatoes, avocados and vinegarette and warm artisan bread. Yummmm!

This was excellent! My husband said this was the best dish I have ever made. I served the halibut over rice pilaf and it just soaks that yummy sauce up!

This halibut recipe is delicious.   Add the ease of preparation, the short time it takes to prepare, and you can file it under "Winners."  It was worth the risk of the expensive halibut to try this new dish.   The flavor of the cilantro and lime paired perfectly with the fish; I am going to use the "sauce" with shrimp next time I make my beer-steamed shrimp recipe, will use it for the dipping sauce.   Jan

Good recipe.  I only have an indoor grill and the halibut did not cook well on it.  I think I might make the halibut with some olive oil in a saucepan next time.  Sauce was good, very light.

Made this two nights in row now - both nights used tilapia instead of halibut. Night one I grilled it and night two I baked it in the oven. Both times the fish was a little dry (which I guess I have to put all on me!) but the flavor was good. Add that to the easy recipe and I say it's worth a try, especially for a quick and healthy meal!

Restaurant quality dinner.  This was easy to prepare and tasted fantastic - we bought Halibut from Costco and the quality was top notch.  This recipe is a keeper!!

Excellent! I really love the flavors of the butter sauce. I might go a bit lighter on the lime juice. I think the lime juice on the halibut was enough. Great recipe, thank you!

Lovely, it looked great, it was very easy to make and the flavor of the cilantro butter and garlic really complemented the mild fish.  I made this for my family and everyone was very impressed, we were going to go out to eat for my Mom's birthday but she said we couldn't have gotten anything better at a restaraunt!

I used flounder instead of halibut since it's so hard to find in these parts.  Maybe that's why it was just ok.

This was pretty good.  We enjoyed it but I am unsure if I will make this again.
