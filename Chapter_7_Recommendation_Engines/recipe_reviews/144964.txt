I LOVE Brushetta so when I saw this recipe on this website, this was a must try for me. My husband and I live in Germany, so food selection at the commissary is sometimes limited, therefore, I substituted the Roased Red Pepper Italian dressing in this recipe. Also insted of grilling (it was cold and rainy outside), I cooked the marinated chicken breasts on the stovetop skillet, then placed the breasts in a baking dish, covered them with the bruschetta and a little extra cheese, and broiled them in the oven for about 10 minutes. Not only was this recipe DELISHIOUS, it looked as good as it tasted, and was a huge hit with the hubby!  He insists I make it again!

YUM!! For such a simple recipe it sure turned out well! I did not grill, as it was cold outside, but cooked them in a skillet with a little extra dressing. I added a clove of fresh garlic to the cheese/tomato mixture and then broiled until melted. Delicious and easy!

One of the best easy chicken recipes that I have used.  I used roma tomato vinaigrette and added a little garlic and Balsamic vinegar to it.  It helped that we used fresh tomatoes from our garden.  Really good.

I used this overall concept and made the chicken in the oven, so we don't have a grill. I made bruscetta, put some salt and pepper on the chicken, put the bruscetta over the chicken, and then baked it. I then sprinkled some mozzerella cheese on it and put it back in the oven another 5 minutes to melt it. It was great.

This was simple yet flavorful. My husband was upset I only made two servings instead of my usual three and couldn't take it for lunch the next day. Next time he's asked for a nice crusty bread/garlic bread to match it. He even liked the buttered egg noodles I served with it with some extra bruschetta mixture to make a "sauce" for them.

This was DE-LISH! I just made this today and of course had to read all of the reviews first and then put my own twist on things. I could not find the dressing, so I used another brand that was a Sun-Dried Tomato Roasted Red Pepper Vinaigrette Dressing. Definitely marinate for more than 10 mins! I marinated for about 3 hours and that was plenty. I didn't measure anything and just piled on the goods! I used Roma tomatoes, so they wouldn't be so juicy. I did take a pic, and will get that uploaded if it looks okay. I didn't get too fancy, just a close up as my hubby had just taken them off the grill. This is a beautiful delicious dish suitable for a party or whatever your occasion may be! Thanks for sharing!

Fabulous recipe!  Yum yum! First time I made it I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used canned diced tomates, and I had a cheddar/mozz mix cheese.  2nd time I followed the recipe using fresh tomatoes but the canned actually held the mixture together better.  My hubby & bro liked it better the first time (with the canned).  I recommend marinated overnight, and adding extra spices like garlic powder and whatever else you like.

Really good and easy recipe. I didn't have fresh basil, but the dried stuff works just as well. I recommend 3 roma tomatoes and then just even out the cheese to find a good ratio. I as well used the George Foreman grill to grill the chicken, then put the mixture on top of the chicken in a baking dish and baked  for 5 minutes just to warm the topping. I made some pasta on the side and had extra topping so put in over the pasta which was nice as well. Very good, will make again!

Fiance loves bruschetta, so this made the perfect meal.  Didn't have the dressing, so marinaded with Italian dressing mixed with chopped sundried tomatoes. Served with garlic breadsticks and garden salad.  A big hit!

This was wonderful!  My husband who does NOT eat tomatoes, raved about it! I made everything inside since I noticed to late the we were out of propane. I threw the chicken in a dish, dumped on enough of the dressing to cover it, and let it sit in the fridge for about 30 or so minutes. I then cooked it on the stove top on a indoor griddle on high heat to get the nice lines, then once it was cooked on both sides transferred it into the oven with the cheese and other toppings, and let it warm though while the garlic bread finished. We had angel hair pasta and broccoli to go with it. Needless to say, no left overs at all!  All three kids from ages 2-7 ate it all

This was absolutely delicious - not the overpowering flavor you get marinating with some Italian dressings. I used fresh tomatoes and basil from my garden and toasted some thin slices of crusty bread to hold the extra tomato mixture. This was very quick and easy to make - a keeper!

I had made bruschetta the night before and used the leftovers on the chicken that I had marinated and grilled. Topped it with a little mozzerella cheese. Never thought of this until I saw this recipe. Thanks.

This was a very flavorful and fresh dish.  I marinated the chicken breasts for a few hours and then grilled them on my "George Foreman" grill.  Then broiled in the oven until the cheese melted.  Be sure to use really good tomatoes, since that is where a lot of the flavor will be coming from.

This was awesome. Very simple and quick to put together. I marinated the breasts overnight in Paul Newman's sundried tomato dressing and used dried basil as I didn't have fresh. I cooked them in a nonstick skillet on the stove and finished them in the oven. My husband doesn't usually care for white meat, but these were very moist. I'm thinking that marinating them for 24 hours helped there.

We loved this recipe!  It was light and realtively healthy.  I marinated much longer than suggested and ran out of mozzarella so I used feta which was delicious.  I can't wait to make this again.

I made for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. Everyone loved it. And I even had to pass the recipe on to the people at the party. I will make this again. I made a little extra of the tomato mixure and put over the noodles.

YUM YUM YUM.... This was soooooo good. Marinated chicken in Safeway Selects Tuscan Style Basil and Herb dressing for about 3 hours. Added a bit of fresh minced garlic to tomato mixture. LOVED THIS. My husband gave it a thumbs up and said it was restaurant quality good. This is a keep for sure.

I thought this was pretty good! The Bruschetta was wonderful! The chicken was a little bit dry. (Couldn't grill, had to use the stove top) The flavor was really there, I just made me want to put the tomato mixture on some crunchy bread! Will probably make again. (Would defiantly make the mixture and put it on crunchy Italian bread as an appetizer!)

This is a great recipe! I made a few changes, but didn't stray too far off the original recipe. I used Wish-Bone's Bruschetta Italian Salad Dressing and marinated the chicken breasts for 6 hours. Then I used two roma tomatoes, added 2 tablespoons finely diced red onion, some garlic, 1/2 teaspoon dried basil since I didn't have fresh, mozzarella cheese, and salt and pepper to taste. I got grill marks on both sides of the chicken and then put on the foil with the tomato topping. My husband declared this one of his new favorite chicken recipes! I will be making this again and again.

What a great recipe! I have made it several times now. My husband, who does not like "the white meat" loved this. I used already prepared bruschetta from Sam's Club to top the chicken breasts....so easy and so good! One time I even forgot the cheese and it was still delicious.

I was a vegetarian for 10 years and have never really gotten fond of cooking meat but this recipe was SO EASY and so good. My friends all make fun of me because I'm so uncomfortable cooking chicken but this was fine even for me. And everyone LOVED it. It was easy, fast, and felt special to eat. I didn't grill it outside, though, I cooked it in the skillet and then broiled it like another reviewer suggested. Thanks!

I have been looking for something like this for some time.  Back when I was a working woman, I used to order a fabulous Chicken Bruschetta Quesadilla almost everyday for lunch from a local dining spot.  Seriously, try this recipe laid on top of a cheese quesadilla - so good!  The bruschetta, quesadilla and warm chicken compliment each other perfectly!

My husband loved this. He gave this 5 stars so it must be true. He is usually harsh with the ratings. I made this on an indoor grill pan. Had to finish it off in the broiler though. Will def make this again. So so so yummy. Would be wonderful in the summer.

Easy to do,and beautiful to look at too.  My meat-eating husband says it's a five star. The tomato mixture can get vey watery, so use a slotted spoon to put it on top of the chicken. Decorate with whole basil leaves, and it is a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach.

No question a fan favorite at my house. Marinated the chicken in Italian salad dressing for several hours then cooked on grill. Used storebought bruschetta (Wegmans makes it great), mixed with some grated parmesan cheese and topped with fresh mozzarella.  Popped in oven on 425 for about 10-15 minutes to brown cheese and heat tomatoes.  Can't wait to make again.

Excellent! My whole family loved it. I used the George Foreman Grill as it is freezing here in MI. I topped the checken and then put it in the oven for about 5-10 minutes on 425 degrees to melt the cheese and warm the tomatoes. I served this with garlic bread and gnocchi topped with a homemade tomato sauce put together with the extra tomatoes, basil and some fresh garlic simmered while everything else was cooking. Very healthy and delicious!!!

We really enjoyed this dish - my husband probably slightly moreso than myself.  I thought using the dressing as a marinade was wonderful.  I opted to melt the cheese on the chicken and then topping it later with the bruschetta mix.  I thought the dressing was a bit much in the dressing, but it's my husband's favorite dressing anyway, so it was a hit!  I added it to my "Weekday Meals" folder.

I found this recipe on here years ago and still make it regularly.  Everyone who ever tries it loves it.  If you don't have time to grill, or don't own a grill, just do it in the oven.  Very good both ways.

I think this is a great recipe, even though I made a couple of changes to it. Personally, I think any Italian dressing would work as a marinade. Also, to the tomato mixture I added: extra virgin olive oil, vinegar, and some salt & pepper. Most definitely a keeper for our family. Thank you!

Definitely agree that the chicken should be marinated overnight! Tried it the original way and it came out pretty flavorless, but then again, I did not grill it. The method of cooking from the skillet to the stove totally works- the chicken comes out really succulent. My bf couldn't stop ranting about it. It will definitely be a bi-weekly, if not weekly, dish in my house.

I made this just last night and it was excellent! The only problem is, the Sun-Dried Tomato Vinaigrette Dressing is on Re-Call!!! I had to ask someone at the store because I could not find it and she said the pulled it from the shelves!! So I tried Kraft Roasted Red Pepper Vinaigrette and it worked as well! Just an FYI!!! Thanks!!

I have made this recipe several times, altering it to my taste.  I use a mixed Italian cheese blend instead of straight Mozz, and make a balsamic reduction to mix in with the tomatoes, basil, and cheese.  I serve it with garlic parmesan seasoned cous cous and it is delicious!!!

Very simple and very tasty. I left the chicken in the dressing for a couple of hours before grilling and I think this helps quite a bit — a lot more flavor!

This was excellent. Didn't have fresh basil, but will definitely use the next time. I just can't imagine this being any better. Served with buttered noodles. I marinated for about 30 minutes, but will marinate overnight.  I also added minced garlic and the cheese to topping. Next time will add sauteed mushrooms and parmasean cheese. Can't wait!

While it was enjoyable as is, feedback from my diners determined "something's missing..." I plan on making again & seasoning the chicken w/ garlic powder & using regular mozzarella (not low fat, which was a bit rubbery out of the oven).

This would also make a good sandwich! Can't wait to try it on pasta! Update: Had this on thin spaghetti with mozzerella cheese and a Parmesan, Romano, Asiago sprinkle mix. I made a light sauce with some of the bruschetta- I simmered it in white wine and olive oil. We garnished it with black olives and it was SO good!!

This is fantastic! I could not locate the Kraft dressing. The closest I came to it was a Safeway brand Tuscan Italian Dressing. This was so tasty and so easy. I made it on my little tabletop grill. I served to my MIL who used to have her own cooking show and she loved it. I served it with spaghetti and the Strawberry Spinach Salad I recipe from here. I will add that the dressing (with my minor alteration) from the spinach salad also tasted wonderful with this chicken.

Awesome! I couldn't find the dressing so I heated up 1/2 finely diced vine tomato, 1/2 tsp prepared mustard, 1 small clove finely minced garlic, 1 tsp finely minced red pepper, 2 tablespoons olive oil, onion powder, 1 tablespoon vinegar, a pinch of mozzarella, and a dash of Parmesan. It was so delicious and really complimented the fabulous recipe! I have made this dish for my husband once a week for the past month or so!

My husband (who doesn't like tomatoes) LOVED this recipe!!  I've made it twice in the past 2 weeks!  I used a little more cheese while grilling and made extra of the Bruschetta.  With the remaining Bruschetta I added a some of the sun-dried tomatoe dressing to it and YUM-O! Put it on some bread chips or crackers and its perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!  Simple and delicious!  (Oh and I marinated overnight as well)

This was sooooo delicious! I love bruschetta so I knew I had to try this recipe. I'm so glad I did. I just bought the George Foreman grill so I thought this was the perfect recipe to try it on it. I pounded the chicken and marinated it in a ziplock bag for about 4 hours. I poured the cheese on top of the tomato mixture instead of mixing it in. I couldn't find the Kraft brand dressing, so we used another brand and it was delicious. Very tasty and tender!

This was DELICIOUS!  Very easy to make and flavorful!  I marinated for 10 minutes,since I was crunched for time, but it was great.  I used fresh basil, shredded mozzarella, and cut up grape tomatoes.  I used my George Foreman grill until done, then baked at 350 for 10 minutes to melt cheese and warm tomatoes.  My kitchen smelled like an Italian restaurant!  This recipe is a keeper for sure.

We love this.  We don't grill the bruschetta mix on the chicken, simply serve it chilled over the cooked meat and noodles.  It's even very good the next day, cold, like a chicken-pasta salad!

Awesome!  Family loved this! Used red pepper instead of tomatoes.

Love this recipe...I think the only thing I will change the next time is to marinate the chicken longer and make extra topping! Will also try the tomato mixture on bread...delicious!!!

I personally haven't gotten to try this yet, but I made it for my parents and they absolutely loved it! A great healthy way to serve flavorful chicken...I have some left over still and think I might try serving it with some salad, for a healthy light lunch!
