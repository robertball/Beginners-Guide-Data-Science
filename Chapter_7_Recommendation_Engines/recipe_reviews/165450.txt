We love feta cheese so enjoyed this dip..definitely needs something more tho, and I think green onion and pepper is the answer.

We made this as part of our Christmas around the world dinner. It was wonderful! I double the feta and its one of our favorite dips.

This recipe is very tasty and extremely versatile.  Add more or less of the ingredients to suit your taste and it will still be fabulous!!
I serve it with Organic Wheat Thin crackers or tortilla chips.  It's even good as a spread in place of cream cheese.  Fair warning though, the garlic is strong, so adjust to your palette!

I'm glad I only made a half recipe of this as a test because I wasn't particularly fond of it.  Maybe it's partly because I'm too familiar with the seasonings in traditional guacamole that this fell short in flavor for me.  Also, the amount of lime juice was probably at least twice what I'd be comfortable with.  Finally, the feta was an unusual addition that I didn't care for in either appearance or taste.  I served this with "Fresh Tortilla Triangles," also from this site.

Great recipe, however, it looked a little bland so I simply added green onions and some salt and pepper.  The dip turned out great and was very easy.  Thank you Sheila!

Was looking for a different type of avocado dip to have for lunch today and this really did it for me. I did use lemon juice instead of the lime and added in a bit of onion powder and cayenne for some kick. Delicious Islandgurl and thank you!

this was good, and my guests asked for the recipe the next day. It is a nice alternative for when I am craving avocoado but I want something slightly different than traditional guacamole.

Good, but a bit bland.  I halved the recipe and paid attention to a review that said the garlic was a bit strong, so I just added a little garlic.  It wasn't enough garlic for me, so I added more.  I think it could use a bit of seasoning--salt, pepper, maybe a few other spices.  But it's good, quick, and easy.  Would be easy to doctor up too.  Thanks!

My husband loves this on everything, especially cheesy bread or cornbread. He makes a 'mean' guacamole so this is right up his alley.

Wonderful! I made this as an appetizer followed by a vegetarian moussaka (used Morning Star ground beef), and my Greek guests said that the meal actually felt authentically Greek.

Fantastic! Don't put feta in until everything else is done.

This recipe is totally spectacular.  It's quick, easy and a real hit with family and friends.  I served it with tortilla chips and wished I had made more as everyone loved it and it ran out fast.  I passed the recipe on to all my friends.
