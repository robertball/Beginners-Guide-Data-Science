These were very good. I added some pepper sauce to make them hot. My husband loved them.

I used Vlasic Snackâ€™umm kosher dill bites. they are cut thicker and not complete rounds so they are perfect to absorb this and be a nice bite. To make sure the sugar dissolved, I drained the pickles into a measuring cup then put them back in the jar. I dissolved the sugar and juice in a sauce pan and cooked it like a simple syrup. I cooled it and poured it over the pickles in the jar and added Apple cider vinegar to cover. I took 2 jars to a picnic 8 days later. I had two plastic storage bowls, one slightly smaller, and had put water halfway up the larger and floated the smaller and set that in the freezer. I drained the pickles and put them in the smaller so they had an ice base at the picnic with Toothpicks handy. They were gone. Note, the frozen bowl sweated with condensation so I should have put something absorbent under it like napkins or tea towel.

I personally do not care for sweet pickles but wanted to make these for my husband so I chose to half the recipe. He gave me the thumbs up but said the could have used just a little bit less sugar.
