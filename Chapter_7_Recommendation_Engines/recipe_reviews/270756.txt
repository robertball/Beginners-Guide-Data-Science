Comfort food. Don't expect a lot of flavor. I didn't want 8 servings for the two of us so I made 1/2 the recipe. I added 1/2 tsp. of my homemade cajun seasoning for half the recipe; it could have used more. Not sure if I'll make it again.

Easy to prepare, full of flavor and made rice balls out of left over stuffing that was delicious as well.  Will definitely make this again.
