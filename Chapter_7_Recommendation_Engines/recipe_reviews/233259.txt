I thought this was pretty darned good and was particularly impressed with the marinade for the shrimp.  I found the steak a little bland, however, and it wasn't until my wife pointed out that I was to have seasoned it with steak seasoning that I realized I had not done that, so don't forget the steak seasoning! I made this on the Cuisinart Griddler en brochette, the steak and shrimp each on separate skewers because of different cooking times. We served them with "Bahamian Style Peas and Rice," the recipe also from this site.

I followed the recipe exactly as written except for the steaks. I used NY strips in place of the filet mignons. The shrimp marinade was absolutely perfect. The shrimp was the star of this 5 star meal. Thank you Staci.

I made the Surf, but not the Turf.  I needed some grilled shrimp for another recipe, used the marinade for this one, and it turned out fantastic.  Definitely will be using this in the future for grilling shrimp, it was delicious!

Made this last evening and it was great! The steak recipe is pretty basic, but really with a good steak that's all you need. The shrimp seasoning was delicious, we plan to make it again soon - we did not make enough for left overs. In the future we will be doubling the shrimp so we can have leftovers!  We had cesaer salad (the shrimp went especially well with that) and baked potatoes as our sides and it was a great evening. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I followed this exactly as written and we LOVED it! Do not let the ingredient list scare you this recipe came together quickly and cooks with in minutes. The steaks came out perfect! I used a maple bacon steak seasoning for the steaks and followed the marinade for the shrimp. Delicious!

I made this last night for my boyfriend's birthday.   I was using a recipe for a 2" porterhouse steak from another source, as porterhouses were on sale this week.  Let me just say... I LOVED the shrimp so much!  So much, that I enjoyed them MORE than the steak (unheard of, as I'm a steak lover)!!!  Just, wow.  This will be my go-to marinade for shrimp from now on.  In fact, I want to try to make a scampi with linguine and fresh parmesan.  The possibilities are endless.  Make this and impress your friends.  Thank you for this fantastic recipe!

Well, boys and girls, I made this for dinner tonight. I tripled the marinade for the shrimp since I used 15 U13-15 size shrimp and marinated them for 3 hours. They were beyond delicious. I can't wait to do the shrimp again for a Caesar salad. Yum, yum, yum!

I changed the recipe up a bit since I hate shrimp.  I substituted in scallops and it was delicious.  I didn't have Worcestershire sauce so I used horseradish with fish vinegar instead.  Still turned out wonderful.  I think I need to perfect my timing on the scallops, I think they should soak in the sauce longer than the shrimp was supposed to.

I made it almost exactly like the instructions. I didn't have filet mignon, so I used regular steak. Also, I cooked the marinade afterwards with a little bit of water to have a sauce on top of it. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe! As with the other reviews, the shrimp marinade was Soo delicious, although I may have marinated the shrimp too long (6+hours). My marinade got thick and solidified on my shrimp. (too much butter?) I used my homemade old Bay seasoning and since I didn't have parsley, I used fresh cilantro. I also added a squeeze of lime. I can't wait to try this again. The filet speaks for itself... extra thick, steak rub, medium done. Perfect! Here in Indiana it's mushroom season. So I added fried morel mushrooms to this dinner. Nothing better... oh, except the strawberry shortcake I made for dessert.

I've actually surprised myself. This turned out pretty good. The marinade for the shrimp was a little spicy. But there were no complaints. My family enjoyed the meal. It was pretty simple and easy to follow; however, I made a few adjustments on my end. I allowed my steak to marinate for 6hrs before serving. Everything came out delicious!

I only made the marinade for the shrimp and it was amazing. So flavorful and I liked that there was no salt. I wonder how the marinade will taste on chicken

Found this recipe to be delicious, doubled it for four, worked out well, and served with baked potato and salad.

Absolutely a 5-star in this house.  The shrimp marinade was very flavorful.  Simple steak seasoning on the filets.  I added a bit of hickory seasoning to the steaks. Served with grilled garlic bread.  Yum!
