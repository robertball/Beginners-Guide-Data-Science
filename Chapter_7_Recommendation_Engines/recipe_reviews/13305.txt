I rate it two stars only because the wine was ridiculously overpowering. I have to wonder if the amount was a mistake.  I like a little wine flavoring but this made it taste sour.  I ended up adding a lot of cream to it to tame it.  I think the flavor would have been outstanding otherwise.

This stew was pretty good and flavorful and freezes well.  I do not like mushrooms so I used 2 carrots and 1 stalk of celery instead.  
I added a pinch of cinnamon also which brought out the flavors...would experiment with spices and make again

the smell was amazing and it felt like home. I did not use all the wine recommended here (the bottle ended suddenly) and still it was so tasteful and full of aroma. and did I say it was so easy??

After reading ingredients in this recipe I I though it would be great, however I found it to be very bland. Based on comments I used I cup of wine land one cup of water, my husband thought I had wasted the veal

I thought this was really delicious. I took some pointers from others by adding a bayleaf and since I was on a detox cleanse, I omitted the white wine and replaced it with vegetable stock.
