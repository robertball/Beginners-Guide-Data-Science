This is definitely a do-again recipe. The pic with it shows pasta but none in the ingredients and I made it exactly except used veg oil in place of grapeseed oil. I used shitake mushrooms as it called for but they seemed a bit overwhelmed with the other flavors. Next time I'll use plain shite or portabellas - cheaper and I think will be as good. My first foray into kale too - liked it!

This is a very tasty and versatile recipe!  I used portobello mushrooms that I had on hand.  Also used balsamic vinegar and a little less nutmeg.  I love using a big wok for stirfrying leafy greens.
Update: I tried using sherry instead of red wine vinegar, also added some julienned carrots for color.  I finish with a generous squirt of balsamic reduction, a sprinkle of goat cheese and serve over brown rice.

This is the only way I have made kale so far and liked it. I followed direction closely but not exact. Just used regular oil. Anyway as long as you don't change it too much you can't go wrong with this recipe.

It was great!  I used white mushrooms (that's what was in the fridge). Otherwise followed the directions.  Thanks for sharing

Slight variation to the recipe - leave out the butter & salt, and I used mushroom/sage infused olive oil instead of grapeseed oil, white wine instead of vinegar. I used red kale, but next time will use organic baby kale, as the vegetable was a bit too tough.

I  made this recipe using a little olive oil & sesame oil since I didn't have the grapeseed oil on hand. Also substituted apple cider vinegar with a little wine as I didn't have the red wine vinegar either. Also, I used plain white mushrooms.  In any case, the dish came out great. My husband isn't a fan of kale, but he said this recipe is a "keeper".  We ate it all & I'll definitely make it again!

This was spectacular! I wonder why it doesn't have 1000 five-star reviews! Two things: the recipe calls for one 'bunch' of kale. Different varieties had different sized bunches, and my bunch was a little small. There were only two of us and we gobbled it up!  My advice is to double the recipe for four servings.

Delicious!  Served with Heinen's spinach and feta salmon burgers.  Added Greek Freak seasoning and squeezed fresh lemon juice on it after it was at the table.

Used olive oil instead of grapeseed oil, and balsamic vinegar instead of wine vinegar. Worked out fine!

Made it two days in a row!! Had a (HUGE) bunch of kale left over from a Salad-in-aJar party so was looking for some great recipes--this one more than fit the bill.  Thanks!

A friend gave me kale and onions from her garden so I thought this recipe would be a great fit.  I used button mushrooms since that's what I had on hand.  Really nice taste and it made the house smell amazing. I tasted it before adding the nutmeg and afterwards and it definitely adds something.  Will make again.

I made this recipe with baby kale and coconut oil instead of grapeseed since I didn't have any, and just realized I omitted the nutmeg.  My husband loved it and asked for more and he has never asked for more of a veggie before.

We liked it. I might try to spice it up a bit more next time.  Kale is new to me and I like it a lot so will keep working with this recipe.
