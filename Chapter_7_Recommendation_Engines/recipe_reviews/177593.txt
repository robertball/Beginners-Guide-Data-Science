This recipe was really great. My husband and I loved it. The only change I would make is to add a bit of cheese before wrapping it.

This was a big hit. My boyfriend ate 3 of them. I added more rice, due to the comment above about it being too runny. I'm guessing she didn't let it sit too long...also, the rice didn't cook in 5 minutes. I had to let it sit for about 15 before the rice was soft and thick. I added green onions to it, and shredded cheese before AND after scooping it into a tortilla. I also warmed the tortillas in the oven beforehand.

Love these wraps, only thing I did differently was add 2 1/2 cups of rice, to equal the liquid amount.  Everyone loved this recipe and it was very quick to make.  Thank-you :D

I would recommend putting a little bit of cheese in the wrap also. This melted in with the rice and chicken, it was so good!  The wrap was also good without cheese, but I would recommend using a little shredded monterey jack.

Loved this recipe.  I read the other reviews and did add cheese to the top of the mixture after putting in the tortilla.  Also added sour cream to the tortilla as well.  I did add a few things to the recipe.  I added a small amount of steak seasoning to the meat as I cooked it and some onion (I used dry since didn't have fresh).  I also added a small amount of velveeta to the sauce to help thicken, cooked longer, and added cornstarch disolved in a small amount of water for thickening.  It was a nice and easy recipe!

My husband and I really liked this recipe--especially for a mid-week, non-fussy meal.  I didn't have any salsa on hand so I used a can of diced tomatoes instead which turned out really well.

Didn't enjoy this recipe at all. The rice mixture turned out too mushy and wet.

I didn't have instant rice, so I cooked regular rice separately and mixed it all together.  Definitely better with cheese.  Either way it is a pretty good, simple recipe.

I added cheese also to try to thicken it up a bit.  I think it would make a good casserole...make it kinda like you would enchiladas or even layer it like lasagna.  It was good but my family prefers something with more of a bite to it.

This was awesome. Quick and easy to substitute ingrediants for what you have on had. I seasoned mine with a little hot taco seasoning which gave it that little extra something. Will keep for future!

Very yummy! I had rice that was already cooked so I omitted the water. I also had a can of pinto beans and added them. I also heated everything together in the microwave and baked my chicken in the oven and then cubed it. It is delicious! My husband and daughter are very picky and they loved this!

Wow...These are yummy!
I used 1/2 can of mushroom soup & cooked the rice in the broth I got from cooking off the chicken breast. Added 1/2 cup of black beans & add'l chicken broth (instead of water) to mixture for desired moistness. 
Spread sour cream on tortillas before topping with
meat for extra yumminess.
Will definitely add to the keeper recipe file :)

I made this tonight, adding more rice as suggested, and it was excellent.  Like any recipe of this nature, you can add other ingredients to suit your taste. A real keeper.
