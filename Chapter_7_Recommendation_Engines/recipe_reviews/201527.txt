I did not care for this recipe. It was so spicy and it did not go well w/ the orange. I could not get it to be sweet enough.

This grew o me.  At first, I didn't like the way the spices settled on the bottom, nor did I like the orange rind in the gelatin.  I did like the flavor of the gelatin itself, though!  I think that next time, I will use chai tea and add some milk as if this were a chai latte tea.  The oranges added a great taste!
