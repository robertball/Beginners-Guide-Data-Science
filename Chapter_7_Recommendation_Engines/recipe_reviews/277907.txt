What a beautiful tenderloin this turns out to be! This was so easy to put together and done in no time at all. Perfect for a weeknight meal for busy families. My tenderloin was slightly smaller than 1-1/2 lbs and was about 155 degrees when I took it out of the air fryer. A minute or two less cooking time would have been perfect for my piece so keep an eye on that if using a smaller piece than what's called for. The meat was still tender and juicy and the broccoli was delicious. Loved the crust it created in the air fryer. When hubby comments that it's good then it's a keeper! I did cut the black pepper back just a tad and only used a couple dashes of cayenne but it still had a smidge of heat. Perfect for us, we're heat wimps!Thanks, Nikki, for a great recipe that's a snap to prepare!

The pork was tender and delicious. I only cooked the broccoli in the air fryer for 3 minutes and it was a little over done. It would have been charcoal if I had left it in for the 10 minutes that the recipe directed.

My family loves Pork Tenderloin and this was delicious.  I made the recipe just as directed and it turned out great.  Makes great sandwiches if you have any left.

This very easy to make and delivered a nick kick.  This was my first time using the air fryer and the recipe was easy and delicious.  I was a little concerned about over cooking the pork and used my instant read thermometer , but everything worked out perfectly!

This was AMAZING! I air fried it for 23 minutes instead of 20. So tender and juicy! Will definitely be making this again. I didn't cook the broccoli, as we don't like broccoli.

It was alright - my husband and son enjoyed the broccoli which is a shock since there was no cheese on it! The broccoli WAS good, but didn't look like the photos - it was almost blackened - was I supposed to wipe out the air fryer in between? Pork was tasty but a little overdone - I am new to air fryer cooking, but everything I HAVE tried seems to come out overdone.I think we will try this again sometime!

Loved It! So easy to prepare and tastes great. I have this recipe in my regular rotation, and my family prefers this to individual pork chops.
