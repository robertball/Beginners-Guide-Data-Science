This was positively delicious!  The meat melted in our mouths!  I used a mixture of marinated roasted yellow and red peppers and canned diced tomatoes for the Tomato Concasse since I made this in the winter and tomatoes are not in season. I put this on garlic toast and it was just awesome!

I made this tonight and even though there were no summer tomatoes, it was delicious. Followed the directions and it was perfect.Our fillets were medium rare just like we want them to be. Definitely will make this in the summer months when tomatoes are sweet and fresh.

Wow! This was delicious!  I used your tomato concasse and it turned out beautifully!  I find that San Marzano canned tomatoes are about as close as you can get to fresh tomatoes if the fresh ones are unavailable.  The only thing that I wish I had done differently was to have watched the video first, as I would have avoided making a few missteps along the way.  It is really helpful.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

We had left over sliced  beef tenderloin from a catered buffet. I made this as written but added the tenderloin slices last to warm them without cooking them further.  This was served over toast with shredded cheddar cheese because that's all that was on hand. The dish was amazingly wonderful. Everyone loved it. Think you could substitute most any meat for the beef fillet.

This was wonderful!  I subbed a can of dice tomatoes  for the concasse and top sirloin for the tenderloin.  I increased all the other sauce ingredients to match the amount of tomatoes.   I served it over garlic toast.   Since there were only two of us,  we had leftovers  for a second meal a couple of nights later and it reheated well.  Also, we topped it with shredded Parmesan cheese instead of mozzarella.   Delicious both times!

The whole family loved it.  I made it exactly as written with the tomato concase, mash potatoes and beans.  What a terrific meal.  The recipe is a keeper. The only thing I would do differently next time is to double the tomato mixture.  Yum!

I made this for my boyfriend, and a vegetarian version of it (using large portobello caps instead of steak) for myself and it's my new favorite dinner. I couldn't believe how perfect it came out. Thank you for such a great recipe.

I made it exactly as the recipe calls except I used a different cut of meat.  I wonder if there's a way to cook the meat longer so that it would be more tender.

This was delicious and so are the left-overs (there's only 2 of us).  I upped the ingredients to have a bit more toppings for personal preference and used top sirloin.  Served with sliced fresh mozzarella on toasted Italian bread with steamed broccoli and the rest of the bottle of a most pleasant Chardonnay!

I took a flyer on this because I had the ingredients in my fridge.  This is a great dish full of flavor and aroma.  The cooking time is all in the cutting of the vegetables other than that this is a great one pan dish that will wow your eating companion with your cooking flair.  Poor your date a glass of wine and impress him/her with your cooking flair.   A really simple dish, I followed the recipe fully with the only alternative being I like spice so I added more hot peppers than perhaps others would.

Yes! Follow recipe close or 'wing it', with what you got that's close, and if you think this dish looks good, you'll love the taste! Chef John's Concasse, ( fresh peeled tomatoes) is a breeze and I've never tried doing it before. This is going to please everyone! The good cooks, picky eaters and the Lil ones, will all be looking in the rubbage can, looking for the take out containers you're hiding. Watch the video! Chef shows, so well, why it's important to use wine, wine vinager, broth or beer! To 'deglaze' the pan, and I've used them all! Thanks Chef!
