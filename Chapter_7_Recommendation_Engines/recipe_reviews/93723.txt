very good simple recipe, I used it to make calzones and they turned out wonderfully.The recipe itself could use a little flavour, maybe adding some italian spice would perk up the flavor a little.

I doctored this a bit... I added a teaspoon of sugar, and a bit of italian seasoning.  It was wonderful!!  Very smooth and easy to work with.  Not overly sticky, easy to press into pan.  Great!

A basic pizza recipe I wouldn't recommend this recipe for the simple face there are no cooking instructions.  

I ended up using closer to 4 cups of flour rather than the 3 stated and still found the dough a little sticky.  

I made three 12 inch pizzas from the dough (we prefer thin crust).  The first for the kids was a plain cheese baked on a pizza pan.  The crust was fine, nothing special, a little chewy but did not crisp well on the bottom.  I baked for 15 minutes in a 450 degree oven.

The second was baked on a pizza stone with pesto, spinach, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, carmalized onions and feta.  I preheated the stone for an hour at 450, then baked the pizza for 10 minutes.  This crust was much better, very crispy and with good texture.

The third pizza I rolled and froze based on the direction listed with the recipe.  I will have to see how it works once I have cooked it.

For those looking for a pizza crust with a strong flavor, this is not the recipe for you.  If you make this recipe I would suggest you have a strong set of toppings that you would not want a strong tasting crust to compete with.

We loved this recipie but we add 1 T sugar. I have also used this recipie to make bread sticks, and just a oblong loaf of bread. We will do this often. I dip it in Olive oil and cracked pepper. Or with garlic butter. I have doubled it each time using 2 T of sugar when doubled.

This is a nice crust, but it is a little bland.  I think that I would try this one again but add some spices to make it more flavourful next time.

as written, very bland.  I added 1 tbsp. sugar, 1 tsp each of garlic powder, onion powder, and Italian seasoning, and it still lacked 'something'. I also upped the salt to 1 tsp. I had it rising when I realized there was no baking temp/time.  I had to search through other recipes on here and the oven temps veried so much, I decided to bake it at 400degrees on an airbake sheet.  I didn't prebake and it was completely done.  The crust was very crispy but the inner pieces were more soft bread-like.  I would love to know the secret to a very chewy soft crust that isn't breadlike.  I'll keep searching.  The dough is very easy to work with, but agree that it takes more than 3 cups of flour.  I used about 4 1/4 and the dough did come together nicely.

It's hard to find a good dough recipe.  This one is good and makes one XL pizza.
