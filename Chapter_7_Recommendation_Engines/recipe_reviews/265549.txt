SO...I bought 2 packages of ground chicken only to discover that one of them was turkey! But I got to do a side-by-side comparison of the two! For us: not a major difference. The chicken was "goopier" to work with - the ground turkey was easier to make into meatballs. (FYI: I drained the water from the spinach - didn't squeeze it out, just poured it out). Flavor was almost identical and even the texture wasn't much different.  As for the flavor - these were GREAT! The first bite was a little heavy on the spinach, but after a few more, they grew on me!  All 4 teenagers in my house and my hubby liked them... although the one spinach-hater wasn't overly thrilled with all the green, but ate them anyways and liked them. We had them plain (no sauce, just rice and veggies), but these would be great in any way - sweet and sour or in a spaghetti sauce. Thanks for the great recipe Radhika - will make these again!

This is a different meatball than I have ever tried before.  My husband was a big fan and thought they would be the perfect appetizer.   I thought the flavor was good, but, the ginger was a little bit too strong for me.  I also wasn't crazy about the texture of the meatball.  Without having a binder in the recipe and using the lean ground chicken, the texture was a little"spongey"for me, but, my husband liked them as is.   We were a house divided in our opinions, so, I say give them a try !

I had to substitute turnip and mustard greens for the spinach because I’m on no-oxalates, but the lower score would not be fixed by using spinach.

There are no problems with the recipe, although I did add some baking time... about 5 minutes, hoping they would brown up. They stay pale, and the greens are very green, so I would avoid serving to company unless you know they won’t be thrown. I would suggest chopping the greens very fine or you get clumps of them in the meatballs. 

As far as the taste goes, the ginger-jalapeno-basil-tumeric-asiago-feta combination is probably going to be a new one for people. The first meatball invoked blandness, but for me it got better as I ate. There’s a weird heat that happens in the back of your mouth after a few bites, and it helps with the flavor of your future bites. I thought they were totally edible after 3 meatballs, my friend disagreed.

These have been a real hit with everyone that has tried them. I’ve made them several times. I prefer them without the optional feta cheese. They freeze well.

Follwed the recipe and even added the optional feta and tumeric.  They were bland and fell apart.  Won't make them again.

I was surprised by how tasty these were! Appearance seemed odd since most meatballs are not green and white, but they were not at all bland. I did squeeze the excess water from my thawed spinach. I think the mixture would have been too wet if I hadn’t. The feta cheese added to the flavor profile. Very different, flavorful meatballs!

I made changes only because I had turkey instead of chicken on hand. Fresh instead of frozen spinach. I added some of my favorite ingredients – cilantro and ground cumin. Did not have Feta.  These are great for an  easy lunch on the run. Will definitely make them again!

Yummy dinner for me.  I added the turmeric but had  no feta so I left it out .  The texture of these was different from usual meatballs.  Not unpleasant at all.  I think it was all the grated cheese in it.. I like it a lot
