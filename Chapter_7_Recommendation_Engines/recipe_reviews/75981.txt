The chicken Katsu part of this recipe is fabulous...a definite 5 star.  But, as many others have noted, the Tonkatsu sauce was practically inedible.  I wonder if the worcester sauce and soy sauce amounts were reversed?  Despite the negative reviews, I followed the recipe exactly, tasted it, and agreed whole-heartedly with everyone else.  So, I doctored it up a bit:  added 2 more tablespoons of soy sauce, 3 tablespoons of hoisin sauce, and put it on the stove to simmer and thicken while I was cooking the chicken.  It still wasn't great, but it was pretty good even if it didn't really taste like Tonkatsu sauce.  So I'll keep looking for a sauce recipe, but thanks for the wonderful chicken katsu recipe!  ETA:  I made this again (really, really love this chicken katsu) and tweaked the Tonkatsu sauce recipe and loved it:  1/4 c. ketchup, 1/3 c. soy sauce, 1/4 c. worchester sauce, 1 tbsp hoisin sauce, garlic powder and pepper to taste.  Hopefully that will help someone because this chicken katsu is really wonderful!

UPDATE: Ive made this again, and it is crucial that you season the chicken and bread crumbs very well so that the chicken isnt bland, and the tonkatsu sauce needs a lot of tweeking. It is way too tangy with the amount of worshtishere sauce called for, but i decreased it a lot to about only a tbs, and added brown sugar and low sodium soy sauce and the ketchup.  But I would recommend getting the Kikkoman Tonkatsu sauce, maybe that tastes better, I'll keep trying to perfect the sauce! ORIGINAL REVIEW-The chicken was very very good, i seasoned it well with salt and pepper, and I love the way the panko crumbs give it such a great crispiness. As far as the tonkatsu sauce, the worshestire sauce overwhelmed it very much, so i started over and put only 2 tbs of Worshteshire and 1/4 of water, with 2 tbs of brown sugar, ketchup and soy sauce as called for, since the tonkatsu sauces Ive had before were more sweet.

very easy and tasted just like a restaurant's.  Definitely pound thin to ensure even cooking and I just seasoned the chicken thighs with salt and pepper before the flour step.  Also the sauce makes way too much and is tart.  Here's my recipe for sweeter tonkatsu sauce: 2 tbsp each of ketchup, worcestshire sauce and soy sauce.  1 tbsp hoisin sauce and add about 2 tsp of white sugar to sweeten it up.  Boil until sauce thickens and use as a dipping sauce.  Overall a lovely recipe.

This chicken was soooo delicious. Very easy to do. I wouldn't change a thing with the chicken, useful tip... cover chicken w/plastic & pound, otherwise it could get rather messy.
OH YEAH.... the sauce was a bit much, I would next time cut it in half !!

I made this recipe, and the chicken turned out lovely. I also made the sauce but no one here liked it at all. It was very strong, and probably one of those aquired tastes. The method of cooking the chicken was wonderful though!

I never tasted Tonkatsu sauce, but I added a splash of Hoisin sauce and fiddled with the ingredient amounts to get it where I liked it! I loved the Panko crumbs, but even though I seasoned the chicken mercilessly, I found these to be incredibly bland in flavor. Husband liked it... but I will most likely search for a different recipe To try next. Thanks, BASKETBALL GIRL... for the starting point!

This chicken was FANTASTIC! I used a shallow pan with oil for frying. The Panko bread crumbs make all the difference. If I had known that years ago I wouldn't have kept substituting normal bread crumbs. I could kick myself. I didn't use the sauce as my 16 year old son is extremely picky about his food. However he said that this chicken was better than the Japanese restuarant. So thank you for sharing as this is going to save me $15.00 a week on his take-out.

Pretty decent recipe. My boyfriend is korean and he loved it. The sauce is a little off so I made some changes. I'm a college student so it's difficult to cook on a regular basis. This recipe was easy and quick to do. The sauce was too tangy and needed some sweetness. I didn't have sugar on hand so I used maple syrup. I cut back on the w sauce and it turned out just fine.

This dish was AMAZING. My kids loved it, and they are tough critics. I took the advice of the other comments and used the ingredients for the sauce at my own discretion. I cut the worcestershire sauce way back and added lots of brown sugar. It was delish and I will definitely make this a regular meal.

I made the Tonkatsu sauce from this recipe and another Chicken Katsu recipe from this site.  The sauce had an unusual taste that kind of grew on me.  I am not sure that I would make it again.  Surprisingly though my 18 year old son liked the sauce.  If I do make it again I may use the suggestion of other reviewers and add some brown sugar and maybe a little less Worcestershire sauce.  I could taste the Worcestershire sauce a bit too much.

Dipping sauce was very strong. Used chicken tenders and turned out very good. I will find another sauce to go with it.

This recipe caught my eye because my daughter's name is Ashley. It sounded pretty good anyway so I gave it a try and I'm glad I did because we all really liked it. I cut my chicken into thick strips before breading so each piece would be completely encased. I had never used panko before and I loved the results. The chicken was so crispy and the sauce had a nice tang. Thanks so much!

Really easy and really good. I used boneless pork in place of the chicken. I also used bottled Tonkatsu sauce. My 7 year old ate 3 of them---they were the size of a chicken breast. Will keep and make again!

I have made this several times and each time I have made this everybody has been more than satisfied. Personally I quite enjoy the sauce but I know that it can be a bit strong and it is not for everyone. All in all a great recipe.

The sauce ingredients are backwards. Do ½ cup of ketchup and ¼ cup of Worcestershire and you'll be good to go. I did add a bit of hoisin to mine. My mom made a somewhat spicy Asian honey mustard sauce to go with hers. Chicken turned out great and would get five stars from me.

I think this chicken tastes better with sweet and sour sauce.  With that in mind I am only rating the chicken  with a 5 star since my picky eating family really liked it!

The chicken was nice and crispy and easy to fix. The tonkatsu sauce was ok, iit was like barbecue sauce sort of with a worcestershire taste mostly, but we preferred the thai sweet chile sauce I had on hand instead. i wouldn't fix this sauce again, but the chicken was decent. The dish was rather bland but sometimes plain and simple is just plain good. We ate all of this. I'd fix this again with a little more seasoning on the chicken first and a different sauce. Thanks.

My five stars are for the chicken, because I bought the Katsu sauce. The chicken was delicious! My boyfriend is Japanese so Chicken Katsu is a regular dinner when I visit at his parents house. I was a little scared to make this because this is of course what he grew up eating but he thought it was delicious! It was quite simple and the Panko bread crumbs fried really well. The only thing I did was seasoned the chicken before applying flour with garlic powder, and added some to the flower as well.

I'm not sure if I should even rate this on here, because I only used part of the recipe. But here goes.  You do NOT need to season the bread crumbs/flour!  The Tonkatsu Sauce is the seasoning and my advice is to just go buy the Kikoman  sauce at the store- it is simply amazing!  Also, you DON'T NEED TO DEEP FRY this!   I used chicken tenders, which require no flattening!  I followed the breading directions, placed them on a cookie cooling rack on a cookie sheet and baked for about 20 minutes at 350.  They didn't turn out dark golden but were crispy and SO GOOD!  I served over white rice with a drizzle of the sauce- AMAZING!  Pics will be up soon!

I love this dish! The chicken came out beautifully and as for the sauce, I had read previous reviews in reference to the sauce and I used 2 tbs of both the Worcestershire and soy sauces, I used a fourth cup of ketchup and added  brown sugar instead of the salt and pepper...about a fourth of a cup of brown sugar. I let it simmer on the stove and whisked it. I continued to taste it and adjusted it accordingly (added a little more soy sauce and a splash of water too.) It had a sweet/sour/savory flavor and went great with the chicken and the rice I made.

I love making Asian dishes and this one did not disappoint me, I loved the Tonkatsu sauce!  I used boneless/skinless chicken tenders.

note:  this review is only for the sauce:  this is very funny because i made sakuragirl1's chicken katsu recipe but used this sauce and didn't read the reviews.  the chicken katsu from sakuragirl1 is fantastic but the sauce from this recipe is heinous.  make sure you don't make the sauce - it's a waste of time.

The chicken turned out great. Due to other reviewers suggestions, I used a different tonkatsu sauce recipe I found. Will definitely make again.

This was super easy and delicious. I wasn't sure about the sauce at first - I thought it was eye-wateringly tart - but it really does compliment the chicken. However, I do not recommend using it as a dipping sauce - it's way too strong for that, and, instead, should be drizzled sparingly over the chicken. There was way too much of it though - even half the given amount would have been ample for two servings. I used olive oil to shallow fry the chicken. Thanks for posting!

This was delicious. Didn't have panko bread crumbs but still tasted great with seasoned breadcrumbs. Can't wait to find panko and taste the difference!

Did a few things different and it tasted amazing! I always use MSG when seasoning meat, and it really is something I can't live without now. There are a lot of misconceptions about MSG in North America, but really it is just a form of salt that enhances meats natural flavour. This recipe was great however I added salt and pepper in the flour and Panko as well as directly on the chicken (with msg). Also I did the sauce different... I used hoisen sauce, siracha, ketchup, honey and a bit of this garlic mayo I had in the fridge.. it was great!

Excellent entree. My pickiest teen had seconds and approved chicken katsu for future meals. Very crunchy and pleasant texture. If you like fried chicken, this one is for you. The sauce was not to my liking at first taste so, I added a tablespoon of brown sugar, and a couple of dashes of garlic powder. Certainly not enough to dock this fine recipe a star, after all, any good cook adjusts to their taste!

The first time I made this my family fell in love with it. Now every time they see it on the dinner table they cheer. I did use thighs instead of breasts. They are super juicy!

This is a great recipe, especially if you're partial to Asian (especially Japanese) dishes.  Try it with boneless thighs instead of breast.  They are juicier and more flavorful (and cheaper!!!).  Very nice!  Thanks for sharing!!

This chicken was delicious!  I was out of eggs so I dipped in flour then milk then the panko bread crumbs; it worked.  The Sauce tasted like plain Worcstershire sauce (ewww) so I diluted it with about 1/2 Cup of Veg. broth; after my alteration my son said the sauce was good!   :)

This recipe is alright as written, but is bland, like most traditional Katsu dishes are. I prefer Shin98's Tonkatsu recipe, but for this one, add powdered ginger, powdered garlic, salt, & pepper to the flour before coating. For heat, use fresh crushed asian peppers. I would avoid making this sauce (just doesn't taste right. I prefer to use the store bought Bull-Dog Vegetable & Fruit Tonkatsu Sauce (can order online if not at your local asian market) instead of making my own which I can't get to taste as good as this. This sauce is the exact same flavor I remember from my years living in Japan.

You can vary this recipe by serving the chicken on top of shredded cabbage. Squeeze lemon on top and drizzle the tonkatsu sauce. I have a Japanese market by my house and there is a brand of ready made tonkatsu called Bulldog, it is really delicious. The tonkatsu, lemon, chicken and raw cabbage flavors blend deliciously. Great during the hot summer months!

This was really easy, and really good. I did as another reviewer suggested and made nuggets instead of strips. The panko coating is much better than normal chicken breading.

Quick and easy to make. The sauce was a bit too tangy for my taste, though. Using sweet and sour sauce for a dip sweetened it up.

Well, my DH and I made this for dinner tonight.  On the plus side, we enjoyed the super crispy coating that the panko made.  But on the minus side, the chicken was pretty tasteless without the sauce; the breading measurements were WAY off and lastly the sauce was ridiculously gross, don't even waste your time with it (nor should you waste your time with the recipe in the member review).  So all in all, the chicken was edible albeit, somewhat flavourless, so we probably won't make again.

Overall it was great. I found that I needed the cook the pork much longer in order to get the panko crispy. Kids loved it, but the sauce was way too strong for us all.

I have made this recipe about 6 times since I have come across it. The recipe is so easy, and tasty, and is a huge hit with my spouse who is a very fussy eater... 
The only changes I made to this recipe were to the Tankatsu sauce. I added an extra quarter cup of ketchup to the ingredients, and discovered that it not only cut the powerful taste of the Worsechester sauce but also gave it a little more zing... 
Great recipe for those pressed for time...

Good stuff! Chicken was good, I too tweaked the sauce after tasting it as written. I increased the soy sauce, decreased the worcestershire, added some mirin and Sriracha and ended up with an end product that was good. I have no idea what real tonkatsu sauce should taste like, but what I made tastes more like and better than the kikoman tonkatsu sauce that comes from the grocery store. Thanks for the recipe and the direction for the sauce!

I made this exactly as suggested.  It turned out delicious!  If the Tonkatsu sauce is too strong for you, just add more ketsup.

The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because I had to make a few tweaks (to not have bland chicken).

-I added the following directly to the chicken: Garlic powder, salt, black pepper, granulated toasted onion, and smoked paprika. Than I followed the steps for breading and frying. 

I make sure you heat the oil on medium-high then turn it down to medium-low RIGHT BEFORE I place the chicken in the pan. It makes the chicken  moist, cook completely, and the breading will be golden brown and very crispy. If the temp is too high, you will burn the breading before the chicken is thoroughly cooked.  Enjoy!!

I usually let my katsu marinate in mirin for a few hours before breading and frying. Gives it a much better flavor. Never even need the sauce.

This has a very different taste. Unfortunately, I wasn't crazy about it. The sauce was atrocious! I also tried it with store bought Tonkatsu sauce and that wasn't much better. Won't make this one again. Served with soba noodles.

I agreed with the other reviews.  The Tonkatsu saue was way too tangy.  To even it out I added 1/4 cup brown sugar and left it on the stove on low while I fried the chicken and it turned out great. I also steamed some Jasmine rice. My guests loved it.  I'll definitely make it again.

5 stars for the Chicken Katsu. 3 stars for the sauce. After tasting the sauce with the chicken, I tried "Tonkatsu / Katsu Sauce" which tasted good. Then I tasted the chicken with "Wasabi Mayonnaise Sauce" and it tasted even better. Finally, I added "Tonkatsu / Katsu Sauce" and "Wasabi Mayonnaise Sauce" and it tasted great. Served with Sesame Noodles" and "Cucumber Sonomo."

The recipe was really good! I used curry seasoning, cinnamon, and lemon seasoning (just 2 tablespoons) and it was extremely good. I also fried some rice, eggs, and string beans together and laid the chicken over top with the sauce and it was excellent.

The chicken is really good. I made my strips a little thicker so they could get really golden without over cooking. I added hot sauce to the eggs, garlic and onion powder, chives and cajun seasoning to both the flour and panko. I cooked these in my cast iron skillet that I filled about half an inch up with vegetable oil. I didn't use the recipe for the sauce instead I used another from this site.

This is such an easy and great-tasting recipe!  I make it with pork, too, and a friend who lived in Japan said it is typically served with a side of shredded cabbage in a creamy sauce, so I make a quick version with packaged cole slaw mix (the cabbage/carrot stuff) with some Ranch dressing stirred in.  It's a great contrast.

Here's an alternative sauce that has always been well received and definitely more palatable:

1/3 Cup Soy Sauce
1/3 Cup Brown Sugar
1/3 Cup Ketsup
1/3 Cup Hot Water
1   Tablespoon Ginger (grated)
1   Tablespoon Rice Vinegar

This recipe is really good at least the chicken part.  Unfortunately there is something really off with the tonkatsu sauce.  I've never had authentic tokatsu sauce but I'm willing to guess that the base of the sauce is ketchup and not worcestershire sauce.  So anyways I switched the amount of the soy sauce with the worcestershire sauce.  Then I just used the same amount of soy sauce as I did with the worcestershire and it came out fine.  You might want to use a little less worcestershire depending if you like it with a little bit of a kick.  I would imagine that the authentic recipe has that kick given that it's a little bit reminescent of wasabi.

Well, it's very easy to make; however, the chicken itself did taste a tad bit plain. Even with the tonkatsu sauce (I didn't use the one in this recipe but rather a store-bought version) it left something "empty". 5 stars nonetheless; I would make it again.

Easy and awesome. Made my own sauce consisting of ketchup, mustard, soy, and worstershire. Probably could have used a little brown sugar, but didn't have any. Chicken came out crispy and super juicy inside. Lower heat on the oil would have made it lighter in color, but no biggie. My picky daughter even ate it and loved it.

Made this last night and we loved it but with changes. Seasoned the flour with ground ginger, garlic powder and white pepper. Then whisked the eggs with a lil low sodium soy sauce. And finally added garlic pepper, and very lil salt to the panko crumbs. Great flavor! 3 stars because I feel it was too plain as written. As for the sauce I made my own thing of ketchup, soy sauce, ginger, mirin, and sugar. It was pretty good.

Excellent, realy simple recipe and delightfuly different. 
I crushed some sliced almonds instead of the Panko bread crumbs, as I could not get hold of them.
I halved the sauce, and, as a reviewers here disliked it, I left it off the chicken and put it in a bowl in the middle of the table so everyone could just put a little on their plate and try it first, no fear though, went down a treat, and the bowl was soon empty.
Definately make this one again.

Authentic - just like in the Japanese restaurants. I didn't change a thing - you have to use Panko crumbs to achieve the final results of "Japanese".  I served it with Lipton's Asian Style Teriyaki Noodles.  Therefore, I had way too much sauce - needed only half to use on the chicken.  If I served this with rice I would use the amount called for in the recipe so that I could use some on the rice.
