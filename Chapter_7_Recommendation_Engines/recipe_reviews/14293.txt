A very good base chicken salad recipe. We jazz ours up by varying different items: chopped pickle or relish, seedless grapes sliced in half, toasted almonds or pecans. I sub salad dressing for mayo also. As far as this being too soupy for some; as this recipe sits overnight in the fridge (which really makes it tastier) the liquid is absorbed.

Delicious!!!  I made my own coleslaw dressing (apple cider vinegar, sugar and mayo) for this and I could not stop "tasting" while I was preparing!!

I have been searching for a good chicken salad sandwich recipe and have finally found a good one.  My husband and his family loved it!  I don't have a food processor, so I just cut the chicken into small pieces and stirred it all together, and it was great!  Hard to stop eating it!

This is some of the best chicken salad ever!  I am used to chuncky chicken salad so I wasn't sure if I'd like it in the food processor - I absolutely love it.  I made my own coleslaw dressing. This is great on toast or on crackers.

I, too, was looking for a great basic chicken salad.  This was excellent!  I used two left-over chicken breasts that I had poached in broth, white wine & some herbs.  I used my Pampered Chef food chopper to cut the chicken to our preferred size.  Because the chicken breasts were not large, I adjusted the mayo & coleslaw dressing down a little.  The only addition I made was a sprinkle of dried tarragon.  Absolutely delcious!

We all thought the coleslaw dressing made the chicken salad too sweet.  Other than that, it was pretty good, and very easy to make.

Watch out - this chicken salad is addictive !!  Very, very good.  It was easy too, I cooked the chicken in the crock pot and made the salad when I got home.

A nice twist on "regular" chicken salad.  The cole slaw dressing and lemon are the difference, of course.  It was a bit runny, but adding more chicken should clear that up.  I'll do that next time.  My wife, who doesn't hesitate to express displeasure when she doesn't like one of my recipes, definitely enjoyed this one.

I made this for Friday Food Day at school for hungry teachers.  We were all tired off soups and meatballs in the crock pot and wanted something that made us feel like spring is just around the corner.  This chicken salad was a hit!  I read the reviews and added toasted slivered almonds and red seedless grapes to mine. With those items it had all the right textures and color.  I provided croissants to make sandwiches.

So far this is the best recipe I have found for chicken salad.   Has a very good taste to it, the only thing I added was a few sprinkles of garlic powder, only because I love garlic in just about anything.  So simple to make, about a half hour and you have a weeks worth of lunch!

This chicken salad is so yummy and so easy to make.  I used the chicken breast that I had leftover from the rotisserie chicken I bought from Costco.  The flavors from the chicken when quite well with the ingredients in this recipe.

Yep! It IS the greatest chicken salad ever and I've never liked chicken salad that was thrown in a processor. It's delicious, and so much easier to spread on a sandwich. I still like chunky salad when it's served over a lettuce leaf, but this ROCKS on a sandwich. The lemon juice wakes up the flavor and the Marzetti cole slaw dressing is a fabulous addition. I love this!

This was GREAT!  Its my new "go to" recipe for chicken salad.  I added chopped onion and I didn't use the food processor.  I just chopped my chicken breast (I cooked them in a pot of chicken stock so they would be nice & tender) and combined all the ingredients as directed.  Even my 2 year old son loved it!!  He kept saying "more, more".

This was really a good recipe for chicken salad.  I used the meat from a store bought rotisserie chicken which made this recipe really easy.  I put the chicken alone in the food processor, placed the meat in a bowl and then added the rest of the ingredients.  It made a good amount.  I adjusted the amounts of mayo and dressing to taste.  Great on sandwiches or even by itself!

Great and easy recipe!!!  I didn't have any celery so I just used celery salt instead of regular salt.  I also added some chopped onions.  I prefer a chuckier texture so I didn't use a blender.  The coleslaw dressing gives it a unigue falvor.

This was good. I did not have slaw dressing so I used poppyseed dressing instead. I don't think I cared much for the texture of it. I like mine more chunky. Next time I won't use the food processor.

It was good but it was hard to use the food processor. It could have been mine but it was too small to fit the celery and chicken. Eventually the chicken and celery which  had to be done separately turned out minced instead of bite-sized like in the picture. But even though my girls did not want any, my Husband and I ate it all.Thanks for a recipe that allowed me to use up leftover roasted chicken.

Because I didn't have a couple ingredients, I was forced to improvise.  I subbed a carrot for celery and creamy Italian dressing (Pfeiffer) instead of cole slaw dressing.  It was perfect!  I thought the food processor might be a bit much, but it gave it a great consistency!

I substituted fat free miracle whip for the mayo for Weight Watchers, and it's the best chicken salad. I also add grapes and apples for texture--delicious!  Thanks for posting this one!

I did not like this at all.  Maybe it was the cole slaw dressing. I used Kraft. But it just tasted like Miracle Whip to me and I'm not a big fan of Miracle Whip.

I added Clausen's relish for a refreshing kick. Homemade coleslaw dressing is best.

very good! I didn't have any celery - but it was good anyway. I will try it with celery next time!

Way too soupy for my husband's and my tastes.  Maybe would have been better with fresh chicken instead of canned, but I still can't see how it wouldn't have been really soupy.  The combination of ingrediants was good, but I'll go back to adding as I go to get the right texture.

This was a hit, and I'll be making this again this way.  I served it on slices of baguette with a sliced grape on top.  Two big serving platters disappeared and there were only 8 guests, :).  I didn't add the slaw dressing as I didn't have any on hand and I have to admit I used two cans of chicken from Costco rather than fresh chicken breasts because that is what I had.  Even still it was so good, and the texture was amazing.  My grown kids have been asking me to make it again.

Wonderful!  I use 1 lb chicken to ingredients listed, plus add a green onion and Tony C.  To me it is best to chop the veggies a bit first, then add chicken so it remains slightly chunky.  But it tastes wonderful either way.

This was a great recipe.  I also made my own dressing  (mayo, sugar and cider vinegar) and that helped me get it exactly how I like.  It tastes great on a toasted bun.

As many other reviewers had done, I made my own cole slaw dressing as I didn't want to have a whole jar of it looming in the fridge waiting for me to find another use for it. I liked the ease of this recipe. I poached the chicken breasts while I waited for the dressing flavors to marry in the fridge. And once the chicken breasts cooled a bit, I plunked all the ingredients into the food processor. Presto, chicken salad! Next time I will add the lemon juice at the end when mixing in the salt and pepper as I think my half a lemon was extra juicy as that was all I could taste (not a terrible flavor, just not great). Thank you Rich for posting this recipe, definitely a keeper once I get the lemon ratio right!

I really liked this and so did my husband.  Never used the food processor before for this but it helped to make it fine enough for a sandwich, instead of the usual chunky.  I reduced the celery a little and added some finely chopped green pepper.  Hubby doesn't like too much celery.  Plus i used chicken that had been on-the-bone chicken breasts. Used Marzetti cole slaw dressing, the only kind I could find.  Susie

Yum!  It took more salt and pepper than I thought it would to get the flavor exactly like I wanted it, but the end result is yummy!

This is really good!  I poached the chicken breasts with some herbs and a bay leaf.  Mixed dressing as instructed, used Marzetti's cole slaw dressing.  I added just a bit of red onion for color.  This got rave reviews.  Good combination of flavors.  A keeper!

This was a huge hit with my family, sooooo yummy!  I cut the chicken breasts up into bite size pieces as we do not have a food processor.  I have to say this was the best chicken salad recipe that I have come across, my family does not like all the "extras" like fruit and nuts that are in some chicken salads.

My daughter wanted to make chicken salad today...so we had daddy-daughter kitchen Saturday!  We chose this recipe because of its simplicity and minimal ingredient list and went to work.  The result is a bit more tangy than I would've liked (kinda tasted like miracle whip), but all in all we're happy with the result.  Super easy to prepare.  We excluded the celery from the mixture because neither of us are particularly fond of celery in our chicken or tuna, and added peppers as a final garnish/dipper.  Also, we added Stacy's Simply Naked pita chips that were great for scooping.

I have never made a chicken salad with a food processor, but I am a convert! Put in whatever add-ins you have on hand or enjoy. I used celery, toasted almonds, and a little green onion.

My husband loved this. Perfect Just the right amount of everything to give left over chicken new life. This is my to go chicken salad from now on. I also make my own coleslaw dressing so you can make it as sweet or not as sweet as you want to. We like in on sub rolls with lettuce only. Great! Thank You Rich
