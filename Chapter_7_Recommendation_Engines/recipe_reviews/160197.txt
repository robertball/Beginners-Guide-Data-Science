These are very good.  The Granny Smith apples give them nice flavor.  I would use 2 cups of water per 1 cup of quinoa though.  I didn't use the mint but added a few more spices just to kick it up a bit.  Overall, it is a nice vegetarian dish!

We changed this recipe around a little bit. First we subbed quinoa with Israeli Couscous, however misjudged the yield on the couscous (1&1/3 cup - Standard at Trader Joe's) will probably fill 4-6 peppers. The couscous has a little more rewarding texture than quinoa. We also cooked the couscous in vegetable stock for more flavor. Also, I couldn't find green onions tonight, so I used chives, and they seemed to work well. With the added yield of the couscous, we doubled the tomatoes and apples. and lime juice. We also left out the mint. That said, this dish was absolutely excellent. The flavors just sort of jump out and are literally mouth watering. My boyfriend says it's the sort of thing that makes him think he could be vegetarian too. Since we had so much filling, there was enough to bake and eat without the peppers - very yummy!

Don't expect these to be like the stuffed peppers made with meat--they're not, but they are excellent. I used vegetable bouillon when cooking the quinoa, & added raisins and chopped pecans.

So delicious and prep time was much quicker than indicated.  I omitted the mint and used a Jona Gold apple instead.  I also added about 1 oz goat cheese and 1/4 cup sunflower seeds.  My husband and I are trying to incorporate 1 vegetarian dish each week and this one is a keeper!

I fix my quinoa 1:1.25. I had 2 very large peppers and didn't use even half the quinoa so will cut by half next time. Cooked the quinoa with 3 cloves of sliced garlic and used Better Than Bouillon chicken flavor. Not vegetarian but still meatless.  I added about 1/2 cup of cooked barley.  Dried mint cuz I didn't have fresh. Added 3 oz of ff Feta. I haven't eaten a stuffed pepper in 40 years, just not a fan of regular meat and rice versions.  This version was terrific and will be used often.

This was OK but a little too sweet between the red pepper, apple, and tomatoes, I ate it and enjoyed it but don't think I'll ever crave it or really want to make it again. I like the idea though!

Very yummy! I cooked the quinoa in broth instead of water and used a can of rotel (tomatoes & chilies) that I drained since i didn't have fresh tomatoes and omitted the mint.....soooo yummy!

These vegan stuffed peppers were sensational! The herb melody added such a kick to the quinoa, especially my fresh mint from the garden. I used both red and white quinoa to jazz up the colour of the dish; try a water quinoa ratio of 2:1. The Granny Smith apple adds a very nice texture. I will definitely make this again, even as a side salad rather than in a pepper.

These were sensational. I didn't have any apples so I substituted about a half cup of dried apricots, cranberries and cherries. If I had read other reviews earlier I would have tried the feta and sunflower seeds, too. All the veggies and herbs were fresh from my garden so it made for an especially satisfying entrÃ©e for our "one vegetarian day" a week my husband and I are doing now. I also had LOTS of filling left that can be a side dish or cold salad another day.

Very tasty.  The apple really added a nice contrast, along with about 1/4 c. gorgonzola I added.  I was able to fill 8 pepper halves.  Cutting length-wise is a great tip; the stems pull right off after cooking.  I skipped the mint and forgot to add the lime juice.  Also added one 8-oz. can of chick peas, drained, and about 1/4 c. chopped shiitake mushrooms.  I found I had to double the baking time to soften the peppers, which were still somewhat crispy at 20 minutes (I recommend testing to one's liking).  I also covered the dish with foil to maintain moistness.

I made the recipe standing up and neater appearance since I took them to a small get together. Substituted brown rice for the quinoa. Delicious. I added a little curry and the apples gave an extra sweetness. They were all gone and people went back to scoop up the rice! Enjoy this one ~ it's great!

These were great, and I added a cup of minced cranberries, too.  I think they really made the dish, especially since it's the Christmas season.  Also, other reviewers had suggested goat's cheese, which I happened to have, so I added that, too.  Magnifique!  I served it with Indian-style naan bread and the moroccan salmon cakes also on allrecipes.

It was definitely an inspiration, but my hubby does not care for mint and tomatoes bother my stomach...so, I made a 'curry spice sauce' with a little coconut milk+water/couple of spare colorful bell peppers and green chilies/curry spices/onion/garlic cloves/pink himalayan sea salt/fresh basil/limes from our tree-->ALL pureed together. Red and original Quinoa, used Lentils/diced carrots, celery, apple, raisins. Mixed/Stuffed/Steamed it all/drizzled some leftover steaming sauce and served with baked sweet potatoes topped with Bulgarian pure yogurt and scallions and tiny bit of olive oil....C'est la vie!

Pretty tasty!  I changed the ingredients a bit, using couscous instead of quinoa.  I also added fried tofu, feta cheese, and a couple spoonfuls of pesto to the mixture filling.  Was a bit hesitant about adding water to the pan, but they turned out fine, I think a lid would have helped keep the moisture in.

I didn't have everything, but substituted parsley with fresh cilantro, lime, for lemon (I have a tree)...I didn't have tomato or mint, and used a NY apple variety...but I added

Flaxseed which is like a bread crumb texture
Toasted slivered almonds---the crunch really added a lot
and some cayenne for heat.  Delish!  I had left over stuffing that I can mix with green beans tomorrow night :-)

I don't eat beef and I generally don't like rice, but the idea of stuffed peppers always sounds so appealing.  This recipe had the sort of ingredients I was looking for, and it is a keeper! The author must have very big peppers because I think I could have filled double the number of the ones I had, and while not large, I thought them to be of decent size.  The leftover filling is wonderful just to eat on its own though, so no complaints!  Next time I make this, I will probably add more garlic and lime to kick the flavor up a notch.  I'm not one for subtlety.  Really enjoyed the interesting quinoa mix.  Yummy!

This a great recipe! I doubled the ingredients and added 2 more apples, 1 cup of sunflower seeds, 6 ounces of feta cheese and 1/2 small can of drained diced tomatoes, and 5 large basil leaves chopped. I sprinkled the bell peppers (green / not red) with shredded mozzarella and baked covered with foil. Lots of leftovers to eat for lunches.

I liked it!  I've been discovering the joys of mint, so I was excited to try this recipe when I came across it.  I have a bumper crop of peppers and need to find a recipe.  I added sunflower seeds and feta for some protein.  My only complaint was that I had way more filling than I could use in the peppers,  but, we'll just eat it again tomorrow.

Made these for Halloween and carved a jack-o-lantern into each one, they were a hit!   I did add cranberries and feta cheese but  it tasted good without too.  Thanks.  I might do them for valentines and cut a heart in red peppers!

Very good I substituted the lime juice with lemon juice. And I used tomato sauce instead of canned tomatoes. The only thing I would change is the peppers need to be cooked longer at least 30 minutes

Fantastic flavour but could easily half the recipe (I have stored remainder for more stuffed peppers).  Do double the amount of water!  Everyone at dinner asked for the recipe!

My husband and son both loved this recipe! I'm not a fan of mint, but I always like to make the recipe as is the first time, and all the flavors blended so well, I even liked the mint.  I made extra filling to have some to eat on its own too! I used yellow and orange peppers because that's what I had on hand and it was delicious.

Good recipe.  Parsley very strong, so maybe add a little less.  In my version I added a little ground pork which worked well.  Kids ate it all so good kudos there!

Won't be making this recipe again. I think I perhaps added a bit too much cayenne pepper (not in the ingredients, but suggested by another reviewer) because it was a bit bitey, so that was my own fault. However, as other reviewers have suggested, the flavors never really melded together.Some parts were sweet, others bland, others too garlicky. The quinoa overall was dry (I did not use stock to cook it as others have suggested). I'm very disappointed given that all of these ingredients are ingredients I love.

I definitely will not make this again according to this recipe. The biggest issue was that the quinoa almost burned because there was not enough water. Definitely use 2 cups of water per 1 cup of quinoa. The other problem was that there was too much stuffing. I ended up having so much leftover that I actually ate the stuffing (like a quinoa salad) so it wouldn't go to waste and did not have room the peppers after they were cooked. I had to refrigerate the peppers for later. If I try this again, I will experiment with some seasoning, and perhaps some broth to cook the quinoa in instead of water.

In theory, I love this dish.  Unfortunately, the flavors in the filling never really melded together.  Some bites were delicious, others bland, others too sweet, and still others confusing.  I tried it again substituting rice for the quinoa and had the same problem.  The mint, though, is a refreshing touch.

Loved the ingredients and the bright colors but the flavors were lacking.

These have become a favorite in our household.  Love the Spinach Pesto.

This was good. Very different. My husband is vegetarian and he thought it was good, although it won't be a staple in our house. Our kids (who eat mostly vegetarian) didn't enjoy it. I followed the recipe except added sunflower seeds and feta.. both family favorites. It was a nice light and healty dinner, just not great.

they were ok, the filling was very tasty. I did miss some kind of sauce, so we ended up putting a slice of cheese on top and let it melt.

These were delicious!  I used orzo since the local grocery store didn't have quinoa.  I've never had regular stuffed peppers, but these were tasty!!!
