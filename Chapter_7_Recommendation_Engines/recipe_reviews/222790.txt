Hazelnut, we loved your recipe!  We recently bought Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, a bottle with honey in it.  Your drink had it beat by far!  Yum!  This I made with Jack Daniel's, Martini & Rossi's Sweet Vermouth, and honey from Costco.  You may not be able to tell that my lemon was "bald" because I zest all my fruit for other recipes!  We will absolutely have this drink again!  Thanks so much!

I haven't made this, but having been a bartender, I would like to say that one should never shake vermouth in a cocktail shaker. Doing so would bruise the vermouth and cause an unpleasant taste. Also, one jigger of vermouth would be quite strong. Perhaps just swirl a small bit of vermouth into the glass and pour out the excess, then add in the shaken whiskey and honey.

Honey and whiskey should always  go together like this. Really delicious.( I  used about 2 tablespoons of honey because I was feeling sweet.) There is an almost smokey undertaste that I can't explain.This  tastes more complex than the ingredients would lead you to believe. Who would think that adding 2 simple ingredients to a classic recipe would make such an impression? Very pretty name, too.
