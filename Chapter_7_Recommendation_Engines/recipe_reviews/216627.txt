I have been making these for years....do NOT be afraid of the apple, it adds AMAZING flavor...a nice crunch & sweetness...use Granny Smith apples. I also throw in a little diced red pepper & sometimes use turkey instead of ham. Delicious, and always a HUGE hit everywhere I take them! I roll them up jelly roll style & slice into bite size pieces.

I probably shouldn't give it the full five stars since I didn't make it as the recipe states--I can't have flour tortillas and was going to try corn, however didn't have any. I ended up using every thing else and it was so good! I think as long as you have the ham, apple, cream cheese as a basis--experiment with the rest--it will be good!

These are fantastic! I make them all the time for a quick snack. Sometimes, I skip the plastic wrap/ refrigerator step, and they're still fine. I add a couple leaves of lettuce, use honey mustard, and skip the cream cheese. Great!!

Nothing spectular here.  Found it was just a roll up.  I will say that the granny smith apples do give this a good taste.  Will not make again!

I likes these but my 5yo wasn't crazy about them- he pulled out the apple matchsticks and ate them separately

#BestIdeaEver:  These are wonderful for a crowd.  The apple adds so much to the flavor.  Don't skimp on it.

I made this for a church potluck, and it was a huge success!  People kept coming up to me and saying how much they enjoyed the apple in this easy to handle picnic food!  I will definitely be making this one again and again!
