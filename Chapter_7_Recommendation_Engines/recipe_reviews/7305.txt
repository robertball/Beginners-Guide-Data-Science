My mom is a tiny little thing with a hearty appetite and a real appreciation for good food. But she likes to watch her figure. Knowing she'd have her martini at the house before we took her out to dinner last night, I never thought this cake would fit into the scenario for the evening. But she tried a "taste," finished a decent-sized piece and after dinner took another 4 pieces home, individually wrapped. It hooked her. As for Hubs, he rarely eats dessert in the evening, particularly chocolate. But he relented, sat to himself, and enjoyed a little slice, followed by another, perfectly content, just he and his cake. Make no mistake - this is NOT banana bread covered in frosting, provided your technique is correct. Cream the butter and sugar, add eggs one at at a time, then the vanilla. Stir in the bananas. Then add the flour, in three additions with the buttermilk, beginning and ending with the flour, just until combined. This is a light and fluffy cake, with a more aerated rather than dense crumb - and it's plenty sweet, particularly if you use nearly black bananas, as I did. I'm glad I topped it with Chocolate Cookie Buttercream Frosting (an amended version to make it more chocolatey) to kind of temper that sweetness. I coated the sides lightly with toasted chopped pecans and garnished the top with dark chocolate curls and dried banana chips. This is a three-tiered showpiece. Normally this would have gone to the office with Hubs. This time, at his request, it stayed home.

This cake was WONDERFUL!!!!! It was VERY moist, had a great texture and the taste...my mouth waters just thinking about it. Loved it!! 
I did have to cook it about 20 minutes longer than the recipe called for as the batter was very heavy. May have been my mistake but the wait was WELL WORTH IT!!

Thanks Syd!

Great Banana flavor, but I am looking for a more cake-like, fluffy texture, this was more like banana bread.

I make a BIG A Banana Cake for my Daughter's Birthday every year and I have become bored with the recipe that I have been using...  I just made this recipe into 28 cupcakes for my Daughters class tomorrow and it is SUPER YUMMY.  I had an idea that it would be good when I saw her lick the spatula clean but it is truly yummy.  I will use this recipe for a long time. Thank You for Sharing !!!

Heavenly banana flavor! Frosted this delicious treat with a cream cheese icing into which I blended a mashed banana,and a bit of vanilla. Even better the day after.

Delicious.  Not as heavy as banana bread, not quite as light as a cake.. but it was just right in the middle.  I made this for my son's birthday and I found it to be a nice change from the usual white or yellow cake.  I topped it with the banana butter icing from this site and it was a perfect match.  I received compliments from all who had some.

I made this last night and the flavor is very good. The only changes in the recipe I made was with the sugar and buttermilk. I didnt have any buttermilk and didnt want to make a trip to the store for just that so I did the old substitution with milk and lemon juice, The cake was very heavy tho. Not like a cake at all but more like a banana bread. I made it in a bundt pan. I too decreased the sugar to 1 cup but it was still very sweet. My grandkids LOVED it tho. All in all a good recipe for taste.. just not as light as a cake would be.

Very moist, very good texture.  I personally do not care for icing, so next time I would make mine a bit sweeter.  I baked very early in the morning and did not notice that I needed cake flour until I had already measured all the ingredients.  So instead, I used all purpose flour.  To retain the moisture, I added an additional three tablespoons of milk and three tablespoons of vegetable oil.  I iced it with Banana Butter Icing.  Everyone loved it.

I used this recipe to build a sculpted birthday cake (shape of a monkey.)  The recipe was nice and sturdy and shaved off well.  So if you're into that sort of creative thing, this is a great recipe!  And tastes delicious to boot!

I used a bundt pan and made a banana pound cake.  I used 1 cup of white and 1 cup of brown sugar...that was plenty.  I also added about 2 tsp. of cinnamon.  I believe that bananas, brown sugar and cinnamon harmonize so I included them in this cake.  I skipped on the icing but would recommend using one.  Thanks for sharing.

Wonderful recipe. I made this as a birthday cake for my mom, and we both loved it. For extra banana flavor, I added a box of banana flavored instant pudding to the batter. My mom wanted a cake that tasted like a banana split, so I also mixed in about a half a bag of semisweet chocolate chips. I used strawberry jelly in between cake layers, frosted the cake with chocolate frosting, and topped it with coconut. It turned out amazingly. Thanks for this great recipe.
