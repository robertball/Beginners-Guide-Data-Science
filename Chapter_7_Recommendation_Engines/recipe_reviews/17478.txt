Great recipe.  I did make some changes due to not having all the necessary ingredients.  I used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 plain yogert. I also added a little cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla to the cake ( covers the box cake taste) I did not have apricots, so I mixed Knotts apricot preserves 1/2 c into the creamcheese mix until smooth(used a hand mixer) then just spread this mixture over the cake batter, ramdomly dropped some extra preserves over it, topped it with the crumble, i added flour to get more crumble, and baked as directed... It was very yummy and I have requests for a raspberry one and a lemon one. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very pretty and tasty.  My can of apricots only had 14 too, so it was fun to try to avoid getting that one cream cheese Danish! Instead of using water for the glaze, I used the yummy syrup from the can.  It gave the whole cake an extra apricot boost!!

This is by far the best cake recipe that I have ever made. I've made this many times for friends and each time everyone wants the recipe. It's fairly easy to make and sooooo verrrry good. WOW! Hint! If your can of apricots doesn't have enough apricots in it... just cut a couple in half... If you really want to treat yourself and your family, you need to try this!!!! Five stars plus!

Very moist and very delicious.  Resign yourself to buying two cans of apricots because one will not have enough halves in it.  I wondered if it would look better with the rounded side of the apricot up, so I did a few that way and learned that with the cut side up they catch some of the crumb topping and that's better.  If leftovers are kept in a closed container the almonds will get a little soft, but it still has a great taste.  Definitely mix the powdered sugar with some apricot juice for more flavor, and put the glaze in a small plastic bag with a tiny bit of one corner cut off for easier drizzling.

This is fabulous!  I've taken it to several brunches now, and served it to guests on holidays using different fruit, and it is always a hit.  I doubled the glaze on accident the first time, and liked it so much that I always make it that way now.  This is beautiful and popular.

IT'S A HIT!  I made this to take to the office for a Friday morning pick me up and everyone raved about it.  I used a yellow cake mix (didn't have white on hand) and I used raspberry preserves instead of the apricot halves.  I also used a knife and swirled it just a bit before I put the topping on.  With the red preserves swirled on top it looked and tasted great!

This was the easiest and best tasting breakfast cake.  I made it for my daughter's confirmation and it was a big hit.  It looked like a professional baker it!  It was delicious and definitely a keeper.  I have passed this recipe around.

This was absolutely wonderful and so easy to make!! I used fresh apricots and took this to our friends lake house. Major hit with adults and kids alike.  I'm going to try this again using maybe cherries or some other fruit! You've gotta try this one!

RIGHT ON! This was delicious. I picked out some really ripe nice local apricots. I also used half fat-free cream cheese half and regular to cut the calories a bit. Great...

I wasn't so fond of the white cake mix taste so I added some cinnamon to that and it made it taste more homeade I think.  The apricot was great but my favorite is to make stripes of the cream cheese and run raspberry pie filling along the same 3 stripes!  A home run!

I used a yellow cake mix and the coffee cake was delicious.  I made more of the crumb topping by adding 1/4 cup of flour and a tablespoon of confectioners sugar to the cake mix/butter/almond mixture.  It tasted just fine and stretched the crumb topping so it covered all of the cake.  This cake is rich, with gobs of calories and fat, but once in a while it is worth it.  My brunch guests loved it.  It is definitely a keeper.

This was the easiest and best homemade danish/coffecake I've ever tasted.  I did add 1/4 C add'l flour w/the 1 tbl of 10X sugar to stretch the topping along w/using the drained apricot syrup + a dash of milk for the glaze instead of the water.  It WOWed everyone in the office and had everyone coming back for 3rds.  Thank you - keep these special "easy" treats a coming!

This is a GREAT recipe.  I used 1/2 apricots and 1/2 canned peaches.  It was moist and very flavorfull.  I took the previous advice and used the apricot juice to make the glaze. Mmmmmmmmmm.

If there were 6 stars I would rate it that.  This was a wonderful danish to have while enjoying Christmas morning.  My mom even took a picture of it because it came out so pretty looking.  She could not believe that it started from a mix.  The taste was fantastic.  Everybody in the family enjoyed it.  Thanks so much.  This will become one of my favorite recipes!!!

I didn't care for this as a danish coffee cake.  It looked nice, but is definitely too 'caky' to be a danish.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Very flavorful, good texture, but didn't think it was a "danish-like" pastry, maybe because of the cake mix. I would experiment with other fruit, maybe Solo pastry fillings or fresh fruit, preserves, even pie filling. Presentation is very pretty. I love apricots so maybe fresh would be best. Love the cream cheese. I would make this again because it is so simple to make and I think most adults would love it, not so sure about kids.

Delicious!  And beautiful!  This freezes wonderfully.  My can of apricots only had 13  pieces in it, so the last two pieces were cheese Danish and they were great too.

This was very good! I did add a bit of almond extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg to the batter to add flavor, and used half sour cream and half greek yogurt for the sour cream. I think I over mixed the batter so will try to be more careful next time. Also, I just bought a 32 oz can of apricots and had only 2 halves left over.

Beautiful as well as Great Taste. Only change was Strawberry, and Blackberry Preserves, instead of Apricots. Perfect for a Holiday Breakfast or Brunch!

This recipe is very easy and makes a very nice presentation. The texture is more like cake than danish, but it tasted very good. I couldn't make wells in the batter with a spoon, so I just put dollops of cream cheese on top of the batter and pressed an apricot slice into each, which worked out well. Be sure to count the number of apricot slices in the can before putting on the cream cheese, because several people said they had less than 15 (my can actually had 18, so I made 3 rows of 6). I added a teaspoon of almond extract to the cream cheese. I used light cream cheese and sour cream, and I'm sure no one could tell. My husband and son both immediately went back for seconds.

Loved it!! Took it to church for morning fellowship and it was a BIG hit. I substituted apricot preserves for canned. (I had some homemade preserves that had a lot of fruit in it) Not knowing how many halves were in a can I thought 1 can many not be enough and 2 may be too many and I'd have waste. It is delicately sweet and tastes good slightly warm still.

I took this to Easter breakfast this morning and it was well recieved.  It did look very pretty when it was done.  Per other suggestions I did add in some nutmeg, cinnamon & vanilla to the batter.  Also, I used 4 tsp as opposed to 2 for the glaze and subbed in the apricot juice instead of water for more of an apricot "pop".  THANK YOU for sharing!  :)

I thought it was good. I used French Vanilla cake mix and added xtra vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg like other readers. I think the flavor of cake made it too sweet. Next time I won't use Fr.Vanilla. I think that was the problem. I also used raspberry jam, I think preserves would be better but I couldn't find any that were seedless, hence the jam.

Wow big servings.  This was fun to make.  I bought 2 small cans of apricots due to other reviewers not having enough.  I will definitely make this again but making more smaller squares and cutting the apricots in half and trying with other fruits.  Thank you.

This so SOOOOOOOO good. The can of apricots only had 12 halves, so I adjusted the number of wells. Will try with cheery, apple, pie filling.
Great grab-and-go breakfast.

I made this but I don't like apricots so I used a bag of frozen berries. Cooked them with a 1/2 cup sugar then thickened as I would for a pie with cornstarch. After putting the cream cheese dollops I put this on top. Very good.

Just made this tonight for the first time.  I don't like to serve something new to people unless I taste it first. I have a breakfast/meeting to bring it to tomorrow.  
I cut it into squares and tasted one......WOW!  I must say that it tasted like it came from a bakery!  I plan on making this over and over again.
I did make a change that another reader suggested.  Instead of using apricot halves I used apricot preserves on top of the cream cheese mixture.  Next time I may try a different preserve such as peach.
I love this recipe!

Thumbs up from the whole family on this one, however would probably make changes if I made it again.  I too only had 14 halves in my can, so I used half of a fresh peach in the last spot.  The cake was good, and my younger kids prefered that, to the fruit and cream cheese part.  However, the rest of us agreed that the cream cheese needs something more, not necessarily sweetened, but maybe some flavoring.  Also, would probably try and swirl it through rather than dropping my the spoonful and would dice fruit and add spread that out too.  I did use the juice from the apricots, instead of water, for the glaze.

Very tasty, but I found the cake layer to be too thin to stand up to the apricot half.

I used apple pie filling instead of apricots. Used low fat sour cream.  Skipped the almonds. Rave reviews.

My family wasn't crazy about this.  It's a lot of fat (but so is most anything really delicious!) and the sum of the ingredients is pretty expensive for the result.  I will continue to search for a Danish recipe; thank you nonetheless for sharing your recipe!

Wonderful recipe!!!  I had to slice several of the apricot halves in order to fill all fifteen wells.  The can I purchased did not have fifteen halves.  The slivered almonds with the confectioners sugar drizzled on them made a beautiful presentation.

Great easy coffee cake! My modifications were: adding 1/4 cup of powdered sugar to the cream cheese mixture, and using Solo canned apricot filling. I also made my own style of icing (melted butter, powdered sugar, Carnation  milk, vanilla, pinch of salt). I’m thinking of trying a swirl technique next time to achieve a more even distribution of cheese & apricot. Looking forward to making other variations of this. Raspberry anyone?!

I followed the recipe with the exception I made  apricot jelly out of dried apricots. for another recipe. I would just use appricot preserves and use a little more then stated.  Everyone raved about it . I did add more flour and butter for the crumble topping.  I also would add more cream cheese.
Thank you for sharing.

this was a good coffee cake .I did make a few changes .I replaced the apricot with wild Maine blueberry jam and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla to the cream cheese. I also didn't make the indents with a spoon I used a 1 tablespoon scoop for the cream cheese then dropped the jam next to it.
Next time I will add a little sugar to the cream cheese mix as its a little bland

I love this recipe! The only changes that I made are to use cherry pie filling instead of apricots. I use a small cookie scooper to distribute the cream cheese into about 24 dollops and then spoon 3 cherries (with filling) on each dollop of cream cheese. It is great. I also don’t care for the almonds so I omit them. I’ve also made this with apple and blueberry pie filling too! I think I love this recipe most because it starts with a cake mix and that lessens the amount of ingredients needed. It’s a favorite and it looks fancy! Be sure to refrigerate it after baking, since it has cream cheese in it.

Made this today.....it was deeeeelish!  I don't ever.....I mean never, ever use a box mix....only scratch baking for this gal!  But, my husband loves cheese danish.....you know the ones that every store sell.  So, I figured I'd give this a shot.  I did use extra cream cheese, no apricots, added a little cinnamon to the topping.  He loved it.  I drizzled a little raspberry jam, warmed in microwave on my piece.....yummy!  Will make again for sure.  Thanks for the recipe!
Okay, so it's Apple season!  I decided to switch this up a little.  I used a spice cake mix, followed with cream cheese.  I sauteed some sliced apples, then added a touch of sugar and cinnamon.  Put them over the cream cheese then added topping.  Hubby loved it!

I agree that this is more of a dessert cake than a coffee cake.  Then again one is using cake mix.  Flavor is good.

I loved it, will make it for special occasions.  Easy recipe, looks just like from a bakery.  I did use walnuts instead of almonds, and cut the cheese and milk in half.  I also used an old favorite glaze instead of the one in the recipe.  1 t. vanilla, 1/4 c. butter, 1 c. powdered sugar and just enough hot water to reach glaze consistency.  Drizzled on it just for appearance.  It is wonderful, even without the glaze. I made it in a 9x 13 glass baking dish.

Will make this again.  Only thing I would do differently is put some apricot juice into the cream cheese mixture and omit a little of the milk to compensate.  Would be even more tasty.

Made this recipe just as printed...except I finely chopped dried apricots and added to batter and omitted the almonds. Added milk to glaze instead of water. Very good, can't wait to have with coffee later.
