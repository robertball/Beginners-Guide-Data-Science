This is a very simple and delicious marinade for beef kabobs.  I cut the recipe in half for about 1.5 lbs. of meat.  I used olive oil instead of veg.oil, low sodium soy sauce, and dijon for the prepared mustard.  I left out the meat tenderizer, put everything into a ziploc bag and marinated it for over 24 hours.  I skewered the meat separate from the peppers, onions, and cherry tomatoes as they cook at different rates.  The meat was very tender and full of flavor - perfect with a side of rice.

This marinade is something else! My boyfriend and I made shrimp and steak kabobs tonight using this marinade. I only had about 4 hours to marinade but it turned out amazing. I can only imagine what a steak would taste like after 24 hours in this stuff. I wouldn't change a thing! I made a double batch and not only marinated the steak but also the shrimp, mushrooms, carrotts, and zucchini. I used a seperate bag for the veggies. Also, used a low sodium soy sauce and used as much as the recipe called for and it was excellent, not too salty at all. I would give it more stars if I could!

Guess what?  We tried it on venison. We cut back on the oil and rather than msg we used montreal steak spice for a bit more zip. All I can say is WOW!!

FANTASTIC!!  I doubled the recipe and let a combination of sirlion and chicken chunks marinate for several hours.  I reserved some to brush on while cooking.  I also used pineapple chunks, cherry tomatoes, green peppers, red onions, and mushrooms on our kabobs.  I cooked them under the broiler and brushed the kabob with the marinade several times during cooking. I will be using this again and again.

Made the meat very tender.  Very Good!
Next time I will add a little more spices.  My son and his friend just walked in and grabbed a kabob.  My son's friend said the meat is very flavorful.
After eating the leftovers my husband said to come back and change my rating to Excellent (5 stars).

I made this for my mom's birthday and everyone RAVED over it!!  Our neighbors were intrigued by the smell and so now I have to give out tons of copies of this recipe!!  What a hit!  I used about 3/4 cup oil and instant beef broth and seasoning mix instead of the msg.  I also used Bragg Liquid Aminos instead of soy sauce (they have the SAME taste and both are made of soy beans, Braggs is just way healthier). We will use again and again!!!!!

This recipe was amazing for beef kabobs! I used spicy brown mustard because that's all I had, and let it set overnight as it says. It was so good that I wanted to try it on something else. I chose pork in a slow cooker- it was way too overpowering. I guess I learned my lesson. Can't have too much of a good thing. ;) It Definetly deserved 5 stars with beef, and the recipe now stays with all my family recipes that I plan to pass on when I have children one day.

Excellent! Used this on cubed beef for our big BBQ and there were no left overs. We added red and orange peppers to the scewers along with a mushroom here and there. Instead of soy sauce I used Tamari Sauce since it's not as salty. I also made extra marinade for portabella mushrooms since my sister is a vegetarian. She absolutely loved them! It's great over rice! too!

Excellent!  I've only used chicken, and it's so tasty!  If you just marinate the whole chicken breast, it won't totally penetrate the meat.  It's better to cut it up...go for the kabobs!  Sometimes I use just a tad less soy sauce...if you have very small pieces of meat, they will tend to taste too salty.

This recipe is very similar to one my mom has used for years, but with Worchestershire and much more oil added.  The added ingredients made all the difference in the world.  The meat was so tender and delicious!  We are definitely going to keep this one.

There are a lot of ingrediants in exchange for little flavor.  The taste was "fine" but I didn't think it was all that flavorful.  I might add a little cumin or cayenne pepper if I were to use again.

Awesome! I cut the recipe in 1/2 since I was doing a smaller portion. And I only marinaded the veggies (zuccini, thai eggplant, mushrooms, bell pepper, red onion), as I was grilling hamburgers. I had less than an hour to marinade, but decided it was better than nothing. The veggies are amazing! I would imagine meat would be awesome too. Oh I didn't use any meat tenderizer, for obvious reasons,lol. Thanks for posting!

I was expecting a great marinade thanks to the few ratings I read that were 5 stars. I should of looked at the other ratings. I made this this evening, marinating the steak for 24 hours, and I was very disappointed. This tasted very salty like it was straight soy sauce. I followed the recipe to a tee. I definitely will not be using this recipe again...

I made this for beef kabobs and added 1/4 cup of sweet chili sauce. I also used dijon mustard and let it marinate for 4 hrs. It was amazing. I drizzled a little bit of the marinade over skewers of mushrooms, onions, red and yellow peppers and yellow cherry tomatoes. Even my children who normally don't like any of the vegetables loved it. This is a new family favorite!

I made this marinade for steak and chicken kabobs on mother’s day. The only changes I made were to use light soy sauce and no meat tenderizer. This is the best marinade I have ever tasted. My father already requested this for father’s day. I marinated the meat for 12 hours and boiled the leftover marinade from the steak bag to brush on the onions and peppers while grilling. Awesome!

I made chicken with this. I also marinated green peppers and mushrooms, both of which turned out really well! In the left over veggie marinade sauce, I also cooked pearl onions. The chicken was probably a 3.5.

My mother has made this marinade for shish kebab for over 35 years, back when it went by the name "California Marinade" on her recipe card. She added  1/4 tsp onion powder which I still do, and over the years found that using lower-sodium soy sauce reduced the saltiness (which we never minded!) and let the beef/chicken/pork/lamb flavor come through.  Really tenderizes the meat & tastes fabulous skewered & grilled with cherry tomatoes, zucchini medallions, onion quarters, white mushrooms, bell pepper chunks and even fresh pineapple.  Baste frequently with this luscious sauce & serve with steamed rice &/or fresh corn for a satisfying meal.

Awesome - hubby loved it.  I used this to marinade thin pork steaks and then brushed some of the marinade over the veggies (hubby thinks he doesn't like kabobs - but its the same thing, just not on the stick!  lol)  He loved this so much he said we will have to try it out on london broil - and the best statement "I would like to eat like this every night!"

Tried a million kabob marinades over the past few months. This was the ONLY one that wasn't overwhelmingly lemony. Really enjoyed. The apartment smelled great too.
Update: Made if for the entire family for NYE using cheap rump steak. The kabobs were absolutely melt in the mouth. Fantastic marinade. They marinated for about 5-6 hours

I use olive oil, squeeze a real lemon, and leave out the meat tenderizer. I also prefer low-sodium soy sauce because it gets too salty after hours of marinating, in my opinion. BUT this recipe has been such an awesome addition to my rotation of meals. Everyone that has it LOVES it. I almost always just use chicken and veggies (the mushrooms are fantastic) but shrimp are great, too! This is a standby Company Dinner for me and it's always a success.

This is very good!  I would have given it 5 stars, but I thought it was a bit too salty, as did other reviewers.  I will use it again, for sure, but I'll make an adjustment of low sodium soy sauce, or perhaps a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar.  I used it on rib steaks and grilled them.  Very yummy!

Thanks to all who have spoken so favorably of my marinade. I just love seeing all of your variants and trying them too. Now I too have taken so many others advice and have also been cutting back on the oil myself. Thanks, JON.

This was very tasty. I let it marinade for 4 hours and it was tasty even then! I did find the mustard taste to be a bit overpowering at first, but as I ate more, the more I enjoyed it. I am excited to use this marinade for a full steak!

This was very good.  We used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and lime juice in place of lemon (had no lemon).  It was very good on both the steak and shrimp we had, as well as the veggies, all of which we marinated in separate containers.  I added a raspberry/italian dressing to the veggies and shrimp, as we needed a little more marinade for the amount of food on hand.  Easy to make and good on everything. Thanks for sharing.

We doubled this recipe to use for shrimp kabobs.  We marinated them for about an hour.   They were delicious.   Our skewers had only the shrimp and we put 5 on each skewer.  We turned them once...cooked about 3 minutes.   Everyone loved them!

this really good... I cut the recipe in half and added 1/2 cup of pineapple juice and 1 tsp. of Citrus Grill Seasoning. Citrus Grill Seasoning is made by the Tone company. Sometimes you can find it at Sams Club. I had to buy it on the internet this time. Sams was out of it. Great stuff!

This marinade is the BEST EVER!!!  I made beef kabobs using this marinade and they turned out so good !!!!!!  Juicy and so full of flavor.  I highly recommend this to everyone.  I will admit, I am not a big mustard fan, but I had no problem with it in this recipe.  Its a must try recipe !!  Making again tomorrow for dinner.

We had a frozen cut of beef that was on the tough side...this marinade turned it into FANTASTIC, melt in your mouth steak on out kabobs.  I only had time to marinate it for 2 1/2 hours...I can only imagine it would be even better if I had more time to marinate it!  Will use again.  Easy, great flavor, tough steak turned to gold!

Flavorful! Reduced oil to 3/4 c, soy sauce to 1/2 c and marinated cubes of striploin overnight. I did use the Marinated Grilled Vegetables marinade for the vegetables on the skewers because I thought too much of same seasoning would be monotonous. The meat was fabulous - tender and flavorful. Will definitely be making this again.

Today I tried this recipe, I followed it to the tee. Expecting a wonderful flavor I was highly disappointed.I found it to be very salty and although it was ok on chicken it did not work with the beef.Surely there has to be something better out there.

Absolutely fantastic... I served these at a BBQ last summer and one of the guests who is a chef asked me for the recipe!  Didn't change a thing except marinated the veggies as well :)

I used this recipe to marinate a flat iron steak for about 4 hours.  It was delicious and my kids thought they were eating a very expensive cut of beef.  I'll use this marinade on many more recipes.

Great Recipe! Family's favorite marinade, and friends love it also. Dropped the MSG, and have had it on beef, pork and Chicken. Chicken seems to absorb the flavor the best. After marinading over night, I remove the meat, bring the marinade to a boil, then after it has cooled, use it to baste the kabobs on the grill. I have played around by adding 1/2 tbs fresh ginger, substituting 1/2 of the lemon juice with Pineapple, etc, but the original is great.

I have been using this marinade recipe every Christmas for the last two years when we decided not to do traditional turkey and ham Christmas dinner. It has been a hit with my whole family. That means 18+ people that come for dinner. Also use the same marinade for the chicken kabobs; gotta have chicken for the non red meat eaters.

This was a big hit at a recent barbecue. We used it to marinate tenderloin we grilled. Everyone thought it was awesome!!  I followed the recipe as written except I used less Worcestershire sauce. A quarter cup seemed to much for our tastes. We did marinate the meat overnight.

I cut the lemon juice back to 1/4 cup, omitted the pepper and msg. I added 6 more cloves of garlic for a total of 8, which I then put through a garlic press. I suggest using name brands to get best outcome.

I used this marinade at a neighborhood BBQ. Everyone asked for the recipe. I did make a few changes. I used 1/2 cup vegetable oil and 1/2 cup olive oil. I did not add the meat tenderizer. I marinaded my meat and vegetable in different bags and then used the extra veg marinade to brush as the kabobs cooked. Delicious!

I halved this for one pound of shrimp; after putting together the kebabs and before grilling, I also brushed some of the marinade over the veggies. This was very good. It was a bit salty, but since the shrimp had marinated and the veggies hadn't, it was really only the meat that was too salty. I am definitely keeping this recipe to make again!

This is a delicious marinade.  I use less oil (about 1/2 cup)  and dijon mustard.  Wow!  Everyone loves it and asks for the recipe!  I use boneless chicken thighs and tenders and marinade for 24 hours!  Don't marinade your veggies too long... the lemon juice starts to break it down.  After removing the veggies from the separate marinade bag, I boil the leftover marinade and put it at the table to pour over the dish!  I serve with Jasmine rice....Yumma!

This was delectable on the meat, but I didn't like it on the veggies very much (Ithink it was the mustard on them I didn't like).  Marinated the meat in it overnight and it was so tangy and delicious!

Unbelievable marinade as is!!  Here's a cooking tip.  Sear kabobs on a BBQ grill on high (don't let them burn).  Place kabobs in an oven at 350 degrees for about 10-12 minutes until done to taste.  Put kabobs on a bowl and pour the juices over them.  Let sit for 5-10 minutes and then serve (allows juice to go back into the meat).  Some of the juiciest, tastiest meat you'll ever have!!  Works very well with chicken and steak. Has a very nice smoky taste.  Some people even swore I used liquid smoke!

This was a wonderful marinade and easy to make.  Much better than the bottled ones.  Would probably be great on a whole steak instead of just kabobs.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Ecellent marinade, thought the ingredients were different so I was skeptical but it made the best kabobs I let it marinate overnight and used low sodium soy sauce and it was not to salty, next time I think I will try Dijon mustard! Thanks for the post!

Like other people have commented it is a bit salty after having this in the refrigerator for about 18 hours.  I'll try it again next time either using low sodium soy sauce or reducing the time in the refrigerator to 12 hours or less.  I used top sirloin for the kebobs but will also experiment with chicken sometime.

I found this recipe just about an hour and a half before we were scheduled to eat. So, my meat only had about an hour to marinate. I was quite pleased and probably wouldn't marinate it longer than that because the marinade is very salty and I think too much longer in it and the meat would have been too salty for our taste.  I made kabobs of steak, green pepper and pineapple and marinated both the pepper and the meat and was very pleased with how it turned out.

I LOVE this marinade. We have used on everthing from hamburger, steak and potatoes to zucchini. It is great on everything. We sometimes make a double batch leaving out the oil and cook it down to form a dipping sauce. YUMMMMMM! You sould definetly try this!

Great recipe!  This is so easy, as all the ingredients are already in my kitchen.  We have used it on almost every meat that we have cooked, and it turns out great every time.  We only use the tenderizer on cheap cuts of meat.

I tried this recipe with moose meat, and it was terrific. I used low-sodium soy sauce and made kabobs with the meat and some peppers and pineapple. Everybody loved it. I will definitely use this again.

I found this recipe when I was searching for something new to do with kabobs.  We love this marinade and have sinced used it on all kinds of meat, most recently on steaks that we grilled.  I cut back the oil and added just a drop of liquid smoke.  Delicious!  This recipe is a keeper.

This is pretty much all I use when making kabobs. Awesome flavor. I usually halve the amount of oil suggested and I don't really notice a difference in taste. I like to cut down on fat when I can. :)

Thanks for the recipe. This is a keeper!

We were disappointed... which completely surprised me after all the five star reviews.  I halved the recipe and marinated our 1lb round steak for 24 hours.  Tasted strangely sweet and very mustard-y (I used plain old yellow mustard because the recipe didn't specify dijon).

Scrumptious!  We used this marinade with skewers of tomato, onion, zucchini, red peppers, green peppers and mushrooms and basted it every 1/2 hour over a 3 hour period and then bbq'd them.  The taste was incredible!  (Didn't use any MSG)

This was really great. I made it for my parents and grandmother, and they all gave it 5 stars. I followed some other people's advice, and cut down on the oil. I also put Dijon mustard, and Montreal steak spices. It only marinated for 3 or 4 hours, and it added flavor to the meat without overpowering it. Really delicious!

We made this recipe with Steak and Chicken Kabobs and it was just wonderful.  Very nice mix of flavors.. even on the veggies.  I made up the kabobs and marinated the whole thing, skewer and all for 6 hours, and it was wonderful.  We had some leftover, and I just can't wait to have these after they've been sitting for 24 hours!

Loved this marinade! Adjusted for 2 people with hefty appetites n decreased the mustard a bit for fear the husband would be unappreciative. Was a lovely emusified tasty marinade that didn't overpower but complimented the beef! Thank-you so much for helping me satisfy a very particular husband!

Seriously the best marinade I have ever had!! I use it with steak, chicken, zucchini, mushrooms and onion. I put the meat and one Ziploc bag and veggies in another and let them marinate for at least 24 hours. My whole family loves kabobs made with this, it's our favorite meal!

This receive was too salty and too sour. It needs to cut back on the soy sauce, and lemon juice and proportionatly the olive oil.

This is REALLY yummy. My husband didn't know I was trying a new marinade and said "Wow this is really good!" When I told him what was in it, he said he was glad he didn't know ahead of time because he'd be inclined to think the flavors didn't taste good together. It's such an easy marinade and really flavorful. A go-to!

Used about double the amount of garlic since we LOVE garlic in our house!  Marinated veggies to go with burgers.  Excellent flavor!  We will definitely use this next time we have kabobs!

This was pretty good but I wasn't "wowed" by it.  With all the ingredients, I thought it would have more flavor.  Maybe it would be better if it marinated longer.  We marinated for about 8 hours.  If I made it again, I would marinate overnight.

Wonderful tasting marinade.  I halved the recipe (except the garlic) and omitted the meat tenderizer and marinated for about 7 hours and then drained and used the thinly sliced beef in a stir fry.  It was amazing but I think I would try to marinate for the full 24 hours next time.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I started following the recipe and after juicing 2 lemons I thought it was too tart. I was short of the amount called for, so I stopped with the juice of 2 lemons and added 3 T honey and 2-3 T sugar and omitted the meat tenderizer and instead used my manual meat tenderizer (has needles on a plunger that poke holes in the meat).

This makes a lot of marinade so I put about 1/3 in a bag and added red and orange peppers, vidalia onions, and thinly sliced zucchini. I cooked these in my grill basket.

I added the cubed meat in the bag with the other 2/3 of the marinade. 

Marinaded everything for 6+ hours and it was so delicious, kids went back for seconds :)

Yum. Just made this. Added a bit more garlic, a slash of red wine and a splash of Bovril. Replaced meat tenderizer with a  couple of teaspoons of Montreal Steak Spice as suggested earlier. Huge hit with the entire family!!

This was one of three marinade recipes we used for our recent kabob night (the others being Yummy Honey Chicken Kabobs and Marinated Grilled Shrimp) and it did not disappoint!  It was a nice flavor and kept the beef moist and flavorful.  We made it exactly as is and it made a ton!  We should have added more beef!

Did not care for the flavor of this marinade. I think it may have been the lemon juice because it had a "tang" to it that I just didn't care for.

Wow - that's good! I used it on 1.5 pounds of moose steak and 1 pound of chicken, letting it marinate for about 8 hours. For the last two hours of marinating I added onion and green and red bell peppers. I skewered everything separately for their own cooking time and served it over rice. The steak was wonderful but the chicken was out of this world yummy. Will definitely use again!

LOVE this. Marinade the meat it in for a few hours, and then brush it over the whole kabob during grilling to give the veggies great flavor too!

I've used this recipe as written multiple times to make Moose Kabobs. Easy to assemble and very tasty!  This recipe is easily converted into a Caribbean style marinade by simply changing the lemon juice to lime juice and adding fresh hot peppers...this works very well with shrimp and scallops!

This was very tasty! Used it for steak kabobs, and let the steak marinade for almost 24 hours.

Excellent base recipe! I changed the measurements to lower the oil and salt content. My recipe is halved for my 1.25 t-bone steak meat. This was the best steak we've had in a really long time! It's a great balance of lemon, salty, and tangy. It marinaded for only 5 hours. We also grilled the meat for only a few minutes since the lemon cooked it thoroughly already.

1/4 cup vegetable oil
Juice from 1 lemon
2  tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons any prepared mustard
3/4 teaspoon coarsely cracked black pepper
1/2 teaspoon onion salt
1 clove garlic, minced

This marinade was wonderful on steak and chicken.  Everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe.  I made one batch with regular yellow mustard and another with dijon and both were excellent.  Can cut down a little on the soy sauce if you don't like the meat salty and I also omitted the meat tenderizer.   Will print and keep in the family recipe book.

Awesome as written.  I found 4 hours to be plenty of time for beef sirloin.  Next time I might try reducing the oil by half.  I didn't find it TOO oily, but I think it might be just as good with less.

Yum!! Best kabobs I've ever tasted after using this marinade. Thank you for sharing. Only thing different I will do next time is half the recipe b/c it does make a lot of marinade. :)

The first time I tried this on chicken and instead of Worcestershire I used steak sauce - it got RAVE reviews.  Last night I used it as written on steak and it was great as well.

We love this marinade and make kabobs using it all the time in summer! I've yet to feed them to someone who doesn't adore them. We use it on chicken and steak in equal measure, and both are delicious!

I made with Sirloin kabob meat and peppers, onions, mushrooms and tomatoes.  Very tasty.  Easy to assemble.  I used 2 1-gallon zip-lock bags one for Veggies and one for meat.  Let them marinade overnight.

This marinade is really, really good.  I tried it several different ways, all simply mixed into a big plastic bowl with only 2 additions (a dash of Old Bay seasoning and a dash of cayenne) and then broiled on wooden skewers with chopped onion in the oven for 8 mins on each side: 1. cubes of beef from random thin grocery store steaks (marinated for 20 mins) - amazing 2. cubes of beef from random thin grocery store steaks (no time for marination) - still amazing 3. bite size pieces of chicken breast (marinated for 20 mins) - still amazing 4. bite size pieces of chicken breast (marinated overnight) - still amazing. Basically, use this marinade on either beef or chicken, with or without marination, and it comes out SO good even if you just use the oven broiler.  Enjoy!

Absolutely loved this..virtually followed to the T, aside from the optional meat tenderizer(which I don't have currently).  I used cubed top sirloin, marinated about 8 hours...couldn't imagine how good the flavor would have been after 24 :D.  My fiance', who is addicted to steak sauce on his steak, didn't need it.  I will use this more often, rather than buying a bottled marinade!

I have now made this recipe twice and it is terrific.  First time I followed it exactly, except for the meat tenderizer.  2nd time I used 1/2 the amount of oil and it worked just as well.  I always marinate my meat is a ziploc bag so I don't need as much marinade.

Delicious marinade! I halved the recipe and used it on bell peppers, onions, and shrimp. I marinated all 3 overnight and basted them while grilling. Will definitely make again!

Very easy to make and my family really liked the sirling kabobs I made with it. The amount of mirinade is more than is needed and could probably be halved and still be enough for 6 servings of meat. Thanks!

I followed all the instructions except did not add the meat tenderizer. Marinated deer steaks for 6 hours, this was amazing! So tender and great taste. Was leery about the mustard (yuk) but the flavors blend nicely and again tender! Will look no further for a marinade. Thanks for sharing!!

Great recipe, this is easily enough for 2lbs of meat and veggies. I used half the soy sauce and marinated the meat for about 12 hours, I brushed it on the veggies as they cooked

I thought this was a great starter for a marinade but I had to add my own touch to give it just a little bit more pizzazz. I add a splash of red wine,montreal steak seasoning and a splash of sesame oil. This turned my tough stew meat into kabob worth meat.
Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is excellent. I cut it down to 2 servings and use it to marinate london broil (aprox 1 1/2 lbs). It always turns out tender and flavorful. I also substitute low salt soy sauce, dijon mustard and leave out the meat tenderizer. This has been our standard and favorite marinade for over a year now.

This is the best marinade! I used country style pork ribs, and used 1/2 cup of soy and 1/2 cup of Worcestershire sauce. The 3/4 soy was a little salty. But awesome!

Excellent for Kabobs or Flank Steak. It's a bit too salty for regular steak

Shish kabob is one of our favorites for the grill, so I looked forward to trying this recipe. I wasn't disappointed; it was  fantastic. I used cubed chicken breast and sirloin. I've tossed my collection of other marinades and settled on this one.

Deelish.  I added a little hot chili paste and brown sugar.  I used green, red and yellow peppers, mushrooms, asparagus, and vidalia onions.  I let them marinate in the fridge for about 5 hours.  Yum!!!!  I can't wait to have these again.

My family and I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  I did not have lemon juice on hand so I used orange juice instead so mine may have been a little sweeter than the original but it tasted great anyway.  Thank you for sharing!

I thought these would turn out great because of all the great reviews so I decided to make these for a party we were hosting.  I marinated my kabobs over night but after cooking them, they weren't all that great and were actually really salty even though I had used low-sodium soy sauce.  They also were not a big hit at our party.  Not sure if maybe it was the meat I chose or I did something wrong with the marinade but I don't think I will try to make this again.

This was excellent, but a bit salty.  I will definitely make again, but the next time I'll use the lower-sodium soy sauce.

With the exception of using 1/4 c lemon juice and 1/4 c lime juice we followed the recipe and it was delightful.  We actually marinade more than we needed and used half at the bbq and then broiled the other bag later that night.  If the marinade sits for close to 24hrs the meat does get a bit salty but if you let it just sit overnight it is a perfect blend of flavors.

Very good. I marinated beef kabobs for a couple days and had with peppers and zucchini.  Cooked on the grill approx. 8 minutes on high.

YUM!  I made this with both chicken and beef.  I skewered the meats (seperatly) on skewers, and the veggies, green, red, & yellow peppers and red onion, on seperate skewers so that the veggies didn't burn, they came out sooo tender and tasty.  I was leary about the mustard, but they turned out great, Thank u so much Jon!!!!

VERY GOOD!  I would say perfect, but it was a bit salty, and we reduced the soy sauce to 1/2 c.  Next time I'll use a little less than that and try the low sodium soy sauce.  We marinaded chicken for about 6 hours, and it was perfect.  My husband raved all night about it.

After reading other reviews, I cut the oil to 1/2 cup and the soy sauce to 1/2 cup.  Next time I would cut the soy sauce a bit more as well.  I marinated 4 boneless chicken breasts overnight in a giant ziploc and then grilled.  I thought this came out wonderful.  The chicken was SO moist!!  I will most definitely use this again.

I took the advice of other reviewers and lowered the soy sauce to about 1/2 cup. Just added a touch more of the lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce instead. It was a huge hit at a BBQ we recently had. Everyone wants the recipe now.

We needed to use up some of our deer before the new season and we tried this recipe on some kabob-size deer sirloin skewered with pineapple.  It was outrageously delicious!  I plan to try it on chicken next.  Thank you!

My husband and I love to use marinades and love to grill.  We marinaded our meat overnight and thought this marinade compared to the many we have tried in the past was just too salty.  I did like it because I had all of the ingredients already on hand in my kitchen.  I just think it is too salty and not tasty enough to use on high quality meat.

This is definately the best chicken marinade we have ever made!  The only things we did differantly was using half yellow mustard and half dijon mustard as well as cutting the oil all the way down to 1 tablespoon.  There is no need for that much oil as this chicken has turned out superb everytime was have made it.  We usually just use whole chicken breasts, marinate them all day and then cook them on the BBQ. Awesome!

This wasn't my favorite, a little too sour for my taste.  Next time I'd definitely reduce the lemon juice.  I marinated chicken breasts and tiger prawns.  The prawns turned out too salty - not the best marinade for shrimp.

My husband loved it. I lessened the lemon juice and soy sauce a little and sat it in the fridge with my tenderloins for 24 hrs and it came out sooo delish! I would add a little more garlic and some spicy sesonings next time but believe me, altering this recipe is not needed.

Terrific! The only changes I make is that I put in half the amount of regular mustard, and the other half is a country dijon (grained mustard). Plus I add some Montreal Steak Spice in lieu of the meat tenderizer. Easy to make, and everyone raves about it.

This marinade is the best one we have ever tried - the combination of flavors is perfect, especially for kabobs.  We have tried several other marinades with some success, but nothing has been able to match this one.  Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe!!

Delicious!  I followed the recipie exactly (used fresh lemon juice) and marinated both beef tenderloin and chicken for grilled kabobs.  The taste and tenderness were perfect.  For the leftover meat, I turned it into a stirfry with rice and veggies and that was delicious too.

Wow! This marinade is awesome. We actually didn't use it on kabobs at all - we used it on a big T-bone and some chicken breasts that we grilled, and both turned out amazing. We have had terrible luck grilling in the past, but decided to give it a go again, and this marinade gave us faith that we can grill!! haha... great recipe, thank you. Excellent flavor, can't wait to try it on some veggies also.

This turned out delicious and went over very well at a recent family gathering.  We used steak and chicken and both were tender and tasty.  This recipe will be used again.  Thanks.

This was a great recipe, I used pork tenderlion and it turned out fantastic. I did not add the meat tenrerizer since I was usig a tender cut of meat. I made a half batch and it was plenty, I will make this again with all kinds of meat.

Extremely tasty as a meat marinade (according to my boyfriend), lovely on mushrooms (though don't leave it on very long), and wonderful as a baste on vegetable pieces, particularly tomatoes.  Thanks much for a tasty recipe.

This is still the best Kabob recipe I've ever made.  I've had to give it to many friends and relatives.  I do substitute Olive oil for the vegetable oil.  It's melds the ingredients together much better, and the taste is terrific.

Oh boy this was good. Good flavor and the meat just melts in your mouth. Reduced oil to 1/2 cup and the soy sauce to a little bit less than 1/2 cup. Make it, eat it, enjoy it.

I marinaded chicken breast I had cut in cubes for a "pot-luck" kabob night we had with some friends.  Our son got sick at the last minute, so my husband took this to the party without me.  He told me everyone raved and asked for the recipe.  I did make a slight change, I use 1/8 c. country dijon and 1/8 c. yellow mustard and did not use the meat tenderizer.  Will pull this recipe out the next time I need a high WOW factor!

FANTASTIC! This is the best recipe for kabobs. 1/2 the oil and montreal steak seasoning were excellent suggestions from other reviewers. Next time I will try marinading the veggies for a short period of time too.  Vidalia onions made these kabobs so very.

I decided to make steak kabobs for the first time and  used this marinade. I let them marinade for 8 hours and they were wonderful. My parents couldn't stop raving about them and they are not very adventurous when trying new things. This one in definitly a keeper. Thanks!

Yum, yum, yum!  I have used this marinade on chicken and steak kabobs, and both were delicious.  I also substituted various spices for the MSG.  I marinated the meat overnight and then a few hours before cooking, I skewered the kabobs with the meat, green & yellow squash, mushrooms, orange pepper, red onions & tomatoes and marinated for the last few hours.  They looked gorgeous and tasted like heaven--got me lots of compliments from guests!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great marinade.  We made kabobs with beef round steak and it really made the meat flavorful!  The lemon really adds a nice zing.  
Thanks for the great recipe Jon.

I’ve used this recipe about ten times now—always a huge hit with friends and family! My four year old calls it “steak on a stick” and she asks for this at least once a week. Let the steak marinate for a day (or two!) and you will not be disappointed.

I used this marinade for 24 hours on some tough cubed beef, & it definitely helped tenderize it.  BTW, I did not use meat tenderizer.

I used this for chicken breast. I marinated cubed chicken for 15 hours. Then grilled the chicken on skewers. There’s nothing special about this basic marinade.

Very good marinade. Even with the oil base the kabobs did not flame up too bad on the grill with low heat. Keep the kabobs moist by constantly brushing. I will be using this recipe again!

This marinade makes better than restaurant kabobs!
My family raved and I will definitely be making this once or twice a month during grilling season. Excellent!

Made the marinade two days before actually pouring over the kabobs.  Skewered all meat and veggies together (I used portabella  button mushrooms, green & red pepper, onions) and marinaded kabobs for 24+ hours. Grilled to perfection and turned out great. I left some marinading for an additional 24 hours and those tasted even better! Next time I make these I will definitely marinade these for 2 days as the meat was like butter! Excellent recipe! Thanks for sharing...........

Extremely salty without adding the salt called for. So glad it was just served as an appetizer on skewers. In addition, it lacked flavor.

Outstanding! I have made this twice to marinate veggies for the grill--yellow and red onions, mushrooms, bell peppers, zucchini.  No more dried out, tasteless grilled veggies. I subbed apple cider vinegar for the lemon the second time and still tasted great.

Very good!  Followed the recipe but just used regular black pepper,  no meat tenderizer. Used boneless beef ribs cut into chunks.   The meat came out very tender.  Took advice from another recipe and heated the remainder of marinade to a boil in small saucepan, then simmered for 10 minutes and used to baste the meat & vegetables on the skewers while grilling.  Will make it again.

This was excellent! I only marinated the meat for 30 minutes and then brushed the marinade on the meat while it grilled. The flavor was awesome! I actually took a half a bite, went "wow" and then made my fiancee eat the other half of the bite in case I got an anomaly! It was excellent and has become part of our routine.

We think the mustard was the odd item out.  It made the marinade a little more tart than we like.

I use this for the recipe for vegetables and Rosemary Ranch Chicken Kabob marinade for the chicken.  I use cherry tomatoes, onions, mushrooms, zucchini  and red, yellow and green bell peppers.  I marinate them in a gallon Ziploc for up to a day.  Same as the Chicken.  I skew the chicken and vegetables separately and BBQ on my Weber charcoal grill under indirect heat.   I've been using these two recipes for several years for all kinds of  events and it has been a hit every time.  The two recipes accent each other.

I made this without the Worcestershire, mustard, and meat tenderizer only because I didn't have those ingredients in my fridge.  It was still the best marinade I've made.  Sat in the fridge for 24 hours, the steak was flavorful, moist and tender. He vegetables were AMAZING. Define going to use this again but with all the ingredients next time.

I made this yesterday & it turned out so good! I used everything except the mustard & I don't have a grill so I just made them in the oven. I cooked them for 20 minutes at 350 & it was perfect. I saved the marinade & I'm going to try it with chicken this weekend. Great recipe!

My boyfriend made the marinade so I'm not sure if he followed the instructions exactly or if he made some minor tweaks, but the kabobs turned out super tasty! We used beef, onions, and green bell peppers. It turned out very good! Will probably be making this again.

I had everything on hand for this and was looking for a different way to make pork  kabobs. This was great for that! I marinated the pork chunks for only about 2 hours, which was definitely enough time. These turned out so good! I definitely will use this again since it's so quick to throw together and I usually have all of these ingredients anyway. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this exactly as written.   Wow!   I thought it might have been too strong or salty but my worries were unfounded.  This makes a lot of marinade.  I was able to marinade two thick steaks and a small roast  (top sirloin I had cut into thirds, so a relatively "flat" roast) for the entire day.   I served the kabobs along with grilled veggies (same as in this recipe but threaded onto separate skewers,) and an orzo, tomato, feta and basil salad from Mel's Kitchen Cafe, which probably is on all recipes, but I can't say for sure.   Oh my.   Talk about a match made in heaven.    Hands down, this marinade recipe is a keeper and my 'go to' from now on.  Thank you for posting!!

I followed the recipe by the book and the only change I made was 2/4 of soy sauce instead of 3/4 after I read somebody else's review who said that soy sauce has a lot of salt which is true. And also, I added more garlic since I love garlic. I made it for my daughter's birthday party, people were waiting for them by the grill after they taste them. Now everyone wants the recipe or want me to make it again. I have a friend who just called and ask me to make her a 100 of them. I will definitely make them again and make more next time.

I would have given it four stars, but found it a little lacking in flavor, until I added cumin and cayenne pepper (as suggested by one of the reviews). However, I did give it four stars, because the bones of this recipe are very good and lends itself to adaptation well. I used it on chicken and moose meat, and chose grilling as the mode of cooking. End product was delicious! So much so that I decided to marinate the whole bag of chicken for another diner latter this week.

I wanted a marinate that was different.  I did both chicken and beef but only had about 5 hours for the marinate to work.  It was enough time I thought.  My family loved the meat.  I used half olive and  half  salad  oil and added about a half teaspoon liquid smoke and a half teaspoon dried red pepper flakes.   It wasn't too salty for me and I still added salt to my own meat.  Next time I may add a little more red pepper for a little more zing.  I will definitely make this again.

Great tasting, easy, and inexpensive marinade!  I used this to marinade beef and vegetables for kabobs.  I made it a few days before, so the flavor was well established but not overwhelming.  The amount of marinade is generous, so next time I would not double the recipe to accommodate the vegetables.

I have used this recipe for many years and love it!  Along with kabobs and thick steaks, I frequently use it on thinly sliced sandwich steaks, peppers and onions, grilled and served on rolls for dinner. It's a huge hit with family and friends.

There was no 'raving' over it, no 'can I have some more?' and no 'what's the recipe?'. It's too salty with nothing striking about the flavour. I've found better recipes.

This recipe was AMAZING with chicken.  We made chicken, shrimp, red pepper, zucchini, and onion kabobs that were so good!  We sprinkled the veggies with the marinade just before the grill and that was great, too! The shrimp was a little on the salty side.

I used this recipe for hog, beef, chicken, and venison kabobs. It was absolutely DELICIOUS! Everyone who ate said all the meat was flavorful and tender. They keep asking for the kabobs again! Only problem is I need another hog!!!!
Zucchini, squash, onions, cherry tomatoes were excellent in the marinade as well!!!
I use this as my go-to marinade.

This recipe is so easy and turns out great!!  Only got to marinate for 3 hours but still turned out tasty.  If you save some of the marinade separately from the meat and baste the kabobs as you grill them it adds even more flavor. Love this recipe, my husband couldn't stop talking about these kabobs.

tried this recipe last night for steak and chicken kabobs.  My whole family found it very delicious. The flavor of the meats we're so savory and cooking on the charcoal grill added such a depth of flavor... I will definitely be using this recipe again and again !!!

Very good!  I put half the marinade in one bag and half in another to separate my meats and veggies.  I used super trim stew meat, shrimp, zucchini, onion, tomato, and green bell pepper.

I was only able to marinate for 2 hours and I hadn't realized I was out of prepared mustard so I had to use Dijon instead. I also marinated some veggies in it, separately.  It was DELICIOUS!!!

I used kind of a haphazard version of this marinade (not being super careful with measurements, and using ginger soy sauce in addition to regular soy sauce, plus garlic powder rather than garlic, and no meat tenderizer). I marinaded the beef and veggies (zucchini, bell peppers, onion) in separate bags, and only for about 2 hours. I bet it would have been even better marinaded for longer, but it was still pretty damned good! I skewered and cooked on my Cuisinart Griddler (closed) for 5 minutes on medium heat, turning every minute or so. Everything was really good, and the marinade worked well with the veggies and the meat (the mustard is a particularly nice touch). I just wish I'd had some mushrooms to add to the equation!

Followed this recipe exactly and used on chicken kabobs. Marinated for 8 hours. It was VERY good. Lots of flavor, smelled wonderful. It was a little salty, but it didn't take away from how delicious it made my chicken... Thanks! Will use again...

This is very flavorful. I like the addition of the mustard, I used dijon.  This will be our go to steak marinade from now on! Thanks for sharing.

I recently tried this recipe for both chicken and steak kabobs. I like to make recipes with ingredients I have on hand, but I didn't have any lemons at the time, so I added a bit of white wine vinegar to get the acidity, which turned out really well. I marinated overnight, and the meat came out really flavorful. I made kabobs out of chicken, steak, and bacon wrapped mushrooms that had sat in the marinade for about 10 minutes. Definitely a delicious combination!

Amazing recipe for beef kabobs. The only thing I changed was that I used olive oil instead of cooking oil. Marinated beef, shrimp and vegetables with this marinade and it was delicious.

I really liked this marinade!  I used low sodium soy sauce and only used less than 1/2 c. to watch the sodium in the marinade.  I added a bit more garlic as well.  I used this for both steak and mushrooms on kabobs and they were delicious!

We loved this!  I did adjust a bit to make a smaller portion, and used quite a bit less oil to cut down on far, but it was a great base recipe.  We used it to marinate the veggies we used too, and that was a great addition.  Make sure to use it for your mushrooms, those were my favorite!

This was excellent.  The only changes I made was I cut the oil in half (1/2 cup) and used olive oil.  I added 1/2 cup water since I cut some liquid.  I also used some garlic powder and 4 frozen garlic cloves.  For the mustard I used dijion.  It was all I had.  I marinaded over night.  Everyone loved it!  I put mushrooms and onions marinaded for 15 minutes with a little oil, garlic powder, salt and pepper on the sticks.  YUM!

Absolutely delicious.  Reminds me of kabobs my Mother used to make when I was a kid (don't have the recipe).  I've made this a few times now and it's always a hit with my boyfriend and our guests. Thank you!

Excellent easy to make marinade that really puts some flavor in your kabobs. Even if you only have 1 hour to spare on marinating time, this will still work great. This recipe consistently tastes good every time I make it.

Very tasty! I added less than the recommended amount of soy sauce, because I was afraid it would be too salty per other reviews. Also, I only had limes on hand so used lime juice instead of lemon juice. It was good, so I think next time I will make it the same way! Marinated cubed sirloin for about 8 hours, and reserved some marinade to baste over veggies on kabobs while grilling.

Did not have meat tenderizer on hand but meat very tender after 24 hours of marinating. A bit too salty for us (despite reduced sodium soy sauce) so might adjust soy sauce next time.

Yummy! I made this with sirloin, and both I, the hubby, and the guests loved it--the meat was very tender and flavorful. I was a  bit put off by the mustard at first, but it all married together for a great treat.

I doubled the recipe and had more than enough for a pound a salmon, 2 pounds of steak and 6 cups of vegetables.

I only used half of the soy sauce as that's all I had.  It still turned out wonderful!

Love it! I made these for a picnic and it was nice and flavorful. I used the cheap beef cut used for stewing and it was wonderful and still tender since I let it marinade over night. FYI...discard of the marinade bc it's not so pleasant smelling on it's own :)

Excellent.  I marindated chicken, cherry tomatoes, red and green peppers, button mushrooms, and red onions for about six hours.  I served over rice pilaf after grilling until chicken was cooked.  I will definitely use it again.

I didn't have cracked black pepper, so I subbed for regular black pepper and this marinade still came out wonderful.  I used it with cheap marinating steaks and they were as tender and juicy as filets!  Yummy!

This marinade is very tasty!  I used it the first time i made shish kabobs.  The meat really tasted of the marinade...and it was very good.  Just be sure you get really good meat!  Mine ended up being hard to chew because it was tender enough/or had too much fat throughout it.

Excellent!!  The flavor is just awesome.  I didn't have fresh garlic, so used some garlic powder instead and omitted the meat tenderizer.  It was great and will definitely make again!

I let marinate for 5 hours.  I only had about 1/3 cup of soy sauce left, so that's all I used and I was afraid it wouldn't be salty enough, but it was.  I also used 1/2 cup of olive oil, didn't miss the other half.  I will use this marinade again.  I might try it on beef next time!

Delish! Everyone at my BBQ loved it, even the vegetarians (who ate marinated BBQ veggies). I followed other suggestions on this site to cut down on oil and use low sodium soy sauce and it turned out great.

DELICIOUS!!!  This marinade kicks...  I used sirloin and marinated for close to 3 hours.  I also tenderized the meat with a fork.  Came out perfect.  I marinated my vegetables in italian dressing, which was really good, but next time I will marinate everything inthe kabob marinade.  Try this one, you won't be disappointed!!!

I use this marinade frequently for chicken kabobs that people love! I don't use the meat tenderizer and I substitute olive oil and prefer low sodium soy sauce. Otherwise it's perfect. I like marinating the veggies with the meat (it makes for great mushrooms!). I serve this with spanish rice. Delicious!

This was a hit at my home.  Best when marinated for a long time.  I baste my kabob's while cooking so this delicious flavor penetrates the veggies too.

Fantastic!  Had everything in the cupboard - a plus!  I used it on chicken kabobs and only marinated the pieces for 2 hours.  Also marinated the peppers and onions.  It's a great marinade that I will pass on to many!

WOW!!!!  This is the best marinade I have ever come across!  My husband loved it; even my pickiest son loved it!  I did only use 1/2 cup soy and the juice of 2 lemons.  I can't say enough about this delicious marinade!

This was excellent!  I had some chicken breasts to use up so this was the ticket.  I let them soak about 3 1/2 to 4 hours and then grilled them.  I served them on Kaiser rolls and they were loved by all.  A definite keeper!

This was really awesome. I didn't know how well it would go with pork as I didn't see any reviews for that, but it was great. I used olive oil instead of vegie oil, just because it's a preference. I also used a little less soya & doubled the garlic ummmm good :)

Was tasty but I agree with others that it was a bit too salty. I'll cut back on the soy sauce the next time I make it.

My husband loves this marinade!  We made kabobs for guests and they all loved it too.  The only things I changed were the oil, I used 1/4 cup and only used about 2 tbls of yellow mustard.  We used top sirlion and marinated for about 14 hours in a vacuum sealed bag.  It was a hit and we will be using this recipe often. Thanks for posting it :)

This marinade was very tasty.  I made it for the first time for guests (always a risk) - it was very flavorful.  I marinated my steak overnight and the only thing that I didn't like was the next day there was a layer of film on the meat and top of the bowl.  I had to spoon it out before getting the kabobs ready.

This is quite a tasty marinade for beef and chicken shish kabobs.  I marinated top sirloin and chicken breast in this marinade for 24+ hours.  I saved some marinade for basting once the veggies were added to the beef on the skewers.  13 minutes on the gas grill was perfect.  The nicest thing about this marinade was because there was no "sugar" in it (i.e. honey), there were little to no flare-ups on the grill.

This was fantastic!  We marinated the meat for our kabobs with this... changes I made were to use 1/2c veggie oil, a little less than 1/2 c soy sauce, a little less than 1/2c lemon juice, and used Dijon mustard instead of regular.  The meat was delicious!  I just wish I could have convinced the hubby to let me marinate the veggies too!

I would have given this marinate 10 stars but that just wasn't an option. I used it to marinate sirloin steak and mushrooms for my kabobs and left it in the fridge for about 4-5 hours. I couldn't have hoped for a juicer or more flavorful kabob. I will definatly try this again with other meats as well.

This was nothing but fabulous! I am so excited about this recipe because it was effortless to prepare. I had a bunch of fresh chicken breasts that I had to use up so I made the marinade and let them sit for 24 hours. Then grilled them. Next time, I will not add the Accent seasoning because I think the salt was a little bit too much, however, this made the most delightful grilled chicken sandwiches, salad meat etc.

Fabulous marinade for kabobs!  Forgot to marinade the steak ahead and only sat it in the marinade for about 30 minutes.  Everyone at dinner party loved them!  I did use the dijon mustard instead of yellow and used tender grilling steak.  I'll be using this recipe everytime I make kabobs!

This is GREAT!!!!  I marinated, in separate ziplocs, steak, chicken and veggies (zucchini, yellow squash and egglpant slices).  I did use less oil than recipe called for, added more garlic, and used Grey Poupon -- I also altered the amts - eyeballed them.  A keeper and will definately make this one again.  Thanks for sharing, Jon!!

VERY GOOD!  I marinated steak for 24 hours in this recipe and it was so flavorful, I didn't have to add anything after cooking (I usually have steak sauce on the side).  We made kabobs and added the marinade to the veggies.  The only thing that I did different was use dijon mustard instead of yellow mustard.  The mustard was not overpowering, just right actually.  Will use this recipe again and again.  Thanks!

Excellent! I used the dijon mustard as suggested by another reviewer, and I also added some fresh rosemary and thyme which really added a ethnic flavor. Won rave reviews from the whole family, the kids especially loved the "meat on a stick"!

I made this for boneless pork chops, marinated tham all day while I was at work.  My husband grilled them and we both thought they were fantastic!  I didn't have meat tenderizer and used chopped garlic, and they came out great. Looking forward to trying it on other types of meat as well.

Very good - made with chicken and shrimp.  We cooked in a pan on the grill and found that leaving some marinade with it during the first part of cooking helped keep the flavor.  The whole family liked it - made it twice this week.

This was a great "tasting" marinade! It made the meat taste good, but it was chewy...It may have been the kabob meat that I used, but all in all it had a great taste! Thanks!

Very flavour, very delicious.  I had made a separate marinade for my vegetables.  So the skewer had two separate kinds of marinades - one for the beef, one for the vegetables. It was a great combination. Delicious.

Good, brings out the flavor of the food and is not an overpowering marinade.  First impression I was somewhat worried about how it would taste, but was somewhat impressed.

Tasty and quick to make.  A little on the salty side.
Great for chicken, but needs wine to tenderize beef.

My family gave me rave reviews for this easy marinade.  I took Jon's suggestion and used venison with fantastic results.
