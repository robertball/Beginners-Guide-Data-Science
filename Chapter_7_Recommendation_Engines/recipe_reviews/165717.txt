I really like these, but they definitely took longer than 7 min--on both sides.  And I just fixed my grill today, so I know its not my grill.  Of course, I am careful to cook pork all the way--raw pork isn't good.  Anyway, I've forgotten how much I prefer sausage burgers to hamburgers, and I really like the combo of flavors in this--the spices in the pork and the toppings.  Very delicious!  I halved the recipe and got 7 burgers out of the deal.  Now I'm told I make small burgers, but I still think that the recipe as written would make more than six.  Thanks for the recipe!

The best pork burger I've ever had.  I pan fried them inside instead of putting them on the grill, and they turned out to be excellent. Although I didn't have the sherry so I replaced it with teriyaki, and I also added  a tbsp of brown sugar and 1 tsp of crushed red pepper.  The pork I had was also from a wild farrel hog which usually taste gamie, but the flavors hid the wild taste.  I will use this recipe for the rest of my life when it comes to making pork burgers... Mmmmmmmmm.

Excellent. A huge hit with the WHOLE house. The only things I did differently were to use spicy pork sausage, add a little sesame oil, and use thinly sliced celery on my bean sprout-hating boys' burgers. LOVE them, thanks!

no bean sprouts or water chestnuts but it was so flavorful!!  Cut back on the soy sauce - just a little too salty.  I also made homemade sweet and sour sauce from this site.  I also added sprinkling of sesame seeds to the meat mixture and a touch of sesame oil!!  Used green onion as the onion. add white pepper for heat.

This is such an original and tasty burger recipe.  Really enjoyed trying these last night, hubs grilled them to perfection!  I did half the recipe and did make a couple of deletions and additions.  Besides halfing all of the ingredients, I added a shot of Mae Ploy sweet chili sauce and a dab of hot Chinese mustard to the meat mix.  I found the mix pretty wet, but formable, so I skipped the breadcrumb and egg.  I let the patties set up in the fridge for a good three hours before grilling.  I used sweet and sour sauce with a little sweet chili sauce and a squirt of hot chili sauce, heated in the micro, to top.  Yummy!  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR.

'Followed the recipe except for using ground pork. 'Liked it, didn't love it.  I think I'd like this combination of flavors in pork cubes or slices rather than ground in burgers, even just not formed over rice.  I made twelve large burgers.  'Surprised they didn't shrink like beef.  A nice Asian sauce would've "clinched" the flavor.  It was a little ambiguous.

A decent, original burger that is relatively healthy compared to some others with this amount of flavour. The water chestnuts were a great addition! They took the recommended time to cook for me (in response to the other poster) - I did heat the grill up to medium-high, as recommended.
