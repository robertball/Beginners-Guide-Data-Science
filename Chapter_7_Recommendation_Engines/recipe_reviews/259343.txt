This is delicious! Due to a severe dairy allergy, I substituted vegan cream cheese for the real cream cheese and when I had fresh spices, I put those in it instead of dried.  I merely did this out of dietary requirements and what I had on hand.  I LOVE the bright green color too. 
Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!
