This soup is a great way to incorporate a variety of veggies.  I didn't have zucchini so I used a small crook neck yellow squash which completely fell apart and blended into the soup so nobody even knew it was in there.  3 cups of broth was not enough, I used a quart and then still added a bit more water.  Rather than open a can of evaporated milk for just 1/4 cup I used cream.   Thinking about it, I could have probably added a whole can of evaporated milk and had a really creamy soup.

Wonderful soup! I didnâ€™t have smoked paprika so I used 1/2 teaspoon chili powder and 1/4 teaspoon cumin. Served with cooked cubed turkey kielbasa for protein.

Great  recipe for vegetable lovers but can be adjusted to your taste buds.  Husband kept saying how delicious it was! . I added 12 ounces of Kale, only 2 Russet potatoes, broccoli florets with cauliflower florets, all other veggies per recipe except Zucchini. Added seasonings per recipe but included   Turmeric, 3 cloves garlic). Used chicken stock and added  Greek Yogurt for milk (I don't keep the other around) when veggies softened.  Used a potato masher to blend all together as husband is master of the Blender - not me! Will make again!
