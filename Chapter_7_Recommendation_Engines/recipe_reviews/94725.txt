I made this dish for family on Thanksgiving. It was a hot. I did not know what temp to bake the stuffing, so I chose 350 degrees for 35 minutes. The only thing I did different was add Old Bay to taste. You cannot cook crab and shrimp dishes in Maryland without Old Bay.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner.  It was excellent.  Seafood lovers were very impressed and non-seafood lovers enjoyed the dish. I will make this again and again.

I was worried about the green pepper being to overpowering for seafood, so I sub'd a clove of garlic and a tiny bit of basil. I halved the broth and sub'd the cream of mushroom for crm of chicken, only using half. This was as close to perfect as I have tasted. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this one Thanksgiving and it has now become a family favorite.  It is very good.  I do a few things differently.  I use red and yellow peppers instead of green.  I like the taste of them better.  I also mix regular bread crubs with cornbread crumbs.  This is also very good.  A great dish.

It appears the directions are missing 1 TB sugar as specified in the ingredients list, as well as the temperature of the oven. I'd love to give this recipe a try, but I'm not advanced enough as a cook to be able to guess at either one and expect the stuffing to turn out all right.

My god, how moist can a stuffing be?  I only added half a can of the condensed mushroom soup and left out the chicken broth entirely, and the stuffing was already decently moist.  Not to mention that this turned out to be much more of a casserole than a stuffing.
This recipe was pretty good, but not outstanding.  Next time I make this I think I'll boil some cubed potatoes then add them as well.

Great with a few modifications. I subbed c/o/m for Cream of celery. Instead of using canned chicken broth I used the broth from boiled chicken. Since the stuffing mix consists of dried bread crumbs I used about a 1/2 pan of corn bread to make the consistency less "gummy"

Excellent recipe. The family is begging me to make it for Christmas. I use red and yellow peppers (more flavor) and garlic as well. Yum!

Great recipe. We used to make this and serve it as a main meal. The original recipe called a seafood casserole. Whatever it's called, it's delicious.

Baked @ 350 for 30 min.

Only change I made was to use red bell pepper - milder taste. 

Beyond Awesome.   My husband loves this SO MUCH.  He talks about it with reverence.   :)   Guests have begged for our leftovers.    This is a hidden gem, sure to become a family favorite, especially if you have seafood lovers in the house.     If so, up the amount of seafood just a bit.   They'll go bonkers.

I made thing recipe tonight. I'm a cook so I knew how to put it together with a little more and a little less here and there. The key is to make the stuffing to your liking, as you would normally be it wet or dry. I like mine a little more wet. Thanks, I love it!!!!!

I made this two years ago for Thanksgiving.  I was suppose to take it to a relatives house for Thanksgiving Potluck but after my family sampled it at the house it was almost gone and they wouldn't let me take what was left. Just delicious.  I followed the recipe and adjusted liquid to the consistency I like. I used the temperature on the stuffing mix bag to cook.  Thank You for sharing this recipe.  I am going to cook it again and serve it with halibut/haddock or salmon at Thanksgiving this year.

This recipe is great. We have seafood night every few months. I am always trying to add new textures and dishes to my recipe box. I did not use the shrimp, but my family still loved it and had seconds. My children, especially my 2 year old loved it.

I used: Stove top stuffing ....                          Sodium
              Cream of mushroom soup....           Sodium
               Low sodium chicken broth....MORE         Sodium
Way too salty for our taste.  Will not make again.

This is excellent, everyone loves it, we make it every year for Thanksgiving.  In the trinity we use both red and green peppers (it adds a nice pop of color), for seafood we use 1/2 lb of each, large shrimp, king crab, and large sea scallops, cut into bite sized pieces, no sugar,  no chicken broth, 3/4 can of cream of mushroom soup, and 2 tsp old bay seasoning, for the stuffing we use the stove top cornbread box and 1/2 cup homemade bread crumbs from taste of homes seasoned breadcrumb recipe

This recipe is definitely an instant favorite! I had been looking for an easy as 1-2-3 seafood stuffing for some time.  

I did make some changes, but only to tailor to my family's personal flavor preferences.  Here's what I did differently....

1. I used butter instead of margarine
2. I used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom (I love mushrooms, but am not a fan of the soup)
3. I omitted the sugar completely. 
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I made this dressing last year and it was a hit. Everyone enjoyed it and I had a request to make it again this year. I also added imitation crab meat to the recipe and made actually corn bread into the mix as well.

This recipe was really yummy. I seasoned my shrimp w garlic powder and Tony's Chachere's.  I also made the dressing w Jiffy corn mix  because I did that, I added a bit of thyme and also a bit of smoked paprika , salt and pepper to give it a more savory taste. I did not add sugar as the Jiffy mix is already sweet. Last I added just a bit of shrimp boil. Will make this again

I found this recipe last year and it is amazing! I substituted the crab with crawfish tails (the frozen bag from Walmart) and it is amazing! This seafood stuffing has been a must at the last 2 Thanksgiving dinners and it's definitely staying!

I did not include the sugar and I used 1lb. of shrimp. Because I like my stuffing firm and crispy on the top and around the edges, I baked it for 45min. to 1 hour on 350 degrees and broiled it for 5 minutes. My family really enjoyed this recipe and I will definitely add this to my favorites!

I used vegetable broth and red bell peppers. I also used the a little more broth because I didnât want it to dry out. I baked it for almost 45 minutes. It was delicious.

It was Yummy. I substituted the cream of  mushroom soup with cream of chicken and added a box of jiffy cornbread.
I cut them into squares and since my husband doesn't eat dressing, I was able to freeze portion sizes and will have it as a side dish for my fish and whatever this week. Thanks for the deliciousness !!!!

This was an excellent recipe for Thanksgiving! I baked it at 350 degrees for 35 minutes. I also added about 1/4 cup dry sherry, and Old Bay seasoning (to taste) and used maybe a little over a cup and a half of the chicken broth. Yum!
