I use only the bacon grease to cook everything in and I pre-cut my Apple Wood smoked bacon before I fry it. I use Apple juice and apple cider vinegar instead of the Balsamic vinegar and I use Sherry wine instead of sherry vinegar. And I just put the whole Thyme stems with leaves on in and then all I have to do is take out the stems when finished cooking.  Saves time.

I tried this the first time and doubled the recipe to 3 pounds of bacon. I ended up with 2 1/2 pints. I gave most of it away but savored what I kept for myself because this stuff is pure gold! Fantastic recipe!!

I haven't tried this yet, but it sounds great. I wish people who change the recipe and then give it 3 stars would refrain from rating unless they made it exactly as recipe calls for.

My family absolutely adored this little wonder! We have had it as a topping on tomato pie, with eggs and as a topping for our grilled summer burgers. The house smelled amazing while it was cooking. You should really try it exactly as written. I did have to use red wine vinegar in place of the sherry vinegar but everything else was exact. Thank you Chef John. I will definitely have to make again.

I made this jam and thought it was a little on the sweet side. I realize now why. I followed the directions to the letter I thought, but after reviewing the video again I see that I did not use 4 yellow onions I used 1 huge sweet Vidalia onion since that was what I had at the time. I'm sure yellow onions would make a world of difference. I am going to take what I have prepared thus far and add 2 cooked yellow onions to it and see what happens. wish me luck!

This makes a great topping for some sandwiches, baked potatoes, mixed with a little cream cheese and stuffed inside a chicken breast. The possibilities.... This was a great find

Everyone really loved this!  I served it with sliced baguette that I toasted with a little garlic butter.  Does anyone know how long it will keep in the fridge? As usual Chef John is awesome!  Making his lasagna for a Christmas Party on Sunday!

OMG! OMG! OMG! This is the best appetizer to pass my lips, ever! Trust me, it is not hard, but it takes some time to make. SO.............worth it. I think I was afraid I would burn it, so it took me quite awhile to make. Once I turned the heat up a bit, it went faster. This is DELICIOUS. Coudos to Chef John AGAIN!

I made Chef John's Bacon Jam pretty much as written.  I didn't have sherry vinegar, so used apple cider vinegar, and I added 1/4 cup black coffee and 1/4 cup water instead of the 1/2 cup water.  I used 1 large and 3 medium onions, so the onion ratio was just right for my taste.  I ended up with two half-pint jars full, plus a little extra for tasting.  Next time I'll probably only use half of the thyme, but it is delicious!  I'll be making this again!  Thanks, Chef John!

I have not yet tried this recipe but it is bacon! To fuzz13 I would suggest a bacon jam omelet or maybe on a baked potato. Will be making soon.

I used more like 2 pounds of bacon, dried thyme, and sherry wine. Cooked for longer than instructed, trying to get 'brick red' color. SO good. Would it be illegal to just eat this with a spoon?

Fabulous. Great on a burger. Pair it with some blue cheese or goat cheese and pears on a baguette or puff pastry.  Pour a fine red with it...old vine zin would be my recommendation. Divine!

Despite my minimal adjustments, this recipe is rock solid. I used apple cider vinegar which was what I had on hand. I had a fig flavored balsamic, which added flavor. Next time I would use maybe 2 pounds bacon to compete a little better with the onions. Yellow onions, as the recipe indicates, is a better choice than Vidalia as it is plenty sweet enough. Thick sliced bacon cut into one inch lengths makes cooking and chopping a lot easier.

This is a fave. Made it 3 times now,  but replaced the brown sugar with 2 TBS of maple syrup. I usually use red onions, too. It always seems sweet enough.

Amazing and addictive! I made as written with the exception of using red wine vinegar since I didn't have sherry vinegar on hand and did not use butter or olive oil, just used extra bacon grease. I know, not so healthy, but hey, it's BACON! :) Next time, I'm going to try it with apple cider vinegar because it was just a little bit too sweet for me.
I do believe this is what my food loving friends and family is getting for Christmas this year! I brought some to work and my coworkers really loved it!

I made this recipe for my hubsand's valentine's day gift!!! It is amazing!!! I only used two very large yellow onions and 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and two tablespoons sherry wine because that was all I had! It was still awesome with those changes. I also loved that it wasn't super sweet or barbecue like. My husband is one happy guy right now :-)

This is an amazing recipe.  The only comment I have is that the prep and cooking times (at least for this home cook) are way off. It takes at least 90 minutes from start to finish-but worth it. Just plan ahead.

This was defiantly a hit. I used a food processor to get it to a finer texture. This is going in the cookbook binder to be done again.

The only things I changed was to add more brown sugar used a mix of apple cider vinegar. My family ate it out of the jars with a spoon. I'm a goddess in this house now.

This was certainly time consuming (took me about an hour and a half) but the end result is delicious. I cut the bacon into little pieces before cooking so I could cook more at one time. Even in a large frying pan I still had to cook it in two batches. Four onions seemed like a lot so I used three. Even after caramelizing/reducing there were way more onions than bacon so I only used half the cooked onions. I used apple cider vinegar instead of sherry vinegar and only did 1/2 tsp black pepper. Otherwise I followed the instructions exactly. When it was all finished cooking, it was good, but I wanted a spreadable jam and this was very textured. I put it in a blender and pureed it until it was a thick spread consistency. I actually thought it was better this way because all the flavors  were better incorporated. 

I will definitely make this again and probably give it as gifts.

Wow!!!  What a fabulous recipe.  This is decadent, it’s so rustic but the complexity and the depth of flavor really elevate this dish.  I doubled the recipe and brought this as appetizer to 2 Thanksgiving dinners and got rave reviews, it vanished.  By doubling I probably had a scant quart of the finished jam.  My only exception was to use 6 instead of the full doubled 8 onions.  I served with crunchy rusks, soft pita triangles, a wedge of port wine, spicy cheddar and added 2 sliced green apples.  This is not difficult but it does take some time,

Why did I wait so long to make this?!  The recipe is easy and the results are phenomenal!  Would be great on burgers, steak, chicken, pork... even cardboard!  Definitely a keeper.

I know it's a jam, but being that bacon is supposed to be the star I was super disappointed at how non-bacony this was. I was craving a spreadable bacon, but the bacon was completely lost in the sugar onion thyme and even the vinegar.  None of the extra ingredients bring out the flavor of the bacon they just totally overpower it. The entire thing was so overwhelming I could barely eat it.  Next time, I'll only what I need to add in order to make the bacon spreadable and focus on making the bacon shine.

Quite interesting!  First off, I don't see how you could make it in 45 minutes ... took me about 3 hours from start to finish, so plan ahead!  "4 large onions" puzzled me, but in the video, he says that's about 3 pounds.  Because of other comments about too much onion and not enough bacon, I doubled the bacon, using 3 pounds, but left everything else the same.  Finished product was wonderful - just a very different flavor.  Made this for Christmas appetizers, so haven't really eaten it yet except to sample it.  Plan to serve it as a topping on crostini with a cream cheese smear.  With doubling the bacon, I yielded about 4 1/2 pints.

This is good but in my opinion, a LOT of work. Either make it for yourself or for someone you really love because not only is it time-consuming, it's also a lot of ingredients that cook down to a fraction of what you started with. I didn't have sherry vinegar so I used rice vinegar. I also didn't have cayenne so I used sriracha and it was very good.  I bet it would be great on grilled cheese sandwiches.

This was very yummy. I decided to make it as a birthday gift for my bacon loving husband. I've never had "bacon jam" before so maybe its my expectations that left me somewhat disappointed. But I think "onion jam" would be much more accurate. The bacon was definitely not the star.  It still tasted good but just not as I hoped.  Honestly if I make it again I will double or maybe even triple the bacon. Overall everyone enjoyed it.

I followed the recipe as this was a completely new idea. We were at a pot luck dinner and I brought it and everyone raved about it.  It did involve a lot of stirring and waiting but it was worth it.  It was exciting to hear what folks had to say about it.

I doubled the batch as I was making gifts for this afternoon.  I had some leftover apple cider that I used instead of water (mostly to add flavor and to use up the cider).  At the end, I found out my balsamic vinegar had gone bad.  I used an infused blackberry ginger vinegar that I had on had and it was a fabulous extra layer of flavor.  I did use my immersion blender to breakdown the onions into more of a jam texture which also helped to reach that brick brown color a bit faster.

I will certainly make this again! 
Did things a bit differently (caramelized the onions more before adding the bacon which I pulverized in my food processor) but essentially stuck to the recipe. 
It was awesome! I did add a touch more brown sugar and an additional splash of balsamic. 
I plan on using this on grilled burgers this weekend, and I wanted a bit more of that sweet/sour thing going on. 
This stuff is good enough to just eat with a fork LOL 
As usual: great job Chef John!

Sooo delicious! I had to make a couple of adjustments - I didn't have any thyme and I had to use a balsamic glaze instead of plain balsamic vinegar because that's all I had.  Even with these adjustments, it is amazing! It is supposed to be for an appetizer tonight, but I am having trouble not just eating it all with a spoon right from the bowl!

I love this recipe but only gave it 3 stars because I had to adapt a lot. I made six batches, which yielded 24 pint jars, so I got really good at adapting when necessary. I precut my bacon before frying like someone else suggested plus used 2 lbs per batch so that the onions wouldn’t overpower the recipe. The onions made so much liquid during sautéing that I had to drain them after that step.  Since I still had too much liquid and wanted this to be more like jam, I added molasses and dark brown sugar plus more light brown sugar.  And, if you like more zing, add chopped jalapeños and “Texas gunpowder.” The sweet and salty ratio is perfect.  Turned out fantastic! Great Christmas gifts from the heart!

After reading other reviews, I opted to use apple cider vinegar in lieu of sherry vinegar in my bacon jam. Really enjoyed that the various flavors come through in the final product. Will make this again!

Made this to top off my cheese stuffed poblano peppers we took to a party. Couldn't have been any better. People at a party were raving about it and I shared the recipe multiple times. Only 2 tweaks I had were palm sugar for brown sugar (because we were out) and some butter in place of some of the bacon drippings that my wife started to dispose of while I wasn't watching.

The first taste of Bacon Jam I ever tasted was at the Granite City restaurant in Kansas City, MO. They use it in their BTA grilled cheese sandwiches (Harvarti and cheddar cheeses, tomato, avocado and bacon jam). It was the best sandwich I had ever eaten and I was determined to find a recipe so I could make my own bacon jam and BTA sandwiches! I love watching Chef John so I thought I'd try his recipe. I didn't have sherry vinegar so I used a little sherry and red wine vinegar as a substitute.  It turned out perfect!

Love this recipe! I used 2 lbs of bacon and red wine vinegar since I didn't have sherry vinegar on hand. I added more cayenne because I like a good kick. It took me longer to cook down than the recipe described, but otherwise perfect. Great on egg sandwiches and grilled cheese!

I want to be fair in my review and say that I'm not a huge bacon fan.(yes - we DO exist!!!)  
I like bacon - a couple slices with breakfast or some bacon bits in salads, but that's about the extent of my affection.  I don't like bacon flavored things or meats wrapped and cooked/grilled in bacon.

That being said, I didn't love this recipe.  I really wanted to.
At first I thought it was too sweet, then I realized I had forgotten the salt.  I added it after it had turned brick red and then thought it was too salty (maybe you're not supposed to do that?).
Anyway, I can't say for sure that Bacon lovers will LOVE it, although the rest of the reviews seem to point in that direction....but, if you're not a huge fan of bacon, then this may not be for you.

OK, since everyone raved about this, I made a double batch and it's still on the stove getting nice and brown. It smells amazing!

I love the idea of this recipe. I was recently in Savannah, GA & had dinner at a great little place out of the main area. We had a beef mash that sounds very similar to this recipe. Please rate, if anyone has tried it with beef. Or maybe Chef John will try it & let us know!!!

Have not tried this exact recipe but have had a similar one.  A local restaurant serves a burger with peanut butter and bacon jam. Not exactly low cal but worth the experience.

I hate to do this as Chef John is my fav on here and I’ve loved and 5 starred every other recipe but must say this is “ok” and lacked that “oh my, wow” factor that I found tweaking another recipe that used small amount bacon grease to cook onions in and used strong black brewed coffee and water and simmered until reduced to jam consistency.  Add balsamic vinegar after take off heat and promise it’s the wow that is expected with a name like bacon jam.  I will be posting it here if anyone wants to try, give feedback and compare although I will otherwise always bow to defeat of my beloved Chef John and still a loyal follower. Pic of my recipe

The end result, after a certain amount of work especially preparing all that bacon, is wonderful. I’m a fresh preserver/canner, so looking for it to look like jam threw me off lol so I just cooked it for 12 minutes before adding balsamic and evoo.. thriller

I made this recipe the first time I made bacon jam, the second time I tried another that had more sugar and strong coffee in it. Next time I will make chef John's again, it was definitely better, but will add 1/4 cup coffee for part of the liquid, it gives it a nice flavor. I froze what I didn't use or give away, it comes out tasting just as good!

I recently tasted Bacon Jam at a great local restaurant in Augusta, GA on a charcuterie and cheese board. So naturally I wanted to make some for my own boards. I followed the recipe with the exception of using white sugar and molasses for brown sugar. I doubled the recipe so it took much longer. Just cook it slowly until onion is unrecognizable and jam thickens. Delish!

Wow... this is so yummy! Lots of room to modify to fit your tastes.

Made it to top a nice bbq'd steak. Was also amazing on the potatoes.

Then today after work I topped a slice of Brie with the jam and heated it just a bit in the microwave.....OMG! To die for.

My bacon had too much fat and made the "brown brick" jam look more marbled. I am going to try to can this and water bath it for 180 minutes. I was disappointed that the cover picture shows this in jars, but does not give any instruction on canning it for future usage.

Another excellent recipe from Chef John - I used home made Bourbon Bacon, and added 1/4 C. Bourbon (of course) to this recipe in place of the vinegar..... but only after making this recipe as is.

I only had raspberry balsamic vinegar on hand so I added zest of one lemon and 1/2 orange and 3 cloves garlic smashed. Using this recipe as the base you can run with your imagination.  Thank you.  Cat

Whether or not this recipe is worthwhile depends on what kind of cook you are.  If you're excited by the nuance of a dish, and it's wine pairings, this isn't for you, however if you're looking for elevated, DIY, Superbowl kind of food, then this is for you.  I did not care for it.  I felt horrible eating a pound of a half of bacon after spiking my insulin with bread, a cup of brown sugar and more, additionally, the heavy sweetness of the dish, paired with the oily appearance and nature gives it an unhealthy, unclean image.  This is good, but in a Manwich kind of way.  I'm going to see if I can create something of a bacon pate and refine the flavors a little in the future.

What's not to like, it has bacon!! I recently had a burger at a local pub that had bacon jam and I just knew that I was going to have to make some. I didn't have sherry vinegar so I subbed white wine vinegar and used strong coffee instead of the water for a little extra flavour. Amazing and very versatile, thanks Chef John for another winner.

We are in France so I used Lardons instead of bacon slices as we cant get them, and I am not sure if that's what has made a difference but there is nothing jam like about it, not even sticky with an extra slug of sugar in desperation!! Tastes nice, but its basically turned out as fried lardons with onions and brown sugar! I really wanted this to work as it has so many great reviews, but for me it just didnt!

This is awesome! I can think of so many uses for this jam. I used  smaller sweet onions I had in hand and no Sherry vinegar so used the apple cider vinegar. Otherwise followed the recipe. Great flavor!!  I ended up freezing it in an airtight bag because it was to be a gift in a couple weeks.  Hoping that doesn't ruin the great flavor or texture. Suggest getting a better quality bacon too.

This recipe is one of the greats. We used it on homemade pizza, and were told that it was unparalleled, by all who ate. We attributed the compliments to Chef John's Bacon Jam, and even had our guests watch the video (which they thoroughly enjoyed.)
