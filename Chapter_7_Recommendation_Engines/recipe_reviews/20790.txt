The tip one of the reviewers stated on being watery had me grate and lightly salt the cucumbers before using. After 30 minutes wrap in a paper or regular towel and squeeze out the excess water.  This worked really well - just remember not to add the salt as stated in the recipe after pre salting the cukes.

Where I live there is this delicious Greek restaurant that is famous for this dip.  They serve it with hot pita bread and feta cheese and it is excellent.  This stuff tasted just like it, took me ten minutes to throw together, and kids don't even realize that their eating cucumber, onion and garlic.  I used parsley instead of mint. This is a keeper!

This is exactly like a recipe i've been using for years. There's no need to add oil like i read in other recipes. I changed it a little bit, i add 1/2 teaspoon dried dill and 1/2 teaspoon mustard. I also prefer to crush the garlic instead of using it chopped (don't like to find bits of garlic), and better wait till the cucumber is completely dry if you don't want your sauce to be runny. What i do is to grate the cucumber the day before and allow to drain in paper towels overnight. This is good for d√∂ner kebabs, sis kebabs, mashed potatoes, salads, as a veggie dip,.....

I took a tip from another reviewer which actually works anytime you don't want watery cucmbers. After you chop or grate the cucumber add salt to them and then let them rest on papertowels to get the water out.  You can even give them a good squeeze if you don't do that the yogurt or sourcream will be runny. I used 1 tsp. of dill weed instead of mint and served this with Souvlaki.  We loved it.

seeded the cuke and threw it into the food processor.  Placed salted cuke in a collander and weighted it down for about 1 hour to leech the juice out.  This came together nicely.  Added just a touch more salt and a squirt of lemon juice.  Only had dried mint and used 1/2 tsp.  Let it sit for a while for the flavors to come together.  It was not 'soupy'.  Served this with 'gyro burgers' for a nice complete meal.  I like this recipe because it makes enough without a ton of leftover to get pushed to the back of the fridge.  thanks for the nice recipe.

Great recipe! I prefer mine more plain and I just use Greek Plain Yogurt from Trader Joes and cucumber and a dash of dill. I also eat this with Naan Indian Bread which tastes like pita bread. I can't get enough of this lately........I also shred my cucumber ahead of time to reduce the water. Using thr greek yogurt helps because it is more thick too.

It turned out quite good! (The only suggestion I might make would be to add a little bit of all-purpose flour to the finished product.  I found it to be very watery once the cucumber was added - the flour helped to thicken it up a little.)

This was amazing Tzatziki! I used Yogurt-Cheese to make it even creamier and thick. We used it as a side dip for roast lamb. It was fantastic and even better the next day when the flavours melded together. Yummy!

This recipe is really nice. I reduce the garlic to 1 clove, and use fresh dill in place of the mint. I grate 1/2 of the cucumber on the smallest part of a grating box, and the other 1/2 on the largest, then squeeze out as much liquid as possible in paper towel. It's very close to my fav. restaraunt's recipe! Woohoo!

Great recipe! I substituted dill for the mint and also pressed the cucumber in paper towels to drain off the excess water.  This is great for lamb burgers!

Very tasty with toasted pita pita triangles. I shredded the cucumber and then added the salt and left to drain out the excess liquid for about 30 minutes - it is surprising how much water comes out. The finished tzatziki had perfect consistency.

Followed advice about cucumbers and it worked like a charm. Some water did come to the surface when stored in fridge - but just carefully poured it off (just like I do with natural yogurt!). Exactly what I was looking for. Fresh mint from my garden - yummy.

Perhaps it is runny because regular plain yogurt was used instead of the much thicker Greek strained yogurt? I used Greek and had no problems at all.

Be sure to drain everything or you'll have a soupy dip.  I used dill because we prefer the taste.  This recipe is my husband's new favorite!

It tasted really really good, next time I'll omit the salt as it was just a bit too salty for me.  We also added some lemon juice for extra punch.  I had barely 1/2 tsp mint leaves so I used what I had and it definitely could have used more.  I also used only 1/2 cucumber, shredded and dried thoroughly with paper towel.

Okay, I didn't have any mint, which I don't particularly like anyway. So I left it out. And it was so good we ate it on quesadillas, as a veggie dip, on grilled chicken, my husband will eat it with plain bread. Be sure to let it sit, it's even better the next day.

We served this with lamb chops. The taste was good, but we found it way too runny. If I make it again I will use greek yogurt and/or drain it a bit first.****Made again using Greek yogurt and salting and draining the cucumbers (2 of them)-it had a much better consistency.

very good recipe once you make a few changes... you definitely need to strain the yogurt and cucumbers.... tzatziki is so much nicer when it's super thick! :D  i also added more garlic, but i think that's a personal taste thing.

I didn't have mint or cucumber. So basically I ended up with garlic flavor yogurt. I added extra garlic to compensate. My coworkers are not happy with this development.

I've been to Greek restaurants that can't do tzatziki this well!  I followed the recipe to a "T", except at the end I squeezed a quarter of a lemon in and some salt to taste.  Awesome!

great sauce for lamb, beef, sandwiches and veggies/salads!

Very strong garlic flavor.  If you are not a big garlic fan you might want to put in less.

I let the sauce sit overnight in the fridge to let the flavor really sink into the yogurt.

I chopped the cucumber instead of grating as I like a chunky tzatziki; and as others suggested drained both the yogurt & the cucumber pieces before mixing up the dip.  For me, two cloves of raw garlic is too much for the amount of yogurt, and it could have used more mint.   A splash of lemon juice would not have been amiss, either.

Great recipe I did. I live in a area full of Greek restaurants so I know what this usually tastes like I also have a friend who is Greek who makes the best tzatziki I've ever had I showed him this recipe and the only change he gave me was to do half and half yogurt and sour cream this came out great. From reading other comments I did grate the cucumber and drain it before adding everything else which made it great. This will
 Definitely go into my regular menu.

I use Greek yogurt instead and it was too sweet so I guess that is where I went wrong? Had to add some lemon :)

Great recipe! I've read a couple other reviews that suggest to lightly salt the cucumber and set on paper towels to get some of the water out... If you would rather add the salt at the end like the recipes calls for, do what I did. I lined the bowl I shredded the cucumber in with a paper towel and then patted the top dry. It came out perfectly! Also, I substituted dill for the mint.

Great and so easy! Would add a bit of lemon juice next time.  Definately go with the mint over parsley.

Great recipe.  I used the exact ingredients, but have some comments that could help improve the quality of the texture.  (These suggestions came from the owner of a local mid-east restaurant, who offers tzatziki on her menu).   Instead of grating the cucumber after seeding it, simply cut into smaller pieces.  Gratiing it necessitates the draining / pressing out of the water that accumulates (otherwise the yoghurt is watery).  Also, the recipe doesn't specify the type of yoghurt, and most tzatziki recipes include the time-consuming step of straining the yoghurt in order to thicken it.  However, I used plain Greek yoghurt (now easily obtained at local grocery stores -- in my case Albertsons), which is already thick and the perfect degree of tanginess.   One more comment about the garlic:  I bought peeled whole garlic cloves, and realized they were probably 25% larger than cloves on a typical garlic clump that I usually buy from the store.  Thus, my family and I thought the recipe was slightly too garlicy.   It is of course a matter of taste, too, but in the future I'd adjust the quantity of garlic accordingly.  Overall, it was delicious.  Our family (including children aged 8 and 10) love dipping it up with pita bread and eating it that way -- the same way I enjoyed it as a child.

I used only one large fresh garlic clove, and the Fage 2% Greek yogurt (this makes the recipe) I used was 7 oz. instead of 8 oz. I "eyeballed" everything, but I used one really good farmer's market fresh cucumber, peeled and seeded and fresh mint from the garden. I didn't add anything to the recipe. I did put the grated cucumber into a couple paper towels and to squeeze out the extra moisture. The Greek yogurt I think is what made this so good. I don't think it would be nearly as good with regular yogurt, so I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.

Made with fresh cucumber and mint from the garden, this was amazing!  It was a little runny, but we started with runny yogurt, so we were doomed from the start.  Still - so, SO tasty.  I will be making this again.  Often.

I lived in Athens for several years and was taught to drain the excess moisture from the yogurt using cheese cloth.  And never used salt, just squeezed out excess moisture from cucumbers. The amount of garlic is up to your own taste,  I used 4 or 5 cloves.  Add just a touch of olive oil.  I never used the mint in mine, but it is usually used.  Great with vegetables, bread and meat.

I took the advice of one of the raters and added salt to the cucumber to remove water. This was a good idea, but I did have to add more salt to the sauce. Since I'm not a fan of cucumbers, I used a 5-6in. cucumber and added about 2t of mint. This recipe is decent but I'm probably biased b/c I don't like cucumbers - I prefer another Tzatziki recipe from this site (which uses dried dill instead of mint and cucumber - it's great).

This didn't really do it for me.  Granted, the only other tzatziki I've had has been in restaurants, and I was hoping for the same level of flavor that I'd had before.  This recipe didn't have it.

Excellent! I had only about 2.5 hours to drain the yogurt and it worked great.  We used this as a dip for pita triangles.  The kids didn't really like it but the adults loved it. Will definitely make this again.

This is awesome!  I used 1 clove of garlic instead of 2, dried parsley instead of mint, added a squirt of lemon juice and strained the cucumber.

Yum!  Some tzatsiki recipes are more time-consuming as they require that the cucumber be strained out, but this recipe is just as good and is much easier.  The only change I made was that I squeezed the excess water out of the cucumbers.  In my opinion, the mint really makes this sauce.  I serve it with the Gyroll recipe also from this site.

Not worth the effort.  Did seed the cucumber and sauce was not runny.  This was just a waste of time
