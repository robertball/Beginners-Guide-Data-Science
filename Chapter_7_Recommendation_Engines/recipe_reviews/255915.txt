I thought these were great.  Simple and different way to have deviled eggs. I used jarred salsa, which was fine, but fresh would have been better. I added a little more sour cream.  I topped with dried cilantro.

It was good but I wound up adding paprika paprika, extra sharp cheddar, salt pepper and a little Texas Pete.
