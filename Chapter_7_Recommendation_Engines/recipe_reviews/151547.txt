I'm confused, I've been using the recipe from the Campbells website for years and I've never heard of cooking the chicken first in a skillet, the thing I loved about this recipe was that you can throw all the ingredients together in a few minutes and throw it in the oven. It makes a meal that goes a long way and every one seems to enjoy, the only changes I made was I added onion and garlic powder to the chicken, I've had rave reviews, Here's the original instructions off the Campbell's kitchen website. "Heat the oven to 375Â°F.  Stir the soup, water, rice, onion powder, black pepper and vegetables in a 2-quart shallow baking dish.   Top with the chicken. Season the chicken as desired. Cover the baking dish.  Bake for 50 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the rice is tender. Top with the cheese. Let the casserole stand for 10 minutes. Stir the rice before serving."

This is a GREAT recipe. Very easy and tasty. I boiled the chicken in water and cooked the rice and veggie's seperate. Then when the rice was done i cut up the chicken in bite sized pices and added it to the rice. And melted cheese on top! I also mixed in garlic, onion, and paramasan cheese. GREAT RECIPE!!!!

I used the ingredients as listed here, but baked them, covered, in a casserole dish, as suggested on the Campbell's soup can.  The rice and veggies were thick, creamy, and tasty, but the chicken was a bit dry.  Next time I might try cubing the chicken and mixing into the casserole, rather than leaving them on top.

My mom taught me a recipe similar to this except she cooks the chicken and rice separately. Then adds the soup and broccoli to the rice. She then puts the rice mixture and chicken in a baking dish and tops it with cheddar cheese and then throws it in the oven. Very tasty!

This is an old standby - my mom used to make this but she always took a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix and sprinkled half in the rice and the other half on the chicken - that really perks up the recipe and adds tons of flavor. Frenchs onion mixed in the rice and top the chicken is another good addition.

This recipe was ok. I took the suggestions to add in a couple more things. However, following the recipe my rice was undercooked and brought the meal down a bit. Next time i will cook the rice and veggies separate and also skip the oil for the chicken.

It didn't have much taste, even after I added some extra seasonings.  Too bland.

The ingredient list looked a little bland for my family, so I sprinkled the chicken breasts as they were browning with onion powder, garlic powder, seasoned salt and black pepper to taste.  My family loved it.

My mom used to make this ALL the time when I was younger so I absolutely love this combination. And it is SO easy. I usually do put the chicken in a skillet first just to brown the top and bottom and then let it cook through while baking. And I also cook the rice a little bit before putting in the dish to bake.

I made this for dinner tonite and I put my own twist to it. I sauted finely chopped onions and garlic and added to the chicken browning in pan. I substituted chicken broth and a few splashes of dry white wine for the water. I used different veggies cuz I have some that don't like broccoli. I used corn, peas and fresh mushrooms. This was absolutely fantastic!! Thanks so much!!

I liked this receipe. I grilled the chicken w/ extra virgin olive oil and garlic. I cooked the rice by itself and added mushrooms with the fresh broccoli. I also added red pepper flakes and more pepper. I also used 3/4 cup cheese and added it when I pulled it off of the stove. Topped with parmesean. It was pretty good.

This is delicious! I made it a little different though. I cut up the chicken into cubes and mixed in sharp cheese instead of putting it on top. Me and my sister are in competition about whose cheesy chicken and rice is better. I think this recipe is definitely the winner!

I've always loved this recipe, but I had never heard of making it all in a skillet. So I contiuned to brown the chicken but I mixed the rice, soup and broccoli in a casserole dish and topped with chicken and baked at 350 for about twenty mins or until rice is tender and chicken is done.

In order to cut my cooking time down, I put the chicken breasts in my George Foreman grill and just browned them, about 5-6 minutes. I also didn't have white rice on hand, so I used a package of Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice (original recipe) using the seasoning packet and added the frozen broccoli, soup and water to that in the baking dish. Put the chicken on top, cooked for 25 minutes covered with foil. It needed 10 more minutes but was done perfectly. I didn't add cheese. It didn't need any.

I made this as suggested and thought it was a bit bland. So I made the following changes and my family and I thought that after the changes this recipe was wonderful and we will be making again.  I changed to American cheese and bought slices which I tore up into pieces and put on top of the chicken pieces.  I also pounded out my chicken pcs to about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick uncooked.  I used long grain Jasmine rice and 1 bag of california mix vegetables.  No paprika. I sprinkled with bread crumbs and italian seasoning the last 20 minutes.  Because of the Jasmine rice I did have to cook it about an hour and 20 minutes but I baked with foil on it the first hour then took the foil off and put the bread crumbs on.

I wasn't horribly impressed. I didn't care for the instant rice. So I think I will try it again and just get a little creative with it..

i followed this recipe and it does work, you need to add time at the end to cook the rice. i think about 15 minutes on a low simmer. stir every 5 min or if it's a non stick it makes a mess. monitor rice till cooked.

I really like this recipe BUT we change up the vegetables and add a lot of seasoning-we used to do carrot and broccoli but we have a broccoli allergy now so we do peas or something else with carrots.  We also bake in the oven like a reviewer recommended.  I heat oven to 375.  I stir the soup, water, rice, onion pwder, black pepper, garlic powder, and any other seasonings we want (we are allergic to nightshades so we don't do paprika and because of modified food starch which is potato starch in the soup I do homemade cream of chicken soup instead) in a pyrex casserole dish.  I top with the chicken and if it's thick I cut it in half to make it thinner so it cooks quicker.  I cover with foil then bake for at least 50 minutes but usually it's more like an hour and 10 or hour and 20 until the rice is tender and then top with the cheese and let stand 10 minutes.  I stir the rice and veggies well before serving.

Such an easy quick week night meal. I cut my chicken into bite sizes pcs. Added garlic and onion powder to it while it cooked. I didn't removed it, just added everything in with it when it was done. I used part chicken borth and part water. Will make again.

I used chopped Rotisserie Chicken and just threw all the ingredients in the pan and cooked it like soup.  I had a can of Fiesta Cheese Soup I wanted to use up so I replaced this with the cheese.  I also used 3 cups of broccoli.  Very quick and easy recipe that was tasty over rice and with bread!

I tried this and I was not impressed at all. Maybe I'll try it again and redo some things but the first try was not good!
