I made this, but didn't have any peppers or fava beans (I would have substituted frozen soya beans or tinned chickpeas for them, but I was out of them as well). Since I don't like hot dishes, I substituted peppercorns for the red pepper flakes as well. I also added some quorn chunks, as I had them out to make another dish before I decided to use this recipe. It came out "okay", but not really so special, and a bit over-tomatoey. Since we had enough left for the next meal, I added spinach to it, as well as paunchparum spices (a combination of fennel, fenugreek, corriander, cumin and mustard seeds) roasted in some oil. And this time it was very yummy. I know that I've perhaps altered the dish beyond recognition, but it did turn out fine and I'll probably do it again.

So flavorful and filling!  I cheated a little bit by buying Harissa Paste from a store.  And to let the flavors blend even more, after I sauteed the onions and garlic, I put everything in a crock pot on low all day.

Wonderful and so healthy.  I took a short cut and used store-bought harissa paste, though unfortunately, the store-bought did not have all the spices included here.  Don't be afraid to use the anchovy which is not evident in the finished dish. I have added these to other dishes and it helps deepen flavors. It's an umami thing.

I used store-bought harissa but otherwise followed the recipe as written. Delicious! Next time I'll try leaving out the anchovies to see what that does to the flavor.

I had all ingredients on hand, except the pomegranate molasses. I like spicy food, but I decreased the two tablespoons of red pepper flakes to one tablespoon, and the stew was spicy enough. I did NOT add extra salt. The anchovies provided enough salt. I used a seeded acorn squash and left the skin on for color. I cooked the stew for the recommended 90 minutes and everything was very tender and yummy, but I kept the pan covered. My stew would have been too dry had I cooked for 90 minutes uncovered. The consistency was perfect over GABA brown rice! Definitely, a keeper recipe! Thank you!

I thought it was very flavorful and filling.  The next time I make I would only use one TB of molasses (I only had regular) as it was to strong in the after taste for me.  I  also added a packet of Sazon.
