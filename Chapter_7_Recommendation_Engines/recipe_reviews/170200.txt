It's a great recipe, but if you've never cooked with scapes before, you wouldn't know that you need to cut off the white (flowers) from the stems before using it. It made for a very strong pesto.  I added basil to my recipe to take some of the bite out of it but I can't seem to tone it down enough for my taste

This stuff is amazing.  I recently discovered Garlic Scapes and now prefer this type of pesto to a traditional basil pesto.  Because the flavor is so strong, I use less Garlic Scape pesto and a batch of this will last much longer than regular pesto.  Since I can only get garlic scapes from the farm in early summer (locally) - I make up a lot and freeze it to use for recipes during the winter.  Once you make this - you will not be disappointed!

Fabulous! I did half the olive oil. I got more garlic scapes through my CSA, so I plan to make more to freeze. Yum!

This was a great way to use garlic scapes. the pesto was delicious on bread, pizza, veggies, and pasta. We also froze some for later!

Great recipe but I agree that 3/4 cup of oil is way too much! I used 1/2 cup and will probably start with 1/3 cup next time. Also, used all Parmesan cheese and added some fresh spicy basil. Easy and delicious. Too bad it's not low fat!

great recipe - except the garlic scape flavor was way too strong, so i added spinach and chard (and more cheese, oil, and nuts) to tone down the flavor.  it turned out great! i also didn't have pine nuts, so i toasted pecans and walnuts and used them instead.

My family loved this. I used pastacio nuts instead of pine nuts. Didn't have Asiago cheese, so I used cheddar and Jack cheese.

Excellent recipe. I substituted roasted squash seeds and added a few basil leaves. Make sure you remove the flower head before using (the bump part way up the stalk.)

This is an excellent recipe!  I also got my garlic scapes from my CSA and didn't know what to do with them. The recipe was a little spicy for me, so I just increased both cheeses by less than a quarter cup, perhaps an 1/8th cup. It was perfect for us.  This can also be used for topping steak/chicken or kahlrabi

This made just the right amount to freeze in one ice cube tray.  I did take out one of the "cubes" before it was frozen and tossed it over some pasta.  My 2 yr old ate it, but no one else really cared for it.  I've read that it mellows after freezing, so I am hoping we'll like it better if we try it in a few months.  I'm giving it 4 stars for the benefit of the doubt.  For now, we'll stick with sauteeing our scapes in eggs and veggie stir fries.

This is a very good recipe and freezes well. I used to use pine nuts but because they have become so expensive, I substitute them with sunflower seeds.

Peppery, garlicky, cheesy and fresh. Wow. I followed the ingredient list moreso than the actual recipe - I'm a big fan of cooking to taste. I didn't have any asiago and I went the extra step of toasting my pine nuts. Thanks so much for the recipe - I would've never thought of pesto. But its got me thinking about it as a pizza sauce, a sandwich spread, bruschetta topping...

As someone who would just throw butter and cheese into any pasta I make, I quite enjoyed this pesto sauce! I grabbed the last batch of garlic scapes since they were going to be out for the rest of the year. Very fresh and easy to put together. I read somewhere that to get a more milder flavor from the scapes you blanch them in boiling water first. After reading a few comments about how intense they are raw, I decided to do that first. Other than that, everything else was followed to a T. I am already planning what I'm going to do with the rest of it!

This recipe is absolutely amazing! I made this recipe last year and froze it in jars, unfortunately it ran out way too early. I made some for gifts and people were just raving about it. I used walnuts and pine nuts because pine nuts on their own were too expensive and omitted the Asiago. I highly recommend you try this!

This is SO easy and SO good!  I’ve never made anything with garlic scapes before so I figured I’d give it a try.  Had it over pasta the first night but tonight I made some kale greens and stirred about 1 tablespoon of the pesto into it.  Added a little lemon juice, a little Romano and red pepper flakes- YUM!!  Very healthy and so delicious! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made a double batch. I really liked the combination of Parmesan with Asiago cheese. 
I doubled my batch which would have called for 1 1/2 cups olive oil. As I like it thicker, I cut back to about 1 cup of olive oil. We love it as a base on toasted bagel & egg sandwiches!!!

Decreased the olive oil to 1/2 cup, otherwise made as directed. LOVED this! Had some on gnocchi with a little crumbled duck bacon- delicious! Will definitely make it again.

This is a very good recipe. Adding the fresh Asiago cheese adds great flavor. I use the entire garlic scape, white tip and all.  My only recommendation is to puree/pulse the garlic scapes first prior to adding the rest of the ingredients. I also added a little more oil for a creamier version. This recipe freezes very well.

I didn't have pine nuts, so used walnuts which was a great substitute.  Let me say, this is VERY pungent and rich.  My husband liked it.  It's a nice side dish.

I made this recipe today for the first time. Very easy and great tasting. My scapes are just becoming ready to harvest. I did add some fresh basil to it. We loved it. Used it as a spread in place of mayonaise on a sandwich with roast beef. Delicious. Will harvest more over the next few days and freeze some.

My husband and I liked this a lot. My 3 year old, not so much. I used pecans, because I had them on hand. I used extra cheese as another reviewer suggested. It was yummy.

So delicious!  The recipe was great as written, but I didn't need to add any salt thanks to the parmesan cheese.  This was the perfect way to use up all the garlic scapes the CSA gave me!
