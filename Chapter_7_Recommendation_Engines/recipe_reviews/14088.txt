Actually, this is a fantastic salsa.  The reason I gave it 3 stars?  Because 5 serrano peppers is INSANE and I wanted to make sure others knew that before they prepared this.  Not knowing anything about serrano peppers, we lost all sensation in our heads when we ate this salsa for the first time.  And believe me, we eat habaneros every day so we know hot.  Perhaps you are not supposed to use the seeds, but the recipe doesn't say that.  In any event, we have found that 1 and 1/2 serranos is fine when using the whole pepper.  If you have something to prove, try 2.  :-)

This recipe is good. It needs at least 1 large fresh clove of garlic though. Also it is crucial that you get quality ingredients. Tomatoes from the garden are best but romas from the store work well also. I used a hothouse variety from the store the second time I made this and they were mealy. Beware that this salsa makes a lot of liquid in the bowl. If you like it great if not use in a soup or on veggies. THIS RECIPE DOESN'T NEED 5 CHILIS. I USED 1 SERRANO CHILI AND GOT PLENTY OF HEAT FROM THAT. TASTE YOUR SALSA AS YOU ADD CHILIS TO GET A COMFORTABLE HEAT LEVEL. Also, your heat level will go up or down depending on how cold your salsa is.

This recipe as written is what I have known as pico de gallo.  I added 2 Tbsp. tomato paste (use ketchup for sweeter) to make salsa.  Excellant as pico or salsa!!!

Excellent salsa!  It is the bomb!  I got tons of compliments on it.  It's so fresh and AUTHENTIC.  Don't forget the salt, though.  I forgot the first time and it ended up just being a bowl of chopped tomatoes. :)  This recipe is a keeper.

Excellent!!  I used this recipe which was very good.  I also used it as a template for my own by changing things to suit my specific tastes and it has opened the new world of homemade salsa.  Add the salt last, taste to test before and after, it really brings out the flavors and puts it all together.

Delicious!!  I used 2 seeded peppers and it wasn't really spicy at all. Next time I will use all 5.  Awesome flavor and very easy to make.

3 stars only, due to lack of essential ingredients and preparation. Missing garlic, cracked black pepper and olive oil. Also, drain the tomatoes so it isn`t watery. Nothing worse than a drippy salsa on your shirt. Onions and garlic should be blanched as well(pour about 2 cups boiling water over chopped onions/garlic)to soften them up. Adding olive oil gives it another dimention of flavor and adds a nice sheen to finished slasa.

Let me clear up some things first. 

Someone was complaining about how hot this salsa was and claiming that they eat Habaneros constantly. Habaneros are way hotter than Serrano chiles. This person must not be using Serrano peppers and he/she thinks he/she is.

I actually use 1 more Serrano pepper than what's called for, and I also put half of a Habanero pepper. The key is to make sure you dice the peppers up very, very finely so that nobody eats a big chunk of the peppers. Doing so will bring a nice kick; not too strong and not too mild. If you can't handle this, you shouldn't be messing with any salsa that is spicy.

This recipe is truly an excellent recipe. It's very flavorful and reminds me of the good salsa in good ol' San Antonio. I get soooo many compliments every time I make this salsa.

The only other suggestion I'll make is to put a little lime juice directly on the cilantro when you're chopping it up. The mixture of flavors are fantastic. Enjoy!

I'm being generous with my two star rating for this recipe if prepared as written. It's very good with significant tweaking, but by the time you get done doing so it isn't even the same recipe. First off, I cut waaaay back on the serranos - obviously.  And I used jalapenos rather than serranos.  I wanted to be able to taste this, and you wouldn't be able to if your mouth was numb.  Secondly, in my view 1/2 c. each of both onion and cilantro and onion was far too much.  It tasted like, well, cilantro and onion.  I needed to add more tomato (which I seeded and chopped) to get the balance I thought was right.   This recipe, then, is a good reference tool if you're wondering what the ingredients in fresh salsa are  - but not for measurements.  Make this recipe as written at your own risk.  Make a couple of reasonable changes and you've got a fine salsa.

onion/cilantro amts are good, just use 3 ROMA tomatoes, and one medium sized regular tomato- just the sidewalls (no juice/seeds/guts), and be sure to add clove of garlic, a bit more salt & lime juice, and some olive oil and WHITE VINEGAR (approx 1 tsp oil, 2 tsp vinegar).  none of the other reviews i saw (went 20 in or so) mentioned vinegar, which kicks up all the flavors like salt does.  also makes it last longer.  oh...and the no brainer: throw all this in a blender/food processor if you really want salsa, otherwise, you have something between pico de gallo and chunky tomato something :)

To those who think that this recipe is to hot remember that chili peppers have a different heat level in different region of the country for example I lived in California for a few years and ate jalapeños every day and they were perfectly hot for me then moved to Indiana and the same peppers there are insanely hot, this goes for serranos also. Just goes to show that peppers from other areas can be hotter or milder. Also the smaller the pepper the hotter it will be. If unsure cut the pepper in half cross ways and touch lightly to your lip you will then know the heat level of the pepper in question.

Tomatoes should be blanched and peeled.  Add Cilantro to taste.  Add garlic or SOMETHING to liven this up.

We went to mexico in december..  The fresh salsa down there was amazing..  When we came home, I could not eat jarred salsa anymore after trying that fresh salsa.  I've made other salsas before..But this recipe is as close as I have come to copying the great fresh mexican salsas we had in Mexico.  I did some alterations though:  I used 3 jalapenos instead of 5 serranos..  It was a little mild so next time I might add more jalapenos or just keep one with seeds (I seeded all 3).  I added 5 cloves of garlic.. I was worried it might be too much but it was perfect.  I used the juice of 1 entire fresh lime..  I used a tupperware chopping product I have, kind of like a food processor but it did not mush everything..  I took this to a party and it was a HUGE hit..  Everyone raved.  I will definitely be using this recipe for any salsa!  Never again to buy jarred salsas!

I love it HOT.  Believe me, this QUALIFIES !  If you aren't familiar with
peppers Google "Scoville scale".  It rates the relative heat of peppers.
F'rinstance Bell = 0, Jalapeno 2,500 -
8,000, serrano 10,00-23,000.  Red savina
habeneros can reach 580,000.  The hottest- Naga jolokia can reach just over 1,000,000.  I think it's the
hottest because anything over that 
is called spontaneous combustion.

Never used Serrano Chiles... didn't realize they were hotter then Jalapenos. No indication on this recipe that this was a HOT salsa. :( "Fresh Tomato Salsa" led me to think mild/medium for some reason. :/ Got as far as chopping the Serrano chiles, starting coughing non-stop and thought I was having an allergic reaction or something! Bailed out of making this, put everything away in the fridge. Didn't even realize these chiles were HOT until licking some applesauce off of my finger later and thats after washing my hands! Hands are burning now... must have took a bit to kick in.... wish I knew how to get the serrano chiles off my hands... soap isn't working. God forbid I accidentally itch my eye. Horrible Experience!! This recipe needs warnings for those of us who have not worked with these before! >:(

I had a million tomatoes from the garden that I wanted to use up, so I used probably a dozen.  To compensate, I used half of a large onion, almost a whole bunch of cilantro, 2 tsp. salt, juice from 2 whole limes, and instead of the serranos, I used 2 jalapenos.  A very fresh and summery recipe!  Will be making again!

Great call using serrano peppers instead of jalapeno: they are hotter but have a distinctive taste. Please do remove seeds and ribs. If unsure as to hotness, reserve some for adding later. Learned how to make this pico de gallo while living in a small Mexican village. Most locals made this daily sometimes roasting the tomatoes--different flavor but unnecessary imho. We love the chunky, crunchy nature so drain whatever type of fresh tomatoes, reserve juice if you prefer saucier version. I use more cilantro and onion and no salt. Fav use is over homemade pinto beans (easy, cheap, good protein, not fried) topped with any crumbly Mexican cheese.

I used 3 more tomatoes and a little less cilantro. I also added 2 cloves of garlic.  I mixed it all in the blender and everyone loved it!

I've made this recipe many times and it's excellent.  So fresh and not overdone.  Pure, clean, fresh flavour.  

The only thing I adjust is 5 serrano peppers is WAY too much.  I usually make it with 2.  Once I used 3 and we could barely eat it, and we like hot.  Also, you MUST remove the seeds from the peppers, and I strongly suggest wearing disposable gloves when chopping the peppers.  Serrano chiles are required.  Jalapenos do not give the same flavour or heat.

Does not keep long.  Best if consumed the day it is made.

I increased the servings to 27 because I had 20 tomatoes from my garden I needed to use up. Took me and my mom all day to prepare but it was so worth it! I didn't have serrano peppers but I did have an abundance of jalepeno pepers from my garden. We chopped up 25 but just added them by the spoonful until it was spicy enough for me. I also added 5 cloves of garlic per another review. I agree that it's more like pico de gallo but MAN IS IT GOOD! Wonderful recipe as is :)

Delicious and easy. The fresher the ingredients, the better. After reading reviews suggesting a clove of garlic, I decided to substitute salt for garlic salt. Was incredibly tasty. Will definitely be making this again.

I love this recipe. Its quick and easy and delicious. I add about one clove of garlic and about 3 different colored bell pepers. I also use all the serrano chiles but add 1 diced mango to this and it helps keep it mild

I used 4 tomatoes, 1 small onion, 1 serrano chile (use 5 if you want your mouth on fire!). *Tip: taste the salsa first before putting all 5 serrano chiles in.* I only used about 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro and added salt and lime juice to taste. I also added a little bit of fresh chopped garlic...placed each ingredient in the blender separately and used the "pulse" button to blend it. Mixed all the ingredients together and added the salt and lime juice last.

This is good salsa.  The peppers I had in the refrigerator were jalapenos and thai red chili peppers (which are very hot).  I added one of each, and the heat was just about right.  Good way to use tomatoes while they're at the peak of their season.

Oooh I love fresh salsa recipes!!  This one was really good!  But be careful with the serrano peppers they're really hot!  I only added one and it still had some kick.  Thanks for the recipe! =)

My grocery store was out of serrano chiles, so I substituted 1 seeded jalapeno pepper (I was worried it'd be too hot if I added more than that).  My husband and his football buddies ate it up!  Next time, I'll add another jalapeno, or try it with a couple of serranos, because it could have been hotter.

Good! Reduced the cilantro to a 1/3 of a cup. This is what we call "Salsa Mexicana" in Mexico.
Great with grilled steaks!

This was great and so fast. I chopped up 2 jalapenos since I am a spice wimp and put everything else in a food processor and cut it up very fine (careful not to make it all liquid). My hubby and I love it and it is much cheaper then the fresh salsa at the stores.

Make sure to add garlic cloves to this.  And like everyone else said...you do NOT need that many peppers unless you want your mouth burning!  One or two is fine.

I just want to state that this recipe has been in my recipe box for two years now... why? Because it is the best fresh salsa out there. For one, it is simple, you can add less or more to taste of any of the ingredients, or opt out of an ingredient if need be. My only suggestion is to be careful with the lime juice and salt; if you over-do either of them, you can ruin the entire salsa! I literally triple this recipe when I make it because we love it so much!!   A+! I should have reviewed this a long time ago!

AWESOME!!  Just finished making my 3rd batch of this salsa in as many days, and this time I made a triple batch since it disappears so quickly.  Even my kids eat it up (although some of them have to drink a little milk because of the spiciness)  I make the recipe exactly as is except for a few things: Though the recipe doesn't call for it, I peel & seed the tomatoes.  I also used a little less salt & a little less cilantro because ths was my husband's preference.  My husband also requested that I not take any of the seeds or pulp out of the peppers, so I just cut them up into a small dice including the entire pepper (it is spicy, but we love it this way)  This salsa tastes just as good as that which we always bought from the local Mexican restaurant.  It is somewhat time-consuming to cut everything into a small dice, but the yumminess is worth it.  I used to just make my salsa without a recipe, so it never tasted exactly the same from one time to another.  It's great to have such a delicious recipe so that I know that it will be fabulous every single time.  Thanks so much bluebayou!

I've been making a variation of this recipe for a couple of years now.  I received the original recipe from my friend whose mother in law is spanish.  I add garlic and a little bit of diced green peppers, pepper, and cumin (or cumin seeds).  I've also used bottled lemon juice if I do not have fresh limes on hand.  Do not add the seeds if you don't want it hot.  I sometimes use jalapenos in place of serrano's (I have them on hand a lot) - don't use the seeds in them either unless you want hot!  She also taught me that if you have any left over that's been sitting for a few days (or have "mealy" tomatoes) you can fry it up in a pan, put it in a jar in the fridge til it cools and it will get a consistency of a store bought jar of salsa.  I've only done that once or twice because we rarely have any leftover - but it's equally as good!  Thanks for sharing - I always have people asking me for the recipe and I actually don't have it wrote down anymore as I just make it by eyeing...now I can point them to your recipe.  Fabulous!  Thanks!

This salsa is delicious and easy to prepare. I followed the advice of other reviewers and didn't use five hablano peppers.  I used two jalapeno peppers; one with seeds, the other seeded, and it's just right for my husband and me. I used a red onion because I like the taste of them in salsa.  This salsa turns out as good as the salsa you get in Mexican restaurants.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

The only reason I am giving this a one is the recipe should say to use gloves while dicing the peppers. I have never made salsa before and did not use gloves. My hands have been buring for hours.

Thanks to all who review recipies- helps a lot!

This recipe is AWESOME!! We made it on Saturday and it was gone in an hour. We will definitely make this again. It is so good I was eating it with a spoon. The only change was we used 2 serranos instead of 5.

This salsa was delicious! I only made a small batch because I was using up the rest of some roma grape tomatoes. I only had jalopeno on hand, so I used that instead of the chiles.  But it was still fantastic and tasted great on top of an omelet. Thanks for a great recipe.

The only reason why I am rating this three stars is because of the serrano peppers. I made a double batch of salsa and used only two serrano peppers in the entire thing. It was definitely spicy enough for me and even my husband who loves spicy food said that it had a good amount of spice. I would never use 5 serrano peppers. The salsa was fabulous though and will be making it again...just not with as many peppers as the recipe calls for.

YUMMY!!!  Big hit w/ the Dangs.  Added lots of garlic, lemon juice, hot sauce (made a BIG batch-used 4 peppers and it wasn't spicy enough) and balsamic vinegar.  Used food processor for most of the tomatoes, etc, then hand chopped a few toms for bigger chunks.  Very tasty!

I made this yesterday and it turned out wonderful.  I did add a little garlic ( 2 cloves). Hubby thought it was the best salsa ever!  If hubby's happy, everybody's happy! Will make for parties for sure!

AMAZING!  The version I make which is very similar is MORE THAN 5 STARS!  So I gave it five stars even though I made a few adjustments:  I have kids who don't like things too spicy, so I haven't made it with the hot peppers.  I added chopped sweet yellow pepper, and as for the lime,   I squeezed it into a little bowl and stirred in a little honey (1/2 tsp.).  Amazing reviews from everyone who eats it.  One last thing:  it says 10 minutes prep time, but I find it takes much longer than that to chop everything!

This is now a family favorite, and I live in San Antonio where we know what good salsa tastes like! I added a little garlic to the original recipe.  NOTE: 1 Serrano pepper is just fine ... 5 is INSANE.   NOTE2: If you want mild salsa, without loosing the flavor, take the seeds out of the serrano pepper before chopping and adding to the salsa.

I have been making salsa like this for years, although I never measure what I put in, I just use what's ready in the garden.  I do agree that 5 serranos are too many.  I usually use one jalapeno or 2-3 serranos.  Also, you MUST try it sometime with lime zest.  Zest a whole lime, then take the whole lime's juice.  The zing you get is outstanding!

We changed it up a bit, to suit what we had on hand, but the end result was the best salsa I have ever had!  We ate about 4 batches of it one day, and canned it the next.  I haven't tried it canned yet, but fresh, it is excellent.  We used some finely diced jalepeno, as we didn't have serranos, and we added a couple cloves of minced fresh garlic.  Mmm, thinking about this one is making me hungry!

Excellent salsa! I seeded and strained the tomatoes, helps to make the salsa less watery. Only used 2 seeded serrano peppers and one mild jalepeno pepper. It was nice and spicy but not too hot. I also used the juice of one whole lime, a splash of white vinegar and a few drops of tabasco.. gives it an extra bite. Also added one garlic clove to the mix. Have made it several times and tried adding different things like corn and black beans. A hit every time!

Simplicity...lovely.  

Wee alterations...

1-2 cloves of minced garlic...( I LOVE GARLIC )

Any hot pepper will do...jalepeno, serrano, thai etc.

Fresh ground black pepper... 

YUMMY!

Massive hit.

Yummy!  I used Jalapeno peppers since that is what I had in my garden, and a sweet white onion because that's what I had in my veggie drawer!  Since I was serving it AS dinner one night, I added half a cup of black beans to about 3 big spoonfuls of the salsa and served with tortilla chips.  It made me happy!

Good recipe to start from, but I would never use 5 serranos!  I used 2 and that was plenty.  Also added a little coriander to mine.

I love this salsa!  I read several reviews and decided to add 2 cloves of garlic to the recipe.  I did not have any serrano chiles so I substituted them for jalapeno peppers (2) .  It turned out to be fairly mild but still delicious.

Amazingly tasty, especially with a clove of garlic and half a red bell pepper chopped up in there. As others have noted, though, there is NO way I could handle this with 5 serrano chiles. I used 3 and it's already about as spicy as I can handle. I'd recommend 2-3 chiles for this recipe.

this was really good although  I don't like super hot stuff so I left out the peppers but added a sprinkle of chili powder I also added some lemon juice and garlic. It would have gotten 5 out of 5 stars but this is in no way salsa it is definitely pico de gallo!

I used 4 fresh jalapeno peppers instead of serrano chiles because that's what I happened to have on hand.    I added the juice of an entire lime, and I also used a couple extra tomatoes.  This is a winner!

This is a delicious salsa.  This is the first time I've made it so I was pleased that it turned out so well.  Like some others suggested I did add 1 clove of garlic (but we're kinda garlic nuts!) and only used 2 chilies.  One tip I can offer:  Make sure to wear gloves when you're handling chilies.  I didn't and now my hands are still burning two days later!

This is a great recipe, it reminds me of a traditional Mexican Pico de gallo. If you want it more saucy just add tomato sauce. Yummy- mine is 5 stars all the way.

Wow this was sooo good!  I used a jalapeno pepper because that is all the store had.  I also cut up fresh garlic and used lemon juice instead of lime.  My husband could not stop eating it - it was a hit at the 4th of July party!

I love this stuff! Ever since coming across this recipe, I have been using it for several years, especially with grilled chicken and fish. A couple days ago I made a batch with fresh garlic scapes. Last night I was eating it out of the bowl with a spoon. Tonight it will go with sea bass. Yum!

I added some olive oil, feta cheese and garlic and decided to slice a baguette and make bruschetta with this fabulous salsa. Will make again! Thanks a bunch for this recipe!

Take the time drain the tomatoes for an hour or so before mixing with other ingredients (you'll be amazed how much liquid comes off with no loss of flavor).  It makes such a difference and the salsa doesn't end up as 'watery'.

I love spicy food. I even put Sriracha all over my rice. But holy mother, serrano chiles are nothing to mess with. I read the reviews before I made it so I took some advice and used only 2 and would add more if it wasn't hot enough. I AM SWEATING IN MY SEAT RIGHT NOW. DO NOT USE MORE THAN TWO!!!! Oh my goodness, whoever can eat this salsa with 5 serrano chiles, you're my hero. Next time, I'll make it with 1 chile or maybe 1/2. Pretty good salsa nonetheless. I just added some corn to it, it tastes even better. :)

Sure wish I read the reviews before making this.  I doubled the recipe except for the hot pepper and it still burned my head off!!!!!  I ended up adding three times the ingredients to balance out the heat from five peppers.  The final product was perfect with a good kick to it.  One or two Serranos are plenty for this recipe.

I made this for lunch today. I didn't have serrano chile's, and I only had 3 jalapeno's. I do think the flavor would've been better with the serrano's. We don't use much salt, so the salt was a bit much, so I added 3 more tomatoes. I think next time I will add a bit of fresh garlic. Even without these changes, it was a great salsa. Thanks for sharing! ****I made this again today, this time I used 1 serrano chile & 1 jalapeno, and 1/2 t salt. It was perfect! Needless to say, we are addicted!

This is an old recipe that I have used for years. Delicious and quick to fix. Do let it stand overnight or a few hours so the flavors can blend.

Very good recipe! We had to use canned chopped green chiles (old el paso)as a substitute for the chiles. It tasted great.  It's good if you let the tomatoes drain a bit so they aren't watery, or pat them dry after you chop them, so the salsa isn't so watery. Some liquid is good, but nothing is worse than dribbling stuff down your shirt at a party. We brought this salsa to a party and there wasn't one piece of tomato left by the end of the night. My friends have no shame...

I agree with the other posters--great idea for a recipe, but two very important points: 1) This needs 1-2 cloves of garlic. 2) We found 1 serano pepper to be PLENTY spicy. It was comfortably hot without being too spicy to taste the flavors. I used 1 pint of chopped cherry tomatoes & slightly less cilantro than called for, and we loved it!

I have been making this (almost) exact recipe for years, and it is the BEST!  I do sometimes add other ingredients that I might have on hand like a can of black beans, or corn, or one of my favorites;  peel and seed a cucumber & dice it and throw it in!  Yummy and fresh- tasting!  I could eat it all at one sitting if I let myself!  And I always add GARLIC!  My mouth waters just thinking about it!

Like others, I halved the salt and seeded the tomatoes, and I also added 1 tsp extra lime juice.  I used a few heaped tablespoons of chopped pickled green chillies as this was all I had.  The salsa pretty good but it just seemed to be missing something...maybe I'll add some dried cumin next time.

I tried 2 recipes and this one I liked more. The only changes I would make though, is to reduce the cilantro, add garlic, and add the chilies to taste. I will definitely make this again.

love the recipe! I used small tomatoes because we had so many (not cherry, but larger). Bought a tube of cilantro paste from the store and it worked out very good actually. and then just regular jalapeno peppers. Was delicious on taco salad!

Absolutely love it! Awesome recipe as a starter for all of us who are new to making salsa. I was able to tweak it to several different recipes just by adding things I and my hubby like. Very pleased and will continue to use for all time!

Tried it today and it's pretty good (with homegrown tomatoes). I did follow a couple of advice from one person: I blanched onions and garlic and I added EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil). I will do again! Thx for sharing :)

This salsa was so good!  Loved it!  Be careful with the serrano chiles, though. Thanks to other reviewers, I was careful and tasted a small piece of chile first.  My serrano chile pepper was so hot that I only needed to use one pepper (seeds removed), and I chopped it into very small pieces.  I love spicy salsa, and this was definitely spicy enough with just one chile.  I served the salsa as a topping for fish and white rice, and it was delicious!  My family & I decided next time we'll make fish tacos and add some black beans & shredded cheese!  Mmmmm!

Oh my, this is GREAT!  6-Stars.  Thank you so much.  It was much tastier the next morning after chilling overninght.  I added a tablespoon of olive oil and a teaspoon of salt and one of sugar and cut back a little on the cilantro (personal taste) and used ten roma tomatoes.  These additions mellows it out a bit and the oil enhances the flavors.  It still has a great bite.
-
What a great stand-alone or base recipe for customizing.  Lots of liquid.  Great to chase down your morning eggs with.  
-
Next batch I'll seed the tomatoes and use jalapenos for a milder version.  Thanks again.

1st time making salsa. used poblano peppers instead of serrano, and it still turned out pretty good. i included all the ingredients but didnt measure them, just went by taste. it became more watery the longer it sat in the fridge. it was fine with me, i just drank the juice after the salsa was all eaten. (i made this for myself so no one elses saliva got into it.)

Best homemade salsa I have ever made. The 5 finely chopped Serrano chilie add a very nice spicy after taste. I followed the recipe to an exact. This was a hit at my cinco de mayo party. We also added it to the refried beans. Delicious. I would give more stars if I could

Awesome!  I took others suggestions, clove of garlic, some oregano or basil, 2 serrano peppers.  Wasn't sure if my husband could handle it...he's not much for hot spicy foods, but this is so good, he tears it up!  Kids love it to.

This was amazing! However, I did not use 5 serrano peppers. I am from the Caribbean and love, love, love spicy hot food (I even make my own hot pepper sauce), but 5 serrano peppers is way too much, in my opinion. I second what another reviewer said: taste as you add the peppers.

Other than that, the recipe was great. I actually used the salsa for some homemade chicken burritos and it complimented the chicken and rice I made perfectly.

I love this recipe! I had a huge tomato crop this summer and made this recipe with fresh tomatoes from the garden. I made a few minor modifications; I added extra tomato, 2 cloves fresh garlic, 2 Tbsps. lime juice instead of 2 tsps. I will definitely make this recipe again!

This was great- but only because I read the reviews that said to use less serrano peppers. I used TWO, and it was plenty hot and spicy-- any more than that and it would have been inedible. But with that adjustment, its a pretty much perfect recipe. I did add 1 clove of chopped garlic also, but thats just my preference.

I did not have any serrano chilies on hand and subsituted 3 jalapeno peppers (de seeded) and it made a nice medium salsa. 3 peppers was spicy enough for our "medium spicy"tastes.

I was a little worried about making this using all 5 peppers, but turns out it was fine.  Had a nice kick, but not too hot.  I used the seeds of the peppers too.  Per the other reviews, I also added a clove of garlic and 2 Tbs of tomato paste to make it more like salsa, as opposed to pico de gallo.  Very good!

Great easy recipe, very tasty.  Not hot like I was expecting.  Just a mixture of Serrano and Jelepeno chili's.  Also used a little red union.  Went down great at our dinner party.

I made this salsa for the first time last week and have already been requested to make it again this week.  I made some minor changes based on personal preference.  I use only 1 serrano chile (seed & pulp removed), 1/2 sea salt and 1/2 garlic salt.  Omitted lime juice.  After everything was tossed and seasoned to liking I added 1/2 of an avocado diced thinly then tossed carefully not to mash the pieces.  I have to say this is some yummy, fresh salsa.  For now I will look no further.  Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe.

I would agree with the other reviewer who said this was more of a pico recipe.  To have a more "... and you didn't BUY this?" response, add crushed canned tomatoes.  Other add-in ingredients are cooked corn, black beans, or jalapeno peppers (sub or in addition to).   I also have added bell peppers for color, used both red and yellow onions, etc.  You almost can't go wrong.  Whenever you have cilantro, lime, and salt in your veggie mix, it will have the overall taste of salsa or pico.  It makes a great garnish, I've used it in baked potatoes with shredded cheddar/jack and sour cream, on burgers, in breakfast burritos, and other stuff not coming to mind ATM.  The extra "juice" another reviewer referred to I have used in the past as a basis for a skirt steak marinade.  Rub the steak with black pepper, kosher salt, chili powder, and some cumin (sub taco seasoning as a shortcut) then toss in a ziploc bag with the juice and let sit overnight.  Grill to desired temp (medium) and slice into strips.  Sour cream, guac, sauteed peppers and onions with soft shells... you are all set.

This was good, though I had to change some things. I made the first batch following the recipe except I added garlic and substituted jalapeno peppers, as they were plentiful at the Farmer's Market. It was way to much cilantro and I love cilantro. This time I used only a 1/4 cup. Also, I needed to use only two peppers and this had plenty of bite. Good base recipe.

Delicious salsa!  I gave it a 4 because I had to add garlic to get it perfect.  We also used a mixture of jalapenos and banana peppers because we had no serano.  My husband and I were both pretty pleased with the outcome.

GREAT as a marinade. I've been making this for years w/ jalapenos or habaneros.  One of the best uses, other than as a pico de gallo chip dip/salsa is as a marinade for either chicken or shrimp, especially after a whir in the food processor or blender.  Marinate shrimp for an hour or so (lime will begin to cook shrimp if too long), and chicken for 8 hours then grill.  Be careful about refrigerating this since cold ruins the texture of tomatoes.  Best made 1hr ahead then chilled only briefly unless using as marinade.

Followed the recipe exactly - came out yummmm. The chilli was perhaps one too much, so I increased all ingredients a little :)  Also added a very little bit of sugar for a sweetish tinge which I think worked well.  Very fresh tasting and very good. Thanks a lot for sharing.

It is an amazing homemade salsa but I made a lot of changes. Nothing against the original recipe. I made some modifications to fit my taste. I like spicy food but for salsa, I like sweet, tangy and fruity. Here are the changes I made to this recipe and turned out wonderful and hard to resist. :-)  3/4 cup of shopped cilantro 2 teaspoon of sugar 1/2 Cup of shredded pineapple with juice

Great salsa! I only put 3 serrano peppers without seeds.  5 serrano peppers would be way to hot for the average person.  I also added 1/2 t sugar to make it have a sweet taste.

This is a recipe known to me as pico de gallo. I use less serrano (2-3 depending on size...or even 1 large one, adjust to taste). Serranos tend to be very small. Also, use roma tomatoes for less acidity. This is also a great base recipe added to mashed avacado and extra lime juice...commonly known as guacamole! Yummo!

This salsa is excellent! Made it the first time for a party and it was a hit.

The second time around (this is in a matter of 3 days), I added a lot of the suggestions from the members and it was so good. Half of it is still waiting for me! Here's what I threw in:

3 cloves of garlic
1.5 avacados
.5 big onion
5 medium sized tomatoes
2 tsp salt
1 bunch of cilantro (1.5 cups maybe?)
2 stalks of green onion
1.5 limes' juice
3 Serrano chiles
Pepper to taste

Mix it together, let it sit, and enjoy with multigrain chips. Yum!

PS: handle chopped Serrano chiles with care. My hands are burning!

I used Jalepenos instead of Serrano peppers but followed the recipe closely other than that. This is a great base for making fresh salsa. Some users found it bland or too hot or not hot enough. Just adjust the peppers...this is a basic salsa recipe that can be tweaked to each individual taste with ease. Great one to have in the recipe box.

I made this for a party last weekend and it got rave reviews.  My boyfriend even raved about it and he NEVER does that about something I make! I made this a couple days ahead of time and added the peppers a little at a time until it had the "heat" I desired.  Worked great!

When you order a shrimp cocktail in Sonora, Mexico, this is what you get with shrimp added and it is delicious.  When we are vacationing there, we can't get enough so, of course, I make it at home now.  I use jalepenos but I think next time I'll throw in a couple of serranos.  The only drawback to this recipe is that it does not keep well in the fridge; it gets too watery and kind of mushy so don't go overboard on the amount you're making!

My mom makes one almost exactly like this, but adds garlic, and only a couple chilis (we're wussy, what can I say?). Excellent and simple, but make sure you add the salt - it actually needs quite a lot!

I also use jalapeno peppers with my salsa.  This is a great basic recipe. Very easy to make.  PLEASE remember to wear plastic gloves when cutting hot peppers...and do not touch your face!  I failed to wear the gloves and after chopping 10 peppers for a larger recipe, my hand is on fire!

Wow  - 5 serrano chiles were WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY to hot.  I would say 1 chile or use jalapenos.  I like spicy but this was burn your mouth, not in a good way, spicy.

This is a good easy recipe. I do not like hot salsa at all so I used two seeded jalapenos. I also added two chopped cloves of garlic, and mixed this in my food processor to get it to the consistency I like.

This salsa is so fresh and tasty.  I added a clove of minced garlic and used only 3 chiles.  (You may want to modify the amount of chiles to suit your tastes ~ 5 will make it hot hot hot!)  Also, it doesn't specify in the directions, but I seeded the tomatoes a bit to make it less runny.  (I love this website).

I just tried this recipe for the first time.  It was great!I couldn't find serrano chili peppers so I used 3 jalapeno peppers (with seeds removed) and it had a nice kick without being overpowering.  I also upped the cilantro just because we're cilantro lovers.  This was my first attempt at salsa and it was so easy and so delicious that I'll never go back to buying it!

Thank you so much for submitting this recipe!

I made sure to trim the ribs (white interior spines) of the pepper, so it wouldn't be overwhelmingly spicy. I couldn't wait an hour and set on the salsa within 15 minutes. I also used diced grape tomatoes, fresh dried cilantro from a jar (Litehouse brand) and the juice of 1 lime. Delish!!!

The recipe is simple and has potential. Healthy, quick and should've been tasty.  However, there is an excessive amount of salt.  It really only needs half the amount listed or less.  The peppers are intense too.  I put 3 in instead of 5 and its still got an powerful kick.  Obviously the peppers are dependent on your personal preference, but that is not noted in the recipe.  I think if you called this Intense Salsa it would be a much better name.

I really enjoyed this salsa.  Love the flavors!  I used one Serrano pepper and one Fresno pepper, and that was the right amount of heat.  Hot, but not unbearable...  Made this in the food processor. (First chopped tomatoes and a small green pepper and put them in a small bowl.  Then, chopped the cilantro, onion, and hot peppers.  Finally, I mixed everything together.  Oh, and I used sea salt...)  I will definitely use this salsa again!

I make this for fourth of july every year, and now I get requests for it.... it is really good salsa, or pico de gallo. I add some garlic, or avocado, if I happen to have them on hand. Serve with chips, and make sure you refrigerate for 4 hrs of more!

GREAT 'pico' type salsa. The only change I would make: add one pepper at a time to get to the desired HEAT level. 5 peppers would have been TOO much. Otherwise, perfect blend of flavors.

I prefer 1/2 a seeded habanero & that's spicy enough for me and use thinly sliced scallions instead of onion.  I also add a splash of orange juice to make this a Yucatan-type salsa.

I thought this recipe was delicious!  This was my first time making a fresh salsa and I did alter the recipe a bit.  I added two cloves of garlic and half the amount of cilantro.  I also did 2 peppers instead of 5.  It was a winning recipe since my boyfriend was sneaking to the fridge in the midde of the night!!

Great salsa! I don't think it is too spicy at all with using 5 peppers, but I like it HOT! A couple cloves of garlic definitely needs to be added thought.  I also throw all the ingredients into a blender and then strain it.  It gets rid of all the excess juice and is still very flavorful.

This is now my go-to salsa recipe; we are done with the jarred stuff. I threw it all into the food processor and it was done in 30 seconds. I made two changes, based on the reviews I read: I added a clove of garlic and reduced the number of peppers to two (although I might do three next time.)

We call thix "pico de gallo" in Texas. It's delicious as is or you can add most any type of pepper from Poblano to Habanero to control the hear.

You have to try this! Delicious!! I followed recipe exactly except I only used 1 Serrano Chile and it was plenty. I can't imagine using 5! We used it as a dip for chips and also added to our chicken quesadillas.  It was even better the next day. Thanks for the recipe.

Yeah, no way 5 serranos.  I used 1 and it was still very spicy.     Also, next time I'd cut back on the lime to half.  Or maybe lemon instead.     But very tasty.

I guess it was ok. The veggies tasted fresh, but overall there wasn't that much flavor in this salsa. Some more ingredients are needed to make it better.

Very good.  However, we like our salsa a bit more blended, so we blended half the recipe, and then mixed it in the other half.  I had huge, very hot peppers, so we used one.  We added a little more salt, minced garlic, and a tiny bit of suger.  Surprisingly the surgar really rounded the flavors out.  It made a perfect spaghetti jar full.  I may make this for gifts some time.  Very fresh and tasty.  Thanks, Bluebayou!!

This recipe was so yummy!! It got eaten up so quickly I had to make more after two days!!  I definitly think it is best if you let it sit for at least a day for it to create a little more juice!!

Five stars with NO SERRANO PEPPERS-I didn't have any on hand, so I diced up some bell pepper and added some kick with a few generous sprinkles of red pepper flakes. I used a little more lime juice than called for, and minced up a clove of garlic to add to it as well. Picky hubby gave rave reviews!

I added a clove of garlic and a little cumin.  Pretty Tasty.  However I feel like it's still missing a little something to give it a zing.

I used 2 jalapenos instead of serrano peppers and it was still too hot for my taste.  I recommend adding peppers one at a time, then testing it before adding more.  Other than that, it was pretty good.

I have never made salsa before.  Mainly because it seemed time consuming, what with cooking the tomatoes and all.  This recipe is so easy and delicious!  I used some of the other suggestions and added fresh garlic and then tomatoe paste so it was more of a salsa.  I had to triple the recipe and then make several batches as my friends all wanted some.  Thank you for the great recipe!

I made this salsa w/ fresh tomatoes out of my garden and it was wonderful! I also used some fresh bananna peppers. I did not use 5!!  serrano peppers, I only used 1 and it could of used 1 more for additional heat. But it was a great starter recipe to add things to. It is a little juicy/runny but I like mine that way. REVISED: I made this a second time thinking I was going to make it hotter, and added 2 more peppers...Not hot enough. I believe this 5 pepper deal depends on how BIG your tomatoes are. I used 3 LARGE GERMAN JOHNSON tomatoes and they were huge, so I believe the bigger the tomatoes, the more peppers needed. 3 German Johnsons were way too much for 3 peppers, could of used the 5.

Take the other reviewer's advice and cut the Serrano peppers back to two!  Five is insane.  Two was plenty hot for us and my hubby likes his salsa spicy.  I also added one chopped clove garlic.  Excellent.

OMG...this salsa is awesome.  My husband and I love this recipe.  I used 2 jalapeno peppers instead of the chilies, and I put the tomatoes in the blender before I added the rest of the ingredients.  It is the best salsa that I have ever eaten, and it's very easy to make.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

This was so good.  I used jalapenos (half a one for mild/medium, and 1.5 for spicier folks).  My husband is from Peru, and he loved this salsa!  I did too.  Fresh tomatoes a must.  I will never turn down my family's home grown tomatoes again...instead I will make this salsa and freeze it!  Thanks bluebayou!

This is the best fresh salsa recipe I've ever used.  I add garlic, garlic scapes, green onions, scallions...whatever I have.  I love to use multi-colored tomatoes and red onion.  It looks as great as it tastes!

I was taught to make this as pico de gallo also.  I use green salad onions, a whole bundle (like it comes in the grocery store) of cilantro leaves only, and 5 serranos and 5 jalapenos.  I use a lot more than 3 tomatos also because I make a gallon or 2 at a time.  I love hot food!

This is a great basic recipe. I mix up which hot peppers to use, i.e., jalapeno, habanero, etc., whatever suits your likes. Also, I add (to taste) either chili powder, cayenne pepper, and cumin. Sometimes all three. FWIW, most salsas I make, I make with the food processor. If you want it chunky, reserve a healthy portion of the tomato and onions and hand-chop to add to the processed base. Good stuff...

LOVED IT!!!! I didn't measure everything - only the salt, and I used part of a pablano pepper instead of serrano peppers and used lemon juice instead of lime. A coworker and I just ate the whole batch for lunch - making more for tomorrow.

I had 2 banana peppers from my garden, so I used those (tomatoes from the garden also) and 3 serranos. I also added 2 cloves of garlic and 3T tomato paste. Absolutely perfect! Except I think I should have doubled or even tripled the recipe because this is being gobbled up very quickly at my house! My family thinks it's better than at any Mexican restaurant!

Fantastic! However 5 serrano is WAYYY too much for me, and I love spicy stuff.. We used one and it was PLENTY spicy. I would recommend a half for those who like it more mild. I added a in a clove of garlic. Otherwise, yummy! Our two dinner guests ate it all to themselves so I had to make it twice :) Will make it again.

I added garlic and used a couple of fresh jalapenos from my garden.  I also used fresh tomatoes and onion from the garden.  Flavor was good, but it's a little watery for me.  I think I will add a little olive oil next time to give it more body.

Excellent, I added only one pepper with the seeds and that was a little hot for me.  I also added one clove of garlic.

Awesome salsa!  I used to live on the Mexican border and always miss the salsa fresca you could get down there (jarred stuff from grocery stores = gross).  I add a clove or two of garlic to this and it is great!  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because unless you like your salsa SCORCHINGLY hot you do NOT need that many Serrano chilies!  I put in one jalapeno (seeds too) and it has heat but isn't unbearable.

Have been making this for years.  Simple but delicious.  Adjust type and amount of peppers based on the level of heat you can take.  I often put this on top of my salads instead of using dressing.  Healthy and tasty!

We love this salsa.  2 serano peppers for us with no seeds.  We make it about once a week during the summer, for something really tasty, add a fresh peach.... sooooo good.

This was pretty good but with five peppers it was too hot for most of us (four adults).  Next time I'll try it with a pepper with less heat or use fewer peppers; you can't beat fresh salsa!

I made this salsa for the first time last week, and have made it 3 times since then! My boyfriend ate the last batch in less than 15 minutes! I like this with only 1 or 2 serrano peppers, more than that would be too intense.

I made this salsa for the first time a couple of days ago. It's really good but you must let it sit in the fridge for a couple of days and let the flavors "marry". Also I would definitely cut the salt in half. My 7 year old grandson loved it and wanted to take the bowl home for himself, lol. I'll be definitely making it again. Oh yeah, and I only used 1/2 of a jalapeno pepper, added one clove of chopped garlic, and used red onion instead of white. Yummy :)

This salsa recipe is wonderful if you either: a) use one jalapeño or one serrano pepper. If you use 5 peppers in this you will lose all ability to taste.

I love this recipe!!!

It is wonderful because you know what is going into it and it tastes fabulous!

I always make a double batch because it goes so quickly! And I added it up this last time... and it's actually cheaper to make your own than to buy it.

LOVE IT!

Wow! This salsa is amazing! I only let it sit for 45 minutes instead of an hour, I couldn't wait any longer to taste it! I read other people's suggestions about lowering the amount of peppers, so I only put 1 in (the b/f doesn't like extra spicy food). I put in a pinch more cilantro than the recipe called for simply because I love fresh cilantro. This is a wonderfully delicious recipe & I always love when I can make something fresh instead of buying it in a jar with perservatives in it. My boyfriend hasn't tasted it yet, but I know he's going to love it! Thank you so much for sharing this tasty recipe with the rest of us!! 5 stars!! Delicious!

Excellent, easy to make salsa. Very tasty. However, instead of 5 serranos, I used two - 5 is way too hot. I might try 3 next time. This recipe calls for A LOT of chopping, so I'd recommend using a food processor to save time and wrist strain.

when i first saw this i thought to myself, how can this taste nice, it's too simple. i made it anyway since it was easy and quite highly rated.

definitely a keeper! i am impressed so was everyone else. it looked plain and simple but it ended up being very flavourful and refreshing. as my guests said it was tangy. 

i chopped parsley with coriander for this.
couldn't find serrano chilis so i use jalapenos instead. i used 1 tbsp which i thought was more than enough. chopped the jalapenos and mixed it in. i then took some of the pickled water used for the jalapenos and put about 1 tbsp in. that made it so nice and tangy! i presume u could do the same by mixing vinegar with some sugar. 

i think 3 tomatoes is too little for 4 servings. i put in 4 tamatos instead for 3 servings. i didn't really bother with the salt just gave it a shake that's all.

This is delicious!  I have to double the recipe because my husband and daughter eat this so fast.  I only use 3 serrano chiles instead of 5 and it was a nice medium hot.  I love cilantro and thought it was just the right amount.  Great summertime recipe for fresh ingredients.  No salsa out of a jar can beat this fresh tomato salsa!

Yum! Exactly what I was looking for. I used two jalapeno peppers instead of the other ones. And next time, I would reduce the salt by half. I served it with fajitas and with tortilla chips as well. Will definitely make again! I did seed the tomatoes to make it less "sloppy".

Delicious! My picky pregnant girlfriend was happy with it! I tried it with a lot less jalepenos instead and it was fine - next time I'll use more (jalepenos that is). Jalepenos were a nice substitution.

This is the best salsa recipe we have found yet, however it is a bit time consuming with cutting the cilantro.

This recipe is wonderful but the pepper type that was listed was unavailable at my local market  I used two habanero peppers and it was smoking hot. Maybe 5 jalepeno peppers would be accurate.  I tried the recipe with 3 jalepenos and it was so mild that I didn't consider it salsa. I used two chili peppers and it was perfect.

This is a great, easy recipe! I vary the amounts by what I have on hand, and use less cilantro just by taste preference. I tend to use the food processor to chop the tomatoes and onions because it is easier, but this does give a more "soupy" salsa. I haven't had any complaints!

Excellent fresh salsa.  I too substituted 4  jalapenos for the serrenos.  Left the seeds in just one.  Also used a couple of fresh cloves of garlic.  Next time I'll make a bigger batch as this went quickly!

This was the best salse EVER!  I used fresh everything out of my greenhouse, including the cilantro.  The only thing missing is garlic.  I added two cloves per batch.

This a nice fresh salsa, written as is, and a great base recipe for building.  I chose to use a couple different peppers, added some paste, minced garlic and tossed in some red pepper flakes.  My peppers are on the very hot end of the spectrum,  so additional fresh lime. Tastes great right after making, so I know as it sits, the flavors are going to explode further.

This is a great recipe. My only adjustment was using jalapeño peppers instead of Serrano chilies. I only used 1-2 peppers depending on how spicy I wanted it. Overall its a great recipe and tastes a lot like what you would get at chipotle.

I picked this recipe because it was so simple. I did take the advice of the other reviewers and only used 2 peppers (took seeds out) and added a bit of garlic. I also bumped up the salt, just a wee bit because it needed a little something extra. I only had roma tomatoes, and found that I basically had to double the amount of tomatoes because it looked like cilantro salsa! I did not even wait to chill it, started eating it right away. Have it in the fridge right now, bet it tastes even better after it is chilled. Enjoy!

Good. The way I prefer to make it is a bit different because we find the cilantro to be overpowering.

This went over very well at work.  After reading reviews I made the following alterations - I added 1 t. sugar, 1 t. olive oil, a large clove of garlic.  I also put the chopped tomatoes in a strainer to let a little of the water drain off (about a t.).  3 serrano peppers with seeds seems to be the optimal number.  You can somewhat get a sense once they're chopped up how hot they will be by how hot they smell.

good basic recipe. You wouldn't want to use all those peppers. One was enough for us and you want to deseed it first. For something extra put 1 or 2 chipotle peppers in too!

IF you are a fan of fresh cilantro, then I suppose you will like this recipe. I used all fresh ingredients, including tomatoes from my own garden, however, the fresh cilantro ruined it for me.

I love this salsa, the thing I did different was added some V8 spicy tomato juice.  Excellent touch!  I saw a few people added crushed garlic, will have to try that next time.

I used everything from our garden and chopped it all up finely. I only used 3 peppers due to everyone commenting on the heat. I like salsa hot and should have known better. 3 peppers wasn't enough so next time I will try the 5. I left out the garlic clove because I didn't have one handy. Next time I will and I think that it will add to the overall greatness of this recipe! Great Stuff!!

Great recipe! The only modification I made was that I used 2 chiles instead of 5, which is why I rated it only 4 stars instead of 5. I got a lot of compliments on it & my husband now asks for it all the time!

My husband said, "This is a great pico." I said, "It's salsa cruda." He said, "In that case, it's not that great." I more or less concur with his assessment. As a dip for chips it's missing something (note: I think replacing the salt with an equal amount of chicken bouillon would improve it. Not terribly authentic, though). As a topping for tacos it's perfect. So as a compromise, I'm going to put it in "Black Bean and Salsa Soup", from this site, for dinner tonight. Thanks for the recipe! (Note: I whizzed mine in the food processor to get the pieces super fine. This makes it be over-juicy so you might want to drain it if that isn't ok for you. Before I put it in the food processor it was a fine texture, not too wet, not too dry.)

I love this basic recipe for salsa.  I dont add all the peppers since my DH cant handle it.  This last time I made it I didnt have any peppers so I added chopped pickled jalapenos.  It gave it a differnt flavor but it was still good.  This is my "go to" recipe for fresh salsa.

Definately a good salsa but it calls for too many peppers.  As with another reviewer... good tomatoes are a must.

I love salsa like this, like pico de gallo style, so already you can't go wrong here. I didn't add nearly as many chiles either. One thing I always add to my tomatoes is balsamic vinegar, out of preference. I don't like the sweetness of tomatoes at all, so I've come to always pair the two. Because of that, I cut the lime juice about in half (a little over a teaspoon). With this though, it's important to have really red, juicy tomatoes, since they are very much the raw star. There's no concentrating of flavor with boiling here. Anyway, great salsa! It's fresh, beautiful in color, and super easy.

Easy, tasty, hot! My family enjoyed it thoroughly as a side dish to the curry. Due to lack of serrano chillies in local stores, I opted for 5 Jalapeno and 1 habanero chillies in the mix - which worked perfectly

I used tomatoes from our garden, which made this salsa even better! The prep time is incredibly fast & easy, huge bonus. This is a cross between salsa and pico de gallo....I make it at least once at week!

This salsa was excellent and received rave reviews from my guests.  I used jalapeno peppers because I didn't want it to be too hot.  I also sweetened it with pineapple as someone else suggested.  Loved it!

Overall this is very good and fresh tasting. I used 1 hot pepper (not sure what it was) and added some garlic. super and also very pretty when using multicolored tomatoes, i.e. yellow, purple, green (ripe, such as Aunt Ruby's German green). wonderful

5 serrano's are way too much heat! I used 10 slices of jarred jalapeno's and that was a bit much for us. I will reduce it to 7 next time. This recipe has just the right amounts of the rest of the ingredients.

I have made this salsa over and over. We cannot get enough of it. My mother in law has even threaten me to save some for her when she visits in October. Guess I will have to freeze some for her. The only thing I added was garlic and tomato paste like one viewer said. LUV IT!!!!

I love things hot but this calls for too many of the serrano chilies.  I just use one and it turns out great.

YUMMMMMY!  I loved this recipe just the way it was -- except I didn't have serrano chilies but I had some homegrown Jalepeno's which worked just fine.  I only used 2 and that was super hot.  Very tasty salsa -- I've made it 3 times in the past month - it goes fast in this house!  Great summertime recipes with all fo the garden veges growing - no need for trips to the store!

I use one jalapeno, not five serranos.  It made a very nice pico de gallo for tacos, but I don't think it would be that great as a salsa for chips.  It was quite watery, and I even seeded my tomatoes.  But, I think it made a nice, fresh addition to my taco night.

I used 2 peppers partially seeded. It was really hot. Also after I blended it, it was green/tan! I guess my tomatoes weren't ripe enough. Next time I'll use 1 pepper fully seeded and add a Tbsp of Tomato paste for color

This salsa is so good, but it's even better the second day. After the flavors in the salsa have had a chance to marinate the peppers become more mellow and the lime becomes more noticeable. I cut down the peppers, as suggested by previous reviewers, but it's really just personal preference. I have not tried this with lemon juice, but give how pronounced the lime taste was on the second day... I'd recommend sticking to lime.

In Mexico they add water to chopped salsa like this recipe. It's quite unique and adds a refreshing and delicious liquid to the salsa. Can also add cumin or celery salt.

I make this in my Vita Mix, only I use one jalapeno pepper and lemon juice, not lime. We have this over a crock pot of pinto beans that have been cooking all day. Delicious when scooped up with tortilla chip scoops.

Excellent and easy. I also added 2 cloves of garlic. I didn't have any serrano chilies so I added one red cherry pepper chopped up and included the seeds to give it a kick. It's still not too spicy but very good!

We really like this salsa; it's very flavorful!  We just thought that there was a bit too much salt; we'd use less next time.  We only used one pepper, but otherwise, we followed the directions.

Great recipe! I used one jalapeno instead of serranos because that's what I had and to keep the heat level down. But this salsa has great flavors!

Wonderful!  The first time I ever made salsa was last week using this recipe but making 6 servings.  I made some adjustments like less onion and less pepper.  Very good!  Everyone loved it.  They're sending me out to the store to get more tomaotes to make more.  :D

Very fresh and tasty! We used 3 jalapenos instead of the serranos (because that's what we had on hand) and it was delicious. Still not quite as good as the Garden Fresh salsa that they sell in the Kroger deli, though! Still, this is the best homemade salsa I've had, and I will probably make it again.

I used 2 jalapenos finely chopped instead of the serranos plus 2 cloves of garlic (I love garlic).  Wonderful - like pico de gallo!  Then I roughly mashed up an avocado and put about 3 tablespoons of this mixture in it and I got the most wonderful quacamole for our mexican meal for two.  Great recipe!

Tasty, easy, fresh. It became spicy only when I added couple more of hot peppers to enhance flavor. This is an excellent salsa even for a beginners like me.  Serrano chilies is considered as a "hot" pepper.(~15k vs jalapeno ~5k in scoville rating). But by any means, it is not insane...  So go ahead, live a little, add more hot pepper.

This is really good salsa. I used a couple more tomatoes, reduced the cilantro (to about 1/4 cup), added 1 clove of garlic and added two jalepenos. I also ended up using a food processor for most of the salsa (not as pretty, but still YUMMY!). By adding the jalepenos there is a nice heat- I like spicy food though, so I think next time I could more serrano chilies (I only used 1 this time, since I had never used them before).

Great salsa!! Lots of " that's excellent " comments. But, first time user of Serrano Peppers. Why in Gods name would you not mention in the recipe.....USE RUBBER GLOVES WHEN HANDLING SERRANO PEPPERS !!!!! My hands were burning for 24 hrs. Thanks for the recipe, the salsa was delicious and the serrano peppers gave it just the right bang !!

Great salsa!  A nice way to use up the fresh tomatoes from the garden.  I used only one serrano chili and it was HOT to me!  I will use a half chili next time.  I can't imagine what five must taste like.

This salsa was just okay. I couldn't put my finger on it, but something was missing in the taste. I think there was too much cilantro. Next time will decrease that, but overall not bad, not great either.

I also added a little tomato paste to this recipe - and my picky brother was even a big fan! I am alternately thrilled and afeared that I will be spending a LOT more time in the kitchen making this from now on. :)

My husband and I love his salsa!  We grow the ingredients ourselves. You can't get fresher than that!  We like it hot!  The chilis is what attracted me to the recipe. In fact, I added 7 chilis. I toned it down slightly with a quarter of a yellow bell pepper. It was perfect!

The biggest thing I like about this salsa is how fresh and chunky this salsa is.  I don't mean chunky as in CHUNKY, but compared to others that I have tried, this was great.  Only thing I changed was how many chilies I put in it.  Too many and my mouth is screaming for the fire department.  I use just two.

This was easy to make and tasted great other than the 5 Serrano peppers. Way too many peppers-as these peppers are extremely hot!I think just 1 or so would be sufficent. I plan on making this again and making some adjustments by adding less Serrano peppers and adding some garlic.

I had never made salsa before, although I love it.  This was so easy, and I am now addicted! Use quality tomatoes. I agree with previous reviewers who said one serano chile pepper is enough.  I didn't have fresh cilantro, so I used dried.  The first time I didn't have fresh lime juice and used the bottled stuff.  Doesn't make any difference:  it is still delicious!  I make this at least once a week. There is a lot of liquid.  I tried draining the tomatoes after I chopped them, and that didn't seem to help.  Part of my liquid may be due to the sweet Vidalia onion I used, but this is a minor issue.  Try this one; you'll be glad you did. Thanks, Bluebayou!!

This is my first salsa to make....it is SO good.....BUT ONLY START WITH ONE SERRANO PEPPER, THEN ADD FOR MORE HEAT. I did what one reviewer said and used 1 1/2 serrano pepper, but it was still too hot for me! Once I tame the heat, it will be a 5 star recipe!

Very good, only if you do this recipe as is...it comes out spicy. Not over powering but for those who want a mild salsa or no heat, skip the peppers and use regular diced tomatoes with no chile's. Otherwise it was awesome and so easy to do!

I could not for the life of my find seranno chile's at Krogers, so picked up a large jalapeno instead.  I used 4 roma tomatoes instead of 3, since they were on the smaller side.  Also, I added 2 cloves of garlic as well, just to up the taste a bit.  Everyone LOVED this recipe at my Mexican themed dinner party last night; a big success!  Thank you so much for sharing...

Okay, this should be called Pico de Gallo, but it's awesome. I shied away from the 5 chiles, but with only 2 it was pretty tame. That being said, it was gone in minutes. This is super healthy and fat free-5+ stars.

I agree that this recipe is fine with 2-3 serrano & maybe a jalepeno. 5 serrano is way to hot. I also put this in my food processor to make it more like a salsa & less like pico. I add a pinch or two of cumin and 2 garlic cloves. The best salsa i have ever had, thank you!

The only reason I give this four stars instead of five is because it was too salty.  Next time I make this I will use half as much.  A great base recipe though!

Nice quick and easy recipe, but if you like your salsa a little spicy I would suggest adding at least 1 habanero.  As is the recipe is mild buy tasty.

I followed this recipe exactly and was very pleased with the results! This is the freshest tasting salsa I have ever eaten. I alter the amount of the peppers depending on the spicy tolerance of the guests I am going to serve. Delicious!

Beware of using 5 serrano peppers...  I read the other reviews before making this for the first time (thankfully) and only used one, and it turned out really well.  The taste is very fresh and the flavors blend together.  However, for the second time making it, I decided to use 2 serrano peppers instead of 1.  Upon tasting it, I regretted it because it was too spicy...  the pepper overpowered the other flavors and it made my stomach hurt because of the acidity.  So I can't even imagine what 5 would be like!  Otherwise, a very good salsa.

My husband has acid reflux so we used about 1/2 of a pepper and added a little cumin and red pepper paste. It was definitely spicy enough for our mild taste buds! Thanks for a wonderful recipe...there's nothing better than fresh salsa!

LOved it thought I did add a little garlic and only used three of the serrano peppers.  I also had used jalapenos instead and that worked great.  I have made this multiple times with my garden tomatoes.

This recipe is great! I have been looking for the perfect fresh salsa recipe and this lived up to my expectations. I doubled the recipe, added a clove of garlic and only used 1 & 1/2 serrano chiles. It was a big hit at our party this past weekend.

This is a very good basic salsa recipe, however I would be careful with the peppers, using only 1 and a 1/2 was enough for our family.  Not everyone can handle 5 of them in a recipe.

This is sooooooooo good. I seeded the tomatoes hoping to produce a little less juice and it did help. It was gone in no time.
I also added fresh garlic, a must!

Fresh and delicious!  I used jalapenos from my garden and probably a bit less cilantro as I'm not a big fan of it.  Will make this again and again!

Very good salsa. Next time I'll use 1/2 a pepper and make it more chunky. ***UPDATE*** The second time around, I did make this salsa more chunky and it did taste a lot better. Also, I served this on "Lime Chicken Soft Tacos." The taste was ok but I prefer the "Cilantro Serrano Cream Sauce" over the salsa with the tacos.

This is so good! I make this all the time and store in my fridge for when I'm craving the munchies. The only thing I change is I omit the white onion and add a red one. Serve with Organic Black Bean Tortilla chips... YUM! Thanks for sharing!

Very fresh and simple.  I also added garlic and used dried cilantro, since that's what I had on hand.  Lush!

This was very good.  I took others suggestions and only used 1 pepper without the seeds, I also used 1 Jalapeno pepper without the seeds.  It was plenty hot for our taste.  I also added garlic and a little more cilantro then was suggested.  Our family and friends enjoy cilantro.  I served this at my husbanda birthday party this weekend and there was none left.  This was a huge hit.  This is now the base I will use whenever making salsa.

DH says..." I could eat this all day!" I followed suggestions regarding serranos, used 2, but only 1/4 of the seeds. Resulted in a mild to medium salsa.

This is a wonderful recipe. Its a little more like pico de gallo than salsa, but it is still really good. I tweaked the recipe a little bit to match my taste. I added one red and one green pepper, four green onions, and three cloves of garlic for an extra kick. I also used a little extra lime and lemon juice to compensate for the extra ingredients.

This recipe is more for pico de gallo than what I think of as salsa. It was good as a condiment with the meal, but I didn't care for it as a dip alone.

So simple, so good! This is the perfect base recipe to build upon, we just got a new food processor and whipped this up in a flash. Made an omlet with this and a bit of shredded cheddar, SO good and fresh tasting.

I've used this recipe for such a long time now- I can't even stomach the stuff that comes in a jar. I agree that using 5 peppers is an overload, I use 2 jalapeno's & chopped red onion. I also "make" my own tortilla chips. Cut up a stack of whole wheat tortillas, spray them with Pam and  sprinkle on some seasoning. I bake them at 350 until crispy. Delicious & a healthy alternative to the deep fried option.

Great starter recipe for fresh salsa.
I did add some oregano. I was making this for a large church group and didn't want it to spicy so I did not use serrano chilies but used jalapeño peppers instead.   
Still had good flavor but without the heat.

This was very good! I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh (all I had on hand) and 1 jalapeno not seeded. Great cilantro taste, definitely add the salt, if not a little extra. Will make this again with fresh tomatoes.

Love this recipe. Sometimes I leave out the chiles if I'm not in the mood for something too hot. And I always add a capful of white vinegar.

So easy! Watch out for the salt. I read the other reviews first and thought "I better add more salt" and went a little overboard... That's okay because I just double the recipe and am glad I did. This salsa goes fast! Add some chopped garlic. This stuff is great as a dip, on tacos, etc...

 I added garlic and substituted the jalapeno peppers I had on hand. 
SALT IS A MUST in this recipe, 
but it is wonderful! Just need to hide it from the kids until I can buy more tomatoes....

I've made this several times loosely measuring the ingredients.  Usually made a double batch b/c it goes quick!  Sometimes I'll add in a garlic clove.  I seed the tomatoes and throw it all in the food processor.  Couldn't be easier!

Excellent! Instead of fresh tomatoes I used a 15 ounce can of diced tomatoes and I used 2 jalapeno peppers which I seeded also from a can (the spiciness seems to be more consistent in canned peppers than in fresh). It was a little mild for me we eat chiles almost every day in my house so next time I will probably use 3 peppers.

This was the first salsa I ever made. It was really good and relatively easy. I made it exactly as described except I only used 3 serrano chilies. It had the perfect amount of spice for me. And I did seed the tomatoes. It was very good and I would recommend it to cooking novices like me.

Wow, this is excellent.  I didn't use the serreno peppers, I used 1 jalapeno pepper.  I put it in the food processor so it would more like salsa rather then chuncky salsa.  I make this so much, I have even made it and canned it in mason jars and given it as a gift.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.

This recipe is really easy to make. I made some changes to it coz' my family finds it too spicy.

1) I replaced the chillies with hot sauce.
2) Used a whole lime
3) Added 1 teaspoon of sugar

Love this recipe!

I love chunky salsa and this is one of the best ones that I've had. My husband who doesn't like tomatoes and is vey picky about his salsa liked this one. The best thing is that it is so easy to make.

This was great.  I did not add the hot peppers though; my crowd prefers mild salsa.  The fresh tomato with fresh cilantro is awesome.  I didn't add any garlic; just what the recipe calls for.

I used fresh plum tomatoes instead of regular and added a minced clove of garlic and I also used red onion.  I'm not sure if I can wait the hour till it gels since it tasted so fantastic when I mixed it.

Muy Bien.  Great recipe to start with if you like the fresh tomatoe salsa.  I also used the jalepeno peppers (2).  I liked this recipe because its small and you can experment from here with out wasting tons of ingriedients. It only takes about 5 minutes to make(big plus) I cut back a little on the cilantro too.  Thanks, excellent recipe.

This salsa turned out great.  I tried using food processor as others had suggested, but found it made the tomatoes too mushy.  Chopped the rest with a knife.  I had jalapeno peppers from the garden and used 2 plus a banana pepper and some green pepper.  Turned out a little mild, next time I will add more peppers.  Used some hot sauce to spice it up a bit.  I also added a bit of garlic.  I added corn to some of it, which was a tasty variation!

Super yummy!  I'm so pleased with this recipe.  I couldnt even find the peppers called for, used fresh jalepenos from my garden instead (only 2, wanted it kinda mild).  I love cilantro so for me this it was the perfect amount. Also added a couple green onions and 2 cloves garlic.  I used a food processor, blended more than diced.  I just love it--It reminds me of the salsa I get in Mexican Town.

As everyone else said, remember to seed your tomatos! A food processor will save you a lot of time here, too.
I omitted the chiles (my mom is not a fan of spicy food), halved the cilantro and added basil, parsley, and some garlic. Delicious.

Very nice simple recipe.  I cut back on the chilies, but added 3/4 tsp of ground cumin to give it an added twist - quite nice!

yum!  i only used 2 chilis cuz i'm sort of a wimp, but it was SO delicious and fresh-tasting.  i'd definitely recommend 3-4 chilis if you love the spice, but if you're wimpy like me, 2 is spicy enough, but not too much!

I tried this and absolutely loved it. I did place tomotoes in boiling H2O for a sec and peeled and de-seeded them. Some might find a bit too much cilantro, but as I love cilantro "perfect". I'll never buy bottled again!

This was a great recipe- everyone loved it!  I have made it several times, and I find that 2-3 serrano peppers is just enough- not too hot, but still with a kick!

I agree with others, 5 serrano chiles is suicide!  I used 4 (what was I thinking?) and next time I will reduce to 2.  I like it hot but those babies are HOT!  I also added 2 garlic cloves, pressed.  Delicious and refreshing!

I followed this recipe exactly except that I used six tomatoes.  Mine were very small and it just needed a lot more tomato.  I also added few splashes of Tabasco because  Hubby likes his heat.  Personally, I would have left the Tabasco out.  It is absolutely Delish  just as the recipe prescribes if you have large tomatoes.  I will most certainly be making this one over and over again.  I must confess that I had to make a second batch of this because I couldn't stop eating the first one.  It is Soooo  darned Good!!!

I made this with my mom, and it was really fun. It's simple and easy, but still really good. I left out the peppers, because I do not like spice and can't handle it that well, but the lime and salt still brought a nice flavor to the salsa. I also used the recommendation from another review to use a minced clove of garlic, which is a nice touch. I realized that there wasn't much though, but soon realized I used Roma tomatoes instead of the normal ones. Despite the ratio being a bit off, it still tasted fantastic.

Great recipe! I left out the chiles since I was incorporating the salsa into another recipe. One reviewer mentioned adding garlic. Very good tip! Like most recipes, this one is a great base  with which to experiment and make one's own.

Delicious, I put salsa on all my main dishes and side dishes. I will make this forever. Always make sure to use plum tomatoes, purple onions, fresh cilantro, lots of lime, salt and favorite hot sauce. That’s my way of making it.  Yummy!!!!

The salsa is wonderful!!! I do add some garlic to it though. I've made this many times and now I have the taste test down. What's great about this recipe is that if you have leftover black beans and/or corn they both are great mixed in. I usually will start with just the salsa and then decide that I could make it last a little longer if I put in the leftover beans or corn off the cob. Yummmmm.......

Love Salsa!!!   On the way home from picking up catnip for my kitties I stopped and purchased lots of tomatoes.  I followed this receipe as written and was not sorry.  There was very little left at the end of the meal.  Last night  (really this morning) just before 1:00 am I ate what remained - good grief I wanted the 'good stuff' all to myself.   Oh well I loved the salsa and didn't want it to go to waste.  Yippee....

You said to add half an onion. I added half a red onion. Yuk!!! Too much onion. It would have been better not to have any onion in my opinion. Now I guess I can cut this salsa with some cans of diced tomatoes and still salvage it. Try again partner.

I used a pint of (sliced in half) cherry tomatoes from garden instead of larger type, added juice from 1 fresh lime - 1/4 cup chopped green onions and pulsed everything a couple of times in food processor. It was great and everyone loved it. Great way to use up all those garden tomatoes.

I made this to use up too many summer tomatoes and gave 2 jars to my daughter and son in law.  Got a text later that day, "Dude, this salsa is so good!  We already ate a jar"  I never get compliments.  I made it with one chili, as the baby is breastfeeding.  Also put in a little fresh garlic, as suggested by many.  I made it again for the neighbors with red onion and it was really good.  You can put this on chicken, fish or an omelette with avocado if you are  vegetarian, and I think you can probably add mango, pineapple, cucumbers or whatever? I also chopped the tomatoes over a strainer and bowl,  to control the juiciness, as they  were juicy .  My favorite summer recipe now.

Wow! This is a very tasty recipe. As other reviewers suggested I used 1 pepper and added 3 cloves of garlic. Even my husband who doesn't like onions loved this salsa.

Best salsa ever!  Everyone loves it.  I do however, reduce the serrano peppers to one large one or two small ones.  The rest is excellent!

Great base. i have made this several times and it is always a hit. I made it as is once and it was way too hot. Then I made it with 6 Roma tomatoes. Really great. Then I made it with half a clove of garlic. It was fantastic.

I was feeling lazy and didn't have any serranos on hand, so I threw everything into the Vita Mixer, subbed serranos for one unseeded jalapeño, and added a garlic clove. Pretty delicious for 45 seconds of work.

I kept getting tomatoes in my weekly co-op share and this worked out great to use them up. However, I did change it a bit for my taste. First - I don't know on what planet 3 Serrano peppers would work unless they were completely cleaned of all seeds and membrane. I used 1 with half its seeds and membrane and got the perfect punch. Also did about 2 tablespoons of lime juice and added a garlic clove. Pulsed in food processor til it resembled chunky salsa. 3 large tomatoes and half an onion and fistful of cilantro made 32 ozs.

This is a great salsa recipe. Tastes fresh and is fairly easy.  I only used 3 serrano peppers though, any more than that and it would have been way too spicy for me, but not for some one who loves spicy food.

I did not make this recipe, but for those who think there may be an error with the # of peppers apparently have not watched the video. The video instructions say to remove seeds and membranes. Hope this helps some of those having trouble. Hope to try soon.

I made this with the 5 serrano peppers as suggested and it was very HOT. I thought it was delicious but others that I served it to thought it was way too hot. My suggestion would be to make it with 2 or 3 serrano peppers if you can't take the heat. Remember, you can always add more peppers to increase the heat.

Very fresh!  Although very salty.  I measured out 1/4 tsp salt initially, then added more as I tasted.

I don't usually review recipes, but this salsa is so easy and delicious. The only change I made to this was recipe to add 1-2 cloves of garlic. I also omitted the onions and used onion powder instead (personal preference). Definitely will be making this again!

This is exactly the ratio of ingredients I have been looking for!  I've been tinkering with my salsa recipe for a couple of years now - and apparently the jalapenos were a big part of the problem.  The serranos make all the difference - although, I can't quite bring myself to try the full 5, 2.5 works just fine for me.

My family loved this recipe, however I added fresh from my garden green bell peppers and purple bell peppers, fresh yellow and red tomatoes and yellow and red cherry tomatoes and used a mild wax pepper...I also added a tablespoon of salas oil, teaspoon of white vinegar,and 1/2 clove of garlic...and I added 2 tablespoons of tomatoe paste and a tablespoon of sugar to thicken up the salsa. If you use the tomatoe paste you do not have to remove any of the extra juice.

As it is, it's a decent pico de gallo, a bit too much cilantro for my taste. The second time around, I cut the amont of cilantro, I added some pressed garlic (3 cloves to a tripled recipe), some oil and vinegar and let me tell you. . .WOW! IT TOTALLY ROCKED!!! It was gone in about 10 minutes and I made a 2qt bowl full! I will be using my modified version from now on! Thanks!

Very tasty, although too much salt in the original recipe.  I added 1 clove of garlic, which was plenty.  And I only used 1 pepper with the seeds, which was not enough.  Looking forward to making this salsa again and perfecting it!

MUST HAVE GARLIC, then it's the perfect salsa. Also, I put all in a blender so I don't have to do as much chopping. I only added 2-3 peppers with seeds, but we like it REALLY hot. I think 5 would be almost unedible. If it gets too runny I drain out a little juice with a seive, but only right before I serve so the flavors have time to pick up all that lime juice.

I know some of the other reviewers said there was to much liquid in the bowl with this salsa, I have found that if you seed the tomatoes it will cut down on the liquid quite a bit.  Otherwise this is GREAT salsa, I get asked to make this and bring whenever we are invited to a party.  Also do add the one clove of garlic it really makes it great.

I very rarely review a recipe, even if we love it...I never think I'll have anything to add to what others have said before me.  However, because I have made this one every weekend for the past 2 months, I figured I have to add my praise!  I don't usually add the chiles, only b/c our usual guests are not spicy food fans, plus there is always a chance of little fingers finding their way into the bowl :)  Otherwaise, the only change I make is to add more cilantro...we seem to be addicted to it!  I am POSITIVE I will make this more often than on the weekends during the summer...perfect picnic food too!!!!  Oh my, talking this recipe up so much has made me suddenly crave it...guess I'm off to the grocery store for some tomatoes and cilantro!  Enjoy :)

This is more like pico de gallo (except sans peppers) than salsa, which is supposed to be pureed in texture.  Other than that, this is a lovely, simple, clean recipe.

As you might guess from its simplicity, this is an authentic salsa many of us who grew up on authentic, homemade Mexican food will recognize.  Great with everything but I especially like it with grilled meats.  5 serranos though, yikes... try it with jalapeños first.

very very good. 5 peppers is WAY TO MUCH for us so we only used one. It's still quite spicy even with one pepper, so taste around before adding more.

definitely too spicy :( and i love spicy! i'd recommend 1/3 of the pepper. i also added corn to mine and cooked the peppers, onion and corn for about 10 minutes before adding to the mix, i like softer veggies in my salsa. very good recipe overall :)

A fresh, tasty, far superior alternative to store-bought!  You'll just need to experiment with the number of peppers/seeds that's right for you!  Our magic number: 5 peppers, but the seeds from only 1/2!  (The seeds and white pulp in the peppers have the heat!)

I needed a recipe to test my new electric mini chopper, and this was perfect. I don't think we get serrano peppers here in the UK, so I just used 1 big green one with the seeds taken out, and it was just the perfect combination.  Fantastic! Thanks. :)

The flavor was fine, but it was way too dry for my taste.  Perhaps I need to try a different type of tomato.

This salsa is the greatest, but I also added a chopped fresh parsley, green pepper & garlic.  If you use the Vidalia Chop Wizard, it takes no time at all to make.

This is a great recipe!  It tasted really fresh and tangy and best of all, it was so simple to make!
We ran out of tomatoes, so we used just one tomato and one green pepper instead of 3 tomatoes, and used an old blender that kind of turned everything into pulp instead of neatly chopping it, and it STILL tasted really good!

I just made this and I can't stop eating it! This is the best salsa I have had, better than a restaurant! I am a punk when it comes to spice though so I cut the serrano peppers down quite a bit, but it still has a nice kick.

Great flavor! Super easy! I used only one pepper, seeded, and that was plenty of heat.  I also added one clove chopped garlic and used red onion in place of white.  It tastes even better after it has sat in the fridge for a day or so.

This is a great way to use fresh veggies.  I couldn't find the right pepper so I used a jalapeno w/out seeds diced as small as possible.  I have never used jalapeno's before, so my finger tips were burning the rest of the day...i guess i was supposed to wear gloves.  The salsa was great, just the perfect kick with the jalapeno.

We just returned from Mexico and craved the fresh salsa.  This recipie is exactly what we had there - fresh and so easy to make.

Also makes good use of abundant tomatoes from garden.  We ate it on chicken and also had it for a simple afternoon snack with chips.

Great recipe.  Followed the below reviewer and added garlic and cucumber from my garden.  Left out the onion due to tired chopping hand - no other reason.  A tad spicy - I used only 2 serranos - but I still had to add extra lemon juice to mellow it out with an extra tomato.

For fast and fresh with ingredients I had on hand, this was good though it didn't have enough flavor for me so I added extra lime and a garlic clove. When I'm in a hurry I will make it again.

Great combination of flavours!
Heat is something people will have to measure on their own, but I like it spicy as it is. I would just add a garlic clove or two. Delicious with chips and on toasted garlic bread!  Also goes great with over easy eggs for breakfast. 5 Stars!

I made this recipe last night and it was good, but I felt it was missing something.  I used 1 jalepeno pepper w/o the seeds and a clove of garlic suggested from other reviews but it needed something else.  Maybe next time I will add more peppers.

Great salsa! Sorreno peppers are a nice touch w/ great flavor.  Also added garlic and a halapeno.  Another reviewer stated that it was too spicy, but they ate habaneros every day.  I doubt it.  Sorrenos are much much milder that hab's.

Reviewers said to lower the pepper count, I disagree.  5 serrano peppers is not too hot.  I might even say add more if you like spicy salsa.  Other than that, I added some avocado which was good.  However in the fridge after a day this salsa gets very liquidy.  But still, it's very good.  I was expecting it to be like the salsa in the picture or salsa from the store with the diced tomato and onion, but it was somewhat mushy so I only gave it 4 stars.  I will definitely make again.

Awesome salsa, and very easy and quick to make.  Used Vidalia onions, and cut back on the serrano and added a 1 jalapeno.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

We used one serrano and it had a nice little kick to it - 5 would be a bit excessive in my opinion.  I have made this several times since the first attempt and it's always very pleasing.  Also, we usually use a shallot instead of an onion.

I give this recipe four stars because it is easy and great tasting. I only had Jalapeno peppers so I used them and added a clove of garlic and the salsa came out great. I think this is great as is or as a base to add your own special touch. I will be keeping this recipe for future use.

good simple recipe....

I didnt have more than one serrano pepper so i used 1 aji limo, 2 habaneros and one serrano and WOW...very hot...

My jalapeno variation and personal favorite: 2 tsp garlic and double the cilantro, 2-3 jalapenos with some seed removal...dash of paprika...

rocoto pepper variation (my hubbies favorite) with 1/2 tsp garlic and 1/2 the cilantro, 1/2 to 1 pepper, veins and seeds removed as these peppers are HOT....double the salt....

no matter what your taste in peppers, this is a great and easy recipe...great for parties and bbq's too...

we love it...i just throw it all in my food processor and voila!

obrigado!

This salsa is delicious. I did follow some reviewers recommendations, however, and cut back the amount of chile peppers. I'm glad I did. Two peppers was the perfect amount. 

The smell of this salsa leaves a lot to be desired because the amount of fresh onions. This made me think, "Oh, no! No one's going to eat it because it's too oniony." But it all got eaten with not much of a problem! :)

My family loves the salsa at our favorite Mexican restaurant.  I thought I'd give this a try and the kids said, "it's just like the restaurant! Yummy!!"  I guess next time I'll have to double the recipe.  I used a can of whole tomatoes, and it was just as good!

Made this a few days ago to have with some quesadillas....turned out very well. The peppers and cilantro really adds a fresh flavor. The salsa seemed a liitle salty at first but after it sat for a bit it was fine....yum!!!

Per the suggestion of other reviewers I reduced the amount of the serrano chiles.  I only added two, seeds and all.  It turned out excellently.  Two chiles created a mild salsa.

Really good, very very easy. Couldn't find a serrano pepper, so I used a jalepeno (only about 3/4 of it)and just threw it all into my food processor. First time making fresh salsa, and I will definately be making it again.

I've made this salsa twice, the first time I chopped everything by hand and the second I used the food processer. I prefer my salsa less chunky so it was better the second time. I only use 1/4 cup cilantro, 2 peppers, and add 1 clove of garlic.

I used 2 large beefsteak tomatoes, and 4 Thai chiles, along with the other ingredients.  I also added a cucumber, chopped, bc that's what I had on hand to use up.  I pulsed about half of the whole mixture in the food processor, so it wouldn't be *too* chunky.  So yummy & so easy!  I ate it with "Colorful Vegetable Fajitas".

Very good.  The quality of the tomatoes makes all the difference in this recipe.  The longer it sits, the better it tastes.  I threw in once clove of garlic.

Very fresh tasting. As per another reviewer, I only used 2 serrano peppers (not seeded) and the spice level was perfect. Unfortunately, I had run out of cilantro, so there was hardly any I could put in the salsa, but next time, I'll make sure to use plenty. Thanks!

This is a good basic recipe that can be changed to suit your personal tastes.  I use jalapenos from my garden instead of chiles and season with red pepper and cumin.

this was a great base recipe.  I used jalapenos instead.  I added 2 tomatillos, ancho chile pepper(the ground up kind in the jar) and vinegar.  Held up in the fridge for a week.

I didn't know I should have seeded the tomatoes.  The salsa was soupy.  WAY TOO MUCH CILANTRO.  That's all anyone could taste. I am very disappointed with this.  Little flavor, moderate heat.

If you have a garden and need to use your tomatos, this is a great recipe to make them disappear. my advice is to go easy on the cilantro and eat it the same day.

best with salty corn tortilla chips!

AWESOME! Following the advice of others I used less cilantro, and added some garlic. As was stated by someone else 5 cerrano chiles (the small ones) is extreme and I too love it HOT! Recommend adding them to taste. But a great flavor overall and very easy to make. Thanks!

Excellent and easy to make!  Not many ingredients but the flavor is the best.  The 5 serrano peppers were a bit on the 'hot' side, so if you like your salsa more mild then only put in 3.  Be sure to wear gloves when cutting the peppers as I made the mistake of wiping my face and OUCH!!
