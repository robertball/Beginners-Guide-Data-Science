Very tasty! My hubby and I loved these flavourful pita wraps... I served them with some spiced up sweet potato wedges which I found went really well with this recipe. I used Red Delicious apples for this recipe, I find their flavor mingles best with curry- mmmm so good!

Loved this recipe.  I added sliced grapes and celery to add more flavor and nutrients.  I would definitely make this again.

Phenomenal!

I used canned chicken intentionally to make this simple to make for sandwiches to carry to work. I couldn't be more pleased with the results. What a great sandwich! Thank you.

My family has snubbed curry dishes in the past, but I thought I'd try this anyway (I'd eat it). Suprisingly, they all really liked it! The curry is mild, but flavorful, and it gives the sandwich a great color my kids loved: "How'd you do that?" (I should think of some funky name for the color of curry dishes...maybe they'd eat more.) Anyway, a fun and unique recipe--good way to mix up the blahs of leftover turkey!

Wonderful!  My husband even liked this and he isn't a pita fan.  The curry and apple mix really makes this pita special!

Thank you for this simple but delicious idea.  I wound up using a few of your suggested alternatives and made a few of my own but the end result was a big hit with my family.    For a full review please check out my blog.

An excellent use for leftover turkey especially since my husband never feels that he gets enough curry. Super quick and easy to prepare. I ran out of lemon juice and simply used orange but probably should have used grapefruit for a brighter taste. We served it in wraps and had yam fries on the side. Delightful, will definetely do it again.

This was Day II of using up a turkey.  Really good :) If you don't like curry, back away from tis recipe :)  Healthy too. I used a fat free yogurt and whole wheat Pita breads.  That's my pita in the picture. First time I ever posted a picture :) I'm so proud :)

Very good! I am going make this again. I LOVE curry, so, this is a definite keeper for me. I had to substitute some ingrediients b/c I did not have what was needed, but this recipe is forgiving, so, don't be afraid! Used granny smith apples and deli turkey. Unfortunately did not have plain yogurt so I used some sour cream in its place. Also, I used lime instead of lemon. Still good though. * If you like crunchy, do not cook apples with the onion in the skillet, just follow directions and toss together after warming turkey. I bumped up the spices (like a lot of flavor). delicious.

This is a very good leftover turkey recipe.  The apple is a nice change and gives it a kick.  Instead of yogurt I added a little mayo and it was still yummy.  I think the yogurt would be better, though.  I just didn't have any! I also had to add some salt & pepper, just a little bland. Yummy-will definitely make again and have given the recipe to a friend.

It was still only average after I doctored it up a bit. Unremarkable, to say the least. On the bright side, it did remind me how wonderful pita bread is! I will not make this again.

This was awesome for someone who was so tired of the same old coldcuts on whole wheat with cheese for lunch. Thanks!

This wasn't too bad, but I probably wouldn't make it again unless I had tons of leftover turkey. Maybe after I play around with it, it'll be better.

I can't believe how good these are!  I love curry but couldn't imagine what it would be like with apples.  It was a pleasant surprise.  Perfect for my lunches!

I used a small amount (a tablespoon at most) of onion powder instead of actual onion, and I used less curry powder. These turned out really well!
