We thought this was good. We added freshly picked blueberries, which added some nice flavor. I am not sure how you are supposed to flip these without the insides falling out - we used toothpicks to hold the sandwiches together while cooking. Also, I think you can reduce the number of eggs for dipping - we had tons of leftover egg/milk mixture. I think you'd be fine with three instead of the recommended four. We'll make these again with some modification.

No ricotta, just trim cottage cheese. I let it drain using a fine strainer for about 15 minutes, pushing out some of the moisture out gently with my spatula. I used a day-old whole wheat I had on hand and chopped the strawberries VERY fine. My kids liked this, I cut the recipe in half just for them. I had a hard time keeping the filling inside the french toast. I think next time, instead of using granulated sugar, I might use powdered. It might thicken up the mixture and make it have a little sticking power.

This was very delicious with the addition of a tsp of orange zest added to the ricotta mixture. It would get 5 stars even without that though. I made this as written, using buttermilk. I had a feeling the milk/egg mixture would make too much, so started with half the amount, and it was perfect as I had just enough for the four servings. Topped with berry honey butter, syrup and whipped cream on top for a perfect Mother's Day breakfast.

I made this for Christmas morning.  I mixed ricotta and cream cheese with some Splenda.  I made a few of them with sliced Hawaiian bread and the rest with wheat bread.  I had a little bit of frozen mixed berries so I used them up.  For the rest I used a low-sugar strawberry jam.  We topped them with Redi-Whip and they were a hit!  These can be made with almost any kind of bread and fruits.  Experiment and enjoy!

I made this for Sunday morning brunch for my family.  It was an instant classic.  We used country white bread and in addition to the strawberries, I added blueberries and fresh banana.  We didn't have fresh strawberries, so I used frozen strawberries and frozen blueberries.  My 7 year old said, "This is OVER THE TOP -- DELICIOUS!!!!"

I have made this recipe twice now and it was great both times! The first time i used sweet bread, of course not as healthy, but it was great!  I made it a little healthier by using egg whites and fat-free ricotta cheese and it still was very tasty!

I found this recipe quite good. I did as another reviewer did and cut my strawberries thin and because of that I had no problem flipping them. With the extra strawberries, I cut them up and put sugar on them and once these were finished cooking, I put the fresh strawberries on top. Quite amazing!

This dish was alright. I don't like ricotta so I don't care much for this. But the girlfriend absolutely loved it. Used toothpicks to help hold the sandwiches together and used wheat bread instead of the whole grain. I think she liked it better that way. Aside from my dislike for ricotta, the flavors blend well and I don't have much to complain about. I say 3 stars, the gf says 5. We'll settle for a 4.
