The big tradeoff is that you don't get the beautiful brown color that comes with baking, but it does come together quickly and tastes pretty darn good.  I used a deep dish pie plate, and it took about 6-1/2 minutes for the center to set up.  The only negative is that it is pretty egg-y, and the outside of the dutch baby was a little chewy/rubbery, but that's not a major issue.  Definitely will make this again trying  other fresh fruits.  We're heading toward peak strawberry season in Florida, so I'm pretty sure a strawberry dutch baby will be on the menu soon.  I'm for anything quick on a weekday morning, so thanks, Sally Anne, for giving me a new recipe.

I too missed the brown color and did not like the rubbery texture of this.  It needs some flavoring like vanilla or almond too, it really is pretty flat.  So sorry, but I just did not like it.

Glad for a quick new recipe for the mornings!  The texture was a bit rubbery in comparison to a traditional Dutch baby, so I'm not sure if we will have it again.  The center/bottom part, where the fruit tends to congregate as good.  It was just the sides that didn't do too much for me.

It was OK. We decided not to put sugar in it, which was our mistake. We were looking for a buttery taste, not a sugary taste. Well guess what! There is no butter! It also took ten minutes to cook. And we all know what happens when egg gets cooked that long. We decided to substitute Greek yogurt for sour cream. If we make it again, (which we probably won't!) we won't put as much egg in, will put a lot more yogurt and flour in, and ADD BUTTER!!!! We were, like, so disappointed. My sister didn't even eat hers. Next time, we probably will make the usual delicious oven Dutch baby.

I did make some changes but might have been wiser to follow the recipe for my first attempt, only because the cooking time increased quite a bit.

This is a quick way to use whatever berries you have. We love fruit so added more than just a cup. I made it in a 9x9 square dish. Good and fairly healthy breakfast.
