So easy and so delicious!  I would say the only changes I made were to use fresh garlic instead of the Goya minced, and I didn't need the sliced pimientos for garnish.  It was great without it.  And I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs which was what I had on hand.  Next time I'll try cutting the oil down to 2 tbsp. to cut down on fat a little.  But the whole family loved this, and my kids can be pretty picky eaters.  Two big thumbs up!

This recipe is delicious!  I didn't have any of the Goya products, used minced garlic and  saffron strands.  I will definitely make this again.

The fisrt time I made this it was salty and the rice was mushy. The Adobo, chicken buillon, sazon seasoning packet, pimentos, and alcaparrados ALL contain salt. When I seasoned the chicken I treated the adobo like it was salt (sprinkle VERY lightly). Also I used a small red bell pepperbin place of the pimentos, and rinsed off some capers in place of the alcapparado. You can put the frozen peas in the rice before you pour the water in. I also increased the rice to 2 cups and used about 3&3/4) cups of water. It was so easy and came out great.

Absolutely Delicious !!!
Extremely easy to make, and cooks fairly quickly. Cheap meal that feeds alot of people and tastes great ! Would def reccommend to others.  Very authentic tasting. My only thing to point out is , the chicken doesnt shred of the bone, so at the end take a fork and pull apart chicken from the bones and mix in. That is if you prefer it that way.

I very much plan on using this recipe A LOT from now on. I have always had a hard time figuring out how to make this dish this way but couldn't so would end up going to bodegas. Heh. I used chicken thighs, less alcaparrado (only a few pieces from it), added some red pepper too. I didn't use all Goya products but it still all came out amazing. I added the peas in when the meal was still cooking. I found that worked out really well.

Easy recipe. Next time I will punch up the flavor by adding extra Onion and Garlic Powder to the chicken. I used an unfamiliar brand of rice and like others, it came out mushy. I used 2.5 cups of water because I was using a large, whole tomato (adds fluid) and it was still too much fluid. I, also, used olives stuffed with pimiento (8) and cut them up; mixed the peas in after 10 mins of cooking and used 1/2 a red and green bell pepper. It'll be GREAT the next time!

My husband is of Mexican decent and he is very picky about his "authentic" Mexican food. He loved this and so did my kids! I tweaked the recipe a little to fit the tastes of my family but overall it was a great recipe and will be definitely making this again!

This dish has great flavor, but for some reason it turned out mushy and some of the rice was not cooked through even though I cooked it longer than the 25 minutes.  The chicken turned out fabulous.  I'm going to try doing the rice with all the spices in the rice cooker next time.  I'm not sure if the flavor will still come through the same way it did on the stovetop, but it's worth a try.  This dish has potential.

Turned out fabulous with these substitutions as Goya products were not available where I live...also added extra chicken 900g (1 3/4 lb) of skinless chicken parts...since Goya Adobe was not available, I seasoned the chicken parts with: salt, black pepper, tumeric and sprinklings of off the shelf Italian dry herb seasoning.  No Alcapparado so I made a 1/2 cup quantity (more than the recipe suggests) of equally portioned - capers with brine, green olives sliced and yellow raisins (turned out delicious!).  No Salzon - so I used approx. 2 Tbs. of equally portioned: cumin powder, paprika, coriander powder, freshly ground black pepper and dried oregano.  I skipped the pimentos.  Salted to taste.

Used fresh garlic and also added more olives at the end. The flavours are very subtle so as long as you're not expecting a "party in your mouth" kind of experience, it's a simple and tasty recipe.

This was good, however the chicken turned out dry; which almost ruined it for me. I grew up eating this dish, hand my Grandmother makes hers very similar to this and bakes it in the dutch oven... yum. The flavor was very similar to hers, even though the chicken was a bit dry, so I give this 4 stars.

I used this recipe as a guide, but I did tweak to fit my needs and it came out great! I omitted the olives (don't like them) and bouillon (read the reviews about it being too salty), I used Yellow Rice (b/c I wanted it to 'look' authentic LOL!); I added zucchini (just for fun); Instead of simmering on top of the stove, I mixed it all together and baked it in the oven and topped with Mexican blend cheese.  AH-MAZING!! HUBBY approved! And overall it was fairly quick to make.  Definitely will make this again.
