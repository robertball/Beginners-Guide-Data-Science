The ricotta remained grainy and gave this salad an odd texture.

Iyou don’t like the grainy texture of ricotta, then, why would you make a recipe that is based on it and then give it a low score?  That’s so nasty! I don’t like eggplant, so, should I make recipes with eggplant and then give them one star because they still taste like eggplant?!  Same thing, right?

This was DELICIOUS!!! I excluded the ricotta and added the same amount of cottage cheese it was perfect.
