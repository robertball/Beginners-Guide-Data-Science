A 3 1/2 star recipe as is. This recipe does NOT state what type of applesauce to use. Do NOT use sweetened! After reading reviews, I used *unsweetened* applesauce, cut back on the sugar by 1 cup and it was *still too sweet* (and I like sweet)! I added an additional 1/4 cup of ketchup and a few dashes of crushed red pepper flakes to tone the sweet down. I used this on ribs wrapped in foil and basted the last 1 hour every 15 minutes. Be careful because the sugar burns easily and it was hard to remove from the foil.

I lived in Montreal for 5 years and because a friend had given me this recipe, I never had to go to the restaurant!  As I had misplaced this recipe I was sure glad to find it here!  This is also terrific for chicken!  Finger lickin' good for sure!!!!!!!!!!!!

Made this again with the ribs and this time we felt they were a little too sweet.  After reading the reviews about how sweat it was I cut back the brown sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  Mixed everything together in bowl. Cut up ribs into two's,  boiled baby back ribs  (3 racks) for about 30 mins.  Tossed sauce with the ribs in a roasting pan.  Cooked for 1 hour with the lid on at 350 degrees.  Took lid off and cooked for another 45 mins. at 325 degrees  until carmelized.   These were the best ribs I think I have ever had.  We all can't wait to have them again.  I only use pork baby back ribs because they are leaner.  Can't wait to try the sauce on chicken also!!  Thanks Wendy for a great sauce!! Update Sept.20/08-Made this again, haven't for a long time and now we find it way too sweet. I have been using Presidents Choice Smokin Stampede Chipotole for the last year and it's the best.  I even cut the brown sugar in half again, sooo sweet, sorry not for us.
Michele, Cambridge, Ontario
Thanks Wendy

Oh, my, God, this is good! This recipe deserves 10 stars. It is the best! I made it for a party, and everyone asked for the recipe. I've made it since then and my husband and I LOVE it!!! It's so easy, and doesn't require a lot of time to marinate. It's wonderful on ribs and chicken. To simplify eating the ribs, I cut the rack into individual ribs before marinating and then bake in the oven. It's easier than trying to cut them apart when they are covered in sauce and hot. I also recommend basting with this sauce during cooking. At least twice an hour. This sauce is delicious.

I made a few changes to this based on some of the past reviews. I made this using only about 4 tbsps of brown sugar. I used vinegar instead of lemon juice. I served this with italian sausage and brocolli stir fry with a side of white rice.  My family loved this. I will be making this again.

YUM!  If you like a sweet vs a more tangy BBQ sauce, this it the one!  I needed something super easy with a homemade twist, so I threw 5 chicken breasts in the crock pot, covered with this sauce and cooked for 4 hrs on high and it came out perfect!  My picky 3 yr old and hubby LOVED it!  No left overs between the three of us.  I'm going to mix a huge batch of this up and seal it in mason jars for use with other crockpot/grill recipes.  My family will not eat bottled sauce again!

Love this sauce.  Cut back to 1 cup of brown sugar as recommended by other users.  My niece gets this sauce all over her face from trying to get all the sauce off the bone!  I boil the ribs for 1 1/2 hours, sauce the ribs, then throw them into the oven, I baste after 5 mins on one side, throw 'em back in, turn them over, baste on the other side and then throw them back in for another 5 mins.

This sauce is awsome, It kicks on most restauraunt ribs. Instead of marinating try cooking on low, turning often and basting every time you turn.

In a word... YUM! I used this on some chicken breasts on the grill, marinated them for about an hour before grilling and then basted while they were cooking. I had set some aside to use for dipping when we were eating. Maybe a touch too sweet for my taste, I think next time I'll make a batch with a little less brown sugar. But still... delicious!!

We were not amused by this recipe.  The sauce had a flat, unpleasant taste to it and the applesauce gave it a grainy texture.  It didn't glaze the ribs, but instead, just sat on them and looked dry and unappealing.  What a waste of all those ribs I used it on.  Most had to be tossed because this sauce tasted so lousy on them. Ugh.

I have been making this sauce for years, I used to live in Montreal and eat there very often with family & friends. 
There is nothing like it!! I was lucky to
get the recipe from another source and yours is exactly the same. The only difference is that I boil the ribs with an onion, clove and bay leaf for 30 minutes. When in the oven I turn and baste them every 20 minutes for 2 hours @ 325f.  So people out there, this is the True Honest BarBBarn sauce!!

As a Canadian living in the south of the USA, I must say that this is a VERY good sauce,eh!  I fried some chicken, then poured the sauce over the chicken and baked it. I will use this sauce very often. It is sooooooo very tasty!!!!  Thanks for the posting of the recipe.

This sauce is good if you're looking for something sweet but not tangy or spicy.

Excellent BBQ Sauce....I used it to marinate pork ribs about 2 hours. Then smoked them in a pan on BBQ at Medium heat for about 35-40 mins.  When just about finished I used remaining sauce to baste ribs......Perfect!

I didn't try this, but my boys did. I used the sauce on pork ribs that were baked using the slow-cooking oven method and they came out great. Love that this doesn't call for any non-staple ingredients and was easy to throw together. I'm sure this would be equally good on chicken.

Really good BBQ sauce that is VERY sweet, which for my taste is great. Works better as a marinade though or a glaze than as a sauce on the side in my opinion.

I would totally make this again. I used sweetend applsauce so I cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups. Didn't have paprika so I used chilli powder, no garlic salt so I just used garlic powder. I used Apple cider viniger instead of lemon. I made pork loin chops in the slow cooker using this sauce. They came out so tender!

It was a great sauce, especially if you like sweet.  It could be made spicier for a sweet and spicy sauce merely by adding cayenne or chilli powder.  Either way, it was a hit for the whole family.  Goes great on all meats.

Reduced the brown sugar and added a little red pepper to spice it up. A keeper, though not as great to me as others think.

I recently was serching for a good sauce I could make to be somewhat low sodium.  Instead of the garlic salt, I used garlic powder and cut the salt in half.  I think this sauce is almost too sweet.  I tried it on hamburgers and it tasted great.  I am going to cut the brown sugar in half and add more paprica and then it should be perfect for ribs.  I am still going to use the original for hamburgers.  Overall, a great sauce.

Not good.  Followed recipe but reduced sugar a little.  Still found it too sweet and flat/uninteresting.  I felt the apple sauce was bad for the recipe.  I was surprised as most other recipes with such a good rating (4.5 stars) really are amazing.

it's a good bbq sauce, but it can be very sweet, so watch for the sugar! I would highly recommend cutting the sugar back .

Very quick & full of flavor.  I cut back 1/2 cup on the sugar & used it as a simmering sauce for veggie chicken-style nuggets.  The kids gobbled it up!

This was great on grilled chicken wings! I just got done eating and it was hard to stop. I'm only giving it five stars because it needed a little kick. Next time I will add red pepper flakes.

This is excellent Barbeque Sauce.  Better than any store bought kind.  Lemon juice some how manages to enhance it, not making it sour.  Perfect.  I tried it on boneless ribs.

I give this 5 stars, BUT I used this as rough guide and change these ingredients: I used 1/2 cup tomato sauce because I didn't want the added sugar in ketchup, 1/2 cup Ryan's apple cider instead of applesauce, cut sugar to 1/2 cup and used 2 tsp. of pork rub from another recipe on this All Recipes. I used it on ribs that had been rubbed with the pork rub.

I was just looking for something quick and easy (and not store bought) to make dinner for a few friends. I didn't read the reviews, but see now that I should have used unsweetened apple sauce. So, at first taste I thought it was too sweet. Added a bit more salt and cayenne pepper. The boys were pleased. I didn't make this on the grill. I dusted chicken breast strips with Cajun seasoning, cooked in a skillet with just a bit of olive oil, placed on a baking sheet and covered with sauce, baking for about 10 min on 350. I would make it again, but would definitely try the unsweetened apple sauce.

I don't know what Canadian Barn is, but when I saw a recipe with these ingredients, I had to try it.   I used unsweetened applesauce and cut the brown sugar to 1 1/2 cups, but otherwise followed the recipe.   I found the flavor great and the sweetness spot on.   The recipe relies solely on black pepper and cinnamon for heat and if I was to play with it a bit, I would maybe add in some ground cayenne just to kick it up a notch.   I also am a fan of the traditional BBQ taste, so I think maybe an addition of vinegar and perhaps some Jim Beam for that woody flavor would be nice additions.   This recipe needs NONE of my suggestions to be great, but you could go many different directions with a few tweaks.   Thank you for a great recipe that I WILL use again in some shape or form.

Added honey to the recipe and love the sweet and tangy taste. Also love the way it sticks to the meat rather then running off into the flames:)

I've used this as a marinade for beef brochettes and a dipping sauce for chicken breast.  I also spread it on pork chops after they are cooked and let it sit in the oven for 10 minutes.  I always have some on hand.

My family loved this. Only thing I changed was the brown sugar. I only used 1 cup and then I put some cajun rub on the meat also. My husband said not to buy any more bbq sauce again....only use this one. Thanks so much for the recipe.

Made it as written except used only 1 cup of brown sugar.  It was delicious!  My 5 yo. son gave it 12 fingers up!  The rest of the family agreed.  (I had to find a recipe that didn't include corn, soy, etc. which are in most bottled products.)  We'll definitely be making this again.

Not sure which Bar B Barn you went to but this is not at all like their sauce.  I think it tastes more like ribs from a Chinese restaurant.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The sauce wasn't bad tasting but the texture was the same as the ingredients, apple sauce!  I will not make this again

This was wonderful! My family loved this sauce, & my child wanted more. Will keep making this for sure! I let the pork steaks marinade for 45 min instead of 30, the apple sauce was the main taste that we had. Just yummmmmmmy! Thanx for this recipe

YUM! I made this sauce and tossed some chicken in it and had it on a salad and it was divine!  I did cut back on the sugar per other reviews and think it would've been too sweet otherwise.  This is definitely something I'd like to make again.

This is a great recipe, I have been using it for years now.  I make no modifications as my family has a bit of a sweet tooth and you MUST make sure the cinnamon and lemon juice are in it.  I don't know how many people I have given the recipe to and they omitted those two things because they thought it was weird and in the end it was no good.  
I am excited to try this on chicken now!

I made this tonight for the family and everyone loved it. I marinated the ribs last night and left them in the fridge, then this afternoon at 1pm I put them in the oven at 250 covered. I took the foil off at 4pm and let them cook uncovered for an additional hour.  I basted them every 15 min that last hour.  It was a little too sweet for my taste.  Next time  I will reduce the brown sugar by half.  The meat absolutely fell off the bone.  Delicious!!!  Thanks for the post.

This was my first BBQ sauce I ever made from scratch.  I sub'd w/lime juice since I had no lemon juice. It was overall a bit sweeter than I've had before but something different. Best of all my BF loved it and wants me to make a whole bottle next time. We used it as an extra sauce on the side at the table. I added to the top of basic baked chicken as an afterthought and it tasted just fine. (I'm sure better if marinated).

Great recipe!  I added a tsp of cumin as well to add a touch of smokey flavor.  I used this recipe on my pork spare ribs and they were the hit of the BBQ.  So moist and sweet yet tangy.  Loved it!

Delicious! My idea of what a BBQ sauce should be.  I too cut the brown sugar, I used a little over a cup. I used the sauce as a baste on chicken breasts.  The only disappointment was that I contaminated the sauce with the brush that i basted the chicken with and couldn't use the leftover for a dipping sauce for the chicken.  Will make this again and again and can't wait to use it on ribs.

I used this recipe exactly as described and it was wonderful. My kids loved it. The flavor is sweet and slightly spicy. If you don't like your sauce sweet then you probably can cut down on the brown sugar. For a party, I baked a rack of baby back ribs in this sauce, simmered the rest of it, and used it to baste on the bbq. It was a hit.

AFTER READING ALL THE REVIEWS I COULD'NT WAIT TO TRY THIS SAUCE.  WHAT A TOTAL DISAPOINTMENT.  I CUT BACK THE BROWN SUGAR TO 1 CUP AND IT WAS STILL WAY TOO SWEET.  DIDN'T TASTE ANYTHING LIKE A BBQ SAUCE.  SORRY TO SAY I WONT BE USING THIS AGAIN.  I GAVE IT 2 STARS BECAUSE THE APPLE SAUCE GAVE IT SOME BODY AND TEXTURE.

A tad bit too sweet for our tastes... Will cut back on the brown sugar next time. But there will be a next time, because it was a great tasting sauce.

Great sauce-a bit too sweet so I'll cut down on the br sugar also. I added tabasco sauce & gave it a zip. Wonderful on ribs! People raved about it.

This was way too sweet. I didn't have lemon so I used vinegar but maybe the lemon would've cut more of the sweetness. I also couldn't even taste the cinnamon over the sugar. If I make it again I'd use 1 cup of brown sugar instead of 2.

I tried this sauce with chicken and was pleasantly surprized by the taste.  It was very good.  Has a strong apple flavour which took a bit of getting used to for BBQ sauce.  I think this sauce would probably be better on ribs which I will try next time with a little less apple sauce.  Overall very good!

As an ex-Montrealer very authentic recipe.  I used indirect heat on BBQ after marinating.  Cooked on low heat basting as needed. Tender and juicy brought back great memories

I used this for a BBQ sauce after smoking a brisket and a pork shoulder. This was a big hit. I read the reviews and did take some advice on changes and also made some of my own. 
Doubled the ketchup and went with 1 cup of brown sugar, also used unsweetened applesauce, half of the lemon juice it called for, and  added a 1/2 tsp of heat. Never made my own sauce before. This was quick, easy and delicious. Thank you!

This is by far the best recipe for barbecue yet, I didn't use all that sugar (just too much) I cut it in half and used organic palm sugar instead. That was the only change and it was fantastic!!

Just made this for the first time. Following advice from other reviews I cut the sugar to 1 cup and when all mixed I cooked on low heat to melt the sugar. This is very close in flavor to a BBQ sauce I had years ago in AL and my hubby is very happy I found this. Will be a big hit in our house.

Great BBQ sauce!!!  I am from Montreal, and love the Barn, and this is probably as close as you'll get to replicating the same taste.  Although I did find there to be WAY too much sugar, I cut mine down to a scant 2/3 cup brown sugar, and next time I might try less.

It was too sweet for my family and I reduced the sugar to 1 cup of brown sugar.  I'm not used to sweet bbq sauces.  This isn't a keeper for me, but thanks for posting the recipe.  I'll keep searching.

I make this sauce all the time.  I have only made one modification to the recipe, I added 1/2 tsp of crushed red peppers.  My family and friends love it, and say it only taste right when i make it for them.  This sauce is perfect, i oughtta bottle it so I just have it around instead of having to make it all the time.  I have used this on chicken mostly and ribs once, and I never have any sauce or chicken left over.  I brush on throughout the cooking process so that the sauce caramelizes.  If you do it that way you will never get a complaint about this sauce again.

After reading reviews of this sauce being too sweet I reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cup and it was still WAY too sweet. The taste was a bit off too, so I added a couple of tbsps of worchestshire sauce and a little extra ketchup (would have used some tomatoes/tomato paste if I had some on hand).  This made it tasty enough to serve but honestly the end result was still too sweet.  My kid loved it though, being a kid and loving the sweet stuff!  :)

A bit on the sweet side.
I used a pre-made Rib sauce instead of Ketchup as it contained most of the spices and sugar. So I only added half the amount of sugar later. 
Still a nice sauce.

I thought this recipe was great as long as you reduce the amount of sugar as others suggested. I used only one cup and may even try using only 2/3 cup next time. My husband loved the ribs. Thanks for a great recipe!

I doubled the recipe because I had two racks of baby back ribs to deal with. (I should have made more...I ran out of sauce while BBQing)  I took everyone's advice and used less sugar...2 cups loosely packed brown sugar...it wasn't sweet enough.  Next time I'll pack the sugar and see what happens.  I only gave the sauce 3 stars because although it was good...it wasn't spectacular.  I almost felt like the flavour of the sauce was lost on the ribs.  Maybe it will improve with a little more sugar and longer marinade time.  I wonder if it would work well in the slow cooker? 

UPDATE:  I tried this recipe again with ribs only this time I cooked the ribs slowly (300F) in the sauce in my table-top roaster oven. I used packed sugar this time instead of losely packed like I did before, so the sauce was a little sweeter.  Cooking the ribs slowly in the sauce made all the difference.  I won't change the 3 stars though because although it was good, it wasn't spectacular.  The biggest pain was having to use oven cleaner to remove all the baked on sauce from the roaster.

So good, I used it on chicken and it was wonderful.  I can't wait to try it on ribs and chicken wings.  I marinated the chicken for 30 minutes and then boiled the leftover sauce and used it for basting while on the BBQ.  I will use this again for sure.

WONDERFUL! Don't leave out the cinnamon or the lemon! I used fresh squeezed lemon juice and it was the bomb.  I think I will add a few red pepper flakes to half of it as I love spicy/sweet. I just used it to dip chicken strips in but I will be using it on all my meats now. Great flavor! THanks!

It IS like the Bar B's recipe.  Even my friends who prefer spicy over sweet enjoyed.  Will try on chicken.  Excellent!
