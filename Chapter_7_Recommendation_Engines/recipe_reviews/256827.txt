This cake has a very nice favor and the icing is a good compliment to the cake. Next time, however, I will make it in the oven instead of the crock pot. One side was a little burned and it was pretty crispy on the edges even where it wasn't burned. My crock pot clearly doesn't heat evenly though (which I'd always suspected) and I do not fault the recipe for that. When I checked on it after cooking for 1 hr 15 mins, the burned side was already too dark but the center was not cooked- it needed a full hour and a half before it was cooked through. (We cut the burned part off and it was fine.)

Even though I followed the directions very closely, my cake was still not done after 2 hours.  I kept checking on it every 15 minutes after 1 hour.  After an hour and 45 minutes, I turned it down to low and left it cooking with the lid and paper towel because I was concerned it was starting to burn.  Total cooking time was 2 hours and 15 minutes (and 30 minutes of that time was on low).  I suggest you do not disturb it at all for 1.5 hours and then check on it.  Also I substituted coconut extract for the vanilla in the frosting.   Other than the hassle over the cooking time, the cake was excellent.

This was good.  I cooked it 2-1/2 hrs.  I added coconut extract to cake and shredded coconut.
