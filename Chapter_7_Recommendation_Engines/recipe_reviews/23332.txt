This recipe is AWESOME!  I have tried it with several different types of ice cream and it is always DELICIOUS!  It is the BEST SUMMER dessert YET!  
Just a hint:  You may want to wait more than 15-20 minutes in between layers.  I have found the pie comes out better!

This recipe was great! I used vanilla ice cream for the bottom layer and chocolate on top. I added some crushed Oreo's before the hot fudge layer. Everyone loved it!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit!  I used Vanilla on the bottom and Chocolate on the top.  I read some other reviews and think the caramel sauce would be great as well as crushed Oreo's in the middle.  Yum!!!  I will be trying all variations of this!!!

This recipe was really delicious...I used cookies and cream and chocolate ice cream and decorated the top with mini oreo cookies for my hubbie's birthday. One thing I didn't realize was how soft the ice cream needed to be before you put it in the pie crust. It was almost melted but when I tried to spread it, the crust cracked. For the second layer I stirred the melty ice cream in a separate bowl before I added it to the pie. Much easier to spread. If you love ice cream, you should definitely make this.

I used vanilla ice cream on the bottom and chocolate on the top layer with hot fudge sauce and crushed Oreos in the middle... yum!  Everyone loved this recipe - adults and children!  A couple of alterations were needed: 1) It takes longer than 15 minutes to freeze each layer - probably at least 30 minutes.  2)  Be sure the 1st layer of ice cream is extra soft, but not liquidy, so that the crust doesn't break apart and stick to the ice cream.  3) Don't use too much not fudge, or it over takes the pie.  This is very easy - a definite keeper!

I made this the same day of my son's 2nd birthday party!  I used M & M's to decorate the top as well as store bought decorating icing.  What's so great about this recipe is that you can use whatever ice cream you want. I used vanilla on the bottom and Heath Bar ice cream on top.  It turned out great and  was so easy!!  I'll definitely be making this again-thanks for sharing the recipe!

Fantastic. I used chocolate ice cream and mint chocolate chip ice cream. I also topped it with andes mint pieces (I snuck some in the middle fudge layer too). My housemates inhaled it :)

Yummie!  I made this for my daughter's birthday when she wanted an ice cream cake.  We used vanilla ice cream in one layer and chocolate in the other.  Next time we make it, we're going to try adding caramel sauce.  It was easy to make and delicious!

I made this for a large party and so doubled the ice cream part using quarts.  I made my own chocolate cookie crumb crust (just google it for the recipe).  I made it in a large cheesecake pan with removable sides.  Everyone loved it and I will make this again for special occasions.

This is the best!  I can't do double chocolate, so I've used peanut butter ice cream as well as coffee ice cream instead. This recipe is soooo easy as well - can't go wrong w/ this one.

It's a pretty good pie, but nothing too spectacular. I used peanut butter ice cream on the bottom, and Ben & Jerry's "Half Baked" ice cream on the top. My friends really enjoyed it.

I used a whole 1/2 gallon of ice cream and made my own crust with chocolate graham crackers. I had to put it in a deep dish pie pan & it was pretty full I did not find the sauce hard to spread at all. Can use any flavor ice cream.

My kids are cake people not pie people, so here is what I did (I tried it once as written and I loved it myself)-baked a yellow cake in a springform pan, and then did pretty much everything else the same except after freezing overnight, I removed it from the pan and covered with chocolate ganache and returned to freezer.  To die for.  I agree that you need to keep it in the freezer longer than 15 or 20 minutes between layers, more like 30-45 minutes or longer if you have the time.

I honestly was not impressed.  I seem to be the only one who didn't love it, so it might be me.  The icecream became crystalline and was weird with the fudge sauce.  Oh well, there are other recipes out there to try!
