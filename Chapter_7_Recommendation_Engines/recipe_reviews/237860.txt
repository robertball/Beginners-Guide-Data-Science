I used sunflower seeds instead of cashews, and eliminated the brown sugar.  Just having the chocolate (leftover holiday candy)added plenty of sugar!  This was great with apples and strawberries!

This is genius!!  I saved this to my box a while ago and just got around to trying it.  I thought the recipe called for garbanzos, so that's what I had and used when I finally made it yesterday.  Didn't have raw cashews so I reached for our bag of raw sunflower seeds as per the other reviewers suggestion...and then I saw a bag of Coconut Cashews from Trader Joe's.  Of course, I had to use those!  The extra sweetness and flavor from the Coconut Cashews allowed me to skip the brown sugar. I lightly pulsed the chocolate chips into the mixture at the very end.  I knew if I put them on top, the kids would just pick them off.  Lastly, I skipped the additional milk, leaving the consistency more like fudge (easy to roll into a ball for a truffle-like treat).  I didn't see us eating this with fruit as a dip, and, while it would be awesome as a graham cracker dip or spread, in my opinion the concoction itself is healthier than eating the pile of graham crackers we'd end up dipping.

I can't believe there are pinto beans in this. I drained and rinsed the beans first- a must. Great recipe!
