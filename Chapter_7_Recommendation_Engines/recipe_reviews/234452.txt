Very nice salad! I toasted my walnuts to bring out the nutty flavor, and used an Italian style dressing. I only had regular black olives on hand, so I used those. Simple and tasty! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this but added the topping on top of chopped lettuce before serving (I hate soggy salad),  I used italian dressing & it was still a little bland.  Maybe some onions or roasted red peppers might perk up the flavor & make the presentation nicer?   Probably would not make again, but was worth trying.
