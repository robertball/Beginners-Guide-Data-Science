Very good recipe! We decided we like this better than our usual fried rice recipe. I did add some soy sauce at table, but that was preference related. Will now make this one from now on! Thanks for this recipe!

I substituted shrimp for chicken this time and used garlic scapes, ginger powder, and eliminated the chicken broth. Delicious!
