We loved these!  The cookie is sweet with a delicate touch of lemon.  Then it gets even better with a tasty icing that is the perfect consistency.  Finally, the pecan on top is just the right touch to compliment the sweetness and add some crunch.  This is quite possibly my favorite sugar cookie I have made.  When I made these, I realized too late that I did not have lemon extract, so I used lemon zest instead.  For easier cleanup I used parchment paper instead of greasing my cookie sheet.  The only problem I had was the dough getting stuck to the bottom of my glass when I was flattening the cookies.  This was easily solved, however, by dipping the glass in sugar before flattening each cookie.  If you like sugar cookies, I suggest trying these out!

OH MY WOW!
You know, when it's a grandma's recipe, it's gonna be GOOD.
And this one did not disappoint. Everyone in the family LOVED these cookies--with and without icing.

We didn't have lemon extract. Instead, we added lemon zest and 1/8 tsp vanilla extract. Make no mistake, these are not lemon cookies, but the addition of the lemon really gave it a delicious boost. Also, the icing is one of the best cookie icing recipes we ever tasted. We did need to add a little extra water than called for to make the icing spreadable. Lastly, the addition of a toasted pecan on top really put this cookie over the edge!

These are BY FAR the best sugar cookies we have ever made! These are going on our annual holiday cookie tray for sure!
Try them today!

Made these for hubby, and he loved them!  Ate 5 cookies before he stopped to breathe. Changes I made:
Instead of 1/2 t of lemon extract in the cookies, I added 1 t.
I decided not to use the glass to flatten and just baked them in the ball shape; this took 10-11 minutes of baking. 
Icing was a tad too sweet for us so added 1/4 c whipped cream cheese to tone down the sweetness. I added 1 full t of vanilla AND lemon extract to icing; water was 1 T + 1t. (It was not too lemony.)  We did not use the nuts as we don't care for them.  Hubs wanted to make sure I kept the recipe. This will be our go-to recipe for sugar cookies from here on out!  Thanks, Gram Opal's relatives for sharing (I also love her Apple Pie recipe!) Yours truly, Gram's fan

My brother and I made these cookies together and didn't think they would turn out great, but we were wrong! They turned out amazing! It is really easy and fun which is just what we were looking for. The frosting was delicious and so were the cookies! We loved the little, but noticeable, lemony flavor along with the cookies!

These are delightful - it made 50 little cookies - I didn't make the frosting because I'm lazy...I sprinkled with colored sugars - I'm surprised only 6 people besides me have discovered this tasty little gem - thank you for posting!

Made it to the recipe for the cookies. I didn't have the lemon extract so I added a tiny more vanilla. Can't wait to try it again with the lemon and the icing.  These cookies were delicious. Perfect balance. Not too sweet. I also use an apple pie recipe from a grandma Opal that my family raves about. If this is the same Opal she has excellent recipes!

I am by no means a baker, but this recipe was quick, fun and simple. My fiancé and I made cookies together for the first time and these easy steps were perfect for two novices. I did not have a hand mixer, but a spatula worked just fine in creating a smooth, tasty dough. The addition of lemon to the icing made for a unique and interesting take on the traditional sugar cookie. I look forward to making these every year!

My kids gobble these up, even without the icing. The dough freezes well also. Definitely a keeper! Thanks!

These cookies are simply to-die-for. Not literally. I used lemon zest instead of extract, following the cookie part exactly and they were perfect. I had to increase the quantity on the icing just a little bit. On the bigger cookies, I put two pecans. I will be making these every Christmas from now on. Thank you, Gram Opal, and family member who provided your recipe to all of us. Be careful about the baking time, too. They really are done in about 7 minutes.

This are super! We didn’t want the icing & are allergic to nuts, but we followed the cookie part 100% as written. They are churchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Well done!!!
