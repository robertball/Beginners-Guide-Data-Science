I make this with 2 cups of fresh real whipped cream and the whole box of nabisco famous chocolate wafers. It tastes nothing like an oreo to me - I don't like oreos and I love this. It has to sit in the fridge overnight or it doesn't work! I love this and get frequent requests for it.

I would agree that this is a quick dessert to put together. However it tastes like nothing more than cookies and whipping cream. I flavored the whipped cream with cream d'menthe a touch of green food coloring and made the Betty Crocker raspberry sauce to drizzle over it. It looked very Christmasy and attractive with these additions. The mint chocolate and raspbery were great together but in the end its still cookies and whipping cream and has a tendency to fall apart even when sliced on the diagonal.

Thanks. I've been looking for this recipe for years. My mother made it also years ago. But she only made it for parties and the kids (us) only got to taste the leftovers. It was delicious. We always called it "blow up cake" because the cookies swell up a bit with the whipped cream and then they really look "blown up" when you cut it on the diagonal. This cake is really neat because of the diagonal cutting method (crucial for the serving and presentation) no one can figure out how you made the "layers" like that. A very gourmet mystery. Unfortunately I live in a small town with a pretty ordinary grocery and those chocolate wafer cookies are almost unheard of. I have to go to the "big city" to find them. Sprinkle colored sugar or non-pariels on the top for a little festive look too.

My Mom also made this every Christmas for many years. It has never fallen apart. It could be that some people do not whip their whipping cream enough. we only put in about a tablespoon of regular sugar to the whipping cream near the end. It has to sit for at least 5 hours so the wafers pick up the wetness from the whipped cream and fatten up. Also we have always used THIN wafers (from Nabisco0 and not Oreos. It's very cakelike. A winner every time.

If you love oreo cookies this dessert is for you! It's delicious light and a snap to make. I used only a half cup of sugar and it turned out fine. Thank's Ginger.

Doesn't sound like much when you read the recipe but it is really delicious. An elegant but not too heavy dessert. My sweets hating sister absolutley wolfs this down! Be sure you let it stand for at least the specified time or it will be impossible to cut (you want the cookies to absorb moisture from the whipped cream and turn cake-like). Also be sure to slice at a 45 degree angle to the roll to get the striped effect. I tried this once with Cool Whip it's not anywhere near as good as with real whipping cream flavor-wise and for some reason it comes out much drier.

awesome. something with this few ingredients shouldn't taste this good! It is messy but a kid could do it and be proud of the results. And YES you MUST chill it overnight for the cookies to absorb the moisture from the whipping cream. it will turn out almost cake-like and not like oreo's at all. If it's too sloppy the whipping cream isn't the right consistency. I use less sugar as well... enjoy!

This recipe is a classic that my mother used to make when I was a child! I did change my recipe a little bit though because I just used a tub of cool whip and then added vanilla extract. It turned out fantastic! I will be making this again and again!

WOW!!! So good and so easy! I used a small fondue fork so there were no notable holes. My husband who likes nothing loved these.

This was pretty good but not what I was expecting. I thought it was a little messy to make but that could just be me I am a sloppy decorator. It was expensive to make I thought which I don't mind if the taste is fabulous but this wasn't. my kids loved though of course! LOL!!

I gave 5 stars b/c this as a crowd pleaser sort of desert that's pretty safe. But unfortunately whenever I make it my whipped cream starts to get really soupy very quickly during the assembly. I refrigerate the cream after i make it to give it a chance to cool off. I FREEZE the mini cookie stacks after assembling them. I FREEZE the cutting board i assemble it on. I assemble the whole thing on a board covered in foil then wrap the foil around it to make a log shape and then FREEZE it. (The fridge just doesnt work for some reason and it turns into a big blob). I have made whipped cream a few times dont know why it does this. After it freezes it will hold the log shape. I keep it frozen until serving.

Yummy and easy. I used Oreos (minus filling) and it turned out great (chocolate wafers were too expensive!!!)

This has been a family favorite for over 50 years. It is beautiful when done as the photo shows but we don't bother because it becomes difficult to transport to family gatherings. I just put a thin layer of whipped cream on the bottom of a baking dish and stack them with layers of the cream and a final layer on top. The Nabisco cookies can be difficult to find but don't bother substituting oreos--not the same! Be sure the dish is covered in the fridge overnight but don't try to keep this for multiple days. Decadent special dessert!
