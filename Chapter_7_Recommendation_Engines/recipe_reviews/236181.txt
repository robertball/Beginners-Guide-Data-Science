I can't edit the recipe, but Spicy Mustard means Chinese Hot Mustard, not the spicy mustard for hot dogs and sandwiches. I apologize for the confusion.  You can add any other veg to the recipe!  I never have, but I know others who have and love it.  Thanks for trying this recipe.  I like hearing how it worked for other people and also what modifications you liked!  Thanks, Chas

Delicious chicken recipe that can be adapted to be healthier.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I used 1/4 cup butter and chili sesame oil (instead of chili oil) and the flavor worked nicely.  I used 1.5 bunches green onions and there were plenty.  If I were serving this over rice I would double the sauce ingredients.

Wow was this good!  And I actually hardly changed anything (rare, because I'm usually out of stuff and riff everything else).  True to my style, I planned to adapt on the fly.  Turns out I had everything but green onions.   I did want to ensure a more liquid mixture as I wanted to serve this over rice so I doubled everything but the chicken, butter and Sriracha.   The butter and chicken I left as called for and the Sriracha I went with a compromise of 3/4 cup.  Recipes with mustard I find tricky, especially spicy recipes, as powdered mustard is a perfectly viable and delicious ingredient.  For this recipe I split the difference and used half of each (powdered and brown spicy pre-made).  As I said, I didn't have green onions on hand, but I did have some zucchini that needed to be used up so grated that and added it the end.  I think onions would be a perfect addition, but the recipe does lend itself to adaptation and addition,  but I'll definitely make the effort to add green onions in the future.   Spicy and Delicious would be my subject line for this recipe.  Fantastic and I will make again.  No complaints about a lack of vegetable as the recipe lends itself to adding something in at the end or on the side.   As a side note, Sriracha has never caught my fancy as the craze swept the nation, but then I tried a brand called "The Fix" and now I'm a believer, and that is what I used for this recipe.

I used 1/3 Sirarcha sauce and used water to complete the remaining 1/2 cup called for and it was still very hot.  Used 4 tablespoons of soy sauce and substituted Chile oil with Sambel Oelek fresh Chili Paste. It was delicious.

This was delicious and different from my regular fare.  I toned down the spice by eliminating the chile oil and reducing the Sriracha sauce by half.  I also halved the butter. Dijon was my spicy mustard of choice.

Even with these changes, it was quite spicy. I thought it was perfect. The rest of the family preferred the chicken I set aside after adding the mustard (i.e. No Sriracha). That was also delicious and barely spicy. I'll make that next time for the majority and just add the Sriracha to my serving. Thanks for a great recipe, Chas!

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I agree that it needs a vegetable. I added 2-3 cups of green beans and it was phenomenal. My boyfriend and I are on a bit of a diet so I also didn't add any butter or oil, and it was still phenomenal. Thanks for the great recipe! We'll be making this one again. For reference, I used just over a pound of chicken (500 grams).

We really liked the spice and flavor but wish there was a vegetable in it like snow peas or something.

I liked this, but it wasn't fantastic. I made it exactly as written using canola oil, spicy brown mustard, and I presumed that the recipe meant 3 chicken breast halves, and not whole ones. I didn't have any "chile oil" on hand, so I bought some "La Yu chili oil". I like hot foods, but I'm not particularly a fan of Sriracha sauce - still, it worked here. I was thinking that two bunches of scallions were too much, so maybe just 1 or 1.5 would suffice. This was nice when served over cooked "converted" rice, to soak up the sauce. I might make this again.

This was delicious.  I increased the recipe to 6 people for three not large eaters and had about 1 portion left over.  We cleaned our plates!  I didn't realize my chilli oil was "infused" oil not real chill oil so I used about 3 times the quantity and an additional 1/4 cup of sriracha to make up for it.  I also decreased the butter significantly.  It was not necessary.   I used half white and half dark meat.  Otherwise exactly as written including the layering of the ingredients in the pan.  Wow!  If you like spicy food this is it!!!  The heat was layered exactly as the writer suggested and subtle even though very hot.  Plain white basmati rice is the perfect accompaniment.
