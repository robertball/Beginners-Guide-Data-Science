Turned out very well light and fluffy. I used butter instead of shortening. Plus I added maybe a teaspoon of sugar. I will be making them again.

Excellent taste, although mine didn't rise very high.  That could have been my baking soda/baking powder not being fresh enough, so I'll definitely buy new and try again.  Even so, fairly fluffy biscuits!

Very good biscuit recipe. Great way to use up leftover sour cream. I used butter instead of shortening and doubled the recipe. The biscuits came out just fine.
