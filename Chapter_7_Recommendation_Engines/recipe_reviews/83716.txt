This recipe is good, but I made some changes.  First I drained the beans (and added veggie stock), left out the mushrooms, and added celery.  I also cooked this for much longer, close to an hour.  Very filling and delicious.

I really enjoyed this recipe and have gotten many compliments on it.  It is also very adaptable and forgiving :)  I also like that it makes a huge amount of food, for less $ than some of the other chili recipes on here.  I've added some zucchinni that was about to turn, played w/the beans and added only red pepper, or only green pepper.  The only thing I like to keep constant is the spices (well actually, I estimate according to the recipe), and play w/the vegetables. 

Another thing I've changed is to rinse the beans and add a little more water.  Otherwise, you get caught up with ridiculous gas pains.   

Great great recipe, thanks so much!!

I've finally found it- the perfect recipe for bean veggie chili!!  I love Stagg's Garden Vegetable Chili, but would like it to be more "fresh" and less salty.  Well, this is like a fresher, healthier version of that chili.  I just love it!  I omitted the mushrooms, added one jalepeno and had to use roasted red peppers for the red ones because I was out of fresh.  I made this in the crockpot and it worked out perfectly.  I added about 1/2 cup of water but around midday, it was too thin so I added a 6 oz. can of no-salt tomato paste.  I love, love, love this recipe!  It makes A LOT too- we'll be enjoying this for a few days- yay!  I might try freezing some.  I served this with Fry Bread I for dinner.  Oh, my one-year old loved this too.  He just ate and ate and ate.  Good for the whole family!

We were having a potluck at work for a vegetarian co-worker who was leaving our department so I thought I'd give this recipe a try.  It came out so delicious! I added a small can of diced jalepeno's to give it an extra kick and it made the flavor perfect!  I used all the liquid from the beans but I drained the liquid from the corn.  I cooked the chili until the consistency was what I wanted.  I read some say they thought it was too runny. Not the case if you cook it longer.  This chili looks so pretty too with all the different colors from the beans, corn and jalepeno.  Great recipe!  I will make it again...thank you!

An excellent chili. Omitted corn (too starchy) and carrots (hate mushy carrots) and added zucchini, which is great in this chili. I will use zucchini in it from now on. Needed more spice, so next time I will add a jalapeno pepper.

This was the best chili recipe I have ever tried!  The mushrooms were a great touch; they gave it sort of a meaty texture.  The only two tweaks I made:  omitting the carrots and tossing everything in the crockpot to simmer all day while I was at work.  We will DEFINITELY make this again!

This was great! In my effort to get more beans into my kids without their knowing it, I pureed about half of the beans and 1/4 of the tomatoes.  This thickened it up,  and my husband commented that he loved the thickness of it.  I also added a little ground turkey and topped with a sprinkle of raw cheddar cheese and tortilla chips.  Delicioso!

This recipe was sooo good! I added chickpeas and fresh tomatoes but the recipe is very no fail, makes a lot and stays well in the fridge. 

Thanks!

I thought this chili was awesome.  It is a very versatile recipe, allowing for substitutions based on preferences or what you have on hand.  My daughter and I are vegetarians, and on weight watchers, and this is a great meal that is low in points and very filling.  I eliminated the carrots and substituted an extra can of black beans for the pinto beans, just because I really don't like carrots or pinto beans.   I am going to try freezing some of the next batch.   Thanks for a great recipe

Awesome chili! I added a little extra chili powder as suggested by other reviewers, and I steamed the carrots for a few minutes before adding them because I was afraid they might not be tender enough. A really hearty (and healthy!) meal that makes great left overs! Next time I might get brave and add a jalepeno...

I made this chili for a Cowboy-themed birthday party.  Not all of my family eats meat, so this was perfect.  EVERYONE loved it, and several were surprised it didn't have meat.  The variety of beans/veggies makes up for the lack of meat.

The changes I made: no mushrooms (again, picky family); I drained the beans and added 5.5 oz water per can to make up for the liquid lost; I used only 1/2 the amount of cumin, and this is what I did with the spices: after sauteeing the veggies, I combined ALL the spices in a bowl along with 3 TBS. flour.  Then I sprinkled this evenly over the veggies, stirring while they sauteed for a few minutes, and then I added in the tomatoes and everything else.  

This was delicious and perfect for company.  I served it with sour cream and cheddar cheese, and wished I'd made a double batch!  With a party of 26 people, there wasn't a drop of chili left.

Delicious! A little soupy so next time I will drain 1 or 2 of the cans of beans before adding them.  I also added salt and pepper and some hot sauce

I could see from the ingredients in the recipe that you wanted to add the liquid from the canned beans to thicken the chili, but the taste was awful when the liquid was added.  You really need to drain the beans and find a different way to thicken the chili, but the recipe wasn't good enough IMHO to bother trying to figure out how to fix it.

So, I've made this twice, and I'm actually half way through making it for a third time and I decided to write this review.  First of all, it's really good.  I make the full recipe and since I live with myself, I just keep the leftovers in a huge bowl and I have food for like a week.  It's not very hot though (more on this later).  I made a few adjustments.  First of all, I don't think 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil is enough, and I question the use of vegetable oil over extra virgin olive oil (I think I'm going to try it with olive oil this time).  Second, I used 1 28 oz can of diced tomatoes.  I do not understand the reasoning behind using whole peeled tomatoes.  It seems to work just fine my way.  Third, the intro paragraph suggests maybe adding vegetarian burger crumbles.  This is something I HIGHLY recommend.  You can get "Gimme Lean" ground-beef style vegetarian... fake meat (I'm not sure what to call it), and crumble it into small pieces and add it in while it's boiling.  Lastly, and this one is entirely preference, I recommend adding 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon of Tabasco sauce once the thing comes to a boil if it's not hot enough for you.  All in all, I highly recommend it, it's really fun to make, it tastes great and it's pretty good for you (I assume, I mean look at the ingredients).  Protip: Serve with cheddar jack cheese and sour cream (unless you're vegan) on top and some tortilla chips for dipping!  It's like liquid salad!  ...in a good way.

I just finished making this chili.  Fun and easy to make with great flavor.  I took the advice of others and rinsed/drained my beans before adding.  I used vegetable stock to make up for the liquid.  I added cayenne, a chopped/seeded jalapeno, and more garlic.  We are having this for dinner served over rice.  Thank you!

Had vegan friends coming to a church dinner.  I made this so they would have something they could eat.  They said it was Fantastic!  Almost the whole family went back for seconds and many meat eating people loved it too!

This was great! One of the most delicious chilies I've had. I added cheese on top to garnish, and I also served it with some garlic bread to dip into the chill. Yummm!!

I love this recipe, and so do all my friends/coworkers! I always add the veggie crumbles at the end, and no one even realizes it's meat free!   I'm a little liberal with the spices, usually add celery and zucchini, and have found that adding a tin of tomato sauce and tomato paste makes it more authentic. :)

I've made this recipe three times now and each time it has been a success.  I have tried some additions like others have mentioned. (ie adding a can of chickpeas, substituting the green pepper for orange/red pepper and adding some extra veggies that were in need of using up).  All variations are very tasty.  Also, I have tended to add a little more spice and it has always gone over extremely well.  All I have to say here is YUM!

I loved this dish! 
I did have all types of beans on hand but it still turned out lovely. 
Oh, I added jalapenos and small can of corn kernels

I made a few changes. I cooked it in the crockpot, and felt it needed a few hours more than the 7 I gave it. Because I used a crock, I didn't need the liquid from the beans. I used petite diced tomatoes instead of whole. I used only pinto beans. I omitted the corn and carrots, but added a cup of celery. I added a can of tomato paste, and increased the chili powder. It was very tasty, especially with cheese and sour cream on top. Was it the best chili I'd ever had? No, but this had a fresh, healthy taste. And the nutrition can't be beat.

I tweaked the recipe a little. I added chick peas and celery, and I drained all of the beans I added. To substitute for this, I added about 3/4 C of veggie stock. 
the chili came out kind of bland, it needed another kick of something. Maybe chili paste?

I have already made this several times this winter.  I have added vegetarian sausage or meat substitute.  Everyone in the family will eat this and like it.  I add extra spice because my family likes spicy.  Great to put in the crock pot and let it cook all day.  I experiment with the spices every time and it seems like it is always delicious.

I loved this recipe for the Chili. I decided to modify my version a bit. Instead of using the bean liquid, I drained each can of beans (I used garbanzo beans as well) to reduce sodium and then cooked the Chili wit Veggie broth. For Candida cleanse diets (which I am on now), you can omit the mushrooms, and instead of using canned tomatoes, just cut up fresh tomatoes with the juice. I also added one green fresh jalapeno pepper to give it some zing.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Yum! This is some good vegetarian chili, on the mild side, but can easily be altered to your liking. I omitted the carrots and corn, added a zucchini, and drained my beans before adding. I also added about a cup and a half of water. Let simmer for longer than 20 minutes (more like 40-50 minutes) and the flavor was really good. Baby portabella mushrooms were great in it. Can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch and dinner later in the week!

My first attempt at chili and this turned out wonderful.  I used 3 tablespoons of chili powder, and instead of mushrooms, I used celery.    Awesome taste, very filling!

Loved it.  Instead of the oregano, basil and garlic powder I spiced it up with celery salt, cajun seasoning, crushed red pepper and Tabasco.  Also left out mushrooms and used crushed rather than whole tomatoes.

Hearty, filling and interesting - not what I'd expect from a vegetarian chili!  Great flavor, not too spicy but you can laways add more.  Was scared of adding bean juice but went with the instructions and was really pleased with the results.  Made alongside regular meat chili, mixed up leftovers were great the day after.  Can't believe how keen my kids are to eat beans!

This recipe turned out great, and I had lots left over :) i also added some zucchini, a bit of extra bell peppers, as well as diced jalapeno pepper to give it a bit of spice. Great recipe though, and will use again!

This is the BEST chili! We make it all the time and love it. If you aren't vegan, it's great with cheese and saltines sprinkled on top.

I have just made this for the first time and it was my first attempt at a chili. I used dried minced garlic instead of fresh and added a few extra spices, Cajun pepper, more chili powder, and Tabasco. For the beans I choose 1 can red kidney, 1 can chick peas, and 1 can mixed beans, I also added more mushrooms, I pretty much double all raw veggies. My only issue with this receipe is that when first starting the process I burned the pot due to lack of liquid when trying to get the carrots and peppers to become tender. As someone who can not eat beef I was very pleased with this receipe and would make it again! My husband would suggest to add either ground turkey or diced chicken. Over all a keeper!!

One of my favorite chili recipes.  So delicious and is plenty hearty.  I would probably add some jalapenos for heat next time.

This is the best chili I've ever made!! I served it to company and everyone ate and ate! I washed and drained all the cans of beans but kept the liquid from the can of corn. It makes the chili just a tad sweet and special.  I used garbanzo, white kidney and pinto beans and it was amazing...We ate it over rice for dinner one night and over baked potatoes the next night and topped it with shredded cheddar cheese and raw diced onions. Yum!!! You won't miss the meat, I promise!!

This was excellent. It is different that the traditional chili you eat, and that is in a refreshing way. We had a bonfire party and the non vegetarians were impressed with how tasty it was. We followed the recipe. We got compliments all night on it about how great it was. We served it like frito pie with frito chips, cheese and onions and corn bread.

I got lots of great comments for serving this at my son's birthday party.  The only thing it was missing was salt on the recipe.  However, I did add some salt but I couldn't figure out how much was enough.  But overall, this was a great, healthy and hearty chili!!

Surprisingly delicious, though I modified some things to make it a little healthier and to add more taste. I used an extra clove of garlic and cut the chili powder in half (was still too spicy for my little one and hubby-to-be... I think the type I have is overly spicy, so will cut it down further next time). I used a can of 'no salt added' diced tomatoes instead of the whole variety. For both the dark red kidney beans and black beans I also used 'no salt added' versions. I rinsed all the beans and used two cups of liquid to make up for it (one cup each of water and Clamato). I chose to use canned corn that had a third less salt than the average brand. I was out of basil so I used thyme, as well as two heaping teaspoons of brown sugar, quarter teaspoon of cinnamon and two bay leaves. This does make alot, so I froze a little more than half of it. You can easily add some ground meat of any sort if you want. Many reviewers mentioned using zucchini in this and I will definitely try that next time. Great served with buttery cornbread (the non-sweet kind!).

So I've never made a great vegetarian chili before and then I was skeptical about this recipe since there were reviews that said it tasted like stagg's vegetarian chili(very gross)and I almost didn't try it.  But fortunately there were enough good reviews to forge ahead.         Two words su perb!  Made it for a babyshower of 40 people.  EVERYONE loved it to bits and pieces, scraping the bottom of the pan type action.  Here are my alterations.  I used all the veggies listed except subbed the green bell for an orange.  Added tbl of diced jalepeno. Added an eggplant, cubed.  Left out bean liquid, subbed veggie broth.  added can tomato sauce.  little worcertershire sauce(careful not veggie friendly). No basil.  couple pinches ground cayenne.  and a lil salt.  subbed garbanzos for the    pintos(better taste and texture).  Was a  complete hit.  People kept asking what was in it.  A major success.  Will make again and again.  Oh, I also let it sit on low overnight and the next day till about 4:30 when the party started.  enjoy!

I think that this is a GREAT recipe, but I think it needs to be just a little bit spicier/hotter.  I used a jalapeno, but it still needed a little bit more.  I also drizzled in a small amount (about 1 TBSP) of honey.  I used no salt added tomatoes and beans and added my own salt.  This is just a personal choice because I like to control my salt intake.  Overall, it's awesome, and it will be made again.  Thanks!

What a wonderful chili! Cheap to make too. =) I like to add some extra corn, as I love corn. I especially love the fact that this recipe is so versatile. If I am out of jalapenos, I just add some extra Tabasco and cayenne pepper. If I only have two, not three cans of beans, I can just add some extra veggies. And if some carnivores really want some meat, I will add a pound of ground turkey (healthier than ground beef). However, if you add meat to this chili, I would recommend adding more cayenne pepper and Tabasco sauce. It seems that when meat is added, it soaks up a lot of the heat, as it is not as spicy.

This had good flavor and we loved all the veggies.  It could use some more liquid though as it was almost thick enough to go on a hot dog.  Next time I think I'll add more tomato since I prefer a tomato-base chili to a broth-base.

I am very much a meat guy but as I am on a weight loss kick I need good substantial food to substitute for my usual high protein diet. This recipe more than makes up for the lack of meat.  It tastes like chili, you barely miss the meat and it's super low calorie, 179 calories per one cup serving, and being vegetarian it is low in all other components.  I ended up using chick peas in place of pinto beans due to the pinto beans nt being available and added some McCormicks Chipotle Chili Pepper for kick, other than that I wouldn't change a thing.

Very good!  I made this for my vegetarian son during a visit to his home.  My granddaughter questioned carrots and mushrooms in her chili and ended up eating two helpings!  I've made this twice now and the only thing I do differently is to add a small can of tomato paste and let it simmer quite a bit longer because we prefer chili with a thick base.  Thanks! for the recipe.  I'll be making it often.   It is also a good candidate for dried vegetables and the crockpot, just add additional water.

This was an awesome chili recipe, but for me a few changes made it even better. First I added a zuchini, a jalapeno pepper for an extra kick, canned chickpeas instead of black beans and ground turkey. This chili is quite healthy but to keep the sodium down I drained the cans of beans, rinsed the beans thoroughly and then added in water with the beans instead of using the bean juice. Awesome recipe:)

The flavor was ok.  Because of the undrained cans it made the texture weird and undesireable.  Along with it being unhealthy not a winner.

My vegetarian daughter loved it, and so did my meat eating husband. I made it spicier for them and they thought it was great. I did omit the mushrooms due to allergies.

I doubled the recipe for freezing.  I added celery, white kidney beans, broccoli, tomato paste and more garlic.  I substituted baby corn pieces for the kernels.  I also added a tablespoon and a half of cocoa powder to darken it up...sounds crazy I know, but I've been doing it for years and tricked many a carnivore.  I also like to add Chipotle Tabasco to spice it up and give it a smokey flavor.  Serve topped with grated cheddar and a dollop of sour cream!  I like the idea someone had of pureeing some of the beans to thicken it up, I'll try that next time.  Oh, and I rinsed the flatulence out of the beans I used, no need to be haunted by this meal the next day;)  If you need to step up the protein, serve it over quinoa, or add it right in!

Thisi came out great! I used 1 can chickpeas, 1 can black beans, 1can Mexi-corn (Green Giant).I did not add pinto or kidney beans. Everything else the same but added 2-3 Tbsp of tom paste (the  tube tom paste). I think because  I used less beans and a kept the veggies the same it now gives it more juice. Try it, it's great! I give it a 5 star

This is a fantastic vegetarian dish.. I made it for a group of friends and everyone had seconds. Serve with some cornbread or a good loaf of French or Italian bread for a great meal.

Super tasty. I did find it lacked just a tad bit flavor but once I added salt, pepper, 2 tbsp tomato paste, a bay leaf, another tbsp of chili powder and cooked it for over an hour veryone liked it a lot. I think this recipe will made many more times.

Even the kids loved it and asked for more!!  I made it in the afternoon and let it set till dinner so the seasonings could come out more. I did add 2 cans of tomatoes. I drained and rinsed the beans. My son and I hate cooked carrots but they were fine in this. My husband loved it and he turns his nose at most of my vegetarian recipes.

Very good! I added quite a bit of tomato juice to the pot to replace the liquid I drained off the beans - too salty for me to use. Thanks!

I didn't follow this exactly but it was a good starting point. I cut back on the chili powder a little and added a couple jalapenos, and added a bottle of Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout and a bit of salt. After putting in the basil, oregano and cumin it seemed to be a little bitter (mostly because of the cumin I think) so I added a little brown sugar to sweeten it up. Tossed in a couple bay leaves and let it simmer a while. The result was very spicy but quite good. I used this recipe to experiment with instead of some other fine looking recipes on this site mostly because I didn't want to use "fake meat" I don't think a bean based dish needs that if done right. A good recipe that seems practical to add your own twist to.

My husband and I both really disliked this recipe.  It has such an odd flavour- I can't put my finger on what specifically it is (my husband thinks it's too much cumin), but it doesn't taste like any chili I've ever tried.

This is such an easy recipe.  There's a lot of prep work but you can substitute almost anything and it will still taste good.  Not spicy as written but you can change according to taste - easier to make it spicier than less!

The best chili I have ever made! Even the meat-eaters loved it! I cut the carrots and put two (instead of one) Tablespoons of cumin.  Also, I drained the chili when it was done cooking/blending; there was a lot of excess juice/water.  I Put the leftover chili (a lot) in my boyfriends lunches for the week.

Thank you fro sharing your recipe with everyone.

This was great! It made about enough for 4-5 people to eat dinner comfortably, especially with a side of cornbread! We used bell peppers that were yellow and orange along with the green and red ones for extra color.

This is good and really easy to throw together.  I'm stumped, however, as to what it's lacking.  Can't put my finger on it, but the recipe is very forgiving, so maybe I'll find that missing ingredient afterall.  I added chopped jalapeno pepper and red pepper flakes to make it spicier.  It almost tastes like too much chili powder.  I drained the beans as I don't like all that salty liquid.  Just need to compensate by adding additional liquid.  It's certainly edible, but I wasnt 'wowed' by it.

Great veggie chili!  I normally make chili with ground beef, but love vegetarian ones, so decided to give this one a shot.  Since I usually do chili in my crockpot, I decided to do the same for this.  Didn't use pinto beans as I didn't have any, so added a tin of Heinz beans with pork and molasses (they go into my standard chili anyway).  I also drained all of my beans (except for the Heinz ones), added one jalapeno and a generous pinch of spicy red pepper flakes.  Towards the end, I took the lid off my crockpot, turned it off and let sit for about an hour as I always find this helps to thicken.  Perfect dinner for tonight as we just got a ton of snow!!!

I'm very pleased! I used chick peas instead of pinto beans (what I had on hand) and must admit I added a small can of Tomato paste to thicken it up a bit (and used only half the bean liquid.) But it turned out great for a family get together. Thanks.

Great non-meat chili! I made the mistake of using Penzeys Chipotle Chili Powder without realizing its potency. Chili was very spicy, the way I like it but I was making this for a potluck. I did make a few adjustments to the recipe: no mushrooms, frozen corn, 3 10 oz cans of Rotel tomatoes, 1 can dark red kidney, 1 can light red kidney, 1 can pinto (all drained), about 1/3 c water and 10 oz veggie crumbles. Simmered for about 40 minutes and it was great consistency - thick and not watery at all.

Great recipe! Only suggestion is to leave out the carrots, they have a funny texture in this mix even after simmering for several hours. I also added half a package of tofu.

Good.  I'll leave out the garlic powder next time though.  I too rinsed and drained all the beans and added chicken stock.  I also used a can of tomato paste to thicken the liquid a bit and it worked well.  Makes much more than I thought it would but that's ok since I'll freeze some for later!

This is a great recipe. Although with any recipie, I modified it a little. I substituted the mushroom with zucchini and added chopped broccoli and jalapeno. Also, I didn't add as much liquid as suggested.  Very good hearty chili!

Omitted carrot and green pepper (didn't have) also no oregano.  Cooked on low for 3 hrs.  Very tasty!  On a whim I added a little peanut butter to my bowl for added protein and I liked it, just a tsp.  I would try adding to a small amount in case you don't like it.

I have made this a few times now and followed instructions exactly as written.  It is a very good chili!  I make it early in the day when I know people will be coming over.  A little before we eat, I warm it up, bake some biscuits, and shred some cheese to put on top.  The only thing is that I do not agree that this serves 16...unless everyone is having a very small serving.  I would say this is good for 6 hungry adults as a main course.

Loved this recipe.  I did drain the beans as another reviewer suggested.  I couldn't find Pinto beans so I used Romano along with white Kidney beans & black beans.  Also added about another 2 tablespoons of chili powder to suit our taste.

Made this tonight and I REALLY like it!  I'm constantly experimenting with chili recipes and wanted to try a vegetarian version.  I did make some substitutions based on what I had in the pantry: diced tomatoes w/green chilis instead of whole, garbanzos instead of pintos, small can of mexicorn, and added zucchini.  I did rinse the beans to reduce sodium & gassy after-effects, so I added a can of tomato sauce & a splash of red wine.  I hit it a few times with my immersion blender to make the texture a bit creamier for my 18 month old.  I also adjusted the spices to taste, adding a bit more of everything.  I served it with cheese quesadillas for a super-yummy meatless Monday dinner.   I can't wait to have leftovers tomorrow since I'm sure it'll taste even better!

I made this today. It was amazing. I added some celery and used a orange pepper instead of a green pepper.  I added a jalapeno and some frank's hot sauce and it was the perfect spice and so flavourful.

Love this recipe. Very flexible! i added a ton more veggies than beans and played with the spices. Adding chiptole peppers adds a nice southwestern kick to the chili.

I love this recipe.  Its so easy to make and i got a ton of compliments when i served it at a friends Christmas dinner. I made a few changes: instead of adding the tomates and sauce i used tomato paste - i found it gave the chili a thicker consistency, which i prefer.  I only added the liquid for 2 of the cans of beans, omitted the corn, green pepper, and carrots. I added 1 small jalapeno for a little kick. I threw all the ingredients in a crockpot and left it to simmer on low for whole day . Thanks for this recipe - i'll definitely make this again.

LOVED this chili.  Even my non-vegetarian hubby loved this. I made per the recipe except added zucchini instead of carrots and also added some tofu. Will most definitely make again.

Very flavorful, made a lot! Added a package of veggie crumbles, and some cayenne for heat. Fed it to a crowd of vegetarians and meat eaters and both loved it. Great with corn bread. Will make again!

Good flavour and easy to  make. I agree using less flour and more cornmeal. Adding a jalapeno or two for some heat can't hurt.

I made my own beans (15 oz can = 1.5 cup) and used frozen corn. To compensate for the liquid I added 3 cups of broth. I cooked an extra 20 min uncovered (while the corn bread was cooking ;) ) and the consistency came out perfectly. However both hubbie and I found it bland - I would double the spices next time and add some heat. Hubbie likes to add a dash of vinegar too, says it brings out the flavour more. But definitely a keeper.

This chili was excellent, and got rave reviews from everyone who tried it. The only thing I did differently was to drain and rinse the beans, and then add chicken stock (to reduce the sodium, which would have been upwards of 5,000mg). I would also like to note that the recipe as is created about eight servings (which fed six people), so take that into consideration when planning your meal.

Good recipe.  Agree with other's substitution of zucchini for the carrots.  Not quite hot enough for my taste, will probably add more chili next time.

Delicious!  Personally, I don't like mushrooms, so we took those out.  Other than that, we followed the recipe exactly and it was fabuulous! Made for some good Superbowl food (pretty sure the food was more popular than the game!)

just made this for my sister and her vegetarian boyfriend-- huge hit. I didn't measure anything, just added vegetables/spices to taste. Also added a hefty portion of meatless ground beef, some pickapeppa hotsauce, a can of tomato paste, and a few tablespoons of finely chopped cilantro (which I would DEFINITELY suggest as for a remedy to the something-is-still-missing sensation.) overall, absolutely delicious and easy recipe. Try with the "healthier grandmother's buttermilk cornbread"-- sooooooo good.

I really love this as a base recipe. I play with the veggies a lot, and tend to use Bush's chili beans since I'm not a fan of kidney beans. I also don't like cooked peppers very much so I omit those. It always comes out very yummy. It's hearty and delicious! One note on the carrots, though - when I sautee them like the recipe calls for, they never cook to tender for some reason. I personally love them al dente, but hubbie and daughter do not so I skip the saute and just let them simmer for a while until tender. I think this is a 5 star recipe but gave it 4 because I alter it all the time to my specific taste.

This is the best vegetarian chili I have ever made.  I left out the corn 'cause nobody here likes it. Instead I  added a finely chopped zucchini. I cook my own beans because I don't like the extra salt and starch in canned ones so added two cups of homemade garlic broth for extra liquid. We like our chili spicier than this so added hot pepper flakes at the table.  Awesome! Thanks so much for the recipe.

I left out the carrots because I am not a fan of cooked carrots. Didn't have room in the crock pot to add the corn. It left an after-taste in my mouth. I think it was the cumin. My daughter stated that she enjoyed it after she added some sugar.

This is a great recipe. Everyone who has tried it can't believe it doesn't have meat in it. As others have said it is a very forgiving recipe; you can add or take away veggies to suit your taste (but I recommend keeping the spices the same). I did as others suggested and rinsed off the beans and added extra water until it was the consistency I like.

I made this in the crockpot today for my lunches this week and now I am having a hard time not eating it- it is that good!!!  I omitted the carrots (personal preference) and I also cut the recipe in half.  I doubled the corn (because I didn't want to use half a can) and only used 1 can of beans instead of the 1 and 1/2 it would have been.  No matter what way you make it, this is an absolutely delicious and healthy recipe!!!!

I made this chili for my vegetarian friends during the super bowl and everyone ended up eating it! It tastes even better than Stagg Veggie Chili (my old favorite). I added a small can of green chiles and took out the carrots. I also added a tablespoon of ancho chili powder because we like spicy chili.

Awesome and easy. I too rinsed the beans and replaced the juice with water to reduce gas issues.  Also my family doesn't care for green peppers, so I replaced with a can of dices green chilis.  Very forgiving recipe and the leftovers are fabulous.  Thanks!!!

Great recipe!  I added some zuccini squash, omitted the carrots and added a bit of jalepeno pepers.  It was a quick and easy dish to make, and my guests loved it.

This recipe was easy to make and very delicious. I added some celery instead of carrots, and some corn starch to thicken it up a little. I would definitely make it again!

Love veggie chili.  This is a great basic recipe to use what is on hand and adjust spice.  Will use this one a lot!

Very good, very simple and very quick, but it comes out a little thin - adding some meat (which would defeating the purpose of it being vegetarian...)or maybe some bulghar would help that.

This is an excellent recipe. As with all recipes, they can be doctored. I have made this recipe 6 times this(low fat lose weight diet)year, and you cannot go wrong what you put it to it.
I put in a tad more chili powder, and and about 2 tbps of Heredez Chilpotles with sauce. This does increase the heat big time, but adjust for your preference. Thanks for such a good recipe

I added season salt, tabasco, and two jalapeno's (one seeded).  My hubby is a real meat lover, but we needed something lower calorie and decided to try this one. We BOTH loved it!!!!

The only changes I made to this recipe were the addition of another can of corn and a tablespoon of tomato paste. it was absolutely fantastic, and my omnivore boyfriend didn't miss the beef at all. serve with corn bread and you're good to go

I thought this was pretty good and my hubby LOVED it. I added 1/4 cup jarred jalepeno slices, omitted the bell peppers, added 2 more garlic cloves, and used canned mushrooms. I also drained/rinsed the beans and added 1 cup water. I cooked it for over an hour so the flavors would blend. I served it with shredded cheddar, some sour cream, corn bread and tortilla chips. Hubby asked me to make sure I keep (my version of) the recipe!

Very tasty.  Like others, I threw in a jalepeno and modified the vegetables and it was great.  Also drained the beans and added water.  Cooked for longer than suggested and flavors were even better later on.

Fantastic recipe! Even carnivores dig it. I have made this for several potlucks and events when I knew we'd have some vegetarians. The mushrooms give it a great, meaty texture. One of my favorite chili recipes ever.

A great base recipe for chili .. you can sub various items including meat.. thank you. I usually use a recipe and then add or take away according to personal taste as I read a lot of other folks did too.

SO good! Added more chili powder for taste and used 1-1/2 bags of boca crumbles for a very hearty, "meaty" chili.  BIG fan! Will enjoy the copious leftovers for quite a while. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I'm not a huge chili fan, but this was fantastic. I used all the same ingredients, but I did drain all of the beans before adding them and I added about 1/8tsp of cayenne pepper. I used a processor for the peppers, onions, and carrots and I think it helped with the thickness of the chili. I added in Morning Star ground beef substitute and it was absolutely delicious. Thanks for sharing, this will definitely be a part of my routine meals in the future!

I have made this twice already using whatever veggies and beans i had on hand (although i over did it with too much garbanzos the second time). The amount of seasonings and spices was just right although I did make them a bit spicier for my and my husband's personal taste. I'm a diabetic and this is going to be made all the time in my house :)

This is fabulous!! Make it and you will NOT be disappointed!!! I agree with the readers that this recipe is forgiving and you can other ingredients. I also cooked it for about an hour and drained and rinsed the beans, adding extra water in place of the canned liquid. Thank you LilPhotog!!

The chili will thicken up a bit if you let it sit uncovered once it's finished cooking. I added a 14oz package of tofu at the start of the 20 minute simmering to give it a little extra substance. Very tasty chili! Especially served over brown rice or potatoes!

This was a delicious chili.  I made this for my family and for a co-worker that was home post-surgery.  She and her husband loved it and asked for the recipe.  Followed the recipe except for the oregano (I don't like it...) and the dried basil, (I didn't have it.)  and used all organic ingredients.  We put it atop of Thai Jasmine rice.  I used the liquid from the canned beans and I did not detect any bad flavor as one person posted.  I have always done that when making chili or soup.  However, if you use cheap beans then that is what you get.  Thanks for posting an outstanding recipe!

I drained the beans and used canned fire-roasted diced tomatoes instead of plain. I also used the fire-roasted corn from Trader Joe's instead of canned corn. Came out great.

Loved this recipe and took in account the prior reviews by rinsing the beans first, then added one zucchini, used one 14 oz can of petite organic tomatoes + one 14 oz petite organic tomatoes with green chili's, added gardein meatless ground, and omitted the mushrooms.  We are not vegetarian's so it's important to note that my 9-year old loved the chili once it was served up and I did not tell him it was meatless.

I added green chilies, green onions and a little cilantro. I used garbanzos instead of pintos. I made sure and rinsed all of the beans and added water to make up for the liquid. I loved it and everyone that I served it to loved it too!

This recipe turned out awesome.  My husband who is a diehard meat eater loved it.  He asked me not to make it to often because it ruined his street cred.  I stuck to the recipe and just added a little pepper and red pepper to taste.  I have been looking for a vegetarian recipe and this is a keeper.

YUM! This made a lot, even halving the recipe! So I divided it into containers to freeze. I did double up on the veggies & added green beans in place of the corn; sauteed the mushrooms, onions & peppers in some beef stock to give it some meaty flavor (hubby's a carnivore); & used an extra chili seasoning packet bc I was low on chili.  Tonight mixed w/whole wheat elbows & cheese. This is a great budget friendly recipe, a great way to get extra veggies onto your plate..and MOSTLY..delicious! Thank YOU.

Deeeeee-lish!!!  I followed other users suggestions and drained the beans and aded extra garlic. Other than that, I used maple baked beans instead of pinto beans, I ground my own cumin, and used only yellow peppers instead of red and green. I love this recipe!

Great recipe, it seems...  my husband came home and couldn't wait to taste it, as it smelled so good.  He is now licking his bowl, repeatedly saying THIS IS SO GOOD."  I took another reviewer's suggestions and drained (and rinsed somewhat) the bean and added celery (but keeping the mushrooms in).  P.S.  My husband now added "That was so good... I'm going to have some more.  Is that OK?"  :-)

Loved this chili!  The only change I made was to use a 15 oz can of tomatoes with green chilis in place of the whole tomatoes and added two cups of vegetable juice (v-8).  This gave this chili a great flavor!

My family loved this recipe and the second day it tasted even better. I am thinking of using this as a filler for tacos instead of ground beef. I was afraid that chili powder would make the recipe too spicy, so I only used 1 tablespoon but I realized afterward that using 2 would have been fine. Thank you for a great recipe!

Very good! This was my first time making chili, and it turned out very well. I left out all the vegetables except beans and onions, so I'm rating the seasoning, which was very good.

Great, just needed some tweaks for our tastes.  Made it twice!  
use extra veg oil
Add extra veggies plus add celery & jalapeño
Add Salt 1T kosher
Increase cumin to 3t
Add Chipolte Pepper 1T
less kidney beans - extra other beans

i loved this recipe! i added garbanzo beans though and cooked for closer to an hour and a half, also used yellow bell pepper instead of green and drained two of the beans and the corn so it wouldnt be so thin. next time i think i will add serano or jalapeno peppers for a little kick. thanks for the post! awesome recipe.

I love making a huge vat of this delicious chili in the winter and freezing single servings.  The sweet of the carrots and corn really complements the spicy flavors.  Add a chopped jalapeno for kick!

This SOUP was delicious! I didn't really get a "chili" flavor, even though I added way more chili powder and cumin than the recipe called for (and I also added some table salt, Lawry's seasoned salt, black pepper, onion powder and adobo seasoning in addition to the seasoning listed in the recipe). However, once I started thinking of it as more of a vegetable soup than a chili dish, I LOVED it! I rinsed the beans, and replaced the liquid that I drained with water (about two cups for 3 cans of beans). I also used two 14oz cans of diced tomatoes, undrained, instead of one 28oz can of whole tomatoes. I added zucchini, and about half a cup more of every other veggie (carrots, peppers, etc) and we really enjoyed it. I left off one star because it didn't come off as a chili dish to me.

4 stars as-is, but with my variations it's a 5 star recipe!  I subbed about a cup of diced zucchini for the mushrooms, and added some special ingredients that my Dad uses in his signature chili- two bay leaves, a heaping teaspoon of brown sugar, and a dash of cinnamon.  I served it with a splash of almond milk to make it a little creamier.  DELICIOUS!

I left out the carrots, green pepper, mushroom and corn due to picky eaters.  just added an extra can of black bean instead.  also drained and rinsed all the beans as the bean juice in the can seems really gross to me.  added 1.5 cups water instead.  turned out really great and flavorful.  put cheese on top.  really cheap and healthy, will make again for sure!

Got a pot simmering right now, and wow. Good stuff. Like so many others, I made a couple additions: 1 12-oz pack of browned veggie crumbles, 2 diced jalapeños, 2 diced Serranos, dash of habañero sauce (what can I say, I like spice), and chopped zucchini. And since it's fall, a dash of pumpkin pie spice for a touch of sweet. Also, I grilled the peppers instead of including them in step 1.  Gotta love chili. Such wonderful kitchen alchemy!

This was the best chili ever.  My boyfriend and I both loved it.  Left out the Cumin but added 2 tbspns of Chili powder, extra can of kidney beans, 1/4 cup fresh parsley and a 1/2 cup of vegetable stock.  My boyfriend hates all cooked vegetables but could not stop eating this!!  for sure will make this again.

Very good, and easy for beginner cooks! Very filling, too. I added slightly more bell pepper and beans than called for, and omitted the mushroom. Next time I would throw in celery and zucchini, too. Overall, a great recipe for vegetarians and meat eaters alike.

This recipe more closely resembles traditional chili than other recipes I've found.  I left out the carrots,as well and switched red beans for the kidney beans.  It was even better the second time i made, when i added in 2 (4 oz) bags of Boca Burger Crumbles.  Gave it a more smoky flavor.  Frozen leftovers taste just as awesome.

Ok so I love the recipie although I did change it quite a bit. First off I had to add meat 1-25lbs. lean ground beef, I jalepeno peper diced, about 1tbs cajun red peper, more garlic, salt (becuase I always use fresh made beans not canned) and 1/8 cup red wine vinegar. It is awesome.

Delicious taste, filling, healthy & great for cold winter days!  Even my husband (who never eats veggie chili) loves it, even more than the meat ones he used to make!  The only change I made was I didn't put in the carrots.

I was disappointed.  It was good, but bland.  I substituted spaghetti for the carrots, but everything else I did as the recipe called for.  There was just not enough flavor for me.  I've added more chili powder and cumin which has helped. I've also added salt and a bit of sugar.  I'm still working on it.  Hopefully it will be better tomorrow after it sits overnight.

Great recipe but wayyy too much oregano. I followed recipe and did the exact measurements and it had way too much oregano and was bitter. The texture was great though. My husband loves thick soups and he loved how thick this one was. Next time, I will also add garbanzo beans, cut oregano in about half and do 3 tbsp of chili powder... Didn't come out quite right with the original recipe.

This is a great, nutritious, easy recipe that is perfect for novice vegetarians who are learning to cook without meat. It is inexpensive, as well.  I add Vegetarian "crumbles" to the recipe for a little more texture and protein.

I didn't addcorn or mushrooms but this recipe is very boring. I would have given it 3.5 if I could but I'm very unimpressed.

I've made this several times, and it always turns out really well.  It's a very forgiving recipe.  I omit the celery and green pepper, but I add some extra corn, and it tastes great.

This was truly excellent chili. I didn't have carrots or mushrooms or kidney beans, and the tomatoes I used were a 15oz can of diced tomatoes but the taste was very good and seemed extra creamy for some reason (could be the bean liquid instead of water?). I did notice that there was a lot of extra liquid to burn off. I might next time use one less can of bean liquid. I would recommend this for someone looking for a tasty healthy chili with ingredients on hand.

This was pretty good.  I omitted the corn (cause I can't eat it) and added two tablespoons sugar.  It wasn't as spicy as I normally make my chili but it was still delicious.

I’ve made this a few times.  First as written, then without the mushrooms. Easy to recipe to taylor to your taste. I added celery along with the carrots and onions last time I made it. I actually put this over steamed broccoli or cauliflower to get even more veggies in my meal.

I made it exactly to the recipe and added veggie crumbles.  It turned out great!  Even my skeptical husband loved it.  I will make it again!!  Maybe, I'll try one of the suggestions that rinsed the beans and added water or vegetable broth to minimize gassiness!!

I try to make a vegetarian dinner for my family of 5 a couple times a week and this is now a “go to.” I’ve made it several times now and all my eaters love it. This recipe should have more 5 star reviews.

It is very good and hearty. Followed recipe but used some white wine while cooking down the veggies. It was little too hot. I will make again but cut the Chili Powder in half and add the mushrooms with the onions and carrots to cook down at same time.

hearty vegetarian chili!   Have made it three times - it's reliably tasty.  I use frozen corn instead of canned and microwave before adding but that is a minor change.

This chili was very good, and very hearty!  Next time, I would reduce or eliminate the oregano and basil, but I will be making it again.

This is my new favorite thing to make. I’ve modified it  as well.  Diced tomatoes work better for me and I found that just two different types of beans is plenty.   I also left out the mushrooms.  I do not add the liquid from the black beans, but I do add the liquid from the chili flavored kidney beans I brought for the recipe.  The fact that it starts with a mirepoix, led me to try it and I’ve made now like six times.

It was pretty good. Kind of tasted like a chili flavored minestrone. I followed advice of other reviewers and drained and rinsed beans & corn. Replace liquid with vegetable stock. I still have leftovers - undecided yet if I would make again.

I've made this chili several times with some basic easy changes.  I use shredded carrots to reduce the chopping.  I use only red bell peppers (no green) and replace the corn with more beans.  You can use any kind of beans - I stay away from kidney beans, using pinto or great northern instead.  As written, this makes a huge pot of chili.  It freezes well.  Loved it!

Great recipe.  For personal taste I added just 1/2 tbsp more chilli powder and a tsp of tobassco, omitted the corn. I used a can of diced tomatoes to make it easier. Cooked for and hour to thicken more. I'll definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing.

This was an excellent dish.  I did not drain any of the beans as the instructions on the cans also said to use the beans without draining.  Also I did not see a reason to use garlic powder in this dish, I simply added an extra clove of fresh garlic.  Otherwise I followed everything exactly.   I would definitely make again.

Great recipe. I cut the chili and cumen in half only because some people at my house don't like things too spicy. Added some zucchini because I had it on hand. Tasted great. Would make it again.

I'm not much of a chili person but I love this recipe! I have made it several times and everyone loves it. You can switch around the types of beans you like in it, change around the vegetables, add meat if you are a meat eater and it always seems to turn out delicious. The best part is it makes so much so it goes a long way. Great for football season!

Exceptional. I was skeptical because we love meat but this recipe doesn't need meat to make it taste good.  I used a crock pot after sauteed. Used no mushrooms, used dried minced garlic, used about 2cups of carrots, used frozen corn, and 3 peppers (yellow, green and a red). Even better the next two days. Add some Cheyenne pepper for more spicey but the recipe is a perfect spicey for kids, not too much.

This recipe is a super base for a veggie chili, I tweaked it a bit, quartered baby bella mushrooms for more chunk and meatiness and added a jalapeno for a bit more fresh heat than dried spices. When sautéing the onions and garlic added smoked salt and smoked paprika for an extra layer of flavor. The corn and carrots added a nice sweetness in the background, rounded out the whole dish.

I did not add mushrooms and didn't have pinto beans but the recipe turned out very well.  I happened to have 1/2 can of tomato sauce that I added.  I didn't have a problem with undrained beans making the chili taste funny.  I thought it tasted fine.  I would make this again.  You cannot even tell it is meatless because it is so flavorful.

I omitted mushrooms, basil, oregano,.
I used a large can of diced tomatoes w/seasoning
slivered carrots, two tablespoons of fresh, chopped cilantro and two teaspoons of cumin. I drained the beans and added a small can of organic tomato sauce. Also used  1 tablespoon of chili powder. Kept the minced garlic and added one teaspoon of powdered garlic to cooking pot;  two teaspoons of sea salt - guests raved over the taste of the chili. Served with sliced onion/cheese bread. This tasted wonderful and will be a staple comfort food for winter!

I wasn't so crazy about this. It had a lot of spices, but not that spicy. Chili should have a kick to it. I'd add jalapeño or poblano peppers as well next time.

This was really good and had some kick. I did not have chilli powder so I used cumin. I also added three cans of tomatoes as one of the review said and a yellow squash as well. I will make this again!

I'm pretty happy with how this came out.  The mushrooms are great in this. The spices needed some tweaking, however...I used less garlic powder and added more chili powder and cayenne.  This was really good served with mac n cheese from the box.  Oh and definitely rinse the beans and add water and salt to taste.

Was more savory then I'm used to in a chili. Added ketchup, and that made it better, but still lacked something.

Quite good, but I definitely enjoyed it more when vegetable stock replaced the liquid from the undrained beans. :) -Kiley

Excellent and Easy my two favorite things!  I add adobe peppers, makes it a little more smokey and spicy.  Oh, and I always forget to chop my whole peeled tomatoes so I have to mash as a go.

This was excellent!  I made the following changes - only used chili & black beans (drained one can), roasted 6 red & green peppers, added a jalapeno, extra chili powder (could have used more), used ~2c. frozen corn instead of canned, diced tomatoes instead of whole and left out the mushrooms.  I'd never made chili before and this was a hit at a potluck gathering.  I will be making this again, probably this week!
ETA: 1/10/10  I've been making this chili recipe since I found it and LOVE IT.  It's the only one I make.  I'm currently on a Daniel Fast eating vegan + no sugar/sugar subs + nothing leavened.  This chili meets the criteria and is SO GOOD!

We make this recipe all the time and I love it. We add a lot of additional spices, but we're big on spices in our family. My husband adds a scoop of hot salsa to his for a kick. I love that it maikes a lot and we have leftovers for quick lunches.

I am trying to cook more vegetarian meals and my husband, who doesn't feel satisfied without meat, didn't seem to miss the meat at all.  I especially enjoyed the variety of beans included in the recipe.  I, too, omitted the carrots.  Added some BBQ sauce, grill seasoning, a dash of worsterschire sauce, and hot sauce.  A word to the wise:  Do not make the mistake I did and add water to the pot before it has started to simmer, unless you want soup instead of chili. I should have trusted the recipe!  It was still good that way, though, if you want a soup.  I made a big, cakelike pan of cornbread to go with this, which was just heavenly.

Great recipe, except we deleted the carrots, added 3 TBL chili powder, 1/2 tsp oregano, added jalepenos--1/4 c jar, and then added 1 large can of tomato juice, we thought it might be too dry for our tastes.  Also just used one can of diced tomotoes and added juice with all the veggies.  We loved how spicy it was so we will keep it. We served it with corn bread muffins and added cheese and sour cream, and chips to each inidividual bowl.
