Good, quick family recipe, but I found it needed seasoning (basil & oregano & a few tablespoons of good olive oil).  I also added fresh sliced mushrooms in w/ the chicken after it was browned and then added it all to the sauce mixture.

a really nice skillet meal without that hamburger helper box and the salt that comes with it!  I used crispy chicken for some texture and added it at the end.  Kind of a chicken parm skillet.

I gave this a 5 because it has potential.  However, if you use the sauce in the recipe, it's on the bland side.  Use your favorite pasta sauce or homemade .  I also added mushrooms and used just one cup of the cheese.  Very good--YUM.  My husband had 3 helpings (but who was counting).

Very easy! I used to make a "Beefaroni" dish like this but with ground beef, but baked it in the oven.  This is similar but takes less time because it just heats up on the stove.  I used only 2 cups chicken, but 2 1/2 cups noodles (maybe a little too much for my pan - but perfect for dinner and leftovers for lunch).  I used 1 1/2 cans Hunts Garlic and Herb tomato sauce (gave it more flavor).

Great, never cooked pasta that way.  I didn't have any chicken on hand, so I used chicken sausages, and used tortelinni.  Came out great.  I also left out the mozzerella cheese in the end, it because i was using cheese tortalinni. Very Yummy

I used chicken breast and seasoned them with garlic salt, pepper, crushed red pepper, and italian seasonings.  Also added a little alredo (3/4 cup for the whole recipe) and drizzled it on top right before serving. My family absolutely loved it!

I made this recipe simply to use up some random pasta that I had leftover from various other recipes.  This time around I had about 1/2 cup of alphabets and 1 cup of radiatore...lol.  Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised this turned out so tasty for something so ridiculously simple.  I did spice it up a bit with pepper and Italian Seasoning.  I also added sauteed mushrooms and garlic to it.  Fixed a big fresh salad to go with it and DONE - so quick! The whole family enjoyed this meal!  I think it would be great with a green pepper added to it too.

A really simple,  inexpensive dish to make on a weeknight.  Added some Italian seasoning to the sauce and when I cooked the chicken.  Yum!

Makes a great "go to" recipe on weeknights because it's super fast and easy. You might need to add a little more seasoning though

It was too plain the first night, it needed seasonings or something. It was edible of course, but not something I would really want second helpings of; but the leftovers tasted so much better! Even tasted good cold!

I made it almost exactly as written and it was great. Only change I made was sprinkling a good amount of my italian seasonings mix into the finished product.. Can't really tell if it helped.  A few notes: *To those who don't know how much mozzarella cheese to buy: 1 1/2 cups is roughly 1/2 lb.  *When you sprinkle the mozzarella on top at the end, just let it sit so that the dish gets a nice cheesy top to it. *I would probably cut down on the amount of chicken in this recipe to a bit over a pound, and maybe next time I'll add some onions and bell peppers. *I had to drain the juices from the chicken and add some more oil to get the pieces to brown.

This was a fantastic starting point for a recipe.  I definitely added a few more spices - basil, oregano and chilli flakes.  To make it a little more special, I made a lovely topping of bread crumbs, freshly grated parmesan cheese, fresh parsley and olive oil. I sprinkled it on the top before baking and it created this light and crispy topping that my husband raved about.

This was pretty good and EASY to make...i misread and put in raw chicken instead of cooked chicken before adding the sauce and it still turned out good...also, i added about a teaspoon and a half of sugar to take the "tangy-ness" out of the sauce.  Great recipe!

I hate rating something and saying to change it but just listen. Instead of chicken I use half sweet italian sausage and half spicy italian sausage. This is so so easy and delicious. It's the most requested dinner in my house!

I made this last night because my husband said "oh that looks good." I really liked the simplicity of this. The only change I made was to use cheddar instead of mozzarella beacause that is what I had on hand. Oh I also used shells instead of macaroni but It was great. I will make this again as I usually have all the ingredients on hand and it's a super simple weeknight meal.

A good recipe. Quick, simple yet very tasty. I happened to have 2 strips of left over bacon from breakfast. I break up the bacon into bits and added to the recipe. It does give it a good flavor but perhaps not so healthy. Next time I will try to make this exactly as described. I'm sure it'll be great.
