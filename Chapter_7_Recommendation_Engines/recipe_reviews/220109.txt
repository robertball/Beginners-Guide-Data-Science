I recently purchased a can of Creole sauce and that inspired me to look for a recipe that I can home-can with tomatoes this summer.  This looks like the one!  I'll have to leave out the clam juice and chicken bouillon then check with pH strips to determine whether to waterbath or pressure can, (if marginal I can add citric acid) but I love to put up sauces like this in the summer for quick dinners the rest of the year.  The only ingredient I see missing is garlic.  Will update this review after I get a chance to put up a batch.  Thanks for a fabulous idea!!!UPDATE: I have canned mega batches of this already and it's only mid-June!  Added 2 T. of citric acid per 8 lb. of tomatoes.  Processed in boiling waterbath for 70 minutes for pints.  Used a pint the other night as a test run to make a Creole meatloaf...and it was FAR better than the original purchased product.  You hit the nail on the head with this recipe!!!

This is very similiar to my creole recipe but I need to stop making it with a roux-too many calories. This looks harmless and I hadn't thought to make a big batch and freeze it. Great idea! Thanks. I'll let you know how we like it when I get to it.

I have been introduced to a Creole seasoning called "Slap Ya'Mama" as well as Emeril's "Bayou Blast". Using either one of those will get you where you need to go as far as seasoning.

I made this recipe (nod to other reviewers) and didn't like it at all. several things stuck out after tasting this, the first was that carrot didn't have any place in this recip. Maybe it's a natural attempt to sofen the tomato acidity but that flavor was off along with the orange, wich had no place whatsoever here. The herbs which were all marked as optional and either a pinch or to taste are THE key flavors in this recipe and I had to bump them all up to 1T of oregano, 1T of thyme and bisil. The base flavor was very weak also, I added about 1t each of garlic and onion powder to help boost that up. The red pepper flake, also necessary, should be to taste because the red pepper you have on your shelf may differ from the one on mine. Mine was fresher and using the full measure given here it was very spicy. Just using another recipe would be easier in the end. Good luck to you.

Emily, I am new to canning and want to can this totally awesome recipe. I love the clam juice I can't imagine with out it. Why leave it and chicken broth out ? Why add acid and bathe 70 min instead of 20?  This is great to add to hot Italian sausage, bell peppers, onion, chunks of tomatoes, and put over dirty rice! Yum yum.
