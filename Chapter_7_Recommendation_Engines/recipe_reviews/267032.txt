Easy to make and my family loved it. I used regular Ritz type crackers because I didn t like the cheese flavored ones. I also added a little sugar to bring out the sweetness of the carrots. Will definitely make it again.

Tasty new way to make carrots! This was an easy to assemble casserole that baked up cheesy and light! We loved it! This would be a nice addition to a Thanksgiving meal or a nice change anytime. Will make again!

It turned out delightful Everyone liked it. We all had to salt it a little more on our own serving but that s better than to have it too salty. We will make it again.
