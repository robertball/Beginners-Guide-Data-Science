I love the flavors, would reduce sugar a bit and need to find a way to form this up. Maybe less juice from pineapple.

I've never reviewed anything on this site, but after making this salad, I thought I needed to. This jello salad did not jell at all. Perhaps it was my error thinking that it would. The consistency was that of regular cranberry sauce. It was WAY too sweet. Please find another recipie for cranberry jello salad,
