Yes you should soak the chilis before...Add them to a pan and bring to a boil cover and let soak for 30 minutes I did! But strain that soaking water and gradually add to your blender to blend the mixture...It worked for me along with lot's of garlic.

You definitely need to cook the peppers in the water before blending them.  Add 3 or 4 chicken bouillon cubes and one coarsely chopped onion to the water, along with the other ingredients, bring to a boil, cook peppers at least 10 or 15 minutes.  Remove peppers from water, add to blender, add just enough of reserved cooking liquid to blend.  You will need to blend these for a really really long time.  When you think they are done, blend them again.  Strain through a fine mesh strainer, and you will have perfect red chili!

This was ok. I had to modify a lot. I used New Mexico chilis, and when blending, I added powdered cumin, and chicken bullion. In a pot, I let simmer for a few minutes to get the flavors "marry". Much, much tastier.

This recipe was a good starting point, I agree you need to either cook or soak the chiles, i soaked mine in about 1.5 cups of pork stock, seemed to work pretty well.

Maybe I made a mistake but 5 cups of water seemed a bit much for my margaretta blender. Also was I suppose to soak the pods because blending they just broke them up. Anyway if I try again I will soak and maybe use chicken or beef broth for liquid. Over all it did not make a good sauce for tamales. Maybe someone else will have better luck

I used this for chicken instead of pork and it turned out pretty good. As others have noted, you must bring the chile's back to life by soaking them in hot liquid. On that note, next time I will re hydrate them in stock and then use that instead of water. I wanted to make as written the first go around but I think using stock instead of water  would bump this 4 star rating to a 5. This made delicious tamale filling!
