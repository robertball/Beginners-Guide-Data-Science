I have used this site many times and have found some very good recipes but have never made the effort to rate until making this for New Year's.It took me back many years ago,to my late mother and her family who were of Eastern European descent.Followed the recipe as written,with the exception of the caraway seeds that were not available in my local stores.I also used a skinless smoked sausage that I had on hand,cutting it in sandwich size pieces and adding,in error,at the beginning.Stirred a couple of times during cooking and the aroma filled the kitchen.Following tradition,I served it with mashed potatoes and corn.Received rave reviews even from my sister who,in the past,said she did not like sweetened kraut.It was even better the next day.Adding this to my recipe book.Thank you!

I have to tell you, I was very nervous about following this recipe as written, but I'm glad I did.    I only varied from the recipe in two minor details; one, I cooked on high for half the time, and two, I didn't rinse the sauerkraut, but I did drain.   I am the kind of guy that likes sauerkraut and kielbasa or sausage in the slow cooker, all alone.   Juice and all from the sauerkraut.   So when I saw this, with the sweetness added and the juice drained, I didn't know where it would take me.   I was really thinking about even eliminating the caraway, but I'm glad I put my faith in the recipe.   I liked this perfect as written.   Will I always make it this way?   Probably not, but I will definitely make it again, just as written.   As much of a fan of the sourness of sauerkraut that I am, I didn't find this too sweet at all.   The onions kind of got absorbed in and I didn't notice them, but I'm sure they added to the experience.   The carrots were a nice diversion.   5 stars MellieLynn.   Thank you!

Nice recipe. I cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and used chicken broth instead of water cuz I had it left over from another recipe. Authentic, polish dish. I served with mashed potatoes.

This is a great recipe. I substituted beer for the liquid and served it over homemade mashed potatoes!

Would give it 5 stars except that I changed a little and don't think it's right to give a 5 if I've added/changed anything.  Basic recipe is very good.  Used beer instead of water, and sautéed everything before putting it all together in crock pot.  Also added some ground mustard to fit our taste.  We all loved it!  Think sautéing before helps meld the flavors even more.  
THanks for the recipe.  It's now in my favorites slot!!

Very good!  I had very little brown sugar (probably about 1/4 cup or less) so that is all I used and it was fine.  I don't think I would want it much sweeter.  I had frozen smoked sausage and was going to be in and out all day so I went ahead and added it at the beginning.  Served with homemade potato salad it was a heavenly meal!

I made this exactly like the recipe said except that I left out the carrots simply because I didn't have any.  Also, I cooked it on top of the stove as it was a last minute meal.  It was delicious!  Next time I will double the kielbasa because we had quite a bit of sauerkraut left over.  I will definitely make this again1

I loved this! I used brats because that's what I had. I only used 1/4 cup brown sugar and it was plenty sweet for me. I didn't rinse the sauerkraut, only drained, I like the tart flavor. I used a bottle of dark beer instead of water, one reviewer's suggestion.  I threw in some fingerling potatoes  as well as about a tablespoon of mustard.  Excellent with some crusty bread to soak up the delicious broth !

Searching   for a recipe to use the sausage and sauerkraut that I needed to use up, led me to this slow cooker recipe.  Let me tell you, this is one sweet dish - in more ways than one.  Delish describes it.  Made it exactly as written and no reason to change. It made  enough for my husband and I to enjoy a couple of times. Definitely on my rotation list.

Just made this for dinner this evening as hubby wanted something "different." I followed the recipe exactly as written & it's absolutely delicious! It reminds me of a cabbage dish we get at our favorite German restaurant! Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!

This was an easy delicious dish. Used homemade kraut which always tastes so much better.

We really enjoyed the sauerkraut. I like sauerkraut usually, but my family doesn’t. It was terrific finding a recipe that everyone wanted to eat!

I made this for the first time today. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because my husband and I have never had sauerkraut before. My husband plain hates the taste of sauerkraut...so nothing against the recipe...and I thought it was okay. I don't have anything to compare it to...but as a first time taste of sauerkraut I ate the whole thing.

I made this exactly as the recipe specified. I did condense the cook time, cooking for a total of 6 hours with 2 hours on high, and it was quite tasty!  I will be making this again!
