I have some suggestions to make this a five star recipe. The suggested "kick" needed is not the perfect dressing, but is, instead, the perfect blend of spices-- garlic and a little cayenne pepper or diced jalapeno. For those who wish to marinate more then 15 minutes, wait to add the avocado until just before serving, otherwise it gets soggy. And if you want to marinate overnight, there is no need to cook the shrimp at all, as the lime juice will do so.   I sauteed the shrimp lightly with olive oil and a bit of Cajun spices, then added all the ingredients plus garlic, cayenne pepper and a bit of red onion.  Then I marinated it for an hour. My husband and I spent a year in Baja MX and Central America and we ate all versions of this dish, so we have tasted it all! He had two helpings and finished his plate. This version is a keeper!

This recipe was absolutely fabulous. I made it in November, so the tomatoes were not the best, but it still came out fantastic.  I used a yellow bell pepper for color, I think red would go well too.  Use the lime juice like the recipe calls for and let it set in the refrigerator for more than 15 minutes (I left it overnight). Allows the flavors to blend. Everyone in my wine class loved it.  I can't wait to try it again with home-grown tomatoes next summer.

Since I love all the individual ingredients (avocado, shrimp, pepper, tomato, CILANTRO, etc) that part was yummy.  However, as much as I like a nice salad with EVOO, lime juice, salt and pepper, I found the same boring on this shrimp salad.  As the submitter says in her heading, trying a favorite salad dressing might work.  The base ingredients are great... finding the right dressing combination could make it a five star recipe.

I was surprised how great this was even without any oil in the dressing--there's something about that lime juice and avocado together. Definitely let it sit for at least 15 minutes (I left mine for a few hours) because the flavors really come out after it's "rested" for a bit. I will make this again for sure. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this tonight & it was delicious. I went to the store & got home & realized that I did not have all the veggies that I needed so I improvised. 1st I boiled the shrimps w/old bay & onion & garlic.  I thinly sliced the onions, cubed the avocado & cut the shrimp into bite size pieces.  I then squirted fresh lime juice over the top. I let it set for about 15 mins, the kids could not wait to eat it. It was a HIT!!!  Everyone loved it, even the hubby!! I cut my avocado too small, so it kind of made it like a dressing because it was all smashed.  Next time if I make it for a group, I will keep the avocado pieces bigger. This dish was even better a few hours later!! My hubby said to add cucumbers next time. Next time, I'll try and add the tomatoes.  Mine are still green in the garden.

My 17 yr old son found this recipe in a magazine and used jalapeno peppers instead of the green peppers.  He removed the seeds, but it still had a nice kick to it.  We served it with some seared scallops and it made a wonderful summer meal.  Its like cerviche, so it would be good with tortilla chips too.

Recipe was perfect as is. Many different ways to kick it up as others shared. All were great. I even had to use frozen shrimp once. Make sure they are thawed and dried with paper towels before adding.

I added thinly sliced persian cucumbers, fresh corn and pineapple.  I cooked the shrimp with green onion, jalepeno, butter, lime juice and pineapple.  Amazing!  The pineapple makes it!

I did not like this. Way too much effort for a recipe that comes with minimal flavor. Also, I thought half a bunch of cilantro was too much... and even using 1/4 of the cilantro was still strong. Won't be trying this again.

Yep, the reviews are correct.  This is a family winner.  
It also makes great shrimp tacos.  We used corn tortillas.  I did add jalapeno and garlic powder.  Also, I did not salt.

I made this with a home made Cilantro Vinaigrette dressing. I've made it to recipe as well, and think the flavors are fabulous either way. It is an excellent combination of flavors.

Excellent! I made some adjustments as per others suggestions. Sauteed the shrimp in some EVOO. I also added garlic, crushed chili flakes, and another splash of EVOO to the lime juice. I was worried this would be bland but it was a perfect blend of fresh flavors.

Very good. Best when sits overnight. I added diced fresh jalapeno, smoky paprika and red pepper flakes to punch up the spice. Served on flatbread crackers and Bibb lettuce.

This was pretty good although next time I will use less bell pepper (I used red and yellow) and add another veggie to the mix.  For seasoning, I used kosher salt and garlic pepper.  The lime juice was wonderful in this dish.

This was a fabulous salad however I used the dressing from the "Mexican Bean Salad" on Allrecipes and it was even better than just lime juice.  I also added frozen corn and some diced jalepeno.  WONDERFUL!!

Loved this!!!  I used 60-70 count shrimp Because I like the way they look whole.  I also used the whole lime and omitted the pepper.  This dish just looks and tastes like summer.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe. I used it as a side dish for a cuban pork roast. I did not include the shrimp, was very good. Can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch today

I don't like cilantro so I left that out. Otherwise, I made it mostly as written except that I used the juice of one whole lime, which I think was more than 2 TBS, next time I'd add at least one more, and I cooked the shrimp using a cajun spice mix and served the shrimp warm with salad on top. The spices from the shrimp made the salad quite flavorful and a little went a long way.

This is a beautiful salad.  I added diced cucumber and one lemon which was good except it became a little watery so I poured out the liquid and added some red wine vinegar.  The lemon/lime keeps the avocados from browning and the salad is refreshing, tangy and super easy.  I also left out the cilantro since I can't stand it (tastes like soap to me).

No EVOO in this.  Try a more original idea.  Lots of ideas for something special to put over the top.

This salad is Awesome!  I found a seasoning at Sprouts called "Mango Lime".  It has a hint of heat, not too much. I used the seasoning liberally and withheld the salt and pepper. Letting the salad sit for 10 to 15 minutes is important, so that the flavors can meld. By the way, I use the Mango Lime on everything: beef, chicken, and especially vegetables. This has become my "go-to" seasoning.

I made it as directed and was fortunate to have fresh tomatoes that added fresh flavor.  It was for a Cuba Fest and was very well liked.

Made this using blackened tilapia instead of shimp.  It was such a delicious and filling salad that I'll have to make it again!
