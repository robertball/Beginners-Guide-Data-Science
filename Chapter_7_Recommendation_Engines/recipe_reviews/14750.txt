This was great with a little tweaks, i sauteed the onions and green peppers in butter, i also added fresh garlic and red peppers (sauteed all together) I seasoned the pork chops with my favorite seasons, it was great!! It is even better as left overs, oh and the browning sauce is not needed.

As written, I can only rate this recipe as two stars and this is unfortunate because I feel it has good potential. First, there is no seasoning other than salt and pepper! But that was easily fixed with a sort of all seasoning blend called "Old World 3rd Street Seasoning" from the Spice House in Milwaukee (ingredients of which are unfortunately not included on the jar). I used it on the peppers and onions as well as the chops and also added fresh minced garlic. These two small additions alone I know made all the difference in this dish and definitely should be included.  The flour was unnecessary so I didn't use it; I did use the browning sauce and  wish I would have omitted that too. All it did was obliterate the beautiful colors of the green, orange, red and yellow peppers I used. Finally, the cooking time is far too long, particularly for boneless chops. To simmer these for 40 minutes would make them tough as a board! Boneless chops are so lean that they only need to simmer till cooked through - I think mine took 10 minutes. Still, the final result was very good, and had that final result been the actual recipe, I'd have rated it four stars!

Delicious dish that is quick & easy to make.  Pork chops are very tender and tasty.  I used red and green bell peppers to make the dish more colorful.  The recommendation I have is to cook the bell pepper strips (and maybe the sauteed onions, too) only for the last 15-20 minutes of cooking time, otherwise they would get very mushy.

This is a nice mild dish. Because I can never make smooth gravy, I shook my pork in flour instead of adding it at the end. This was great with garlic mashed potatoes. The flavors really blended nicely. I disagree with other reviewers who said not to cook the peppers the whole time. The point is for the peppers to soften & flavor the sauce. If you want crunchy peppers & onions, make fajitas.

My family loved this recipe and the only thing I did different was to saute the onions and the greenpeppers together along with 3 cloves of garlic. I also omitted the browning sauce  because I didn't have any and it tasted wonderful.

Fantastic! I added a pack of Lipton Onion Soup, and I didn't have the browning sauce. Turned out really tender and delicious. I worried that the peppers would turn to mush, but they were great - not mushy at all! Green peppers and pork really work well together, and I grew my own this year, and am tired of stuffed peppers. This was a great way to use up a few of them!  Oh, you have to serve this with mashies to use the wonderful gravy!

wonderful recipe.  i made this almost exactly as written.  i did use orange pepper instead of green.  and because we are south beach dieters i omitted the browning sauce and flour.  when the 40 min cook time was done i just drained off excess liquid and put it back on the burner to cook off any moisture.  it was wonderful, full of flavor and tender.  we could cut it with a fork.  YUM!!!

This was very good.  For those people who are looking for "spicy" dish.. this is not for them.  I did make some changes as suggested by another reviewer, DavidRayBob.  I sprinkled the pork chops with salt, pepper and Old Bay Seasoning to liven them up after reading other reviews.  I also sauteed the onions in butter with some garlic instead of oil.  I also added some garlic and Old Bay Seasoning to the gravy before serving. I served it with the "Yummy Potatoes" recipe from this site. It was soooo good.

Dyn-o-mite recipe for simple, nutritious, and tasty everyday home cooking.  It is likely to be a family favorite for us, I think.  I used 6 big chops with bones, peppered liberally before browning (after sauteing the veggies plus 3 minced cloves garlic) and chicken broth for the cooking liquid.  I used a cast iron Dutch oven for the browning, then for baking in the oven at 325 degrees for about 1-1/2 hours.

This was a good dish and it was very easy. 40 min is definitely too long to simmer... I had three chops and simmered for about 20 minutes and that was plenty. The green peppers were a little too soft so next time I may wait to add those until a little later. The browning sauce was not needed and I seasoned the pork with garlic salt and johnny's seasoning. Yummy Yummy. Served with a baked potato and a salad :)

Wonderful!  This was a very easy recipe.  The family just loved it and the meat was very tender.  I used different color peppers. I didn't have the browning sauce and it was fine without the gravy.  Thanks from Illinois

If you make this recipe as instructed you have a very tasteless dish, in my opinion. With revisions you can have a 4 star recipe. First season your chops and brown them. The flavor from the green peppers is not enuough to flavor your meat. Add your favorite spices and herbs. I added a beef & chicken bouillon cube and herbs. I ended up with a flavorful dish (chops not as tender as I wanted them to be) but it took some work.

Honest, simple, delicious. I omitted the browning sauce, opting instead to sear the chops well. For a fun twist, substitute green onion for the regular onion.

I don't know if it was because I didn't use Browning sauce (I substituted a little Soy Sauce and Worc. Sauce), but I found these to be very bland.  I also added in sauted garlic as suggested by others.  I did follow the directions and add enough water to cover the chops.  I felt that this was too much and may have been on reason that there was not much flavor.  The smelled delicious while cooking, though.  I ended up sprinkling mine with Cajun seasonings (read that here in a review) just to add some flavor.  That helped.

Put in a search for "pork chops, onion, and green pepper" because that is pretty much what my cupboard had left in it this afternoon and I was in a lazy mood so a trip to the supermarket wasn't on the radar.  I'm glad this recipe came up!  I did follow the recommendations of a few of the other cooks and added the extra seasonings both to season the chops and the gravy, as well as using butter to saute the onions.  I thought it was alright though my husband really liked it so I'll put it in the keeper file.  Thanks!

I like this recipe, but it certainly needs some tweeking or the gravy is too bland.  I found that garlic or even low sodium chicken Herbox helped.

I took the advice of several on here and spiced up the chops before I cooked them. I used a frozen package of red, yellow and green peppers as well as onion. It was all served over egg noodles. I attempted to doctor the sauce with some spices I had on hand, but the whole dish is lacking something, I just can't figure out what. It was still very good and the pork chops were so tender you could cut them with a fork. I sauteed the onions in some garlic and butter at the suggestion of others. All in all, I would try this again if I had everything on hand.

This was very good. I had some clumping when I used the flour dont know if I did that part wrong or what. But all was good in the end.I added red peppers also.

This recipe was very bland at best. You need to add more flavor to the gravy such as pepper, garlic salt etc.

Excellent! I have made this dish 3 times and will make it many more times. The sauce is so delicious that I always serve it with mashed potatoes to take full advantage of the gravy.

A nice change from the usual pork chops with salt pepper and garlic. There wasn't any real punch you in the face flavor but it was smooth and mild. I used a green pepper and a red pepper I had in the fridge so it was probably a tad sweeter. My wife made cajun pan fried potatoes which complimented this dish really well. A good flavor contrast. We will make this again but I will try to figure out the little thing that is missing I can't put my finger on. Thanks Maureen for sharing!

The pork chops were moist and the gravy turned out well.  I would have added a little more spice to it to suit my taste but my husband loved it.

This is pretty good, we enjoyed and I would make it again.  I sauteed the green pepper with the onion and did not use browning sauce.  Next time I will add a little minced garlic with the onion.

There wasn't really enough flavor with this particular recipe.  I don't think the Green Peppers were enough to really give the pork chops that kick we were looking for.  The pork chops were moist however from cooking in that much water.

Well, I thought I knew what I was doing in the kitchen by my age but I must have made an error with this recipe. I had beef broth on hand and used it instead of water. I had never heard of adding flour to water before but tried it and got what I expected - yucky, little dumplings that would not coalesce. The pork chops were overcooked even though I took them out in half the time in the directions. I won't make this again.

A great dish I added cilantro to my sauteed onions and seared the pork chops in it before continuing to cook them in the oven. With the pepper gravy I had to add a little salt it was slightly sweet because of the browning sauce.

Could be a very tastey dish, but it does seem to be missing something...still good though Maureen!
