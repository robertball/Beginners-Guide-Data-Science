i have made variations on this brine for the past few years. This is  actually a variation of Alton Brown's brine ( from the food net work). Just want to remind everyone to rinse this turkey thoroughly  before baking it!!!! Or you will have a super salty turkey!  Also, be careful when making gravy from the turkey drippings- yes you can-- but monitor the salt!  commercial gravy mixes already have salt in them.   The candied ginger and dried fruit are easily substituted  by boiling ginger root and canned fruit or fresh fruit  that you have on hand.  dry spices work fine, too. If  money is no object, than follow recipe as directed, but we are on a budget.  I also made my own veggie broth with a recipe from this website for budget reasons, too.  Lastly- a frozen turkey will thaw out in the fridge  at 24 hours per every 4-5  pounds of turkey, and having it in brine will speed that up some.  So, a 30 pound turkey will take  anywhere from 4-6 days in your fridge ,  you just have to keep checking, so i don't expect  it to thaw out in 3 days.  I usually remove it from the brine after 3 days though, if i got an early start on thawing.  A thawed turkey is still fine in your fridge 2-3 days in your fridge before thanksgiving, but i dont keep brining it for a whole week! This is the most outstanding brine in this universe.  Check out Alton's video for more advice.  You can also use ginger ale in the brine.  The possibilities are endless and you will get rave reviews, I swear!!! ***dont be

This brine is AMAZING !!!I tried it last year and meant to rate it, but never did. It deserves a try. Not only does it make the house smell good, but the turkey was so moist and delicious, and tasty !! It is worth all the ingredients. All you need to do is sit back and let the turkey cook.I did do one thing different, I used an oven bag! It is so easy and you do not have to tend to the turkey. It will be the PERFECT turkey. Hope this helps. Also, one more note: If you are not able to find dried apples which was hard for me to find, I just used natural cinnamon apple chips out of the produce section at my local market. Worked awesome !!! Enjoy :)

I made this recipe after the holidays on a whim. The gravy my mom made from the turkey drippings was like crack to me, it was a PHENOMENAL hit at my house (and we feed enough to be a small army here). Only thing is, at least with a 22lb turkey, best to thaw it before use

Please, for the love of god, put foil on the turkey! This recipe, while great, does not specify the use of foil and the skin burned to a crisp! Use foil to cover the breaat and legs so that they don’t immediately run. I started my turkey at 425 and dropped to 350 after the first hour, using causation to schedule the rest of my oven-necessary sides around the turkey so that the iven wasn’t opening and closing, releasing the heat and thus drying it out. Turned out great except for the burned skin! Luckily I was watching and put foil
