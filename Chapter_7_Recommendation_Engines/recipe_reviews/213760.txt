This soup is absolutely delicious. My husband and I (both Mexican American) found it to be excellent. Not too spicy at all (I can't handle spicy!) We made it more authentic by serving sliced cabbage on top and lime juice (sounds gross, I know...just try it, it's soooo yum!) and tostadas with sour cream. This has become a go to dinner that lasts the two of us 2-3 days. Highly recommended!!!!

Maybe a little too spicy for this chilihead but what great flavors and how easy to make. This is a keeper that you can play with to suit your family flavor profile.

We thought this posole tasted great.  I sprinkled the pork with black and red pepper before browning.  I then sautéed the onion and garlic only and then threw everything (except the red and green peppers) in the slow cooker at the same time and cooked on high for about 4 hours.  Since we like a medium level of spiciness I cut the red pepper to a 1/2 tsp.  Then during the last hour of cooking I added the red and green bell pepper so they would not get mushy and would retain more color.  It was very flavorful and just the right level of spiciness for us.  We will definitely be making this again.  Thanks Lisa for a great recipe!

Very good. I used both chicken and pork, as well as added the much needed cilantro to make it absolutely perfect! You can't have posole without cilantro, it's just not the same.

It was wonderful.  I did it on top of the stove instead of in a slow cooker.  Garnished it with sour cream and cheddar.

Very flavorful.  My hubby and I like spicy foods and this was certainly spicy!  I think next time I might use one can of plain diced tomatoes with the one can of tomatoes w/ chilies.  It was almost too spicy hot.  But, it was  very good.

I make this in an instant pot. I usually use frozen chicken breast instead of the beef and use chicken Better Than Bouillon. So, I literally toss everything in all at once in an instant pot (including frozen chicken breast) cook on high pressure for 15-20 minutes....and then eat! It’s amazing!!!! Love this recipe!

Outstanding as written. Did this on the stove top with about a pound of pork shoulder cubed and it was great.

I made the recipe as it was, except I substituted beef broth for the water and boullion, and added salt to compensate. I also added cilantro and some shredded cheddar cheese at the end. 

It was great! The only thing I didn't like was that it was rather sour. Ironically, sour cream would have offset this well. Meat-eaters would also probably want to add a little more meat, but since I'm trying to cut back heavily on meat consumption, it was great for me.

I used this recipe as a base. No measuring devices were used. Only sight and by taste. I thought this recipe was very basic and very easy to follow. We had shredded some left over BBQ chicken which worked and tasted fabulous. 
We topped off the posole with cilantro, crushed red peppers and sliced avocados. 
Tasty recipe

This was delicious, and even my "picky  eaters" ate every spoonful!

Due to allergies, instead of beef bouillon, I used chicken stock to cover

Next time, I will decrease the cayenne down to 1/2 tsp, but I will definitely make again - because my family is demanding it!

I did use most of the ingredients listed but I changed the measurements

I didn't have a red bell pepper so I only used the green. I also used approximately 2lbs of pork and two  25oz cans of hominy. That's the good thing about soups you can change them a bit with good results.  

I drained the hominy but didn't rinse it like I normally do when adding hominy to a soup. I didn't want all the stretch in the soup. The starch on the unrinsed hominy was good enough.  Add a squeeze of lime juice to your bowl for a whole new level of goodness.

I think this is now one of my favorite soups. I will make this one often this winter.

Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I was actually pleasantly surprised by this one. It was a big hit and fairly healthy too! I couldn't find hominy in my grocery store and that completely shocked me but after checking everywhere I could think of, I finally found one brand in the Mexican food isle and 28 oz can, so I just bough one and that is what I used. I did drain it about half way (it had a lot of liquid and I didn't feel the soup needed that much) and I used a whole pound of pork meat but for the over all recipe that is all I changed. When ready, I served it with shredded cabbage (coleslaw mix), a small dollop of sour cream, cilantro, thinly sliced radishes, avocado and lime wedges. It was tasty and healthy enough to have seconds without too much guilt.

Great as is.  I made it for a church potluck and no one knew what it was.  After they tried it they really liked it.  5 stars on this one.  Very colorful, nice presentation.

Great recipe. I added some ancho chili powder, and garnished w/ cilantro, white onion and jalapenos. The only change I'll make next time is using a fattier cut of meat (ie pork butt) rather than the really lean pork chops I used.

YUM.  Not typically a hominy fan, but I cannot say enough about how delicious this recipe is.  Slow cooker for 6 hours on low and the meat (pork butt) was falling apart.  It has a kick, medium heat, and some sour cream mixed in at serving time softens it; if I were making for a party, I may cut the cayenne to 1/2, just to account for those that don't like heat.  We were all licking our bowls in my household.

I followed this recipe exactly, and it was deeeeelicious! I shared some with my friend who's mom is Mexican and she loved it, too. My only problem with it was that it was a little bit too spicy, and I'm from Louisiana so it takes a lot to burn my mouth! I was able to calm it down with a little sour cream and cheese. Next time I will use less red pepper and get some limes to garnish it with.

Delicious as prepared! Very spicy so recommend serving with sour cream and flour tortillas.

Omitted the tsp. ground red pepper and offered Frank's Hot sauce to taste for the heat-sensitive among us. I think this will be even better with an inexpensive cut of pork.
