I added some extra cheese to this while it was cooking and used broth instead of water. It turned out extra delicious!

I really enjoyed this dish. I made it earlier in the day and reheated it once my hubby got home. The liquid had been absorbed so it did not come out like a chili. More like a beans, rice and chicken dish but great flavor.

Super easy to make, and tasty too! I used a chicken breast that I had left over from a rotisserie chicken. My husband said it's "do again" worthy, which says a lot!
