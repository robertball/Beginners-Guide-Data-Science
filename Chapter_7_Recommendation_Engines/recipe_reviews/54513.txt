My husband and I made these and loved them!  The only problem was the one we caused, we doubled the topping recipe and it caused the caramel to remain gritty.  (It doesn't melt completely.)  Follow the exact recipe and they are wonderful!

I'm thrilled to be the first to rate this recipe! These are the BEST cinnamon rolls I've made on this site! As for being time consuming, they are no more than any other cinnamon roll recipe. I had originally planned to frost them, but they are perfect without. My husband who doesn't usually like sweets, can't get  enough of these. The only change I made was chopping the pecans instead of leaving them whole. You've got a real winner here. Thanks so much for submitting.

I have NEVER had any luck making yeast breads, and this was so wonderful! I always read the reviews, and took advice on three of them - did not add the water to the caramel sauce - used a bit more butter - and removed from the pan immediately upon taking out of the oven.  Very smooth caramel sauce - and no soggy rolls.  They were so delicious!
What an awesome recipe - and now I have some confidence in making yeast breads!
Thank you so much!

Yum! Yum! Yum!  These are great!  The whole family gobbled them up.  I didn't add the nuts as I have one that doesn't like them, but they still were great!  Thanks!

I didn't actually make the cinnamon rolls, but I did use the pecan syrup part of this recipe. I really dont like how long it takes to make any cinnamon roll/sticky bun, but I love them, so instead I bought some pillsbury cinnabon cinnamon rolls, put them in the mixture, let them sit over night and bake them in the morning... Delicious!! and much less work!!

I had to add 3 tbs more water to the dough to get all the flour to incorporate and they topping was a bit to "hard" for my taste. They had good taste but after they were no longer hot we had to throw em in the nuker so the sticky on the top didn't break our teeth out. I could totally be to blame for the topping so I intend on trying these again but all in all a pretty solid recipe.

these were very good. the only reason i rated this as four starts is because the "caramel" was runny when i filled the buns onto a plate after i took them out of the oven. it didn't really stick to the top of the rolls. i think i'll omit the water next time. otherwise, these were very yummy. even the dough tasted so much better than the pre-made rolls at the store and mall. i am definitely going to try this recipe again, thanks so much for sharing!

I thought they were very good! I did make the dough in the bread machine which saves much effort! I also added more sugar to the dough (1/3 cup) to make it more of a sweet dough...thank you!

I only used the caramel and cinnamon/sugar portion of this recipe and used a whole wheat roll recipe (Whole Wheat Bread III) for the dough portion. I usually make just cinnamon rolls and never stick buns/sweet rolls, but I thought these turned out very nicely. The flavor and amount of cinnamon and caramel was right on, and the amount of nuts was just right too. I used chopped walnuts instead of pecans as I didn't have any, and they went well with the rest of the dish.

These were pretty good!  I forgot to add the water to the caramel mixture, but am glad I did.  Next time I may add a splash of vanilla to up the flavor of the caramel mixture a bit.  Since I didn't have margarine I used butter and had to use an extra tbs to spread onto the dough before rolling. Would have preferred a little more cinnamon flavor, so will be a bit more liberal next time (just a preferance, but I love cinnamon). I used more than 1/2 a cup of pecans and still felt it wasn't close to enough, next time I will probably chop up about a cup instead.  All in all, very good "old fashioned" tasting sticky buns; I even got a "these are really good" from my father and THAT is a feat.  Thanks for the recipe Grandma S!

Delicious!     I doubled the recipe and made the dough in my bread machine.  I also double the corn syrup/brown sugar mixture as I made them in 9x13" pans.

Absolutely delicious! This recipe makes some of the best tasting sticky buns I've ever tasted. The dough is easy to make, a bit time consuming, but totally worth it. These are not overly sweet, and they turned out perfect my first try!

These were just okay.  The roll portion had good texture and flavor (wasn't overly sweet).  What I didn't like was the graininess of the carmel topping.  The sugar never made it to a syrup consistency.  I think I would try briefly cooking this down on the stove until the sugar was melted before pouring it into the bottom of the pan.

These were very good and worth getting up a little early for on a holiday morning. I'd recommend not letting it sit too long before inverting the pan and serving them, because the topping will start to solidify if it cools too much. Next time I might use a little more butter and just a bit less brown sugar in the topping, but then again, I like the gooey factor when I have caramel rolls. These would be just as good without the pecans, too, for people who have allergies or just don't like pecans.

I had some difficulties with this recipe.  But I think they were primarily my own fault.  I used a bread machine for the dough, which worked fine, but I did need to add more water and I'm not sure why.  Also, due to an unavoidable issue, I had to pull them out of the oven and the leave them in the pan for about 5 minutes, which was bad.  The topping cooled to the bottom of the pan before I could flip them onto a plate....  I think I will attempt again though.

very yummy! I would recommend turning them out of the pan as soon as they come out of the oven.  I waited just a minute and the sauce had been absorbed already.  But other than that I will be making these again. My family can't get enough of them.

I think this was an absolutely delicious recipe- it tasted very much like I expected.  BUT, I did have a problem with the carmel topping.  As another reviewer said it turned out rather gritty.  I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13.  It was bubbling on the sides when I pulled it out, and the rolls themselves were perfectally cooked.  I suspect that it needs more butter in the carmel sauce for it to come out nice and smooth.  Other then the gritty sauce, it's amazingly delicious and well worth the effort to make.

I used the comments to make a few changes and ended up with a "to die for" caramel roll.  First - I used my dependable bread machine bread recipe for the dough.  Here it is:  add to the machine in this order = 1 cup plus 1 tbs warm water, 1 egg, 4 teaspoons butter, lard, or oil, 3 1/4 cups flour, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, 3 teaspoons yeast.  Set it at the dough setting, or just stop it before the final bake.    For the sugar/cinnamon mix, it was the same except I melted the butter.  For the bottom of the pan caramel mix, I substituted melted butter for the water, added the vanilla (at another commenters suggestion, used maple syrup because I did not have the other,  and mixed it up well first.   

I cooked it at 325 for 20 minutes and at 350 for 5 more minutes.

Then I immediately turned it over into another 8 x 11 greased pan after taking it out.  I wanted to be able to  cover it and keep it moist.

These are like the caramel rolls Mom used to make.  Amazing.  Thank you!!

Amazing!!!  This was my first attempt at making homemade, from scratch yeast bread anything!  They take some time but are easy to make.  I followed another's suggestion and added a tablespoon of sugar to the flour as I was making the dough (I also made these using ONLY whole wheat flour!)  and left out the water in the topping preparation.  I didn't bother measuring the butter I used for the inside of the rolls, and I didn't measure the sugar or the cinnamon I sprinkled on the inside either. That part can be tweaked to your personal liking. These are perfect!!  Perfectly sweet, but not too sweet; perfectly sticky and plenty of topping as well!  I'll be making these over and over again.

You saved our Christmas! My Mom passed away this year, and she always made the most amazing carmel nut rolls, she was one of those cooks that never measured anything and everything always tasted incredible. Well every Christmas she would bake these and the house smelled amazing, none of us kids got to have any until all the neighbors had theirs, it was eager anticipation Christmas day when she would make a batch for us. I am not patient enough to make the dough part of the recipe, so I cheated and purchased the frozen cinnamon roll dough, and used the carmel part of the recipe, Thank you so much, they turned out like my Moms, the family is thrilled!

Absolutely delicious! I used butter rather than margarine and omitted the water in the sauce and instead added more butter. Very yummy! I just wish you didn't have to wait so long!

First thing anyone who makes this should know is: GREASE THE PAN! If you don't, you'll probably run into some difficulty getting the rolls out without wrecking a couple of them. I followed the recipe exactly as written and, other than wishing I had greased the pan first, I was delighted with the results. Nice texture, not too sweet, and relatively easy for this kind of bread. Perfect size; most cinnamon roll recipes make two pans, which is too much for us.

I don't usually review recipes where I dont't make the entire recipe, but I had to review this one even though I only used the caramel topping and center part. I cheated and used a box of hot roll mix and these turned out wonderful.

Just made the recipe, followed it completely, no changes.  These are so good.  My husband said he could eat the entire pan.  The dough was soft and a bit sticky to work with, but worth the effort, for sure!

This was pretty good.  I made the recipe as written.  The topping soaked into the rolls, so next time I would leave out the water.  The recipe makes a pan of 12 small rolls in a 9X9 as written.  You could easily double the size of the rolls and recipe to make bigger rolls.

These take a *really* long time, but are definitely worth it: they're gooey and absolutely delicious. I like these way better than "traditional" cinnamon buns a la Cinnabon.  I made the following changes: spread 1 Tbsp margarine on the dough (not 2), coarsely chopped the pecans, didn't use about 1/2 cup of the caramel topping (it was still plenty!), and managed to squeeze everything into an 8x8 dish. My boyfriend and I were both drooling by the time I pulled these out of the oven - yum!

I probably should have made this in a dark metal pan instead of a clear glass 9x9 for the  coloring.  Also, I inverted it immediately and it didn't set up as well as I would have liked.  I would not add water to the topping next time.

These were delicious!  No problem with leftovers, they were gone in no time.  I cooked the brown sugar topping with another T of butter in it, to prevent graininess that some noted and it seemed to work.  I used a 9x11 pan because I cut them a little smaller.  They only took about 15 minutes to bake.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Good. Made w/o nuts, using microwave for milk, salt, and butter (replaced all marg. in recipe w/ butter). Ingredients list confusing because first sugar should be listed later w/ yeast. Last half cup flour didn’t mix in and was enough for when kneading. I sprayed pan to reduce sticking potential. Could use more flavor: may try dark corn syrup/ brown sugar or molasses instead of part of the corn syrup next time. Was afraid they weren’t raising enough when punched down, but warmed oven a bit and put them in for second raising – doubled well. I inverted rolls immediately after removing from oven – topping was so runny, it ran off to bottom of dish – might wait a minute. Covered leftovers; reheated in toaster oven (loosely covered w/ foil) okay another day – flavor almost better then.

These. Are. Amazing!  My entire family loved them.  I read the reviews and agree, they are no more time consuming than any other cinnamon roll or sticky bun recipe.  I did not add the water per review recommendations.  I will be one that will double the cinnamon because I love cinnamon so much.  I had absolutely no problem with the topping getting hard.  I could have eaten them cold...but warm is so much better.  I recommend rewarming a mere 20-30 seconds in the microwave.  I'm confident an oven warming would be just fine, I'm just not that patient.  I look forward to making them again!  Thank you!!

These are worth the time it takes.  They do not have that "preservative" after-taste that store-bought biscuits do.

I love the dough in this recipe since it doesn't require any special equipment. It definitely takes time to make the dough and let it rise. I made it with bread flour for a softer dough. I used another filling since I didn't have corn syrup and I agree the filling would have been very sticky. The dough is versatile just use your imagination. I would double the dough next time since this recipe makes about 2 cups of dough only after rising.

It is a bit time consuming, but very much worth it. 
I didn't add the water and doubled the cinnamon/sugar on the dough and it was perfect.

Fantastic!  This recipe takes time, but it was so worth it.  To make the time worthwhile, we doubled the recipe.  We made the entire recipe the day before, put the pan in the fridge overnight & set it on the counter in the morning to come to room temperature & allow the rolls to rise.  Then we baked it & brought it to brunch for the family to enjoy.  As long as you have the time to invest in this recipe it's not complicated and really delicious.

These were Delicious! i made a **FEW** modifications. Like using the rapid rise yeast, splenda brown sugar blend things like that. Pretty darn tasty!

Still not the sticky bun recipe that I am looking for but they were good.  You can't go wrong with a butter, pecan & brown sugar mixture.
