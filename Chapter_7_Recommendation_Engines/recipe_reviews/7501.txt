I see a lot of people who are having trouble with the cake turning out of the pan. We eat this alot in NC and we always serve it in a 9 x 13" pan and cut it in the pan to serve it.  I've never seen it made in any other pan. It's too sticky. I hope that helps.

I followed this recipe to a T and it sticks to my bundt pan every time! Bundt pan has non stick surface, plus I spray pam on it and still lousy results! Any suggestions on what I could be doing wrong? Other than cake looking terrible it still tastes great. D.F.

This cake was made for me on my birthday by one of my aunts it was great. So I saw this recipe I decided to make it but it just didn't come out right. Maybe somebody else would have better luck.

My husband & I did not care for this.  We tried the cake before frosting it, and it was very bland so we decided not to waste a tub of frosting on it.  We just threw it out.

Nope, I'm sorry, I just can't give this a good review.  There's nothing "wrong" with it, but it's just uninteresting and lifeless.  When I use recipes from this website, I usually get "wow!" or "great!" but this one gets "unhe  so-so" as it's review.

This cake fell and ended up rock hard on the outside and soft on the inside. A couple of people suggested to me that it might have helped if the cola was flat before adding it to the mixture. Still, my friends ate every last bite of it and I'm going to give it another go. Cheers.
