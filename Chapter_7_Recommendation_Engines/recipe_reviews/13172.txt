I live in Greece, so I know how to make this soup.  It is a delicious soup when made right.  All 3 of my children love it.  You must cook a whole, fresh chicken for the stock.  DO substitute rice as this is the traditional way.  Make sure you remove the soup pot from the flame before you poor the egg/lemon mixture over it.  Otherwise, the egg mixture gets clumpy.  Also, it is great when you add the chicken meat back into the soup.  This is how almost everyone eats it here.

this recipe is all wrong - it's so important to boil a whole chicken for at least an hour or so.  the flavor is so much better.  also, use the juice of 2 lemons for 3 eggs separate the eggs, beat the whites first till stiff, then slowly add the lemon juice, then add the yolks 1 at a time. I prefer rice to orzo and lots of fresh ground pepper.

So yummy, and really versatile! I must admit we tweaked this a bit; the orzo can be substituted for rice or any other type of pasta. And we added a lot of garlic to the bunch. Nonetheless the end result turned out pretty tasty, a nice alternative to chicken or matzo soup when someone in the family gets sick.

Thank you for providing this wonderful recipe on-line.  This brings back treasured memories of my Greek grandmother who always said "katse, katse" for "sit, sit" while she served some of the most wonderful food to her adoring grandchildren.  I have all of her recipes for Baklava, Dolmades, and Tsatsiki, but this one I did not have.  This was always one of my favorites, and now I will have a chance to share it with my family.  I remember her using rice instead of pasta, so I am going to give that a try too...This is a terrific soup.

Good. Even better with a few tablespoons of white rice that are allowed to cook for a while before adding eggs and lemon. I suspect that those people who tried this and did not like it at all were using a low quality canned chicken  broth. Use either a chicken broth in a "parmalat" pack or make your own.

I did add chicken to this (I know, I know - not traditional) and diced carrot as this is the way I've always eaten it.  I added a little more orzo to make it heartier.  A friend tasted it and said that his Greek Grandmother's was just a HAIR better.  I took that as quite the compliment.

this is exactly what i was hoping for.  we had been wanting to try avgolemono at home after we had it at our favorite greek restaurant.  only changes i made to this were i used a full 2 quarts of chicken stock, upped the orzo to a full cup, upped it to 4 eggs, upped to 2 lemons (plus the zest of one lemon, i really wanted the lemon flavor to shine through) and didn't use the cold water.  I also added a mirepoix.  Sprinkled kosher salt to taste at the end.  Very delicious and satisfying on a cold rainy day.  Thank you for sharing.

This soup is absolutely delicious. I varied the recipe somewhat by frying an onion and a clove of garlic in a little olive oil in the pan before adding the stock. I also added halved kumquats to the stock when preparing (removed before adding the egg-lemon mixture) to add an even more zesty flavour. To top it off, I added a handful of garden peas when the pasta was tender and a generous sprinkling of fresh parsley to finish. Delicious and highly recommended!!

I thought this tasted fairly good, considering I chose to make it because I needed to go food shopping. I ended up adding about an extra Tblsp. or so of orzo, because it was the end of the box. I did cook the orzo for 10 minutes, and it was perfectly cooked. In my bowl, I put parsley, a tsp. of butter with canola, and juice from the lemon wedge. The thing I didn't care for, was I thought it was a tad thinner then what I would like. Also, the only ingredients in the soup was the orzo, which wasn't even very much. I think I would have liked a little chicken, celery, or something else. I am not sure what the Greek restaurant by my house adds, but it definitely has a lot less broth.

I just made this recipe faithfully following the instructions but adding two lemons instead of one. It was absolulely delicious. I lived in Greece for years this one is authentic.

I'm Greek and I loved it! My husband thought it was his mom's recipe or from one of my many Greek cookbooks. This is the easiest recipe for Greek soup I know. I haven't tried the other two recipes on the site for Avgolemono and won't be because I thought this recipe was very good. update 1/09 I now use four eggs and a bit of cornstarch or flour so that the consistency is better. This way it is lemon soup instead of tasting like lemon water. I also add carrots and sometimes chicken.

YUM!  A great alternative to 'normal' chicken soup.  I added 2 diced chicken breasts, sauteed garlic/onion/carrot, and used basmati rice because we were out of orzo.  Would be even better with a splash of white wine mixed in with the broth.

This was wonderful Michelle! I love soup, I love lemon and I love orzo so this was a great combo for me. I eat fresh spinach every day, so I threw some of that in too. Don't know why anyone would call this soup "bad"; it was far from it. If it contained some exotic ingredients I could understand, but this is basic and absolutely delicious. Thanks so much!

Maybe I added too much lemon.  I used bottled lemon juice instead of a fresh lemon.  But it was pretty bland and boring.  The egg mixture was unappetizing.  Next time (if there is a next time) I wouldn't beat the eggs completely.  Chunks of eggs would be better.

Delicious!   I made my own chicken broth from scratch and added some chickent to the broth.  I also bumped up the orzo to 1 cup as 1/2 cup was not enough.

This is a great soup. The first time I made it, I used 2 lemons to the 3 eggs. However, it was very lemony and I love lemon. I'll try it again, but add in more lemon at the end if it needs more.

This was really good and very simple to make.  We made it with vegetable broth to make it vegetarian.  It would probably be pretty bland without topping with some feta cheese.

Either I don't appreciate a good avgolemono soup or it's just... bad. We poured the rest of it down the drain, my 1 yr old son took 1 bite and then shook his head about another, and neither my husband nor I just could not stomach eating a whole bowl.

Fantastic light flavor, easy preparation.  I will add more orzo next time, but only about 1/2 cup more.  Superb! I will make it again.

My husband and I agree that this soup tastes good and was extremely easy to make.  Unfortunately, we had a hard time getting past wondering how well the eggs were really cooked.  Funny because if I had eaten this out, I would have loved it and never been the wiser!

My YaYa taught me how to make this when I was growing up. I was trying to find a recipe with proportions and this was spot on! The changes I would suggest are: use 1 cup orzo (or rice - I used rice growing up and prefer it); we also used to separate the eggs and whip up the whites until they peak. Then gently fold in the (stirred) yolks and the lemon juice. When that mixture is done (photo attached), add a few cups of the cooked broth and gently fold in. Then you can pour the whole mixture together. Do not heat/cook afterwards or the eggs will clump. Very tasty!!

I followed the recipe exactly, and when I tasted the finished product, I decided that a bit more broth and 1 cup of orzo would take it to five stars, at least for my taste. I was really happy to find this recipe; thank you for sharing!

This was delicious! Exactly what I was looking for on a gloomy fall evening. It reminded me of the time I spent in Greece! I did wish there was a little bit of shredded chicken in it, but all-in-all, awesome.

what an easy soup to make- a nice alternative to boring chicken noodle. I made this recipe just how it was listed and even my young children loved this tangy soup.

It was okay. I think I'd rather just have plain chicken broth with pasta.

We have made this recipe twice now and really like it.  I tend to throw in an extra egg (since I end up doubling the orzo and putting in extra chicken stock).  I do agree with the previous reviewer - I use an organic chicken stock, and I don't know if this would taste as good out of the can.  Quick, light, easy, and refreshing.

Simple and delicious.  It would be perfect for a sick day.  Broth is thinner than restaurant version I am used to.

This is one of the closest recipes I can find to my own yiayia's (grandmother's) version of this soup.  Usually, however, she'll use whatever broth or pasta she has on hand, not just chicken broth or orzo.  I am not fond of using rice in an avgolemono recipe, which is probably my greatest attraction to Michelle's.

My family didn't really like this at all.  It is quick and easy to make but we couldn't finish a bowl and at leftovers instead.  I made the recipe exactly as directed with no substitutions. I've never had this type of soup before so I didn't know what to expect, maybe its just our own taste preferrence but I will not be making it again.

this was a great soup! easy, simple and a great way to use fresh lemons. Though my boyfriend and I have never had this soup before, we loved every bit!
I didn't have orzo on hand so i broke up spaghetti as small as I could and  we made it vegetarian by using vegetable broth instead of chicken stock. Would definitely make again.

This soup is incredibly easy to throw together and I make it frequently.  I increase the orzo by half (3/4 cup instead of 1/2) and usually I double the recipe so there's plenty of leftovers.

This soup was very, very good.  I have made it before with a different recipe, and this one tasted better and was much easier.  Its not quite as good as the soup from the Greek Restraunt, but it was very close.

I love this soup, being Greek, I have eaten it since I was a child. I would only like to add that in Greece we usually use rice instead of pasta. My family likes to sprinkle a bit cinnamon on top, which except from giving it a nice taste diminishes the smell of eggs and chicken as well.

Excellent! My mother really loved it since not many foods agree with her these days. Very easy. Next time I will add more orzo and will try it with chicken. Thank you, this will become one of our regular meals.

This soup recipe sounded kind of strange, but I tried it, and it was sooo good!  My father, my father's girlfriend and my boyfriend all loved it.  I wrote my grandmother an e-mail telling her that I'd made a good Greek dinner with Greek soup, salad and pasta.  She wrote me back telling me about how she had this really great Greek soup once around 30 years ago and she still remembers it and wishes she could find the recipe.  Then she described Avgolemono.  I told her that I had made just the thing she remembered and I gave her the recipe.  This is a recipe really worth trying.  It's delicious and it's easy and cheap to make.

I really liked the recipe directions. Explaining all the steps to make the egg turn out was very helpful.  I did 1 quart chicken broth, 3/4 quart water to lower the sodium and it was still delicious, albeit a bit lighter. Really enjoy this kind of soup. Thanks!

There is nothing wrong with the recipe as is. This is the soup you get when you order it at Greek restaurants. The only place you might get into trouble is in the quality of your ingredients. Buy better chicken stock, get better soup. I mean, heck, I just messed around for the most part-- my eggs didn't even get frothy-- and this still turned out delicious and exactly as I remember from my childhood. Huzzah!

I always make this recipe when I, or a loved one gets sick.  We greeks call it greek penicillin which it truly is.  This is one thing I did not get my grandmother to show me how to make before she passed on.  Like any good greek yiayia her recipes were kept in her head, there was no measurments of any kind, you could just feel when it was right.  This is the closest recipe online I have found to match up with hers, its perfect in its simplicity becuse thats what most greek food is all about; keeping it simple and tasty.  The only change is I use white rice instead of Orzo because thats what she always used.  I have a cold today so I am going to go make some right now!

Very tasty.....Keep in mind that you must use fresh lemon juice, squeezed from a lemon (not bottled) and high quality chicken stock as that is where the flavor originates.

This was a simple, tasty soup.  The only change was I added baby penne (pennette)instead of orzo, because I didn't have any orzo handy.  My dad thought it was cream-based because it was so silky.  He was surprised when I told him it was actually eggs that made it "creamy".  I used Swanson's Certified Organic Chicken Broth and it was delicious.  Be careful with other organinc broths, though.  They are not all made equal.  Some can be very bland and even "chemical-ly".

The traditional recipe is made with white rice and the broth from slowly boiling a whole chicken for about 45 minutes, making sure the fat is rendered off the top.

This is a wonderful tasting soup. Being half Greek myself, my mom was full greek, her mom and dad were from Greece. So I was brought up on this soup and love it tremendously.

We have made this over, and over...
It's a really lovely soup with bread, 
or buns if you want something light.
My kids love it and keep asking for it!

Not too shabby.  I like to add a couple of extra egg yolks for color, thickness, flavor, etc.

Excellent!
A close match to the comfort food my Greek neighbor made for me when I was a child.

Made it just like the recipe and it came out great.  Might add chicken next time but my family loved it.

Four stars for ease, but the flavor is a little bland. I doubled the lemon juice and added a bit of cornstarch for texture, and that was much better. I also prefer to add in some shredded chicken, a little coarsely chopped spinach, and perhaps some onion/green onion. I may try a few more vegetables (eg, grated carrot, diced celery) but simple is good too. Don’t stint on the salt.

I've used both orzo and rice with this recipe and they are both very very good.  The family tends to lean towards the orzo more so than the rice though.

I have added some store-bought rotisserie chicken  at times to make it a bit heartier of a soup.  Delish!

A very refreshing and tasty soup.

Doubled the recipe and made as written.  It had a lovely light smooth texture but the flavor wasn't as impactful as others I've tasted.

Added chicken to soup, 1 breast worth. Depending on how lemony you like it 3-4 Tbsp was perfect (went with 4). Used 32oz broth. Same # of eggs, slightly less orzo. Salt, pepper, a little granulated garlic and cayenne...it was beautiful. This is a great and easy base recipe. I recommend it.

Have eaten this soup several times out and was tempted to try making it!  First attempt was okay - followed recipe to make 2 servings - hubby, daughter and I ate it all.  Felt the lemon flavor wasn't strong enough and we prefer LOTS more pasta.  I also threw in mushrooms, which went well.   Next time I would double (or triple) the pasta and lemon.  Still a very good first try!

Made this recipe exactly and it was mighty tastey! My second bowl I did add some chicken breast meat and it gave it a bit more texture.

Very tasty! I added some chickent to the broth. I also bumped up the orzo to 1 cup as 1/2 cup was not enough. I also sprinkled a little parsley on top.

I love Avgolemono soup, and order it every chance I get in restaurants. This was a really good soup...but it wasn't quite right. I don't know what was missing, but it didn't satisfy my craving.

Not bad--I would have like to have more pasta in the soup than the recipe called for, but that's an easy fix.

delicious! Oh my goodness, sooo good. I used arborio rice (the kind you use to make risotto). The only thing is, not so good the next day so eat it all up the day you make it (which shouldn't be hard).
