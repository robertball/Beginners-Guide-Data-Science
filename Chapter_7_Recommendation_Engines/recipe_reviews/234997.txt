Fresh green beans, real bacon, and a squirt of lemon juice to taste. Added some zucchini and chopped onion because I had it to use. Saut√©ed chopped bacon in a skillet before adding the vegetables, cooking just till fork tender while still maintaining their vibrant green color.  Fresh, beautiful and spring-like.

I was looking for something to do with French Style green beans and stumbled upon this recipe and decided, if it had 4 1/2 stars, it had to be good.  What I didn't realize was that only 2 other people had reviewed it.  Didn't like this at all and none of my 7 or husband did either.  The main taste is lemon.  :P  Will NOT make again.

This really puts a great spin on the flavor. We will definitely be using this recipe again in the future. I used fresh bacon lightly cooked in the skillet and added a little cayenne pepper.
