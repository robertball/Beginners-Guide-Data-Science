A really quick and easy taco recipe. I'm still trying to wrap my head around biting into a taco and getting the smoked sausage flavor but I could get used to this. For those on the go this is another good one.

Was very good idea. I added tomatillos to the recipe. Served with salsa and sour cream, shredded lettuce and grated cheddar cheese. My wife liked as well. Worth a taste to anyone who likes smoked sausage, or just a change of the usual.

This recipe is interesting--it was fun to try for something different, but it's not something I would make again. I just think there's better taco fillings and better uses for smoked sausage.

This was an easy, fast meal, but there was nothing really wow about it.
