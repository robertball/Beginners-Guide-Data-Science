I loved this recipe. I'm a fan of sweet potatoes and coffee cake, and I thought it was a great way to sneak in some vegetables. It's very yummy and moist.

Solid 4 stars on this one.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the topping.  The batter was very thick so I was a little worried it would be dry and crumbly.  I patted the *dough* out in the pan and crossed my fingers.  I then made the topping which I added walnuts to. The topping was a little wet and formed clumps rather than small crumbs.  I broke it us and spread it out evenly on top.  I thought it might sink but the cake batter was too dense for that.  I was pleasantly surprised that the cake baked up nice and doubled in size. The cake texture is not dry nor is it crumbly.  It is a soft cake and very moist.  We really liked the addition of the nuts in the topping and I also added a sugar drizzle.  The cake is not overly sweet which I liked but the sugar glaze was needed.  Nice flavor - you can taste sweet potato and I will be making this again.

I had a leftover baked sweet potato and decided to make this coffee cake. My daughter, who loves sweet potato breads, said it was awesome! I followed the recipe exactly. It's just the right amount of sweetness for a breakfast dish.

Very good for left over sweet potatoes.  I added chopped pecans on top before it was almost done for an added texture.  Definitely will make this again.
