Update:  I figure out this tastes the same no matter which bourbon whiskey I use.  I now pick up one of the cheapest bottles they have and it's great.  Original: This deserves more than 5 stars!  I made this for Memorial Day BBQ and it was wonderful!  Used Maker's Mark and didn't change the recipe other than adding a bit more hot sauce.  Cooked it outside on the grill on Saturday for Monday's BBQ.  I strained the onions out and I wish I would have followed some other suggestions of cutting the onions into wedges to make it easier, but it all worked out in the end.  Letting the chicken soak in the BBQ sauce for 24 hours from yesterday until today made it even better!

This recipe is off the chains!!!!  I used it four times already since November.  The last time I've made it, I used a crockpot and made a gallon of it.  My family and I went bowling while this was in the crockpot.  When we left I set it on low.  Five hours later, we returned and the whole house smelled like sauce.  It was great!  I sat it in the fridge for 48 hours.  Wow, what a sauce.  I do not buy that junk in the stores anymore.  THANKS HOMIE.

Hey Kevin
Why haven't you bottled this stuff? Its the best we've ever tried. We love BBQ sauce on pulled pork, baby backs, and country ribs. Outstanding. Thanks for sharing. I pre-baked the babybacks for 2 hours on 250, then slathered your sauce on them, put them under a low broiler. Then every 15 minutes, brushed them with the sauce again. At the end of 45 minutes the sauce had mostly carmelized and the meat was falling off the bones. Delicious! Thanks for sharing, Kevin.

This BBQ sauce recipe is freakin' insane. So good. I made it this morning and let it cook a bit, planning on using it for BBQ chicken tonight. I stuck my finger in to taste it and oooohweeee, this is delicious. I made no changes or subs, followed the recipe exact. This one's a keeper. I can only imagine how this'll crank up the flavor on my chicken!

The best BBQ sauce I have ever had! Made sauce the night before making the Amazing Ribs from this website.  A true winner!  Used Crown Royal whiskey (how can you go wrong with that??) Don't worry about the minced onion and garlic being too chunky.  When I cooked the Amazing Ribs in the crockpot, the chunks were not noticable.
Try this...You'll like it!

Awesome BBQ sauce - I scaled this down just to try it and I'm so glad I did.  I added a little more bourbon to it and next time I'll do it in a crock pot and leave the onions in large pieces to avoid the tedious process of straining them out....

WOW!!!  I lived in Kansas City for over 40 years and we know BBQ and this sauce is the best I think I have ever tasted.  It is easy to make, and it IS better to make a few days before you use it as the flavors meld and intensify.  I am going to use this for my favorite briskett recipe!

KILLER SAUCE!!!  One of the things on my "to do" list before I die is to master bbq ribs.  With this recipe, I have finally done that!  Wow!  I used pork country style ribs.  First I placed them in a shallow roasting pan, seasoned them with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder and then put them in a 400 degree oven for 30 minutes--turning them once half way through.  Then I poured the whole batch of sauce over them and refridgerated them overnight.  Today I put them in the slow cooker on low for about 7 hours.  The meat was falling off the bone.  I put them back in the shallow roasting pan and broiled them on 425 degrees for about 15 minutes to carmelize them.  My husband told me they were the best ribs he has ever eaten and I agree with him!  Thank you for submitting this wonderful recipe! :)

I've lost count of the amount of times I've made this sauce. I've used high-end bourbon and cheap bourbon, and it seems like something mid-grade like Jim Beam works best. I always make huge batches of it to jar up and give out as gifts around the holidays. I live in Texas so BBQ sauce is appreciated any time of the year. You can do 6X the recipe (96 servings) in an 8-quart pot and it'll take about an hour to cook and reduce/thicken a bit. Yields 9 pint size jars of sauce - hot water bath for 25 minutes.

Excellent. Best if left for over 24 hours before using. Maybe a little less liquid smoke and a little more hot sauce next time I make it.

Made this last night - it is definately much better after it has sat overnight.  At first, it was too tangy, but after it sat for a while, the flavors began to blend and now it is pretty delicious.  I used it to make bbq chicken - yum!!

Everyone who tried this sauce loved it. It deserves five stars.  I didn't have any hot sauce so I substituted cayenne pepper.  It tasted too spicy hot when it finished cooking.  But,a fter letting it sit for two days in the refrigerator then cooking the ribs in the sauce in a slow cooker, the excessive spiciness was gone Perfect!
     From my experience in food service and marketing, I realize that if there were a such thing as the best recipe in the world, there still be 2% or 3% of tasters who would not like it. In this instance, they would probably be the individuals who prefer the taste of the bottled BBQ sauce, with the MSG and high fructose corn syrup.  I admit that I have tasted the factory-made sauce and some taste very good; MSG will make them taste good. But I enjoy cooking at home and using healthy ingredients (I'm sure Kraft does not use the more costly organic ingredients that I use).
     My best advice is to ignore the very few poor ratings of this recipe and try it. If you do not like it, alter the recipe to taste. The three ingredients to alter would be: the liquid smoke (for smokiness flavor) the hot sauce (for spiciness or heat) and the brown sugar (for the sweetness or molasses taste). The amount of brown sugar may be changed to taste or another sweetener altogether may be used. 
     Such a large number of people reviewed this recipe and gave it five stars and rave reviews that it is well worth trying.

This sauce is a great sauce, I used Jim Beam white label Bourbon because I did not want to waste my Makers Mark or Blantons. Also I read the reviews as others have, and many used Jack Daniels which is not a bourbon but a Tennesse sippin whiskey so that may give you a little different taste, Also some commented that they would not give it to youth because of the alcohol. I would like to point out that alcohol evaperates at around 160-170 degrees so unless you did not cook this sauce there will be 0% alcohol in it. But other than my pet peeves reguarding Bourbon this is a great sauce, Try adding just a tablespoon of some blackstrap molases for added depth and a little darker color.

Perfect the way it is.  I put in food processor to smooth it out because I don't like pieces of onion. I canned this so I would have it on hand. (hot water bath for 25 minutes).

Just don't understand what the other reviewers see in this. The whiskey was overly aggressive as a flavor, and the sauce just didn't know what it wanted to be: sweet, hot, smoky...so it just turned out as a mish-mash of flavors. I'm not a sauce snob, but both my husband and I just said not to this recipe.

I didn't pre-cook this sauce - I put all the ingredients into my slow cooker with some fresh cooked beans and sauteed onion, garlic, and sausage.  Let cook on high for a couple hours - until bubbling - then low for the rest of the day.  To address those that prefer to decrease the cider vinegar - I'd leave it as is for strong flavored meats - beef, ribs, etc... - but would cut it in half for chicken and baked beans.....Thanks for the fantastic recipe - perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I prepared this sauce, scaled to a half-gallon, for a party last weekend.  I used it with the Slow Cooker Barbeque recipe submitted by Brandy on this site.  As in my review for that recipe, this was the most requested recipe of all time for me.  I was repeatedly asked "what kind of sauce did you use?".  30 copies of the recipe disappeared quickly.  I used Jim Bean and oh, the smell in the house while cooking should be made into a Yankee Candle!  Tweak to your preference, but wonderful as is.  Thanks Kevin ... great recipe.

This has to be one of the best BBQ sauces ev-ah!  I forgot to add the tomato paste, added 1/4 of a sweet red pepper because I had it and reduced the liquid smoke to 1 tablespoon as I'm not a bit fan of it.  We found this to be a bit too vinegary for our tastes, so I eyeballed the addition of  1/4 to 1/2 cup molasses and the result was as good, if not better, than our favorite commercial sauce.  This is "my" BBQ sauce.  Kevin, this totally rocks our world.  Thank you!!

Made this the other day and it is excellent.
If you are from New Orleans, I have to tell you, this is just like the Sauce from Bud's Broiler.
To anyone not from New Orleans, Put this over a nice hamburger and top with some finely chopped onions and grated cheddar cheese.  Yummmmmm......

Made exactly as directed & it came out great.  Put on split chicken breasts and baked at 400 for an hour.  The sauce was delish, I thought I would need to reapply every 15 min but this wasn't necessary the sauce stayed on the chicken and came out looking & tasting like I made on a bbq grill.

This is some kind of AWESOME... I tried it with MakersMark, WildTurkey101, and JimBeam. So far I have been able to tell the difference in every single brand. I usually make it in the middle of the week, so the spices have a chance to blend together and cool off by the weekend. Definately have to run it for a couple minutes in the blender before it goes in the refridgerator.

WOW.  I have made numerous BBQ sauces and this one ranks as one of my top favs.  Only thing I do different is to let simmer for 2 hours and not 20 minutes.

This is the Best BBQ sauce I've had. My husband & kids love it. I followed the recipe exactly. I chose not to strain it as I liked the little bits in there. It was perfect. This is all we will use now. Plan on making a large batch this summer and canning or freezing. For the vinegar try using Braggs apple cider vinegar. You won't believe the difference.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I'm a displaced frustrated Texan stuck in a place that is not TX.  I resorted to making my own chicken fried steak.  Fail.  My own BBQ.  Success.  This is WICKED good.  And by wicked ,I mean cooking this stuff is a HELLACIOUS experience.  It singes my eyelashes, burns my sinuses, splatters me w/ hot molten bbq lava, destroys my kitchen, and yet like any other hopeless junkie, I keep coming back for more.  Because it is sublime.  My husband does not even mind that I steal some of his bourbon.  Thank you.

RE: KLDREYER 06/04/11 - I use Heinz also, because it comes in a 24oz bottle which is equiv. to the 2C required, and it's perfect.

Oh... My God. This was soooooooo good. Best BBQ sauce I've EVER tasted.

I had to change a couple of things, mostly based on what I didn't have around the house.

I didn't have liquid smoke so I used a chipotle seasoning mix instead. It adds such a great depth of flavor. You get the smoky but also spice. I also added paprika to bring some more smokey flavor.

I don't like my BBQed beef too sweet so I cut down on the amount of brown sugar. Most ketchups are sweet enough to make up for it anyways.

I think the best thing I did was stir in some spicy deli mustard. It gives it a kick that makes the sauce EVEN better.

Hands down the best BBQ sauce I have ever tasted! I was a little leery when I started making it (the smell of Bourbon and onions cooking made me want to upchuck). But, after it was all done and sat in the fridge a day or two, it was AMAZING! Smoky, complex, and a slight kick without that ketchup taste. I used it for the ribs in the "Texas Pork Ribs" recipe and it turned out fantastic! Make it, eat it, love it!!

This sauce gets better the longer it sits in the fridge. I uped the servings to about 96 which makes about a gallon or so. I stored it in containers and use it for all sorts of BBQ. It just keeps getting better!

Fantastic stuff!!  I always double this recipe so I have extra.  Just thru it all in the slow cooker for 3-4 hrs and it turned out perfect.  So easy!!    Except, that I dropped the bottle of liquid smoke on the floor and it went everywhere.  Whole place smells like a bbq smokehouse...  Ooops.

Let me start by saying that I do NOT like BBQ sauce, except for Jack Daniels Original. I have had other home made BBQ sauces and they were tolerable. I changed nothing about this recipe, and tried it as is. I ended up making twelve quart masson jars of this for ourselves, and even had friends ask for their own jars! It has the right combination of sweet and tangy. Not to mention it is without that 'manufactured' taste. I'm not even buying my ol' J.D Original that I have been faithful to for so long! It's perfect the way it is. I wouldn't change one thing! Thank you soooo much for this posting! We LOVE it!

My brother has just started an apprenticeship at a restaurant and came home talking crazy about how good the BBQ sauce was that the restaurant makes. Well if that isn't a challenge i don't know what is. I had saved this recipe ages ago and finally had the chance to make it. Needless to say, he wants to give the recipe to his boss ,because he feels that mine is so much better, its embarrassing to serve that old recipe at work! I LOVE proving people wrong!! Thankyou so much for the recipe, made it as directed and obviously, it was perfect. (No lumps - made sure i whizzed up the onions etc in the mixmaster b4 i started!)

This is one awesome bbq sauce! It matches any famous sauce you may have tried. I wanted a smooth sauce and found it impossible to strain out the garlic and onion pieces, so after they simmered  I poured the bourbon,garlic and onion into my blender and presto! no more lumps!! I use it on pulled pork and its to die for. Always make two batches. My family loves to use leftover sauce to dip chicken and fries!

Made this for the 4th two days ahead of when I was going to use. It was very good, I will use this again, but will use a cheaper bourbon, I used Crown Royal that was all I had, just that it took almost all my pint. I had alot left over, just wonder how long you can keep it or can you freeze it. Did not make any adjustments made as read.  Use it on a slab of ribs, will try it on chicken next.

Great sauce. I used Crown Royal Black instead of Bourbon and only used 1 TBS of liquid smoke. Turned out fantastic. While I do like a smooth sauce I really didn't want to discard the onions and garlic. I threw it all in a blender for a few minutes instead. This will be used a LOT this coming summer!!!!

Thnk you Kevin.  This was Soooooo good.  I have used it on everything from BBQing meat, to a spread on sandwiches.  I have even fried my eggs in it.  It's wonderful. As others have said, it is better if you let it sit for at least 24 hours before using. (Helpful hint; save yourself some time and double this recipe right from the start.....trust me, you'll be glad you did.)

I tried this sauce because it received so many good reviews.  Although I was hesitant to use so much Liquid Smoke, I decided to follow the recipe to the letter to see what the results would be.  This sauce is FABULOUS!!. My husband thought it was a bit too sweet, so I may try a revision using less brown sugar, however I'll continue to use the original recipe as well. I used Jack Daniels whiskey, but will experiment using other labels.  This sauce has the perfect combination of ingredients that results in a sweet smoky flavor with just enough heat and zest. I don't care much for sauce that is so hot that it makes me cough, but this one is perfect. We used it on chicken and baby back ribs, and it was scrumptious! I plan to make a large amount and process in canning jars. Thanks, Kevin, for sharing this wonderful recipe!  As my mother-in-law would have said...."DeeeeWishus"

Oh, yeah! Make sure to make this at least a day ahead to let flavors mingle.
Had better luck with Hunt's ketchup than Heinz, it tastes less processed. Also threw in a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice to jazz things up a bit.
One of our local BBQ 'legends' adds butter to his sauce: try stirring in a few tablespoons to this recipe as it is cooling, makes it even better.
Printing off copies ahead of time for graduation party tomorrow: people LOVE this stuff.

Very tasty although the smokiness dominated the bourbon. Next time I'll decrease the liquid smoke to 1 tbs & increase the bourbon to 1 c.

Excellent BBQ sauce and so easy to make. I reduced brown sugar to 1/4 cup and tripled the hot sauce. Used on country-style pork ribs on grill. Great aroma, great taste.

This was a fantastic recipe. Even my hubby, "the bbq king" said it was really good. I had to use Meyer's Rum because I didn't have any whiskey on hand. Next time I make this I will use whiskey.

loved this, did make a little change, did not use hot pepper sauce but i put a few hot peppers in with the onion and garlic and whiskey then pureed the onions, garlic, hot pepper and whiskey.  I did not run the sauce thru a strainer. I used about 4 ghost chiles (the HOT ones) so it gave it a sweet taste then the hot kicked in.  it's the best. Thank-You Kevin for sharing.

I really like this. The smoke was overpowering at first but I'm glad I didn't start doctoring it. It simmered down to a nice sauce that if anything was a little sweet for me even without the sugar. I made a half batch and it made enough for three bbq pork sandwiches and a half pint jar.

It was ok.. Not worth the effort and the bourbon though.  My family didn't like it much.

All I can say is.....WOW!  This is some seriously good stuff.  I'm going to make a much larger batch next time.  And don't strain it - there's no need to.  Excellent recipe!!!

This was my first attempt at using anything but bottled bbq sauce and it was great! Perfect blend of flavors and excellent on the chicken we grilled.

This is the BEST barbeque sauce.  My husband has made it twice now and leaves the garlic and onion pieces in instead of straining them out.  We prefer it that way for a more homemade texture.  On Superbowl Sunday, we shredded leftover beef rump roast and cooked it in the slow cooker all afternoon covered in the sauce.  Wow!!...it was to die for.  Tonight we're trying it on pork ribs - can't wait.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe, Kevin!

I'll admit I'm not the biggest fan of barbeque sauce. It is usually too sweet and not hot enough for me. However, I was making pulled pork for a party and I needed a barbeque sauce to serve with it. This sauce went perfectly with it. It was spicy and tart without the sweetness being overpowering. I didn't have liquid smoke so I added some cumin to it to try to recreate a little of that smoky flavor. I will definitely use on a regular basis from now on.

The only reason I would buy a bottled bbq sauce after tasting this would be if I lost all sense of taste.  It is lick your fingers good.  I did not make any changes to the recipe.  I strained out the garlic and onion and let it sit in my frig for about 2 days.  My boys 7 and 4 1/2 kept sticking their fingers in the bowl to taste it.  I grilled 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts and generously covered them with the sauce and had enough for atleast 4-6 more.  I know bbq sauce in a bottle is more convenient but this sauce is worth planning ahead for.  The only change I may make will be to decrease the liquid smoke a little.  This is my sauce from now on!

Wow.  This was very flavorful.  It turns out I didn't have tomato paste so I diced up a tomato and roughly mashed it up with some corn starch.  My hot sauce of choice was Sriracha sauce (a medium spicy sauce with a lot of garlic in it so feel free to tweak the recipe).

I gave this one 5 stars only because that was the limit. It needs 10 ! I live in North Carolina, the capital for barbecue and let me tell you this is the BEST barbecue sauce I have ever tasted. I made it exactly by the recipe, no changes at all. I will NEVER buy another bottle of barbecue sauce again and I wouldn't use it if someone gave it to me. THIS will be what I use for the rest of my life !! It is sooooooo good !!!!

This recipes ROCKS! I made it EXACTLY as it was written, and it is PERFECT the way it is. I did puree the onions and garlic with a food processor, which gives the sauce a great texture. I made it two days before I used it and, honestly, I was looking for some crusty bread to dunk in it. I couldn't keep out of it. Thankfully, I made a double batch from the get go. As others have suggested, this would make a great homemade gift. THANKS A BATCH FOR SHARING!

I made this to put on  chicken. I baked the chicken in some of it in the oven and then topped it with the remaining before serving. I did not use tomato paste (didn't have it) and used white vinegar instead of cidar vinager(again didn't have it). I used Jack Daniels for the bourbon. I really enjoyed this and so did my husband- it was really, really good! I am going to try it on ribs next! As soon as we tasted it we said how good it would be on ribs so I am excited to try that, Very easy to make and tastes great! Thanks!

Having grown up in the south on BBQ, I know good sauce.  And this my friend is a keeper of a recipe!  I made it tonight to jar, "put up" (as we say in the south), as a homemade Christmas present for my outdoorsy hunter/fisherman brother.  I can't wait to hear his reaction upon using it.  I used Jim Beam Whiskey and Jim Beam Hot Sauce.  I also used 1/2 tsp. black pepper and 1/2 tsp. cayenne to give it a little "kick".  Loved the final outcome.  Sweet from the brown sugar, yet fiesty from the hot pepper sauce and cayenne, as well as a wonderful flavor and aroma from the garlic.  Thanks for sharing this one, Kevin.

Good basic sauce but definitely needs some seasonings. I used half ketchup and half tomato sauce for the 2 cups, I omitted the salt and halved the brown sugar. I added a bay leaf, onion powder, garlic powder, chili powder, red chili pepper flakes and homemade salt free Emeril's Essence.

Oh, my, oh, my!  Wicked, killer BBQ sauce.  Made this in the morning, exactly as written, and used on chicken tonight....to DIE for.  Using this on ribs later in the week.  Bonus points, as written fills a 32 oz jar perfectly.  Jim Beam would be proud of you, Kevin.

Really good sauce. Because I really didn't want to put liquid smoke in my body(that can't be good for you), I wrapped 2 pieces of maple smoked bacon around a sprig of thyme, and cooked for 3-4 minutes, then threw away the bacon and added the onion, garlic and whiskey to the grease. I also pureed a couple of jalapenos in place of the hot pepper sauce.

Just stop looking for BBQ sauce recipes b/c this is the best you'll ever find.  It is absolutely amazing.  I have thrown out all my other recipes and just keep using this one.  In fact I make double and triple batches an freeze in dinner sz portions so I'll always have it on hand.  It's sweet and smokey and a little peppery and delish!!

I used this on pulled pork! This sauce is fantastic!  I used a honey bourbon and cut the liquid smoke in half (personal preference).  This sauce was well worth the effort ... I will double next time so I have some left over for later!!

I KEEP this in the refrigerator at all times which means I make a couple batches a month. I also give it as gifts --- no kidding, it is that good. Everyone goes crazy over it. I usually make the recipe exactly as it is written. Last time I didn't have enough ketchup so I used the whole can of tomato paste & threw in extra Worcestershire and some allspice. Still amazing and I think I'll keep doing that and just reduce the amount of ketchup some since I usually buy the 6 oz cans of tomato paste and hate to lose the remainder to the refrigerator abyss. Wonderful recipe!!!

Made this today.  Left it "chunky" w/ the onions -- no real need to puree'.  Wonderfully delicious.  Used molasses and honey instead of brown sugar.  Used Crown Royal as the whiskey.  Used it as a dipping sauce on dry rub ribbed and a baste for BBQ'd chicken.  Will be a staple in our house.

More like 3.5 stars: I followed the recipe to a T, but I guess I expected too much because of all the 5 star reviews.  While I did like this sauce, it tasted waaaay too much like ketchup.  I purposefully did not use Jim or Jack, as I didn't want the sauce to taste too much like those brands (I used The Famous Grouse because its what we drank in Scotland) but I shouldn't have worried about it because of the overpowering Heinz flavor.  I'm going to play around with it and try to make more to my liking.

Great Recipe! Would like to know what kinds of ketchup people are using for theirs, as I think it can drastically change the taste. I also added one shallot, one jalapeno, and some cinnamon and cumin to my sauce (on double the recipe amount).

I have made lots of BBQ Sauces and this is by far the best.  Prep and cook time are minimal and the end result is fantastic.  I would say this definately more of a pork sauce then a beef or chicken.    I did take the advice of some other reviewers and just cut the onion in chunks.  This allows for easier removal when the sauce is finished.    Also no need use expensive bourbon the cheap stuff works just as well as something like Makers Mark.

Great recipe!  I made this sauce and "Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce" from this site because both recipes received great reviews.  We definitely preferred this sauce.  I followed other reviewers suggestion and left the onion in large wedges so that it was easier to strain.  The only other thing I changed was to simmer it for about 45 minutes because we like our BBQ sauce thick.  My husband said this was better than any bottled sauce we've tried and we have tried MANY!!

This sauce was pretty good.  Used Jack Daniels, based on other reviews.  The Jack Daniels was terribly overwhelming for me (the hubby didn't mind it as much), so I ended up altering it in the end.  We doubled everything except the Jack Daniels, and added some extra brown sugar beyond that.  Next time we will try it with beer, as some of the other reviews have suggested.

Okay.  It tasted yummy as I was making it (couldn't help sneaking a couple of tastes.)  I let it sit for 24 hours, slathered it on baby back ribs and cooked according to the baby back ribs recipe (baking.)  The taste of the sauce pretty much disappeared and it seemed like the ketchup was all that came through.  I was extremely disappointed with the results but I will try again on a different recipe just to make sure adn then re-rate if its a different result!

This sauce is awesome!  I substituted 1 can of spicy V-8 for the ketchup and added the whole little can of tomato paste.  I also added a little bit of cumin and cinnamon.  Instead of straining it I blended it all up in the blender before I cooked it. I'll be using this recipe for years to come!

Delicious!  I will never buy bottled BBQ sauce again.  I especially liked how sauteing the onions in the bourban made them sweet...so when you got a bite of onion it was like a flavor burst in your mouth!  I added more hot sauce to half the batch for the adults and less hot sauce for those with more sensitive taste buds. I also cooked one batch in a skillet as indicated, and another batch in a sauce pan, and preferred the sauce pan since the BBQ sauce didn't get quite as thick.  Slathered the sauce on my buddies excellent homemade smoked ribs and we had a super bowl feast.  Thanks for sharing!

I use this as a general guide for making my own. I use Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey bourbon in mine, using it while cooking down the onions and I also add it into the sauce. I also add some dried chipotle seasoning, garlic, pure maple syrup, honey and some crushed red pepper. I let it cook down and simmer per this recipe and then strain it.

We got a new grill and I broke it in with pork chops and this sauce. It was very good even though I didn't let it mellow in the frig overnight. Will try it again in a couple of days. Had trouble sacrificing the bourbon in a sauce but it was worth every drop.

Very good sauce - I used it for pulled pork and didn't bother straining it. Next time I'll try to make it a bit more spicy for my taste.

This is a good sauce. I modified it slightly, adding 1 tbsp of molasses. I also eliminated the hot sauce and 1 tbsp of smoke flavour and replaced those with a couple of small minced chipotle peppers (in adobo sauce). Turned out well.

I made this a day in advance to use for making pulled pork bbq in a slow cooker.  Fantastic!  No need to strain it for this kind of use, the onion and garlic cook down to nothing.  I added 1/2 tsp chili powder.

YUM!  Slight changes: used Agave Nectar instead of brown sugar to lower the glycemic index and I used a TON (several tablespoons) of Frank's Red Hot Sauce (and 1 T. siracha) to make it nice and spicy.  I have no idea how 1/3 t. would make this spicy.  My beef ribs are slow cooking with this sauce right now and my house smells PHENOMENAL!

Excellent sauce.  I have taken to making this sauce in large batches and canning it myself.  

There is some debate on Bourbon choice.  This sauce deserves Makers Mark.

This couldn't have been easier to make. I had all the ingredients in the pantry. I did us Crown Royal instead of bourbon as that was all I had. This is our new favorite bbq sauce. Can't wait to use it on the grill. I made bbq'd beef sandwiches from a crockpot roast and it was fantastic. Friends were impressed and wanted the recipe too. Thank you so much for sharing.

This was such a HUGE hit the first time I made it with family and friends. Two of my kids would just stand over the pot with spoons. I shared with one of my customers and it became like an addiction! One of them puts it on everything. So much so he has stopped buying store brands and is constantly asking when I was going to make more. Now I make a double batch twice a month.

Fantastic!!! The best BBQ sauce I've tasted. I made this sauce then poured it over my beef brisket in a slow cooker and cooked for 8 hours. It is a state fair winner. I will make it again and again for all my meats and chicken.

I made 30 bottles of this sauce to give as Christmas presents to my Friends here in Italy (it is not a normal condiment to have here) and they loved it! I had some of them tell me they even used it on their pasta !! So I guess this will be my tradition for Christmas now. Thank you so much for the astounding recipe !

I followed the recipe exactly for a totally fair review.  It was wonderful!  I put it on the ribs & chicken the last 1/2 hour of cooking and the vinegar in the recipe also helped tenderize the country style ribs I was cooking.  That is a Memphis secret!  I will be adapting for the future with apples and other additions but this standard receipe will stay the same.  Now to can a few jars!  I will never buy again!

Fantastic BBQ sauce! I made this twice doubling the recipe each time.  My husband said the bourbon was a little strong in the first batch, so in the second batch I only used 1 cup, but other than that I didn't change a thing.  I did put it through the blender so it would be smooth.  The family just loves it!

I used this sauce for the "Amazing Ribs" recipe.  I made it without the liquid smoke and worcestershire (which I forgot to pick up at the store) and it was still very tasty.  A single recipe made enough for 3.5 pounds of ribs.

Thisis the best sauce I have ever made. I make in multiple batches and after it is cooled I put in plastic mayo jars and put into freezer. I always have BQ . Still tastes great.

This sauce will be great for the BBQ, but don't do what I did and use it for ribs in the slow cooker!  I didn't plan ahead and think about the fact that the alcohol can't burn off the same way in the covered slow cooker and the taste of the bourbon was overwhelming.  I will definitely try it again, using it on the grill as recommended and will cut back the amount of bourbon a little too because it was really strong. Easy to make though.  Looking forward to making it to use on some grilled chicken soon.

Ok I USED to cheat on this sauce, but I never will again.  Previously I would start with bottled sauce and add tons of ingredients from this recipe (still awesome), but now having made the whole thing from scratch, I won't go back.  I did add some maple syrup for flavor and a tad of sweetness (only a teaspoon or so), cut back on the liquid smoke by half, and I cooked it a bit longer for thickness, but this is simply incredible.  Thank you thank you thank you for the post.

I make this sauce frequently every summer.  Best when made with a good Whiskey, we get Gentleman Jack just for the taste it lends this sauce.  Trust me, we bought cheap whiskey to make the sauce with and it just wasn't the same!  I don't change a thing, good just the way it is, though if I don't have tomato paste it is fine without.  Best to use fresh cooking onions, I actually throw a whole small one in (diced of course).

This barbecue sauce is really something else.  I made this a few months ago, and I got nothing but compliments on it.  I intially used it with the Amazing Ribs recipe also from this site, but I had a ton left over.   Not for long though, my husband and friends consistently requested it with any type of barbecued food or even just french fries! Needless to say, I was completely out within a month of when I made it.  Also, it seems to get better and better the longer it sits.  I will make more tonight to prepare for the Packers to win the championship this weekend and hopefully have some left for the SuperBowl!! Thanks for the recipe! And yes, you should be bottling this and selling it!
**UPDATE**  The first itme I made it, I used Maker's Mark whiskey because that is what I had on hand, last night I used Jack Daniels because I had no whiskey and that is what my husband brought from the store.  I will try it again tonight, but based on my tasting yesterday, Jack makes it a little more tangy than Maker's Mark. I preferred the taste of the MM version, but the Jack is pretty good as well, depends on how tangy you like your barbecue sauce.

After reading all the reviews, I was so excited to be making this. The smell wasn't very appetizing but I read reviews that said it is best after a few days so I refrigerated it. A few days later I made some baby back ribs using this sauce. I wanted so badly to like this but it just wasn't very good. It had a strong ketchup taste which in itself isn't bad, just not for my barbecue sauce. I much prefer the bottled Jack Daniels sauce on my ribs.

I can't seem to make enough of this BBQ sauce! Everyone in my family loves it. It's easy enough to make and it stores very well for me in a mason jar in the fridge. I'm not going to buy any from the store again. Thank you!

Amazing stuff.  I used 1/2 tsp hot sauce, but would use 1 tsp next time as it mellows out.  As per another reviewer, I might try adding a bit more whiskey when its cooked - just because!
Fantastic just as is though.  Won't buy from the store anymore.

Made this recipe for a Super Bowl party.  I served it with pulled pork. This recipe is outstanding!!! Very easy to make.  I had several friends ask for the recipe. I used 1/2cup of splenda brown sugar instead of regular brown sugar and it tasted great!!!!

Before I made this recipe I had never tried any barbeque sauce with bourbon.  Not even a store bought one.  They never really appealed to me.  I'm glad I finally gave it a try.  It's fabulous!  I adjusted the recipe to 1 cup of sauce to test it first and I loved it.  I didn't use the tomato paste because it only needed 1 T. and I didn't want to open a can for that small of an amount.  I just used additional ketchup.  I also substituted red wine vinegar for the cider; it gives the sauce a little more depth.  My parents are visiting this weekend and I am serving BBQ ribs for dinner and using this sauce with the adjustments.  Give this recipe a try; you’ll be glad you did

I made this for the first time today to go along with a slow cooker pork butt I've been making for years.  I have been searching for this sauce for 26 years, and I'm soooooooooo glad I found it!  It's tangy enough, sweet enough, spicy enough, but I did add 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper, and I only used 1-1/2 Tbls. mesquite liquid smoke.  I used 1/2 tsp. Frank's hot sauce and I'm telling you, my two teen sons and my husband RAVED about it!  It's simply THE BEST I've ever had and I've had lots!!!  Thank you again for this keeper.

Very nice, but I think this is too much work, when I can run out and use Bull's-Eye ®  at $1.89 for 18 oz.  After tasting the original recipe, I added 2 tsp. dried mustard, 2 tsp. cumin and just a pinch of Chinese Allspice.  The original recipe was very, very nice.

This sauce is incredible! I've made it several times and it's been perfect every time. I've used it on ribs, hamburgers and pork. I never strain it either; the chunks of onion are great. For those who want a thinner or less "tomatoie" sauce, just don't use the tomato paste. I've forgotten to use it, and it still tastes great.

I found this recipe was better after I had it in the freezer a while.  I only used part of the recipe the first time and froze the rest.  when I pulled it out of the freezer it was still half frozen... I used it as is by leaving the lump on top of a pan of country style ribs I threw in the oven.  It melted beautifully over the ribs and was wonderful.

Absolutley awesome!!  I added an extra cup of brown sugar to reduce the "sour"
of the apple vinagar. Overall this is a great base to start from however, I would not 
vary from the recipe too much.

This was a great Bar-B-Q sauce.  My boyfriend LOVED it, although it was the first homemade sauce he'd ever tasted.  It had a little too much apple cider vinegar for me, so I will cut down on that next time.  But I will definitely be making this again.  Very big hit with my daughter also.

This is an excellent base recipe and pretty much how I make mine. To enhance the flavor, herbs such as thyme, oregano and tarragon (teaspoon of each) along with about a teaspoon of ceyenne pepper and it can't be beat. For a little extra sweetness to the kick, a quarter cup of maple syrup is nice too.

WOW!!  This was dee-licious.  After adding some dry rub to pork spare ribs, I slathered this sauce on and it was a nice finishing touch.  Finger-licking good.  This is a keeper!!  Thanks for sharing!!

More a BBQ chutney than a sauce.  Flavor was okay, but as other reviewers have mentioned it doesn't know what it wants to be.

I absolutely LOVE this sauce!! I've made it many, many times and I usually double the recipe when I do. What I've learned is that, after simmering it (which I usually do for about an hour), is that pouring it into a blender, in batches, takes care of the chunky issue some reviewers don't care for. Another handy tip: save your old ketchup squeeze bottle to store it in! It's wonderful as written, but I have changed it slightly over the years by omitting salt & adding ground spices (such as ground mustard seed, paprika & chile powder) and I don't add the liquid smoke until I'm done simmering it.

I needed an emergency bbq sauce because the one I had was "gone."  This was easy to make and very delicious. I cut it to 4 servings and left out the two ingredients I didn't have available--the tomato paste and liquid smoke (which I never ever use anyway).  I bet it's even better when you let it sit and let flavors blend well.  I will definitely make this again!  Thank you so very much, Kevin.

I followed this recipe exactly and am unimpressed. We think it had too much cider vinegar. I recall one reviewer mentioned that she cut down on that amount but it slipped my mind. I will try it once more with much less vinegar and hope for the best.

The chances of me ever buying store bought BBQ sauce again are pretty slim after making this sauce! I made a few minor adjustments to suit my family's taste: I cut the onion and garlic into large pieces to allow for easier straining, I was about 1/8 cup short on bourbon, and I was out of cider vinegar so I used white vinegar in its place (I used half of the called for amount though), I also added a few extra TBSP of brown sugar in addition to the called amount.  THIS SAUCE IS FANTASTIC!! I made this a few days ahead of when I needed to have it (for BBQ shredded beef sandwiches) and I left the large chunks of onion and garlic in it.  On the day that I used it, I rewarmed in a sauce pan with the onion and garlic still in it, then strained them out right before I used it.  I think this allowed for the flavor of the onion and garlic to really blend into the sauce for the few days and then was easy to just remove by straining it.  Letting this stay in the fridge for a minimum of 1 day is important I think. Very yummy sauce, I've already recommended and I plan on jarring this delicious goodness and giving it away as gifts. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Let me add my 5 star rating to this great BBQ sauce.  It's the perfect balance of sweet to smokey.  I found a recipe to make country style ribs by boiling in the bbq sauce and then grilling when done.  I didn't have enough of my favorite bottled sauce so found this recipe.  It's something I'll make again and again, with items easily on-hand.  Thanks Kevin for the great recipe!

I made this as written with the possible exception of a little extra garlic. Used this to make Chicken and then a slab of baby back ribs Both on the standard Weber. The picky partner is also a big BBQ ribs fan. She said they were the best she ever had.

I didn't strain the sauce and think the onions and garlic add some more flavor. Put the sauce on the last 45 minutes over in direct heat and it was great.

This is so good! I did a couple things different: for the whiskey I used Jack Daniels honey flavored whiskey. I didn't have the vinegar so I used 1/4 cup of Italian dressing. Didn't use the chili sauce, don't even know what that is honestly. Did almost a full cup of Brown sugar and 1.5 teaspoons cayanne pepper for spice. And I think next time I make it I will do only half the liquid smoke, it was a bit strong. Still the best BBQ sauce!

Awesome stuff-no more store sauce for me--thanks Kevin. Particulars are-- great sticky, thick sauce with great flavor. This means guys that a boil then a simmer has a tendency to send the thick, sticky stuff in random directions every time you lift the lid to stir. I would recommend an outdoor dutch oven as I did or arrange for comfortable dog house when the wife see's what you did to her kitchen.
 In the spice to taste area, I added 1 teaspoon of hobanaro sauce and 1 teaspoon of Famous Dave's rib spices to the prescribed ingredients.
 I used one of those chopping, dicing gadgets on the onion and garlic so that I could leave it all in the sauce and I recycled my used catchup bottle for my batch of this killer sauce. If it gets better as it blends in the next couple days I will have to put a lock on the refrigerator.

This is a fantastic Kansas City style sauce! I smoke boston buts and ribs all the time and my friends rave about this sauce on both.

I do like a smooth sauce but I don't want to give up any of the onion or garlic flavors or the bourbon flavor that has been infused into them. So what I do it run my sauce in the blender on the puree setting. It comes out very smooth and it thickens the sauce up a little bit. You could also use a hand held emulsifier.

Darn good multi purpose sauce...great on pulled pork, ribs, even burgers. I omit the liquid smoke as I cook most of my meat on a smoker. Bourbon or Jack...both work well.

This is one of the best BBQ Sauces I have had. I am from the South and recently moved to Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. There are not alot of choices on ingredients and selections of sauces are limited. We made this and because we can not find liquid smoke eliminated it. However, we still love it and got raves from all that tried it. We are having another dinner to introduce people to a Southern meal this week and are making this sauce again.. this time with pulled pork...LOVE IT!

This sauce is absolutely wonderful.  I have made it twice this past week.  I prefer not to strain it and the minced garlic and onion make a perfectly chunky sauce.  Awesome!!!

This was the first time I made homemade BBQ sauce and it turned out great!!!! I think I may have simmered it a little to long and it thickened to much. I like the vinegar taste in my sauce so I thinned it with a little more and water and it was still great. Used it with Sarges pulled pork recipe from this site..Awesome!! Making it for New Years crock pot Meatballs tomorrow and am sure it will be a pleaser.

This bbq sauce is AMAZING!!! I used it with the SLOW COOKER BARBEQUE recipe on here.

I read most of the comments first and went with what they said. I added extra bourbon, a little less smoke flavoring, used Chalula's Chipotle hot sauce to taste, and a little more tomato paste to thicken it up from the extra bourbon.

I decided to get a nice bourbon to sip on while cooking. I got Knob Creek's Single Barrel, 9-Year bourbon - it's 60% abv. A little strong to drink, but made the sauce EXTRA flavorful. 

I will most definitely make this again!!

This is the 2nd time making this is an excellent recipe.  This time I wanted more kick to the sauce and added 2 Tablespoons of ghost pepper salsa and it was perfect!  One of my most requested recipes...love it!

Kevin, this is over-the-top good!  Way better than restaurant BBQ sauce; even better than our old favorite recipe.  Had it originally with Southern Pulled Pork Sandwiches (from this site).  OMG, so good!  Now DH requests it whenever we need a BBQ:  ribs, chicken, whatever.  Easy to put together and keeps well.  Must refrigerate overnight for best flavor.  Thanks!

This has become my "secret" recipe. Like mashed potatoes, I leave it "chunky", so that everyone knows that it is homemade. This is great as is, and is very flexable for experimenting. I always make a double batch so that I have a reserve. You do need to let this "age".  Thanks for sharing.

Yum Yum Yum!  This sauce rocks!  I pureed the onion and garlic with a bit of the whiskey before cooking it, which made no chunks and I didn't have to strain it.  Make sure to let it sit for a couple days.  The flavor is so much better!  Thanks!

Delish! Left out the liquid smoke and used honey whiskey so also omitted the brown sugar. Very good recipe and flexible for my adjustments, thanks :)

my husband and his friends went to a concert and someone left most of a bottle of whiskey here and this recipe came to mind. i used dried minced onion and rooster sauce for the hot pepper sauce. this is amazing. its cooling now i cant wait to see how the flavors meld together.

Very nice, full bodied sauce but a little strong on the whiskey flavor.  Next time I'll reduce the whiskey by 30% so it's not too overbearing and save money too!

I have made this a couple of times and I really like the sauce.  Good flavor and compliments my meats well.  However, money is tight right now and liquid smoke is expensive these days!  I can buy a good quality bottled sauce much cheaper than the total cost of ingredients of this recipe.  When my cashflow increases I will probably make again.  :)

This sauce is the way to go..... It is a basic sauce that people have been using for years. I remember this recipe from the school of culinary arts that I went to 13 years ago.  I love the fact that Kevin shared it with us. I have been using this for years. Its simple and you cant go wrong.

This is a great sauce as is. However, I made a few changes because; 1. I smoke or cook over charcoal, and 2. because I knew it was going to be on pork. The changes were small, I omitted the liquid smoke, and I added fennel (lets face it fennel is pork's best friend :D). Lastly, I used an immersion blender to give it a more of a store bought sauce look and texture (I didn't strain it and I didn't want to remove the whole onion pieces/flavor).

I have made this recipe a couple of times.  I've used this on ribs and pulled pork.  Its has a wonderful flavor you can't buy anywhere.  I really like using Jim Beam.  To anyone who reads these reviews: Don't strain anything out the first time.  You might find it gives a flavor that is different.

The best sauce ever.  Instead of straining it though, I put it in the blender and hit 'liqiufy' for a few seconds and it comes out smooth and none of the flavor gets removed. I also substitute the ketchup with pureed tomatoes and use dried chipotle pepper flakes for heat as we like it a little hot in Arizona.

this sauce was a hit with Hubby's co-workers... all men and also with some new friends from Holland. Personally it has a stronger flavor than I would perfer, but who am I to argue with men's raving opinion. They are all coming back this weekend for more.

Wanted to try a new BBQ sauce for brisket so decided to make the bourbon sauce.  When I first made the sauce I was not sure of the whiskey taste..but after letting it blend for several hours it was FABULOUS.  Will make again and use it on different meats.  Usually make a vinegar sauce for pulled pork but this sauce was delicious, too.  Added a little to baked beans...also good.  Used as a dipping sauce for grilled turkey sausage...you can't go wrong with this sauce.

This is stupid good. I'm trying not to drink it by the glassful as we speak. Followed recipe exactly, used Knob Creek bourbon, and strained out onions at end.
Thank you Kevin.

Seriously great recipe and easy.  Added approx 1/4 cup honey.  Also, I only had minced onion and garlic, turned out fantastic.   1/8 tsp minced garlic = 1 clove garlic.  1.5 TBLS minced onion = 1 onion.

This was yummy.. I used a brown sugar substitute and it worked great. The sauce got very thick so I thinned it out with a bit of water.. will make again sometime.

Love this sauce!  I used Crown Royal for the whiskey, regular vinegar and about half the liquid smoke called for.  I minced the onion and garlic and had every intention of straining it before brushing on my pork tenderloin, but decided not to.  I actually liked the teensy pieces of onion and garlic that I came across.

I used this to make shredded bbq chicken in my crock pot and it was great.  The only changes I made were I didn't use the tomato paste because I was out of it, I used Splenda brown sugar instead of regular and I cut the recipe to 4 servings.

I halved this recipe because I didn't need a ton. I used seagrams 7 whiskey because its all I had on hand. I also didn't have any smoke flavoring. It was very tart and vinegary, so I ended up adding a little more brown sugar, a little extra tomato paste, more pepper, and some honey at the end. It was good served over my pork roast and grits, but I had to tweak it to our tastes. Thanks!

We love this BBQ sauce! I slow-cook beef, pork, or chicken in the crock pot all day. Then I take it out, drain it, shred it, and put it back into the crock pot with this sauce for a couple hours. SO good! Always a great thing to serve guests especially in the summer.   The easiest way for me to do this is to just put the whole garlic cloves in the whiskey and to roughly chop up the onion and then put the whole sauce through a blender at the end.   Wonderful stuff! I've made it before without the tomato paste (since I was out of it) and it still was very good.

Made this for brisket last weekend - at first thought it would be too ketchup-y, but ended up wonderful!  (even better the next day).  Even had requests for the recipe - good stuff :)

Great sauce, left out Tomato paste to give a thinner consistency.

Used with smoked pulled pork.  Made a few alterations because we pulled this together last minute.  We didn't have whiskey so we used some brandy, didn't have tomato paste so we used a bit of pizza sauce, and we added honey.  We omitted the liquid smoke since we added it to the pulled pork while it was still on the smoker and it thickened up nicely.  It was a hit.

I made this for Father's Day with baby back ribs. It was too sweet for our liking. My 95 year old Dad gave me a recipe many years ago, will stick with that one.

Great recipe. Had to get schooled in Bourbon whiskey vs regular wiskey at the LCBO and when we put it in a ketchup container to skirt out, the onion pieces get stuck. Probably a good idea to mince the onions rather fine.

I've made this twice and it gets better every time. I have added 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper and it has a nice little kick! Great recipe!

Terrific!!!! Did not strain off the onions/garlic. I used 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper instead of the hot pepper sauce. The cayenne pepper gave it just the right amount of "kick" and we served it over pulled pork......Yummy.  Would not hesitate to make this again and share with friends with discriminating taste. Thank you for sharing this "keeper".

I just made this today and am letting it set over night, as suggested. The taste is already amazing! I did strain the sauce, but kept the onions and garlic combo that was left. My husband made a roast beef sandwich with swiss cheese on chibatta bread and topped it with the onions from the sauce. It tasted like something that would be served in a top-notch deli!! Incredible!

It was fun to simmer up a delicious bbq sauce! I used Jack, which was all I had on hand, but plan using boubon for my next batch.

If i could would give it a 4.5!!! a great recipe and really lives up to the hype.  I was first apprehensive after simmering the onions in used a mixture of JD and jim bean as i didnt have enough.   I doubled the recipe and used only 75% the designateed amount of whisky.  After i made it, it was way too tangy but after a day the flavours definately blended together.  This is defo a put it in the fridge and wait sauce, as it get better and better as the days go by, bt defo need to add abit more sugar nxt time.

I made this as written but only used half of the liquid smoke. It DEFINATELY improves with time in the fridge so make this at least two days in advance from when you want to use it. I didnt like the taste of it when I made it but two days later it tasted good. If I make it again, I will probably double it.

I just made this recipe (the first time ever making bbq sauce) and it is pretty good.  It has a zesty flavor to it.  I did make a couple of changes only because I didn't have everything it called for.  I used white wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar, regular JD whiskey, and no liquid smoke.  I added diced peaches to it for a recipe I have and it is really tasty.  It tastes so familiar but neither hubby nor I can figure it out, either way- its good!  Thanks for the recipe.

Sweet, savory sauce that you can modify--used half the sugar, yet still too sweet for me.  I will stick to my other sauces from this site.

We really enjoyed this sauce on our crock pot pulled pork! I doubled the recipe and followed it almost to a T, but used less garlic, less worcestershire sauce, omitted hot sauce, and I added molasses! It was sweet and tangy! I put most of the sauce in with the pulled pork, and ran the reserve through a blender so it was smooth to put on the sandwiches later.  I bet the sauce would be great on grilled chicken!  Thanks for a recipe I will certainly use again!

Really Good!!  I add red pepper to taste when I need spicey.  I even added apricot jelly for sweet & the combination of the jelly & red pepper with the whiskey was unbeleivable on Ribs.

Didn't care for this too much. It was very "chunky" with onions and garlic. There was no way you could have strained it like it says at the end of the recipe. I saved myself some trouble by using the already minced garlic in a jar instead of chopping it up myself. I'm sure if I had a food processor that would have been helpful too.

Like this recipe needs anymore 5 star ratings...but this BBQ sauce is just phenomenal!!  It was so easy to make and goes on any BBQ fare.  I made a double batch and used it on ribs, pulled pork, steak and hamburgers!  I will never buy pre-made BBQ sauce in the store ever again after trying this recipe!

Yummy! I let the sauce sit covered in my refrigerator for a couple of days after cooking and the flavor improved each day.  I put a 4-5 pound rump roast in the crockpot, covered it with this sauce and cooked on low for 10 hours or until tender enough to shred for bbq beef sandwiches.  Awesome!

I am not a big fan of BBQ, but this is a great sauce. I followed the recipe to the letter. (I used Jim Beam) Next time I will use less brown sugar only because it was a little sweet for me; but my family who loves BBQ liked it the way it was. The flavor is much better after a few days. I doubled the batch and canned the remaining sauce. I will definately be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.
****Needed something quick for dinner, I used this BBQ sauce to make sloppy joe, added bell pepper to the hamberger and poured in the BBQ, kids thought it was the best sloppy joe they had.****

This is one of the most amazing sauces I've ever had. I made enough for supper one night and everyone loved it. I ended up using almost a half of a 40oz bottle of Jack to make more of this sauce and bottle it. I gave a few bottles away and everyone kept asking for more (if you like it you may not want to share it with anyone for this reason, or practice saying no). I recommend adding just a little extra bourbon. It will make it taste even better. There was no questoning that I used Jack in mine, but since the alcohol get's cooked out it is not overpowering. It just tastes absolutely amazing.

This sauce is incredible!!! I have two dessert recipes that take Bourbon, so I'm always glad to have another use for it. I made a double batch and canned it, it looks so pretty in the jars, but will not last long in my house. The only change I made was I doubled the garlic. 
After it was out of the pot, I just stood there with some leftover steak cleaning out the pot. YUMMY!

Yummy! I made this just like the recipe called for! Except for a little extra bourbon since I didn't want a bottle with only one shot left in it in the cabinet! We put this on pork spare ribs this evening and we loved it! I did strain out the veggies! I can't wait to make this in large batches and can it so I can give it out to friends! Thanks a bunch!

Very, very good sauce. My family really enjoyed it. I made it exactly as written except for the bourbon. We don't drink bourbon so I didn't have it in the house.  I tried my neighbors but they didn't have any either (although me calling around at 3:00 in the afternoon asking for some Jack Daniels did give them some laughs.)  It was still wonderful. My husband already asked me to make the sauce for his fathers day bbq ribs dinner but this time he wants the recipe made exactly as listed. Can't wait to taste the difference. Thank you.

wow, this is a great recipe for good bbq sauce. i added four sliced lemons and some honey and it's the best i've tasted. i calculated servings for 10 and the recipe was on the money. you should do this recipe days before you cook because for everyday, the sauce gets better. this sauce needs to be bottled and sold. great job!!!!!!

I used Jack Daniels for this recipe.  I have to admit, the whiskey, onions and garlic simmering smelled awful, but because of the expense, I kept going.  As soon as the rest of the ingredients hit the pot, especially the liquid smoke, it smelled great!  I added this sauce to shredded Kahlua Pork in a Slow Cooker (from this site), and simmered for an hour.  It was really good, and I will probably make it again.  Not the best BBQ sauce, but one worth revisiting.

This recipe rocks! I made a batch today and simmered short ribs with it. My teenagers ate the ribs right out of the pot! I will definately use this recipe from now on.

I used this sauce with Sarge's EZ Pulled Pork  recipe from this site. Like others, I cut the onion into larger slices but I don't believe this to be necessary since I strained mine anyway. It most definately gets better after sitting overnight giving everything time to balance and blend. I cooked the batch for more than the 20 minutes called for (30 minutes) and I would definately do that again. It really did turn out delicious.

If everyone knew about this sauce,KC Masterpiece would be out of business. I used Jim Beam bourbon whiskey and minced roasted garlic from a jar. Didn't have tomato paste so I used tomato sauce. I like my BBQ sauce sweet and spicy so I added a couple of tablespoons more brown sugar and one teaspoon cayenne pepper. If you like thick,tomato based sauces,this one's for you.

I used this barbecue sauce on spare ribs.  It was really, really good (although I'm still trying to decide if it's "thee sauce" I'm searching for). It is good when it's just cooked, but gets better and better the longer it sits in the frigde.  I sent my 21-year old son to buy "good" bourbon.  He came back with "Old Crow" ($7.99/bottle)!  I used it and the sauce still tasted great!  My family really liked it.

I don't think I will ever buy store bought bbq sauce again.  The only advice I would give is to add the liquid smoke a teaspoon at a time.  Depending what meat you are serving this on you may not want it that smokey.  I will make this every time!

I made this sauce for the first time two years ago and it has been a favorite ever since. One time I only had rum and used it instead of the whiskey. Sauce was just as good.  I've also added about half a cup of water to thin out a little bit.  Otherwise, thick is fine too.

My family loved this bbq sauce recipe.  My in-laws are from the south and all we can get here in Colorado is sweet sauce.  When I first cooked this sauce, it smelled and tasted like whiskey...bad.  But the sauce sat for a day, the flavors blended, and it is wonderful.  Will use from now on.

This recipe is great.  However i like my sauce a bit sweeter.  So i add 1 cup of brown sugar.  That makes it taste perfect.  Excellent on chicken and steaks.  Lasts several days in the refrigerator.

All I can say is that I was bummed out by the results of this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly except without the liquid smoke (I didn't have any).  Even with the boiling & simmering time specified, this still smelled and tasted like bourbon!  I used Maker's Mark bourbon whiskey and even added a little less than a cup.  I cooked a pork tenderloin with this BBQ sauce in my crock pot for 5 hours - the last hour with the lid off, and it still tasted like whiskey.  Needless to say, I didn't feed that pork to my toddler and I'm still searching for a good from-scratch BBQ sauce.

This was the first time I made homemade BBQ sauce & it was delicious.  If you don't care for things too tangy, I would suggest adding less cider vinegar or more brown sugar.  I added 1/4 cup more brown sugar & didnt find it too sweet. Great recipie...thanks!

I LOVE this BBQ suace.  No more store bought stuff for me, and it is SO easy to make.  I make triple batches so I don't run out.  The only modification I make is to cut down on the liquid smoke just a touch but that is a matter of personal preference.

This is excellent.  I've made it several times and found if you strain it for a smooth sauce, it makes 3 cups instead of the listed 4 cups. Good to know if you want extra for basting, depending on the number of racks you make. I also agree that it taste better if the flavors can blend for at least 24 hours.

With this recipe, I cut the steak into small strips, then covered them in the marinade, wrapped them in tin foil, added some fresh tomatoes and bell peppers, put it on the grill for 15 to 20 minutes and served it over rice.  It was fabulous!  the sauce is amazing.

YUMMMMM!!  Used Jack Daniel's Whiskey and cut the onions into quarters.  I didn't use any hot sauce and used slightly less apple cider vinegar.

Update 9/3- made this recipe for a second time for a Labor Day weekend.  This time I used it on BBQ Chicken and Pulled Pork.   this stuff is delicious!!!

im super picky about what sauce I'd pair with my bbq pork, but this one makes a perfect match. The only edit is to use stillhouse black bourbon. it has hints of coffee bean and vanilla and so smooth that it accents the great combination of ingredients. My kids are begging me to make them bbq sauce to take home.

This was a big hit with the family....including a 'still a little picky eater' teenager.  I followed directions as is but instead of hot sauce I used a little bit of my favorite chili seasoning.  You do need to be patient with this sauce....first tasting after initial simmer was very vinegary to me, but I let it cool on the stove and allowed it to set up and the flavors just really came through.  I got more comments on the sauce than on the ribs I used the sauce on.  A definite keeper and repeater!

I’ve made a few batches of homemade barbecue sauce before, but this is seriously the easiest I’ve ever made.  Other recipes are labor intensive, or too simple, leaving you with basically seasoned ketchup.  This was great!  Easy to make, great flavor!

My go-to BBQ sauce! I've probably made this over 100 times now. Can't say enough about it. I have since added my own twists but a great recipe!

This Tennessee born and breed girl used Jack Daniels.  This is the most perfect Appalachian BBQ ever!  The alcohol burns off during sauteing  of the onions and garlic creating the perfect  combination of flavor. Most awesome recipe ever :)

i made it as described the first time and really liked it. Key is to make sure you simmer the alcohol taste from the whiskey. This is my go to sauce now. I add a bit more heat for my taste, but definitely needs to sit for a couple of days to marry the flavors.

This recipe is awesome!!! I used Knob Creek bourbon for mine. I chose Stubbs Liquid Hickory Smoke and I used Texas Pete for the hot sauce. I let it set in the fridge in a mason jar for 4 days before using it. It tasted great when I made it but even better after a few days in the fridge. I cut the onion and garlic in larger pieces (about the size of a quarter) to make it easier to strain. I will definitely be making more and very soon as I probably won’t ever buy BBQ sauce again.

The family loved this.  Couldn't find my liquid smoke so I substituted A1 sauce and it was still terrific.  Won't be buying bottled sauce anymore.  This was easy enough for weeknights.

I was somewhat nervous about how strong the vinegar taste was at first , but as was suggested I let it sit in the fridge for a couple of days- it was absolutely awsome!  Many requests for the recipe and will definitely make again...Don’t be scared!!

Really enjoyed this sauce. I did change it a little bit. I cut the liquid smoke to 1 T. Instead of 2 the recipe called for.  I added a little more fresh garlic.  When done I put it in a blender to make it smooth.  I used Buffalo Trace bourbon, but could use a cheaper Whiskey an save the BT for sipping.  My husband really liked it on the ribs I fixed. Will make this an can it for xmas gifts.  Other reviewers said to times ingredients by  6 an you will get 9 pints out of it.

I used Jim Beam Honey and oh wow this was amazing, We added 1/4 C. Hot Sauce (Tapatio) and We were calling it Dragon Spit in our house, but oh do we LOVE hot! it is that kind of hot that builds but then goes away so not a lasting burn :) you know to get that first bite every time feel, I bottled the rest and using it to dip my home made pizza crust into :) Yes I am a self admitted dipper but NEVER a double dipper :)

I've made this twice now, both times it was an absolute hit.  The basic recipe is a great point from which to go sweet, smoky or hot.  I find adding a bit of bourbon after it is cooked and using very hot sauce, Blair's or Dave's high scoville sauces gives me the flavor I love.  Strong whiskey tone with real heat.  Now when I make it, I divide it and just spice up one part for myself.  Easy to divide it and go from mild to wild in small canning jars.

Good recipe. I changed it slightly by adding 1/4 cup molasses and 1 tbs crushed red pepper. Also needed more salt and pepper than was called for.

After seeing several people comment this tasted like ketchup, I replaced the ketchup with plain tomato sauce. It turned out beautifully. I will be making a large batch and canning it to give out at Christmas.

Awesome! My son, myself, and others thought this was amazing. This is a fantastic BBQ sauce. The reviewer who said that the flavors compete does not know what he/she is talking about. The flavors meld into a wonderful and delightful BBQ treat. I have to admit I was skeptical about the amount of bourbon and salt, but I did as instructed and am so glad I did. Diyeana said you could use any Bourbon - it's true. I got the cheapest Kentucky bourbon (Old Crow Sour Mash Kentucky Bourbon) the second time I made this, and it made no difference. As recommended by the author, Kevin, let it sit overnight in the fridge for the flavors to blend (as with many recipes). This is the best sauce I have made or had, and I have been making homemade BBQ sauce for years. No kidding. I intend to use this recipe for shredded pork BBQ next time after cooking the pork in a slow cooker with spices for 8 hours first :). I have used this recipe a few times exactly as written with total success. It even beats my grandma's handed-down recipe (and I loved my grandma's cooking!). Brush it on chicken, pork, or use it as the sauce for pit beef, chicken, or pork BBQ sandwiches. You (and your guests) won't be disappointed!

This sauce is excellent!  Thanks for sharing!! I will never buy bbq sauce again!  I took someone else's suggestion, tripled it and made it in the crock pot. Used a little less liquid smoke and a little more hot sauce but otherwise kept to the recipe.  This made 6 pints.

I made this sauce last year for a big family and friends bbq. I smoked a brisket with Jack Daniels whiskey barrel wood chips and provided this sauce as a condiment. Everyone loved the sauce. It complimented the smoked brisket perfectly. I'm starting another batch now. I think I'll crank it up a bit this time with just a touch more whiskey (the cheapest they make) and a bit more hot sauce (Cholula) and ground pepper. I will keep it sweet and perhaps add a teaspoon of black strap molasses for depth. I plan to back off the tomato paste by half to allow the other flavors to step up. The original recipe is a little heavy on tomato flavor as original but still very  good.

This is now my go to recipe for BBQ sauce.  I have tried using different Liquors, such as Jack Daniels, and something that said Whiskey on the bottle at my Grandfather's house.  Jack Daniels was my families least favorite.  Random whiskey at Grandfather's house was most favorite.  Now if only I knew what I had used.  Thanks for sharing recipe!  I take great pride in making BBQ sauce now that I can make it myself now.  Never store bought sauce in our home.

We loved this recipe! Contrary to some other reviews it was not too sweet and the bourbon was definitely not overpowering. In fact, the bourbon was hardly noticable. I cut the onion and garlic into large chunks to make it easier to remove. I used half the amount of tomato paste because it's all I had. Just make sure you don't rush and make sure you give it enough time to simmer and you will be happy!

This is awesome! Others have said they use the cheapest whiskey which is accurate, however I like to use the honey flavored whiskey... Such as Jack Daniels Honey. I like to put the sauce in a blender after is has cooled and get the onions and garlic blended in.... It really gives a fuller richer flavor! 
Love this, great on chicken ribs or pulled pork.

It is good, but not great. With theses additions, I would give it 5 stars: 1TBSP soy sauce, 1/2 tsp ginger, and 1 tsp dry mustard, and an extra tablespoon of brown sugar.
 Also, I could only stand it with half the smoke flavor added. I couldn't even imagine this with all the smoke flavor!

Hands down, one of the tastiest BBQ sauces I have tasted! We made shredding pork loin using Guinness for the liquid, then tossed the meat with this sauce. My husband and father-in-law couldn't get enough of it! We are expats in Malaysia and couldn't find liquid smoke, but I seared the pork to give it a smoky flavor, and it turned out fastastically!

This barbeque was delicious. We had it with a smoked boston butt and it was awesome. Definitely my favorite homemade BBQ sauce so far!

I wanted a bourbon based sauce. So I tried this. I doubled the amounts and added 2 ham hocks.  Wow it's great. I put a little on my pork sandwich. I love it.

Oh my gosh!!! I was skeptical about the bourbon and hot pepper sauce and almost left them out, but wow! I would have missed out BIG TIME if I had. I agree with another reviewer- I'll never buy another BBQ sauce in the store again!! I'm going to make extra and put them in mason jars as part of Father's Day gifts to my dad and father-in-law.

This sauce is fantastic, when I review recipes I try not to stray too far from the original. I did use 2 tbs. rendered bacon grease, for that smoky flavor, in place of liquid smoke, I just do not like that stuff. Also cut the salt in 1/2. For the people that thought it had a strong bourbon flavor, maybe the alcohol did not cook off, because there was just a very mild hint of bourbon flavor. I will make this all summer.

Loved it! Instead of hot pepper sauce, I added Dijon mustard (or, as autocorrect would insist: Simon mustard), and it was FABULOUS.

I made this to go on ribs I prepared that same night, and I didn't like it. I thought it was a problem with the sauce. But I saved the rest of it anyway and used it later on pulled pork, and again on a roast chicken. Both were phenomenal. I think letting it age was the key.

Excellent. Have never tried to make BBQ sauce before. This was superb. I made large batch (multiplied everything x4 EXCEPT vinegar and liq smoke x3 only). One daughter suggested I add more liquid smoke but I was happy with the flavor. I canned (4) 1 Qt jars and that was exactly how much it made. Will make this again as well as make it for Christmas as gifts. I used Southern Comfort (I don't drink much so didn't know what different brands would do to flavor---went cheap). May try Jack Daniels next time to see if there is a difference in flavor. I left onions (but I almost minced them) and garlic in the sauce without straining.

This is the second time I've made this (first time as written minus the salt), this time with a couple of changes, and it's still fabulous as the first time, thus my 5 star rating for the recipe itself. 

I cut the sugar in half (unpacked) and had to use red wine instead of whiskey as I didn't have any this time. I never add any additional salt, and didn't have any tomato paste. It still thickened up nicely, and I'm not going to strain it as it tastes wonderful as is.

This sauce is just delicious! I like my sauce a little spicier and sweeter, so added a dash of Sriracha, as well as some peach preserve. Also slightly reduced bourbon, and simmered it for a couple of hours to make sure the alcohol evaporated. Thanks, Kevin for a great recipe. My BBQ sauce buying days are behind me.

This sauce is alright. It has a really strong tomato/ketchup taste. I only got about 2 and a 1/4 cups out this as well, not 4 cups like it says. I'm going to make it again with less ketchup, maybe a little more tomato paste in replace of the ketchup, and more bourbon.

Here are some recommendations for this recipe....  I personally think that fresh, roasted vegetables taste far better.  You can roast veggies in an oven on lower heat with olive oil, but I prefer to do my roasting on my charcoal grill.  I also add ONE of the following combinations: ONE ghost chili pepper (dried, reconstituted, roasted, and seeded), 2 habaneros (roasted and seeded), or 4 jalapenos (roasted and seeded).  Use A1 instead of the Worcestershire sauce.  I also used Himalayan pink salt and added smoked (yes smoked) paprika.  I have tried it with both light and dark brown sugar.  A tiny bit of molasses can't hurt either ( I have used up to a 1/4 cup).

I killed my first batch of this sauce :( I followed the recipe to the letter after all the reviews said to do that. I live in Australia where liquid smoke is scarce (I had not heard of it until this recipe), I found a company called misty gully here in oz. Not sure if their smoke is more concentrated than the yankee stuff? But mine was bitter and waaaaay to smokey with 2 tablespoons of the stuff in, I had another go, this time with 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke and the sauce was great. With 2 tablespoons there was no way you were going to taste the bourbon, just smoke :(. In the end the only changes I made were 1 cup of bourbon :) and 1 teaspoon of LS instead of 2 tablspoons. For all those aussies trying this sauce, misty gully also make an "outback campfire" LS which gives the sauce a great caramel colour with a great smoke flavour, once again only 1 teaspoon, the outback campfire really takes it to the next level. The sauce packs a good load of flavour and makes me look like a pro!
PS. If you don't believe me about the liquid smoke, at least try it with 1 teaspoon and give it a taste before you go adding 2 tablespoons blindly :)
PSS. I signed up to this website just to write this review, sauce is amazing!

Made exact recipe, and put into a jar for a few days. I am so disappointed. IMHO, this should this only be used as a brush on BBQ to be broiled or grilled and not as a 'sauce' on shredded meat. I won't waste my whiskey on this a second time. Perhaps it is my personal taste, but I don't care for bottled sauce because most are so sweet, and this reminded me of something straight off the shelf.

I've made this several times and always double the recipe to have extra on hand.  Primarily, I use this for pulled pork.  Using cheap bourbon (It will taste the same and it's a waste of good bourbon & funds to use good bourbon.) I followed the directions exactly.  I have, the last couple to times added a bit of chili powder and chipotle powder to add a little bite.  It is BETTER the next day and if you don't care for vinegar (I love it.) you may need to cook down the sauce more.  Regardless, everyone I have cooked this for experienced love-at-first-bite & it's now my go-to recipe for great sauce.

Well the BBQ flavor probably would have been good, except the whiskey overpowered it. Maybe I used the wrong brand. I'll try without it next time and see.

This is fabulous- as is, as well I added just a bit of molasses.  As far as chunks go- I loved the garlic and bits of onion; however my boys enjoy the flavor and not the texture (we run into this problem w/fresh salsas as well) So- after cooking approx 45 mins on low- put all of sauce into a blender and blended till smooth.  Made a really nice thick sauce w/fabulous flavor- just w/o the chunks!   Thank you for sharing this recipe- we are planning to make large batches and to share w/friends and neighbors ;)

This was a very good and unique BBQ sauce. It was definitely better after it sat in the fridge for a couple days, as the flavors melded. I strained the sauce, as I like smooth sauces. I used this for BBQ chicken and also for BBQ chicken pizza. I still have some leftover and plan to mix it with ranch dressing for BBQ chicken ranch salad.

I followed this recipe exactly except for one thing...I sauteed the onions and garlic in two tablespoons of butter, and then added the bourbon.  I thought it was going to be too smoky and too sweet, but it's actually pretty balanced.  I chose Frank's Red Hot for the hot sauce, and used about a teaspoon.  I could have used more.  Next time I'll probably try some Huy Fong Sriracha (the bottle with the rooster on it).  I also used the minimum simmer time.  I think this sauce would be more intense the longer it is simmered.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is really tasty!  I used regular whiskey (Glenfiddich) because that's what I had on hand, but it turned out with a wonderful flavor.  I also used the cheapest ketchup I could find.  I'll make this often and won't be purchasing BBQ sauce again!

This is truly the best BBQ sauce you will ever put in your mouth!! I almost always tweak a recipe to suit our family, but in this case, I went with my instincts and didn't change a single thing (except that I did NOT strain out the onions, instead I used my cheese grater to shred the onion instead of cutting it and I pretty much ended up with onion pulp that needed no straining). Please, please try this recipe just as it's written and see if it isn't the very best bbq sauce you've ever had! (I use this sauce for marinades but it is also the only sauce I will ever use for pulled pork sandwiches - YUM!!!)

I literally just made this recipe, and I must say.....IT'S FREAKIN AMAZING!!!! I can smell it now while it's in my slow cooker. I did the recipe exactly as called for, but I doubled it. THe onlt thing I left out was the hot pepper sauce, cuz I know the old folks in my fam don't like things too hot. Definitely my go to sauce now.

I am prefacing my review by stating that I don't actually care for barbeque sauce. With that said, I actually really like this recipe and always pair it with Southern Pulled Pork recipe from AR, which I have made approximately 5 times. It complements the dish well and everyone who has tried it likes it. I don't change anything in the recipe as it is perfect as written. I will continue to make it for years to come.

Absolutely the best recipe online!

I used Jack Daniels instead and I am in heaven.

I have search the world over for this recipe for my mesquite smoked ribs. This is absolutely hands down the best recipe for BBQ Sauce EVER!

I used cayenne pepper 3/4 teaspoons and man it is perfect!

It's snowing outside and this recipe is in my slowcooker now!  We've used this recipe on beef, chicken and venison; as a side sauce, a glaze and in pulled bbq, it's always gotten rave reviews from everyone.  It's our go-to BBQ - thanks Kevin!

Amazing, made it and used it over baby back ribs. First put the ribs in slow cooker for 3 hours, then glaze them with the sauce, grill them and you have the most amazing ribs you can find. The sauce is simply great, let stand for a night before use and the flavor will be better, I left the onions and garlic, adds a nice touch to the sauce!
Cheers

I just made this this afternoon and it is wonderful!! I have it in the fridge now and I can't wait to see how in tastes in a couple of days.

I used Jack Daniels (I had some on hand and I don't actually drink it) and a sweet onion but other wise followed the directions as written. 

I read the reviews where people said the onion and garlic were hard to strain out of the sauce but I wanted to get plenty of flavor so I cut both my onions and garlic to a small dice.  When I was ready to strain it out I put a mesh colander over a bowl and pushed the sauce around with plastic spatular.  This easily separated the sauce from the onion mix. I also put the onion mix aside to I can used them when I make pulled pork.

I made this for a small dinner party. Although I substituted Southern Comfort for bourbon the sauce was still fantastic. I will definitely make it again, both with bourbon and my substitution.

Excellent
Followed the recipe almost exact.
Cooked a pork butt overnight in 7up,then added the BBQ sauce the next morning. It was a hit. Family was eating the pork BBQ even without buns. My daughter in law who is not a big meat eater had seconds.

This BBQ was really easy to make. I added a cup of frozen blueberries with the rest of the ingredients at the end. It gives it a bit of a sweet surprise. I also put the BBQ in the blender on liquefy for a few seconds, as mentioned in another review. I am currently allowing the sauce to sit overnight to blend the flavors. Excited to try it!

This sauce was the first that I tried on this site and now my family is hooked.  The sauce is excellent for most bbq meats and is easy to use because it comes out thick and immediately sticks to the meat.  Awesome flavor and especially good when you leave the small chunks in.

Wowza!  Used lemon juice instead of vinegar, used dehydrated onion flakes instead of onion, garlic powder instead of garlic, and added cane syrup also and doubled the brown sugar...  Needed BBQ sauce for brisket and had to use what I had...  OMG!  Oh!  I also used prob a T of louisiana hot sauce...  SO GOOD!

I did not use the liquid smoke because my wife does not like smokey foods, but used molasses for some of the sugars. Turned out great.

This is absolutely the Best BBQ I have ever had. I am from Texas living in Colorado where good BBQ is hard to find. I will never buy store bought again. I did take the liquid, onions and garlic and blend prior to cooking. I don't like to strain. Canned in Ball Jars and let sit for 48 hours before tasting. FANTASTIC!

This is one of the very best BBQ sauces I have ever made.  I did make a couple big changes one day.  I wanted to try adding a different sweet, so I added 1/2 cup of honey and then used a full teaspoon of Habanero sauce.  When it first came off, it was almost sickeningly sweet, but the next day. . .  I love how flavors mellow.

This is very similar to the homemade sauce I make, except mine doesn't have the vinegar and has a few more spices. I have found it is really good to use the Chopped Roasted Garlic that comes in the little jars in this, as the garlic flavor is a bit more mellow and blends nicely with the bourbon and the smoke flavor. Great recipe tho! Thx!

Very, very good sauce, although I did cut back on the wiskey and liquid smoke a bit and added mustard powder and roasted fresh tomato puree, I loved the sauce, tasted close to goodie companys sauce. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Has anyone tried freezing the sauce? I'd like to make a  big batch and freeze it, if it freezes well. This is the first home made barbeque sauce I have ever made (even though I make almost everything from scratch). It is phenomenal! For the first time making it, I made no adjustments  because I wanted to see what the base recipe is like. Next time I may tweak it with some chiptole peppers in adobe and perhaps apricot preserves (the fruit only kind with no added sugar or artificial sweetner).

One word: AWESOME! My wife isn't a real BBQ fan, but she LOVES this sauce. Have used it four times in three weeks it's so good. Works best over a grill when it can caramelize on the meat, but have found that it works just as well as a full immersion sauce for a slow cooker. Talk about yummy pulled pork. WOW!!   I think I'll use this for the next potluck at the office. Everyone is always trying to top others with their BBQ, and I believe this is so good it'll make the rest crawl home in shame! Top notch recipe, and should be a staple in every BBQ arsenal.  Oh yeah...and put it all in a food processor on high for a smoother sauce, then strain it if desired.

Amazing!  I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit.  I made the sauce a couple days n advance, and then marinade the meat for about 18 hours.  Delicious!

We really like this recipe.  We make it one day ahead or so...put it in the crock pot with chicken breasts - I think 6 or 7 breasts then put it on low for 11 hours - or whatever.  Come home, shred chicken and viola!  Serve it up on rolls with a slice of cheddar cheese and your guests will go on and on.

Seriously good sauce! I've found that by processing the onions and garlic with a tablespoon or so of whiskey to a smooth paste in a blender before cooking makes this recipe much simpler.

I really like this recipe.  It has a good flavor.  I will only change one thing.  I will use half of the tomato paste. I baked ribs in the oven today and the sauce was much better than store bought.  I will make it again and again.

After so many great reviews, I was really surprised that we didn't like this very much.  The vinegar and liquid smoke gave it a bite that we did not enjoy.  Sorry.  I don't like writing a bad review, but we will not use this recipe again.

This stuff is awesome and made me change my mind about store bought stuff...UGH. I did add a couple chipotle peppers and cooked all of it in the crock pot. I swear I could eat it by the spoon full. I am whipping up a batch for pulled pork for the Super Bowl!

Wow-this is amazing! I don't like sweet BBQ sauce so I only used 1/4 the amount of brown sugar, more or less to take the tangy edge off. Our house smelled wonderful, and our guests were very pleased (as were we)!

This was my first time making BBQ sauce homemade and what a treat. Me and my fiance absolutely loved it. I followed the recipe exactly and it made enough sauce to marinate 4 pork chops with plenty left over for another 4-6. The bourbon really makes it. For extra heat I added 1 tsp. of habanero Tabasco. Delicious!

great sauce! I live in Austria. There is only one bbq sauce I have found in the stores. It's Heinz bbq sauce. I'm really glad this recipy was shared. I use half the worcestershire sauce and subsitute one spoon of smoke for a spoon of Maggi (which may only be availible in europe, it's a soup booster). I've tried many variations and this is my familys favorite. I put it on bbq baby back ribs and chicken a couple of times about 5 min before it's finished. Friends and family over here really enjoy coming to my house for bbq, beer and horseshoes. I enjoy sharing my American bbq culture. Thanx, Nudi.

We weren't that fond of this sauce. There was nothing bad tasting about it, so I gave it a 4- we just prefer Sweet Baby Rays, which comes in a bottle and is easier, cheaper, tastes better (to us anyway), and doesn't waste my whiskey!

This is a 5 star. I bought 2 pork sholders and used the North Carolina-style pulled pork rub recipe this weekend. I smoked the meat in my smoker with the woodchips. After I pulled the meat I put it in this sauce for a little while. I prepaired the sauce the night before. I will use this sauce for everything. Thank you

I just can't believe that you haven't bottled this recipe yet.  I followed the directions to the letter and my guests loved the sauce so much that some wanted to drink it from the sauce pan.  The second time I made it, I lowered the amount of onions and it still turned out perfect.  I have been ranting and raving about this sauce that I won't tell my co-workers where I got it from.

AWESOME!!! This was the best tasting bbq sauce I have ever tried. I will be using this recipe again and again. I used Jack Daniels for the whiskey, that is my personal favorite. Thanks for a great recipe

The only change I made was omitting the whiskey, and it still came out great. I used an immersion blender at the end because I like a smooth sauce. Great consistency and taste.

Excellent recipe!  I added some honey, cayenne & dry mustard.  I increased the chili sauce to around 8 oz and decreased the vinegar to around 3 Tblsp.  I roasted my roast the day before in the oven, put it and the sauce in the a crockpot in the fridge overnight.  Then just heated it up the next day before serving.  I received tons of praise the first time I made it!

I've put this on Sarge's EZ pulled pork (from this site) and baked chicken legs.  I used Maker's Mark and a full teaspoon of Yucateco habanero sauce.  I also cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 cup.  Next time I will use a less expensive, but still tasty bourbon (Old Crow?)  I think, if you like the taste of the bourbon as a drink, you will like the taste of the sauce.

This sauce is the best I have ever tasted.  I did put the onions in a processor and mince them as much as I could.  I accidentally added 2 tablespoons of butter because I was going to saute the onions and garlic (because I was multitasking at the time haha), but promptly added Jack Daniels and simmered for 20 minutes.  I then cut the liquid smoke in half and I added just a little more brown sugar.  When I first tasted it I didn't think it was worth the time and expense because it tasted like the JD bottled sauce, but then I simmered it for an hour.  It got better tasting as time went on.  It is just a great sauce and truly is the best I have tasted.

This was an excellent sauce for ribs. I made baby back ribs for a bbq for about 30 people, and they couldn't stop talking about the ribs and how good they were. This is a keeper and will definitely make it again!

This is pretty tasty stuff and excellent over shredded pork, but it doesn't seem drastically different from the Jack Daniels or Jim Beam sauce at the grocery store.  I'd make it in a double batch next time so I can freeze the leftovers.

Thanks for this excellent recipe.  I've been looking for a good BBQ sauce for a long time, and I think I finally found it.  I added a little more kick to the recipe with some habanero sauce, but the base was absolutely amazing.

wow...this sauce is excellent. i looked at the previos reviews before deciding to use this recipe. someone mentioned that they didnt change it at all, so i figured i would try it as the recipe is written (something i NEVER do).
i am really impressed with this sauce...perhaps next time i will tweak it a bit, not because it needs it thought.

I was wary of putting booze on a hot burner...didn't want a flare up so I browned the onions a bit then added everything together. Worked fine. I added a few minced jalepenos I had on hand.  Pretty good.  Will make again. Oh, I left out the liquid smoke.

This is terrific.  I have used it to grill hamburgers and steaks with extra sauce offered on the side.  Have also poured it over a roast in the crock pot with excellent results. No changes!

I absolutely love this recipe.  We are BBQ'ng tomarrow but I tested it out...Awesome!!  I used chipotle hot sauce with it and it gave it just the right kick and just alittle tang.  I strained it also.  My hubby doesn't like onions floating all around.  I'm sure the flavor will be great after it's blended for a day!!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

All I can say is WOW! Being from the South, I've had just about every BBQ sauce known.  This one had a flavor that just kind of hit the tastebud spot.  I imagine posters who were less than thrilled with it have a particular taste they go for in BBQ sauce (like a vinegar-y sauce or something) and this just wasn't that taste.  For me, this is THE taste. Note, though, that if you use a good whiskey (like Crown), this AIN'T cheap to make, the only reason I gave 4 * instead of 5*, but perhaps that's unfair.

Very good recipe.  I didn't have any liquid smoke, so I used real maple syrup instead.

Wow!  This stuff is good.  I used Jack Daniels and another poster is right that you might want to open a window or put on your stove fan during the initial cooking process.  I tasted it right after it was cooked and it was awesome.

A fantastic recipe. I took people's advice and let it sit in the refrigerator two days before serving it with pulled pork sandwiches. It was amazing. Open your windows when you cook it though, boiling bourbon doesn't smell too good - but the end result is well worth it!

Delicious! Left out the liquid smoke because we detest it. Cut the onion into wedges and removed after cooking, also added onion powder. Used Knob Creek because that is what we had on had.

I discovered that it matters which Bourbon you use as each has its own taste.  I really like Knob Creek as it gives the sauce a smooth flavor.

Straining is messy and difficult so I cut the onion into wedges and pick out.

My family has converted and will never buy BBQ sauce again.  Thanks Kevin!

This recipe is just like my mom used to make only with a great kick from the bourbon.  Rave reviews from friends and family. I followed directions exactly, only with a few extra cloves of garlic, and it turned out great! Thanks!

I used onion powder (I don't care for chunks in my sauce), rum after everyone said how bad their house smelled, cut down the liquid smoke, and added cayenne pepper. Absolutely the best sauce! I used it on beef, but I'm trying it again this weekend on pork. Thanks, Kevin! It's a keeper.

I have never made homemade BBQ sauce before and it was wonderful. It was good the day of, but much better the next day. I let it cook too long and it reduced a little too much, but I just added water to thin it to a proper consistancy.

This sauce recipe is fantastic and I will make it over and over.  I made two changes.  I didn't add the Hot Sauce and I *did* add about a tablespoon and a half of honey.  The recipe says to let the flavors blend overnight.  GOOD LUCK.  This smelled and tasted so good in the pan, and I had to cook up some ribs and eat it right away!

I added crushed red pepper and substituted 1tb soy sauce for the liquid smoke.  This was better than any store bought sauce.  I used it on pulled pork added some more vinegar and had the best BBQ sandwich I've had since I lived in Virginia.  My boyfriend can't wait to try it on some ribs.

This is a great recipe. This is my 3rd time making it. I've added a bit more brown sugar and doubled the hot sauce and more onions and garlic.
A recipe is a general guide and this recipe is fantasic place to srart. You've got to try it.

After finishing this marinade I could keep from dipping my fingers into it to taste it. The aroma is intoxicating too. Had a hard time covering it up to marinade, because I didn't want to miss out on the smell. The flavor after cooking was great too. Will make this again.

This sauce is perfect for ribs.  It really does improve the flavor to let it sit in the fridge for a couple of days, however I couldn't keep from eating it immediately, it was so good!

This sauce came out great even though I left out the tomato paste because I didn't have any.  The only other change I did make was I added 2 1/2 teaspoons of hot sauce rather than only 1/2 a teaspoon.  Other wise this sauce came out great and was very simple to make

Had fun making this sauce 'cause the onions and garlic simmering in the bourbon got the kitchen off to a great start!  Placed it on ribs after the ribs were in the BBQ smoker for 4 hours...very, very nice finishing touch.

AT LAST!  MY kinda barbecue sauce!  
Great just as is, but on two seperate occasions, 
I added my own touch  For catfish, I sprinkled
some Cajun seasoning on each side at the 
last minute... and for nasty stuff to BBQ 
horsemeat, use dark Tequila, then dust with
taco seasoning at last minute.  (actually, horsemeat
no common, so I use buffalo or black Angus)

This sauce was great and easy to make! I subbed honeycrisp apple juice for bourbon because whiskey is no good for me, and I forgot to get the tomato paste. Otherwise, made it exactly the same. It's great! Thank you so much!

I was a little nervous about all the worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke, but this turned out tasting so good! The only change I made was leaving out the salt. **One tip, don't adjust sugar until it's had a chance to cook thoroughly. This sauce mellows with cooking time.

Excellent favor! Never buying another bottled sauce again. (Followed recipe as written, with the exception of liquid smoke. Never bought it before, but I’m definitely inspired to try it next time!)

this sauce was  absolutely WONDERFUL!  Definitely let it sit in fridge for a day or 2.  Also, no need to buy an expensive bottle of booze. Tastes great with any priced bottle.

Made this with Woodford Reserve bourbon. It could’ve used some more heat. Used tomato sauce from a can instead of ketchup to make it less sweet. Honey can be used for a honey flavor instead of brown sugar sweetness. I’m going to try it with different whiskey to see if I can get a different flavor. Rye whiskey like Sazerac might give a spicier rye flavor. Peaty scotch like Ardbeg could lend a peat smoke flavor. Texas single malt could give a mesquite smoke. I’m going to try them all, but Woodford or another bourbon is definitely good. I’ve had it on both beef and pork and I liked it a lot on both.

Excellent Sauce!  I made it exactly as the recipe states and used Jim Beam Bourbon Whiskey.  Beats any store bought sauce by miles.  I made this and used it as a base for my brisket sauce.  My guests over Thanksgiving absolutely raved about it (both the sauce on it's own and the brisket sauce).  I am about to make a huge batch to jar and give as gifts.
Thanks for this great recipe.

Unbelievable. I used this sauce for a BBQ competition. The whiskey of choice was Nob Creek since rye whiskeys pair well with fatty meats. 

Received a lot of positive feedback. I have several requests to make this for others. I will be making this again.

Hands down the best BBQ sauce I’ve ever had!  Do NOT variate from the recipe cause you’ll be changing perfection. It really is the best after letting it sit a day or two!  THANK YOU FOR SHARING. I would’ve paid for this one!

This was great!  Not sure on any of the complaints about too much bourbon.  Didn't have that issue at all.  I didn't blend it so there were small onion pieces in it.  Guests liked it too.  I will tweak it a little, next time.  Maybe some more heat.  I didn't have hot sauce so I threw in a little cayenne.   Not enough though.  Tasted great.

This is a fantastic sauce, I did use my vita mix after the simmering was done to really incorporate the onions and garlic then I thinned it back down with a little apple juice and it was amazing, the best I’ve ever made.

Omitted the bourbon and it was still AWESOME! Served it for a crowd on two different occasions with pulled pork (scaled the recipe 4 and 5 times, respectfully) and received raved reviews and multiple requests for the recipe.

Very nice flavour. I am looking forward to basting this on a nice good rack.
Strong flavours, brilliant colouring and good smelling.

Since my family and myself like it a little more tangy I added  some ground pepper.  The bourbon I used was Woodford Reserve. The sauce in its original form was very good. I just made it fantastic. Thanks to the author of course! lol

I made this and let it sit in the fridge in a couple of tupperware containers for over a week. Tastes amazing with chicken, a real highlight. I'm planning on adding it to a slow cooker to cook pork shoulder to make shredded pork for a party where I'll have shredded pork for tacos.

Tastes amazing. I plan to make more. I followed the recipe and I didn't strain anything.

BEST EVER!!! Can it get any BETTER?  Answer is YES...but only if you have patience, let it set in fridge for day or two per recipe. I've made many times and everyone one raves, including MIL my toughest critic. LOL! Really makes no difference using cheap or top shelf bourbon. ENJOY!

All I can say is O.M.G.  I love this recipe.  The only change I made is to saute the onions and garlic in 2 T. of butter before adding bourbon.  Beef and butter go together.  This will be my go to recipe from now on.  I think I'm going to can some for grilling this summer.

This was really good.  I made it exactly as stated.  I used it on ribs one night .  A few days later on pulled pork sandwiches.  I really liked that it wasn't heavy or gooey.  
Yummy!

We love this. Made it last night for a cookout today. Wow. I'M with GMan108 - I'm lying to my friends and telling them this is my own!! We have some folks who love HOT - had jalapeno's and serrano's for them to add. This was perfect for everyone else as it. Even the little ones wanted to dip their hot dogs in it. Thanks for a great recipe which we will make often. YUM

I made this and all in all it's good but I did find it too tangy for my tastes and had to add some butter to help balance it out. I also added chipotle chilies to deepen it a bit. I made a big batch so it is a great "go to starter" but I would have liked a deeper Whisky flavor and a tad less tang.

Great bbq sauce! I halved it and used it on five oven-baked chicken drumsticks. I have a little leftover that I'll use in beans or as dipping sauce for nuggets. I also only simmered it for 10 min, and I liked the thick texture of it. It was a little tart for my taste, so I added extra brown sugar. The next time, I'd try cutting back on the vinegar. It's so easy to make, and has all good ingredients. So much better than some of the bottled stuff out there. Will make again! Thanks for the recipe, Kevin!

I have made this over and over. It is a hit every time.  I tweak it each time to our tastes as we like a little more spice. I  freeze half and thaw when I need it. It works very well this way.

I used tomato paste completely instead of ketchup and added more sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and vinegar to make up for the difference. It tastes amazing!

Made as directed. My grandson was aghast when he saw me using a fine bourbon. He was singing a different tune after he tasted this awesome sauce. I am not a fan of barbecue sauce but my family is. They raved!!

I am not a big bbq fan but really like this.  I cut the bourbon to 2/3 cup and the smoke to 1-1/4 teaspoon and found that we like it better.  Have made several times and will more again.  5 stars all the way

No changes.....I have made several BBQ sauces and tried several over the counter sauces and this one is truly amazing!  It is definitely my fiancée's and my favorite and I will be using this for my pulled pork and ribs from now on.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!!!

I have made this twice so far and it is flipping delicious! I followed it the first time *( a tad less dark brown sugar and a tad more hot sauce) but the second time I used light brown sugar and even more hot sauce...I chopped the onions and just left them in for texture. The sauce is pretty thick but that's fine with me! Thank you so much for sharing!

I've made this sauce about 6 times.  Last time was the charm to get it just right for my taste buds.  Finding the right whiskey is the hard part.  I tried Rebel Yell, Henry McKenna Bottled in Bond (then it won best whiskey in 2019 so that's out), Buffalo Trace and even some High West Bourye.  I tried all of those with Hunts All Natural ketchup.  None of them really had the taste I wanted.  Wasted a lot of good bourbon.  Last batch was the bees knees though.  Used Evan Williams Bottled in Bond with regular old Heinz ketchup.  Man oh man did it come out tasty.  Used just 1/3 of a teaspoon of Franks Hot Sauce.  I am going to stick to those ingredients going forward.  I simmered it for a good 3 hours as well.

Oh my goodness!!! Smoked a 17 lb. Brisket and this sauce knocked it out of the park! I used a peach pecan whiskey and a peach hotsauce, which took it to another level.
I do not know who do would not like this recipe.

Left out the onion and used garlic powder instead of cloves. This recipe is amazing and I now have requests from friends for a batch of this! Gave it as a gift in a decorated mason jar. Thank you!!

Wow, is this good.  I'll never buy commercial BBQ sauce again.  I even made it vegan by using a vegan Worcestershire sauce.  I did not strain it because I liked the little bit of texture that the onion and garlic bits provided.  Easy and delicious.

I used Demerara brown sugar and added some buckwheat honey after tasting it to see how that would change things. I also tried adding some celery salt adding seeing how that worked out. I doubled the recipe as I didn't want to waste half the can of tomato paste although I am sure I could have easily just used the whole can for the regular recipe without issue. For smoke, I used hickory, it just about cleaned me out of hickory liquid smoke but mesquite isn't as versatile in my opinion. As for hot sauce, I opted for chipotle chili pepper rather than a premade sauce as I didn't want to influence the flavours and didn't feel like tasting the recipe with every hot sauce in my cupboard. My onion and garlic chunks are bigger than I would like for my use case but rather than straining it I plan to blend it to minimize the chunks without losing flavour or all the texture. Also, I used multicolour peppercorns rather than just black, they are more fun.

Bbq sauce, where have you been all of my life? I’ve been searching for a recipe that is “restaurant style”. I have found it!!! I doubled it and it’s nearly gone anyway. I didn’t change a thing! This is straight up perfection.

This was delicious.  We did opt to leave out the hot pepper sauce and, while doing a taste test while simmering, we added an extra 1/4 cup of brown sugar and approx 1 tsp molasses. 
Instead of using liquid smoke we put the pot of sauce directly on the smoker for the last 20 minutes or so of simmering.

This was the best BBQ sauce I've ever made! Unfortunately I only got to have 2 ribs (from a full rack!) because everyone was chowing down on them while I was cooking other things.
Next time I make it, I'm going to double up the recipe and can the other half.

I like this recipe but  it has a ketchupy flavor.  Decreasing the tomato paste to 2-3 tbs may help.  I also felt like I couldn't taste the Whiskey, so, I added more.   I also needed to add some celery seed, cinnamon, and paprika.

Outstanding recipe! My new favorite bbq sauce! Very easy to make. We ran out of store bought sauce when we had ribs and I made this sauce to finish out the meat. Makes enough to store in a big mason jar.

I would suggest sauteing the onions, garlic and tomato paste before adding the bourbon.  It increases the depth of flavor and takes out some of the strong alcohol flavor.  otherwise, this is my go to sauce.  Excellent on pulled pork.

I am on a cardiac diet, so I'm low-salt, low fat. With a few substitutions this is an incredible BBQ sauce for me. I use no-salt ketchup, honey instead of sugar, and ceyenne pepper instead of hot sauce. Delicious! And I know several people that have no dietary restrictions that prefer this over any other BBQ sauce. Thank you!

This sauce was very good, some of the best I have had.  I was a little more liberal with my hot sauce (peri peri) as I like things spicy.  Will make again for sure.

The smokiness of the bourbon really comes through.  Served it with Tri tip and chicken.  Rave reviews from all visiting for dinner!  Made as instructed.  No changed necessary.  I was suspicious when said to cook onions and bourbon at same time.  Just do it!

I sautéed the garlic and onions in 3 tbsp of butter then added the bourbon just to add a little creaminess to the sauce. Regardless of what I did, the sauce is superb. Will definitely be making this a mainstay in my fridge.

Loved it!  I had a few changes though- tomato sauce instead of paste, onion powder instead of fresh onion, a little more garlic, some cinnamon for tame heat instead of hot sauce, and corn starch to thicken.  Only drawback is I didn't make enough!  Update:  don't use molasses for brown sugar - not sweet enough.

I made this recipe exactly as written except I didn't have any liquid smoke.  I was great!  I read that it taste's even better after a couple of days, so I can't wait to try it on something else.  It's a keeper!

I made this exactly as written and it came out great!  It's in the fridge now to let the flavors blend as directed.  It has a great aftertaste that stays on the tongue.  When it I make it again I'll cut back on the vinegar just a touch.

Yes to changes added some honey for a bit more sweetness.  I thought it had a tad too much vinegar so next time I would cut that down to 1/4c. Look forward to making it again.

This is hands down the best BBQ sauce I have made. It is the only I use now. A perfect blend of sweet, tart and spice although I often add more spice. Works with any kind of whiskey, whatever I have and perfect on ribs, chicken wings, other chicken, pork chops and burgers.

I made exactly as written except added 2 Tbsp merlot and topped off bourbon to 3/4 cup. I also replaced the hot sauce with cayanne pepper powder (equal measure).  instead of mincing the onion and garlic, I put it in a bullet blender wit the liquor and ground it well. I am too lazy to strain it later. Very tasty. I don't like very spicy food and this was just right for me.    (little bite is good) We multiplied by 4 and canned it. It made 6 pints. It tastes very much better than any you can buy.

Loved it! I left out the liquid smoke and used smoked paprika, red pepper flakes, and a bit of cayenne. Came out spicy, but let it set in the fridge overnight and used it for some root beer pulled pork the next day it mellowed right out.

I used Jim Beam apple bourbon.  I ended up adding about another 1/8 cup to get some of the flavor to poke through, otherwise the sauce was a bit ketchuppy to me.  I minced my onions and garlic so fine that there wasn't a need to strain them out; I quite liked them in there.  I was out of Worcester and have no liquid smoke, so I used A1 as a sub for both and the sauce still came out yummy, though probably different than the original version.  Last note: this makes a lot of sauce so have a jar ready.

This recipe is freekin' fantastic.  Been smoking ribs for 5-6 years with a WSM so I think I know a thing or two about ribs and sauces. Let me say I am NOT a fan of  liquid smoke. Having said that, I don't particularly like smoking in the middle of snow storm. Doing my B.B.'s in the oven I needed some smoke so I broke down and got a bottle.

This sauce is wonderful. I used the 2T of smoke as required. I also added 1T of molasses. Used Frank's Red Hot (glug glug--maybe a tablespoon).

I used Canadian Club Rye (you could also use dark rum--which is another of my favourite recipe additions).

This recipe is a winner. Make half a batch if you're unsure (but you'll regret it if you do).

Can't say enough good things about this recipe.

Even at 5 stars, this is the most underrated recipe on this site. If you plan to make BBQ shredded chicken, at least double the recipe. In fact, always at least double it. It'll go quick and it keeps forever, and just gets better and better. If you make it, make it at least a day, preferably 3+ days in advance. When it's first made the flavors haven't blended properly and it tastes a little funny. After a day, though...WOW!

The only change I made was to only use 1/2 a tablespoon of liquid smoke. I'm putting this on meat that I'm smoking, so too much smoke is just overkill. Otherwise, absolutely outstanding!

Methinks I'll never, ever, buy another bottle of bbq sauce again. Just plan ahead because it needs to sit in your fridge a few days to marry the flavors.

Amazing!
First I tasted it, when it was still hot. I thought, OUHH heavy whiskey taste.
Then I tasted it, when it was cold. The whiskey taste stays in the background and the sauce gets a very good sweet and smoky taste.
Very good recipe, thank you for the recipe.

Used peach whisky because it's all I had.  Everything else I used was exactly as the recipe called for.  Sooooooo good. My husband said it was the best.

I couldn't taste the Bourbon in the sauce, and it was a little too sweet for my taste.
Is still a very good recipe and the end result was a really good tasting BBQ. Next time I'll try using more Bourbon and a little bit less sugar.

Love this recipe.  The liquid smoke that I had on hand was Hickory.  I would like to try it with a different flavour.  I will definitely be making more!

Absolutely delicious. I made this sauce and put it in the frig for 2 days, then used it on smoked ribs, they where great. But this bbq sauce recipe is a knock off of JACK DANIELS BBQ SAUCE. It taste the same,  but it will  cost more to make then to buy it.

I hate when reviewers rate a recipe based on their variations. I think the recipe should be rated as written. If you want to submit a different recipe with your variations, then go for it. This recipe is perfect as written. I didn't change a thing. It was delicious and got rave reviews from the family. Will definitely make it again.

This is the best whiskey BBQ sauce recipe I have ever tried. It is fantastic! Nothing needs changed. The only time it should be altered is for heat. If you are like me, and want to add a kick to everything, forgo the hot sauce. Instead mince the hot pepper of your choice and add it to the first step. I use 2-3 habaneros. It cooks down and the alcohol cuts the oil nicely, turning the nuclear heat into a decent mild burn. That said the onion / garlic can be increased if needed for preference as well. But hands down this recipe is PHENOMENAL by itself with NO changes.

Love this BBQ sauce. only thing I did different I added celery seeds. I seem to prefer BBQ sauce with celery seed. I put it in my blender to make it smooth, be careful when blending I put a towel over the lid to hold down. Thanks

My husband is picky when it comes to BBQ sauce and he thought this was absolutely amazing.  Even my picky 10 year old daughter loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't have 2 cups of Ketchup so I only used 1 1/2 and it came out great.  I used this BBQ sauce for another recipe on here "Zesty slow cooker chicken barbecue" and it was awesome.

I've made this a few times and always a hit. I work next door to a restaurant that is known across the southeast portion of the state for their barbecue and co workers all agreed that this was better than their sauce. 
The first time making, I followed recipe to the letter and it was good. The second time I made it, I eyeballed much of it except the bourbon.  It came out fantastic.

Made this for xmas as a gift and it was yummy!  I struggled with how to store it for the gifts. Now, I am being requested to make this for a wedding as little favors.  I have questions on how to best store this and the expiration date.  The bride wants 225 favors! Ouch! Also, it states the servings are for 16...is that 16 4oz? 2oz? How much is per serving? If anyone can PLEASE DIRECT ME on the BEST way to store that would be FANTASTIC!

Absolutely amazing, my husband made so many sauce recipes leading up to this Easter weekend and this by far stands out! All the trials stopped here with this one...we've got 20 lbs of pork to smoke starting Saturday night and this sauce is definitely going to do it justice!

I tried this recipe as written with the exception of the bourbon, I used honey bourbon. Everyone that got some raved about it and now, friends and co-workers want more to take home. Try it, tweak it, make it your own!

Made it 2 days before my football party that I made with pulled chicken and topped with slaw on ciabatta. It was outstanding!! Next time though I will just give the  vegs a rough chop instead of finely mincing since I will strain, big time saver since I doubled the recipe. Just wondering, how long will this keep in the fridge?

I normally do NOT like bbq sause but I Love this BBQ sauce. I have put it on chicken, pork and ribs. I will never buy store bought bbq sauce again. Kids and husband can not get enough of it. 
Every time my husband wants to BBQ he tells me few days in advance just in case I don't have any of this sauce. Thank you for sharing!!!

Don't use Ketsup instead i used 1 large can of Tomato puree.
Then add… 1/2 corn syrup, 1/4 Soy sauce 1 tsp of dry mustard, 1 tbsp of hot sauce, 1 tsp of bitters, 1 1/2 tsp salt. 

I also put in 1 tsp of Jalapeño powder. I also cooked it down until it was thick.

So good!  I did follow the advice of another review and just chopped the onion and garlic.   The ketchup I used had a lot of black pepper in it, so I didn't add any additional pepper.  I used the sauce on Chef John's pulled pork recipe.  Will definitely make this again and again.  Thanks Kevin!

I made this recipe times 8 and pressure canned it- at 11 pounds pressure for 15 minutes- made 21 pints. It is SO good! I added a bit extra bourbon, added 3/4 brown sugar and 1/4 honey and added a bit extra tabasco. This reminds me of a sweet-spicy Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce...SO GOOD!

I made this exactly as the recipe called for. I had tried this recipe from a commercial source and loved it. When I made it , it seemed to lose all the bourbon flavor, the vinegar came through strong and was not quite as sweet as I had tasted. I added some brown sugar and it did sweeten it up....duh !     Any suggestions are welcome. I am tempted to add bourbon last or when other ing. Are added. Feel free to contact me with and helpful hints because I loved the commercial one I tried.

I had never made my own BBQ sauce before. I will now. This stuff is out of this world.  My wife said that she could drink it straight.  And this praise comes from a family that doesn't cook outside. We grilled some steaks  inside and served them with some leftover Tater Tots from the freezer. At the end we were dipping the Tater Tots in the sauce. We used with chicken quarters in the slow cooker and finally, my wife put it on her hot dog. Notes: 1) I added an extra half handful of brown sugar.  2) Don't leave out the hot sauce. It adds a nice finishing zing to it.  3) Put it in the fridge overnight. It tastes better the next day.

i have made this sauce a dozen times.  I make it at the end of every summer in large quantity and can quarts to keep on the shelf.  It is very good as is, but I personalize it by adding grilled jalapenos and thai chiles for the heat component.

WOW! Truly easy and AMAZING! Best sauce ice ever tried, not just as a BBQ sauce! I can't wait to introduce it in tailgates! This is perfect in every way shape and form, the portions make the sauce one that is just right smokey, just right tangy and just an awesome kick . My family and friends loved it! they even put it on rice! wow

This BBQ sauce is so easy to make and so flavorful. It's the perfect mix of sweet, spicy, and smoky. It will pretty much go with anything. I always keep some on hand in the fridge.

This is a very good recipe.  I have 2 family members that don't like onion or garlic, so, I've said nothing and just run the sauce thru the blender.  They eat it like nothing else and call it great.  I'll never tell them they are eating onion and garlic.

Amazing sauce! I was afraid it would turn out poorly because I didn't have liquid smoke and I accidentally doubled the tomato paste. But it's still a winner!! I chose not to strain because I love onions and garlic, and I've never had slightly chunky bbq sauce before...it's still great!

I absolutely loved the recipe.  Leaving it in the fridge for a day or so did the trick as it really did taste better than when I made it.  Only change I made out of necessity was the chili powder.  Instead of chili powder, I used new mexico chili powder and BAM! it was really delicious.  It was my first time ever making a bbq sauce.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Thank you so much for a fab recipe...the only thing I changed was to reduce the sugar by half.
I love the recipes on this site, always so inventive. Being a Brit I find we don't have such a sweet tooth as in Americans.
it is so nice to have authentic American food recipes this side of the pond!
The sauce is amazing on sausages and chicken as well as ribs.

I made this sauce for a rehearsal dinner where I served BBQ brisket. Love this sauce! I don't think I'll be buying bottled BBQ sauce ever again!

I did a slight modification on this recipe, I used Jim Bean Honey Whiskey and made a double batch. To compensate for the sweetness in the whiskey I didn't double the sugar, the result was good but still had a stronger sour flavor then some of my friends cared for if I make it again I might cut the Worcestershire sauce a smidge. Overall I liked it and I think it will do great.

This is a great BBQ Sauce recipe.  I didn't change a thing.  I seen where one reviewer thought it had an over powering  bourbon taste....make sure you simmer the bourbon, Garlic and onion for ten minutes (as suggested) and you won't have that.

I didn't have bourbon, so I used rum, and I didn't have onions or garlic, so I used powdered of both.  IT WAS STILL AWESOME!!!  I can't wait to try it when I have the right stuff! Spicy, smokey, sweet, and delicious!

Making this in the crockpot for my beef short ribs.
i had to make a few changes, as I discovered I was out of a few ingredients.
Instead of liquid smoke, I used Kitchen Bouquet.
Instead of Worcesterire sauce, I used Hoisin sauce.
Instead of catsup, I used a 12oz can of tomato paste.
Used cheapest whiskey available.
I just mixed it all up, dumped it on the ribs and let it sit for two hours, before turning on the crockpot for 5 hours on low. Wow, the sauce is awesome. Ribs aren't cooked yet, and I'll update this after dinner, but this recipe is certainly a keeper. I can't imagine how much better it would be if I had the necessary ingredients!

Wonderful recipe!!  I made a few changes.  Used 1 c of ketchup and one 8 oz can tomato sauce.  I used apple cider vinegar and it was a little strong for my taste so will reduce to 1/4 c or even less next time.  Added a tbsp or two of molasses and a bit more brown sugar to balance the acidity.  Tip- grate the onion instead of dicing for a softer consistency (I use this technique for homemade spaghetti sauce too).   Will definitely use again.  Thanks for sharing!!

This is wonderful BBQ sauce! It is important to let it sit overnight as it is better after the flavors all blend. I very finely minced my onions, and left them in the sauce  and will continue to do it that way, no need to remove them. My family RAVED about it.

I can only  partially  taste  at this  time.... Sinus  infection.  4 friends  have  raved  over this. I served it  over  pulled  pork. So far all love it..even  over their  favorite  sauces
Still a crowd  favorite. I make this and another darker sauce all of the time I've  never had anyone  not like this. It's so easy and consistent.

I have since made this 4 or 5 more times...everyone loves it.  I now give it 5 stars since I can taste it.  
It is true that you can use the cheapest bourbon and it makes no difference.  I also add some smoked paprika and increase the hot sauce; I like a little kick
This turns  out great every single time!

Deliciously creative bbq sauce recipe!   While cooking the onions n garlic, i pureed all other ingredients in a blender...The only thing i swapped out was some fire roasted jalapenos instead of the hot sauce for dat extra smokiness. After the onions were done, i threw that in the blender too before returning it to heat. No strain necessary. Awesome recipe!

The sauce is very good. I cooked the ribs indoors a few different ways and found the best method was to follow the directions for Scott Hibb's baby back ribs (except broiling rather than grilling them at the end), putting this sauce on at the end.  Yum!

Recipe tastes great.  Smoked some ribs and used this sauce to finish them.  Turned out awesome despite no Liquid smoke.  I substituted it with smoke paprika which helped give some smokey flavor but I am sure  it's better with the liquid smoke

I absolutely love this recipe!  I add a little less liquid smoke, and replace it with dry mustard.  Make sure you cook the onions on med-high for a good 10 minutes to burn the alcohol off the Bourbon.  My husband will no longer eat bottled BBQ sauce, he begs me to make this every time.

Loved it!   The longer you let it set the better the taste. When we first tired it it was okay and that's because the flavor really had't married yet . It takes 2 to 3 weeks before it really gets it  a great taste to it

I omitted tomato paste but added a little extra ketchup(to finish off a bottle) and I used red wine vinegar instead of the cider. By far the best BBQ sauce I've ever had. It's so simple I'll never buy to from a store again

WOW! This sauce is amazing! I've never written a recipe review before but this was so good that I simply had to. The sauce isn't too tangy, not too sweet and doesn't have too much of a smoky flavored. I like it so much that I double the recipe and process it in Mason jars so I always have it on hand.

Pro-tip...strain the minced onions but save them to use as a burger topping.

Outstanding!

Made this now twice. After putting into jars I add 1/2 teaspoon  of whiskey to the top of the sauce its off to the hot water bath.  Store in cool area for about 2 weeks.  My family can't get enough of this.  We also find using a honey whiskey to be excellent.

Followed for the most part. 1/4 bourban,1/4 cup maple whiskey. (adds a great maple flavour). 2 tablespoons of honey. No tomato paste so used chili sauce.

This was really good. I found that after preparing it carefully as written the flavor lacked just a little depth so I added 1tsp of beef concentrate (or 1 beef cube) and 1Tbls of soy sauce. I like a smooth sauce so I blended it with an immersion blender for about a minute after cooling. Thanks for sharing

I skipped the whiskey and Worcestershire sauce ) I also substituted ketchup for tomato paste and added extra sugar and apple cider vinegar and some ground dry mustard(due to food allergies)

Never given a review or made BBQ sauce from scratch.  All the homemade BBQ sauces I've tasted were awful, too tangy, too sweet, too runny.....yadayadayada. I used all these ingredients without measuring much of anything.  THEE ENTIRE family fell in love with this BBQ sauce and six cups of the stuff was gone in less then a week! Just perfection.

Perfect blend of sassy and sweet. Was amazing with a bunch of pulled pork and cole slaw. Husband enjoyed the whisky fumes from the initial boiling. Wow.

This is, by far, the best BBQ sauce I have ever had!  I will never buy store-bought again.  The recipe as written makes enough for about 3 separate BBQ dinners.  I made 2 racks of ribs last week with it, made BBQ chicken with it this week and will use the rest on pork very soon. I'm telling you, it's so good, you will stand over the pot and eat it by the spoonful.

I might have added a bit too much vinegar or something because it was really tangy. I wouldn't make this BBQ sauce again, but it was really fun trying it out.

I really liked this sauce.  I didn't mind the chunks in the sauce like some people.  It has a nice tart and sweetness to it.  Next time, I might put just a tad less vinegar in it though.

It was easy enough to make, and tasted very good, but not so superior to a good commercial brand that I would bother again. It sure made the house smell good they day I cooked it!

Easy to make and followed the recipe exactly but used Canadian Rye. The only difference is we didn't strain it for we like our sauce chunky. We couldn't wait the couple of days so we had it on left over breaded beef cutlets. Took Texas Toast and made sandwiches with the BBQ Sauce on the cutlets and it was outstanding!

Fantastic sauce!!  I substituted Orange Cognac instead of using my good sipping Whiskey and it was delicious.  Tangy, sweet with a little heat right at the end that makes you want another bite.  I also cut the Liquid smoke to 1 TBS and ran it through a strainer instead of blending.  Thank you for this recipe!  -Adam

I use this recipe all the time and we love it! Try adding 4-5 slices of crispy bacon....if you don't like it too chunky, an immersion blender does the trick! We use it on everything ??

We have made this BBQ sauce several times and it has always been amazing. The last time we used our immersion blender and just blended the onions into the sauce instead of straining them out and it turned out AMAZING! I highly recommend this recipe!

It's a great sauce, made just as it is written in the recipe, but I found it just a little bit too "ketchupy".  The second time I made it I scaled back the ketchup a little bit and added a little more cider vinegar and worcestershire sauce, and that made it perfect.

Love this, did what other ppl suggested. Scaled back the bourbon to 1/4 cup , used 1tbs of the liquid smoke. It was fantastic. I am a super picky bbq sauce person. i found the flavors amazing. Perfect for slow cooker pulled pork.

This BBQ sauce is AWESOME with pulled pork.  Even my picky 13 year old son loved it!  I cut the onion in half and kept the garlic cloves whole to be able to remove them easily.  I simmered the sauce longer to let the flavors blend.  Definitely a keeper!

5++++++  Who knew Whiskey could be so delicious with ketchup instead of Coke! YUMMY!!! I did add the hot sauce because my husband and I enjoy spicy. If you're not one for spice, omit it & whoever wants can add it after. Will be making this again and again FOR SURE!! Thank you!!

The alcohol overpowered the sauce, despite cooking off the actual alcohol.   I am a seasoned cook and would not make this again.  Very disappointing.

We love this sauce.  I usually make a double recipe and use it on pulled pork, but it would be great on any BBQ.  I have made it as written, and I also have added a bit of Tequila (part bourbon part tequila) and smoked paprika and it came out great with a bit more depth.  Either way, you will love it!

Great recipe.  Agree with an earlier reviewer about the quality of bourbon. You don't need to go top-shelf with this.  I use Old Crow (also happens to be my daily drinking bourbon) and it works fine.  I have substituted turbinado sugar for brown sugar.  It seem to give the sauce a bit deeper flavor.  I also use a hand-held immersion blender to keep the garlic and onions in the sauce rather than removing them.

Made this recipe tonight with my first attempt at smoking a pork butt and some ribs. This sauce is incredible!!!! A tad sweet for my taste as I found I like the Carolina style sauce, but, my family would have made drinks with the sauce had it not been a social faux pas!!! 
Thanks to whoever created and posted this incredibly delicious sauce!!

I really love this recipe.  It is easy to make - all-in around 45 minutes and most of that time I was spent watching TV :-).  It obviously is heavily biased towards the Tomato taste, but delicious none-the-less. I sieved it to get a smooth finish but this took a wee while. I don't use this for Marinades etc for the BBQ,  but more of a great condiment to replace the  you get in the supermarket. It goes great with virtually I eat. Steak and Chips yummy.  I had to adapt it slightly to the New Zealand items which are available.

For the Kiwis reading : the Tomato Ketchup was tins of Watties, liquid smoke I used was 100% Natural Manuka Smoke Concentrate - about 4 sprays but will probably play with the amount when I make it next, Tomato paste was a tubed concentrate bought from the supermarket.  The Bourbon was just a really cheap version from Liquor King as it was quite expensive to buy the quality stuff.  Other reviews pointed out that it didn't really matter, so I figured try the cheapest first and head North if things turn out good.  Which they did, so try it!

I love this sauce and have made it many times.  If I'm in a hurry I use 1/2 Tbs powdered garlic and 1 Tbs powered onion instead of the fresh.  Then all you have to do is throw everying in the pot, no chopping or straining.  If you like less tomato flavor omit the tomato paste. This is a great sauce even when you "cheat".

Made this sauce last year for Father's day. I canned half and used half after letting it sit a couple of days. The half I used after a couple of days had a strong vinegar/katchup flavor. It was ok, but I and my family weren't impressed. The half I canned, I forgot about until this last January when I was making pulled pork. I forgot to make sauce so pulled this out and uncorked it. All I have to say is, this is some of the best sauce I've ever had, hands down. If you make this, have patience and let it mellow. You will be very happy.

My go to sauce everytime. I add some dried red chili flakes for a bit of heat, nothing else. This recipe fills an empty 64oz. ketchup bottle perfectly. Widen the hole a bit to let the chunks out. Bottled sauce has it's place though. Sittin' on the shelf!!

All I can say is WOW! This recipe is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I tried another recipe prior to this, and it was a complete failure. Taste was aweful, and didn't even look like BBQ sauce. This recipe, however, is awesome! Beats any kind of store bought. I made it this morning, and I'm giving it to family as a Christmas gift. I'm sure they will love it as well!

Awesome sauce!  Tried it for the first time with some pulled chicken in the crock pot.  Recipe says it makes 4 cups, but I ended up with less than 3 cups.  Made the sauce the night before; added it to the slow cooker with the frozen pulled chicken the next day.  Let it cook on low for 4-5 hours.  I wish I would have had just a little bit more sauce - but it was delicious (I had pulled chicken from 6 chicken breasts).  Definitely will be making this sauce often!

This has definitely become the ONLY BBQ suace that I make and use (no more store bought stuff!).  I still follow the recipe and love how it tastes.  If anyone has kept it in the fridge for extended periods of time please let me know.  I want to make a big batch so I always have it on hand.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Excellent flavor!  Tastes just like I want my BBQ to taste ~ a little sweet, a little smokey, and a little spicey.

Ran out and bought a bottle of bourbon just for this recipe.  Had it on chicken and ribs.  After reading the reviews I expected the sauce to be a knockout, but we were disappointed.  Just a couple of tads better than the bottled stuff at the market and that was after adding more heat to it.

You know bbq sauce is truly good when you can eat it by itself. Little high on the salt for me. But I cant stand sweet sauce or vinegry sauce and this is a perfect blend. Instead of straining to get the chunks out I recommend using a blender on the solids. This will make the onions and garlic small enough that straining is not needed.  Thank you so much for posting this. My uncle made something very similar to this when I was young. Brought back memories.

Simply incredible. It was quite expensive to make though, heavily due to the bottle of Jack Daniels. Well, at least here in Ontario it was expensive...

I doubled this recipe and made it last night. I didn't have enough Worcestershire sauce and left out the hot sauce. I used this on the Slow Cooker Pulled Pork from this site. The double batch was perfect for a 5lb. pork loin, just enough. I was glad I made the sauce the night before. As good as it was the night before, it was AMAZING today. Best BBQ sauce I've ever made at home. Like another reviewer, I used cheap whiskey and it didn't really seem to matter. My picky-eater husband loved this, too. The pulled pork is definitely going on our menu rotation and this is the only sauce I'll make for it! Y-U-M!!!

This sauce is awesome.  I don't use the onion chunks, I either finely chop or grate the onion because I like the flavor.  I've made this multiple times, have even had to alter slightly because I didn't have all the ingredients, but delicious every time.  I've even thrown all the ingredients in a slow cooker with either beef or pork to make pulled sandwiches, and it's STILL the best.  Highly recommend this recipe.

This is the best BBQ sauce ever!! It is very simple and just enough kick. I like to keep the onions large so I can strain them out for a smooth sauce. I also use 1/4 cup white wine vinegar instead of the 1/3 cup cider vinegar it calls for because it seemed overpowering. That was the tweak it needed! It goes breat on ribs.

OMG. This sauce is awesome! I just made my first batch (doubled recipe) and I have it simmering. I can't keep a spoon out of it. It is that good. 
I will be making boston butts next weekend and I can't wait to use this sauce on the shredded pork.
I used my old friend "Jack" and he didn't let me down.

First of all, amazing sauce!  As some reviews suggested, I decided to wedge the onion to make straining easier.  If you do the same, you may want to set the onion aside afterward for burger toppings.  Very tasty.

I followed the recipe EXACTLY and it turned out simply AMAZING!  Put it in mason jars in the refrigerator and using it for a grilled pork tenderloin tomorrow.  This was so easy and so good.  The perfect combo of sweet and spicy.  Highly recommend!

This sounds almost to a T the bbq sauce I make at home. The only thing that is different is that I add 3/4 cup molasses to it and use JD. Comes out awesome, nice rich colour with the molasses.

Hubby made this sauce last night and let it sit in the fridge over night to mellow out.  We used some to  charcoal-grill some chicken legs and thighs tonight for supper, with extra sauce to smother it with afterwards :)  I absolutely HATE bourbon whiskey, but I absolutely LOVED this sauce!!!  5 stars cooked just the way the recipe calls for.  My compliments to the creator :)

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this Sauce! It is now regularly made in my house! I've taken the liberty to make different variations - depending on my mood!  To the original recipe I've added 2 heaping TBS of Apricot Preserves and 1 tsp or so of cayenne pepper! This added a little more complexity and yumminess! Another one:  I give the sauce 2 generous TBS of Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce - OMG! I LOVE this recipe! Thank you Kevin !

Delicious!!! The whole family loved this sauce. First time I strained out the onions and garlic after cooking, the second time I kept them in and it's still as delicious!

I have made a few bbq sauces from other peoples recipes. Usually they are average at best. But this bbq sauce is better then just about any other sauce I have tasted. I served it with a Boston Butt (pulled pork) I smoked for 13 hours. Everybody loved the sauce. This is easy to make and everyone will love it. Cant miss bbq sauce

Great sauce.  Very tangy at first, but I let it set a day in the fridge like others suggested and it turned out perfect.

this is heavenly! i followed the recipe exactly, it was so easy! the house smelled amazing all day! just like everybody is saying at first it tastes very tangy but after it sits for a day the flavors blend together.  the only thing i will change is add more hot pepper sauce but that's only because of preference. other than that PERFECT as is!

I love this sauce... we live in Albania where you can NOT buy anything that even resembles BBQ sauce and this has been a BIG lifesaver for my family.  I make hug batches and freeze half.  It is amazing!  THANK YOU!

Fantastic taste.  Used on the Oven Barbecued Beef Brisket I from this site.  I made the sauce with Jim Beam and mesquite-flavored liquid smoke.  My husband wants to try it on chicken before deciding if it's really better than Sweet Baby Ray's, though I'm already sold on it.

A friend of mine, who is from memphis, commented on how great this was, and that it compared favorably to authentic memphis BBQ sauce, which I guess is a good thing.  I modified it by:  -2x the hot sauce, half of which was chili sauce -Cut the amount of liquid smoke -very slightly increased amount of cider -very slightly decreased the amount of sugar -increased amount of garlic  I also BLENDED the sauce after simmering for close to an hour, to get smoothness and integrate the garlic/onion.  it's VERY NECESSARY to let it rest/mellow in the fridge overnight to get the best flavor.  Great recipe!

Wow!  The best barbeque sauce that you can get on or off the shelf or even from a restaurant that claims to be BBQ.  We followed other's advice and got cheap bourbon and reduced the sugar and we were still licking our fingers for days.

Wasn't impressed with this sauce. It was good, but didn't knock my socks off. Maybe I will let it sit a day and try it again? I used expensive bourbon that I had and now I wish I wouldn't have wasted it!

What a great recipe!!  I'm making it again today.  Last time I did, we were at the Air Show...we had already filled up on burgers and hot dogs, but I still made the chicken thighs using this recipe...People that we didn't know came up to me and asked me to try the chicken.  I was offered money for the chicken and for the recipe....that said something to me...now this time, I'll actually (hopefully) have a chance to try it!  :)

Great sauce - only complaint from me is that it was a little sweet for my taste. When I do it again (which I will for sure)I'll cut out the sugar - I reckon ketchup has enough in it to hold it together.

This sauce is wonderful.  I added more hot sauce and apple cider vingear than the recipe called for.  I didn't measure how much more, I just added until the sauce had the right bite for my family.  This is a keeper.  Thank you!!!

Amazing BBQ Sauce and I don't LIKE BBQ Sauce! The only changes I made were omitting the brown sugar, as we don't like "sweet sauce" and I used a Tbsp. of ground smoked chipotle seasoning instead of the liquid smoke. The first time I made it I didn't care for the vinegar taste and so have omitted that too. I just throw it all together and let it cook very low in a saucepan for a couple of hours. Outstanding!

Very tasty, though I had to add quite a bit more brown sugar for my taste.  Was excellent on shredded beef.

If I have the time to make that sauce, I will never buy bottled BBQ sauce again.  This sauce is really good.  We like it spicy so I added some Sambal Oelek in it.  It's a keeper

I doubled this recipe, used a whole onion and used Jack Daniels(only the best would do) My family now bugs for it.  No more Diana's at our house.  As my Stepson says, Its Dana's, not Diana's that is the best.

Good sauce, but a little on the sweet side for our taste.  I may add some more vinegar next time or cut back a little on the brown sugar.  Loved the smokey element of the bourbon.  I served it with Barbecued Shredded Beef, also from this site.  Great combination.

This was excellent sauce. I am a fan of spicier sauces so I kicked up the amount Chouloula I used to 1 TBSP and added red pepper flakes. I let it sit for 2 days and then made Amazing Ribs from this site. Great combo.

I thought this was great but just a pinch too sweet for my taste. I'll decrease the brown sugar next time. I made this in the crock pot with chicken breasts I shredded for sandwiches. Awesome! Can't wait to try with pork and beef.

I made this as stated only I didn't have bourbon whisky so just used my DH's Scots Blend.  While it was boiling we both leaned over and took a big sniff and nearly cried. It burns your sinuses something wicked.  It is amazing and have the most wonderful sauce that goes with anything.  I have kept it now for three weeks in the fridge and it's still fine. Nice one for bottling for Christmas! I'm sure that my family would appreciate it.

Nice one buddie- I have amazed people with this BBQ sce recipe. Insted of the Liquid smoke i pureed up some chapolte peppers (Canned) and added this. I started with some Jim beam, but as its rather expensive in canada, i have gone for some cheeper bourbon. It saves me drinking it too!

It's very true that this sauce gets even better with a little time in the fridge.  I made it three days ago and loved it, but we had it again last night and it was even better.  It's gotten spicier and developed a depth of flavor that wasn't there initially.  The only changes I made - I added about a quarter teaspoon of cayenne pepper, and I traded out half the ketchup for chili sauce, as someone had suggested.  This really is so good.  Thanks for sharing!

I am not a big fan of BBQ, but this is a great sauce. I followed the recipe to the letter. (I used Jim Beam) Next time I will use less brown sugar only because it was a little sweet for me; but my family who loves BBQ liked it the way it was.  I doubled the batch and canned the remaining sauce. I will definately be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this sauce 2 times already.  I am always happy with the flavor of this sauce. It goes well with a variety of beef, pork, chicken or whatever you might select. I agree with some reviewers that making it ahead of time really improves it.  I've become addicted to this BBQ Sauce and look forward to those lip-smacking ribs! Thank you Kevin for such a excellent recipe : )

I had forgotten BBQ sauce at the store, so decided to try making my own.  No more store-bought sauce for us!! This recipe was wonderful.  I used about 3/4 of it with some shredded roast beef for sandwiches that were fabulous, then used the rest to marinate some chicken breasts on the grill. They were tender & yummy.  Will definately be making this one again!

I was looking for a good recipe for a party I'm having next weekend. Happened to read the reviews for this sauce yesterday, and I rushed to the butcher that same hour, looking for baby back ribs. Where I'm from, ribs for 4 could cost a bit (USD60) but it was worth it. Yum!

Its hard to find a really good BBQ sauce... My family and I have used this twice now... on chicken and ribs and it makes for very good food... the best part is its flavorful enough on its own and yet if you want it hotter or sweeter you can do so just by adding more heat or sweet...  I tend to keep the onion and garlic in this instead of straining it out just because gives is more flavor as well as texture...

people...THIS bbq sauce sauce rocks!  i always tweak recipes but did this as is & only change i made at the end of simmering was to add about a 1/4 cup more jack daniels as i felt it mellowed a bit to much, probably because JD is sweeter & smoother than most whiskeys. also, i put the onion & garlic in a mini food processor to mince so there was no need to strain...texture is nice in a bbq sauce.

Out of this WORLD!  SO easy to make.  Makes a lot.  I thought it might be too strong when I tasted it as it simmered, but when I basted my ribs with it, it toned down.  I will never use another kind of bbq sauce!

I love this sauce.  I do reduce the ketchup a little bit and add some more pepper and liquid smoke.

Really good sauce. The vinegar was a bit too much for me thought. I will make this again with less vinegar. I used the sauce for slow cooker ribs ... very good.

I made this sauce for pulled pork.  My family thought it was the best barbecue sauce they had ever had.  They still talk about it, and I made it over three weeks ago.  A definite keeper.

This was a good sauce, but not as FANTASTIC as I expected from reading the reviews.  I really looked forward to the bourbon flavor, but fear most of it evaporated as I cooked the onions.  If I do it again, I'll saute onions in a little bit of butter, and keep my bourbon to flavor the sauce.  I might have rated this higher, if I didn't already have a BBQ recipe I love.

Other than cutting the amount of Liquid Smoke in half, and that's just my taste preference, this is the best BBQ sauce recipe I've ever found.  

Also, try changing the bourbon you use.  Different brands will give you different flavors.  My personal favorite is Maker's Mark.

Now this is some good sauce but you need to make it outside.  It will take several days to get the smell out of your house.

Sauce is great though.  I love this stuff.

We had a huge superbowl party and when I smothered this on the ribs, every guy at the party started to drool. I'll make this over and over! I was afraid there might have been too much liquid smoke, but I follwed the recipe and I'm glad I did. The sauce was magnificent!

My husband made this last night and it was great!  It was very tangy and the flavor was so good.  Next time he makes it, he may strain the onion and garlic out.  We won't be buying store sauce for a while!

I made this sauce for a picnic with my family - everyone loved it - and my father-in-law asked if he could take some home for leftovers!  I followed some of the recommendations of others and added more hot sauce and less liquid smoke.  This is the only BBQ sauce I will ever make again!

I enjoyed the sauce, it had good substance.  Perhaps a little too "tomatoie," as another reviewer commented.  I did take the advice of adding maple syrup and I thought that was a nice addition.  I agree that finely chopping the onion is important.

Wonderful tangy sauce!  Used with a smoker and without.
