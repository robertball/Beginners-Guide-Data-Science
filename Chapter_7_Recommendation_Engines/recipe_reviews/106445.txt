This is pretty good, it's lighter than yogurt but similar in flavor.

This was good for a light, tasty dessert.  I poured the gelatin mixture into miniature flower cake molds.  Unfortunately it wasn't firm enough to hold the shape very well when I unmolded them.  Next time I'll use a ramekin or IMVINTAGE's suggestion of using a martini glass.  

I used one bag of frozen strawberries because the fresh ones weren't very ripe.  I also used sugar instead of Splenda and it tasted great.

I didn't use whole milk, I used 2% organic & I used 1/3 cup pre-mixed strawberry puree (like you use in mixed drinks) instead of pureeing them myslef. The strawberry puree is already a bit sweet so I only added a tbp of splenda. I poured about a tbp of puree into a martini glass & then poured the panna cotta in, serving it in the glass. I think the strawberry puree in the bottom of the glass really added a lot to the recipe & will repeat next time. We enjoyed this low-cal treat...thanks!
