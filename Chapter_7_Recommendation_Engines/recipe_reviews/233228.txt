This was a fast and easy soup. I think if you served over rice it would taste like cabbage rolls. I halved the garlic and black pepper, omitted the salt, used a bag of coleslaw mix and 2 ten ounce cans of tomato soup with 3 cups of water. I added onion powder, garlic powder, Mrs Dash garlic & herb and a bay leaf. I did not boil the cabbage seperately, after the beef and onions were browned I added the rest of the ingredients, brought to a boil, then lowered to a simmer for an hour. My family enjoyed it!

I simmered the cabbage in V8 & 2 bay leaves.  I also added some chopped carrots & celery to that. Also a little worcestershire to taste.  It's a good soup base & then tinker to your liking.  Have leftovers add a little pasta. With any kind of tomato base soup I always add a can of tomato soup.  It does make a difference.  Learned this on this site.

My customers love this soup also. I use beef broth instead of water and I add rice.
