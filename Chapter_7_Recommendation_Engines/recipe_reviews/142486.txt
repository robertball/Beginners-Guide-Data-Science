This was great!  I used frozen cooked shrimp (thawed) but just added those, the crabmeat and tuna the last 3 minutes.  A big hit at a recent pool party.  Even those who are not lovers of fish devoured it....thanks for a "keeper" recipe.

This was really good! I scaled this recipe down to 6 servings. Only thing different, I chopped green onion and sprinkled on top of the finished dish. Thank you for the recipe!

I just made this for a party on Saturday.  I added 1 lb. (16 oz. box) small spiral shell noodles and it was great!  Everyone at the party loved it and asked for the recipe!

Took a leap of faith on this one. Even though the reviews were great there were only nine. Add to that the fact that I was fasting when I made this yesterday so I couldn't even taste it until right before it was served to 60 plus people! I followed the recipe exactly but added small shell noodles and extra mayo to create more "sauce". It was fantastic. Everyone at the potluck raved about it and I was asked for the recipe. Three people were fighting over the last two servings!

Excellent! I also have some avocado and green onion left to add into the salad. Potato and pasta could also be good for extra volume. I serve it on tortillas for quick lunch in hot summer days. Thanks for sharing.

This salad was great! I halved the sugar, used spicy mustard instead of yellow, left out the Tumeric since I didn't have any and it's expensive and used double the listed amount of crabmeat since that was the size of the can I had on hand. I like the flavor of mayonnaisey salads with relish so I put a cup of relish in. My boyfriend absolutely loved it, so I'll be making more very soon. :-)

My guys loved this seafood salad in a wrap and it fits our low carb lifestyle. Great recipe. I did substitute lobster for the scallops.

I loved this recipe.  First I made it as listed to get the flavor.  I always make recipes as listed to get the flavor and then I make my own variations according to how I want it to taste and have made it using different ingredients. For a baby shower, I made it with about 8oz (1/2 box) of macaroni, 2 8oz packs of thawed imitation crabmeat and 4 5oz cans of tuna, added some Lawry's seasoning salt, Cajun seasoning and all the remaining ingredients listed.  I didn't cook anything because I didn't use shrimp or scallops.  For me, I have to make this the night before the event so that the flavors can fully mix, and if using pasta, so that the salad can fully cool and gel together and it was a hit!

I am a seafood lover, but this just didn't hit the spot...  Seemed like it was a little bland; like it needed more of a sauce to add-or something special to the sauce to make it better.
