First time I've made any candy, or anything close to it. I didn't have any creamer, so I actually used powdered coffee creamer with water. It came out great! I used it to drizzle on cappucino from my new expresso maker. MmmmM!

I used International Delight Hershey's chocolate caramel flavored coffee creamer.  I also used 1/2 C brown sugar.  The taste is GREAT!  
The first time the caramel came out too soft, so I put it back in the pot and reboiled.  It came out fine.  (I never could get it to ball and flatten like the directions say.)  Tip: use a bigger pot than you think!  It expands and bubbles quite a bit, and if it overflows on the oven it's a real pain to get off.  Also, be sure to butter the wax paper very well, or it will stick.  Next time I'll spoon the mixture onto little pieces of wax paper before it cools.  (Maybe buttered waxed paper in mini muffin tins would work?)  This way you don't have the pain of cutting it and getting that waxed paper off before wrapping the individual pieces.

Excellent! Being lactose intollerant, I cannot have the caramel that is sold in the stores. There is very little difference between this recipe and the store bought caramel.

Needed to send these to missionaries in Africa, and thought this recipe would work. Really don't know what I did wrong, and they're overly soft. Also, I tried one and it tastes just like brown sugar.Texture-wise I'm wondering if it has anything to do with the creamer I used.

I made the recipe as written and I was able to get a good caramel consistency- it doesn't form a ball when you drop it in the water but if you can form it together with a spoon after it drops in then it is done. It didn't taste good though, just sweet, no flavor.
