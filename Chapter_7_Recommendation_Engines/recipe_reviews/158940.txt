UPDATE:  OK, I combined - this recipe and another recipe and did use the V-8 and my husband LOVED it.  Thanks. This sound really good and I want to try it but actually this is a question - I am snowed in with 16 inches of snow in Washington, DC - all I have is V-8.  Any opinions if this will work our not.  Thanks.

I used  Frank's Red Hot for the hot sauce.  Instead of pickles, I added a few whole pickled green beans, anchovy stuffed olives and a celery stick.  Husband loved it.  This is the recipe I will continue to use.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

Ok, this didn't work for me.  I thought that the taste was off.  It was either the Old Bay or the Dill or both.  Sorry.

I chose this one because I had all the ingredients on hand.  It was very tasty!  I used Absolut Pepper because that's the only vodka we had.

It will probably work better if you used tomato sauce and water it down. But, if your snowed in and can't get to the store, use V-8 and go easy on the celery salt and worcestershire. I'm sure it will be fine. Good luck!

This is a great Bloody Mary mix.  I agree that the dill adds a great deal of just right flavor--but I do love dill .   Also I did not use the seafood seasoning--great without it.  This is not overly spicy as when made with V8 juice.  I have always preferred a Bloody Mary with plain tomato juice.  We made a pitcher and enjoyed another glass!  Tastes like MORE!!!

NOW you're talkin!  The only one I've seen to throw some kind of dill in there, that's the key ingredient between good bloody mary's and awesome ones!!  Thanks for this recipe.

I love me some bloody marys, but not this one.  I think I could have chosen a better hot sauce to go with it, though - Cholula did not seem right.  Still, I don't think I'll be trying again.

I am very picky about my bloody Mary's...This was wonderful!!
I did cut the juice down to  8 and 1/2 ounces, then cut all the ingredients in half  except the hot sauce I used 1/4 tsp franks, and used 2 ounces vodka. Skipped the pickle.

Your best drink mix is the one you make yourself. This one is my favorite especially for a morning cocktail on that special occasions.I prefer to use vegetable juice in place of tomato and my favorite is V-8. One adjustment in this particular recipe would be that going
