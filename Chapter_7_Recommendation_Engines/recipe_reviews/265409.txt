I made this soup yesterday and it was delicious! My husband doesn't like the all cheesy broccoli soup, so this was just what I was looking for and he loved it! the kids did too but was a bit spicy for them. I think next time I will just skip adding the cayenne pepper although I liked the kick it added!

This was excellent! I typically do not like blended soup but this one was so rich and full of flavor that I gobbled it right on up. Made as written and no changes needed whatsoever!
