These pancakes were absolutely delicious! I used a packet of cinnamon spice oatmeal and a pinch of vanilla extract in the recipe to add some extra flavor. My roomate actually said they were the best pancakes she's ever had

These are great.  I made them without the bananas b/c I didn't have any, and I used wheat flour instead of white. It made about 12 three-inch pancakes.

Wonderful, healthier alternative to our usual weekend pancakes. I made them as directed and my 2 yr old LOVES them! He even ate them without syrup! 5 stars because this will become one of our family's "usuals".

I made these for breakfast on my son's first birthday and he loved them without syrup!  They have a very nice flavor and if you don't stir them too much (I even had some dry lumps when I was done stirring them) they come out with the perfect texture.

I used w.w. pastry flour in this for some extra substance and they turned out just great.  very light and fluffy!  They're also great with or without the bananas.  If you choose to use the bananas may I suggest using an all natural sweetener called xylitol.  Looks and tastes like sugar but is great for dental health and diabetic friendly!  Can be found at most health food stores.

These came out way too tough and dense for me. The flavor is good, but the texture... not so much.  Afraid I won't be making these again. Sorry.

A good flavor enhancer for those of us who have to use gluten-free flour!  I only used one banana, and mixed it with an electric mixer, to make it soft, so that my kids wouldn't see the chunks of bananas (I wanted them to at least try it).  I just added the sugar into the recipie.  We all liked the flavor, I liked the fact that they are healthier than regular pankcakes and they keep you fuller for a longer time.
