I used purple sweet potatoes instead of the traditional yellow or orange variety. I also pre-baked the sweet potatoes before blending them with the hand mixer. The dish needed a bit longer than 1 hour to bake. Next time I might try raising the oven temperature.

Our family serves this every Thanksgiving. It is a tradition and guests always ask for the recipe. It freezes and reheats easily.
