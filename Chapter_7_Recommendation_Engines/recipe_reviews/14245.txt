I got this recipe from a friend years ago.Since then I have made it for family bbq's and friends dinners parties.Everyone loves it and marvels at how easy it is. I have changed my dressing slightly,I add 1/2 mircle whip salad dressing and 1/2 yogurt. It is much lighter and just as good.

Good salad.  Lettuce will stay firm if you use iceberg.  I also used green onion instead of green pepper.  This added a nice contrast to the sweetness of the dressing.

I rate recipes by asking myself if I would make them again and this one I would not make again.
After 12 hours in the fridge you end up with a pan of soggy lettuce and tasteless veggies.

Delicious AND easy!  Great hit at a recent party!  I did tweek the recipe a bit:  used baby spinach leaves in addition to iceberg lettuce, green onion in place of green pepper, water chestnuts in place of cauliflower -- you really can use anything you want in the layers.  My dressing did not "trickle down," but I simply tossed before serving.  A DEFINITE KEEPER RECIPE!

We love salad and this one is great.  I added a layer of water chesnuts and left out cauliflower and it was still wonderful.  Very good for holiday dinners because you make the day before and store in the fridge which cuts out some of the work on the big cooking day.

Absolutely Delicious! Made it for a dinner party and the compliments kept coming long after the salad was gone.  I added 3 chopped hard boiled eggs,cherry tomatoes and chopped roasted pecans.
I was not sure about the Mayo Dressing but thats what makes it so Wonderful.

Wonderful cold salad...went over very well at my office potluck.  My husband even loved it and he's not a big salad eater.  It took some time to cut up all the vegetables, but it wasn't difficult.  I would use less peas.  They kind of take over the flavor of the salad when there are too many.  I will make it again!

Great salad. I will only add half the peas next time. I added tomatoes and next time will also put in some cucumber. I was pleasently surprised that I liked the mayo dressing. I added a little more sugar than what was called for. The bacon was one of the best parts of the whole thing.

My 11 year old daughter made this recipe and it was wonderful. Instead of cheddar, we used mozzarella and parmesan combination. Was a hit at the company potluck!

Loved it!  Let it sit over night.  It is a very pretty dish but I mixed it well before I ate it for better flavor.

I changed this up a bit and now everyone asks me to bring this to every function we ever have.  I layered it with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, frozen peas, spread the dressing mixture over the frozen peas (this is so much easier than trying to do it the other ways), then sprinkled mashed boiled egg, cover it with cheese and then put the bacon on top.  Cover and let it set for at least 4 hours.  The dressing thins and runs down onto the lettuce.  OMG..this is fantastic.  :)

I do change my veggies from this recipe, but you could put whatever on it. But its the perfect combo of 2 cups of mayo and 3 TBLS. of sugar that makes it. I use 1 cucumber, 1 bunch of green onions,6 eggs cut up and only one cup of peas,I layer that stuff with the lettuce and then put on the dressing, sharp chedder all over the top and some tomatoes and bacon, (I only use about 6 slices)to top it off. Everybody wants this recipe and it is better the next day!!!!

I made this dish for a company luncheon and had 25 of my co-workers requested the recipe. It is wonderful for parties and family get togethers. It takes a bit of time to make but it is SO worth it. I have tried other 7 layer salad recipes from friends and this is THE BEST!

I have a recipe for this salad that I have made for years, but because this one had such good reviews, I decided to make it for Easter dinner.  But I did not like the sweetness of the dressing--the mayo and sugar mixture--although some members of my family said it was good.  So I will go back to my old recipe that combines mayo, sour cream, and a small amount of blue cheese dressing for the dressing.  I did take the advice of one reviewer, though, and added chopped boiled eggs, which I thought was a great addition and will use in my old recipe in the future.

Excellent salad! My family is on a low carb diet so I substituted Splenda for the sugar and the peas can be removed and you can add another lower carb vegetable instead. I fixed it for a family dinner and it was all gone by the end of dinner. Thank you Barb!!!

I make mine just a little different: iceburg lettuce, celery, peppers, Miracle Whip mixture, broccoli, peas, cheese, bacon; in that order.  I do not use cauliflower and I do not refridgerate overnite.  Make an hour or so before serving.

I made this for a large family gathering and everyone loved it.  Many had seconds and thirds of it.  Leave it in the fridge overnight and the flavors really meld.

This is so yummy! The flavors all mingle together. Best if served within an hour or two of drizzling the dressing. It's a bit soggy the next day but I still ate it.

Made this recipe for a family gathering and it was devoured.  There are so many options for substitution, you could never tire of this versatile recipe.  Will definitely be making this one again.

Really yummy!  Do your family a favor and plan to have a bacon'n'eggs breakfast the morning you cook your bacon for this.  I got shot some dirty looks when I announced the bacon was for the salad and not for our breakfast...yikes!!!  :-)
I made this for an appetizer party, and it fed 8 people with a bit left over.

I would make this salad again!  I took the advise of others using green onions instead of green pepper, half mozzarella half parmesan; half lettuce/half baby spinach and stevia extract instead of white sugar.  Delicious!  Before long it was gone.

Made this for a large gathering, everyone wanted the recipe.  I threw in broccoli and left out the green peppers. You could use whatever vegetables you happen to like.  Definitely needs iceberg lettuce to keep from getting soggy.  Very Good.

My family loved this salad! The lettuce stayed crisp for days. I added extra bacon to the top knowing little fingers would get in there and steal some off the top. A great way for us to get our veggies.

I made this for a teachers conferance! The only things I changed was I added 1 Tablespoon mild curry to the mayo/sugar mixture. And I used broccoli instead of cauliflower because that's what I had on hand. I have been asked for the recipe many times.

Have made this recipe for years and never take home any.  I always add the mayo dressing a few hours before serving and make sure it's very cold before putting out.  Pre-washed, bagged greens make assembly faster.

I've made this salad a few times now and everyone raves about it and they always ask for the recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to use the bottled  Hormel Bacon Chunks (they are sold in a bottle), I find them just as flavourful as real bacon and you don't get the greasiness you would from using real bacon.

Very easy to prepare.  I use Lite salad dressing and Splenda to cut calories where I can.  I've also learned that my family likes this recipe even more when it is tossed right before serving.  No one gets a glob of salad dressing that way.  One can also add whatever vegetables the group likes best - it's always good.

Wonderful salad!  We made this for our 4th of July BBQ.  Used brocolli in place of cauliflower and red pepper in place of green.  Made everything else exactly as recipe called for.  Put dressing on top, and instead of sprinkling with cheese my daughter and I cut out cucumber stars from mini cookie cutter and placed them in a circle in the upper left hand corner of dish.  Added grape tomato "stripes" and had a flag salad that was as pretty as it was yummy.  Thanks for a new favorite.

This was a hit!  I made this for our Christmas Eve family party and everyone love it!  I used green onion instead of green peppers and water chestnuts in place of the cauliflower.  I also added chopped pecans and hardboiled eggs as suggested by one of the other reviewers and mixed 1/2 mayo, 1/2 miracle whip.  This was absolutely delicious and by far one of my favorite go to salads!  Thanks for sharing!

A family favorite!!!  As the years have come and gone, I have found that buying some of the vegetables already cut up at the grocery store salad bar makes this a snap to put together!  Will be making this again for Easter.

This recipe brought back so many memories for me.  My mom use to make this for every big family gathering.  As a kid, I couldn't stand it but as I grew up it became one of my favorite salads.  I substitute brocoli for the cauliflower and add some spinach to the lettuce.

Excellent.  I used Splenda instead of sugar as I try to keep everything sugar free.

Wonderful!  I made one change; I used 1 cup of mayo and 1 cup of miracle whip along with the sugar for the dressing, and it was great!  Next time, I will use less peas, more bacon, and add tomatoes.

I made this for an office pot-luck.  I was a little concerned about the Mayonnaise and sugar topping but once salad was served everyone raved about it.

We have been making this salad for years and it is so amazing! It does not state to toss salad prior to serving, but it is a MUST in our house. If you think it tastes like lettuce and mayo, you aren't tossing it. I also only had a touch of green onion as it can be overpowering in the salad once tossed. Real bacon bits can be substituted and it is not too noticeable. This salad literally disappears everywhere we take it!

Very good and easy.  We left out the cauliflower and green peppers and added hard-boiled eggs and tomatoes instead.

Made it the night before and loved the crunch of the iceberg lettuce, cauliflower and celery.  Since the mayo seals in the crispness of the veggies - it's a good make-ahead recipe.

Instead of the green bell pepper used the sweeter red bell pepper (family preference)

Very pretty salad but idk, I didn't really like the dressing personally but other of my guests thought it was good. I would probably make it again but I think I will try a different dressing.

Yum! I used green pepper and added green onion. Did not increase the mayo, used olive oil mayo and Truvia. Lettuce stayed firm and fresh for several days in a sealed container.

Great recipe for a barbeque.  I updated with onions chopped fine used sprigs of cilintro on top. Added black pepper, garlic powder, basil to mayonaise and instead of 2 cups of mayonaise I used 1 cup of mayonaise and 3/4 c of milk mixed to thicken reduced sugar to 1 1/2 T. A refreshing salad.

I made this layered salad for Thanksgiving with a few changes, because I needed to use what I had on hand. This is how I layered:
lettuce, bell pepper, green onion, water chestnuts, english peas, real mayo mixed with (1) tlbs dry Hidden Valley Ranch dressing dip, shredded cheese and real bacon bits.  Mine actually turned out to be (8) layers, but it was great.  I put it in a trifle bowl and it was great looking too.  Everyone raved over it.

I made this for an early Christmas meal.  It was delicious.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe except that I used both red and green peppers to make it look more Christmasy.  I used bagged iceburg lettuce and prepared it about 7 hours in advance.  I was very pleased with the dish.

We added quartered boiled eggs and removed the celery.  
My mom makes this and I really enjoy it.  A cool meal to share without starting the oven.

Very easy and quick. Had it for a summer night BBQ. I used up some veg that were in my fridge. Can mix and match what you like or don't like. I also used 1/2 C mayo, 1/4 C sour cr and 1/4 C flavoured yogurt. since I ran out of mayo. Will see if the lettuce lasts over night. I threw in some walnuts. Forgot the cheese but still good
It also makes a large 13x9 pan enough for a large crowd.
Will make it again !

I used two heads of romaine, did a layer of spinach leaves, green onion instead of red (thought it might be a little strong for work), thinly sliced radishes for color, along with the required celery, peas, eggs, a LOT of bacon, and cheddar.  For the dressing I used 1 c. low fat mayo made with olive oil, 1 c. low fat sour cream, 1 pkg dry Italian dressing mix.  Every one loved it.  Had I made it for home I probably would have added some seedless cucumber, and diced mixed peppers to the mix.  I wonder how a nice thick blue cheese dressing would be?

Excellent! I didn't change a thing. Took to a potluck with a lot of different food, and it was totally eaten up.
