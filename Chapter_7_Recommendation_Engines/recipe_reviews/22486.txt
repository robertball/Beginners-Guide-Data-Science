This was an easy way to delicious cabbage rolls. But here's what to do different next time to avoid some major problems: Use fattier ground meat (using dry rice in the meat sucks up any moisture and drys out the meat.) Microwave your cabbage a little to soften it and give it some water content (recipe calls for using raw cabbage which really doesn't get the right amount of steaming when cooking and the cabbage comes out rubbery and chewy). Also remove the thick veins on each cabbage leaf as they take longer to cook. Also add some ketchup for a sweet and sour taste, plus I add more sugar since I like my cabbage rolls sweeter.

The rolls had a wonderful flavour to them.  Quite easy to make but a little time consuming.  Overall it was a recipe i will repeat in using.

My husband and I thought these turned out so delicious!  I'm not an expert cabbage-roll-roller because they fell apart (I think blanching the cabbage leaves first would help), and the tomato soup burned to the bottom a bit but it didn't affect the flavour at all.  Definitely will be making a double batch next time!

I used the remainder of a chinese cabbage I had and found it easy to roll up after I had microwaved the leaves for a few minutes. I used 250g ground pork,100g rice,i small onion and 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic.I added a teaspn or so of sweet paprika and a tin of tomatos (instead of the condensed soup)which i put through the blender with a teaspn of minced garlic.If I make it again I will be sure to add tomato paste because the flavours were quite bland.(my husband put tobasco sauce on his).I baked it in oven for hour and half at 200C.We ate the lot without extra rice or potato on the side.

Unfortunately the recipe wasn't quite as flavorful as I had hoped. I think it was mostly the cabbage's addition (even though its called Cabbage Rolls) that gave it an odd flavor. However, the filling was quite good when it was made into meatballs and baked with mushroom soup instead.

Maybe next time.

These were quite easy to make and flavourful but how the heck do you get the leaves off the cabbage without ripping them?!  I added paprika to the meat mixture and, instead of boiling for an hour and a half I used a pressure pan - HIGH setting for 20 minutes and it worked out great.  Thanks!

I might be me, it might be the cabbage, or it might be the recipe, I wasn't craving more when I finished.

Flavor is good but I got so frustrated trying to roll these buggers.  I ended up lining the bottom of a baking dish with tomato mixture laying cabbage over it, followed by meat mixture, then more cabbage etc (like lasagna).  Then baked.

I blanced the entire cabbage head for 20minutes in hot water and then cold. The leaves come off easier and roll better. I still baked them about an hour. Also I didn't use meat, but added green pepper, and made tomato sauce from tomato juice, garlic, basil, oregano, some onions and green peppers. They were very good.

Two stars because the flavors are there, but the technique is way off. I tried this recipe as written. If you use raw rice, which expands as it cooks, and you make a nice tight proper cabbage roll, the expanding rice will split them. Cook the rice first, as you prepare everything else so itâ€™s all ready to roll at the same time. Then the rolls only have to boil in the sauce about 30 mins or 165F in the middle. The meat will not dry out, the rolls will not split, and as you eat with your eyes first, you will not be disappointed. Cheers!

I've only had cabbage rolls a time or two in my life, but this recipe changed everything.  I now know what was missing in my life :)  I did make some minor changes--half turkey burger and half spicy italian sausage, garlic x8, onion reduced by half and replaced with shredded carrot, a whole chopped red bell, and a single chopped celery stalk.  CREAMY tomato soup is KEY, in my opinion, but I used Imagine brand and omitted the water.  I've made these in a crockpot: bring soup to boil, add rolls, reduce to low and ignore for 4 hrs.  I've made these in the oven: Bake at 350 covered with foil for 4 hrs.  AMAZING.  Even the skeptics were impressed.

I LOVE this recipe--my ex-sister in law made this same recipe in lieu of the recipe her Hungarian mother made (which I watched her mom make once when I was young and liked to fuss in kitchen and which also required small amounts of game--not for me--she ground her own venison, beef and pork together) but SIL tweaked the sauce a bit--I myself remember her adding ketchup but she also used the tomato soup that the recipe calls for--I loved the way it came out (with a couple of tablespoons of ketchup and 2 tbls. of tomato paste to amp up sauce a bit--that's why I buy a TUBE of tomato paste at the store) and made it for son-in-law who LOVED it also--but he put Tobasco in his--I put on a sprinkling of paprika prior  to cooking and liked mine just fine.  FOR THE 1st time users--if you like this--next time make a goodly amount of meat filling --like 2x-3x of recipe--and freeze in bags--also for newbs--Get a big pot and put the cleaned up head of cabbage in there and let it simmer--outer leaves will start to loosen up--I trim the center rib off for easier rolling--with the leftover cabbage--I take a few more of the destroyed outer leaves--(it happens)--and line the pot with them to prevent sticking--the rest go to make Allrecipes Cabbage Fat-Burning Soup (which the family doesn't realize is fat burning)--for the soup--I use Chicken broth or stock and cook the vegs in there and add a can of stewed or crushed tomatoes to sweeten flavor.
