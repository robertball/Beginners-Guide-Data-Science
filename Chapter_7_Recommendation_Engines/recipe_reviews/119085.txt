Didn't have puff pastry, only had 1 package of crescent rolls. So, I cut the recipe in half and added only 2 heads of broccoli and no cauliflower. Turned out great!

I've made this two times both times it came out good. The first time I made it for Thanksgiving everypne was like wow looks intresting. Everyone including myself that is not a fan of cauliflower loved it.  However, I like alot of flavor so I added four cloves of garlic, Italian seasoning, and more Parmesan cheese. I couldn't find the puff pastry so I used Fillo dough #7, it takes the same amount of time to cook.  One question I have is ,could you make it and freeze it before or after cooking?

This was a favorite at Thanksgiving.  I cut down on the cheese and white sauce, and it was very good.

Very good! I added chicken and served it as a main dish.  Took 25 minutes in the oven, and it was perfectly done.

I had to bake it way longer than 25 minutes, but it was worth it.  The flavor was very good.  Needs to be eaten right away.  The puff pastry gets soggy quick.

I served this as a side dish at Thanksgiving.  The taste was great but it was very heavy.  Next time I make it, I will add turkey or ham to it and make it a meal unto itself.

This is a very good vegetable side dish for holidays.  Looks very nice and tastes good too!  I took it to Thanksgiving dinner, got many compliments on it and was asked for the recipe.  Have made several times since then and will continue to make.

Served this on Thanksgiveing, and EVERYONE found it delicious.  We had 12 people. Not one picky or fairly picky eater disliked this super yummy recipe which is saying lots.  I would make this again for next Turkey Day or any other day.

My husband hates cauliflower, and he liked this! The whole family thought it was great. The only problem was that I made it ahead (I had never used puffed pastry before)--don't do that. It went mushy. But it still tasted good!

I didn't have broccoli and cauliflower, but instead had a frozen bag of mixed veggies (green beans, carrots, corn, etc.).  It worked beautifully.

Family loved it at Thanksgiving - & I'll use it again - just wish it had a little more puffiness for the crust.
