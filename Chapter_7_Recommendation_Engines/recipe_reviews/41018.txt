Wonderful basic recipe. I added garlic cloves and celery sauteed in butter. Used 3 cans of clams and 12 ozs. scallops.  Cut back on fat and cholesterol by using fat free half and half. My husband travels and eats in restaurants all week.  He said that this beats any restaurant chowder he's had.  Great!!!!!!

My husband & I both think this is a keeper.  I didn't have all the ingredients.  I didn't use the dill nor the sherry.  I was going to substitute the sherry with chicken broth but, ha, I didn't have that either.  It was still good although it seemed to need just a tweak more seasoning...probably 'cuz of what I left out plus I added more than 6 ounces of scallops. Using canned minced clams helped make this pretty easy to assemble.

This is unquestionably one of the best sea food chowders I have ever made, and I have doubled the recipe because everyone wanted "more". Served it with a spinach salad and some crusty rolls.
