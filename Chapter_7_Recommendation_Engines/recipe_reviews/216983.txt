GREAT!  Be sure to use canned corned beed, NOT corned beef hash. Tried is as written, then substituting  cream of mushroom soup for the tomato coup and eliminated the atsup.  Love it both ways.

Sounds good, but where are you finding the canned corned beef?  I have been looking for months for it to make corned beef casserole (like you do tuna casserole).  It is not on the shelves.

Hi there;
I am the cook who submitted this recipe & in answer to one reviewer's question, you should be able to buy CANNED CORNED BEEF (thank-you to another reviewer for pointing that out) on the shelves of any supermarket where you find the canned meats.

I would never have thought to use canned corn beef in a pasta dish, it turned out great. Easy & economical.  Also tried it with mushroom soup.
Next time I'll try it with diced fried garlic sausage.

I love this! My mom used to make this same thing when I was a kid, but she used ground beef not corned beef. Very yummy.

I followed the directions as best I could but I didn't really like this. I'm not sure what I did wrong, looks just like the picture. The rest of the family didn't care for it either.

Added 1 can drained diced tomatoes. Added spices- basil, oregano, garlic. Needs a bit more sauce- maybe 1 can tomato sauce. Only need to sprinkle cheese on top at the end.

My family LOVES this recipe. The only change I really made was using Ground Beef instead of Corned Beef and I added a little more garlic. YUMMY!!

I would have never thought about putting corn beef in goulash but it turned out wonderful.  We had a carry-in at work and I received rave reviews.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It is now a staple in my kitchen.

This sounded good to try for something different, but had never had canned corned beef before and did not care for it.

Good solid comfort food. The corned beef had a key opener which threw me! I felt like it was 1930 again. Hahaha!  I added a can of diced tomatoes.  So good. I'm sure it will taste even better the next day.

Great recipe! I added 1 lb of ground beef to add a bit more protein. Delicious!
