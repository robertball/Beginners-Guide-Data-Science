This cake is great, but there are a couple things that should be changed in the order of the directions.  Don't mix the baking soda and buttermilk to start with.  Cream the shortening, sugar, ect. first.  Then you hold a small bowl with the buttermilk and baking soda over the bowl with the creamed mixture in it and beat as it will foam and may foam over the bowl.  Pour that mixture immediately into the creamed mixture.  Then continue with the directions as stated.  This will make the cake a little more moist for those who think that it is a little bit dry.  This recipe, no doubt, started out with the buttermilk as sourmilk.  You use the same amount of sourmilk as you do buttermilk.  To make sourmilk, use the 1/2 cup regular milk and add 1 tablespoon vinegar and mix well.  Allow to set while creaming your ingredients, then follow the steps above and you will have a more flavorful, moist cake.  These little bits I have given you have been left out as it has been passed around through generations of bakers.  I hope these extra tips help you out.  Thanks.  The recipe was great!

I made this cake after reading all of the comments , good and bad . This is the nicest cake I've tasted in a very long time. I sell cakes from my home and needed a recipe for a "real" homeade cake and that's how I found this one. I couldn't wait for it to cool so I could frost and cut it for a taste. I don't know what's been happening to those of you that were disappointed when you tried this recipe, but it turned out excellent for me. I did make a couple changes though, I put in 3 whole eggs and one egg white, and two teaspoons of vanilla . ( my experience has been that cakes made from scratch need more whites than yolks and double flavoring for some odd reason when the recipe calls for water instead of milk. I don't know if these two changes made the differece for me, but it is truly a lovely , light texture cake. Please try at least once and perhaps if you didn't have good results the first time, I'd give it another try .

Love this recipe!  Of course, I made modifications as I almost usually do.  I cut the sugar back by half a cup and added a package of french vanilla pudding mix to the dry ingredients.  This makes the cake incredibly moist.  This may also help take away from the 'cornbread-like' texture that some people are experiencing with their cakes.  I also add about 2 T. of canola oil which also adds to the moisture of the cake.  I just use two whole eggs to simplify things and not waste any egg.  The cake is more yellow then white, but I think the flavor is richer and better.  To the wet ingredients I also add a tablespoon of fresh lemon zest.  Gives the cake a great boost of flavor without being overly 'lemony.' I frost the cake, which I bake in 3 8" pans to make a triple layer sensation, with vanilla Rich's BetterCream, which you could also add a little lemon extract to as well.  I then drizzle with melted chocoate and everyone gobbles it up!

Probably one of the best white cakes I've ever tasted anywhere, let alone made myself.  None of the almost anticipated and dreaded Dry Cake Syndrome!  They're also light and fluffy (I made cupcakes) with a softer, more open crumb - something I already knew when I took them out of the cupcake tin and found them "squeezably soft."  Delicately vanilla flavored, so it's suitable for any flavor frosting. Just excellent. I made these as written except I simply added the baking soda to the dry ingredients rather than to the buttermilk.  I made half a recipe, which made 12 cupcakes, and frosted them with "Waldorf Astoria Cake Frosting," also from this site.

I have tried 23 other recipes.. I was looking for an old fashioned cake.. this is the BEST cake ever.  I served it to three different gentlemen friends and they all raved about it.  They all said it was just like the one their grandma or mom made when they were little.  This cake is dense and has an excellent taste and texture.. I will NOT look for another recipe.. This is the best.. thanks for sharing it.

This recipe makes a yellow cake--not a white cake--because it uses egg yolks rather than whole eggs.  That said, the cake was moist and dense, but uninspiring.  We ate it, it was fine, but I'll try something else next time.

This cake is superb, thank you Aunt Bert & Holli (and tari Weber for sharing), surely you must live in cake heaven now. I've made it at least 5 times now. It IS slightly heavy, & very moist, the antithesis of grocery store cakes these days. Yippee! With buttercream frosting it makes a splendid birthday cake. My only minus is the amount of sugar, too much. Best advice - grease the cake pans well. More curious each time I make it, who was Holli, and who was Aunt Bert? Every time I make this cake I find myself thinking fondly of these two women I will never know, wishing to thank them. If Tari wishes to share any info about these people I would be delighted.

What a disappointment!  I thought, surely with all those great comments this had to be a wonderful cake.  The batter tasted great, but this cake was terrible.  I had to toss the whole thing in the trash because noone at my house would eat it.  What a waste of food, and a big let down.

The stars are wrong. How could anyone give this 5 stars. first of all, there is no way to get a WHITE cake using 4 egg yolks. The photo cannot be of this cake. The recipe is written haphazardly, the ingredients are in no particular order. I had to keep checking and rechecking to be sure that I had not missed anything. This was intended for a birthday, it went in the trash. The cake is flat and grainy with an overwhelming eggy taste. I reminded me of cornbread. The top was crunchy.  Even when topped with cream cheese frosting we could not eat this.

I just finished making this cake. I followed the directions EXACTLY as written. It did not rise at all. I opened up brand new soda and baking powder. I don't know what went wrong. My cake fell completely apart, so I was eating the pieces to see what it tasted like, and the first thing was cornbread. It wasn't horrible, but I feel it lacked flavor. I took a piece over to my husband, and asked him what he thought it tasted like, and he said cornbread also. So tomorrow I have to find another recipe. :-(

ok... now this recipe looked interesting. I saw an old recipe, and thought immediately of an older lady at an older stove cooking something that would bring me back to loving childhood memories and delicious cake. So i quickly got out my mixing bowls and got to work. I also took notice of the extra tips and helpful hints from reviews and ratings thinking that would make my cake all the better, NOT A CHANCE!! This is by far the worst recipe i have seen and will never suggest it to another living being. How anyone ever got a cake out of this is pretty darn surprising to me. Thanks but no thanks.

I added a box of instant vanilla pudding and decreased the sugar by 1/2 cup like someone suggested earlier.  I also added 2T canola oil.  This was the most moist cake I have ever eaten...this is the 3rd time I have baked it this week.  Everyone at work is crazy for it.  I use a cooked fudge chocolate icing for the cake. Also..people who say it is dry: check your cake after 20 min!  Mine is usually done by then.  Thank you for posting this recipie!!!!

I feel bad giving this cake a 1 star, however, I followed the recipe exactly this afternoon. I read previous reviews so I knew what others did, but I tried to make this just like the recipe stated. I'm not sure where I went wrong. The boiling water at the end seemed strange, but I've made other cakes with a runny batter, so I though I would keep going as the recipe stated. I put the cake in the oven and checked on it half way through and was SHOCKED to see a mess in my oven. The cake had boiled over into a not so fun mess. Needless to say, I'm cake-less this afternoon. Thankfully, it wasn't for a birthday or anything important. I was just looking for something new to try. I don't think I will try this again.

After reading some of the reviews, I added around 2 tbsp. of vegetable oil to the batter before cooking and it turned out really yummy.  Not dry, no resemblance to corn bread.  I put a caramel frosting on it and it's super delicious.

Considering the fact that I am not a fan of white/yellow cakes, I am very pleased with the texture and moistness of this cake. Like others, I did not add the baking soda to the buttermilk. Instead, added it in with the other dry ingredients. I chose to use up some butter flavored Crisco (I had leftover from all my Christmas goodies) in place of the shortening as well.  Didn't have what I needed on hand to make frosting but the cake is still yummy! Thanks for the recipe.

This cake turned out so delicious it did not last long at all! I used the suggestion to use sour milk (milk+ vinegar) instead of buttermilk and i think the sour milk caused the cake to be lighter than it would have been otherwise.  It was not light and fluffy but yummy and dense almost like pound cake consistency but very moist and unlike some of the other reviewers, my cake came out completely white not yellowish. Good luck with this one it is yummy and tasty and delicious!

I was so exicted to try this cake , even though the ingredients seemed...odd a little.The reviews for this cake are so great I figured I'd try something new. I had never made a  cake that felt or tasted so oily. It's over sweet and that's probably the reason it doesn't taste too bad.Very disappointing :(

This tasted ok but was so dry, even when fresh out of the oven.  The next day I threw the rest away it had the consistancy of tough dry cornbread. Sorry, not a keeper for this cake baker!

I made this into a very good orange cake by adding the juice and zest of one orange to the cake and icing it with cream cheese icing that included 3 tbsp orange marmelade.  It was moist, delicious, and very popular.  I found that this cake does not rise very high, but if it is not overbaked it makes a nice moist cake that cuts very well.

Needed a quick recipe for white cake. Found this one and tried it, as promised, quick and very good too. I used some special recipe make of brandy to wet the cake and made it very moist. It tasted delicious. Thanks for the recipe. :)

This is a super delicious cake.  Very, very moist.  I have served it a couple of times to several different people, all with rave reviews!  I will definitely make this cake again and throw out all my other white cake recipes.  I highly recommend!  Thanks Aunt Bert!

The cake was very, VERY dense and had an overwhelming flour tast, and was almost rubbery. I was looking for a new recipe for my cake business and this is not it.

This was a very mild cake which was exactly what I was looking for. My son (9) made most of it, the recipe was very easy to make. It smelled and tasted great. Will definitely keep this in my recipe box. Thank you for sharing

LOVE THIS CAKE!! I've been looking forever for a white cake. I've found it in this recipe. The cake does turn out a little "yellow" since it has egg yolks but it is so delicious I am stopping my search for the perfect white cake. I typically don't change people's recipes so I make this cake as written. Sometimes I add another tsp. of vanilla but that's the only change I make. Thank you for sharing this great cake recipe.

Very nice cake. Not sure what the drama is some are having with the thin batter.  I always like hot water batters since they are sure to turn out.The allow for maximum raise.  I added 1 cup  of coconut and used 4 egg whites and it was a nice moist cake. As a rule,scratch cakes are heavier than box...but scratch cakes are "real" anyway!...right?

I absolutely loved this recipe. I made a couple of suggestions that other people have made. I added 4 whole eggs instead of three yolks and an egg. I also added one box of french vanilla pudding and 2T canola oil. This had an amazing flavor and was very moist.

This cake came out like bread pudding. Soggy, stodgy, heavy yck. I made the cake last night cutting the sugar in half and adding the pudding mix and 2 T canola oil as others had described doing.  I don't know how others got such good results. No one could eat it and it was for a birthday. boo hoo.

THIS WAS A WONDERFUL CAKE! u know i was kind of scared of what it was going to taste like, sence i didn't have vanilla extract i added lemon and it tasted really really really good. This batter came out perfect and the cake when it came out of the oven wasnt all pretty like a box cake would be, But once i put the cream cheese frosting .. it was WONDERFUL! , i only put 2 eggs because i was running out of eggs and it came out perfect. Definitly try it with cream cheese icing.. and again i put lemon attrect in that too, cause i didnt have vanilla and came out just perfect. .. DEFINITLY TRY THIS CAKE! u cant screw it up !

I'll have to agree with one of the other reviews that this cake resembled sweetened cornbread.  Although, people in my family seem to like that taste, as it disappeared in about two days.  I'll probably make it once in awhile for school and work lunches.

I had a recipe that I was doing that called for a white box mix (which I didn't have so I tried this one) and I changed a few things, changed buttermilk into sour cream (as per recipe that I was using this for) and I like mayonaise instead of oil, and used whole eggs because I didn't care what color it was (only two though). I liked it, would do it again, I did a it in 2 round pans and made four layers out of it with a cranberry/pineapple filling with a creamcheese frosting. Was great.

A very moist cake.   The moistness does make it a little crumbly and hard to get out of the pan, so be sure to grease the bottom of the pan well.  But it's worth it for this good cake.

My cub scout son (age 8) needs to bring a cake for a special dinner tomorrow night. He made this cake with a little help from me. We both thought it was easy and it tastes GREAT! We'll do this again! The person who said it tasted terrible must have made a mistake in assembling the ingredients or something. I also found the cake light, not heavy. I guess it depends how much you beat it. I used an electric mixer. I'd recommend this cake to you!

I'm not sure what some people were complaining about.  This is a yummy cake.  Yes, it's heavy like a pound cake.  I add about 3/4 cup more buttermilk and it was very moist.  Everyone at the party like it and believe me, the put it like it is.  I'd know if anyone didn't like it and what they didn't like!

I was suprised to read the other comments..I returned to the site today to re-get the recipe, as we made it for my daughter's birthday and it went over like wildfire...everyone loved it! It was a very rich heavy cake, but reminded me of several depression era recipes that my grandmother would make. Oh well beauty is in the eye of the beholder (or taster).  I'm off to make a second one!

This is a nice, moist cake, and provides a great base from which to create all kinds of great flavor combinations, or just to enjoy as a simple white cake. I halved the recipe, which yielded 11 cupcakes. I used all ingredients as stated, except for using unsalted butter in place of shortening. My only other deviation was to add the baking soda in with the dry ingredients, as I do with all my other cake recipes, rather than mix it with the buttermilk. There was no cornbread taste or consistency, as a few others have mentioned. That could be the result of over mixing. Once you begin to add the dry ingredients, mix only enough to incorporate. Mixing too much will give you a tough cake. The cupcakes were tender and moist, though a little on the sweet side. Next time I will back off the sugar a bit as I plan to add a strawberry filling and top with strawberry cream cheese icing - yum!

I would love to have given this recipe 5 stars however, the way the list of ingridents is done it can be confussing.  You have to go step by step and then find the ingrendents you need as they are not listed in use.   Saying that I found the cake to be moist and super flavour.  I had done a minor change drop the vanilla by 1/2 and sugar a small amount and then added about 1 tbs spoon of maple sryup.  This gave the cake a mild maple flavour which is what I wanted.

My new favorite cake recipe! I try to avoid making cakes from scratch, because honestly, box cakes always seem to have a better texture. This was a definite exception. Delicious, moist, FLUFFY cake. I used coconut milk and vinegar instead of buttermilk, and stirred the baking soda in with the dry ingredients

This cake has WAY too much sugar... not sure how it comes out for the other reviewers, but the amount of sugar actually ruined my entire cake. Perhaps it comes out differently when you use shortening (not an ingredient I would EVER use in baking) but when you use all butter, this recipe is not my favorite by any stretch of the imagination. Thanks anyways tho!

I love this recipe, I followed similar modifications as Trish did, 1/2 cup less sugar, I added to the dry ingredients a box of vanilla pudding mix, and lowered the egg to 2 whole eggs. I ran out of my vanilla extract, so instead I added almond extract. all I can say is....YUMMMM!!!  it was a total Hit, so moist and delicious...this recipe is definitely a keeper.

The taste is delicious, like a nice sugar cookie.  I followed the advice of others and did the egg whites at the end.  I was disappointed in how HEAVY this cake was.  I will not make it again.

This cake is good even though I misunderstood the recipe.  I sifted the dry ingredients together like it said which normally includes the soda.  I had read over it, but was thinking more of souring the milk.  When it came time to add the soda, I had already added the soda to my dry ingredients. It's good even though I did it wrong.  I made the proper notes on my printed version and when I try it again, I will repost.

I am only giving this 4 stars, not because it wasn't good, but because it isn't a "white" cake.  The flavor was good but the texture, density and color was not at all what I expected or was looking for.  The fact that this cake had so many egg yolks should have tipped me off but I went ahead and made it anyway.  It was a very good cake, just, in my opinion, is a "yellow" cake, not white.

People are loving or hating this--I'm closer to love.  Delicate flavor, nice texture, classic vanilla cake.  I followed recommendations and used 2 whole eggs and 2 yolks, and doubled the vanilla.  Made it into cupcakes and they worked beautifully.

I don't know where I went wrong in making this but it tasted too eggy. And I cut back on the eggs! I don't know what recipe the picture used but it wasn't this one. I was disappointed to say the least. Thanks anyway though.

Followed the recipe exactly and the cake did not rise. The cake tastes ok but it is flat. Not even worth frosting. With all of the leavening in this cake it should have risen. Maybe the yolks should be whites. I am not going to experiment to get this cake to work.

There should be a warning about how runny this batter is.  I'll never make this in a pan with removable bottoms. Enough said. I'll try it again eventually, in a regular 9x13 pan.

I made this recipe exactly as instructed and it was dense and rubbery.  I checked the oven temperature with a thermometer and it was accurate.  The leavening (baking powder & baking soda) has not expired and works fine in other recipes so I have NO IDEA what went wrong.  How anyone can get this recipe to work is a mystery to me.  I gave it two stars instead of one because if you pretend it's a vanilla brownie and ignore the strange texture it tastes pretty good.

I followed the first review of this recipe, adding a pack of pudding mix and 2 T of vegetable oil, and the cake is GREAT! It did turn out yellow, not white, but it's wonderfully moist and delicious. Plus, you can pick which flavor pudding to add to slightly flavor the cake!

Loved the taste of the cake.  I made on small mistake when I did not take the cakes out of the pans quick enough, they stuck!  And I was making a b-day cake for a party that started in 2 hrs. I tried to mush the broken off parts pack on and then I covered in alot of icing.  Everyone loved it!!!!

I made this for my daughter's end of season volleybally party.  Everyone loved it.  I lowered the temperature 25 degrees because I made it in glass, but it wasn't quite done in center and had to cook another 5 minutes.  Next time I won't adjust temp.  It's a nice, moist cake, with a great taste.  I topped it with a cream cheese icing.

This cake was easy to make and was very rich and moist.  My company loved it.  I even made my own buttermilk from a recipe on the net.  I didn't put any frosting on it.  I just put some cool whip and strawberries out and let everyone help themselves to put any on top.  Although, the cake seemed more "yellow" than "white" but nonetheless, it was still yummy.

This was an awful cake! It was the worst cake I have ever tasted! After making this cake I distrust allrecipe.com, and vow not to use their recipes. I think the yolks were supposed to be whites. It had no flavor at all, fell in the oven, was spongy, stuck like glue to my cake pan, making it crumble out of the pan, ruining my dessert completly. I am very angry at Aunt Bert right now and give you good warning, this cake is !

I have this cake in the oven now, at the request of my mother.  I've made it countless times - all sizes, from cupcakes to my mother's full sized wedding cake.  I've always made it just as the recipe states, and NEVER had a problem.  It is dense, and very moist.  My husband, who is chocolate cake purist, will eat, and more importantly enjoy eating, this cake.  For every event I've used this cake recipe (I'm not a baker by profession, just a baker/cake decorator by hobby), people have loved it and remarked it is one of or the best white cake they've tasted.  The color is not "white" for those who are looking for a pure white color for decorating purposes (because of the yolks), but it hasn't been a problem for me.

This is the best cake I've ever made.  I took the advice of a few other reviewers and used milk and vinegar for sour milk instead of buttermilk.  I also used 3 whole eggs and one egg white, and 2 tsp of vanilla instead of one.  Oh, and for some reason I didn't notice the 1/2 tsp salt on my phone as I was making it, so I mistakenly left that out.  Everything else I left the same.  I didn't think it would turn out well because the batter was really thin, but it ended up being the best cake I've ever made.  I frosted it with butter cream frosting- 1 cup butter, 1lb confection sugar, 1 Tbsp milk, 1 Tbsp meringue powder.

This is a nice, light and spongy cake with a very good flavor. The only thing I did differently was to use 4 whole eggs, rather than one egg and 3 egg yolks, simply because I didn't want to waste the whites. I followed the advice of another cook and frosted with the buttermilk sauce recipe on the Old-Fashioned Apple Cake recipe on this site. Very good.

A great cake recipe. I didn't have buttermilk, or even regular milk, so I replaced the buttermilk with 1/2 cup coconut milk combined with a tablespoon of lemon juice. I only used 3/4 a cup of water, and I used water that was just very hot out of the tap. I also added about a cup of coconut flakes and an extra quarter cup of flour, because the batter felt quite runny. I also baked it as cupcakes... it baked for about 18-20 minutes and they came out nearly perfect. An absolutely wonderful recipe that's quite versatile.

Excellent taste as well as very moist BUT suggest only using the 13x9" pan that as stated in the recipe.  I used two 9" pans to make a layer cake and the cake fell apart when taking it from the pans.

I followed some of the other suggestions, and used 2 whole eggs and 2 egg yolks, and instead of using butter milk used sour milk made by 1/2 cup of milk with 1 tbsp of vinegar. Cakes turned out v ery good. Thank you for the recipe.

The first time I tried this recipe the cake never rose.  I mixed the baking soda and buttermilk after I finished creaming the shortening mixture and then immediately poured it in.  I don't think that the baking soda had enough time to react.  I also tried it with the 3 eggs and an egg white.  It seemed really eggy tasting.  The cake came out the best when I followed the recipe exactly, but cut back on the sugar to 1 1/2 c.

This cake turned out very moist and tasted great.  I used the White Cake Frosting I recipe for the frosting.  I made for a very delicious cake.

I had to readjust the recipe and change some ingredients but the end result was beyond perfection. I am not sure if the original recipe is good because I usually readjust all the recipes I find but try it out.

I followed this recipe exactly.  I was a little nervous because the batter seemed a bit runny.  However, the end result was delicious.  Instead of making a cake, I made cupcakes and iced them with "Chocolate Frosting III."  I made them for both my husband and I to bring to work, and they were devoured!  Everyone raved about them!

I think those are supposed to be egg WHITES because the cake turned out really heavy and spongy.  I didn't care for it.

I finished the cake with warm apricot preserves instead of a frosting, and also added lemon extract along with the vanilla extract.  Rose very well,  subtle sweetness.

Not for an inexperienced baker. As to the cake itself, it tasted fine. It isn't a white cake. It's a yellow cake. As some of the other reviews have pointed out, the cake is oily. The outer crust does have a cornbread-like texture, although icing will soften that.  I made the cake just for myself for practice. I wouldn't serve it to anyone else. without modifying the recipe. The picture that the site displays next to the recipe is deceptive.  If you follow the recipe, your cake will look nothing like that. 

The reviews are also deceptive. Most of the four and five star reviews are by experienced bakers that know how to modify the recipe to improve it.  Why didn't these people post their own recipes with the correct ingredients and instructions?

Heavy yellow cake.  I hate it .  What a waste of time. Kids ate the icing and threw it away.  There is no way 4 egg yokes will make a white cake.

This is my favorite from scratch white cake! It's the only one I ever make now.  It's so moist and flavorful.  I pretty much follow the recipe exactly.  I do add 3 whole eggs and 1 egg white.   One time when I was using this recipe for a coconut cream poke cake, I substituted 1 1/2 tsp coconut extract for the vanilla as well as one cup of boiled coconut milk instead of the boiling water. Delish!

After reading all the reviews, made the cake exactly as wrote. I greased the pan well and did however check at the 25 minute mark and found the cake to be ready. The cake itself came out white and had a moist pound cake texture, delicious in taste and not a bit grainy at all. I am planning on making it again for my daughter's birthday cake and would highly recommend this recipe for those looking for an authentic old fashioned cake recipe.

I just finished making this cake and I like others made a few changes, I used 2 large eggs instead of dividing them.  I have been having problems finding a lemon poppyseed cake that I liked so I added a half cup of boiling water to a 1/2 cup of fresh squeezed lemon juice.  I added the poppyseeds to the dry ingredients.  It turned out to be just what I was looking for!

This is great if your just doing a plain white cake. however i've also tried to make this with chocolate chips and the chips fell to the bottom of the pan because the batter was so thin.

Terrible! The cake was awful. I really think the proportions were wrong somewhere. Everything seemed to be good until adding the boiling water. I'm wondering if only 1/2 cup should be added. The cake took forever to bake, was an odd consistency, and tasted terrible. Also, it wasn't anything close to a white cake! By the time the cake finished baking, it was dark brown. 

I followed the recipe to the letter and I'm a pretty good scratch baker. This recipe isn't one I'll be keeping.

I knew I was in trouble when I added the cup of boiling water and the batter became extremely thin.  I baked this as cupcakes and they barely rose.  The cake was very spongy.   The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the flavor was good.  I wouldn't make this again.  There are too many other good recipes out there!

I tried this recipe and was making it for my boyfriend's birthday. I read the reviews and while there were good and bad ones I decided to go ahead and take a chance.  This was a very dense cake that turned out tasting like CORNBREAD!! Will definitely not try this one again!

It is a great recipe! Works perfect! My family love it. Super moist! I just made a few changes: I substituted 1/4 cup shortening for 1/4 cup vegetable oil.  I used 3 whole eggs and 2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and only 1 1/2 cup of Sugar.

Thanks.

This particular cake was great! People in my household loved it. The only thing that was odd was adding the water. When it baked, it worried me because it smelled like Dutch Babies(Egg Bread). i had to let it set for a while because it had a strange look to it on the top and it took a bit longer to cook. I will use again but probably try and change a few things.

My search for a white cake recipe stops here. Thanks:) For me it turned out light, fluffy and moist. There may be something to placing the baking soda in the buttermilk!!  I used sour cream cause that's what I had,  but it bubbled right up!! Also used melted butter and a one bowl method for mixing (i'm lazy). So dry ingredients in,  all liquid less butter and boiling water in and once just incorporated,  added the melted butter so as not to cook the egg, then boiling water!  Fabulous recipe :) Thanks Aunt Bert and Tari!

I followed the recipe to a T, except I used 2 whole eggs. It tasted great, topped with cream cheese frosting and walnuts.

This cake was ok, was a bit eggy and dense for my taste but my family liked it.  I was going for a lighter, fluffier cake so will keep looking.

Great cake, it was moist and dense enough to be iced without crumbs. I used only one egg and used egg replacer in place of the other eggs (my daughter has a minor egg allergy). I have baked a lot of cakes and this will be my new favourite. Try with layers of lemon curd.

I love white cake, it is my Favorite and this just didn't even come close to being what I was hoping it would be!  The 3 egg yolks make it more yellow then white and it just didn't thrill me with flavor.  Sorry aunt bert!

Absolutley delicous! I was so proud of myself and so was my family. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. It was light,moist and tasted like a old fashioned vanilla cake. I paired it with hershey's classic  chocolate frosting. The batter looks watery but it works, I wouldn't use a springform pan

This cake is excellent in terms of being moist and flavor full but it is an extremely dense cake with more of a sponge texture. I' not a fan of the density of the cake but I love the favor. I've made this cake as a cupcakes which it is far better as cupcakes then a cake! Today I made this cake and I completely FORGOT to add the vanilla but the cake came out delish anyways even without the vanilla!!

I thought this recipe is great.  I just made it and it awesome.  It does look a little more yellow than white but the taste is great. I only made to changes, I used sour milk instead of buttermilk because I didn't have any and I used 2 teaspoons vanilla because I love vanilla. I didn't have any problems and I am a beginner at this baking stuff.

I'd really like to know why this cake seems to be either a complete hit, or a complete miss -- mine was a miss.  I only substituted equivalent egg whites for the egg yolks, because I wanted a white cake.  It was flat and way too sweet.  Had to throw it out and make another (different recipe).

I am not a good baker at all but I made cupcakes with this recipe and they turned out awesome!  Super moist, great texture and flavor.  I did use 2 whole eggs and added a packet of vanilla pudding.    Can't wait to try different variations with different flavors of pudding.  For cupcakes I baked for 20 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

I must of done something terribly wrong, I will try this recipe one more time, maybe read more of the reviews and try some suggestions. I tryed makeing a home make whit cake years ago and had the same kind of results. Yet home make cohcolate cakes work every time for me, humm. But like I said, so many great reviews I will try this 1 more time.
