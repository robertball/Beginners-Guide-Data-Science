The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly and decided that I didn't like the nutmeg, nor did I like the texture and taste of the crab and shrimp. Now I use imitation crabmeat which does not disintegrate, and fresh chopped shrimp as the flavor is so much better. I must admit, I have never made it with fresh crabmeat, which I'm guessing would be even better. Thanks!

The bacon definately makes this recipe, I did not like the canned crabmeat and shrimp, I think that it would taste alot better if it were made with fresh crabmeat and shrimp...

Very good Verona! I love quiche and this was great! I added minced onion plus onion and garlic powders and used fresh shrimp in lieu of the canned. Served this with a yummy Arugala salad. Thanks so much!

Unless I am intrepreting this recipe wrong, there is no way all those ingredients are going to fit in one pie! I made one pie by cutting the half and half to one cup. I used fresh cooked shrimp and 2 cups of shredded cheddar and some powdered onion and garlic.  It baked one hour at 350.  It was O.K.

The quiche took three hours to cook! I followed the recipe to the letter. Probably too much cream, and not enough eggs. I would suggest 1.5 cups of cream and 5 eggs..

I used fresh crabmeat and cooked shrimp - had to omit the bacon b/c of Lent.  I didn't think the flavor tasted that great - maybe the bacon is what makes it. ???

I modified this quite a bit: I used frozen shrimp, cream, 2 eggs, and chopped jack cheese.  I added a pinch of chili pepper, black pepper, and sea salt.  Mixed.  Made hash browns from scratch with 3 small russet potatoes, sliced thin by hand, 2 TBSP minced onion and cooked stove top in peanut oil.  Pressed potatoes into bottom of loaf pan.  Poured mixture on top.  Placed remaining cheese on top.  Baked in toaster oven @375 for 45 minutes.  Bad photo quality above, though you get the idea: it came out great.  My wife loves it.  That makes the work worth while.  I hope this can be of some use to you, at the least some of it.  Do let me know what you think.

I don't use bacon, nutmeg or half and half, just milk and less than recipe says. I also add a dollop of dijon mustard, as well as cheddar cheese. The beauty of this recipe is its so adaptable to your own tastes. A good base to start with.YUMMY!

Too runny.  Decrease the milk/cream.  Also, if using a frozen crust, I suggest pre-baking a bit.  The bottom was a bit soggy, but that could be remedied if using less milk/cream.  I don't know.  Didn't use seafood, so can't commet on that.  I used bacon, and asparagus.  Flavors were good, but texture --!

Wow.  This is good!!! All I did differently was swap the Swiss cheese with Parmesan, canned mushrooms instead of fresh, and added a few drops of hot pepper sauce with hotter ground pepper... and a 1/2 cup of frozen spinach (only cuz I didn't have any veggies today).  The frozen of the spinach made it take 15 min longer to cook.  ... Oh yeah and I totally didn't read that part about the nutmeg til after I put in to bake, or the salt (oops!). But, hey:   WOW!

This recipe is a breeze to make and incredibly tasty. Once made, it is a very versatile main course for a breakfast or dinner. I opted not to use a crust, since the the bacon on the bottom helps to stabilize the quiche all by itself (thus cutting some carbs and calories). I also decided to add in some chopped bell peppers for a little color.

Whenever I make this it's gone before I finish my first slice. Using fresh seafood instead of canned would make this a definite 5 star, though I admit that using canned makes the prep so much easier I don't think I'd bother with fresh seafood unless I had a very special guest.

Not only did I love it, the guest  my daughter's graduation brunch loved it too!!  I added a bit more crab and shrimp to so it bubbled over and probably added to the cook time.  It also made the dish really rich and filling.  I recommend cutting small slices so everyone gets a taste

I made this today and foolishly did not read reviews beforehand. First off- Half and half- 2 cups is way too much. I had a milky watery mess. I kept it in the oven a full 30 minutes, but this did not help.  I did use fresh cooked medium shrimp and real lump crab. I can taste some parts that have good texture, and it is delicious.  Next time- because there will be a next time, I'll cut the cream to half.

I used it as the basis for using my leftover seafood chowder which had lobster, crab, scallops, clams, mahi mahi and swordfish.  Used the liquid from the chowder in place of the cream.  Turned out beautifully.

I only used about 6 slices of bacon, 1 cup of half and half, substituted scallops for shrimp and used sharp white cheddar and Parmesan cheese instead of Swiss. I don't think you need to add the teaspoon of salt.  My son actually LOVED it and my husband thought it was really good too.  But for me, it was just too salty.
