I used a large head of cauliflower and hoped there would be enough cheese sauce.  After tasting the cheese sauce with raw cauliflower, it wasn't very flavorful.  I added some onion and garlic powder, and black pepper.  After layering everything I gave a heavy dash of smoked paprika to the top.  It took nearly 50 minutes to bake and after cooling slightly the layers separated.  Cheesy cauliflower goop on top  and watered cream on the bottom.  Family was divided on whether they liked it - it was the texture of the cheese/cauliflower goop that threw them off.  After spending so much $ on ingredients I wasn't going to waste the half pan of leftovers so I ended up making a roux, adding chicken stock and milk and added the leftover casserole back in to warm.  I pur√©ed everything and we enjoyed this soup more than the original recipe.  Needless to say.....we won't make this again.
