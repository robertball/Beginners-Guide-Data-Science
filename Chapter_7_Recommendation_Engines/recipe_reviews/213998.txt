To make these with mini marshmallows: replace 1 cup mini marshmallows for every 10 large marshmallows.  So, for a single batch, use 3 cups mini marshmallows.
Today I made a double batch of these scrumptious sweets that combine two of my favorites, rice krispy treats and ice cream.  I divided the rice krispy mixture between two 13in. by 9in. pans, both lined with foil and sprayed with cooking spray.  I then froze one until soild, then spread the ice cream (I used chocolate chip) on top.  I inverted the rice krispy treats from the second pan on top of the ice cream and pressed it down good, then froze it until I was ready to serve it.  It was difficult to cut into nice squares this way, but if you want to make this recipe for a crowd on a very hot day and are worried about your ice cream melting while you're filling all of your sandwhiches, you might consider this method.
