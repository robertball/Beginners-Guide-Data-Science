I served this a couple times and it did not have a very good "eye appeal" so it was never well received - it's hard to make it look appetizing!  The flavor was fine, but it just didn't sell !

I just served this this past weekend and couldn't believe how quickly it was eaten. I added 2 cloves garlic, freshly ground black pepper and a dash of ceyanne pepper. I used it as a spread for the veggie platter, and I recieved so many compliments. I say try the basic recipe, but add things to make it your own.

This dip is amazing!  I also used sun-dried tomatoes that were not in oil, so I added a little drizzle of olive oil.  I also added about 1 tsp of minced garlic and about 1/4 tsp of onion powder.  Served with crunchy sesame sticks and cracked black pepper crackers - everyone loved it!  I will definitely make this again.

Great treat (non-sugary for a change!) for Hubs to take to the office that came together in a snap. I used the package of cream cheese as called for, but only added the other ingredients to taste, using somewhat less than called for and a small clove of minced garlic.  I pulsed it in the food processor just long enough so that it was still "whitish" but with flecks of the tomatoes and basil.  Beautiful. Delicious too. I served it with homemade crostini (cut small baguettes into 1/4" slices, brush each side lightly with olive oil. Season lightly with salt and pepper or garlic salt, if desired, and a dusting of freshly grated Parmesan.  Bake at 375* until golden brown.)

This is such a nice, easy recipe. I found it worked great when I needed a very last minute appetizer with very little time to make it in.

I thought it worked perfectly.  I only eyeballed the ingredients except the 8oz package of cream cheese.  Tasted really good.  I will admit that it didn't llok as colorful as the picture but right in line with any flavored cream cheese I bought in the store.  My only complaint is that if it tastes as good as store bought and looks like it, why did I bother?

I really liked this dip, and it went really well at a potluck party. I used more cream cheese than the recipe calls for (about 1.5 bars of the lowfat), lots more garlic and a pinch of pepper. Taste great with crackers or homemade pita chips.

The easiest dip to make. Served with crackers at a party for an alternative to a cheese spread. I agree with the previous comment - the appearance of this is not very appealing, but the taste is definitely worth it! Maybe dress it up with some fresh basil sprinkled over the top when done? I love the short ingredient list, and the unique flavor had me coming back for seconds, thirds, etc...

This tasted great the second time I made it, I had glanced at the recipe and bought sun dried tomatoes but not in oil.  My husband blended the ingredients and it was super salty.  Then we looked at what we did wrong.  Make sure to wash the tomatoes that aren't in oil if you happen to get the ones in a bag and not in oil.

OK, we made it again and it was a HIT.  Use the tomatoes in oil.  It was so freakin' good.  So easy and people thought it was some high falootin' recipe.  So thank you for posting this.

I thought this was a great dip!  I did take the suggestion from another reviewer and added garlic (1 clove), salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper.  I served it with Melba toast.

I served this at a ladies' luncheon, and we really enjoyed this dip.  I only gave it 3 stars because it is not visually appealing.  A tasty dip!

I didn't have sun dried tomatoes in oil, but had some without and I used fresh basil from my garden--I also added 1/4 tsp of garlic salt and 1/4 tsp of onion powder.  It's delicious!
