Delicious.. make this right away! This first time I made this I had some hot chili peanuts with lime and I really loved the way the lime accented the dish.  The second time I used regular peanuts and added a squeeze of fresh lime juice. The second time I added more green veggies.. I like more veggies .

This was amazing.  I am a vegetarian and substituted the chicken for smoked tofu - turned out awesome.  I also ran out of sesame oil so substituted peanut oil instead, shelled the edamame from the frozen steamer packs from Costco, used crunchy peanut butter in the sauce, and dry roasted peanuts instead if blanched on top after it was warmed up (gotta use what ya got!) I portioned it out into 6 whole bowls and kept in fridge for up to 4 days.  Took this for lunch and it was so so so good.  Healthy, filling, flavourful and packed with protein.

After reading all the "I made it" reviews and considering the comments that the recipe was bland I looked at a few other recipes online and made a couple alterations to the sauce and kicked it up a notch. Instead of the chile sauce I used approximately 3 tablespoons of Sriracha Sauce, 4 cloves of minced garlic, 3 tablespoons of fresh ginger, red pepper flakes (to taste) and just about a 1/2 fresh squeezed lime. As for the veggies you can use whatever you have in your fridge. Before serving  squeeze the remaining lime, stir and add 3 chopped scallions. I also did not use the cilantro and peanuts because I did not have any; and used smooth peanut butter because that is what I had on hand.

Totally delicious and guilt-free!! I used a lot of ready made ingredients - shredded cabbage, matchstick carrots, frozen edamame, steamed broccoli, bottled pad thai sauce... really cuts down on prep time. I fry tofu in peanut oil in place of chicken. Use four eggs. Use the whole broccoli floret (the flower is the healthy part anyway!). Flavorful and filling!

Actualy more a 4 and a half star for me because I found it better with less quinoa and more veggies, less garlic and more lime and peanut butter - but it is all about personal taste, so this is a good basic recipe. I brought it to a friend who is not used to exotic food and as is she liked it very much. I had taken with me extra siracha-lime powder to add as taste. Next time I made it with shrimps instaed of chicken and as it happenned that I had no water chestnuts can in my pantry, I replaced it by hearts of palms and it was as good as the first time.

Great recipe for finishing up some odds and ends: I used some coleslaw mix, shredded carrots, a small orange pepper, increased the peanut butter, and sesame oil. Would probably cut back on the amount of quinoa and increase the vegetables next time.

Loved this!  Topped with more green onions and sriracha to taste.  Next time I would either double the edamame or add some sliced water chestnuts for more crunch.  I may try it with rice noodles instead of quinoa (for those in the family who are not crazy about quinoa).   Definitely will be making this  again.

Made this as per the recipe and it turned out great!  My whole family loved it including my picky seven year old.  The crunchy peanuts on top made it even better.

This was a nice solid recipe. Loved the level of spice/heat, liked that it is healthy. I made it as called for, but next time think I would make double the sauce so it is a little more saucy (or use a little less quinoa). 

I will likely make this again even though it felt like I was doing quite a bit of chopping.  However, that actually makes it a great "prep-ahead" type recipe though...just cut everything the day or weekend in advance and then toss everything together as called for. I would think it would come together pretty quickly that way and make it an easy-ish weeknight recipe. 

The edamame I bought was still in the shell...somehow missed that when i purchased it. (Oops!) So, that took extra time shelling them. But, oh well.  

It does make A LOT so be prepared to feed a crowd, or cut the recipe in half.

Wow! So great! I made it as is and LOVED it. Plus, it made a ton. My only tip is one that most people who don't have much time already know, and that's to buy a bag of mixed shredded carrots and shredded broccoli stems to save some time (I think I used the 365 Brand from Whole Foods).  Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

I didn't care for this recipe. Separately, I love all these ingredients. Together, I didn't really care for the texture, and it was also quite salty. For the amount of time this took with the prep, there are other Thai recipes I'd rather focus on.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!! Opted out on quinoa, went for the rice noodles, which meant I could also skip the chicken broth and the first step (with the exception of cooking the noodles to package directions, of course). Surprised I didn't see bean sprouts in this recipe...I thought that was iconic to pad thai! I sprung for the shrimp because it was on sale, sauteed them off real quick and followed the rest of the recipe to the letter.....BIG. FAMILY. HIT. I will make sure, however, next time I add the bean sprouts!

So good!  Two cups of quinoa though?  I only added one after it was cooked. Also, next time I'd add larger amounts of the veggies.

I made a couple changes (cooked in a crockpot, substituted the vegetables in the recipe with whatever was in my freezer, added pineapple and coconut milk, and didn't measure the spices), but this is my husband's new favorite recipe--which says a lot!

I browned the quinoa in butter before adding the home made chicken stock. I didn't have edamame or  broccoli, so used red pepper. The sauce is delicious and pulls together the dish with a nice heat. Will definitely make again!

I didn't have chili garlic sauce or cilantro. I used a little oyster sauce instead. And used rice instead of quinoa.

We make this with shrimp and it’s delicious! We use a less chili garlic sauce and add some brown sugar to make it a little more kid friendly and the whole family devours it!!

My family and I love this recipe and make it on Sundays for the upcoming weeks lunches.  I like to replace the peanuts with cashews and will sometimes put it on spring mix lettuce for a cold salad.  The lime is a must!

Absolutely fabulous! Only change I made is added some onion and garlic while cooking the quinoa. I'll be using this recipe a lot in the future!!

Omg, I'm blown away!!  And so was everyone else who ate it!  I think it might be the best Pad Thai I've had.
I did make a few changes.  I wanted to double the recipe, and based on reviews, I doubled everything but the quinoa, which was a good call.  So much quinoa! (also, I quadrupled the broccoli.)  
I also added a red pepper, and an onion.  I didn't feel like edamame, and I hate cilantro, so I didn't add those ingredients.  I also just served it on a bed of quinoa, rather than mixing it all together, just my preference.  
I absolutely LOVED this dish, and I'm definitely going to make this on a regular basis.  Big thanks to the user who shared it!: :)

I used shrimp instead of chicken, but, since that was given as an option at the top of the recipe, I do not believe that is against the "rules" of following instructions exactly to do a rating.  I also had to omit the garlic because of an allergy, but I try not to base my ratings on that omission because I've gotten used to the lack of garlic.  This is a REALLY good recipe but there is WAY too much quinoa.  Half of the quinoa would be plenty.  This is why I went with four stars instead of five.  It is a little bit  spicy for my taste, but I'm a wimp.

Delicious! it may be a little too nutty for some as it was for my father in-law. Absolutely healthier than the traditional noodle pad Thai and in my opinion so much tastier!

Quinoa works perfectly for this recipe. You won't miss the traditional noodles.

So good! Made this for the first time tonight and we both went back for seconds...not because we were still hungry but because it was so good! Doubled the chicken and used white wine vinegar instead of rice but it still turned out amazing!!

DON’T need that much quinoa… only need 1 or 1.5 cups at most.
Used 2 chicken breasts (cut diagonally). 
Added:  sliced baby bella mushrooms, thinly sliced red pepper, bean sprouts, sliced sweet onion 
For the sauce, added approx. 1 TBSP fish/oyster sauce and sriracha/red chili flakes 
Only used 2 eggs

This is the best Pad Thai recipe I've made yet! It's my favorite Thai dish and this is the best fresh recipe I've made. It was easy to substitute the hot ginger sauce with fresh ginger and spiracha sauce. I also used amino acid as substitute for soy sauce. I also loved it with quinoa!

I followed others advice and added more veggies. Didn't have edamame subbed peas. I cheated and bought broccoli slaw that had carrots and cabbage. I also used shrimp instead of chicken. It was so yummy, will defintely make his again.

Made this recipe as is, except for the amount of quinoa (halved it, based on others suggestions).  I also added half of an onion, thinly sliced. Will definitely be making again, but will double the amount of edamame/cabbage and add an extra egg.  A lime for garnish sounds great too.   Delicious

There's too much quinoa and not enough veggies. Add lots more veggies.
