I am from Spain and Pil Pil in dishes mostly means having parsley. You could just add a tbs of chopped fresh parsley, to see if it's closer to what you enjoyed there.

I would cut the garlic in half next time.  I did not have sweet paprika, only regular paprika.  I didn't know if this was the same thing so I was afraid to put in 3 whole tablespoons of it.  I used a 1/4 tsp of paprika.  It made a nice little sauce to add over fettucine.  One kid liked it, one definitely did not (too spicy) and I'm sitting on the fence.

Love this dish!  It is so easy.  I like to make extra sauce and serve it over angel hair pasta or rice.  I didn't have cayenne pepper on hand but a few dashes of hot sauce (like Frank's) and some crushed red pepper are good alternatives.

Love this recipe. Quick and full of garlic deliciousness! If you're not gluten-free, make sure to have a baguette on hand to dunk in the remaining sauce.

Divine dish! If you can get fresh local garlic, it tastes even better. Hubby loves it. Served over fresh baby spinach with a nice Spanish white wine.
