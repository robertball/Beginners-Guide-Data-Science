No I did not make any changes.   It is for dessert after dinner. Don't see any reason why they wouldn't be great. Yes, I would make again.

Baking time is way off. After adding an additional 20 minutes or so, it ended up like molten cake- very gooey in the center, crisp exterior.

The baking time is  way off,  I added  another 15 minutes onto  40 minutes  and the centre was still not cooked when I checked with a toothpick.  Not sure if I will make again.

Wow! All I can say is Super Yummy! Had to bake for one hour and they turned out even better than I imagined. Iâ€™ll definitely be making these lots more.

First of all, I cooked it for an extra 15 minutes because I did not use gluten free flour. This recipe was...disappointing. It wasn't all I thought it would be. Overall, it was kind of bland. It's not bad, it's just not as good as I was hoping it would be. The cherry cheesecake part might be good with a different brownie recipe, though.

Co-workers and family all loved these. The only changes I made was that I used a box brownie mix due to time constraints and when using the cherry pie mix I used the cherries and the filling. Yes, they came out really gooey in the middle but that's what everyone loved about them! Kind of like a lava cake. I have had several people ask for the recipe and one request to bring them to the next work event. Yes, this one is a keeper!
