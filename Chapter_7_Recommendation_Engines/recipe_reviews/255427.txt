This was so good! Restaurant worthy for sure. I would expect this level of flavor in the finest establishments. However, the exception to that sentiment is the instant potatoes. No matter what brand, they have that "fake" flavor. It isn't worth the time savings. There were plenty of potatoes left over, and we put them down the garbage disposal. It is the pork chops/mushrooms/sauce that get five stars from me. My husband yum-yummed his way through 3 chops! It was so simple, quick, and easy yet tastes like you spent hours developing the flavors. This is going in my regular rotation for sure!

Loved, Loved, Loved these pork chops!   The combination of herbs and sherry gave the sauce and chops a wonderful complex flavor.    I took the suggestion in the review of Kim's Cooking Now and removed my garlic after it was in the butter and oil for a few minutes and then added it back later so it didn't burn.   My pork chops were very thick and were not done at the end of the suggested cooking time, so,  I put the chops into a 350 oven until they reached 145 degrees.   They were perfectly moist and juicy.   I am typically not a fan of instant potatoes, but, the Idahoan potatoes had very good flavor and I would use them again if I was restricted on time.  Thanks for the recipe!

This dish was absolutely amazing! The Idahoan Signature Russets are perfect. They come out so much better than other instant potatoes. Also the pork chops have awesome flavor. Definitely a winner in this household.

excellent.  I added the garlic and herbs at the same time as others suggested to keep the garlic from burning.   I made my own smashed potatoes but would be great with noodles as well.  Super quick and easy and very yummy

Great meal, and quick and easy enough for a weeknight! I only used 4 pork chops (for me, hubby and the two kids), and only made 4 servings of the Idahoan Signature™ Russets Mashed Potatoes (according to the directions on the packet). I kept the rest of the recipe ingredients the same. The pork was nice and tender, and the mushroom-herb-sherry gravy is delicious! I couldn't help but to pour a little of it over the mashed potatoes. The only thing I would do different next time, is add the garlic a little later in the process, or add it to flavor the butter/oil, then remove it and add it back at the end. Mine got a little too brown, during the cooking of the pork chops. Thanks for the recipe Jan!

Made this tonight. A yummy recipe that is company worthy, but quick and easy to make and clean up! I used the dried herbs (was sure to adjust accordingly) instead of fresh, but did not change the recipe. My husband said this one is a keeper. He said it had good flavor with no  one thing being overpowering.

The flavor of these pork chops was really good.  I rated it 4 stars because even though it says you can substitute dry ingredients, my dried herbs wound up really being easy to burn, and unappealing.  Next time I make it, I will be sure to use fresh herbs only.  I'm pretty sure it will knock it up to 5 starts.

I've made this twice now and it was delicious both times. For the fresh herbs I bought the "poultry blend," which has sage, rosemary and thyme in one package, and bought a bunch of fresh parsley. The potatoes were great too. The sauce was to die for.

I loved this recipe... very simple and delicious. The  Idahoan Signature™ Russets Mashed Potatoes work perfectly as a side dish blending with the sauce. I'm making this recipe in the future.

I loved the flavor in this. My guests did also. Here's how I did it. I used the oil & butter to brown the mushrooms, which I only halved, instead of sliced. Then I added the garlic & herbs & continued cooking for a few more minutes. Then I removed that from heat & put them in a bowl while I browned the very thick pork chops on both sides with more butter & oil. I finished the recipe as originally stated. The Idahoan Russet Potatoes were surprisingly like real potatoes, not instant! I will make this again.

I prepared this with 4 pork steaks exactly as written. This recipe was fast and delicious! My wife is a huge fan of potatoes in any form and she was impressed with the Idahoen  Russet. We never make instant potatoes but I think that's going to change from time to time now. Thank you for posting!
