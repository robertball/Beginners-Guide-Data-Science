Very simple, my husband thought it was unique and buttery! Added 1/2 tsp cream of tartar (per previous review). Thought it had a good look and taste for gift giving, with affordable ingredients. Will definitely make again. I put parchment paper in pan and sprinkled with powdered sugar. Also sprinkled with powdered sugar after it cooled.

This was okay. I was looking for teh butter scotch flavor but it doesn't really taste like that. It has a different kind of taste. I added 1/2 tsp. cream of tarter but I didn't see a difference in the taste or if it helped or not.

This scorches very quickly.  And is NOT butterscotch candy.  This tastes EXACTLY like toffe.  Nothing like butterscotch.

My first attempt at candy. VERY GOOD!  I was looking for a more natural candy - no artifical color or flavors, no gluten, corn syrup etc.  This fits the bill to a T.  I think I might add a tiny bit of salt next time.
