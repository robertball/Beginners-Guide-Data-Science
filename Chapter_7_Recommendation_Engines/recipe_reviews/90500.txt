UPDATE: I love, love this salad.  For the beets I like to roast them (as you would a potato-1 hour @ 450, wrapped whole in foil) then cubed marinated overnight in vinegar (balsalmic or red wine).  I also sub feta for the goat cheese.  9/15/2007:Whenever I go to Cheesecake Factory this is the salad I order.  Thank you so much for this recipe (its going to save me so much $ to make it at home).  The only changes I would make is to substitute pecans for the walnuts and add some roasted asparagus spears.

Very tasty.  For the dressing instead of OJ concentrate I used a sprits of regular OJ and it tasted just fine.  Combination of the goat cheese, beets, and nuts really pops your taste buds.  Loved it.

This recipes was awesome.  I used chilled canned beets instead of fresh beets and they were just as good.

I didn't have any walnuts, so I substituted pecans. Also, I left out the orange juice as I didn't have it but the magical mixture here is the beets/goat cheese/candied nuts. Absolutely heavenly salad!

great salad- a hit at a big summer potluck.  roasted the beets for 1 hour- 400 degrees.  doubled the walnuts, used feta cheese and added orange slices as well.  also- i just made a basic balsamic vinaigrette and added orange juice to the beets to give a citrus punch.

This recipe is very unique and flavorful.  Definitely 5 stars.  Took reviewers advice and used feta cheese.  No one will be disappointed with this recipe. Everyone absolutely loved it.

This was a great dish. I roasted the beets in the oven, used  warmed spinach instead of greens, and added a little port wine to the dressing instead of syrup. All these changes were made only because I make the recipe so much that I needed to change it up a bit. The original recipe is amazing as well.

This salad was excellent. I made it for Valentine's Day (cut the beets into heart shapes), and made it again with chicken for a main dish salad. Delish both times! I had no idea making candied walnuts was so easy, I'm glad I tried it. The dressing was easy and good also. The goat cheese is missing from the ingredients list but it's definitely worth including! Will make again.

Wonderfully festive! It is so tasty, that people who hate beets will reconsider. Beets took a little longer, more like 40 min. (until easily pierced with a knife) and I slipped the skins off after boiling. I used pecans (recommended from review) since I had them, and added arugula to the salad mix with a clove of garlic and S & P to the dressing. You cannot go wrong with this one! THANK YOU!

Excellent combination of flavors. I used canned beets to good effect, but it would have been better with fresh beets.

Great salad! The goat cheese and beets give this salad a farmers market feel. Earthy, Creamy, Tart and Sweet. The salad is simple and bursting with flavor.  Making the walnuts, I only had 2 Tbl of maple syrup so I added 1 Tbl of dark brown sugar to the pan and they were amazing. The walnuts were pretty tacky coming out of the pan, so I spread them out on a piece of wax paper and put in the freezer for 10 minutes which made them brittle and much easier to break up into pieces.   For the dressing, I used an empty Eggo Syrup perfect pour - no drip container, put the OJ concentrate, Olive Oil and Balsamic in it and shook. This way I didn't dirty a whisk or a bowl and it was conveniently in a container for next time. Also, I made sure not to thaw the OJ concentrate out completely - just enough to resemble the consistency of a thick milk shake. That way when you add the balsamic and olive oil the dressing becomes slightly creamy (from the oil solidifying).

Fabulous salad.  I roasted my beets (wash, cut in half,  wrap in foil, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with kosher salt -- bake 2 hour at 400  -  cool and peel).  Made dressing with fresh o.j.  The salad was superb.  I ate enough to count it as a whole meal.  Walnuts were a must have grand touch.  I would be proud to serve this to the best of foodies!  Thanks so much for this great offering.

I roast the beets (coat with olive oil, wrap individually in foil, or cover pan with foil) and then use the beet juice/oil mixture as the base for the dressing, adding new oil to make up the balance required.  I also purchase candied pecans, as I don't care for walnuts...what a delicious salad!!!!
PS:  I also use disposable painter's gloves to rub the peels off the beets after roasting...it saves me from having stained hands!)

Placed the sliced beets in a plastic bag with the dressing for about 2hrs before serving and used feta cheese.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  Fantastic!

Beets and goat cheese are an awesome combination. And with the addition of the maple walnuts, I'm in salad heaven! I've never used orange juice concentrate in a dressing, but it came out very tasty. I did add a little extra balsamic vinegar because I like my dressings zippy. I found crumbled goat cheese, which is perfect for salads. You can count on me making this salad again!

Absolutely amazing.  I've been trying to find a dish to use the beets from my local CSA.    I roasted my beets in the oven the day before.  In comparison with boiling the beets, you retain much of the flavor and sweetness when roasting.    Next time I want to try using freshly squeezed oranges, as I'm not a fan of OJ from concentrate.   However it was still delicious.

This was a great salad. I cooked extra beets for dinner the previous night, and used those for this recipe. Instead of walnuts, I used pecans and thought the use of maple syrup to candy them was fantastic (and I'll use this idea again for other recipes). I did use the orange juice concentrate for the dressing, but half the amount called for. This salad was a big hit with my family.

Excellent use of beets. It makes a very good salad. I did find the "dressing" was too thin and cooked it with corn starch to thicken it. That way it clings to everything better.  Yum, yum!

My wife and I loved this salad. The earthiness of the beets is balanced by the tang of the goat cheese and the sweet and sour dressing. The candied walnuts add the right crunch and sweet pop to the overall salad. This is a salad I will make again. One complaint, which really isn't a complaint as such,is that the recipe makes enough dressing to float the Navy of Andorra. The dressing is so good though, that I am sure we'll find a use for it!

This has to be illegal. THE most delicious salad I have ever eaten. I just joined allrecipes today after four years, so that I could give you kudos on this.  If I get a bunch of SPAM it will be worth it.

You finally gave me a reason to crack open that bottle of walnut oil someone gave me as a gift last year.  I had to use canned peaches (as it is April) and I subbed green ends of scallions for the shallots, but this is just an explosion of deliciousness I did not expect from such a simple recipe.

Also, do NOT sub feta for goat cheese--that's like subbing skim milk for whipping cream.  Goat cheese is expensive, but a little goes a long way.

I also had some pomegranate balsamic vinegar on hand, which was was awesome.

Excellent. I substituted walnuts for pecans. For a short-cut I used a store bought dressing - a pomegranate vinaigrette. Any fruity dressy would do I think.

Would have been 5 stars except that I knew I wouldn't like the walnuts candied in maple syrup.  I candied the walnuts by heating them gently in a teflon frying pan with brown sugar.  The brown sugar melts and makes a lighter candied nut, good for salads. 
Dressing was surprisingly good.  I was a little concerned because the orange concentrate makes a rather thick texture to the dressing, but the flavour is great.  I like to toss the greens in the dressing before plating the salad and adding the beets, nuts and cheese.  Be careful that you use just enough dressing to coat the greens lightly.

Love beets!  I have been cheating because the whole roasting, boiling makes a bloody mess when removing the skins.  Costco now carry wonderful vacuum sealed cooked, peeled beets 4 beets per package, excellent deal to put beets in salads.  I know people don't like it in reviews when someone changes the recipe~~I'm not trying to change it, just stating the changes I made to make it easier.  Also when I did the walnuts I tried them with the syrup initially~~what a mess.  Next time I just toasted them in a skillet.  Didn't use OJ either, balsamic is the way we like to go.  Anyway, I LOVE the combination.

Omg! THis recipe is DEEEELISH! I had an extra can of organic beets that i had bought for another recipe...so i thought it would be super yummy for this salad. I sure was rite! I drained the beets and sliced them thinly and it was a lot easier than baking fresh beets but still organic and delicious. Like some others , I also used crumbled feta cheese instead of the goat cheese. AND I also added an apple, chopped into cubes. The apples complimented the candied walnuts and vinegar so well. I highly recommend it! This is my new fave salad EVARRR! :)

PHENOMENAL - The flavor combination of this salad is phenomenal!  Earlier in the day, I roasted the beets in foil pouches for an hour at 400 degrees (cut the tip and tail off of each beet, then create foil pouches leaving enough room for steam to circulate  inside the pouch), instead of boiling them.  I find that roasting the beets brings out more of the natural sweetness.  When it came time to assemble the salad, I opened the pouches, removed the skins by rubbing them with my finger.  We didn't make the maple-coated walnuts, we used raw walnuts instead.  We didn't have any frozen orange juice concentrate, so we omitted it and the salad was still VERY sweet, especially with the balsamic:olive oil ratio.  This is one of my new favorite salads, the creaminess of the goat cheese, the sweetness of the beet, the bite of the walnut, the slight crunch of the baby spinach combined with the dressing (without the orange juice) is incredible AND beautiful.  I'll definitely be serving this for Christmas this year.  Thank you for this delicious recipe.  We'll definitely be making this at least once a month.

My family loved this salad!  I grilled the beets (just olive oil rubbed on, no foil necessary) outside on a grill in a veggie basket for about 45 min on med hi.  I used pecans instead of walnuts, I think they compliment the beet texture better.  I was thrilled with how easy it was to use maple syrup and candy the pecans, took no time at all and they were very tasty (I chilled pecans in the fridge to firm up glaze because of the high temps we're getting).  I cut the dressing in half, glad I did because there was still more than enough.  I served this salad with grilled lemon vinaigrette halibut, steamed green beans and corn on the cob(garden is producing)my husband has been talking about this dinner for 2 weeks now :)  Thank you Donna!

Delicious! I simplified and bought raspberry vinegarette dressing & candied walnuts. I will make this as a regular "company's coming" salad!

I've made this recipe twice in the last week-- my husband and I LOVE IT. We usually have something else, too, for a bigger meal, so I wouldn't call it a single-dish meal. Other than that, it's perfect!

Quite possibly my favorite salad EVER. I roasted the beets for an hour in a little olive oil, and used homemade candied walnuts instead of the maple stovetop version in the recipe. AMAZING. Also topped it with some sauteed chicken breast that I finished with a bit of the dressing. The hubs loved it too, said it was "Gourmet" and "restaurant quality". Will be making this many more times.

Great salad.  The only change I made was cutting back the amount of oil and using orange juice rather than concentrate.

My husband, daughter and I liked this salad very much.  It is a nice light tasting dressing, great for the summer time.  I cut the beets in small chunks in order for them to cook quicker.   I substituted fresh squeezed orange and sliced almonds since that was what I had in my kitchen.

Great recipe.  I've tried this salad in a few restaurants and was looking for a copy cat recipe of it.  I followed the recipe exactly, with only a few changes;  to reduce the amount of concentrated orange juice to only a few table spoons & also with additions of garlic powder & garlic salt!   Otherwise absolutely Yummy!

This is delicious! I used pecan instead of walnuts, because I have an allergy. I recommend tossing the greens with about 1/4 of the dressing and adding the beets and cheese on top. The remaining dressing should be reserved for another use. This salad is just delicious! I could eat it every day!

Exceptional! I placed the beets into the dressing and marinated them for about 1 hour, then removed them and placed them on a bed of arugula. I did however need to skip the walnuts since our kids are HIGHLY allergic. This is a definite keeper. I'll even plant beets in my garden next year just for this.

This was super, super yummy.  My only critiques were that it had a bit too much orange-y flavor.  Perhaps I'll use less orange concentrate next time and the beets took easily twice as long as they were supposed to.  But still an excellent dish and will definitely make again!

Excellent recipe--didn't have orange juice, so I used the "Balsamic Vinaigrette" recipe from this site by Gary R--added two Tablespoons of maple syrup to sweeten it up...YUM!

FABULOUS recipe!!!  I now have a new favorite salad!  Thanks:)

Substituted the dressing which I am sure would have been very good with my own because I am a GoodSeasons Italian Dressing fanatic;  I added the orange juice where GoodSeasons calls for water.  YUMMY!

This was OK it fell a little flat. Have not given up on it, will try marinating the beets in the salad dressing for a few hours see if that solves the problem. As we were eating every one said they thought it need a little onion sprinkled over the top.

I LOVE beets and goat cheese, so this salad was a combo of two of my favorites! It made for a really good salad, except the dressing was just so-so, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. I would recommend more of a balsamic vinagrette. The orange juice didn't turn out quite right for me.

Love this salad - very similar to one we eat in a cool little cafe in Sisters, OR  whenever we're there.  I make the dressing following another beet salad on this site which uses balsamic reduction (reduced balsamic vinegar), 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice and just 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil for a stronger flavor that we prefer, and then double the goat amount of beets and goat cheese which makes it a meal.

Made this for a lunch for 40 - was a big hit.  I used pecans instead of walnuts, feta instead of goat cheese, and granulated sugar to candy the pecans rather than maple syrup.  As per the reviewer who commented that the recipe makes enough dressing to float the entire Andorra fleet, I cut the dressing in half and there was still plenty.  Next time I might cut it by 2/3. Too much dressing can ruin this salad.  As per a number of reviewers, I decided to bake the beets - I'll never do that again.  For this salad I much prefer the texture of a boiled or canned beet.
Update: have never served a salad when having a turkey dinner but this salad was so beautiful I decided to make an exception this year - serve it to 12 at Christmas dinner, halving the dressing - it was a hit, with several having seconds.  Had requests for the recipe. I'll be making it again.

This one is great, I loved the dressing! I roasted the beets instead of boiling them, and used candied pecans instead of the walnuts. All the flavors just blend together perfectly. I'd give it 10 stars if I could!

Absolutely loved this recipe! I didn't have orange juice concentrate, so I subbed lemonade concentrate (~ 1/3 cup) plus some orange juice to get up to a 1/2 cup. Fabulous! Next time I will probably use a little less lemonade and a little more OJ, but I have to say, it was fantastic as made :). Thank you!

We loved this salad just as it was written.   I have also made a warm salad by using the salad dressing first to deglaze the pan in which the walnuts were done. Delish!

I like beet salad but this dressing is a bit more tart than I usually like. Also, when the walnuts cooled the maple syrup made them harden into a block. I used plain chopped walnuts and they were good.

Amazing.  We will be making this again (and again)! I used a package of 50/50 baby spinach and mixed spring greens and I think it was a good mix of salad greens for this recipe.  The flavors and textures in this salad are simply lovely together.  I roasted the beats in the oven rather than boiling them, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Thank you for a great new way to enjoy our beets this summer.

Didn't read far enough to see the part about putting it over the mixed greens so I just combined it all with about 1/4 of the dressing.  Excellent!!

This was wonderful!  I used 1 cup walnuts to 3 tblspoon maple syrup.  It makes a ton of dressing... about twice what we needed.  Delicious!

We loved this salad.  I just used what I had on hand, so I used fresh beets, the maple walnuts as directed, romane lettuce, sliced scallions, hemp seeds, apple cider vinegar, and feta cheese.  Added diced chicken tenders, and it was delish.  Will use this from now on.  Thank you, Donna, for a great tasting and nutritous dinner idea.

A very good salad for those of us who don't care for beets. I always thought beets tasted like dirt, but the candied walnuts and sweet dressing mask the beet flavor. I thought this was very good, even with crumbled feta, which was all I had. But I believe the smooth goat cheese is an even better choice. Thanks for sharing.

Simple yet out of the ordinary salad.  Using fresh beets is worth the effort. Warming the goat cheese before placing it on top of the salad takes it up a notch as well as adding fresh herbs to the dressing.  I will make this salad often!

Great Salad. It got rave reviews at work.I made it for Valentines day and used canned beets and cut them into hearts with a cookie cutter. Also added oranges and pomegranate seeds and feta cheese instead of the goat cheese

Fantastic salad! The candied walnuts turned out perfectly - not too hard, not too sticky, and oh so easy. I buy the vacuum-packed, pre-cooked beets in the produce section of my supermarket, which makes this a snap to prepare.

I had a similar salad in Wolfgang Puck's restaurant in Las Vegas where he used pistachios.  I will use them when I make this again.
I roasted the beets, adding in some oil and balsamic vinegar, as described by previous reviewers (thank you!).  I had only fresh baby spinach, and that was a perfect green for this.  Finally, I had only fresh orange juice, so I boiled it down for the dressing and it was perfect.

Many raves for this salad, I will certainly serve it again.

OMG!!! I've been using All Recipes for about 5 years and this is the first time I've made time to rate a recipe. Stupendous!!! I've always detested beets but this was excellent. I wanted to skip dinner and just stick to the salad. I prepared enough of everything to last all week including the carmelized nuts which should last w/out a problem. A must try.

This salad is incredible!  I added some roasted asparagus on top, and I also used canned beets rather than fresh ones simply due to convenience.  I was able to whip this whole thing up in less than 15 minutes, and it was great!

Delicious.  The dressing was incredible, but makes way too much, so add as needed.  I was too lazy to make fresh beets, so I used two cans of pickled beets and this worked out fine.  The candied walnuts were quick and easy to make, actually the whole salad was quick and easy to make.  I highly recommend!

This was my first time making beets, so I was a little scared, but I have to say that the flavors really complimented each other well. I didn't do the dressing because I don't like salad dressings. I used feta because I had it around, but I'm a goat cheese fan and I think it would be even better with goat cheese.

This was delicious! I'm always looking for good, quick, healthy 1-person recipes to cook for myself. This one was all of that, and easy to modify the amount of ingredients to suit one person. I think I'll also make it for my group of friends! It's an easy and impressive dinner party dish. I used canned beets and it was great. I also added a tiny bit of ground ginger and pepper to the dressing (and made a whole bottle so I can use it later, too--same with the walnuts-now I can sprinkle them on my salads). Thank you!

My favorite salad.  Period.  If you change anything in this excellent recipe then serve the beets warm! Also, make more candied walnuts... better to have too many than too few.

I made a "Gourmet Day" of my boyfriend's birthday and cooked this with scallops and gnocchi. It was a hit! The candied walnuts are so good you could eat them all day, and the goat cheese and dressing really make it all come together. A really great, inventive dish that I will make again!

Candied whole pecans with honey sugar and used honey goat cheese. For the dressing-puréed canned mandarin oranges ( didn’t have OJ concentrate ) and used lemon infused white balsamic. Delicious

I love this salad! It was very easy to make and delicious. I really like the combination of the toasted maple syrup walnuts with the beets and the goat cheese. You only need a little of  the dressing because it is strong.

For the dressing I used 1/4 cup of blood orange olive oil, 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar, and  almost 1/4 cup of sugar.  I also substituted blue cheese as the grocery store did not have goat cheese.  A very tasty and refreshing salad.  A nice combination of ingredients.

Simple directions Easy to follow.  Guests loved it.  Some did not relish Goat Cheese so just left it out in those instances.  Would be delighted to serve again as a side dish with my vegetarian lasagne.

I prepared this recipe for the first time exactly by the directions and served it for a winter supper for several guests.  It got rave reviews from everyone.  Several people remarked on the citrus flavor of the dressing and how it complimented the beets.  It's very colorful salad and full of interesting textures.  It's definitely a keeper and especially nice for a winter meal.

This is our new favorite salad, and I make it often. I've used both fresh beets when I had them, and canned beets when I didn't, and both were good. I substitute feta for the goat cheese for my husband, because he won't eat goat cheese, and I use the goat cheese for my own salad. The candied walnuts add a nice taste.

This recipe is a keeper.

My husband says this is his new favorite salad - and he's not a big fan of salad. I used greens from the garden, including arugula and pea shoots. Also  used yellow beets instead of red. And I ran out of balsamic vinegar. It was awesome anyway.

A nice and easy recipe! I used canned beets because they are cheaper and already cooked. However, I did warm them on the stove a little. I did not have any maple syrup so I substituted honey for the walnuts. Everything turned out amazing!

This is my go-to salad, I love the crunch of the walnuts against the soft beets. The orange concentrate adds a touch of citrus freshness.

Served at a pot luck and it was a hit.  I followed exactly but only used half of the dressing to keep it lighter.  I used goat cheese, as I thought feta was too salty for this sweeter dish.

I make this recipe with only one small change-I candy almonds instead of walnuts due to nut allergy. I cheat and use pre cooked beets that I buy in a large package at Costco. The brand is "Love Beets" and I do! I do!

This is a great salad!  I served it to my Canasta group and they loved it!  Only change was that I used feta cheese instead of goat cheese. I really loved this recipe because I had never cooked fresh beets before and I loved them. I live in Brazil and you can only buy canned beets here at specialty stores and they are very expensive.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

I thought it was perfect!!! yum yum yum. Ok., I added a tiny sprinkle of
kosher salt and a smidgen of butter to the walnuts, oh so delicious! The nuts were the stars of the show. When the dressing merges with the goat cheese it's a heavenly creamy transformation. I'm serving this for my salad at Christmas dinner. Thanks for such a delicious and yet simple salad.

Love this salad!  I roast the red beets the day before and then peel the next day.  Also eliminated the OJ (didn't have any on hand) and used aged balsamic vinegar and olive oil drizzled on top.

This was my first attempt at a beet salad and I thought this recipe was very good. The only changes I made was I used the juice of 2 oranges since I didn't have concentrate and I used shaved Parmesan since I dont like goat cheese. This tastes like a salad you would get at an high end restaurant.

Fabulous! I added chicken to make it a meal and roasted the beets (that's the only way I cook them.) I thought the dressing might overpower the dish, but the flavors blended beautifully.

I made this again but did not use beats at all, I replaced with uncooked pears and it tasted more complete.

Guys, this was AWESOME! Took me a while to understand that the dressing is made with thawed or semi-thawed frozen O.J. concentrate ( NOT watered down!).  Even my husband who couldn't care less for beets loved it! The candied nuts (I used pecans) were crucial to this dish and made each bite truly magical. Definitely a culinary delight. Better than in restaurants!

I made this salad as the first course for a special dinner party I was having, and it was AMAZING.  Everyone loved it.  I highly recommend it.

Easy, earthy but elegant. The nuts will be nicely candied with less maple syrup. I used white, candy striped, and golden beets, all fresh from my garden. When prepared together they retain their unique colorations (obviously not so if you include red beets). I always steam beets, whether cooking them with their greens or not-- always have, but will perhaps try baking them one day.
This is a wonderful salad, light, but satisfying as a stand-alone meal: Phytochemicals/flavonoids/antioxidants, and fiber (greens and beets), proteins (walnuts and goat cheese), vitamins, and minerals (beets). Great for your taste buds, great for the rest of you.

Amazing. Delicately sweet. I used pecans, canned beets, and orange juice because it's what I had on hand. I used 1 ounce of goat cheese per plate. This recipe made way too much dressing. It's great so I'll use it, but I'll make about 1/3 next time. A keeper!

This was delicious - I added way more nuts, though, because they're so good!  I didn't bother with the plating, either. I just threw it all together in a big bowl. I did find there was way too much dressing as well - I think you could half it and there'd be more than enough.

I LOVE this salad. I like to make a little extra dressing and marinate some chicken in it to add to the salad for a bit of protein. very good, something I make on a biweekly basis.

I candied the nuts (pecans) in a brown sugar and water reduction, but other than that followed the recipe and really enjoyed the flavors. My three-year old daughter even enjoyed it.

Tasty salad!  I cheated and used beets from a can.  I also didn't have OJ concentrate so I used pineapple and orange juice.  I didn't know how I'd feel about the wet walnuts, but they were good@

The beets and goat cheese were great.  Added some chicken.  Wasn't too impressed with the walnuts.  I think they would have been better plain.  Also will use less olive oil next time in the dressing.  Edit - had greens, beets, cheese and dressing left over, so made it again.  Subbed plain sunflower seeds for the walnuts, and it was much better.  Still think the dressing was a bit too oily.

Delicious!!  I doubled the dressing recipe to use as a marinade.  I then added marinated grilled chicken, apple and nectarine to the salad…to add a few more flavors.  I also substituted pecans for walnuts; the caramelized nuts make the salad!!

This could possibly be my favorite salad of all time!  I didn't even know I liked beets until I had fresh ones...YUM!  I believe I even converted my whole (Southern) family last night to love beets and goat cheese which I didn't know was possible.    Additions: chopped strawberries

I really enjoyed this salad, and I am more of a hot food/soup/stew kind of gal. I didn't have orange juice so I made it with fresh tangerines. I cut the amount of oil down to approximately 1 tablespoon and used Feta. I used a few drizzles of all natural uncooked honey. The salad was delicious, and it was great having some fresh cubed beets around the kitchen while to snack on while the rest of dinner was being prepared.

overall was a very good and tasty recipe. i modified it a little bit by not using the maple syrup and the frozen orange juice (good luck finding one in the uk!) and serving the beet roots warm. 
i definitely would make it again.

The flavor combination was good, and I loved the idea of using syrup to candy the nuts.  We roasted the beets as others suggested, so in the end it was a bit more time consuming than I like for a salad (I could buy canned but won't as we shoot for maximum nutrient value in our food).  Next time I'll add the onion as suggested by other reviewers and marinate and chill the beets before serving.

Simple, very good.  Cooking the beets might be more trouble than it's worth, next time I'm going to try canned beets.  I use other sorts of nuts rather than almonds, and I used honey-roasted nuts and skipped the whole syrup step.  Obviously I'm after a very quick and easy version of this...  I make a big batch and keep the dressing separate, so I can eat several meals from it during the week.

Absolutely delicious!  I made it using organic candy-stripe beets (slightly milder than traditional beets) and fresh spinach leaves and it was a perfect vegetarian main course for two people.  

I substituted feta for the goat cheese, and used lemon juice in the dressing instead of orange-juice concentrate but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  The candied walnuts were so easy, and a big hit!

Fairly good, but too much work for something that is only "fairly good". If I make this a next time, I will definitely buy cooked beets, and maybe add some onion as others have suggested. I had high hopes because I love all the ingredients but in the end, it just didn't come together to be a 5-star recipe for me.

My fav salad of all time... And I don't even like beets! I RAVE about this salad to my friends and family and encourage them to give it a whirl. 
Use fresh beats! Similarly to how I feel about the importance of using fresh pumpkin in pumpkin pie, fresh beets make all the difference. If you want to save yourself some time, Trader Joe's has great prices on candied walnuts. I don't bother with making my own. I also prefer to use arugala as I feel it gives a nice texture. And if I have left over arugala, goat cheese and dressing I sub peeled grapefruit for the beets for a super delicious twist on this recipe.

This recipe was really good - i did make a couple of changes though.  I sub'd feta cheese for the goat cheese b/c i hate goat cheese and i added some yellow onion.  Adding the onion really complemented the sweetness of the recipe well.  Overall, a very yummy salad and a GREAT use of beets!!

I just made this for supper tonight and really enjoyed the exquisite blending of flavours. We made a slight change for my husband who has to watch his sugar.  I increased the walnuts to 1/2 cup and decreased the maple syrup to about 1-1/2 Tbsp (I just drizzled it into the pan until it had the right consistency). It was exquisite enough at those quantities that we're planning to make it again tomorrow for lunch! Thanks!

Mmmm, mmmmm.  I wasn't sure how I felt about beets but this recipe won me over.  A great flavor, very different from your average salad.

Roasted Beets - don't need to cut or wrap in foil.  Just prick a few holes to let out steam and bake directly on oven rack at 425 F with something underneath to catch the juices that ooze out as it roasts.  Approximately 45 min to 1 hour.  They are ready when the skin becomes a shell because the beet underneath has shrunk.  This goes for roasting sweet potatoes too.  Once roasted the skin peels off fairly easily.

Dressing - the frozen OJ and good balsamic works wonders!  I thought it would be too strong but was just right.  Olive oil amount can be varied to your taste.

Easy and delicious. Did not have orange concentrate, so squeezed an orange into a measuring cup and added equal part of olive oil and balsamic vinegar to taste. Also ground a little sea salt into the dressing.

Such a great salad.  I made per the recipe and it was really amazing. The vinaigrette fits perfectly, is light and not overwhelming. I used fresh orange juice rather than the concentrate.

The main thing I did differently was to use, instead of the recipe's dressing,  a cup of leftover homemade cranberry sauce diluted with  orange juice. As did others, I substituted Feta cheese for the goat cheese and added a roughly diced unpeeled red apple. I folded in most of the wanuts but left some to sprinkle on top with the crumbled cheese. Makes a festive and tasty Christmas salad!

I love the proportions for the dressing. This is tasty and elegant. I roasted the beets whole and have also sliced them thick with a bit flavored oil (Orange is good.) That gives the beets a wonderful flavor, too. It also gives them more of a roasted texture.

This salad was delicious! I've had similar salads with cranberries instead of beets, but this was a nice change. What a fun way to incorporate beets into dinner. 

I sauteed the beets, but other than that followed the recipe as written. Served with Butternut Squash Bisque recipe from this site. Will definitely make again :-)

very blah.
After having a very blah dinner with it, marinated the beets in the dressing overnight.  Improved.   However, still has very little zing to excite the taste buds.

I mostly followed this recipe but instead of orange juice concentrate, I just freshly squeezed the juice from one orange. I found that gave the salad dressing just enough flavor without being overwhelmingly citrusy.

A great beet recipe. I roasted the beets covered with foil for an hour. The beets weren’t done so I peeled and diced them and finished them in an oiled pan on the grill. This added nice flavor as well. I doubled the goat cheese and juiced and zested 2 oranges instead of the concentrate.

I love beet salad and tried this one today. I used honey instead of maple syrup for the walnuts and only used virgin olive oil and balsamic drizzled over at the end.  Really delicious -- OH I also had boiled a large beet and then pickled it a little in the fridge with olive oil and apple cider vinegar.  All so good!

This was great.  I added a healthy squirt of honey to dressing to calm the tang.  Also added cherry tomatoes and cucumber because they needed to be used.  Put in individual serving containers and met a friend for a picnic lunch.  Perfect.  Thank you for sharing!

I loved this salad. You could add chicken and call it dinner. My husband said he hates beets but he eat the whole salad and didn’t complain.

Excellent new family fav. I used two tablespoons of expresso balsamic vinegar as part of the required balsimic vinegar ingrediant. Boosted flavour of dressing. Could just drink the dressing it was so good

Excellent! I had mango nectar which I replaced for the OJ. It was PERFECT! I’ll make this again. My son loved the beets! After reading all of the positive effects of beets on our system I decided to try this. I’ve never made beets before so this was my first time. Thank you.

I tend to be the type to modify recipes. This did not need it (although I only had pecans on hand). It is just spectacular. Perfect summer salad with beets from our CSA.

My new favorite beet salad!
I make beet salad often and change up the ingredients depending on what I have at home. 
 This recipe is utterly delicious! Using frozen orange juice concentrate adds a bright, sweet, yummy citrus edge & makes my mouth water just thinking about it! Topping the salad off with toasted maple syrup walnuts is ridiculously good and adds a brilliant sweet crunch to the tangy mix. This is my new GO-TO beet salad!!! DELIGHTFUL!

This was so delicious! I will certainly make it again.  The dressing was also great with chicken and I'm considering trying it as a marinade.  The creamy goat cheese, sweet, tangy dressing, roasted beets and crunchy nuts made for a really great bite.

This was delicious.  Goat cheese is usually a little too overpowering for me, but combined with the beets and the walnuts, it's perfect and I found myself wanting to add more.

I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and roasted the beets wrapped in tin foil for about 1 1/2 hours.  They came out perfect.

Very good!! I thought the walnuts were too chewy though and will probably just toast them next time. I also used frozen beets and roasted them.

I made this salad for very picky friends that came to my house for dinner and they loved it. And the pickiest one repeated and everything. I didn’t change a thing because I’m not a chef kind of person. Just instead of concentrated jui I used regular juice because I forgot to buy :))

Very good! Very easy! I made the  walnuts the night before and just threw everything together in a few minutes the night of. I was a little worried about the OJ in the dressing, but it was delicious. We even put the dressing on the pork chops.

A great base recipe but a few minor tweaks I felt that made me lean towards a 4, a very strong 4 but.... :-)
I found the amount of dressing for the portions to be 2-3 times as much.  I prefer roasting the beets (400ºF for ~45 minutes depending on the size of the beets)  I like the tip of leaving a bit of the green stalks on when roasting so you have something to hold onto.  I might try pickling the beets next time to get a different 'zing'.  Thanks for the recipe.

We liked this a lot. My tweaks - Where I live, you can buy cooked whole beets in the produce section, so I just chopped 5 of them into chunky slices.  I added a very tiny clove of crushed garlic to the dressing.  I put a bit of the dressing on the beets to marinate for an hour or 2.  Then I lightly dressed the greens (rocket/lettuce mix), put the beets on, then the walnuts, then the crumbled feta (goat cheese makes me ill).  It was very pretty and tasty as well.

I followed the recipe to a 't' except that I roasted the beets and marinated them overnight in balsamic. Perhaps this was the mistake. I love restaurant beet salad but didn't enjoy this. The beets had not flavour.

Roast the beets instead of boiling; scrub beets, trim ends, drizzle with olive oil, wrap in foil. Bake at 400 for one hour. Let rest until cool enough to handle. Using a paper towel, rub the skins off the beets. (This can be done ahead if time)  I like to reheat the beets a bit and serve warm in the salad as it melts the goat cheese.

This was a great recipe and exactly what I was looking for.  I used canned red beets instead of fresh and cut them, cut down on the time to serve and make.  Also my fiancé doesn't like goat cheese and substituted feta cheese for him and I stayed with the goat cheese.  Yum!  Thank you!

I was looking for something different to make using my beets growing in my garden. This recipe is fabulous! Easy, and can be really quick if you make a little extra candied walnuts as the dressing lasted for three salads.

This salad always goes over well at parties and potlucks. I repeatedly get asked to bring it again. For the dressing I prefer a 1:1:1 Ratio of oj concentrate/ balsamic vinegar/ oil. I always add plain cooked quinoa, it really adds to the salad. If I have time I also marinate the beets in balsamic vinegar. 
Arugula is amazing with quinoa in salads, I usually use half arugula and half mixed greens. 
I use the Candied Pecans recipe  by Alix on AR for the nuts, it is the most addictive incredible recipe for candied nuts and goes well with this salad. I found the walnuts/maple syrup in this recipe too moist/ soft and missing the crunch I love in candied nuts.
When  putting it together, just before serving, do it in this order for the best visual presentation:
Toss greens in dressing, put in bowl
Top with quinoa, then beets then feta then candied nuts. The white/ red contrast is beautiful, at least until it get mixed up and the whole salad becomes pink!

This is an amazing salad!  I learned a few things when making it for the first time... 1) definitely toast nuts before adding syrup, I added syrup in beginning and ended up with soggy nuts. No one likes that. 2) should've watched a quick Beet prep video, I did it the hard way and peeled beets before boiling. Who knew!  3) keep goat cheese in fridge until you're ready to plate bc it crumbles way easier when cold.  Thanks for the recipe Donna!

loved this salad. I had to make some substitutions to use what I had on hand. For the dressing, I used my own vinaigrette , but added some orange juice and some sugar to it and I used Feta for goat cheese.
Will be making this one a lot.

I think I could eat this three times a week and never get tired of it!  I preferred pecans instead of walnuts and made a whole cup of them in real maple syrup.  I cut down the amount of olive oil in the dressing just a bit. Everything else by the recipe. A fantastic combination of flavors. Wow!

This is good and easy.  I liked the candied walnuts. The dressing is ok - its light - but lacks a flavor punch and Im not sure what is missing.  
I've had this salad at restaurants and it was REALLY good.  I wanted to recreate it at home and this was close but "that certain something" is not there.

The  salad was fabulous!  My kids loved the combination of the goat cheese, beets, and candied nuts.  I followed recipe, but used fresh squeezed orange juice instead and added salt and pepper to the dressing along with 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar.  It made the dressing a little more tart and I liked it better this way.  Delicious!  Will make again and now my kids like beets!

I used precooked beets, and roasted them for 20 mins with a drizzle of olive oil and kosher salt.  I added grape tomatoes and avocado.  I loved the candied walnuts..great touch!  I made my own go-to simple balsamic dressing (3 part olive oil, 1 part good quality balsamic, 1/2 clove crushed garlic, 1/4 tsp Dijon and touch of kosher salt). It was delicious and so pretty!

What I do with this salad is use balsamic and rice wine vinegar with fresh dill canned Mandarin slices and grapeseed oil. This marinade is combined with thinly sliced rounds of red onion and the beets.  I soak the walnuts in this as well so it's really like a pickles salad. For plating I use a egg poacher to create a circle of cucumber strips. I put the salad in it, top with pea shoots and some Mandarin slices on a smear of the vinaigrette and some goat cheese. I top that with dill. This salad also works well with a bed of arugula and accompanying smoked salmon on swedish rye toast.

Made this last night as written with one change, roasted the beets in the oven at 400 degrees from 2 hrs.  Let them cool, then peeeled and sliced.  salad is a great combination of flavors, dressing was great, candied walnuts and goat cheese really make this dish excellent.  Very nice salad to have with a special meal.  Thank you!

Short yummy salad, I made it for Christmas dinner and it was a huge hit. I made 2 changes...used curly endive which is similar to chicory because the supermarket did not have Belgian endive and used freshly squeezed oj because I did not have frozen concentrate.

Seriously yummy!  I was skeptical about this recipe because beets, although good for you, can be so "earthy".  The dressing and the goat cheese absolutely make this salad, beets and all!  Will definitely make this again and again.

Made this as directed - and I can't eat it enough!  I was worried the orange juice in the dressing would taste a little odd,  but this salad was a perfect blend of flavors.  I will definitely make this again - over and over!

It was something different.  Toasting the walnuts and adding the maple syrup I got  large chunks of nuts that stuck  together.  They were difficult to separate.   So I  had chunks  on salad, I couldn't just sprinkle them over greens.   Never used or tasted goat cheese before, it doesn't have much flavor.  If I make it again, I will use Blue Cheese or Roquefort cheese.

I doubled this for a potluck: the night before, I poured 3 cans of unpickled sliced beets over a 1/2" rough chopped small red onion (large enough to pick around), to let the beet juice mellow and color the onion, and prepped double the dressing (emulsified). The next afternoon, I drained the beets and onion, and tossed with dressing, adding toasted pecans instead of walnuts, 12 oz of Feta instead of goat cheese, and one bag of baby spinach.  It was a big hit!

Simple and delicious. I really liked the citrus vinaigrette recipe, it was perfect to go with the greens. I made the  vinaigrette exactly per the recipe and found that it was simply too much dressing for the 2 of us so in the future I will cut it in half.  I did not make the beets as I used some pickled beets that I canned a few weeks ago.

I added in some golden beets as well as half an avocado.   The dressing was so good and the walnuts were wonderful.  This was a fabulous salad and I will definitely make it again.

This recipe is delicious but I might try making the walnuts next time with sugar rather than the maple syrup for a slightly different flavor.  It will definitely be a summer favorite with fresh beets!  Thank you!

This salad was delicious. I did not have can concentrated orange juice so instead I used a can of mandarin oranges (without the juice) and sprinkled evoo and balsamic vinegar over the salad. The walnuts with maple syrup was delicious! Thanks for the great recipe. Will make again.

Yum! Yum!.  The only changes I made were to roast the beets instead of boiling them and added grilled chicken breast to make it a main course salad.  Better than any dinner salad I've had at a restaurant.  The only negative is that although the candied walnuts were delicious they were very sticky and were very difficult to "sprinkle" onto the salad.  Maybe I should have chilled them first?  I will probably try to find another candied walnut recipe for next time.

Loved this salad - my first time cooking (and possibly eating) beets.  I substituted feta for goat cheese, because I had it on hand, and used a bed of baby spinach as the base.  Used a little apple cider vinegar in the dressing, just to give a bit of nutritional boost.  Was delicious :)

I used pre-cooked beets from Trader Joes and tossed most of the dressing with the greens and nuts before topping with beets and cheese.  It looked lovely and tasted delicious!

I used a combination of recipes and used this one as the base - for the walnuts & dressing.  I used this recipe to help jazz up the goat cheese - http://allrecipes.com/recipe/71737/spinach-salad-with-baked-goat-cheese/  and the combination was pretty awesome. I substituted red raspberry balsamic vinegar and I increased the ratio of orange juice concentrate  which I think sweetened the dressing a bit.  It was really pretty delicious, although the whole meal produced a lot more dishes than I would have liked!  My husband and kids were less appreciative so I probably won't make it again but if you like beets and goat cheese this is a great salad to make!

HUGE hit at the house. Changed the dressing to make it a bit healthier (but I bet it would be crazy good if full fat): 1/4 cup oj concentrate, 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup balsamic. Also used feta because that's what we had. Mmmmm. So. Good. (227 cal per serving).

Red beets are just starting in my part of the country. Makes a big difference if you can get fresh, small beets. 
This is one of the best salads I  have ever had. The orange juice dressing is  fantastic. I give the beets a few minutes in the microwave then toss them with some sesame oil and balsamic glaze and finish them in the toaster oven. I also added some chicken pieces quick fried in sesame oil with garlic and a few chopped green onions. MMMMMM

This is one of my favorite ways to make beets. This recipe is versatile that you can use a number of different vegetables to it.
 I have made this recipe before and found that it is sweet enough without the addition of maple syrup on the walnuts, so I have cut that back to just a hint so we'll still get a touch of the maple syrup taste. The orange juice gives this such a nice, bright element so I try to always use that or a bit of lemon and zest. I added in some julienned carrots and sprinkled feta cheese on it this time. A great base salad that you can change up whenever you're in the mood for something different.

This is a great salad that's simple to prepare quickly.  The nuts really make this so don't skip them.  My son-in-law makes his own maple syrup and it's perfect in this.  I often add some leftover grilled chicken to make a complete meal and feta is very good in place of the goat cheese.

So simple it is almost unbelievable! Better than any I've had in restaurants. I'm looking forward to trying it with golden beets. Oh, be careful with the walnuts....they get very sticky and can end up in a huge lump.  Take care to separate during coating.

So good that I made it for Christmas dinner. I have made it with roasted and canned beets. Making the beets fresh are good, but not totally necessary. I marinated the canned beets in oj and balsamic vinegar and they were great. The flavors are a great combo. Yummmm!

Excellent!  I roasted the walnuts in a little olive oil and honey first to bring out the flavour - (subbed the noneyfor the maple syrup) - and I roasted the beets first.  Also added salt and pepper to the dressing.  Will definitely make this again!

Great recipe! I made goat cheese croquettes and they just put the salad over the top, as good as anything in a restaurant. (Freeze a log of goat cheese for 15 minutes; slice; roll each slice in beaten egg then panko crumbs flavored with herbs, salt and pepper; fry in olive oil.) I also subbed pecans for walnuts out of personal preference and they were delish.

This salad is simply divine! All the components of the dish marry so well together that this salad is going to stay on my roster for a long time to come. I made the recipe as listed except for I roasted the beets in the oven @450 for 1hr instead of boiling them, and I also added chicken on top so I could have it as a full meal. So delicious.

Excellent! I cut the dressing to 1/4 of recipe since I don't like a lot of dressing: 2 T. oil, 2 T. orange juice and 1 T. balsamic vinegar and it was plenty for me. I didn't have goat cheese but used sharp provolone instead. I know that salad would be just as good with goat cheese. Thanks Donna

My husband and I loved this salad! I roasted the beets for an hour at 375F, and used feta as that is what I had. The dressing is a lovely compliment to the beets, and as others have said, the toasted walnuts with maple syrup really make the salad.

I made this for 50 teachers and the feedback was positive.  Many were unsure since they didn't like beets or goat cheese but they enjoyed the salad.  I did make a few modifications.  
I used canned whole beets, thinly sliced & chilled.  I substituted pecans for the walnuts and added honey to the goat cheese.  I softened the goat cheese used a mixer and added honey until I found a balance in flavor.  Lastly, I placed the goat cheese onto plastic wrap.  Rolled into a log and froze.  The cheese was easier to handle.  Prior to mixing salad together thaw enough to slice.  The cheese softens quickly once at room temp.

We've made this at least a half dozen times and have gradually tweaked a few things to our liking. We use way less olive oil- 2-3 tbsp at the most.  And- we dry roast the beets til fork tender, then cool, peel, and marinate in the dressing for a couple hours.  Can also make extra beets, and leave some to marinate overnight- Perfect for a second salad the next day.  This is one of our favorite salads

This is absolutely delicious.  Great mix of flavors.  I was pressed for time, so I used canned sliced beets.  I'm sure roasted fresh beets would provide a better texture and flavor, but mine was still darn good.  I have failed miserably at glazing nuts on many occasions, but this maple syrup method on the stovetop is so easy.  Love it.  Can't wait to eat it again!

I love how the walnuts in syrup turned out just not sure if I really liked them in this salad. As for the dressing, wasnt a big fan of the OJ flavour but might be my purist attitude about balsamic.
Next time, no nuts and no OJ and I'm sure it will be very tasty!

ROASTING the beets instead of boiling or steaming will bring out the robust full flavor of the beets and works very well with the goat cheese. I also substituted pinon nuts instead of walnuts and simply sprinkled a few of the pinon nuts over the top of the salad. Muy delicioso!!

absolutely delicious and that really means something since neither my husband or i usually like beets. the only problem i had with this recipe is that the walnuts became so sticky after cooling that they were like glued to the teeth and required a pretty long teeth cleaning.

I made this for my healthy eating class today and it was an instant hit! However, I only used half the amount called for of EVOO as the first batch I made was a bit on the bitter, oily side. It came out great! Of course, I used all organic ingredients, mostly from my garden. Just LOVE this salad recipe!!! It's a keeper.

this was a big hit at my dinner party; I added Pecans with the walnuts and a little more maple syrup when I sauteed them; like "butta".

The salad dressing alone is worth 5 stars and I will use it for other salads, but I love beets and goat cheese. The maple walnuts were like candy. Yummy!

Mmmm, so good!  Really enjoyed this salad.  I baked the beets for an hour and sliced them.  Next time I will cut the slices in half because they were a little too big.  I may not candy the walnuts either since there is so much sweetness with the OJ concentrate, but it was so yummy!  The goat cheese added a nice mellow flavor.  Hubby really enjoyed it too.  Thanks for sharing!

Perfect! I had a similar salad in a restaurant years ago and tried to make it numerous times but failed. This is the exact salad I was looking for. The trick that I was missing was the candied walnuts all along.. Only thing I did differently was use feta cheese since I did not have goats cheese. Fantastic salad!!!

Very good.  I used the juice from an orange instead of concentrate and I also used spinach for the salad.  Great salad....now if only I could convince the rest of my family to admit that they like beets.

I have prepared this salad many, many times and each time my guest make a comment about how much they enjoy it. Excellent recipe, ingredients can be bought just about anywhere, easy to prepare and colorful! What's not to like. You can always use almonds instead of walnuts.

I served this at brunch and it didn't seem like people liked it.   I just don't think beets are a veggie people love, but I had them on hand from our CSA delivery and really wanted to try them.   I would probably pick a more traditional salad next time.

I have been trying to find something to make with beets, because I got them through my CSA and I am not a huge fan.  This recipe was great!  The goat cheese and nuts was a perfect off set for the beets.  I didn't have frozen orange juice, so squeeze fresh oj juice and added alittle of the maple syrup to make it alittle sweeter.  Amazingly my husband also liked it.

It's really great as-is.  Just eyeball the measurements to your taste, and definitely use fresh-squeezed OJ in the dressing rather than concentrate.  Huge thumbs up.

Good salad, I sprinkle the beets with red wine vinegar and olive oil, then roast them. When I'm short on maple syrup, or just don't want the sweetness, I substitute pistachios for the walnuts.

Awesome!  My husband and I loved this.  The fresh beets were very sweet.  We substituted pecans for the walnuts.  Next time I'm doubling the pecan/syrup mix!  Yum.  We will make this again.

Made this salad last night.  My husband and I both were delighted with it.  Our teenage daughter doesn't eat beets so deleted the beets and goat cheese and added cut up mango.  She was quite pleased with the taste of the dressing and nuts with the mango.

to make the dressing thicker, I didn't let the orange juice concentrate thaw completely.  Instead, I opened up the oj concentrate when I got home and mixed one cup of it with the other ingredients.  I also used only a 1/4 cup of olive oil (less calories).  the dressing came out delicious!  I would also recommend heating the beets to help the goat cheese warm up!

Great Salad and easy to make. I used regular OJ. I served it all in 1 bowl as a side. There was enough for 6 and there were still some left. It also tasted great the next day. Thanks :)

What a great idea!  I didn't make the dressing (I just used a little salt, pepper, and balsamic vinegar to save some calories), but the combination of the crunchy nuts, sweet beets, and creamy goat cheese was amazing.

We received red beets in our CSA box this week.  I never had beets before so I was anxious to try them.  This salad was good but I think I may have put to many beets in it.  Next time I would only put in 3 small to medium size beets.  I used feta based on other reviews and liked it.  I would make this recipe again.

The salad itself was good but I didn't care for the dressing.  Maybe it's just me because other people seemed to like it! Here are the things I did differently:  1. Roasted the beets - Scrubbed and cut off the ends. Wrapped in foil and put on a baking sheet (this is a MUST DO). Bake at 400 F for 45 min-1 hr. Let cool and then slice 2. Used feta cheese instead of goat. 3. Made 3X the walnuts. Awesome! 4. Other than the dressing - the salad itself is good.

Wow we love this recipe!  The salad dressing is so simple, yet so delicious.  Everything complements each other wonderfully...the tang of the dressing, the sweetness of the walnuts, and the goat cheese to bring it all together.  LOVE THIS!

Loved it.  So easy.  The dressing was a bit vinegary for me, but other than I thought it was great.

This salad was a big hit at my house, I cooked it as part of the meal for mothers day and my dad said it was his favourite part "tastes like something you'd find in a high class restaurant" he said. The dressing was very tasty also! Definitely will make again :)

How YUMMY! I had some beets going to go bad in my refrigerator and everything else on hand except for goat cheese. I just used feta and it was amazing! The combination of the candied walnuts, cheese, and the slightly citrus dressing is to die for! I agree that pecans would be good too!

This salad was pretty good.  I used golden beets and skipped the walnuts because we're combining foods a certain way.  Overall, tasty and visually appealing.

The beets were sooo good, but very messy.  Everything was red!  The flavor combination was excellent.

One word- YUM!  The goat cheese and beets are a great combo in this salad.
