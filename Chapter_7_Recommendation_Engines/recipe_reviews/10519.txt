This was a nice surprise.  It was easy to make and the cookies were very flaky and buttery.

As written.. 3 stars.  First thing, the dough was way too moist to roll out. I added a little more flour.. didn't seem to help much and I didn't want to add too much or else this would turn into a bread. So I sort of squished it into balls and smooshed into the muffin cups ( I used minis) and then topped with the jam. If the dough had been able to be rolled, I might have been able to add more jam but as it was, the cookies were not very sweet. I topped these with a bit of glaze and that improved it. I tried them this morning from the fridge and that is how I liked them best... cold with the glaze. Once they came to room temperature, not as much
