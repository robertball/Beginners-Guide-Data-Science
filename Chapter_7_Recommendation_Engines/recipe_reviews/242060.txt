Love these! I use milk instead of cream and cooked quinoa instead of the quinoa flakes. Turn out nicely and they keep well (almost like freak out of the oven) for a couple days after!! ????

I loved these. I used organic Tamarind sugar, just less that a cup. Left over cooked quinoa from dinner and omitted the cream. scooping them with a small scoop for bite sized treats, they were crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. Just perfect.
