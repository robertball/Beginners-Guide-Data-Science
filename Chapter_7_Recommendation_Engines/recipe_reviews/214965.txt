I have never written a review, however this dish was EXCELLENT! I made it as an appetizer for Easter, and it was the hit of my dinner party! I cut up my raw shrimp and marinated over night in fresh lemon and lime juice. I drained and dropped them in boiling water for a few minutes until cooked, and drained. This gave the shrimp a nice flavor! I followed the recipe after that,leaving out the avocado. I served them with tortilla chips and the avocado on the side. I made 3 pounds of shrimp and they were scraping the bowl for more!

Beautiful presentation!

This is a nice light summer appetizer.  I could see serving this in shooters at a late spring/summer get together.  I'm a cilantro hater, so I made my usual parsley sub w/no issue.  I also chose to forgo the avocado.  THANKS, Kiersa!

Absolutely delicious~ I brought this to an appetizer party and served it with scoops chips and it was a huge success.  I did use more limes and added imitation crab to the recipe.

I’ve made lots of ceviches and my favorite shrimp ceviche is a lot different than this recipe and has more of a cocktail sauce base to it, but I was looking for something a little lighter for a lunch with friends. This sounded good and fresh. I wasn’t disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly except that I added about 1/4 c of ketchup. Don’t knock it til you try it. It adds just a bit more sweetness that works with this recipe. My dear FIL, who was a ceviche maker all his life, swore by good ole ketchup!!  Anyway, this is a great recipe and I’ll use again!!

I loved it! I used Mahi Mahi instead of shrimp,  & pineapple as well as mango. I also added a Serano pepper which was probably a mistake. I wonder if I should have rinsed the Mahi Mahi off  after it was “cooked“. One recommendation  or one point I would make is that the last thing you should add is avocado right before you’re ready to serve as the dish seem to sweat and produce a lot of liquid. I really felt like it wasn’t good past that evening and threw  most of it away but other than that it was phenomenal and I will definitely make it again!

This was a big hit at a recent dinner party.  We really enjoyed the contrast in flavors and textures.  Made the recipe exactly as listed and served with scoops chips.
