Very nice, another mentioned to boil or mash, but that is so different - as when you roast, the cauliflower browns it gets sweeter - In Lebanon they will make a dip of olive oil, lemon and garlic with a little salt and pepper, just delicious!

This recipe was good.  The parm cheese addition at the end is important as it adds alot of flavor.  Also, either my oven wasn't working properly, or it needed more time to cook.  I expected it to be a little softer.  I only used about 1/2 the salt, as it seemed like too much for my taste.

We really loved cauliflower prepared this way!  We cut the head into small florets, and I think it made a big difference because they browned up and got a little crispy on the bottoms.  I can imagine that larger pieces would not roast similarly.  We also did not turn the cauliflower.  It was delicious and we will make this again!

The day I made this dish was one of those days when everything seems to go badly, so I didn't have much hope for this recipe. I was running late with dinner and it took forever to cut up the cauliflower. I followed someone's suggestion to cut the flowers smaller and cooked it a little longer. I apologized as I placed it on the table. My daughter took some and said delicious so i tried it too and agreed with her. We both had seconds. I will definitely put this on my to make list. Thanks for a recipe that is both healthy and delicious.

Definitely enjoyed this, a nice way to serve cauliflower without drenching it in cheese sauce.  It did take longer to cook than the recipe called for.

This was very good, the key is to cut the florets into small pieces so they get a little brown, and cook all the way though. I also sprinkled on the cheese and returned it to the over to melt completely. It went great with grilled pork chops!

the only thing i did different was, a tsp of diced garlic that I always have in a jar in th frig and I had fresh shaved parmesan and used a handful of it.  I also used avacado oil.  OMG this is so good and very easy to make.

Roasted cauliflower is one of our favorites. We loved this more than the recipe with Balsamic vinegar. I left out the salt as the lemon juice gives plenty of flavor. Yum!

I made this recipe as written, although I tried to cut the cauliflower into 1/4 inch thick slabs so it would lay flat and brown more evenly. I thought the roasting directions were spot on for temp and time. My only thought is that roasting is supposed to bring out the sweetness in vegetables, and I thought the lemon covered that up. It was still good though, and I gobbled it all down, since my husband doesn't care for cauliflower.

Good recipe but I was not too wild about the lemon flavor.  Perhaps the next time I roast cauliflower I will omit it.  Debbie

I think the cauliflower may need longer roasting to get a nuttier flavor.  Maybe some nutmeg?

This was pretty tasty. Mild and clean flavor. I did not need to flip it and cook it for the additional 10 mins. It was plenty cooked and soft without being mushy after the first 15 minutes. It might be my oven, but just check before you keep cooking. I personally like it to maintain some structure but be tender. That's what it was. The flavor was mild with a little lemony taste. The cheese on top went well with the mild lemon flavor. I'll make it again.

This was tasty and easy, a nice change from our usual vegetable rotation. It is really important to cut the cauliflower small pieces so it will truly roast evenly.  You wouldn't have to do cheese at the end necessarily, although it is excellent with the Parmesan.  I've done with and without and without cheese stands on its own just fine too!

I followed the directions exactly and found it easy and tasty, however some of the florets got charred, adding a bitter taste.
Will make again at either lower temp or shorter time.

Halved the florets and went 1/2 hour at 400Âº. Fresh is best, but garlic powder and lemon pepper work as a not too bad substitute.

Yummy way to eat cauliflower.  I added some broccoli because I didn't have a whole head of cauliflower.  I just drizzled the oil over it all;I know I used less than 1/4 cup as called for. And I used a lime for juice, since I didn't have lemon. Turned out to be a great side dish!

Delish!  Made this recipe twice for myself.  Caution:  florets shrink, leaving you wanting more.  I added Cajun seasoning and gave it a wow factor.  Next I will try Thai seasoning.  This recipe is a blank canvas for every home cook's creativity.

Best cauliflower I ever had! Cut cauliflower lengthwise in slices so it would lay flat on the tray and cook evenly. Added some hot pepper flakes, it was amazing, hard to believe this is so healthy, it's so good! Making broccoli the same way very soon.

Simple recipe that was a hit with the family.  About 15 minutes into the baking time, I tossed the cauliflower around to make sure it roasted evenly.  And, I added about 5 minutes to the baking time ... so about 30 minutes total, though I then turned on the broiler for about 1 minute or two because I like the brown parts on vegetables.  I didn't over do it and it turned out great.  I didn't change anything except the baking time.

This recipe is just perfect.  I have had the best results mixing the oil, garlic, lemon, salt, and pepper in a separate bowl then pouring over the florets, just to keep the garlic from clumping on a few florets.  I have also stopped baking it a few minutes early on occasion based on how much faster some batches start to brown.

Put everything in a gallon ziplock bag to mix for one less dish to wash. This recipe was super easy and really good. I will keep this recipe close at hand.

Delicious!  Not sure I followed the recipe exactly.....winged it ,using what I thought would be the right am't of EVOO, lemon juice, minced (not sliced) garlic, S & P  and added the parm (and a good bit of it), to the mixture after roasting.  It really was excellent.

Okay, the garlic was getting burnt.  I didn't use near as much EVOO, so maybe that was my problem.  Other than that, the taste and texture was good - crunchy.

Absolutely delicious! As other reviewers have noted, if you cut the florets into smaller pieces, the cauliflower will carmelize in the most delectable way. I will be making this again -- and often.

This is the best way to make cauliflower. Please ignore reviews that say to cover the casserole dish: not sure what they were thinking as that completely negates the reason you roast it in the first place: the delicious crispy browned bits. You may as well just steam it if you cover it in the oven. My only tweaks to this recipe were: no reason to flip/turn the cauliflower 1/2 way through cooking; sprinkle the parmesean on it before you put it in the oven;  use a foil-covered rimmed baking sheet instead of a casserole dish and to make sure the washed/cut cauliflower is as dry as possible before getting into the oven. I might try pre-heating the pan next time to get even more carmelization. I think you can use any seasoning you like;  I'm sure the lemon juice is lovely but I mixed up olive oil, tumeric for color, smashed garlic, hungarian paprika, salt & pepper then tossed the cut cauliflower in that, dumped on the foil-lined baking sheet and topped with crispy fried onions (like you use in green bean casserole) & parm. 1 head, 25 minutes at 450 and I had cauliflower nirvana. (Do not overcook - should not be mushy but barely fork tender.) From experience: roasting a whole head of cauliflower is a gimmick; it might look nice but the more surface area the better it tastes (more browned bits). Bonus: roasting it, there is no bad gassy smell.

My husband who dislikes cauliflower really liked this, and for that reason alone it gets 5 stars. I prefer my veggies firmer, but he thought they were perfectly cooked as the recipe was written. I think I will take mine out when I flip his over next time. Thanks for sharing!

Very good. I added some  Cayanne pepper to mine because I like a little spice.  I would cut back on the lemon juice though as that was a bit much.

Iâ€™ve been making roasted cauliflower for awhile now but the addition of the melon juice made a big difference here, as did an increase in temp.  We added some hot giardinara into the dish when we served and with that addition it was OMG delicious.  We cleaned the whole bowl!

We love this recipe! My husband asks for it and I love it as so edgy to make and tarted great!  One hint I have a bake/convention combo over so Iâ€™ve lowered the temp to 425 and watch closely as depending upon size of cauliflower pieces it can crisp up pretty fast and be tasty and tender

This recipe was great. The lemon juice added lots of flavor. I used a fresh lemon and followed the directions as written except that I used 425 rather than 450 for roasting. After 15 minutes the cauliflower was getting tender, so I turned the temperature down to 375 while finishing the rest of the meal. Will definitely make this again.

Crushed the garlic and mixed with oil and lemon juice, then added lemon pepper to season. Super yummy!

Thank you for submitting such an easy recipe!! I really enjoyed it and appreciated the meal even without the parmesan cheese. I do reccomend like everyone else to chop the cauliflower into smaller florets. Cooks nicer that way.i added brocolli to the mix...bigger florets and this was amazing!!! I will try carrots next.

Very easy to make. I really like the zip the lemon juice gives this dish. Next time I "think" I will add some spices to give added flavor. Try it . . . you will like it.

Big hit!  The sesame oil makes this great.  I added bacon and was generous with the parm.  I also baked it a bit longer to get the crispy bits.  I will definitely make this again.

This was pretty good. I think I might put it under the broiler for 2 minutes to brown it more next time. Flavours were good as is. Planning to try different seasonings in the future.

Love this recipe. I alter it depending on who I'm making it for. My parents love it exactly as its posted here. My son and I love it with no cheese and extra lemon, as we both enjoy lemon and stronger more bold flavors. Differences for the second option are simple, we add about 5 times as much lemon juice for ourselves (in our opinion the parm doesn't match up with this amount of lemon). After we cook it if it's a little bland still we just squeeze some extra juice over it before serving.

This was sooooo good. Cooked exactly as written for the time indicated in recipe. The florets came out slightly browned but not overly done.  It was soft to the bite  but not mushy. Will definitely make this again.

I made it exactly as it says, and it was the best way I've ever had cauliflower. I loved it, husband loved it and even my 4 & 2 yr old enjoyed it. The flavor was amazing and the parm cheese was a key ingredient. Will be making this as a regular. Super easy also and doesn't take much to make.

I made it to the recipe, and it was excellent.  I cut the cauliflower into small flowerets because some reviews said it was burned before it was tender.   I've made it several times and also added broccoli and onions.  Be sure to keep the size of the veggies (or thickness of the onion slices) about the same, so they are cooked through at the same time.

I. Love. Roasted. Cauliflower. So easy. Soooo good! I would gladly eat roasted cauliflower for a snack any time of day. I like to roast it until it's very golden and lightly browned. The deeper the color the better. Yum!

So glad I found this recipe because I thought that I didn't like cauliflower. I needed a quick recipe so I selected one with most of the ingredients I already had handy, except I substituted sharp cheddar cheese for the parmesan cheese and 2 one-fourth teaspoons of minced garlic for the garlic cloves. If I were to make changes I would reduce the amount of olive oil by a quarter, and add a little more lemon. There was enough left over for a second day and the oil soaked the plate. Can't wait to try it with the parmesan cheese.

Trying to incorporate more vegetables into my diet and this recipe was great. Me and my friends all loved it. Paired it with grilled rib eye and was very pleased especially with the garlic and parmesan.

Delicious, easy & quick. Kids LOVED it. Only change I would make is cooking it a tad longer after flipping. Maybe 15 min instead of 10. Cauliflower does shrink up a bit, if making this for more than a few people I would definitely double the recipe:)

Use only 1/8 cup of olive oil and 2 cloves of garlic. 1 Tbsp of lemon juice, a little kosher salt and some pepper. I did not use cheese.

If you like cauliflower, you will like it. this recipe. The cooking time was perfect.  I did cut the florets into small pieces. The flavor was delicious!! I made the recipe as written except  for not using lemon juice since I had none and cutting the oil.  It is quick and easy to prepare and the results are a delicious side dish.

Update:  I have been experimenting with this recipe. I ended up making it exactly as written when I had lemon juice.  I did not care for it with the tang of lemon juice.  Others may like it just fine.   

My five star version eliminates the lemon juice and uses one tablespoon of olive oil and one tablespoon of melted butter.  Using the 1/4 cup of olive oil results in an oily end product. Cutting down to 2 tablespoons of  fat results in a crispier dish. 

We make this often now and really enjoy it. Company has enjoyed it as well.

I am not someone who loves garlic, but I decided to try this recipe with very few changes.  It was delicious.  I was making the Brown Sugar Meatloaf from this site so I roasted the cauliflower at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes in a baking dish.  It  was tender and tasty.   The lemon added a little zing.

This recipe is a decent starting point. I changed it up  bit by adding some parmesan cheese during the baking and omitting the salt. Garlic and parm. cheese already have enough sodium without the extra from the salt this recipe calls for.

Love roast veggies. This is also great with mixed veggies. Onions (thickly sliced), broccoli, halved sprouts or asparagus. Just remember  to add broccoli  or asparagus later so the won't  overbake. We have the mixed roasted veggies several nights a week . Full  flavor, low fat, full nutrition.  Don't  even need a starch anymore.

I don't like cauliflower but this is delicious. I did not add the parm cheese at end. If you cut varied size florets the result is some firm while others were a bit crunchy.  If you like "crunchy bits" this is awesome! The recipe is easy and full of fresh flavor.

I followed this recipe exactly as written. I used the convection setting on my oven (still 450 degrees), and the cauliflower was cooked perfectly in the time stated in the recipe.  The next time I make it, I'll sprinkle the cheese on it as instructed, but will then put it back in the oven for about a minute so it melts a bit.

Rave reviews from everyone on this side dish. A great flavor combination. The only complaint was there's none left!

I made this and loved it.  I warmed up the olive oil and put some chopped fresh garlic in it.  Then poured the lemon juice in and put all of this over the cauliflower before roasting.  Fresh grated Parmesana Regianna!  Perfect!

This was delicious! My 3yr old son and I made this together an ate it for lunch actually. We gobbled up the whole thing. We tried it with and without the Parmesan and both liked it better without. My oven runs a little hot so I heated it to 450 then turned it down to 425 after I put the cauliflower in. I cooked it exactly like the recipe stated and I liked the little bit of crunch it still had.

REALLY enjoyed this!!! Even my son (who isn't big on vegetables) and my husband liked this. Definitely a keeper. I didn't have fresh garlic so I used a garlic spice that i had on hand. Very tasty dish. My son said "definitely make this one again."
