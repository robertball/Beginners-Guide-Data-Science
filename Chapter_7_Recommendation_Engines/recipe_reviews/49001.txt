I made the bundt version of this the day before yesterday and served it in my espresso bar. It sold out in no time and for good reasons: beautiful and delicious! I used 1.5 times the "topping" and put it in the middle, and added a little cardamom and nutmeg as well as extra cinnamon. It is important to grease your bundt well and flour it too; I did this and still had a small area where the filling stuck to the wall of the pan. Baked for about 50 minutes at 325 degrees convection. Dusted with 10x as suggested. Very moist; keeps well in a cake dome overnight (if yours lasts long enough) and goes well with coffee drinks. I do recommend lightly toasting your pecans or walnuts before chopping. It heightens the flavors a bit in the finished cake. This is one of the best coffee cakes I have ever baked and I have tried quite a few recipes over the last 10 years or so! Highly recommended.

4 words: super yummy super fattening. This has become the staple of every brunch/shower I go to and every one always asks that I make it. I doubled the topping recipe and have made it in a 9x9 pan,a loaf pan (more bread like) and also in a bundt pan (preferred method and cook for 1hr) for a more cake like presentation. For the pan version, I put topping on top. For the bundt version, I put the topping in the middle of the batter and it comes out looking amazing. People ask how I got it in there. (just put 1/2 of batter in, topping, then 1/2 of batter again). I've also made it with walnuts instead of pecans. I think pecans taste better but they're both great.

DELICIOUS!!!  Very moist and buttery.  I have made this three times and each with a different variation.  The bundt pan works best, but use generous amounts of shortening and lightly flour before putting batter into pan.  After cooling in pan overnight, the cake literally fell out the next morning.  Don't overdo the topping in the center of the bundt pan.  The first time I did that and the cake separated when I tried to get it out of the pan.  Using real vanilla extract instead of imitation gave it a better flavor.  I also used slivered almonds, but didn't have almond extract to add to the batter.  It was still delicious, but want to try it with almond extract next time.  Using the 9 x 13 pan didn't work too well.  The topping sunk a bit into the cake, so I served it out of the pan "as is".  It didn't seem as moist as when cooked as a bundt cake, either.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this and brought it into work. Rave reviews!!! It was wonderful. I followed the recipe instructions as they were written. I did make some minor ingredient changes -I only had walnuts so I used those instead of pecans; I used 1 1/4 cups of sugar instead of 1 1/2; I made 1 1/2 times the amount of strusel; and I added about 1 teaspoon of almond extract as well as the vanilla (1 tablespoon). I baked it in a bundt pan and I put some of the strusel topping in first, then half the batter, the rest of the stresel, and the remainder of the batter. I baked it for 35 minutes (my oven is a little slow), but it tested clean. The one thing in the directions that I think was most important is that you FOLD the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients. By doing this carefully, you get a very nice texture to the coffeecake.

Could this be anything but perfect? An important step while preparing the batter is to hand incorporate the flour mixture. It does not come out as well when cheating and using the mixer for that step.  I noticed some reviews rating it down a bit due to sinking of the topping. My first time making this I ended up with a solid brick of the topping toward the bottom of the cake. Still ate it...but not what it should have been. For anyone having a problem with sinking topping, here's how you fix it. Add 2T flour to the topping mix and incorporate all. It is easy to mix the butter in while melted or using the Cuisinart, but don't! Use your fingers to rub solid, cold butter into the dry topping ingredients. You will not see the "butter balls" and it will look like loose damp brown sugar. Use this method for all of your baking and you will notice the difference in all of your toppings. Then I add the pecans and top the batter. The other real problem is cook time. In a 350* oven, you must bake for 1 hour. Any less than that and you have a beautiful edge, but soup inside. Don't do the tooth pick test until it has baked 55 minutes or the middle will sink. At 30-35 minutes it isn't half baked. So plan for the hour, and it does not burn. It comes out the most perfect golden brown you have ever seen. Lastly, this is the only coffee cake that will still be moist 3 days later!

First time coffee cake... simple recipe and delicious.  Then I made it again and used almond instead of vanilla and it was a smash.  This is a great recipe.  Can't miss... follow the directions.

Oh. My. Gosh.  This is a delicious coffee cake!  Probably the most moist cake I have ever eaten, yum.  I used margarine rather than butter (didn't have any) and Fat Free sour cream (the only kind I had on hand) and it turned out just beautifully.  Don't know why anyone thought this tasted plain.  I will absolutely make again, probably this coming week for the morning after Thanksgiving.  Thank you so much!Oh yes, I didn't do the foil thing either, just served it right out of the pan with no problem.

This has become my all time favorite coffee cake, and I make it often at my coffee shop. The only change I have made is to double the topping and put it in the pan first. Then spread the batter on top of that, bake it, and when it comes out, flip it over and all the gooey topping flows down into and around the cake making it even more moist, if that's possible. I always sell out of this and cannot stop eating it, myself. SOOO amazingly good.

It isn't something I would crave, but it IS delicious.  Some topping kind of sinks into the cake, giving it a yummy marbled effect. I didn't have a whole cup of sour cream, so I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup whole milk.  The cake is "melt-in-your-mouth" buttery, and despite one reviewer's comments, it was very flavorful.  I added just a pinch of salt to the topping, though.

The topping was yummy, but the cake itself wasn't great.  It was almost too sour tasting and leaves a funny aftertaste.  Definitely do not recommend this and will never make again.

This cake is very moist and rich. Very buttery and creamy tasting. I can't even imagine using more of the pecan topping like others were suggesting. It would have been too sweet and inedible! The cake is very sweet and rich without the topping! You will definitely want to serve coffee or milk with this. 
I made this in a bunt pan since I was taking it to a brunch and thought it would look prettier. I sprayed it well with Bakers Joy (cooking spray with flour added) and it fell right out of the pan. I placed half of the cake batter in the pan poured in the pecan topping and spread the remaining batter on top. The trick is to not spread the pecan topping all the way to the edges of the pan, keep it in the middle, or it causes the cake to crumble apart a bit when slicing. 
I will be making this again!

This is truly a delicious recipe, Vimala.   I did mine in a 9x9" glass pyrex,   so my bake time was increased somewhat, and I baked at a slightly lower temp.  The resulting cake was absolutely delightful. I did not experience any of the "sinking" other reviewers mentioned, but I did use only half the amount of finely crushed pecans. Oh, I added a bit of shredded Angel Flaked Coconut to the topping, as well. I'm keeping this one in the family recipe book. Thank you so much! I wish I had a piece right about now...

I made a bundt version also and it was a huge hit. I took the recs of previous raters: 1.5x the topping, put half in the middle, baked at 325 for 50min and it was perfect. Moist and delicious! I will be making this again and again!

Very tasty for Sunday brunch. I made it a little less heart-stopping by using one stick of butter and one half cup of unsweetened applesauce. It was maybe a little less rich, but my boyfriend couldn't tell that used applesauce (this was a first!). I also used low fat sour cream, substituted 1/2 cup brown for white sugar, and added flour to the topping which I made at about 150%.

Simply Perfect!  Made it exactly the way it says, with the exact ingredients/measurements, and all I can say is, that it's perfect.  If you need a coffee cake and don't already have a great recipe and aren't sure which recipe to pick, PICK THIS ONE!  You won't be sorry!  :)  The cake itself was moist, the top was crunchy, but not too crunchy.
And it was so delicious!  I made this for the first time for a going away brunch, for a friend.  It was my first time ever making a coffee cake, everyone loved it, I loved it, and so will you!

I have made this twice to take to church functions and got rave reviews each time. The only changes that I made was to double the topping. I put half of the batter into a greased and floured pan, sprinkled half the topping on, dolloped the remaining batter on then gently spread out and sprinkled the remaining topping on. I did cut the sugar in the cake by 1/2 cup because of adding the topping in the middle.

This coffee cake really is delicious!  I followed many of the other reviewers and used a bundt pan, made 1.5 times the toppping, added a bit of the topping to the center of the cake, and let the cake set in the pan overnight.  Here is what I found:  (1) This is really sweet but goes good with coffee.  I think next time I might reduce a bit of the brown sugar in the topping and only make the amount indicated in the recipe.  One tip is to be sure there are NO lumps at all in the brown sugar since it will still be a lump after it cooks. (2) It did not seem to matter that I added some of the topping to the center of the cake because it all sank to the bottom of the pan which, of course, was the top when turned out of the pan. (3) To prepare the bundt pan, I smeared butter all over the inside of it, then lightly floured it. After setting out all night coverd with plastic wrap, the cake turned out of the pan cleanly but not immediately.  I had to run a thin spatula around the sides and shake it a bit.  I think next time, I will try "Baker's Joy" spray to cover the inside of the pan and let it cool only about 10 minutes before turning out onto a cooling rack.  (4)  I do think letting the cake set overnight is a great idea, though I'm not sure if it wouldn't taste just as good immediately after it had cooled.  I agree that keeping it wrapped (or inside a cake dome) keeps it moist.  Everyone loved this recipe.  Thanks so much, DWBH!

This cake is *amazing*!   I've already passed on this recipe to a number of friends and those who've made it so far have all agreed that this cake is not only super easy to make, it really melts in your mouth!   I think it comes out so light and fluffy because of the way the batter is mixed.  I can't really get pecans here in Europe where I live (Austria) so I just use chopped walnuts and it works, too. Sometimes I use 1 cup of white sugar and a 1/2 cup of brown sugar (instead of 1.5 cups of white sugar)  and I think it gives it a good taste, too.  This is my new cake recipe - I just love it!

This coffee cake is absolutely delicious. I did make one major change however; I can't STAND the taste of sour cream in my baked goods, so I usually use heavy cream, plain yogurt, or vanilla yogurt. For this recipe, I used heavy cream, but I bet yogurt would work well, too. This cake was very moist and delicious and flavorful. I also had problems with the topping sinking into the cake, so maybe next time I'll wait until halfway through teh baking before I put it on. I didn't do the foil thing either. I just used a glass pyrex. Next time, I'll use a cold stick of butter to coat it, but it came out great this time. I ate it warm, but I can't wait to try it cold. I also used 2 1/2 t of vanilla extract, and a 1/2t of almond extract for kicks. It was very tasty, but if you try almond extract be careful to use only a small amount because it can overpower very quickly. I'll be adding this one to my recipe book. Thanks for such a great recipe. DELISH!

I made half of this recipe in my 6-cup bundt pan.  After making the batter and pecan topping, I started by first putting half the topping in the bundt pan, then half the batter, remaining half of the topping and then the remaining batter.  Mine needed 36 minutes in the oven.  This produced a delicious cake with a crispy, crunchy top.  To add a little decadence, I drizzled a couple of pieces with caramel and topped them with some whipped cream for dessert.  We loved this as a coffee cake and as a dessert and it’s definitely one I will make again.

This was a perfect mix of moist and sweet with flavour.  Having eaten another coffee cake shortly after which was considerably less good I really appreciate this one.

I'm not sure that it's amazing, but it's quite good. The cake has a lovely, light texture and delicate flavor. I'm not sure why the instruction to line the pan with foil is there, unless it's to help the bottom of the cake brown -- I fixed this in my normal glass baking pan coated with nonstick spray, and it came out just fine.

This is, without a doubt, the best coffee cake I've ever eaten. I used margarine simply because I found myself out of butter (what?), but I think I will make this substitution again because I can't imagine this cake could be any better. This will definitely be made again and again. It is truly amazing! Thanks for a great recipe!

This coffee cake is moist and delicious. The changes that I made were to toast the pecans first, I increased the topping to one and a half times that of the recipe and drizzled a vanilla glaze on top. It took 45 minutes to cook a 9" x 13" cake.

I simply don't understand the negative reviews on this cake, it was EASY to make if you followed the instructions carefully. If you topping is sinking you over mixed your batter, YOU FOLD in the mixture of flour, not mix. Bake it in a 9 X 13 pan until you figure it out. If you don't follow the recipe perfectly don't leave a negative review, as you changed the recipe... This cake was WONDERFUL, best coffee cake I have ever ate. Next time I will make double the topping and try adding a layer to the middle of the cake. The batter should be stiff, cake cooked in 30 minutes.

This cake was a huge hit!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I made this in a non-stick bundt pan that I generously sprayed with Pam.  I put half of the topping in the bottom of the pan and half in the middle of the cake.  It looked a good as it tasted.  I will probably increase the topping to 1.5 next time.

Very Very Tasty. The only modifications that I made was that I added a teaspoon of almond extract and reduced the sugar in the bater portion to 1 1/4 instead of using 1 1/2.  I also doubled the topping and added two tablespoons of flour to it(this was suggested by a previous reviewer) so that it would not sink into the cake. I will be making this again to bring in to work. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was really good. I didn't have any pecans so I subbed almonds, and thought that was delicioius. 
The cake itself was quite dense, but at the same time sort of had a light taste to it.
My family loved this and it was gone the day it was made. Will 
definatly make this again.

Very easy to make. Super moist. It is quite sweet so you may want to cut back on the sugar a little. I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter. I had problems with my topping sinking into the cake so I added 2T flour to the topping, baked the cake for 20 mins first, then added the topping. Baked 40 mins total. Turned out perfect. I made one with pecans and one without. Both were delish! This is a keeper.

I must agree - this recipe is AMAZING.  I didn't have any pecans (gasp!) but it was still wonderful.  Very light, almost creamy, melt in your mouth - especially while it was still warm.  I prepared in a bundt pan and layered the "topping" in the center of the cake.  I made it for Easter breakfast and it was gone by the end of the day.

Cake portion is much too sweet, especially when you factor in the pecan streusel.  I had reduced the sugar by a half cup, and next time I will reduce it by another.  I also substituted the sour cream with Chobani 0% plain greek yogurt, and added more vanilla to suit my taste.  Turned out great!

This is an amazing coffee cake!  The batter will be very thick when you are finished mixing everyting together.  I was a bit worried about this, but the cake so moist and tender!  I left out the nuts, as I do not care for them in cakes and such.  I will def. make over and over again!

Really loved this.  Made it in a bundt pan and cooked for 1 hour.  I poured 1/2 mix, then topping, then remaining mix.  I also doubled the brown sugar & butter in the topping.  Make sure you use flour if making in a bundt pan cause the extra topping seeped out a little and stuck in a spot - but didn't ruin this great cake!

My family really loves this recipe.  My mother, mother-in-law and my husband's 92 year old grandmother were all totally impressed when I made this (yeah!).  It is so moist and delicious.  The second time I made it I tried to lighten it up a bit and used light sour cream and Splenda while and brown sugar.  My family didn't even notice, so I will continue to make it with those substitutions.

I was trying to duplicate the reduced fat cinnamon-swirl coffee cake at starbucks.  This is very close.  I baked this in two loaf pans.  I put about a cup of batter in each pan and put a layer of brown sugar and cinnamon on top of the batter.  I then put some more batter on top of the sugar and cinnamon.  I then mixed some sugar, cinnamon, and brown sugar and sprinkled over the top.  I left out the pecans because my family doesn't like nuts cooked in anything.  I also used lite sour cream.  This cake was even better the next day.

This is the best coffee cake I ever made.  I made it for my annual holiday brunch and everyone loved it.  I did make it in a bundt pan and put the topping in the middle and then did an easy frosting I drizzled on top.  Looked beautiful and tasted great.

The flavor was very good although very sweet to me.  But... the timing on the recipe was very wrong for me. I checked with a wooden skewer at 35 min and it came out clean in center and the topping was medium dark brown, so I took out. After cooling, it sank in the middle, badly. Under the crispy topping it was not done at all. I cut the edges off and tried to bake the gloppy mess from the center. I was so disappointed because I had made for an event, that it did not get taken to. I should of checked better for doneness, I guess.

Loved it! I made a number of changes, though.  I used all whole-wheat flour, put 1 stick of butter and 1 cup of applesauce, used low-fat vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream, put 1tsp molasses, and put 1/2c less sugar than it called for.  Will definitely make this one again!

I found this to be an average recipe. It has so many great reviews but I found it to be on the dry side. I'm curious to see if it was something I did (i'm a strong baker but we all have off days :) but if I get the same results I'm going back to other coffee cake recipes I have which have produced a much better result.

The taste of this coffee cake are phenomenal.  Unfortunately I decided to make this in a bundt pan and had an awful time getting it out of the pan.  I suspect I should have floured the pan.  Next time I will make the recipe exactly as written and bake it in a 9 x 13 pan.  It is very yummy and I look forward to eating again in a less "deconstructed" state than my current bundt cake.

Soooooo yummy! I made it pretty much as written, only a few minor changes. 
For the sour cream, I did sub half of it with light sour cream, as I needed to use some up.
I also added  some Penzeys cake spice into the topping mixture. 
Put half the batter into a well sprayed bundt pan, added topping, and then added the remaining batter. Took about 50 min in the oven, kept it at 350.
Let it cool for an hour or two, and flipped it out.
Brought to church in the morning, and it was gobbled right up!

I made it in bundt pan as other reviewers did.  I also made 1 1/2 times the filling and baked it in the middle of the cake.  Part of the cake did end up sticking in the pan but it had a very nice flavor.  Was sort of difficult to slice because it was crumbly. Overall a very good dish though, not too sweet for the morning.

So good! The only change I made to the cake was to use 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of all sour cream.  After 35 minutes the cake did not seem quite done so I baked for an extra 5 and it was perfect.  It came out so moist!  I used 1.5 times the amount of topping, but I might double it next time.

SO GOOD. I made this in the bundt version for a brunch this morning and it turned out great! I had to omit the pecans because my friend is allergic, so I was a little worried but it was still fantastic! Can't wait to try it with the pecans next time! Thanks so much!

I love this recipe. I baked in a bundt pan and put the streusel in the middle. I also made a quick glaze out of powdered sugar, milk and vanilla and drizzled over the top when it was done. It is so moist and delicious! It is the kind of food you want to serve with copies of the recipe close by because people will ask for it!

Amazing flavor, very moist, and easy for even a non-baker to get right! I mixed up the batter and left in it the fridge overnight, then put it on the counter to warm up for a half hour before baking the next morning. The top is too pretty to invert underneath, so I just served the pieces out of the pan. My only complaint is that the tin foil tears and sticks to the pieces if you serve it this way, so next time I'd skip it altogether. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this coffee cake for my dad this morning and he loved it.  Took half of it home to eat for breakfast for the next two days.  I added one cup of fresh blueberries and used 2 cups and 4T of cake flour instead of all-purpose flour.  I did use the foil as recommended; the cooking time was almost 50 minutes but worth the wait.  I will defintely make this again!

Very good coffee cake. I doubled the streusel topping and put half in the middle of the cake and the other half on top.  I dont see any need to put the foil in the pan first..i didnt and mine came out just fine.

This was sinful! I didn't have enough butter so I used 1/2 butter & 1/2 butter flavored shortening. My topping sank but that was my fault, I doubled it & I think I had too much margarine. It wasn't crumbly. Next time I will watch for that. I also used a mix of pecans & walnuts. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent coffee cake! I doubled the topping(like I do on about every coffee cake), and it was wonderful. I got a ton of compliments on it! A+++++ I didn't do the foil thing either; didn't seem to be necessary.

Recipe is moist and good, BUT!!! I agree with a few that says something is missing out of the basic batter mixture. It is bland as stated.  So this is what I'm going to try the next time I make this. YES I'm going to make it again..INSTEAD of the 1 cup of sour cream, I'm going to use 1/2 cup of sour cream + 1/2 cup of whipping cream + 1 Teaspoon of sugar + 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  I think this should take care of that bland flat taste.  Also baking time for me had to be increased for 5 minutes, took 40 minutes to bake in the bundt pan. Again very moist but needs some added ingredients.  Hope this helps you. As I think it will help the recipe.

I totall loved this recipe and I made two and took them to work and nothing was left but crumbs. I did learn that a bundt pan works much better.  Everyone thought it was bought and not made home made.  I loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I made three of these coffee cakes today for a meeting. I used the original recipe but without the pecans. I used 1 cup of chopped walnuts with 1/2 cup of chocolate chips on the first one, 1 cup of macadamia nuts and a 1/2 cup of shredded coconut on the second and just macadamia nuts on the third. [I did take the advice of a Reviewer above and did add a pinch of salt (about 1/4 tsp.)after I sprinkled the topping over the entire cake.) 

All three cakes were completely devoured and everyone loved them. This is a very good recipe and is really better when served cool or at room temperature. Follow the recipe but that little extra bit of salt really brings out the flavor of the cinnamon and butter on the top. 
(I also didn't use the aluminum foil and had used a baking spray in the 13x9 pans and left the cakes in the pans! Its easier to clean up and easy to serve cut squares of the coffee cakes.)

This is a stellar coffee cake recipe. I made it last might to take to a meeting at work today, and am glad that there was a piece or two to bring home. I took the advice of several other reviewers and used a 9x9" pan for the cake and let it bake for 45 minutes, testing it after 35 minutes. I added 2 tbsp of flour to the topping mixture and reduced the pecans to 3/4 cup (and did mix the topping with my fingers). Since I only had 3/4 cup of sour cream, I increased the volume to 1 cup with 2% milk. The result was fabulous, there was no sinking in the middle as others have described, the top browned beautifully, and the cake's taste is superb (the 1 tbsp of vanilla adds a lovely flavour). Thanks for sharing the great recipe!

first of all - I love that this recipe uses good whole ingredients (no cake mixes). I was looking at a cake mix the other day and decided NO MORE. Too many funky ingredients. Simple ingredients are just as easy and you know what's in the cake then!

I have made this several times the night before. I used a bundt pan and baked for 50 min at 350°. I put half the cake mixture, then filling, then cake mixture in the pan. After it cools a bit, I seal the whole thing, including the pan in my big 26 cup Tupperware bowl until the next morning. When I want to take it out, I put the pan in hot water for a few mins and it turns right out on my cake stand beautifully! Locking the moisture in overnight makes it super moist. To finish it off I mix a little powdered sugar and water in a ziploc baggie, cut the corner and drizzle it over. It turns out tasting like it's straight from the bakery and I've gotten rave reviews. Awesome recipe!!!

Mmmmm... just delicious! I didn't add the pecans because my husband can't have nuts and he loved cinnamon so I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon, also used brown sugar in lieu of white in the cake. Smelt heavenly in the oven and I couldn't wait until he got home, I had to try a piece still warm. Delicious! This will be my only coffeecake from now on. Thanks a ton for sharing.

This was the best coffee cake I have ever made! I did not have enough sour cream so I had half cream cheese, half sour cream. Also I did not have any vanilla extract so I used almond instead. When it came out of the oven I added small drizzles of honey on top. This was a very moist recipe and the top came out crisp, which is my favorite part of coffee cake :)

I am writing this recipe down for keeps! The only thing I changed was I used vanilla yogurt because I didn't have any sour cream and I doubled the topping and added 1/2 to the middle of the cake before cooking. I also used a bunt pan-it took about an hour to cook.

I served this within a few hours of making it and it was pretty good.  However, the leftovers the next day were AMAZING.  The cake was moist and the topping was the perfect amount of sweetness.

I followed some of the other reviews and doubled the topping, toasted the pecans, crumbled the topping with soft butter (not melted)  and added 1 TBSP of flour to prevent sinking.  I also used 1/2 c of applesauce in place of 1/2 c of butter and did half almond extract and half vanilla extract.

Very good!
I baked in a springform using the tube insert.  Rose all the way up to the top!
I did double the topping though, because I added some in between layers of batter as well as on the top.  Since I did that, I lowered the white sugar to 1 cup.  Could maybe try doing 1-1/2 times the topping mix.
You must gently fold in the flour as directed.
I included a pic as well.

Sweet and rich...just the way coffee cake should be.  I made the recipe as it calls for...my only problem was cooking time.  I had to cook it for about 40 minutes and then I broiled it for a few minutes to give it some color and a caramelized top.

this is a great recipe, tastes like it came out of an entenmann's box, without all of the added junk of course.  i used fat-free yogurt instead of sour cream, just because i didn't have any sour cream, and it turned out great.  i would double the recipe for the streusel so that you can sprinkle in between the cake as well as the top (from the bottom up: cake, streusel, cake, streusel).

The cake was pretty dense for my tastes. The flavor was outstanding. I upped the cinnamon in the topping to 1 Tbls. Everyone gobbled it up though!

The results of this recipe was very good.  The cake was moist and light.  I used about 1.5 cups of chopped Pecans and almost 1.5 teaspoons because my family really likes both of those ingredients.  I'll make this Coffee Cake several more times for my co-workers and family.
Enjoy,
Walt

Wow, this was soooooooo good. I've made quite a few coffee cakes in my time, but I think this is my new favorite. I halved the recipe and my family finished the 8x8 pan in 2 days. :)

Honestly, I prefer every other coffee cake recipe I've ever tried. I was expecting this to be great--it's super unhealthy and the batter smelled heavenly--unfortunately it was just a little too sweet without the rich, almost creamy flavor that makes coffee cake so great. I honestly don't know how that's possible given the ingredients, but I certainly will not be making this again. I'm just sad that now my husband and I are stuck with an entire pan of unhealthy and poor-tasting coffee cake.

I have made this cake more than 100 times.  I don't ever review a recipe I have changed.  I make this exactly as written.  This coffee cake is in fact amazing.  It is always moist with just enough air and just enough density. The flavor is also great.  Spices could be changed to suit tastes but the cake itself is great.  I don't change a thing and the only guests who don't enjoy it are those with nut allergies.  I have never made it without nuts but it would still be a great cake.

Nice but not amazing.  A lot of sugar and fat. I do not understant why the foil for the botton of the pan and if you use a bundt pan, the topping is going to be on the botton of the pan when you turn it out unless you put it all in the middle.  You could put it in the botton of the pan and then add the batter but then it seems it would be very hard to remove from the pan.  As for doubling the topping, I do not think it is supposed to completely cover the cake, even more sugar, just my opinion.

This was a huge hit and I'll definitely make it again. As suggested, made the bundt version and increased filling to 1.5X recipe and put in the middle. Upped cinnamon too, though not sure I will next time around. Dusted with powdered sugar. Beautiful.

Moist cake with a rich flavor and satisfying texture that the family all loved, young and old.  It was a perfect addition to our Christmas brunch.  I followed the recipe closely aside from adding a teaspoon of almond extract to the batter and making 1 1/2 the topping (which was a good idea, it wouldn't have covered the whole cake otherwise).  My edges got a little overcooked because I felt the middle wasn't quite done, so if I make it again, I'll reduce the oven temperature and let it cook longer.  However, after sitting in a covered dish all night, even the dry edges were relatively moist.  I didn't use the foil, just cooking spray, and the cake lifted out fine.  Great recipe, will use it again... thanks!

This was my first time making coffee cake and I needed to find something to make for the breakfast that we were hosting at work today. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out so good. It was full of flavor and the texture was perfect, not to mention the wonderful aroma that it gave while it was cooling in my car. I actually made it very early and carried it of to work. It was a beauty coming out of the oven. I used the 9x13 pan and all I did extra was sprinkle confectioners sugar over the crumb topping while it was cooling. It really gave it a gorgeous look. Next time I will go for the bundt pan to try something new. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.

I followed the recipe exactly as is and it turned out wonderful. I've never made a coffee cake with sour cream before, but it makes all the difference in the world. It was so moist and rich. This is definitely a keeper.

I thought this was a wonderful recipe.  I made it for an event at our church.  My only change is I used 1 tsp. almond flavoring, and 2 tsp. vanilla instead of all vanilla.  Very good!  I will definitely be making this again.  Very easy to make and came out perfectly.    I'm not a fan of the foil on the bottom because the cake stuck in a few places and pulling it out broke the cake.  Next time I'll use parchment instead.

I made this for our neighbors and they raved over it. I baked it in a Bundt pan, putting the topping in between 2 layers of cake batter. Baked for 55 minutes. Perfection! Thanks! I'll make it again soon so we can try it! :)

I just make this cake last weekend and OH BOY ! IT IS GOOD. This is just absolutely DELICIOUS. I made it in a Bunt  pan as another viewer did. NO  modifications necessary whatsoever. It looked so BEAUTIFUL and smells so GREAT ! The cinnamon and the brown sugar with the pecans. I can hardly contain myself. This is  "ONE" you CAN'T let get away. It's exactly what the names says it is. AMAZING ! PLEASE TRY IT !

I followed the directions of a reviewer that made this in a Bundt pan.  I followed the recipe to a tee, used a Bundt pan for the time recommended by that reviewer and tested the cake for doneness as instructed.  It fell miserably and all the topping sank to the bottom, sticking to the pan and tearing the top off when I inverted it.  It tastes OK, but I've never seen a cake fall like that before!  I have to remake it--but I'll be using a different recipe this time!

This is an Amazing coffee cake.. I used the 9x13 pan and next time will use a tube pan with some of the Pecan mixure in the middle. It didn't last 2 days in the house one of those things you grab a bite everytime you pass it! Yummy! A diffent front of the recipe box recipe! And very simple to make..

Yum!! My kids LOVE this, I've also scooped the batter into a muffin-paper lined tin and used the topping on the muffins. My kids LOVE this!

This is an excellent recipe.  I tweaked it a bit (couldn't help it).  None of my roommates do nuts, so I left them out and doubled the sugar/cinnamon mixture instead.  It was pretty awesome, though I would've preferred the nuts.  The cake is fluffy and substantial, and the sugar/cinnamon part caramelizes and leaves sweet, chewy bits throughout.  I like to layer mine; they come out pretty and there's a sweet, cinnamon-y taste in every bite that way.  The only trick to this recipe is figuring out how to get this stuff out of the pan.  I can line the bottom of a 13x9 pan with parchment and it comes off alright, but it's death in a bundt pan.  I've tried PAM, butter, shortening and flour, nothing I've tried works.  Any suggestions?

This is a very good cake. I have made it several times and I love it (so does my picky husband).  I like adding the topping after the cake is cooked, but it taste good either way.

This was awesome!  I've made it in a bundt pan a few times.  It's become my "go to" when guests are in town.  The sour cream makes it so moist!  And it does keep well in a cake dome, maintaining its moistness.  I use about half vanilla and half almond extract(because I LOVE almond) and it gives it a great depth of flavor.

I made this for a business meeting and it was very well received.  I do think there was a tad too much topping, which was a little dry and crumbly, making it a bit messy. Next time I might try to put some in the middle of the cake and add a tablespoon of butter to the topping to help it crumb better.  A delicious cake overall and great with coffee!  I will definitely make this again.

I made this for a breakfast birthday party.  I arrived 15 minutes late (trying to finish making this coffee cake) and everybody had already starting eating.  Someone tried the coffee cake, said how good it was, and everybody else had to try it, too.  There was only one piece/serving left.  It was a hit!  I doubled the topping, as some reviewers had suggested.  I didn't have quite enough vanilla extract so added some almond extract.  It was delicious!  Will make this again for the family reunion in April.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This really IS amazing!  I tried making it in loaf pans instead of a 9x13 pan. Wasn't a good idea.  The body of the cake was too light and didn't hold up.  It is an absolutely wonderful recipe.  So yummy I felt guilty eating it for breakfast!

Nice basic recipe.  I would double the topping next time.  Easy to make & set up well (easily turned over and foil came off easy, holding it's shape until it could be flipped over onto a dish).

My daughter just made this coffee cake for her 4H baking project.  She won champion coffee cake!  The other judges even came over to taste it because the cake judge was raving about it!  This will definitely be added to my recipe book!

Loved the suggestion to bake in a bundt pan with the topping in the middle. I dusted with powdered sugar and it was lovely to look at & delicious. No need to double the nut/butter/sugar mixture. Make sure to butter & flour your bundt pan for a perfect cake!

I was looking for a recipe for Coffee Cake one day and just knew this was going to be a good one, but I had no idea how marvelous and delicious this would turn out to be.  We have made and given away so many of these cakes and my brother in law just asked for the recipe. What a find!

I’ve made this many times now and every time it turns out great. I’ve used all butter, all margarine, and a combination of both, always good. The only change I make is using 1.5 time the amount of topping called for.

I doubled the topping and had to extend the baking time, but this cake turns out great everytime.  My family loves it and it's always all gone by the end of the same day that I make it.

Sorry, but we did not like this at all.  The topping just doesn't cover the entire cake and sank into the batter.  Won't be making this again.

This is a wonderful recipe. I made it in a bundt pan with topping in the middle as well as on top. I had a little trouble removing the cake from the pan, but "patched" it back together with some icing which also acted as glue for the topping to stick to.  The group I brought it to really liked it!  Will definitely make it again.

Really good recipe. I made it for our Bible Study, and ended up emailing a link to it to one of the women that evening. I didn't have sour cream, but successfully substituted plain yogurt. Also, I added almond extract, like I always do, and it was fantastic. -Also, the crunchy topping was very satisfying!

This is a rich, moist coffee cake that is so wonderful.  Instead of using pecans, I used walnuts.  I doubled the batch of walnut mixture, spread half of the batter in the dish and then put half of the nut mixture on top, rest of batter on top of that and the remaining nuts on top.  I also added about a teaspoon more cinnamon to the recipe.  It tastes like I was eating a Cinnabon coffee cake!

I thought this was great!  The only thing I did different was double the topping like suggested in another review--I like the crunchy stuff!  Maybe that would fix what some people find to be bland; I didn't think it was at all.  It was even better the next day!

I made mini bread loafs out of this recipe and they turned out wonderful.  Very moist!!  I did not use the foil and it worked just fine.  Just make sure you spray the pan with cooking spray.  Will make again.

This had great taste! Unfortunately, the top of the cake stuck to the bundt pan despite the pan being prepared properly. I will make again, however, I will probably prepare in a 13 x 9 and serve right out of that dish. Thank you.

I made this for my senior card group. It was very good BUT
I agree that there is too much topping on it. Way too sweet and the sugar was quite messy on the card table. Next time I would put it in a bundt pan and half the topping or even eliminate it altogether. Very moist and lovely flavour. Very easy to throw together if you are in a hurry. The ladies enjoyed it a lot.

This coffee cake was extremely moist and tender.  I wish I would have swirled some of the topping into the batter.  Also, it was almost too sweet.  Next time I may reduce the brown sugar and increase the cinnamon. Mine was perfectly done at 35 minutes using a metal baking pan.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I love this coffee cake and have made it several times. I do 1 1/2 times for the topping. The cooking time at 350 for 35 minutes never cooks it enough any my oven works fine. I think the temp should be 375 for 35 or 350 for 40+ minutes so the center is fully cooked.

This was excellent! I made it for my mom for mother's day and served it warm with Tillamook Stumptown Coffee ice cream. It was a HUGE hit! I think the  amount of topping was just right, and I also cut down the sugar a bit, to 1-1/3 cups, because our family doesn't tend to like things super-sweet. It was just right! Also I used walnuts instead of pecans for the topping because we prefer them. The cake was moist and soft, flavorful, and actually surprisingly light! (I did use low fat sour cream.) Only other modification was to throw a pinch of salt in the topping and also a pinch of cream of tartar in the wet mixture, at the same time as the eggs, to discourage it from falling flat. Sure enough, at 30 minutes on the dot it was ready to come out of the oven and it didn't sink at all. Marvelous!!!

I added additional sour cream and about 1/4 c. milk because the batter was too stiff.  Baked the cake in a bundt pan and it came out beautifully.  Had to bake additional 25 minutes.  Will definitely make it again, was asked by several women for the recipe.  Used sugar coated cinnamon pecans  I had on hand and then just chopped them and added to bottom and middle of cake butter.  Yummy

This was the best coffee cake ever! It was gobbled up by the entire family. I followed the recipe to the letter and it was perfect. (I have also made it as a 6 serving size in an 8x8 pan and it turned out just as great!)

I made this cake with just a few and I mean a few changes. I did adjust oven temperature to 325 and baked for at least 45 minutes. I did up my topping or filling to 1.5 the amount suggested. When mixing the dry ingredients to the other do not over mix!! It will not turn out as good and the filling/topping will settle to the bottom. Instead of greasing and flouring the pan I use Bakers Joy baking spray with flour.  I have made this for various occasions and it goes FAST!!  I hoped this will help someone else. GOD bless!!

I didn't use foil but rather just greased the pan well, and there were no problems with it coming out ok.  My family and friends said I could make this any time I wanted!  Thanks, DWBH!

This was very good and very easy to make. I used my temptations dish and no foil with no problems. I left off a star because I wouldn't call it amazing, it is a little plain.

Boat coffee cake ever! Perfect as written, but I'll add cardamom & nutmeg next time. I used a bundt pan, sprayed it with no-stick baking spray and dusted it with flour-the cake came out of the pan very easily.

FABULOUS! Followed exact recipe and it was a sensation with my family, even those whom don't like pecans, and a husband that proclaims that he does not like sweets.  I am a conservative cook, however I will double the Pecan Topping mixture next week!  Read the reviews!

Delicious recipe as written! For best results do not use light or reduced fat sour cream, stick with real butter, and do not over-bake it. I've made this recipe over and over & I'm always asked for the recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly except for skipping the foil lining in the pan, and it turned out beautifully! I'm not sure why the foil is there because it came out of the pan with no trouble, and it was perfectly moist (ie, it didn't burn or dry out). Definitely making this again!

This is a tasty coffee cake for sure.  I made about 50% more of the topping because I wanted to put it in the middle as well as on the top.  Baked mine in two loaf pans and they had to bake for about 10-15 minutes longer.  I didn't use the foil because I didn't read that part of the instructions but I don't see the point of it.  Used Wilton cake release and it came out no problem.

I would call this cake DANGEROUS!!!  It is EXTREMELY good and simple to make.  It was gone super fast between myself, my husband, and 2 teenage daughters.  I was trying to multitask and made this while doing some other things and accidently left out the vanilla and STILL delicious. (I really like vanilla, BTW)  Try this.  You will NOT be sorry.  Will make over and over.

I just made this recipe and...whoa. SO good. I just wanted to get rid of some sour cream in my fridge and thought this would make for a nice snack. The ONLY thing i changed was i used about 1/4 cup less sugar. Just because a lot of reviews said it was way too sweet. And since i don't plan on having it with coffee (trying to cut back) i knew that making it a little less sweet would make it easier to eat on its own. Otherwise i followed everything exactly. Although, i don't understand the point of the foil? I didn't "flip it out" because then all my topping would be on the bottom... It was nice to just lift out the foil though and pop the whole thing on a wire rack. But otherwise, i don't see the point of the foil..
I didn't have an issue with the topping sinking. Actually, i thought the batter was wayyyy too thick and that it was going to come out weird, but it didn't! It's perfect and delicious. 
Definitely going to be making this again.

It was good.  I took out 1/4 cup of the white sugar, but left everything else the same.  I also used two smaller cake pans instead of one, and it took about 45-50 minutes for both to cook through.

This recipe is good, but I am not in love. I added a 1/2 tsp. of almond extract, like some suggested, but I didn't care for it. I made this in a bundt pan and made extra topping. It didn't need the extra topping, and overall, I didn't find the cake to be very moist. I may try again with only vanilla extract and in a regular cake pan.

This coffee cake is AMAZING. I rarely give any recipe 5 stars, but this one deserves it.  So moist & buttery.  I did use one tablespoon of almond extract & everyone who tasted it agreed that they would use almond instead of vanilla.  I am thinking about making muffins or putting it in a bundt pan as others suggested.  I did not use the foil, just greased the pan & cut it out of the pan as we ate it.

Very delicious and very moist! I doubled the topping and put it on the bottom of the bundt pan in the middle of the batter and at the top...yummm. I didn't have sour cream and used greek yogurt instead and it tasted great. I also added a little almond flavoring. I will definitely make this again!

I followed the recipe exactly and this came out perfectly! I don't generally like sour cream so I admit I was a little worried it would be too tangy but it was absolutely divine! Just make sure you have a glass of milk nearby :)

Great coffee cake!  I am always happy when a recipe "formula" can withstand necessary changes for health reasons or simple lack of ingredients.  I wanted to omit the nuts due to a guest with allergies and I needed to sub the sour cream as I was out. I ha fat free mayo on hand and thought... why not?  I also used sodium free baking powder and skipped the salt due to other diet restrictions.  I added nutmeg and almond extract with the vanilla.  The cake turned out wonderfully light and had a nice crumb.  I used a bunt pan and my cake took an additional 35 minutes to bake through.  We thoroughly enjoyed the cake and no one was missing the original ingredients.  So glad to have an adaptable recipe like this - it is a keeper!

I made this last week and its delicious. I used some of the other suggestions and made it in a bundt pan. Putting the topping in the middle rather than on top. Very tasty. Will make again.

Absolutely delicious. I doubled the pecan topping and added to middle and top of cake. I was concerned it would be too sweet, but it wasn't. It was wonderful. These types of cakes are best the next day. YUMMY!

This is by far my favorite coffee cake! I made it in the bunt pan. It is moist, and I love the filling. I put some streusel in the bottom of the pan, then half the batter, the remaining streusel filling in the center and then the remaining batter. I baked it for about 50 minutes.  Enjoy!

Nice and moist with great flavor. However, I live at high altitude (7000 feet) and this cake fell. Don't know if I just need to raise the oven temp or if I need to fiddle with the ingredient measurements. I'll definitely try this one again though.

It IS amazing! I did double the topping. I had a  hard time trying to remove the cake from the pan. It seemed it would break apart, so I just left it in the pan. I ate some while warm and it was yummy. Took the rest to work for co-workers, and it is still wonderful cold.

This was good, but not as good as the pecan muffins I make. The cake was sweet. To ensure moistness, as others stated it was on the dry side, I added an extra egg. Next time, I may make additional topping, as this didn't seem to be enough.

This recipe produces an absolutely delicious coffee cake! I make it as directed for events, but I crave this so often I’ve also made some changes when I make it for my family. Rather than 1 cup of butter, I use 1/4 cup butter, 3/4 unsweetened applesauce, and slightly increase the amount of light sour cream (~1 1/4 cups). I leave everything else the same. That still produces an amazing, buttery coffee cake, and I don’t feel like I have to have my cholesterol checked afterward ;)

AMAZING! the second time i made this i eyeballed ingredients and it turned out just as good as the first time, moist and delicious. just do not let it get to brown- a light brown on bottom is perfect, remember you still have to let it sit for a 20 min or so dont let it get too brown. enjoy!

This coffee cake is amazing! I was worried it wouldn't be as tasty because I had to sub 1/3 of the sour cream with vanilla yogurt, but it turned out great! I cooked it in a bundt pan, with the pecan mixture in the middle. Excellent!

This coffee cake was for sure amazing! It is so moist and flavorful. I really liked how the cake was not too dense or too fluffy, it is just perfect. The only thing I did different was I used a 8 by 11 inch pan instead since I wanted thicker pieces and I didn't bother lining the pan with foil, I just greased the pan. Since I used a glass pan I turned down the oven tempature to 325 degrees and it took about 50 minutes to bake with the smaller pan. My family loved this, I served this great coffee cake to them this afternoon with tea. Thanks for the great recipe!

When first reading the directions for making this it seems like a lot but once you make it it isn't bad. Just more reading then anything! I gave this a 4 only because I think it was a tad bit too sweet. It also needed to cook for 40 minutes instead of the 35. Will keep and make again- just maybe 1/4 c. less sugar.

A few people tried to snag pieces of the topping right off this lovely cake.  Easy to put together.  I had to leave it in the oven almost for almost 50 minutes before my toothpick came out clean.

This was a really good basic coffee cake. I made it in the bundt pan as others did. I had no problems with it falling apart although I ended up not using all the streusel.

omg completely amazing! I didn't change a thing and this came out with a delicious, buttery, melt-in-your mouth flavour. It was best served warm right after baking but managed to keep for 48 hours with a reheat from the microwave. An absolute staple in my books, thanks so much for this recipe!

Excellent recipe. Didn't have a bundt pan. Wish I would have because topping did crush cake. It didn't hurt flavor, though. Was quick to do.

Great texture overall!  Crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy in the middle.  Tasted it right out of the oven, and I just wanted to devour the whole pan.   Tastes good warm with a nice glass of milk.

Loved it so much, I used disposable pans and made one for each of my neighbors to enjoy Christmas morning! The day after Christmas, one neighbor actually asked me if I happened to have more!

Delicious!  I cut the recipe in half and baked it in a round cake pan.  I did not make any changes to the recipe.  It was very moist and so easy to make!  I like that I already had all the ingredients on hand.  I imagine it would even be good if you didn't have any pecans in your pantry.  Try it!  :)

This coffee cake was delicious. Melts in your mouth. I added 1/2 tsp. of cardamon to the pecan topping along with the cinnamon and made it in a tube pan. this is a keeper for sure.

This is the best coffee cake I have ever had!  I followed the recipe (except for the foil in the pan) and it turned out perfect.  The cake is so moist and the topping adds just enough sweetness.  If you are looking for a very simple, classic coffee cake this is it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Wow!!! Amazing!!! This is the fluffiest coffee cake I have ever tasted! I used low fat sour cream  (that was all I had on hand) - and it still turned out great. After eating 1/4 of the entire cake, my husband declared this is new favorite breakfast goodie (which says alot for this recipe, but makes me sad for the other breakfast sweets I've been making and perfecting for years. . . lol) Needless to say, this is DEFINITELY a keeper!!

Let this cake sit overnight before serving.  It is worth the wait.  The night I made this cake and tasted it warm, I was so unhappy because the cinnamon mixture was too overpowering and gooey.  After the cake sits and the sugar topping hardens...it tastes amazing!  Oh, and I just sprayed my pan...no foil.

This truly is an amazing coffee cake! I didn't want such a huge pan, so I cut the recipe in half and baked it in my 8" square pan instead. It worked out really well. The only problem I had with this recipe was that most of my streusel sank into the cake...which made these delicious pockets  all throughout the cake, but it really didn't look all that beautiful. The cake itself was amazing...tender, moist, with a beautiful light crumb. The pecan streusal added just the right touch. I'll certainly be making this again...thanks for sharing!

Very good and very rich.  I had to bake a little longer than noted.  I added a little more topping than called for, never too much of a good thing.

Great taste. Not the lightest dessert, but really really tasty! For me personally, the topping ingredients should be doubled in amount for a richer taste... But I love the cake itself. And I followed the directions step by step.

This cake was light and flavorful.  I used almond flavoring instead of vanilla.  Either flavoring would be wonderful.  Next time I plan to make double the topping and place some in the middle of the cake or double on top.  It was delicious. Gone in two days at my house.

Great  topping! Cake itself  is way  too super-sweet. Had to throw it away.  Would recommend using about  half or perhaps two thirds of the recommended sugar in the batter. The consistencey of the cake itself was wonderful. It was  just inedible due to its extreme suggaryness. I don't like things  that are super sweet like this cake is! I generally dont' like cake frostings either.

MMM...what a wonderful coffee cake. I absolutely loved the pecan topping. It really took this cake over the top! Because the cake is pretty plain on it's own. I baked my cake for only 30 minutes and took it out the oven when I got a few moist crumbs on the toothpick instead of leaving it to come out totally clean. This really made the cake melt in your mouth. This is definitely going to be a regular dessert for me! Thanks for sharing such a delicious recipe.

Nice taste.  Light cake(a little crumbly).  I made a double batch of the topping without the nuts.  The brown sugar mixture was wet, not crumbly and it sort of sank into the batter.  Still tasted good though!  Anyone else have this situation?

Very tasty and easy to make.  Followed directions (except no foil-used Pam with flour and had no problem getting the cake out of the pan)  Next time will double the topping, very good.

I think if I would have just made it in a 9 x 13 pan I would have been fine, but decided to do it in a bunt pan as others did.  Most of it came out, but tried to put it together since I'm serving it to my Sunday School class.  It looks terrible, but tastes pretty good.  I didn't put the topping on the bottom, but only in the middle and on the top.  I let it sit in the pan for 10 min. and then turned it out.  It fell.  So what was a tall cake is about 1/2 of what it was.  Maybe too much topping, not sure.  I will make it again, but this time in a 9 x 13 pan.

This is probably the best coffee cake I've made.  I did add 1 tsp of cinnamon to the batter.  I didn't have pecans so I made my own crunch topping by using 1/2 c of quick oats, 1/4 of flour 3 TBL spoons of melted butter, 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 c. brown sugar.  Everyone loved the topping and the cake!

I think this recipe is great. Whenever I make it people ask me for the recipe. I add many different things to it, but my favorite by far is cranberry's and then I drizzel it with an orange glaze. YUMMMM

Oh so good! I made one for home, and one for my husband to take to work. I followed the recipe exactly as written. This cake has a great consistency. Highly recommend this recipe.

I didn't change a single thing for this recipe, and I never will.  It truly was amazing!  Moist and delicious; not dry like so many other coffee cakes.  I brought it to work and all I heard all day was either a)how awesome it was or b)how much everyone hated it (and me) since they're on a diet. :) Also, the topping may look like there's not quite enough, but once it all cooks, it's PERFECT.  Don't change anything!!  Also...definitely safe to cook the night before and serve the next day.  It stays quite fresh.

It came out a little dry for me, next time I will probably add applesauce to the mix to keep some of the moisture, but everything else about this recipe was perfect!! Thanks!

This wasn't amazing - but it was tasty (not worth 5 stars though).  I've made this twice - the first time was a disaster because the batter rose so much that the topping and batter spilled over (apparently the dish wasn't high enough).  

Made the second time in a much higher baking dish and it came out fine.  I would venture to say that 1 tablespoon of baking powder is a bit too much - especially since an ingredient like sour cream will activate the baking powder even more.  For those who want to cut back on calories/fat - you can easily substitute plain yogurt for the sour cream... it's the acid in the dairy that helps the batter rise, break down gluten, and yogurt also keeps the cake moist (so feel free to substitute with the same results).

My boyfriend tried the first piece and proceeded to eat half of it!
Made it in a bundt mold with half batter, topping, batter, then topping. Also substituted sour cream with 1/2 cup yogurt,  and 1/2 cup applesauce. Let it sit on the windowsill and it popped right out. Super moist!

This was great--had guests over for coffee and they loved it. I didn't use the foil, just sprayed the pan with Pam (the baking kind, with flour) and it worked fine. Also used 1 and a half times the topping, as per lots of reviewers, and that was good advice too. Thanks everyone!

My 12 year old son made this as a surprise breakfast and it was wonderful!  He said he read the reviews and he substituted almond extract in place of vanilla extract.  We didn't have enough pecans so he used 1/2 cup chopped pecans and 1/2 cup chopped almonds together.  In place of the cinnamon he used chocolate cinnamon (the kind for flavoring coffee).  He said he tossed in an extra handful of flour to make it fluffier.  I can't believe how good it was.

Fantastic. I didn't have enough sour cream so I used about 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 plain yogurt. I also halved the recipe and it fit nicely into a pie dish. I still needed to cook it for the full amount of time.

oh my gosh, what a hit!  my one and only recommendation is to wait before you put the topping on because as others  have said, the nuts will sink in.  what a delight.

I took this to work for a "brunch" and it was gone in minutes.  What a hit!

I more than doubled the pecan topping mixture and it took an hour to bake.

This will definately make it's appearance again.

Honestly, that was a really good coffee cake,better than the other ones I've made, even though they weren't bad either.Everyone in the family loved it. Moist and very flavorful. I baked it in a round bundt cake pan. I first poured half of the batter in the pan, and sprinkled half the pecan topping over it. Then, topped it with the other half of the batter and topped it with the rest of the pecan mixture. Came out really good. Baked a little longer than asked for, but it depends on the oven. thank you for that awesome recipe!

I made the mistake of melting the butter instead of just using softened butter.  But it came out great anyway!  I doubled the topping (which I HIGHLY recommend!)  And I debated on putting pecan's in or not since I was taking to our MOPS group and didn't know about nut allergies.  I am sure glad I used them!  I couldn't imagine this WITHOUT them!  It adds so much flavor! (I put a note on dish stating there were pecans in it)  I also think I put too much butter in the topping as it sank a little, but it still turned out beautiful and delicious!!  I'm planning to make again this weekend for Easter bkfast!  Thank You!!

Whoa - Amazing.  My boyfriend says, "Fluffy and delicious".  thats saying something!  I made 1.5x the topping and it tastes beyond good.  The sour cream is what really makes the cake so good...and of course, butter and sugar!  Thanks for the post!

This is DEFINITELY five stars.  I just made it for my husband to take to work with him and it smelled so good coming out of the oven we couldn't resist eating it ourselves.  So we did.  And I'm not a bit sorry because it is unbelievable.  The best coffee cake I've ever had.  I only had a 10.5 inch springform, so I had to adjust the amounts accordingly, because the area of the springform was less than that of the 9x13.  So, that meant using only 75% of the cake ingredient amounts, but I left the topping amounts as original, since most reviewers suggested increasing them anyway.  I also added 1/2 cup of coconut.  I had to bake for 40 minutes.  It came out beautiful, moist, and scrumptious.  It was heavenly.  Thank you so much!!!

Made a coffee cake using this recipe but changing some things. Put a middle layer of topping with walnuts and made the top one with both walnuts and pecans. Also added more sour cream than was called for. Just got done baking. Smells and looks awesome. Good recipe.

I was looking for a simple coffee cake to whip up in a hurry and this fit the bill perfectly!  It was so great!  I skipped the aluminum foil step (I'm not sure what purpose that serves?) and I used fat free sour cream and it was perfect - I mean "AMAZING"! ;-)

OMG, this is an amazing coffee cake.  I did as others suggested and increased the topping to 1-1/2 of what is called for and that was a perfect amount.  I changed nothing else.  This cake is moist and tender and the topping is sweet and crunchy.  Incredible cake!

I made this on the weekend and EVERYONE who I served it to loved it. It was divine. Light, easy to make, and perfect for after dinner.

I changed the cinnimon (I cannot eat it. The smell even makes me feel sick. Not cool) with kahlua for an interesting twist.

This was quite good. I took the advice of previous reviewers and made 1 1/2 times the amount of topping called for. I only used about 3/4 of the amount of sugar called for and it was perfect. I don't think I let it cook quite long enough and next time will leave it in a few more minutes. I took it to the office for breakfast and it was all gone by the end of the day.

Melt in your mouth" is right!  This was fall-apart-tender, yet moist at the same time.  I did 1-1/2 times the topping recipe, which was perfect.  I had no problems with it sinking into the cake.  Baking time was 45 minutes.

I doubled the topping based on other reviews and it was great!  The cake went together easy, but I did bake it about 5 minutes longer - I think because I had extra topping on it.  Thanks!!!

Excellent.  Everyone enjoyed this.  I used half cream cheese and half sour cream, also doubled the topping mix as suggested, and poked some of it down in the batter before baking.  It took much longer than the 35 minutes to bake, closer to an hour to be done in the middle.

Out of all the things I served at a recent brunch, this coffee cake generated the most raves.  I had to 'fess up the recipe!!  It was the first time I had made it so I was nervous.  I followed the recipe exactly but used nonstick aluminum foil to line the pan and it turned out great!

This recipe is so good, I just added a little extra butter and brown sugar for the topping, I do that with all recipes. My husband and daughter loved it also, I don't think I'll make another coffee cake other than this one. Thank you!

Everyone at Christmas brunch said this was really good. In my Christmas baking frenzy, I ran out of brown sugar.  Not wanting to go to the store on Christmas Eve, I used regular sugar in place of the brown for the topping and it still turned out great.  It tasted kind of like a churro. The sour cream and butter make for a thick, rich batter.

Great recipe! I followed the directions except I used a bundt pan and it turned out great.  The batter is lumpy but it was moist and tasted super.  This is a definite keeper.

I loved the cake part but I too feel like it's missing something though I am not sure what. Unless every bite has a bit of the brown sugar it is a bit bland. I will make it again and see what I can come up with.

I followed the recipe to the letter - it turned out perfectly - 9x13 pan for 35 minutes. It's so moist and flavorful. The only thing I'd do differently is to mix in some topping halfway through pouring the batter into the pan, just to make it a little more interesting-looking.

This was just for my husband and me for a Christmas morning treat, so I halved the cake recipe but kept the full amount of topping. I made it the day before and we ate it heated with a touch of real butter while we had our Christmas morning coffee and it was absolutely the best coffee cake I have ever tasted. Tender and moist, with lots of toasty pecan flavor. This is THE Christmas morning breakfast from now on.

This was perfect!  Made it for my family to end the holiday break and to sweeten their mood just before they all go back to school.  I think it worked!  So thankful  for the recipe share!!  It was a great amount for a big family with some left overs for later.

I made this exactly as directions  say. (Sometimes I substitute plain Greek yogurt if I have that  on hand instead of sour cream.) 
I make this frequently and so far EVERYONE loves it! I made it for Thanksgiving this year and there was literally only 1 tiny piece left and I think that is only because no one wanted to be greedy and eat the 'last' piece.

Yes, I tweaked it a bit. I put about 4 oz. chopped pecans into the cake ingredients, and doubled the topping. Took it to Bible study and everyone loved it.

So I was looking for a recipe for coffee cake and came across this one, the “Amazing Pecan Coffee Cake.” I read through the recipe and found out that I have all the ingredients at home annnd it looked very easy to make; so I went to work in making the Amazing Pecan Coffee Cake.  I followed the instructions carefully and made this batter according to the recipe. Directions were very easy to follow. I did use a glass rectangular baking dish but opted out using the aluminum foil. I sprayed my baking dish with my nonstick olive oil spray (Great Value brand) and put the batter into the glass rectangular baking dish and spread evenly. I made the streusel topping as directed in the recipe, ( in the video it mentions to add two tablespoons of flour which I would highly recommend doing ) and sprinkled on top. NOW baking time for me was much longer. I set my oven to 350°for the 35 minutes. I took it out of the oven but it was not done at all.  I had put it back in for another 20 minutes and then it became done. So a total of 55 minutes. I took it out, let it cool on a cookie rack and once cooled, covered with plastic wrap and let rest for the next morning.  Next morning came around I cut out a few pieces, warmed them in the microwave for 12 seconds, pulled them out and served them to my family and to myself. We all took a bite, and heard I heard nothing but “ mmmm, mmmm, mmmm.”  It was a big hit in my family and will print this out and definitely make/bake it again. We all loved it!

Good taste,  but too much brown sugar in the toppings. Next time I will reduce the amount of brown sugar.

This was great. When I made it, I was starving, freezing and impatient. my measurements were approximate and threw it together like a crazy wo.an. it was still awesome. it had to bake a out 45 min though. Maybe because of higher altitude or sloppy measurements, but it was still awesome.

This was a hit at church pot luck.  I accidentally added another 1/2 c brown sugar to the batter.  No one thought it was too sweet!!

This turned out great! I used a 9x9 pan and it was just the right hight to add half the filling to the middle. We don’t live in the US and where we are we can’t get sour cream, but I subbed plain yogurt (dahi) for the sour cream. It worked out great. It’s a rich coffee cake though!

This was an excellent recipe.  Cut back on the white sugar by about 1/4 cup.  It was very light and had great vanilla flavor.  A keeper!

Great recipe!! I was short on resources so I cut this recipe in half and used a regular bread loaf pan - and added a few extra minutes - worked perfectly!!

I followed the recipe per instructions. I  knew this was a good recipe, but I was not prepared for the moist, fluffy,  flavorful deliciousness of this cake. I definitely will be making this cake again using this recipe. WOW!

The only change I made was to add 1 tsp Almond extract. I put 1/2 of the topping in the middle. Baked it at 350 in a bunt pan for 50 minutes. Delicious. I'm making it again right now!

This is my family’s all time favorite cake. I always make it bundt style with double streusel; half in the middle and half on top. It takes about 45” to bake doing it this way. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Oh my! This is delicious!!! My husband’s friend is over this morning and I decided to make this before he got here. I made it exactly like the recipe except I doubled the streusel topping, put some in the middle and the rest on the top. It’s very soft, moist and just yummy!!!!

Love this recipe. I made a bundt cake with this recipe substituting walnuts for pecans and mixed the butter and sour cream together instead of in the crumble and it turned out beautifully.

Wow this is a winner! Made this for Easter and everyone was raving. I used a 10” round springform pan. Used half walnuts half pecans and made a bit extra of the crumble bc the round pan called for more. The only thing I changed was that I added 1 tsp of almond extract to the batter, but this would taste great with only vanilla too. You could add fruit, chocolate chips, etc. The base of this cake is simply amazing. Lots of room to play here, which I love.

Yum!! I followed recipe as written. Very important to do! As another reviewer said,  the hand mixing is important,  as this cake is supposed to be a heavier cake.
Also I didn't have a problem with my topping ending up on the bottom.  Again,  I think that's from over mixing. 
Thank you very much for the recipe. It's a keeper!

This cake is amazing! So soft and moist! For the crumb topping, I doubled it like the reviews mentioned, and also didn’t use pecans because I didn’t want to spend more on it.  It was delicious! My girls gobbled it up!

It was amazing.  Like other reviewers, I did have to do a couple of things ... first, I wanted a bundt  version .. so you have to bake it longer (about 45 min) layer the cake mixture then strudel, then more cake, then more strudel.  I also double the strudel topping to have a really good layer.  I also made an icing (1 cup of confectioners to 2 tbs of whole milk) It was very yummy!

This was fantastic!  Made as directed except added 1 teaspoon of almond extract which really gave it a nice pop. Also made it in a bundt pan.  I put half the topping in on the bottom of the pan, half the batter in, the rest of the topping and then the last of the batter.  Cooked for 50 minutes.  Obviously the topping on the bottom was on top once I turned it over.  I used Bakers Joy spray and it popped out of the pan beautifully.  So yummy!

I’m flattered my family loves my cooking so when my husband requested a cinnamon pecan coffee cake for Christmas.....I knew the perfect place to come to.  I doubled the topping and put some in the middle and it literally makes the cake even better than I could have imagined.

I made it with gluten free flour (Bob Red Mill's 1 to 1) and I didn't have any sour cream, so I used plain vanilla yogurt and a splash of lemon juice! It was amazing. I took it to a breakfast potluck and every one loved it.

We had a workplace bake sale and this recipe was amazing! I use margarine instead of butter, pink sea salt instead of regular salt, and pure vanilla extract. 

I was the only one that sold out of deserts (and only in the first hour!). 

Definitely a make-again!

Absolutely delicious! I crushed the pecans so that they were very finely chopped and added mini semi sweet chocolate chips to the topping. The entire family love it!

this is so yummy.  I used pumpkin puree in place of the butter to cut the fat - still good and now has a beautiful orange tint - perfect for the fall.  Next time, I think I will cut the sugar - a little too much

I made this on a Wednesday and froze it for Saturday breakfast on a weekend get-away with extended family. Just set it out the night before. Everyone loved it. My go-to coffee cake recipe from now on.

I really liked this one! I have never made a coffee cake (as far as I can remember) but this was nice and simple to make but OMG is it good! I had a small piece tonight after making it. Hoping that it's still as good tomorrow morning. Will definitely be making this one again! :)

Very light and tasty - 4 of us ate half of it after a big spaghetti dinner!  The center was clearly uncooked though at 30 min-was quite ‘jiggly’. Not sure why that was.  It did sit for an hour or so before I put it in the oven so perhaps that caused the issue. Ended up adding another 20 min to baking.

Made this pecan coffee cake with a few changes due to the fact that I am lactose intolerant. I used a tofu based sour cream (Tofiti)and a vegan margarine (Becel)and it turned out great!

The cake came out fluffy and light, but also kind of light on flavor and not rich. I'm not a fan of the crumble, because it came out more as a crust than a true crumble. For me a coffee cake should be light and fluffy all the way through, not crusty at any point. It's a solid and enjoyable recipe for sure, but my coffee cake standards are high and this didn't make the mark. My husband disagrees and ate half the cake in one night, so YMMV.

I needed to make it gluten free, so just substituted the regular flour for Bob Mills gluten free flour and followed everything else exact and it was amazing.  Super moist and everyone loved it.  Definitely making again!

Delicious and super moist. Sometimes I leave the pecan sugar topping and keep it plain. It's like a pound cake then.  Or add in other flavors like lemon or orange. I also used plain yogurt instead of sour cream because I was out. Highly recommend!

This cake is fabulous! I used reviewer slin's suggestions, and baked it in a greased and floured bundt pan (was done in 50 minutes but my oven tends to take about 10 - 15 minutes longer.) I also doubled the topping and spooned it over half of the batter. I did not have any pecans, alas, but it was still very good. I've been looking for an easy recipe using ingredients that don't require an extra trip to the store and this definitely fit the bill. It will be my new go-to recipe.

Awesome recipe, I get tons of requests. If I don't have sour cream I use whatever flavor yogurt I have on hand it it still comes out great! Heads up, once cooled the sour bread that some people mention turns to sweet coffee cake. Absolutely delish!!

Very good, but almost too moist !! It was crumbling little when I was cutting it and when I was eating it.
I followed the recipe  exactly , without  using the aluminum foil. I buttered and floured the pan instead. I baked for 35 minutes.

So soft! I've always been taught not to let batter sit for too long after the leavening agent has been combined with the wet ingredients, so I made my crumble before making the batter.

I increased the topping amounts by 1/2 and layered 1/2 batter then half topping, then remaining batter, then remaining topping.   My wife and I love this recipe.

Made this for our Bible study group and it was a hit! I also made 1 1/2 topping. I made it into bundt pan, greased and lightly floured. I put half of my topping in the bottom, put half of my batter in, the other half of my topping followed by the remaining batter. The batter was much thicker than I had expected, but it came out perfect. Baked at 350 for 50 minutes. Toothpick came out clean. Let rest about 10-15 minutes, inverted, and let cool for a few hours. I also substituted a couple teaspoons of the vanilla with almond extract. Really liked that extra flavor. Next time I think I would cut back just a little bit of sugar and stick to the original amount of topping but still put some on the top and some in the middle.  I would also be a little more generous with greasing what will be the top because some of the topping did stick in the pan when I inverted it.

I made it as directed w/ no changes in the recipe. Used the same size pan. It did not rise much and the topping seemed to weigh it down so the finished product was thinner than shown in the photos. Possibly an altitude thing here in Albuquerque at 5600 feet. It was tasty for sure but I could not really say "Amazing!" I might make it again. My husband enjoyed it and I ate some of it too.

Made this and the smell alone had everyone in the house wanting to taste it.  Baked it the night before, and served it for breakfast.  My husband and children each had two large pieces.  I took half of it to work, and it was a big hit there as well.  I think I'll double the recipe the next time we have a staff breakfast, and bring two.

Excellent, I used plain Greek yogurt as I didn't have any sour cream, it was delicious!!!! I shared with several people and they also loved it, found to be very moist and tasty.

I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the base cake and subbed 5.3 oz container of Greek yogurt for the sour cream because that's all I had on hand.  I doubled the topping and added extra cinnamon and some cardamom.  Baked in a 9x13" pan.  The flavor was great, but it was really crumbly, even after it cooled.  Maybe because I was short on the "sour cream."

This coffee cake was absolutely delicious! I didn't have sour cream but I did have Greek yogurt and used that instead.  The vanilla and butter really stood out making it moist and delicious. My son is a health nut and was mad that I made this because he couldn't stop eating it. I will definitely make this again.

Ok, so I am not in the habit of writing reviews, but this coffee cake was amazing!  I made the batter at night and put it in the fridge, then threw it in the oven on Christmas morning.  It was the lightest, fluffiest, most delicious treat!  Then I froze the leftovers...and when reheated in the microwave it retained its fluffy light consistency and was just as delicious as when it came out of the oven.  The only changes I made were:  no pecans (my kids don't like them), doubled the topping recipe, and I accidentally forgot to put in the sour cream and it seemed dry, so I put in a splash of milk before realizing the sour cream had been left out and adding it in.  Absolutely the best coffee cake I have ever had--making it again now for my daughter's preschool.

I took MELSYMI's suggestion and put the streusel on the bottom and batter over it.  It came out too moist and would not hold it's shape well.  Next time I'll try it in a bundt pan. It was very delicious and everyone at the gathering crushed it within 15 minutes.

Followed the recipe and it turned out yummy and delicious. It was the best Pecan coffee cake I have ever made. Was short on the amount of pecans so I added walnuts. The flavor of the pecans still came through. Will be making it again

Made as stated with one substitution, Greek yogurt because I was out of sour cream, and it turned out delicious. Nice crumb, really moist. Baked in fluted bundt pan for 50 mins at 325 and it was perfectly done. Will make again.

Followed recipe exactly . After reading so many positive reviews I had very high hopes but fear that doomed me to disappointment! Found it to be bland. I won't make. It again.

I used 1/2 cup of coconut oil and 1/2 cup of butter.....amazing.  I also cut on the sugar  1 1/3 cup.  Next time I will do 1 1/4 until I get to 1 cup of sugar.  I'm sure it will be amazing as is....I just try making it healthier.

A nice coffee cake.  Very tasty, and I actually would prefer less nuts next time.  It wasn't as moist as I would like, but I used a silicone bundt pan, so maybe I need to adjust the temperature or cooking time.  Recipe made too much for me, so I froze half of it.  Hopefully it'll thaw well and still be a good breakfast for a busy workweek.  I would make it again.

Excellent recipe!! Everyone who's tried it, loved it! Only downfall is cooking time is t quite accurate. I have to go an hr and a half. No big deal. Tried following another reviewer's advice and place toppings on bottom, that was an epic fail, but didn't destroy the cake. Next time I'll add the topping towards the very end of cooking time to prevent collapse of the cake. Otherwise it's simply amazing!

This recipe is very good. I will make it again for sure! I followed the suggestion of using half of the topping in the middle and putting the rest on top. Great idea indeed. I baked them in cupcake molds. It yielded 18 in total! I got rave reviews!

It was sooooooo yummy. I modified some of the ingredients though.  I decreased white sugar to 3/4 cup instead of 1 1/2 cup, Increased the topping by 1 1/2 time and added 1 teaspon of cardamom to it as mentioned by one of the reviewers. I also put pecan mix in the middle of the cake instead of the top of the cake.

It was certainly amazingly delicious.  I cut down the sugar and used only one cup and followed suggestions and added 2 tablespoons flour to the topping.

This recipe turned out great! I was a little bit skeptical at first because of the sour cream, but I can assure you that you don't even taste it. The only thing I did differently was add a touch of nutmeg to the cinnamon, pecan, and brown sugar combination. The house still smells good hours later! 10/10

Follow recipe exactly .
I forgot to put 2 tbsp of butter to the cinnamon sugars . 
The dough is kinda thick , I use the spatula to scoop the dough from the mixing bowl into the bundt pan half way I sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture in , then put the rest of dough in , top it up with  cinnamon sugar again . 
I use bundt pan , so bake it  for 38 minutes .
It came out perfect . 
The sweetness just enough .
The sour cream made the cake so moist .
Love it .
Thanks for sharing .
I will do it again soon .

Everyone loved this. I used a bundt pan with topping on bottom. Flipped it out after an hour and came out perfectly. I substituted walnuts for pecans.

The name fits this cake well, it truly is amazing! It was moist and light. I did bake it in a bunt pan and put the topping in the center. It does help to fold in the dry ingredients. I used plain Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream and baked for 45 minutes. I also added cinnamon to the batter. I will most definitely bake this again. I loved it!! The only problem was a little chunk of the cake fell off when I removed it from the pan but I just cut that piece away (and ate it) and it looked so pretty. Of course if you bake it in the pan it says, this won't be a problem.

This cake turned out tasting very good, but despite generously greasing and flouring the bundt pan, only half the cake came out after it cooled, resulting in a mess that could not be served.  (My husband and I ate it ourselves anyway).  I baked it at 350 for one hour and had almost (not quite) doubled the filling.   Next time, I will try the 9x13 pan with the foil.

I seldom bake coffee cakes because we don't do a lot of morning entertaining but I will be serving this one again!  I followed the recipe exactly as written except for baking time.  It was perfectly baked in 50 minutes at 350 F.

I made this coffee cake because I had a bag of pecans to use and the picture looked delicious.  Normally, I stick to a recipe to the 'T', but this time I did cut the white sugar to one cup.  Unfortunately, rather than going with the recipe as written, I read the review of "Ms. gayle" and baked the cake 45 minutes rather than 30-35 (although she said to bake it ONE HOUR!).  What a mistake!   I'm not sure what kind of oven she has, but the 45 minutes was way too much and the cake, although it tasted delicious, was VERY dry!  I will make this cake again, baking it as the recipe says.  I had no problem with sinking topping as some people complained about, and am looking forward to tasting it as a moist and buttery cake.

What I did different..
I only added 1/4 cup of sugar.  I added a package of vanilla pudding.   I used gluten-free flour.   End result...a coffee cake bar type of dessert thing.
No one walked away from it.  Very tasty and rich.  And no or little gluten in it.

Very easy. Very time efficient. And most importantly, very yummy. Just a suggestion, make sure to finely chop the pecans and use more than just one cup. The topping will be more evenly distributed that way.

My step mom and I tried this recipe, and my relatives are all over it. Instead of doing a whole cup of sour cream, we cut it down to half cup and filled the other half with cinnamon applesauce. Fantastic!

Simple recipe which yielded moist, delicious coffee cake. I scaled back the sugar to about 75% of what the recipe recommended and was quite satisfied with the sweetness. I used a 50/50 blend of pecans and walnuts, and the next time I'll use 100% pecans.

This is my go to recipe for coffee cake.  It is moist, rich and definitely a crowd pleaser.  I do not add or change anything- it's delicious as is.  This is a quick and easy cake to put together and bake, and doesn't create a ton of dishes to wash.  If you're not a morning person, you can assemble the cake and topping separately at night, and put them together before baking them in the morning. People ask me for the recipe often, and my family typically devours it within 24 hours.  Try it, you'll like it! ;0)

I always read the negative comments first, and I cannot believe something didn't go wrong with the process somewhere along the line. I followed this recipe to the letter, and I felt like I'd baked something worth selling in a good bakery or coffee shop. I baked this the first of seven days my partner was going to be out of town. That was on Monday. I tried my darnedest to save some, but by the time Thursday morning rolled along it was gone. This means I will make another for his return.

I thought this was just okay. I think it would've been better of there was something in the batter to give it more than just a bland dry cake with a somewhat boring topping. I added a handful of apple chips to the batter, which did help and some vanilla to the topping. Even with those, I will not make this again. Now I have a huge dish of 'Coffee Cake' that I have to try to get rid of somehow.

This is the best cake I have made so far. I made the bundt version and it was delicious. For the topping, I mixed pecans and walnuts (and I did not have enough pecans) and it came out great. I followed the instructions from KIMBICA and doubled the pecan topping. Best cake ever.

This recipe is fantastic as is. I frequently leave out the nuts because of allergies in the family. It is very important to have room temperature butter and to mix in the flour gently by hand. If you get those two things right it comes out so light and fluffy!  It's a great recipe that I have made many, many times. Thank you!

This is great. My family requests it all the time. I use a stand mixer and it works just fine.  I just keep the speed low and I'm careful when I add the dry ingredients to not over mix.

It is a truly amazing cake, everyone whom tasted it liked it. I substituted the sour cream with 1 cup plain yogurt +1 teaspoon of baking soda. And the pecans with walnuts. the only problem is that I felt it was a lil bit too sweet, so I might reduce the sugar quantity next time.

This is my most used recipe from this site! I am making it today in small buntz pans to send to my mom for Mother's Day, she requested it as she absolutely loves it, as does the rest of my family, even the picky eaters! I first made this for my mom without a mixer, I just cut the butter into the dry ingredients, then gently added the wet ingredients and it turned out great! Like others, I double the topping, put some in the middle and reduce the white sugar by 1/2 cup in the cake. I live in the apple capital of the world, so my favorite variation is to add 1 peeled, diced Granny Smith apple, about 1 cup, with the wet ingredients. This tastes better the next day, a huge hit! Many thanks, DWBH!

First time making this & it was amazing!! Most moist coffee cake ever & really has a buttery taste. I did not have nuts, but came out great anyway. Also I did not have enough sour cream so I added 1/2 cup of applesauce. I put most of the topping in the middle and just a little on top, after cooling I dusted with powdered sugar--yummy!

OMGoodness! This was the best coffeecake I have ever made! It was moist & I especially liked the cinnamon topping.(So did my husband! I used plain yogurt & sour cream (1/2 cup each) because I found I didn't have enough sour cream in my frig, and it turned out OH SO GOOD. Will definitely make again.

Perfect! I lost my mom's recipe very similar to this.  Her recipe didn't have sour cream though.  Made the recipe exactly as instructed and it is perfect!  This is better than the recipe I lost.  Everyone that eats it loves it, and my kids can't stop eating it when I make it.

I didn't have sour cream because it was Christmas morning, so I replace the sour cream with 3/4 cup light and fit vanilla yogurt. I've also skipped the vanilla flavoring because the yogurt was already flavored. Everything else I kept the same, and it came out really well.

Yummy! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and baked it on a bundt pan for 50 mins- 1hr, with the 'topping' in the middle. It was great! Next time I may try making extra topping to actually put on the top, but other than that wouldn't change a thing!

Fantastic. The method for the mix for the topping does not mention the flour. Saw it only in the video. It is needed to stop the topping from sinking.

I made this for my husband to take to work to celebrate November birthdays. He called me from work before the day started to tell me how good it was, especially the pecan topping. I made it as directed for the 9x13 pan, but I took the advice of another reviewer to double the topping. I was out of foil, so I greased the pan well. My husband is not afraid to tell me to make something again or to lose the recipe. This one is a keeper! Can't wait to make it again!

Made coffee cake for weekend outing.  The only thing I changed/added was I put in a little bit of the almond extract.  The cake was enjoyed by all and that almont extract gave it that little extra flavor!

made this recipe substituting the butter for apple sauce (lower calorie) and the sour cream for yogurt, added some fruit to the batter and then marbled the topping, worried i may be to sweet but i think it will be ok.

Very good. Did use less sugar, and almond extract (since I was out of vanilla). Too much extract; tastes mostly almond. Will also double the topping next time - and use less extract (preferably vanilla).

Get the coffee ready! You just can't beat this simple, tasty, moist cake!  My family asked for it again as soon as the first batch was gone.  I used buttermilk in place of the sour cream, but it still turned out well.  Thanks for this great recipe. I've been searching for this one!

I must say, all I was looking for was a dessert to use up some sour cream, and I was absolutely floored when I had my first bite of this coffee cake.  The ONLY thing I did differently from the recipe was to halve the topping. It was plenty for us.  Loved the flavor, loved the moist texture, and loved the ease of mixing it up. I will look no further for a delicious, dependable coffee cake. Thanks for sharing, DWBH!

Delicious!  Moist, dense, easy...what more can you ask for?  I doubled the brown sugar/pecan filling which may have been a bit overboard.  Next time I'll increase it by 1/2.  Also, I make it in a bundt pan.  I've used sour cream, and also used greek yogurt.  Either way it's great!

I made this cake this morning to take to a family brunch.  I followed the recipe exactly as written other than substituting light sour cream for regular sour cream and skipping the dusting with powdered sugar.  I lined the pan with foil, as directed, and sprayed the foil lightly with non-stick cooking spray.  I had no problems getting the cake out of the pan.  It was absolutely delicious and was a huge hit!  There was not a piece left when I came home.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I wasn't a huge fan of this coffee cake but no one complained about it. It came out moist but a little heavy-ish. Just a LITTLE though. I also added 2 teaspoons of vanilla to the cake batter due to other reviewers feedback about flavor of the cake. Other change I made was to line the bottom of the pan I used with parchment instead of foil, just personal preference, I find things bake better that way and are easier to cut out. I also used melted coconut oil instead of butter for the pecan topping because I ran out. And I kept the topping sugar amount the same but almost doubled the pecan amount and it was for the best. In our household we love nuts so I would TRIPLE the amount of pecans if I made this again. And I'd probably use 1/4 cup less butter in the batter to see how that went. All in all I probably wouldn't make this again but would try something new first.

I made half if of recipe and it turned out to be very good. Did not have pecans on hand so I used sliced almonds instead. It was still great! For the toppings I put all the ingredients in a sauce pan over low-med heat, when the sugar was about to  melt I turned the heat off and sprinkled it on top if the batter, I made sure to constantly mix it to get it evenly cooked. It's so tender.

I tried this and it needs improvement. One major thing is when mixing the wet ingredients it calls for a TBS of vanilla. So I pour it in as directed and it seems to curdle the sour cream, butter and egg..(anyone else experience that?) - So after mixing the wet and dry portions, the batter is WAY thick and you have to spread it with a spoon. This means that the cake is ALSO really thick and heavy. The flavor is great but I really think it needs less butter and less vanilla..
does anyone have any tweaks where the batter and cake came out moister and fluffier than the normal directions indicate?

Absolutely EXCELLENT I've made it a few times and YUMMY. I'm gluten intolerant so I made a gluten free version added a cup of applesauce for moist as gluten free cakes can sometimes be dry no such issue with this recipe. This is my only coffee cake going forward! Thanks for sharing.

Decided to half the recipe and the topping was not even close to covering  the cake. It would require to double or triple the topping.   Video added flour to topping, which is not mentioned in the written directions.

I love this recipe! I like the bundt version (with a light dusting of powdered sugar on top). I tried making extra topping as some suggested, but it was too much. The recipe amount is perfect I think. This is a rich, buttery cake, and doesn't need to be overpowered with tons of topping. The batter is thick, so you can pour half of it in the pan, make a well for the topping and then cover the topping with the rest of the batter so it doesn't touch the pan and stick.

Excellent, and easy to sub in healthier ingredients. 1st time I made this, I made it pretty much as written, subbing only light sour cream, Splenda Blends for the sugars, and Smart Balance for the butter - to die for. Now, I change the servings to 8 and bake it in an 8x8 square pan, using 1 egg, plain greek yogurt subbed for sour cream, Smart Balance in place of butter, whole wheat flour in place of 1/2 the AP flour, and add 1/8 cup flaxseed meal to the cake and 1/8 cup wheat germ to the topping. Healthier yet and still tastes "seriously good" according to my son. I prepare my pan only with Baker's Joy or Pam w/flour, no problems.

I do not use margerine or butter. Could oil be substituted for the butter in this recipe, and, if so,  in what measure? I have had this cake when visiting my sister, who made it in cupcake form ("portion-control"). It was definitely a hit. Thank you for sharing.

I halved this recipe (baked it in an 8x8).  Further, when I went to get my sour cream out of the fridge, I didn't have any--the only thing close was LIGHT (fat free, no sugar) pina colada yogurt.  So I subbed.  Then because I had an apple that I had dropped on the floor the day before which needed to be used, I sliced that very thinly under the topping.  WOW!  This was SO SO great.

I made this cake on the weekend when I had my in-laws over for brunch. It was good, but not mind-blowing like others described. I made it in a 10-cup bundt pan and the cake only rose to fill 2/3 of the pan so it was a little small for the bundt. I baked it at 325 for 50 minutes which was perfect. I coated my topping with flour so I didn't have any issues with it sinking to the bottom (I layered it in the middle). I also reduced the sugar to 1 cup as I added a salted caramel glaze to the cake and didn't want it to be too sweet. Overall, a good cake and one that I would make again. I definitely agree that it tasted better the day after!

I made this as written except I halved the recipe since it's just me and my son and I doubled the topping because it's the best part!  It turned out fabulous, very moist, even after a couple of days.  Definitely a keeper.

This came out really good - I was impressed!  The cake itself wasn't terribly sweet, so I think the suggestion of making 1.5 x the topping is a good idea.  I only had enough on hand to make the amount of topping called for, but it was still really tasty.  The cake was super moist and the consistency was great.

Yum!  Super good. I even messed the recipe up by accidentally adding an extra 1/2 cup of sugar and it was still good!  Will be making again.

Super yummy... could hardly keep my finger out of the badder!  Didn't have a bundt pan, but wanted something a little more special than a 9X13, so I used a muffin pan.  I cut little squares of foil (nothing fancy) to put at the bottom of each muffin cup, then sprayed with vegetable cooking spray, and they came out great!  Just be careful not to over fill (2/3 full is perfect), and wait till they are cool before turning out.  Yummy!

This cake is amazing.  I cooked it for 50 minutes in a bundt pan.  It fell and stuck to the pan, BUT, because of the brown sugar, I was able to scrape out the stuck on stuff and restick it to the cake beautifully.  I simply cut the cake and put on a serving platter and nobody suspected the cake fell while cooking. When I first cut in to it, it appeard as thought it wasn't done, but after sitting for about 30 minutes, the textured changed and was so delicious.  I will definitely make this again!  I do believe it fell because of the pecan/sugar mix I put in the center, but nobody suspected a thing and it got rave reviews.

This was a wonderful addition to our Easter Brunch. It was so simple, and everyone asked for the recipe. I used one stick of margarine in place of the two sticks of butter and put an extra scoop of sour cream in. It was still so moist, I couldn't believe how good it was without the extra calories!

Made this for Mother's Day brunch and everyone loved it. My grandmother, who is a wonderful cook, even asked for the recipe.  The only negative is that the cake was soggy after two days. I think next time I might reduce the sour cream 1/4 cup.

Loved it!  It was very light and moist.  I followed the recipe exactly, baked for 35 min in a 9x 13.  I did cover the top with foil for the last 5 min to keep the topping from getting too brown.

I made this cake on Christmas eve to serve for breakfast the next morning. I read all the reviews first and took the suggestion of leaving the cake in the pan overnight to produce a more moist cake. This was a huge mistake. The cake stuck and fell apart horribly when I took it out. I served it anyway and got lots of laughs. It tasted fantastic and I will be making it again if only to redeem myself.

This is really good.  Very light but moist.  Only change I made, which I won't do again, was to use 1 1/2x's the topping.  Reading the ingredient amounts it didn't seem like it would be enough, but adding more made it too sweet for us.  Because of this change I would rate it a 4, but since I know next time I make it with the exact amount it will be a 5, so that is my true rating.

I was looking for a simple cake with crumb topping to make for a breakfast. And this was perfect.  Made it exactly as told and it was very yummy. I also think you could use the base and add different toppings to it.

I have to only give it a 4 because half way through the recipe I realized I was out of eggs - so I decided to continue on without them and added 150ml of milk instead. After the recommended 35 minutes of baking the center was still gooey so I had to bake it for 45 instead, it didn't rise at all, it was more like a small little coffee cake bar and was very dense in the middle. Not fluffy or anything like it should've been. It still tasted good, just without the right texture or density. I will try this again but with eggs next time.

Easy to make and delicious!!  I didn't use foil, but heavily oil and floured my glass 9 x 13 pan.  I also doubled the topping and baked for 40 minutes.  This recipe is one to share!!

I really liked this coffee cake, my only problem with it was that i had to raise the baking time to 1 hour, i used a 9x13 inch pan and at 30 minutes, it was still very raw at the center.

Very, very good!! The only thing I changed was instead of adding just the pecan topping to the bottom; I put 2 layers of the cake batter. Tastes delicious.

This was a decent coffee cake.  It wasn't exactly what I was looking for but had good flavor and texture.  I followed the recipe and the middle of the cake fell, as others commented.  I ran out of flour and baking powder, etc. so all of the ingredients used in this recipe were new from the store so, not sure what happened.  As other reviewers mentioned, I agree that I would prefer to make some additional topping to incorporate in the middle of the cake.  Okay recipe overall.

This is very moist and everyone loved it.  I used walnuts instead of pecans and it was still yummy.  I also substituted half cup of wheat flour for half cup of the white flour and it gave it a nice bit of wholesomeness.

this recipe turned out very soft and delicious! I didn't have any nuts so I made it without for this time. I got several compliments on the moistness and flavor.

This coffee cake is one of my "go to" recipes for my B&B and for breakfast pot lucks at work - everyone ALWAYS loves it.  It's simple to make, doesn't take that long to bake, and has a rich flavor that is simply not present in many coffee cake recipes.  It also stays moist for a few days if kept well covered.  You can freeze it, but it's much better fresh.

I thought this cake was delicious.  The next time I make it, I will make it in my bundt pan rather than a 13 X 9 inch pan.  I would not recommend doubling the topping, as I think that would be way too sweet.

One of my new favorites and new goto's! Followed the recipe exactly, except I lined the pan with ungreased patchment instead of foil.

This coffee cake was AMAZING!  Nice and buttery, not too sweet and just the right amount of topping.  The topping does sink in to the cake a little, but that is what its supposed to do!  Some other reviewers said to double the topping, but I would leave it as is.  Any more would be too sweet, its perfect the way it is.  It was even better the next day, so I'd recommend making this a day ahead of serving.  It was a large dish, so it took us a while to finish it but even after a few days it just seemed to get better.  Great recipe!

I doubled the filling and used a bundt cake pan.  I put half of the filling in the middle and the other half on the top (which ends up being the bottom once you flip the cake out of the pan).  Next time I will put all the filling in the middle.  This was a big hit and I will make it again for sure.

This coffee cake is perfect.  I have made it several times for my Sunday School class and there is never any left!!  I made is for my husband's ESL class and now I'm trying to translate the recipe into spanish since several of the ladies asked for it (in spanish)!!  I make it with no changes and it's perfect every time.

This is one of the best and moist coffee cakes I have ever made.  Also I like to add different kinds of berries to the top of mine before I put on the brown sugar pecan mix.

This cake was delicious! However, I gave it four stars becuase it was sort of dry. Next time I may add a touch more sour cream to help or poke holes in cake and drizzle the glaze inside. Oh yeah, I made a cinnamon glaze (cinnamon, powdered sugar, milk, nutmeg) for the top...awesome with this cake! Besides the bit of dryness, it was great!!!

Amazing!! The cake is so rich and buttery, yet light.  The first time I made it with walnuts, the second time with pecans.  I give this 4 stars because, although I usually put nuts in or on everything, I did not care for them in this recipe.  Last time I doubled the topping and that was a nice touch.  Definitely will make this again.

This is a rich and moist coffee cake.  The first time I made it  I thought it was average but when I tried this recipe again  I increased the topping by 1.5 times which I thought gave it more flavor and interest.

Preparation time & cooking time were very underestimated. Took almost an hour of preparation (sour cream would not blend in with butter) and took twice as long to cook as stated. Finished cake was nice but not worth all the effort, would not make again or recommend.

I made the bundt cake version of this recipe.  About an hour and 10 minutes to bake.  I also folded in blueberries into the batter.  Very moist and delicious.

Delicious, rich, moist.  Baked it one hour in a bundt pan.  Put all the topping in the middle after adding 1/2 batter.  This didn't work as the cake separated in two parts when I took it out of the pan.  Make sure to line with foil and let it sit 10 minutes after taking it out of the oven.

I doubled the brown sugar and pecans, but it was too much. I should have stuck with the recipe as stated!! It gave a messy presentation, but the taste was outstanding!! I won't deviate next time!!

This coffee cake is awesome! It was so easy to make and tastes great too. I doubled the pecan topping, though. It wasn't enough to cover the whole thing. At least that's my case.

This cake was okay, but not the greatest. Granted it was moist but the flavor was just not there. As for the topping I would not venture so far as to call it a crumble topping. It is more like the topping on pecan sticky buns. One word of advice if you plan on making this recipe and use a bunt or tube pan of any kind you will need to bake it for longer than the recipe states. All in all not a bad recipe but I won't be making it again...at least not without some adjustments.

Have made this cake a dozen times and all have loved it---even slices from the freezer were moist!  Top a slice with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of caramel sauce.

Amazing, truly!  Very tasty--just like the store bought mix i am used to.  Glad to have found a homemade version with the same taste!  We used a cultured sour cream (lended a nice tartness to cut all the sugar), added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the batter (like a previous reviewer suggested), doubled the topping recipe and doubled the cinnamon within that.  Oh my delicableness! :o)  And skip the aluminum foil if you don't mind scrubing the pan. :o)

Made this as a bundt cake and it was very moist and delicious.  I greased and floured the pan very well as suggested by earlier reviews but it still stuck only b/c I put the streusel on the bottom before the batter.  Next time I will not do that and just put it in the middle of the cake.  I brought this to work and everyone said it was super moist and the best coffeecake they ever had.

Oh, holy yummy. Forgot to pick up the sour cream so I improvised and added a 1/4 cup of milk and an extra egg for moisture-and eliminated the pecans (I love them- BF has allergies grrr) and, OH YUM. I will totally be making this again and won't forget the secret of sour cream next time!

This is amazing and very easy to make.  I first had it at my son's house and just tried it for myself.  My family loves it!

I am not really sure what all the fuss was about with this recipe.  I think it was just another coffee cake... nothing special at all.  The topping was okay and the cake itself was just okay.  I have had better.

Definitely the best coffee cake ever!  The whole family loves it, and I'm always asked to bring it to family functions.  I like lots of topping so I double it.

I just tried this recipe and it absolutely delicious! (And I'm picky, so if I say it's good, it's good!) I divided the recipe in half because I was making it for myself and I used 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup half and half instead of the 1/2 cup of sour cream. Very, very, very good. Adding blueberries might make it even better :)

Update:
I just made this wonderful recipe again today, only I changed a few things. I halved the recipe (which still makes a good sized cake!), added 1 cup diced frozen strawberries and 1/2 cup of chopped pecans. (I got rid of the brown sugar topping.) It came out sooo yummy! I will definitely use this recipe again and again!

Followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved this cake.  I have no idea why it was baked on aluminum foil, though, because flipping the cake caused the topping to be on the bottom.

It was probably the best coffee cake I have ever eaten.  It was definitely moister than most, and it was really easy to make.  I baked it in a bundt pan and doubled the topping. It came out looking very pretty with a little topping on top and some in the middle.

Amazing!!!  Since I like things extra sweet I tripled the topping and the cake turned out delicious.  This may be a little too sweet for some but be sure to at least double the topping.  The cake was very moist and simple to make.

I made this for a baptism brunch and was a total success!!  A full pan was gone in minutes.  Followed recipe exactly, except for doubling the topping!!  Worked well with a baking time of 37 minutes.

Easy and delicious.I also did it in a bunt pan but i added half the nut filling in the middle and half on top  so when flipped over it had a cruchy topping. Next time i will try it in a tube pan.
Big hit!

The best coffee cake I've ever had, and that's saying a lot! This coffee cake is literately melt in your mouth, it's flavors are just to die for! I could eat this every day it's so good! The only negative to this recipe is the high fat and calorie content, but if you plan on indulging, this is definetly the thing to treat yourself to! EXCELLENT!

Outstanding coffee cake.  Took it too a church brunch, and was asked for the recipe.  I added probably a third to a half cup more sour cream in the batter, as I hate a dry cake.  Also, I probably doubled the brown sugar/pecan mixture.  Baked it in a Bundt for 50 minutes at 325, and it was perfect!

This was really good.  I made it for my hubby for Father's Day...and he loved it! I didn't have any sour cream, so I used low fat plain yogurt instead and it still turned out perfect. My kids loved it too, and the whole pan was gone before I knew it!  This is a really easy recipe, and I will be making this again soon.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this to send to the office with my husband.  He came back with rave reviews.  They even requested the recipe to publish in the office newsletter.  I used approximately half of the topping in the MIDDLE of the cake, and the rest on top.  this distributed the flavor through the cake more.

be careful if you're using a bunt pan.  My filling stuck to the top and broke when I tried to get it out even though I greased the pan well before.

YUMMY!!!!! I loved it and I am thinking about making it again- just made it a few days ago. I used part sour cream, part buttermilk because I didn't have enough sour cream. I also used alittle less than 2 sticks of unsalted butter because that's all I had. and I mixed alittle wheat germ and flax seed meal to flour to make me feel like it was a tiny bit healthy! it was soooo good!!!

this is one of the best recipes for coffee cake that i have found, you can also make it sugar free by substituting splenda for the sugars and it's just as good.

Just like other reviewers have said: melt in your mouth good!  This was my first try at finding a classic coffee cake recipe and I am stopping here.  I doubled the topping and it was terrific.

This coffee cake was nice and moist.  I made them as Christmas gifts in small loaf tins.  I didn't have any pecans or nuts on hand so I just added a little extra flower and didn't melt the butter so it would be a streusel topping.  When I blended the sour cream with the butter the batter looked like it was made up of very tiny bits of butter.  Was the sour cream supposed to be brought to room temperature before incorporation?  My cake wasn't "light and fluffy" as some other reviewers said their's were.  In any case the cake was still moist and delicious.

What a fantastic cake!  Unlike some other reviewers, my topping did not sink into the top (even though I almost doubled the topping portion).  I really think that the trick is to whip the butter really well and easy does it with folding in the flour.

this recipe was pretty good the topping was great i liked the cake but my mom wasnt sure she liked it she thought it tasted funny.this was very simple to follow and make the cooking time took a lil longer than 30-35 mins though but that may gave been because i was using a round cake pan but all in all it was a very sweet desert i may make this again.

I did as another person suggested and used a bundt pan. I used half the batter and then the filling and then the other half of the batter. ( I greased and floured the pan first )I wanted a smaller cake because I do not have alot of room for it. It does take alot longer, I checked it every 5 minutes or so to see if it was done. When it was finally done, I found it was alittle hard to get out of the pan, even with a rubber spatula loosening things up and it lacked the attractiveness I would want for guests. If you mix some icing sugar and milk together for a glaze and spoon it overtop it looks much better. But, be careful, the cake will stick to the first plate you set it on...so, I was very careful how I spooned the glaze over top.My husband and my daughter both think this recipe is better than boughten cinnamon danishes. I would definitely recommend it. It may be a bit tricky, but it's worth it!

I made this recipe and everyone just loved it.  It takes a bit to make it - my only complaint is how much butter it has - I hate to know how many calories it has!   Everyone had two pieces!

Very good, light and fluffy.  I tried the bundt pan method with filling in the middle and sprinkled with powedered sugar and it came out good (I think I baked just a tad too long though)

Great recipe. One hint: if the center is still jiggly, even if the toothpick comes out clean, bake it a bit longer. I love the sweet nut crunch on top.

I halved this recipe and used a round cake pan...SO amazing, though it fell apart a bit.  I loved how the topping fell in a little, I think that was great.

Easy, great recipe! I didn't have a full cup of sour cream (maybe only 2/3 cup), so I used some milk with vinegar. I also used a little less butter and sugar. Even with my modifications, the cake was moist and tasty. UPDATE: I made this recipe again and it fell in the middle. But I think the problem is the amount of Baking Powder. 1/2T is plenty.

I have made this cake several times for breakfasts at work.  It is always gone.  I did try it in a Bundt pan once, but will not do it again.  It does better in the 9 x 13.  I started making 1 1/2 times the topping just because I love it.  It is not necessary, though.

This is a rather dry cake, but then most coffee cakes are dry. Even so, it keeps for quite a while. Heated in the microwave and then topped with fresh whipped cream, it is divine.

This IS OMG good.  I didn't have pecans so I used the sliced almonds I had on hand.  SO GOOD!  I will use pecans next and I think I will try the bundt pan too.  My Sunday School class will love this!

I will not make this again. First the cake never rised, all the topping sank to the bottom and it stuck to the unneccesary foil despite my greasing it. I have not tasted it yet because I don't feel like picking and scraping it off the foil. Guess we'll have to eat it in bowls with spoons. Sorry

This was really good.  My son told me before he ate any that he wasn't going to like it, but he tried it and loved it.  I did it in a bundt pan and with the topping in the middle.  This cake was still moist and delicious on the third day.  Will do this one again!

Really good! 
I 1/2'd the recipe to see if we (my husband and I)liked it before making for friends. Baked it in a round cake pan and it turned out great. Dough was a bit stiff so I added maybe 2T of whipping cream to loosen the dough a bit. I think it also made it less crumbly... GREAT STUFF!Making it for a group of thirty later this week. Thanks!

This recipe was easy to make and tasted great.  I used 1 1/2 times the topping recipe and it was enough.  Doubling the topping would have been too much.  I also omitted the foil and just used cooking spray. Next time I would try using a bundt pan because I think it would look nicer.  I will use this recipe to replace the family favorite that I serve every Christmas and Easter morning!

I work in a housing facility with some picky eaters. I was looking for a recipe that might get a reaction from them and this was it! I made two pans last night, one for home and one for the house. It got rave reviews in both places. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Cake is very good, but it needs to bake longer and I double the toppings.  The taste is wonderful.

I *love* this recipe... I've made it a few times now, and the *only* thing I've ever changed is the pecans to walnuts (when I realized I was out of pecans halfway through the recipe).

I liked this! Although compared to other coffee cakes, this was more cake-y than bread-y..... Depends on what you like!

This was fantastic!  I made it in a bundt pan and doubled the topping, which I added in the middle.  I wish I hadn't doubled the topping even though I didn't use it all.  It made the coffee cake way too rich for my taste.  If I'd used a regular cake pan maybe...  My husband said he loved the actual cake part on its own.

I'm not much for sweets, and made this for a potluck, but this was very good.  Rather than adding 1 tbsp. vanilla, I added 1/2 tbsp. almond extract and 1/2 tbsp. vanilla.  I, like others, doubled the pecan mixture.  The cooking time for my cake was about 55 minutes. I didn't bother with the foil and the cake came out fine.  A co-worker later asked me to make it for her husband's upcoming birthday, so I think that says a lot!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was so good!!  I don't make a lot of cakes from scratch, but this was worth a few extra dirty bowls! Very light and moist cake, but the pecan topping makes it extra special.  I doubled the pecans, butter and cinnamon on top, but only used 1-1/2 times the brown sugar.  This is a great coffee cake to share with friends!

I needed something quick to make before school one early morning and this was a huge surprise!  It is absolutely wonderful: sweet, light, fluffy.  I omitted the nuts, since we have allergies in our house and it was still mouthwatering!  Will definitely make again...and again...and again.

I made this coffee cake this past week for a group of women and they agreed it definitely was a keeper!  I followed the adivce of previous reviewers to double the topping and add a pinch of salt, then drizzled vanilla frosting over the cooled cake.  Very pretty, nice and moist, though I might try not doubling the topping next time as it almost overpowered the cake in some places.  Will definitely make again!

This ia an excellent coffee cake. Only change - I doubled tbe topping ingredients. Other bakers are correct, it's nicely moist. I don't think it lacked flavor at all, Coffee cakes are more subdued and less dressy. They arn't supposed to pop flavor like a regular cake. The topping definitely compliments the cake for a delicious morning coffee break. Everyone at my house wants this again.

The amount of topping wasn't enough to cover the cake in the pan, so I made another 1/2 recipe and put it on.  It was extra sweet, buttery, and great with a hot cup of coffee!

This is a great recipe! We prefered it completely cooled rather than warm. The kids loved it. No changes were necessary.
