Well, I thought I messed up. I baked the pumpkin for an hour, it was tender when I poked it. As I scraped the flesh away from its skin, it was gritty and dry, not mushy or smooth as I thought it would be. I had already mixed the eggs, sugar etc. so I had to give it a try. It poured into the pie crust (two regular sized ones) like water! I was so upset because I was to take it to Thanksgiving dinner the next morning!! It baked up beautifully and not a crumb was left the next day!  I'm making another (one deep dish this time) and this time the pumpkin scraped off smooth like it is out of a can, NEVER fear, it will work out no matter the texture of the pumpkin!  I used the Best Ever Pie Crust recipe from this site.....it's terrific!!!

I have baked 4 of these.  The first time I followed the recipe to the letter.  Great pie, but just a little more spice is needed for my family's personal taste.  The second time I baked it, I increased the pumpkin pie spice to 1 Tablespoon and everyone thought it was better.

I made this recipe with my jack-o-lantern the day after Halloween. It tasted great even with regular pumpkin (note: one good sized jack-o-lantern makes about 4 pies). My husband loved it! One suggestion: for a really smooth, creamy pie blend the filling in the blender on puree for a few seconds AFTER you've mixed the ingredients. It really smoothed it out. This one is a definite keeper.

I would give 4.5 stars but don't have the option. Reason being is that I use my own combination of fresh ground spices instead of store bought pumpkin pie spice. The recipe itself is great otherwise. Note: I only use 3/4 can of the evap milk or my filling seemed a bit loose. I personally think making fresh puree makes a difference so I prepare more pumpkin puree (frozen in 2C containers) for another time. I'm also not into making crust so I use the Ms Smith pre-made pie shells or Pills ready crust, which are pretty darn good for store bought and less fuss. Oh, I forgot...I also blind bake the pie crust and cool b4 filling to avoid soggy crust (375 for 10 minutes) If your pie filling seems loose at the end of baking time, turn the oven off and just leave it until it's more "set".  Good stuff, thanks for the post!

My husband says this is the best pumpkin pie I have ever made.
I also prebaked the pie crust at 425 degrees for about 10 minutes. Than I filled and followed the receipe. It made the crust nice and crisp.

This will be the 5th Thanksgiving that I have made this pie. Let me just say that it is FANTASTIC. Fresh pumpkin really makes this pie. I agree with other reviewers about adding extra spices, but it is great as-is also. I always use the "BAKERS SECRET PIE CRUST" recipe from this site. It comes out perfect everytime. Another variation is to use the struesel topping from the "Brown Family's Favorite Pumpkin Pie" recipe also on this site. The streusel is great with walnuts or my family's favorite- pecans. YUM! You won't be dissapointed!

This is the best pumpkin pie that I have ever had. Even my hard to impress father-in-law loved it. I usually bake several pumpkins at once and freeze the puree in 2c (enough for one pie) batches. The recipe is almost too much for one pie, I keep those tiny pre-made pie shells on hand to make "extra" pies if the pan is too full.  Fresh whipped cream is wonderful on this pie - adding a touch of Myers rum to the cream is even better!!

Funniest thing I've seen in a while.  I served a few different pie options and the ones that chose pumpkin literally stopped the conversation to go on and on, and ON about how this was the BEST pumpkin pie EVER.  A few things:  I cooked the pumpkin longer than it said (maybe mine was bigger?).  The pie going into the oven was SCARY with how runny it was.  I thought for sure it wasn't going to turn out (have no fear-it does set).  The filling was enough for two pies.  I mixed up my own pumpkin pie spice since I already own those spices.  Here is the ratio(have to make about 3 times this for this recipe and measure out what you need): 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/8 teaspoon ground allspice  Excellent recipe.  I will be using only this one.  Amazing what a difference fresh pumpkin makes.....

Fantastic! This was the first fresh pumpkin pie I have ever made and it turned out fabulous. I used one med sugar pumpkin, but after cleaning the pumpkin I sliced it into pieces and put it in a microwavable glass container with lid, and microwaved it for 10 min. The skin peel right off. Followed everything else to a tee! Very good:)

Perfect pie!!!  To stop the sloshing pull the rack forward and add the last cup of filling to the pie after you put it on the oven rack. Push the rack back and bake.  No sloshing!!!

My kids and I have never had more fun baking. This pie not only was easy to make, it was the best darned Pumpkin Pie we have ever had. We rushed out and bought 5 more pumpkins just so we could freeze the cooked pumpkin so we can make this pie year round!!!! Try it!

I used a regular pumpkin, boiled, mashed and strained the pumpkin and put it all in a blender w rest of ingredients.  It turned out EXCELLENT even though i also substituted pre-made graham  cracker crust!  A keeper, my husband can't stop telling his friends i make pie from a real pumpkin!

This really is a good recipe.  I figured a few things out after making this that might help others. 1. Puree the pumpkin in a food processor.  If you don't the pie will have a rough texture.  2. Only add 1 c. of evaporated milk.  The pie will set better and you will not have too much filling.  3. If you use all brown sugar the pie will be very brown in color.  My family prefers it with half brown and half white sugar.  4. Do not overbake!! Check it 10 minutes before it says in the recipe.  Mine was done after 40 mins. total bake time.  If you overbake the pie, it will taste grainy instead of creamy.  Hope these suggestions help!

I think Libby's canned recipe was better.  This was a good recipe, but not as fantastic as the ratings led me to believe it might be.  I was told at Thanksgiving that they wished I'd made my sweet potato pie instead...  The texture was good, but the flavor was lacking.  Not sure why, but one pie cooked way longer than the other, but still turned out ok.

Made this tonight with some minor modifications.  Used pumkin pie spice II recipe from this site with freshly grated nutmeg. Instead of baking the pumpkin - I quartered it and microwaved it w/ 1" on water in a covered caseroll dish for approx. 20 minutes on high. The pumpkin easily lifted out of the skin in bigchunks. I then used my food processor to puree it. After pureeing  - I placed it in a close mesh strainer and let it drain the water out of it for 15 minutes (I got about 1/2 a cup). I cooked the pie filling mix that didn't fit into the pie in a couple of custard cup (they were finshed 12 minutes before the pie was cooked). Yummmmm!!!! I'm definitely going to purchase some more pumpkins to do this again. From what I understand  - the puree freezes well. You can also use butternut squash to make this with identical results.

EXCELLENT pie recipe! Since I got married three years ago, I've been the one in charge of the pies for my husband's family Thanksgiving (a BIG responsibility for that pumpkin-pie-loving family!) This was the BEST pie! It was just creamy enough and perfectly spiced. Everyone loved it and it was all gone very quickly. Maybe it's the brown sugar, maybe it's the evaporated milk, but I followed the recipe and it was really good!The only changes I made: I did make my own pumpkin pie spice, with the Pumpkin Pie Spice I recipe.. For the pumpkin, I followed the Joy of Cooking method- roast the pumpkin and food-process it, but then strain it for at least an hour (I let mine strain over night to get all of the liquid out.) Great recipe. My husband the pumpkin pie fanatic said "Mark that one for next year!!"

I made this recipe with my two boys and we had a great time.  The pie was delicious.  I didn't give it 5 stars at my 6 year old's request because he thought it "took too long."  If you are baking with kids, make sure they understand that they will have to wait until the next morning to enjoy the product of their labor.  We also had to make a few modifications to get the pie to work well.  First, the recipe makes more than can possibly fit in the usual store bought pie crust.  I just baked the over flow pie filling in a small casserole dish without a crust along with the main pie.  The other main modification was baking time.  After 40 minutes the pie is too runny.  You need to add at least another 10 minutes.  Finally, covering the crust with foil in the beginning produced a deformed pie because the foil stuck to the crust and broke it when I removed it.  Instead, bake the pie without covering the crust and then when it browns (20 min into baking) cover it with foil.  This way the foil won't stick to the raw dough.  In the end, great taste.  Thanks!

As another reviewer said, it's a little loose if you put in the entire can of evap milk. I think it will firm up a bit if I short it on the milk next time. The flavor was good, I made my own pumpkin pie spice and I was pleased with the balance, though I used a tablespoon instead of 2.5 tsp as my family likes heavily spiced pies. I should have pre-baked the crust, it was underdone. I used a glass deep-dish on top of an aluminum 1/2 sheet pan for a total of 52 minutes. The crust was a refrigerated rolled-up pillsbury crust. The pie itself ended up rather pale, perhaps I should have left it in a few more minutes, but I was afraid to leave it in too long. I took it out as soon as it stopped jiggling. I will definitely keep this recipe, but I will prebake the shell for a few minutes and short the milk next time to make a slightly firmer custard.

This was my first try at a fresh pumpkin pie.  I try to stick to the recipe as written the first time I make it, so this is a fair review of the recipe as it was written. It is a keeper, best pumpkin pie I have had. this will be the recipe I use for my family.

Great recipe! If using a mixer be sure to use a low setting and not mix too much - otherwise the pie will bake with bubbles. It will taste the same but it just won't look as nice. Overall, I love this recipe and will definitely use it again. Thanks..

This pie is delicious because it's pumpkin pie, and we love pumpkin pie! I agree with reviewer MaryMeanWhile, the fresh is a lot more work for a ever so slight difference in taste, and like her, I found the canned to be thicker and richer tasting.  My sister did a taste test, one pie fresh pumpkin, and one pie canned pumpkin. There was almost no difference in taste. Half the people said they preferred the canned and half preferred fresh. So if you feel like making extra work for yourself use fresh, but I will stick with canned.

WAAAYYY better than the canned version! An absolute keeper. The only thing I changed was mixing my sugar pumpkin puree with that of a butternut squash. (Half and half) It gave me enough to make three 9inch pies and added a nice sweet buttery flavor. Made it for Thanksgiving and out of three cheesecakes, an apple pie and a Store Bought pumpkin pie this pie was the only one with hardly anything left (Which upset my father since he wanted the left overs) My mother even requested I make it for her birthday instead of a cake. I will defiantly be tossing the canned pumpkin recipe in the garbage.

I am not big on pumpkin pie, but I can't seem to find fault with this one.  I actually keep coming back for more!
As an IMPORTANT NOTE this recipe is designed to make two shallow pies at this cooking time.  If you opt for one DEEP dish pie (not frozen crust deep dish) the cooking time is nearly doubled.  This is important to know if you're trying to squeeze this in before leaving, or need your oven for something else.

good basic recipe, try adding 1/4 cup orange juice concentrate and up the spice to taste.  A bit of chopped candied ginger (2 T or to taste) adds some kick as well.

The BEST Pumpkin Pie I've EVER made or EVER eaten.  I made 'Pumpkin Puree' from this site and froze it in 2 cup packages. (This is step 1 of this recipe).  I thawed one of those packages and used it in this recipe.  The texture is different than pumpkin from a can, but oh soooo good different.  The directions call for a 9" pie crust - I used a deep dish 9" pan and it was perfect.  Mrs. Siggs - all of your recipes on this site are wonderful - thank you for sharing this one.

Hi i am from the uk and have wanted to try some popular american pies for some time and have never had the courage to try new things and even more so that the items that i need to make them are not available over here! so i used a fresh small pumpkin as we dont have canned pumpkin in the uk and i followed the guide on how to cook and puree again we dont have pumpkin spice mix so i used another recipes on this website which consists of nutmeg, cinnamon , ground ginger , cloves and a little bit of all spice and and it tasted wonderful to be honest i have never had this before so i have nothing to go by but the texture was soft and the sweetness was just right for me and it was a big hit with my family and i will be using this recipe again thank you so much for a easy to follow recipe  xxx

I actually made this last year for Thanksgiving and never rated it - but I loved it!!!!!!  There isn't really any more work than the canned pumpkin - maybe a little more time.  But, this pie is really homemade!  I did increase the spice as others suggested.  This didn't taste like a traditional "pumpkin pie" that we are probably used to - but I bet our Grandmothers used to make it this way - LOVED IT!

This was my first attempt at making pie with fresh pumpkin and OMG I may never use canned pumpkin again - I'm not even a big fan of pumpkin pie (made it for my family) and I loved it - light and fluffy and just the right amount of sweetness..my pumpkin was large so I doubled the other ingredients and the batter was enough for three pies so I baked and froze two for Thanksgiving!  Excellent recipe!

1/1/17 - I made this today and even tho I didn't puree the pumpkin it was still delicious - followed the advice of another cook and added alot more pumpkin pie spice - made a huge difference in the flavor - best ever!!

I had never made a pumpkin pir from fresh pumpkin and the directions on how to preare the puree really helped. My family felt this pie was the best pumpkin by they had ever made. It is certainly easier to use the stuff in the can, but isn't everything. Easier isn't always what is better though.

my sugar pumkin was from holloween stock and purchased for 10 cents.  i cut up and baked the cleaned pumkin and mashed it up with a fork and added it to the creamed eggs and brown sugar.  the brown sugar was a splenda product and low in calories.  i was out of pumpkin pie spice and substituted equal amounts of tai chai spice.  i added 1/4 tsps of ginger, allspice and cinnamin into the brown sugar and egg mix.  when the pumpkin was mixed in well it was turned out into a frozen shell and cooked as spoken in the recipe and stored overnight for the flavors to meld.
it is the best pie with pumpkin in it that i have ever had.  i bet you could substitute and kind of squash or sweet potato of the sqishable persuasion.  yum.

This was so much easier than I thought it would be. I did have to roast the pumpkin twice as long as the recipe said. I was worried because it looked kind of stringy and very watery, but it came out perfectly. I will never buy canned pumpkin again.

Excellent pie recipe! My only recommendation is to WATCH CAREFULLY during the 10 minute initial cooking at 450 degrees. Our first pie got a bit burned. After that, we did the initial cooking for 8 minutes at 425 degrees, then lowered the temperature to 350 degrees for 40 minutes exactly, and the pies turned out perfectly. We also did not put tin foil around the edges, and the crust was fine and did not burn. One recommendation if you're using disposable, tin pie plates: Fill the pie shell only half way with pie filling. Place in oven. Once on rack, use a measuring cup to add pie filling to desired amount - This way, you won't have spillage in your oven!

I liked it! I made a homemade pie crust and used the automatic calculator to figure out the additional amounts of ingredients I would need for my larger-than-normal deep dish pie plate. I used calculations for 12 servings and it filled my pie plate perfectly! Based on the reviews, I was afraid the pie might lack a little flavor so I used dark brown sugar and a little more pumpkin pie spice. I actually have never purchased pumpkin pie spice before this, and do prefer to use separate spices. I didn't know how to substitute the correct amounts so I went with the pumpkin pie spice. This is the only change I would make as I feel the individual spices give pumpkin pie a more defined and intricate taste. The pie had a nice creamy texture and held together well. I felt this pie, which I prepared the night before Thanksgiving, actually tasted best the day AFTER Thanksgiving. Next time, I will make it two days ahead of when I am going to serve it. Everyone enjoyed it and I had fun making it. Using fresh pumpkin just felt healthier and more "homemade" and I was proud of my pie!

My family loved this pie, but the amount of brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice seemed a bit overwhelming to me.  Will make again and try to adjust ingredients more to my tastes.

I make several of these pies every year.  I just love them.  I do increase the pumpkin spice to 1 T. however.  Also, because this pie is made from scratch, I suggest refrigerating it once it cools.  It does not keep very long left out at room temp.  This is because this pie is natural, free of all that preservative junk that store bought pies contain.  There is absolutely no pie like that made from fresh ingredients!
Update: The last time i made this pie, I baked at 425 degrees for 10 min then reduced down to 375 degrees for 40 min and I didn't have to put foil around the edges like I usually have to do.

My husband has made this recipe twice in the last week.  Absolutely AWESOME!  The filling literally melts in your mouth.  There is NO comparison with canned pumpkin pie filling - this is the freshest, most wonderful flavor ever.  I highly recommend it!  WELL worth the extra effort to use a fresh pumpkin!

I found this recipe to be pretty darn good, and definitely better than Libby's. However, I tweaked it a little to make it better, in my opinion because I like my pies a little spicy. I added a total of 3 tablespoons of flour instead of just 1 so it had a better texture. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, which isn't in pumpkin pie spice.

Thank you for posting this recipe.  I didn't have a sugar pumpkin (not sure what one is) so I used our Jack O Lantern instead.  They turned out and tasted great!  I got so many compliments.  Plus it was nice saying "nope this is not from a can".  Thanks again.

Delicious pie, very nice light texture.  Did as suggested by another reviewer and whizzed all the ingredients in my food processor.  I had to guess the amount of pumpkin as we don't have sugar pumpkins here in Australia, so used half a butternut pumpkin which I just microwaved in the skin and scooped out when soft.  We also don't have tinned pumpkin, so really appreciated a recipe using fresh.  It all worked out well, and we had the pie with dollop cream.  Thanks very much!

Best pumpkin pie ever, I sub 6oz dulce de leche + 1/2 c whipping cream for evaporated milk and add an extra teaspoon of pie spice, it's so good you don't need whipped cream.

This recipe is outstanding! Best pumpkin pie I've ever made. I made an all-butter crust from scratch, and followed the rest of the directions perfectly. However, I waited too long to take the foil off the crust, so the pie ended up baking for 1 hr and 10 minutes. It still turned out fine, but I would be sure to take the foil off at 40 minutes as the directions indicate. I also agree with other reviewers -- mix all the ingredients then puree with an immersion blender for a smooth, custardy pie. No way store-bought or canned pumpkin can compete with this. Next time I may try using soy milk instead of evaporated milk just to see how it turns out.

This is the best pie I have ever had, and I am not the only person who have said this about it. I mixed all of the ingredients and used a graham cracker crust that you can buy pre made, and it tasted just fine. I couldn't find pumpkin pie spice at my local grocery store, so instead I used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of ginger and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. The flavors came together delightfully and it couldn't have tasted better. If your pumpkin is somewhat stringy, I recommend that you puree it in a blender and not just use a mixer. This way you can prevent any strings from being in the pie.

By the way, this is the first pie I have ever made and it turned out great. Don't be afraid if you aren't experienced!

I made this with small pumpkins that somehow grew from our jack-o-lanterns.  I didn't change a thing.  The pies were perfect consistancy and right on with the spice.  I'll keep this recipe and skip the can!  Well worth it.

great recipe as written.  i accidentally overcooked it 30 minutes and it turned out great anyway.  with the foil, the crust didn't overcook, and it was not too loose at all.

My first time making a pumpkin pie from scratch. My last recipe I will ever try. So worth the effort to use fresh pumpkin. Amazing.

This was my first pumpkin pie and I followed the recipe exactly. I don't like pumpkin pie but my hubby and father in law loved it. To be honest though, I made this because I had pumpkins in my garden. Roasting the pumpkins took a long time and my food processor just didn't get them very smooth. I don't think I'd go out of my way to do fresh pumpkin again. I've made other pies since using canned pumpkin and no one knew the difference. Good recipe though.

Very, very good.  The cup of brown sugar called for is a bit much, probably 3/4 or 2/3 cup is enough.  As part of the pumpkin pie spice, you can use finely chopped crystallized ginger.

This was fine, but I've given it just four stars because I don't see how fresh pumpkin is any better than the canned puree - which is excellent. I made both a fresh pie from this recipe and a Libby's 'canned' pie and they tasted identical, or if anything the Libby's pie was thicker and richer-tasting. So as fresh pie recipes go, this one will do you right, but it's a heckuva lot more trouble with not much difference in payback.

This was the best pumpkin pie ever!  I didn't use a sugar pumpkin, just a regular pumpkin pureed in the blender, and it came out great.  I had no pumpkin pie spice on hand so I use 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon each of ginger, nutmeg, and allspice.  I wasn't able to fit the whole filling into one storebought frozen pie shell, so I ended up making two pies with it.  My little sister, who had never liked or eaten pumpkin pie, ate a whole slice and liked it.  My brother, husband, and I thought that it was the best pumpkin pie ever.

I make great pumpkin pies but this was rockin'. I think the flavour intensity comes from the pumpkins being roasted, and the delicious extra brown bits from the pan after roasting. Trust me, you will LOVE this recipe

First pie I ever made with real pumpkin and it was fabulous!  I couldn't wait for the next day, so I had a slice just a few hours after it came out of the oven.  It was good but not great.  However, the next day, WOW.  You really do need to let the flavors develop overnight in the refrigerator!

Rather than using pumpkin pie spice, I used: 1 teaspoon cinnamon , 1/2 teaspoon ginger, 3/4 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon cloves.  I also used the pie crust IV recipe, and used part whole wheat flour and part all-purpose flour.  Very tasty!

I've made at least 6 pies which turned out great!  I find that I have to cook the pie longer and then leave it in the oven till cool for the pie to set up nicely.

This is, by far, the best pumpkin pie we have ever had. I used a recipe on this site for the pie crust, and then followed the directions as is (except, I added just a tad more of the pie spice). My family raved over this pie and said it was better than any other pumpkin pie they've had. This is definitely a keeper! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I wanted to make a pie from scratch and this turned out AMAZING! I was very doubtful when it was extremely watery after blending, but after baking it set real nice. Also I decided to just throw all the items one at a time into the blender and mix it all in there and it made for a really creamy silky texture... it was a huge hit!

This was a really easy recipe. I had success on my first try, and I've never made any pumpkin pie, let alone a fresh one. It was quite tedious having to puree the fresh pumpkin and being careful not to add too much water. I've never even tasted pumpkin pie before but My husband and I finished this one over a week! It needed more spice. More cinnamon and other spices. I'm making another one for thanksgiving and will add more then. Also, before baking it was super soupy, and I wondered if I did it wrong, But it baked perfect!

Made this twice in a week.  First time didn't have evap. milk so used half and half.  Very runny, took much longer to cook but still good.  Second one used evap. milk - so good!  Already had 3 requests to make it for Thanskgiving!

This was great! It was my first attempt at making a pumpkin pie ever (they have always kind of scared me...) and it was pretty easy. I altered it a little bit by adding a splash of home made vanilla extract and increasing the pumpkin pie spice to 1.5 Tbs. I also pureed the  out of it in the food processor to make it extra smooth. 

For the crust I used a Williams Sonoma recipe and it was glorious (butter is better!). And, if you're going to go the extra step to use fresh pumpkin, you may as well make your own fresh whipped cream too. I added a splash of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon to mine and it was the perfect topper. My teen age son ate half the pie in one sitting!

I've been making pies from fresh pumpkin for years. I made one for my Dad one time and he announced he would never eat canned again. Jack O'Lantern pumpkin has a little different texture than regular pie pumpkins but it's fun to get something else out of your Halloween decorations and it's still good. After I cook mine, I process it and divide in into 2 cups and freeze it. I always have some ready to go. That way it's just as easy as canned.

I used this recipe to prepare 6pies ahead of tome for the holidays - the online multiplier was so wrong ... I wound up with enough filling for 12 pies instead of six.  Could use more spice so I added extra cinnamon. I found 2 1/2 cups filled a pie crust, it puffs while cooking but flattens while cooling.

I made this last night and served it up tonight (Halloween) to my friends and family.  It was my first time ever making a pumpkin pie with an actual pumpkin vs. using the can...and it came out DELICIOUS!! Everyone loved it, including my husband who is not a pumpkin pie fan!! Everyone who had a piece requested the recipe, and I was happy to share it! Thanks for posting this delicious recipe!
**Only thing I did differently was use the Pillsbury Roll Out dough**

This makes enough for two pies. I didn't want to make two pies; I wanted to make one. I only had one pie crust on hand, so off to the store for another one for my unintentional second pie. Somebody needs to change the recipe to reflect this fact. The pies were very good, however.

Wow!  This turned out great!  I was nervous when I mixed up the filling, because it was very watery.  The pie baked perfectly!  It was so fresh tasting...and the consistency was perfect!  I followed the directions just as they were written.  The second time I made this I added 3 and a half tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of 2 and a half.  Perfection!  It had the perfect amount of spice!  I made Ruth's Grandma's pie crust.  This pie crust is fabulous...and so easy! I will be making this again for Thanksgiving!

I've made this wonderful pie several times from my very own pumpkins, and my own home made pie crust, and real whipped cream.  Those who say they "can't tell the difference" between real and canned pumpkin - DON'T BELIEVE THEM.  This pie is the REAL thing, worth every minute of the time it takes to make it.  I'm so glad I ran across the recipe here a few years ago,and made it, on a whim, on a boring day.  Just super delicious.

This pie was delicious!  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice on hand, so I substituted with ground cinnamon, cardamom, nutmet, cloves, allspice, and ginger.  I made 2 pies.  The baking time for one of them took longer than the other, but I cooked until the toothpick came out clean, and it turned out perfectly.

Worked out great with a fresh, unopened sugar pumpkin (one 5 lb pumpkin makes 2 pies).  A bit more pumpkin pie spice could work - depends on your taste.  I would smooth the ingredients with a blender, unless you prefer a stringy/hearty consistency.

Hands down the best pumpkin pie I've ever had. Both my boyfriend and I were shocked that such a wonderful dessert could come from a pumpkin that we picked earlier today. We'll definitely be providing the pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving this year.

Whenever I start mixing this recipe my children shower me with extra kiss's and my husband can't stop grinning.  Mrs. Sigg you are a genious!  Can you re-create this magic with vegetables?  I have given these pies's as gifts and have received rave reviews.  Thanks again for sharing.

Wow! And WOW again!!  Last year I tried making another recipe from this site  (titled "Homemade Fresh Pumpkin Pie") and was less than impressed, I almost gave up trying to make one but this fall I searched AllRecipes.com and found Mrs. Siggs recipe- The search is now over because I have found the BEST recipe ever for fresh homemade pumpkin pie!!  I tried baking the pumpkin to get it soft enough to mash but after 1 1/2 hours it never got soft enough, the next night I tried my old standby, BOILING it and it worked great,I just made sure that I drained it thoroughly in my colander first.  I followed the recipe exactly although I had to modify oven temperatures for my old and wacky oven that either gets too hot or not hot enough, my pie cooked at 440 at first and the 395 the rest of the time - thats just for me.  I didnt have store bought pumpkin pie spice but the AllRecipes.com recipe for pumpkin pie spice (1T cinnamon, 1t nutmeg, 1t allspice and 1t ginger) was perfect. Dont fret if you dont have the storebought spice - use this mix once and you'll never buy it again from a store!   I got rave reviews for this pie  from family with ages 11-88 and cannot wait to make it again - it takes a while to go from uncut pumpkin to preparing to cooking to table but it is so worth the effort - Try it! My mouth waters just thinking about the pie I am going to make tomorrow!!

this was my first pumpkin pie ever- even the first time I tasted one, and it was great! Where I live we don't have evaporated milk so I used light cream. I used Pie Crust IV and Pumpkin Pie Spice II, both from this site

The entire family, from my husband on down to our 2-year-old, *devoured* this pie. Even my autistic five-year-old, who usually avoids anything with a soft texture, asked for a second piece! It was super-easy as well. I'd never made a pie before using fresh pumpkin rather than canned, but this is going to be my regular recipe from now on!

I used melted French Vanilla ice cream instead of the evaporated milk. Lots of work using fresh pumpkin - don't know if it's worth it. I think this recipe would be yummy even with canned pumpkin.

Once I made this pie, I was addicted to making homemade pumpkin pie. I also made it substituting hubbard squash and it was excellent. I love this recipe and now make a pumpkin pie every weekend!!

I hate to be the first to rate this below 5 stars, but it really was just ok for me. In fact, with a familiy of 6, it took almost a week to finish. If something is irresistible, it is usually gone within 2 days. I can't think of what it was lacking, but there was just not enough flavor.

I wanted to try a new pumpkin pie recipe, so I decided to make this one.  I won't be trying any others for a while because my husband RAVED about this pie, how delicious it is.  He seldom comments on food!  The pie IS mild, but if my sweetheart liked it well enough to rave about it, then that is good enough for me! ;)  I like it very much as well, and it was quite easy to make.  (I have made "from scratch" pumpkin pies before.)  Thank you, Mrs. Sigg, for a new "keeper" for my recipe box!

Wow. This pie is awesome. I followed the recipe to the letter, but I had to make my own pumpkin pie spice (used allrecipes "Pumpkin Pie Spice II" and changed servings from 2 to 3). I heeded previous comments and made one deep dish pie - there was exactly enough filling. The cooking instructions work for the deep dish pie, using the maximum cooking time for the 350-degree phase.

I used Pillsbury refrigerated crusts (2 to box). Since these crusts are not big enough for a deep dish pan, I used the second crust to cut strips for the edges and just pinched the strips to the first crust. It worked great.

Also, I'm in love with my new pressure cooker and used it to cook the pumpkin. 15 minutes! The skin was separated when I opened the pot and I just mashed the pumpkin with a fork. I didn't really need to, but I let the pumpkin mash sit in a sieve over the sink while I prepared the crust. There was very little liquid. If you make sure to get all of the seeds and strings out of the pumpkin before you cook it, mashing with a fork works just fine.

It smelled so good and looked so perfectly cooked that I couldn't resist trying a piece while it was still very warm. The texture is perfect. The pie cuts cleanly, even when warm. And it is so good that I want another piece, but I am going to be good and just put it in the fridge soon when it cools a little more. Maybe.

Delicious.  Pumpkin purees better and easier in food processor than it does in a blender. Makes one pie and 12 tarts, or 2 pies.

I have used this recipe for over 10 years and it only gets better. Love love love this. If i want to get a bit crazy i double the spices and add a little extra pumpkin. I make my fresh pumpkin from a regular pumpkin. i rarely use a sugar pumpkin.

I made this the night before Thanksgiving this year and everyone (including me!) really enjoyed it, but I noticed that the extras tasted even better a few days after I made it. Next time I'll make it even further in advance so the flavors have time to settle a bit more.

good but not great.  I doubled the pumpkin pie spice to  2T and added 1T cinnamon, but it still needed more spices.

update - great when you add more spices. Taste batter until you've achieved the spice you want. cloves, allspice, more cinnamon, more pumpkin pie spice.

Puree help: add maybe a 1/2 - 1 cup water in the pan, and bake pumpkin for 90 mins @ 350F.   Pumpkin will be very soft and easy to scoop and blend.  

If pureed result seems runny, then drain through a coffee filter or the like for a couple hours.  This made the first step WAY easier, at least for me.

Delicious.  I added a dash of grnd cloves but besides that I followed the recipe word for word and it was lovely.  i was too impatient to wait until the next day to try a piece and it was good the first day but the recipe is correct that the flavor really comes together after refrigerating over night.  this is my new go to pumpkin pie recipe.  I'm going to try it w/ butternut squash as well.

I had a fantastic time making this pie. Roasting the pumpkin, peeling, scraping, pulping and pureeing... It was nice to get down into the nitty gritty of the pie's origin instead of just using a can of premade pumpkin pie mix. All in all, I don't even care for pumpkin pie, but so many people around me love it that it is in high demand. I could not tell a huge difference between the premade pumpkin and that which I made, but others said they could. I don't think I will be making this again anytime soon because it IS a lot of work, but it is definitely worth making once, or always if you are a purist when it comes to ingredients.

I didn't really like it, maybe it's because I didn't puree the pumpkin well. I would also add more cinnamon and nutmeg. It does tastes fresh though.

This pie is wonderful!  My oldest son (6) challenged me to make a pumpkin pie from a real pumpkin.  I've never liked pumpkin pie, but agreed to make one with his help.  I loved cooking with him and was really quite surprised that I liked it!  The entire family enjoyed the pie!

PERFECT! I don't know what's with the people who think this needs more pumpkin pie spice; I think any more would have been overkill. Very smooth, super easy, worth the effort. I followed the directions exactly and had no troubles! I probably had another 2-3 cups of pumpkin left over that I froze for another pie.

Delicious!  My first time making pumpkin pie with fresh pumpkin, and it was worth the little bit of extra effort.  For those of you wanting to make 2 pies, don't double the recipe.  Only take the recipe times 1-1/2, and you will have enough filling to fill 2 deep dish Pet Ritz pie crusts, with none left over.  Will be making this one again, that's for sure.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this out yesterday, I used 2 regular pumpkins (med size) from our local orchard. It made 6 pies and I still have tons of pumpkin left! It's a fantastic recipe, my husband dosent like pumpkin pie and had 2 pieces. I used the butter flaky pie crust recipe, thats a good recipe and it dosent have shortening.

Absolutely delicious pie!!  I love that it calls for fresh pumpkin.  the only thing I changed was I added more spices to it.

cooked my pumpkin a few days prior. I scooped the pumpkin and put it into a food processor. This worked great for the consistency of the pie. I did increase spices to 1T. as others suggested. Only 1 person thought it was too spicey. There was enough for 2 pies. I also didnt get a full 2 cups from my pumpkin. I gave the recipe 5 stars, but i'd give my pie 4 stars. I think I would like more pumpkin and less cloves (I used individual spices). Although I got 2 pies, the sweetness was perfect. Both pies were done in 50 minutes. They taste less spicey today, but they were still good last night.

Can't go wrong with a pumpkin pie in the fall, especially one as good as this one. I cooked it in the microwave and then tried blending it with a hand-mixer-didn't work, so I put it in the blender. Perfect!

The first time I made this pie, it turned out beautifully and my guests seemed to genuinely enjoy it, but I thought it was bland.  The second time I made it, I increased the spices a bit, and I followed another reviewer's suggestion to add a streusel.  My guests seemed to enjoy it as well, but I still didn't find the pie that interesting.  Finally, I found other recipes that added 1 cup of warmed honey to the puree, and that called for crusts made of gingersnaps.  Again, my guests loved the result and I finally agreed.  The best term I have for this recipe is 'delicate', and I simply prefer a pumpkin pie with more zing.

Super pie!  We really enjoyed the pie. I did follow a previous cook's advice and whirled all the ingredients in the blender. That was a good hint for a smooth pie. I also was worried because the pie filling poured into the crust as thin as water. Another good hint was to put the pie crust on the oven rack and pour the filling in; then sliding it in the oven. That avoids having to carry a full pie filling and sloshing it on the kitchen floor. The pie baked up nice and firm. Don't let the thin looking filling worry you. The taste is amazing. Thank you so much for the recipe!

The pie came out great - no problems at all.  I did not have any pumpkin pie spice, so I just used 1 tspn of cinnamon.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and blended the entire pie after mixed. The pie came out incredibly smooth.  Pre-Bake the crust if you would like it crispy.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Did I do something wrong?  My filling for this pie was VERY runny even before adding the evaporated milk.  I spilled it all over the inside of my oven just trying to get it in the door.  Also I had way too much filling for one 9" pie.  It is in the oven now so I hope it still turns out.  This was my first attempt at pumpkin pie and I don't want it to be my last.

This is a great recipe, turns out fantastic every time. I just have a couple of helpful comments. First, I use the little pumpkins called "pie pumpkins" or "pumpkin pie squash". I have found I need two of these, not one, to get 2 cups of puree. Second, this actually makes a 9 1/2 inch pie. When I make it in a 9 inch pie pan, I have enough filling left over to make one little pumpkin custard.

Turned out good, everybody enjoyed. Was concerned the pie would be runny, so after scraping my pumpkin out of the shell I left it in a strainer for a while. Quite a bit of liquid drained off and my pie was firm and not watery at all!

Warning to my fellow Canadian members.  Carnation Evaporated Milk does not come in a 12 fluid ounce can.  Be sure to measure it or you'll end up with pumpkin soup!  That said, this was a wonderful recipe,all the folks at our Thanksgiving table loved it.

This pie was delicious.  Much more flavor than the canned pumpkin.  I steamed my pumpkin instead of baking it.  The teenage boy said it was the best pie ever.

I used 15oz of fresh roasted pumpkin. . . thought I was going to have to use the recipe for canned and can is 15oz.  Sprinkled pumpkin with cloves while it roasted.  The result was really good!  Yes, pumpkin pie is naturally a little bland and this recipe could use a little more spice.  However, the freshness of the pumpkin did come through and roasting the pumpkin was not that taxing.  Think that next time I will season the pumpkin generously with all of the requested spices plus the cloves and then also use the called for spices in the recipe. This recipe made enough for 1.5 pies so 2 recipes makes exactly 3 pies. . . from bought/frozen crusts.

This is so easy, and so delicious. I made this for a Halloween party last year, and people ate it up. Even people who claimed they didn't like pumpkin pies loved it. I skipped the pumpkin pie spice because I didn't have any but it was great anyway.
I've been invited to the same party again this year because people were requesting "the awesome pumpkin pie from last year."

For those who are wondering (like I did), how much puree you get out of a sugar pumpkin I measured it.  Cut in half my pumpkin measured 5 1/2 inches across and after pureeing it I measured just over 2 cups of pumpkin (the measurement for pumpkin doesn't have to be exact).  Sugar pumpkins are the small darker orange pumpkins you see in the grocery mainly in the fall. This recipe is wonderful and everyone loves it.  I did try adding a bit more pumpkin pie spice as suggested by others the second time and from then on.  It is runny at first but sets up beautifully.  I've tried other recipes on this site and I will never use another recipe again (even after using sugar pumpkins in the recipes calling for canned).  This is amazing and so easy.  This year I'm going to buy more pumpkins, and freeze the puree for year round goodness.  By the way, after baking two pumpkins, one just wouldn't get real soft even after putting it back in the oven, but it pureed beautifully in the blender.

I had never made a pumpkin pie before, so this was new to me. I finally cooked and pureed my home grown pumpkins and immediately had to make a pie. The only thing I changed was not adding the full can of milk, as it just seemed like it would be far too liquid, and I'm glad I did. I made the pie for a family dinner and everyone seemed to enjoy it a lot :) Thanks for the great recipe, I'll be using this one again!

I had pumpkin puree in my freezer left over from another time I roasted and scooped a pumpkin.  I defrosted it and then cooked it on the stove over low heat for about an hour.  That really helped to thicken it up.  Since I only had 1.5 cups of the necessary 2 cups of puree, I microwaved a couple of small sweet potatoes, peeled and mashed them, and added 1/2 cup of that to the pumpkin.  That really put the pie over the top!  I made my pie crust using the Crisco recipe... it never fails.  This recipe is a keeper!

Make this! I bake all the time with much success, but this could be the best pie I've ever had. I didn't have a fresh pumpkin to use, so I used trader joe's canned pumpkin. I was worried that it wouldn't be sweet enough but after tasting my pumpkin mixture I figured it would do. I also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 regular brown. That was all I had, and now that I think of it mixing white and regular brown would seem to equal light brown. lol. I read someone else's review who commented on the mixture being very runny. It is very soupy but it will bake to perfection. I think mine actually took a little over an hour. Just check that it has stopped jiggling and follow the toothpick test. I used the "Best Ever Pie Crust" from this site (prebaked at 375 for 10 mins). It was just perfect! My husband and I couldn't get enough of it.

I have made this recipe twice now. I make my own pumpkin pie spice from another recipe on here, and tweak it a little. Otherwise, this recipe is perfect. I took it to my friend's for Thanksgiving this year, and her relatives kept coming up to me to tell me how amazing the pie was.

I had accidently fell asleep while it was in the oven.  I woke up hours later and there was a nice dark shell over it which tasted toasty, not burnt.  It came out really well and the soft inside was perfect.  Maybe you should try this and toast the top like me...

I made it last night and my family members patiently waited overnight to have some today. They said it was SO worth the wait. I also brought some for a few fellow co-workers and they all said it was amazing! Thank you for this recipe :) I made 2 pies at once -just doubled the recipe and bought 2 pie crusts.

With the abundance of pumpkins this year it is a shame not to take advantage of this delightful vegetable/fruit?  I find it much easier to place pumpkin in a large crock pot, add about 1/2 cup water and cook on high for about 2 hours.  Your crock pot may vary so just check by poking with a fork for doneness.  Lift out whole, cut in half, scoop out seeds, then scoop out pumpkin from skin.

Great flavor, set up well. The filling was perfect for a deep dish pie, it would have made two regular pies.

We used a store bought pie crust and about 2 cups of pumpkin purée from a pumpkin we grew. Doubled the spices and enjoyed it very much. We don't have a pie pan and used a springform pan instead. The filling was so much that it almost rose above the pie crust. In that regard, we were glad to have used such a deep pan.  The only disappointment in the outcome of this recipe is the store bought pie crust... Don't use Safeway brand pie crust!

Great pie! The only thing I would note is that it makes enough for 1.5 pies. I usually double the recipe and make 3 pies.

Really a good pie. I was quite nervous at first, the mix was verrry runny. I would suggest using a deep dish pie plate. I did not, and of course because I hate wasting I filled my shell all the way to the top and proceeded to spill it over the edges as I made my way to the oven :) It came out and I cheated and pulled up the edge around the crust and it looked like it curdled. I panicked and made another one (with canned pumkin) as a back up. Well dinner came around the next day and everything set. The pie was PERFECT.  Very good and everyone loved it. I will definately use this recipe again. I did make my own pumpkin pie spice without cloves. Turned out to be a winner.

Cut the sugar in half, still excellent way to use the pumpkins from our garden!  We used 4 cups to equal 1 pumpkin, seemed about right.

This has been my first experience using fresh pumpkins. Its difficult to know how much pumpkin puree one pumpkin will yield, this has been a bit of a learning curve, This recipe is fabulous and has made it impossible to enjoy a store bought pie or even canned pumpkin.  This is the only pie recipe I will use from now on.  Thanks so much for a great recipe

The filling this recipe made was quite yummy, however I feel the sugar pumpkin was too hard to prepare and did not make a noticeable distance. Using a real pumpkin was not exactly worth the effort. At least now we have an abundance of toasted pumpkin seeds. Also, some people didn't like this recipe because the filling isn't as smooth as the one made with store bought ultrapureed pumpkin. I agree that the filling was grittier because it used home prepared pumpkin, but the taste is still great!

This was excellent and had a creamy texture.  I would use a little less sugar next time and used my own combination of nutmeg, ginger and cinnimon rather than premixed spice.

heavenly! added 1/4 cup brandy to the pumpkin mixture. I used 2 cups of pureed field pumpkin. i loved the flavor of the fresh pumpkin and the brandy made it very smooth. the mix was very runny and i left it in the oven to set up for about an hour then let it cool before serving.

Oh, my!!  I have never used fresh pumpkin before so I decided why not use up those pumpkins from my Halloween decor?  I am so glad I did.  This pie is out of this world!  Very creamy and delicious.  I love the amount of spice and will never use canned pumpkin again!  Thank you for this recipe.

Thank you for a pumpkin pie recipe that uses fresh pumpkin.  I am a Canadian who has moved to Australia and we do not have canned pumpkin or pumpkin pie spice here.  I looked for a substitution for the spice on this website.  I used Martha Stewart's pastry recipe for the crust.  I took it to a shared lunch and my Australian coworkers were very eager to try it.  They really liked it - one said it was better than the chocolate cake! They all want Mrs. Stigg's recipe.  It seems doubtful that a cake with all that milk will work, but it sets up beautifully.Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good!  I made the recipe as is.  I used a pre-made frozen pie crust from Pilsbury.  It took my oven a little longer to cook the pumpkin, more like 50 minutes.  I don't have a great blender, so after I cooked the pumpkin and peeled it, I mashed the flesh, made the filling, and then poured the whole mixture in the blender to get out all of the pumpkin lumps.  It worked really well and everything is smooth and creamy now.  The filling was really thin - like water, but it set really nicely.  I baked it closer to 50 minutes which seemed to work fine.  The recipe yielded two 9" pies for me, bit the pie shells were pretty small.  So, for bigger pie dishes I think this recipe would make 1 pie.  In all, it was VERY good!

LOVED this! I made it exactly as written, and had filling leftover for some reason. Prob another 1/2 pie worth- I used a ready-made shortbread crust, which was great for this recipe. There is a lot of spice flavoring, it's not bland. And you can distinguish the spices more than the already made frozen, and it was the best pumpkin pie I've had. My 3 and 4 yr old loved it too! I shared with a friend who IMMEDIATELY asked for the recipe even before she finished her first bite. Thank you for sharing!

This is so much better than using canned pumpkin. It'll still taste good with canned if you can't find a sugar pumpkin- but you're missing out if you don't use it!

I prepared a fresh pumpkin pie for the first time on Thanksgiving Day and it was the biggest hit I ever had with a pie. I followed the instructions only changing fresh spices for p.p. spice.  Delish.  However, the day after, the pie was not as good so eat it all at once.

This pie is awesome! I have never made fresh pumpkin pie before, and as another reviewer stated "If its runny, dont worry it Will cook". Also this recepie will fill 2  8inch pie plates nicely. I added 2 heaping cups of pumpkin puree and it turned out fine. Also I let 1 pie sit over night as suggested and it gives the pie extra flavor when the spices have time to sit...Great recepie, a keeper forsure! Thanks!!

Excellent! Really good flavor and texture! I used a "Pik-a-pie" pumpkin, about 3 cups. I used half-n-half since I didn't have evaporated milk, and reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup. Took longer to bake but I think probably because I used more pumpkin than it called for (I think 2 cups is the usual?) anyway, nonetheless well worth the wait - great wtih a cup of coffee.

This was my first time making fresh pumpkin pie.  And now I will never go back to canned.  My blender broke on me so I had to mash and then beat it (and there were still a few chunks). Well, that's what makes this pie so good!  You can taste the fresh chunks.  Very easy to make and my family was very pleased with the results.  Make sure you do put the foil strips around the edging to prevent burning.  My pie not only tasted good but looked good, too!

Great starting place for fresh pumpkin pies.    I prepped the pumpkins by slicing them in thirds and baking for about an hour.  After a quick blitz in the blender (after they cooled, of course), they were ready to add to the recipe.    I used half and half the first time I made this and heavy cream the second time... both were super delicious.    I do not purchase pie spice, so I added cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves to taste.    Thanks for the great base recipe!

5 for flavor, 3 for complete pain in prepping the pumpkin.  I chose to roast the pumpkins and used 2 cups of pulp per pie.  The flavor is great, but I do not think it's worth the hassle.  The biggest deterent is putting it in small batches to puree and we still found still some random "strings".

WOW!  My first attempt at fresh pumpkin pie and I must admit you can tell the difference.  I followed this recipe exactly, except I increased the pumpkin pie spice to about 3 tsp. I purchased my sugar pumpkins around Halloween and baked and  pureed and then froze the puree until this week. I used my big turkey roaster for the baking part and was able to cook 4 pumpkins at the same time.  Just add some water to the bottom of the roaster.   I noticed there were lumps and strings in my mixture, so I just strained it all before pouring in the crust.  Everyone said they could tell the difference and have asked me to only make the pies this way in the future. Very impressed with this recipe.

This was my first attempt at pumpkin pie from scratch and my search for the perfect recipe is complete! It was so simple to make and sooo delicious. Best pumpkin pie I have ever had. I will never use canned pumpkin again. I used a large regular pumpkin and had lots of puree left over so I threw the extra in freezer bags to make this pie anytime! I didn't have evaporated milk so I used half and half, was still so amazing. Cant wait to make it again!

Not being a big fan of canned pumpkin pies I decided to try my hand at making one from scratch.  This was the BEST!  I've never enjoyed pumpkin pie so much.  It is so worth the effort.

My first attempt at making pumpkin pie from scratch.  It was excellent!  Pumpkin is my husband's favorite pie, so I made it as a treat for him.  Bought one "large" sugar pumpkin and one small.  It made 2 pies with 2 cups left over to freeze for Thanksgiving!  I will probably use this recipe as my standard from here on.  I baked the pumpkin longer than the recipe called, and a food processer allowed me to blend 2 cups easily at once.

Excellent recipe.  I saved myself a step and put the eggs in the blender, pulsed them once or twice, and then put in the remaining ingredients and blended them up.  Very easy and the best pumpkin pie I have ever made!

All of the classic pumpkin pie recipes are basically the same.  2 eggs/brown sugar/spices/evap milk and 2C pumpkin.  Roast pumpkin cut in half (cut side down) with seeds removed for 1 hr at 325.  Scoop out pulp and discard skin.  Bake at 350 for 30 min.  The high temp doesn't matter and just causes the crust to burn.  Since you are baking a custard you can't use a toothpick to tell when done or it will be dried out.  Baked custards will be somewhat soft in the center but will firm when cooled and refrigerated.  Amounts shown make 1 deep dish pie.

WOW! I've NEVER had fresh pumpkin pie and I LOVED IT! It's so light and creamy. Not dense like the canned stuff. I love the fact that I can taste pumpkin! I did use my own seasoning because I'm not a pumpkin pie spice fan. I just did 2 tsp. of cinnamon and 2 tsp. of nutmeg. It was delish!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was incredible. I doubled the spices and used pumpkin pie spice. The longer you cook the pumpkin, the easier it is to pruee. I used a blender in very small batches because I don't have a food processor. Note that the mixture will be in a liquid state before cooking. This is normal. I did not drain the pumpkin. It turned out perfect! If you can, make the crust and whip up some whipping cream for the topping. Sweeten slightly with confectioner's sugar. No cool whip on this fresh pumpkin pie for me!

I found out that you want to fill your pie as full as possible, so up to the brim, people!  It does puff up slightly, but will shrink back down after cooling.  I did pre-bake my crusts for about 10 minutes before adding the filling, and I was very pleased with how it turned out!

This pie came out great.  It tastes just like the can minus the tinny can taste.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I used the Butter Flakey Crust recipe and prebaked it at 350 degrees for 15 minutes with parchment paper and dried beans for weight then removed the parchmant paper and beans and baked it for an additional 15 minutes.  When I added the pie filling, I did not remove the foil the entire time since the crust was already baked.  Also, I used 1/2 cup of Splenda brown sugar instead of the 1 cup of regular brown sugar since my Dad is diabetic.  I can't wait to bring this pie home for Thanksgiving!

Instead of a sugar pumpkin, I used 2 acorn squash it worked out very well. Good to try for something new :) This is what my grandmother used to do, my mom said that she always thought pumpkin pie had acorn squash in it.

I was worried that this was very runny when it was mixed, but it baked up just fine. I used a premade graham cracker crust and my own combo of nutmeg and cinnamon. It got 8 thumbs up. Best pie I've ever made. Thank you!

Very easy to follow and make!  I made the mistake of using sweetened condensed milk instead of evaporated milk.  Didn't pay close enough attention and just grabbed the wrong thing from my cupboard.  Won't make that mistake again, but it didn't completely ruin it!  I will make this again only next time using the right milk :)

This was my first time making a pumpkin pie from fresh pumpkins and I think it was a success.  I used about 1 1/2 tsp. pie spice (that is all I had left) and about another tsp. of cinnamon.  We don't like ours pies super strong on the spice, so it was perfect!  I have only tasted some of the filling that was left over that I baked in muffin cups, but it was yummy.  We will see what the crew says after the pie is completely cooled.  At least I know exactly what went into my pie!

I'm sorry to have to disagree with virtually all the other reviewers. I thought this pie was just average. The fresh pumpkin was a disappointment and not worth the extra effort. It wasn't difficult to do, it just turned out kind of bland and blah. The recipe needs more spices, and definitely don't forget to blend the mixture if you want a smooth pie filling. Call me crazy, but next time I'm going to opt for canned pumpkin.

This was a great pie... Do move very slowly when putting it in the oven or it will spill all over (I learned the hard way). I made two last week and my BF is requesting more today. Thanks for the recipe!!

holy moly excellent! what a difference when you make it from scratch and bake a real pumpkin and scoop it.  Agreed, adding additional pie spice adds to the flavor.  Also, I made a opps!  I used sweetened and condensed milk instead of evaporated milk.  However, nobody noticed till we were cleaning up the kitchen after the pie had been demolished.  It wasn't too sweet at all, it was a nice creamy and smooth pie so I will continue to use the sweetened condensed milk here forward, excellent recipe, thanks!

This was a amazing,I actually didnt have pumpkin pie spice so i used about a tsp of ginger and an extra tad of brown sugar. It was perfect. Also i reccomend trying a graham cracker crust. It was the perfect addition to our pumpkin pie

My husband wanted pumpkin pie for Easter. Kinda out of season so I had to substitute for canned pumpkin (which I NEVER would do) Anyway, followed this recipe exactly but only used 5 ounces of evaporated milk as directed on pumpkin mixture and I pre-baked pie shell first which made a huge difference. Otherwise, followed the rest of the recipe and my husband (who is a pumpkin pie authority) said this is by far THE BEST pumpkin pie he's ever tasted. YEAH! Thanks again.

This was incredible!  I've never made a pumpkin pie that didn't come out of a can.  I'm so glad I picked this recipe to try.  I even used fat free evaporated milk and it turned out perfect.

Perfect. Excellent set, excellent flavor. Some of my co-workers mentioned that the pie was not very sweet, and one of my diabetic co-workers mentioned that it did not raise his blood sugar, so a winner in my book. 2 cups pumpkin mush, and leave it in the turned-off-oven for the extra 15 minutes

This is a good recipe with all the instructions you'll need for making your first pumpkin pie with fresh pumpkin. It's very tasty and I didn't find the need to strain my pumpkin or increase the baking times. I used a pie crust from scratch. My only changes to the recipe were the addition of a tsp. of vanilla and increased the spice by 1 tsp. I was surprised to read that other reviewers were adding more sugar or white sugar. I thought the pie was plenty sweet.

This turned out amazing.  I was concerned at the texture of the pumpkin after it baked, as it was still quite stringy.  I had bought a regular pumpkin, not a sugar pumpkin, so I thought that might have been the problem. I was also concerned at how liquid the mix was when I poured it into the pie crusts, but the pie baked up wonderfully and it was amazing.  I will definitely be making this one again.  Delicious!

This was my first time actually using a fresh pumpkin.  Much easier than I ever thought. I will do this again.  The pie was much more flavorful and it had more texture sort of like a sweet potato pie. I cheated and used store bought pie crust and still the family really loved it. I roasted the pumkins and left them to cool overnight, the meat came off beautifully. I pureed the entire recipe mixture in the blender and filled 1 pie shell to the brim and made some pumpkin tarts with the rest since I did not have enough for a whole pie.The tarts went over very well and were a perfect serving with a squirt of cream on top.

This was the best pumpkin pie my friend ever had, and she's had a lot of pumpkin pies! I'm not sure my small pumpkin was a sugar pie, but I roasted it a bit longer for deeper flavor before cooling and pureeing it. Followed recipe exactly. Thank you, I've found a recipe to make for every Thanksgiving.

My husband is a Pumpkin pie fanatic and wanted me to once again make fresh pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving.  I baked a cushaw squash, pureed it in the Cuisinart then let it strain overnight in a tea towel.  The next morning I quadrupled the recipe to make 5 pies (assorted sizes).  Instead of using the premixed spice, I ground my own fresh spices.  I also used half brown and half white sugar.  Overall we were pleased with the texture and consistency of this pie and will continue to use this recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

This was the first time I've ever made pumkin pie.  Growing up my mom always made fresh pumkin pie.  Her and my dad hate canned or store bought pumkin pie due to what they say is "overspicing".  I tend to agree.  This pie turned out absolutely perfect!  I did use another persons advice and I pureed the mix in a blender once I had already combined it all, which I believe is what made my pie not lumpy.  Also putting tin foil on the pie crust is a must!  The recipe made 2 pies for me....

OK, this was the 1st time using fresh pumpkin.  Our kids planted pumpkins, it produced 3, we gave 2 away and the last lonely pumpkin got cooked, by request. My complaint- mashing,blending,microwaving more,squeezing,blending, and WHEN, I ask, is the right consistency?  I was doomed,there would be no pumpkin pie!  I put it in the oven anyway...placed in fridge overnight,and took it out Thanksgiving Day.  Drum roll...we cut,we smelled,at last we tasted....Yum!  :-)  And yes I would do it all again.

A wonderful pie!  There's nothing like homemade pie made from a pumpkin instead of out of a can.  The other reviewers were right; this pie needed more spices, so i added about half as much more, and it tasted great.  If I made it again, I might puree the pumpkin, or cook it a little longer.  It was a little too grainy  for me, but it still tasted great.

OH my gosh!!!  This is fantastic.  My two little kids and I just finished off one in a half pies! My daughter had four pieces!  WE love pumpkin pie in this house, but this homemade stuff is awesome!  And I used jack o lantern pumpkin, so I was leary of how it would come out.  One thing I did different was put a drop of orange paste food coloring in the blender while the pumpkin was pureeing.  And I pureed it for a long time so that it would be nice and smooth!  Thanks, Mrs. Sigg's.  OH, I also made another batch with just one cup of sugar instead of brown sugar, because I ran out, and it came out just fine.  I like the brown sugar, though, it gives it a nice taste.

I was loking for a recipe that used evaporated milk instead of sweetened condensed and this is the one. One recipe made 2 9" pies for me, and they were good.  I had a ton of fresh pumpkin puree in the freezer (you can also boil or steam pumpkin instead of baking but you may have to strain the puree through a cheesecloth if it's too thin). This was the first year I did not use canned pumpkin, and fresh does make a lighter tasting, yummier pie.  I also topped this with a flour, butter, cinnamon, and brown sugar streusel topping from another recipe that is delicious and goes on all my pumpkin pies now.

ok, I didn't give this one a high review but I'm not sure it's the recipes fault.  the pumpkin pie wasn't very smooth, it had a different texture.  Now, the taste was excellent and the pie looked good but I am questioning whether I cooked the pumpkin enough and mashed it good enough.  that was the problem I ran into.  Blew the fuse on the blender trying to mix it and then had to mash.  I think I would cook the pumpkin longer next time and/or use a food processor.

I changed light brown sugar with dark, as well as put it in a graham  cracker crust, I also baked my pumpkin at 375 for 55 minutes. Not a crumb was left and the last piece fought over.

I don't even like pumpkin pie - I made it because my child was obsessed with the idea of turning pumpkins into dessert.  I had to cook the pumpkin a whole hour, but other than that I followed the recipe. We scarfed it down.  Amazing.  The filling was totally liquid when it went in the oven, and the most perfect texture when it came out.  DO IT!

I used 6 pie pumpkins, which yielded 10 store bought deep dish pies, reduced salt to 1/4 tsp and increased pumpkin pie spice to 1 tbsp per recipe, baked at 450 for 10 minutes, 350 for 25 minutes, no cracks.
I let my puree drain overnight in cheesecloth lined sieves which makes the texture similar to canned pumpkin.

Was super easy to make! Followed directions exactly!
and a quote from someone I took ONE of the pies to..
"THIS IS THE BEST PUMPKIN PIE I HAVE EVER HAD"
and some more conversation.
..them.."How long did it take you to make the pie" ...
me.. "(I roasted the pumpkin for about 40-60 mins" then made the pie)"
..them.. "wow so it took a while then.. well, it was definitely worth it!!!"
DEF MAKE AGAIN!!! and again and again...
This is.. my PUMPKIN PIE RECIPE NOW.. finally!!!! after years of trying recipes out!
***Please note that this recipe is for REAL PUMPKINS not CANNED.. please do not negatively review recipes if you did not follow it exactly***

You know you've found a good recipe when your husband says "This is the best pumpkin pie I've ever had."  I baked the sugar pumpkin ahead of time, so two days later when I actually made the pie, it was so easy.  I did as the other reviewers  suggested, and used 3 Tbsp. of pumpkin pie spice.  I also blended all the ingredients in my Vitamixer (low speed for a minute or so).  The results were a smooth, creamy, light consistency.  This will definitely be my go to recipe, and I'm no longer afraid to make a pumpkin pie from scratch.  I always thought it would be too difficult and too involved.  It was pretty easy!!  I used a roll-out crust from Whole Foods.  Maybe soon I'll venture into making my own pie crust!

Turned out really good!  Baking a real pumpkin was fun.  I did double the spices.  It was a hit.

I have been making this same recipe for 30+ yrs with fresh pumpkin. There's nothing better and I always have frozen pumpkin on hand.

The pie recipe itself is nearly identical to the one on the back of the carnation evaporated milk can. great recipe, turned out perfect, but nothing super original. what makes this recipe much more useful to me is the instructions on how to get pumpkin puree out of an actual pumpkin. thanks!

10 stars!! I've never cared for pumpkin pie, but my husband loves it! I decided to "bake" him one myself instead of the old faithful "store bought". This recipe is AMAZING! I even love to eat this pie- I could eat the whole pie!! I tried other pumpkin pies & still don't like them- I can't even finish a small slice. This recipe has my family screaming YUM! I've made a dozen of them for friends & family this holiday season & they've all raved! Thank you for posting your recipe! It's amazing!! Real pumpkin makes the difference!!

It was delicious! For me, the key was using my immersion blender to get a smooth consistency. A food processor might work as well. Next time I might try using half and half so as to avoid using anything that comes in a can. For Thanksgiving, I think nothing should come in a can ...

I want to add, for anyone who didn't like it: the flavor of the final pie depends on the variety of pumpkin you used. Don't use the variety that's called "sugar pumpkin", that type really isn't so great. Try something else like Winter Luxury, (if you can find it. Or, if the ony variety you can find is the ill-named tasteless "sugar pumpkins", try butternut squash.

I purchase pumpkins locally that have a white outer skin.  They have a better flavor than the orange skinned variety.  Great recipe.

I just made this for Thanksgiving and it is so delicious! I made a few mini pies for us to try before we take the big one to our family party tomorrow and they were so amazing! The flavor of the pumpkin filling is perfect, not to sweet, and it isn't hard at all to roast the sugar pumpkin. I threw all of the filling ingredients into the blender so it would be super smooth and less clean up. I also only used 3/4 of a can of evaporated milk because some of the reviews said it was too runny and I used 1 TBS Pumpkin Pie Spice just so it would be more flavorful. I used a refridgerated Pillsbury crust, used an egg white wash and blind baked it so it wouldn't get soggy (350 for 10 min then let it cool) and definitely use the foil! There was enough filling for two pies. Thank you for the recipe Beth!

My husband doubted this recipe because I usually mess up on baked goods on my first try. This pie was so good I'm using the rest of the puree to make another one for Thanksgiving.

There is no doubt this is a delicious pie (though I did have to add a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg). I made several of these for a fall family get-together and they were a big hit, but to be totally honest, I, my family and friends found the taste was comparable to my usual recipe using Libby's 100% canned pumpkin. So,for me, I will stick with making my pies with canned 100% pumpkin and save myself a lot of unnecessary time and effort.

Amazing! This pie turned out beautifully, and the whole family enjoyed it. Slightly to sweet to my taste, I'll reduce the amount of sugar next time. My pie dishes were rather shallow so the mix was enough for two pies. Served warm with freshly whipped cream is the best way to go! Thanks for the recipe, a definite must for the holidays!

I have never gotten so many compliments on a dessert before- this is fabulous! I doubled the recipe and somehow ended up enough filling for three pies. I needed to add milk to the pumpkin puree in the blender to get it a nice creamy consistency to make it easier to pour out and mix (this could be how I ended up with way more filling than I needed). I substituted heated fresh milk for evaporated milk as I was out, but I don't think it made a difference. Roasting time for the fresh pumpkin varied somewhat for me- could be my oven. It took me almost twice as long to roast the pumpkin thoroughly. I also coated my pumpkin flesh in cinnamon sugar butter before roasting.

Delicious and easy! Used sugar pumpkins that we got from our local CSA.  Edged up with too much filling for the 9" pie shell so we made a mini pie with the leftover filling.

I thought it turned out pretty good. It definitely needed more spices, we all thought it was a little bland. The texure was great though and it baked up beautifully. Like others mentioned, I too had extra filling. I put the extra filling in a ramekin and baked it along side the pie. I was able to "sample" the pie (without the crust) before Christmas dinner and no one was the wiser!

Very tasty and not too difficult to make. It takes a little time to bake and scrape the pumpkin, but the results are worth the investment. It is MUCH better than a pie made with canned pumpkin. This pie keeps extremely well. I made it 5 days ahead of Thanksgiving and it was still delicious on the big day. Strongly recommend fresh whipped cream to accompany it. Will definitely make this again.

This recipe received rave reviews from my family.  I would much rather use fresh ingredients because of the plastic, etc., that is used in the canning process.  The "extra" work that creates takes less than 5 minutes of manual labor & it is worth it to me.  Like others I will increase the spice the next time but that is simply a matter of taste.  Wonderfully easy & absolutely delicious!

This was okay but I really prefer my pumpkin pie sweeter than this. I added a praline topping after tasting the filling before baking. Not sure roasting the sugar pumpkins was worth the effort either. I used the second one I bought to make pumpkin bread.

It was quite easy and really delicious.. It was my first time doing a pumpkin pie and it tasted awsome. Thanks for the recipe I have nothing bad to say. My mom liked it but without half the sugar. She doesn't like sweet things too much.

This comes out perfectly every time!  Don't be alarmed by how watery it is...it cooks up just right.

I thought this was a really good pumpkin pie, but I thought it didnt have enough pumpkin flavor. Next time I make it I will try adding more pumpkin. I did follow one review and added 3 tbs of pumpkin pie spice and that pie was much better then the first one. Will make again and try to tweak it the way we like it..

I made this pie last year for Thanksgiving and it was AMAZING!!! If you've never tried fresh pumpkin you should definitely give it a try, its like nothing you've ever tried before, you wont be disappointed! I did add more spices but i always do with about 95% of my recipes, so that's just personal preference....enjoy!!

It was good, not sure it was worth the effort of the pumpkin but it was kind of fun to try. I used a can of sweetened condensed milk instead and just 2 tbsp of brown sugar.

This is a great pie recipe if you want to make a fresh pumpkin pie. My parents and siblings loved it. The only thing I would say is a negative, is that it is a little stringier,but that might just be me.

First time making pumpkin pie from real pumpkin. The texture is so creamy...perfect! I drained the pumpkin for many hours in a colander and made the pumpkin pie spice mix off this site, adding a small amount of cloves. I doubled the recipe, made 2 pies and used the leftover batter to make a pumpkin bisque with a little bit of peanut butter in it to offset the sweetness.

Made this with our Halloween pumpkin.  Was very good.  I didn't puree the pumpkin enough, so after mixing in all ingredients, threw it into the blender - that smoothed everything out quite nicely. Very light. Thanks!

This pie was great....taste like store bought. I did add more spices. After reading some of the reviews, I thought I would add more pumpkin spice with a dash of nutmeg, cinnamon and glove. Turned out delicious.

10 STARS!  I made this last year when pumpkins came in and forgot to review.  Duh...This is so much different then using canned pumpkin.  My pie came out really creamy.....hubby commented on it said "different but good"....I loved the texture.  Yes it's more work to make this but well worth it...I didn't change a THING by the way.  THANKS Mrs. Sigg.

This was the best pumpkin pie I've ever had!  I did not have evaporated milk so I used 1.5 cups heavy cream.  The pie was really soft, even with extra baking time.  This did not keep us from devouring it.  I had extra pumpkin and made another pie with 1 cup of heavy cream and the consistency was perfect!

OMG this is absolutely, hands down the best pumpkin pie i have ever made or eaten. I cant tell you the difference in using real pumpkin. I followed another reviewers advice and cooked my sugar pumpkin in the microwave. It cooks much faster. I used a butter flake crust also. So fattening but so yummy. I will share this recipe with everyone I know. Thank you so much for sharing this fabulous pie!

I was skeptical when it went into the over because it poured into the crust like water.  However it came out wonderful!  The top looks a little funny, but it tastes delicious!  I followed other's advice and added more spice.  I will definitely make this again.

Fabulous! Got rave reviews at Thanksgiving dinner.  The only thing different I did to it was to add the spices separately because we don't have Pumpkin Spice in Norway.  I added: 1tsp powdered ginger, 1/4tsp cloves, 1tsp cinnamon and eyeballed about a half tsp of nutmeg which I ground freshly into the batter.

Great Recipe!  I received rave reviews from the in-laws.  As another had suggested I increased the pumpkin pie spice to 1 tablespoon.  Also I didn't have a sugar pumpkin so I used a jack-o-lantern pumpkin which still turned out great.  Keeper!

I made this pie and sent it with my husband for his friend's birthday. The pie plate came back scraped clean, and he said everyone loved it. I tried a piece from the second pie, and I agreed it was wonderful. You have to have the time, but it's not complicated.

This was phenomenal! I messed up a bit by letting the mixture sit for a little too long in my pie crust and then it sloshed all over the place when i tried to put it in the oven...other than the lack of beauty because of my own mess up, it was delicious!

I chose this recipe to do a practice bake for thanksgiving. I'm not an expert on baking so I just followed the recipe as it is written and it still produced excellent results. The pie was delicious, definitely baking it again for the holiday!

I had made this pie the previous year, and it came out perfect! My stepdad, who is a super hard critic, said it was the best pumpkin pie he has EVER tasted! I made a few changes, and I added things to my liking, but still- this pie is amazing!   I am currently cooking pumpkin in the oven right now to make pumpkin pie! Woo! :) Considering my experience cooking, I have to say- this is a very easy make, straight from a New England sugar pumpkin! :)

Best pumpkin pie I've ever had, lots of flavor. What a wonderful recipe. For added piece of mind from pumpkin strings, I used a ricer to ensure smoothness. This is a must make recipe. Will never use canned pumpkin again.

I have never made a pie because and it came out awesome. It was also very easy to follow. I made it twiceand on the 2nd one I made I switched up evaporated milk for sweetened condensed milk and it was a little bit sweetter for those of you with a sweet tooth.

Excellent recipe.  I only used about 1/2 the can of evaporated milk though.  It seemed really runny at first but baked up nicely!  I made it using a gluten free crust and white rice flour and you never would have guessed it was gluten free!

This was literally the best pumpkin pie I have ever had. I made a small change. Instead of the evaporated milk I used fat-free condensed and only a half cup of sugar.

This was my first ever pumpkin pie, baked and tasted. The recipe was easy to follow, I used fresh pumpkin and a quick flaky short pastry for the case. I was surprised at how 'light' and almost fluffy it was. I was expecting a denser texture and I'm afraid I would have preferred that. Also I needed that extra sweetness and texture so I actually finished of each slice of pie with a brulee topping ie. I sprinkled a fine layer of sugar on top then briefly blasted it with the blow torch, YUM!

Make sure you puree the pumpkin,  I just mashed it and the pie ended up a little chunky.

This is a fantastic recipe for using fresh pumpkin!  Be aware that your pie's color may be paler than a traditional pumpkin pie (mine was a creamy white shade), but the flavor is amazing!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, using some fresh pumpkin I'd prepared and frozen earlier in the fall.  I doubled the recipe and ended up with one deep-dish pumpkin pie and one regular nine-inch pie.  They were fantastic, and everyone loved them!  I was happy to have a pie to keep at home too.  Changes:  I used one tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice per pie, and also added an extra half cup or so of pumpkin just so it wouldn't go to waste.  Very, very yummy pies, with a nice texture and great flavor.  Thanks!

This was a fanatastic recipe!  I have never made pies before and tried this and pecan pie V from the list as well.  We used pumpkin from our garden, which made it even yummier.  My husband loved the creaminess and flavor and I was amazed at how easy it was! I did add a little extra spice like some of the reviewers, and I had about a 2 1/4 cup pumpkin from our pumpkin so I threw it all in there, and it was perfect.  Thanks!

Made pie as written, but doubled the spice.  For anyone who might be thinking it's too much work, it's really, really not!  We don't have canned pumpkin in Northern Ireland, so I prepared this on Thanksgiving because I was feeling homesick. I'm extrememly happy with the result.  Another fantastic recipe from Mrs. Siggs! (try her snickerdoodles!)

Quick, easy and delicious!  Very simple to add one ingredient at a time into the food processor.

Differences were I used an equal amount of heavy whipping cream in lieu of evaporated milk and then made individual mini pies (mini muffin pans).

Will definitely use this recipe whenever I make pumpkin pie.

Tastes great, did exactly as recipe says.  PERFECT!!!  I would suggest, since you are pureeing (sp) one pumpkin, do a couple, a pumpkin will give you about two pies worth.  I freeze mine in 2 cup containers, and thaw when needed, this way my family gets this all year for the next year.  They love it.  I use a braun stick blender, easy pureeing and great turn out everytime.  Thank you

This was the best pie ever.  My friends said a must do forever!  I did strain the pumpkin before mixing it for the pie and it came out absolutely perfect.  Texture, taste, and appearance were perfect.  This is now my all time recipe for pumpkin pie!

This pie was excellent! I made it the 2 days ago and yesterday there was nothing left, making 2 more today. And it was quite simple too, the hardest part is cutting open the pumpkin. My pumpkin was stringy and my batter was so thin but it baked up beautifully. I used my own crust recipe. After mashing my pumpkin I threw it in the food processor and just mixed everything up in there. And I baked my pie just a couple minutes longer than suggested and then turned the oven off and let the pie sit in there until set.

A great recipe!!  I put about a half cup extra pumpkin puree to get a true pumpkin taste.  I like to taste the pumpkin over the spices.  I also baked the pumpkin at 400 degrees for about 50 minutes.  The pumpkin I grew were bigger so the higher temp helped cooked it better.

I used pie pumpkins from my garden to make this... the first time I ever used fresh pumpkin.  It was delicious!  I will stress the importance of blending your mixture until smooth.  If your pie is stringy, it is your own fault!

Wow!  I have never made fresh pumpkin pie before and my pies turned out perfect!  I blened all of the ingredients in the blender and used only 3/4 can of the evap. milk.  I also use my own pie crust recipe and didn't pre-bake pie shell.  The pie is so delightful after it cooled over night.  I will always use this recipe!

This turned out really well.  I took the seeds, toasted them with a bit of salt, and used them to top the pie.  It made for a really interesting combination.  This recipe made about 1.5 pies worth of filling for me.

I was at my in-laws' house and decided to make a pie out of a pumpkin from a local farm.  Pulled up allrecipes on their computer and there was this recipe.  Turned out perfectly!  Used my own combination of cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger since that's what my mother-in-law had in her pantry.  I will be making this pie again and again!

Worth baking year round! I made this in Spring, out of a very stringy pumpkin with no flavor in Morocco...my friend steamed it for snacks but the texture was aweful so I searched on allrecipes to find out what to do with it and it ended up being soup and a pumpkin pie. I cut the sugar in half and use melted vanilla ice cream instead of evaporated milk. I have no pumpkin spice, so I put only what I have 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg which did just fine. 2 cups of pumpkin is a bit too much but I put the left-over in 3 little tin cup to make custard. Someone here suggested baking the crust 10 minutes before pouring in the filling so I did and the crust came out nice and crispy (I use Grandma's Secret Pie Crust). The pie was refrigerated overnight and next day was served with ginger whipped cream from another pumpkin pie recipe(Classic Pumpkin Pie by Land O'Lake). Let's just say I wish I hadn't made the soup and made 2 pies instead.

i received wonderful compliments from this recipe- i am not convinced yet, that fresh is better than canned.  definitely increase the spices next time.  the filling is very runny- which results in a tender, custard-like pie, but also means a very dirty oven!

This is the favorite of my Apartment. I used condensed milk instead of evaporated. I always have to let this one sit in the oven longer, so I will turn off the oven after the full hour and let the pie cool with the oven. Comes out perfect every time!

I made this pumpkin pie this past weekend.  Definitely a keeper recipe.  I made my own fresh pie crust and followed Mrs. Sigg's recipe only adding a little more pumpkin spice.  My Fiance and I enjoyed it.  Thank you!

I used this recipe and it is one of the best pumpkin pie recipes I have ever tried. It is creamy and very light. It does not have a strong taste like the canned pumpkin. I highly rate this recipe. It is fantastic. My husband really enjoyed it.

It looks easy on paper to make pumpkin puree from a fresh pumpkin, but let me tell you, it takes a long time to cook and then puree a large pumpkin, as you have to cook it in batches! Also be prepared for a huge mess to clean up from this process. Once done, though, making a pie is really easy, and you can freeze the remaining puree to use in later pies! They taste amazing!

Wonderful!  Fresh pumpkin always turns out a better pie, and this is a great recipe for it!  Higher than a canned pumpkin pie, so a deep dish pie pan is called for.  I added an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg, just because.

This pie was awesome. The crust was a little doughy, but I will just precook it partially (10 min or so) next time. I got rave reviews from everybody that tried it. Yum yum yum.

Loved this recipe!  I bought evaporated milk instead of condensed, so I was looking for a recipe that used it.  This one will replace my old one, it is very easy!  I used cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg instead of pumpkin pie spice.  I also cooked the pie crust for 10 minutes first.

I love fresh pumpkin pies vs canned pumpkin. The baked pumpkin creamed up great in the blender with the milk.  Two things that could be better. 1) less pumpkin pie spice - maybe 1 ½ tsp. 2) It came out like pudding, yummy creamy pudding. It needs 2-3 T of tapioca flour or something else to stiffen it up. I will make it again with the above adjustments.

I have food allergies, so had to substitute a few items (coconut sugar instead of brown, nut milk instead of canned, and I had to home-make the crust) but it was the BEST PUMPKIN PIE I've had in YEARS!!!  I'll keep this recipe and make it again!

I had made two pies; one using the ingredients/directions of  "major brand" canned pumpkin, the other using fresh pumpkin and this recipe.  My family, hands down, preferred this one.  The only reason I'm giving four, vs. 5 stars, is that they all said they could taste the brown sugar (not that that was a bad thing, they said),   Each agreed that, perhaps next time, use 3/4 c instead of the one cup of brown sugar. Now, also, I can't say for sure what kind of pumpkin  I had used, to make the puree. I don't know much about the subtleties of cooking pumpkins vs sugar pumpkins or  halloween ones.  I will DEFINITELY use this recipe again, and will look into the differences in pumpkins .

Been making this one for years now and it is always wonderful! I just use a little more spice..almost a TBSP of pumpkin pie spice plus a shake of nutmeg and clove :) I always have to bake it a few extra minutes. It is so dang good, and I’ve yet to have someone try it that didn’t rave about it.

I didn't work super hard to get the pumpkin pureed super fine, but it still turned out well!  Next time I would try harder on the pureeing.  One small sugar pumpkin made just enough for one pie.

Excellent and easy recipe with simple ingredients. I misread how much evaporated milk to use and only used 1 cup, but it was the perfect amount. I also added a little extra pumpkin puree (about 1/4 cup extra) because it seemed watery and used about 1 tbsp of pumpkin pie spice. I mixed the dry ingredients together first, then added to the eggs, then added the wet ingredients, mixing after each addition. Consistency and texture was great, but I think next time I'll mix less because I got some bubbles. Could have used slightly more sugar to make it more sweet, but nothing a little extra whipped cream couldn't solve when served.

I have made this many times and people always say it’s the best pumpkin pie they’ve ever had. One small aside though-I just put one of these pies in the oven.  I used a store bought deep dish pie crust and still have about a cup of filling left over.  No worries, I’ll use it for pumpkin bread.  Just know that this makes enough filling for a much larger than standard or even deep dish pie.

Keep in mind it’s always better the next day.

Not a fan of pumpkin but had 1 sugar pumpkin that survived the carving so made this. It was absolutely delicious, very silky smooth. I made home made whipped cream to go with it...Awesome!!! Changed my mind on pumpkin

This is my go to pumpkin pie recipe every year. So easy to make and my family loves it. As a personal preference and for extra flavor, I always double the spices. Fresh pumpkin for the win, so yummy!

This was the perfect pie made exactly as the recipe indicates, but with tablespoon measurements of pumpkin pie spice instead of teaspoons based on person preference. The texture was great and it wasn’t too sweet. Thank you for sharing!

This was a delicious recipe for fresh pumpkin pie. i used Fresh and then  frozen pumpkin from my garden, added more sugar and more spices  and used extra large eggs. It was perfect for an aluminum fluted pie dish and just the right amount. Best fresh pumpkin pie I’ve ever made

Love this recipe!! I make it every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Every Halloween we buy enough pumpkins to make these pies and bread. What I really love is the instructions to make your own pumpkin puree.

I used a jack-o-lantern pumpkin (steamed) and coconut milk instead. This pie is the bomb! So easy, just blend all the ingredients, then pour it into the pie crust and bake!

Just be careful if you decide to steam your pumpkin instead of bake it as done in this recipe! If you steam your pumpkin as I do, get a cheesecloth and STAIN! I did not strain the water enough in my second batch of pumpkin pie, so there were holes all over the top!!!

This got amazing rave reviews!  I used PW's perfect pie crust, and this was my first time making pie crust and pumpkin puree from scratch, and my first time making pumpkin pie of any type.  It made me nervous because it was very, very runny going into the oven, but it set up beautifully.  I did have to cook a fair bit longer than the recipe (10 min at 450 and then 70, I think, at 350), but turned out perfectly.  Everyone was crazy about it!

This was the first pumpkin pie I ever made and I worried when the smell of pumpkin pie didn't fill the house while baking. But in the end it was a tasty pie, with spices and pumpkin working subtly together for a pie not too spicy, not too sweet but just right! (I used the Pumpkin Pie Spice recipe instead of buying pre-made pumpkin pie spice.)

I appreciate the heads up for roasting the pumpkin in real time (I had some roasted and frozen earlier in the season this year). I love the spices, and but I usually don't use all the evaporated milk, I run out of space in my 9 inch pie pan. The natural flavor seems to come through with this recipe.

This is my go-to every fall. The fresh pumpkin really does make a difference. I used to add ginger and nutmeg and cloves but with just the fresh pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice you get a huge pumpkin flavor that's sooooo good.

Should you use deep dish pie shells?  I doubled the recipe for two pies and have about half the filling left!
What can I do with the rest of the filling?
Can only give 4 stars now because they are not through baking.  Smells yummy, though!

I made this with my leftover Halloween pumpkins and a few tweaks to my tastes (kids painted them, I cut them up and removed the meat and roasted it in a cake pan with a light sprinkle of brown sugar)
I used plain cinnamon instead of pumpkin pie spice because I don't like nutmeg or hindering the pumpkin flavor. I made a double batch but used 5 cups of my pumpkin because I like it a tad heavier and more pumpkin flavor. 

Other than  that I stuck to the recipe. And it was amazing. My friends and family love it and gobbled it right up, my 5 year old son asked if I would make it for him for breakfast every day, I declined lol but he's a bit picky sometimes so I take that as high praise!

This was the best pumpkin pie I have ever eaten in my life! My husband was doubting that it would be good at all because of his childhood experiences of homemade pumpkin pie. He took a bite and loved it, he ate basically the whole pie by himself and I had to make a second so my kids could enjoy it as well. I did not alter the recipe at all, and it turned out amazing!!! Definitely a must try!!!

The only thing I changed was adding another half teaspoon of spice. I also sprinkled a tiny bit of allspice on the pumpkins before I put them into the oven for roasting. This turned out absolutely fantastic! Seriously the best pumpkin pie I’ve ever had. The filling made more than enough for one pie but not enough for two, so I used the left over filling and made bite size pies in a muffin tin.

My husband loves this pie!  I didn't have any evaporated milk so I substituted heavy cream and it worked wonderfully.  Also, I don't use pumpkin pie spice so I mixed 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, ginger and allspice.  We don't like anything really sweet so I reduced the sugar to 2/3 c.  I will definitely make this again!

This is a very delicious recipe for pumpkin pie. I've made it on multiple occasions,  This time, I only had a small pie pumpkin and it didn't quite produce enough pumpkin puree, but I used it with all of the other ingredients as is.   The pie came out with an excellent texture and flavor as always.

Absolutely wonderful recipe. I've made this multiple times and each time the pie was super moist and creamy. I do add more spices than the recipes says. One time I made it, I poured the pies and let them sit a few minutes before putting them in the oven. The mix separated and I had a strange white layer of evaporated milk cooked on the bottom, but that was my mistake.

Pretty solid recipe.  I doubt I'm going to look for an alternative recipe, especially since it uses real pumpkins instead of from the can. I only baked this pie because the guy I was seeing was  Team Pumpkin Pie (I'm Team Sweet 'Tato). I actually never tried pumpkin pie before, so my frame of reference was that it must be like sweet potato pie, right??? I didn't use pumpkin pie spice but only because I read the ingredients in the store and realized it was nothing but cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cloves basically. I saved my money and used those ingredients instead, since I already have them. Since it was Pumpkin Spice Coffee Everywhere season, I decided to add 2 teaspoons of hazelnut instant coffee powder to the batter for the coffee shop treamtment. I also mixed the same hazelnut instant coffee into the whip cream topping. The hazelnut instant coffee was an inspired touch and I'm not even a pumpkin spice fan! I'm still Team Sweet 'Tato, but this was a worthy entry from Team Pumpkin!

Made this recipe right after Halloween was over. My partner and I were scared that we over cooked the pumpkin slices, but luckily we were wrong. The pie came out great! We had more than enough pumpkin purée and made about 6 pies in all, and still had more purée left over. We passed the pies out to our friends and family and everyone enjoyed it! Even those who said they did not like pumpkin pie! 10/10 I will definitely be making this again next fall! (:

Really delicious, I use heavy cream instead of evaporated milk and prefer to make the crust from scratch.

This is the greatest pumpkin pie I have ever made and or tasted. This reminded me of my great grandma's that she used to make when I was a kid. I did recipe exactly as read changing nothing except to double it as i freeze my pumpkin in 4 cups per bag and I had enough to fill 3 deep dish pie shells brim full. So, you may want to have extra pie plate on hand. I never use can pumpkin because it always has that store bought stiff taste. It never tastes home made without using fresh pumpkin. However, this recipe in particular topped the others. I think the brown sugar tops it off. Seemed runny when mixing but baked up fluffy and beautiful. My husband and kids moaned at dinner and replied it was the best they'd ever had. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Best pumpkin pie ever!  Wonderful smooth texture.  Wonderful not-too sweet taste.  Used a slightly sweet pie crust.  This will be my go to recipe for pumpkin pie in the future

Everyone loved it! My husband said it was the best pumpkin pie he’d ever had! Based on other reviews, I used a tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice and 3/4 cup of evaporated milk, and it set perfectly. Great recipe!!

Rated it a 5 as it taste's OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!  Very easy, except the initial baking of the pumpkin.  Took me longer than 40-50 minutes as the medium pumpkin took more time.  Little pumpkins work the best and bake faster with better consistency.  Didn't change anything and it was FANTASTIC!!!!!

I made this last year, and it was wonderful.  I've got 2 pies in the oven now.  I didn't use the small pumpkins, because all I had were the big halloween pumpkins.  So the color is a little different.  After pureeing the pumpkin, I put it in a t-towel, and let that set sit for a long time over a strainer in the sink, to get all the excess water out.  But these are fantastic.  I always amp up the spices, for my families tastes.  I never have been successful in making a homemade crust, so I went with the deep dish frozen.   Excellent recipe.

It's a mostly awesome recipe, but I found a much easier way to prepare the pumpkin for the puree. I pierce the pumpkin multiple times with a skewer and microwave it on high for 13 minutes. leave it in the microwave after it stops for 5 minutes after which time the stem will come off with barely any effort and the pumpkin will be as soft as a cooked carrot. You slice it in half and scoop out all the seeds then you are ready to make your pie.

I bought 7 Sugar Pumpkins and then thought Okay, make Pumpkins Pies for Thanksgiving. So I cleaned them and baked them, put the puree through my food processor and then I thought I now need a recipe.  I checked around and then found this recipe. I followed the recipe instructions and the only thing I changed was the amount of pumpkin pie spice. I added another tsp. This recipe had me a little worried as it is very liquidly , my old recipe was not. But I went ahead and made it and it was amazing and tasted great. The custard set perfectly and was nice and deep, it really fills up the 9 inch pie plate. The flavour was  really yummy. I made two pies and they looked perfect. It really is a delicious recipe and it turns out perfect. I will be keeping this recipe and I will make it again and again. My Family just loved this Pumpkin Pie !!!! Give it a try . Well worth it.

This was an amazing pie, though because I don't eat grains or dairy I subbed evaporated coconut milk for the evaporated milk and almond flour for the all purpose. Turned out amazing. My guests didn't even know the difference!

I consider myself to be  a good cook, but I had never made a pumpkin pie.  I had grown some pie pumpkins, so wanted to give it a shot.  The pie as made was reported by 3 people as "best I ever had".  highly recommended.  get  a fresh pumpkin, make the puree as in Cooks Illustrated.

Absolutely better than store bought.  I'd suggest skipping the salt in the pie if there's some in the crust. If using a pie pumpkin (about 4 cups of cooked pumpkin), you can make two pies. I always use the Allrecipe pie crust (with lard), but the graham cracker crust is pretty good. Considering the store cost, if the pie wasn't this good, it wouldn't be worth the effort - but oh,  baby! Also, it mashes like potatoes; if you want smooth - like out of a can - you have to use a blender.

The recipe doesn't include cooking the pumpkin: Take a cookie sheet and coat with cooking spray.  Cut pumpkin half. Remove stalk. Remove innards. Save seeds for baked pumpkin seeds. Scrape innards clean with spoon. Put 2 halves face down on sheet. Cover with foil, tucking corners of foil underneath between cookie sheet and pumpkin face. Bake 90 min at 350. Let water drain. After cooling a few minutes, use plastic spoon or ice cream scoop to remove meat from skin

This was my first time to make a fresh pumpkin pie.  It's something I've always wanted to do.  I found that one sugar pumpkin was the perfect size for this recipe.  The pie was delicious!  The brown sugar carmelized to give it a great flavor.  I may not be able to go back to canned pumpkin.

I made it with long island cheese pumpkin. I've made it twice and it was a hit with all my family both times. So much better than canned pumpkin, and the long island cheese variety is great for baking.

I had a happy accident this year when preparing my garden bed. I added our compost and about a week later I noticed some plants sprouting even though I hadn't planted anything yet. I decided to let them grow and see what they were. They were pumpkins! Last Thanksgiving I had made pumpkin soup and I guess the seeds survived. They were the sugar pie pumpkins so I knew what I had to do.
I searched the internet for recipes and decided on this one. It was great! I did add some fresh ground cardamom to the recipe, it adds a brightness to the flavor that I like. I made two pies and they disappeared fast. This is now my go to pumpkin pie recipe, really, really delicious and easy to do.

This was the first time I made a pumpkin pie without using a can, and it turned out great.  Mrs Sigg is my new best friend!  The recipe calls for a bit too much pumpkin pie spice for my taste, but that is easily adjusted.

I made this for thanksgiving and it came out fantastic! I added an extra T of the pumpkin spice and I was happy I did because it was perfect. This was my first time making fresh pumpkin pie and it was a total hit.

This is one of the best pies I ever made.
I used a regular pumpkin one for Jacko lanterns, I used a little bit extra pumpkin pie spice and sprinkled cinnamon on before I baked.
My house smelled awesome. 
I will never use can again

No changes.  Was absolutely delicious.  I did learn after making the pies the first time last year to bake the pumpkins and make the puree way before I made the pies this year.  I just pre-measured and froze the puree.  This way, it is not such a long process.  It makes it much more pleasant to make.  Great recipe.

This will be the 4th year I'm making this recipe for Thanksgiving,  and has always been a huge hit! In past years I've made it with a spiced wafer crust (recipe from the Ivin's box) and have occasionally garnished it with a ring of Trader Joe's Sweet and Spicy candied pecans. I think I'm going to try it with a traditional crust this year since one year it went head-to-head with my mom's standard Libby's canned pumpkin pie recipe, and everyone liked my filling better, but some preferred the regular crust. I'll just need to take people's advice about increasing the pumpkin pie spice since it won't have the extra support from the spiced wafers.

My 5 year old son came home from school insisting we make a pumpkin pie from a pumpkin (not from a can as my mom had taught me).  This recipe was easy enough my 5 year old was able to help with quite a bit of it and the pie turned out DELICIOUS!
The only change I made (due to ingredients on hand) was I used a graham cracker crust.  The recipe made more filling than I could fit into the pie crust. I doubled it and was able to make 3 pies.

I love this pie!!  I’ve been making it for a couple of years and thought it was high time I gave it the five stars it deserves!  I make mine like the recipe, without any changes necessary.  I always get compliments on it and have been requested several times to make it for family dinners.  For me, this is the ONLY recipe for pumpkin pie!

Just when you think, "is all this fuss really worth it?  Isn't a canned pumpkin just as easy and delicious?  Or if I pick up a pie from the store?"  The answer is, "it's waaaay better!"

Mind you, this is does take a few more steps than the traditional libby's pumpkin pie recipe (which is not bad, by any means), or even going to the store.  
But the result is a notch above the conventional or any store bought.  

It really is amazing heavenly!  It's a real treat.  I wouldn't suggest going through all this fuss if you are also making a huge dinner.  But if you are just making pie and you want to make it a real special one, this is it.  Spend the time.  Do it.  You'll be rewarded and compliments will come your way.    

This year's sugar pumpkins were a good deal, so I made it with organic sugar pumpkin.  And it yielded a little more than 3 cups.  But 3 cups of pumpkin puree is all you need.  

If you make your own butter pie crust, like I did, it'll take you to another realm.  It's a special treat and those who partake of it won't be disappointed.

This is my first time making a pumpkin pie with a real pumpkin.  I bought the sugar pumpkin from a local apple/pumpkin farm and it was the BEST pumpkin pie anyone in my family had ever had.  I've never opened a can of pumpkin and thought, "Yummy", but the sugar pumpkin smelled SOOO good coming out of the oven!  Would definitely make it again!

A bit hit!  Yumm-o!  Not a slice left.  The only change I made was that I used dark brown sugar and an extra egg because my eggs were medium sized.  I used the pumpkin spice (20476) recipe and doubled it up to reflect the measurements for this recipe, making a small change by using half/half clove/allspice.

My first pumpkin pie ever and wow it is great. I boiled the raw pulp instead of baking the pumpkins. It was a little runny  because of that but it didn't stop anyone from eating it. Thank you!

Absolutely unbelievable. I do a pie contest vs a different family member every year at Thanksgiving and this is going to win...easily. 

Slight tweaks:
-Made my own pumpkin spice (which takes 30 seconds) from a recipe I grabbed from a different food 'network' website. I did 1.5 times the nutmeg it called for, which turned out fantastic.
-I did about 2.5 cups of pumpkin instead of 2 cups.

Both tweaks turned out great! My wife and I could not believe how good this is.

REALLY looking forward to seeing everyone's reactions on Thanksgiving!

This is seriously the best pie I've ever had and family and friends agree!  I have made 6 now within a week for people to have because they love it so much.  I did use a refrigerator crust, but it was just as good with it.  I've already been asked to make it for Thanksgiving and am freezing the puree as we speak!!  Didn't change a thing on the recipe!

I made this recipe but as I did not have any condensed milk so I made it with whipping cream. Worked out well!  i will use the recipe again. With all pumpkin pie recipes I use my own mix of spices.

I have made this recipe for my family for Thanksgiving for the last five years.  Everyone loves it.  My fiance's mother has started asking for a pie as her Christmas present.

This recipe can be made dairy-free by substituting a can of coconut milk for the evaporated milk.

I have also made it with agave instead of sugar.  You have to add another 1/2 tbsp of flour, but the flavor is quite nice.

Delicious and I even forgot the egg the 2nd time I made it. I also tried a graham cracker crust and got mad raves on it. Thank you! And as far as the tough work of pumpkin, I canned my own pumpkin after I made my first one and quart jars are perfect for home-made pumpkin. Just the perfect amount for this recipe!!!!!!

Never made pumpkin pie before. I used the pumpkins that we had on our porch for fall.  Only changes I made was substituting cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg for the pumpkin pie spice.  Turned out awesome. Even my wife, who doesn't like pumpkin pie, liked this (and I'm pretty sure she wasn't just saying that).

Wow. My husband and I have never really liked pumpkin pie before. My son brought home a pumpkin from the school field trip to the pumpkin patch and begged me to make a pie out of it. I found this recipe and... WOW. I will be making it again for sure. My husband and I are in love with it. I had so much extra pumpkin since I had a somewhat large one I was working with. I just blended it up, added a little salt, and froze it in ice cube trays to feed to the baby later. Great recipe!! Can't wait to make it again!

I pureed my Halloween pumpkins and made this recipe with the fresh puree. It was very soft and smooth. Definitely will be making it again!

Best ever.  Be careful with your crust protector -- so it doesn't stick to the pie.

This is by far the best pumpkin pie that I have ever had.  Like other reviews I was a bit nervous about how watery it was going into the oven, but it baked beautifully and in the time specified.  My family LOVES this pie and canned pumpkin pie is now banned from our house !

This is my go-to pumpkin pie recipe.  I usually add some extra spice, like other reviews suggest. I love that it makes enough for two pies. If I don't need both then I usually freeze the extra filling. It thaws and bakes wonderfully and can be a great thing to have in your freezer during the holidays!

I just made this and it is awesome. I used a medium size regular pumpkin, which made enough for 2 pies , so I doubled the recipe. And added a little extra spice. Nice, fluffy and tasty. thanks

Instead of evaporated milk, I used 1/2 whipping cream and 1/2 1% milk and it came out fluffy and tasty.  As well, I looked up a recipe for pumpkin pie spice and sprinkled that in liberally - was excellent!

Made the pie as directed, with two exceptions.  Brushed the bottom of the pie shell with beaten egg white before pouring in the filling to prevent sogginess. Next time will also pre-bake pie shell, then add filling and bake as directed.  Used AR Pumpkin Pie Spice II recipe for the pumpkin pie spice.  It only makes appx. 2 tsp. so I used what I had.  No harm done to the pie. Definitely worth the effort of roasting the fresh pumpkin.  This is a delicious recipe.  Old timey in taste.  Like the fresh pumpkin pies my mother used to make. Mother used to peel, cube and boil her pumpkin.  Roasting the pumpkin is much easier.  The roasting process gives a slightly different taste to the pumpkin, but it is still delicious. Mashed the roast pumpkin with a potato masher instead of putting  it in a blender.  Liked the texture, as it resembled the texture of the pumpkin  pies of my childhood. I made one very full 9" deep dish pumpkin pie using this recipe.  I think trying to make two regular 9"pies would result in "skimpy" pies. This recipe is definitely a keeper.  So much better than the "canned" pumpkin pie.  Thank you for sharing this one.

Good but not really worth all the effort with the pumpkin, not to mention the crust. Made it since it doesn't exist here and never tried it fresh. I'd say use canned puree if it's available, it's gonna save you a lot of time.

Very straight-forward to make, and the result is sublime. When warm, it seems like there's too little spice, but when it's completely cool the amount turns out to be PERFECT.

I used a convection oven, so lowered all the temperatures by 20C (cooking at 210C for 10 minutes, then 155C for 40 minutes). I didn't use aluminium foil and the pastry turned out perfectly, no burning. In the Netherlands, "Spekulaaskruiden" can be substituted for the pumpkin pie spice, and in the UK, "Mixed Spice" (in both cases the taste/ingredients are virtually identical to pumpkin spice).

DELICIOUS! First time ever making Pumpkin Pie, was very easy to follow and used a regular pumpkin instead of a sugar, came out amazing. Definitely will be making this again.

My 6-year-old son is a pumpkin pie connoisseur. We thought a side-by-side taste test with the standard canned Libby's pumpkin recipe would be fun. We were both wow'd by the difference in taste. This pie is so much more delicious and has a better consistency than the Libby's recipe. Definitely worth the time and effort to roast and puree a sugar pumpkin!

My eleven year old daughter made this recipe, it was the first time she had ever made pumpkin pie (any pie for that matter), and it was so good my husband and I snuck downstairs after everyone went to bed and ate another piece.  She used a Marie Calendar crust and had some left over puree.  We were a little concerned that the puree was runny but it set perfectly. Yum! Yum! Yum!

yummy - just be sure you pour off the excess water from the pumpkin once cooked. I also found this made more filling than necessary for a 9" pie pan.

Have made this pie countless times! I do use 1 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice and use heavy whipping cream (the real stuff, not the  with carrageenan) instead of evaporated milk as it makes it even better! I always have a little extra pie filling and pour it into a small glass cooking dish and enjoy it once it cools! Delicious!

I think this is the best recipe for Pumpkin Pie I have ever made. It is fantastic. But next time I will add a bit more Nutmeg Spice on top of the Pp-spice. But I would really recommend this one for sure.

Good recipe . A "pie gourmet" neighbor rated it a 8.5/10 ! I made a few amendments. Substituted condensed milk for evaporated, omitted the sugar. (Condensed milk is already sweetened.) I roasted and added two turnips to the pumpkin, added more flavor so spices didn't dominate.  I don't know exactly what pumpkin spice is so added, 1 tsp of each cinnamon , nutmeg and allspice. 
Pre-baked 'Mrs. Smith's frozen pie crust for 10 min at 450. Followed all other directions as written. YUM,

Made this for the first time for Thanksgiving a few days ago. Made on Wednesday, then refrigerated overnight. I did use a pie pumpkin (a 4 lb pumpkin yields a bit more than 2 cups of puree). Baked it per the instructions, then put in my food processor to puree. I did that ahead of time on the Tues before Thanksgiving. I used refrigerated pie crusts, and used a crust shield to prevent the over-browning of the crust. Like others, I increased the pie spice to 1 T (3 tsp). I baked it in a 10 inch pie plate: it was filled to the brim with no custard left over. Took a bit longer to cook but set up perfectly! It was perfect...seriously tasty, excellent texture. I will always use fresh pumpkin and this recipe in the future. Try it!!!

Absolutely delicious, I enjoyed it and pumpkin pie is not my favorite but I went for seconds.  As others stated it is running prior to baking but it forms well after cooking.

I , like SO MANY others had never made a "real" pumpkin pie & just stumbled on this recipe when trying to find out how to make it. I personally roasted my pie pumpkins in the oven (a bit too long I think too) for about an hr @ 325 after cutting them in 1/2 & cleaning the "guts" as my boys so eloquently put it. This made extra work when turning into a purée as I had to add water & really work at it BUT once I got it to the consistency of baby food or smooth applesauce & it was PERFECT!!! Best pies I ever made (minus I burned the  crust & using parchment paper to try to prevent further burning it stuck to the top so they aren't as pretty as I wld like) but sure is tasty!!

I haven't used any other recipe since I've found this one! This year I did make a few changes though and it was even better, not that I thought it was possible, but my family also likes a little more spice. Here's what I did:  First of all, my blender wasn't doing what it was supposed to do, so I added all the ingredients at the start with 1/4 -1/2 tsp ground cloves added in and only 3/4 can evaporated milk ...I still had left over filling...Anyway, I blended the ingredients on the lowest speed, gradually increasing till the fastest, blending until I began to see a few bubbles, then poured it into a frozen deep dish pie crust. Saved alot of time and dishes!! A must for anyone who hates the clean up!!!

Best pumpkin pie I've ever had and it was easy to make! I will never go to the canned stuffed again. I am making it my second time and I made sure to buy 12 pumpkins so I can freeze any left over purée.

This is the best pumpkin pie I have ever had. The only part I changed was I used my pumpkin that I cooked and froze earlier in the month. I had little bit of the recipe left over and poured in a ramakin dish. Yummy. Thank you so much for sharing.

This will be my third thanksgiving using this recipe.  It is so scary to an infrequent baker because it doesn't look like it will turn out... But EVERY time it is beautiful and delicious.  I especially love how well it will freeze so I can bake a week or two in advance and cross it off my list quickly :)

This pie is just delicious.  It is so worth the extra effort to use fresh pumpkin.  We look forward to Thanksgiving and Christmas for so many reasons - this pie included.

I don't like Canned milk, use milk or cream or half and half check recipes for this. Making Pumpkin Puree, i have tried several ones but the very easy one is follow instructions then boil them them till tender, cool then peel off the skin  and if u have  a food processor use it tell well blended. The pumpkin i had made 9 cups. Have and a great Thanksgiving. Was lucky and got my pumpkin for $ 2.00 at Walmart great price.U can use any fresh pumpkin

Wonderful flavor when I added extra spices--about 1tsb - just my flavor preference.

Made this pie two days later again it was so awesome! 2ndpie was better with the sugar pumpkin vs the carving pumpkin I used the first time -much smoother with the sugar pumpkin. Posted pics of both.

This was my first time making a fresh pumpkin pie.  It was very delicious and not too sweet.  I wanted to use a frozen pie crust but since I went through all the effort to roast a pumpkin I thought a homemade crust was in order.  Crisco's recipe was easy and delicious.

Great recipe, classic pumpkin pie taste with a little extra richness from the real pumpkin. I did made it as the recipe was written the first time, very good, but I prefer a little more spice so I gave the mixture a little extra shake of spice the second time and it was perfect. Whip up a batch of fresh whip cream and you won't have to worry about making room in your fridge for leftovers!

I made this pie as written except I used fat free evaporated milk. I have made 2 in the last week and the reviews were great. This is by far the best pumpkin pie recipe that I have ever tried. The beautiful sugar pumpkins that I used were just the right size to make 2 pies and they were so creamy inside that I didn't need to puree it. I'm going back today to get more pumpkins to 'can' so we can eat pumpkin pie all year long. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Seriously ?!?! I was giving myself major props on the back ! I felt like this was a pie from the best pie shop around ! I wouldn't change anything about this recipe, EXCEPT, I baked my pie pumpkins for 90 minutes at 350. I had a different recipe before where it suggested baking the pumpkins for 45 min at 350, and it just wasn't long enough ( and that could be my oven, but 90 minutes worked out great, & I didn't have to blend it. I was able to scrape everything out with a spoon and hand mash/puree it before adding everything else. I am so happy with this pie, I am making it again for Thanksgiving & Christmas. 

I cheated a little & used a Marie Callender's frozen pie crust. Other than that, yum yum yum !

This is the best pumpkin pie I've ever tasted. Fortunately I read other reviews, and did not stress when the filling was incredibly runny before putting the pie in the oven. It baked to perfection. -
Normally I need to amend new recipes that I try, but this one I followed to the letter and it was truly perfect. Thanks for sharing this fab recipe.

I have had this recipe for a while and have been dying to make it.  So I finally bought two sugar pumpkins, made my own puree, and used two cups of it in this recipe.  I used Chef John's Pie crust also on this site.  This pi was delicious!  I have to agree with other reviewers and will probably add a little more pumpkin pie spice next time, but other than that, this is going to be my go to pumpkin pie recipe. I'm glad I tried it before Thanksgiving rolls around.  No more canned pumpkin for me.  At least I'll know what to do with all those Halloween pumpkins that will be left over.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Good pie - came out soft and tasty but brown on top. Definitely needs to be refrigerated overnight, though - eat it right away and it's really too liquidy and eggy.

Also - really needs more spice! I ended up using 2 tablespoons of fresh-ground nutmeg, 2 tbsp cinnamon, and 1 tbsp allspice - and it was so delicious!

For the crust, I recommend John's Easy Pie Crust - http://allrecipes.com/recipe/easy-homemade-pie-crust/detail.aspx - it's easy and I made four of them in 30 minutes!

Loved this recipe! I only increased Pumpkin pie spice to 1 Tablespoon. Everyone loved it and said it had a great flavor. Refrigerating the pie overnight really advanced flavor. I did not use a can of evaporated milk, instead I used 1 cup of milk on hand. It tasted fine.

First time making a fresh pumpkin pie and it turned out really well! Wouldn't change a thing! I served this with fresh cinnamon whipped cream and everyone raved over it at Thanksgiving, even the few who said they don't normally like/eat pumpkin pie.

According to my 6 year old, Jackson, who helped me make the pie:  "This is a 5 star pumpkin pie.  I liked everything about it.  If I could give it half a million stars, I would!"

I've made fresh pumpkin pie before, but not with this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, but didn't get the texture filling I expected.   The filling tasted like I expected and was delicious, but the pie itself was very soft and didn't set up like the custard-based pumpkin pie recipes that use a lot more eggs.  I doubt I'll make this again, but that's because I prefer a firmer pie that doesn't "slouch" on the plate.

This was my first time making a fresh pumpkin pie. It turned out great. I used a "cheese" pumpkin and everything else was exactly as written. The pumpkin was big enough that I got 4 pies out of it. I will make this again!

The BEST pumpkin pie I have ever had.  I read the reviews and per recommendations did increase the spices to 1 tbsp and decreased the sugar to 3/4 c.  Everyone LOVED it.  Worst part is there were no leftovers from two pies!!

This will be my fourth year making this recipe. Ever since I made this pie, I have people asking me to make pumpkin pie each year for now on.  
There is one little flaw with this recipe, it makes enough for two pies. I use or make 9" pie shells and this recipe makes two pies. Which I do not mind making two pies.
Other then the large batch of pie filling, this is the best pie recipe ever! I used a cinderella pumpkin which is another great pumpkin to use for baking.

Didn't have a sugar pumpkin and used a small regular jack'o one.  Still turned out great.  As others have said, made my own crust.  Makes all the difference.  Keeping this recipe for sure!  YUM!

I have been making my own puree for a while but always used the Libby's recipe.  This is a very well written recipe for those who have never used a sugar pumpkin before.  The ingredients are spot on and make a flavorful pie. My only additions were to add a bit of Bourbon and vanilla extract.  I left out the salt due to dietary needs - didn't miss it at all.  I did sub the evaporated milk with an 8 ounce container of soy cream cheese I thinned down with 4 ounces of vanilla coconut milk. (I made two pies)  I wont be using Libby's recipe anymore!

Wow, awesome pie. I used a regular Halloween pumpkin and had enough for four pies. Great recipe. I use a little vanilla extract. But followed the recipe to a tee and it came out great.

This was my first time making pumpkin pie, and it was simple and delicious.  I was a little concerned about the milky like consistency, but all was well!  My mother-in-law who doesn't like pumpkin pie loved this one as well as the rest of the family.  My father-in-law ate half the pie when no one was looking!  I put up lots of pumpkin so this will definately be on the menu for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Perfect as written.  I microwaved the pumpkin for 20 min instead of oven- baked. I recommend processing the pumpkin instead of mashing to eliminate any stringy pumpkin in your pie.  We used our giant halloween pumpkin, not the special sugar pumpkin, and it was delicious.  I processed the whole pumpkin and froze 2c each in bags, enough to make 9 pies!

My daughter brought home two sugar pumpkins from a field trip, so I turned them into pie. This is great - a lot of work, but the instructions all make sense and seem to be accurate. Tastes great. I might reduce the liquid in my filling next time. The middle of the pie wasn't set in 50 minutes, so I took the advice of another reviewer, turned the oven off, and left the pie sitting inside for another hour. One thing: my regular blender didn't work for pureeing the pumpkin at all, but my immersion blender was perfect. That's what I'd recommend!

This was my first time making a pumpking pie from scratch and this recipe was fantastic. My husband is not a pumpkin pie fan and he loved it :) Thanks for sharing your great recipe. One thing I noticed was that the recipe was enough to make two pumpkin pies with the store bought pie crust. Thanks again :)

Everyone loved it. I was a little concerned because it was so watery when I put it in the crust but I followed the directions exactly for cooking it. It was perfect.

Love both the texture and taste. Perfect with whipped cream! I didn't have pumpkin pie spices so used mix of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and all spice. It will make two shallow 9-inch pie, or one DEEP-dish 9 inch pie.

I used frozen pilsbury crusts and had a little more than two cups of pie puree from my pumpkin. I added a little more of the spices and sugar and was able to fill two shallow 9 inch pies to the brim. So yummy! Nobody could believe I made it from a real pie!

I made this pie using a sugar pumpkin grown in my backyard and brought it to thanksgiving dinner at my mother-in-law's house. I also whipped up some whipping cream to serve on top. Everyone raved about it, and insisted it was better than my mother-in-law's recipe. This was slightly embarrassing, but if that's the reaction you want I suggest you make this recipe and bring it to your next family gathering. I should mention that I followed the recipe exactly but there was too much filling for my crust (Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust from this site) and it spilled over onto the edges of the crust and baking sheet before I put it in the oven. So I didn't end up using every drop of filling. After

Awesome recipe and finally one that starts with making the pumpkin puree from a pumpkin and not just listing a can of pumpkine puree as ingredient. It was so easy to make, while the pumpkin was baking I made the crust. Great taste, my whole family loved it. Definitely our number one pumpkin pie recipe from now on!

My family and I love this recipe !  I also make tarts with the filling so that my kids can take them to school and enjoy the yumminess at lunch!  This recipe is goof proof(great for amateurs like me).... I even had to modify the condensed milk, as I only had cereal cream and whole milk, and it still turned beautifully!  Thank you Mrs. Siggs for a terrific recipe!

So highly rated thought I would try it for Thanksgiving instead of my usual pumpkin pie recipe.  Was not happy with the flavor.  My husband and son even commented they didn't like the pumpkin pie this year, and they didn't know I had used a different recipe.

This pie was excellent and my first attempt at pumpkin pie from an actual pumpkin. I did add all the ingredients back into the blender before pouring them into the crust just to make sure everything was good and pureed. This was a lot of work but well worth it. As other reviews mentioned, it is soooo easy to freeze the puree and make another pie later that I did so with another pumpkin.

This was probably the best pumpkin pie I have ever had, and made as a matter of fact! I would recommend this to anyone.

Not sure what a "sugar pumpkin" is, so we used our fall pumpkin. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, but used a little mix of cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg. This was delicious and super easy!

I made this pie this year out of a regular pumpkin. Had to cook it almost twice as long because of too much liquid, so I would cut down on the evaporated milk.  It was worth trying it, but my guests said the pie tasted as good as those out of a can.  So use the canned pumpkin instead.

Use 3 cups of cooked pumpkin.  I spent so much time looking for this info elsewhere that I am not giving this 5 stars.  (I used part of a larger pumpkin).  It took me about 45 to cook my big sections of the large pumpkin I used (in a dish with water, covered w/ foil at 375F) (next time I will cook it in the pressure cooker in 5 mins!). The 2nd reason is, I much prefer adding the separate spices.  I used 1/2 cup honey and 1/2 cup Splenda.  Sweetness was perfect and flavor was mellow and home-made, different from those overpowering store-bought ones.  It is wonderful making it from scratch - Highly recommend it!  This was my first time and it came out perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This is THE PIE that you want.  This recipe is so good, that I put 8 pumpkins in the freezer so I can make it year round.  Super Easy & Super Delicious!!  Made even better with fresh grated nutmeg :)

OK, I HATE to be one of the people in the obvious minority, but I did not care for this recipe.  I rated it earlier today as a 5 star pie because it came out of the oven looking like perfection...however, now that I have cut into and tasted it, I can't even believe I wasted the time.  Pumpkin pie isn't my favorite to begin with due to the soft texture, but this was - more the texture of a pumpkin mousse.  Creamy on the knife, sloppy on the plate, taste is just average.

This was absolutely perfect! It was my first time making a pumpkin pie, so as I poured the filling in and it was runny I was worried! Never fear, it came out beautifully and set up just the way it should. I used the pumpkin pie spice II recipe from on here and it was delicious.

I always make fresh pumpkin pie for TG.  I grow the sugar pumpkins in my garden.  I always put a frozen pea in the middle of the pie when it is done.  Eventually someone always asks:  What is the pea for?  Answer: Pumpkin  lol

I'm an Aussie and we don't get canned pie pumpkin here. I've been looking for a recipe using fresh pumpkin for years! Many thanks for posting this delicious Fresh variation.  I used what we call butternut pumpkin and it was marvellous. This is going to be a year round favourite in our house, seeing as we don't have a Thanksgiving Day.

I was never a huge fan of pumpkin pie until I made this pie. I'd always had the pie using pumpkin from a can, and it really is much better fresh. I used 3T of "pumpkin pie spice" -- a mixture of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and cloves since I didn't have the pre-mixed stuff, and it was perfect. I used a frozen pie crust (deep dish) and still had enough for a small pie left over. I think this recipe would fill two regular frozen pie shells. Great with whipped cream!

Having never tried pumpkind pie before we had no idea what to expect but this was gorgeous. Worth the time and effort and would make this again for guests. I subbed butternut squash for the pumpkin which didn't take as long to cook so the pie was dark orange and tasted kinda caramelised. Also used Pumpkin Pie Spice II recipe and a digestive biscuit (graham cracker?) and butter base. Yummy!

The hardest part for me was trying to cut open the pumpkin.  Otherwise it was an easy recipe.  I was able to make two pies from the one recipe.  My friend that I made it for raved about how good it was!

This pie was fantastic -- flavorful, thick and creamy. It passed the in-law test, and even our 6-year-old nephew devoured an entire slice! I'd never made a pumpkin pie before, let alone one from scratch, and this recipe was very simple to make and easy to follow. I did skip the from-scratch pie crust and use a pre-made one instead, but it didn't take away from the awesomeness of the pie. The only thing I would advise is to avoid whisking the pie mixture too much before pouring it in the pie shell. It will be a little bubbly on the top, and the top won't be 100% smooth after baking. But if you're not concerned with the "pretty" factor, it's not a big deal. The flavor and consistency aren't compromised one bit. Also, refrigerating it overnight helped immensely; it set nicely and the flavors blended wonderfully.

This recipe is the best pumpkin pie recipe I've had, and with my grandmothers, that's saying something. A pumpkin will have enough for about four of these pies, so I just made the filling with the leftover pumpkin puree and put it in the microwave on high for 3 minutes, stirring every minute. The more filling you have, the more time in the microwave, but still take it out and stir every minute. It is a nice little pudding type thing, a delicious afternoon snack.

This was the first time I had used real pumpkin in a pie-and this recipe was AMAZING! I actually just cleaned my pumpkin out-threw it in a microwave bowl, covered it with plastic wrap and nuked it for 15 minutes. You could just take the skin right off, no fuss. Then I took a hand held blender and blended it for a minute and it was a perfect puree. Otherwise-I followed the recipe to a tee. After following the recipe it was the consistency of water when I poured it in my homemade crust, but it turned out perfect. BEST pumpkin pie I have ever had....and I am not even a pumpkin pie fan really! I considered using a topping..but this pie doesn't need it! Five stars for sure!

First pie I ever made.  It was fantastic.  I brought it to my parent's place for Thanksgiving but they had already bought a pumpkin pie.  They tasted my pie and I only got mediocre reviews.  It was eaten up anyway.  The next day, when they got around to eating the store-bought pie, they phoned me up with rave reviews.  There was absolutely no comparison!  The second time I made this pie, wanting to use up the rest of the homemade puree, I decided to make my own crust.  Followed the Never Fail Pie Crust II and it was an amazing result.  Not bad for a first time pie and crust maker!!

REALLY like this recipe.  Never cooked an actual pumpkin before.  It was nice to show the kids that pumpkins are used for more than carving and pie doesn't have to come from a can. I used a refrigerated pie crust - I know I cheat but it was still good.  And that filling... I thought it was better than that recipe on the can.  But the pie looks the same as the standard - so you can fool the people that have only had the Libby's version and won't try anything new.  (Can't stand those people - but every family has one I guess.) The pumpkin and spice flavors blended nicely and the brown sugar gave it a little something extra I think.  Try it. It sounds time consuming but how hard is it to slice open a pumpkin and toss it in the oven? Let it cool slightly and mash it like you would potatoes (w/o butter of course!).  EASY!

The best pumpkin pie I've had! I added a half a cup more brown sugar and made the pumpkin pie spice a tablespoon like others have suggested.  I made 2 pies and they were delicious!

I made this pie for my parents yesterday 10/18/08. I will be making mine today so I haven't tasted it. I asked my parents to call me after they tasted it to let me know if I NEEDED to add anything EX. (more sugar, more spice). My dad called me and said to me that it was "right on the money" don't change a thing. Excellent texture and taste. My Mom said it was perfect and delicious, and believe me they are honest people.lol So kudos to you!!  I can't wait to make mine today. Thank you.

This was great, you can really taste the difference between fresh and canned.  I added extra spice and sugar.   My major complaint was that the pie took about 1 1/2 hours to set up which caused the bottom of the crust to burn.  I strained the purreed pumpkin overnight and it was still really wet.  I huess it should be strained even more.

I just tried a piece of this pie. It was still warm and melted in my mouth. It took a long time to set up. It was in the oven for 1 1/2 hours. I don't think it was my oven. Oh well. It is good. I'm going to try the Fresh Pumpkin Pie recipe next.

I was confused on the 1 sugar pumpkin, but learned from other recipes that you should get a cup of puree.  It came out a little liquidy at first however it made an excellent pie.  I even made a homemade pie crust, I wouldn't feel right making homemade pumpkin pie without a homemade crust!  I'll be using this in the future for Thanksgiving.

My 6 year old grandson picked pumpkins from a pumpkin patch and brought them to me saying, "Maw Maw, would you PLEASE make me a pie?"  I hadn't made a 'fresh' one in years but since he asked, I said sure.  He helped clean the pumpkins and I did the rest.  The only difference was I used 'Splenda', it worked great!  The pie was very creamy unlike the dryness you sometimes get from canned pumpkin.

There is no other way to have pumpkin pie.

Tasted great and there was exactly the right amout of filling for my pie crust. I used my food processor to puree the pumpkin and also to mix the filling ingredients. The only complaint I have is that the filling browned too much and it didn't look as good as some of the other pumpkin pie recipes I've tried (even though it tasted better). Next time I'll probably cover the whole thing with foil rather than just the crust.

Wonderful pie!  This made enough for one deep dish or two disposable pie tins.  I made one for guests and then four more for our neighbors because it turned out so well.  
The only thing I changed was that I baked the pumpkin in a casserole dish with about an inch of water.  I've done pumpkin both ways before and this always makes it turn out soft and easy to scoop out and mix up.

This was the first time I ever made pumpkin pie using fresh pumpkin.  I did not know how much pumpkin I needed to get enough pulp.  The produce guys were no help, so I came home with 3 small "pie pumpkins."  In addition to this pie, I'll be making some pumpkin bread and pumpkin cookies, plus freezing some pulp for later use!

The pie turned out wonderful.  My sons loved it.  In addition to pureeing the pumpkin, I put it through a sifter to make sure there were no "chunks."  It was added work, but worth it.  I also added an additional half tsp of cinnamon.

I used a "pat in the pan" piecrust which made it really easy.

The pumpkin pie portion was delicious, but sometimes you can't better a good thing. My husband and I both agreed that the streusel topping was alright, but we like our pumpkin pie the traditional way without the streusel on top - Less work as well. Will make again, minus the topping.

My, my, my, what a difference fresh pumpkin makes.....this was positively delicious!! With my pumpkin I had enough for two pies. Used the recipe on this site for Basic Flaky Pie Crust (I recommend that one as well!).  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so I used a combination of cinammon, ginger and nutmeg.  Very, very good and worth the extra time & effort, though this wasn't hard to make at all.  Only problem was we couldn't wait to let it chill overnight, we had to try it the same day.  Can't wait to taste it today; I'm sure it'll be even better!  Yet another winning recipe, Beth........thank you!!!

I lost this recipe and I'm so glad I found it again. I made this last year and got rave reviews all around. It turned out so moist and tender--fantastic.
