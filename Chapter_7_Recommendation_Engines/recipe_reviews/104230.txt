Absolutely fantastic!  This year's turkey was SO moist and delicious.  I've done this with chicken tenders before I deep fry them but never thought about doing it with a whole turkey.  It was wonderful and I won't roast my turkeys without brining them first.  I also took some advise from a member who submitted a recipe that called for roasting the turkey upside down to keep the breast meat from drying out and it works beautifully.

My turkey was done on the outside but not done closer to the bone. I had a 12 lb, turkey in for 3 hours and followed the directions, I had to put it back in for 1 hr. 30min. I wouldn't brine it again.

My turkey was self-basted (pre-brined), so I didn't need to brine, but otherwise just did the melted butter, pepper and a bit of salt on the skin, and stuck 2 tablespoons under the skin over each breast to keep it moist - absolutely delicious, plain and simple, and used the drippings to make gravy.  This was actually my first time cooking turkey.  This one turned out much better than the second turkey I made with a cooking light magazine recipe.

Brining the turkey made all the difference in the world!  Definitely a keeper.

It wasn't exactly the easiest to do, but I wouldn't make my turkey any other way from now on.  Be sure you rinse it really well - mine was still a bit salty but delicious and juicy.

This recipe turned out great.  I would just note to make sure you have a large bucket for the brine as mine wasted alot when the turkey made it overflow.  Also, I needed alot more cooking time to hit the desired temps, and alot more butter than the recipe called for, but the latter is just personal preference.  I also brined overnight.  Still I got alot of compliments on my very first turkey I ever cooked, and I'm not very handy in the kitchen, so this recepi is cerctainly worth the effort.

Just used the brining part as a guide, then cooked turkey in a bag.  My turkey,  the first I've ever made turned out great.  It was super moist!  My husband, who is not a huge fan of turkey really like it.  The extra effort of brining in worth it and really not a whole lot more work.

This is a great supplement to the rosemary roasted turkey.  I add all the flavors to the brine and the turkey comes out perfect!!

This was my first time roasting a turkey and I had amazing success with this recipe.  It truly was a piece of cake and I recommend this recipe to anyone that wants a no hassle way of cooking a great bird on Thanksgiving or any other day of the year.  Enjoy!
