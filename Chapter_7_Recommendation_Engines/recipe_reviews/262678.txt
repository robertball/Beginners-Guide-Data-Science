I made this with a deep dish 9 inch pie crust. It was so full, some of the egg mixture overflowed and looked like an omelet, put it back on top as it was setting.  AMAZING! We all loved it a lot! Definitely will be making again! Thank you!

Iâ€™m vegetarian so I took out the ham and added cauliflower and cherry tomatoes. Delicious! And so easy to make.

This quiche was so easy to make and delicious. My husband loves western omelettes, so this was perfect to fix for both of us.
