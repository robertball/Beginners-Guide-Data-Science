I scaled this down to 2 servings for just me and my husband. I knew that I wouldn't need the full amount of coating, so I only used 1/4 cup of panko and parmesan (even though half the recipe would be double that). The amount was perfect, with none left over. As I mentioned, I used panko instead of dry bread crumbs, and I also used fresh parsley, as I had it on hand. I had peeled and deveined my shrimp earlier in the day, and they were too dry for the coating to stick to them, so I drizzled a bit of olive oil on them before coating. You really have to press the coating on them to get them to stick. I have another recipe that is very similar to this one, where you butterfly the shrimp and brush them with the melted butter, and then sprinkle the breading on top of them. I think in hindsight, that method works better. These are very tasty, and something that we will definitely make again.

These were really great and ridiculously easy to make.  My only complaint (and it was a minimal complaint) was that I’d prefer the seasoning to give it a slight crisp to the outside, but this I have simply been an error on my end.  I might have even added a little too much butter since the amount of called Ford didn’t seem to cover all the shrimp.  But I’ve had so many compliments on how good this shrimp recipe is that I’d be a fool not to keep it in my repertoire.  And we all definitely agreed it was the PERFECT shrimp recipe for a surf and turf alongside a thick beautiful steak!
