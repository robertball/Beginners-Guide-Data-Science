YUM! We like things spicy so I used 1 tsp each of hot and mild curry.  I also added 1 tbsp of coriander seeds thanks to suggestions from the reviews AND, as also suggested, I did not use all the liquid or it definitely would have been too soupy.  I put in my food processor and added the liquid a little at a time until I got a good, thick dip consistency.  I think I ony used half of the reserved liquid.  And I also added a little onion salt.  It's a good recipe to play with and make your own but is it good? YES!

This recipe was ok for me, although I altered it a little.  I had had a leftover lentil salad that didn't go over real well with my boyfriend, so this was a great way to do something with the leftovers (plus it took less than 10 minutes to make).  The mixture was a little thick for my blender, so I dribbled in some chicken stock to thin it out a little.  I also added more cumin than the recipe called for because I love cumin so much, and I added a bit more garlic.  My girlfriends loved it and so did I.  I also got rid of the leftover lentil salad without having to throw it out and waste it!

This dip is delicious.  I followed the recipe fairly closely, only using olive oil instead of vegetable and making a crushed red chili pepper/paprika substitution for the cayenne pepper, as I didn't have any.  I did not add salt (nor would I say it needs any) and used all the liquid.  I tried the dip after mixing it all together and felt it wasn't quite what I wanted.  I added about a teaspoon of lemon juice and that did it for me.  Who needs chips?  I could eat this with a spoon!  Four stars for the dip before the lemon juice, five for easy prep and with the difference the lemon juice made.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe, Noni!

This was only ok.  Luckily I made a small batch because my husband didn't like it at all.

I liked this a lot, although my husband didn't seem too keen on it.  You will probably want to add salt.  I added at least 1 teaspoon.

I'm a fan of Indian food, so I tried this recipe.  Wow, what a disappointment.  It was terrible!  The taste was really yucky -- just tastes like very plain lentils with a tingle from the spices.  I stirred in some salt to help it out, but it didn't help much.  The appearance of the dip is completely unappetizing.  It's a kind of yellowish, greenish goop.  I made it for a potluck and it was virtually untouched.  I sure won't be making this again.

I already had a batch of cooked lentils so I sauted the spices with the onion, added some of the lentil cooking liquid and then threw it all in the food processor. I had to add 1/2 tsp of salt then it was delicious! I will definitely make this again.

Noni!!!I was looking for a recipe just like this one, and am I ever glad I found it!I used Umbrian brown lentils and olive oil,and, in addition to your recipe,added: 1 tsp toasted coriander seeds,half a cube veggie bouillion,Hungarian hot paprika,and cooked the lentils with a bay leaf.I used lots of the cooking stock to thin the spread, as it was plenty thick.
Unbelievably good, I had it with my lentil soup and homemade buckewheat sourdough bread...sneaking back to get more sourdough and dip!!!It makes a fantastic sandwich filling! I will be making this as a staple in my fridge from this moment on.

Very good, like a Mediterranean guacamole!  I had 2 cups of steamed lentils already on hand, so my preparation varied from the recipe.  Like another reviewer, I saut√©ed a chopped onion for 5 minutes in veg. oil, added the spices and cooked for another 2 minutes, then added 4 cloves of minced garlic for the final minute.  Cut back a bit on the cayenne and added 1/2 tsp of salt, 1.5 tsp ground coriander and a dash of ground ginger in the spice mixture.  Combined everything in a blender and added chicken broth... you may want 1 to 1.5 cups depending on the consistency you're after.  Let it chill and the spices soak in.

This recipe is turned out pretty well, ONLY after I altered it.  I followed all of the measurements and cooking instructions exactly, but I was left with really bland tasting goop.  So, I added: just under 1 tbsp of fresh lemon juice, a bunch of sea salt, and another 1 tsp of curry.  Now it's delicious!

I made this for my book club tonight and everyone really liked it. Like many reviewers, I also added salt. I did not have a problem with it being too soupy and was going to reserve the water but didn't need to. The only thing I added that I didn't see anyone else use, was a dash of ground ginger, which went very nicely with this. I am definitely going to make this healthy dip again!

This recipe turned out very well. It is a little spicy for me so next time I will cut down on the cayenne but that is a preference thing. I had no trouble with having too much liquid as some reviewers did. In fact after cooking the lentils I had to add more water to smooth out the dip to a lighter consistency..

Love it!  Great recipe, and very easy to make.  Although the adjustments I made upped it to 5 stars, it's a good recipe as is.  I preferred to add a little salt, and I threw it all in the blender instead of stirring whole seeds into my dip.  I wanted something super smooth and very low fat, and this fits the bill!  I tripled the recipe, leaving the cayenne at the same amount, as well as the oil, and it worked beautifully.  It's got just enough spice and a nice hint of heat that my children approve of.  This is definitely a keeper.

Delicious!  The water amount was perfect for me, but I did use a fairly large pot to boil it in which helped the evaporation.  I ran out of curry powder, so I used garam masala and paprika instead. I used olive oil and added a little bit of salt.  Next time I'll try it as written with curry powder (although the substitution was tasty!)and I may add some chopped, fresh tomato.  This dip is fantastic on celery and carrot sticks and any kind of bread product!!  What a healthy snack!  I'm almost through my first batch and will probably make more tomorrow.

This dish never found it's way to the table but promptly to the trash can! I gave myself a birthday party where I featured all international cuisine.  I got some great recipes from you guys...lucky for me I had a pretty big selection of food. At first I thought it was me, but I had a few friends taste it,...they didn't even SWALLOW! ...Sorry, Noni....

It was quite bland before I added about a tablespoon of brown sugar and at least a teaspoon of salt. With these additions it was good.  I also added crushed whole coriander along with the cumin.

Be sure to RINSE the lentils first.  I have a blue bazillion pounds of red lentils, and am always looking for ways to use them up.  This was wonderful!  Even the kidlets enjoyed it.  Also delicious as a spread.

Yum!
I used tinned brown lentils and skipped the onion and water step.
Didn't use oil and came up with a lovely thick consistency. 
Also added frozen peas after i blitzed it and a squeeze of lemon juice.
Delicious

This is pretty good. I used canned lentils (brown) and did not have any cayenne. I also added a bit more curry and garlic. Tastes better cold. Healthy too!

It was great and spicy but i substituted the cumin seed with sesame seeds and cumin powder and vegetable oil with 1 1/2 teaspoon olive oil. I like how the lentil taste with the spice kick.

We liked this recipe.  I added about a teaspoon of ground coriander, which added to the flavor a little.  I recommend draining the lentils a little before blending to make it less soupy.

A healty recipe with a great flavour, and a bit of spice.  The lentils may need a shorter or longer cooking time depending on the brand used, and draining and reserving the liquid probably isn't a bad idea either.  This smelled so good while I was making it that we started into it before our guests even arrived!

This is a keeper! I added a bouillon cube to the water when cooking the lentils and did not bother to mash them since they had already cooked down quite a bit. It did need a bit of salt, but it is good.  Maybe not as a dip, but I enjoy it as a light and easy meal with some bread (or just a spoon!).

I tried this recipe, and found it to be quite okay. I say this because I tried to do it in a rush, almost doubling the recipe, and eyeballing most of the measurments. All things considered, it was good! Next time, I'll be more careful in my measurements! My suggestions: Drain the water and hold it in reserve, that way you don't end up with spicy lentil soup - especially if you use canned lentils. I was going to give it 3 stars, but I'm going with 4, because I think it's growing on me! Well done, Noni!
