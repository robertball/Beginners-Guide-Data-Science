I am the poster of this recipe, and I just made this yesterday and tried to pay more attention to the measurements.  I would say I used about one cup of mayonnaise, not the 1/2 called for in the recipe.  I also did not drain any of the juice from the relish, just added the whole jar in.  And I only used 10 eggs (8 in the salad and 2 on top) and 1/2 of a medium purple onion.  If you use a food processor on the onion and olives it really saves a lot of time, and also helps cut down on the harshness of raw onion.  I also use the big holes on a cheese grater on the boiled eggs.  I really have never measured the stuff that goes into this before, so please feel free to eyeball it and adjust it to your own tastes!

Oh dear, I am sorry but I am gonna stretch here and give this 4 stars. First of all, I thought that there were too many eggs. I also thought that there was too much relish. I am used to making my macaroni salad the day before , therefore, I thought that this was dry. I did use a sweet yellow onion instead of red. Hubby liked the black olives, I hated them. I am going to go back to Amish Macaroni Salad . Thank you.

This was a hit at our last church potluck dinner.  All I brought home was the empty container.  The only changes I made were to use green olives instead of black and to add some chopped celery.  Even my husband who usually doesn't like macaroni salad requested that I make it at home so he could have a bigger serving.

Not bad, I did make a few changes. I left out the black olives, cut the recipe in half, used sweet relish (all I had on hand)and reduced the amount in half. I will definitely make again.

This makes a ton!  I used black and green olives for extra flavor.  And no boiled eggs on top just because I was serving 50 and it was too much work!  But I got lots of compliments and I've been eating the leftovers!  Delish!  This is my new regular for macaroni salad.  :-)

This is the recipe my mom always used.  She used sweet pickle relish and I prefer dill.  I also like to use pimento stuffed green olives.  It is even better the next day. Like the poster I always just eyeball the amount of mayo.  Thanks for posting this recipe as I always just did it from memory and can now print this out to give to others.

I was good, but I added more dressing because it was a little dry and some garlic salt for taste.  I also only used eight eggs total, five in the salad and three on top.  Next time I make it I will add some celery for extra crunch.

I made this for dinner, and my dad said it was the first time I hit dead on on everything I made. I personally thought it could have been more creamy, but my whole family really liked it. Very good!

This is a great recipe!  I omitted the red onion because I'm allergic and used white instead.  I also prefer to drain and rinse the relish.  I can definately over-indulge eating this!!  It's delish!!

This was a huge hit at my church's father/son picnic.  Even my dear husband who hates pickles couldn't get enough, in fact he finished it off.

I have made this several times now. Love the basically traditional mac salad made with dill relish. I make half batches then leave a little on the side without the black olives for the husband.

The first time I made this was A LOT of salad.  If taking something to a pot luck or family dinner I would recommend this.  If making for yourself or a side for dinner I would recommend cutting the receipe in half.  I did the second time and it made just enough.  The salad was really good and my fiance LOVED it.  This is a receipe I'll be putting in my receipe box.

Everyone loved this! I left out the black olives but added diced red peppers that I needed to use up. Delish & easily adaptable! Oh-I also added an extra 1/2 c mayo the next day-my preference. My hubby hates macaroni salad & he LOVED this one!

Reminds me of the Macaroni Salad that I grew up on with the exception of the Olives, Mustard & Pickle Relish , which I left out and finely chopped celery which I added in!!! In the future I am going to try it with the Black Olives, then Green Olives, then Pickle Relish, and maybe even the Mustard one time, which I have never liked the taste of in my Macaroni or Potato Salad. But hey, it has been a while and maybe with a good quality mustard in smaller quantity I might change my mind.
With the exception of those ingredients and the celery that I added. (the celery gives it a nice crunch and adds a little additional flavor) this salad is identical to what I ate every summer all of my life and really enjoyed every time. 
Try this salad, I think that you will like it!!!!

I don't care for macaroni salad as a rule, but I made this dish for our Memorial Day BBQ.  No big rave reviews from the crowd, but I liked it and so did my husband.  I read the review the original poster added and increased the mayo to 1 cup like she said and used all the juice from the relish.  I also added green olives. Thanks for a macaroni salad recipe that I actually like.

This was an amazing starter recipe. All the ingredients blend perfectly together and you can add according to your taste preferences. I personally added more relish and mustard and a little less onion. I'll use this every time I make macaroni salad going forward!

This was exactly what I was looking for.  A tasty basic macaroni salad that is just right to take to a party or picnic.  This one is delicious, colorful and feeds a crowd as promised.  I omitted the onion altogether, just because several of us don't care for it.

Ok I took my time rating this incredible salad. I've made it perhaps 20 times. I always use salad macaroni, both olives, sweet relish, double the mayo and add celery.  It would be made even more often if not for my waistline. Be wise make enough to provide leftovers or make the day before, it is like much better after a day in the fridge.

A new favorite at my house!!! I had a box of Shell Pasta that I used instead of Macaroni. I used 3/4 C Mayo and 3 Tbsp of mustard, plus I added a 1/4 C of Dill pickle juice and some Johnny's Seasoning Salt and regular black pepper to the sauce. I also did NOT drain the dill relish, I grated the whole dozen eggs and I added 1 1/2 C Shredded Cheddar! This salad TOTALLY ROCKS!!!!

The only thing I did was to add shredded carrots and sliced very thin celery. Other than adding those two ingredients I absolutely love this recipe.  The flavors all come together to make for a wonderful pasta salad for ANY occasion or just for the hell of making it... Thank you Crissy Soares!!!

All I did was cut the recipe in half because I was only making it for our family of 4.  I guess I did add more dressing.

I can't be more disappointed. All I can taste is the relish, that's it...I even added 3 more eggs and about another 1/2 cup of mayo and it's so gross....I hope it's better tomorrow when I have a house full of adults for lunch!

I made this and added celery, red beans, canned chicken and did not use the mustard.  I mixed the mayonnaise, relish, S&P together, added eggs, beans, celery, and macaroni. It turned out very good, better the next day for the garage sale.

tasted too much like a potato salad but with macaroni instead!
