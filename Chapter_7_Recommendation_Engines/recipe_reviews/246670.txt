Amazing!!! So good, my wife and I kept forgetting to take a breath between mouthfuls haha. I opted for less sugar (2 tbsp instead of 3), another dash of red pepper flakes, and about 2 chopped garlic cloves. cant wait to try this sauce on some chicken!

We had this at a local Thai restaurant and loved it.  I've ordered the Japanese salt which also is a tremendous flavor.  With this recipe kicked up, we can eat it at home.  Don't have a wok but love my grill pan!
