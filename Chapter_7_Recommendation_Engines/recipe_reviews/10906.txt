My husband requested "bars like school used to make" so despite to bad reviews I tried this one. It sounded the most like what they made. 
When you follow the recipe exactly the bar are literally like wet sand! Crumbly is not descriptive enough to say what happens to them. I put them in a container and the container looked like it had brown sugar in it, not bars. 

It is a good base for a recipe though, here is how to fix it, and not have the recipe be bland (the original has no peanut butter in the actual bar)

Use 1 cup brown sugar, AND one cup regular sugar.

Add the 1/2 cup peanut butter to the dough after creaming the shortening and sugar. 

Then add TWO eggs. Just one doesn't do it. 

Then follow everything else just like it says. With the few changes made these bars are fantastic! Hubby gave the original recipe a 5. (I had added extra sugar and peanut butter but followed everything else.) He gave the modified version a 10! 

This recipe is a good base, make a few minor changes like I said and it really is spectactular!

This is an excellent recipe with just a few changes. First I halved the recipe except used 2 eggs and 1 cup of white sugar. I used butter instead of shortening and self-rising flour instead of regular. I also upped the cooking time to 25 minutes. These were soooo good that icing was not needed. Try this. You will like it too!

I did not care for these, however my husband & son thought they were pretty good.  Way too greasy & too much Crisco for me.  Flavor wasn't bad, but I'd never make them again.

After baking the bars, they were way to salty, and did not hold together at all. It needed peanut butter added to the dough, because it tasted very bland. The icing proportions are way off - it was a runny mess. Too much milk maybe? I will not make this again.

Did I miss something in the recipe? My so-called dough was very crumble like and after baking it still seemed crumbley and almost raw. I followed directions correctly. Anyone with any help?? I really wanted these bars to turn out like I had in school. Suggestions please!

I made these for a pot luck, and they didn't get put out because someone had a peanut allergy.  I tried them when I got home and was relieved that no one ate them!  Really not good at all.  The base is just a tasteless vehicle for the topping.  A waste of ingredients.

This was exactly what I was looking for, and these are the same bars that I ate in school.  Very tasty, but there was enough frosting for two pans of bars with this recipe.  Thanks!

I took the advice of other readers and altered the recipe by adding one more egg and 1/2 cup peanut butter to the batter.  The bars turned out perfectly.  The frosting is great and this is definitely a recipe I will keep.

Very delicious with slight changes. I used 1/2 cup shortening and 1/2 cup butter, added 1/2 cup peanut butter and 1/4 cup less flour. I make this in an 8x8 pan so they are thick and a bit gooey. I've made them 3 times and they are extraordinary!! I made the icing as described in the original recipie because it's great. After cooking and cooling, I refrigerate the pan then heat each individual slice in the microwave for 12-15 seconds as we eat them.  The icing becomes room temperature. So yummy!!!!

The base, the frosting; too sweet. The end product came out looking like quicksand. Thick and wet, never solidified- not even in the fridge.

Don't waste your ingredients and time on this recipe--there is definately something missing.  I should have believed the other reviews.  They were crumbly and dense.
