Very good and easy to prepare. We also used 1 sliced onion instead of 4 small ones and omitted the orange juice. We'll be making it again.

Delicious! I had to cook the rabbit 2 hrs because I doubled the recipie. I served the thickened pan juices over angel hair pasta as in a previous post. I did not notice the wine at all, hardly, and I hate wine. This is a new favorite for my rabbit dishes. I bet the prep would work great in a slow cooker.

I did this as a slow cooker recipe and used a 3 1/2 lb rabbit.  I also used roasted garlic carvinal mustard and extra cup of water given the size of the rabbit.  It was excellent although I might use a milder mustard next time, the second day it was even better.  I cooked it 8 hrs on low in the slow cooker.

My whole family loved this recipe, We're on the low carb diet so I had to omit the orange, but it was great even without it! The only things I did different were to use a sliced onion instead of the whole onions. I also browned the onion and the rabbit pieces in the bacon drippings. I thickened the sauce with low carb thickener. Next time I might add a tablespoon or so of low carb orange marmalade to get that orange flavor. Great recipe!

To be honest, i have never tried rabbit before, so i was not sure what to expect. It was tough and chewy and realy hard to eat. The sauce was ok but i did not like the amount of wine in it. I might make this with chicken again with maybe just a touch of wine.

Great rabbit recipe!  I didn't have regular onion, so I diced 5 green onions.  Also added more bacon.  (You can never go wrong with more bacon!)  We didn't have angel hair pasta, but we put the sauce over white rice and it was very tasty!  I agree that this would probably also work in a slow cooker.  Will have to try it once the hubby goes hunting again!

I used lamb instead of rabbit and used the liquids in the pan to make a sauce for angel hair pasta.  For once I made a dinner that my husband loved!  He's usually the cook of the house.

awesome!  I had a sweet white almond wine and green onions...slow cooker for 7 hours on low-so I used 2 cups of wine.  About 1/2 # of bacon--cooked with half of the peeled orange and juiced the other half into the slow cooker.  Dijon mustard.  It fell apart it was so tender.  Great . Delicious.  Thank You!

A tasty, easy rabbit recipe. Personally I'd omit the bacon next time. I added some sage.

Made as written (added a sprig of fresh thyme) and will make again--this was my first (but not last) attempt at rabbit. However, I think next time I'll sear/brown the pieces in the oil first, on the stovetop, and then proceed with the rest of the recipe.

Very quick and easy preparation. I used red wine, no oranges and sliced onion. One hour in the oven was not enough. I left covered in the oven for 30 more min. It was ok at dinner. I was not too happy with meat tenderness and meat did not infuses flavor. I took leftover from dinner and put back in my still warm oven and let it stand there for few more hours until oven cool down.  Oh what a differens this made. Meat was juice and tender  and full of flavor. I was eating souce with a spoon like a soup, could not stop. So delicious. Will try to make it again and keep it in the oven longer from a beginning.

Okay so I didn't have white wine, used red; ran out of mustard, used ground mustard and a little water shaken up in empty mustard bottle; no oranges, so omitted them; threw all the ingredients in a slow cooker with a little bit of water and when I got home, smelled wonderful, I took some of the juice and made a gravy.  Very good!!  Next time I will try it following the recipe :)

This was so yummy, and super easy!  We loved the flavor, but ours turned out pretty tough.  I used two medium onions, quartered, half a cup of wine and half a cup of water (wife doesn't like a strong wine taste), and used a little orange juice instead of juice from a fresh orange.  As I said, we really loved the flavor, so I think next time we'll try the same recipe in the crock pot and see if that helps with the texture of the meat.
