I replaced the oil, sauce & past with Thai Peanut sauce (bottled)  & blended it with the peanut butter and the water for the drizzling over the salad.  We had it for lunch and it was excellent!  Would suggest it as a starter if having company for Asian ribs dinner!  We had a little sauce left and later had it with sliced apples!
