This recipe was great!  I cooked brown and wild rice together in chicken broth instead of using boxed stuff.  I also cut up 2 big pork chops instead of the chicken.  In a large saucepan I sauteed the onion in some butter and then added 2 cloves of crushed garlic and the pork, along with some herbs and spices.  I added 1/2 cup of white wine and simmered the pork until it was done.  Then I added two cans of cream of mushroom soup and simmered the mixture until the rice was done.  As soon as the rice was done, I added it to the pot.  I didn't bother with any cheese or bother putting it in a 9 x 13 pan and heating it up.  It was already plenty hot so I just served it right out of the large saucepan.  It was so good and easy.  Next time I will try it with chicken and some fresh mushrooms.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious! I couldn't stop eating it! As suggested by another reviewer, I sauteed the onion before adding to the rice mixture to give it a more subtle flavor. I used Cream of Chicken soup instead of Cream of Mushroom because of personal preference and I added some chopped broccoli. This was so easy to make, but it's nice enough for company, too. Thanks for a great recipe!

My husband asked if I could make this once a week!  I added chopped broccoli and didn't use onion (I HATE onions). I also topped with bread crumbs and a little more cheese then called for. It was wonderful!

This chicken & rice casserole is delicious. It would be even better with some bacon bits and sour cream. I will definitely make it again because it disappeared when it was put on the table!

tasty and easy! it's a very open recipe you could add more to it if you wanted, we added green beans and we think that green chiles and fresh mushrooms would've made it super! I would also suggest more cream of mushroom soup, just enought o make it a little more creamy and not too runny. I also used more cheese which held it together alot better.

A very nice casserole.  I adjusted the amount to serve 5, and it made a great deal.  I used precooked deli chicken breast, but cooked the rice in stock and wine.  I also added slivered water chestnuts to lighten the texture.  All in all, very kind, subtle flavors, suitable for the whole family.

Some wonderful add-ins for this recipe are frozen green beans and sliced water chestnuts.  We make this casserole where I work and always have great reviews.

I made this for my husband's entire family while we were all on vacation together this summer and the meal got rave reviews! Everyone asked for the recipe. I doubled the cheese, did not use pimentos, and only used half the onion suggested. It's a quick, easy dish to make and very filling. It's now one of my husband's favorites.

This is really good.  I did add the green beans and more cheese as suggested by others.  I made it last night and we are having it for lunch today, it was that good.

It was all really good except for the raw onions. Next time I will either saute them or eliminate them all together. Other than that it was great.

Loved the flavor!  It was a great quick meal.  Definitely going to keep this recipe handy.  My little adjustments that I made were:  I used a pre-flavored marinated chicken for added flavor (slow roasted garlic & herb) and a can of cream of chicken & mushroom mix soup instead of just the chicken.

It was easy, tasty, and cheap.  I cut up 3 chix breast and cooked on stove top with just a tad olive oil.  Then sauted onions and brocolli.  Combined everything (minus pimintos don't like them) and baked. I only used about a quarter cup for cheese to sprinkle on the top...trying to cut down on the calories.

I love wild rice, so this recipe appealed to me.  It was really great!  I was out of cream of mushroom soup, so I used cream of celery instead.  Also, I did not add pimentos or onion.  It still was fabulous!  My husband even liked it and went back for seconds.

So easy, but so delicious.
I made this for my housemates and they raved about it for days afterward. Now I make it all the time! I don't like pimentos though, so I don't use them. I also add the onions to the chicken when it's almost done cooking, to soften them up a bit and get some of the flavor into the chicken.

I made this casserole last night for dinner and my husband loved it. I did make a few changes though, so the recipe will get 4 stars. I used brown rice because that's all I had around and increased the cheese to 1 1/2 cups. I also used a green bell pepper instead of pimiento's. For the chicken, I added poultry seasoning and cooked it in olive oil. I also added some garlic salt/pepper before putting the dish in the oven. We like spicy/well-seasoned foods and it tasted a little blah without these things. My husband loved it, and he's a chicken connoisseur so it must be pretty good.

I loved this! It was easy to make and delicious. My daughter enjoyed it too. I did substitute 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder, since she doesn't like the texture of onions. It made a lot of food for a little money. I will definitely make this again!

Yummy! Even though I cooked the wild rice per the directions it was still a little hard... Next time I will 'over cook' the wild rice.  Other than that this was really tasty.

I had pulled some canned chicken, cream of mushroom, and pre-cooked wild rice out of the pantry with a mission to make dinner.  Found this recipe and went for it.  I didn't have any pimentos, but I don't care for them anyway, so I just skipped that.  I used half of a red onion that I had, and I think if you're going to use a red onion-- and probably with a white onion too-- you definitely need to saute it before putting everything together.  Mine was way too onion-y.

At the suggestion of another reviewer, I opted to skip using the oven on a hot summer night and just heated it in a saucepan, and I added a little garlic.  If it hadn't been so onion-strong, it would have turned out perfectly.  This definitely makes a good base that you can run with, and with canned chicken & pre-cooked rice, it can make a great hearty dinner in about 10 minutes.

I used plain organic wild rice instead of the prepackaged kind and boiled it in low sodium chicken broth. This dish was creamy and easy to make but lacked a little something. I'll make it again and see if I can figure out what it needs to make it five stars for me and my husband.

I subbed water chestnuts for the pimientos. This was delicious! I put all the cheese mixed in and none on top. I only used one box of wild rice and it was still enough.

Pretty good. I used chicken stock in place of water for the wild rice, and per others' recommendations, sautéed the onion first.

Enjoyed this one quite a bit - good combination of textures and flavors with the addition of the mild peppers. I prepped mine the night before, and so think it had a little too much time to soak up the sauce so it was  a little bit on the dry side but I enjoyed it. Went  well with a green bean casserole.

I'm sorry, but I didn't think this was anything to write home about. My husband said he would be happier with his wild rice & a chicken breast on the side. I think I would use minced onion next time rather than putting your onion in b/c it didn't have as much time to get soft as I like.

The best part about this recipe is it's versatility.  Like others have said, you can add or omit at will and still shine in the end.  I don't like pimentos, so I omitted them.  But I had three slices of bacon in the fridge and thought I'd use them up - it was a nice addition - so was the broccoli.  White wine would be wonderful too. 

 It's great to have something else to make with leftover chicken. It’s a lovely dish. I look forward to having this one again.
