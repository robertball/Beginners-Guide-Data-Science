The recipe said to pour the batter; this batter did not pour it was very thick; had to be spooned in the tube pan. I wondered if a liquid ingredient had been left out of the recipe.
It seems it should have been very moist using sour cream, but instead it was dry. I was dissappointed and felt bad as I had made it special for my daughter in law who loves cinnamon coffee cake.

This is one of the best and simplest coffee cake recipes I've ever made. It's easy to put together and bakes up very nicely. I used butter flavored shortening since I had it on hand and followed the directions exactly. The batter is very thick and needs to be spooned into the pan rather than poured. The addition of the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture on top of the final addition of batter makes for a slightly crunchy exterior and moist, tender interior. I checked the cake after 40 minutes and it was still very under-done. After 10 more minutes the toothpick came out clean. The cake turned out beautifully after a 10 minute rest and it smelled heavenly. It's delicious, and I'll definitely be making this one again!

The batter of this cake was not at all pourable and was kinda difficult to get spread into the pan. Other than that I thought the outcome of the cake was very moist and delicious. I am literally sitting here and eating it right now as I write this review. The only thing that I changed on this recipe is that I used cake flour instead of all-purpose flour. I feel that all-purpose flour is more heavy than cake flour and a cake made with all-purpose flour tends to be more dry.

I loved this cake! I did add a few shakes of nutmeg to the batter which gave it a wonderful little tweak. Yes, the batter is thick to pour, but I just used a rubber spatula and it was fine. I used light sour cream to cut down on the calories and it worked great. I also think that using just a little less cinnamon would be good. I felt the cinnamon flavor was a bit strong. This is now my go-to recipe!

This coffee cake is amazing! Super moist, easy to throw together... I made one small change and added a bit of cinnamon in the batter. This was a huge hit in my house, a "keeper" I will make often! Thanks for the recipe... I also did a quick glaze to cover the cake... Yum!

Thanks, Anne, this is a great recipe.  I needed something impressive to take to a BBQ on short notice and this filled the bill perfectly.  I had to substitute FF Greek yogurt for the sour cream, but you would never know the difference.  I also don't have a 10" tube pan so I used a 9" bundt.  It just fit, whew!  Instead of greasing and flouring the pan, I sprayed it with butter flavor no stick and dusted it with about 1/3 of the brown sugar cinnamon mix.  I used most of the rest inside the cake and just dusted a small amount over the top.  It baked up moist and delicious, but not too sweet, in 50 minutes.  I'm happy to report there wasn't a crumb left.

This was my first attempt at making a cinnamon cake.  I didn't have all the ingredients so I substituted butter with light olive oil, brown & white sugar with raw sugar and sour cream with plain yoghurt.  It was quick and easy to make and delicious!  Thanks

Made some changes suggested by reviewers: added a teaspoon of nutmeg to the batter, used cake flour instead of all-purpose, and substituted butter for the shortening and 2%Greek yogurt for the sour cream.. Oh .... and I added two chopped Mackintosh apples to the cinnamon mix.  Pretty good; would probably add some walnuts to the apple/cinnamon mix next time.

I made the recipe exactly as directed at it was very good.  I found the cinnamon mixture to be perfect in flavor and quantity.  The cake was moist and tender, but I think it could use a little something more and will either mix in some fresh nutmeg, as another reviewer suggested, or a little bit of cinnamon into the batter.

This is such a nice moist easy cake! I only made one change though, I thought I had sour cream in the house only to find there wasn't any. Just as I was wondering what to do I noticed my container of coconut yogurt and thought why not lol The cake is so delicious with just that subtle hint of coconut flavor. I may do that again on purpose next time its soo good! lol

Very Delicious! I made mine into muffins, and just watched the baking time. They came out very moist. I added about a 1/2c fat free half n half and used Allspice in the cinnimmon/sugar mixture. It was great!

Disclosure: I'm breaking the cardinal rule and rating based on the variations I made to this recipe. Can't believe how deliciously moist it turned out! I had to use up a little bit of sour cream and some vanilla yogurt - even using both I only had about half the amount called for by the recipe, so I halved everything. Besides using half sour cream, half vanilla yogurt for the sour cream, I added about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the wet batter. I also added a half teaspoon of nutmeg and some pecans to the topping. As others have noted, the batter is not pourable, but I easily spooned it in with a spatula. At 350, a half recipe took me 35 mins to bake. So good!

Very pleased. Made small adjustments based on the very helpful reviews. My husband wanted a moist coffee cake that was very full of cinnamon. I used butter, sour cream and vanilla yogurt mixed together, I do not own a Tube pan so I split the batter up between my 9.5” nonstick loaf pan and a 9” nonstick pie pan. I didn’t use all of the brown sugar and cinnamon because it looked like a lot but I should have by putting a lot of it in the batter than putting rest on top of the batter before baking. I baked the pans separately. The loaf pan at 350 was done in 28 minutes and the 9” pie pan was done in 30 min. I just tasted a slice from my loaf pan and I was very happy that it was NOT dry or crumbly. We will be keeping this recipe.

I made a few changes, 2 on purpose, and 1 by accident.  Intentionally, I used butter for the shortening, and added chopped pecans to the cinnamon swirl.  By mistake, I mixed the brown sugar into the batter, so I had to use more for the swirl.  I was worried about how this would turn out, but it was delicious!! So good, in fact, that there wasn't a crumb left over! Can't wait to make it again.

This was excellent.  My 13 year old made it and it was delicious.  We did use butter instead of shortening but did not change anything else.

This is a tried and true favorite recipe that has been around for awhile but have never never used shortening. Someone complained about it being dry and that might be the cause.  Granted shortening makes for a lighter textured cake but does not have the taste of butter.  Or you can use half butter and half shortening but not all shortening.

Anyway, I made this following the recipe to the letter. It was somewhat crunchy-good on top, but the center cinnamon sugar layer disappeared and the bottom had a thick crust on it. Was just a bit dense and not flavorful enough. My kids didn't really like it, and that sort of says it all.

This reminded me of the coffee cake my Mom used to make several years ago.  I doubled the cinammon mixture and added chopped pecans to it.  I put a layer of cinammon mixture in the bottom of my bundt pan and then proceeded with the layering as noted.  The recipe states to "pour" the batter into the pan, but my batter was not pourable.  It had to be spooned into the pan.  This had me wondering how it was going to turn out, but it was great!  Mine was done at 45 min.  This cake is best served warm, IMHO.  Thanks for the great recipe, WHITCOMBE!
