I've been making this recipe for years.  I love the unusual combination of flavors.  I add a full can of sauerkraut (I never know what to do with what is left over anyway) and to make this a soup for my meat eating husband, I added sliced smoked sausage.  It goes really well with rye bread--especially if you make cro√ªtons to put in the soup.

This is so unusual and GOOD! I don't rewrite other folk's recipes on here, I follow them as written if I'm going to rate them. I did have to make an adjustment on this by using white instead of wheat flour because I wasn't going to buy a bag of wheat flour for just 2T to use in this recipe. (I don't like the texture of wheat). I can't imagine it making a big enough difference to matter. This is just so different and delicious on this chilly day!!!

Strong flavors...not a soup for every day, but great when you're tired of chili and chicken noodle.  I made this with soy sour cream and rice flour for my wheat/dairy free husband and added carrots.  Use lots of dill, it goes will with the sauerkraut and leaves pretty green flecks everywhere.  Also great with swiss cheese grated on top.

I thought this was quite nice, we absolutely loved the sauerkraut in there - not something you often use in soup. It went really well with the green beans, and along with the sour cream and dill it gave the soup a nice fresh taste. My only problem is that with the addition of flour it came out too thick and stewy for us. I reckon the starch in the potatoes would thicken the soup enough. I'll remember that next time I make this.

Very nice soup, a clove of garlic (minced)is a good addition or alternatively some garlic powder. I made it for the first time today and it turned out a little salty (I didn't add any salt but the juice of the souerkraut was maybe too much...) Will make it again and will watch for the saltiness.

I was really looking forward to this soup but sort of dissapointed :(
It took alot of work! Cutting the potatoes, onions, green beans, dill, carrots (I added). And all the steps to cook it all...and after all that, the flavor just didn't excite. It looks wonderful and is full of fresh veggies and herbs, so I ate it, but it was the few dashes of hot sauce that made it worth eating. It's a great idea for a soup but just not crazy with the flavor. Either it's missing something or my American taste buds just can't appreciate this foreign recipe. I wish I felt differently. My husband wouldn't eat it, he felt even more strongly against the flavor than I did. At least my mom liked it enough to take it off my hands because it was ALOT of effort and I didn't want it to go to waste.

I really enjoyed this soup. MY SON enjoyed this soup and he is a very picky eater. I shared this recipe with my neighbor and her family loved it as well. This one is a keeper for sure.
Thank you

this is SUPER!  it's so good and so easy!  because i live in a house with men who apparently can't fill up a dinner without meat, i did as others suggested and used some smoked sausage.  the sausage, the kraut, and the dill were just great together.  the boys loved it and so did i.  this is a keeper!

Excellent! All the flavors really work together and make this a tasty, unique soup. The broth is delicious with that tang from the sauerkraut. Only changes were to add fresh garlic and mushrooms and a little skim milk. Thanks! :)

This soup is hearty and delish. If you're scared of adding sauerkraut, then just cut up some fresh cabbage and it will be just as delicious. Don't forget the dill!

I REALLY wanted to love this soup because I LOVE all of the ingredients.  I didn't ~ I can't actually say it is bad because we ate it for dinner but I can't say it was good either.  I tried to think of it as if I was at at restaurant ... Would I order it again?  Most likely not.  Sorry!!

I love to try new things so I thought why not give this recipe a try? It smelled delicious and looked delicious but I just was not a fan at all. I know for a fact when my husband gets home he is not going to be happy with it either. I have two boys who aren't picky eaters and they disliked it as well. I do want to thank you for sharing your recipe though. I'm glad so many others enjoyed it but def is something I will not make again.

Very tasty! I ended up using the full can of sauerkraut and added carrots and portabella mushrooms. Don't skip the sauerkraut..it adds its own demention.  For the men..I add some smoked sausage for a heartier meal.  Serve with some good rye bread.

I addes carrots, celery, and mushrooms and like one of the other reviews, I used the whole can of kraut. This was a very fresh tasting soup and didn't take long to prepare. The only thing I will do differently next time is not cook the potatoes as long as the recipe calls for because they ended up a little too mushy for me. This is a very unique and great tasting soup!

Excellent! I made the recipe as is. I added about a cup of diced cooked ham to it ONLY because I had it left over from the day before. If some of you think it's too sour, add a couple of teaspoons of sugar to it. My hubby adds vinegar to almost every kind of soup I make so this will be one of his favorites! Thanks Idealnut, you made his day.

I made this tonight and definitely overate as I had 2 bowls. I find this a truely addictive soup. I do not think that it would be the same with canned beans so would recommend that if fresh is not available use frozen but I think fresh is best. Thank you for the recipe, this will be a new go to comfort soup.

Printed this recipe out last winter in anticipation of fresh green beans from the garden.  Why did I wait so long???  Made last night (after picking 8 oz. of beans in 100 degree sun) and followed the directions to the T (very unusual for me).  This needs absolutely no changes.  Hubby and I both loved and will add to our regular rotaton with emphasis on these summer beans.

This was a great weeknight meal.  I added any leftover veggies I had in the fridge!  A carrot and a bit of celery.  I didn't have saurkraut or dill, but it was great without it!  

Add the sour cream and flour seperatly! And add more water/broth.

I made it exactly like the recipe and found this soup to be too tangy. I guess it was the sauerkraut. I will not be making it again.

I love this soup. I was kinda freaked out about adding the sauerkraut, not usually a fan, but it's what makes the soup IMO.  I didn't have any fresh dill so I used approx. 1 tsp. of dried. Also, I had frozen organic green beans that I just broke into pieces and I thought it worked great. Served with buttermilk biscuits, which went perfectly cuz of the slight tang from the buttermilk. Will be making this soup ALL winter!

My boyfriend and I loved this soup. The only thing I did differently is add some cooked bacon left over from breakfast and a little extra sauerkraut and dill, also lots of ground black pepper. I will be making this one again and again! Thank you for the recipe.

Excellent soup.  Proportions were perfect for may palate in any case.  Tangy and very savory.  Would go well with perhaps a poached fish lightly garnished.

My husband and I absolutely loved this soup - It's my new favourite soup!! I've made it twice so far, exactly as stated, and we both went back for seconds! I made sure to get fresh green beans and chop them up - Not sure how canned or frozen would taste.

This soup was just right with about 1/2 lb. andouille sausage I had left over.  That gave it some punch.  Very good soup!

Stir flour into sour cream WELL.  I didn't mix mine enough and when I stirred the cream/flour mix into the soup, it lumped up and so I had to scoop out the lumps and mash them through a sieve.  My son thought it was missing something so I followed the suggestion of a reviewer and chopped kielbasa into his and he loved it.  Go easy on the kraut juice as this may make it too salty/sour.  Also, the dill looks pretty but my boys don't like it at all so replaced that with green onion. Overall very tasty with strong sour/salty flavors which I love but may not be for everyone.

This soup is a great entree for "meatless Monday".  I added carrots, garlic, and a little leftover vegetable medley.  I served it with rye bread.  My husband and son gave the recipe a "thumbs up" as did I.

If you like sauerkraut, then go for it! Otherwise, probably won't be a new favorite. I really enjoyed this soup, nobody else I was feeding went for it though...

Fantastic! I made this for my parents and they both went back for seconds! I wasn't sure how the sauerkraut would be since I've never had any before, but it tasted great. It wasn't too strong, but you definitely know it's in there - in a good way. And the fresh dill makes all the difference. I set out to make this recipe as is but ended up experimenting a little for extra fun. Boiled the potatoes in a separate pot for a few minutes while sauteing the onions and green beans with a dash of turmeric and garlic; when potatoes were starting to get tender, I drained them, sprinkled them with thyme and turmeric, and let them sit for a few minutes. Then added the onions, green beans, and some mushrooms to the pot with the potatoes and followed the rest of the directions on the recipe. Served with hot pumpernickel bread. Will definitely make this again. Thanks Idealnut!

Utterly Wonderful ..... AFTER adjusting seasonings with sugar, salt, pepper, and since I oopsed with too much sugar, a touch more kraut brine...., AND AFTER succumbing to the omnivore in our family and thereby adding half a pound of smoked turkey sausage per recipe (we used a whole pound since we doubled the recipe).  The sausage was sliced about 1/4" thick and each slice cut in quarters.  The small'sh bits then did not at any time overpower the soup, but merely complimented it tremendously well.  Tried making this in the crockpot, and still tasted wonderful except that we didn't get the soup to thicken.  We had tried stirring the flour into the sour cream right after putting the other ingredients into the crock pot, then storing both together in a saucepan in the fridge.  Shortly before serving, we added some broth to the sour cream mixture, brought it to a boil and it was as thick as could be until we stirred it into the soup.  The soup remained completely unthickened, but the sour cream was a nice touch anyway.  Will likely try a non-dairy variety next time (used low fat sour cream this time).  Served with blinis and smoked salmon.  Leftovers were nice to have around, so we were glad to have doubled the recipe. ---  Next time will possibly leave thin, cook on the stove top, transfer to the stovetop to thicken, will add extra potatoes at the beginning in order to blend in some of them, or will simply add some instant potato flakes at the end to thicken slightly.

I wasn't so sure about this on my first bowl, fresh out of the pot. But honestly, the longer it has sat in my fridge, the better it is tasting (flavors are melding, perhaps?) and now I really like it. 
 I made a couple minor changes: used all purpose instread of red potatoes, regular instead of whole wheat flour, and about a tablespoon of dried dill instead of fresh.

From my 3 teenagers - one gave it a 3, one a 4, and one a 5!  The only modification I made was to add some cubed leftover ham.  That with the sauerkraut made it too salty for the 15 year old palette.  The 17 year old just wasn't impressed and wanted more "flavor."  The 19 year old thought the soup was perfect and gave it the 5 stars!  Mom thought it was a nice change of pace and rather enjoyed it.

After a trip to the farmer's market left me with more new potatoes and green beans than I knew what to do with, this recipe was my saving grace. I had almost everything on hand but the sauerkrat and fresh dill and it all came together beautifully!  I'm no culinary expert, but my roommates who tried this sure couldn't tell. They ate so many bowls I was really worried I wouldn't have leftovers (I was counting on this pot of soup lasting me through the week!). It hits the spot on a cold day, lemme tell ya!  I added tons of black pepper to really give it some flavor (which was a bit lacking before the salt and pepper, perhaps because I used light sour cream and veggie stock).  I plan to make this soup again this week. It's easy, keeps well, and costs hardly anything at all. Plus, how am I gonna get rid of all this fresh dill otherwise?!

I made this soup for my Russian husband and Father-in-law. Both agreed they had never seen this type of soup in Russia, but we all liked it anyway. The only thing i did differently was add 2 carrots, 2 more cups of broth, and left out the dill (my husband is not a fan). The next day i added crumbled bacon on top, per my husband's request, and it was even better! Great recipe!

I rate this among the best recipes I've made from the site. The only change I made was to add two tablespoons of butter. It was great with cornbread. We're going to try adding sausage -- maybe.

Well...I really wanted to like this soup and in theory I should have since I like all the ingredients separately. Together, however...not so much. No one else cared for it, either. Maybe we're just not adventurous enough?

Just made this soup on the first cold autumn day, and boy did it go over well in my household!!  The strange combination of ingredients had me intrigued, and since I love sourkraut I wanted to try it (I am pregnant and like sour stuff more than usual).  It was really really really good!!  I added 8 cups of broth (4 chicken and 4 beef) and was glad I did.  Otherwise my version would have had no liquid.  I also added an entire can of sourkraut per someone suggestion and it was great.  Added tons of fresh dill.....just kept adding until I thought it was enough.  Defintitely more than 1 tbls.  If you like unique flavors, this soup is for you!!

This reminds me of soup my grandmother made for my German grandfather who was born in Russia.  My husband and I really enjoyed it on this cold rainy night.  As other reviewers did, I added the whole can of saurkraut.  I used vegetable and chicken broth as I didn't have enough of either one.  I plan to add a little smoked sausage when I serve the leftovers.

Wow! So yummy! My mom used to make a variation of this green bean soup (we have Slovak & Russian heritage).  This version is very interesting and absolutely delicious!  Modifications - added fresh mushrooms that i sauteed with the onions (because i had them on hand), and basically adjusted the ingredient quantities to fit my giant soup pot.  I was very hesitant to add the dill because usually the only place I like it is in pickles :)  I decided to add only about a teaspoon, and I'm really glad I did.  I know a lot of reviewers liked the dill, but if i would have put the entire tablespoon it would have ruined the dish for me.  If you are on the fence about the dill, i'd say skip it.  It's really good with just a little or none at all.  Next time I don't plan on adding it.

OMG! It didn't sound very appetizing to my mom but I really wanted to try it. It was awesome! I made a huge pot and ate all of it in 2 days! Oh, I think it needs carrots and red pepper.

To me, this is a strange combination of food.  I loved it.  The only thing I changed was: I added 1 carrot & used canned green beans rinsed & chopped up.

This was an excellent soup!! The only change I made was to add minced garlic in with the onions. I added only the recommended amount of sauerkraut, but when I tried it, I wished I had put in the whole can! It was awesome!! You could easily put in more veggies, meat, whatever, and make it your own!

Closely followed the recipe. Had to substitute 1 tablespoon dried dill for the fresh, and substituted frozen green beans for fresh. Otherwise followed the recipe. Served with crusty bread and old cheddar cheese on the side. My husband and I really liked this recipe, and we will make it again. Thank you for a real keeper!

I was quite intrigued by this recipe. I love trying Russia recipes.  When I first tried it after it was finish cooking, I thought it was just okay. However, I took it for lunch and I thought it was fantastic. The only changes was veggie broth and dried dill. Yummy

I liked how the dish itself wasn't too hard to prepare, save chopping everything up. I didn't end up adding the sauerkraut and I thought it was a little bland. Going to try it with next time.

This one of our perennial favorites. I must admit that  years ago I added another ingredient...smoked sausage! Great either way but everyone loves the fresh smoked sausage in the soup ad it makes for a very hearty winter soup.  Delicious!!!

Tasty and easy soup with a lot of flavor. I added potatoes to thicken the soup instead of the flour since my husband is gluten sensitive and extra sauerkraut.

I have made this soup many times and we just love it. I make it exactly the way it is written. My wife is from Russia and asks me to make this on cold days. Today will be one of those days. The people who didn't like this soup obviously made a mistake somewhere. I don't understand how a whole family could dislike this. Thanks!!!

No complaints about being bland. It has a very distinct pickle and sauerkraut flavor.

This soup is quite unusual, but very good. I liked the combination of ingrediens, but I would have used less onion.  Also don't be afraid to add dill (and even a lot of dill), because it's great for soups!

I really enjoyed this soup. Very different. I love all the ingredients. I used dried dill because I didn't have fresh. I also used the whole can of sauerkraut. I used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I think this soup will be even better the next day after the flavors meld.... I will make it again. Yummmm.

This soup was really delicious! My husband and I both liked the unique taste. I used dried dill from our organic food coop and the taste was superb. I think next time I will try adding bacon or ham.

Wonderful and unique mix of flavors. I added a 1/2 cup of mushrooms and used dry dill and the soup turned out great. Next time I'll add more mushrooms, more onion, and maybe some sweet sausage and sweet paprika.

Just made this wonderful soup - excellent flavor.  Substituted Greek yogurt for sour cream, 1 tsp dried dill for the fresh and added red cabbage (turns soup purple).  I made a double batch so I will try adding the turkey sausage suggested in some of the other reviews.  Next batch I make, I will add more potatoes.

A hearty and satisfying soup for the winter.  Used fresh green beans but frozen or canned could be substituted.  I also sauteed one large chicken breast (chopped into bite sized pieces) with the onion which my husband liked.  I think it might also be good with chunks of ham. Wheat or white flour works with this recipe if you don't have wheat.  The sauerkraut and dill give it a very full flavor and the potatoes make it more like a meal.  Creamy and delicious!  I'm definitely keeping this one in my repertoire of soup recipes.

I loved it, as did my Polish mother in law. Husband hated it, but only because he doesn't like saurkrout. If you like the ingredients in this soup, I doubt you'll be disappointed.

This is simply marvelous. I adored it and so did my adult family. Not so sure it'd be for young kids. I didnt alter the recipee except to add some lean, organic sausage for the carnivores in the family. They said it was awesome.

What a delicious fall soup!!!!!   I added smoked sausage so it was more like a stew. Used the whole 14oz can of saurkraut and 49.5oz can of chicken broth. Didn't want to waste.  Also used white flour instead of wheat. Didn't want to buy a whole bag of Wheat flour for one recipe. I will definitely make this again!

Made this exactly as written and it was delicious. I used chicken stock. I am going to add beef sausage in the leftover soup and try that too! I have never had this type of soup before I really enjoyed the flavors! Thank you for submitting this recipe.

Sooooo good.  I doubled the recipe from the start hoping it would be as good as I thought and it was.  I added fresh green beans and fresh blackeyed peas.  Very tasty!  (I didn't have any dill so I added pickle juice)

This soup is very good.  Wonderful for a cold night with some warm bread.  The only thing I did different was to add smoked sausage cut into rings.  I left the peel on the red potato's.  It was pretty and nutritious.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it was wonderful.  Well worth your trying....

My family was skeptical of the sauerkraut, but based on the reviews, I decided to make it anyway. I am so glad I did! I made it exactly as written, (doubled) except for 1 tsp. dried dill rather than fresh. The flavor reminded me of a German potato salad, but a soup. Delicious! And- my whole family loved it too.  :)

Absolutely wonderful! We added celery, carrots and zucchini, threw it all in the crockpot and cooked on low for 8 hours. At hour 7, added the flour and sour cream. Next time, will add some Italian sausage.

Made this soup for dinner last night.  It was a HUGE hit.  Even my husband loved it and he is not a soup fan.  To accommodate him, I added diced smoked sausage to the party when I added the potatoes and green beans.  Also, for his benefit, I added about a 1/4 cup of heavy cream which made it more stew like.  But the flavors are phenomenal and it still would have been delicious without those two additions.  Thank you for sharing.

Me and my husband loved this soup! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderfully, very tasty. The flavors in this soup are very typical of Eastern European soups and stews. This will become a new staple in our monthly menu!

Loved it!! Only change based on others' input....3 cloves of garlic minced in with the onion. Added frozen corn and fresh sliced mushrooms to pot after potatoes and green beans. Used the required amount of saurkraut but more fresh dill (5-6 tablespoons)
