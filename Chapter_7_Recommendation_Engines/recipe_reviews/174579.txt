I love this. I made it the first time just like the recipe. It was great to dip pitas and veggies in. 
I made it a second time and added a bunch of sun dried tomatoes tomatoes. I can't wait to try new variations! Thanks!

Big hit at the Chirstmas party! Doubled the recipe due to numbers only complaint was a little to much garlic.  Will make again with 1/2 to 2/3 the amount of garlic.

We are garlic wimps! The two cloves that I put into the dip, were over-whelming. I had to do something to mellow it out. I baked the dip in the oven for about 45 minutes. It helped some. Then I added some parmesan cheese to it. We ate it all! My husband complained about the garlic burping back on him, but I was fine. Love how easy it was to make, though. Maybe garlic wimps like us, need to just use garlic salt instead?? Thanks.

Easy and delicious appetizer dip!  Good with pita chips and fresh veggies.  A nice alternative to hummus.  Maybe next time I'll stir in some chopped artichoke.

This recipe is very good. I think it would benefit from more garlic, as the previous reviewer mentioned. I used dry oregano instead of fresh and a regular tomato and it turned out fine.  Great on pita bread but would also make a good spread on a sandwich.

Absolutely fab!!  I used less garlic and basil and used sun dried tomatoes instead of fresh, adding 2 tablespoons of water to compensate for the moisture in the fresh tomato

Mmm, this was good after sitting for several hours.  I just used it as a spread for crackers.  I might try it on a pizza of some kind.

If you like bean dips, you'll like this recipe.  I used extra garlic, but I am a garlic freak.  I also put in a little extra of the herbs.  I dipped crackers in this dip and also used it in a quesadilla.

I enjoyed this recipe. It was easy to make and the beans could easily be even mushed with a fork. It tasted great on toasted bread or even with baby carrots. I will make this again!

I didn't add the tomato because it seemed like a weird addition and would make the dip spoil a lot faster. I used less garlic than called for and it was still way too garlicy (and I'm a garlic person). I used less oil, and more water to be healthy. I would salt it after it's set for a day. Next time I think I'll add parmesan cheese and more basil. Overall it's really good, especially spread on a wrap with cucumbers and feta.

The recipe says to blend the tomatoes with the beans, but the picture does not show that.  So I put half the diced tomatoes in the food processor and saved half for the top.  Next time I will leave out the pine nuts and tomatoes from the bean mixture. The pine nuts did not contribute much and are expensive.  If you don't have fresh herbs, use 1/3 the amount of dried herbs, but simmer them with the beans a few minutes to revive their flavor.  I suggest  only 1 clove of garlic and add 1/2 tsp sesame oil for more of a a hummus flavor.  This seems like a recipe worth further experimentation.  Several other reviewers have some ideas that I will try.

Delicious dip & a great change of pace from traditional hummus. Got rave reviews from friends at a party. One question: has anyone ever tried it without the pine nuts?? They are so expensive..$9 for a small container! But just wondering how it is without them....

Very tasty!  Served it last year at Thanksgiving and it was gone before the turkey was out of the oven.  Works well with chips OR veggies.  The garlic is a little strong, so use your noggin and modify to suit your own taste.  Lemon juice also works in a pinch if you don't have lime juice handy.

This was wonderful!  I made exactly as stated and it turned out great. Tastes better the longer it refrigerates.  Great appetizer!

This turned out too watery (no additional water added) and the flavors just didn't blend well for my palate.
