This recipe is delicious... in my opinion, about as close as it gets to "authentic" Chinese take-out. Beef didn't come out as crispy as I might have liked, but I wasn't able to slice it "paper thin" either. Nonetheless, it was extremely tender and flavorful. I did make one little addition in adding a "glug" of Riesling to the sauce mixture. Next time I make this, I think I'll double the sauce part of the recipe (except for the OJ concentrate... it's orangey enough) so as to have more to put over the rice. Served with broccoli as well. Heaven on a plate, Diane... keep your recipe's coming!

I think it may have been better for me to stir-fry the beef by itself in the peanut oil for a few minutes, and then follow with the fresh ginger, garlic, & orange peel, as the wonderful flavors of these were lost in the high heat, even for the short time they were sauteed.  They ended up sticking to the bottom of my non-stick wok, so those ingredients crisped up, but the beef didn't. Made this with broccoli, and served with steamed rice.  Thank you for sharing your recipe, Dianemwj.

I made this for dinner tonight. It's pretty darn good. I did change up the way it all goes together based on what some others had said. I deep fried the beef separately from the sauce. Mix all the ingredients for the sauce with the exception of the garlic, ginger, orange peel and oil. After the beef is finished cooking heat the oil and saute the garlic and ginger for about 1 minute. Don't let the garlic burn. Then add the orange peel and the other ingredients. Stir until it's thick and then pour over the meat and mix to coat.

This recipe is AWESOME.  I used it for chicken, over rice noodles, and the taste was better than a restaurant.  I used fresh oranges, 3/4 teaspoon ginger powder, and seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic, and onion powder before cooking, and followed the rest of the recipe.  AND I didn't even marinate. The flavors came together wonderfully. Can't wait to make it again!

Good flavors. I fried my beef in the deep fryer to get it crisp (I tripled the recipe and wasn't into doing lots of batches of it) and made the sauce in the wok. The sauce is pretty sweet and strong, so you may want to dilute it with some regular orange juice like I did. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I doubled the sauce since hubby likes lots of sauce. I like my beef super crispy, so instead of cooking the beef in a pan, after marinating it I rolled it in cornstarch and deep fried it. I used powdered ginger and garlic instead of fresh, and I just put it along with my orange zest in the sauce mixture, then cooked my sauce mixture until thickened. I added cooked frozen broccoli to the sauce(if you add it still frozen it could water down the sauce), and then finally added the deep fried beef and stirred everything to coat with sauce. Scrumptious! Thank you, Diane! I always love to get good new Asian recipes.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I doubled the sauce, b/c I had a bit more meat than the recipe called for.  Plus, I decided to add some veggies (a head of broccoli, a red bell pepper, and a small red onion).  I didn't have any frozen juice concentrate, so I juiced two lemons and three mandarin oranges, mixed them with 2 tbsp. sugar, and cooked it down till it reduced by half.  I also didn't have any rice vinegar, so I used white.  The meat was tender and the sauce was tangy.  I only wish the meat was crisper on the outside, but the cornstarch it was marinated in started making the meat a bit liquidy, even before I added the orange sauce.  It was great overall, and I look forward to leftovers tomorrow! :)

This is really good and so easy!  I, too, cooked the beef first and then added the garlic, ginger and orange zest.  Used 2/3 C prepared orange juice.  Will add green onions next time and maybe water chestnuts.  Topped with a bit of minced parsley and served with rice.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very nice dish, made exactly as the recipe stated.  Meat was marinated all day and cooked up very quickly and was tender.  Will surely make again.

I very rarely make things twice, but I am making this again.  I followed this exactly and it turned out great.  Served it with brown rice and steamed broccoli.  Hubby approved too.

Great recipe Diane! I don't eat beef but I do taste and we all thought it was wonderful. Followed your directions exactly with no changes but next time I may try it with chicken so this gal can enjoy it too. Thank you!!

Absolutely delicious!!! This was by FAR the best short-time meal I have ever made! I created the marinade before my sports practice and stuck it in the fridge. I arrived home at 8:15 and had this with steamed broccoli on the plate at 8:35! For three people!

One of the best oriental dishes on here

Tastes like authentic Chinese. That being said, when my husband prepared it, he used 2 lb of beef, and doubled everything else - with the exception of the red pepper flakes, which he quadrupled.  He also deep fried the beef to make it crispy, since we do not have a wok. The sauce made a nice glaze, which let the brown rice we served it with, stick to it nicely. It was on the higher end of my hotness tolerance for me, but my husband could take it spicier - so a nice average for the spice level. If you would like to serve any broccoli, or other veggies with it, I would recommend doing either 4x or 6x the amount of sauce in the recipe, and cut back a bit on the cornstarch. With the extra pepper, the flavors of the orange, ginger, garlic and sesame really came through. Another variation we will try is frying the beef and serving the sauce as a dipping side.

Flavor was delicious and when kids like it,even better.  I should have followed the previous suggestion to fry the beef a bit before throwing in the garlic,orange peel, and ginger because it did get kind of crispy before the beef did. Next time will add veges.  Family says this recipe a keeper.

Wonderful!  I doubled the sauce and skipped the pepper flakes, however.  Instead I used a 'Cuban Death Bed'. This is an alcoholic shot where you de-seed a habenero pepper and soak grand marnier in it for about 5 minutes.  I used two.  This made the spice smooth and uniform, and diluted enough not to make the dish unpleasantly hot.  I mixed this with the batch of sauce poured in at the end.

I took the other reviews into account when making this and did double the amount of the sauce...great suggestion. My family likes things very spicy, so I think the next time I make it I will double the amount of red pepper flakes.

My husband & I loved this recipe and he is a "meat & potatoes" man. I did fry the beef first by itself and it did work out very well. I put in a little too much red pepper so I added some carrots to absorb some of the heat. It has a very "take out" flavor. Give it a try!

Agree with Dianemwj (aka LadyJayPee),,,  Fry the beef in batches first to get a good browning...set aside.  Steam the broccoli...clean the pan then in a Tbsp of hot (shimmering) oil return the broccoli to the fry pan and lightly (3-4 minutes) fry with the garlic...return the beef to the pan heat through...then add the frozen OJ concentrate...do not use regular OJ...it'll turn to "liquidy" and the beef will loose its crispiness and broccoli will loose its intense green color...  Just prior to serving, I added a half cup of cashews...  Thanks for the recipe....it's a keeper!

Finally, I can make Chinese food like take-out! I've always wondered how they got the texture of the meat to tender and now I know. Baking soda makes all the difference.

We loved it! I would definately marinate for 2.5 to 3 hours.

I just made this again and did marinate for 2 hours and wow! So yummy! 

I recomend doubling the recipe.

Excellent dish!!  The recipe was very easy to follow, and it was delicious.  We added broccoli and served over basmati rice.  We might throw in some carrots and some red bell pepper to add some additional color and texture, but it is a GREAT dish!!

The beef came out really tender and it had a good flavor. It's very simple to make once you gather and combine all your ingredients. I added broccoli to stretch the mean a little further.

My family loved this one! I doubled the "sauce" recipe part. Maybe next time will not double the OJ concentrate as it was slightly too much but delicious. Will make this again. Once everything is prepped, its very easy and quick!

I agree with the other reviewers, stir frying the beef before adding the other ingredients was better, and we doubled the sauce.  A tasty dish!

This is the perfect orange  beef recipe because it has a strong orange flavor without being cloyingly sweet. I added a large head of broccoli, so I doubled the sauce recipe. I also added 3 tbl of orange marmalade since I didn't have oj concentrate. I still included the juice of the orange I zested.  I stir fried the broccoli in a separate  wok, while stir frying the beef to save time.

This did not have the deep flavors I was hoping for. I'll try it again but add more Orange concentrate and way more red pepper.

This was really good. The sauce was not overly sweet, as you sometimes find, so I prefer this recipe.

The marinade needs some work.  1 tbsp of soy sauce is not enough to flavor 1.5 lbs of beef. Next time would think about increasing soy sauce, and maybe adding some chopped garlic and ginger to marinade as well.  Rest of recipe was pretty good.  I deep fried the stips of beef and then just tossed it lightly in the prepared sauce just before serviing. With white rice and steamed broccoli, tasted just like Orange Beef that you get at the local Chinese place.  Will keep.

I've made this several times.  This time, I doubled the amount of sauce and added some steamed broccoli, which made it a complete meal.  Planning to try the sauce on chicken next.  Yum!
