I made two batches of these. The first batch was left pretty much untouched but instead of nuts I added peanut butter chips. The second batch I used dried cranberries instead of raisins and Orange extract instead of vanilla but I DID put in the nuts this time. They turned out amazing! Thank you for sharing!

Ranger cookies bring back childhood memories and these did it for me. When i was a child we would use "Cranberry Almond Crunch" cereal in place of some of the oatmeal and it turned out EXCELLENT. And we under cook them a little so they are still soft and chewy - yum! This was an excellent recipe though but I adapted it and added cranberries instead of the raisins and it reminded me of younger years! Everyone loved them!

This recipe is so yummy! I have made it a couple of times both times adding chocolate chips and white chocolate chips. Another little tip is to soak the raisins in boiling water to soften them. Anyway you make these they are just so delicious!

You must try these if you haven't already! They are delicious and so versatile! I have also been making this recipe for many years. It makes a ton and they keep well. If you don't like that sort of old chewy consistency that cookes can get after a couple of days use unsweetened coconut instead of the sweetened flaked kind. I like them better this way anyway!

Very good cookies. I omitted the raisins since I do not like them. All I can suggest is to bake on a greased cookie sheet; I also like to let cookies rest after baking for 3-4 minutes before removing from cookie sheet. Thanks for the recipe Bernie

Yummy! Just made a batch. So good. I added pecans instead of walnuts and mini chocolate chips. I used half shortening and half butter. They turned out great. The children like the chocolate but I think they taste great without the chocolate also. One doesn't taste the other flavors when the chocolate is added. I like to use golden raisons in the recipe. The children like them better.

good but I prefer just oatmeal raisen without the coconut and the nuts - the combined taste of the coconut takes away from the flavor to me.

I needed a recipe to use up some coconut walnuts and raisins and found this one. This is a GREAT cookie! I hate to make changes to a recipe before rating but I had no choice. I used 1 cup shortening & 1/2 cup margarine and cut back on the white sugar by 1/2 cup. Also at the last minute I added 1 cup choc chips (wanted to use them up before the kids eat them!). I baked for 11 1/2 minutes and had a crisp light brown very tasty cookie. VERY delish! Also made 6 dozen. Must be BIG cookies to get 36! Will definitely make again! This is a keeper for sure.

My children love these cookies. I chop up the raisins before adding them to the dough so that they blend in better with the nuts. I enjoy the texture of these cookies. Thank-you Rhonda.

Awsome Cookies. I did change/add a few items. Instead of using raisins I used cranberries. I reduced the rolled oats to 2 cups and added 1-1/2 cups of rice crispies. I always have problems removing cookies from ungreased cookie sheets so I used parchment paper. After the cookies cool you can pick them up with your hands and its so much easier. I increased the cooking time to 12 minutes.

These cookies were really good and a nice change to the ordinary cookies I make all the time. I did use splenda and brown sugar splenda to make them and the cookie was just right not to sweet like others stated. I also switched the raisins to cranberries since I don't like raisins. I will add cinnamon next time since the cookies tasted like they needed a little something.

I made these yesterday and they made a really good cookie! They are like oatmeal cookies with goodies in it but are much better than your regular oatmeal cookie. I don't know what made them better maybe the pecans and coconut. Anyway they are chewy substantial cookies! I liked them!!

Delicious. I'm sure its great as is but I did add 1 1/2 cups cornflakes and some cin. and nutmeg. I used pecans instead of walnuts too. I only made two-thirds of the recipe and it made almost 5 dozen. I also cooked them for 10-12 min. YUM!

I first ate these cookies from a grocery store while on vacation in Myrtle Beach. When I got home I searched this website for the recipe. These were great! I made them w/o raisins and with and without walnuts. I would highly recommend them.

I was shocked after I made these. One person said you could use unsweetened coconut so I did -because it was all I had on hand. Maybe I might try half a recipe with sweetened coconut. Sorry to be a dissenting view but these didn't taste that much like the ranger cookies I've tasted...

I find these cookies delicious! They are an adult cookie however. My boys (16 and 12)won't eat anything with nuts coconut or raisins. They aren't overly sweet and have a wonderful soft texture. A keeper!

I wanted to try something different than regular oatmeal raisin cookies but this recipe did NOT work for me and I'm not sure why. The first cookie sheet full was totally flat and mushy in the middle. On the second cookie sheet full I tried making them smaller and baking them longer still flat and even browner than the picture. The recipe does not tell you how big to make the cookies. I did not like the coconut I will be sticking with my regular tried and true recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies with cinnamon etc. Sorry didn't like them.

I brought these into two places. Some people absolutely loved them and went crazy and asked for the recipe. That's why I gave it 5 stars. For my tastes next time more oatmeal less flour some cinnamon or some type of spice for flavor and chocolate chips. Personally I'd give it a 3-4 but enough people loved them. I made them huge and smashed them down and cooked them for about 18 minutes or so. They looked awesome and baked perfectly.

These tasted great! I only had one stick of butter so I added 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce and 1 tbsp oil in place of the rest of the butter. I also subbed half the raisins for craisins just to vary things up a bit. I knew I wanted chocolate in there too so I left out 1/2 c of sugar and put in 1 c of dark chocolate chips. It kind of sounds like I didn't even make this recipe... whatever they tasted good and my houseguest loved them!!!

Great recipe. I omitted the raisins used pecans instead of walnuts and added butterscotch chips. Next time I will up the salt but just for a personal preference since I love the salty sweet combo. These were a hit!

I halved the amount of white sugar and would also halve the brown sugar next time as they were still a little too sweet for my taste. Otherwise they are pretty good. They cook more and get golden as they cool so I would recommend baking 8 minutes 9 tops. The half-recipe gave me 42 cookies.

Great recipe! The kids loved them & so did we. But next time I make these I am going to try cutting back on the white sugar to 1 cup & Brown Sugar to 1 1/4. I will report back on how this adjustment turns out. Thank you for this recipe yummy!

This recipe is almost identical that was handed to me by a friend and had been in her family for many many years. The only difference is her recipe has cornflakes in it--otherwise it is exactly the same but it is a great recipe! I am not much on coconut but this one is good and doesn't have that cocunuty flavor. Love it!!

I love these cookies. I have a recipe that is very similar but you know how us old f rts are; we put stuff away to move and then can't find the cookbooks. Yes I made minor changes to this recipe to make it like "mine". I cut the ingredients by 1/3 and the recipe still made 9 dozen cookies. I also replaced the walnuts with pecans and the raisins with dried cranberries. Lastly the coconut I used was from the frozen food section (frozen from fresh). Everyone loved them!

I doubled the recipe used butter flavor Crisco and corn flakes. (I had an excess I was trying to use up.) I also left out coconut and nuts due to allergies in my family and raisins due to picky eaters. They came out light and tasty!

Delicious but turned into one gigantic cookie. Added a lil' more flour stuck it in freezer for a few better but still spread out way too much. Hmmmm. Tasty but 3 batches later still tinkering with recipe to get em to hold shape. I added listed amount of butter and eggs & baking soda. Can a super hot day really make the difference?

I add more candied fruit. Make a larger recipe and roll some batter up in parchment paper and plastic. Then cut off as needed. These cookies do not last long at my house. Can't make them fast enough. They literally will eat these for breakfast.

Mine came out perfect! So delish! I only had 1 c. Of butter so I used that and a 1/2 c. Of shortening! I scooped a tablespoon of mix and rolled into balls and it took 12 minutes on parchment paper! So yummy!
