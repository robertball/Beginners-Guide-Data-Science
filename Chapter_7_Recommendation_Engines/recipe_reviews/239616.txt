We really enjoyed this recipe. I gave it 4 stars because there's an unnecessary step here. I added the hot sauce & honey to the batter (skipped the butter) and roasted the florets at 450 for about 13 minutes. Sheer greatness! The batter stuck to the pieces well and cooked up just right. Thank you!

I love the idea, but the final outcome wasn't really what I was after.  I didn't care for the batter on the cauliflower as it turned out, and I didn't like the honey in the sauce.  I know it's a very small amount, but the roasted cauliflower added enough sweetness for me.  As another reviewer suggested, I think it would be better if the sauce was cooked into the dish longer.  I decided to make again with some changes and loved it.  I coated the cauliflower in the butter-hot sauce mixture (minus the honey) with a little olive oil thrown in, too.  I used homemade hot sauce on my second try-made with Hot Portugal peppers.  I had some Parmesan peppercorn sourdough bread that had gone stale, and I whizzed some in the processor to make bread crumbs.  I then tossed the bread crumbs (with a bit of grated parm thrown in for good measure) with the cauliflower and then baked.  I got a nice crunch from the breadcrumbs and combined with the lovely, caramelized cauliflower, it was out of this world good.  Nice and spicy, too.  I cut the cauliflower into pretty small pieces, too.

We made these and they were quite good.  I'm not sure the batter at the beginning is necessary.  They could be just as good roasted and then finished off with the sauce.  But a nice alternative to the vegetarian friends I still have.  :)_    (That's wing sauce dripping on my emoji face)

This was a good way to eat Cauliflower if you like spice.  It didn't get as crispy as I had hoped. The flavor was good and can be adjusted according to your heat level.  My husband and I like it hot so I made it hot and it was good.  You can use any hot sauce of choice.  I would suggest baking at 450 and then crisping with broiler on both sides before adding the hot sauce and then baking again as instructed.  Then the last 5 minutes crisp again with broiler.

Read other reviews first, so I did not expect it to be really crunchy. I made exactly as stated, but my method was different. I made the batter in a mixing bowl, threw in the cauliflower, stirred a while, then removed the cauliflower  with a spoon sieve. When it came time to put the hot sauce on, I again made it in a bowl and popped the baked  pieces in , stirred until completely coated and removed with the sieve back to the baking sheet. Although it wasn't very crunchy, it was delicious if you like spicy foods.  When we want a change from cheese sauce or just plain, this will be what I do!

I think I found a way to stick to my diet. Seems like I always fall off the wagon when I get a "wing" craving. I made these as instructed (only instead of brushing on the hot sauce, I gently tossed them around in a bowl as another reviewer suggested). It did not bother me that they were not crispy, however when I made the leftovers the next day (15 min at 450 to reheat) the smaller pieces were quite crispy and I really liked that. Maybe I will try broiling before adding the wing sauce. Another thought, when you make baked wings, part of the secret is after you bread them, you put them in the fridge for 2 - 3 hours before baking them. If I have the fridge space, maybe I'll try that and I'll update my comments if that happens to change anything. I will certainly make these again, probably 2 - 3 times a month in order to stay away from the deep fried chicken wings.

I followed one of the reviewers' ideas and just coated the cauliflower in the butter/hot sauce mix with some oil added, then added some bread crumbs and broiled it all.  After 20-25 minutes it was not entirely crunchy, but it was delicious!  I will definitely make this again--it's easy and tasty.

This came out absolutely scrumptious! For those complaining about crispness I don't know why...  cut my florets in half so they lay flat side on the pan and they came out good and crispy!

They were great using what I had on hand so people don't get your undies all in a bunch about "changing the recipe".  I used half siracha and half "Valentina Hot Sauce" and it worked really well.  Tasty as a snack or appetizer.

not impressed........I did what another reviewer suggested and broiled this both before adding sauce and after the final round of baking, and it still did not crisp.(I even used a rack for more air movement).

I used margarine instead of butter, Sriracha instead of Franks. I also added red pepper flakes. Wow! Hot! Get out your blue cheese for these.  Not quite enough to make me believe I'm eating chicken, but good and light.

This was excellent.  Cut the florets in half so that the flat side laid flat on the pan. This helped so much with the crispness.  Also,  during both cooking times, I broiled for the last 5 mins. Instead of the honey, I subbed a few squirts of the hot sauce with siracha. Even my hubby loved it. Will definitely be making again!

I did change the flour components.  I used 1/2 c a.p. flour and 1/4 c. cornstarch.  Served with Ranch dressing, but next time will use Bleu Cheese and serve with carrot and celery sticks.  It is a great, fun alternative to wings, and will be a welcome addition for my vegetarian grandchildren.

I'm giving it 5 stars because the GUYS at my super bowl party loved it!  I couldn't believe it!  Followed the recipe perfectly.  I was teased to no end about serving this instead of chicken wings because I was trying to be healthier.  They almost refused to try it.  But...when one did...the rest ate them all.  Very good!  Next time...I MAY cook them a little longer.

Really good flavor but mine came out mushy as others were saying. I did omit the honey and water hoping that would help. I broiled at the end and that seemed to help some. I think next time I will roast for 10 minutes, then toss with sauce and broil until brown. I think the current recipe over cooks the cauliflower and I wouldn't mind if it was still a little crunchy.

Quite nice - I will make this again. I liked how the recipe turned out with the batter but I also made it without, just sprinkling the garlic powder, salt & pepper before roasting and it was quite nice both ways. I also opted to use buffalo wing sauce instead of regular hot sauce with the honey and butter.

Very good and filling.  I tossed the cauliflower in a saucepan on the stove in the sauce and then put the pan under the broiler to crisp up the cauliflower. Would make again!

These are excellent! Followed some advice and seasoned the batter with approx 1/4 tsp cayenne. I battered and placed the cauliflower on a greased baking sheet and refrigerated for and hour to set batter. Cooked for 13 min @ 400*. Came out crispy so I freed them in wing sauce and cooked an additional 5 min @ 400 and served them with ranch dressing on the side. Family ate every bite !  Good job! Thanks!!!

I'm not a fan of cauliflower, but I loved this! Great flavor! I'm not sure the batter is necessary. It didn't seem to add anything to the recipe.

Everyone enjoyed these. The hardest part for me was trying to find a way to control the amount of heat in the sauce. I found that by going over them more than once increased the hot flavor. I have made this 3 times and think that 2 times is the best compromise for my tastes.

I've made this a second time and it was a bigger hit than the last. I tried to follow the recipe exactly, but again I rarely measure anything so my batter was a little more than I needed. The good thing is that this mistake gave the dish a little more crunch. This is so a great way to eat healthy. Even my daughter who doesn't like cauliflower, actually asked for the recipe.  Do yourself a favor and try this one for yourself.

This was great for the superbowl party I attended. All my friends loved it!  I had to double the amount of sauce to coat all the cauliflower. If I made it again, I'd double the amount of batter too and make it a bit thicker. I used regular flour since that's what I had.

These were alright. A bit underwhelming. I mixed in the hot sauce and honey into the batter as recommended by another reviewer and baked for 20 minutes. If you like spice I would recommend leaving out the honey as it tamed the heat and seemed bland. It's a good quick base recipe, but could use some doctoring up. I'll definitely make again though, possibly using Panko flakes, a hotter sauce, and adding red pepper flakes.

I used rice flour. The rest of the ingredients remained the same . It was really tasty. What a wonderful option instead of fried chicken wings.  This would make a wonderful party snack! I will make this again and again.  It's that good!!

I cannot believe how good this was. My husband and I love wings and have been a little out of control lately with our wing intake ( football season). I made this tonight, exactly like the recipe, except I used regular flour.  Wow. We were blown away- tasted exactly like wings- without the fat! Will make again!!

I followed this exactly, except I had no honey, so I used a sprinkle of sugar instead. What an amazing way to eat cauliflower. It's delicious hot or room temp. I had to put in a sealed glass container to keep from eating the whole pan!

Very good recipe! The only change I made was to just take my rinsed cauliflower and sprinkle it with a bit of flour/garlic powder mixture. Refrigerate for a short time then proceed with recipe as written. It was slightly crispy.

This was delicious, my cauliflower head was too small, and added broccoli to the mix.   I also used a different hot sauce since I was out of franks.    I have this recipe memorized now, so I'll be making this again, but with different veggies.

I added two tablespoons of cornstarch to the batter, otherwise all was as listed. The batter was very very lightly brown when it came out of the oven the first time; I suspect it would have been a little crisper had I allowed it to bake another 4-5 minutes before brushing the sauce on. All things considered, I’ll probably make it again.

I made this for a healthy appetizer and it was wonderful.  My husband loved it.  Based on another review, I mixed the hot sauce and honey in the flour mix and omitted the butter.  I also placed the cauliflower pieces on cooling racks placed on the baking sheets lightly sprayed with PAM.  They baked for about 15 minutes.  Excellent!

I made it as the recipe stated except I used only one head of cauliflower so I had a lot of extra batter which I coated heavily on the cauliflower. Because I didn't use as much cauliflower as the recipe called for, there was batter puddled beneath each cauliflower sprig which ended up being great because although the cauliflower did not become crunchy, the extra batter stuck beneath each sprig was thin and crispy and added great texture. The hot sauce/honey/butter sauce was delicious!  It was a hit with my hubbby and sister who already emailed me for the recipe! We ended up devouring it before the main course was ready so it actually was our appetizer! I will be making it again!!

My friends and family are obsessed with these! Instead of tossing the cauliflower in the batter, I dip each one individually and then wipe off the excess batter so it's just enough to coat the exterior. If you don't do this, then the batter will pool, stick to the pan, and burn. These usually take me about an hour to make with the slightly labor-intensive batter coating method that I use. I add extra honey to the sauce, along with lime juice - gives it a nice tangy finish without being too hot.

I wanted a healthier snack and thought this may be good. I made the recipe as written but as many reviewers have said they cauliflower does not get crisp, like it does with when you roast it. If it had done that it would have been much better. It was still edible but it was not a favorite.

Really good and a great option for something different rather than just plain cauliflower.  I roast veggies all the time in the oven so I knew it wouldn't turn out very crunchy but I was just using as a side to go with pork and not as a wing alternative.

I thought this was good, however, Hubby did not care for it at all. I loved the idea, Hubby would just rather eat a wing. Except for using regular AP flour, I  made the recipe exactly as written and overall thought the flavor was pretty good. The best pieces were the ones that really became crunchy in the oven. I placed them under the broiler for 2 minutes, however, if I ever made these again I would broil them for a bit longer.

So simple and so good.  I did wind up putting more honey (about 2 tsp) but just because I'm a fan of spicy and sweet,  the recipe is fine as is.  I'll definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing.

this was good; we always roast our cauliflower (salt, pepper, garlic and onion powders) so i did that as usual and then roasted, after browned i tossed with our favorite buffalo sauce.  put back in oven to crisp up.  i may have cooked too long as they were a bit soggy.  i will try again, maybe with the batter and re-review.

I made a few changes so hard to rate the original recipe but I used half APF and half cornstarch, used milk till the batter was the right consistency. I shook off excess batter and then tossed in Italian bread crumbs. Sprayed the florets with cooking spray to assist in crisping and baked on parchment to prevent sticking. I didn’t do the second bake after tossing in the sauce. I think this would make them soggy. These were crispy and amazing! I highly recommend the bread crumbs and the sauce toss and serve.

We really enjoyed this recipe! I only had one cauliflower so used  the function for half the servings, it didn't seem like much but it was just enough. I followed the recipe as much as I could. I was pretty busy cooking other stuff and didn't get a chance to turn them over, but they still turned out great. I ended up using about 1/4 tsp of salt (maybe a smidge less). They were not very crunchy or crispy but the flavor was on point so I didn't care. I ended up eating them with a spoon at the end... served with ken's buttermilk ranch and celery.

Loved this! After reading others' reviews, I only used 3/4 cup of water for my gluten-free flour mixture.  The last minute of roasting the cauliflower, I turned on the boiler to crisp/brown the veggies a little.  I then removed the pan, brushed on my sauce and baked them again at 450.  
Shared this an appetizer with my neighbors, but I will make it again and serve it over yellow rice or a salad for dinner.

My husband and I could eat this every day.  I left out the honey because we don't eat sugar and it didn't need it.  it's very filling and just a hint of spice.  We dipped in blue cheese dressing but sprinkled some chunks of blue cheese onto the dressing to add that strong blue cheese taste.  I may try adding some cayenne to make it a bit more spicy.  thanks for the great recipe!

I like the recipe but I think everything that went wrong was my fault! I went wrong with using frozen cauliflower and almond flour for the batter. The florets ended up being soggy and grainy but the flavor was ok. I also didn’t use any honey because I was out. I think I would like to try a variation of this recipe in an air fryer.

The recipe worked well and the final product was great. I think I could've added the hot sauce into the batter and skipped a step. I also needed more hot sauce than the recipe intended. but for the first time, it went well!

This was a very flavorful dish however if you want a crisper bite, then let it stay in the oven a little longer.  The family enjoyed it and I will do this again

I also went ahead and just added the hot sauce to the mixture and tossed the cauliflower in that. Next time, I might cut this recipe in half so I don’t have to eat buffalo cauliflower all week, and I might cut back on the water, as the sauce was a bit runny.

I like a bit of spicy now and then and this hits the spot while staying within a healthy diet. It's a great substitute when you are craving something like hot wings and don't want all the calories. It's a great side dish on it's own or with bleu cheese dressing but of course that makes it less healthy. I left out the flour as it seemed to be unnecessary. Definitely line your pan with foil though it's much easier on the cleanup.

I followed the recipe yet the cauliflower turned out very soft to the point of mushiness - had to throw most of it out.  Any idea what I might have done wrong?

If you like cauliflower you'll probably like this.  After reading the reviews mixing the hot sauce with the batter would probably work. 

Next time I'm going to cook them longer to try to add crisp to the batter.

I like this cauliflower but it’s not anything like wings (other than the sauce).  The batter is pretty runny so the next time I make it I’ll make it with less water.  The first time I made it I stirred the cauliflower and the second time I didn’t and it allowed it to get browned and crunchy (much better!)

This is an amazing dish. The sauce is spicy and tastes just like the sauce on buffalo chicken. I was very surprised how nice it tastes on Cauliflower. This has definitely been added to my favorites.

Always on the lookout for healthier snacks!
I like simple, so I followed other reviewers comments... substituted olive oil for butter, mixed sauce in a plastic bag, added cauliflower to coat, spread out on a baking pan, then sprinkled with bread crumbs to add some crunch.  The sauce got a bit charred where it contacted the pan, but this added to the flavor nicely.  Pretty tasty, for cauliflower!

I made it as the directions. I think next time l will add the hot sauce to the batter, as it was less crispy than before l put it on, even though  l broiled it the last 4 minutes. It was too hot for my husband, but  I'll try it again because l'm on a potassium restricted diet and cauliflower is on my low potassium list.

You need to change the batter formulation. Not thick enough and after baking and lightly lathering with sauce I not only baked it for another 10-15 minutes but I had to broil then on high to get the browning.  One tip as well when using frozen ... you may need to microwave to thaw and remove the extra water before battering and baking

This was a great idea.  It was very tasty.  Although I did make some changes.  Nobody in our family likes hot sauce. So I used a B.B.Q sauce instead.   Everybody thought I was making chicken wings.  And were surprised that it was actually cauliflower.  They all seemed to like it.

Delicious!!!  I followed the recipe except I only made 1 head of cauliflower and slightly adjusted the gluten free flour and water because of that. I did turn the florets halfway through baking, and had sprayed them with olive oil before turning them.   My husband loved them, too!

I baked using my convection oven option, at 425 degrees and used a bit less than called for, Tapitio hot sauce. Everyone enjoyed these. I didn't care for the smell of baked cauliflower though, that lingered all evening long. I'll use air freshener next time!

I used regular ap flour and had to use less water because of this. I really like the batter, not too heavy, and the hot sauce, not too spicy but plenty of tang to need ranch ( for me at least). Cooking time made the perfect soft but not squishy cauliflower pieces.

I made this exactly as written and it was delish. Next time. However, I will take the advice of Pauline and mix all ingredients together in one shot to shorten the time.

It was pretty good. I didn't use honey. I used Sweet Baby Rays buffalo sauce and substituted the honey with  2 tablespoons of Tapatio hot sauce. Next time, I would 86 the batter and eat it roasted.

I followed the recipe exactly and found that it really lacked flavor. I had an expectation that it would taste like wing sauce but it just tasted like spicy cauliflower.

Yum yum & easy

I don't buy butter so I sub coconut oil instead, also throw in random seasonings too sometimes. Very hot, I use sriracha, and less of it.

You can totally skip the batter step. It’s completely Unnecessary. It left the cauliflower really soggy even leaving it in the oven double the time and flipping them. I would try the recipe again minus the batter.

I didn't 'paint' each piece with the sauce, instead sprinkled it over the pieces and mixed in the pan.  It was a little too spicy for me so next time I'll use less how sauce

Made this afternoon for an informal family gathering. All enjoyed the flavor; however, the pieces were not crispy and were mushy. Maybe I cooked a little too long? But they were all eaten! I will make again and shorten baking times and try the breadcrumbs and broiler as suggested by other reviewers.

I just made this recipe, and it's phenomenal - if you follow reviewers recommendations.

I did not make the recipe as written, instead, I followed the recommendations of wisweetp and it came out perfectly. Both crunchy and spicy!

If I were to make this again I would skip the flower/water dunking part and instead would blanch the raw cauliflower first then add the hot sauce mix and maybe put it on a charcoal grill to finish off. I found the flour/water coating to be somewhat nauseating and a turn-off. I did like the hot sauce and would double that recipe as there wasn't enough for a full head of cauliflower.

Used all ingredients except garlic powder (already in the hot sauce) and gluten-free flour (too lazy to go out and buy it; used all-purpose flour instead). Also used cauliflower & broccoli. Sprinkled chunky blue cheese on the finished product after taking out of the oven. Liked t enough to make it twice this weekend. Nice and fairly easy recipe.

Awful! Followed recipe instructions to a T.  It was a big pile of very spicy cauliflower mush.  Big waste of time and money. So disappointed.

These were great and really simple to make. I read some reviews, omitted the batter and just roasted the cauliflower with seasoning, tossed with buffalo sauce and roasted some more and they came out beautifully. I didn’t mind that they weren’t crispy since they were already so full of flavor. These were great and I’ll make them time and time again since they were so dang easy to make.

It wasn't what I expected. The breading was nasty and glue type after I took it out of the oven. Maybe I'll fry it next time. But they were okay. I don't really recommend it.

I was skeptical on trying this but wanted to try a healthy alternative to wings. This was very good!! My wife doesn't like food overly spicy so the only change was I cut the hot sauce with Thousand Island dressing. (so much for keeping the healthy alternative healthy) We really liked this as a side dish and as an appetizer.

I cut out steps and changed ingredients since I didn't like when I made the original. I put the dry ingredients in a bowl with 1/4 c hot sauce, 1/4 cup ranch dressing, and 1/4 c water. Then put the cauliflower in the bowl and mixed it up. Cooks great and saves time

The breading wasn't enough, I would double it next time!  Substituted siracchi sauce for the hot hot sauce!  Big mistake!  They were very hot!  But I am not throwing them out!  I will take them into work and share them with my friends and even my Boss!  Take that !

Easy and delicious! Like other reviews, I mixed all ingredients together at the beginning, saved time, and still turned out great.  Added bread crumbs and broiled for 5 minutes to add some crispness.

The recipe was easy to follow and did not involve too many ingredients!  The hot sauce was too much for me, but my husband loved it!  Next time, I think I will skip the hot sauce and use more garlic.  :-)  Thank you!

I bought a bag of precut cauliflower from Costco. I followed others ideas and cut the large pieces in half, flat side down. I also put all the ingredients in a metal bowl and stirred the cauliflower in. I used a slotted spoon to remove from batter and I placed it on a wire rack over a tin foiled covered cookie sheet. I added extra wing sauce for more heat. It was still thick, so I added more water. I cooked these at 450* for 27 minutes. The taste was good enough and the cauliflower was not crunchy at all. We dipped the cauliflower in more Wing sauce and fresh ranch to eat it. It was all eaten, but I am not sure if I'll make it again.

Excellent recipe! I would suggest a few things. #1 Use parchment paper.  #2 Turn the cauliflower before coating with hot sauce mix. #3 Use wing sauce. #4 After it bakes the last time, use the parchment paper to slide it onto a cooling rack so it doesn't get soggy.

I added some Shirachi Powder to the batter.  I did not use honey in the sauce.   I made extra sauce to pour over the cauliflower after it baked.  It was delicious!!!  Crunchy, spicy!  I would not add the Shirachi powder again as it was really spicy!  But the sauce was very good and the cauliflower crisped up nicely.  To make sure the batter coated each piece, I put the batter and cauliflower florets in a sealed container and shook it well.  Easy and highly recommended!

This was a hit  at our super bowl party, everyone loved it. Followed the recipe without changing anything. Great substitution for wings. We used tinfoil and coated with oil but definitely does stick. At least it was easy to clean up. Definitely will make again.

I give it a 5 rating just for the idea. I didn't make from scratch but substituted Hooters breading and sauce that I keep on hand for chicken.  I'm sure this recipe would be great but I cheated a little.  Followed same procedures. Will definitely make again. Note, for two of us I didn't even use a whole head of cauliflower and just enough breading with water added.

An absolutely delicious side dish for any meal...definitely not for the faint though...you gotta like spicy!  The batter that coats it gave a wonderful crispiness to the outside.  I will definitely be making this again!

These were very good.  I agree with some others that the batter step can be skipped.  What a great alternative to wings.

Made it twice. First time I followed the directions and it was enjoyed by all. Second time, I upped the ingredients by 50% and finished it off under the broiler.   The slight crisp or burn really kicked it up both visually and on the taste buds.

8.3.16   Next time, I’ll put these on a rack inside the baking pan, so the batter drips through.  The one thing I didn’t care for is that the batter puddles at the bottom of  each piece of cauliflower and bakes into overly brown crust (hope that makes sense).  We’re about a 6 or 7 on a scale of 10 as far as spiciness goes, and this recipe does have a kick.  I love my buffalo chicken wings, and now I have new way to enjoy anything “buffalo.”

I don't do "teaspoons" of anything, so I added considerably more garlic, as well as honey.  Serving to guests today, so we'll see how it goes.  Oh, I also added a little cornstarch to the batter for thickening and crispiness.

I followed the directions and this just didn't turn out tasty. I felt the cauli needed to be crisper and it just didn't work with flavor.

I've made these several times and I like them. I would absolutely love them if they were crunchy. I have baked them longer thinking that will do the trick, broiled them after bakimg them, but they're always soft with an occasional slightly crunchy one here and there.

Made exactly as the recipe states and it was great, we all gobbled it up!  What put it over the top, though, was a sprinkle of crumbled blue cheese on top--a must!

I'm vegetarian and my partner isn't this was a delish compromise.  We halved the recipe.  Loved the flavor. It was a bit spicy for my boyfriend so he said he would rate it 4.5

I don't know what the flour mixture was supposed to do. All it did for me was make a gross paste. Nothing was crispy. If I make this again, I'm definitely going to skip that step and just brush on the honey mixture.

Didn't float my boat.  I used tobacco for hot sauce and it was ok.  Next time I will try the buffalo cauliflower florets recipe.  It sounds more interesting...

Very easy to make, I used Frank's Buffalo sauce and it turned out pretty well.   I also tossed the cauliflower in the sauce rather than brushing it on and I flipped the florets a few times to help even the crispness.   They had a really nice, meaty texture.  I thought they were  very tasty.

Used a silicone baking mat on the baking sheet so it wouldn't stick, and used whole wheat flour. Forgot the blue cheese/ranch, but it's true, it's not necessary. This was really, really delicious and will make again soon.

This was great.  Tasted good and healthy too!  Took to a gathering and was gone.
Only thing I did per reading reviews is mix cauliflower with four coating mix and refrigerate for an hour or so.

Made to recipe, and it was excellent! I told my girlfriend I would save her the leftover pieces and she only got one. Lucky girl. I shared this with people at work and already ordered more cauliflower from our local market delivery. This will make a regular rotation.

Made these and they were ok. Never got crispy. Instead of the butter and hot sauce, I used Texas Pete Wing Sauce. Tasted good; just not quite what I was expecting.

This was pretty good.  It sure doesn't taste like cauliflower.  I forgot to dip it in blue cheese dressing, but it didn't need it.  I think it would be even better with that.

Excellent healthy vegetarian alternative to buffalo chicken, and healthy too!!! (If you replace the butter and honey with vegan alternatives it would also work out great as a vegan treat.) I absolutely LOVED it!!! So did my teenage brother and the members of his punk rock band. Will make again!!!

At the last minute, I discovered the only hot sauce I had on hand was mango flavoured. I used that & all-purpose flour. Overall it was alright but not my favourite. Maybe with regular hot sauce & last-minute broiling. I will try again but will also try other recipes.

This was like candy!  I which I had made more, and will be making it again.  I followed the recipe, except I cut up the Cauliflower into large florets, and substituted Cholula Chipotle sauce for the Sriracha sauce, then roasted if for 30 minutes.  The freshly grated Parmesan cheese
is what makes this so special.

Our family liked these a lot. Wished they were crispier but then again this is baked. As another reviewer suggested I will try broiling before adding the hot sauce and then again after. We had them with ribs and asparagus. Very yummy.

Interesting flavor. I'd make it without the breading the next time.

I made this recipe exactly like it read, except I added 2 tablespoons of honey instead of 1 teaspoon. We loved it!

I was very excited to try this recipe!  It tasted like wing sauce on cauliflower. Disappointed. However my husband stirred it in with some Alfredo pasta I had made for him and he LOVED the combo!

We loved this! Husband was skeptical, but ended up eating almost all of the half-batch that I made. A great Meatless Monday option added to our menu rotation!
