Loved 'em!  I used all whole-wheat flour, and I added a dollop of honey ... the dough was sticky, but I patted it out and cut the biscuits, anyway ... I'm just not crazy about "drop" anything ... just used enough flour on the counter and dough to get the job done ... they baked up fluffy and golden ... I didn't think they were dense at all ... they warmed up well, too ... I had them for a few breakfasts!  :)

These were wonderful.  I'd been addicted to making regular biscuits (J.P.'s from this site) and managed to severely deplete my all purpose flour supply.  I used a cup of each, and used olive instead of canola oil.  I also added 1 tsp. of white sugar.  They were a little crumbly, but no more than your average drop biscuit.  My son LOVED them, and they were great with the chicken and rice soup I made.  Oh.  I used regular 1% milk too.  I'm not vegan, so soy milk just isn't in the pantry!  Thanks for the recipe!

Good and VERY easy.  I served them with gravy.  Without any toppings,  I thought the flavor was a tiny bit lacking.  If it weren't for the flavor I would have given them 5 stars.   The texture was very moist a little dense but that is typical of whole wheat and one of the reasons why I prefer it. I did add a bit more milk (I used cow's milk).  I also only got 9 large biscuits.

Pretty good and much healthier than prepackaged biscuits.  Since I don't keep soy milk on hand, I used skim milk instead of soy.  Since I didn't have all purpose flour (ran out), I used all whole wheat.  I also added garlic, oregano, Italian seasoning, a bit of sugar and some cinnamon.  I will make this again but would probably cut down on the oil by increasing the milk or adding water.

I am trying to prepare more healthy options so I used only the wheat flour and made a triple batch - using olive oil and skim milk. The amount of milk the conversion gave, as well as the baking powder, wasn't quite enough. I liked it and the kids seemed to as well, tho my husband requested the 1/2 white flour next time. This is the first whole wheat recipe I enjoyed. Please note, my biscuits didn't rise with just whole wheat flour but they were still a nice consistancy.  Looked like rocks but not hard!

Really impressed, we had everything but the whole wheat.  Not a fan of shortening, made them within 10 minutes of reading the recipe, added honey instead of sugar and a little extra soy.   Made huge biscuits, cooked evenly and fluffy and tasted great!  Ate them with sausage and gravy.

These were excellent! I used what I had on hand - pastry flour instead of all-purpose flour and skim milk instead of soy milk - but even with substitutions these had a tender crumb and were light and airy. I added some garlic powder and basil along with the flour; very savory and delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good biscuits after a few modifications: I added 2 Tbs honey and 1/2 tsp cinnamon, substituted 1/4 cup of plain yogurt for the oil and only used 1/4 tsp of salt. Mine were perfect in 8 minutes (any longer would have been too long)...moist and delicious. I'll be making these again!

Great vegan recipe!!! I was looking for a dairy-free biscuit recipe to serve "Strawberries with Balsamic Vinegar" (on this site) on top of. The small changes I made was to use almond/coconut milk and safflower oil, as well as add two tablespoons of raw organic sugar and some ground cinnamon and cardamom. Can't wait to make a savory version.

I didn't care for these. All I could taste was baking powder. Although they were easy, I won't be making them again.

These were fantastic! I needed a quick whole wheat biscuit recipe that didn't call for yeast or buttermilk. I added 2 tsp of sugar, but otherwise followed the recipe. They didn't need honey or jam or anything else. Perfect. Thank you!

These were pretty good, though I will agree with the others that they are a bit bland.  I think next time, insead of using canola oil, I'll use butter.  I also added a few Tbs more milk (skim cow milk), and a couple teaspoons of honey.  I also had to bake them a lot longer than it said, but that was my fault for making them much too big.

Made these biscuits this morning with my daughter.  They came out sooooo good.  I have to admit though, they were kinda bland. But no one noticed.  I made  a gravy with cream of mushroom soup and Morningstar Mushroom Burgers. Poured it over the biscuits and YUMMY!! The kids had theirs with eggs and Morningstar Stripples.  Overall, we enjoyed.  I need to play with the flavor. But I'm so thankful to find a recipe without hydrogenated oils. THANK YOU!!!  (I neglected to add that I too rolled them out and cut out the biscuits.  Not thrilled about dropping them.  My daughter loved it)

Delicious!  I was skeptical about whole wheat biscuits, but these had that yummy whole-wheat nuttiness without being to heavy or dense.  I did use skim milk instead of soy, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and my whole family loved them.  I do agree with a previous reviewer that the yield was more like 9 regular biscuits (about 2 1/2"-3" round) rather than 16.  Thanks for a great recipe -- this one will definitely be a staple at our house!

I rolled out the dough and cut with a cookie cutter rather than using the drop method. Pretty good biscuit---I like that they had whole wheat! They were really flat but that is the w.w. in there. Thanks for the recipe! Reminds me of 'English Degestives' my mom used to make us. PS Used reg. milk as I do not stock soy.

Great basic recipe!  I used vanilla soymilk, and I added about a teaspoon or two of honey, and that gave it a very nice sweetness.  I might cut down on the salt a little bit next time, it tasted like a tad too much, but still good.  Instead of dropping spoonfuls, I just shaped into 8 biscuits and used them for mini-sandwiches (tuna salad), which worked nicely as a quick meal.  To the person that said it tasted like baking powder - you probably didn't cook it right...I'm not sure why that would happen....it's the correct amount for a typical biscuit recipe.

Great recipe- if you are worried about these being bland, just add 1 Tbsp of sugar.  I thought the texture was great with soup.

Very good.  I replaced the oil with butter - personal preference.  The biscuits had to cook for about 6 minutes longer than indicated.  Perfect compliment to the barley soup I made.

Oh my!  I found this great recipe when I did a search for whole wheat, egg-free biscuits for dinner tonight.  I wouldn't have expected them to taste so yummy, but they were really, really good!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for the addition of 3 tablespoons of sugar as suggested by another reviewer.

Excellent and simple recipe!  They baked up beautifully!  The salt seemed pretty excessive, though, thus the 4 stars.  I would recommend only using half of what it calls for.  However, I have played with it and even made a sweet little treat tonight by putting in 1/4 of the salt, and adding 1T sugar, and 1/4t cinnamon.  Like many have said, a great base recipe to play around with to suit your mood!

These are pretty average. They're great  as a starter biscuit and from here you can go ahead and add whatever you may want on your biscuit. However, as a stand alone, they're pretty bland.

These were light and fluffy, but a bit on the salty side.  I would cut back on the salt, maybe to 1/2-3/4 teaspoon.  I used 50/50 whole wheat/white flour (already premixed flour) and regular milk.  VERY easy though.  Also might add 1/2 cup oats next time.

I loved these biscuits! I only used whole wheat flour, which made them a little denser, so I increased the baking time slightly. They went great with soup.

I’m on the hunt for a good drop biscuit base for a project... anyway, drop biscuits were one of the very first things I learned to make as a teenager and so I have a vague memory of how they should be... MY FIRST ATTEMPT at this recipe I followed it exactly except I used olive oil, and ivory white whole wheat flour. The dough was crumbly so I ended up sort of patting it out and cutting little biscuits (I got 11) and they were absolutely pucks and a weird combo of bland and nasty (the latter likely due to the olive oil I was trying to use up... but you’ve been warned if you’re thinking about using evoo unless maybe you’ve got the extra light tasting kind- which I did not)...  MY SECOND ATTEMPT... a few moments later... I decided to try take two..  I did everything pretty much the same except upped the milk to 1 cup, used 1/4 cup melted Earth’s Best vegan butter sub in place of oil, added 2t of brown sugar and a little extra salt. This was the dough I remembered from my childhood... sticky and wet, and so I dropped them (got 12 this time) baked for 10 minutes at 420 degrees F and they are still bland but tender and a good start! Next time I’ll load up with garlic and herbs, drop into muffin cups to bake, and then when done & hot,spoon more melted butter on top (think Red Lobster cheddar bay biscuits without the cheddar... *drool*).

I use these as drop biscuits and also as dumplings in chicken and dumplings. They turn out great both ways. I use almond milk, though, because we don't care for soy.

Easy, peasy and so light and fluffy.  I substituted skim milk for the soy (allergic to soy) and they turned out really well.  We had these with my "clean the fridge out" soup and they were perfect.  I also using the last of my on-hand whole wheat flour - now it looks like I'll have to buy more.  Hub and I couldn't stop eating them.

So I'm doing that thing where I review a recipe with some changes. Sorry, but I wanted to tailor it to my meal and our diet. I made the following changes: 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1/3 cup total of equal parts natural applesauce and oil, and 1 cup skim milk (replacing, respectively, the flours, oil, and soy milk). I also added 1 finely chopped sweet onion. They were excellent- moist and flavorful, insanely fast and easy, and made great snacks for a few days. A definite make-again, and you could easily mix in some chopped dried fruit and cinnamon to turn this into a breakfast biscuit. SO happy to bring this into the mix!

I used this recipe for turkey dumpling soup. I didn't have any all purpose flour, so I used all wheat, but I added a couple tablespoons of vital wheat gluten to compensate. I made the dough and dropped it (in medium balls) on top of the soup, and they cooked beautifully. My husband isn't a fan of strong wheat flavor, but these were great and he loved them. Keeper!

So easy and delicious.  In the batch I just made, I used 1c whole wheat flour and 1c garbanzo-fava flour (gluten-free), adding some ground flax seed to 'bind' the gluten-free flour.  Also, I used 2 tbsp coconut oil and 2 tbsp vegetable oil instead of all canola oil, and vanilla almondmilk instead of soy milk, to produce a sweeter biscuit without added honey or agave nectar as I normally would.  The lighter-density gluten-free flour produced a fluffier, less rock-like biscuit, and the added sweeter ingredients were a perfect touch to mask the bean flour taste.  This fluffy, sweet batch was perfect with homemade peach-blackberry jam.  My co-workers agree, even the ones who are not very health-conscious thought it was great.  Thank you for a fantastic recipe!

I'll be honest, I had my doubts about this recipe.  I tried it out since I have both dairy and egg allergic kids.  I used olive oil instead of canola and I used coconut milk instead of soy.  They were actually pretty good - easy too!  Even my picky 2 year old who doesn't like anything liked it!  I served it with soup, they were enjoyed by all!

A healthier alternative to other biscuit recipes. The flavor will vary with your choices of ingredients. If using a soy milk that has been sweetened, the biscuit makes a good replacement for a shortcake and is delicious topped with sliced strawberries.

They're OK. I used all whole wheat flour and almond milk. They taste like maybe they need a little less salt or baking powder. But I'll try them again with a little honey in the dough since they were so easy and goes well with soup.

These biscuits turned out to be delightful. I used the recommended 1c. whole wheat flour but instead of using 1c. all purpose flour I used only 1/2c and also used 1/2c. milled flax seed. They had a nice nutty texture. Perfect with my vegan Gimme Lean "soysage" gravy!

Wanted to use these for bacon, egg, & biscuit sandwiches.   They tasted great!!  Very crumbly, mouth watering.  That was the only problem.  They practically fell apart, making my experience a little difficult.  I think it was, because I was out of butter, and substituted butter flavored crisco shortening.  Was also out of soy milk, and used 2% milk instead.

These biscuits turned out real good.  I used all white flour and regular milk.  However, I did not get 16 biscuits from the recipe - they would have to very small to get 16.  I made 6 large ones.  This one I will keep since I don't use shortening like other biscuit recipes use.

These were delicious!!  I actually used sour cream instead of soy milk, so I had to add a little skim milk but then it worked great.  Next time I'll try the flax seed, too.

Quick, easy, very very good for breakfast or super type meals. I used 1.5 c WW and .5 all-purpose flour.  My only substitution -because I had it - walnut oil.  A mild neutral tasting oil? shouldn't even notice? But WOW there must have been something synergistic going on - it added a wonderful very subtle nutty flavor.   Browned top and bottom and nicely moist inside.

These are great biscuits.  I used all whole wheat flour and I loved them.  I also added a dollap of honey.  My family was not as impressed as I was, so next time I'll use all purpose and whole wheat, as the recipe states.  I took another reviewer's advise and patted them out with a little flour then cut out the biscuits.  We had them with beef stew and they were great with the sauce.  This recipe is a keeper.

Great! I, too, added extra milk (I used whole cow milk), oil, and honey. I also added 1-2 Tbs garlic powder and 2 handfuls of shredded cheese. Yummy! Goes great with the chicken noodle soup I made for dinner! :-)

Very tasty, I made with 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 oat flour that I ground myself from rolled oats.  I also substituted olive oil for the canola.  The only bad side was it was a touch salty (but my son did add extra salt (he's 3!).  Very easy, great crumb, great to make with whole grains.  overall, wonderful and super easy and cooked up great, just like white flour ones do.

My family really enjoyed these, especially with honey on top!  I used regular 1% milk and added a T. of honey to the batter.  Easy and quick, and so much healthier than anything made with shortening.  Thanks for the post!

It's hard to believe all these reviews are for the biscuits that I made following this recipe.  I thought they were AWFUL--dry, tasteless and nothing but horrible round lumps of baked dough.  And they looked NOTHING like that picture.  Very deceiving. I was attracted to them because I am trying to incorporate more whole wheat into our diet, but I will go back to my old recipe and make my own adjustments.  Sorry!

Like the recipe, altho my biscuits still aren't perfect --it's a practice thing, I'm sure, not the recipe. I did used sweetened soy milk, probably not much difference. Anyhow,these are my tastiest biscuits yet!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great biscuits! I sub.ed 1/2 cup of oats for 1/2 cup of the all-purpose flour, used water instead of milk, and threw in some cinnamon-- they turned out really well and are delicious fresh from the oven with a bit of honey.

This is a great recipe.  It is so easy, which is great because my three year old loves to help in the kitchen.

These turned out yummy! I substituted an Oat Bran Blend (Hodgeson Mills) flour for the Whole wheat flour, made them more golden and a little sweeter. They don't puff up alot, but they are not heavy either. My kids and I ate them with strawberry jam for an afternoon snack -- they just disappeared. I dropped them by heaping tablespoon onto the cookie sheet and ended up with 12, not 16. My kids have asked me to make them again!

Very tasty! I used olive oil and added a teaspoon of sugar. These were great with vegan chili. Thank you!
