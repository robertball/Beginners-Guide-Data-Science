Family approved! absolutely delicious! I added strawberries to the top to make it taste even better. next time I'm going to add kiwi fruit either on top or in place of the bananas. Also, 4 bananas isn't necessary, 3 is plenty! Will definitely be making this often!

This is such a great desert. Simple and tasty. I make this for special occasions and it is always a big hit with no left overs. I generally will put toasted coconut on top instead of strawberries and we all really love it.

Made an Adult version, did not split the twinkles, after I layered them brushed som rum on top then followed the directions but added strawberries on top and sprinkled with chocolate syrup.
