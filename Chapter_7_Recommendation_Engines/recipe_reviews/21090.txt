The best vegetarian lasagne I've had. I made this with canned, diced sweet potato instead of pumpkin, which tasted great. Just great.

The recipe itself is delicious, however, the author states the prep time at only 15 mins.  If you include the peeling, dicing, grilling and roasting, the prep time easily advances to 1 hour.  Some places carry frozen pumpkin, and if you use that, you may cut down your prep time.  Also, I try to avoid all charred foods, so I didn't char the eggplant.  It was still tender and delicious in the lasagna.  The flavor/taste is five stars - prep time is three stars, so I compromised with a 4-star rating.

Rave reviews every time I make this recipe. I simplify by using no boil lasagna noodles, canned pumpkin and tomatoes. Also cut pesto to 1/3 cup and use a jar of my favorite four-cheese pasta sauce.

It was a great recipe, but I would recommend salting your eggplant and allowing them to sit for 30 min prior to preparing this mea.  It will take the bitterness out of the eggplant.

Family really enjoyed this one.

Thank you so much for this recipe!  This is one of the best things to come out of my kitchen ever!  I used butternut squash instead of pumpkin because I couldn't find pumpkin.  Plus, Trader Joe's sells the fresh squash already cut, so it saves on prep time.  I also used a little less feta (6 oz pkg).  I used Barilla no-boil lasagna, which worked great.  It turned out so delicious!

Wonderful rich flavour! I didn't have any eggplant so substituted sliced zucchini which I threw in with the pumpkin halfway through the roasting time.  I also sliced my tomatoes instead of just halving them.  Thanks Rosemary

This recipe was great!  Pumpkins aren't in season so i used yellow squash instead and it was awesome.  The eggplant and pesto really make this dish amazing.  i'll make it again but next time might make it in two smaller dishes and freeze one since it's a lot of food for one person.

I was true to this recipe and have absollutely no complaints. I thought cooking the tomatoes in the oven before hand definitely upped the flavor factor. I was leary about the pumpkin, but after the first bite, I was in heaven! And the ten other people that I made it for were  fighting over it! Thanks so much!

An original and tasty lasagna. The pesto makes it all!  A good way to use leftover pumpkin (even mashed pumpkin): it adds to the creamy touch of the lasagna and goes unnoticed. Try it, it will surprise you!

This is my favorite lasagna recipe, and I've been making it for years. I rarely can get fresh pumpkin, so I use butternut squash instead. I like my noodle layers to completely cover the layer below them, so I use three noodles per layer rather than two. Sometimes I add some sauteed chopped onions to the tomato layer.

My "improvement" to this recipe is to cut the cooked tomatoes and eggplant slices into bite-size pieces as I layer them into the casserole. I don't like huge chunks of veggies on my fork, because then that bite does not include the other flavors of cheese and noodle. With the smaller pieces of vegetables, every bite of the casserole includes the veggies and the sauce and the cheeses and the noodle. Yum! It also makes the lasagna neater to cut and serve.

My kids have moved out, but whenever they hear that I'm making this recipe, they beg me to make a pan for them. So, I usually make several pans at once. I made six pans last weekend. However, I only tripled the ingredients, rather than multiplying by 6, and used smaller baking pans. (Note: I use three noodles per layer rather than the two which the recipe calls for.) So, each pan holds four or five servings, rather than 8. That works better for us, and the fully assembled dish freezes beautifully.

i was very pleased with this sorta-veggie, sorta-not dish--i actually substituted ground beef for one of the cups of pumpkin (i.e. 1 cu. beef, 1 cu. canned pumpkin).  i also used more sauce and cheese than called for, and it was excellent!! i paired it w/ a ruffino chianti. will cook again.

This is fantastic!  I have never liked vegetarian lasagna and this can replace a meat one in my house any day.  I had a lot of fresh veggies from the CSA (community supported agriculture) that I'm a part of so I made some additions to the recipe.  I started by caramelizing half an onion sliced thin.  Added a package of sliced baby bellas and chopped up one bunch fresh spinach.  I roasted my eggplant 30 minutes in a 400 degree oven by first cubing it and sprinkling olive oil, minced garlic, salt and pepper on it and stirring it half way through.  Then mixed the veggies together to be my veggie portion.  I used home canned pumpkin and tomatoes in place of fresh and used no-boil noodles.  I mixed my tomatoes in with the tomato sauce to make it spread easier.  I also cut the feta down to 4 oz.  It was the perfect portion.  Note:  If you want this dish to be truly vegetarian you need to find feta that does not have animal rennet in it which is the stomach lining.

- used 30 oz can of pumpkin instead of roasting the veggie
- since tomato isn't in season, used 2 cans of "fire-roasted tomato" found near the diced tomato w/out the juice in the cans
- use the lasagna noodles that you just cook with the whole she-bang, no need for extra work
- you can prepare the whole thing the day before.  Cook for 25 minutes with foil on top (w/ a few holes to vent) and another 20 with foil off (to brown).  Let it sit 20 minutes to set.

I thought this recipe was just okay and "okay" includes the fact that I used very high end cheese, tomato sauce, and homemade pasta.  I didn't like the eggplant--it made it too wet.  I didn't think that the pumpkin added anything either.  If I made it again, I would substitute mushrooms for the eggplant and butternut squash for the pumpkin; however, I didn't love it enough to make it again.

This recipe is fantastic.  I have made it twice and it barely lasts 2 days.
Regarding a couple of the other comments here: I fried the eggplant (cut 1/4 inch thick as the recipe specifies) with NO OIL.  If you add oil then the eggplant will get soggy and it will destroy the texture.  I fried them for about 8 minutes on each side.  I also substituted butternut squash for pumpkin.  As another reviewer mentioned, you can buy it pre-cut from trader Joes or dice it yourself.  I had to bake them in the oven for longer than the recipe states to get the consistency I wanted (about 45 minutes.)  I do not suggest using canned pumpkin.  
Part of what makes this recipe so flavorful is the ricotta/feta/pesto mixture.  I used french feta (as it is sweeter) and high quality pine-nut pesto.  I made sure not to use any pesto with lemon in it.  And lastly I used heirloom tomatoes (as it is tomato season right now.)  You will need to wait for the juices to run out after baking the tomatoes but high quality sweet tomatoes really make a difference here.

I used sweet potatoes instead of pumpkin and zucchini instead of eggplant. The overall taste is very pleasant..a hint of sweetness. I love the roasted tomatoes as a layer. Very good. I will make this again.

I was looking around online for a good recipe for vegetarian lasagna and came across this one. I had never made it before so I wanted some guidance. This was a good base recipe (hence only 4 stars since I made some changes to it). It turned out great for my first try. The only negative I have is that I will say that prep time is way longer than what is listed on this recipe-I will definitely not be making this one during the week. I substituted butternut squash for the pumpkin, and added spinach, baby portabella mushrooms, onion, and garlic; as well as cottage cheese and cheddar cheese (both fat-free) and whole wheat noodles. Next time I think i'll try a few shortcuts like buying the vegetables already chopped, frozen chopped spinach, fire-roasted canned tomatoes, & no cook noodles to see if I can cut down on prep time or get someone to help with the prep. I might also use a little more sauce for that top layer. Good recipe though- thanks for putting this online!

HOLY COW! AMAZING! I used butternut squash in place of the pumpkin. BEST lasagna ever!!! Next time I might try subbing spinach for the eggplant and add some caramelized onions, just to change it up, but it's perfect the way it is.

This tasted nice, but there was way too much pesto. Use half or less of the recommended amount. I also used sweet potatoes instead of pumpkin, but remember it takes about double the cooking time.

Wow.  This was soooo good!  I love squash and pumpkin, and am always looking for creative ways to prepare them.  I made a few small changes, but for the most part, didn't deviate too much from the recipe.  

Instead of pumpkin, I used butternut squash, and mashed it slightly after roasting in a bit of butter.  Instead of just feta, I used a mix of feta and crumbled goat cheese.  I also added (as other reviewers did) a layer of caramelized onions and sliced baby bella mushrooms. I did double the sauce, which I am glad I did because my ricotta mix was a bit dry and I was worried that the no-boil lasagna noodles I used wouldn't soften properly without more liquid.  For the sauce, I made a tomato cream sauce, because I felt that it went better with the sweet flavor of the squash.  The last slight change I made was to wrap my pesto in lots of paper towels and squeeze the you-know-what out of it, which got rid of all that extra oil (probably why my ricotta mix was a bit dry).  The lasagna reheated really well the next day (might have been even better!).  Thanks for the recipe.

Whoever invented this recipe is a genius. Now, it is a pain to make, however, it freezes like a dream and if you plan right you can make a whole year's worth in a day (which was perfect for me since all my pumpkin, tomatoes, and eggplants came ripe on the same day...well, you know). Anyway, feel free to adapt as it can take it. I have done with and without pesto, have subbed straight basil and/or lemon basil for the pesto, have used acorn squash and/or butternut squash in lieu of pumpkin, have added more or less sauce and, finally, used regular ole' packaged lasagna noodles (not cooked) and every one of them has been fab. Don't be afraid of the work on this one, just plan ahead. It is really worth the trouble.

Very tasty, make sure pumpkin is cooked through before adding to lasagna.  Next time I'd dice all the veggies a bit smaller but otherwise this was great.

This was absolutely wonderful! My husband and ALL 5 kids (including 2-year old and 5-year old) loved it. The only changes I made were using butternut squash instead of pumpkin, and I added extra mozzarella & parmesan. It was a lot of prep work, but worth it. Will definitely make again.

This was good, and a nice change from the traditional lasagna.  I like it better than the typical white-sauce vegetarian style lasagna.  I used lowfat cheeses to make it a bit lighter.  I was disappointed that the pumpkin did not seem to add much.  All in all, it was good, but not outstanding, esp considering the cost of ingredients and preparation time involved.  Not sure if I'll make this again or not.

Absolutely fantastic! I used 1/2 (250 g.) the ricotta; basil pesto,; 1 egg; 1 26-ounce (737 g) pre-made pasta sauce in place of the tomato sauce; and no-pre-cooking-required lasagna noodles. I cut the pan into 12 squares, and each 12th was a generous serving. I might eliminate the eggs entirely next time. I sprayed the eggplant slices with non-stick before grilling---worked great! I also cut the tomatoes into several thick slices instead of just in half. With my variations, ended up being 7 WW points for one slice (15 for two).

Delicious. All the cheese makes these so yummy.I added a layer of cottage cheese too because my Gma used to do it and it is delicious. My kids really enjoyed it. I used a veggie mixture of zucchini, squash, broccoli, mushrooms, onion and garlic. I just used regular noodles, and boiled them to al dente before.

I made this for a vegetarian friend who came over for dinner.  I used yams instead of the pumpkin and absolutely LOVED this dish! I mixed the cubed yams with ricotta and it was great.

I'm trying the vegetarian thing for a month to see wether or not I like it. With recipies like this it makes the veg thing rock! This recipe is simple to make for "guys" starting out on the cooking thing. I made this for my wife and she loved it. Next time I make it I'll add portobello mushrooms and onions. The baked tomatoes aren't really needed and tends to make it more soupy.

Even though this may seem a little time consuming for a week day night, believe me its delicous.  I followed the recipe exactly, made an extra lasagna for the freezer also.  Even leftover heated up in the microwave still taste good.  I will certainly be making this again.

OMG, SOOOO GOOD. I Love making things with no meat when I can... This has sooo much flavor! I have to say, a lot of work but worth the time when you can! I didn't have pumpkin on hand, so I used butternut squash-yum.

Utterly delicious, but I gave it a four because it's so much work.  It took me hours, even though I did quite a bit of work ahead of time.  The next time I make this, I'm going to double and freeze it.  I used this to clean out my fridge.  I used half of a squash and a sweet potato.  I like this combo, it added a hint of sweetness and some creaminess to the ricotta mixture.  I used my homemade tomato sauce, which runs to very spicy, so it was a nice balance between the two tastes.  Next time, I won't even bother with dicing, I'll just bake the squash, mash it, and add it to the ricotta.  The pesto is a great idea.  It adds SO much flavor to the ricotta.  Sure, it's high fat, but it's lasagne!  Splurge a little.  The only other thing I did differently was salt my eggplants and let them sweat for a while.  Then, I dipped my eggplant slices in egg, then breadcrumbs, and baked them for a few minutes on each side.

This was great!  I used canned pumpkin instead of roasted and it turned out delicious! The only thing I will do next time is add a layer of carmelized mushrooms and onions, other than that it was fabulous--even with the one small change I made, I left the feta out because my husband won't eat feta (he doesn't know what he is missing!)Also, for those of you who couldn't find fresh pasta sheets, I use large wonton skins in their place (they also work great for making homemade ravioli!)--I usually find them on the produce aisle refridgerated.

So Yummy! I made this last night and its probably the best lasagna I've ever tasted! Although its a little extra work to peal, cut, and dice a pumpkin, it was well worth the effort; the pumpkin made the plate really special! If I could have changed anything, I would have added another thin layer of mozzarella earlier in the layering. All in All, this dish makes a super savory focal point in an autumn supper.

I make a mean homemade veggie lasagne, but this recipe kicks that one out of the water! I am not exaggerating, it is delicious! My partner said that if he was on a deserted island and could only bring one food item this would be it.

With that being said, I did substitute ricotta cheese for dry cottage cheese, simply because I prefer the texture.

This lasagna is a delicious veggie version. I used one 15 oz can of pumpkin instead of fresh, no tomatoes, low-fat ricotta 15 oz, 4 oz of non-fat feta instead of 9 oz, no eggs, and 9 sheets of barillia no-boil lasagna noodles. I also left out the mozzarella and parmesan.   It was delicious. If you make these changes the calories drop dramatically. I also cut it into 12 pieces instead of the suggested 8.   I "grilled" my eggplant on the stove in a pan that has the grooves a pannini grill would have.   Yum, excited to freeze and have many lunches out of this and a side salad.

This lasagna was really yummy but I made it with canned pumpkin pie filling because pumkins are out of season.  I think it would be better with the fresh pumkin.  Canned pumpkin made it feel too thick.  Next time I'd add more eggplant or other veggies to balance things out a little.  The recipe definitely took longer to prepare than the recipe states but it's well worth the effort! : )

Wow! I did not expect something soooo good from these unusual ingredients. I seldom make vegetarian meals but this was incredible.  I did make some changes though. I used 1% cottage cheese instead of ricotta and roasted red pepper pesto because I don't like basil. I didn'r have any mozzarella so I used Havarti instead.  Yummy!

When I first tasted it, I thought it was bland, but after a few bites, I was totally convinced.  Unfortunately for me, this recipe is so high-calorie I will have to reserve it for special occasions until I figure out how to lighten it up! I used all low-fat cheeses and divided into 12 servings (rather than 8) but it still came out as 10 Weight Watcher's points per serving.    I'm going to start with the suggestion of using fresh basil in place of the pesto (which was 30 points on its own!) and increasing the veggie-to-cheese ratio.

Excellent vegetarian lasagne, tangy and cheesy.  Did not change the recipe at all, except added 1 lb of already cooked and pureed pumpkin instead of diced, and used 10 lasagne noodles instead of pasta sheets.  We really enjoyed this dish and will make it again!

What an original, nutritious and delicious recipe! My teenage daughter raved about it. I didn't have fresh pasta sheets so I boiled the regular dried lasagna noodles. Also, pumpkin is not in season, so I used canned. I'm looking forward to fall when I can roast a small pumpkin for this- I think it will be even better.

The eggplant and tomato were delicious, but the overall taste did not "WOW" me. The ricotta/feta/pesto mixture was sort of brown and unattractive. I'm looking for a different vegetarian lasagna.

I did this as is (except for flubbing some of the measurements). It came out great. I had these pumpkins that I wanted to do something unusual (for me) with, so this was perfect. The pumpkin flavor is subtle but adds substance to every bite. I can't believe my husband had seconds immediately. He's soo picky!

Fantastic!  My whole family loved the flavor of this lasagna and I would make it again.  It does take a lot longer to prepare than stated.  I would say that after slicing, roasting and so on it was probably 1 hour of prep time.  I used no-boil lasagna noodles to cut back on some time.  I roasted the eggplant rather than charring or frying it and used butternut squash rather than pumpkin.  I didn't need any exta salt or pepper.  It was immensely flavorful on its own.

10 Stars! This lasagna is amazing. My DH looked at me like I was crazy when I opened a can of pumpkin for this recipe :o) Using the can of pumpkin was perfect and really saved a lot of time. I used a 24 ounce jar of tomato sauce with Italian sausage and left out the 5 fresh tomatoes since I didn't have any and sauteed a zucchini with the eggplant to make up for the missing volume. I also used fat free cottage cheese in place of the ricotta and I don't think this detracted from the flavor at all. My DH took one bite and said this is one of the best lasagnas he had ever eaten! I think in spite of the lower calories in this recipe, a lot of the flavor comes from the pumpkin and pesto mixture. I'm so excited that this recipe is so yummy since it has so many healthy vegetables in it and I'm always looking for new ways to incorporate pumpkin into our diet. Thanks again!!

Everyone gobbled this up. I used butternut squash instead of pumpkin. I really liked the fresh roasted tomatoes in it â€“ but peeled them when they came out of the oven because I donâ€™t care for the texture. The prep was a bit of work but the end result was delicious. Next time I will try some of the other reviewer suggestions such as adding spinach or using canned pumpkin to cut down on time.

I LOVE this recipe. It is so delicious and a great alternative to meat lasagna. 
I usually don't bother with the tomatoes- it makes the recipe a little more simple. Instead I just use some canned crushed tomatoes. I don't think they make the recipe that much better. Anyway, I really recommend adding this to your repertoire.

Wow, this recipe is great. It was the first lasagna that I ever made and it turned out great. I made the pesto myself with fresh basil and cilantro. I will definitely make it again.

From a dedicated meat-eater, this was wonderful!  I did use canned pumpkin, thickly sliced the tomato and allowed the eggplant to sweat before cooking.  I froze the leftovers and took them to work and it was even better.  Thanks!

My people loved it. I made lots of substitutions or additions (canned pumpkin, diced canned tomatoes, fresh basil instead of pesto, zucchini, japanese eggplant, cottage cheese instead of ricotta, omitted feta, used uncooked dried lasagna noodles) and it still turned out great! I browned the sliced zucchini and eggplant on a cookie sheet with some oil before I put them in.

I replaced the fresh pumpkin with canned to save time. I love that the feta/ricotta/pesto filling gives such great flavor to this recipes and makes you not miss the meat in the least.

This recipe was perfect!  My husband is not a fan of feta or ricotta cheese but absolutely LOVED this recipe.  I used yellow squash instead of pumpkin and it turned out great.  Would not change this one otherwise.  The pesto gives it great flavor.  I went low-fat on all the cheeses, but no one could tell.  GREAT recipe!!

This was really simple to make (aside from the time to cook). I didn't think the pumpking added much to it, or maybe it needs more than called for. However this was delicious even though I didn't have feta and used Pecorino instead. I recommend slicing the tomotoes after cooking (or before) because they are too large otherwise. Delicious.

Pretty good, though a lot of work. I would cut the pumpkin bigger and the tomatoes smaller (use plum tomatoes perhaps?).  Eggplant should be brushed with oil.  A good and different recipe to serve to my vegetarian daughter.

The only bad thing I can say about this recipe is it is time consuming - you have to chop/peel/cook the pumpkin, eggplant and tomatoes to even get started.  That said it's all worth it.  This is absolutely delicious.  I make it every fall at pumpking harvest time.

Wow! So good! This was the first time I've ever made a lasagna and I thought it was so easy and really pretty quick. I am not a vegetarian but don't always need meat to make me feel like I've had a meal so this was great! I've also never had eggplant before making this and it was delicious!! I couldn't find fresh pumpkin so just got a can of 100% pumpkin. Don't like tomatoes so I used 2 cans of tomato sauce (total) instead. Also added sautÃ©ed onions bc no lasagna is complete without onions. Other than those changes I kept everything the same. Had it for dinner last night and lunch again today. Even better today! I froze half of it so I'm hoping it tastes just as good when thawed. Someone said it was too expensive to make but it feeds a lot of people or makes many meals. Also I didn't think it was that expensive, only the cheeses were costly. Thanks so much for the great recipe. Will definitely be making this again!

This is really good!  The ricotta cheese and pesto mixture really made it for me. I did add carmelized onions and replaced the pumpkin with acorn squash. To make this five stars I would add more tomato sauce and add something for spice (crushed red pepper?).

Fantastic recipe, you really don't miss the meat and the pumpkin texture is great. I loved the pesto in the ricotta mixture, I had never tried that before and it elevated the flavors. I did cheat by using fire roasted diced tomatoes which I drained in place of the tomatoes. I diced my eggplant and roasted it in the oven with some olive oil. A nice addition to our vegitarian menu.

This is probably the best lasagna recipe with eggplant  (and first one with pumpkin) that I've ever tried and it was delicious! The only thing I did different, as suggested by another reviewer was to slice the tomatoes and bake them and I did slice some mushrooms and baked them along side the tomatoes before I added them to the lasagna. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

This was amazing and it served (held together) SO well for guests!  Everyone raved!  I used butternut squash since no pumpkins in season (baked 55 minutes at 350).  I weeped my eggplant for 20 minutes.  I used a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes rather than fresh.  I used Classico brand pesto & Barilla no-cook noodles.  I only used 1/2 C of parmesan and increased the shredded cheese slightly.  I meant to add sliced fresh mushrooms, but forgot.  Will make this again when squash & eggplant are in season and cheaper at the farmer's market!

Very delicious!  But I cheated and substituted pumpkin puree, which I think reduced the pumpkin flavor.  Next time I will use whole pumpkin so it will be chunkier, and hopefully have a more concentrated pumpkin flavor!  The recipe seems like should be a 5 star, but I think my modification makes it only a 4.

Delicious!  Everyone loved it.  I forgot to cut the tomatoes into slices (as suggested by another member) and will do that next time.  I ended up having to cut them after baking, because otherwise they were just too big.  Someone suggested I steam the eggplant first, so I peeled it (we've discovered we don't like the skin), sliced it, and steamed it for about 5 minutes before frying.  I don't know if it made a difference, but it certainly didn't hurt!  I also bought the wrong size feta container, but it still seemed to be plenty and didn't affect the taste.  One thing I noticed was that I thought there wasn't enough liquid/filling/cheese, and was worried about the outcome.  Nothing to worry about though, the liquid from the veggies made the consistency perfect.  Will definitely make again!

This was pretty darn good! I didn't have pumpkin, since its not in season, and used yellow squash like folks on here suggested, and it was so awesome, I must use more next time- my bf actually ate it, and he normally hates squash. :D I baked slices of squash in the oven, and layered them, rather than mixing them into the cheese. Frying the eggplant until very tender wasn't too hard, but I needed a little olive oil to do so, or it just charred and stayed hard. Didn't have pesto, but next time I will. The fresh tomatoes were great, but I might try canned next time to speed things up. Yum!

This recipe was excellent! I used sweet potato instead of pumpkin and used extra pesto, plus I substituted goat cheese for the feta. Also, I added spinach with the tomatoes.  The result was so so good, everyone loved it!  We ate it four days in a row ;)

Do not think that you should serve this to company... unless, of course, you're comfortable with licking your plate clean in front of friends and family.  We needed to use-up a pumpkin, and my mother was insisting upon pumpkin soup.  Being a leading opponent of pumpkin-soup-consumption, I fled to AllRecipes to find an alternative.  This was the winner, and my mother didn't complain about missing the soup, at all.  Fat free ricotta works just fine.  Making this with vodka sauce is even better!

One of the best lasagnas I've ever had. I used all fresh ingredients so it took me much longer than 15 minutes for the prep time, but if you use canned or frozen it is much easier. Next time, I will take the peels off of the tomatoes if I use fresh, because it was a little tough to bite through. I also cut the tomatoes into quarters, & they were still huge pieces. Everyone I made this for loved it. I will definitely make this again & again!

This was fantastic!  My boyfriend really enjoyed it.  We didn't have any pumpkin in season so I roasted acorn squash and substituted that instead.  It's a keeper!

I have been wanting to make a pumpkin lasagna for years and couldn't believe stumbling accross this recipe. It was amazing! My dad was a chef for 9 years and couldn't pinpoint the pumpkin till i pointed it out - the flavors were incredible and blended together so perfectly. I will make this again and again! I had to make two changes - I did only use the top layer of mozz (it got too big for my pan!), and i used canned pumpkin, and it was still so rich and creamy and delicious. Thanks so much for this recipe!!

Delicious--A huge hit with my family and dinner guests. I baked the eggplant rounds on a cookie sheet at 425 for 15-20 minutes, which is healthier than frying.  Next time I will make it with canned pumpkin, as the taste of fresh pumpkin is not worth the hard work of extracting it.

The adults in my family loved this recipe.  My small children could take it or leave it.  I used butternut squash instead of pumpkin and wished I had used more of it.  It added a nice touch of sweetness.  I made my own sauce from fresh tomatoes from my garden and it was fantastic.  I would recommend having some extra sauce on hand to pour over individual slices as desired, especially for the leftovers.  The consistency was perfect, not soupy at all, when first served.  But I found it dry the next day.  I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty lasagna.  The only problem I had was that I don't like charred eggplant.  So I ended up under-cooking it and even after the 45 min baking, it was still hard.  Make sure you cook it until tender during the grilling!  Otherwise, it had a really nice combination of flavors and there were very few leftovers!

I thought that I would mess this up for sure, but it came out great. I only put in 5 oz of feta and I added a little more eggplant and mozzerella. The whole family loved it!

Delicious!  I was looking for a way to make lasagna with eggplant and this more than passed my expectations.  I made a few slight alterations.  First, I cut the recipe in half but still used the same amount of lasagna noodles and used a 7 x 11 pan.  I didn't have fresh pumpkin and have never seen it canned so I used the pureed type and used almost a cup.  Also, I used cottage cheese in place of ricotta, a personal preference.  And I chunked the tomatoes after baking them.  My husband and I loved it, no big surprise, the kids wouldn't touch it, so plan to have something else for them.

Outstanding veggie lasagna! added a few more veggies (string beans, zucinni, shreded carrots) that were barely steamed. Added bag of frozen chopped spinach, sauteed onions & garlic, and some red pepper flakes to Ricotta. Used Classico Mushroom & Olive jarred sauce.

This was fantastic.  My non veggie husband really liked it.  I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and two cups chopped fresh basil plus five cloves minced garlic instead of pesto. I also used one can pumpkin and oven roasted the eggplant. It was very soupy right out of oven but all lasagna tends to be - didn't have time to wait for it to cool and it was still awesome!  My one year old dug it as well!

Divine! I used roasted butternut squash instead of the pumpkin, and I only had four tomatoes, so I added a jar of sun-dried tomatoes. It was awesome! I made it for the vegetarians at our Halloween pumpkin-carving party, and it got rave reviews. Very rich. It's very rich.

I used canned pumpkin and whole grain pasta and they worked fine. I also used part skim cheese. It took me a while to prepare, but it was not hard to cook extra eggplant, etc so that I could make 2 pans at once and freeze one--I'm looking forward to eating the next pan with no work involved.

Great Base for a vegetarian lasagna but would have been too bland if made as is.    Required more direction also.  Thanks to the previous reviews and suggestions I did not make the recipe as is.  Would have been a waste of time and $.

My guests went for second helpings and had it for lunch next day and were happy to take home a serving for later.
Did not have pumpkin so used Butternut squash cut into 1/2" cubes tossed in 1 Tbsp of olive oil, set it in a cast iron frying pan and roasted it in the oven stirring occasionally until tender.
While the squash was roasting I cut 5 large tomatoes into 1/3" slices and set on a lightly oiled heavy cookie sheet and roasted for 15 minutes and for the Eggplant I sliced a medium one into 1/3" rounds and cooked in cast iron frying pans with some olive oil until they were tender and cooked through - not charred.  That would have produced some tough pieces.
I cut the pesto back to half a jar of Classico pesto, about 1/2 cup any more would have been overpowering.  It seemed the right amount flavour wise and for the visual the cheese filling was still appealing.
For more flavour I substituted a 650 ml jar of  Classico tomato basil pasta sauce instead of canned tomatoe sauce.  For additional flavour I  sprinkled 1 tsp of dried oregano over the roasted tomatoe slice layer in the dish.
The cheese filling is so good in this dish and the tenderness of the fresh pasta makes it so much better.
Definitely going to make it again with revisions.

I used canned sweet potatoes instead of pumpkin and it was really good. The only thing i would do differently is to dice them smaller.  EXCELLENT recipe.  My visiting family loved it.  Great way to use pesto as well.

This was one of the best lasagna's I've ever had / made.  I used no-boil noodles - was nervous about not having enough sauce but it came out perfectly.  I used butternut squash instead of pumpkin, which was perfectly great.  Also, I sliced the tomatoes instead of halving.  Truly a great dish; received great reviews from the family!  Pesto makes it really special.

I made the recipe following it closely (but used butternut squash instead of pumpkin). The 5 star part of the recipe was the ricotta-squash-pesto mixture which was beyond delicious, but I thought when combined with the eggplant and halved tomatoes (I used romas), that these extra ingredients didn't work together (so minus 2 stars since these were major components of the dish).  For the butternut squash, I cubed the fresh squash and tossed with olive oil, salt, pepper, and some dried sage and then roasted in the oven for about 30-40 minutes.  For the pesto, I made a fresh arugla pesto with toasted pine nuts, garlic, and olive oil.  I would make a variation of this recipe again with some changes. For the halved fresh tomatoes, I would use canned Italian or fire-roasted flavor diced tomatoes. I would leave out the eggplant entirely, and maybe use zucchini instead.

Very tasty lasagna, and also a nice change from the usual baked pasta dishes. I used butternut squash instead of pumpkin, and next time I would use more of it because it really added nice flavour. It takes a long time to make, much longer than indicated. But at least it is very easy to make. It is an expensive recipe, but it provided my husband and me with 3 meals each, which in the end made it a pretty good deal.

My husband I thought this was great and he's not a fan of eggplant or sweet potatoes. So yes, subbed sweet potatoes for the pumpkin, used lasagna noodles, canned fire roasted tomatoes and homemade pesto. It was so flavorful. My husband had to add salt, but I thought it was fine without. I only wished my kids would have enjoyed it more. We're trying to eat less meat here so I'm sure I'll make this again.

OMG so gooooood! I made it as directed (except used acorn squash and oven ready noodles) and love, love, love it. My husband, my two year old, and my 8 month old... we all loved it. And I don't like eggplant or squash at all!! Thank you.

We love this recipe.  Substituting a can of pure pumpkin puree works perfectly for the roasted pumpkin, and substituting a can of plain stewed tomatoes (roughly chop before adding) for the fresh gives a great taste as well.  The substitutions only pare down preparation time, yet still have great flavor.  Excellent dish.

This was sensational, although extremely fattening! Oh my, the grease was oozing. It is very rich and yummy.
I did add some cream to my red sauce, used zucchini instead of eggplant, and canned pumpkin but didn't change anything else.
It is a timely recipe to make, so definitely a treat. My family (8 of us) ate it all up.

Like some of the other reviewers, I used canned pumpkin and tomatoes to simplify. I am not really an eggplant fan, but this lasagna was great! It has a very creamy taste, but isn't bland- plenty of unique flavors! I forced some friends who were disgusted by the thought of "vegetarian" lasagna to try it, and the carnivores were quite impressed!

Very tasty!  I used canned pumpkin, drained can of tomatoes, and substituted a mix of mushrooms/onions/and peppers that I stir-fried for the eggplant (can't convince the rest of the family to eat eggplant even though I think it would have been great).  Was pretty easy to put together, great leftovers - definitely will make again!  Thanks!

Yum Yum Yum!!!! I'm teaching in Korea and one of my friends requested that I make a veggie lasagna so I chose this one.  I was able to get most of the ingredients at the foreign market here.  I made some changes but i kept the "heart of the recipe" the same--- the ricotta-feta-pumpkin-pesto filling.  I'm glad I made myself a small one in addition, otherwise...the one I made for my friend would not have made it to her...haha.  It was well-received by my teacher friends.

i made this for a party & it was a huge hit!  i used canned pumpkin, left out the tomatoes (birthday boy doesnt like them), roasted the eggplant in a 400 degree oven for 30-40 min & added mushrooms & onions to the eggplant.  next time i am going to use the ricotta filling as a raviolo or mannicotti filling, it was SOO good!

This was a great base for a veggie lasagne.  I departed from my mother's recipe for traditional lasagne to make this, and I don't think my household appreciated it...  

But at any rate, I made some changes to this recipe.  I used canned pumpkin instead of fresh (two cans was too much!), and added cremini mushrooms and artichoke hears (because I had them in the pantry). I roasted the eggplant, mushrooms, and tomatoes together before adding them.

I will have to chop the veggies up even smaller next time for it to be perfect.  

Great recipe!

I hosted an autumn dinner party recently,  and we have some vegetarian friends - so I gave this dish a try, it was a hit!  Trust me, between the delicious cheeses and the eggplant, you won't miss the meat in this lasagna.

Just delicious! Takes a bit of work but it's worth it! I used yams instead of pumpkin as someone suggested. A great way to get more veggies into the diet. To "lighten" it I used cottage cheese in place of ricotta. Doesn't sit quiet as heavy and it melts the same.

excellent. I would give it six stars if I could. Here are the changes I made, zuchinni instead of eggplant and cottage cheese, garlic + basil instead of pesto.
I recommend cutting the veggies smaller because the pan was overflowing in the oven.

After reading the other reviews, I was expecting heaven on a plate.  It wasn't quite THAT wonderful, but it was pretty good.  I made a few adjustments.  First, I accidentally bought diced tomato instead of sauce.  So, I pureed the cans of diced tomato in the blender.  It looked a little watery but after baking it was fine.  Instead of halving the fresh tomato, I sliced them and roasted them like that.  Also, I couldn't find fresh pasta sheets and just used traditional lasagna noodles.  Finally, it would have taken more work but I wish I had made fresh pesto instead of buying it in the jar.  It would have really enhanced the flavor.

This is fantastic!  The only things I'd change is to use a bit less pesto and use diced tomatoes intead of the halves.  It also took me an hour to prepare it...but it was worth it :)

Made this for Christmas Eve and it was a hit!  I followed some of the advise of previous reviewers and sliced the tomatoes instead of just halving them before roasting.  Also prepped the eggplant (to avoid bitterness) by salting the slices and letting them sit for an hour, then rinsing well and patting dry before cooking them.   I didn't have fresh pasta sheets so cooked lasagna noodles and used about half a package.  Also used marinara instead of canned tomato sauce.  Everything else was done per the recipe and it was terrific.  Will definitely make this again!

I will so make this again!!!  I love it!  I wanted use up 2 eggplants so I increased ingredients, but not proportionally.  I added 3 cups of butternut squash and three tomatoes (I did not have the required five).  I did not have ricotta so I made a bechamel sauce.  Swore blind that I had pesto (grrrrr!), but ended up making one from scratch.  No feta so I put some cheddar cheese instead.  I also had no grated parmesan.  (Not a problem as I am lactose intolerant and it may have taken me over my limit!)   I did not add the salt and pepper to taste as the bechamel and pesto were already seasoned to taste, the lasagna noodles were boiled in salt water and the eggplant was degorged  for 15 minutes before dry frying.   Yummmy!!

Canned pumpkin used; based on other reviews sweet potato could be substituted.

I must not have grilled the eggplant long enough, because it was tough and chewy.  The pesto was a bit overpowering.  I would suggest adding half of what is recommended.  It doesn't say to slice the tomatoes after roasting, but I did.  I think the recipe has potential and with a few tweaks would be good.

Very, very good!  I used cubed, frozen butternut squash, my own roasted cherry tomatoes, and lasagna noodles.  I also followed  another reviewer's suggestion and cut the eggplant into smaller pieces after grilling it.  I will for sure make this again soon!

Excellent tasting lasagna! I did fresh zucchini instead of eggplant. Unfortunately, the structural integrity was not good. Not sure what made it so soupy (my guesses are not draining the ricotta, using fresh mozzarella instead of shredded, and too-juicy farmers market tomatoes), but it basically had no ability to stand up on its own. Still delicious, though.

Terrific!  I didn't have every ingredient, so mixed ricotta with cottage cheese, and I didn't have the feta.  I grilled the eggplant (excellent), and used butternut squash cubed instead of pumpkin.  Flavorful and hearty!

Wow. Just wow. This is one of the best lasagnas I've ever had, vegetarian or non. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the prep time is closer to an hour than fifteen minutes, but it's worth it.  Roasting the vegetables makes them so sweet and full of flavor. Great, great recipe.

I feed this to non-vegetarian friends and they don't even ask where the meat is. I use yellow squash instead of pumpkin. It takes about 30 minutes of prep if you sear the eggplant while the squash/tomatoes are roasting. Make sure to cook the eggplant till it is very brown as it keeps it from getting soggy while the lasagna is baking.

This is actually a really good and easy basic veggie lasagna recipe.  You can use any veggies you have.  I didn't have egglant or pumpkin so I used butternut squash, green peppers and sliced tomatoes.  roasted them all on a cookie sheet and layered with the cheese/pesto mixture.  topped with tomatoe slices and mozzerella.  really good and I love the additon of butternut squash/pumpkin.  makes a different and tasty lasagne.

It didn't say what type or size tomatoes & to only cut in halves I thought were to large. I didn't care for it.

This took a lot of time to prepare with all the chopping and cooking of the separate ingredients.  It turned out great but just keep in mind that 15 minutes for prep is about 1/8th the time you will need (in the least) to get this all ready and put together.  I thought all the seemingly incongruent ingredients might taste odd together but there was a nice merging of flavors.  Thank you for the recipe!

Excellent recipe.  My new favorite recipe from Allrecipes.com.  Thank you BLACK_CAT52.   I will admit I was a little skeptical with some of the ingredients (i.e. pumpkin?), but after reading all the rave reviews I gave it a try.  Yum-O!  Only change I made was to substitute the pumpkin for butternut squash, which I bought already diced in the produce section.  Will be making this one again for family and friends!

This was amazing! I used "oven ready" lasagne noodles, Butternut squash instead of pumpkin and zuccini instead of egg plant because that was what I had in my garden. Also used Italian Parsley pesto because we had some made from the garden as well. Everyone loved it!!

Labour-intensive, but worth the work!  Instead of pumpkin, I used butternut squash, pre-cut from the grocery store to make life a little easier.  I made the pesto from scratch, and used oven-ready lasagne noodles.  With respect to the eggplant, I fried it in a wok until the "rounds" no longer resembled "rounds".  (I've never cooked with eggplant, and didn't really know what I was doing!)  Still turned out sooooo well.  I can't wait to share this one with my extended family!

I would have given this recipe top marks if you had put mushrooms in it.
Get your self some large  mushrooms leave them whole and fry them in butter until just about cooked then make a layer of them in the lasagna. Cheers from New Zealand

Lovely and fresh lasagna sheets definitely much better than the dried stuff.  This recipe can also be made with roasted butternut squash.........in the same manner as the pumpkin.

Simply stellar!  We used extra pumpkin and eggplant when we made it, and tried to find lower-fat cheeses.  It was just fantastic.  Definitely worth the time it takes to make it.

So, So good. My husband, someone who has to have meat for dinner all they time, love it too. I used butternut squash, couldn't find a pumpkin. I have to say I was very impressed. My eggplant was huge so I had to layers of eggplant. The first layer, I added the extra squash I did't put in the cheese mixture. And teh secong layer of eggplant was with the tomatoes. I couldn't believe how good this was. However, it did take longer then called for. My squash took almost an hour, and the lasagna it's self took about the same. That's because I don't pre-cook my noodles. Or use oven ready. All that means, takes a little extra time. Remember to cover the lasagna for most of the cooking. You don't want to burn the cheese on top. I took it off for the last 15 min. The cheese browned perfect!!

Although I did not follow the recipe exactly, this recipe serves as a great base recipe for vegetarian lasagna!  For my lasagna, I used eggplant, zucchini, tomatoes, and spinach.  I also only used ricotta and feta and did not use any other extra cheeses as it is much too rich for my liking.  This was my first time making a lasagna and it definitely was a hit!  Next time I will use the intriguing ingredient of pumpkin if I have it on hand.

This was so delicious!! I couldn't find pumpkin so I used sweet potato. I didn't boil my noodles either...just seal the lasagna tightly with foil while cooking. I'm amazed everytime I make this, it's so good. Try it without making changes!!

I love this recipe!!! I made it for a dinner party and it got RAVE reviews...a definate do-again!! For the pesto I used "The Best Pesto Ever" recipe which really was the best pesto ever. I will agree with others that the prep time does take longer than what it states in the recipe. Also, I used butternut squash rather than pumpkin. Delish!!

This was very yummy and gets 5 stars for the taste! The prep time is WAY off which I knew from other reviews. I spent at least 75 minutes in prep and a lot of work and that's why only 4 stars.

I had pumpkin, tomatoes and eggplant from the garden and pesto from basil in the garden. 

I did salt the eggplant and let it sit for close to 30 minutes before frying it which was not in the directions.

This recipe will definitely be a special occassion recipe in our house, but not a staple because of the work required but I may roast some extra pumpkin for the freezer!

This was soooo good!  I made it in order to use up some pasta sauce I had.  I maybe did this the lazy way, since I just used canned pumpkin, and I added sundried tomatoes into the ricotta mixture instead of using fresh tomatoes.  All my roommates loved it!  I also made pasta using the "Basic Pasta" recipe from this website also.  Overall, it was really easy, and very inexpensive!

It was pretty good. The 3 star rating was the time involved, even with all the short-cuts. The other part of the rating was the cost of the ingredients. I will say that I am probably biased bc I've had probably 15 different lasagnas, so my palate is kinda snobby.

This was very good.  I took the advise of some who had made this previously and added cream to the tomato sauce.  I also used butternut squash instead of pumpkin...delicious...I should have doubled the amount of squash.  To me it made the lasagna distinctive.  Also it needed more eggplant.  I didn't use roasted tomatos because of the expense...I hope it wasn't a mistake.  Overall, the dish was fabulous!

This recipe was a big hit for Thanksgiving. Works nicely as a vegetarian entree, and the meat eaters can have some as a side dish. 

Was also very tasty for leftovers.

OK- We picked out the eggplant- I guess we're not fans. Other than that, the dish was rich and tasty. I did sautee the eggplant (diced) with a diced sweet potatoe -which was VERY good in it and and onion. Maybe roasting the eggplant would have been better, but I believe this is the first time I ever cooked eggplant. DH, 3 kids and I picked it out. We had an extra teenager over, who is VERY picky- no veggies- and she LOVED it! Go figure.

My husband, who does very little cooking, made this for our cooking night with pumpkin being the theme.  I helped him a little, but he did the majority of the work, except clean up :) He used canned pumpkin, instead of fresh and I wasn't able to find fresh pasta sheets.  I would strongly recommend to slice the tomatoes, they were just way to big.  I would also slice and quarter the eggplant.  My husband wanted to give it only 3 stars, but I gave it 4, because it was tasty and with a few changes, it could be even better.

This was OK for my first veggie lasagna. I left out the pumpkin, but I thought the pesto was a nice touch and a good variation.
