Being the first to rate this recipe I really tried to stay true to the directions. I didn't need a full 1/4 cup of olive oil for cooking the veggies and used the same pot. 1/4 cup just isn't very much of each vegetable and so I used whole small bell peppers, 1 small sweet onion and a good 1/2 cup or more of mushrooms chopped and fresh minced garlic and oregano. I'm glad I did or I think the tomato taste would have over powered the dish. That said this was a very nice tasting shrimp dish, had the nice Italian flavoring and yet a spicy zing to it. I did omit the salt since I watch my salt intake.  I think some feta cheese would make a nice addition to the dish.

My son said it was a keeper,husband and daughter said no, and for the effort, I agreed.  We had Arrabiata spaghetti sauce the night before I made this recipe.  So family thought I had just used another jar of spaghetti sauce in lieu of this sauce.  Sooo unfortunately for a busy mom the store bought sauce wins.
