Incredible!  I made this in a bundt cake pan, spraying the pan with nonstick/flour spray, sprinkling chopped nuts into the bottom before putting in part of the batter... then using the "streusel" portion of the recipe (omitting the butter) mixed with 1-2 Tbsp. cocoa powder as 2 separate "layers" between the batter (pour in some batter, sprinkle streusel, more batter, more streusel, and top with the last of the batter.  I baked it at 350-degrees for an hour, with no other adjustments for high altitude (we're at 7220-ft).  When it's cut, the streusel inside made it look like it was a lot more work than it really was.  This really beats banana bread for using up some very ripe bananas!

I have to say, these really are one of the prettiest muffins I've ever made. I followed the recipe as close as I could having cut it in half. I did add 1/2 c. chopped roasted walnuts, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and I skipped the topping and just sprinkled the tops with cinnamon/sugar. I think these are a little too sweet but the flavor is the best I've had in a banana muffin. This was right on with cooking time and amount of muffins made. I think this recipe would be perfect with the sugar cut in half and my small adjustments. NOTE: This muffin recipe didn't overflow in my muffin tins like I've had happen with other recipes. I filled each muffin tin with an overflowing 1/4 c. of batter. EDITED: I have made this muffin recipe three times since first reviewing it. It has become our favorite banana muffin to date. I did cut back the white sugar to just under 1/4 c. and added one more banana, chopped TO HALF A RECIPE'S WORTH. The toasted walnuts I added really make this stellar.

These are cupcakes, not muffins, and they are fabulous. I reduced the white sugar, and made my own spiced rum by mixing Mount Gay rum with a little vanilla and allspice. The next time I make these--and there will definitely be a next time--I will cut the cinnamon in the streusel topping in half. Serve these as a dessert or with afternoon tea, not breakfast!

These muffins were ridiculously sweet.  I even left off the streusel topping and it was still too sweet.  But the banana rum flavor was delicious.  I would make these again but I need to play with the amount of sugar.  These would be great with some walnuts.

Great flavor, but tooth-achingly sweet even after cutting back the sugars a bit. Bananas are one of the most sugary fruits, not to mention the rum's sweetness. What I used this time: 1/2 brown, 1/4 honey, 1/2 white, 1/2 brown. What I'll use next time: 1/2 brown, 1/4 honey, 1/4 white, 1/4 brown.

My kids and I loved this recipe. It got rid of a lot of yucky old bananas and the booze didn't intoxicate the children. Perfect on 2 counts LOL!

Found these a bit too sweet.  I'd cut down on the sugar next time - or omit the topping.  Rum flavour is enjoyable.

Awesome banana muffin, lots of banana flavor!  Love using spiced rum.  Make the streusal before you mix the muffin batter, so you don't lose any leavening power. I topped the stresal with sliced almonds before baking. Yummy.  Also, if you make your own spiced alcohol from cheap vodka or whatever is on sale, the flavor is much stronger and you won't need to add powdered spices. This trick is good for lots of recipes, epecially pumpkin pie!

I just baked these for dessert.  Changed just a few things.  I only had 3 very ripe bananas so I halved the whole recipe.  I also didn't have the spiced rum so I substituted apricot brandy. I used my 6  bundt pan (small bundts). Sprinkled chopped walnuts in and then half the batter in each, then the crumb topping (minus the butter, but added a few walnuts instead) then the rest of the batter over the six bundts. Baked for 25 minutes.  My boyfriend who HATES bananas and doesn't care for any type of nuts, thought they were great!  This is a keeper. Thanks

Double Yum! This is like Bananas Foster in a muffin. I didn't have spiced rum on hand, so I took the recommendation of the other reviewer and substituted with a little vanilla and some allspice and it worked out great. This one goes into the permanent file.

OMG!!! What a great muffin. or cupcake. Whatever is was it was amazing. I have done it twice, first time I didn't have any cognac so I used all spiced rum and the 2nd time I found my cognac and did the recipe as stated. I had some cinnamon sugar to use up so I sprinkled the tops with some of that. After they were cooled I made a butter-cream cheese icing with a couple of tbsp of icing sugar and a tsp of lemon juice. A quick swirl of icing made these fabulous! This is my new go to recipe to use up those bananas.

I also cut the sugars about in half.. I used brandy and malibu rum as the alcohol ingredients, and subbed some yogurt for the butter because i was nearly out of butter, and to make them a little healthier. YUM YUM! I made mine as mini muffins:) I am not even a banana bread lover, but these smelled amazing as they bake, the rum, banana and coconut essence in the malibu rum made them smell deliciously tropical!

Absolutely delicious!  These were a big hit with everyone!  I upped the 1/3c. brown sugar to 2/3c.  Also used 1/4c. brown and 1/4c. white instead of the 1/2c. brown sugar.

LOVE these muffins! They are sweet but I didn't find them too sweet at all. I'm also lazy and just sprinkled cropped almonds on top instead of the suggested topping so that may have reduced the over all sweetness. I get requests for them all the time!

My fiance and I made these muffins over the weekend and they turned out absolutely perfect!  We literally couldn't stop eating them. I walked some to my neighbors next door when they were still warm out of the oven and they said they were so good, they wanted the recipe.  Even a few days later, they are still as fresh as the day we made them.  I highly recommend this!!

Yummy!  They are lighter than banana bread, and the liquor gives them a different taste.  From now on my ripe bananas will have to be split between Janet's Rich Banana Bread and this recipe.  Just delish!

Outstanding recipe, but I made them with one twist.  I replaced the cognac and rum with an equal amount of Jameson's whiskey to add an Irish touch.  Slainte!

The taste of these were AMAZING!!!  The best banana bread/muffin/cake I have ever made.  I didn't have any spiced rum, so I used whiskey and added 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  A lot of other reviewers questioned the amount of sugar and I didn't realize until I was putting it together just how much is in the recipe (1.5 cups white, 2+ cups brown).

I am wondering if anyone else's muffins ended up kind of like brown sugar/caramel lava cakes?  And I don't know if I over mixed the batter or something, but I had enough for 24 muffins and a small 6"x6" cake.

Most who have reviewed this has stated these muffins are really sweet and they are right.  I believe I will also cut down on the sugar a little bit next time.  I didn't have the cognac, but the taste of the spiced rum on its own was good. They did have a little bit more of a spongy cake like texture, but still good.

I'm always looking for muffin recipes with a twist of the unexpected and this one was a delicious twist. I cut back on the amount of sugar, substituted Jim Beam for cognac and will probably omit the topping the next time I make them. They didn't need anything extra to make them a memorable muffin.

Yum. Yum. Yum!  I halved the recipe, 24 muffins was way too much for my meager banana supply, and used all ingredients as listed... these are absolutely delicious, and a perfect way to use up overripe bananas and the cognac that noone drinks!  That's all for now, I have to get another one for my 2 year old!

These are the best banana muffins I've ever had!  After reading all the reviews, I decided to cut back on the sugar... for instance instead of packing the brown sugar into the measuring, I just loosely spooned it in, and not all the way to the top.  Used about 3/4 of the honey, same with the white sugar.  Also, replaced the cognac with brandy, and instead of cinnamon, I added about 1/4 cup of finely chopped and toasted walnuts.

These were a hit from the first time I made them. Hanging on to this recipe! I did sub (any) brandy for the cognac since that's what I had.

These would have been great, but much too sweet in my opinion. I might try these again With half the sugar.

These muffins are delicious. They take time to make I suppose but are worth it. I have made banana bread many times but I like all the ingredients in this recipe.

Delicious.  I ran out of brown sugar before I could make the streusel topping, so I substituted 1 c white sugar and 2 tbsp molasses. The taste was good but the streusel topping was too moist and sunk into the batter.  Next time I will make sure I have enough brown sugar on hand.

I decreased the white sugar and mixed the wet and dry ingredients separately like in some basic muffin recipes and these were still very, very good.

I'm sorry - I was disappointed with this recipe.  It was more work than the average muffin recipe, and the end result was a chewy (rather than moist) texture and overly sweet flavor.
