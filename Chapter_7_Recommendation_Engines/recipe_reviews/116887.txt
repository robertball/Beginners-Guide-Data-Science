Pretty good - my wife really liked it. I did this straight from the recipe; I think next time, I'll drop the poultry seasoning and go with  minced garlic, a bit of cayenne, and a splash of worchester sauce.  Good basic low carb recipe.

This was pretty good. Made exactly as written. I would make it again but would add a few more seasonings, a little less water and an extra carrot. Thanks!

Very easy to make and very much a comfort food! I was skeptical of the ingredients at first with gravy and cheddar together but it turned out great! My husband like it immediately and asked what was in it. He even requested it be made again which next time I will play around with the seasoning like use Montreal Steak Seasoning for a different kick.

Like beef stew? Like salisbury steak and gravy and potatoes? Then this is the perfect dish for satisfying those cravings. This was great! I used frozen sliced carrots and canned potatoes. I didn't have poultry seasoning so I used a little sage and rosemary. My package of gravy mix called for 2 cups of water so that is what I used. I didn't have onion so I used a half can of french onion soup that I had left over in the refrigerator. I wasn't sure about the cheese on top, but it went well in the dish and I think you could leave it off and it wouldn't make or break this dish. Pretty much this was just beef stew in a skillet. We had a great meal, thanks I am definitely going to fix this easy meal again and again!

HHHMMM Good!  I am sure it is fabulous the way the recipe is, but I took the advice and used minced garlic and cayene pepper and it was wonderful.  Also, I used onion soup mix because I didnt' have brown gravy mix in my pantry.  Great dinner and quick.

Very easy! It took a little longer to cook than expected.  I think next time I will add a little sour cream.

I was disappointed in this. I followed the recipe except I didn't have a packet of gravy mix. I used a jar of gravy and eliminated the water. When done, I tasted it and added salt and some worchestershire sauce. This made it edible. I won't be making this again.

Work 2-10pm, time to give my faithful crockpot a break,  Picked this recipe because of basic ingredients and being a one pan meal. Mylove called me at 6pm to tell me to add it to the "keeper" list...first time he has ever done this! Followed recipe and added a dash of worchestershire sauce, a sprinkling of cayenne pepper and substitued 1 tsp of minced garlic instead of the poultry seasoning.  Mylove turned it on low to warm up half an hour before he was ready to eat....

Needed a hamburger recipe since we were tired of burgers and tacos.  Made this gluten & dairy free using an envelope of onion soup mix instead of gravy mix, dairy free cheddar cheese slices and added corn elbow macaroni instead of potatoes (husb has high glucose and tators are a no-no).  Carrots and onions looked nice and whole family enjoyed.  Will be making this again!

At the suggestion of another, I sub. garlic for the poultry seasoning & added some worcestershire sauce & cayenne pepper . My hubby ate 3 servings!!! And he is not a huge guy! He loved it.
