Used fresh spinach, frozen matchstick carrots and sliced squash.   Turned out great.

Loved it! However, I had to make it my own. Did not use any canned vegetables, I used all fresh vegetables: shredded carrots, kale, & baby spinach leaves. My kids actually liked.

Made this for the first time for family- they loved it.  Some like it better than my regular lasagna. I would just use fresh basil, spinach, and carrots next time.

I added broccoli- mixed it to carrots and garlic- and stirred it into the white sauce. This was a separate layer from the ricotta spinach and zucchini. And I added tomato sauce - delicious!
