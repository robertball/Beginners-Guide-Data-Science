AWESOME!!!  I love sausage gravy with biscuits but I didn't have any sausage so I decided to try your recipe.  It is incredible.  I think I'll be making this instead from now on.  The only think I added was a bit of chopped garlic.  Because garlic makes everything better....:)

Funny, my Dad's been making this for my sister and I since we were kids. Now, I make it for my boys. And they can't get enough of it. I used beef bouillion and cut back a little on the milk and used sour cream, just for a touch of creaminess. I like to add a little worchestershire and a drained can of sliced mushrooms. My whole family loves it and I get to smile and remember my childhood. ;)

Another quick and very easy dinner to whip up.  I didn't have 2 lbs of ground beef so I used  a combination of beef and ground "sage"  sausage.  In place of raw chopped onion (kids don't like) I used 1/2 a packet of lipton dried onion mix.  I wanted to add more flavor to the gravy so in place of  ALL 5 cups of milk I used 2 cups evaporated milk, 1 cup low sodium  boxed beef broth, 1 cup of water and 1 cup regular milk.  Served over egg noodles and/or biscuits.  I had 2 extra kids tonight for dinner and they all wanted seconds!!!  Good thing this is one of those dishes you can continue to add liquid and flour to make more servings!!

This was SO good!  It was so good infact that I joined this site so I could post a review.  I'm from the south and I've ate hamburger gravy since I was little and have been making it for MY family for years, but never with milk ...I love milk gravy, we use that for sausage gravy, chicken fried steak, etc. but never with hamburger meat, it was delicious!  I ran out of milk so I used canned evaporated milk instead (one can milk to one can water to make whole milk, but had to use 2 cans to get the 5 cups) and it turned out wonderful, I also added about 4 tablespoons of beefy onion soup mix ( that i make myself) in place of the chicken boullion.  Such a great recipe, thank you for posting it. This is now my new hamburger gravy recipe!! :o)

I've made a similar recipe for years. Here's a tip for you: after frying the onions, I also add fresh or canned  sliced mushrooms to the pan. Remove mushrooms and melt 1/3 c. butter and 1/4 c. flour, cook the butter and flour for about 3 min. to remove the raw flour taste and then add the milk (warmed) to the roux and wisk it to smooth out the gravy. Add rest of the ingredients. Fresh garlic diced is a good addition also.  I've been cooking for 53 years now...

Great recipe.  I made it exactly as it is written and it turned out perfectly.  Get some White Lily biscuits straight from the frozen foods section, pop them in the oven to bake, and then pour this gravy on top.  You won't be disappointed.

THANK GOODNESS! I am overdue with a baby and was craving hamburger gravy, BUT of course my husband kept hinting at me cooking something else. Well, I stood my ground and I'm so glad I did! I proved him wrong and he was just as pleased as I was. Serves him right for whining :) Thanks for an awesome, easy and (no offense) cheap recipe! I will even make this again when we're not broke! lol. Perfect!

Based on previous reviews, I used beef bouillion (Better Than Bouillion brans), doubled the sage and left out the salt.  The only other changes I made were to add 2 tsp garlic powder and 2 tsp onion powder because I was out of fresh.  Next time I'll use 4 cloves of garlic and a whole medium onion and saute them with the beef.  I also used 80% ground beef just because I think it has far more flavor than the lean.  Definitely takes me back to my childhood and definitely far more flavorful than the substitutes made with cream of mushroom soup.  This is going into my regular rotation.

This is a great recipe.  Growing up my Mom made the family something very close.  Instead of sage, onion & chicken bouillon she used an envelope of dry onion soup mix.  Made it a consistency to serve on a bun (sloppy joe style).  She called it Onion Burgers.  Yum.

This was a fantastic recipe.  The only minor change I made was that after browning the beef I took it out and fried up 4 strips of bacon to crispy perfection and used both the beef and bacon grease.  I took out the bacon and put back the beef and continued the recipe as written.  At the end when the gravy is thickened and I was adding the salt and pepper, I added the crumbled bacon.  I will be using this as my staple hamburger gravy from now on!  Delicious!  Thanks so much!

This was alright.  It was definitely better than the attempt I made at hamburger gravy.  But it was still just ehh.  I think that hamburger gravy (for me at least) just tasted better when I was a kid.  Like others, I added a little garlic (powder, when I added the other spices).  IF I ever make hamburger gravy again, I'll use this recipe, but don't foresee me making it again.

Excellent.  I've been wanting to try this for a while and it was worth the wait!  I always try to cook a recipe as written for the first time I cook it, however I didn't have any sage or onion.  It was delicious without.  I imagine it will be even better with.  Thanks RHODAN35!

Have tried it 3 times now including premaking it and heating it up while camping. I tend to stick to recipes exactly as written and this one hasn't failed us yet. Simply delicious.

Well, I followed the recipe and gave it a taste and it seemed so plain.  So I had to add some spices to bring out some flavor.  I doubled the amount of sage, added some cayenne, oregano, seasoned salt and white pepper.  And a splash of white wine.

Hubster wanted biscuits & gravy for breakfast and we didn't have any sausage, so we thought we'd give this gravy a try. It was delicious! It was a perfect thick & creamy texture. Didn't have any chicken bouillon granules, so I used seasoned salt and added a clove of minced garlic to make up for it. The sage really is the star in this gravy, so don't leave it out. We loved it. Thanks for the quick-save breakfast and a keeper of a recipe!  :)

I cook a lot for my elderly father and being an old military guy he has asked me to make SOS or something similar for such a long time.  I found this and made it with just a few healthier ingredients.  I used ground turkey, 1% milk, added some minced garlic and used "Better than Bouillon" in lieu of the bouillon granules.  Better than Bouillon is a great product - 50% less sodium than broth, stock, cubes or granules.  I just recently discovered it at Costco. I made biscuits for him to eat this on and he was just a happy camper.  I was surprised that I enjoyed it so much but he got all the leftovers to take home.

Too bland, even though I added 4 cloves, a pinch of red pepper flakes and used all the onion in while cutting the meat and milk in half. It still required a lot of Mrs. Dash Extra Spicy and salt. However, my 22-yr-old nephew liked it, so 3 stars. Still, I won't make it again.

We used to do this when I was growing up too! It is so nice to have things from your childhood! In Minnesota (land of the casserole and hotdish, lol) we used to serve this over mashed potatoes and string beans. IF we did not used ground beef, we would use left over chicken or turkey pieces after a holiday. I really reccomend this over mashed potatoes! My fave!

A bit soupy on the sauce, so next time will use a little less milk. The sage, though, that was the magic of the dinner. I served it over fried potatoes with the peels left on. Really easy to make.

I homeschool my boys, and told them to go through the kitchen cupboard and pick out seasonings to add to this.  We used garlic, sea salt, pepper, beef bouillon, and more.  The beef bouillon really gave a nice flavor to this.  We served it as a topping over green beans or mashed potatoes.  We also enjoy it on toast.  Our family has always made the creamed corned beef with Budding...

I just made this today, and everyone in my family enjoyed the rich flavor!  Instead of biscuits, which is traditional in the South, I added some pre-cooked bowtie pasta to the gravy.  Very tasty, Rhonda.  Next time, I may add a veggie to turn it into a complete meal.   A new favorite!

Awesome recipe!  I substitute 1/2 half & half & 1/2 milk for an extra rich gravy and use beef boullion.  Great with buttermilk biscuits in the morning.

I basically just looked at the ingredients and took it from there.  Did not have boullon but I had seasoning from ramen noodles and used that.  This turned out real good like my mom and dad use to make.  So easy and so filling!

Delicious and comforting! So much better than any I've ever had, and so easy. Followed exactly other than using beef instead of chicken bullion. Hubby loved it, too!

This reminds me of school cafeteria lunch back in the 50's and 60's that was served over mashed potatoes with green beans on the side. I make my own version of this from time to time but never with sage due to my personal preference and my dislike of the flavor of sage. I add cayenne pepper and sea salt to boost the flavor.

This was tasty AND simple.  I omitted the onions but added onion powder and garlic powder in addition to browning my meat with Montreal Steak Seasoning.  I used skim milk (you'd never know!) and served over whole wheat Grands biscuits.

Made this tonight for dinner.  Everyone liked it but it was a bit salty for me - next time I will use reduced sodium granules.  I did cook up about 5 slices of bacon first and then cooked the meat in the grease.  Followed the rest of the recipe as stated expect for the addition of fresh mushrooms with the onion.  Definitely a keeper!

It was OK.  I didn't have sage or bullion, so that may have made a difference.

This was a very good recipe.  I followed the directions as written and it had nice flavor.  Since it was just for myself, I cut the recipe in half and the gravy was the perfect thickness.

this turned out good. a little bland, but fine for picky kids. I used a little less milk (about one cup less),  I just didn't see the point since I would  be adding flour later. It was fine, next time I might even do less milk...I did add some garlic (because it's good in everything) and didn't put the butter in (didn't see the reason for the grease).

This is a fabulous gravy recipe!  My family loved it! Because we like thinks rich & spicy I added some red pepper flakes to the sausage as it cooked and replaced some of the milk with heavy cream! Delish!

Almost the same as Mom made! Coming from such a large family (6 kids), we had this on a pretty regular basis. Mom says it's the first thing we all asked how to make when we got our own places. I added a little garlic to the ground beef while it was browning ~ Mom never did but I likes me some garlic :). I use beef bouillon instead of chicken bouillon. Mushrooms are really good in this too. Yummy comfort food. Thanks Rhonda!

 I added minced garlic, mushrooms and Worcestershire sauce over fresh buttermilk biscuits. 
Everyone loved it. Thanks for sharing. I will make this often.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!! The only thing I did differently was add 1 tsp of salt and pepper as well as 1 tsp of liquid gravy browner. My Mom has made this from scratch a different way and like mine better. I'll make it in the future for sure.

Very straightforward and easy to make. Follow the recipe to the letter and you'll have the desired product. Taste was good but very vanilla - you may want to doctor it up with some more seasoning. The sage was definitely a nice touch.

Add a few more onions and some seasoned salt. Mixed it all with egg noodles and was delicious. The family loved it and there was only enough left over for my lunch the next day.

I never seem to have onion on hand, and used minced onion instead.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  Hubby and kids love it!

Very good!  It could use a tad bit more seasonings than what it called for, but everyone in my family liked it and my family includes picky young children :).  I will definitely make it again with the same seasonings but just increase them a little.  Very yummy!  Thanks for sharing!

I love hamburger gravy over rice with a side of buttery green beans! P.s. Beef base adds fantastic flavor to the gravy as does a few drops of soy sauce! the soy sauce adds nice color, and a very rich delicious flavor!!

I thought this was great.  The first time I told my daughter I was going to make hamburger gravy she turned up her nose.  She now requests it!  I don't use sage only because my husband doesn't like it.

Very quick, easy, and yummy recipe.  I took someone else's advice and swapped out one pound of the ground beef with one pound of sausage, which gave it even better flavor.

Used to eat this in the Army and my Dad had it in the Navy as well.  Poured over toast it's called $hit on a shingle.  The site wouldn't let me spell it out.  Too family oriented I guess.

If ever anything deserved MINUS 5 stars, this is it! I was skeptical at first because the idea of hamburger and milk just doesn't appeal to me but after reading the reviews I thought I would try.  Wrong!  
While waiting for my biscuits to finish baking, my husband came upstairs and said that it smelled good.  When we sat down to eat, he quickly changed his mind and this is a man who will eat anything i put in front of him and love it.  We ate our biscuits and salad.  The biscuits are off this site, the baking powder biscuits (delicious) and the blue cheese dressing from this site too MMMM!
Don't make this gravy.  It is a waste of money, time and effort.

My family loves hamburger gravy (and it is cheap!). I have made this several times. The first time I follow the directions so I can give a fair assessment. We liked it as directed, but my husband and I can't leave any recipe alone...we do add  about 2 tsp. of garlic to it. Thank you for a recipe we keep coming back to.

This gravy is awesome! I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 evaporated milk for that creamier gravy and 5 TB. "I can't believe it's not  butter". I used 2 TSP. of "better than bouillon soup base". I just saw it called for 2 TB. Next time I will use 2TB granules. I tasted it and it tasted like something was missing(probably the bouillon I misread). I added a large heaping TB of onion powder and that did it!!! When tasting this I felt  it would be better without the sage,but after it went on the biscuits it was awesome! I will add this to our recipe book. We are taking my mom some leftovers. She has to try this! We made biscuits with Bisquick.

Great flavor! Didn't make as written. Was making frozen hamburer patties and wanted more than just a burger and fries so I cooked the burgers then followed the rest of the recipe to make gravy. Served with cheesy bacon potatoes from this site. Next time I will follow the recipe, I'm sure we'll love it!

My boyfriend loves this because he is a big fan of sausage gravy and biscuits for breakfast.  I thought this was ok but can use a ton more seasoning.  I served it over cresent rolls and will try mashed potatoes next time.  Overall, I like how easy this recipe is to make and it was great that I already had all the ingredients in my pantry.

This was just okay.  I thought from the reviews that it was going to be something more.  The kids ate it but really thought it looked "gross".  My husband and I could take it or leave it.  It wasn't terrible- just not for us.

I rated this a 5 because it is good and it is so inexpensive and quick to make.  My husband loves "stuff" with gravy and so he loved this.  I made a half recipe using only 1 lb ground beef and halved everything else.  I forgot to half the sage but it tasted fine. I added about a teaspoon of minced garlic and I used 2 beef bouillon cubes crushed in place of the chicken bouillon. We ate this over whole grain pasta noodles.  Something different on a night I couldn't figure out what to make for dinner.

I originally tried this recipe to reminisce about the mashed potatoes and hamburger gravy that I enjoyed as a child. When I served it, my 11 year old son said that he could eat this hamburger gravy with mashed potatoes for dinner every night for the rest of his life! Do you think he liked it? I needed to season the gravy more with onion soup mix, and Kitchen-Bouquet-type liquid seasoning.

Unfortunately this wasn't great! It tasted okay, but had a very bland flavour. And it looked just awful!

I won't make it again. Unless I find a way to kick up the flavour!

My husband & I were reminiscing about how our grandmother's used to make hamburger gravy and pour it over mashed potatoes so I went searching to surprise him and found this recipe!  It was excellent...not only was the taste great but it really took us back in time.  I plan to make it again soon!

This was super good stuff! I loved the flavor the sage gave this. I was out of chicken boullion so I used 2 cubes of beef instead. I forgot and added the flour at the beginning of the gravy (the first cup fo milk) instead of later as directed, but the taste was great, so it turned out well despite my error. I used dried minced onion, that stuff is so convenient. I loved this recipe, thanks so much Rhonda for sharing your Dad's gravy with us!

This is delicious!!!  All four of my children loved it and went back for seconds and thirds.  I was a little worried about adding the sage, but it is what makes this recipe soooo good.  Don't leave it out!!!  We had it over mashed potatoes and I will definately be making this again.

It was a great starter for what I'm calling tomato-less spagetti.  I'm allergic to tomatoes.  I did add sausage, some ginger, garlic, bell pepper, a little chili powder,omitted the butter, used corn starch instead of flour and served over spagetti noodles.  Yummy.

A bit salty, but otherwise very good served over buttered rice. I also mixed in some frozen peas for color and nutrition and my family loved it! For the part of the milk I used a can of evaporated milk and the results were good.

This wasn't bad.  I added some fresh mushrooms, which made it better.  My husband said I was teasing him....why didn't I just make the "real thing" and make sausage gravy?  I probably won't make again...I'll just make sausage gravy next time.  But this isn't bad...just not as good as sausage gravy and just as much work.

This is very tasty and quick for an easy weeknight meal. I threw in some frozen peas at the end of the cooking time and it was delicious. Will definitely make it again since we almost always have everything on hand anyway.

This recipe was very good as written. My only issue is with the addition of the flour at the end. There isn't enough time to cook out the flour taste. Add it to the onions and butter to make a roux and cook it for a few minutes before adding the milk. I also browned the meat really well on one side before breaking it up in the pan to get the most beefy flavor out of the meat. Served over the Basic Biscuit recipe biscuits for breakfast with over easy eggs. Yummy southern tradition.

I make it often as it's one of the kid's favorite meals.
Sometimes I use 1 lb. Jimmy Dean original  sausage.
Sometimes I use chicken stock instead, but I always use more than suggested.
We normally have it over red mashed potatoes.

It’s great! I used 3lbs of turkey meat because I have two teenage boys and they loved it! Only think I did different besides seasoning was I used a little more than the ingredients called for because I was using 3lbs instead of 2a little xtra butter, milk, and flower I didn’t use bullion or sage. Thx!

It was good. Even though I like simple food, hamburger gravy can be notoriously bland, even for me so I jazzed it up a bit. I threw in a few ounces of bacon crumbles. I also added plenty of black pepper & even some cayenne pepper, which I rarely use. Finally, I added a teaspoon of McCormick's Hamburger Seasoning, which I may increase next time.

Delicious! I followed the recipe but I added a whole onion, served over rice with veggies on the side but I think over mashed potatoes would be better. I was hesitant about adding the Sage but I'm glad I did! Thank you!

I liked this recipe. I did not have any sage so I used some dry ranch seasoning. I also used beef  bouillon instead of chicken. My family said they would like it if I made it again.

This was a quick and easy meal. However I did add more spices to it because it’s a little bland without. I first used half milk and half & half I had left over, which made it more creamy. Added garlic powder, season salt, ground pepper, dried oregano and little bit if cayenne pepper. I sautéed mushrooms with garlic to add on top. Hubby and son don’t like mushrooms so I did it separately. This is a good basic recipe, very filling and cheap. Served over rice, peas and carrots on the side with a roll. Definitely will be adding this to my regular dishes!

The recipe was easy to follow and worked as expected but was really bland. I added garlic and some Wrocestershire sauce to it and that helped a little bit but not much. I'm not sure if I'll make this again or not, it really needs more flavor.

I made it tonight for dinner and it turned out amazing. ended up adding a little more flour but i did have a little less than two pounds of ground beef. I found that adding more salt that i thought was gonna be needed helped the flavor come out a lot. I will be making again!

I didn't like the flavor of this at all. It was very bland. I added some garlic and onion which helped but this didn't taste like the hamburger gravy I remember my mother-in-law used to make.  I give this 2 stars because it did at least make a gravy consistency which I often have a problem with.

I have never made nor had Hamburger gravy before. My husband asked me to make it and I chose this recipe. I am so glad that I did. This was so delicious. The only change I made was beef bullion instead of chicken. My husband said this is exactly what he wanted and it reminded him of when you used to have it in the Navy and when he was younger and lived in Kentucky. This is going to be a regular part of my family recipe arsenal. Oh, and sage is the key to the proper flavor. My husband made a face when I added it but he soon realized that that is what gave the dish its unique and amazing flavor. Thank you!!

good and easy.  I've actually made a very similar recipe for years and usually put it over bread I had leftover mashed potatoes and thought the little changes would be nice.  I did use beef bouillon instead of chicken,  fresh sage,  and added a little salt and pepper.

I made it right by the record except I sauteed the onions before the beef and added 2 Tbs of minced garlic. It's amazing will definitely be making this again.

Absolutely wonderful!  Quick easy and filling.   Bonus--very few pots/pans to wash afterwards since it's basically an all in one dish.  I did add a little garlic but only cause we're garlic freaks!  Lol

This truly was an amazing dish....I followed the ingredients pretty much as is...I used half and half in lieu of milk..Because half and half is thicker I only used 1/4 flour and I added garlic salt..maybe a teaspoon which helped give it a little more kick...If you follow the ingredients which includes the sage etc it will be  hit!

I am not usually a fan of hamburger gravy, but I liked this recipe - especially since I have all the ingredients on hand (if using toast).  I used Grands buttery flaked biscuits, which the kids like.  Also, I did half skim and half 2%.  I don't think the butter is necessary.  It is definitely worth making again!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good recipe! The only reason it's not 5 stars is because it lacks the little bit of spice that is  the best part of typical sausage gravy. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I omitted the sage (don't care for it) and added about 1/2 cup  sour cream. I think the sour cream added a nice bit of creaminess to this. Very simple and easy to make with ingredients I usually have on hand.  If I make this again I'll probably use half sausage and half  ground beef.

This is an interesting combination of beef and chicken (broth and sage).  I am forwarding to my daughter who has hubby and 4 kids.  The recipe was easy and didn't require a lot of attention.  An old saying from my father applies to this recipe.  He would say "Mom, this is almost good enough to eat."  That meant for Mom to serve again.

If you're looking for a go-to hamburger gravy recipe, this is the one. Better than my parents' recipe, and we ate this regularly growing up. I didn't have chicken bouillon, so I just used a little Johnny's Seasoning. I also cut the recipe in half, initially stirring in 2 cups of milk and mixing 1/4 cup of flour with 1/2 cup of half & half to thicken the gravy up at the end. It was delicious.

I used 1/2 pound of ground beef and half a pound of breakfast sausage, a hole onion, and Italian seasoning to spice it up a bit more. I will definitely be making it again!

Made this several times as the recipe indicates.  My husband and I enjoyed it on biscuits, mashed potatoes and also rice.  Found out it freezes well, too, so freeze it in serving sizes for the two of us, thaw overnight in the refrigerator; then add a little more liquid while reheating.  Turns out great.

Only had 1 lb ground beef on hand so we subbed the "2nd" lb with ground pork.  Also used powdered onion as my guys aren't fond of lil' bits of onion in their food (spoiled much?!).  When the gravy was poured over our cream cheese biscuits no one could spare a second to compliment the meal as we were too busy shoveling it in!  My big guy had 3 helpings, unheard of for him.  Excellent comfort food meal which will be added to our monthly meal rotation.  Leftovers are best heated up with the addition of a bit of milk, in our opinion, to thin the gravy as it really thickens after an overnight chill'n in the fridge.  Only herb addition we added was a tsp of dried summer savory (a staple in my kitchen) along with the sage.

I was looking for a hamburger gravy recipe that tasted similar to that we had in school in the 70's.  This is very close, love the taste of sage in it, but still missing some type of spice.  We enjoyed this but I will add some garlic the next time I make it.  Thank you for the recipe!

5 stars for being a good and flexible recipe, an improvement over how most folks make this dish in my state of WA. Most local recipes require   all the milk at the same time. That never made the sauce this good. What I love about the method described in this Dad's... is that this way makes a better gravy, with the milk used for two steps, the deglazing and then the thickening. 

I did modify: here's how: 

1. I always put a tsp of Olive Oil and start to caramelize onions BEFORE I put the ground beef in so that I never have undercooked onions. 
2. I chopped one fresh clove of garlic and added just after the beef. 
3. I substituted "BetterThanBouilllon" BEEF for CHICKEN bouillon. 
4. I added 1 TBL worcestershire sauce.  
5. I added 1 TSP Creole Seasoning Mix. 

The flavor blend of the sage, butter, Creole, w. sauce and beef with 2% milk was  truly unique and palate pleasing. It made this go from a customary to a surprisingly delightful surprising twist on a favorite. Finally, I used a cast iron skillet, which may have added to the texture and flavor balancing so nicely.

Thank you for superior steps in preparation for the perfect texture.

I used this recipe for biscuits and gravy when I didn't have any sausage and a craving one evening. It was pretty good! I halved the recipe, used almond milk instead of regular, and so added some more salt.

I used a pound of meat, and it was still too much hamburger for us. Next time, I will only use a half pound. I also only used three cups of milk total. It was very bland. I added a lot of other spices to make this edible.
The process works, though it's no substitute for browned flour gravy.

This is a recipe my dad made too. For those of you who don't know, the Navy made this recipe using dried chipped beef and served it over toast, which is how I serve hamburger gravy. The sailors called it SOS aka S**t on a Shingle. Hence this is probably why so many people got this recipe from their dear ole dads. :) I make a simple cream gravy with butter, flour, salt, and pepper. Season it to your taste and serve over toast.

Great recipe.  Just season to however you are feeling. Garlic, of course was added, my personal taste.  The ratio of milk to flour is perfect.  Nice and thick, even my 4 year old cleaned her plate.  Nicely made in one pan, quick and easy to cook, quick and easy to clean up.  Thanks!

Both my husband and daughter thought this recipe tasted like "Thanksgiving."  You could definitely taste the sage.  I'm pretty sure I only put a teaspoon in, but we all thought it was a little overwhelming. I think if I make this again, I will leave the sage out unless I make it in November..LOL

I absolutely loved this recipe as did my husband.  I gave it 5 stars because had I made the recipe as stated, it probably would have tasted better than how I had to make it.  I had to make changes due to our health and dietary needs.  For more lean and less fat I used venison sausage and ground sirloin.  I used 1 cup of unsalted beef broth(we are on a restricted low sodium diet), 2 cups of 2% milk, and 2 cups of water.  To get a little more depth and taste for us, I used 1 tsp. of low sodium  bullion, minced garlic, parsley and added extra onion.  I really loved your recipe Rhonda35 and sorry I had to make dietary changes, but I'm sure it is really great and wish I could have made it as stated in your recipe above, and I really think you deserve 5 stars.  Thank you so much for sharing

I just made this for dinner tonight and I have to say, it was an absolute hit. I changed things up a bit, instead of using chicken bullion, I used 4 of the Beef Flavor Boost Packs and used 2.25lbs of hamburger meat. It turned out awesome! My kids loved it. Husband loved it, I loved it. 5 stars all around! Serve it up with some homemade rolls and you're in business!

I made this last night, its not a bad recipe, but not really a favorite of mine, to me hamburger meat just doesn't absorb flavor very well. I think the actual gravy itself had a wonderful flavor, and the sage really was a nice touch. I think I will make again and use sausage which I know defeats the purpose of this recipe lol, but it is what it is anyways take you for sharing.

I'd give you a 10 if I could - this recipe was absolutely wonderful.  My only addition was a little garlic and served it on a mountain of mashed potatoes.  It doesn't get any better than this!

Yummy!!!  All my past attempts to make hamburger gravy failed:(  However, even using soy flour (all I had on hand) this recipe turned out perfect:)  I luv the savory flavor that the onions added:)  I will be adding this to my recipes & look forward to making again:)

Very good for that moment when you realize you have very little in the house to make a decent dinner.  My hubby said it tasted like his mom's hamburger gravy.. so that's the ultimate compliment for a rib stickin' recipe like this!  We will make it again..

I quite enjoyed this.  I think think the key to the tasty flavor is the spices.  This recipe has it right.  In an effort to reduce the calories, I replaced half of the ground beef with chopped mushrooms.  I added a little extra onion, too.  The first time I made this I followed other reviewers advice and substituted sour cream for a bit of the milk.  I did not like that as much as I liked it with all milk.  I also used Better Than Bouillon beef instead of chicken granules.

We loved this! I followed the recipe exactly, except I reduced the meat to only 1 lb. and I used ground turkey instead of beef. The end results were seriously delicious, and this recipe is going straight into my "keeper" file. Thank you!

this is a great version, of course i have my own but yours is great also, i use hamb or sausage, what makes mine a quick easy version of my moms is i use the country style peppered gravy mixes in the pouches, i also sprinkle in dryed thyme leaves instead of sage, for beef use a brown gravy mix envelope, with a couple peppered ones, our secret i love to share is also add a big chunk of cream cheese, i whip up homemade from scratch bisguits, we like to call it a shinkle square pan full LOL

It's good and great for a fast meal. I wouldn't use the butter, I didn't find it necessary. We added mushrooms and it came out very good.

Very good and easy to make. I've always had trouble making gravy from scratch and this turned out delicious. I did use a can of beef broth and used milk for the rest of the recipe to equal the 5 cups. I also added fresh mini bella mushrooms and sauteed them with the onions. Very good with the sage. I will definately make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good, but I think for personal taste I would use less ground beef next time.  I missed the creaminess like you get with sausage gravy (I even added extra milk), but maybe it's not supposed to be like that?  At any rate, it was good with that exception.  Next time I might add a piece of crumbled bacon to give it a little twist on flavor.

This is very tasty and easy to make.  It completely took me back to my mom's kitchen and to this standard she used to make for supper every couple of weeks.  The only addition I made was throwing in a teaspoon of paprika and some mushrooms for a twist.  VERY good!

Pretty yummy just not anything spectacular. Its hamburger gravy though so I dont know how spectacular its supposed to be. I added cayenne, a bit of worcestershire, some garlic, and used seasoning salt instead of regular. Good for what it was.

My daughter was begging me to make this meal for her for months. Her daycare use to make it for her and apparently she loved it. Anything she'll eat, I'll make because she's such a picky eater. I decided to use this recipe and she loved it. I didn't have the sage or chicken bouillon so we did without and it was still great! We put it over rice. Delicious!

This was very good.  I have been hungry for this dinner and it was liked by the family and we will make it again.  I did use beef bouillon instead of chicken and added garlic, garlic powder, onion salt and small amount of seasoning salt.  Great comfort food!!!

I think I have done just about everything there is one can do with ground beef, but one evening it occured to me that I had NEVER made hamburger gravy, one of my most favorite childhood foods. Funny thing is, it was always my dad who made it! This was a very yummy recipe, taking me back to my youth. One that I will make again and again!

One of the best memories of my childhood was the time I spent at Camp Barakel near Fairview, Michigan.  I always looked forward to the hamburger gravy.  Thinking about Camp and the hamburger gravy, I perused this site for a recipe.  This one I chose, and it is absolutely fabulous! Didn't/wouldn't change a thing.  Your dad must have been a really good cook!

This recipe is one of our Minnesota winter staples.  It so cold here, nothing like coming home and filling up on this hamburger gravy over toast. It warms the soul and tastes wonderful!  What a great recipe!! Thank you for sharing it!!

This recipe is really great as is. When I used beef granules instead of chicken ones its even better. I'd give it 5 stars with the beef granules in it.

Very good-- I took the advice of some others and added beefy onion soup mix.  I feel it is missing something though- Not sure what yet, but I will make it again and if I change anything else for the better, I will repost.

First time I ever made this and it came out great! Will def. keep making it for the family. Everyone was happy and no complaints. The only thing I did differently was used a can of French Onion soup instead of just an onion and beef cubes instead. It was DELICIOUS!

This has become a family favorite.  The only thing that we do different is use some seasoning salt and add mushrooms to the gravy.  Yummy

Great Recipe!!! I added the seasoning to the meat as it browned. If you do not season the meat as it cooks, it will be bland. I also added garlic powder and served on slices of toast. Defintely a keeper.

This was a terrific quick week night recipe!  My family loved it.  The only change I made was to use beef bouillian instead of chicken.  It was delicious.

First of all I had high hopes for this dish. My Mom made a similar kind of gravy once a long time ago, but now after making this gravy, I think hers was made of Cream of Mushroom Soup and not from scratch. I am a firm believer that you can make the best food from scratch. That being said I really had to "doctor" this recipe up quite a bit and it is still pretty tasteless. I made it all like the directions said and found it to be so bland that I had to add a little "Country Gravy" packet with some extra milk to add some depth. I also added a Bay Leaf, Garlic Powder, Worchestershire Sauce, Seasoned Salt and Dried Parsley, along with the recipe's Dried Sage. I am really disappointed that even though I added all this, it's still pretty thick and inedible. This gravy was so thick I started to add water so it wouldn't end up tasting & being like glue. But the problem is that when you add water the flavor gets watered down too. So I am really stumped and dissapointed in this recipe to say the least. I am unfortunately going to give this 3 stars. I was hoping to give it more if I could've just been able to fix it up somewhat :(

Nothing fancy, but still warm and comforting.  My grandpa used to make this all the time so I always think of him when we have it.  We like to serve ours over Texas Toast.

My ozark mountain grandmother used to make this for us as kids. This recipe was awesome - it took me back to my grandmothers hillbilly home. I used grands biscuits topped with mashed potatoes and smothered in this gravy. mmmmm good!!

This gravy was very good.  It reminded me of what I had in the school cafeteria.  I Added 1/4 tsp. salt and 1/8 tsp. pepper.  Very good.

Pretty good, though a tad on the salty side. I'm going to use half the amount of chicken bouillon next time.

This was better than my mother used to make! (Sorry, Mom.) I followed the recipe but took one suggestion which was to add a little garlic. I added a little garlic powder and it was great. I will omit the salt next time as it was a little salty but it was still very good. I hadn't had this meal in probably 15 years and didn't know how my mother used to make it. I can't believe I found it. Thank you!

Kristin O, I'm with ya... The childhood memory of this was better.  Thankfully, I halved this - added in garlic, Penzey's Black & Red, and some mixed frozen veggies.  Served over mashed potatoes with biscuits on the side.  The kids tried a bite, then picked around it to get the plain potatoes.  Ended up in the trash.

I gave this 5 stars because though it's such a simple dish, it is so cheap and easy so flavor is good but excellent bang for the buck.  I serve with home made buttermilk biscuits and a vegetable and that's a pretty balanced, quick and easy dinner.

Tastes very similar to the gravy used for "biscuits n'gravy", which I love, but would be better with sausage. It's a little bland as is, so I added some extra chicken boullion and served it over rice.

this was a hit.  I served it over fucilli. My boyfriend said "It's like biscuits and gravy only over noodles.  There's nothin' wrong with that!"

Awesome!!!!  My 3yr old daughter and my husband had it over rice and I had it over toast(childhood memories). Thanks for sharing this recipe!  My daughter ate until she said, "Uh, I full" :)
