We like our bloody marts spiced up, so there was a lot of hot sauce added to the mix.  I find that I'm liking things less and less sweet these days, and the one that I didn't care for in this mix was the sugar.  I would reduce to a tsp or totally eliminate sugar  in the future to suit our tastes.  Definitely made a vibrant and refreshing drink, so thanks Nolimit for posting your recipe.

I put all ingredients in my Vitamix along with a couple celery stalks and blended. It was a bit too thick so I needed to add additional liquid. Everyone really liked it and I will definitely make it again instead of buying pre-made. I don't like my bloody Mary's very spicy so this was perfect. For my guests who wanted more spice, we just added it to their glass.

Really, really good. It's not as spicy as I prefer, but that's great because I'm the only one around my house that likes spicy, so I can tune up my own. I did reduce sugar based on another review since I'm not a fan of sweet either, but I may try it as is next time upon the request of others.
