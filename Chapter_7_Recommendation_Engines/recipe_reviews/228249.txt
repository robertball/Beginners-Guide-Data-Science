Made these for staff meeting last week. They were a big hit!  I put spider ring on finger, and used cute Halloween ribbon instead of twist ties at wrist.   
Helpful hint:  I bought small size gloves. The popcorn had to be crushed so that it would go into fingers of the glove.  Recommend using a bigger sized glove for ease of filling the fingers.

When my mom and I owned our baking/candy supply store, we made and sold these every year at Halloween time and they were always a huge hit! We would also add a plastic spider ring to one of the fingers and tied them w/ Halloween colored curling ribbon for a little decoration. Simple, fun and a great treat to make w/ kids! :)

Okay, these are super cute Halloween treats and the the kiddos love them!  However, I made them for my daughter's kindergarten class and doing 25+ was a lot of work!  The hard part is working the popcorn into the fingers without breaking it up too much (otherwise it covers up the candy corn fingernails).  We used pipe cleaners to close them up, and did not use rings because we couldn't find any in our little town.  Also, we had a hard time finding nonlatex, nonpowder gloves...but again we live in a very small town.  Took me around 2 hours to complete with little helpers.  CUTE little project for Halloween though!!

Made these last night after finding the idea in here. My daughters 6th grade class LOVED them!! Other parents brought boring cupcakes etc, but when my daughter whipped these out everyone cheered! Thank you for the easy, fun and inexpensive idea that was a hit with the older kids!
