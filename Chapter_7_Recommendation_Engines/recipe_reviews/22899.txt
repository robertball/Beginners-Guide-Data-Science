Thanks, Marilyn! My 2 and 4 year old boys had a blast helping me prepare this casserole for our supper. The flavor is one of a kind, and we all enjoyed it.

What a tasty way to use up some leftovers!  I used a broccoli/cauliflower/carrot mix instead of the broccoli and canned mushrooms.  It was nice to use up the hard-cooked eggs, but we didn't feel they really added much to the casserole.  The sauce was definitely the best part!  Also baked with a sprinkle of French's onions on top.  With the ham, soup, and cheese, you probably won't need that 1/2t of salt (we didn't). Enjoy!

Nice dish and the kids liked it too! I added a cup of brown rice to make it healthier and it worked out great.
