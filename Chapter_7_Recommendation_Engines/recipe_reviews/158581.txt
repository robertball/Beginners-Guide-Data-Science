My mother-in-law introduced this dish to me and I love it. She also calls it Eggs a al Goldenrod. Dana's recipe is just right.

My Southern husband taught me how to make this, but we just chop up the eggs into the cream sauce, and call it creamed eggs.  Yummy!

When I was a child,several families in our Irish, English,Scotch neiborhood in Boston, MA had Goldenrod Eggs for Sunday brunch--I'm 68 yrs.old and I still enjoy it on Sunday ( as well as creamed tuna on toast).
I recently found this recipe in a 1896 cookbook entitled "The Boston School Of Cooking Cookbook" by Fannie Merritt Farmer---I was amazed that this recipe has been around for so long.

Thank you so much for this recipe!  I'm a Personal Support Worker, I made this (a quartered recipe) for a client with Huntingtons.  She must have foods that are easy to eat as she has issues with swallowing.  I'm always looking for something (like this) so she doesn't have to eat the same thing every day.  She absolutely loved this recipe and when I admitted I hadn't tried it myself,  insisted I have a bite just to taste it.  Thanks SO much for sharing this recipe.   You will never know how much a woman who has terminal illness appreciates it.

This is good.  I learned this recipe in 1972, in the 8th grade. Our home ec class learned how to make this dish.  It was called "eggs a la goldenrod".  The ingredients for the "roux" are what is used for a white sauce, and would be between a medium to thick white sauce.  At the time we learned how to make this recipe, we also learned how to make homemade bisquits, and we served this over gravy mixture over the bisquits.  It was really good, and very simple to make.  BTW, our lab group got an "A" for how the dish turned out.  :)

This was dinner tonight. Simple and quick for a Mom who's worn out from Thanksgiving and good for a family who needed a change from turkey food. This is a great way to use up the last of your eggs before shopping day. To beef it up a bit for my boys, I added one pound of ground pork that I spiced up a bit with sage, red pepper flake, more paprika and fresh ground pepper. Instead of bread, I served this over homemade fluffy whole wheat biscuits. Easy for Mom, hearty enough for a brinner night for my three men. Win/win. Thanks, Dana. NOTE: This was more than enough for dinner for three boys and enough for a midnight snack for my husband later tonight.

Eggscellent dish! I felt like I was eating something really fancy. Quick and easy too since I already had peeled hard boiled eggs in the refrigerator. I loved the paprika on top, it added a little something to keep this from being bland. What a great comfort dish this is! This is similar to biscuits and gravy but so much faster and I'll bet a lot healthier in comparison as well. Thanks for sharing, I'm definitely fixing this one again.

When I was a child and didn't feel well, my mother would make this for me. She called it Eggs A la Goldenrod. She served it over 4 saltine crackers instead of toast and I think she added a very small pinch of cayenne pepper to the sauce. The cayenne added something to the white sauce but wasn't spicy hot. I just loved it then 60 - 65 years ago! Still do.

This is a recipe I learned to make 20 years ago in Home Ec class.  We called it Creamed Eggs on Toast.  Very tasty, with a slight variation:  We hard boiled the eggs, toasted the bread and made the roux.  Then sliced the egg over the toast and topped with the roux and pepper.  It's still a favorite meal today, it's quick and delicious!

My mother-in-law used to make this and now I do. It was generally served for brunch or on a special occasion like Easter or Christmas. However, it's easy and delicious enough to serve any time. My family (kids included) love it. Like my mother-in-law, I serve mine over english muffins with Little Smokies and cranberry sauce on the side.

Five-star idea and technique.This (with some seasoning added, of course) goes great with mimosas when trying to bolster yourself for Easter-day activities. You wouldn't want to eat this every weekend . . . well, actually you would. I would . . . but then my doctor would probably shame me into submission. Once a year, though, it's not too bad. I almost wish some of the dye from the eggs had remained and left colored streaks in the gravy. Maybe I'll just have another mimosa.

This is a recipe I have been eating since I was a little girl in the 50's.  My mother made Eggs a La Goldenrod for special breakfasts.  Now I make it for her, she has dementia and doesn't remember this recipe, but she loves it and always says-You made this just for me?  Thanks for posting this for others to enjoy as much as my family does.  It is easy enough that my brothers all make it too.  Don't forget the paprika.

I never heard of anyone else (except for ONE college friend) making this until I looked on this site...I thought it was just a family recipe.  It was my mom's favorite way to fix eggs and we loved it!  I don't bother to sieve the egg yolks, but just crumble them over the white sauce. It's more basic, but I will try this recipe next for a nice tweak! Thanks for sharing!

I've had this all of my life and I'm 53. We add Ham budig to it which I think makes this much better. And I don't use flour I use corn starch. Try it is it fantastic.

I learned how to make this in the 7th grade Home Ec class in 1959. I've made it for almost every Easter breakfast since then. When making a white sauce, be sure to use white pepper, and I like to use canned milk, it has a creamy consistency before cooking.

I have never seen a recipe for this before, but Mom always made this.  She just called it Creamed Eggs over Toast, but it's the same recipe. It makes a nice light supper along with a salad. Give it a try!

Basically gravy with chopped egg whites served on toast with the yolk sieved through wire mesh over the gravy. Sometimes I add cooked sausage to the gravy.  Really delicious, with readily available ingredients and quick. Also looks impressive if you have guests for breakfast.

Goldenrod eggs are also an Easter tradition in my family. It's a great way to get rid of a bunch of Easter eggs! You can substitute pepper gravy for the bechamel.

there's a reason this is the recipe used in so many old school home ec classes... it's very simple and VERY GOOD! made the recipe exactly as is... but doubled.... everyone STILL looking like they wanted more.. should have tripled it ??

My mother found this recipe in a magazine when we were just kids in the 70s.  We very often had it at Easter, but it was often a Sunday morning breakfast generally.  I make it all the time, especially now that I have backyard chickens (and two teenage boys) and it is a favorite 'breakfast for dinner' item.  My mom called it Eggs A La Goldenrod; it's a close kin to Welsh Rarebit (which I don't particularly like).  Thanks for sharing!

I'm 43 and we have are this my whole life on holidays and special occasions. My grandparents were born here in 1902 and my grandpa's parents were immigrants from Germany. My grandfather made my grandmother learn to cook this dish, a favorite of his mothers and we've eaten it ever since. When my children were little I introduced it to my children.

This was SO GOOD!!  The only change I made was using whole wheat bread.  Very easy (especially when you already have some boiled eggs in the fridge) and super yummy :)

I'm 76 and grew up with this as an Easter supper dish.  I took over with my own family, and now my children do this as well.  It was always funny to find a little color in the egg whites when we had hunted them down earlier in the day.  And we always just called Eggs Goldenrod.  Every now and then the kids would request that we put dried chipped beef in it - a whole different and wonderful meal.

This was super easy and we had all of the ingredients  handy on a snowy morning. I used Penzy's Smoked Paprika and white pepper. My 6 year old liked it!  Definitely will make this again.

This was (is) a family favorite. My mom grew up on it, she was born in 1914. I love it, converted my husband and some of my kids.  We call it eggs and white sauce.And on Easter we make it with the dyed eggs for a more colorful dish.

Eggs Goldenrod and Baked Eggs were the main menu items on my Aunt's Christmas Morning Brunch. She was one of 5 and all the siblings had children. Many wonderful memories revolve around family get-togethers and delicious dishes shared by all the family members.

My mother made us Goldenrod eggs just like this.  It was almost worth being home sick because she made it as a special treat to cheer us up. It was easy on the tummy, delicious, and full of protein.

Grew-up eating this ("eggs a la goldenrod") in the Midwest-- love it!!!!  You can make this fairly simple recipe even easier by just mincing up the yolks with a knife.  This was ways a family favorite-- thanks for the reminder!  You can also replace the eggs with a chopped "Buddig"-brand type of sliced beef and it turns into a yummy chipped beef recipe over toast!

I grew up with this dish, but it was just called creamed eggs on toast.  Very satisfying, and bacon bits, or diced ham can be added also.  I also throw in a dash of dry mustard and nutmeg.

Excellent recipe.  Thanks, Dana. For some reason I thought of Goldenrod Eggs this morning which was one of my daughters' favorites when we visited my Mother who passed away last year at 95.  Anyway, I paniced, worrying about whether anyone had retained her recipe.  Fortunately it was easy to find and just like Mother's.
I did slightly modify it by adding a few dashes of Louisiana Hot Sauce and used English Muffins.  It was delicious.

My father made this for us when we were young, very southern dish that fed 6 growing kids.  Of course we tripled the ingredients.  As an adult, I serve this but changed up some of the ingredients to add some flavor.  Instead of white bread we use sour dough or whole grain.  I also add 1/2 cup of grated parmesan which gives it a little kick.

This was very good, I am not an egg lover so for me I could eat the gravy part with the whites and leave off the yolks because that is the part I don't like!  I have a friend who makes this meal for her family during lent.  Followed recipe exactly.

I had to lower mine down to Quantity 1 and didn't have the paprika. I think it came out well, but it tasted like there was more milk in it than I needed. I'll definitely try this again and tweak it as I go!

As with a lot of you, I grew up on this, but in our family it was also called creamed eggs on toast and we just sliced the eggs and added it all to the cream sauce.  I love it and it is the epitome  of comfort food!  Haven't made it for a while until my great aunt asked me to do it for her, (she calls it eggs goldenrod), except she asked for me to use half milk and half chicken broth, I was skeptical but it tasted really good.  I also added sautéed mushrooms and chopped onions to it which was also a nice change.  More a dinner for her, but I know I could eat this any time, any day.

My family makes this recipe but put the sauce over corn bread instead of toast. You cut a piece of cornbread then slice it in half to get two thinner pieces. So good.

TIP:  Instead of pressing yolks through a sieve (which I've always found awkward), run it through a hand held cheese grinder.  It doesn't come out as delicate, but I actually like it better.  Also, I only process 1/4 to 1/3 the yolks for the topping and cut up the rest with the whites to add to the sauce.

As others have said, this is a VERY long-standing tradition for Eater brunch in our family, and I took on the preparation the past 5 or 6 years.  I'm always scrambling for the recipe on line, and doubting if I got the right one (pretty fool proof whichever you use), but this looks exactly like the one I like best.  Thanks for sharing!!

I grew up eating this, though we usually added some fried bologna to the gravy

my family has been making this for years, with one major exception....cheese...lot's of it.  for 8 servings, i'd probably use half a block velvetta and then add cheddar as needed to get my desired taste...melt in your mouth!
