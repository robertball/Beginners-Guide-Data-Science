This was great!  I made it in the crockpot yesterday with ground turkey.  It was VERY hot.  I was able to eat it, but my boyfriend (who loves spicy food) was only able to eat a few bites.  Two of the cans of tomatoes with green chilis I used were "extra hot" (with two "mild") which has made some of my other recipes really spicy, but I think the habaneros are the reason.  I think I will use half the amount of habaneros next time.

I only used two of the peppers and substituted medium for hot salsa and it was great. Spicy but not over the top. I won my chili cook-off at work with more than twice the votes of the second place chili. I highly recommend this recipe.

This is the best meat chili I have ever tasted.  It had a winning combination of hearty, spicy and meaty.  I also added some spicy Italian sausage(not on the recipe). If you're having a get-together where you need a large satisfying dish, this is the one!

I really like the spiciness of this chili (I used all ingreds. but just two peppers), but the salt content is unbelievable!  I was so surprised that not one other reviewer said anything about it. I can't eat much more than a couple of spoonfuls because it is unbelievably salty!!!  I wish I hadn't put the taco seasoning in, or the salsa.  If I ever make this again, I will definitely look for a healthy low salt salsa and find an alternative for the taco seasoning.  I only used a half a pack. If you have hypertension, your sodium intake should only be 1500 mg a day.  One serving of this chili without any chips or anything else will be all you can have.  If you don't, then, one an a half bowls will be your daily allowance for sodium.

This chili was GREAT!  The only change I made to the recipe was I used cans of Extra Hot Rotel tomatoea.

We like spicy, but either my habaneros that I grow are too hot, or 4 is too many!  Overpowered the taste of the chili.  Even my 21 year old, who eats habaneros raw, didn't care for the flavor.  I think it would be great if modified for strength of habaneros.

This recipe was awesome! Chili was really good my husband and kids enjoyed it! I altered it as someone suggested to keep it from being so spicy. I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and 2 cans of Rotel instead of  4 (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chile peppers. I used jalapenos instead of 4 habanero peppers, seeded and minced. Also, another tip just in case it comes out soupy or with lots of liquid use 4 tsp of flour it will help absorb the the liquid and thicken it to the right texture. Thanks for recipe and recommendations from reviews!

Very spicy! Our family enjoys hot food so this is a keeper. This is a good chili to serve over rice or cornbread for those of you that can't handle the heat.

This was SOOOO good!  I had to do a little adjusting, as I can't get habanero peppers, so I used jalepenos instead.  I also left out the salsa, and used 2 cans of Rotel brand tomatoes, and 2 cans of diced tomatoes.  I doubled the cumin, and left out the black and red pepper, as I have a hot chili powder I special order.  I will DEFINITELY make this again!

Love this recipe, and have gotten a few compliments on it too.  The changes I've made are to use jalapenos rather than habaneros, no taco seasoning, add some cayenne pepper and use only 2 cans diced tomatoes.   I've also made it with ground turkey, not beef.

I absolutely love this recipe.  It has the heat that I expect and want in a chili.  It also has a lot of flavor to compliment the heat.

I followed the recipe pretty closely and it turned out great! It's spicy, but it's not face-melting. I improvised and used ground turkey in place of ground beef, added a can of light red beans, added mild (vs. hot) salsa and used low-sodium taco seasoning. But those are the only changes I made...this is a fantastic recipe!

I just have to say that this chili recipe tops all chili recipes that I have tried. People ask me to make this for upcoming events, and disappointed when I don't bring it. It's easy to make with mixing all the ingredients together. I think I will make this today, in fact. Cheers! Oh, one more thing. I swapped out the 4 habaneros for 2 jalapenos and it was plenty spicy for my guests. This time, I will try one Haba and 2 Jalas and see if this is tolerable.

This was very good chili. I did change it a little. I used 2 habanero's and 4 jalepenos. I left out the red pepper flakes and salsa since I didn't have any. I also only put in three cans of beans and added a green bell pepper. Delicious!

This is the best chili recipe!  We love spicy food, so this was a good find for us.  I serve it with the suggested shredded cheese and sour cream, as well as sweet corn bread.  I often add sweet corn to the chili as well.  Thanks so much!

The only adjustment I'd suggest is cutting the black pepper in half.  It overrides all of the other flavors too much.

Excellent recipe! I made this for a Super Bowl Chili cookoff and won the contest! I halved the recipe but still used three cans of beans and it was perfect size for my 5-quart slow cooker.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used some jalapeno in place of habanero - it had the perfect amount of spice! I also used chipotle-flavored salsa and put one chipotle pepper in the chili; the flavor was subtle but it really added to this recipe. I used all low-sodium or "no salt added" ingredients for this, and only about 1/4 of the taco seasoning and it didn't come out too salty.  I highly recommend this recipe if you want a really hearty, dinnertime chili with a kick.

Love the flavor! I really like having the salsa and taco seasoning in there.  It's such a large recipe I typically split it and make one set spicy, and one with much less spice.  It definitely has a kick if you put every hot item in there. Freezes well.

Spicy but soooo good!  My husband gobbled this up.  I used sirloin for the meat, and topped it with onions, cheese and sour cream, and served it with cheese quesadillas.  Delicious!

My husband loved it. And that's saying alot because he loves his Spicy foods. 

Next time I may add some Sausage or Kielbasa though. It came out a little soupy. It was even better after it was refrigerated for a night though. 

Great on Sourdough Bread. Mmmm.

A pretty darn good chili! Spicy, but not so much that my eyes water!!! Made this for myself last night. It's cool here in Chicago (fall is setting in early...), so I was in the mood for something to warm me up. I was worried that this would be WAY too spicy (I enjoy spice, but not EXTREME heat), but was pleasantly surprised : ) Since I was only serving 1, I made 1/2 the recipe (expecting left-overs). Couldn't find chili beans in hot sauce, so subbed for mild ones (Busch's 16 oz. can) & only used 1 (15.5 oz.) can of dk. red kidney beans instead of buying bth. dk. / lt. kinds & only using 1/2 of ea. can (seemed wasteful). Also subbed a 1/2 lb. of JD zesty hot sausage for some of the beef (added a 1/2 lb. ground round to equal 1 lb. meat as directed). Used med-heat chunky salsa (I didn't have the hot stuff). Everything else was exact, including prep. Next time, I would like to prepare the chili in my sc, and, to make it suitable for my bf (who doesn't like beans in his chili - or at all), I'd omit the beans, up the meat to compensate (2 lb. worth) & add 1/2 a can or so of chili sauce (to make up for the chili beans with sauce). Served hot off the stove with some shredded (sharp) cheddar, Frito's scoops & plenty of water to tame the heat! I'm still in search of the perfect chili, but this will do for now. Thx. for sharing!

The reason I gave it only four stars is because I had to leave out the peppers--it would've been much too hot.  It was spicey enough without them.  (Thank you previous reviewers).  I didn't add the taco seasoning mix but if I had some in the house, my curiosity would've made me add it to see how much more flavorful it could possibly have been.  I cooked it in a crock pot for eight hours after browning the meat and served it with cornbread and chips.

Used jalapenos w/ pinch of seeds instead of habaneros and it was plenty hot.  I also subbed 1lb Bob Evan's Spicy Pork Sausage for 1lb beef.  Was short 1 can tomato/chile, also a few dashes hot sauce instead of salsa and it came out fine without.  I like spicy hot food but this pot was too hot for me so made I it for friends. The consensus was very tasty & caliente!

My family LOVED this!! I made a few changes though: I cut the recipient in half and made it in the crockpot. I used one can of diced tomatoes with green chilies and one can of diced tomatoes in chili sauce (it was all I had on hand) I also used only 1 can of Chili beans in mild chili sauce and a can of corn in place of all the beans (I'm not huge on beans) I didn't have habenaros, so I used jalapenos instead (diced and most of them I removed the seeds, I did leave a few seeds). This chili deffinatly packed a punch!!! Even the 6 yr old liked it ( she loves spicy food)  my boyfriend couldn't get enough of it and was sad there wasn't more leftover for lunch today. Deffinatly going to keep this and use again!!!!

This chili is fit for US Army Special Forces!  I made it over the weekend and brought the rest to share with my buddies.  It starts off hot and then the heat really kicks in after about a minute.  The flavor was incredible!  Surprisingly I was able to find all the ingredients over seas.

This is the BEST chili I've ever tasted! Enjoyed preparing it, double the recipe (so I could freeze some), used jalapenos instead of habaneros, used half diced tomatoes with green chiles and half without, and used my dad's homemade salsa. I didn't double the amount of chili powder, red pepper, black pepper, and cumin (just because that would've been a QUARTER cup)...but everything was delicious! :) Thanks!

I had a taste for some chili. I made this chili last night it was excellent. I started out making the soup in the crock pot but had to transfer to a large pot. This receipe as it states makes a huge portion. The only thing I did different was I used only 3 habaneros because I am fimiliar with the pepper and I did not want it to be so hot I could not eat it. I alos used a pack of chili seasoning instead of taco. After reading the reviews about the salt content I decided to only use a half a pack of chili seasoning. This receipe turned out awsome. I loved it. As some of the reviewers say it is a bit salty so be mindful of that when preparing.

Fantastic.  Only downside is my roommate at it for 3 meals a day so it didn't last as long as I'd hoped.  Good for the recipe, bad for me.

My husband of 35 years says this is the best chili I've ever made.  I cut back on a little of the heat (only 2 Habanero's, medium salsa, only 1 T. red pepper, and one of my cans of Rotel was mild.)  It's excellent chili, but still a little on the spicy side for my taste.
If you don't have taco seasoning on hand, use Taco Seasoning I by Bill Echols, it's great and you can cut back on the salt you put into it.  P.S. I have now won two chili cookoff contests; today there were 23 other entries and I won a grill.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

I loved this chili!  But instead of using a jar of salsa and taco seasoning, I used a jar of Amish chili mix/sauce that would be pretty much equivalent to those ingredients.

This is one of the tastiest chili recipes I've come across. However, I'd recommend using 1-2 habaneros instead of the suggested 4 - and two is pushing it. I used two and it's super hot, I almost can't eat it. It goes well with a light beer, it really cools your mouth down. And don't forget to wear gloves when you cut the peppers! Ouch!

The chili was great - earned rave reviews from my husband (my kids thought it was good, too).  I couldn't find fresh habanero peppers so I used 1 jalapeno and cut the rest of the recipe in 1/2.  I used about a 1/2 T each of the chili powder and the black pepper.  I used just a dash of red pepper flakes and a little less than 1 T of cumin.  The chili had plenty of flavor and a lot of spice (more than enough for us Yankees!).  I will definitely make it again.

We really liked this soup.  It is not for the faint hearted. It is definitely hot, but very tasty.  If you can handle the heat, be sure to give this one a try.

Quick, easy, inexpensive, and flavorful.  
I'm not a lover of overly spicy food, so I used one seeded jalapeno pepper instead of the 4 habaneros.  I also got the chili beans and salsa in the mild flavor.  Ended up using about a 1/4cup of chili powder and added about 1/8 cup of garlic and onion powder.  The recipe didn't specify if we are suppose to drain the canned beans and tomatoes... I didn't drain some of my cans of tomatoes and my chili was a little too soupy so I had to add another can of drained beans... so my advice is to drain everything except the chili beans.  The salsa will add the right about of liquid back into the chili.  
I served ours with sour cream and cheese, the end result was yummy with a little kick... no burn.

This chili was the best I have ever made!  I only used one small habanero chili after I read the reviews.  That was the perfect temperature.  I also forgot to buy the hot salsa so I left it out.  But it was still great.  Thank you!

My husband and I don't like spicy food, but I wanted a good bean-heavy chili recipe, so I took this and removed the slow burn! No peppers, mild salsa, and no red pepper flakes, and chili beans in mild sauce instead of spicy. I also cut the whole recipe in half since there are just the two of us, so I use 1 28-oz. can of tomatoes and one can each of the three beans. My husband loves it with ground beef or shredded chicken, so I cook one or the other with about a third of the total spices, which gives it a nice flavor, then add it to the pot. We love it!

I was really surprised at how good this really tastes. As I was making it I was really expecting all heat and no flavor, but I was wrong. It does have a great flavor, but it's not for the faint of heart. It is really hot! I like spicy food, but this is even a bit extreme for me.

I found this recipe years ago and I absolutely love it. When I first made it I followed the entire recipe and boy was it spicy! It made me love and crave spicy food from then on. Since family members are unable to eat such spicy food I have tweaked it some to cut out  some heat - one batch I omitted the habaneros (I add them in for myself but 2 or 3 and I don’t seed them later on), use chili beans in a mild or medium sauce,  etc but this recipe is still my base.

Final result was good; however based on other recipes decided to add sugar, oregano, beef bouillon cubes, and Worcestershire sauce to get a more complete/fuller taste. Allowed to simmer for several hours. Going in, suspected heat was too much so cut back spices, and switched out just a couple of jalapenos vs using the original peppers.

The salt was way too high but I made it again with no salt black beans, 1 can no salt green chili tomatoes and 1 can regular, I made the salsa which you can regulate the sodium on your own and used 1/2 package of reduced sodium taco seasoning and it reduced it by at least 50-60%.

This chili recipe has been a mainstay for me for several years now. Awesome. It's easy to make and definitely has a bite to it. I found I could control the heat by cutting back on the quantity of the dry spices which seem to contribute more to the heat than the fresh habanero peppers do. Keeps well in the fridge and is great reheated. 4 habanero's does heat it up quite a lot though so if in doubt cut back to 1-2.

Turned out great! I used about a tablespoon of each of the spices and it was just enough to make it spicy while still allowing enjoyment of the great flavor. Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe for a chili cook-off at a company event this weekend and took second place! I doubled the recipe but only used five of the eight habanero peppers. It is HOT but the flavor is out of this world! We've added this to our favorite at home!! Thanks for the great recipe!! A good chili recipe is not that easy to find!!

Both my husband and I enjoy spicy food, so I was looking for a good chili recipe with a kick.  Unfortunately this recipe was so spicy that it completely overpowered the dish.  I managed to eat one small bowl, but my husband only ate a few bites.
