I bought pre-cubed EXTRA FIRM tofu for this. I drained the water and I didn't freeze it for 24 hours, but only till It was frozen , and left it in the fridge. I used Atkins Teryaki sauce, and it wasn't the least bit overpowering. I only added enough sauce to coat and slightly marinate the tofu. I also just layered the pineapples on the top and used about 1/2 cup of pineapple juice just incase. I marinated the tofu for about an hour. The problem with this recipe is, it has a very basic flavor. So try to spice it up a bit with a little seasoning (make sure it will mesh well with the pineapple and teryaki). Tofu taste like whatever it's cooked in so you don't have to use very much of anthing to get a good flavor. I cooked it in the over till it was bubbly, and I mixed it around a couple of times to coat the pineapple. After it was done cooking, I broiled it for about 5 minutes. I placed the tofu and pineapples on teriyaki noodles, and it was FABULOUS. even my dad enjoyed it and he isn't a big fan of tofu. If this recipe did not work for you, you must of done something wrong. Tofu is very hard to work with.

This recipe turned out ok, but 2 cups of teriyaki sauce is definitely too much.  One cup is plenty.

This was pretty good.  I LOVE teriyaki and the tofu just sucks the flavor up.  It was good with rice the first day, then cold on a salad the next day.  Thanks.

This is one of our favorites!  However...we use low-sodium teriyaki sauce (homemade), we marinate the tofu overnight and the pineapple not at all, we drain all the marinade before baking with the pineapple and we serve it with steamed broccoli.  I also do this side by side with marinated chunked up chicken for the non-tofu eaters in the group.

I was definitely not impressed with this recipe. The flavors sound promising, but the recipe will need to be altered to the point where it would become unrecognizable. If you do want to follow this recipe- I would not marinate the pineapple with the teriyaki. I would use very low sodium teriyaki and use only 1 cup. Use extra firm tofu.

This was great. I don't know what the one reviewer's talking about, but I loved it! A bit less sauce would work well too, but just as is works too. Tofu soaks up suaces so well and it was sweet, tangy and spicy. The pineapple is just perfect. If this does not come out right for you then you did something wrong.

I used crushed pineapple, reduced the teriyaki to 1 cup and cooked the on the stove, adding in 1/2 cup  cold water with cornstarch as a thickener.  It was okay - tasted like very salty teriyaki tofu.  Probably wouldn't make it again.

This was so good and so easy!  I used a high quality teriyaki sauce and ended up pan frying it on the stove at a higher temp and let the tofu firm up and the teriyaki sauce reduce down a bit then served it with rice.  Use a good quality sauce (I used Soy Vey teriyaki sauce) and it turns out great.  I had other things baking in the oven so I used a non stick skillet and pretty much ended up stir frying it and it turned out very good.

This was not that great, it was like eating straight teriyaki I did not taste the pineapple at all.  Trader Vics in Beverly Hills has the best tofu appetizer!! if any one has the recipe please post it.

Forgive me Karla. PLEASE do not waste your time & ingredients on this recipe. I tried making it with some changes, but it was still terrible. The tofu turned to mush-probably from all the salt. You could not even taste the pineapple. It was just horrible.

I'm sorry...this was a waste of food, time, and money.  I had to go to work without a lunch because it turned out so poorly.  I'm really sorry to give it a bad rating, but this just didn't do it for us.

I've tried this twice. My husband really likes it, I don't really, so we've tied at 3 stars. First time I used cheap teriyaki sauce, the stuff that looks just like soy sauce. NOT A GOOD IDEA. It was awful. The second time I bought the thicker stuff (with sesame seeds) and it was better, admittedly. The pineapple is what makes this special.

I have made this three times now so I thought I better write a review finally! I obviously like it a lot and it's always come out perfect for me. Tofu soaks up marinades so well, it's like an edible sponge. The tangyness of the sauce and the tart/sweetness of the pineapple work so well together and I just love that it's tofu and not flesh that's used. Way to go Karla!

I  was in a hurry so I tossed the tofu and pineapple into the fridge with San J gluten free Teriyaki Sauce.  I used only 3/4 of a cup as I prefer my tofu on the crisper side... and left the house for a few hours.  When I returned I saute'ed some sweet red pepper, onion, shaved carrot, and garlic scapes with a light sprinkling of ginger and dry mustard.  Served over basmati rice.  Delicious.  Thank you for the starter idea for my gluten and dairy free meal.

I love tofu, teriyaki sauce and pineapple, but this recipe didn't work.  I used less sauce and diluted it with pineapple juice, but the teriyaki was overpowering and didn't soak into the tofu.  I won't be making this one again.

Easiness rating is a 5. I marinated extra firm tofu in Soy Vay brand teriyaki marinade and sauce. It is thick and full of sesame seeds. I did not marinate the pineapple. I heated the tofu and pineapple together in a skillet using dark sesame oil. Served on a bed of rice. This couldn't get any easier.
