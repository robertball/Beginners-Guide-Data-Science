This is a nice recipe.  I did make some alterations:  crushed the Nilla Wafers and added a bit of butter to make a crust before putting the filling on top.  Also, I put all the Whip cream in the filling instead of putting some on top.  I think next time I'll use another box of the lemon pudding because it wasn't lemony enough for my taste.  I garnished with more wafers and blueberries.  Tasty though!

This dish is really simple and easy to make. Very good flavor. I added the juice of an entire lemon and it made it very lemony.

These were just ok for me but my husband seemed to like it.  I think that the lemon tasted to artifical.  I would maybe make it again but I would use vanilla pudding instead.  Or maybe even one vanilla and one lemon pudding mix.  But it s easy to make.

Pretty good-if I make it again I'll add a lot more lemon juice.
