This was so good and so easy!!!  I was low on white wine, so I added some red wine and I used regular sour cream.  I would also recommend putting the tomatoes in warm water to let them soften, like others have said  It truly makes a difference and ADD MORE!  Next time I will cut the chicken into bite size pieces, so they can truly absorb the sauce.  Thanks!

I made it exactly as described and it was delish! Dill & dijon gives a nice zing; chicken was tender and moist. I used bottled sundried tomatoes in olive oil which i'm sure didn't hurt the flavor any.

Easy dish and always a hit.  Took the advice of another reader and soaked the tomatoes in water. I've added bell peppers or broccoli, lots of mushrooms and have experimented with other veggie combos.  Served this over asparagus-zuchinni rice from this website and was definitely a memorable meal that has been requested more than once.

The sauce in this is delicious! I didn't add any sour cream since I didn't have any, and because of what some other reviewers have said. I also didn't have sundried tomatoes, so I added mushrooms instead. It came out perfect! The mustard and dill flavours work so well together! I think in the future i'll experiment with different vegetables.

This was a good recipe although I think I will alter it somewhat next time.  I too plan to add onions, fresh sliced mushrooms and a tad more garlic.  We served over rice and enjoyed.  Interesting blend of tastes.

I have gotten great reviews on this dish every time I've made it! I love this recipe :). The only change I make is to add artichoke hearts.

Tasty and looks great on the plate.  The flavor is similar to a classy chicken stroganoff.  It was really easy to throw together and everyone got seconds.  That makes it 5 stars in my book!

It took more than 30 minutes to prepare, although this was the first time I made it and once you know what you are doing, it always goes faster!  Do NOT leave out the sour cream, in fact I added a little more and the mustard added such a delightful little zing!  Husband dislikes zucchini but he said he'd rate it a 4 and would eat it again.  Did notice he left some of the sun dried tomatoes on the plate...I would give it a 5 if it was just up to me.  Very pretty but serve on linquini or rice to soak up the yummy sauce.

This was pretty good!  My only comment is that there is way too much dill!  I am going to give the benefit of the doubt and assume that you meant fresh dill weed, I used dried and it was quite overpowering.  So if you are going to cook this and use dried dill - cut it down to about 1/3 of a tsp.

This recipe is fantastic.  It's easy to make after work and my boyfriend begs me to make it all the time. I think the white wine makes all the difference. Thanks:)

This was excellent! I had to make a lot of changes because where I live, I can't get dill, sour cream, or sun-dried tomatoes. Instead I used mushrooms, left out the dill, and added just a little flour to the sauce to make it thicker. It was so flavorful and was excellent served over fresh tagliatelle. I will definitely make this again...maybe tonight???

First thing my man said when he tasted this was "why haven't you made this before?". We both loved it!
I didn't have dried tomatoes, so I put a lot of mushrooms instead, and I doubled the zuccini and the sauce.
Thanks a lot!

Not at all fond of the name, and even less fond of this dish's appearance.  It was beautiful right up until I added the sour cream.  While it did taste good, we first feast with our eyes, and this was  particularly unattractive. Not in a hurry to make this again.

The combination of flavors is excellent, even my finicky husband loves this chicken dish!  I double the quantity of sun-dried tomatoes (be sure to let them plump up completely first) and use regular sour cream. This dish is so yummy I make it often for my family.

Kind of good, kind of odd.  It might have just been that our fresh dill was a little strong but my boyfriend asked if the zucchini were pickles... and I had to agree, they tasted just like pickles after cooking in the sauce.

I'm counting Weight Watcher points so I did not use the flour or butter.  It was outstanding and everyone in my house loved it.  I did add some onion and pepper when I made it a second time

Super recipe with a unique, wonderful flavor. The dill adds a tang that makes it perfect. I also added some fresh sliced mushrooms, which seemed to go very well. Serve over pasta. A keeper that I will be making again!

This recipe should be named 'dijon chicken' as that was the overall flavor. I really did not like the zucchini and the dish itself was boring. I did not make any changes to the recipe. I do not plan on adding this to my regular rotation.

I followed this recipe to the "t" and found it very good.  Quick and simple to make, it was a nice change from everyday blah.  I would make it again, but change something...haven't quite put my finger on what something is, but I will find it!  I found the taste better the next day when I reheated leftovers for lunch. Oh, and I added more zucchini than what was called for.
Thanks!

Very tasty! Even though I had enough liquid in the pan after simmering, I added an extra splash of white wine for flavor before adding the sour cream. I increased the sour cream a bit for extra creaminess. I would have no reservation in serving this to company.

I didn't have zuccini, so I substituted artichokes and added mushrooms.  Wow!  This recipe now has a home in our rotation of go-to meals.  My husband and 5-year old loved it!  Thanks!

This dish was fantastic.  I did doctor it by replacing the zucchini with 3/4 of a can of artichoke hearts and adding another 1/2c of broth.  I served chicken and sauce over papardelli pasta.

Well well well! Restaurant quality??  Oh yea! Not only does it taste like it, but it gives an absolutely beautiful presentation!! I followed this recipe to the "T" and the chicken came out moist and juicy and the sauce is just incredible!! Nice and creamy and full of flavor!! AND...it's sooo quick and easy!! Served this with the "Chickpea Salad with Red Onion and Tomato" and "Garlicky Potatoes" recipes also from this site. Everything went together wonderfully! It really turned out to be a beautiful meal!! This is a must try, true to it's name, 10 star recipe!!

I really appreciate the sauce recipes that don't include canned soup as an ingredient (too much salt and fat).  BUT I also usually avoid using fat-free ingredients because of the lack of flavor and/or texture they can cause, but I went with the fat-free sour cream (& chicken broth), based on other reviewers' input, and it worked well.  This wine sauce is good and the chicken was very tender!  My husband and I both liked it.  Thank you, Monica!

This was just okay.  There was far too much dill in the recipe for my liking.  I also didn't like that the breading on the chicken became so soggy after simmering in the sauce for 10 minutes.  My husband enjoyed the sauce, so if I make this again, I will cut the dill in 1/2, maybe even less, and instead of allowing the chicken to cook in the sauce, I will cook the chicken thoroughly in the butter and then remove it from the pan and finish the sauce.  This way the texture of the crust on the chicken will stay crisp.  The pan drippings from the chicken can still be incorporated in the sauce for added chicken flavor.

Wow.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe maybe because I changed it a bit, but even the white wine sauce was fantastic.  Changes I made:  substituted fresh mushrooms I had left over for the zucchini, added about half a can of artichokes (these really made a difference in the sauce, I think), upped the chicken broth and wine to 3/4 cup each, only used 3 chicken breasts, and seasoned the flour with garlic salt and pepper.  Served over brown rice for me and white rice for the boyfriend.  I'll definitely be making this one again.  I can't believe it's good for you too!  Oh, and I think the chicken was the most tender and juicy that I have ever made.

This was pretty good and makes a great presentation.  The sun dried tomatoes should be soaked in hot water before using for those that don't care for the intense flavor and chewy texture.  We enjoyed it, but I don't think I will be placing it in my recipe box.  There are just too many awesome recipes in the world!!

Wow! So quick and easy, but with great flavor. I was impressed with the whole thing.   I served it on a bed of red pepper rotini, and scattered sauteed broccoli florets and red pepper strips around the outer edge of the plate. Very restaurant-worthy!

This was absolutely, hands down, fantastic.  It wasn't difficult to make and had so much flavor you would have thought I'd spent much more time in the kitchen.

I will admit, I did unintentinally screw up one ingredient.  My grocery sells jars of sun dried tomatoes along with jar'd bruschetta.  I thought I'd grabbed tomatoes, but no.  Since I was at the add it to the pan stage, I just went ahead and added what I estimated to be able 5 chopped sun dried tomatoes worth of the bruschetta.  Oh my goodness!  I cannot imagine doing this dish with anything else now.  Please try it, because believe me, you won't be disappointed!

My husband and I LOVED it!  You can't really go wrong with zucchini, dijon mustard and sundried tomatoes ... yum.  Followed recipe exactly except I don't cook with wine so I didn't have any on hand.  But it was fabulous!  And coming from someone who usually manages to mess up dinner, I am so happy with myself that this turned out so yummy!  Must've been pretty easy for me to pull it off!  Will be making again.

Excellent!  I made this as directed, except that I used extra chicken broth in place of the white wine (didn't have any).  The only change I will make next time is to cube the chicken so that each bite gets coated with the sauce.  Thanks for sharing.

The flavor was very good, and I liked this method for cooking the chicken.  I didn't overcook the zucchini.  Couldn't get the sauce to be smooth, so it looked strange, although it tasted very good.  I'll have to try it again and work on the sauce.

This is a terrific meal. I made two minor changes. I used olive oil instead of butter and added a lot more zucchini. This is indeed a very pretty and appetizing meal. It is also very fast. I served this over whole wheat couscous. I can't wait to have company for dinner so I can serve this.

Dish was fine. Looked good.  Dijon and sun dried tomato flavors were most noticeable.  Given that it's all active prep time, the meal wasn't tasty enough for me to want to try it again.

According to my husband, this was "Da' Bomb!". I was intrigued by the unusual combination of ingredients, but it really works! We weren't super impressed the first time around which is why I gave it 4 stars. After these following modifications it turned into a 5 star meal!First, a sauteed my zucchinni with some mushrooms, onions and garlic in olive oil and butter. I deglazed my pan with chicken broth and added in some fire roasted tomoatoes (and added in some of that broth as well). I never understood why a recipe calls for a floured piece of chicken to simmer in a watery sauce...it makes the chicken extremely soggy, and you lose the beautiful crispiness of the coating. I  seasoned my flour with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I patted my chicken dry, dipped it in the seasoned flour, then in egg, then in the seasoned flour again to make a thicker coating. I  fried my chicken seperate from the sauce in some olive oil while my sauce was simmering.  I agree it was a bit bland, so I added tons of extra dill, dijion, garlic, salt and pepper to the sauce mixture. The sauce ended up being a bit thin (since I didn't simmer the floured chicken in it) so I added some cornstarch and it was a perfect, creamy consistency.  Thanks so much for the creative, delicious recipe.

This was a great dish and easily customizable to your own taste. I followed the recipe for the most part but added a few of my own revisions. I used olive oil instead of butter and omitted the mustard. I used cherry tomatoes instead of sun-dried but I am certain either add the tasty, contrasting tang that makes this dish so delicious. I served the chicken and sauce over rotini and it was delightful Highly recommended!

So I had to do some improvising with this since I didn't have everything on hand.  I was really impressed with how it turned out.  I had some cooked egg noodles in the freezer that I used (boiled in chicken broth--really tasty).  I marinated the chicken in an herb and garlic marinade for about 15 min (could have gone much longer though), sprinkled them with flour and cooked it till it was done in the pan.  

Added one large onion cut bigger than diced, and can of diced tomatoes (without the juice) along with the wine and chicken broth.  Put some italian seasoning in it and some salt.  Cooked that for about 5-10 min until the onions were soft and some of the wine had cooked off, then added sour cream.  I didn't have enough sour cream, so I put in some vegetable cream cheese too.  Added the chicken back in and let it simmer for 5 min or so.  Came out really good served over the egg noodles!  It's great when improvising works out!

I needed a recipe that used chicken, sun dried tomatoes and zucchini, since that is what I had on hand. I was glad to find the recipe...but not very happy with how it turned out. I followed the recipe exactly and I think it turned out as intended, but we did not care for it.

Delicious and healthy!  I made this exactly according to directions and it turned out great.  The white wine, dill and sour cream make an excellent combination.  I would suggest having everything sliced, chopped and measured beforehand, because once it starts cooking it goes pretty fast.  I served this chicken with roasted potatoes (as the author suggested) and spinach salad.  Next time I will serve with pasta or rice to soak up the wonderful sauce!

Yum!  And easy!!  This is also a very "calorie-fat counter" friendly meal.  I did add 4 ounces of baby bella mushrooms and 1/2 cup of onions (which I browned before starting the chicken).  What great flavor and very satisfying.  I made twice the sauce and served the chicken over fresh spinach and a side of spaghetti squash with sauce poured over both.

This is a really fabulous recipe, made with things I never would have thought to put together. The only thing I change is to pull some of the liquid out of the pan and mix it with the sour cream/mustard before adding to everything else. It gets rave reviews at dinner!

This recipe is so easy to make but looks like I spent a lot of time.  It's a great company dinner and definitely one I'll make again and again.  I added a small can of mushrooms and would do that again.

This was rated five stars by my husband and me. It was quick to make. Some reviews said it took longer than 30 minutes, but I'm not sure why that would be. My chicken did take longer to cook, but it wasn't thawed all the way through.
I cooked in olive oil instead of butter, and I used an onion instead of garlic. I used regular mustard because we don't like Dijon. I also used an alcohol free white wine. I did need to add some wine and broth before adding zucchini, onions, and dill. After removing chicken, I added a little bit more broth and I used regular sour cream. Perhaps that's why my sauce was thick enough. It was delicious, and I would definitely make again. Oh, I cooked this in my electric skillet, which reduces sauces easily.

YUMM!  I basically doubled the sauce (but not the dill), and served it over penne pasta!  Since I didn't have chicken breasts, I used skinless chicken tenderloins (about 10).  I also didn't have zucchini so I just left it out.  I doubled the wine, broth, mustard, sun-dried tomatoes (yes, soaked them first!), garlic and sour cream (I used light since I didn't have fat-free)- basically everything except the dill, which I kept at one teaspoon.  After I browned the chicken, I removed it from the pan and cut up each tenderloin into 5 or so pieces.  After adding the broth, wine and mustard to the pan and mixing it together, I then added the chicken back in.  After the 5-10 minutes of cooking, I kept the chicken in the pan and mixed in the sour cream.  I used a 16-oz package of penne pasta, and it was a perfect amount for the chicken and sauce mixture.  The extra sauce made this a nice, saucy dish that I served in pasta bowls.  The dish is pretty and would be a nice meal to serve for company as wel as my family.  I'll definitely be making this recipe again!

How good was this....very!! I followed the recipe pretty close but used broccoli instead of the zucchini and I used sun dried tomatoes in oil (which was actually a bread dip condiment) Sometimes you just have to make do with what you have. I was a little worried about the mustard and the dill but go for it, it's fantastic. I could have eaten the gravy with a spoon it was so good. It looks beautiful on the platter, served it with mashed potatoes and cranberries. I try lots of recipes and now only keep the ones that rate 5 stars...

This recipe is DELISH! We are not fans of Dill weed or zucchini, so we left those out, other than that we followed it to a "T" and it is magnificent. YUM!

Very good. Followed other suggestions and added 1 C broth, which made it too saucy for us. Next time I will add 3/4 C broth. Followed everything else exactly. Hubby, in-laws, and the 1 y/o all liked this one.

Though I didn't make the recipe as published, I wanted other cooks to know just how versatile this recipe is.  We didn't have zucchini so we used broccoli, cauliflower and carrots, but you could have easily added any other veggie.  Didn't have sundried tomatoes so we used roasted red peppers.  Tripled the garlic listed and added in 1/2 red onion, chopped.  Used a scant amount of oil to brown the chicken and non-fat sour cream.  Just throw in whatever you have fresh from the garden or in the fridge and enjoy a healthy, delicious dinner!

Delicious.  You really can't beat it for creamy, low-fat flavor.  I served it over egg noodles so I should've made more "sauce" though.  Also, next time I will just steam the zucchini and add it at the end.  It was a little mushy!

I reviewed this and originally said three stars. But I used country dijon mustard the first time, which is really seedy and grainy. I made it again last night using the regular dijon mustard (I didn't know there was different kinds!) and it was much better. Make sure you get the smooth Dijon! I also doubled the sauce. So now it gets a four star. For this I also add mushrooms, which were yummy, more garlic, seasoned the flour, more wine and less broth, and this time I put in more zucchini since I love it. I served it over pasta, and the sauce was really good with the pasta.

Very good, surprisingly my hubby LOVED it! I added carrots instead of zuccinni. Next time I'll add mushrooms and use semi-dried tomatoes for more flavor. The only thing was I had to add extra water at the end and the sauce wasn't pretty but still very good.

I think mushrooms would have added a bit more complexity to the dish. I added semi-dried tomatoes which REALLY added to the flavour! Using no-fat sour cream really cut back on the calories and adds a hint of creaminess. I followed the suggestion of serving with potatoes which went together beautifully!

Mmmm!  Yummy!  Just finished a delish dinner of Classy Chicken--it's definitely a keeper.  Pretty to look at and great combination of flavors.  Doubled the zucchini and sun-dried tomatoes (which I can't imagine NOT doing--needed that many) and it was perfect.  Added about a half cup more wine than called for and used Pampered Chef's dill mix seasoning instead of just dill.  This dish was unique and very tasty!  Hubby loved it and he's picky!  Thanks for sharing!

Awesome!! I made a lot of changes to the recipe, but it still turned out yummy. Instead of white wine, I used red, I omitted the dill, used double the amount of sun-dried tomatoes, used only about 1/2 tsp. regular mustard and only 1/4 cup of sour cream. It was really good. Next time though I will follow the recipe exactly and see how it tastes!

This was excellent.  I pounded the chicken prior to flouring and increased the wine and broth to 3/4 c each.  I also decreased the dill to 1/2 tsp.and skipped the zucchini. I was concerned that the dill would be over powering but each flavor compimented each other nicely. Well received by everyone.

My family loved this recipe!  I have made it several times now.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly.  I have since tried adding vidalia onion, mushrooms, summer squash with great results.  I recommend soaking the sun-dried tomatoes before adding.  I have served this with pasta and I have also tried it with rice with great results.  This recipe is so easy that I recently made it in an electric skillet on a camping trip.  Thanks for sharing this great dish!

This recipe is really good - kind of Mediterranean.  I used fresh dill from my garden & it was perfect.  Even my husband & son who do not like tomatoes liked this recipe.  Very flavorful.  The only thing I would change would be to add more zucchini, then you don't need to make another vegetable to go with the meal.  Thanks Monica!

This was wonderful!!! I doubled the sauce, added capers, and about 4 cloves of garlic (we love capers and garlic and wanted enough sauce for leftovers).  I used broccoli instead of zucchini because it is what I had.  Also, I cut up the chicken before I cooked it as one reviewer suggested and tossed it in a bag with King Arthur Gluten Free flour, salt, and pepper.  I served it over gluten free pasta.  It has been requested again!!!

Very good recipe.  Our family is not a fan of zucchini, and I had no sun dried tomatoes, so I went with a mix of cauliflower, broccoli and carrots.  I had some cherry tomatoes specifically for this recipe, and forgot to throw them in.
Definitely one of the BEST ways to cook a chicken - supper moist and really flavorful.  My daughter wasn't too sure of the sauce, my wife thought it tasted too sweet in the vegetables, but I loved it.  I made plenty of extra sauce by adding more broth and wine as the level decreased, and I probably used a bit more sour cream than the recipe called for.  I would definitely do this one again, but may vary the wine a bit next time, and try some different veggies

Mine needed way more wine to make the sauce, and next time I'd use less dill, if not substitute some other herb altogether - it was really overpowering. Fine dinner, but nothing to rave about.

So good!  Friends made this the first time I had it, and I couldn't stop thinking about it!  I made them give me the recipe and they just sent me a link to Classy Chicken!  It is absolutely delicious.  I cut the chicken up into bite size pieces and actually QUADRUPLE the sauce (as did my friends)!  I love the sauce so much!  I serve it over couscous  (plain or flavored).  Great recipe!

This was pretty good. I used way more sun-dried tomatoes (love them) and also added mushrooms. Served with a salad on the side. Made for a nice light meal.

I probably would have given this recipe 4 stars, but my husband said he definitely thought it was 5 stars.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I included some fresh sliced mushrooms when the zucchini and tomatoes were added.  The only other change was I used light sour cream instead of fat-free, because that's what I had on hand.  The only thing I would change is to cut the dill down to maybe 1/2 or 3/4 tsp, as I thought the dill flavor was a little overwhelming.  (Surprisingly, my husband thought the dill flavor was perfect and I tend to be the one who likes dill more.)  Lovely served over a modified version of Oven Brown Rice from this site and green beans.

The chicken was pretty good and the sauce was great.  You couldn't taste the dill at all and the zucchini got very soggy well before the cook time was up.  I decided to skip the flour to cut carbs for South Beach. I can't imagine needing the flour for this recipe.

Very good. My husband who normally is not a fan of chicken dishes really enjoyed this meal. I had to make a few changes based on a lack of ingredients.  Instead of chicken broth, I used 1/2 cup of french onion soup.  Had no zucchini so I substituted well-drained  and sliced artichoke hearts.  I also used olive oil instead of butter for browning the chicken, as I'm trying to cut back on fat.

my husband and I loved this one. The dill and mustard were a nice change from what we usually have. I added some mushroom and used 4 cloves of garlic. Next time I'll season the chicken more and cook it separate and add at the end.

Except adding onions, I followed the recipe exactly. We were disappointed by the finished product. I don't know which of the ingredients was causing it but there was something bitter in the sauce, ended up throwing out the sauce altogether and making something else.

Made a few changes, but it was amazing
No zucchini(hate the stuff), Substituted 1/4 package frozen spinach, 2 cups fresh mushrooms. I also forgot the dill but it was amazing. My husband absolutely loved it. He said it was a make again recipe. Its a great "gourmet" meal you can make at home without spending tons of money. I used spinach fettuccine as well to give it more color.

Incredible--I always get rave reviews whenever I make this.  I always have people telling me that this recipe is the first time they've ever liked zucchini.  I usually serve it with steamed broccoli (topped with a little oregano) and basmati rice mixed with toasted pine nuts and a smidge of butter.

THE BEST CHICKEN DISH EVER! This was so good. As this was cooking I made Sauteed Portobellos and Spinach (from this site) then I mixed the two dishes together and served it all over whole wheat egg noodles. My husband loved it and the leftovers were great too!

I will definatly make this again.  It had nice flavors and was fairly easy once I figured it out.  

The only problem was, something was missing!  It didnt have a very distinct flavor - not sure what it was, but I will definatly experiment with it for next time!

This was excellent!!! Super tastey & super easy.  Everyone, including my 10 year old loved it.  The chicken turned out so tender and full of flavor.  My husband who doesn't like zuchinni ate them up.  Thanks for a great recipe.

this was pretty good!  i doubled up on all ingredients, except the chicken so that i could pour the sauce over vermicelli pasta. i think i could have done without the Dijon mustard. i also used Italian bread crumbs mixed with Parmesan cheese instead of flour.

I thought this was delicious and so easy!  I ended up uses a can of diced tomatoes, drained, instead of the sun-dried tomatoes.  I'm sure this made it a little less "classy", but it gave me extra liquid which made plenty of sauce. I had the leftovers the next day over rice- delicious!

Delicious! I also doubled the sauce and served it all over top of brown rice. I used light sour cream and added some flour to make the sauce a little thicker. Next time I will add more of a variety of vegetables.

I haven't reviewed/rated a recipe in a while, but when I had this one for dinner last night, I just had to let you all know that it was FANTASTIC!!  It WAS very easy and had a really wonderful taste!  Next time I make it though, I'm going to make a little more sauce and serve it over pasta!  I think that would be fabulous!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Fantastic!  I typically don't like wine in things very often because I think it tastes too strong, but this was great!  I followed the recipe exactly, and the only thing I wish I'd done differently was reread the reviews to find out how to make the sauce thicker.  It was fabulous, and I plan on trying the sauce as a pasta sauce, I'm really looking forward to it!  Thanks for this!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong - but I thought this dish was odd.  It just had a strange combination of flavors.  I think I may have liked it, without the sour cream.  Won't be making this again.

This was delicious! But it did take longer than 30 minutes to prepare. The only thing I did different was to leave out the dill because I'm not a fan of dill and didn't have any on hand. I also used regular sour cream. I did have to add a little extra broth at the end as the recipe suggested. I also soaked the tomatoes in water before I put them in as one reviewer recommended which was a good idea. Served it with roasted potatoes and steamed brocolli as Monica suggested. It would also taste great over noodles. Great meal!!

I'm not a big fan of stove top cooked chicken because it's hard to not overcook but the flavor of the seasonings and sauce were awsome, so I didn't mind too much.I used mushrooms instead of zucchini but I don't think it hurt the recipe any. My daughter thought the sauce tasted too much like wine so this may not be a kid recipe. And my sour cream did not separate like some reviews said. (Be sure to remove from the heat before briskly whisking in the cream.) Great quick recipe!

This recipe was pretty good but not quite as great as expected based on reviews. I subsituted mushrooms for the asparagus. My suggestion would be to leave out the sun dried tomatoes. They add a very acidic taste to an otherwise delicate sauce. I'd make it again but with some adjustments.

First, I have to say I forgot to add the sour cream, but it was still very tasty. My husband, son and I really liked it. My daughter, however, didn't care for it. It did take longer to prepare than the recipe said. It was closer to an hour from start to finish. I will probably fix this again, much to my daughters horror:-)

A friend recommended I try this and it was worth it! It was so easy and good...I actually made it two weeks in a row. It tastes and looks like something you'd get in a restaurant. I served it with roasted potatoes and another time with pasta. Both times were a hit!

This was good, but not as good as I had expected. Hubby commented that he thought it was a little bland. I prefer Chicken Milano from this site. Doubt I will make this again. I rounded up from 3.5 stars.

This was one of those where it sounded great in theory, but the reality was not what I imagined. I didn't care for the sauce. It tasted too strongly of sour cream, which  I normally like, but not so much at one whack. I could see making it again, subbing some cream or a little half&half for the sour cream. Also, beware the salty broth. If you use that to thin the sauce, it can be very salty in the end. Wine added to thin the sauce gives it quite a boozy punch, so I'd thin it with milk (any fat level).  I'll play around with it further and see if I can get the sauce I'd imagined this would be.

This was awesome.  So very elegant and my family agrees.  I did use a whole can of chicken broth.  I thought the dill sounded a little strange so I used basil instead (in store bought pesto/garlic form).  This was alot of food for our family so with the left-overs I made a chicken pot pie.  Another great meal!

If I could give this 10 stars, I would!  By far my favorite chicken recipe yet.  I will make this for my boyfriend and I when I need a quick, easy, DELICIOUS dinner.  It took me a half an hour only.  Thank You!  I added onions b/c I just love them, used a full cup of chicken broth as was reccomended by others and fat free sour cream.  I did need extra gravy so after removing the chicken, I threw a little more wine and broth in before adding the sour cream.  Delish!!!  Very moist :)

Ok, this is my what I did.  I only used 2 chicken breast halves and took the advice of others and increased the chicken broth to 1 cup.  I used mushrooms instead of zuchinni, and I left out the sundried tomatoes (I didn't have any).  Once it was done cooking, there was a lot of liquid left over, so I added half a bag of stuffing mix.  It made it a thick gravy and a meal in itself.  It turned out to be something diffent than the original, but it was very good and I will definitely make it again - the same way.

This is a great recipe!  I made a couple of substitutions due to lack of ingredients.  I used Honey Mustard instead of Dijon and I used mushrooms instead of Zuccini and Rosemary instead of Dill.  My husband LOVED it and I agree!!!  EXCELLENT!  Thanks!

My husband took one bite of this dish and asked when I would make it again.  Unfortunately, the children weren't too thrilled about the taste of wine - perhaps it's more of an adult meal. Instead of coating the chicken with flour, I cut the breasts into tenderloin strips and cooked them on the George Foreman Grill.  This left more room in the pan for the remainder of the ingredients to cook.  I used six breast halves, and doubled the remainder of the ingredients, which turned into a very nice sauce.  When everything was ready, I served the chicken strips on top of angel hair pasta and then topped the chicken with the sauce.  One more note: I added half of a chopped onion and a spoonful of capers to the sauce.  These additions weren't necessary, but since I had them on hand I decided to use them.

My husband and I both liked this alot!  I changed some things, mostly based on what I had on hand.  I used whole wheat flour, only 1 tbsp margarine, regular mustard, and LOTS of fresh tomatoes and zucchini (garden was good to us).  I expected more sauce to have to pour over pasta, but it was easy to make at the end with extra broth and wine.  The leftovers were good, also, and it was great to have a whole meal in one container (we had leftover pasta and like I said, tons of zucchini that we mixed up in sauce and stored away with the chicken).

Yum!  Loved this recipe.  Took the lead from other reviewers and added an entire package of sliced baby bella mushrooms.  Also doubled the garlic and sundried toms.  Only 7 points per serving if you're on Weight Watchers.  Paired as suggested with steamed broccoli.  No leftovers!  Thanks for the awesome recipe.

I had to substitute red wine for white and stewed tomatoes for sun-dried...  I would use less dill next time, and maybe add mushrooms like others recommended.  My sauce was very thin.  It was good...but nothing spectacular.

FABULOUS! I left out the zucchini (not a fan) and used half of a small bag of sun-dried tomatoes that were already julienned, it was so delicious! Very impressive and really easy and quick, if not a little messy to make. I used a low-sodium fat-free chicken broth, and chablis was perfect for this dish.

This dish is DEEEEELICIOUS!!!!  My husband and daughter loved it.  The sauce is amazing.  I followed the recipe exactly but next time will use 1 cup of chicken broth, as other reviewers suggested, because we like a lot of sauce.  This recipe is definitely a keeper and I'll be making it often.  Thanks!!

very very good. i agree with one poster who said it was on the salty side, however. i did let my sdtomotoes soak for a long time. i guess i'll have to do it even longer. i took people's advice and added an entire containter of mushrooms that i sliced. DIVINE!!! the sauce is amazing. like one person said, i didn't want to add the sour cream becuase i liked the sauce as is. but becuase of the saltiness (and no, i didn't add ANY salt to the dish, even the chicken), i added 2 tablesppons of sour cream. beautiful!! it was quite yummy. i can't even believe i made it, lol!!! thanks os much for the recipe. like i said, i took off a star for the salt factor, but otehrwise, scrumptious! :)

Overall this was very good.  When my husband saw it he said, "It does look classy!  Let's eat at the table instead of in front of the TV."  I did make a couple changes.  I cubed the chicken breasts and added more garlic.  I served it over pasta.  I think next time I will add fresh mushrooms as well.  Great recipe!

This dish is awesome and oh-so-easy to make!  The flavor is perfect!  I recommend not using low fat sour cream. It makes the sauce a little gritty. Still tasty though.  Try adding fresh mushrooms with the zucchini. It's a very nice addition.  I served with garlic-butter pasta. I'm serving this at my next family get together!! Thanks Monica.

This was really good; a great change for chicken.  I was a bit skeptical because I didn't think I was much of a dill fan, but the dill really made this recipe.  Excellent.  I did add some sliced mushrooms and a few more sun-dried tomatoes, but other than that, stuck to the recipe exactly.  Easy and quick!  Thanks!

I liked this recipe, but it definitely took more than 30 minutes. I do not cook every single night, but I am pretty good in the kitchen, and it took me about an hour from start to finish. Of course, next time it might not take me that long....
The dish was good, it was lacking something though, and we couldn't figure out what that was. (I think my husband sprinkled too much dill weed on it also!)
I will make again. The sauce was good. This is a dish that will be wonderful the next day once the flavors have seeped in!

We enjoyed this very much!  A family favorite now! We julienne carrots along with the zuccini.  Works great with frozen chicken tenderloins and served over a colorful pasta if you are in a hurry.

Great tasting recipe and very easy to make. The combo of the sun-dried tomatoes, dijon, sour cream and dill is very nice. Add whatever veggies you have on hand to vary it. My only complaint is I have no idea what "springy" chicken is, but it turned out fine anyway!

Added mushrooms, onions and used veg. broth instead of chicken broth & wine. Used 1 14 oz. can, and had enough sauce.  Used sun dried tomatoes in oil. Served over leftover noodles, but will do much better over rice next time instead.  Will make again. Thanks Monica!

Very tasty.  Myhusband and I both loved the flavor of the sauce.  I added carrots and onions and extra zucchini and served it over egg noodles.  I also added extra wine and broth at the end (as the recipe suggests) as it definitely needed more sauce.

This recipe is super-easy to make and absolutely delicious.  The zucchini ends up buttery soft and melt-in-the-mouth, and the sauce is so tasty I recommend serving crusty bread with it so that people can mop up every last drop!  I served this with homemade potato wedges but I think pasta would really be the perfect accompaniment.

The ingredients in this dish sounded good but I didn't find the result too appetizing.  Also, I'd never cooked w/sun-dried tomatoes before and didn't chop them up enough - they were SALTY.  Probably won't make again.

I followed it to the letter, except that I doubled the sauce. The dill was too much for our taste. And we did not care for the nonfat sour cream either. We loved the chicken, but couldn’t stand the sauce.

Absolutely delicious!  I didn't have any sun dried tomatoes so I added a small jar of sweet roasted red peppers which I chopped  and omitted the dill.  This recipe is very forgiving so you definitely can make some substitutions and it still tastes great.  Thanks.

I didn't have sundried tomatoes so I used regular tomatoes And it was still very tasty. The sundried tomatoes would definitely add that zing to the dish. Everybody gobbled it up and had seconds! Easy to make too!!

I made this recipe and it was delicious...I did tweak the recipe a bit since I honestly think it is physically impossible for me to cook w/o onions...before browning the chicken , I pre-cooked mushrooms and onions and then removed them from the pan, and then added them back when I added the zucchini...after completing the recipe I served it over mini bow tie pasta...yum

It wasn't for me. It was too much sour cream for me - overwhelmingly so. I will admit that I'm a picky eater, so it very well could just be that.

Very disappointing.   I followed the recipe carefully  and cannot figure out why this recipe is rated so highly.  The mustard and sun-dried tomatoes contribute too much tanginess with no other ingredients to  balance or complement their flavors. Even the usual delight of a wine sauce was highjacked.  I have no suggestions for improvement.

This is truly a classy chicken!  I added summer squash as well.  You can really add any veggie you want.  I did double the chicken broth and wine for more sauce and didn't need to use as much flour as it calls for.  Try it as written and adjust if you need to..it has a wonderful flavor as is...

Very delicious served over rice! I mostly followed the recipe but made a few modifications. I took the advice of other reviewers and cubed (~1") three medium-large chicken breasts, cooked for about 2-3 minutes after browning (1/2 cup flour is enough) for "springy". We don't like sun dried tomatoes so omitted it and replaced with a can of mushrooms (didn't have fresh on hand), by preference added a little more dill and 1/3 cup of chopped onions, used low fat sour cream, and added 1/2 cup extra chicken stock.

This was a good recipe. I did use all chicken stock since I did not have any white wine at the moment. It has a really good taste. I did however, only used 1/2 of the amount of dried dill due to comments of it being too strong. I do agree with someone else's comment about the zucchini tasting a bit like cucumbers after cooking. I had to think twice about whether I put the wrong veggie in (homegrown) so I would say it does have the mild pickle taste. All in all I will be making this again and next time trying it with the white wine in hopes it would give it a bit of a stronger flavored sauce. Thanks for sharing the recipe. I will definitely be making this again with a few changes...less dill and using wine. Thanks for sharing! :)

I did not like this. It was very bitter for some reason. I thought it might've been the wine but I've used it in other dishes that tasted great. Just didn't like the combination with the mustard and sour cream.

Wow! This chicken was so moist and tender, and the dijon gives it just the right punch. We used squash instead of zucchini, fresh grape tomatoes instead of sun-dried and parsley instead of dill weed.  I will make this again!

This was good.  I cut the chicken into chunks as another reviewer recommended.  Really good!  I served it over fettuchini but I think it would be better over rice.  I'll try that next time.

Excellent! It's easy and takes little effort. Made per recipe except I didn't have the sun dried tomatoes so I used a can of diced tomatoes instead.  Would definitely make again!

My husband and I loved this recipe, I followed the recipe closely except omitted the sun-dried tomatoes as we couldn't find them at the store.  I've only made it once since it takes some planning ahead to have all of the ingredients on hand, but I plan on making it again one day!

this is a very good recipe, once you make it a few times.  i use chicken breast tenders, add pepper and johnny's seasoning while frying, use two zucchini, and use fresh chopped up tomato instead of sundried.  i also use a little less mustard than called for and a little more sour cream. i add the sour cream into the pan with the chicken, instead of serving separately.  i then add a little garlic salt, which i think makes everything better!  my husband and i really enjoy this meal over rice.

This dish is yummy!  I've made it twice; the first time I didn't add zucchini or sundried tomato.  The second time I added both.  With or without veggies it's great!  I do only use 2 or 3 chicken breasts since there's only two of us.  I cut them in half and pound them out.  I also use Riesling for the white wine (even though sometimes that can be sweeter instead of dry).  Excellent recipe!  I plan to try some of the other variations suggested.

I've made this recipe about 5-6 times, and I always love it.  I make it with a side of classic risotto (adding dill weed, minced sun dried tomatoes and the mustard to compliment the flavors of this dish).  I don't have dijon, so I substitute 1/2 TB honey and 1/2 TB yellow mustard.  I sub olive oil for the butter and skip the sour cream.

This was excellent!  I added lots of mushrooms to it with the zucchini and it really gave it a good flavor.  The sun-dried tomatoes are a MUST in this dish.  I just bought a can of already prepared sun dried tomatoes in olive oil and it worked perfectly.  My husband loved it and I will definitely cook this again!

Great recipe!  I didn't have chicken broth on hand, and the sauce turned out creamy and tangy.  Also, I started by cooking the garlic and dill in the butter on low heat, and then added the chicken breasts.  I removed the chicken when it was cooked, and then proceeded to make the sauce from the chicken juices and left over butter, garlic and dill.  This was to keep the chicken crispy on the outside, and not over cook it.  It turned out great!  My husband loved it!

Didn't change a thing other than I didn't use zucchini and I used sun-dried toms soaked in olive oil (did not use the oil but I might next time). The flavors were a WOW! Loved it! Made a side of pasta tossed with fresh basil and parsley as well as a side of asparagus with toasted almonds. A meal easily $25 per plate in any restaurant by me (WI). All around - save this recipe - it's a keeper!

I'm only dissapointed that I just found this recipe now...it's so good!  I used whole wheat flour and added salt, pepper, and paprika to the flour before coating the chicken with it.  I caramelized onions and mushrooms and added them to the skillet at the end.  Delish!

Pretty darn good!  My husband came home from the farmer's market with zucchini and heirloom tomatoes and I wanted a nice cold-weather-friendly dish to serve.  The chicken was cooked perfectly.  Since I used fresh tomatoes instead of sun-dried, I added them just a minute before serving.  I think we will make this again!

This recipe was delicious!  I only made some slight changes to suit my family. I upped the sour cream to half a cup, used 3 zuchinni instead of one, and substituted artichoke hearts (from a jar, drained the oil) instead of the sundried tomatos. Will definately make again. The sauce was excellent.

This was a wonderful tasting supper!  I doubled the wine/broth/sour cream and the extra sauce was so tasty.  It was great to dip our bread in.  Very easy with such a unique flavor.  It's not easy to get my boys to eat baked/poached chicken but they were pleased.  Thanks!

Really liked this- going to try it next time with brocolli instead of zuchinni.  I think I might not put so many sun dried tomatoes to.  But it was really tasty and moist.  I had it with pasta.

Quite good... I decided to make this recipe because I had most of the ingredients in the house. I didn't have any sour cream, so I added a bit of low fat miracle whip... didn't have any white wine on hand, so I double the chicken broth. Found that I had to add a bit more with the sauce at the end. Very tasty over rice, but I think next time I will try the same sauce but cut up the chicken into smaller size pieces.

Very sour!  It bothered me how poor tasting this dish was.  I doubled everything except for the chicken because I wanted to serve the extra sauce over angel hair pasta.  I guess with all the combos of sour (dijon, dry wine and sour cream) I should have realized it could turn out that way.  I would have only rated 1 star if I hadn't altered the recipe by doubling the sauce.  However if the sauce was any good this should not have made a difference.  BTW, I checked and rechecked the recipe to ensure I made it correctly.  Way to pungent for my taste.  YUCK, not worth the ingredients.

I absolutely loved this meal!!!  I made it for my boyfriend and I as a celebration meal for his new job.  
A couple of tips:  As the chicken and veggies cooked in the broth and wine, it began drying up a bit, so I added a bit more wine and a teensy bit of the broth.  
I also used a jar of minced garlic instead of a clove, and a jar of diced sindried tomatoes in olive oil.  The final result was delicious!  I would recommend draining the olive oil from the tomatoes before adding them to the skillet.
I plan to make this for a family dinner party very soon!  This is now one of my favorite chicken recipes!

I thought this recipe was extremely yummy! I didn't have any sun dried tomatoes on hand though, so i just cut up a fresh tomato. I doubled the garlic, and used teas. of olive oil instead of butter, and cut down on the dill a little. The sour cream makes the chicken sooo tender. Yummmmmmm can't wait to try different alterations! Thanks so much for the recipe its going to be a weekly meal for me ! :)

This recipie was easy but we did not like the taste of the sauce. The chicken tasted fine, but the sun dried tomatoes were gross and the zucchini became mushy. I'm deleting this from my recipie box.

A big hit with my husband, who is a diabetic. I served it on whole-wheat egg noodles. The sun-dried tomatoes give this dish a kick.

I thought this was just OK...a little too strong of a dill flavor for me.  I think it might have been better with thyme or basil-maybe next time I'll try that.

I made this last night and my husband and I really liked it. I did substitute the zuccini with mini bell peppers, and I only and 2 sun dried tomatoes, so I added olives and capers. Otherwise, I followed the recipe step by step, and it was wonderful.

This was pretty good. I liked the interesting combination of flavors, but my husband was confusing the zucchini for pickles (since I included dill in the recipe). Maybe the flavor combination was just a little too "out of the ordinary" for him.

I have been searching for a really impressive dish for dinner parties and this is it! Fancy looking and tasty! I paired it with some long grain rice and the Broccoli with Garlic Butter and Cashews recipe which can be found here. Absolutely wonderful and I will definitely be making it again!

Wonderful recipe. The only change I made was to double the amount of zucchini. Served it at a family dinner party for visiting relatives. Everyone raved, including both of my 20-something nephews, who requested the recipe so they could impress their girlfriends!

Not my most favorite dish. The sauce had a good flavor but the chicken itself was pretty bland. I might try it with veal and add capers. I made it exactly according to the recipe except I cut the chicken into cubes. I was somewhat disappointed.

I added some artichoke hearts and feta to the sauce. It never came together as a real sauce, but it tasted fantastic!!! I will definately make this again, and play with the spices some. I'd give it a 5 except that it didnt look very appealing... Thanks!

I really thought this was a strange flavor combination. I LOVE sun-dried tomatoes and I love white wine in cooking. But all together it was weird for me. Maybe try it without the mustard?

Wow-- this is delicious!  I've never tasted something like this before. I didn't have zuccini so I just made it without it and it was still great. I was cooking for a larger group, so I used 8 chicken breasts but doubled the sauce recipe. I LOVE the sauce so I think next time I'll make even more sauce for the same amount of chicken.

What a great sauce! Creamy, tangy - and low in fat is you use a fat free or light sour cream. Next time I'm going to double it just to have more sauce leftover!

This was absolutely wonderful!  I only used 3 chicken breasts because they were so huge, so I smashed them a bit for even cooking.  I used light butter.  I only had white cooking wine, not dry, but the sauce was wonderful!  I followed what another reviewer said and replaced the sun-dried tomatoes with a whole can of artichoke hearts, cut up.  This is fancy enough for company, but very easy and took less than 30 minutes.  We look forward to having it again!

I used same quantities except only 2 chicken breasts. And I used mushrooms instead of zucchini. I thought the sauce was pretty tasty. I wanted to give 3 stars but realize it's because I overcooked the chicken, my fault not the recipes. My husband really enjoyed.

Very good sauce. I substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream and used grape tomatoes instead of sun dried, because it was what I had.  Also, added frozen broccoli and served over brown rice. Chicken was moist and veggies were tender!

Tried this recipe yesterday, it was ok. I am not a fan of dill, but I will try this again, but cut the amount of dill in half.

We really liked this.  The sauce was delicious.  I doubled the amount of zucchini & served it with soem pasta, but otherwise followed the recipe to a t.  I agree that you should double the ingredients for the sauce since it is so good!

I cut the chicken up, floured it, browned it, removed it from pan and followed the rest of the recipe, adding chicken in at the end to reheat.
Make with rice, not potatoes.
Great, tasty, easy,

Not only was this dish delish, it was so easy to put together!!!  I didn't have any white wine so I substituted Vermouth and it worked just fine. My husband was late coming home from work tha night but the chicken was still moist after poaching in the broth.  The sauce reheated well and dinner was a hit.

It is a good healthy dish, if I make it again, I'll spice it up some.  It just didn't have enough flavor for us. My 5 year old daughter, who is almost a vegetarian, loved it.

This is a very good recipe, but I think next time, I will marinate the chicken first in some of the ingredients for added flavor. I used roasted red peppers instead of sun-dried tomatos. (Don't really like that flavor.)Other than that, prepared exactly as listed and it was surprisingly good. Will make again soon with those changes. Thanks for the recipe!

This dish seemed awesome until the addition of sour cream at the end.  This seemed to take all the flavor out.  Alot of work for what turned out to be a pretty bland dish.  Doubt I would make it again.

Pretty good! The dish looks amazing on the plate! I thought the mustard taste was a little bit too heavy- I'll probably add less next time. My husband didn't care for the zucchini- honestly, the dish would still be great w/o it. I didn't add the dill weed (personal preference) and added some basil instead. I also took others advice and didn't put as much sour cream in. All in all... a pretty good dish!

Ridiculously delicious. I'm torn, though, on whether it's better or worse to add the sour cream to the chicken sauce at the end--it's almost better without adding the sour cream. Depends if you really crave a cream sauce or not.

Good dish, however, one that we made and enjoyed, but would not make again.  It would be great for company.  Make extra sauce and serve over garlic mashed potatoes.

I made this for Sunday lunch since I had all of the ingredients on hand and was pleasantly surprised by how moist and tender the chicken came out.  This recipe was so easy to follow and smelled delicious while it was cooking.  I'll make it again though I will leave out the sour cream the next time around.  I tasted the sauce just before adding it, and I liked it better before it was added.

We thought this was very good! We omitted the flour, tomatoes, and sour cream because of preference. We seasoned the chix with McCormicks Montreal chicken seasoning and added mushrooms, and sweet onions to it. It really had a nice flavor! Thank you for the recipe!

I just made this for Valentine's Day, it turned out to be beautiful, I am submitting a picture. I only made 2 breasts and I did not use sour cream because my boyfriend does not like cream sauces, other than that I made the recipe as is. It was tasty, we had it over mini penne, yummy. Thanks!

I like this dish a lot.  I used to make it so often that I'm now sick of it, so I haven't made it in a while.

Wonderful!  I will definitely make this again.  The only thing I will do differently is I will keep the sauce on the heat for a minute or so after adding the sour cream just to heat it through.

This is the best chicken I have ever tasted!! I made it for my fiance one day and ended up having to make it two more times that day because so many people wanted to try it.  It was a hit!!!

This was different and tasty, but family says 3 *'s. NOTE: The base is really nice for the chicken (flour, butter, wine and broth). I think I might use it with some other sauce combinations. Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't like this very much. I thought that the flavor was strange. The flour on the chicken wasn't necessary- and the dill/mustard/tomato combination didn't quite click.

I thought this was a very tasty dish, and not difficult to prepare.  I did add a couple of extra garlic cloves since in my house that's a necessity.  My fiance also enjoyed the dish (minus the zucchini - but that was his loss!) I'll make this one again.

Unfortunately, we did not care for much for this one.  Kind of flavorless.  I followed the recipe exactly,except for adding more broth at the end because it all evaporated at the end of cooking.  Not making again.

Excellent recipe!  I followed *almost* exact.  I did pound the chicken breasts and dredge them in whole wheat flour.  Then I sauteed onions first (fast and hot so they were like roasted) and then browned the chicken in the same pan.  Omitted sundried tomatoes since I had none.  I did need to add more liquid (so I used both wine and broth) after simmering with zucchini and used low fat sour cream.  Finally I added baby spinach leaves to wilt and I served the sauce with vegetables over the chicken.

Really great. Tastes like it has more calories/fat than it actually does. I added mushrooms as other reviewers suggseted -- it was a great addition. I don't feel like the sun-dried tomatoes really added that much to the dish. I used one chicken breast, and thought the amount of sauce was perfect. I also used low-fat sour cream, rather than no-fat sour cream and reduced the amount of dill weed to taste. Be sure to pick a white wine (chardonnay is good) that you would want to drink with the meal.  One other note: I thought the food (the zucchini  and sauce) cooled off very very quickly. My first bite was cold. So maybe using a warming plate, or just getting it to the table quickly is a good idea.

This recipe was popular at my house.  I made just the few following changes... I used 4 whole boneless, skinless chicken breasts, one cup of chicken broth, an extra zucchini, and sliced mushrooms (but kept everything else the same).  It was great, and I thought the sauce tasted even better the next day.  Thanks so much for sharing.

I LOVE this chicken! Turned out wonderful, moist and creamy.  Love the wine sauce.  I, too, added fresh sliced mushrooms when I added the zuchini.  Also added more garlic, omitted dill weed since I didn't have any, added two more sundried tomatoes, and used low fat instead of fat free sour cream.  Definite keeper, picky bf didn't care for it very much, but this dish is too good to put aside, and for once I'm saying "too bad!" and this will be a frequent meal.

This recipe was excellent and quick. I did without the sun dried tomatos added extra squash and zucchini to make it a whole meal. I served this to my boyfriend over linguini and he was truly impressed because I'm far from Domestic. This was a great way to have delicious food that is low in fat and carbs. A+

This took longer to make than I expected, but turned out GREAT!  My fiancee said it was one of the best dishes I've ever made... and that says a lot.  Small changes - I used more sun -dried tomatoes, fresh dill and tore the cooked chicken into chunks.  Only drawback... did not taste as good as leftovers. :(

After all the rave reviews, I was pretty disappointed in the results.  The sauce was too "sour" for our taste.  It is fairly low fat, which is a plus I guess.

this is a really good and easy recipe. It does look like something you would get at a fine dining restaurant (it taste like it too!) It was just a little dilly for me.  My husband liked it very much.  Will be repeating this one.  My husband wants a little more garlic next time though.
Thanks for a great recipe!! Its a keeper at my house!

Fabulous! Didn't change a thing (that I know of - I'm not real good about using measuring spoons) and it turned out perfect, was easy to prepare. Picky husband said it was great without me even asking how he liked it. That's when I know a recipe is a hit. Thanks for sharing!

For all the rave reviews, this was just ok. I thought with the sour cream and acid in the tomatoes, it was WAY too tangy (acidic). I might try replacing the tomatoes with the mushrooms. My husband, who ususally eats anything, wasn't impressed, either.

Extremely easy to make and quick like you promised!  The hardest part was getting the cork out of the wine.  I used young chicken thighs instead of breasts, which cuts cook time in half.  Zucchini still had plenty of time to cook though.  Also, I had run out of sour cream so I served the sauce without.  My husband thought it tasted great and probably wouldn't add sour cream next time anyway.

Excellent recipe...one cup of flour may be a bit to much for dredging. I added more zucchini and some yellow squash and it was a hit served with mashed potatoes.

EXCELLENT!!!!  I will use less flour next time & more garlic.  This really makes you feel like you made something special for your family.  Very easy.

It was beautiful, but instead of Zuccini I used mushrooms as I just don't like Zuccini and it was lovely...quite easy and straight forward...thanks for great recipe!

This was a good recipe. I am giving it only four stars because I had no wine to use in the recipe and I think that would have made a difference. I'll try again using the exact ingredients.

Easy, Quick, and Tasty!  My kids ate the zuchini and sun dried tomatoes and even commented on liking the chicken!  Yeah! We'll be keeping this one.

Very good, LOTS of flavor.  Though my 3 year old didn't care for it. Definitely an adult dish.  We did modify by using low fat sour cream instead of fat free.  Easy to prepare.  Chicken seemed chewy, probably just the chicken brand though.

Edible, but that's about it.  

It was too spicy for my taste.  I wouldn't make it again.

This was a delicious main dish!  My husband doesn't like heavy sauces and this was just right. I decided to serve a vegetable on the side and omit the zucchini.  Any leftover chicken (there wasn't much!) tasted just as fresh the next day.

Wonderful!  I may have cooked it too long because it seemed to need more sauce and my sauce turned out a delicious color of brown -- still excellent!  And it did have a gourmet restaurant quality.

Excellent! I made this recipe for a family the day I first saw it in the newsletter. They loved it and asked for the recipe! Friends of theirs asked also. I made it for ourselves and we agree, and will make it a regular favorite. Thanks for sharing. By the way, I soaked the sundried tomatoes in hot water until moist and soft before using.

This is the first recipe I have tried from Allrecipes.  I LOVED IT! I tried it before the sour cream was added and it tasted just as good, so you might like to omit the cream for a lighter version.  Definately tastes like something you would buy at a restaurant but better!
