This is a really tasty blend, easily made with spices you already have on hand.  I made a half recipe which was enough to fill half a standard size spice jar. Excellent on roasted chicken and potatoes, eggs, anything really! I put some on my steak tonight and it was delicious! I can't wait to experiment some more with it!

I have made this recipe several times, and it has become my go-to secret ingredient!  I use it on pretty much all cooked vegetables, in soups, etc.  My only change was  omitting red pepper (I have 3 littles), but I'm sure it would be even better with heat.  Definitely recommend!

Every year at Christmas, my grandma would send us what we called nuts and bolts, which was basically a modified chex mix. It was my favorite Christmas item each year, and sadly the recipe died along with her several years ago. Every Christmas since I have tried and failed to replicate such a cherished family memory. It was never quite right. THIS was what I was missing! This recipe minus the ground red pepper made my mix taste just like Grandma used to make. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!

This is a great blend. I only used half as much red pepper and it still has a little bite to it. I can't imagine why I had never tried this before.

Fair warning, if you use freshly ground black pepper, you will need less as it is more potent

Really good balance of flavors for almost any meat, but too much black pepper for me. Next time I'll use only 2 tsp instead of 4.

Great basic seasoned salt recipe. Tweak to your taste, but it's an excellent base. Just remember it's a seasoned SALT.

Easy. Ingredients found in most kitchens. Use fresh high quality spices. I added 1/2 teaspoon parsley flakes, crushed and 1/4 teaspoon celery seed. Store in a shaker tightly closed to prevent caking. Add a couple dried beans to help prevent  caking if it becomes a problem.

I made this because I ran out of Lowrey's and needed for dill dip. Right now I'm wishing I would have ran to the store and bought some. It was really salty.

Ran out of seasoning salt when I went to make my homemade tortilla chips. Found this recipe and stuck pretty close to it. I didn't have any regular  paprika on hand so I used a hot paprika, essentially ground chili peppers and a shake or two of red pepper flakes to give it an extra kick. Also used a smidge less onion powder than called for,  just due to personal taste. This was excellent on my chips! Better than any store bought seasoning salt I've  used! Can't wait to experiment with it in different recipes!

This is an excellent blend.  It's certainly worth having some on hand.  The good news is you get to control the amount of salt.

I added 1/4 tsp celery salt, 1 tsp turmeric, and divided the paprika, 1/2 tsp sweet and 1/2 tsp smoked. I also used pink sea salt because that was what I had on hand.
Freshly ground black pepper too.

I looked at the Lowerys label and it has turmeric so I added a 1/4 tsp. I quit using store bought because of the sugar and enhanced flavorings. This turned out great, I always use seasoned salt on pork chops and this was perfect.

I octuple this recipe and fill up an empty Parmesan container. We use it all the  time, and on everything!! Its great. I substitute cayenne for ground red pepper since they are from the same plant. Wonderful all purpose seasoning!!

I used about a third of the salt (pink Himalayan sea salt) and went light on the red pepper since I only grew some hotter peppers (dried, ground Wrinkled Old Man peppers).  I added lime zest which I dried in the sun for a different taste profile for variety. I always double the basic recipe.  I also added 1/2 tsp. dried, homemade dashi stock (konbu seaweed stock with katsuobushi bonita fish flakes), which supports flavor in lowered salt recipes. This lets me taste my food without swelling my ankles (TMI?) Thanks!

Worked great to season a pork tenderloin I was roasting. Only thing I changed was to not add red pepper.

I tried this as a backup because I was out of store bought seasoned salt.  I like this homemade blend much better!

Easy to make, add this and that, shake and you're done. Funny needed seasoned salt for a recipe that called for a 1/4 teaspoon. This recipe makes enough that I'll never have to make it again.

I'm on a reduced salt diet so I used just half the salt. I also substituted half the black pepper with cayenne. 
This is very good on chicken and fish.

I like it - much better than buying it all mixed from the store. I may play with a little less salt next time to get it to 5 stars.

I ran across this recipe when making my annual Chex Party Mix and realized I was out of seasoning salt. This recipe  was a home run! I had everything on hand and it added the right amount of flavor to the the mix. No more store bought seasoning salt for us!

I use this all the time. As is written is a great seasoning, but my preferrance is to use smoked paprika and double it, leave out the red pepper and lessen the black pepper a bit.
