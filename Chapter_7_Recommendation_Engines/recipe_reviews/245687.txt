This was great! There's a popcorn store in my local mall. My favorite flavor is white chocolate and salted pretzels. Quite dangerous to have this at my finger tips. I used pretzel sticks if anyone was wondering.

I made this in a Big Tupperware bowl and used a little red food colouring and pink sprinkles for Valentines Day. It was awesome!
