I will be making this one again very soon because it is delicious!  Be sure not to cook the chicken past the 165 degree mark, and you won't be sorry.  Even cold from the fridge this chicken is very tasty!  I am so glad my husband, with his very sensitive heat-taster, loved this because he's going to get it again!  Thanks for such an easy way to fix a dinner!  EDIT:  The third time I made this I'd run out of eggs so used mayonnaise to coat the chicken.  The panko stayed on even better with that.  Just an idea for others!  We love this dinner!

7.4.16  We really enjoyed this for dinner last night with cole slaw, blue cheese dipping sauce, and some carrot and celery sticks.  I didn't have any bottled buffalo wing sauce, so I just used equal parts butter and Frank's Hot Sauce.  Used Egg Beaters® in place of the eggs and just sprinkled a little bit of the mozzarella on the chicken tenders.  Comes together quickly and tastes great (sort of like boneless buffalo wings).  So quick and easy, and soooo good!

I made the first step of cooking the chicken by baking the chicken crisp and then putting chicken back into oven in the pan smothered in sauce and cheese for the second cook to avoid frying.

I tried this and loved it, but I went for the full Buffalo Wings experience and used crumbled bleu cheese rather than mozzarella

Great recipe. Made just as the recipe was written. As other have said 6 eggs were too many. May try using the air fryer next time just to make it a little easier.

Made this for hubby and me.  Added zucchini to round the meal a bit.  DELICIOUS!  Hubby and I both cleaned our plates and will definitely be making this again.

Our panko bread crumbs smelled wrong so we used crushed croutons instead.  Because the croutons are already seasoned, I left out the salt and pepper for the chicken.  They were not missed.

Made this for dinner tonight.  Both my husband and I like the chicken.  Cut the receipe in half, still have left overs. 

Used chicken tenders and cut them in thirds so the sauce would better coat the chicken.  I didn't have panko crumbs but substituted Louisiana seasoned chicken fry batter mix. 

Turned out great.  Will be making this again.  Quick and easy.

The family enjoyed it. Not spectacular, but it was easy and a nice change of pace. The 6 eggs called for were way too many. I cracked four to start and could have easily used only three.  Also, I used Frank's hot sauce and now I'm thinking there is a specific wing sauce which might have taken away a bit of the unpleasant bite.

I found that the Panko became soggy when I put on the lid to melt the cheese.  I think next time I will melt it under the broiler.

Awesome!Made with 2 chicken breasts. One egg plenty. Friend in skillet & when browned, transferred to oven, baking @ 350+ for 30 minutes.  Added cheese at end of baking. Used 1/2 cup buffalo sauce, just right!

I made this....I expected it to be hot, but I believe the mozzerella cheese canceled out the hotness. All in all it was a great dish...Thanks for sharing!

Excellent flavor and definitely has a bite.  I did not have any wing sauce, so I made my own.  I will try using only 4 eggs and 1 cup of bread crumbs next time, as I had extra on both.  I will definitely make again.  The cheese really helps set it off by taking some of the bite out.

Whole family loved it ! I did use chicken breasts so I did the pounding instead of paying ridiculous prices for tenderized chicken.
