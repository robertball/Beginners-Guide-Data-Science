Yum!! I pounnded the chicken to an even thickness (which should be included in the recipe for those that follow recipes exactly). I did not add oregano or parsley, but did add very small amounts of the following to each side of the chicken: rosemary blend, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper flakes (along with the lemon juice, salt & pepper). I let it sit for about 10 minutes while I cooked wild rice and heated the olive oil in the pan for a minute. Then proceeded to cook the chicken. After I turned the chicken to cook the other side I started to steam broccoli. Everything was done at the same time and I had a nice quick hot lunch today. Excellent lemon flavor. Will serve again and try it out on the family.

This is a awesome recipe.  My family just loved it.  I altered the recipe a little bit by adding some garlic to it.  Mmmmm.

This was good, but I didn't find the oregano really added anything to the recipe.  I did add a little chicken broth towards the end of cooking that I reduced to make a sauce.

I pounded and marinated my chicken for over 30  minutes, then "jelly-rolled" it with stovetop stuffing in the center, tied with string and sauted... then made a gravy with the bits in the pan...  soOoOo good.

This was quite nice. I added minced garlic to the oil prior to adding the chicken and, based off another review, also added crushed red pepper flakes to the chicken along with the oregano. I served this with garlic and olive oil couscous. A tasty, simple meal.

This was good and easy. I used about 1/2 a lemon and added garlic powder, lemon pepper and basil. I also cut the chicken into strips and served with egg noodles and roasted vegetables. Yummy!

Simple but elegant, delicious and easy. Versatile too, in that if oregano doesn't appeal to you there are endless other possibilities for seasonings.  I prepared this using fresh oregano and adding fresh minced garlic and I know I'd love this with dill too.

This is a fast, flavorful, & fabulous way to cook chicken for a quick go-to dinner. With the lemon tree in the backyard, I'm always keen on recipes with fresh lemon. We like to use other herbs in place of the oregano to change it up, too. Thyme is an excellent option. Slices of this delicious chicken on top of a fresh salad w/ choice of dressing is always a hit at our table for two. Thanks for sharing the recipe! :)

This one was a bit plain for my taste. But definite plus is the time it takes up to prepare (perfect for a quick lunch fix). Plus, as other user suggested, I think this meat would be good in a salad.

Made a few changes like adding fresh garlic to the oil, crushed red pepper, garlic salt, fresh basil, and parsley. At the end added some chicken broth and covered until finished.

Loved this recipe for its simplicity and flavor.  Not overwhelming, but pure and subtle.  In addition, any leftover chicken makes an AMAZING chicken salad.  I added a little mayonaise and some lemon-pepper seasoning.  Delicious.  I am adding this one to my list of favorites!!!

Loved it!  Easy, simple and light!  I used the pan drippings to make a yummy lemony gravy.  Served with mashed potatoes.  I'll be making this one again - for sure!

This was absolutely wonderful!  My family INHALED it!  I added garlic (quite a bit) but otherwise kept the recipe the same.  The lemon flavor was perfect.  I can imagine that if not made with fresh lemon juice, the flavor would be strong and acrid.  I strongly recommend that you DON'T use the bottled stuff on this one.  I served with rice and asparagus.  Definitely a meal I will repeat.  Thanks!!!

This was very good and VERY easy too!  My husband and I are big fans of Chicken Francese, and this tasted a lot like it (without the breaded coating), and is a lot less fattening I am sure.  I will definitely make this again.

Loved this dish!!  Was very easy to make.  I did add some garlic, like others said,  to the oil before adding the chicken and it made a big difference.  My family really enjoyed this one.  Will definitely be making this one again!!  Thanks!

Absolutely delicious!!!  Instead of using chicken breast halves, I cut my chicken breasts into strips and then cooked them with the lemon juice and spices in my non-stick skillet.  I served the strips over lemon orzo, also from this site, and it was a fabulous meal!

I squeezed a lemon on top, added olive oil and used packet of "Spice Blends-Lemon, Basil, Thyme". Then I cooked it in the conventional oven for 35 min and broiled it for 10 min. I overbroiled it but even so it was delicious!! Maybe 5 min only in the broiler.

Since I usually cannot leave good enough alone, I fudged with the recipie. I did not have lemons, so I added a lime instead, and added some less-sodium soy sauce. After the chicken was done, I shredded the breasts, threw them back in the frying pan with half a cup of veggie stir fry mix and half a cup of cooked wild rice mix. Yum.

This is so easy and delicious!  I made it twice in one week, once for my boyfriend and once for my dad and both really liked it.  The 2nd time I made it, I didn't have oregano so I used Italian Seasoning... tasted pretty much the same.

Excellent and Easy.  I use bottled lemon juice, which is less "lemon-y" I think.  I added twice the oregano and lots of pepper.  Yum.

Very good. I love the tang the lemon gives it. Next time I will use 2 lemons instead of 1. Went very good with broccoli and cheesy mashed potatoes.

This was very tasty!  I marinated it for 30min with a 1/4 lemon juice instead, along with some rosemary, garlic and basil.  Then hubby grilled it.  MMMMM yummy with a nice salad!!

This is DELICIOUS! I changed it a little, chopped up some garlic and sauteed it in the oil before cooking the chicken and everyone loved it!

This was really good. I followed the directions but added minced garlic to the pan while browning the chicken for more flavor. The drippings made a thin sauce to pour over rice. Yum!

Lovely lemon chicken recipe and perfect for a quick evening meal. Couldn't taste the oregano but it didn't matter as the salt/lemon flavor was enough. I served it with a paprika-spiced potato side and green veg. and it worked wonderfully.

Simple and delicious!  I added garlic to the oil as suggested and used thin cut chicken breasts (sauted for 2-3 minutes each side).  They turned out moist and juicy.  This is definitely a keeper!

Wonderful. Would make again for sure, but I used a lot more lemon. I would like to try it with fresh herbs instead of dried as well.

This is so simple and delicious! I cut my chicken breasts into strips for this  but otherwise follow the recipe and love it.  I always make extra for salad the next day because it is great that way too!

Very simple, yummy pan-seared chicken. Moist, great with rice or potatoes and green beans with lemon pepper. Add garlic.

Caution:  The sodium content is wrong if you add any salt at all!!!!  This is for the recipe ingredients only.  Use Nu-Salt substitute instead and this is F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S!

This recipe was good, although the kids did not really like it.  They said it was "too-lemony".  I really would cut back on the lemon, maybe just using the lemons as a marinade, instead of also adding it while the chicken cooks.  The only thing I did different was instead of whole chicken breasts, I used chicken strips.  I think I will use them for the top of a salad, as someone else suggested.

Positively SUPERB! The only alterations I made were to use lemon pepper stead of just salt and pepper and I added capers. I think the capers are a great addition. I will make this every week!

Thank You for sharing this recipe! I was looking for a low fat tasty recipe to cook for dinner with what ingredients I had on hand at the time.  

I improvised by adding garlic and using some rock salt, oh and I also used chicken breast tenders.  

I first browned some chopped garlic in olive oil and then added chicken and then sprinkled with hawaiian rock salt and oregano and added lemon juice after chicken was almost done cooking ! 

Excellent recipe!

This chicken had a bit too much lemon for my likng. If I do it again I will experiment with a variety of herbs or maybe fresh ground peppercorn. My teen daughter loved it though.

A pretty good, pretty basic recipe that I would probably make again to use in sandwiches or chicken salad, but not as a stand alone recipe. Surprisingly, it was not too lemony. Thanks!

I only rate recipes that I've changed significantly if I liked them, as I feel that they were good inspirations.  This is one such case.  As I looked over the recipe and the ingredients, I realized that I would probably find it a little bland as is.
So, instead of just putting lemon on the chicken and then putting it straight into the pan, I made up a flour mixture with the oregano, salt and pepper, and my favorite spice (especially with lemon), paprika.  I had two plates: one empty for chicken by itself, and one with the flour mixture.  After making the flour mixture and cutting the lemon (into 4 pieces instead of 2, as you'll see), I pounded the chicken to about 1/4 inch.  Then I put the chicken on the plate and squeezed 1/4 lemon onto the upside of the chicken.  Then I turned it over and put the lemon side onto the flour.  I squeezed another 1/4 lemon on the other side, and then put it down on the flour.  I floured the whole chicken.
As for the cooking, I realized it wouldn't get hot enough, so I put it up to med. high.  I sauteed side 1 for 5 minutes, then turned heat to medium and sauteed the other side for 2-3 minutes.  It was too hot, and the bottom was burning, but by now my chicken had ballooned up to 3/4 inches again, so I was worried it wouldn't get done inside. I turned it down to med. low and put a lid on it for the remaining 1-2 minutes.
When I took them out, they were PERFECTLY done: juicy and flavorful! I will definitely make this version again!

I tried this recipe last night with my picky eater of a husband...It got rave reviews!!! We both enjoyed this A LOT!! I pounded the chicken (as I do with most chicken recipes - more even cook). I added the orginal Mrs Dash to the oil and oregano as the oil heated up only seasoning the chicken with salt and lemon juice.  I was concerned the lemon juice would be overpowering, but it wasn't. I served it with a salad and box pasta roni.

was not happy with this as a main but a good keeper for a salad or even a pasta with some broccoli  I thought it needed something to follow the lemon flavor a bit more.. quick and easy though which is what I was looking for.

On it's own, I really didn't care for this.  As others had mentioned, the lemon was a tad overpowering.  BUT: when served with a nice wild rice pilaf, it became sublime.  The lemon from the chicken enhanced the rice, while the nutty flavor of rice mellowed out the flavor of the lemon chicken.  Together, they were fantastic.  Will make again and thank you for recipe.

I added rosemary, thyme, and red pepper and served with baked asparagus. I used thigh fillets instead of breast. It was great!

Oh my gosh - this is one of our favorite chicken recipes!  I pound out the chicken breast so that it's thinner and even so it cooks more quickly (we're ALWAYS in a hurry!).  I use bottled lemon juice just because I never remember to grab fresh lemons at the store, and the juice keeps for quite a long time in the fridge.  I just drizzle it over the top and let it set while I do some risotto and steam veggies.  Then I flip it and drizzle it on the other side, and sprinkle it with salt and pepper and oregano on that side before it goes into the pan.  Then that side goes down in the pan, sprinkle the other side the same way, and put the lid on - this helps keep the chicken really moist.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

The chicken was very flavorful, a little too lemony for me though so I just won't use as much lemon next time. I sprinkled garlic powder on both sides of the chicken, the taste suprised me because my family is used to having chicken seasoned the same way every time so it was very different using lemon. Word of advice for you people who don't like alot of lemon, don't use as much as the recipe calls for. But other than that it was very good and I definitely will make it again. Oh, by the way I served it with steamed broccoli and lowfat cottage cheese. Thanks for the recipe!

It was excellent! Though I added Thyme, used RealLemon Juice as well as a splash of lime juice and 'marinated' for about 2 hours.

Great flavor, easy to make. You should generally have all of these ingredients in your pantry, so it's a great meal to make if you've got some chicken to use up.

This was awesome, and pretty easy and quick to make!! As i work 12 hour shifts, i'm often looking for 'quickie' type recipes, and this one is perfect.  The only thing i did, was added some lemon pepper to the mix... lot's of it, as our family loves the mix of spice and sour.... Thanks for the recipe!

this was SOOO good! i just made it as a last minute meal and i loved the fact that i had all the ingredients! i made some changes though.. i fried some onion before adding the chicken, and i gave the marinade a fair amount of time too. this really let the lemon seep in well. i also added Italian seasoning along with the oregano and served it with garlic noodles. no complaints about it being bland as i added a little more of the herbs.this dish didn't even need the noodles.. it was fabulous!

This was delicious. I didn't have fresh lemons so I used bottled lemon juice. I was pleasantly surprised at how flavorful and moist it was--even my picky teenager liked it. And it was so easy and quick!  Great for a nutritious, balanced meal after a long day at work.

This is simply delicious! The chicken was very tender and moist and had a wonderful flavor from the lemon juice. Very very good.  Just sprinkled Italian herbs and a little garlic pepper for the seasoning. I can't wait to make it again!

It was alright, instead of using just oregano I used italian seasoning, which has oregano in it.  It had to sweet of a flavor for my likes, not a bad recipe, just not my cup of tea.

It was a little bland.  I would suggest maybe marinating it in the lemon juice and seasonings for a little while.  That might bring out a little more flavor. ???

this recipe really was simple! i added some garlic to it to give it a kick and used dried basil, which is what i had on hand. i definitely recommend a side dish with more depth of flavor, like a risotto or garlic mash with butter to offset the slight bitter flavor of the chicken. going to try this with fish/shrimp next time!

Another good thing about this recipe is all the ingredients are normally found in our refrigerator

I made this last night and followed some of the other reviewer's advice and made a marinade of lemon juice, lemon pepper, garlic and oregano.  It sat for about 20 mins and I cooked it, occasionally pouring the marinade over it as it cooked.  It was VERY lemony.  I didn't mind it, but the boyfriend wouldn't even eat it.  I did save the left overs to put on a salad I think.

a tasty and healthy dish as the recipe calls for chicken breast and only small amount of oil is required. I marinated the chicken for 30 mins with lemon juice, pepper, salt and dried oregano. Will try to add red pepper flakes to give the dish an extra zest the next time.

Simple is definitely true.  If you want a real strong lemon taste I recommend double the lemon  and add a few sprinkles of lemon-pepper seasoning.  The chicken stayed juicy and very tasty!  Thanks!

Thanks to Carolyn Stilwell for a scrumptious easy recipe. I followed it and added, like other reviewers, a bit of dried rosemary. Magnificent. This lemony sauce is great and a nice change from other chicken recipes I've tried. I would like to thank Theresa Galdamez for her photo of the chicken sliced on a bed of rice and spinach. We are real fans of spinach and rice around here so it was a huge hit. This will definitely be a favorite and added to my rotation.

When I read the recipe, my "recipe snob" self said, "It can't be good, it is too simple!"   But, my practical "Working Mom trying to get dinner on the table" self thought I should try it.  I have a daughter allergic to oregano and most every green herb.  I liked this because I could season each chicken breast individually.  So, I did use 2 whole lemons for 3 chicken breasts-very lemony-and just went to town on adding the herbs for my husband and myself.  My daughter got a nice juicy lemony piece of chicken and we got that WITH extra flavor from the oregano.  Great weeknight meal, I would definitely make it again.

i will definitely make this recipe again. I added garlic to the pan before the chicken like others suggested, and I also made a sauce out of the juices with a splash of chicken broth and a little more lemon juice. I served it over mixed greens with cherry tomatoes and it was delicious!

Will definitely make again! Only things that I added were some extra sea salt. When I prepared the pan with Olive Oil, that's when I added the sea salt, all natural ground black pepper, and oregano! Adding this to the oiled pan helped the ingredients mix together. I did add the lemon to the chicken as said! This recipe came out spectacular and my boyfriend and I will 100% make again!!!!!!

I used thyme instead of oregano, besides that I followed the recipe to a tee. Fabulous! Simple yet delicately delicious!

Might have been the way I was cooking it but I felt it was too bland. Probably would add more salt.

I absolutely LOVED this chicken!  It tastes just like the chicken at my favorite Greek restaurant!  As I didn't have fresh lemons I just splashed some bottled lemon juice on the chicken and in the pan and it turned out fabulous, just fabulous!  I also sprinkled some garlic powder on them along with the salt, pepper and oregano.  Will be making it again this week!  And I can't believe how easy it was to make and so low in calories too!  This is a great recipe for people watching their carb intake.  Thanks for posting.

New to cooking? This is perfect for you. I grabbed the recipe to teach someone an easy and delicious way to cook some healthy chicken breast for food prep. Instead of olive oil, I use coconut oil and also add a bit of garlic powder. I usually use fresh garlic, but powder is easier for beginners. Again, healthy and yummy!!!

It was ok, but the noodles didn't seem to be very good with the olive oil mix poured over it after cooking the chicken.

This recipe is really good and so easy to do! I never cook. My cooking skills don't stretch too far beyond making boxed macaroni and cheese.. But I can make this dish. It was really delicious.

I bought boneless skinless chicken breast cutlets from the grocery store. I took one cutlet and used half a lemon, I added a little garlic powder to it and I also used grape seed oil instead of olive oil. 

It turned out wonderfully and I definitely will try it again.

I highly recommend garlic powder or even fresh garlic would be good.

Great, quick way to make chicken breast. Mine didn't turn out as lemon-y as I had hoped, and I let it sit longer than recommended. I did use lemon juice from concentrate since I didn't have a lemon on-hand, so maybe that was the issue. Will try fresh next time.

this was great! I only used 4 chicken tenderloins, so the first bite was a little overwhelming. I marinated the chicken in about 1 1/2 tbls of lemon juice and salt for a few minutes while the oil heated. Once i put the chicken in the pan, i spinkled it with oregano, lemon pepper and black pepper. yum...

Excellent recipe and so very easy.  Nice to be able to make something so simple and have it taste gourmet.   Also good not to mask the flavor of the chicken with a lot of sauce. Great served with gingered carrots and asparagus.  Thanks for submitting you appreciate good food.

This was delicious. Flavorful, juicy, and tender. The lemon flavor was refreshing. Instead of using regular Oregano I used Italian Seasoning (with Oregano). Turned out great. Definitely will make it again.

I absolutely LOVED this recipe - it is so easy and quick!  It is a refreshing change to plain chicken.  My toddler son did not like it at all and my husband said it was okay but not something he would ask for.  He's a man he likes barbaque sauce! :)  I will be making this again!

Awesome!  I usually use Lemon pepper with my chicken but after using fresh lemon I will never go back. I served the chicken with a mushroom rice and sub. white rice with brown.  Worked out perfectly.  Really, Really good!

I had this chicken for a quickie lunch earlier today and it was out of this world.  the only change - I added extra lemon juice as it began to dry up in the pan.  It was so juicy and just perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really good and moist, but too lemony for us. I'd cut the amount of lemon used in half next time.

This was simple and good.  I marinated the chicken breasts in lemon, oregano, parsely, garlic and a tiny bit of olive oil.  Turned out very nice.

The best part was how simple it really was. It had a nice flavor to it. I would have prefered to marinate it in the lemon juice a little while, but time did not permit. It still turned out good. I did add a little garlic to the chicken like one of the other reviewers had mentioned.

I was drawn to this recipe because I live alone and it is easily adapted to a single serving. I also love lemon! I added garlic along with the oregano, and let the boneless chicken breast marinate in the refrigerator in a zip-lock bag for a couple of hours before cooking. It's then perfect to toss with a mixed salad with a variety of compatible dressings, or even room-temp pasta with some green onions, peppers, olives and feta cheese! My favorite summer meals.

Absolutely delicious! I amped up the flavor by adding garlic powder and a little bit of crushed red pepper flakes.  My hubby and son loved the great flavor. I served it with white rice and broccoli.

Quick and easy and tasty! The lemon I used was extra juicy so it cut down on my temperature more than I liked, not getting the sear I wanted. I needed two batches too so after all was cooked I reintroduced the cooked breasts to get the color I wanted. It over cooked them a bit, but the flavor was there. Will make again but up the heat a little.

Definitely will make it again! It was super easy and quick. I did not follow the recipe for the lemon juice. I used lemon juice from a bottle and added WAY more than 2 TBLS and it still didn't have a kick in it, like I was aiming for.

I have made this many, many times exactly how the recipe is written.  Except, I cut the chicken breasts into smaller strips so you get more of the seasoning in every bite. It is so easy and yummy!  And, so much healthier than frying.  I always double the recipe so I have plenty leftover to add to a salad.

When cooking the chicken, I placed lemon slices in the skillet. It gave the chicken an amazing flavor!! I also placed the chicken atop a bed of lettuce and sprinkled with lemon zest and put the lemon slices on top. This really added to the taste and appearance of the dish! I would recommend this meal to anyone, it's quick easy and tastes delicious.

I wouldn't change anything.  I "designed" the food just like in the picture.  The bed of fresh spinach leaves was pretty and tasted good too, with the brown rice and chicken.  I served with steamed frozen organic green beans with thyme and a little butter.  Very eye appealing dinner.

Followed the recipe exactly and the lemon was WAY to strong.  I used a "large lemon" from the grocery. Maybe using a smaller one that you get in the bags would be better.

Quick and easy.  I also pounded chicken and rubbed in black pepper, red pepper flakes and garlic powder.  Delish.

It was okay, kinda flavorless. Really needs a sauce or some other kind of herb combination to give it more flavor. Only thing I did different was add a bit of garlic powder, but it wasn't enough to save it. The lemon flavor was pretty good, but that's all that I tasted. Inside of the chicken was dry in some bites.

Meh. I made it exactly as the recipe stated and I think it was a bit too lemony (And I love lemon!). And a little dry.

I made this last night for the whole family and everyone loved it including me. I added garlic powder to the oil before putting on the chicken to the skillet and it just added more flavor, also instead of chicken breasts I used chicken tenders. This was one of the best meals I have made, and I highly recommend this for beginners because it is super easy and fast!

I think that even as written this is a nice, and as the name states, simple, recipe for chicken.  After the chicken was ready, I added some water to the pan to grab the chicken bits and herb left in the pan.  This yielded a simple juice that was lovely poured over the couscous I served with the chicken.

I also pounded the chicken breasts down to an even thickness.   I seasoned the chicken with lemon juice, salt, pepper, oregano, dried parsley and a little rosemary.  I sautéed some fresh garlic in my skillet, then added my chicken and some chicken broth and the rest of the lemon juice,  and allowed it all to simmer.  I served it over steamed spinach.  The whole family loved it

This was really my first foray into cooking. The spices mixed with the lemon were a good combination.  I inadvertently added a bit more salt than I meant to but overall the chicken tasted great. This will be a good, quick meal for busy/tired nights.

Delicious! I added a whole lot of other seasonings (ex.p// dried parsley as well as fresh parsley, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, and the rest of the ingredients in the original recipe). My whole family loves it. I will definitely make it again.

Quick, simple, and  yummy!  I will be making this dish regularly.  If cooking for an adult family count on each individual  getting two pieces of chicken.  I paired it with green beans, mash potatoes, and the ever popular Mac & cheese.  Would add salad next time.  Was done start to finish in 30min.

This was exactly the recipe I was looking for when I had a craving for lemon chicken. It was quick and easy and really good. I pricked the chicken to get lemon juice into the meat, and I didn't get enough lemon for the recipe but used the equivalency with organic lemon juice concentrate which was just fine. I paired this with angel hair pasta and Buttery Herb Wine Sauce by Sal from AllRecipes and it was perfect. Keeping both of these recipes for the rest of my life.

We loved this! It was simple, low-calorie, and delicious! I ran out of fresh lemons and had to use lemon juice the second time. It still came out wonderful. I also threw some extra spices by eye. I used thyme, oregano, and basil. I may try baking it next time for an even healthier dish.

I fixed this dish and my teenage son loved it!  He usually will not eat chicken because he says it's too dry; my personal taste would be to add more lemon flavor, but, otherwise, tasted good and was quick.
