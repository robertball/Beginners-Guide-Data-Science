Buttery, crusty and browns nicely. I didn't have time to refrigerate it over night, so I stuck it in the freezer for about 20 minutes then refrigerated it for about another 15 minutes and it worked just fine.

THANK YOU... THANK YOU... THANK YOU!!! I had been making this pastry dough for years, until I lost the recipe. I called it "1 2 3 Puffed Pastry" because I always doubled the recipe for my LARGE extended family, for the holidays. I remembered the amounts "1 2 3" but my mind kept telling me I used cream cheese. When I found this recipe the light went on...LOL I used SOUR CREAM... not cream cheese...DUH! Roll the dough out thin (1/8" to 1/4") cut out 2-1/2" rounds of dough. Place a scant teaspoonful of Solo brand fruit, nut, or poppy seed filling down the center. Fold the sides up and over the filling, overlapping the dough and pinching together to keep the dough from unfolding during baking. Bake on parchment lined cookie sheets, in a 375 degree oven, 12 to 15 mins or until light golden brown. When baked, cool completely on wire rack and dust with powdered sugar. Since there is no sugar in the dough you can even use savory fillings of cheeses, vegetables or meats, for great appetizers. I can't THANK YOU enough, Patti. My family will be delighted, that I can make one of their favorites once again.

Great recipie.  Uses few ingredients so you don't have to check the card every second; quick to make; great texture.  I modified it b/c i never used sour cream before as follows-- use half the required sour cream and add cold water until soft dough forms (3-4tbs).  It was just right for my apple strudel.

I used a cheese grater to "grate" the butter over the flour. It made for quick work in combining the ingredients. I used reduced fat sour cream and 3/4 cup butter. Resulting dough still baked out beautiful and flakey. Thanks for this easy and terrific recipe, Patti!

This is a great recipe. I've tried different recipe for puff pastry but this is the most successful one I ever had.Just follow the directions. Make sure you put some flour on the counter before you roll so it won't stick and also over the dough. It may be hard once it came out from the fridge but please be patient because once you started rolling it, it becomes more softer after. Sprinkle flour often on top so the dough won't stick to the roller. I usually bake it at 350 F and the result is just amazing. My friends love it.

This was a great recipe.  I loved the fact that it called for things I had on hand.  Make sure you roll it very thin to get good results!  If it's too thick it will resemble a dumpling, and you don't want that!

I was very glad to find a recipe for puff pastry that didn't call for shortening.  However, I couldn't bring myself to use that much butter, either.  I halved the butter and it still came out quite flaky and tender--maybe a little stickier than I would have liked when I was rolling it, but I'll take that trade-off for the extra stick of butter!

This recipe is so easy, and great because I don't like to use store-bought puff pastry because of the trans fats. I used this dough to line muffin cups and  baked them filled with lemon custard.  Next I'll try pie filling.

I love this recipe! It's so easy and tastes wonderful whatever I use for. Only complaint - I love sour cream and the smell of it while I work with the dough just about drives me crazy! :)

I made this pastry because I wanted to make apple turnovers. While this dough is delicious, it is NOT puff pastry. It is just like pie crust. I ended up having mini apple pies. I followed all directions, but the dough just does not fluff up and become nice and flaky like the puff pastry you would find in the freezer section. It is dense just like a regular pie crust. I'm still searching for a nice puffy, flaky recipe. But this one is still yummy, just not what I call puff pastry. :)

A very simple, quick and wonderful recipe! I used whole grain flour and only 3/4 of the butter amount, I added one tablespoon of apple vinegar, and I left it in the refrigerator for only about 2 hours. The pastry still came out wonderfully flaky and light! I had wrapped it around salmon fillets and broccoli, served it with a dill sauce, and I got many compliments. You just have to leave those little butter pieces "as are" while you roll out the dough. Rolling out may be tricky at first (maybe it's better to shape the dough into a thick sheet instead of a ball before you put it into the refrigerator), but just keep rolling, and everything will turn out just fine. And never knead the dough, just put the rests of rolled out and cut dough into layers and roll it out again.

This must be the easiest and most delicious puff pastry recipe ever.  My family raved non stop about it.  I used it to make apple turnovers and custard tarts.  Next I will make chicken pot pie.  Definitely my new go to crust recipe.  It is very difficult to screw up.  A tip I have is I put everything in a food processor, then dumped it on saran wrap and wrap it up tightly and refrigerate it.

Have used this recipe several times for pies, cookies, and turnovers.  Perfect every time.  I sometimes replace the sour cream with yogurt and it still works wonderfully.  One of those crusts that gets people remarking "the crust is the best part!".  Have also subbed some cold coconut oil in a pinch when I didn't have enough butter on hand...still perfect.  I think I used this one originally because I REFUSE to use shortening in anything and liked that this recipe called for real butter.  Great recipe that you'll rely on for years to come!

Very rich!  This made a wonderful pastry for our apple turnovers.  I used 100% whole wheat pastry flour for them and they were delicious.

Oh I have to give this one a 5 start rating. This was the most excellent pastry I have ever made and so easy. My husband and I have been fighting over who makes the best pie crust. I think I just won with this recipe. I love the idea that it took NO shortening at all. I did use as one viewer had said and used a cheese grater to cut in the butter, Worked like a charm. I then rolled out, cut into 7.5x6.5 triangles and added cold mashed potatoes, seasoned ground beef and swiss cheese. Closed them using 1 egg to seal edges and glazed the top with egg and baked in over for 17-15 mins at 400 degrees. Makes a great meal for everyone. I can't wait to use this recipe for my next Apple pie

I didn't follow the directions and accidentally mixed all the ingredients in a bowl at once. It didn't matter--it came out perfectly! I baked them as mini tart shells in a mini muffin pan at 400 degrees for 7 minutes and filled them with sauteed mushrooms, scallions, garlic salt, extra virgin olive oil and a splash of red wine sherry. Topped with goat cheese. It was amazing. And the pastry shells taste great on their own!

Was so easy to make, my only complaint is that after the night in the fridge it was like a rock. It needed to come to room temp for me to be able to roll it out for use.

Really good stuff! I don't have much experience with puff pastry, and I expected it to be difficult, but this recipe was easy and not too time consuming. The pastry has a very light and lovely flavor, filling it with anything would be great. I did the pinwheels from this site (spinach, parmesan and muenster- though I would use monterey jack next time instead) which were pretty good. But I had to make some without spinach for some people, so I sprinkled blue cheese and crumbled bacon on a portion of the pastry and that was fantastic! It's pretty easy, just roll out, sprinkle with whatever you want inside, roll up like a jelly roll, slice about 1" thick, lay on a cookie sheet and they bake up beautifully (400 for 15 minutes). Really good!

Easy, easy, easy! And tasty! I divided the dough so that I could use some now and then freeze the rest for later.  I didn't refrigerate the "now" dough and it turned out pretty good; really tender before and after baking.  I rolled, cut with a cookie cutter, baked, and then sprinkled with ample powder sugar when they came out of the oven.  We ate them as cookies :o)  We're thinking of using this as a pot pie crust (sweet and savory pies).

I've never made puff pastry before and I thought it would be good for turnovers. It was really easy to make but next time I think I'll use my kitchen aid like someone else suggested. I also just put it in the freezer for 20 mins and refrigerator for 15 mins and it seemed like it worked. The only problem I had was the first time I rolled it out it stuck to the table like glue. I had put flour down but apparently not enough. I scooped up as much as I could and put a THICK layer flour and used it on top and it worked really good. I'll definitely be making this again.

Wow! I am surprised at how good the end result for this recipe is. I have to say though, I was one of those people who had trouble with sticky dough. I kept thinking to myself, "The end result better be worth all this trouble!" and I'm going to tell you, it sure is! I didn't get time to make this yesterday so I made it this morning and left it in the fridge for a few hours and then stuck it in the freezer for about an hour before I used it. I also chilled a piece of wax paper to roll out the dough between, needless to say - it still got sticky real fast and I used this dough straight out of the freezer. I didn't add any extra flour while rolling it out - so I just may try a sprinkle of flour between wax paper next time. I used this to make Apple Strudel, it was buttery, flaky, delicious. I am definitely making this again - thanks for sharing!

AMAZING!!!  Three ingredients!!  I saw the layers in my crust/tomato tart.  After I chilled the dough for about 5 hours, I rolled it out into a rectangle, folded into 3rds , gave it a clockwise turn, and repeated a few times, always turning clockwise. Thank you!  ****SECOND REVIEW****  I added sugar to the dough to make turnovers/cherry pies and wow!!!  It tastes like the crust on the apple pies at McDonalds. JACKPOT  :)

This recipe was fantastic.  I made a fish pies last night. I put some dough in the bottom of my muffin tin and spread it out with my fingers.  I then filled it with the fish filling, then put another piece of dough on the top.  It baked to perfection.  My sisters raved about the pie, so much so, that I am on pie duty again tonight.

I appear to be the only person who had trouble with this!  My dough looked fantastic, but when I went to bake it, the butter melted and ran off the pan into the bottom of the stove!  It was a disaster since I had people coming over.  I was hoping to use this recipe to make pasties.

This recipe was not only sooo easy, but it was delicious!!!  From this 8 serving recipe I rolled out a top and bottom crust for a 9" chicken pot pie.  I didn't chill it like the recipe suggested but I had to add a lot of flour when rolling it out.  After placing the crust in the pie plate, I added the middle ingredients, the top crust and baked it at 375 for 30 mins.  Definitely not the healthiest meal I've ever made but perfect comfort food!

I took the suggestion from a previous reviewer and did 20min in freezer then 15 in fridge. I used this recipe to make my version of a hot pocket- using the recipe for  barbeque pulled pork and making a puff shell to contain it. OH..MY... WOW!!! It was insanely delicious!! Thanks so much for this recipe! :)

WOW - this puff pastry is delicious and SUPER easy to make!  I just rolled some jam in them and baked at 375 for 10-15min.  Make sure you actually roll out the dough to a max of 1/8th of an inch! Any thicker and the dough doesn't flake up and stays a little too moist.  If you follow the recipe and directions properly - this stuff is PERFECT!  I can't wait to try it with a savory filling next!

Needed a last minute garnish, so I decided to give this a try and it worked out well. It was quick and easy to mix.  I cut the recipe in half, refrigerated overnight and baked the next morning.  I baked at 400 until golden brown. I think this would make an excellent pie crust for quiche.

This recipe was OK, but it would have been nice if it had included cooking time/temp.  My recipe called for a pre-baked shell so I had to guess.

Awesome! Don't roll too thin, but don't leave too thick.  I had read all the warnings about needing to roll thin, but some of my apple turnovers broke open and weren't as nice as the ones that I rolled 1/8-1/4 in thick. Very good.  No need for storebought with the ease of this recipe

I wish I could give this 100 stars. I've always had trouble making pie dough- I'd add too much water, overwork it, you name it. With this recipe though, the ingredients came together perfectly. I grated in the butter as per reviewers suggestions (a wonderful idea). I chilled for about 6-7 hours, floured my surface and rolling pin well, and had no trouble whatsoever with the dough sticking or tearing. I used it to make a chicken pot pie and it was incredibly flaky. This is just... the perfect dough for me. Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU phaylock!

Amazingly easy and delicious. Couldn't ask for a simpler recipe with such great results. Perfect for savory and sweet. Don't even need to add sugar for sweet fillings. I have carpel tunnel in both wrists and easy delicious recipes, that are quick, are hard to come by. This recipe works great, its delicious, and easy on the wrists. Thank you so much for posting

This is insanely good!  My husband wanted some apple turnovers, and typically I run to the store and buy frozen puff pastry dough, but thought I would try to make puff pastries from scratch.  After searching for puff pastry recipes that seemed awfully complicated, I ran across this one and gave it a try...worked like a champ!  Buttery, tender - absolutely perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! This recipe is soo easy, the kitchenaid mixer did it all and I only chilled it in the freezer for 10 min before rolling - it puffed up well and was tender and flaky - better than the store bought!!

I was surprised by this recipe.  I thought it would be more complicated to make puff pastry!  I was a bit disappointed with the fact that it didn't bake up as high as I had anticipated but to be fair, after I made the dough, I left it in the fridge for 4 days instead of the one day it calls for...talk about getting sidetracked!  Anyway, it was still good and I will make again.

Fantastic!!! I used it to make blueberry turnovers and sprinkled the tops with demerara and chopped crystalized ginger (thinking, "Well, if these puff up, it'll be a miracle.") Sure enough, they not only PUFFed beautifully but, they retained the puff when cooled. I'll never buy store bought again!!

Wonderful! It has been two years now that I have saved this PERFECT recipe in my box here at allrecipes. and its the ONLY one I come back to - every time - it hands down beat my own puff pastry recipe that was HOURS of work :)  - I should note too that I always experiment - so i've added different herbs to this depending on my pastrys ulitmate use .... a bit of sugar if its sweet destined and well you get the idea :) Really phaylock, thanks for an excellent recipe!

This came out better than I expected. I have never made a puff pastry before. This was light, flaky and buttery. I used half the amount of butter than the recipe called for and it was still very good. Really easy and quick.

The flavor of this pie crust was absolutely wonderful, but I had a hard time handling the dough.  It was waaay too delicate.  It also didn't puff up.  Overall, a good recipe.

This recipe is SO easy to make and so good to work with - I didn't need any flour at all when rolling it, I jut rolled it on some non-stick paper. After reading that it could go a little too hard when left in the fridge, I decided to put it in the coldest part of the house instead, and that worked just fine. Thank you!

I needed a puff pastry for apple turnovers. This came out very nice and flaky. I wish it would have "puffed" up a little. I may try playing with the recipe to see if I can get it to rise like a traditional puff pastry you buy in the stores. But I loved this and won't be buying that stuff anymore. Thanks for the recipe!

I usually can't be arsed so make pastry properly, so this was a really quick and easy way to make something that normally seems to take loads of bother. I did what the recipe said except I used Greek yoghurt because I didn't have sour cream. I had to add a couple tbsp of water as well to get the right consistency probs because the yogurt was so thick. I tossed it in the freezer for 15 then rolled it out and so far it seems to have turned out fab. No fuss no mess, brill.

SCRUMPTIOUS, DELICIOUSNESS, TERRIFIC.  So incredibly easy and this is a keeper for puff pastry dishes.  I too grated the butter (as suggested by someone else on the site) very helpful BTW, and put it in the freezer for approx. 40 min.; then into the fridge for 30 minutes.  Rolled it out and put peaches in the center for a strudel, covered it, brushed cream on top and turbinado sugar for an added crunch on top and honestly it tasted like it came from a Parisian Pastry shop.  I was so proud of myself and will use it continuously throughout my baking recipes when requiring Puff Pastry.

I have been using this all week. I have made it traditional and gluten-free. Really great and easy recipe. I have made chocolate croissants and palmiers - both have turned out really good.

This recipe is extremely amazing, you just preheat oven to 350 and pop it in for twenty minutes! It tastes really good with any fruit jam spreaded lightly on the top

These came out very nice. I never have luck when it comes to trying to make bread, biscuits from scratch, but this was easy enough for me!! My husband has already requested I use this recipe again.
