Fantastic! I had never made pecan praline before and it was a little finicky. The first time, I took it off the heat too early and the sugar just crystallized. The time mentioned in the recipe to caramellize the sugar was not long enough for me. My advice is to turn the heat high and stand by so you can watch the sugar go from foamy white bubbling to clear golden brown. The crust of the cheesecake got rave reviews at a Thanksgiving dinner this past weekend and was even compared favourably to a professionally made pumpkin cheesecake someone in the group had had earlier the same day. Very yummy and I will make this again for sure!

Like a really rich pumpkin pie.  I liked this recipe because it calls for a lot of pumpkin.  YUM!  Everyone liked it and it was easy to make.  My family particularly loved the pralines.  I got the idea too late to try it this time, but I bet this would be really good with a ginger snap crust, too!

I topped mine with a layer of whipped cream, then a layer of Marzetti's carmel dip and outlined it with pecan halves and sprinkled the pralines on top of it.

Absolutely awesome. This is perfect with out the pralines, but the pralines do add to it. It is also simple to make. I took one to work with me and it was gone in less than 15 minutes. I hope you enjoy.
