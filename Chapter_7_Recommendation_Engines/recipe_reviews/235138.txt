My husband loved this dish. Made it with Johnsonville hot Italian sausage and used 1/2 the recommended red pepper seeds. It was plenty spicy. We served it over TX shaped pasta which gave it a regional flavor.

I made it per the recipe except I left out the red pepper flakes because I thought the hot sausage was enough 'heat'. My wife and I enjoyed it very much. I will definitely make it again may use an Italian seasoned crushed tomatoes next time. Thanks Evelyn.

Yummy! I served this over some rice. I used sliced mushroom and celery instead of bell pepper and I used chopped jalapeno instead of red pepper flakes. It was still spicy enough.  I will make this again.

Evelyn's Spicy Italian Sausage & Zucchini Haiku: "It's a head-scratcher. Not quite sure how to eat this cuz it's so saucy." I made this as written and b/c it was so liquid-ey I regretted not having pasta made to serve this on top of. Description refers to it as "slow-cooked" but the directions don't indicate it as such. Oh I guess I made one change - I saw no reason to dirty a separate skillet and cooked the veggies in the same pan that I'd browned the sausages in.
