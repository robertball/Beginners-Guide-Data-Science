This is the true Potato Pancake (not Latke).  We usually serve them on a Friday night (especially during Lent) with potato soup, bread and butter, the pancake topped with the traditional granulated sugar with applesauce on the side.  We are a German/Polish family.  Leftovers were taken in sandwiches with butter, salt and pepper for lunch.  Don't fret about the discoloration...it is a part of the pancake and never noticed after fried up.  When 5 pounds of potatoes are grated by hand for a large family, the discoloration is not a problem.Don't spend a lot of time and trouble drying out the potatoes, just drain in a colander and the flour takes care of the rest.  If a little drains from the pancake in the fry pan, it will just add a nice crispiness to the edge.  ENJOY.  Our family has for over 100 years.

These are a delicious sidedish for dinner or breakfast. For those who are complaining about their potatoes being a greenish-gray color, there is a simple solution. The easiest thing to do is as you scrape them imediately put them in cold water so they aren't exposed to the air. They'll stay a beautiful white. Just be sure to drain them really good before frying.

A plus side to soaking them first is that they are much crisper when you fry them up. Not only do they look better but they taste better too!

These were great!!!  I solved the oxidation problem by shredding the potatoes one at a time in my food processor and emptying it into a bowl of cold water after each potato.  I had read that when making homemade french fries to put them in cold, even ice water and then dry them before frying.  I then took a handful at a time and squeezed them in the collander and added them to the egg mixture.  This worked great.  There was no change in color, or if there was it was limited.  Once dinner was over I quickly put the leftovers in plastic baggies and put them in the freezer, hopefully this will keep them from oxidizing.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!!!

This is an awesome recipe!  My Father-in-Law is from Austria, so my husband grew up eating potato pancakes every Christmas morning.  This recipe is easy and sooooo good, impresses my husband every time!  I do have a little trick that cuts down on the moisture from the potatoes - if you peel and boil the whole potatoes the night before (boil for only a few minutes).  Then, cover and refrigerate the potatoes until morning.  This will make shredding so much easier on the arms if you are doing it manually and it also cuts down on the moisture!

I used my blender to grate the potatoes in 1/2 c. of milk. This will keep the potatoes from turning dark or black. Then add extra flour to thicken. Mine turned out just fine.

A true Irish lass, I love potatoes.  I am always looking for new ways to cook them.  I've only had potato pancakes once before from a deli; they definitely didn't compare to this recipe.  

I made them as-written, and ate them with sour cream and homemade applesauce.  Two descriptions  came to mind: delightful, and finger-lickin' good!

I will definitely make these again, and soon.  This recipe is great for breakfast.  For a dinner side, I'd try adding a little garlic powder and parsley.  

Awesome, Wendy!  Thanks for sharing!

Made as is.  No problem with oxidation because we soaked them in water and then pressed the water out.  Delicious, thanks!

My mother had made potato pancakes like these when I was little.  I made them for my fiance and he said they were the best he had ever tasted; better than any restaurant and even better than his grandmothers!  Wow, what a compliment.  The only alteration I made was I doubled the flour and the salt.  Excellent recipe!

I squeezed out extra water from shredded potatoes by using a cheesecloth. Also doubled flour and salt plus added 1/4 C finely chopped fresh parsley. Be sure not to let the potato mixture sit too long or more water will be drawn out from the potatoes.

These were really tasty. I served them with rouladen and just topped them with a touch of seasoned salt. I used my cheese grater to shred the potatoes. Very easy.

Yum - my first time making potato pancakes - they were great!  Definately will make them again.  My husband said they were even better than his mothers!  I shredded the potatoes and put them in a bowl of water - when they were all shredded, I drained the water and put them in my salad spinner!

Being from German and Polish decent, I have made TRUE German and Polish Potatoe Pancakes. I found that using 1-1/2 Tablespoons of Flour and GRATING the potatoes and onions instead of SHREADING the potatoes makes a more flavorable pancake.  You can also put the potatoes, eggs, onions etc., into a blender and select the grate speed and the batter comes out very nice. The  less flour,the better the pancake. The TRUE way to eat potatoe pancakes is accompanied with sour cream and/or applesauce or plain along with a meat such as roast beef or pork. One important thing to remember,, is that German or Polish potatoe pancakes are DEFINITELY NOT Latkes.  Latkes require more flour and are more dense.

As others suggested I added more seasoning to this recipe... salt, pepper and garlic powder (about 1/2 tsp. each).  Make sure your oil is hot before you put any in the pan or they will soak it right up.  Everyone here enjoyed them!

Great recipe!  My wife and I am tired of eating the same thing over and over so we decide to give this a shot.  We are from northeastern PA originally and have always enjoy potato pancakes at church bazaars and picnics.  We are thrilled to say this recipe COMPLETELY met our expectations!  Thank you so much and we will start working this meal into our cycle of dinners!  They turned out great and really appreciate that someone took the time to post this!  Thank you!  Brian and Melissa from SC....originally from the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania

Thanks for your tips on the ice bath after shredding, this made a big difference. These are delish and went great with our fried bluegils and crappies.

I grew up in a German household and these were a regular. We have always used unpeeled potatoes (more vitamins) and a blender (no shreeding necessary), just cube the potatoes. My husband still requests them after 45 years. Always use raw potatoes, spread thin and fry till crisp.

wow.  simple & easy.  I used them for dinner and added garlic & parsley.  I don't understand why everyone is trying to grate the potatoes & worrying about whether they'll turn brown or not.  I don't put myself through all that.  I just use the frozen shredded hash brown potatoes.  They're raw, don't turn colors and already shredded.  Saves a TON of time.

I made these a few weeks ago and I actually did not make too many as I did not know how well they would go over but...they were a hit! My son actually ate 3 before I ever even got them to the table. Next time I make them....I will definitely double the batch.

Super easy and delicious! I didn't bother with draining the potatoes or anything, except to press them with a paper towel right after shredding.  Served with some sour cream. Would be delicious with some fresh parsley mixed in!

This recipe was great. Just make sure you drain the potatoes so the mixture is not too watery. I added 2 tbsp white sugar and some garlic for extra flavor. This was so simple and easy - perfect for a cold day.

This was a wonderful and easy potato recipe!  I served it with a boneless sirloin and a veggie, and it was a great change from mashed potatoes!  One thing I think is you could use only one egg, b/c after making them they are a little "wet".  These reheat in a toaster oven VERY well!  And I didn't think they needed any sauce or sour cream, they're good just like they are.  And you could easily personalize them by adding your favorite seasonings!

Excellent!  These are perfect side dish potato pancakes.  The little shards of potato along the sides, getting all crisped up... MMM!  I make these with pork roast and applesauce, and my husband thinks I am a goddess.  What more can you ask for from a recipe, really? :)

I made these last night and they were delicious.  Everytime I have tried to make potato pancakes they turn out like hash browns.  My mother in law, who is deceased now, was German and made the best.  I changed a few things...I used only 4 potatoes, 1/3 cup of onion and more flour.  I took the advice and shredded my potatoes and put them in ice water until I was ready to fry them. I made 4 pancakes and fried them in oleo about 10-15 minutes on each side so that the potatoes were done.  Finally had a great recipe and my husband loved them.  I also made homemade applesauce and baked pork chops to go along with them. Tks for the recipe!

This is exactly the recipe that I've used, with the exception of the baking powder.  

What does baking powder do to a recipe?

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  After shredding the potatoes I soaked and rinsed them in very cold water until water ran clear. This gets rid of the starch and makes a crispy on the outside pancake.  I then just squeezed dry in a towel and followed the recipe.  Turned out beautifully.  Served with real maple syrup and it was a treat.  Yum...

This is delicious and worth the effort (especially when you have a husband to peel and grate). I served it with pork chops and applesauce.

I prepared this in small batches to keep the potatos from turning brown before cooking.  Wonderful taste but time consumming if you are like me and don't own a food processor.

It took a few tries with this recipe to make it come out the way I wanted it to. I only eyeballed my ingredients, and so I needed to sprinkle some "nature's seasoning" on the pancakes while they fried. I also had to add a LOT more flour so that they would be crispy. Other than that, this recipe is excellent for a base; taste test as you cook works best with this one.  Side-note; although my potatoes did discolor, as soon as they hit the hot oil they changed back to white.

These were just wonderful. It may not be in keeping with the recipe, but I sprinkled each with some garlic salt while they were cooking - delicious! This recipe is a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

This Latke deserves its rating as the #1 Potato Pancake, and we tried many. You can also make it gluten free by substituting potato starch for the flour.

Oh so delicious. I Ate over half of them as I was making them and had to make a second batch for dinner! Sprinkle with a little kosher salt for an elegant flavor and serving with apple sauce is a must!!

The overall combo of flavor is good but no matter how I try to make these they always end up very soggy and very oily.  I have redused the amont of oil to almost nothing but the potatos still suck up the oil and hold on to it for dear life - I have also tried butter which worked out pretty well but you have to keep it on a lower heat so not to burn the butter in the pan.

These are more like hash browns, not German potato pancakes. Potato pancakes are not shredded but grated, placed in a towel and the liquid squeezed out. To make the task less time consuming, I slice my potatoes into chunks and just run them thru the food processor. My kids love hash browns and for a breakfast treat, these were very good. Thank you Swizzlesticks!

Please help me.  This recipe looks great.  I would appreciate someone giving the amount of shredded potato in cups or pounds.  I always seem to guess wrong on the "medium potato."
Thanks

I hate to sound like a broken record, but these are truly the best potato pancakes I have ever had. I made them from leftover mashed potatoes, just about six cups to 1.5 times the recipe. I didn't have any trouble with moisture. I do recommend a skillet, to keep up with demand! They go quick!!!

As a child, we had used a hand grinder to prepare the puree to be fried.  Onions  the color change.  The blender reduced preperation time from an hour to minutes.  The traditional topping is sugar, and/or cold apple sauce.  We still prepare it this way.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I always have.

These are to die for and so easy to make. They were so tasty and delicious!! I used a food processor to shred the potatoes and cooked them right away, so I had no problems with oxidation. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

This was a good recipe. My 17-month old baby loved it. My 4-year-old was a typical 4-year-old and picked at it, so who knows? I only gave it four stars because it seemed more like hashbrowns than pancakes. Maybe my potatoes (what I consider medium red potatoes)were too big? Next time I'll make more egg/flour mixture to go with it. That said, it was good. I spruced it up because we were having it as a side dish for dinner and added a little fresh oregano, thyme and garlic (just a little though). It was good, and I will make it again and see if it was just my potatoes or if it was the recipe.

a very good side dish... a different change of pace... my mom and grandma actually make these by throwing all the ingredients in a blender, blending and then adding diced potatoes and liquefying them... then pouring the batter into a skillet making small pancakes.. some people may not like doing it like that because they tend to be mushier.. but they do taste excellent.. and very unique... but making them as this recipe states turned out good too

I grew up in northern Germany and potato pancakes were one of my favorite foods. These turned out great! I followed others advice and doubled the flour and salt. Absolutely delicious!

Skipped the onion and used onion powder as I was short on time- Not something I'd do next time, but they were still really good, just like I remember my mom and grandmother making when I was younger. Will be a regular for weekend breakfasts!

Bacon fat is what my German Granny used to make these really stand out in my memories (1 or 2 tablespoons w/ oil). I only added a tablespoon more flour then this recipe called for & made sure the potatoes where pretty dry before frying. Great comfort food!

Made if just as the recipe called for.  I noticed that using fresh yukon gold potatoes, the mix was a little wet.  I put the potatoes in a colander over another bowl pot so they could drain.  They came out perfect.  I was making all german for the family this evening and these were as authentic as any I ever had in Germany when I lived there for 9 years.

My sister shared my Mom's version: 
6 potatoes grated, 1/2 an onion grated or diced, 1 beaten egg, salt and pepper and a heaping Tablespoon of flour.  Mix well. Drop by rounded spoonfuls into BACON GREASE .... smash down with a fork.  Fry until golden brown on each side.  We dip ours in Apple cider vinegar or top with sour cream.  SOOOOO good!  The bacon grease gives it a distinct and yummy flavor.

I used 1 extra large russet potato (the kind from Costco) for half the recipe.  I also used 1/2 red onion.  This was very delicious with ketchup and tabasco on the side!

I've always heard about German pancakes but this is the first time I tried them.  I didn't think the potatoes would get done in that short amount of time but they do.  After draining them in the colondar, I squeezed as much water out as I could and even wrapped them in a strong paper towel to get even more water out.  The potatoes turned a pinkish color from oxidation but when you fry them that goes away. These are tasty!

These pancakes are the same as the German potatoe pancakes my mom learned from her mom, who was from Germany.  Great recipe, but the picture could be better.

Pretty good, and surprisingly easy to make.  (Remember to squeeze the
water out of the shredded potatoes.) Served them with apple sauce and sour
cream.  My only two complaints:  One, while cooked, they didn't end up
as hot off the skillet as I wanted.  Next time I'll either cook them
longer at a lower temperature to make sure they end up hot everywhere, or
drop them in the oven at 250 after they come off the grill to make sure
they're warm.  Two, they didn't end up as greasy as I prefer (and as most
potato pancakes are).  (This may be a good feature for health reasons!)
This is probably because I used a non-stick skillet and therefore used
relatively little oil.

This has now become a Christmas morning tradition.  My fincee loved these.  I added ham and cheddar cheese to these and they turned out excellent.  This recipe is one that definately lives up to its claims.

Regular pancakes will keep in the fridge, if you make too much.  These, on the other hand, oxidize at the speed of light.  By the time I was done shredding the potatoes, half of them had already turned a nasty-looking brown color.  I had too much left over and tried to save the rest of the mix to make breakfast the next morning, but it turned a horrible dark grayish-purple color overnight.  The recipe itself is ok and tastes fine, but I would strongly recommend making only as much as you can use, or you will waste your ingredients.

I used a food processor to "shred" my potatos. I didnt even think to drain them after shredded. Big watery mess.. BUT! My second batch was great! The kids went wild for these.

Want an EZ way to dry out grated potatoes after rinsing them?  Simply rinse them in the basket of your salad spinner, then spin them dry!  Hashbrowns, potato cakes, and potato pancakes have never been so easy!  Enjoy!

I changed a little bit.  I used red potatoes (that's what I had on hand).  I added garlic powder and used extra onion, extra salt & pepper, and about a tablespoon of extra flour.  That having been said, AWESOME!!!!   Soooo yummy.  :)  My hubby loved them even more than me.  

I did use paper towels to absorb some of the water from the potatoes before adding to the recipe.  I let the batter sit for awhile before I cooked it, which meant there was more water that drained out of the potatoes.  I just poured it out, but when I make them again, I'll just plan to make the batter right before I am ready to fry them.

Also, I cooked them WAY more than 3 minutes a side, but I like things VERY crispy.

OMG, these are just like my Polish mother made when I was a little girl.  The story is that my great uncle Louis ate 18 of them at one sitting.  I believe it.  These are delicious.  Made them per the recipe, but didn't really measure anything.  Used peanut oil to fry them - marvelous!!  Ate them with cottage cheese or sour cream.  These are like a cross between hashbrown potatoes and latkas.  So much flavor when beautifully browned.  I questioned your timing - but used a timer and found 3 minutes on each side was really good, but turned the heat up a little bit.

Excellent...used grated onion though.  For a delicious sauce to serve on the side, mix equal parts of plain Greek yogurt and apple butter or cinnamon apple sauce......YUMMY!

These were easy to make and very tasty. I used metal rings to make mine perfectly round, and they looked really nice. I omitted the onion just because I was lazy, and I fried them in olive oil. YUM!

My family loved it! My daughter said that's not hashbrowns lol. Made as is but halved the serving size. I made sure to make the egg mixture first, then shredded the potatoes and squeezed out the excess liquid.

I whipped up this recipe for my family when the were visiting for the holidays and brought with them a bag of potatoes (don't ask). I followed the recipe and previous comments about soaking the shredded potatoes in ice and cold water and the pancakes had anice yellow golden color. I fried the pancakes in olive oil which required a longer frying time (~8 minutes).

Well, I followed the recipe exactly and I thought they were kind of blah, but my bf thought they were great.  Instead of sour cream on top (like some suggested), I used ranch dressing.  This was just what they needed.

Best potato pancake recipe I've found yet! I followed the recipe almost exactly with only 2 changes: doubled flour to 4 TBSP and doubled salt. The mixture was very watery so I did keep squeezing out the excess moisture. The result was well-seasoned, crispy potato pancakes worthy of a German restaurant. Thank you!

These were amazing and reminded me of my grandmas. Don't worry about the color change from the oxidation it doesn't affect the flavor. I do highly recommend removing as much moisture as possible though.

My husband says these are the BEST potato pancakes he's ever eaten, and we live in Milwaukee where almost every restaurant and pub serves fish fries with potato pancakes every Friday.  I used yellow flesh Yukon Gold potatoes, which don't darken.  Excellent!

I've always wanted to make these and this recipe was wonderful. Just like my favorite restaurant serves. The batter was very wet and I continually drained excess water during the process but that didn't affect the quality. Delicious.

This is a great recipe to start with. I actually just make them with thawed out shredded hashbrowns, and they are delicious! No need to worry about the potatoes discoloring, either. I've gotten to the point that I make these without measuring, but the original recipe is great. You can actually just leave out the baking powder if you don't happen to have some - works great to just use a little more flour with the hashbrowns. 

Yum!!

I love them!  I used green onions instead of regular onions but it tasted the same to me.  I also did not use all of the salt but still great.  I have made them a couple of times already and plan on making them again.  My three year old and I put applesauce over them and that was great.

We liked it. Soaked the shredded potato in cold salt water & avoided the oxidation issue. After draining well, we even blotted with a clean dish towel. Only chnage we will make next time is omit the onion & use a bit smaller pan so the oil can come up on the sides of the pancake more. Perhaps add a pinch of cayenne. Will need to add more oil after a batch or two.

Never had a potato pancake before but I was a huge fan!  If it weren't for the amount of oil needed, I would make these every time I needed a potato side dish!

These were fabulous and easy!  This was my first time making potato pancakes, as I always thought they'd be more time-consuming.  Well, they were time-consuming, but they were easy and delicious!  Thank you for the recipe.

Excellent recipe.  Recently my mom passed away and she used to make the best potato pancakes... I looked up this recipe and it's almost exactly like hers.  The only difference was that I remember her using a meat grinder to grind up the potatoes to make them smoother (not so much like hashbrowns).  It was great to taste these again and take me back to my childhood.

Thanks for the recipe, these were fantastic.  They are exactly how I remember them to be, light and crispy around the edges, very tasty, I would add more salt to the batter next time, however everyone thought they were perfect and said they were the best they have ever tasted.  I am making them again today for company.  I will hang on to this recipe - it's a keeper.

I shredded the potatoes in a food processor to speed things up.  These cook very evenly; I didn't have problems with the outsides burning while the inside remained mushy, as I have with other potato pancake recipes.  Needed extra salt.  I served with dollops of sour cream.

I suggest using only 1 TBSP of oil (swirl it around pan when hot)and do in batches of (5) at a time, instead of all the oil at once. I used an ice- cream scoop to make the patties:worked great! A more uniform size cooked evenly and was less mess, when turning. In the end, I used less oil,  but they were still very crisp on the outside. Served as a side dish, w/ choice of just ketchup or sour cream w/ fresh chives. Will make again this way, but will try Yukon Gold potatoes for more flavor.

This is very good but one step which I feel was left out is after the potatoes are grated squeeqe them by the handfuls to get rid of excess moisture.  These are just like the ones my german friend makes and everyone loves them.  This is comfort food.

Don't worry about the potatoes turning red/black/brown when preparing.  It is not harmful, the color goes away with cooking, and it does not affect the flavor.

Good recipe, I would make again.  Instead of shredding potatoes, I used six cups of pre-shredded hash browns (1 1/2 packages).  I added 1 teaspoon of salt and upped the pepper too.  1/4 cup of oil is too much, even in a big pan so I would decrease to 1/8.  I tried to form the pancakes instead of loose tablespooning them into the pan and they stayed together and looked better.

These are very good.  When I made them, I lined a strainer with a flour sack dish towel and put the shredded potatoes in there to squeeze out some of the excess water that the potatoes give off.  I also needed to add a little more flour, but they turned out excellent.  My 8 year old daughter ate 5 of them topped with sour cream.  My 6 year old son liked them topped with apple sauce.  I enjoyed them both ways!

This was by far the best potato pancake/latke/hashbrown recipe I've tried. Why? Because they really get CRISPY!!!! I made mine gluten-free by subbing potato starch for the flour. Everything else was the same. So easy!

I did it the old school way. Probably put more baking powder, flour and added shredded cheddar cheese. Killer. Fluffy and tasty. A polak from Buffalo.

My husband and I both thought this was very tasty. Since I was only making enough for two I shredded up two large potatoes, and came out with about 9 pancakes. I just cut the amount of ingredients back. I also added just a tiny bit of pure horseradish. I mixed sour cream and sriracha as a dipping sauce. Will for sure be making again, thanks for the great recipe!

These were great! They didn't discolor at all - not sure if people are waiting too long to use the potatoes or if using a food processor makes it more likely. I just used a grater. It didn't take much time. I prepped everything else first, then grated the potatoes and put them in a thin, clean dish towel to squeeze the extra liquid out (see video). The only change I would make is to divide the oil so each batch gets to cook in oil. Otherwise, brilliant recipe! I did sprinkle a tiny bit of salt on each pancake once I put them on the paper towels. One more thing... I didn't have any eggs and didn't realize that until I'd committed to the recipe. I used 2 Tablespoons water, 1 teaspoon veg oil and 2 teaspoons baking powder in place of the 1 egg (I halved the recipe). It worked well - not that I would recommend doing this, but if you too didn't realize you have no egges, it does work. I omitted the 1/4 teaspoon baking powder from the recipe since I'd already used 2 teaspoons of it.

Really good.  I recently got potato pancakes at a German restaurant and was really disappointed with how doughy and floury they were and they were lacking real potato crispness.  I went looking for a recipe to rekindle my love for potato pancakes and this was it.  Crisp potato with onion flavor.  I grated the potato and the onion together, squeezed out the excess moisture in the potato onion mixture before adding it into the other ingredients.  When I scooped it, I left behind all the extra moisture as well.  Tasted great  - would definitely make again!

I did not care for this recipe. I am German and Irish, so I LOVE potatoes and potato pancakes. We missed Oktoberfest this year, so I didn't get my annual fix. I decided to make these. The mix looked perfect! I used fresh homegrown potatoes and fresh homegrown onions for the recipe. I measured everything perfectly, and these turned out TERRIBLE. Aside from cooking up correctly, the middle of the pancakes seemed to taste odd and tasted pretty bad! Sorry Guy! Not the recipe to use!

I also soaked the potatoes first in ice water with lemon. They fried up nice and crisp.

Great as is.  Rinsed in water and strained to avoid oxidation, no problems at all.  Best to use a countertop griddle and cook them on it.

Excellent! I used Trader Joe's Shredded Hash Browns 20 oz bag. It only contains shredded potatoes. (or Simply Potatoes). It was 3 firmly packed cups of shredded potatoes. I added 2 1/2 Tbsp of flour,  1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp garlic powder. Really, not much diff than the recipe. I did not ring out the potatoes, but in retrospect, I could have dried them just a bit. It makes NO difference if the potatoes turn brown, you are going to cook them!(another cook said this). I fried them in a small amount of oil and butter bc the oil keeps the butter from burning and the butter keeps the oil from smoking. The first ones I fried I fried on too high a heat and the insides were not cooked enough. They might be better baked. Either way...great!

Old-fashioned potato pancakes, just the way you remember them!  Grate potatoes into egg mixture to prevent darkening.  Minced green onions might be a colourful change especially for St. Paddy's Day next March.

delicious. best potato pancake i have tasted. Better than ones at any church bizzare and restaurants. Kids and adults loved them. I squeezed out excess moisture from the potatoes with a towel.  They make a great side for dinner, i would not personally make them for breakfast.

Excellent! I make this all the time. I like to add different ingredients for more flavor I add finely chopped mushrooms or bacon and shredded cheese + garlic is the trick. Serve with side of ketchup,super tasty.  Trick is to fry it slowly over medium setting using a bit of oil here and there... Enjoy!

WOW!!! thank you for a great recipe! I have never made this before and they taste just like my 1st gen. German/American mom use to make:-) I did make sure all water was squeeze out, and chopped onions very fine.
I used canola oil in non stick frying pan, just enough to coat the bottom, well ah prob. a little more and got the pan really hot and dropped small balls in the hot pan and gently patted it down w a fork. I like them pretty thin, so all on how you like them! Enjoy:-)

My husband wouldn't let me rate these 5 stars b/c he's Jewish and prefers latkes, but I think they're just like the potato pancakes my mom made when I was a kid. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and soaked my potatoes in cold water after shredding them, this definitely stopped the oxidation process and made them look much more appealing!

I've never had these before, so I couldn't wait to try them. They were so good. My nine year old daughter and I couldn't stop eating them. They seemed like hash browns to me, so the idea of eating applesauce with them was weird. We thought we'd try it and LOVED it. The recipe makes way too much for us, so after eating several of them, I put the remaining potato mixture in a bowl in the fridge. I am going to make them tomorrow morning with fried eggs. Hopefully, they will still be good. Oh...we took someone's advice and put the potatoes in ice water right after shredding them. Then we drained them and squeezed them dry before mixing them with the egg mixture. They had started to turn gray, but instantly went back to white and stayed white after the "ice bath". Thank you for a great recipe. We will make it often.

Loved these!  Yummy!  The only thing i did slightly different was squeeze the liquid out of my shredded potato in a colander before adding it to the mix.  I made these small and ate them with ketchup (sorry if you find this heinous) although they were great plain too!

This recipe is delicious. Instead of using them as pancakes, I top them with pizza toppings. It makes for a heartier crust, my husband commented that it could be considered "man food". Lol, whatever that means...

Been making potato pancakes for years. Never used a recipe, but thanks for this as people are always asking for the recipe. I do add a pinch of nutmeg, as my husband's German father always did.

They tasted delicious and crisped up nicely in the pan. However, they were basically hash browns! Didn't hold their pancake shape at all. As soon as I moved them to turn, they fell apart and basically became a pan of hash browns. Happened with every batch I fried. But again, 4 stars for the taste and texture because they were yummy and I didn't have any leftovers so it's still a winner!

This is a great, easy recipe for potato pancakes.  My family loves them!  I am not sure if the original recipes says this, but once the potatoes are shredded, completely cover them with cold water so that they will not turn brown.  Also, drain VERY well before you put the potato shreds into the recipe.

Absolutely great!  I did make a few changes to make them taste like some from a restaurant I went to as a kid...  I added a couple shakes of garlic powder, 2 diced green onions, a little bit of fresh parsley, and the key... some sauteed diced smoked sausage (whatever your favorite is, I used garlic flavored).  I also ended up adding another egg, probably because my potatoes were a little large.
I also used the trick of grating the potatoes into cold water and then draining them out - but I don't think it's necessary.  Some still turned a little brown and the end flavor/look was the same.
Altogether delicious recipe, thanks!

we must have done something wrong.  The potatoes didnt sit out for more than a couple mins before we mixed it in. i cant explain the taste but it was not good. but bc of all these good reviews, maybe something went wrong at our house.

It's not quite what I expect in a potato pancake, but it was really delicious! 5 stars for great flavour. I added a bit more salt and pepper too for my taste. Don't worry about the potatoes discoloring (oxidizing) - Ignore that, because it doesn't matter and won't affect the flavour. That's what shredded potatoes do, and once you cook them, you wouldn't notice the discolouration anyways - more important is draining excess water from the potatoes before mixing in the batter. Thank you very much for the recipe though!

I thought this recipe was so bland! It had no flavor, I dont know how it has this many stars. It needs a lot more salt and pepper. I put some garlic powder in as well.

Super recipe! I had to make 2 batches for my family. They gobbled them up including my 3 year old picky eater. The only thing I did different was I made sure the moisture was squeezed completely out of the potatoes. I also added an extra TB of flour to each batch. Fried up perfect! Yum! Thanks!

For a potato dish, I think this just doesn't rank very high in my opinion. I'm reluctant to say so since I really wanted to like it but it was just too bland for me and ended up having the same flavor as a baked potato.  In this case I might as well just make baked potatoes which are far easier to prepare anyway.  My husband thought they were decent but agreed they could've used a lot more seasoning.  If you are determined to make these just be sure to eat it with a condiment such as apple sauce, sour cream, or even ketup.

I have tried several recipes for potato pancakes over the years and have always been disappointed - until now!  These were great.  I boiled the potatoes until tender before shredding.  I thought they needed a little more salt, so I added extra salt in the form of garlic salt and also added some onion powder (because onion powder makes most everything better!).  I cooked them in my iron skillet, which browned them nicely.

I had never attempted potato pancakes before because I was afraid they'd taste like hash browns, but these have turned my opinion completely around!  REALLY great, really easy (if you use a processor for shredding).  I just spooned them into hot oil, flattened a bit with a spatula.. cook, flip, cook, done!  Served with fresh grilled brats, wilted cabbage slaw (from this site), beer, pickled eggs... oh, and we sprinkled them with a tiny bit of granulated sugar, topped with applesauce and sour cream.  WONDERFUL.  Raves from everyone!!!

This recipe reminds me of the potato pancakes that my dad used to make.  I served mine with sour cream and they were perfect with the German Red Cabbage recipe and Bierrocks I.  Oh my goodness, use this recipe!

The potato fries up nicely and the onion adds a wonderful sweetness to the mixture.  Yummy!

Fantastic.  First time for me and it was a breeze.  Next time I will make them thinner so they crisp up more and faster than they did.  I made them for breakfast with poached eggs and hollandaise.  This is a keeper for me.

First, this recipe is the best.  I served it at Oktoberfest (I know it's not traditional but neither am I) and everyone loved it.  I cooked 5lbs of potato's and thought I'd overdone it but I had 8 guests and not one pancake left. (Darn!) I cooked them ahead of time and then re-heated them in a hot (400) oven for a few minutes and they were perfect.  I made homemade applesauce and served them with sour cream.  I just washed the potatoes and grated them in a food processor without peeling. If you have a question about the green color see my other posting.

Huge Hit with my family!  Fantastic.  I drained them by squeezing them in cheesecloth.  I made extra so I can follow the suggestion of eating leftover's in sandwhiches.  I cant wait until lunch tomrrow!

I'd heard of potatoe pancakes before but had never made them.  I tried this recipe and it didn't disappoint.  They turned out great.  My kids (5 & 8) said they were yummy and tasted just like the hash browns you get at Pembina Village (a local restaurant).  I had to cook them longer than what was indicated but that might have been because I used an electric frying pan.

very tasty basic recipe!  I used slightly more flour than indicated. I quickly "grated" mine up with a food processor and the grating attachment...saved lots of time and energy!  They were served up with applesauce!  YUM!

Fantastic! Just like my German grandma used to make. I never knew how easy they were! I made them for my husband for fathers' day and he said they were just like he remembered from his childhood. My 2 year old gobbled them up as well. I used red potatoes and topped them with applesauce. Yum! Regarding the reviewer who said they were an ugly green color - there isn't anything green in the recipe, so unless you were using really bad potatoes or something, you must have done something really wrong. These are great!

My family really enjoyed these. I used frozen hash browns, thawed and drained. They were still a little too wet so I added a little extra flour. Make sure your oil is hot enough before placing them in the pan. They brown up quickly and hold together nicely without soaking up too much oil. Thanks for sharing.

I don't know what happened.  It was not good, maybe the potatoes needed to be drained or wrung out?  Not sure, but they didn't stick together.

I make mine just about the same way except I don't use the baking powder and I sometimes add garlic.

True and old fashioned recipe, my Mom used the same one too, so did Grandma.

If you put the shredded potatoes in a bowl of water, they won't turn color.  There were fantastic, my family loved them.  Great with wasabi flavored sour cream!

We made these for Chanukah and loved them.  We followed the recipe – changing nothing.  If you want traditional potato pancakes, try this recipe.  
**note – make certain to allow time to drain your grated potatoes.**

These were AWESOME!  These were the real deal -- REAL authentic potato pancakes!  I was a bit worried about the excess liquid from the shredded potatoes, but I just drain and continued with the recipe.  My potatoes were rather large, so I think next time I'll double the onions!  Thank you for such a wonder (AND EASY) recipe!

Delicious! For a wholesome meal, serve the pancakes with yoghurt with a pinch of cayenne and fresh, steamed spinach with a touch of soy sauce.

this is the exact same recipe my great grandmother from Ukrania used to make.  Only one additional suggestion.  Once potatoes are grated squeeze out excess water either using a cheese cloth or 3 paper towels work well too.  The latkes will cook better without the excess water.  Made them for one daughters preschool class and the others kindergarten class.  Both were great successes.  We either have them with sour cream or applesauce.

These were pretty good but even with a whole onion in them they still tasted as though they were missing something.  I tried to keep them warm in the oven as other reviewers had suggested but some of the pancakes lost their crisp crunch.  The ones that I did last were by far the best.  Maybe next time I'll try them with some green onion instead.

This recipe was basically tasty,but it needed a little revving up. Next time I make it I will increase the amount of salt and pepper and throw in some garlic. Otherwise, it was very good.

I added some salt to shredded potatoes to draw out extra water and to prevent it from turning into pink/brown. I didnt add extra salt into the mixture, but added 1 teaspoon of curry powder to add extra flavour. I served it with mayonise instead of sour cream. My fiance  asked me to make again with some spring onion(shallot) added. Nice recipe, I will try it again ;).

Very tasty! After reading other reviews, I added extra salt up front. I shredded the potatoes directly into the mixture, stirring frenquently so they wouldn't turn pink. I used xlarge eggs & small/medium sized potatoes. The consistency was perfect. When dropping the tblsps into the pan, it might seem a little runny, but don't let that fool you. Just press each patty flat, and it should cook up just fine.  My husband is already asking when I'm going to make this one again!

I made these as latkes for a Chanuka party and they were a real hit! I had to triple the salt, though - and some people still added their own. It's a good idea to squeeze the excess water out of the shredded potatoes before mixing with the rest of the ingredients. Terrific with sour cream or applesauce!

This recipe is awesome!  I didn't dry out the potatoes enough, but they still turned out great.  It is a simple recipe that has ingredients that are already found in your kitchen.  I have to cook these more often.  :)

I thought these were great, they tasted just as I imagined they would.  I served them with applesauce and with maple syrup and ate them as the main meal.  I followed the recipe as given and I would not change anything.

Wonderful recipe!  My husband ate so many he didn't even care about the rest of the meal.  I did add about 1 more tablespoon of flour because I didn't dry off the potato shavings nearly enough.  But it was so quick, easy, and yummy!!!!

These are great.........here's an interesting little change.  Add a TBS of sugar and 1/4 cup of Kraft grated Parmesan cheese.  They are best if you pat them down to as thin as you can make them.  Also give them a quick shake of salt while still warm out of the pan.   We always serve them with both ketchup and sour cream.

Bery good! Make sure to season! Didn't change oil?! Weren't any wetter then you'd expects?! Used red, gold & russet potatos, at different times, all worked. All good.

My dad made these years ago (6 kids + mom and dad)= 20# of potatoes, peeled and shredded for a Sunday feast. 
We always served them with white sugar, sprinkled on them as soon as they came out of the cast iron frying pan.
I am making them tonight for my wife and myself.

This was excellent, like the ones that are served with fish fries in Wisconsin.  The only thing I did different was I soaked the shredded potato and squeezed out the juice before adding the rest of ingredients.

This is the same recipe that my mother used in the 40's.  

So that the potatoes do not turn black, drain the juice and squeeze some lemon on it. No milk is needed.

Cooked these up tonight to try something new and scrape together a dinner with limited pantry ingredients. I should say I've never cooked, or eaten, anything like this before and I found the whole process really messy and time-consuming. But that could be my inexperience and the fact that all I had was a cheese grater to shred the potatoes. Took forever and it made way more than I was expecting, but the results far surpassed my expectations. I followed the recipe exactly but for adding minced garlic and chives to the batter and the little pancakes fried up great and were tasty enough to be good on their own. Served with steamed vegetables and cottage cheese they made a great meal in a pinch.

Excellent pancakes.  I don't use the baking powder and squeeze my shredded potatoes in a cheesecloth to remove excess water, depending on how much moisture the potatoes have.  Serve with fresh applesauce - YUMMMM!  Just like grandma used to make.

What a pain to make! I even partially precooked my potatoes in the micro, chilled and grated (no off color potatoes). Followed the recipe exactly.  Would not stick together at all. Ended up just like hash browns.  No little pancackes, so I just dumped the rest of the bowl directly into the skillet and finished it that way. I will either buy frozen hash browns or make them from partially precooked potatoes. Just a note though, partially cooked potatoes do grate up nicely in a FP and never oxidize, no drying in a spinner or tea towel.  No rinsing either. Try it.

Yum Yum, these were delicious!  I did squeeze the water out from the potatoes after shredding and added in some garlic powder and a little sweet paprika.  Otherwise followed the recipe and they came out nice and crispy on the outside and soft in the middle.  The texture was a little more between a potato pancake and a hash brown.  The "batter" help up really well and was very easy to put spoonfuls in the skillet and flatten down.  Served with some ketchup on top.  Would also be good with a little sour cream.  Thanks for this recipe!  These make great goodies for breakfast!

These were so great I'm ashamed to say how many I ate once I'd cooked them.  I threw the onion in the food processor instead of chopping it, I didn't see the point in shredding the potatoes and not the onion and I wanted to save some time.  I did add maybe 2t of salt instead of 1/2t at least, for 6 medium potatoes (I used about 12 small ones as it was all I had) it really wasn't enough salt for my taste.  I also added closer to 3/4t of pepper and if I'd remembered I would have put in a little chipotle powder for a kick.  I did one pancake as a tester first for the seasoning, then added more to the rest if I thought it needed it.

Yummy! Had these for dinner tonight. Took a while to shred that much potato and I went ahead and just shredded the onion as well to save on dishes. I thought they were ok plain, but really good with a little bit of maple syrup on top.

I followed TDZANKL's advice and peeled and boiled the potatoes for a few minutes the night before. Other than adding more flour and salt, I followed this recipe and they came out beautifully. I found it yielded quite a few more latkes than the recipe states, but they all got eaten regardless!

Did not even bother to peel them.  Turned out absolutely perfect. Cooked them on a cast iron griddle three at a time.  If I would've had bacon grease, I would've fried them up in that.  Thank you!

Really good but we made too soon and tried to keep warm wrapped in tinfoil. Then they got soggy, so make and put right away on people's plates. Otherwise it was really crispy and excellent. Add extra seasonings to flavor/spice it up!

A very good recipe!  My husband had told me to find a recipe for these, and they are a big hit.  The list of ingredients makes too much for our family, but can easily be cut in 1/2.  Usually I only use one egg, and that seems to work just fine.

These were GREAT!  I actually shredded the onion also which tricked my son.  Rinsing the potatoes in cold water and letting them drain was the key.

Mine didn't stick together well and I thought the whole thing was a little bland. It may (likely) have been my inexperience in making these, but as these turned out. I won't be trying them again.

Yum! I was not in the mood to shred potatoes so I just sliced them thinly. Since they couldn't be made into pancakes, I had to turn them often once they were in the pan. A keeper!

Made these tonight for the holidays and they tasted JUST like my grandmother's latkes.  I used my cheese grater to grate the potatoes and the onion.  I squeezed the extra liquid out with a kitchen towel, but added 3 extra tsp of flour (I had some juicy potatoes!).  I also used an entire onion and threw in a little garlic powder, "just cuz."  Served em with applesauce and sour cream.  I just ate one cold out of the fridge and that was pretty darn good too!

These are very simple to make. My boyfriend grew up on potatoe pancakes and fish and loved these. I used onion powder instead of diced onion. Next time I will used green onions and add cheese.

quite fabulous, thank you SO much for the recipe!  this will be our go-to hanukkah latke recipe from now on.  they stuck together fabulously, crisped up nicely (if they start to get burned instead of browned, you need to have more oil in the pan), and honestly, this is not a low-fat entree, so go ahead and use enough oil to make them come out right!!!

My husband liked these ok. I did not like them, principally, I think, because after 2 hours of labor, I had grey potato pancakes to show for it that smelled good and didn't taste particularly special. I wanted something more delicious--a little bit more like french fries in a pancake shape I think...and that is not what I got. Don't think I'll bother to make them again, but for anyone else that is curious, my husband says they are tasty with sour cream & applesauce.

So yummy!  I squeezed the potatoes mostly dry before I mixed it with the other ingredients.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and they turned out great!  I'll try making it with cooking spray next time because it was pretty oily.

This recipe takes me back to when I was little! I've been looking for a recipe with this particular "taste & texture". I did add 1 more egg, 1 more tbls. flour & upped the baking powder to 1/2 tsp. as it didn't seem to be enough for the amount of potatoes I shredded. Also, I used a sweet onion. The potatoes were brown by the time I cooked them, but it didn't affect the flavor or the outcome! They turned out perfectly!

These were the BEST potato pancakes I've ever had!  I didn't change a thing, but I did take one reviewer's suggestion of soaking the shredded potatoes in cold water until I was ready to use them.  They stayed nice & white and drained easily.  This is a new favorite for our family - yummmmmmmmmm!!

These are awesome. I also soak the grated raw pototoes in cold water till I'm ready for them and then dry them in clean tea towel. This is great to do if you are making them on a day where you can get the "messy" part done earlier in the afternoon.  Also, I know it's not called for but as a garlic lover, I also add some garlic salt to the mixture and fry them in kosher peanut oil.

These ARE potato latkes.  Potato pancakes use much finer potato pieces and much more flour and egg.  I have a much easier approach.  We put all the egg and onion into the blender and puree it (and use one egg for every two medium or every one very large potato) and then add the potatoes in chunks, some at a time.  If you like shreds sticking out, save a quarter of the potatoes and put them through a grater or the shredding disk of the food processor, mixing them into the blended mix.  This works like a charm and makes great latkes.  You still need to cook the latkes as soon as the mix is ready to avoid discoloration.  If we need to work in advance, I peel and cut the potatoes in advance and save them in a bowl of ice water until we're ready for the blender and the frying pan.

Thanks for the recipe! I had to add extra flour because the potatoes released copious amounts of juice into the batter (despite draining and squeezing), but otherwise everything went according to plan.

I tried to follow recipe,but 2 tablespoons of flour didnt seem enough to me, so I added slightly more.Taste was okay,but to be honest I think I will stick to my own recipe.Thank you for sharing never the less.

My daughter and I made these the other night. She's learning how to cook and I thought this was a pretty simple recipe to start with. They were excellent. We did add more onion than called for and they would have been good with some apple chunks in them as well. next time we're going to try that. They were a hit with everyone, nonetheless.

These are excellent hash browns but definitely not potato pancakes.

I fried some bacon and the onion and added it to the mix before frying.  I started out using the grease from the bacon to fry.  I had to use a LOT of oil to fry the whole batch of pancakes. Thanks for the ideas.

I have never had potato cakes work for me.. never.  These tasted great and had a good consistancy.  The only thing I did differently was to add more flour- next time I will only add 1 egg.  To those that complained of them being wet- they aren't going to be dry like a normal pancake.  There wil be some wetness.  Make sure the oil is nice and HOT or the cakes will soak it up instead of fry.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great recipe.  I made these for mother's day along with German Pancakes.  
I soaked the shredded potatoes in ice water and they turned out great!
Be sure to cut the onions really small or they will stay raw when you cook them.

These were OK. We have a large family and these made plenty for everyone. I think they tasted too much like hash browns though and not very authentically german. I might try them again but not likely

Wonderful recipe. I had some leftover mashed potatoes and added those into the mixture and it came out great. I served them with sour cream and chives. A big hit with the family.

Really liked this recipe; reminded me on home when I was little and my grandma made this with fresh out-of-the-garden applesauce.  I served it with pear sauce from Trader Joes and it was really good.  Too bad there is not a healthier way of frying the 'Puffer' as I really wanted a Schnaps afterwards to give my stomach a fat-break.  Will make this again from time to time.

This was great! I sprinkled "Splenda" on top and had homemade Apple Butter on the side. "Wonderful". I cut this recipe to 3 servings and the two of us had some left over after breakfast. It required some preparation ahead of time,but it was worth the extra effort. The evening before,I boiled some potatos with the skin on for a few minutes. The next morning they peeled and grated easily.

Worked great for me.  I used left over mashed potatoes and extra flour.  I have never seen anything go so fast.  I could not make them quick enough.  Thanks.

Good recipe! I would dry the potatoes with a cheesecloth or paper towel and also noticed that it took much longer than 3 minutes to cook.

I halved the recipe to make less servings.  I halved every ingredient, and next time I try it, I will just use half the potatoes but use the same for everything else.  The potato shreds didn't hold together so well when I only used 1 egg and 1 tblspn of flour.

very easy, used food processor with shredder blade to make quick work of potatoes.  Added extra egg when all mixed up because it didn't seem enough with just the two, but I might have used larger potatoes then called for. Very good flavor, my husband even gave a 'yummy wiggle' when first ate it!

I used frozen hashbrown shreds as others suggested, and I did have to add more flour to offset the extra liquid.  I should have flattened the potato patties to 1/2 inch which probably would have added to the overall crunchy texture.  I served this with sweetened apple sauce on the side...yummy!

these were good. i can understand what the other reviewer means when she said they turned greenish. i had to wait a little longer to make the potatoes  because i was also making my dogs their supper simultaneously, so they turned a dark pink, and when they cooked, they turned greenish. still good though. Just make sure you make them right a way.

These turn out great.  They're very plain which is how they should be.  Make sure you get them really really thin so that they cook quickly.  Otherwise it might take about 10 minutes per side.  We served them with sour cream.

These little pancakes are great!!! The only thing I changed was the amount of flour - I had to add more as the potatoes kept letting out water making the batter to wet.  I did add a dash of cajun seasoning to the batter. Great recipe.

This is a fantastic recipe and tasted just like the potato pancakes my Mother and Grandmother used to make when I was little.  I followed the recipe and they are the best tasting!!

These were wonderful!  I've tried to make potato pancakes before by just estimating amounts of potato, onion, egg, etc. with mediocre results.  I followed this recipes exactly, cooked them in a cast iron skillet, and topped with sour cream.  Excellent!

The pancakes turned out crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. Very yummy, but during cooking I had to use more oil for some reason. Also, my pancakes turned out to be very hash brown-like. Wondering if I did anything wrong? Anyway, the part where you have to grate the potatoes was very labor-intensive but the taste of the creation with a touch of sour cream, apple sauce and a sprinkling of dill was heaven on a plate!

I made this recipe for dinner and it turned out very good. I added Italian seasoning, and seasoned salt,as well as a clove of galic in with the onions.  After frying, I laid them on a paper towel to soak up some of the grease, then put them on cooling rack in the oven.  I heated the left overs up for breakfast the same way.  They stayed very crispy in the oven the first day, and slightly less cruchy when I reheated them.  Very good for something different to have for breakfast or with dinner.

this recipe might have a long prep time but it's well worth the trouble! to move things along i shredded my onion instead of mincing it. get everything ready then shred your potatoes last. don't worry if the raw mix discolors a little. it's minor & won't show up in the end result. i also put the first batch on a rack in a warm oven while frying the second batch (18 pancakes total). these were made as an oktoberfest treat for my boyfriend & went beautifully with "baked pork chops I" (another wonderful recipe from this website) & applesauce. thank you wendy!

This is a great recipe! My largest skillet is not so big, and when cooking, after two batches had to add a little more oil. I did not scale this recipe down at all, even though I live by myself. I will have leftovers for days, which is awesome. I added 1/2 a red bell pepper, and 1/4 C fresh dill. In the future I might add a bit of parsley. Serve with dilled sour cream and applesauce! I will make these many times in the future.

Excellent!  Using grated potatoes instead of blending the ingredients is much better than Oma used to make, and I used to think hers were the best.  Very easy!  Serve with applesauce and sour cream.

I could not get these buggers to stay together like a "pancake".  They seemed more like hashbrowns.  My 11 year old loved the taste, so I would make them again.

So simple, yet so good.  I used only one potato, cut down on the rest of the ingredients and made them sans baking powder (didn't have any on hand) and they still turned out great.  I also didn't have any suitable topping so I had them with cream cheese and it was surprisingly good.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

We really enjoyed these. I love potato pancakes and this was such a simple recipe to follow. NOTE: Don't try to make your pancakes too big or it just doesn't work the same. My first try I used too much of the mixture so it was thicker then it should have been and took longer to fry and was not as crisp. These are great with eggs or with a bit of sour cream and applesauce on the side. Thank you Wendy

Perfect.  I'm "new" to cooking and had no problems with this recipe.  Soaked the potatoes in cold water (with ice) prior to grating them.  Used a cheesegrater as I don't have a food processor but still wasn't much of a hassle.  Then soaked the shredded potatoes in cold water again until ready.  My german fiance adored them.  I served them with applesauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great German recipe! My boyfriend and roommate loved it. The only changes I made were in the amount of oil used, 2 tablespoons just wasn't enough to brown the whole batch. This may have been due to the fact that I cook with cast iron. So I kept about 1/4 inch in the pan at all times, but after making that little adjustment they browned perfect!

These are pretty good and pretty easy.  Quite economical with a cheap bag of spuds.  However, I found that using a small frying pan, the first batch used up all the oil.  I didn't replace the pan with more oil for the second batch, and they didn't turn out quite the same.  Not as cooked in the center.  So next time I think I'll use my largest fry pan and do more at one time so that I don't have to keep refilling the oil, and waiting for it to heat up.  A little on the fatty side for us, but a good treat every now and then!

The best potato pancakes I have had in a long time.  The only problem was that the potatoes were still a little under cooked.  That didn't seem to matter there were no leftovers.  Denise

These were wonderful. I used about 1/4 cup of fried onion bits instead of fresh onion and they tasted great.

My family loved this recipe.  It is definitely a "keeper".  My hubby's German Grandmother used to make these for him, and he said these reminded him of hers!  Mine were also a little "wet", but I'll try to strain the potatoes a little more next time.

I used 4 eggs, mainly to hold the pancakes together better, and served them baked salmon. I am sure this will become a popular meal at our restaurant.

So delicious! We don't own a food processor so had to grate it the old-fashioned way, (which did take quite a bit longer,) but they turned out perfect. Another time saving tip: On a busy morning/day, just prep the ingredients and put the bowl in the fridge. Once you're home, just give it a stir, heat up the oil, and... German Potato Pancakes, anyone?

These were great. I made so much I put some aside and mixed red bell pepper and garlic jalapeno seasoning. Those were FANTASTIC. I used 4 large potatoes and was able to put 8 pancakes in the fridge and warmed them up the next day on an ungreased cookie sheet at 325.

Great simply easy recipe. I used 1 bag simply shredded potatoes and added 1/4 cup of the green part from pencil onions chopped. It’s a keeper. Served with sour cream & apple  sauce. #YUMYUMYUM...

To this recipe I add a spoon full of oats to soak up some liquid. Also nutmeg and black pepper. We usually eat applesauce and/or salade with it. The trick it to grate the potatoes just before you are ready to cook.

What a great recipe! I used two large Idaho potatoes, shredded and then wrung dry - almost too dry! So I added another egg and a teaspoon more flour, and they were just right. I also added dried Parsley and Chives (as that is what I had), additional salt sprinkled on as eaten, and they were delicious topped with sour cream and applesauce. Thank you for a great recipe!

I made them with frozen hash brown potatoes.  Not bad at all.  I should have got the oil hotter on the 1st batch but the second batch were brown perfectly.

We loved these! I’ve always wanted a good fried potato or hash brown recipe but had not found it.  Now I have a “keeper” recipe!  I added a little more salt and onion, plus a tablespoon of dried parsley.  I used my fingers to pick up the potato mixture and drop it in the 12” iron skillet, then just pushed each clump down gently.  I didn’t really flatten them.  They were wonderfully crispy on the outside and potato-y soft on the inside.  I had to add a little more oil a couple of times.

Followed the recipe, except halved it as I cooked for one.  As good as any potato pancakes as I have had. I did sift the flour and beat egg separately before adding to the dry ingredients. Used box grater to shread the potatoes and a mandolin to cut the onions quickly.  I noted some asked about the potatoes turning brown.  My suggestion is to have all ingredients prepped before peeling the potatoes, including having the egg mixture ready to receive the potatoes and onions.  I highly recommend using cheesecloth to squeeze water from the potatoes. Enjoy, I did!

They were absolutely wonderful! I put in a whole onion and dropped them by 1/4 cups full. The whole family loved them. We will be having this breakfast quite often because it is delicious, easy to make and economical! We served them with sour cream and applesauce and had poached eggs for a complete breakfast!

This is an easy and delicious recipe. I used a food processor to finely shred the potatoes, one by one. As each potato was finished shredding, I immediately dropped them into a salad spinner filled with very cold water. When all the shredded potatoes were in the water I drained them, rinsed them twice more with fresh cold water, then spun them twice, squeezed handfuls of the potatoes draining as much of the remaining moisture, and dropped them into the egg and flour mixture. Following the remaining directions, I hand formed small pancakes, frying them 3 minutes in medium hot vegetable oil, which resulted in good crisp browning, and fluffy delicious pancakes with a hint of onion. Applesauce is a great accompaniment! Enjoy!

Reading some of the negative reviews, I feel that it's helpful to share what makes this recipe great and what can go wrong. There are no bad potatoes only bad potato preparation.
Using 6 medium potatoes is not a standard measurement so some of this is just going to come down to experience with the ingredients. If your potatoes are a little wet add more flour, I added 1 & 1/2 tablespoons more, with just a pinch of baking soda extra.
 Seasonings are really individual and these pancakes are often served with sausages or other foods so I don't feel that this is any fault at all in the recipe. Some side dishes are ment to be served like this to balance out other heavly seasoned foods. If you are making potato pancakes the star of the show then season them!
 For myself I added garlic salt, parsley and peprika. when frying this I liberally added butter and bacon fat ( cause a I had some on hand) and it turned out great. 
I served it with sour cream and ketchup but it can be sweet or savory. One other note is that leaving the peel on adds to the flavor and I mix my potatoes up. I like having russet, red and Yukon gold all together and this recipe benefits from the slightly varied tastes of the different potatoes mingled together.

I followed the directions; even taking the suggestions of the reviews with 5 stars.  Not sure what I did wrong, but these fell apart when I was frying them.  I agree they might be used for home fries, but not for potato pancakes.

For those who find this kinda bland make sure you added enough onion. When cakes are done top with applesauce
and/or maple syrup.

Very easy to make. Used my grater attachment on my kitchen aid, very fast to prep. Held grated potatoes in ice water then squeezed dry with paper towels. Used gluten free flour. They came out crispy & delicious! Added garlic & onion powder & salt. Served with apple sauce yum! Will make again

Brings back memories of the Christmas markets in Germany! It takes practice and a little finesse to get them perfect, but the recipe is great. Squeeze those potatoes out well with cheesecloth! I kept adding oil since my non stick pan makes a funny looking crust. Nothing like homemade chunky applesauce to go with it! Mmmm.

I make these often.   Always a hit! A families favourite! One reviewer commented that these were bland...Don't be afraid to add more flavour.   Add a bit of garlic powder or fresh garlic and the green of three green onions.  I do and they always turn out. Our favourite topping is sour cream and salsa.  Great with bacon or sausage.  If you are a potato fan like me, you will love these tasty tater patties.

These potato pancakes are delicious! I cut the recipe in half as it was only myself and wife having dinner, I made my usual tweeks to the recipe measurements based on our taste , oh and I just added about a teaspoon of granulated garlic powder because we love garlic....lol. We had these as a side with with “Oktoberfest chicken and red cabbage “ another Allrecipes recipe posted by HerbanSpoons which happens to be FANTASTIC!

I liked this recipe. To avoid oxidation of the potatoes, I put a bowl with salt and water under the shredder. After all the potatoes were shredded, I drained them: Result - no oxidation. 

I will make them again

This was a good basic recipe for German potato pancakes.  They came out very tasty.  I added more seasonings and used frozen shredded potatoes, which I defrosted in the microwave.

Wait until you are ready to cook them immediately before you are ready to cook. I made them about an hour before I needed to cook them and the potatoes turned black. (Oxidation)

A little bland, despite adding crumbled bacon and cooking in bacon grease.  I meant to do like other reviewers and add garlic powder, but forgot, so mostly made the recipe as written.  Shredded the potatoes in the food processor.  Pretty quick to assemble, and they held together well in the pan.  They did need more than 3 minutes per side to brown.  It's hard to go wrong with potatoes in our family, so everyone ate them, but all agreed that they needed a bit more oomph!

I followed the recipe. I used gluten free all purpose flour as my daughter has gluten issues. I did add a sprinkle of garlic powder and some onion powder and parsley flakes.  I did squeeze out the excess water from the grated potatoes and ended up adding an additional tablespoon of flour. I fried them in batches of four in a skillet and they turned out quite well. I must say that I feel you should add additional salt upon plating as that does seem to brighten the flavors.

My German grandmother would fry them in a cast iron skillet very thin to where they looked lacy along the fried edge! Maybe used a little less onion though and don’t remember the  baking powder! 
Also she grated the potatoes on the smallest grate! Have to press out the water with a spoon!

This is not a German recipe.  We do not use flour in kartoffelpfannkuchen but matzoh meal or bread crumbs.  Close though.

I've made this twice now. It's better than Perkins pancakes.
Make sure to incorporate the egg juice into each pancake as you place it in to fry. 4 potatoes large size was enough. The best one yet!

I make these all the time. Grate the potatoes into a strainer. Add a good dollop of sour cream and press. the sour cream stops the oxidation.

don't stay together super well when being eaten. I'd chop the potato even finer next time. Did add another TBSP of flour as well.

Our family all liked them. I made this before reading other reviews. As others have mentioned I would drain some of the moisture from the potatos and double the flour. Will make again.

My mother used to make these when I was a child, so it brought back some good memories.  They turned out well, but you need to watch them closely so they don't get too crusty!  With sour cream and applesauce on the top they were yum!

Came out great! Only thing I changed was adding some red pepper flakes, garlic powder, and ground cayenne pepper to spice them up a bit.

Actually true German Pancakes would be not be shredded but they are ground to a very pulp looking mass. You would also add some nutmeg. Never serve sour cream (that would be latkes) or applesauce at the same time...only apple sauce.
That is how my mother made them in Germany and I make them still like that.

Made two batches.  The first I followed as directed.  It was very good.  Season to taste.  As noted the recipe itself is not heavily seasoned.  We used Johnny's Seasoning Salt (no MSG variety) instead of salt and pepper.

The second batch I shredded 4 medium potatoes as usual.  Then I took the other potatoes and put them in the processor with the other ingredients to cream the egg, potato, flour, etc. The second batch was way more popular.  The pancakes were a smoother texture.  I will process some of the potato with the egg next time for certain.

I love German potato cakes, my mom used to make these a lot growing up. They are cheap to make and filling. Great childhood memories eating these. Now I make them for my family and they love them too!! I add extra seasoning, just a personal preference, garlic powder etc..but mom didn't, either way they are yummy. Filling dinner on a budget, not meant to be fancy. Just good ole simple food!

I went looking for a recipe to use my left over mashed potato's. I decided to make potato pancakes but couldn't remember what all I needed. I was surprised to find only recipes with grated potatoes. We call these hash browns. Any way I used the basic recipe for my potato pancakes and they turned out great. I did add mushrooms and green peppers. Thanks for teaching me something new.

I combined  crab meat with it, with some green onions, two stalks of celery, along with onion and garlic powder, some hot pepper sauce it stretched the better triple so I just adjusted the original ingredients to suite the taste and texture.

Grate potatoes very fine or even to a mush, rinse then squish out as much moisture as possible.  Add a finely chopped clove of garlic.  The potato needs to cook in the pancake, so adjust temperature accordingly.

Written as-is, the recipe was just ok.   I took the advice of others and soaked the shreds in water, which helped the color.  They were kinda bland (even after I increased the amount of cheese).   However, I made them for a New Years dinner party, and other people loved them.  Also, a little goes a LONG way!  The recipe made more than I thought it would!

Even my super picky 2 year old ate it and he doesn't eat anything lol. Put the potatoes in the food processor and then each one into ice cold water afterwards and then drained them. Wondering if this part is that necessary for next time because you don't see the color once they are cooked anyways. My potatoes were large, so I doubled the amount of the other stuff and used pancake mix and extra flour. Ended up needing to drain the potatoes throughout the time of frying them, but all in all, it all ended up super yummy. :)

It's delicious, and easy. 

The recipe as written had a bit more egg flavor than the clan liked. I prepared an uber-simple version with just shredded golden potatoes (washed, but not peeled), flour, and milk in about the same ratios as the recipe provides, with salt added to taste afterward. We liked that more, but there's still room for improvement. 

Fortunately, this recipe is easy to experiment with.

I used to make these years ago, but wrung out the shredded potatoes in a clean towel. If I had done that this time, this would have rated five stars. I'll make them again soon as they are delicious and were a terrific accompaniment to our roast sirloin entre.

Loved these Crispy babies, but felt very guilty after. Good with applesauce. Helps the guilt plus really paper towelling them.

Tasted good by following directions, but the pancakes turned green when I cooked them, and did not look appetizing. I will make again, but will probably use frozen shredded potatoes.

These were good, but I think I need to try again to perfect the technique... you definitely need quite a bit of oil and a very hot pan to make them crispy. Keep them smaller and thin for the best results.

I added finely diced bacon to the batter and as they were cooking I topped with seasoning salt. I also made them larger and put sour cream and green onions on top and served!

Kids loved these as I made them for German Day for Kindergarten international day.  I tripled the recipe and also added 1 tsp. of parsley.  I added a bit more flour at the beginning as I knew potato mixture would drain a bit more water during the long standing period as I fried up batches for what seemed like an hour.  I also kept potato mixture in a large salad spinner and periodically spun it if I saw the potatoes seemed to be gaining liquid.  as far as frying, two key things:  a) make sure oil is hot before you put the potato mixture into oil.  b) use enough oil to cover bottom of pan, otherwise the pancake won't crisp up and brown.

We served them with traditional chunky applesauce and sour creme with chives.  

YUMMY!

Very good! Didn't have any baking powder and recipe worked well without it. Added cooked bacon and sausage to the mix for extra pop and topped with caramelized onions. Will definitely make again!

A perfect basic recipe for traditional potato pancakes.  My great-aunt made them with ham and green onion, so I did that here and they were wonderful.  I recommend experimenting with different meats,onions, and potatoes just for fun!

Hello Happy New Year!

I have been making this recipe for years, just halving it to my needs.  My husband was never a real fan,  I myself finding it good but somewhat soggy and keeping the oil  ( I blame the eggs).  Well today I said let me make it again.  Used fresh onion put in my food processor, and omitted the egg.  Boy what a difference.  Very crunchy, cooked through and while eating my plate just sitting and saying out loud to myself  This Is Good.  Can the egg change soo much and maybe also the onion helped? Everything else stayed the same in the recipe.  I do not know I am but a mere domestic goddess.  But if this has not been the 5 star recipe for you but the 3 or4, maybe keeping it a little drier as I did might help it out.

I grew up eating potato pancakes and applesauce but my dad always used mashed potatoes so when I saw this and read a bunch of people calling them true potato pancakes I had to try them.  I definitely enjoyed them but they were a bit too floury for me,  its also super important not to make them too big because then they don't cook right. The first few I made were very soft and under cooked in the middle. The smaller ones though were pretty good.
EDIT: I feel like when I was mixing in the flour I read it wrong and added too much without noticing, haven't made them again so I can't be sure yet.

A bit bland, but a great alternative to mashed potatoes for dinner. Make sure they're flat like pancakes (not thick like fish cakes) to get a good crisp to them.

Very good and simple.  Be careful, don't want to use too much potatoes, go for smaller potatoes.  Also add a little seasoning salt to give it a little something extra more than just salt and pepper

Perfect! My mom was German and made these once a year. Other recipes call for added ingredients, but this is the REAL way potato pancakes were meant to be. We always added homemade applesauce and sour cream to them.  Thank you for sharing this recipe! I never got it from my mom, as she never wrote down the recipe for anything.  I can carry on her tradition!!

I've been making these for years with a virtually identical recipe. They are fantastic! If you watch the video, the onion is chopped by hand, while the potato is shredded in a food processor. I shred both with the food processor because it saves time and I prefer the consistency of both being shredded. Give it a try!

Good, but one major problem.  I use a fine grater or a German grater, which is rectangular in shape with crossed wires, like a tennis racket to get the correct texture.   Other than that, the ingredients are fine.

I absolutely loves these pancakes. I did not use any onion as I think sometimes onion overpowers the taste. I also shredded then soaked potatoes in water and drained well.

We halved the recipe. I thought they were ok.  They were a bit bland.  I was hoping for a bit more flavor. My husband didn't care for them and gave them a 2.  My kids didn't care for them either.   I ate them plain, and perhaps a dab of sour cream would have made a difference.

Made it exactly as the recipe is written with the addition of 1 tbsp of minced garlic. It was perfect, crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked potato on the inside. My husband loved them we had them for breakfast and he wants them for dinner too.

Love this recipe!  Easy and delicious. Reminds my husband of the potato pancakes he grew up eating.  Great Friday night meal during lent.   Our favorite condiments are applesauce, or sour cream and a little hot sauce. 
I did not find the oxidation to be a problem.  Once they are fried, it's a non issue.

I really liked this recipe.  Yes there was some oxidation on the potatoes.  Didn't change the taste at all.  I added some spices to taste.  This is the type of potato pancake I was looking for, instead of so many that are just batter.  Good job.

In Latvia we are making these pancakes pretty often. They taste excellent. Only we add some garlic too. It gives a better taste.

This recipe has been in our family for years!  My German grossmutter (grandma) passed this down to my mom and then me.  I am making this for Christmas day dinner to accompany my ham.  My family of 6 likes a lot of potato pancakes so I make a huge bowl.  I also add about 1/2c of farina for added fiber to the batter. If you like a crisper pancake, squeeze the potatoes to get rid of the liquid.

Yum! My first patty broke in half so I said the heck with it and just made these like hash browns, breaking it up as it cooked. My husband, a real hash brown aficionado,claimed these the Blue Ribbon Winner. Oh, I added bacon bits to it and it really sent it over the top. Thx~

Just made these - yum. Substituted Egg Beaters for the egg, added a little garlic powder and used the food processor to deal with the potatoes. Drained the potatoes on paper towels (two sets of towels) and cooked in a ceramic pan with olive oil spray. They were on the table in 20 minutes (note - only used two potatoes and adjusted recipe accordingly as there are only two of us). Served with apple sauce.

Will be making these again (my German partner said they tasted like the ones his Grandmother made).

Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside. I did not expect this to work! Somehow the pancakes magically stick together in the oil. Perfect!

One thing the recipe is missing that was in the video for this recipe is that you are supposed to put the potatoes in a dish towel and squeeze out as much moisture as you can before mixing in with the egg mixture. This will probably help out with those who couldn't get the cakes to hold together. Not sure if it will help with the greying or not.

Tried this for the first time and prepared half of the mixture as recipe stated.  The other half I diced  about 1/2 cup of Recipe Beginnings 3 pepper and onion blend (frozen mixture of sliced onions, red, yellow and green peppers).  Also added 1/2 teaspoon parsley and a few dried red pepper flakes.  Frozen blend makes the mixture a little moist so I added another tablespoon of flour.  We liked both original recipe and pepper blend, but our favorite was the pepper blend.  Will make this again.  Great with bacon and eggs.

A fairly tasty and simple recipe!  I used a little less oil than called for, but otherwise made recipe exactly as written.  Topped pancakes with sour cream, scallions, and apple sauce.  If I were to make this recipe again (which I probably will), I think I would try using scallions in the batter, instead of raw onion, and would also try adding some additional spices.  I also liked that this recipe is easy on the food budget.  Ingredients are inexpensive.

Didn't know how these would turn out for us, but ended up loving them.  The only draw back is that the oil is pretty unusable afterwards, no recycling the oil that you use for this dish.  But otherwise, great dish.

We loved this recipe, our only problem was it didn't make enough! We couldn't get enough so we'll be making these often.

Yum! Perfect. Didn't change anything. Used Yukon Gold potatoes - soaked in cold water - stayed beautifully yellow.

These were awesome. However, the 1/4 c. of oil seemed like too much. I only used 3 large potatoes instead of 6 medium ones, and this made A LOT. I added an extra egg, too. I found these had a hard time staying together in the pan, though. Overall, my husband and I loved them and will make them again!

I grew up eating potato pancakes with applesauce and/or sour cream, but my husband had never eaten them before. This recipe looked good, and didn't disappoint. The leftovers even reheated well when thrown quickly on the skillet for a couple minutes. The one change I'd make next time is increasing the salt/pepper.

This is my grandma's recipe that I've been enjoying for years.  SO good.  I mix the ingredients together in my stand mixer, just for ease, and it gets a little watery, but turns out great.  They did oxidize as they sat as left overs in the fridge, but not before that time.  You can also make them in margarine instead of oil, if you prefer, but don't use butter, as it will burn too quickly.

Wow, these are delicious!!  I made these for breakfast so we could have crispy hashbrowns with every bite.  I am really excited about this & will surely make these many times in the future.  I forgot to add the onion, but will be more careful next time.  We had these with fried eggs over medium and lots of tobasco.. Yuuummmmmmmmm! :) OK, I've been making these exactly as written every weekend for the past month or so and I swear they are addicting!

Delicious!  Just like Mom used to make.  She did her potatoes in the blender but I used the food processor to shred and it was much quicker.  But I think the blender version makes neater and more uniform looking instead of the jagged edges from the shred.  Either way, it works !!  Season to your taste and YES do drain them or they will be too wet !  I always serve with sour cream and applesauce.

These are really delicious and easy to make. I prefered the color and more delicate taste of green onion in mine. I didn't have a problem with it getting grey/green, just rusting, but it doesn't affect the taste. So good that my husband asked me to make them two nights in a row!

This recipe was given to me by my mother-in-law before I was married.  I have made it regularly for the last 40 years.  It is still a special treat, especially now with the invention of the food processor.  We like them salted with ketchup!

This sure yields a lot of pancakes--makes me wish I had used a bigger pan to go faster! These are great food a treat once in a while, otherwise they're a little to greasy for everyday dinner.

I've never liked latkes but wanted to try this recipe out, just in case a miracle happened.  For latkes they were good (or at least, better than my dad's recipe), but well, they were latkes.  I'm sure a true potato-pancake lover would like this recipe, though!

Excellent! I added an extra tablespoon of flour, and to make it more healthy, sprayed my pan with non-stick olive oil cooking spray (instead of frying it in oil). I would definitely make this again!

These are going to be great when I make them the right way.  I wanted to use up some leftover mashed potatos, so I substituted.  Flavor was excellent, cake was crispy.  The added texture when I use shredded potatoes will make these near perfect!

when i made this according to the recipe, they turned out exactly like hash browns. so... i added onion powder and ran the mixture through the food processor then cooked according to the instructions. the result was a very good batch of potato pancakes. thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe, even when I cut it down to two servings, and didn't follow the directions well:-)
Delicious!

Delicious! Make ahead tip: Shred potatoes in processor and immediately add to ice water in a salad spinner. When ready to use, drain the water and spin dry. This also helps eliminate most of the discoloration. As is, it's a little like hashbrowns (still yummy) but if you want a more authentic texture, you can puree some of the potato mixture and mix back into the shredded. We eat it the traditional way...with applesauce!

This was good, albeit a little bland. I added more salt and a good shake of parsley flakes. They took a surprisingly long time to cook, but the kids liked them.

I find that the best way to make crispy and delicious potato pancakes is to shred the potatoes and add nothing more than egg. These were too soggy and absorbed too much oil.

I was unimpressed. In my opinion, it's not worth all the peeling and shredding, just for stuck-together hashbrowns.

I came across this accidentally and am so amazed to find the exact recipe my family has been using for many generations!  Being from a large family, of course we multiple the recipe, which it does very well.  These are also fantastic with baked bean over them.  You can make your own or buy a good quality canned baked bean.  Some in the family like to add extra butter and brown sugar to their baked beans to make a bit of broth which is good too.

excellent consistency and taste. Try a dash of allspice in it - that's the way a German girlfriend made it for me ; allspice makes this recipe fabulous.

I think this one has great promise, but I'd like to try it again.  I made a double batch.  I did not squeeze or drain the potatoes (which is sometimes indicated in other potato pancake recipes), and I noticed there was a fair bit of liquid at the bottom of my bowl.     I also replaced a couple of the potatoes with some sweet potatoes that I had on hand.  They might have been a little old or maybe my onions were bitter, because on the whole I found the pancakes to be just a little bitter.  BUT, because I made adjustments I'm not willing to say that this wasn't a good recipe.  I really liked the oniony flavor and it was pretty easy to make, once I got the hang of how to fry them up without them crumbling to pieces (hint: let the fry long enough to get firm).

This is very authentic and if you feel like the easy way, use frozen, shredded potatoes. Topped with sour cream and applesauce, and you have the perfect side dish. I added garlic powder to the mixture before cooking for a bit more flavor.

This recipe was simple for me to make. I think it needed more salt. I will continue to make this recipe. Im very pleased that my two year old son liked it and asked for more. We ate them all, so that means they were good!*** update*** I never made them again, so I guess we didn't like them THAT much.

These were not at all what I was expecting. I grew up eating potato pancakes, my nanny (half-german, half-scottish) used to make them all the time, should have called her for the recipe... they were a really ugly green color, I ate one, and threw out the rest, was going to save them for my fiance but I knew the color would totally turn him off.

Very good.  I took others' advice and squeezed out the excess water from the potatoes, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  I served this with sour cream and a corn salsa (red onions, roasted red peppers, fresh white corn) and it was amazing.

Very good latkas (or potato pancakes, depenting on who's talking).  They weren't quite a 5, but still good.  I'll make them again when the mood takes me. And do squeeze out as much water as possible, that is key.

yum! I added a small amount of rosemary as I love it. These hit the potato spot.

mmmmm, simple and tasty.  Only thing I did different was add a little bit of garlic powder. 2 thumbs up from my whole family.

I think I made the potato too thin. It probably needs a little more spices.

Excellent, just do it quickly or the potatoes go brown.  Don't rush the frying!!

I made the recipe as published and it was great.  However I had to cook the pancakes longer to get a deep golden color.  Instead of 3 min per side I cooked them 6-8 min per side and they were nice and crispy.  They were also great the next morning heated in the toaster oven and served with eggs.

These are great - and easy with stuff I usually have in the house!  A good sidedish with quiche or omelets.  The potatoes do turn a weird pink color after shredding in the food processor but they turn out fine after frying.

Good but bland. We added more salt and pepper, and also used some Hot & Sweet mustard to dip them in. I would make them again, but with some modifications. Thanks!

Great recipe-tasted like my mother used to make when I was a kid. My ten year old and her friend thought they were great-one used catsup and the other sour cream. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I used very finely shredded potatoes--great texture and flavor.  Even my daughter ate them!  We had a "fish fry" dinner at home -- tasted like a restaurant.  Thanks.

These taste wonderful!  It's well worth going through the trouble to hand grate all those potatoes.  When frying, they do use quite a bit of oil, though.  Thanks for a great change from regular pancakes!

This is our first time ever having potato pancakes....It was easy (aside from the time-consuming shredding of the potatoes) and very tastey.  A few of my kids ate them with syrup on them and the others had mayo on them.  Thank you for the recipe

These were alright.  I would shred the onion & add more salt if we make next time.  We usually don't fry anything so that may have made a difference in feeling that were greasy.

I found these to be very good. My family would like for them to be as thin as possible to make them crunchier. We had ours with sourcream or ketchup.
I will definately make again :)

Very good!  I used pre-shredded hash brown potatoes with onions and peppers in them.  I wasn't exactly sure how many potatoes that consisted of, so I kinda guesstimated, and I ended up adding another egg and more flour.  I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and they were delicious.  My only complaint is that they were rather greasy, at least for my taste, but a very good comfort food.

Delicious! This is the first time my shredded potatoes haven't turned brown! I chilled the pototoes in ice water and put them through my Quisinart in small batches. I pressed as much water as I could out of each batch before mixing it with the egg, etc. I also used Yukon Gold potatoes - don't know if that made a difference.

Taste was pretty good, but I had lots of trouble keeping them together when frying and flipping them.  They needed salt also.
