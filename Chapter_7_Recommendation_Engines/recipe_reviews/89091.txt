My family and I loved these fritters!  I had no fresh corn on hand and used a can of sweet corn which came out fine.  Would have been unbelievable had I used fresh!  Also added a bit of grated onion, yummy!  The sweetness hits you after a few chews and was creamy and perfect to us.  Will so make again.  Just a note to you:  this makes a lot of fritters!  You may wish to half the recipe or freeze the rest for later!

I try to avoid sugar so I made the following healthy changes:
used 1.5 cups zucchini,
doubled the cumin,
omitted the sugar,
added 1/2 cup shredded carrot to sweeten,
used 1.5 cups frozen corn, cooked and drained,
added 1/2 cup shredded onion,
added 4 cloves garlic,
substituted milk with soy milk,
saut√©ed in steel skillet and fried in iron skillet, found that the ones in the  steel skillet came out fluffier and not as greasy
only added 1/4 tspn salt and the chefs trick is to lightly salt the cakes as soon as you place them on the rack, the oil readily absorbs this and seasons it well;
definately needs a yogurt dip to accompany, with mint would be good. Pretty good as far as fritters go.

Great recipe! Used sweet corn and mozz. and parm instead of chedder. Cook it like pancakes (don't flip until little bubbles come to surface) or else will go flat. I will definately make again. Also tastes better cold.

I scaled this down to make 12 but will have to make a full batch next time. Very light and fluffy. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is for me they were a touch too sweet. Next time I will reduce the amount of sugar a little bit. Thanks

What a different app! Another great way to use zucchini! I used frozen corn and fried these in a deep fryer. I do think they needed a little more spice so I will try to experiment next time. They didnt last long in my house. The extra batter stayed nice in the fridge so you can prepare a day ahead.

Love them!  I actually left out the milk, because I used super fresh sweet corn that I had just cut off the cob and it was nice and milky. I am going to try more cheese and cumin the next time, but these are fantastic!

My family loved these!  I chose not to fry them but to cook them in a touch of olive oil, like pancakes.  My kids loved dipping their "pancakes" in ranch (which I made with reduced fat sour cream, fat free plain yogurt and ranch mix)  I left out the cheese but they tasted wonderful even without.  I am sure these taste great as directed but chose to make a little healthier.  We will  be making these often during zucchini season!!
* I have made these 4 times in the last 2 weeks.  I now add chopped bell pepper, carrots and onion to the recipe.  Great way to get kids to eat veggies!

I really did not care for this recipe.  Thought that it was too doughy and bland tasting. I am very surprised at all the good reviews and wonder if someone can tell me what I may have done wrong?  I followed the recipe exactly.

This recipe was very good. However it makes quite a few.  When serving as a side dish, I cut the recipe in half.

This was just the kind of recipe I was looking for, but I only gave it 4 stars because I feel that it went overboard on some ingredients. Made it gluten-free and dairy free using GF flour blend, Ener-G egg replacer, and oat milk. Skipped the cheese and butter. Added 1/2 red onion, chopped finely and some crushed red pepper to suit our taste. Fried it in coconut oil. Served with pickled veggies and cheese for the rest of the family who aren't sensitive to dairy. Kid who hates zucchini had no idea it was even in there! :-) Very much recommend this recipe, but you DON'T need the extra butter at all, and the cheese is not at all necessary. Save the calories.

A bit bland, too much fat in the recipe in my opinion (I even cut the butter to less than half the required amount), a bit too sweet. Not horrible, but not that great. Good consistency though and they cook nicely. Of course, Ranch dressing would add flavour...

These were quite easy to make.  Also quite tasty.  Didn't use up much zucchini though - only about a 2 inch chunk of a large zucchini.  I had scaled recipe down to make only about 10 fritters though.  I would make them again & probably cook them on the barbeque.  But it won't be my first choice in zucchini recipes.

Good! I added some chili powder and fried like I was making pancakes.  We use them as tortillas with pollo asaso, pico and cheese.

ZUCCHINI CRAB FRITTERS!!! My husband does not like corn so I try to appease us both, but with the abundance of zucchinii on hand I came across this recipe (and many others for zucchini & corn). I had some crab meat on hand that needed to be cooked in the next day so I tried this out. The combination is amazing! Thanks for the inspiration!

Thank you so much for this keeper!!

Fabulous recipe. It made a ton of fritters, way more than I expected. The only thing I would change would be to put in more vegetables. I ended up adding more veggies to the batter bowl in the middle of cooking them.

My 13 year old made these last night and they were delicious. Only change was to decrease the sugar significantly to just 2 tblspns which was plenty sweet enough. She made the batter a few hours in advance and storred in the fridge. Fried these up right before dinner....perfect and very tasty. Thanks!

These tasted very bland to me. This recipe really needed a bit more favor. This was my first time making or even eating fritters so perhaps I simply do not know what a fritter is supposed to taste like. I also halved the recipe and it still made TONS.

Oh so tasty and easy.  I made them healthier by spraying my griddle with cooking spray.  They turned out more like pancakes, but I'm just happy I can get my toddler to eat something with veggies in it. I will make & freeze a bunch to heat up for him. Thanks for the recipe!

A lovely recipe! Like most, I changed up a bit. Used Almond milk and added only a 1/4 cup of sugar but next time would leave the sugar out all together, it really doesn't need it. Added some chopped garlic, bit of thyme. I used my wok and peanut oil, as it has a tolerance for high heats and reduces the quilt when you see how many times you have to replentish it in the wok:)
It may have also added a nice flavor as well.
I did add about a 1/2 cup of the milk, just felt it was too thick before adding. Substituted 1 cup of whole wheat, 1 cup all purpose.
I honestly don't think they even need dip, they are that nice on their own.

Very good. I didn't have cheddar so I had to do with mozzarella. I'm sure it would be 5 stars if I had made it correctly.

This was my first time making fritters, and they were absolutely delicious!  My husband and I were eating them almost as fast as they came out of the frying pan.  A couple changes I made, doubled the cumin, added 1 tsp of curry powder, 2 tbsp of grated parmesan cheese, no butter, and only used 1 tbsp of sugar.  Like other reviewers say, these did soak up a lot of oil while they were frying, but the end result was sooooo good!

The most delicious part of the meal. I did not have cumin and it didn't need it. This recipe is perfect. Beware!! You can't eat just one or even two. I use very little oil to fry these. Crispy outside, light and perfectly sweetened inside. Not greasy and makes a huge batch that an be used later on.

Loved these! My 16month old couldn't get enough of them! I usd canned corn as that's what I had on hand, and upped the cumin a little. This recipe makes a TON of batter but the fritters freeze well. Will definitely make them again when fresh corn is at its best. Thanks!

These turned out beautifully, very very easy to make, kids liked them - could have used more seasoning to give 'em a bigger kick though....I'm not used to eating fried food so these were kind of an overload but definately yummy for an occasional snack or meal

This was very good and we will make these again. I would recommend a little more salt as I didn't add enough and I left out the cumin, tho (not a fan of it) - they were great with Wildflower Honey! My husband ate them with Blue Cheese dressing.

We liked this recipe quite a bit.  I added half the amount of sugar the recipe called for and the fritters were still plenty sweet.  We used mozz. and parm. cheese since that's what we had on hand.  Instead of cumin, we used LA Gold (hot sauce) which we added to the wet ingred. Overall, I think this is worth a try.

Delicious! I fried them on the electric pancake griddle.  Great texture. I actually used 1/4 cup sugar instead of 1/2 cup, was just right.

Delicious!! I think I added in a bit more zucc and I scaled down the sugar to about 1/3 cup. I also added some grated onion. I just wish these weren't fried in oil. I think I'll try baking them next time. Other than the oil, these came out perfectly and I now have a ton in the freezer for quick snacks.

I made these last night and really enjoyed them. Like some of the other reviewers I cut the sugar. I also added green onion. These were a fine side dish for baked cod. Next time I'll add some cajun seasoning to add a little bite. Very good recipe.

As so often happens, I made this exactly...except for all the changes.  I didn't want something sweet, so I only used 2 tablespoons of sugar.  Next time I'll probably leave it out altogether.  I used broccoli instead of corn, in keeping with the not sweet theme.  I also cooked them just like pancakes instead of in oil.  With all those caveats, these were VERY yummy!  I think next time I'll try using curry powder for the spice, since that sounds like it'd be very tasty too.

This recipe would be better with only half the sugar (or less)  I kept having to add salt and spices to counter the sweet.   After a couple sets of fritters I finally put the rest of the batter in a baking dish and baked it at 400.  Much better this way!

My mom and I made these last night for so that we could use the fresh zucchini that someone gave us from the garden.  They were GREAT!  I loved the way the fresh corn was sort-of crunchy as you bit into them.  My dad said it was like a surprise with every bite!  We will definately make these again!  I might even try them without the zucchini.  Thanks!

These are tasty but w/ some modifications.  I had to add extra milk b/c the batter was soooo thick, I couldn't even get it mixed w/ just the 1 cup of milk.  I used soy flour and wonder if this made a difference.  I also added more zucchini and corn than called for and lots more seasonings including garlic powder, onion powder, seasoned salt and some goya seasoning.  My fritters were not light and fluffy but tasty.  I think the soy flour made a big difference so will definitely try all purpose next time I make them.  As others have reviewed this makes a ton of fritters!  I actually froze some of the batter.

These were definitely YUMMY!  I read the reviews first which sounded like they needed more seasoning, so I doubled up on the cumin and added a tablespoon of all purpose seasoning by Frontier which has lemon zest, celery seed, garlic, parsley etc.  I added a half a cup of corn meal and a quarter cup of parmesan cheese as well. I reduced the sugar to one third cup and used frozen corn that was defrosted. I made the full recipe because they're great to snack on! Next time to reduce the grease, I'll brown them in the oil and they bake them the rest of the way, because some of mine were thick and I didn't want to overcook them on the outside just so the inside weren't still batter. I lightly salted them once out of the pan which was a great idea I got from one of the reviews! Great for football munching!

made these for dinner and they were a big hit.  I used canned corn instead of fresh or frozen and they turned out good.  They made way too many for 2 people so I put the rest in a pan and baked it like a bread and had it the next night warm with butter.  Very good as a bread would add some jalapeno for a little bite.

I made these exactly as the recipe states, though maybe a bit more zucchini and a bit more fresh corn. The batter was *very* thin and my fritters were more like pancakes rather than like the fat fritters in the picture.  I fried them in an electric skillet. I poured in what I thought was going to be too much oil, but by the time I got finished frying up the fritters, there was almost no oil left.  In other words, these sucked up a LOT of oil. I don't like to think about that too much (gross!) These were very tasty though.  Next time I'd only add a small amount of sugar (why sugar anyway?) and I'd see if I could fry in a smaller amount of oil just enough to keep them from sticking. Maybe I'd cut the butter or some of the butter. I'm not a health nut by any means, but the fat in these counteracted any benefit the veggies might have, so if you're looking to add veggies to your child's diet, I'd look for another recipe.  I might try to bake the batter like one reviewer said. Interesting idea!

These were very good, but I think they needed more spice or a sauce topping to go with it.  They did absorb a lot of oil, but I don't think anyone expected something fried to be healthy.  My batter was initially very doughy before adding the vegetables but became quite watery afterwards, which worried me, but it turned out fine b/c they flatten to make easy silver dollar pancakes.  I used whole wheat flour which tends to be drier, but with all the oil and veggies it turned out fine.  I actually used a little more than 2 cups of zucchini and a whole can of corn.  I think it could've used more zucchini.  I'll definitely make this again w/ some tweaks.

They were so good but I am only giving 3 stars bc they soaked up WAY too much of the oil. If I can find a way to stop them from being so greasy I would make these all of the time! The ranch dressing really added a great flavor!

Oh my goodness!  I wish I could give 100 stars! These are absolutely amazing!  Based on other reviews I just used a can of sweet corn and I halved the recipe and still had a ton of these things.  They were wonderful by themselves and dipped in Ranch dressing.  My 5yr old daughter loved them and my boyfriend finally begged me to take them away before he ate them all!! Haha  I have a garden which is producing a ton of zucchini so I have a feeling I will be making these alot!  I think next time I make them I will be doubling the amount of zucchini just to get more of the veggie into each fritter!  Thank you SO much for this incredible recipe!

My dad makes a very similar zucchini fritter (without the corn) and I can never get it very close to his recipe.  This is a great start to that, but I did make a few changes.  I only used 1 tablespoon of milk and a little bit of sugar, I squeezed the zucchini of most of the moisture, and I added about 2 teaspoons each of onion and garlic powder and left out the cumin.  I also added a bit of parmesean cheese and dried parsley.  Used my melon baller to put into the pan and they cooked for about 2 minutes of each side.  It made a lot, even though I cut the recipe in half. Thanks so much for the recipe!

The flavor in these fritters was wonderful.  I love the blend of the corn and zucchini together.  However, my mixture came out way too thin (even after draining the kernal corn).  I followed the recipe, so I do not know where I went wrong.  In an attempt to thicken the batter, I added a can of creamed corn.  I then fried them like pancakes.  This one is worth another try and I will work on getting the recipe thicker.

Great fun-food, but a tad more sophisticated. I served it on a bed of greens with a salsa-ranch dressing. I cut the butter in half also. The batter is a good base and can be used with all kinds of veggies and spices for different kinds of fritters.

Great easy recipe. I added some left over corned beef and cut down the sugar a bit - spot on. I'd add a bit more corn next time also. Great cold the next day if there's any left.

This is one fabulous, flavorful recipe!A couple of helpful hints- This takes a long time to prepare, so allow yourself at least 35 mins.before frying. Also,I doubled the recipe-no need , as I used less than a third for my family of 7. I froze the rest of the batter, and will let you know how it cooks up. This is worth every bit of the effort it takes to get it to the table!

I made a 1/2 batch. But kept cumin the same, and no cheese. Without the cumin x2 it really would have been dull. I also used only 1 T. sugar. I thought they were good but the rest of the family was very lukewarm about them.

We enjoyed these very much. Next time we will cut back on the sugar because they were sweeter than we like, but still, they were very tasty!

LOVED these! I made just a few adjustments to the recipe to make it a little bit healthier. We used half a cup of Parmesan cheese instead of cheddar cheese and frozen corn because fresh corn is not in season this time of year. Also i wanted to cut some calories so i used only 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour instead of 2 cups and eliminated the sugar.  i fried them in 2 tablespoons of butter and took out the 1/4 cup melted completely. they turned out excellent and everyone in my family loves them!

First time making fritters for me-- yummy with fresh Colorado corn. The recipe makes a ton though (would be good for bringing as an appetizer to a party).

Wow! These are amazing! I added a little bit of thyme, oregano and some garlic to these. A few comments suggested they needed more flavor. I put about 1/4 tsp of thyme and oregano  also about a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder (I would have used fresh but was in a hurry). They are filling but light all at the same time. They went over well.

I liked this recipe! There was a sweetness to it so that can be reduced if you desire but I like it as is. I had leftover corn from cobs cooked the night before so this was the perfect solution for them to get used. It does make a lot as is indicated. I will be making again and would add more fresh corn but this was well liked at dinner tonight! Many thanks for sharing!

The fritters came out just fine.  Followed the recipe exactly as written..  It's just that the batter dominated the corn and zucchini. Served them for company and family, and everyone enjoyed them.  So, it's a 'safe' thing to serve. But when I'm using garden fresh corn and zucchini, I expect them to be the 'star', versus the batter.  So, next time, I'll either increase the zucchini & corn ratio to the batter, or try another recipe.

This recipe is good. One of my boys like it, the other didn't. I followed some of the other suggestions and cut the sugar way back to maybe a teaspoon. I also shredded a little carrot into the batter and added extra zucchini and corn from the can. I tried a little curry also, but I think I would opt to leave that out next time. I also fried mine like pancakes. Overall they were pretty good.

Soo good. These are light and fluffy and crispy on the outside. I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and added fresh cilantro to the mix because I love cilantro. I served them with zucchini dip from another recipe on this site.  Everyone loved these, and they reheated well in the toaster oven the next day.

These fritters are delish! I omitted the zucchini and the cumin (didn't have) and only added a bit of cayenne. Fried them (peanut oil) until golden brown and finished cooking in oven. Will make again  :)

Soooo good! But I made some changes...I didn't have flour so I used Corn Bread mix, dropped the baking powder and the cumin and used egg beaters instead of whole eggs. I doubled the recipe and ended up adding extra corn bread mix to thicken it (ultimately about 6-7 cups). I switched the milk for soy milk and also added 6 mini sweet red bell peppers minced, 2 packets of red pepper (the kind you get with pizza), granulated garlic (to taste) and some cajun seasoning salt instead of plain salt (Slap Ya Mama is my favorite). They turned out very good, not spicy just flavorful. The whole family loved them (even the kiddos)!

Beware- this makes A LOT!  I made this as written and found it to be a little bland.  It definitley needed some seasoning.  There was still about 4 cups of batter left over after I made the first batch, so for the rest, I added a tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper.  They were MUCH better.

These were nice, thanks. They were very sweet though - if I make them again I will half the amount of sugar. I added extra zucchini and carrot, and still felt there was too much batter / not enough filling (they tasted a bit 'wet' or oily), so would add even more veggies next time. But overall, really yummy... just a few alterations to make!

I made these the other night, and the family loved them. My mother in law ate all the leftovers the next day. My husband actuall tried them, and even liked them, not bad for someone that detests zucchini. What a great recipe to use up extra zucchini.

Really great. I'm so sick of all my other zucchini recipes this was a great new way to do zucchini fritters - sweeter. I added a 1/4 cup of shredded parmesean and 1/2 cup more flour since the batter seemed too thin to me. My corn was fresh from the cob but very juicy, My only complaint is they really absorbed ALOT of oil.

Really good! I had a couple zucchinis to use up so I thought I'd try this recipe. The only changes I made were I used frozen corn instead of fresh, reduced the sugar to 1 tbsp, increased the cumin to 1 tsp, and omitted the cheese. They came out wonderful! I served them with sour cream. Would definitely make again!

I tried these last night and they are wonderful! I only used 2 tablespoons of butter and used canned kernel corn (what I had on hand). Next time I make them, I will cut Cumin in half (personal preference, as it seemed to overpower the taste of the zucchini).  I will also reduce sugar to 1/4 cup and milk to 1/2 cup. Great recipe that is versatile for adding your own personal touches... crab meat, veggies, different types of cheese, etc.  Thanks, Flowerdanni!

Based on some of the reviews, I only used 2 T. sugar.  I also used egg substitute for one of the eggs and Smart Balance sticks for the butter.  These turned out great, but I think they were a little bland, especially if you're serving them as a savory side dish.  This recipe makes a lot, so I'm going to experiment--I plan to double the cumin and add some onion the next time.  I am also goin got experiment with making them up and then freezing the cooked fritters.  I agree with the reviewer who commented that you could hardly taste the cheese--I even used extra sharp cheddar.  They were good as is, with syrup, but need some jazzing up if you intend to serve as a savory side.

These were great!  I did make them a bit too big so they were a bit oily in the center but I'll measure better next time when frying them.  I cut out the milk since my corn was very milky!

Very good recipie. All three of us liked them. Made these last night and have enough leftover for tonight. Very tasty, we prefer them without the ranch dressing, as it has a stronger flavor than the fritters. I will make these again. Thanks .

My other half does not like a wide variety of foods especially vegetables but this he absolutely loves!!! I freezes them, separating the layers with parchment paper. I can take out just a few or more then bake them in the oven to heat them through, they are awesome!

Did not  It add cumin as we were out -
But let me share this recipe was fantastic.  I will use less sugar next time for my family‚Äôs preference.  And perhaps add scallions.  This is super easy and really shows well.  Great for when you‚Äôre entertaining guests.

I thought these fritters were okay when I made them last night, though I didn't care so much for the cayenne pepper.  Instead of a Fresno pepper, I've used a red bell pepper. And since I was out of baking powder, I've used a few spoonfuls of baking soda instead. And as of the sauce, it was okay and too tart with the lime juice. I would make them again and hope they taste better the next time around.

This was so delicious.  I made a few changes.  I used at least 6 cups of shredded zucchini (wanted more zucchini than flour) and less than 1/4 cup of sugar.  When I grated the zucchini, I grated it on a clean kitchen towel and then folded in the sides and twisted all of the water out.  This is a keeper!

The sugar is completely unnecessary and makes them overly sweet. Could definitely use more seasoning as well.

These were "meh". We opted to do these like pancakes (in a skillet) and the flavor was ok, but the consistency was waaayyy too bread-y. If I make these again, I will cut the pancake batter in half and double the veggies.  I wanted the veggies to be barely held together by the batter. Frying them would have made no difference. Oh, someone mentioned in another review that they were even better cold.  We ate them warm with some sour cream and applesauce (like latkes) and then a couple mornings later straight out of the fridge. They're both equally as good, but cold is way less work, lol.

I am always amazed at how some people completely change ingredients and then have the nerve to send in an uncomplementary review!  Please...... if you're going to give a review, base it on the actual recipe (minor changes accepted).

This is a great recipe, the fritters turned out amazing. I read the recipe too quickly and accidentally left out the cheese. With that said when I make them again I don't think I'll add it because they were perfect!

These were alright, but I felt they were low on overall flavor.  They definitely need a dipping sauce, more corn, salt & pepper.  I added dill the second time, more corn and used a dill sauce made from yogurt and sour cream. They were better.  I also added grated parm cheese to the mix.

After reading other reviews I decided to add extra cumin as well as some chopped fresh cilantro because I had it on hand.  My husband and 5 year old both loved them with homemade veggie dip and plain.  I skipped the sugar because corn is sweet enough and didn't use the milk because my zucchini seemed quite wet.  They were excellent. My husband asked me to make them often.

Super yummy! Loved this simple recipe for corn & zucchini fritters. The only changes I made were the addition of minced red onions and red pepper that I added with the veggies. My husband loved these so much he went back for thirds! Will definitely make again and again.

This recipe is pretty good. Zucchini gets a bit lost, however. Next time I will not include sugar - they were too sweet. But with a side of tomatillo salsa, very good! For me they also needed a touch more salt.

Really different appetizer. So nice not to turn on the oven in summer. Great use of all the free zucchini friends give me.  Next time I will cut the cumin in half. Maybe add some garlic powder  and a little more salt. I think I'll try out some different dips with the leftovers today.

These came out great! I had never made anything like this before. This recipe was perfect for a first attempt. I did make a couple changes just to suit what I had on hand. I used both yellow and zucchini squash. And since I had no cheddar, I used parmesan cheese. I agree with other reviewers in that next time I'll use a bit more cumin because we love the flavor. Also I might do more than just two cups of grated squash. And add onion...you can go lots of places with this recipe! Thank you for submitting.

I thought there were very good. Little bland-needs more something-but I would definitely make again.  Problem is I halved at and it made lots! My son, who is 9, didn't like I think but he is a picky eater.  Nice and light and crispy.  Other reviews said they were doughy--I think that may have come from making them too big and not cooking long enough.  I used 1/4 cup scoop, and didn't make them 1/4 cup large. Fry till they are more brown than golden.  Next time I'll take another reviewers idea and add onion or even garlic, maybe a little more cheese.

Very good toasted.

Made it w/o cheese, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Loved it!  The 4 year-old spit it out at first, but that was after dipping in ranch dressing as suggested. Tried it without, and she loved them !

Great flavor!  The cumin, really makes the fritter.  Only 4 stars due to the greasiness.  It's like eating a 'healthy' funnel cake...if such a thing existed ; )

These are pretty good, but nothing to jump up and down about. I am not a fan of ranch, so I just had these with sour cream, and it definitely needed something else. Will try these with a different dip next time. Also made WAY too many. Will have to cut recipe in half next time.

very nice and fluffy fritter recipe with a nice crispy outer bite.  however am giving it 4 stars because i put in less than half the sugar and it was still sweet enough, so i know half a cup sugar would be making it a dessert!   also did some mediterranean changes...added some hot pepper, dried mint, more cumin, some allspice, onion, and garlic and a little more cheese.  we ate these with yogurt and they were AWESOME! but be sure to cut the sugar at least by half!!

Very good.  Served with Ken's ranch and I thought they were excellent.  My family, however, didn't much care for them.

Made these for the family and they were a huge hit!  I added only a sprinkle of sugar rather than a 1/2 cup as the recipe calls for.  This does make quite a bit of batter =)

These were extremely quick and easy to make and ultra crispy-delicious!    We found them a little too sweet so next time we will cut the sugar in half and maybe try a little hot sauce in the mix!

I halved the recipe and this still made a ton.  My SO liked them because they were fried.  I thought they were okay.  The zucchini adds zero flavor to these.  All I tasted was corn and cumin.

I LOVED this recipe, but as many have done, I changed things up a bit.  I don't really like corn, so I didn't use any.  I doubled the zucchini, only used 1 tsp. of sugar, didn't put the butter in the mix, and instead of using cumin, I used Curry powder.  It gave it a wonderful flavor!  I also felt it needed a sauce, so I whipped up some mayo, sour cream and grey poupon mustard.  Delish!  Oh, they were pretty darn greasy, as well.  I did my best to sop it up with paper towels. But they were still a nice treat.

These were really fantastic! Make sure to not make the balls too big. A few of mine were on the large size and the center was a little doughy. They would be great to serve with Chili or any backyard cookout!

We love these!  I also like that these are a sneaky way to get my toddler to eat some veggies and a great finger food.  I usually serve them with bbq chicken.  I've added other veggies to them before as well (shredded carrots work well).  They also freeze well for later use - good to know because this makes a big batch!  No need to add cheese or dip them in ranch.  They are tasty as is.  You really should try making these.  You won't regret it!

Scaling the recipe to use the amounts of corn and zucchini I had to work with the recipe called for one and a half eggs, I used two eggs and omitted the milk.  Also left out the butter.  The recipe called for a quarter cup of sugar, I used a scant quarter cup, they were a bit sweet but I over salt everything so it worked for me.  I added a teaspoon of minced garlic chives, a heaping tablespoon would have been better but my plants are still small.  Was planning on grating cheddar over them as they came out of the pan but forgot about it as I was too busy enjoying them!

These are SO good. I made a few changes to the recipe and everyone loved them. I only added a tablespoon or so of sugar, because a half cup sounded like way too much and I wasn't going for a sweet taste anyway. I also left out the cheese, used  canned corn instead of fresh and added a couple of handfuls of baby spinach, chopped into small pieces.

The taste was great.  My mom loves them!  But I can't get them to stop sticking/burning to the pan.  I figure that's either because I'm using a steel pan or because I'm having to use gluten-free flour.  Either way, they still taste great.

Very tasty! I modified it by using broccoli instead of zucchini and half and half instead of milk. Quite yummy but FATTENING!

I tried these and they were okay but way too sweet for us. I would leave the sugar out and less baking powder and add more spices. I will try them again with the changes.

We all loved these.  I don't think you need the cheese, though; we could hardly taste it.  My husband and picky 11 year old daughter both loved them.

I tried the revised version from up top and did 2 egg whites.  Tasted pretty good, but overall I don't think it is worth making again... only made it to get rid of some old cooked corn and old zucchini.
