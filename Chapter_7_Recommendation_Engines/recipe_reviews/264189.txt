I added 1 extra crushed oreo cookie into the batter, made a half recipe and ended up with 8 cakes. I garnished them with fresh whipped cream and cookie crumbles on top. Great for individual servings.

Big hit in my house. I crushed the cookies with a little melted butter for the crust rather than a whole cookie. Great recipe and freezes well.
