OMG, the flavor of this pie is out of this world. I told my husband that it was like the sky opened up and angels brought it down to earth. YES, it was THAT good. The only changes I made were adding two dashes of cinnamon and substituting the tapioca for flour, as I didn't have any tapioca on hand. Also, my peaches were very juicy so next time I'll add more flour so it won't come out so runny. My fault though, no reflection on the recipe.  

The only thing thing bad I could say about this pie is that I haven't made it sooner. Thank you.

I made this today and it turned out pretty good. I would watch the amount of sugar you use if the fruit is fairly sweet. I only used a 1/2 cup of sugar and doubled the tapioca. The peaches were pretty juicy and using fresh blueberries too. I was happy with the way it turned out. I would make it again.

This is an absolutely great use of fruit!  I love blueberries, and am quite a critic of anything with them in there.  The two fruits complement each other very well.  While I usually enjoy warm pie, this one is much better cool.  Because of the other review, I sprinkled cinnamon on the crust, but I think I'd have loved it with or without.  The texture was good, with a perfect amount of tapioca to keep all the juice from running out when you cut a piece, but not so much that it was like jello.  I used the entire egg yolk on the crust, which made it a very pretty color.

Made exactly as written and came out extremely runny but delicious.  We joked and just said to pretend it's a cobbler not a pie.  I would definitely make again but I'd add cornstarch like the other reviews suggested

This was absolutely delicious, although a bit too runny. I followed the recipe exactly plus added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the mixture. My husband loved it and so did my friends.  I will try again and instead of tapioca use flour or cornstarch because the juices were really too runny.

Me and my boys went to the farm stand got fresh peaches and blueberries.  Came home and made this pie. It was excellent!  I substituted corn starch & flour for the tapioca and it was just right!  I also added a pinch of cinnamon.

The only change I made was substituting corn starch for tapioca just because I didn't have the tapioca.  This is a simple recipe, no special ingredients required and the outcome is delicious.  Tastes like summer.    I doubled up on the corn starch.

Didn't have tapioca so substituted corn starch with good results. Brother in law is happy.
