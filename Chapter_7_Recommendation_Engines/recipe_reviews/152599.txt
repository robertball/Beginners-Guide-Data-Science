Nice dessert-- added a little more instant coffee mix to make it taste more coffee like.. i was craving a dessert- wanted something easy with something i had in my  pantry.. so i made this for me and my SO.. the low fat part to this is also a plus! esp if ur craving dessert! would also be a nice light dessert if ur having a small get together with friends!

This was so easy and delicious. Would definitely recommend more coffee than the 2 teaspoons it says. Since I love coffee, I added quite a bit and it was wonderful!

This was pretty good. I love coffee  flavored desserts, so this was perfect for me. You won't like it if you don't like coffee though.

good, I used lg box of pudding and over 1 tbs of instant coffee, for my taste I should have used less coffee.
