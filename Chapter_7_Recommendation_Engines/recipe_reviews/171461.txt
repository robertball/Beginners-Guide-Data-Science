This was a pretty good marinade.  I think the longer you marinate, the better.  I used this on boneless chicken breasts, put everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate for 4 hours.  Next time I would let it go longer.  The honey gave it a nice sweetness and it wasn't overly spicy.

Very good, I followed recipe except I baked it instead of grilling it. Baked at 350 for 40 minutes on a broiler pan, then switched it to a shallow dish and poured extra sauce over it( I made two seperate batches of the marinade). I used more chipotle peppers than just three ( the whole can between the two batches of sauce that I made) because I love Spicy. I was very happy with the way the chicken turned out!!! Thank you!!!

At first, I thought this gonna be hot! I was wrong, it is just right. Not if the 3 chipotle peppers weren't enough....1/4 teaspoon of cayenne! I tried it anyway... Perfect heat in the background that you know it is there. I usually look at a recipe and change it. The only thing I changed was the chicken. I used skin-on-thighs and marinated overnight. I cooked indirect with a pecan chunk for a little smoke, for 1hr 15 minutes at about 350 degrees.  Very good marinade for sure. Even for the people that don't like "spicy" food, this a great recipe!      I will be doing this one again!

Hey all, this is my recipe.  Thanks for the compliments.  To clarify, this was intended for whole legs, not drubsticks, that's why it makes so much marinade.  But of course, you can use it on anything.  You'd probably be safe halving everything though if you're cooking for 4.  Making tonight for company :)

Nom nom nom! Really good! I was expecting this to have more of a kick due to the ample addition of chipotle peppers and cayenne, but maybe most of that peppery punch cooked off on the grill. (Imagine my surprise to see my pre-schooler nibbling away at her's, blissfully unaware of the kick that Mommy had caressed her chicken with.) What remained was a flavorful, tender piece of chicken, excellent served alongside "G-ma's Rice" recipe from here. The only difference that I did was using boneless breasts instead of drumsticks, and bottled lime juice (I know! I would much rather of squeezed fresh, but it's all that I had on hand!), but this was an absolutely delicious marinade that I am anxious to try again.

This was really good.  I used boneless skinless breasts & I also added just a little more honey to the marinade but those were the only changes.  I also sauteed some zuchinni and red peppers and finished them with a raspberry chipotle sauce (from Sam's).  I plated the veggies and then placed the chicken on top and Mmmm was it ever a flavor sensation!  Served with oven baked sweet potato fries with a chipotle sour cream sauce.  Thanks so much for sharing.

This recipe is delicious! We bbq alot so we experiment with different grill recipes, this is one that we will make frequently.There is a perfect balance of sweet and spicy with the subtle hint of honey added to the pepper marinade. It went well with a Riesling wine.

We love, love, love this recipe!  Grilling season is year round in Tucson, and we now make this at least every other week.  It works perfectly well on boneless skinless chicken breast, which is our preference.  The longer your marinate the better with this marinade, for sure.  I like at least a 12 hour marinade with it.  Is absolutely super served with grilled corn on the cob.

This is amazing, my husbands, friends, and even the kids are all addicted to this. I make a lot of marinade at once, using smoked paprika, and we use it with chicken breast for tacos every week. I can't believe it doesn't have more reviews, this is one of the best recipes I've found on this web site in the last 8 years.

A bit spicy, but all the guys LOVED it!  They were fighting over the last piece and putting the extra sauce on everything.  Will definitely be a repeat recipe in this house!

This recipe was pretty good, the combination of ingredients made for a suprisingly moist and tender chicken breast.  If I make it next time, I think I would reduce the honey by half.  It seemed a little too sweet at times, but that's just my personal preference.  Prep time of 10 minutes seems a little short; it took more like 20 minutes (probably because I'm not an expert chef).  Good taste, will try again.

This was amazing. I used 4 chipotles, lemon juice (that's all I had), cider vinegar + 4 tsp sugar for the balsamic, and 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts sliced thinly. Amazing. We will be making this again.

My husband LOVED this.  He ate 3 in one sitting.  He loves spicy flavors.  I'm not a big fan, personally, but they tasted fine.  Great flavor to go with the grill.

Loved this recipe! My husband and I made for dinner last night and can't wait to make again. I also used chicken breasts and cooked indoors on a cast iron grill pan. It was definitely spicy but we both like pretty spicy foods and thought it was great, wouldn't change a thing.

Wow, this was a crowed pleaser. I quadrupled the recipe but only used 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and it was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy. I marinated drumsticks and thighs overnight and grilled them on medium low for about 45 minutes. I will make this again!

This chicken rocks!!! I use organic chicken breasts instead but this is another family favorite. I make the marinade exactly like it says and it is always to perfection when it comes off the grill.  If you are one who doesn't like spicy food this will still probably not be too much heat for you. It's just enough heat to wake up your taste buds.  If you're worried about that just reduce the amount of red pepper. Great recipe!

I used this as a marinade for diced chicken breasts, and cooked them on my stove top and used it for fajitas! I didn't have any chipotle peppers, so I used chipotle flakes, and garlic powder rather than cloves. I cut the balsamic vinegar in half, and that was well more than enough. Awesome for chicken that's going in fajitas and quesadillas!

This recipe rocks.  I love spicy foods so I added an extra Chipotle pepper and a little more cayenne pepper.  It probably didn't need it, but it was still great.

First things first, this made a lot of marinade!  I used 9 chicken legs and there was still plenty left.  It is quite spicy but flavorful.  All in all, just got good reviews in our house, nothing outstanding.

This was so easy and delicious!  I made it with boneless chicken breasts, made the marinade as directed,.  I grilled and sliced the chicken, served with flour tortillas, chopped avocado, chopped tomato, shredded cabbage, shredded cheddar, sour cream and salsa on the side.  My whole family loved it!  I will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe but did not have Worcestershire sauce, I replaced it with teriyaki sauce and it is a fabulous marinade for chicken breasts. My family loved it!

I really like the barbecue-ish sauce here. It has a great balance of spicy, sweet and tang. I baked this at 425F instead of grilling it. Will see a repeat for sure! Thank you for an interesting twist to the usual barbecue sauce.

I loved this recipe!  Easy!  I forgot to use the reserved marinated for basting while on the grill, but we didn't miss it.  The chicken and pork chops were excellent.

This was a great recipe.  I doubled everything except the cayenne pepper and it had the perfect amount of heat.  I used BLSLCB cutlets which marinated for about 30 hours.  Very flavorful, delicious recipe!  Thanks for sharing, PhillyKev!

This was an excellent chicken recipe! So juicy and flavorful, and yet not overwhelmingly spicy. The only change I made was to reduce the cayennne pepper to 1/8 of a tsp. I am not a huge fan of hot dishes, but this came out perfect. I also marinated for two days because I was unable to cook the chicken right away. Thanks for this amazing recipe! Will be a new summer time staple for me!

I am a beef girl but, I am trying to eat more chicken.   This was a terrific recipe.  I love heat and this is spicy.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I cooked on the stove top and got a beautiful glaze as I cooked.  Can't wait to do on the BBQ.  Served with dirty beans and rice and fresh fruit.  Winner.

Very nice marinade. Made as written except used skinless boneless chicken breasts, sub lemon juice for lime juice (was out of limes) and skipped the cayenne (I'm a wuss). Liked it very much, but think the lime would be better. Also served with G-Ma's Rice at suggestion of another reviewer & they went very well together! Thanks!

I was so hoping for a killer recipe, but this one left me unsatisfied.  The ingredients looked good and I followed them to a T.  Marinated for 6 hours but found the meat to have VERY little of the flavor.  I used thighs and legs with skin.  Even with the skin half off, and exposed meat in the marinade, it just didn't get the flavor.

As always, I followed the recipe as stated except I used Wings. One may think that the Chipotle, Cayanne, and Paprika may cause too much heat, yet it was not tooooo hot. Very nice combination of sweet meets heat. Glad I made a double batch.

OMG!! This is a real keeper. My husband went wild over this marinade.  Our chicken was perfect. Just the right amount of "heat" for us Texans. Wouldn't change a thing.  Will be using this on other meats as well as the chicken. I'm thinkin' ribs - can't wait.

this was very good.  probably a little too spicy because too much black pepper was added by mistake...oops....good none the less.  i held back 1/2 of the marinade.  i will freeze for another time.  i used boneless chicken breasts.  this would probably be good on pork too.

This recipe is delicious! We just finished eating it and really enjoyed it. It is spicy, so if you prefer milder fare better stay away. We used boneless chicken thighs, which cook well on the grill and are easier to eat than legs.

I made this but skipped the blender. just whisked it all together then let it sit with the chicken for 4 hours.

the left over marinade was heated up on the stove top and used as a glaze.

apple wood chips on the grill just added to the rich smokey flavor.

Not sure why this wasn’t more successful. Actually marinated overnight so should have been even more flavorful. Was ok but not not great. I used boneless chicken breast instead. Oh well.

Amazing, best marinade I've ever made. I did not have any balsamic vinegar, so I added extra lime juice which was perfect for my mexican chicken fajitas (I used a mix of breast & thighs). I also did not put the cayenne pepper, and it was perfectly spicy from the chipotles for me. I used the extra on some pork chops and grilled them, and they were amazing too. I feel like this marinade will work on any meat! I marinated my meat both times for almost 24 hours.

Followed the recipe exactlty with good results.Nothing to wow about but it was good. Perfect amount of spiciness.Will probably make again.
