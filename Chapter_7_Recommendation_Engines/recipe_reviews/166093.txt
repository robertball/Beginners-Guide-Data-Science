This is really tasty! I used chicken breasts (4) and cooked it for about the same time as indicated in the recipe. Next time I will add the whole jar of peppers and olives and not bother measuring them out. They're delishious!

This was excellent.  I cooked this on high for 3 hours and it turned out perfect. Next time I will need to remember to pinch of the stems from the peppers-they started falling off in the cooking process.

I do not like bland food, but this recipe has too many flavors competing. The flavors of the cooked olives and peppers were not harmonious. The sauce was alright but still had an acidic taste. Also I had to add more liquid to keep my chicken from drying out.

THIS IS AN EXCELLENT LOW CAL DISH, WITHOUT THE SOUR CREAM.. I HAVE MADE IT WITH AND WITHOUT AND FOUND IT TO BE GREAT EITHER WAY.

I was a bit disappointed in this recipe; it sounded so good but just didn't quite fit the bill.  The pepperoncinis overpowered the chicken, and I've made recipes that used far more than this.  If I do make it again I will cut way back on the pepperoncinis, maybe at least half, and I may add some chunks of carrots to it for some sweetness.  I think this could be awesome with some tweaking.

wow - this one packs a lot of heat.  My hubby loved it!  I didn't count the pepperoncinis or the olives - just added them to the bottom of a casserole dish - added 3 chicken thighs(deboned and skinned) on top and poured the rest of the ingredients over all - covered and baked 350 for 30 minutes.  Now not sure what to do with the left overs on this one...

I thought this was a good dissh. Two of my neighbors loved it. I enjoyed it and it was easy to make. I used mild peps. and the next day my stomach felt a little raw. Over all it was very easy to prepare and the outcome was good.

This was awesome!! I though the flavor was perfect and it had a "kick" to it, from the pepperoncini. It deserves 5 stars because I didn't have to do anything different to tweak it, it was easy to prepare and delish! This one is a keeper.

I do not like anything spicy at all, so I removed the stem and seeds from the pepperocini, because even those are more spicy than I would normally eat.  I added about 1/2 cup chicken broth for fear of it being too dry.  In the future I would not do this, it probably wasn't needed and made the cream at the end to brothy and not creamy.  The chicken was delicious and just fell off the bone.  Will be making again!  Just trust that the chicken will turn out moist- doesn't need any more liquids!

First this recipe was sooo easy and healthy!  i threw this in the crock pot before work and everyone loved it, including the 6 year old and 8 year old.  I did use chicken breasts instead of the thigh and i just added a little chicken broth to the crock pot to add some juice so it didnt dry out! The best part was with the leftover chicken i made a mediterranean chicken salad!  yummmy> great recipe

Our family loved this recipe!  The combination of flavors was wonderful. When the meat was gone, we saved the sauce and used it to spoon over rice and grilled pork chops a few days later.  YUMMO!

Wasn't my favorite.  It was edible but a touch acidic.  The pepperocinis overpowered the dish.  Not sure how to even improve it.

This was awesome! I will make this over and over again. It was not too spicy and very flavorful. I added a cup of water at the beginning and used for chicken breast also. I still used one cup of sour cream but I put the juice in the pan and add a little flour/water to make light gravy texture?z. Served over rice!!!!

Too strong taste of the pepperoncini peppers. And I love them normally. Would probably switch them for roasted red peppers.

Very nice, and really easy! I used chicken thighs (6, but 4 or 5 would've worked fine) and used the entire jar of peppers (after removing the stems thanks to the advice of one of the other reviewers).  Oh and I forgot to buy an actual lemon for the lemon zest, so skipped that, obviously.  I thought the flavors balanced out quite well and the peppers gave it just the right amount of zip.

I substituted boneless chicken thighs, banana peppers, green olives and Greek yogurt instead of what the recipe called for. It was fabulous! I will make again! I have a four because I should have added orzo.

Only had bottle lemon juice so I used that and no zest. Cooked on low for 6 hours. It was juicy and delicious. Also didn’t add the sour cream because I forgot about it. Don’t think it needed it, but I’ll try it next time.

This was very easy - I made mine in the crock pot - and smelled delicious!  The temperature was a bit spicy for my taste but the flavor was great and I will definitely be making this one again!
