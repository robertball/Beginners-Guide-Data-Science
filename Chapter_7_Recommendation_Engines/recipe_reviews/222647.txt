This recipe is quick and easy, but the chocolate cheesecake is divine.  I also use the chocolate filling for making marble cheesecake, and have also put the sandwich cookies in a regular springform pan, added mini chocolate cookies to the filling, and baked!  I love this recipe!

These were quick, easy and yummy!  I think next time I will just crush the cookies, reserve 1/4 for the topping, and just put some in the bottom of the paper liners.  We had some friends over for dinner, and everyone loved these.  Will make again.

I'm giving 5 stars for the cheesecake part. The recipe is spot on and the cheesecake is so delicious - almost tastes like creamy fudge. To reduce carbs, I eliminate the crust part. I also usually just add whipped cream and fresh berries (whatever berry I have on hand) to keep it light and low carb.

Awesome recipe! Just wondering how some others got every single one to be the perfect size all of them even. Do you use a scooper or a spoon?

I just made this today for dinner with friends.  I am NOT a baker, so I was glad to find something that seemed so simple.  Like one of the other reviewers, I replaced half of the cream cheese with vanilla Greek yogurt, and reduced the sugar a bit so the cocoa stood out more.  The result was an instant, runaway hit.  These things are so tasty and easy to make they're a definite threat to my weight-loss plans.  Love 'em!

So easy and so yummy! This dessert is great anytime of year. I used extra dark chocolate cocoa powder.  It made 12 cupcake sized cheesecakes. I will definitely make this again!

Made exactly as written and it was a hit!  I do think I may try next time breaking up the Oreos for a crust and make 1 large cheesecake.  Edit--made another time and just put a full Oreo in the bottom of the cupcake liner and it was great.

When I got home from the store, I realized that I had only bought one package of cream cheese. So, I added a container of low-fat vanilla yogurt instead of a second package of cream cheese. I also cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. I didn't have paper liners on hand, so I just sprayed the muffin pan with nonstick spray and they came out fine. The final product turned out GREAT! I made these for my husband's birthday, and we all loved them.

Hubby loves cheesecake, so I made these for his birthday dinner. I doubled the recipe and I got 30 cupcakes out of it.Instead of the canned filling I used fresh sliced strawberries( hubby's favorite). This was by far the easiest cheesecake-type recipe that I have come across and would recommend this for anyone looking for an easy cheesecake-type dessert. I will definitely be making these again, and maybe try with half the cocoa for the next double batch to make marble cupcakes .

Om-MG! This is so good!  The cream filled sandwich cookies really set out a devourable  taste for the cream cheese.

I used the larger sized muffin tins, so I added a bit more cookie crumbs to the bottom.  I used 6 more cookies and just scraped out the middle cream so that I could crush just the cookie part.  I also had to bake them about 10 minutes longer.  They came out fabulous!  This made ten total.

Easy and delicious!  They only had double stuffed Oreos and the bottom of each was kind of hard.  I think it was probably just too much cream filling.

Made these as per the recipe and they were divine!  So yum!
Like an idiot I bought my ingredients at the Bulk Barn, thinking I did not want left over cookies or cherry pie filling.  Oreo cookies wee almost $14 for 12, so that, combined with the cream cheese and other ingredients made this recipe cost over $20.  I’d been better off buying a whole cake already made!  I will make these again but I’ll be buying at a regular grocery store.

I made these for my husband's birthday. They were amazing. The only change I made was leaving off the whipped cream. (Not a fan.) They are the perfect little individual-size portions. Perfectly chocolatey with the texture and taste of cheesecake and, of course, the cherry topping. Yummy!

The Black Forest Cheese Cakes are delicious.  The cup cake serving size is perfect.

I love that it is so easy  to make . We skip the whipped cream and cut back a bit on the sugar.  It still is very rich.  The cherry pie filling   makes for a refreshing taste.

pretty good chocolate cheese! I forewent the cupcakes, and used a 9 in pie pan, and the volume conversion went perfectly. I added a few more cookies to make sure the crust was complete. I subbed about a half cup of measurable splenda in the cheese mix. I also just skipped the crushed cookie tops. The canned pie filling was certainly a time saver, but if I made this again, I would make my own topping out of black cherries.   good simple cheesecake without too much fuss.

I really love those cheesecakes! It was so great! My modification was using berry medley instead of cherries because I don't particularly like cherries of anything except for actual real cherries. With the berry medley, it tasted really great! I will definitely be making this again and again. Highly recommend!

These were so good and the recipe is exact! I used great value brand gluten free Oreos so my daughter could eat them too and she loved them. She ate like 6. I made them for a party and I only got two total! Can't wait to make them for my husband when he gets home from deployment!

This recipe was a huge success at my book club meeting. Several of the ladies asked for a copy of the recipe. I have thought of several variations that could be used with this amazing recipe. 

 The first variation is to create a mint flavored cheesecake. Use the mint Oreo cookies and substitute mint extract for the vanilla extract. I would just use whipped topping and omit the cherries for this variation. 

When raspberries come back into season, I plan to make them again and top with fresh raspberries. For that recipe, I plan to use the Oreo Berry Cream cookies on the bottom. 

You could also use the mini Oreo cookies and prepare this dish using a mini cupcake pan. Think about ways to use the banana split Oreos or the peanut butter ones. The possibilities for this dish are endless.

I made these for my husband's birthday, since black forest cake is his favorite. He and the kids loved them! It may become a tradition for us!

Easy & fabulous! I put sweetened whipped cream on top (no cherry pie filling) & thought it was perfect. Will definitely make over & over.

Awesome.  So rich and creamy.  Whipped cream doesn't really add to flavour -- just makes them look prettier.  Also tastes good with or without cherries.  I used medium muffin liners which made 18 and cooked for 18 minutes

I would like to start off by saying that I hardly ever take the time to review a recipe.  This recipe is AMAZING!!!  The only change I made was using raspberry filling instead of cherry.  This substitution was made solely because the cherry filling was not in stock.  I can say with confidence that this dessert can be enjoyed without the whip topping.  This is a definite hit if your looking for something delicious, quick, and simple.  BRAVO!!!

We loved these! Super easy & delicious! My sister says they are the best cupcakes she's ever had & she doesn't even like cherries.
