I liked the basis for this recipe but I changed it a little bit.   1/2 pound penne 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 4 garlic cloves, minced 1 pound thick asparagus, cut into 1-inch lengths 2 cups chicken stock 2 cups (10 ounces) shelled English peas or frozen baby peas, thawed 1/4 cup heavy cream 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano- 6 oz prosciutto, cut into 1/2" pieces Reggiano cheese, plus more for serving Salt and freshly ground pepper  It came out WONDERFUL!!! Add as much cheese as you need for flavor but the prosciutto added all I needed!

this recipe gets five stars from me because it was 1. delicious & 2. my boyfriend made it for me for valentine's day. normally, he sticks to the grilling of things and on special occasion, an old family recipe for lasagna. the fact that he was able to put this together really impressed me. i think he did grill the chicken and the asparagus. he also paired the dinner with the strawberry and avocado salad found here (except he used raspberries instead).

Delicious and so easy to make. I used shells instead of penne because I liked the way it looked in the photo. I cooked the pasta for 5 minutes before adding the veggies because I knew the pasta would never be done in 5 minuets. It worked out well that way. I also had to use blue cheese because both grocery stores by me are lame and had no gorgonzola. I will definitely make this again.

The good: the combo of sauce, peas, asparagus is excellent! Perfect pickings from a pantry/fridge raid

The bad: not feeling the gorgonzola. I had some leftover from another recipe that called for melted gorgonzola, so getting it in crumbled form the flavor was a bit overpowering. I'm not enough of a cheese snob to know of a good substitute (yet)

The suggestions: refridgerate the asparagus and mix them in cold. The pop of cold with everything else cold provides a good contrast. Also mixed chives into the sauce which added a nice flavor. 

Will make again, but not with the gorgonzola

This is a blended rating as I loved the dish and my husband was unmoved. He felt the gorgonzola did not complement the flavor of the asparagus. I'd give it a 4 star rating.

It was pretty good the first time I made it, but a little strong on the Gorgonzola. The second time I added more of everything else and it was excellent. This recipe is quick and simple to make and easy to adjust to your individual taste.

This was incredible.  We had a tiny bit left over and family was fighting over it! When I made it it wasn't till the end I realized I did not have any heavy cream!   So in desperation at all the smiling faces watching me from the dining room I used low fat cottage cheese.  I was a winner.  I am looking forward to trying it with the heavy cream.  I later told my husband whom said he liked it even more knowing it was low fat!

my husband and i couldn't even eat it. The Gorgonzola cheese was WAY WAY too much. I hadn't yet read all the other reviews that add something other then Gorgonzola cheese before i made this. Why in the world do people rate something 5 stars when the realize the recipe has to be seriously altered to make it edible?

I loved this recipe but changed it a bit. I didn't add the peas because I already had everything else around the house except that. I also discovered I wasn't as big a fan of Gorgonzola as I thought. But other than that, this was great!

Absolutely amazing.  I couldn't find gorgonzola cheese in my UK grocery store - so I just grated up a block of cheddar.  I doubled the recipe to be sure to have leftovers.  My husband and I both love asparagus and the next time I make it, I will definitely add more.  I added some baked cubed chicken, too.  The dish was even excellent reheated for the next two days (doubling the recipe gave us 6 servings).  Simply delicious.

I thought this recipe was good, and I'd probably make it again, but I'll share some changes I made I thought really improved it.  I thought the gorgonzola plus the heavy whipping cream would be a little much.  So I used 2 oz. of gorgonzola, 2 oz of parmesan, and a 1/3 cup of soy creamer.  It was not as rich and heavy, plus I'm sure it was much healthier.  If I make this again, I'd add the asparagus and peas with 4-5 minutes left.  The penne needed about 7-8 minutes to cook and the vegetables were a little overdone.  All in all, it was a very good recipe!

Made this last night and loved the flavor the Gorgonzola cheese gave the sauce.  My only advice would be not to cook the asparagus with the pasta unless you are using fresh pasta.

This was very creamy and very tasty. We really loved it. We thought it would go great with diced chicken even. We ate it both warm and cold -- both ways were very good.

Very good recipe.  Really quick and easy to make.  I'll use mushrooms instead of peas next time as we don't like peas that much.  We loved the bite of the gorgonzola cheese...nice but not too strong! :)

Really quick, easy and tasty recipe!  I added grape tomatoes, mushrooms and grilled chicken to make it a meal.  One note of caution, at least in my case, the gorgonzola I bought was rather salty so make sure to taste before adding additional salt.  But other than that, I completely recommend this recipe. :)

I don't usually rate recipes as I don't usually find the need to. This recipe was something that got my interest from the start. The recipe seemed simple and didn't demand many ingredients or too much time. The result was marvelous. I made it for my mother's birthday and it was the biggest hit of the night. Guests could not get enough! This recipe gets 5 stars, no questions asked. I highly recommend this recipe and wouldn't adjust anything. My mom made it again a couple of nights later and it didn't taste bland like most dishes do the second time around. I'm making it again tonight and am very glad to have discovered this! Thanks for sharing!

I like the idea but think next time I will leave out the gorgonzola and just mix in locatelli cheese.  My family wasn't crazy about it, but thanks for the idea.  I'm always looking for something different.
