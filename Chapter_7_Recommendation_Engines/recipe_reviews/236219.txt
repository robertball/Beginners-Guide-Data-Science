This is great, but I tried a similar concoction once. Vodka with cherry metholyptus cough drops. 
Put it this way, cough be GONE. Not advised.

Made this as written using 80 proof Burnett's  vodka.  Let it sit for about 4 hours and then filtered, bottled and stored in the fridge.  Excellent and will definitely make again....maybe holiday gifts!

Loved this! Used tequila (had some extra) instead of vodka.  I didn't make it for gifts, wanted to try it out first.  In the morning, I just put everything in a covered container and shook  container  every so often.  Then stirred the last few candies that hadn't dissolved, by evening it was ready to enjoy.  Tasted like fireballs.  Thank your friends for giving you this recipe

I used a spice grinder (half at a time) and a cup with a lid on it to mix (shaken, not stirred). I love making my own concoctions with vodka, rum or whisky and this is a fine recipe that I'll add to my collection.  Great idea!

A delightful flavored vodka, but not sure the sugar content is high enough to categorize it as a liqueur.
