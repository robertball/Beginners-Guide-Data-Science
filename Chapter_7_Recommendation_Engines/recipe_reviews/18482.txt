This is a great recipe but if you are scared of the bacteria here is a simple solution.  I did my research and found that the bacteria lives more in the yolk and is not as likely to live in the white.  Wisk the yolks and the condensed milk over a very low heat stirring constantly till it reaches 140-160 degrees.  You must have the liquid of the milk in with the yolks or it will coagulate and produce scrabmled eggs.  Keep stirring occasionally till cooled and follow the rest of the recipe.  It takes a little longer but is just as good.  I have 2 small children and I am pregnant so it worked for me.

Not nearly as thick as it should be. I grew up drinking egg nog that was so thick and fluffy - yet creamy (mmm!) - that you really don't "drink" it. The difference is that you don't put milk in the thick kind at all. Instead, subsitute a pint of whipping cream (whipped), and fold it in with the yolks, rum, & sugar, then carefully fold in the egg whites. It's sooo much better! (Note: If you go with the modified recipe, you use 6 eggs and not just 4).

Wow - I had to make egg nog from scratch this year since I was overseas for Christmas.  But this recipe was perfect!  Everyone loved it and I'll definitely be making it again.  I added a little extra rum and found that really enhanced up the flavour.  The left-overs kept well in the fridge too.

This eggnog is pretty good.  I'm still searching for the perfect eggnog but this is a good start.  Here are some tips:

- Use pasteurized-in-shell eggs.  You can buy them by the dozen.  They're found with the regular eggs.  I use them when I make ice cream as well.

- 5 oz of sweetened condensed milk is a little confusing.  The store I was at sells 5 oz cans of evaporated milk, which may explain why some people complained the recipe was not sweet at all.  Also, sweetened condensed milk is sold by weight, so a 14 oz can of it doesn't have anywhere near 14 oz of liquid.  I took the recipe as calling for 5 oz liquid (more than half the can) and it still could use a little more sweetening.

- When separating your eggs, remember the tiniest bit of yolk in your whites will keep them from getting stiff.

This recipe is good enough to bring to my in-laws for the family gathering, but for that batch I'm going to throw in some heavy cream.  It's still not quite rich enough.  For my trial batch I did mix in a little cinnamon, and I think I'll also throw in some allspice into the next batch.

All in all a good recipe.  Flexible enough to play with and still end up with something drinkable.

This is the best eggnog I ever tasted! It is great with or without alcohol. I also added a bit more sugar and rum. I think it is the sweetened condensed milk that makes this so good. I have tried other recipes in the past and this one by far outdoes them all!

This was excellent!  I made it the night before my morning cookie exchange and had the rum available on the side.  Best not to make it too far ahead, though, as it "settles."  Still tasted good, but it separated overnight and had to be remixed before serving.  (Next time I'll make it in the morning)

This recipe is simple and does provide a good egg nog.  It is sweet and if rum extract is used I can see it easily appealing to all ages as it more like a dessert.  But for what I was looking for I needed to make a few modifications and then it became an excellent egg nog. I substituted half of the milk for whipping cream.  Whipped the cream by hand the old fashion way.  After adding half the milk the recipe called for I folded in the whipped cream and the stiffened egg whites.  That gave it just the right thickness, texture, and consistency I wanted.  Of course the ratio of whipping cream vs milk can be modified to one's preference.  Additionally I doubled the dark rum and added a splash of Brandy for good measure.  That did the trick.  The one fluid ounce of rum the recipe called for just wasn't enough in my opinion.  The end result was simply an amazing egg nog that was a big hit.  This is a calorie and saturated fat bomb by the way, but if you are considering making egg nog I suspect you are like me and that not really a dissuading factor.

This eggnog is tasty but it lacks the thickness usually associated with the beverage.

I gave this 4 stars because it's a great base for egg nog.  I made the 1st batch per the instructions and on the 2nd batch made some mods that I thought made it better.  The original seemed a little too thin and didn't have enough spice flavor with just the garnish, so I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the yolk mixture.  I also substituted 1/2 c of milk with half and half.  This made it a little thicker.  I added 1 tsp rum extract with the vanilla instead of using real rum in the end and I used pasturized eggs to avoid any bacteria issues.  All in all, great recipe. Will use again!

This is the first time I have ever made eggnog from scratch. This recipe made it so simple and it was really great. I did add a lot more sugar and used coconut flavored rum. It was a real treat.

I modified this recipe slightly as I wanted some egg nog but didn't want to use the uncooked-egg recipe I usually use so my three-year old could have some. I used 5 eggs, half a 14-ounce can of sweetened condensed milk, no sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 4 cups of milk, maybe ½ or 3/4 tsp rum extract, and a sprinkle of nutmeg into the batch. I cooked the yolks with the sweetened condensed milk over low heat as recommended by previous reviewers. It took maybe 10 minutes or so, constantly stirring. Once it got pretty thick, I removed it from the heat and let it cool. Then I mixed the yolk mixture with the rest of the ingredients (except the egg whites) in the blender. I used a stand mixture to beat the whites until stiff peaks formed, and then I gently folded and stirred the whites into the milk mixture. I put it in a pitcher in the fridge for a few hours to chill, and gave it a good stir before serving. It's not quite as thick as the store-bought stuff, but it's a lot less fattening too! And to the previous reviewer, there is a BIG difference between sweetened condensed milk and evaporated milk!! Did you use the right one?

I used this recipe as a base, and made my own changes.  It turned out great, better than the store-bought my husband loves.  Modifications:  6 eggs, 7.5 c milk, no sugar, 2 cans (10 oz each), 2 t vanilla, 4 t rum extract, 2 t nutmeg, 1 t allspice.  I beat the whites separately, and cooked all the rest together until almost ready, then added the whites.  Since I'm nursing, I wanted a safer recipe and this worked well.

Super easy recipie and really good.!! I did make some changes the second time I made it. 1) add a whole can of SCM (14 oz) for a sweeter flavor. 2) spice it up with cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice, mix it in to the Nog. I also did what one other person said and cooked the egg yoks with the SCM to make sure there was no bactiera. Little kids were going to drink this so I want to be sure.

Awesome Egg Nog, will be make this alot more!!!

This is so delicious! I was a little afraid of the bacteria in the raw egg so I stirred the egg yolk and condensed milk in a large pot over the stove on a low temperature constantly until it reached a temperature of a little less than 130 F. I takes a little extra time but is worth it to avoid salmonella! After i stirred and heated that, i added the sugar, vanilla extract and milk right into the big pot. Then i mixed it unil it was nice and consistant looking. Then I beat the egg whites until they were kind of foamy. i added those in and stirred them also. Then all I needed to do was poor it into a glass and top it with some nut meg. I am fourtteen years old and I did this all by myself. It is incredibly easy if you have the proper utensils, ingrediants, and a little patience!

My tastebuds weren't jumping for joy with this recipe.  The flavor was quite good but the consistancy was off.  The beaten egg whites made it frothy instead of creamy and it separates quickly.  You end up drinking a thin flavorful liguid with a bunch of foam left in the glass when your finished.
I'm still looking for a recipe that has a heavy cream in it and is a smooth, thick egg nog.

The recipe is brilliant! and thanks to Shannonmarie's additional tip about cooking the yolks apart from the rest made it possible for all to enjoy! THIS IS NOT LIKE THE STORE BOUGHT! And I think that that is what makes it great! It's natural, and you can customise the recipe to you and your guests' taste! Thank you Sara!!!

This is SUCH a fantastic recipe!  I made it EXACTLY as written-- as long as you count that I used a regular sized (16oz) can of condensed milk.  I've never seen 5oz.  Totally delicious- thank you SO much for sharing!  This is a new tradition!

Yummy, me and two of my children loved this. I took the tip of heating up the egg yolk in the milk and it made me feel more comfortable about serving it. I am planning to make this again on Christmas Eve and keeping this receipe for future holidays.

Very good! What attracted me to this recipe is that it uses the egg yolks and the whites.  (What would I do with 12 egg whites?)  It seemed like it made a small batch (5 servings, and only 4 eggs), so I made a double batch.  But my largest bowl wasn't big enough, so I stopped at 7 cups of milk instead of 9, which helped it stay a little thicker.  I wouldn't have wanted to add any more milk.  At first there was hardly any flavor to it, but then I realized I had forgotten to double the sugar and vanilla!  As soon as I fixed it, the taste was perfect!  It was still a little thinner than store-bought, but still very good.  (I don't drink, so I skipped the rum.)  So my advice is just use less milk -- or try whipped cream like another reviewer suggested.

Pretty Darn good!  I miss Fggnog so much.  It isn't sold here in Ireland (or at least I haven't found it) and it was something my mother always got some (store bought) eggnog when I was growing up.  This Recipe was tastey - I only had low fat milk - I think with full milk or maybe a bit of double cream or something it might make it a bit thicker.  I enjoyed it though!

I tripled the rum and STILL no one could taste it!  That's not important, though, since I'll add more next time.  What is important is that this is a FANTASTIC recipe!  It was all gone quickly at my family's Christmas party.  I'm going to make a triple batch tonight for Christmas this week.  Yummy!!

Thanksgiving 2010 update: I read reviews pertaining to the thickness of this recipe, but I don't like it super thick, so I tried halving the milk and adding 1 cup whipping cream (whipped).  I made five batches and added a few extra eggs (I think I used 23 eggs total.)  You do have to shake it vigorously before every serving, but it's worth it.  So much better, which I didn't think was possible!!  I also add nutmeg directly to the mix in addition to sprinkling it on each serving.  My entire family raved about this, but they did add extra rum to each glass!

We don't have egg nog in my country so when I decided to make it for a party I didn't know what to expect!
However it was delicious, my guests all liked it and the one who loved it the most was the one who dislikes nutmeg!
When I finally tried store bought egg nog I was amazed. It tasted just like this recipe.

I loved it,  however one of my kids didn't. It was a little sweet,  and, as previously mentioned, it will separate overnight and look unappealing.  I liked the thickness, I thought it was just right.

I made this with the adivce of Shannonmarie, and mine did not turn out as thick as store bought.  This was my first time making homemade eggnog and I would love to make it again if I knew how to obtain the "thickness" I'm looking for.  The flavor was good and I love the idea of condensed milk.  Thanks for sharing Sara.

The people I served this to do not like egg nog but liked this version because it wasn't too thick.  The recipe should say 1 14oz can of sweetened condensed milk.  Adding cinnamon and clove is a nice touch.

First time ever making egg nog and the day we drank it all, everyone requested it again.  My only problem was I beat the egg whites until stiff and it made a thick froth on top which I had to remove.  Next time I will not beat them as long.

This is very tasty, but it was so thin, not a lot of difference between this egg nog and milk. I loved that it was so easy to make and I will make it for myself again, but this is not something I would make to impress guests.

It tastes nothing like egg nog.  If you look at the recipe, it only calls for one tablespoon of sugar.  It turns out like colored milk.  We dumped it.

Great!  Unless you are worried about the uncooked eggs there is no reason you should not try this.  It tastes better than regular eggnog, and the only effort is beating the egg whites to make it nice and creamy.  Be sure to stir well so as to dissolve the sweetened condensed milk, and then you shouldn't (imo) need extra sugar.

Excellent! Went with 4 cups of milk and 1/2 cup of cream (whipped and folded in with the egg-whites), and added a 5th egg. Also added a tablespoon of whiskey to go with the rum. Came out as creamy as the store-bought stuff. Was SUPERB after a night in the fridge. Will definitely be making again next year... Hell, I'll probably make it next month.

This is the first time I tried to make my own egg nog. My professional chef sister-in-law usually makes it for Christmas when we go to her house. This year it was my turn. I chose this recipe and boy, am I glad I did! YUM! Super easy. Definitely make it again and again. No changes.

this was a very good drink it is NOT thick like the store baught egg nog but is still very tasty and much fresher tasting.  I added cinnamon which made all the difference.  Next time I will omit the rum, though it was only one once it was still strong.  Overall good base recipe.

It is certainly a good recipe, though I myself am not a big eggnog fan.  I do have to say, despite the tiny amount of alcohol in this, it is still probably not a good idea to consume this while pregnant, nursing, or to give it to small children.  Try using a tsp of Rum Extract instead to get the flavor right.

This was the first time I ever tasted, let alone made, eggnog. I loved it! Other first-timers and experienced eggnog drinkers liked it as well. Cruzan is my favorite brand of rum, and it seemed to work just fine.

Great flavor, just a little thinner than I am used to. Maybe do some experimenting. Thanks

The egg nog is kind of thin, I would recomend going with a 14 oz can of condensed milk.  I couldn't even find a 5 oz can in the store anyways.  Other than that it's a good recipe. Oh I looked on the FDA website, and if you buy eggs that are *PASTURIZED* (it will be marked on the carton), they have been treated for bacteria, and are ok to eat raw.

I don't really like egg nog but my husband said this recipe was really good.  Had a hard time getting it away from my three year old.  We substituted the rum for rum extract.  Used a little less than a teaspoon of the extract.

Made a double batch of this for a Christmas party and it was a huge hit! I added a little more sugar and used coconut rum (more than suggested, plus I left the bottle out so guests could add more if they wished). I'll definetely be making this next year!

my husband was so impressed with this recipe that when I asked your him to get more milk from the store so that I could make more nog, he came back with NOG and milk. He thought that I'd spruced up pre-made nog. That's how yummy it is!

Great with or without the alcohol.  I used pasteurized eggs so no worries there.   I did change the alcohol.  I did 1/2 cognac  and 1/2 dark rum instead of the 1 oz of rum.  Delicious.

Found this recipe and made it last night for hubs at his request.  He added more rum, but said he enjoyed it.  I used the fake eggs that are already pasteurized.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for Christmas and it was fabulous! My family all said it tasted better than the expensive name brand eggnog from the grocery store! I did add a little extra nutmeg to spice it up a bit more.

i love this recipe!!! its easy to make and not too thick or too thin. when my family buys eggnogg we always dillute it with roughly 1/3-1/2 amount of milk, and this recipe turns out just like this without dilluting it. i substituted the sugar for icing sugar so it blends better and mixed in the 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and added a 1/4 tsp of cinamon as well and it tastes delicious :) will definitly be making this for Christmas i

I had never made egg nog before, and this was the first recipe I stumbled upon -- it will also be the last, because I intend to keep making this year after year.  My only alteration: I replace the rum with spiced rum, and I add more of it.   But seriously, this is yummy as can be, and I made it several times last year, for different friends and family members, and they all loved it.

excellent.  I've never had egg nog before and this was great.  Wasn't as thick as my husband would like.  Use the Bacardi Gold Rum.  We used 4 oz instead of 1 as the recipe had indicated.  Also used the organic free range brown eggs, which are richer than the regular white eggs.  Will make this again.

This recipe is good but I found it needed more body;  a little on the thin side.  I added more beaten yolks to the mix until it had a nice light yellow color and was thicker.

i follow the recipie with the exception of a couple sugestion from the review section by; 1, tempering the egg yoke/sewwtend condensed milk, 2, subing 1/2 cup of milk with 1/2 cup of half and half, and cutting the rest of the milk to 3 and 1/2 cups making a total of 4 cups insted of the recomended 4 and 1/2 cups of milk, 3, 1 whole nutmeg ground fresh instede of the 1/4tsp sugested (personal preference; nutmeg is what gives eggnog is unique flavor).

This is a pretty good recipe, the best i could find yet! but at some points the egg will cook and solidify, giving a certain texture that most wouldn't appreciate. So if i could recommend, possibly straining out the cooked egg whites. It'll make a huge difference.

Great recipe! We made this several times over the holiday season and it was a hit every time! We did modify as others have, by cooking the egg whites before adding them to the mix - worked out great as long as you stir stir stir!!! :) we added a dash of cinnamon as well.

YUMMY! I made this for my Christmas party and everyone loved it! I doubled the recipe but kept the amount of rum the same as I prefer my nog to be less boozy, but left the bottle near the punch bowl so others could flavor to tasts.  Didn't have allspice, so I used whole cloves.  My friend who LOVES egg nog said it was better than store bought!

I usually make a cooked eggnog but this year I was pressed for time and decided to try this non-cooked version.  It was just ok.  I thought it was a bit too thin and could've used more spice.  The sweetness wasn't quite right either.  I think maybe sweetened condensed milk isn't the right choice.  I will go back to using the Amazingly Good Eggnog recipe on this site from now on.

It was my first time making Egg Nog and I impressed my family with this one. Instead of using bourbon I used Canadian Mist. It made for a smoother drink, but for my husband (who loves bourbon) it would have been better with Makers Mark in it.

I've never made egg nog before, but this sounded like fun. It was really good. I did the same as others and cooked the egg yolks with the sweetened condensed milk, let it cool, and then folded in the egg whites that were beaten until stiff. I tasted it right after making it, and didn't think it was good. But after it sat in the refrigerator for a couple of hours, I stirred it really good (it separates), and it tasted better. I used spiced rum on the side - a big hit. I'd probably make this again, but I'm still a little leary about the raw eggs. Make sure you don't give this to the sick, elderly or young children.

Not bad! As for the eggs, it is safest if you use free range eggs (although I mainly use store bought),wash with anitbacterial soap and rinse under warm water. Many pregnant women eat raw eggs this way, especially in smoothies.Cooking them as suggested earlier is great too. We also don't like to drink alcohol so we also used the rum extract.

Not well received by my family.  Thin as milk and just not what we were looking for.  Tried a thicker recipe from another site but still not ok. Will just go back store bought.
