Very few soups are both this easy and this delicious!  I cheated a bit by using store-bought tortilla strips and saved some additional time by using a hand mixer set on low speed to shred the chicken. This dish is likely to become a monthly regular offering in our house.

A quick and easy soup that's full of flavor. The spices are spot on. I used chili lime tortilla strips that added a depth or flavor.
