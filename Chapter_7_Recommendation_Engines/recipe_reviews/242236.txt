Good tasting cake but I too had an issue with the mango juice. I had none, juice that is. So I wound up squeezing the juice of 1 lime, adding the melted butter and omitting the rum. I didn't measure the powdered sugar, I just added a little at a time until it reached the consistency of a glaze. I liked the tartness of the glaze but I found it over powered the subtle taste of the mango. I will make this again but I will make sure that I have 2 ripe mangos, 1 for the cake and 1 for the glaze.

I had gotten amazing mangoes from Costco that I used, they were obviously in season. The cake to me didn't seem to taste much different from a regular yellow cake besides being a little more  dense from the mango. The glaze was the best part. I only used a little under 1/2 Tablespoon of rum and that was more than enough. I surprisingly wasn't so crazy about the cake but everyone who had a piece absolutely loved it and has asked me to make it again already.

Nice cake... a few issues. My mango didn't have any juice to separate for glaze, so I put it in a fine mesh strainer to get that. No big deal, but just be aware this might happen. Th big issue I had was the glaze. I was takeing this to church where kids were so I didnt know how well the small amount of rum taste would go over with them, so I subbed that with an extra T of lime juice. Problem.. this still no where near a glaze.. was a dried powder with lumps. I had no more fresh lime but did have a bottle of lime juice in the fridge.. so I started adding.. more and more to get a glaze. It was very strong flavored as  result, but when eaten with the cake was quite good. Next time I make this.. I will use less sugar and instead of all the lime juice, I'd use water or even coconut water would be nice. The adults liked this and with the tartness of my glaze I would say it was more suited for grownup tastes. For kids, watch the amount of lime juice if you need to thin this out.. which I did

I didnâ€™t have a yellow cake mix so I used a French vanilla and boy did the mango flavour pop. My brother in-law who is an Aussie liked it so much he had two huge pieces.

I used 2  mangoes for the  puree and it still tasted too much like yellow box cake mix.
