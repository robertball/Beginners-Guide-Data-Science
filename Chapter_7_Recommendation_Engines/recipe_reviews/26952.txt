These are so terrific.  Try using fresh or frozen shrimp steamed correctly instead of canned shrimp.  Then chop up the shrimp into smaller pieces. The texture comes out so much better.  Don't over cook the shrimp or they will come out chewy.  This recipe can also stand on its own without the shrimp.  The taste is still fabulous.  I think chopped celery is also a great addition.  Especially if you decide to delete the shrimp.

LOVE them!!!  I'm always on the lookout for something different, and these are wonderful.  I just about have to hide them, because if my husband finds them, they won't make it to the table.  Cut back on the number of eggs, chop the whole egg up, and it makes great egg salad.

There's alot of flavor going on in this recipe. Perhaps too much. Don't use the canned shrimp. It doesn't taste nearly as good as freshly cooked shrimp. Not really the same animal at all. Fresh shrimp are larger, so you do need to dice them a bit in order to incorporate them into the egg mixture. Don't be afraid to use other types of mustard in this if you don't care for dijon.

I made four kinds of deviled eggs and the shrimp eggs were gone 5 minutes after I set them down on the table. It was delicious.

These were good, but the filling was a little too soft. I would cut back the mayo a bit and add more as needed. The combination of lime juice and dill was a tiny bit overpowering after being refrigerated overnight.

Okay. I also made these with minced crab and it was was better as the taste was a bit sweeter. I think I still prefer plain 'ole deviled eggs though:-)

Excellant. Much more bite than regular deviled eggs. Very tasty. I did omit the shrimp  but these were a hit. Addictive once you get past the fact they are not like regular deviled eggs.

I made this for a party and they were gone within minutes.  Next time I'll make a double batch and add more hot sauce.  I used the can shrimp versus the fresh and it was good!  I will definitely make it again!

Gosh, I hate to do this but if I could I'd give this 0 stars.  I made two plates of deviled eggs for Easter, one dozen of these and a dozen of my old recipe.  Mine were gone.  I had to force people to try the others.  Now, I followed this recipe EXACTLY. We did not care for it - no flavor at all and had a really weird texture.  Won't be making again.  Sorry.

My husband would have rated this 4 stars.  I lowered the rating as I left out a major ingredient that would have changed the taste quite a bit.  I used 1/2 tsp. dried dill instead of the fresh (I guess you could experiment with the amount)and Grey Poupon deli mustard.  The recipe doesn't say what size canned shrimp to buy.  I used tiny shrimp & they got a bit mashed up when I mixed everything together.  Maybe it would be better if the shrimp just topped the eggs, like a garnish.  Anyway most importantly, I left out the hot pepper sauce.  I had leftover filling after I heaped the eggs with the mixture.  I did a taste test by mixing a little hot pepper sauce with the leftover mixture in one bowl and a little white horseradish with the mixture in another bowl.  I liked the horseradish much better.  If you leave out the hot pepper sauce, you just need to decide if you'd like the dish more deviled &, if so, what to add (more mustard or horseradish, or maybe vinegar).

These were good.  I bought shrimp already cooked and diced them as opposed to using canned shrimp.  The shrimp adds a nice subtle flavor.

Delicious!  these were a big hit at Easter dinner. Next time I'll use a lot less mayo. I used cooked frozen shrimp, thawed and pressed dry between paper towels before chopping,  dusted them with smoked paprika and topped each one with a small shrimp on a toothpick- made them look buffet table special. Plus anyone with a shrimp allergy was forewarned.  I choose this to use up some of the fresh dill from my garden, but I will be making it again for special occasions.

i think it was great. I was sad not to find fresh dill at the supermarket, but even with dried dill it was very good. I used frozen shrimps. I cooked them in butter with crushed garlic. Then I put then in the food processor to shop them small, but not mashed. I forgot to put the lime juice so at first I thought the mixture was too thick so I added cider vinegar, it turned out great.

I don't eat shrimp personally but my husband and brother-in-law said that these deviled eggs were fantastic.  I used dried dill rather than fresh and I also had a dill mustard in the fridge rather than dijon. Oh, and I could only find a 6 oz can of shrimp.  These eggs are also very attractive looking on the plate.

These are so good.  All the ingredients blend nicely.  I did wait till everything else was combined before folding in the shrimp.  That kept them from getting mashed as another reviewer had mentioned.

These are the best deviled eggs I have ever made!  The fresh dill really adds a great touch.  I will continue making this dish as it has become a family fav!

Made this for our Pre-Christmas party last night.  The guests love it!! Instead of cayenne pepper I used smoked paprika powder. I was missing green onions but went ahead with the recipe anyway. I had a handful of leftover frozen shrimp in my fridge which I added to lend the fillings a nice chewy texture. The shrimps were boiled and dumped into cold water to firm them up. My hubby loves Heinz salad dressing and begged to have it in so I added a little of that too. Definitely a party pleaser!!

Yum! The deviled-egg-lovers of the family thought they were delicious, but others didn’t care for them at all. (What do they know!?!) I thought they were a fun change from the usual. Thanks, Michele, for the great recipe!

This seemed like something different so tried it.  They were decent but not really my thing I guess.  I thought there was way too much mustard flavor that covered up everything else, and I also used to use Marzetti's to make deviled eggs and I guess I just like that kind of zip better.

I personally don't like eggs, but I made these for a brunch and my mom and sister loved them!  My eggs kind of fell apart as I sliced them in half, so I was lacking presentation, but I imagine I'll get better with practice!  Thanks!
