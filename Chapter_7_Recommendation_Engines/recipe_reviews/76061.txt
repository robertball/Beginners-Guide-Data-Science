This recipe was INCREDIBLE!  My best friend loves chai so i made the homemade chai and these cookies for christmas.  She loved them, as did I!  They resemble a gingersnap but are not as crisp, and they have a very original flavor to them that is just like chai!  The only thing i changed was not squashing the cookies with fork tongs as they looked prettier spreading out themselves, and i baked them 15 minutes.  You MUST try these cookies and the chai tea mix in this recipe!

I have a slightly different version of this recipe.  I used 2/3 cup shortening with 1/4 cup butter, light brown sugar to compliment the Chai drink powder, sweetened it with 1/2 tsp cinnamon and added 1 cup Guittard White Chips.  They come out chewy and crispy at the same time.  Hard to do.  The flavor is to die for.

How cool is this?  An allrecipes recipe within an allrecipes recipe!  I've been a fan of the chai tea mix recipe for a while now, so I was excited to try these cookies.  They are pretty good.  They are a hard cookie, but they have great flavor. My dad said they tasted like pumpkin pie in a cookie!  I think they are a lot like gingersnaps.  I highly recommend making the chai tea mix - it's a lot more economical than buying the packets.  I used an 1/8 cup measure to get walnut size and ended up with 35 cookies.

This cookie came out tasting a bit bland. It was spongy and did not mix well, I feel like it was lacking some ingredients.

I think this recipe needs some work. The batter is dry, not to dry to roll into balls though. I baked the first batch at 400 and they came out hard so I lowered the temp to 350 and that seemed to work out better. I think that this recipe needs some more liquid or less flour. One thing I did was melt some white chocolate and drizzled it over the top, not only did they look nice it tasted pretty good to. I probably wouldn't make these again, not that they are bad, but they just didn't 'WOW' me.

A big cookie hit in my house! I used an instant Chai Tea mix from my pantry. It gave it a wonderful buttery Chai flavor, very similar to gingersnaps, but chewy, not crispy. Love 'em! My son, a culinary student, said "These cookies are addicting!" 

Thanks to the review warning from Nanpie, I was prepared for my hand mixer to be overworked. My poor mixer motor started to smell like it was burning. I added a couple of tablespoons of cold water intermittently to the batter as I folded in the dry mix. Be careful not to add too much. This recipe actually yielded 5-1/2 dozen nice sized cookies.

I made this recipe tonight.  I used David Rio Giraffe Decaf powdered chai mix.  These were great!  Next time I might try a stronger chai to make them even spicier.

I love these cookies!!  My biggest addiction is Chai Tea, and I am so glad you made this recipe.  My husband also loves these.  I tried making them with Oregon Chai Tea mix.  They were great, although if anyone tries this you will have to buy two boxes.

Couldn't really taste the chai and they came out kind of salty. In later batches, I placed a few chocolate chips on each cookie to distract from the saltiness...

I think that they tasted pretty good, but I do agree with others that they are a little dry. I think they could use more liquid.

These are tasty!! I used my smallest cookie scoop and I am now swimming in chai cookies but thats not a bad thing! I thought these might be too sweet with the sugar in the chai mix but they turned out perfect. This one is a keeper!!

I like the flavor of the cookies, but they burned on the bottom and got really crunchy even though I only baked them for 8 min. They taste like gingersnaps without the molasses. Next time I will lower the oven temp and replace half the white sugar with brown sugar. I'll let you know how it turns out. :)

I followed the directions exactly like the recipe stated and it didn't turn out well at all.  You couldn't smell or taste the chai at all, and the batter looked just like flour and water with butter.  I hope to find a better recipe because chai tea is my husband's favorite.  I wish there was a better way of checking the recipes before they're posted.

My sister made these and they were awesome!  The chai flavor wasn't very prominent but they were still excellent.  They are big and chewy...just how I like this type of cookie.  I wouldn't describe them as a "butter" cookie though.

These cookies get quite hard and crunchy and are absolutely perfect for dipping in coffee or in your chai tea.  Very popular in my household.  I made the recipe as is.

I purchased chai latte mix as did some of the other reviewers.  Cookies have subtle gingersnap flavor and light crunch.  Will go very nicely with tea or coffee.  Baking for 9 minutes was perfect.  Note-dough was pretty stiff.  My poor ol' hand mixer about gave out!

Wow! This has become one of my favorite quick and easy cookie recipes. I did end up cooking them at 375 for 8 minutes as my first batch burned after 7 minutes at 400 but apparently I'm not very good at judging "walnut" size as I halved the recipe and still ended up with 36 ginger snap size cookies! They taste so much more complicated than they are, I took some over to my mom's and she loved them also, thank you  for sharing!

people keep saying how dry they are. brew the chai tea instead and add it to the mix after it has cooled. anywhere from 1/2 cup to 1 cup depending on your preference. not dry and you can really taste the chai spices!

Delicious!  I used a chai latte mix (Chamba Chai) and wasn't certain if the non-latte mix indicated was sweetened. Because of this I used only 1/3 Cup sugar.  Next time I'll try using a little more sugar and a little less baking powder, which I could taste a bit in the baked cookie.  Despite that...the texture was wonderful, a cross between peanut butter and shortbread cookies.  I only baked them for 8-9 minutes.

Great cookie for the chai enthusiast who likes crunchy to slightly chewy.  Wonderful buttery chai flavor.  Great for dipping in milk or vanilla soy milk!

These turned out well enough, and I loved how they smelled of chai, but didn't think the chai flavor came out very well.  Perhaps I'm being too picky, though.  Hubs thought they were okay.  They were easy and made  a lot of cookies, so that is good since I want them for my Christmas cookie tins.  Thanks for the recipe!

These cookies taste amazing!! I used General Foods Chai Latte mix rather than making my own -- still wonderful!!  It made more than the recipe said but they will disappear in no time.
