Very good!  I used raspberry vinegar instead of white vinegar (highly recommend it!).  Half (or even a fourth) of this recipe is plenty.  Thanks for sharing it!

This was very easy to make and tasted great.  I cut the oil in half because I like to cook light and it was fine.  I also used white wine vinegar since I was out of plain.

In a word--excellent.  Pungent is an appropriate word when describing this dressing.  I'm used to Albert's style Poppyseed dressing, a company that has it's roots in Omaha.  Albert's style is milder than this version, which is a bit wild.  Like another reviewer, I used white wine vinegar.  I highly recommend this recipe.  It's quick and easy to throw together and your family and friends will be impressed.

This was delicious.  I, too, used it on the spinach, pecan, and peach salad.  I ate it three days in a row.  I tried decreasing the sugar content, but ended up using only a bit less than the recommended amount.  The sugar is necessary.

Loved this recipe. I needed to make a salad dressing in a hurry. This was the first recipe I came to and I thought I would give it a try since I had all the ingredients on hand. Made it just as it is and my husband loved it. Most poppyseed dressings we have bought are very sweet and this one is on the slightly tangy side and not so supper sweet, which is why my husband loved it so much. I will make this again. Thanks!

Absolutely delicious! We took a salad to a dinner group tonight, and everyone loved it. A friend said she makes a very similar dressing with a tablespoon of orange juice. I might try that next time too. I followed the recipe, except I added some raspberry flavored vinegar to the vinegar measurement. The onion really adds the perfect kick to the dressing. I'll be making this regularly.

This is great!!  Very yummy on any salad.  I tossed it w/ a green salad w/ soy beans, pine nuts, orange wedges and sliced chicken.  My hubby loved it and ate it all up (when he usually grimaces when he realizes that I made salad).  This a great dressing for those who are trying to eat healthier or introduce veggies to their diet.

This is my favorite! I tried using olive oil instead of vegetable oil once, it was not as good.  Good stuff if you follow the recipe though.

We love this dressing.  We use it on the Spinach, Peaches and Pecans recipe on this website and it is our favorite salad.  Because we avoid sugar, I substituted Splenda and it was marvelous.

Cider vinegar works well.  I used demara sugar, added a teaspoon of mayo to emulsify it, and lightly toasted the poppy seeds in a skillet for a punchier flavor.  This one is a keeper!

My mom's been making this since I was a little girl. It was found in a Mennonite cookbook. She gave the recipe to me and I've been making it for several years now. It's my husband's very favorite dressing and he asks for it all the time. I always have this in the frig! Thanks for posting it! :o)

Loved this! I used about 1/4 cup chopped green onions and put them in the food processor (it did turn my dressing kind of green, but it didn't matter when I mixed it in). Instead of a cup of oil, I used 1/2 cup extra light olive oil. I used this dressing on spinach, peaches, blue cheese, and toasted pecans. Delicious!

I needed a basic recipe for Poppyseed dressing, but wanted to do something healthier than white sugar an vegetable oil, so these were my substitutes: Instead of white sugar, agave nectar. Instead of white vinegar, red wine vinegar. Omit the dry mustard. Instead of vegetable oil, extra virgin olive oil. My husband loved it.

I made this for a salad I was taking to a pot luck church picnic.  My salad called for "Mango PoppySeed dressing.  I KNEW I was not going to find it in my area, so looked up this recipe.  I made the dressing, adding a large mango to the mix before I put in blender.  It was fantastic.  I did cut back on the amount of oil, and used white wine vinegar, but other than that, made as stated.

Wonderful dressing, made this to go over a Spinach salad with Peaches and Pecans by Robin on this website. I will make this my staple poppy seed dressing from now on. Thanks Paula for the recipe.

Awesome and easy!  I made a spinach salad with mandarin oranges and candied pecans.  Went to reach for the pre-made poppyseed dressing (I like Kraft) and lo and behold--all gone!  Came over here and snagged this one.  EXCELLENT!  For the person who said it separated---it will!  Just shake before pouring on dressing!

My favorite dressing on a fruit covered green salad with nuts (toasted Walnuts or Pecans).  A little goat cheese or feta is a nice touch as well.  Super good.  One can add more sugar if they like the dressing sweeter.  And it stores in fridge for several weeks.  Can microwave it to bring up to temperature to make it easier to pour.

Fabulous!  I used Orange Muscat Champagne Vinegar from Trader Joe's, used a little more onion, and a little less olive oil.  Used on a salad of spinach, pecans, and raspberries.  I did make the mistake of halving the recipe...should have just made the whole lot of it!  Yummers!

Excellent recipe! I didn't have poppy seeds so I used chia seeds, giving it a bit of a nutritional boost. They thicken it a bit too, so if you don't want it too creamy, add a bit more vinegar. The flavours are even better the next day.

Oh, WOW! This is so delicious. Every time I've taken salad with this dressing to a potluck, everyone asks me for the recipe. They keep coming back for more salad until the bowl is empty.

I had thought I'd lost/misplaced this recipe tonight and was beside myself!  This is absolutely my "GO TO'' recipe for vinaigrette.  I make it with or without poppy seeds and tonight I harvested some fresh raspberries and used this dressing recipe for a wonderful raspberry vinaigrette.  Keep this as a staple in your recipe box!  It's a 'must' if you LOVE homemade dressings!

Pretty good recipe, I just made a couple changes. I didn't put the onion in since I'm not a fan of raw onion and used regular yellow mustard instead of dry. I also used a little less vinegar and added some mayo to give it a more creamy color. Because I didn't need to process the onions I just made the dressing in a glass shaker bottle. It worked great!

After trying a creamy poppyseed dressing on a strawberry spinach salad at a friend's house, I loved it so much that I had to try making my own! Although this dressing was a little different than the one I had tried, I liked it even better. Even the really picky eaters in my family liked this dressing! I used it on a strawberry, spinach, and pecan salad, and the taste was so simple, yet so yummy! I used dry minced onion in the recipe, as I wasn't quite sure what the grated onion that was called for was. Thanks for sharing, I will definitely make this again!

I would make this again as it really was so easy. I did make a few changes.
First use a good white vinegar and not a cheap harsh one. You may even want to try a rice vinegar to help keep the taste more mellow. I also used Grapeseed oil again, to keep the feel very light but did have to add a bit more than the recipe called for. Using the recipe as written, I found it needed twice the sugar hence my recommendation on a smoother vinegar.
I served it on an orange, Mango and Jicama salad. Wonderful and everyone loved it.

Delightful, sweet, light dressing... I added an extra tbsp of sugar because I wanted it a little sweeter, and used a 1/2 tsp dijon mustard since I was out of dry mustard. also substituted white wine vinegar to add a bit more depth. wonderful!

Excellent! At first I wasn't sure it had much flavor but after about a half an hour the flavors really came through. We enjoyed it on a spinach salad with mandarin oranges, sweet onion, and slivered almonds. Thanks for sharing :)

This was excellent. Easy to decrease the size of the recipe too -- I made it for 5 servings. Used Apple Vinegar and it was excellent. Emulsified perfectly.

Excellent-I added about 2 T more sugar after mixing just to adjust it to my personal taste but other than that followed the recipe as is. This is going to be one of my dressing staples-love that I can make it out of stuff I always have on hand.

I used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar and honey instead of sugar and it was perfect! Don't forget honey is sweeter than sugar so you don't need so much.

Loved it!  Also cut the oil in half and it tasted great.  We have made this several times now and made several variations of it depending on what we have on hand and all turned out well.  We have also made the original recipe and it was also really good.  Some variations were using onion powder in place of grated onion, olive oil in place of vegetable oil, half the oil, stevia in place of sugar, regular mustard in place of dry mustard, and omitted poppyseeds, added pepper.  It's great no matter what.  It seems like every time we go to make it we don't have everything and hand and have to substitute something.

My favorite kind of recipe - simple, easy to make, uses ingredients I already have, and tastes better than the pre-made version at a fraction of the cost.
I use my immersion blender and mix this up in a large measuring cup and then store it in a repurposed rice vinegar bottle.
  Thanks to this recipe and the one for Honey Mustard Dressing II, I haven't had to purchase pre-made salad dressing for years!

This dressing was very good on a shredded kale/brussel sprout/radicchio salad. I will make again but with some changes.  I used champagne vinegar this go round and think i'll experiment with other vinegars.  I would also use olive oil next time and a little less than recipe indicates.  Overall a good starting point and I recommend trying this one.

Sweet and tart. I made this by hand using a wire whisk, white wine vinegar, corn oil, and powdered onion instead of fresh grated. This was fantastic on my roasted peach spinach salad. I liked the onion flavor and how easy this was to adapt to only 2 servings. Thanks Paula for a wonderful salad dressing.

I made this with my cooking class (5 6-8 yr olds) and it was amazing. The student that requested this recipe said it was so much better than the store-bought version she normally eats. Next time I will cut the vinegar back 1/4 and sub lemon juice and a little lemon zest-I can't wait!

Only tried the dressing from the grocery store before, but in my neck of the woods it's not easy getting hold of "american specialties" like poppyseed dressing in the store, this stuff did the trick, it's easy to make and tasty!

Yum! I don't do raw onion at all, so I subbed onion powder. I also used 'extra smooth' EVOO instead of vegetable oil and ACV instead of white vinegar. No food processor so I just stirred the heck out of it with a fork and it worked great. I put this on field greens, strawberries, and walnuts and it was amazing. Thank you!

I was about  to buy a bottle of Poppy Seed dressing and  thought to myself - You have poppy seeds at home! I make other salad dressings but had never made this as I don't use it very often. That has changed! I use apple cider vinegar. Drizzle the oil (canola) very  slowly and it is perfect texture and taste. I love it over lightly steamed asparagus or spinach salad. Great dip for strawberries or apples.

didn't change anything, as I've never made it before - not exactly what I was looking for, but almost! a friend (restaurant owner, so of course she won't share the recipe lol) makes this for her house dressing...more of a golden color, where this one is more creamy - but the flavor is super close- I'll try a modification or two next time

Subbed Swerve (low carb sweetener) to keep it Keto. Will definitely make it again. Used it to dress a salad of kale, baby spinach, and romaine lettuce with toasted almonds, red seedless grapes, halved and canned light syrup mandarin oranges. Many great compliments on the salad. This ones a keeper, perfect balance of sweet/ tart.

Too tangy and not sweet enough. If I made it again I would reduce the vinegar in half and change the sugar to 1/2 cup rather than a 1/3 cup. I would only use it on very sweet fruit.

I did a couple changes based on other reviews and it was AWESOME.  For the vinegar, I used 1/4C white vinegar and 1/4C Cider vinegar.  Skipped the grated onion and added a half tsp of onion powder.  Blended it and it was AWESOME to supplement a prepackaged Kale Salad.  Next time I will toss their poppyseed dressing and use only this.

The only changes I made were I used half the salt and onion powder. It is terrific. Poured it over a salad made of romaine lettuce, strawberries, blueberries, mandarin oranges and pecans.

I made this to the T.  I doubled the recipe to take some to a church picnic, and  to have some at home.  I used it for the peach and spinach salad on all recipes.  It was gone from the picnic. They wiped it out.  Of course fresh peaches are in season, so it looked pretty stellar on the table.  This dressing is fabulous.  I will use it for several fruit and lettuce type salads in the future.

I cook for a pre-school, and the kids all loved this! I made a few changes to make it more kid-friendly. I used lemon juice instead of vinegar (I added a few tablespoons later to give it more zing). I didn't have mustard powder on hand to I used prepared yellow mustard (French's) instead. I also added 2 cloves of garlic and substituted Italian seasoning for poppy seeds. It has become a staff and student favorite!

The recipe is absolutely perfect with spinach, chicken, almonds, goat cheese and strawberries/blackberries.   I've also substituted Chia seeds for poppy seeds for a hit of protein.   Delicious.

Loved it! Used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil to add a subtle tropical flavor. Added a tablespoon of orange juice and it came out perfect. Light, healthy and flavorful.

This is delicious I actually did not have white vinegar so I had to use a combination of apple cider and red wine vinegar, the taste was still a bit more tangy so I added about 2 more tbs of sugar. I also added a pinch of cardamom for another dimension of flavor although I tasted it before the addition and it was still quite yummy.

Poppyseed dressings in my experience have been hit or miss. This is definitely a hit and I was happy that there was just the right amount of onion. I halved the recipe and used slightly less oil than the recipe called for as I like things a bit on the tangy side. Great recipe.

Tried it with White Wine vinegar like others suggested.  Much too vinegar-ey.  This would have been the case with white vinegar also I'm sure.  I added more sugar and a little water to make it less pungent.  Will keep looking for a copy-cat of my favorite poppyseed dressing in a bottle.

This is just the right combination of sweet and tangy.  I used prepared Beaver Hot Mustard for the dry mustard and put it on a bed of fresh spinach, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and slivered almonds.  Nice combo!

I've made this dressing a few times.  We use it on fruit or green salads or for veggie dippers.  I tend to use less salt, but that's because our family uses less salt in general.  I use a mini food processor to put it all together.  It takes just a few minutes and tastes a million times better than the bottled stuff.
