This was reallllllllyyyy good! Even just the basic recipe it's good. I threw in a little bit of garlic and some marjoram into the mix and that made it extra flavorful. I would imagine that you add just about any herb and it would not spoil it. Fantastic.

This was a great meal. I made it with salmon instead, due to the lesser cost of salmon, and I only used 3 steaks. I'll make it again. Next time I will serve this dish with Roquefort Pear Salad.

This is so good. I only had 3/4 cup red wine vinegar on hand, so used 1/4 cup regular white vinegar and it was still great. Next time I will carmelize two onions instead of just one. The onions were the best part and we all were fighting over the onions.

This is a delicious dish!  Word to the wise--you cannot divide it!  I tried and it was an utter failure.  Even if you're making one tuna steak, you must follow the full liquid measurement.  The first time I got sweet and sour candied onions and tuna.  Had to chip it off my plate.  LOL!  The second... success!

The most difficult thing about this recipe is mustering the patience to caramelize the onions.  Don't rush!  Take your time; do it right.  It makes all the difference.  That, and withstanding the pungent aroma of the red wine vinegar as you complete the recipe.

I paired mine with steamed spinach.  I was raised with spinach and vinegar (instead of butter, salt, etc.), so pouring a little sauce over my spinach was all I needed.  With that, it is a bit of a pungent overload, so you might want to have a nice, mellow starch in addition.  Simple rice pilaf might do the trick.

I'm so NOT a cook, but I think I pulled this off with aplomb (the second time).  Highly recommended.

Very good! We added more onion per the other reviews. I think next time I'll try a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce.

Very authentic and delicious. We enjoy this during the holidays and at least once every 4 weeks on a Friday, since we could not have meat on Fridays.
Many Catholics still observe the no meat on Friday rule all year long and not just during Lent.

Feast of the Seven Fishes has always been a big tradition in my family. Thank you for a great, easy recipe! I did add the sugar and vinegar together before putting in the pan just to make sure they were mixed; other than that did according to instruction. Loved it! Served with rice and asparagus.

The ingredients don't sound like it would make a great mix.
But boy was I wrong!  It taste wonderful,  I also cut back on the amount of sugar as suggested in other reviews. I also added a splash of balsamic vinegar. A keeper recipe.

This was amazing!  I used pomegranate vinegar with the sugar and onions.  I also seasoned the tuna with a little Old Bay, dill and lemon pepper seasoning.  It was delicious!  This is a keeper.

Since we like our tuna rare, the only thing I would change is to sear the tuna 1 minute per side, and then simmer them for 2 minutes tops at the end.

I made this recipe perfectly according to instructions, and the tuna was alright...but the sauce, blech.  My husband and I both disliked it's smell and taste...waaaaay too much vinegar.  Maybe half the vinegar and the sauce might actually thicken up like it says it will in the recipe.  Oh, and to properly enjoy the onions...you need a whole heck of a lot more than 1 large onion.  Make it with two or three and your onion might actually last long enough for all four servings of the tuna.  I don't think I will make this again...at least not for the sauce.  Maybe with just the onions and tuna.
