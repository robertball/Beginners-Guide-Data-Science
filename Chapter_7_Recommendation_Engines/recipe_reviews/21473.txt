This is a really nice way to make brussel sprouts.  It was fast, easy and delicious.  I did omit the butter and thought it was still good.  I will make this again.

Probably not many people like brussel sprouts but we do and this is a great lowfat, low calorie recipe if you use turkey sausage.  You could also use cabbage and some canned new potatoes for a great one dish meal.  Thanks for this great recipe.

I made this for my fiance and his roommate.  They went nuts over them.  I rated this a 5 star since it was delicious and super easy!  Also, I used left over bloody mary mix instead of the tomato-vegetable juice cocktail.

Delicious and easy!  I used a few strips of crumbled turkey bacon instead of kielbasa.  This is an excellent way to prepare brussels sprouts when fresh ones are not available.  We had this for Christmas dinner and my family loved it.

I like brussel sprouts, but this was not very good. I will not make it again.

I was pleasantly surprised at how ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS this super simple dish was!!!  I was on the fence about the veggie/tomato juice but used V8 and it turned out fantastic! I will definitely make this my go-to dish when I want something healthy, easy and delicious!!!!!

I skipped the kielbasa as we were having this with ribs. Used Rotel instead of tomato juice. Excellent.

I've tried Roasted and Dressed Up Brussels. Do you have picky family? This might change their mind about Brussels. It's good. I think you should try it.

Awesome. If only there was a sixth star.
