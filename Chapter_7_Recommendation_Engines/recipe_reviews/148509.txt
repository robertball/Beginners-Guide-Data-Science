Finally a recipe submitted using dry chickpeas instead of canned.  You have to do it right to get authentic falafel. You don't cook the chickpeas, only soak overnight and then grind, this makes a real difference in the outcome. I have made with and w/o potato, no difference.  I am not familiar with cilantro in falafel (so I didn't try it), we only use fresh parsley in the middle east,  and another teaspoon of cumin was needed for our tastes. I also use an additional 2 tablespoons of flour to help it hold together well. And all falafel here is served with a tasty tahina (sesame seed paste) sauce.  Here it goes: 1 small clove garlic, crushed with a mortar and pestle (or forget the mortar like I do and just squash it up in the bowl with the pestle)1/2 of a juicy lemon, about 1/4 cup tahina (you can find tahina in the specialty aisle) 1/4 teaspoon salt or to taste and a couple of tablespoons of room temp water.  Whisk together, adding more water if needed until it is a drizzling consistency. Drizzle over falafel or use in falafel sandwiches. Enjoy and thank you for a good recipe.

These are great and very easy.  I couldn't see where the recipe said to add the flour, so I added it when I added the baking soda.  I have used another recipe for years, but it always had a raw bean flavor which this recipe doesn't have.  I baked these instead of frying.  I dropped them from a rounded teaspoon onto a parchment lined baking pan, covered with foil and baked for 15 minutes at 350 degrees.  I then uncovered and turned them, and returned them to the oven uncovered for another 15 minutes.  Very tasty wrapped in an untraditional tortilla with sprouts and tomatoes and cucumbers and a vegan thousand island too!

Loved this!  I've been trying to make falafel like this for years with no success.  I baked mine rather than frying and it came out perfectly.  It won't be long before I can recite this recipe by heart.  Thanks very much!

This is my go-to recipe because I believe in authenticity and not using fillers like bread crumbs, eggs and the like. In the Middle East, they use parsley (not cilantro) and use dried beans soaked overnight, so that's how I make it. You can also bake these in the oven like others suggest: I preheat to 400F or 200C, oil the sheet, spoon and shape then bake 10-15 min on each side (depends on the oven). Don't be scared off by the vegan label. It's the best falafel recipe on this website, and it's the only one I use.

Maybe "vegan" in the recipe name scares people, hence so few reviews? This is easily the best falafel recipe I've ever tried. I leave out the potato and double the garlic, cilantro, cumin, and coriander. With shredded drained cucumbers mixed in plain yogurt with a little cayenne, some good chopped tomatoes, cabbage, and maybe some more fresh cilantro, oh my!!!

These falafels were phenomenal! I didn't know how much a pound of dry garbanzo beans were (I buy in bulk and don't have a food scale) so I just used two cups of dry beans. I kept everything else in the recipe the same except I added an extra teaspoon of cumin and only added one teaspoon salt, I used parsley instead of cilantro and I omitted the potato. I didn't have any flour in the house so I used cornmeal instead. I fried them up in my cast iron skillet and they were great. I tried baking some too but frying them definitely tastes better.  I also kept them in the fridge for a day and a half instead of the two hours (I was going to make them earlier but got too busy so made them the next day). The great thing about that, is that you can prepare these ahead of time and they still turn out great!  My boyfriend also loved them and said it was better than the falafel at this Lebanese restaurant we frequent! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Very good.  Needed to add more flour because it was to wet.  I think I used to large of a potato.  The taste and texture were great.  Baked instead of fried 20-30 min. at 350

I loved this - it's so cheap to make and still really delicious. 

I hate cilantro, so I used parsley per another reviewer's suggestion. The potato seemed to make the mix pretty watery, so for the first batch I felt like I added quite a bit of flour, but then I let it sit in the fridge overnight, and it seemed less watery the next day.

I served it with an improvised version of tzatziki sauce, which went really well with it.

These were so good! I used canned garbanzo beans but otherwise kept ingredients the same. I prefer to bake vs. fry for health reasons, so they were baked at 375 until golden brown, about 20 minutes. I salted some zucchini til it was soft, rinsed and dried...then wrapped the falafels with the zucchini and some tomato chutney, tastiness!

End product is pretty good but there are some major problems with the amounts of ingredients called for.  The garbanzos, potato, and onion makes a huge amount of falafel but the recipe only calls for 1 tsp. of cumin?  I quadrupled the amount of cumin and doubled most of the other spices (except the salt; it was plenty).  Also doubled the flour and added bread crumbs and it was still quite loose.  I baked though, and the end product consistency was good.  Would probably be four stars otherwise, but as is the recipe has flaws that must be addressed when making.

Wonderful!  I had only ever had falafel out of a box, and, decided (after buying 25# of garbanzo beans) to try making it  the traditional way.  My kids love it so much, and in so many ways.  I changed the recipe a little, according to the first reviewer (Noor). Also, I  liked it MUCH better without the potato.  The potato, in my opinion, made it too watery.

this one is very close to the real falafel that I used to have . I did`t add any potato , used baking powder coz I found the baking soda makes the falafel more greasy, and as my mother used to do I added parsley  (which is supposed to be the basic herb ingredient in falafel)+ cilantro + dill and I add more garlic : up to 7 cloves , 1 and some times 2 eggs(to hold the mixture and to make it fluffy), 1 tsb dried mint will make a great flavor ,some times I add green onions and I doubled the amount of cumin . if U have a meat grinder use it , I believe it makes the texture much better than the food processor. in Egypt they use peeled fava beans not garbanzo beans (but it`s hard to find in USA)and they sprinkle the falafel with sesame seeds after forming it in to balls. thanks for sharing this amazing recipe

I just made these for the first time and they are very good!  Somewhat time consuming and the fact that I had to use a tiny food processor added to the time...lol.  I did use more garlic, cilantro, and rather than AP flour I used Chick Pea flour which I think is somewhat finer and had to use about 5tbsp of it.  I made these into about 4 inche 'patties' and baked in the oven on 350.  I baked the bottom and broiled the tops, in my opinion I think the broiling gave them a much crunchier top.  Next time I may just broil both sides.  These are very tasty with the "Real Hummus" recipe from here, thanks so much for sharing!

Omitted potato, added more cumin, used parsley instead of cilantro, as it was what I had on hand. I agree with the others that this makes some of the best falafels I've ever had...even in restaurants. Also baked instead of fried, but mostly because I'm not good with frying in oil. I think the flavors came through better baked, I found the flavors of the batch I fried were lost with the heaviness created by frying, but I'm no culinary expert so take my opinion for what it's worth :-)

I really liked the concept of the recipe & will make again. For my taste it needed to be more spicy. I only used 1/2 lb.of dry garbanzos,1/2 of the potato & onion. Next time I plan on using the full amounts of spices & herbs from the recipe.I believe that it will be more to my liking. I also used more flour to hold the shape of the balls. Very good will make again.

EXCELLENT RECIPE!!! This is wonderful!! I love that it uses dry and not canned garbanzo beans.  I tried to bake them but that didn't work out as well as i hoped (maybe i did something wrong).  This is a great recipe that didn't disappoint.   I have family that is from the middle east and since they moved its been difficult to get my falafel fix.. This totally hit the spot! THANK YOU!!

fantastic! since I am gluten free, this recipe's great...I didn't even use potato or refrigerate it and it was a hit with my friends!  I added fresh parsley along w/ the cilantro and baked as per previous reviewer's recommendations.  served with 'Real Hummus' recipe found on here, rice (or pitas for the gluten-tolerant), salad and oven-roasted peppers, onions and eggplant. delicious!

I'm not sure if subbing a small sweet potato for a regular one would change anything about this recipe, but my falafels turned out really loose, even with the addition of extra flour. The flavor was good, but the ones I fried were falling apart and the ones I baked remained fairly soft, even though I baked them till they got a darkened, crisp outside.

The first falafel recipe I've tried that didn't fall apart during cooking. It's also the first one I've tried with soaked beans, not cooked. I fried these but next time will try to bake them. I think next time I'll add more parsley, but that's just my preference. I can't wait to make these again (and neither can my husband!)

LOVED THIS!!!! I left out the potato b/c I didn't have one and the cilantro b/c my husband doesn't like it but I thought it was great.  I loved the texture and didn't think it needed bread crumbs like some the other reviews.  We enjoyed these with the cucumber sauce from Sean's Falafel recipe on this site.  Thanks for the recipe Marian!!!

Fantastic recipe!  I had to fudge the herbs and spices a bit due to my poorly stocked pantry, but they still turned out great.  I also left out the potato and used olive oil instead of canola just because of personal preference.  This was a great way to feel like I was totally blowing my diet while still eating fairly nutritious food!

It's been six years since I moved away from the East coast, and have had a falafel. Loved these! They were even better than I remember. I'm vegan, but my meat eating family would choose these over a burger.

awesome! i forgot to peel the potato, i used a yukon gold. i used 8 cloves of garlic and juice of one whole lemon. it was a little too wet, so i just added a bit more flour, maybe 2 extra tablespoons. they fried up fabulous, but i don't know how they would have baked as wet as there were, but, that is my fault for winging it! YUMMY! served it with tzatziki and tahini dressings.

Completely DELISH!!! I have been searching for an authentic Falafel recipe that doesn't have bread crumbs or fillers. I finally found it. Authentic Falafels don't contain any fillers. I made this last night and my family, who aren't vegans, devoured this! This recipe is going to be a part of my monthly recipes from now on! Thanks!!!

First time I have made falafels and they were very tasty. We baked them but sprayed each with olive oil first.

I left out the potato and onion, cut the amount of garbanzo beans in half, still used the same original amount of spices, left out the cilantro because of my kids and did almond meal instead of flour and baking powder instead of baking soda. Didn't put it in the fridge as it was already time to start dinner. I really liked it, my kids not so much but they are little and still at a picky age. I made a goat cheese based dip because that was what I had on hand and it went well together. I will make it again.

I make these with the tahini-sauce from the review and the tzatziki.  EXCELLENT!!!  Next time I'll make these gluten-free by using my Bob's Red Mill gluten free flour, or some oatmeal ground up in the coffee grinder.  Makes a ton.  Next time I'll halve the recipe unless I share it with another family.

I left out the salt which is not needed with all the other spices. I put the batter in the freezer for 1 hour and then made the falafal balls about a heaping tbs. for each and slightly flattened. This kept the balls together with no problem. I panfried in about 1/4 " of oil turning the balls over after 3 to 4 minutes. Served in pita with tomatoe wedges sliced cucumers and spinach leaves sprinkled with a vinigret of wine vinager olive oil and some dry herbs. Thankyou for the recipe ,it was wonderful

These were SO good.  I left out the cilantro (because I hate cilantro) and still they were still amazing.

This recipe was a 3 and 1/2 when I baked them, but a 5 when I friend them....maybe I baked too long, because they came out dry.  Will make again, but will certainly fry.

These were beautiful and the texture was fabulous. And they didn't fall apart on me. Hurray! They were a little bland. So next time I'll add more seasonings. I served it with tahini sauce, Israeli salad and homemade pocket pita.

taste was good, but I made the mistake of baking rather than deep frying, and they did not turn out very satisfying. the processing directions for the preparation were very clear. I generally don't deep fry, so I'm afraid falafel will remain a restaurant item for me.

First time making falafel. Interesting that the key is to not cook the garbanzo beans! Loved the cilantro. Will make this again!

Tried same recipe again with Italian Parsley. Wonderful!

These are excellent. Even my carnivores loved these. I followed the recipe exactly except when it came time to roll the ball. They were too wet. Maybe my potato was too big? I added some flour until they stuck together. Maybe a half cup. I got about 50 falafel balls from the recipe. Served with pita bird, tazinki, lettuce.

This was a great recipe!  I blended mine very well in a Food Ninja and they were not as heavy as most falafel, which is what I was aiming for.  I did let the beans soak too long so I'd recommend planning ahead for a day you are sure you can do it.  I had something pop up and didn't make them until after 48 hours of soaking (I did put them in the fridge) and I ended up blotting the mixture with paper towels to remove the excess liquid so they would form a ball.  Next time I plan to once and a half the spices, as they could use more flavor (hence the missing star).  Overall I will do it again and I was pleasantly surprised how easy it was!

So...I wanted to find a vegan recipe because I absolutely love falafel but have recently gone VEGAN. As soon as it was introduced into the oil, the falafel immediately started to come apart.

I doubled the amount of cumin, substituted parsley for cilantro, and omitted the coriander. I added more flour because the mix was too moist to shape. The family loved it and I will be making it again!

Pretty good, but texture was off. I was unable to get dried garbanzo beans and used canned instead, so maybe that was a dif, or maybe I blended it wrong, so be wary. Changes: I used parsley instead of cilantro, doubled the cumin and salt, gluten-free flour, and baked it in the oven (375 degrees F, oil a baking sheet, then bake them for about 10-15 minutes on each side as other users recommended). Even with the texture (not staying firm enough), it was delish and a hit!

I had a different texture than that of the video, aside from texture, it had good flavor. I have a whole batch to fry up tomorrow. Going to try it on Pita with hummus and lettuce, tomatoes and onions and cheese. I would love to try and bake them but they wont hold a round shape due to the very soft texture. It was not "course" enough. I will try again soon! Thanks for sharing!
