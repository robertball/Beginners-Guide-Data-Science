I used this glaze on 4 boneless chops.  It made them very moist and tastey.  They were a very good sweet-hot.  Instead of grilling pineapple I made a pineapple salsa to serve with them.  Just chopped some pineapple, onion, green pepper, jalepeno pepper and tossed with lime juice, brown sugar, and ginger.  Yummy!

This recipe was outstanding.  Our entire family loved it.  I would recommend using a pineapple salsa on the side.  I doubled the basting glaze and used half on the pork chops and half on the Jasmine Rice I served.

We really enjoyed this dish!  My husband and I are big fans of spicy food and loved this.  It was a little hot for my kids, but they ate every bite.  We will make this again!

I am not a fan of pork chops and was a little skeptical of this recipe but when i made it for a group of guys we all fell in love. Wouldnt change anything. The grilled pineapple with it was awesome!!!

This was a really nice Pork Chop, very juicy and tender! The glaze was very good and added some nice mellow heat to the meat. I cooked mine on the BBQ and it turne out great! I would make this anytime.

Delicious. I followed the recipe as written. I saved some of the sauce to serve with the pork chops.

This came off the grill looking WONDERFUL - all glossy and glazed with beautiful grill marks.  Tasted delicious too.  Recipes don't get much easier than this one.  Perfect to cook on the grill when the summer temps are soaring and you don't want to heat up the kitchen.  We used some of the glaze on the pineapple too, and because my jelly was red pepper jelly, rather than green, the pineapple took on a beautiful color as well.

My husband and I thought this was delicious.  I did, however, make a few modifications.  1.  Used l tsp ground ginger powder 2. Didn't have the pepper jelly, so used mint jelly from my fridge instead with a swirl of thai garlic pepper sauce.  3.  Added some grilled red pepper.  Yum!

This was fantastic! A great change from the ordinary pork chop. The spicy and sweet tastes came together perfectly!
