I changed this recipe quite a bit. I used only 1 egg, (don't know what 2 1/3 eggs means) 1/4 cup of sugar made it sweet enough, 1/4 cup heavy cream and used firm butter for the topping. Used only 1/2 cup coconut. Thanks for this recipe though! It's very good with a few changes.

So good!  My niece who won't eat anything orange loved it.  She is 25! It is just as good leftover.  Very easy - 1 lg can of sweet potatoes comes out to 3 cups mashed.

We were served this recipe at Thanksgiving 2002... It was a welcome change from the traditional "yams & marshmallows" dish.  Very rich and filling...highly recommended!

Good, but really sweet. I made it with 3 large potatoes (a bit more than 3 cups) and used 2/3 cups white sugar and about 1/4 cup maple syrup (I love it in just about everything!) Next time, I would make less topping, about 3/4's because that made it too sweet. But I love the consistancy with the eggs and the topping is yummy with coconut and pecans! Thanks! It's a great recipe to work with :)

I made this for Thanksgiving yesterday and it was a huge hit. As everyone else said in their reviews, even people who don't like sweet potatoes liked this! I did cut down on the amount of sugar in both the potatoes and the topping because all I had were canned sweet potatoes and they were packed in a light syrup. I was afraid it was going to be too sweet. I used 1/2 c white sugar in the potatoes and 1/2 c brown sugar in the topping. It turned out perfect! This will be a staple at every Thanksgiving now - SO much better than the boring old marshmallow topped sweet potatoes!

Seriously…my mother has made a similar recipe for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s for the last 30 years—certainly a family favorite.  Very, very similar except for the top layer.    Every time my mother would make it, it'd be slightly different.  Raisins are a standard filling, however, sometimes she’ll substitute pineapple, sliced walnuts, chocolate chips, or marshmallows.    Had to come here for the recipe to surprise my family.  After tasting, we all agreed it was really close, however, there should be brown sugar instead of white sugar as well as more cinnamon and butter.  If you want to create an absolutely unforgettable dish add a graham cracker crust!

This was by far the hit of my Thanksgiving dinner.  Everyone who came said it was not just the best sweet potatoes they've ever had, but the best side dish as well.  Wonderful!!  I would recommend this recipe to anyone and will definitely make them again. (I will be out of town for Christmas and my husband has requested I make this dish before I leave so that he can enjoy it on Christmas.)  :)

fantastic! I did alter a bit. 2 eggs cause I do not know how to do 21/3 eggs and I omitted coconut/nuts from topping as my family does not care for these. I added a bit of cinnamon to sweet pot mix and also added large marshmallow toppers bout 15 min toward end of cooking time

This was very cood. The only thing I've changed it using coconut extract in place of the coconut flakes. This is more for personal texture preference than taste.

I make this every Thanksgiving.  However, I use 6 cups of sweet potatoes with the same amount of other ingredients in the potatoes.  Then I cut the amount of topping in half.  Bake in 9x13 pan for 30 minutes.  It is delicious and a lot fewer calories.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this dish for our Thanksgiving feast and it was a great hit. However, next time I will definitely cut way back on the sugar inside and a bit on the top too. This may become a regular dish on my family's table. And what is 1/3 egg? ... I increased the quantities to use 3 eggs.

This is fantastic.  I made it slightly off from the recipe, as I used a bit less brown sugar, omitted the coconut (as a friend with whom I was sharing it is allergic), and used 2 eggs instead of 2 1/3.  As a side note, the nuts I used were almonds.

I think I'll be using this as a sweet potato pie substitute. It has the same consistency as a sweet potato but less sweet. The only con that I have is that the pecan-brown sugar-butter-flour topping is too sweet for my taste. Now I love candy and sweet but the topping is just overwhelming for me, just a personal observation. Overall very good recipe. It's so 'southern like'!

I used this recipe as a Thanksgiving side dish instead of the same old sweet potato & marshmallow casserole, and it didn't last long at all. Everyone LOVED IT, myself included! I used egg substitute instead of whole eggs, and the dish still had a nice little touch of custard flavor. I also used Smart Balance margarine in the potatoes (real butter for the topping) and skim milk to cut back on the fat a little. This dish was truely a wonderful addition to our holiday meal!

So I made this for the very first time on TG(I'm not much of a cook!), everyone loved it! I wasn't sure how much 3 cups was but I boiled 6 potatoes and it was WAY to much so I did 2 pans. I of course was doing the turkey and other things and put the flour on the potato mix too...BUT it turned out fine:) will be making another one tomorrow since I have all the ingredients and we loved it(me and hubby). Thanks:)

This has been a family favorite for years and years.  I always make it with pecans and have recently started to reduce the sugar by 1/3 to 1/2 depending on the sweetness of the sweet potatoes.  No one can tell!!

I made the topping half pecans and half marshmallows for family members that don't like nuts. Everyone loved it. Next time I will try a bit less sugar, however. It was edging on too sweet for my liking.

This was really sweet and I even cut back on some of the sugar as suggested by other reviewers. I also didn't use the flaked coconut...just coconut extract. Overall, it was a hit at my family holiday gathering. Some went back for seconds! Next time, I will cut the sugar in half.

I just served this at our church easter dinner-I doubled the recipe-and switched the flour out for golden yellow cake mix--it was huge hit. Thanks!

Very good recipe but WAY too sweet, I would make it again but this time cut back on the amount of sugar in the base and also there was too much topping. I would half the topping recipe and there would still be plenty. Overall a definate keeper with a few tweeks needed.

I told my family I would bring the yams this year and then promptly set about finding a recipe to wow them.  This did the trick!  They took one bite and told me it was now required at all holiday meals.  It is a bit sweet for my taste, and I think it could easily do with 1/2 the sugar next time and be every bit as tasty.  This would also be excellent served in a pie crust.  I'll be bringing it as dessert next time as the pie didn't get touched, they went for seconds of this dish instead.  :)  Thanks for sharing it!

I've made this recipe for years and it became a family favorite from the first year I served it to my family.  I make for Easter, Thanksgiving AND Christmas.  More eggs means more light, souffle-like texture.  I was out of eggs one year, though, and made it without and it still turned out wonderfully.

Best sweet potato dish ever!!!  I made this for an early Thanksgiving celebration and it was a hit!  Super easy to make and delicious to eat!  It is so sweet that I'm making it as a pie this week for my husband's Thanksgiving celebration at work.  I didn't change anything but I can see how it would get too watery if mixed too long.  I used my electric mixer on a very low speed, basically just to blend the ingredients, not to mash the potato.  Do that by hand to avoid it being watery.  A must have for Thanksgiving!!!

I decreased the sugar to half a cup, as well as omitted the chopped nuts and coconut and used one cup of oatmeal instead. Also, I was naughty and sprinkled a few mini marshmallows on top, as you can see from the picture. It turned out wonderfully!

This recipe was very tasty! I'd recommend making it but with a few changes. I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out a little liquidy, so i put use less brown sugar in the topping. But other than that deliciousssssss!!!

This was very yummy and pretty easy to make too.  I did make a couple changes.  I added only 2 eggs and exchanged the walnuts for quick cooking oats.  I will add this to my staple recipe collection.

I followed the recipe but I think I added to much butter to the crumb mixture . It became paste-like . It was a fluffy crust on top after taking it out of the oven . Still delicious .

I have been trying to find my ex-mother-in-laws recipe from her company recipe book, and this is the closest I've found thus far, minus the coconut.  My holiday guests loved it, most people who say they don't like sweet potatoes love this recipe.  I was ordered to copy and share this recipe with the rest of the family.

followed the recipe. you can cut out half the butter( it was floating in butter ) and cut out half the sugar ( way too sweet ). if you follow this original recipe it will have way too much butter and sugar. next time I will cut the butter down to half or more and the sugar at least half.

I made this for Christmas dinner with the extended family, and I didn't have any leftovers! Everyone really enjoyed it. However, I made a lot of changes:

(#1) 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 3/4

(#2) 1/4 cup of butter
(#3) 3 egg whites
(#4) 1/2 of water instead of milk
(#5) Added extra Vanilla and added Cinnamon

For the topping:
(#1) Removed coconut flakes
(#2) used 1/3 cup of gluten free flour
(#3) 3/4 cup of brown sugar
(#4) 1/4 cup of butter
(#5) Added more vanilla and cinnamon

I feel these changes helped to cut out on the fat and sugar a little bit, leaving more as a side dish instead of a dessert. I'm sure it tasted just as delicious as the origina recipe! :-)

I made this yesterday for the first time. I didn't think MY sweet potatoes could get any better. W-E-E-E-L-L-L I was dead WRONG! This casserole was the BEST! My husband (who in 30 yrs of marriage) has NEVER liked sweet potatoes, tried this and LOVED IT!! It's just 2 of us, so I scaled it down to 4 servings. I kinda winged it with measurements, omitted the coconut (only because I didn't have any) and added a dash of cinnamon to the potatoes. Give this a try. You won't be disappointed! Thank You so much for sharing this, Ricki!

Yummy and can be made gluten free! I have a niece who is on a gluten-free diet, so I modified the recipe slightly, just deleting the flour and the coconut (ok, so coconut doesn't have gluten but I don't really like it in anything except pina coladas!).  Perfect with turkey, we're now having it with our Christmas prime rib dinner. Can't wait for it to be done...

This was great! I made one today just to see if it would be an ok dish to take to my in-laws Thanksgiving dinner. OMG, it was better than what I though it would be. It was really sweet though. I'm making another tonight to take with us tomorrow. I will cut out some of the sugar in the sweet potatoe mix as well as the topping mix! This is a keeper for us!

Fantastic! I made it for Christmas dinner last night and everyone loved it. I doubled the entire recipe. I ran out of eggs so only used 2 (rather than the 4 I should have for the doubled recipe). I subbed a bit of sour cream for the other eggs and it was great. I assumed the recipe meant 2 eggs- no idea how I'd get 1/3 of an egg! I also made a little extra of the topping and put it on a pumpkin pie- also fantastic!

This recipe was so good! I baked it exactly like it said, minus the 1/3 egg?, and had so many compliments on it! My husband, who doesn't believe sugar should be in the meal, couldn't stop saying how good it was! I'll definately be making it more often!

Coconut definitely goes well with sweet potato :o) I am a great lover of sweet potato, and this dish was wonderful. However, a bit sweet for me; less sugar next time. Thank you x

My teen aged daughters made this for Christmas dinner.  We left off the topping, since one daughter has braces and can't have nuts.  Everyone thought they were great!  Thanks!!

Great recipe.  I am not a big fan of coconut so I did omit that but it still turned out great.  I don't like the traditional brown sugar and marshmallow covered yams but using the white sugar inside and brown with the topping turned out so yummy.  I can finally have sweet potatos with Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner.  Thank you.

I make this every Thanksgiving and Christmas. There are a couple in the family that don't like sweet potatoes but love this. I use Bruce's can yams though. Just an idea if you are short on time which I always seem to be.

I took this to work for our Thanksgiving Potluck and everyone was asking for the recipe.  I used half evaporated milk and half regular milk.  I also added a little cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice to the potatoes.  It was amazing!

This was  really easy dish to make, and delicious to eat. However, I must forewarn those who make it that it is not what I think of as a soufflé, and was expecting something different.It is also  very sweet, it could be eaten as a dessert.

This was perfect! I just added a teaspoon of pie spice. You could have this as a side dish or a desert. My husband loved it warm, I loved it cold. This was a hit!
