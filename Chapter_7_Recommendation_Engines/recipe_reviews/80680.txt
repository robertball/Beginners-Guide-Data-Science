Ok, I'm not exactly sure why this recipe only has a 3 1/2 star rating because it is fantastic! I didn't have time to do dried beans in the crockpot so I used a can of white kidney beans (I had them on hand) and I used jarred cactus. I had never had cactus before and didn't know what to expect. I can tell you that I will use this recipe as a staple side dish in my home from now on...it's delicious!

My hubby loves this! His Mama has been making it for him, before me, for years! I made a pot of beans the other day and Share Bear convinced me to try the cactus. I found this recipe and went to the market and got a jar of cactus. I sauted some onions and added my beans. The cactus is vinegary and spicy. I mentioned to Carlos that they don't have a lot of flavor and he said "No they don't. That is the way they are!" I added 1/2 the jar and heated it up. Really good! The cactus by itself, tastes like pickled green  beans. I will of course make this again. Thank You Katz002.

Decent. I omitted the bacon since I didn't have any on hand, and I used jarred nopalitos because my grocer does not carry cactus leaves. If you want more spice, I would throw the jalapeno in about thirty minutes before serving. After sitting four hours in the crockpot, I couldn't even taste the jalapeno, and I didn't even remove the seeds before hand.

Okay I cheated a little bit. I had some extra cactus leftover from another recipe on this site and I stumbled across this one. I didn't have time for a slow cooker and so I brought my pintos to a boil, turned off the heat, and let soak for an hour. I drained the water and proceeded from there but all done on the stove. LOVED this recipe and I will use again. Top with extra bacon, onion, and jalapeno for additional yummy goodness.

I used this recipe for instructions on how to cook cactus leaves - they turned out great!  After they were cooked, I added them to fajita veggies: onions, garlic and zucchini.  We made "haystacks": rice, beans, fajita veggies, and salsa. Yum!

This was quick and easy.  The only change I made was adding 2 minced garlic cloves.  Thanks for the great recipe.  Served it with tortillas, sour cream and cojita cheese.

Fantastic review from family and guests. Cooked in crock pot for 8 hours and used jar of napolitos instead of fresh cactus. It was my first time using cactus and no one even knew until I told them what it was. I also put a full package of pre-cooked (crunchy) bacon and left four aside to sprinkle on top with cojita cheese, avocado, and tomatoes.

Yum!  Really nice served over rice with grated cheddar.  Will make again.  My only comment is that it took a couple more hours than projected; I used dry beans.

Cooked pintos on stovetop w homemade beef broth. Added saut√©ed Napoles at the end. Dash of chipotle in Adobo sauce. Served over rice and topped with cheese and chopped onions. Mex corn bread on the side. Really good and filling. Will be making again. Napoles are yum!

First time working with raw cactus.  Pretty easy, only stabbed myself with one thorn.  I used canned pinto beans and made this on the stove.  Will make again.

Followed the  recipe with a few changes.  Soaked the beans overnight, added a clove of minced garlic, used only one tablespoon of salt in the beans after cooking 4 hrs. Also added 2 sugar cubes.  Total cooking time was 5 hours.  Found nopales in the store diced and ready to cook per recipe.

This is good and I‚Äôm glad I tried it, but I guess this southern Virginia girl still prefers pinto beans cooked with ham (or ham hock) and onion.

I cooked the beans on the stove.  Make sure you add a good amount of water.  To the beans, I added about a tsp. of epazote.

I made it exactly as the recipe is written. My first time trying cactus. It has an unusual taste. My husband did not care for the cactus. The beans were delicious! I would make it again. I would have my daughter and son-in-law over. My son-in-law loves cactus which is why I tried the recipe. Glad to try some food outside of our usual menus.

Not  a big fan but didn't get to slow cook it due to time restraints. Too watery, cactus was tasteless, and beans were rubbery. Cooked on stove on med for 3 hrs.
