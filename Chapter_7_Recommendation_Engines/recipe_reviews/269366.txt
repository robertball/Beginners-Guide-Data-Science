Super easy and absolutely delicious! If you have kids (or any other non-spicy eaters) you will want to scale back the red pepper flakes. IMHO the sweet and heat really makes it, though. Will definitely be making this again.

Made this tonight and it was a good recipe. I would suggest to omit the salt because of the soya sauce before dredging the chicken in the flour mix . We found it too salty. I had to make quadruple sauce because I had three large cut-up chicken breasts. The only other thing is that I cooked up all the chicken then heated the sauce and mixed the chicken in the sauce.

well, I like that AllRecipes is able to ADJUST now (if you could do that before I didn't know it) for the amount of servings.  I only had 2 defrosted chicken breasts and that capability allowed me to get down to 2 breasts.  Neat.  BUT, there was no way I was going to get by on just 1 TBSP of flour, 1/2 TSP of garlic powder??,  and 1 TBSP of soy sauce!  Crazy!  But fortunately, it didn't seem to matter how much I used of all the ingredients; it actually worked!  Pretty good recipe.

It was yummy!  I substituted flour with gluten free flour mix and gluten free soy sauce.  However I used a stainless steel frying pan, added cashews, onions and colorful peppers. Loved it!

This will be a great dish next time I make it - as is, it’s way too salty for our tastes! Suggest omitting the 1 tsp salt and let the reduced sodium soy sauce add all the sodium that is needed. I Had to add other ingredients to try to eliminate the overpowering salt flavour.
