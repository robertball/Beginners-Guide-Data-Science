This turned out surprisingly good using dried garlic and basil. I omitted the salt due to using salted butter. Definitely quick and easy.

When I have some bread or any type of rolls leftover I sometimes think of making garlic bread. I'm glad that I did this time and it was a portion of a petite ciabatta bread. I scaled the recipe in half and sliced the bread in 1/2" pieces placing on a sheet pan that I lined with foil and lightly sprayed with cooking spray. I even made a special trip to the store to get the dried minced garlic. I also added a little dried parsley to the mixture. I went by another recipe on this site that I've made spreading the butter/garlic mixture on both sides baking at 375degF for about 7 min turn and then bake another 6-7 min. Excellent and thanks for the great starting point! NOTE: Not good texture 24 hrs later; best to have when just made.

Delicious! I think dried basil is pretty strong on it's own so I used Italian Seasoning which worked out great. The kids got a kick out of me cutting the bread into heart shapes. This went great with our pasta dinner! Thanks for sharing.:)

Nice idea with the basil added. Could also just spread with basil pesto.
