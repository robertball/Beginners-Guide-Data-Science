AWESOME!!!! This was very good.  My whole family enjoyed it. I just kept eating it even plain without the strawberries. It's a keeper.

This is an ABSOLUTELY wonderful recipe!  I made this for my mother-in-law who has siliac disease and after the first bite, she was like a little child eating cake.  Her comment was "I have not had this taste in over 20 years!"

I did not change a single thing with this recipe!  

I profess I am not an outstanding cook - just somebody who likes to try different recipes provided by the wonderful cooks/people like DStier who had taken the time out to share them with us.    THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!!  5++++++++++

Very easy recipe!  I had to modify since I didn't have everything on hand.  I used 2 cups of King Arthur's GF All Purpose Baking Mix rather than mix all the flours and starches together... And then I used coconut oil in place of the shortening.  VERY GOOD.  I started tasting it while it was still warm and it was hard to stop! :) I made this for my hubby's birthday cake and he loved it.

This recipe surprised me. I often avoid brown rice, but the flavor worked well with this. I did substitute potato starch for the cornstarch and it seemed to make no difference. Be aware that when you bake it it didn't hold it's shape and spread a lot. I was very concerned about how it was going to turn out and even though the shape was large and round, the consistency and taste were great!

I tried this tonight with my own gluten free flour blend that includes equal parts coconut flour, sorghum flour, tapioca flour, cornstarch and white rice flour. (2 cups total) I sprinkled nutmeg and cinnamon on top. I used almond milk instead of skim milk and coconut oil instead of vegetable shortening. It turned out perfectly and we couldn't stop eating them plain--awesome with strawberries too.

Delicious!  I thought I was going to have to give up shortcake with my gluten, but not so!  This recipe is awesome.  I used coconut oil and white rice flower, and it turned out great.  Because I cook for everyone (hubby and 4 kids), I needed everyone to buy into the GF shortcake and it was a huge hit!  Thanks for sharing!

My granddaughter has celiac and I made this especially for her on Easter. She loved it and so did all the other guests. I followed the directions, but substituted coconut flower for tapioca flower. It was simple to make and looked beautiful!

Subbed Arrowroot  for cornstarch.   Subbed Palm Shortening for vegetable shortening. 
Used whole milk instead of skim.
I added 2 T of Homemade Vanilla to it as well.
On another baking adventure. 
I Subbed Coconut Oil for vegetable shortening. 
I subbed Raw Cream for skim milk.
We have now made in twice in 2 weeks.  Nummy
I almost foot the key to cutting them in half.  I bake them in If You Care Muffin tins.  Slides right out!

The flavor was really good; however, mine came out flat and looked more like cookies. I'm not sure why they spread like they did and I have to agree with another reviewer, they were crumbly, very crumbly. Regardless of the cookie-like appearance and crumbliness we served them in a bowl topped with strawberries and whipped cream and they were gone in a flash. This was a nice treat and I will make it again despite their shape.

These had good flavor, and a decent texture when warm. There's no way you could cut them in half though, since they turned out flat as pancakes. If I make them again, I'll try chilling the batter to see if that will stop them from spreading. Once these were cooled, they were crumbly and dry. My family liked them, regardless of flaws.

I mad this using King Arthur's baking mix, it was delicious.  Even my  husband that hasn't really liked anything that I have made gluten free, loved them. I used muffin tins and muffin paper for easy baking and clean up.  Have made them twice now!!

Used quinoa and coconut flours instead of rice and tapioca. Looked like standard shortcakes. Tasted pretty close and still tasted good the next day...according to my adult daughter who needs to eat GF.
I will definitely make these again!

This is a good shortcake. It is a bit crumbly, but hey-that's what forks are for. I also left out the xanthan gum so I expected a crumb or two. Mine spread out on the baking sheet into one huge sheet cake so I used cookie cutters to make individual servings then used the crumbs to make shot glass shortcakes. :-) I put the crumbs in the bottom, then chopped strawberries and then cream sauce and layered it to the rim. Voila! A show stopping fancy dessert. I didn't use whipped topping but mixed up a rose water cream that was heavenly on the fresh strawberries and this delicate cake. Definitely add this to your gluten free dessert Top 10 list. Easy enough to make in a few minutes for a quick snack o even prepare for an "oooh" and "ahhhh" treat when friends come over. Thank you for your recipe.
