I took this basic recipe, made some variations and made it just SO YUMMY! Instead of making this as a side-dish, I decided to make it a main dish by adding a pound of ground beef. Before assembling the pie, I browned the beef, adding salt and garlic. I used only two BIG sweet onions, and steamed those before-hand to assure that they'd be cooked. When assembling the pie, I used layers: one layer of onions, then a layer of beef, then a layer of sliced Velveeta cheese, then I repeated one time. After putting the last layer of Velveete cheese, I poured about 1/4 cup of milk over top. Then, I placed the final pie crust, with slits. Even though my meat and onions were fully cooked to start with, I still baked the pie for the assigned time, to assure that I'd have fabulously melted cheese, and a thoroughly cooked crust. The end result was a delicious meat, cheese and onion pie that was SO GOOD!  Somewhat of a cheeseburger pie really. It's so good--you've just gotta try it!

I love onions so I was really excited to try this recipe, but the onions did not get done, the cheese was almost non existent. 
Any ideas on what went wrong?

I have been making cheese & onion pies for many years.Cook & mash a couple of potatoes to the onion & grated cheese mix it really holds everything together and makes the filling go further.

Very good recipe - I added more cheese.  I like the pre-made crusts as I never seem to make an acceptable pie dough :-(

I do not understand why people make/rate a recipe after they have TOTALLY changed the recipe so that its no longer the featured recipe!  Adding tons of meat and a pageful of changes to this recipe - that is no longer a cheese & onion pie!  THAT is a recipe you just put together for dinner.  Just sayin'......If you like a recipe you've made,  send it in under its own name!  PLEASE!
