These cupcakes received rave reviews from my brother's co-workers.  I'm on a low glycemic diet, so I have not actually tasted them.  They do smell fabulous.  I have wanted to make them for the longest time and am glad that they turned out like I had hoped.  They are on the rotation list now.

My changes:  I used applesauce instead of the oil.  Used chai tea in place of the black tea.  Added about 1/2 cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.

I topped the 12 standard size cupcakes with a cream cheese frosting with a dash of cinnamon and about 1T chocolate malt powder.  (I didn't measure.)

Delicious! I made it with a not-too-dark chocolate frosting, as it is already intensely chocolatey.

Lovely  moist cupcake.  Took longer to bake than I expected.  I made 12 rather than the recipe's large 6 but even at that, the 12 are quite large.  Bit of an update: these were still moist 3 days later.  Everyone very much enjoyed them.
