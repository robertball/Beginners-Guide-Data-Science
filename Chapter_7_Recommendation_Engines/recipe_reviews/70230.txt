Great - Easy recipe. Couple of tips: after filling tins with drippings or oil, heat tin in oven until very hot (5-7 mins.), then remove from oven and fill with batter. I used regular sized muffin tins, and had left over batter. Either fill up 3/4 the way (instead of half way) which worked for me, or use a large muffin size tin. :)

Terrible instructions. Following these will make it impossible for a successful pudding. NOTE!!!!! HEAT THE OIL/FAT IN THE PUD TRAY FOR APPROX 10MINS IE SO THE OIL IS SMOKING. QUICKLY REMOVE THE TRAY AND POUR THE BATTER. (IT SHOULD SPIT IN THE TRAY). NOW GET IT BACK IN THE OVEN IMMEDIATELY. DO NOT PEAK HALF WAY THRU AS THE PUDS COULD COLLAPSE. 3/4 THRU COOKING LOWER THE TEMPERATURE TO LET HEKP STOP THE BASE BEING SOGGY. Hope this helps. ps unlike others at least you remembered the salt!

Yum, these are good! I love Yorkshire pudding but this was my first time trying to make it. Turned out very nice. Instead of a 6-muffin tin, I used a 12-muffin tin (smaller muffins than the 6-pan) and had batter to fill 8 of the cups to 3/4. Also, I used bacon grease and butter instead of beef drippings (just enough to cover the bottom of the tins). I noticed the bacon grease was smoking a bit so I moved the tray to the middle rack - no problems after that. Followed the other directions exactly with no substitutions. The Yorkies rose to 2x their height and were perfectly golden and yummy. Will definitely make again! Some tips: 1) the tray needs to be very very hot! Keep it in the oven for 5-7 min as recommended. 2) make the batter and let it sit for a bit while the oven preheats. 3) fill the tins as quickly as possible and pop back in the oven.

I have watched the Martha Stewart special on comcast on demand where she makes yorkies about 10 times (no exaggeration) and I've made them before and learned from my mistakes so I have some handy tips. First, make sure to mix your batter about half hour before baking, so it isn't cold. Second, mix very well, until it is smooth, and add milk (I used half and half) just until it's a smooth consistency. I didn't need all of the milk. Third, preheat your muffin tin until it's HOT. Add just enough drippings to cover the bottom. I have a very hot oven, so I baked the yorkies for 10 minutes at 450, then 10 minutes at 350. They rose SKY HIGH, and the texture was perfect. Very light and tasty, complimented my prime rib very well.

This was a pretty good recipe but needed a bit of tweeking, which is why I gave it four stars.  I found that you needed to cook it only 10 minutes more at 350 or they got way overdone.  If you are using melted butter instead of drippings, I would reccomend omitting the salt.  Overall very tasty and easy recipe to follow.

Doubled recipe which made 12.Saved the grease from the roast for gravy.  Put 1 tsp. canola oil into each muffin tin and heated in 450 degree oven for 5 mins.  Then quickly poured in batter. Took out 5 mins early because it was really browning but I should have cooked a little longer, there were a few that were a little wet.  Overall, excellent and tasty.  Will use this recipe everytime we have roast beef.  UPDATE:  first time I have used the drippings from the roast and I tried using the convection setting for the oven and the yorkshires were the highest and the best ever!!!  Was it the drippings or the convection method that made then rise higher?? Also cooked way faster this way.  18mins or so. Update:cooked them on lowest rack setting, down with 8 mins left and nice and crispy!!
Thanks, Michele, Cambridge, Ontario

Excellent. I didn't have any beef drippings (I've never cooked a roast big enough to get a whole cup from!) but butter worked just as well!

it defintly smells good and tasted good too, however its too oily.. i don't have beef drippings, so i used regular vegetable oil, but its too oily when it done..  i would suggest place about 1 teaspoon of beef drippings or vegetables oil into each cup as well, and the second half 15 minutes for baking, bascially ... no need to bake that long, until its golden brown, thats good enough.. i love it, but too bad... my husband doesn't like it..

I loved the individual servings.  I also heated the drippings in the muffin tin before I added the batter.  They were perfect.  They remained puffy even after they cooled.  I will never go back to putting the batter in one pie plate again.  Excellent recipe.

Last year, I rated this recipe 5 stars b/c of presentation. This year, I'm changing it to 4 stars. If you prepare this using all the beef drippings, it makes a MESS in your oven. So, it's best to have a catch try beneath the muffin pan to catch all the over-flowing fluids. I still LOVE the presentation / taste of this recipe. However, I believe the quantities of the ingredients are inaccurate. This recipe needs adjusting to receive the coveted 5-stars.

I was so excited these came out perfect! I was so afraid they would fall (high altitude) but these were a success. Great with warm honey and butter. Must serve straight from the oven.

this was the exact ingredients list i was looking for, but i did use my own tried and true baking method, like others have said, heat the fat to smoke point first and get the batter in the pan asap!

Never even had (much less cooked) Yorkshire Pudding before but I really liked this! I think it worked the way it should. Rose nice and high. They were nice and soft but still cooked on the inside and nice and brown on the outside. Very easy too. Cooked in a non-stick muffin pan which worked well, no sticking. I did make sure the batter was cold (made it about 2 hours ahead) and heated the oil in the wells before adding the batter. The middles did sink, but still had a nice texture so I don't know if that is supposed to happen or not. Doesn't matter since I really liked it. Served with "Boneless Garlic and Rosemary Rubbed Prime Rib with Red Wine Mushroom Sauce" also on this site - delicious. Will become a staple.

These were pretty good with a pot roast with gravy. I used the drippings from roast to make. I think next time I will use two tbls for each large muffin cup. Mine rose up nicely, didnt burn, but stuck to the pan so they were flat by the time I got them out of the pan. I think spray with pam next time. I cooked as directed. Also, didnt get the over eggy taste with these like I did with "Popovers for Two" on this site.

These tasted great-almost as good as the ones made by friend from Yorkshire! Perhaps it's just my oven, but I thought that 450°F was a bit too hot. The puddings rose beautifully, but they started to turn black on top before the initial 15 minutes were up, so after 12 minutes I lowered the temp to 350°F and baked for only 6 or 7 more minutes-if I had left them in any longer they would have been completely burned on top. They were still a little "wet" in the middle. Also, be warned: if your oven is not clean, this much heat will cause a smokey, smelly mess! I had to open the windows and the door to air it out, then just decided to go ahead and run the self-clean cycle since the downstairs already smelled of smoke! Finally, I used the extra drippings to make the gravy to serve with the puds, and it was delicious! The leftovers will be wonderful tomorrow morning with jam!

Turned out nicely.  Please remember to keep the door to the oven shut no peeking, or they will   drop.  When eating for the best taste pour gravy and meat over the pudding.

Oh my gosh!  After about 3 or 4 glasses of wine I forgot my dinner and ate 3 of these smothered with more butter and honey!  They were so good, next time I will try with a little cinnamon and sugar for breakfast.  So easy, So good and satisfying!!!  Thanks so much for sharing this special recipe.  I'm going for another glass of wine and a 'Yorkie"!

Reading and following the reviews made this recipe perfect by preheating my oil, making sure my batter was room temp before baking (I had to thin it out with a bit of milk before pouring) and filling the cups up 3/4 of the way. This recipe made 6 Yorkshire’s

This is the way I've always made them, with just two (large, XL) eggs to a cup of milk, not three, and a scant cup of flour.  I was surprised when I learned my mother had been adding a couple of tablespoons of melted butter to the recipe--I think this decreases the amount of rise.  Beef drippings are great if you have them--you could render some from some hamburger that isn't too lean--I've rarely had a whole cup to use and usually supplement it with butter...or, for the most part, just butter, when I really need popovers/Yorkshire pudding and don't have the drippings.  A popover pan is best if you have it, or a rectangle to make it like Yorkshire pudding. Definitely a good idea to briefly heat the pan with the drippings/butter in it (not long for butter or it will burn).  They rise very high in wonderful shapes, but I love them so much that I like to take some out when they've just solidified, before they rise and eat them like savory warm buttery pudding--OMG!

Loved these! I doubled the recipe...big family and I used an 1/8th of a tsp of veg shortening in the bottom of each muffin cup heated it until they were smoking, then poured the batter in to the top line and they rose up so nice and fluffy.  Amazing! My family gobbled them up.

These were a little bit more dense than I'm used to, but they were pretty good - not as good as my mum's, of course! -but I would make them again. Thanks!

I've never had yorkshire pudding before trying this recipe. It looks rather impressive after cooking the way it rises up over the baking cups.

This was so easy to make, and the best I have ever tasted!! I did use a bit of melted butter in each muffin cup (heated for 5 minutes)instead of the drippings, used a 12 cup muffin tin. Gotta try these, they were awesome!!

Very, very good. A wonderful accompaniment to prime rib or roast beef. I had only about 1/2 cup of the beef drippings and doubled the recipe, but I did as others suggested and replaced the missing dripping with melted butter. Boy was it good! Tasted just like the yorkshire pudding's at the popular prime rib restaraunt chain.

Good Recipe. My husband had these when he spent some time in Canada. He said these aren't exactly the same, but they are close. Very simple to make.

This Yorkshire Pudding recipe is amazing. I didn't quite have enough drippings so I added a bit of butter and it turned out amazing. It tasted just like my mom's. The key is to make it when the batter is at room temperature and of course like everyone's said...heat the drippings first. It turns out perfect everytime. Thank you Grandma.

Never before have I made yorkies that actually 'grew'!  These are very tasty albeit not quite as light as my Nana's.  Still they actually peeked out of the pan and that's enough for me!

This was my first attempt at Yorkshire Puddings.  My DH loved them.  Leftovers were great the next morning warmed and topped with strawberry jam.  This one is going in my "keepers" recipe box.

I tried this as my usual recipe has caused my puds to be known as Yorkshire Pancakes as they never rise.  But these rose a treat.  I will definitely use this recipe in future.  My only reason for not giving five stars is because the instructions don't tell you that you absolutely have to heat the oil first.  But that aside, this recipe is a keeper.

I combined MBUENZLI's suggestion with Nicola's and melted a tablespoon of butter in the bottom of each muffin tin in the oven. I filled each 3/4 full and ended up with batter enough for nine. A couple of them fell, but they still tasted great with gravy, and they were extremely easy to make.

First time ever making Yorkshire pudding. I have eaten them plenty. This was dense and bland. They were stuck to the muffin tins and burnt where it was stuck. Maybe I need to watch some one make them successfully

This is my original recipe and it never fails. I preheat the muffin tin until extremely hot but I heat the oil and drippings very carefully (uncovered in a glass measuring cup) in the microwave before putting in the tin. This way I don’t have the risk of smoke while heating the oil in the tin. Works great every time.

Same recipe as our family used for 60+ years.   Always works, only if you preheat the pan, and THEN heat the drippings till smoking.   I use bacon grease and this turns out fantastic.   I use  a baking pan and not muffin tins.   My mom. and grand-ma used the same  pan and it's the same one I use.   Its just a cheap tin pan, but my looks scarred, blacken and just plain old.   But it works.   remember ovens and pans are different so pay attention.

I will definitely make this again...it was delicious!  I used the larger muffin tin (6 cups)  rather than the 12 cup one.  The yorkshire raised wonderfully and was light and fluffy.

Other reviews were absolutely right...the tin must be smoking hot before filling with the pudding mixture.  It makes all the difference in how well it turns out.

If you don't have drippings, try substituting butter or shortening mixed with about 1 tsp of beef soup base (powder).  Just melt in the microwave and divide as you would the drippings.

Delicious! I added spices to taste and it was lovely. Consider using less oil/grease as mine had excess and tasted a little greasy on the bottom.

Yes first time to make and eat Yorkshire pudding. 
Rated low because of changes. Food allergies....substitute rice milk and gluten free flour with that said they did not raise high. Hubby still like d them. Well make again without substitutes.  So that my rating is fair!

Fantastic!  Very easy to follow.  I've never made Yorkshire Pudding before and this was so easy and absolutely delicious.  I cut everything in half and wanted a larger size, so used a metal pie pan.  Guessed how much drippings to use, but it was perfect.  Same cook time, etc.

Give it a try!!

All I want to say is... DELICIOUS...
This was my first time making this, I grew up on it. If my Mom says its good, its good. I used oil, but next time its beef drippings. I did preheat oil for 7 minutes. they puffed right up.
Who ever said terrible directions, lol... I guess they need to follow directions. This was my first time. I added a pic.

Thank you

I heated the fat in the tins in the 450 oven till they were boiling, then put in really well beaten batter, filling cups 3/4 full. I also made 1 1/2 times the recipe (3 eggs, 1 1/2 cup flour etc) and used margerine not beef drippings, just because my beef was on the BBQ. Turned out fantastic. Puffy, golden and delicious.

Fantastic! As an American I was feeling a little pressure to find a great Yorkshire pud recipe. My British husband and his boys loved these! If you don't have enough beef fat or just want some Yorkshire pud to go with a meal, use a small amount of melted lard instead. Also works a bit better if you preheat the muffin tin. Creates much more of that "blossom" effect when the batter rises. Do not suggest cooking these in a fan assisted oven as it cooks the outside of the pudding too fast and doesn't let it rise as much for that dramatic effect.

Yorkshire is my absolute favourite. These turned out wonderfully. I used homo milk and olive oil instead. Obviously you must pre-heat the oil in the muffin tins for 5 minutes. Just delish! Thanks grandma.

these are not usually simple to make but I was pleasantly surprised at the success of this recipe..I did, however, heat up the muffin tins in the oven first...it's supposed to help them rise!

Unfortunately I tried to alter this recipe and ended up with a smoky oven and kitchen. I put 1 tbsp of bacon grease in the muffin cups (bacon grease is what I normally use - but probably 1/2 tbsp less) and then put it in the oven to get really hot before putting in the batter. It was really delicious but the grease was all over the oven and I expected the smoke detector to go off at any point. That wouldn't have impressed the guests.
