As a Marine aboard the USS Henrico on my way to Viet Nam, I had the pleasure of eating Navy Chow.  This dish above all was my favorite.  I haven't had this for over 44 years and now I've found it again.  Now if my house could start rocking back and forth, I'll enjoy it more.  Thank you for the memories.

One of the few dishes in the Navy I could keep down.  Served at most of my commands every Sunday for brunch!

We called the stuff "s*** on a shingle" but we sure ate it.  This recipe eats better than I recall the original did.  The hungrier you are, the better it tastes.

This definitely brought back memories of my Navy days and breakfast aboard the ships on which I served!  When I first saw the stuff on the serving line, I thought it a bit strange to have for breakfast, but I quickly came to like it.  Minced beef on toast, a couple eggs, a big glass of OJ, and a cup of good old Navy coffee made a great hearty breakfast.  Yummy!

if you don't have nutmeg you can use mace as an acceptable substitute. We use to use both spices when we made it  just used 1/2 the amt for each one. if you don't have diced tomatoes use whole tomatoes and crush them before adding them to the mix if you do this cut back on the tomato juice since whole tomatoes will ad more juice and it will be waterery

When I was in the Navy, early 60s, I was a cook.  Navy SOS always was a favorite.  On the 2 different submarine tenders I was on we served it regularly.  I don't know about the rest of the Navy but we always had great food.  The chiefs running the general mess made sure the food quality was good and that the crew liked what they ate.

This is not bad, but like Smokin'Chris, I never ate this in the U.S. Navy. They used dried been and it was mixed in a white sauce (SOS).   Someone complained about the navy food, saying this was the only dish they could "choke down". Actually the food was very good and I never really saw anyone complain either.

My Navy pilot husband just put this recipe in front of me...with a big smile.  He'd been looking for one for years since he'd served on the USS Kearsarge aircraft carrier during Vietnam.  He said all the food he had in the Navy was good.  As far as the SOS goes...we both remember that as being chipped beef in a white sauce served over toast.  I'll be fixing this at our house often.  I think I'll add a fried egg on top of mine though.  Thanks for posting this STILLATIT.

Excellent! The only change i made was to use one more cup of tomato juice and 1/3 cup water instead of 1 1/3 cup water, so it was not too watery. I served over buttered biscuits.

A nice meal when the funds are low.  The flavor was sweet, but it was a perfect dish on a day where it is -35 degrees below zero.  I put a slice of swiss cheese on my toast and piled it with the meat.  Pretty greasy, but it worked.  Thanks for the recipe.

Good but not quite like I remember it.  Almost like it had too much meat in it.
But overall still good.

Brings back memory’s from my ole USS Forrestal days. One thing that will bring a young sailor out of his rack is piping hot US Navy minced beef and scrambled eggs and cheese for breakfast chow! The recipe was perfecto! I had it for a mid-day brunch! You bet  I’ll make it again. Don’t confuse this with the Army version! Had that too I’m from an army family. Phil RM3

Some people (non military) confuse this with creamed chipped beef. Totally different and this was just how I remembered it after serving 20 years, 2 months, and 28 days (if I were counting) on 3 submarines and 2 aircraft carriers.

I made this and shared it with my Grandmother who said, "This is the best soup I've ever had." She is 87. While I was in the Air Force I never ate this, but after viewing it and hearing the reviews I decided to make it. I was not disappointed. Although I might add I used "Mexican Tomato Sauce" instead of the aforementioned regular tomato sauce. So it may have spiced things up a bit. I went without the nutmeg. Still so so good!

SOS is "chipped" beef on toast (white sauce), this is "minced" beef on toast a totally different thing.. My Navy Chief (23 years) got the recipe from a Navy cook that said the spice was Mace.  Been using that for years but like it with the nutmeg better.

This brings back my days when I was in first grade, I just had to try it to see if it was the same dish.  Pretty much was, they fed this to us all the time.  It's still ok, next time I would skip the juice and add an extra can of rotel tomatos with herbs.  Thanks for the post and bringing back memories.

This is a simple recipe although I used tomato sauce instead of juice because that's what I had.  I also pared down the recipe for 1 lb. of ground turkey.  My husband prefers the white sauce version that I normally make.  My 8 yr old son liked it.
