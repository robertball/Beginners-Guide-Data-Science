Hmm, both my husband and I were disappointed with this recipe.  Why, you may ask, did I rate this a 4?  Because I think one of the main flaws of this recipe was my fault, and I hate when people ding a recipe for a change they made themselves.  I used mild diced green chiles instead of jalapenos, and I think it really needs the heat of something spicy.  My version of this pizza probably only deserves a 2.5 stars.  But, we also didn't really like the alfredo sauce...I think a more traditional white pizza with olive oil and garlic would have been more to our taste.  One other note is that we both thought a thin crust Boboli would have been better than the regular boboli crust we used.  On the plus side, the black beans are an interesting and delicious addition to a chicken pizza and the pizza looks very appetizing.  Thanks!

This pizza was fantastic! I didn't have chicken on hand, so I made a meatless version. I used chopped chipotle peppers instead of the jalapenos (personal preference) and i used a shredded chesse mix that included swiss, mozarella and monterey jack. I also added some black pepper and parmesan cheese. It turned out great with the black beans sprinkled on top. I have since made the pizza a second time, spreading the crust with fat-free refried black beans (instead of the canned beans), spooning the alfredo sauce on top of the bean layer and then so on with the other toppings. The refried bean layer acts as a barrier to prevent the alfredo sauce from soaking too much into the pizza crust. My second attempt tasted just as delicious.

Absolutely wonderful!!  The only change I made was to add mushrooms but this is a wonderful recipe.  We've had it twice already and used the same recipe to make a Barbeque Chicken Pizza using a sweet and sour barbecue sauce.  Delicious!  Thank you for the great recipe!

VERY TASTY!!  I added some corn and tomatoes to half of the pizza to see if they would be good.  They turned out great.  We will add those toppings in the future.   I loved the use of jalapenos on this pizza.  This is a keeper.

Excellent tasting pizza - my husband and I loved it!  We used green chiles instead of jalapenos (just because we couldn't find canned jalapenos).  One thing I would suggest is using a lot less sauce; it was very messy.  Otherwise, excellent - a permanent addition to our recipes!

Because my kids are very particular, I did NOT include the black beans, the jalapeno or the parsley -- although when it's just us grownups, I'd be interested in trying the complete recipe.  Even without these things the pizza was better than I expected.  Also because several other reviewers said one cup of Alfredo sauce was too much, I just sort of spooned it on smoothing it all over the pizza crust.  I probably ended up using about 1/2 cup, maybe even less.  I also sprinkled about 1/4 cup of fresh grated parmesan cheese on top.  This could be done when you take the pizza out.  Next time, I also want to try what the crust package suggested which I noticed AFTER I put all the stuff on the pizza, and THAT IS to spread some olive oil on the pizza crust to begin with - I think they said a tablespoon.  What I like about pizza recipes is that obviously they're easy to play with, and so you can satisfy your own taste.

Fantastic pizza. Tastes and looks gourmet. I made two pizzas, but added drained, diced tomatoes with green chiles to one of them. Yum! Be careful, though- using all four oz. of jalapenos is really really spicy!

This waS GREAT! Instead of buying the precooked chicken, I purchased marinated chicken breasts. When I cooked the chicken breasts, I added some garlic, and cooked them in olive oil. After they finished cooking, I cut them into strips, added a bit of butter; added onions, and bell peppers, then I sauteed this mixture with the black beans. For the Alfredo sauce, I used Portobello Mushroom Alfredo, because I love mushrooms. I used just enough sauce to cover the crust; and sprinkled a bit of cheddar cheese on the top, because I ran out of mozzarella. I will definitely make this recipe again! Thanks for the submission, Tiffany!

This was not too shabby!! I used a little extra cheese (you can never have enough cheese)! My fiance is a pretty tradiational guy and I didn't think anyone could mess with his pizza - but his response was very good!! Otherwise I followed the recipe completely and it was pretty good!!

Great recipe!  We love making pizza at home & this was a nice new twist instead of the every day red sauce pizza.  Very easy to make too.

This was very good.  I used a Boboli crust, canned mild green chile peppers instead of jalapenos (not as hot), and fresh grilled chicken breast.

Absolutely delicious!!! I did make a few changes, though. I cooked my own chicken breasts, seasoned with garlic, onion and rosemary, instead of buying the grilled. Any I added some shredded parmesan cheese on top of the alfredo sauce and the top. Mine only took about 10 minutes before the crust was crispy and the cheese was melted. Will definitely be making this again! Fantastic!!!!

I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, just used one of those canned crispy crusts, non-frozen chicken, and reduced the beans and Alfredo sauce a tiny bit. I have to say it was phenomenal. My boyfriend and I loved it and I'm currently enjoying the left overs for lunch. Five stars all the way, and I'd definitely recommend not substituting anything--the ingredients go perfectly together!

This was really good.  Would have given it 5 stars if it weren't so spicy.  Next time I will use canned green chilis instead of jalapenos.  Also was kind of greasy, will cut down on sauce next time.  Really good flavor, will make again.

this looks and sounds delish, i had to make a few changes though because i didnt have everything the recipe called for.  I had no alfredo sauce so i used some diced tomatoes with their juice, then i sprinkled some chopped garlic.  I also used only chedder as that was what i had on hand. i followed the rest of the recipe as is except i used a pita instead of pizza dough...was soooo yummmy!

It all sounded good in theory but when I pulled it out of the oven, my husband and I made a face.  Tried it anyhow and I have to say AMAZING.  Next time I think I will use more jalapenos.  I was scared that it would be too hot and only added 1/2 can but really it just added flavor.  It is what makes the pizza.  It isn't something my boys would eat even though I had them try it (they didn't spit it out like they hated it) but they had the option of a frozen pizza and went with that.  However, hubby and I devoured this.  Thanks for sharing. Update: boys now prefer this over the frozen junk.  I have to admit that I am obsessed with this pizza.  This is the "go-to" pizza for pizza night.

I have pretty much kicked my family off anything that comes in a jar or a package this year, but had one jar of alfredo left in the back of the pantry, so I decided to try this.  I made homemade pizza dough and parbaked it for about 10 minutes.  When I pulled out the alfredo, I realized it was roasted red pepper flavor, which I didn't think really "went" with the recipe, but I used it anyways.  I used chicken when I cooked earlier in the week in the crockpot and then shredded.  Since I didn't use frozen chicken, I skipped the oil/garlic stage and just stirred a little minced garlic into my alfredo sauce. I left out the jalepenos on the kids' side, but on our side, I added liberal jalepenos, and topped with a mixture of mozzarella and pepperjack.  You really couldn't taste the roasted red pepper through the spice.  All in all, this is not my favorite pizza on the planet, but it is very tasty, versatile, and unique!  We all enjoyed it (although when we tasted the kids' side, it was reeeally bland without the jalepenos, so they really are what gives this dish it's signature flavor).

This recipe was good but I felt it was missing something.  It did not have the zip I thought it would have.  I will make again and try adding minced onions to see if I can up the flavor.

I made this last Friday for my husband and me.  DELICIOUS!  I made a few changes, just using what I had on hand: canned pizza dough, leftover beef and slices of smoked sausage (instead of chicken), and I diced my jalapeno slices and sprinkled on top.  A great alternative to the same old tomato-sauce pizza!  Will definitely make again!

Absolutely fabulous!!  I had a pizza night recently and decided to make one of the pies with the toppings from this recipe.  WOW!  Talk about a punch of flavor!  The one difference I did was put green chilies (diced) on half and jalapenos on the other half so the heat factor was fair for everyone who wanted to try.  A total hit!  Great recipe!

This pizza is great!  I forgot the jalepenos and wondered why it tasted a little bland. I think next time I'll try seasoning the black beans first to add some spice, and maybe mixing in some chiles.  I used the "Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce" recipe on this website - best recipe I've found for this sauce! and only used about 1/4-1/2c.  Used whole wheat thin crust, fresh chicken and added fresh spinach - Yumm!!

THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!!!  Contains no acidy tomatoes, or heavy spices, and is delicious!!  I am again able to eat pizza!!  Alfredo sauce--who would have thought???
P.S.  I substituted artichoke hearts for the jalapenos.

I made this with garlic Alfredo sauce and left off the minced garlic. I also added black olives. It was good, I don't usually try white pizza, because I really like tomato sauce on my pizza. This recipe was different though, and it wasn't bland due to the peppers.

A great way to get kids more beans! I left off the peppers, because my kids are not fans. Otherwise the pizza had great flavor. Thanks for the great starter recipe!

I really enjoyed this pizza.  It didn't take that long to make and it was delicious.  It was spicy because of the jalapenos, but I love spicy!

I loved the idea of this pizza but I don't like alfredo sauce.  So, I used a suggestion and made it with garlic olive oil.  It was good, but I expected the flavors to come together better. I used black beans and frozen jalapenos with seeds that I defrosted first.  I don't know if the frozen jalapenos took away too much of the kick.  I thought the pizza was good, not great like I had hoped.

I made the vegetarian version and omitted the Chicken and Olive Oil. I just mixed the garlic into the alfredo sauce and baked. Very flavorful pizza!

This is by far one of my favorites! It reminds me of a Jalapeno popper! I used a pizza dough and made homemade alfredo, and put a lot on! I also cooked up a chicken breast and seasoned it with garlic salt and pepper. I also added some Parmesan cheese to the mozzarella cheese and used dried beans instead is canned. I also added parsley, garlic powder, salt and pepper to the crust with a little avocado oil.

Absolutely delicious!  Only change I made was leaving out the chicken as I love chicken,  just not on pizza! And, I added salsa as an optional dipping sauce. This will always be one of my family's favs when it comes to pizza!  Thank you for the creation.

I'm always looking for new & interesting pizza recipes.  This is most definitely a keeper!  Not a huge fan of Alfredo sauce but this is pretty good.  Sauce complements the other ingredients quite well.   I added sautéed red onion & mushrooms.

Made my own whole wheat crust.  I added more garlic  than what was called for, because we love it.  I didn't have canned jalapenos, so I used fresh.  I think it would have been much better with the canned.  It needed a kick, so I ate it with Tapatio.
