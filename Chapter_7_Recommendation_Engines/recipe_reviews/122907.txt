They were good, but way too greasy.  Next time I will do what another reviewer suggested and cut the oil used in half.

Great recipe. I line the pan with no-stick foil and substitute olive oil adding it to the bag with the seasonings. Much less fat than fries!

Yum.  Simple and tasty. Very easy- It's shake and bake potatoes!  However, I used the specified coating for 3 very large Russet potatoes and cut down on the oil.  I prebaked the potatoes by microwaving them for 15 minutes.  I then coated them and baked for 5-10 minutes. I'll make this recipe often in the future.

We really liked this! I only gave it a 4 because I like others better, like the "roasted Cajun potatoes" on this site, but overall this was SIMPLE, EASY and MUCH BETTER than regular potatoes. This is a great BREAKFAST recipe for company, served with eggs or whatever! I thought the BLEND of spices and cheese was perfect. My husband said HE WOULD HAVE USED A LITTLE LESS CHEESE. This recipe could EASILY be altered to add or take away whatever spices/cheese you prefer. Thats why I like THIS RECIPE! Its a good recipe TO TRY FOR EVERYONES TASTE!

These were really good and easy to make.  I cut the amount of oil a bit and put it right in the plastic bags with the potatoes & seasonings.  They came out nicely crisp on the outside, tender inside and very tasty.  Thanks!

Everyone loved. I used as a side dish with meat loaf from this site. Made exactly as written except cut recipe in half, so that had 6 servings, used olive oil and just slightly less than what was called for, put the olive oil in the bag while tossing, and baked at 350 for 65 minutes to go with the meat loaf that was also baking. Needed a bit more seasoning so sprinkled on Lawreys seasoned salt. Smelled spectacular!  My 13 year old daughter asked me to save leftovers...begrudgegly.

Nothing hard about this.  I followed the recipe exactly except I cut the potatoes in slices (like au gratin) and added more cheese (a handful or so).  My company raved about them and my family asked me to make them again.  The prep time could be cut way down by leaving the skins on and dicing.  I made them for a brunch and they were an easy side dish that everyone LOVED.

These were super easy and good! I used 5 large potatoes with the seasonings suggested for 6 medium potatoes, but I cut the oil down to 3 tablespoons. I did as others suggested and added the oil to the seasonings in the plastic bag before adding the potatoes. I put a light coat of oil on the bottom of the pan to prevent sticking. They cooked in about 45 minutes. There were no leftovers. I will definitely be doing these again and often!! Thank you for posting the recipe, Delores Billings!!

Huge hit with the family and very easy.  I followed a previous suggestion and just put the oil with the other ingredients in the zip lock bag and this worked very well.  At the end of the baking time I switched the oven to broil to give the potatoes a little extra crunch.  My husband already asked me to make them again. Thanks for the recipe.

My kids ranted and raved over these potatoes.  I followed the directions exactly with the exception of adding more cheese.  I cooked them 40 minutes but would cook them 50 next time as some pieces didn't taste all the way cooked.  These were very yummy and easy.
Definately a keeper!

Great, easy to make potatoes!  We used 6 potatoes but kept the amount of the seasonings and cheese as listed in the recipe, except for salt (which we cut down to under 1 tsp) and oil (olive instead of vegetable, using ~2 tbsp.)  We also added a pinch of cayenne and they came out very flavourful.  Cooking them under the broiler for the last couple minutes really helped crisp them up too.  Will definitely be making this again!

These were delicious!! I cut down on the oil to about 1/4 cup and used olive oil instead. I added all the ingredients including the oil in a freezer bag and added the potatoes. After seasoned I put onto a foil lined pan sprayed with cooking spray. I then baked as stated. My husband wasn't crazy about them but I think it was because of the parmesan cheese. If I make again I will cut down on it. These were great the next day fried in a pan with a little butter and served with eggs. Tasted like Bob Evans breakfast potatoes. Yummm!!!!

Awesome, everyone loved these potatoes. I did half the recipe (potatoes only) and kept the seasoning amounts the same. Also, added a sprinkle of seasoned salt and a dash of parsley. This will go in the weekly dinner menu for sure! Thanks for sharing.

I love these potatoes.  I don't follow the recipe too closely.  I normally make extra coating - making sure they are completely coated - and then coated again.  I also use only a little bit of oil. The great thing is, you can adjust as you need for your tastes.

I made these exactly as recipe said and they were great!!! Next time I think I will add another 1/2 tablespoon of parmesan because the flavor of the parmesan wasnt as robust as I would've preferred it. A++!!!

These are delicious... but they are a bit greasy.  I tried it with a little less oil and they were too crunchy on the edges......so I have yet to master these.  The kids love them with ketchup.

This is a great recipe for using up leftover baked potatoes from the night before. If the potatoes are already baked, it took about 30 minutes in the oven, sliced au gratin style.

This is an easy, flavorful recipe, and looks really appetizing, too.  I made a third the recipe, used 6 small red potatoes and used a little less oil (~1 tbsp) and added it to the bag with the spices and potatoes.  I also sprayed the pan with cooking spray.  It took 50 minutes for the 3/4 inch potato cubes.  Definitely a keeper, thanks!

We loved this recipe! However, I used just under 1/4 cup of olive oil and mixed the oil in with the spices in the bag. I then lined pan with foil and greased it. We will make this again, and everyone wanted more!!

I've been making a recipe almost like this for about 12 years. The only difference was butter instead of oil, and it called for 1/4 c. flour too. I made this recipe as stated, hoping to cut the carbs slightly. With that much oil, the flour is really needed. It gave much more of a coating that I missed with these. So maybe butter instead of oil, since they were very oily, or leave the oil and add 1/4 c. flour. Still very good though.

Great tasting and easy recipe!  I am always looking for new potato recipes.  I added some seasoned bread crumbs to the mixture for extra crunch and used plain ol' white potatoes- turned out delish!

Would have given it 5 stars if I didn't have to alter too much. I also used 4 medium potatoes since it was just for me and my man. Here's what I did:  -didn't peel potatoes and quartered them(but that depends on your taste).  -increased to 3 tsp salt (since potatoes need more salt and I love flavor.  -reduced oil to 3 tbsp.  -added a few shakes of thyme, rosemary, and parsley flakes.  -mixed it all in a plasitc bag before pouring in a foil-lined dish.    Also, make sure you give it a nice toss every 15-20 mins while it cooks or else it will stick.

These were very good and had a nice flavor too. I tossed these in the baking dish and just sprinkled the seasonings over and stirred them around until they looked evenly coated. Easy and good. What more could you ask? Thanks.

Easy and good flavor. My suggestions: Leave the skins on and cut into lengthwise potato fingers. Eliminate the oil and just spray a cookie sheet with PAM before placing potato fingers (skin side down) on the cookie sheet.

I had some wrinkly spuds that needed using up, and a heel of Parmesan that had also seen better days. I can't believe everything turned out so delicious! Like other reviewers, I added a splash of olive oil to the bag of seasonings. The potatoes took about an hour to completely soften so maybe my chunks were a little to big. This would be amazing with some diced onion too. Served it with Marinade for Chicken-marinated chicken, and plain steamed broccoli. Awesome. Thanks so much, Delores!

Not once, but THREE times my husband remarked how wonderful these potatoes were!  I used russet potatoes and didn't peel them, just scrubbed and cut into fry sized chunks.  Also added a bit of cayenne pepper to the seasonings.  Very crispy and great flavor!  Simple and delicious, thanks for sharing this recipe.

I was just a bit disappointed with these.  I felt they lacked some flavor and would definitely have been better with some chopped garlic and some onions maybe.  I did add a bit of chili powder but still didn't help.  I will make again with chopped garlic and just a touch of chipolte chili powder for some heat.  I did make the recipe for 6 servings and used olive oil in lieu of the veg. oil. Either put the oil in the bag as suggested in other reviews or make sure to toss the potatoes around in the pan to cover all with oil.

Very yummy!  We even added some freshly grated parmesan on top of the oven-fried potatoes just as we took them out of the oven.

Great recipe! My husband kept nibbling on the leftovers long after his plate was clean. I did cut down on the oil and used olive oil, but sprayed the pan with olive oil nonstick spray and clean up was very easy. I also prefer to scrub potatoes and leave the skin on, so it was even easier and healthier.

Delish -- I made as described except for cutting way back on the oil, and I'll definitely be making these again.  My kids gobbled them up.

This is my new go to recipe for potatoes.  Even my kids will eat them.  The recipe is great as is.  I've also cooked the potatoes in the microwave, diced them, added the seasoning and baked for 15 minutes to get the seasoning baked on.   Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I made these along side a spinach quiche and everyone loved these. It was for 4 adults so I used 6 medium potatoes so I cut the amount of seasonings in half. I still felt like they needed more seasonings after that so I added more garlic powder, paprika and parmesan cheese. I will try adding the oil to the bag next time. I will definitely make these again.

These were great!!! I prepared the recipe for 4 servings and used 2 tbsp plus 1 tsp of olive oil and they were not greasy at all. I put the potatoes in the plastic bag, added the oil, tossed it around and then added the seasonings and tossed again, yummmmmmm

These were a nice, tasty alternative to plain old potatoes.  I like not dirtying another bowl when I'm cooking - just put it all in the bag and then throw the bag away!  
Maybe I didn't stir the potatoes enough because they stuck to the glass pan I had them in.  I might try using some non-stick spray next time.
