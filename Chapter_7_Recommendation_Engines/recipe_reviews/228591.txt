Just wanted to answer lovestohost question about what this salad actually is :) I didn't see a way to edit my description for a submitted recipe, but in our family its served as a side dish at barbeques, picnics, and potlucks. Its usually placed with the salad options. Enjoy!

I give this recipe high marks for its simplicity and flavor. The ingredients are ones I'm likely to have on-hand in the pantry or deep-freeze.  It is good as a side in a buffet-style luncheon, or handy to-go lunch in a pita pocket.  It is a nice break from tuna or chicken salad. I will make this again.

I had horribly overcooked ham leftover and this recipe saved the day!  This salad is delicious!  It came together in under 5 minutes.  I did use 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup mayo instead of 3/4 cup mayo and found that to be plenty.  I also used 1 tbsp of dried minced onions (instead of fresh), which I found gave a pleasing crunch to the salad.  I rolled this up in a tortilla and had a fantastic lunch!  Thanks for this recipe!

This is one of three recipes I made to use up the holiday ham.  It's a great quick side dish. I omitted the onions, but added celery. I also did a mix of Mayo and sour cream. I used cubed cheese and cut those cubes into quarters. My husband loved it. I could see myself making this again for a quick dish for a buffet or hosting a party.

I made this pea salad for a potluck and it was a hit! I doubled the recipe up too. The only thing I changed was I used canned peas instead of frozen peas. Great recipe!

I added boiled egg as well as garlic juice to enhance flavor.

I think it was the same time last year that I last tried this recipe because I love green peas and had ham left over from Christmas dinner and I just really loved how this salad turned out! I especially love that it's all ingredients I usually have on hand anyway :-)  I think last time I made it, I added a little bit if diced celery too to add an little extra crunch!

This is a super easy to throw together salad.  Per personal preference, I'll probably cut the mayo w/sour cream if I make this again because I'm not a big fan of mayo.  Mr. LTH enjoyed this and so did I, but I'm not quite sure what it is?  Is it a sandwich spread?  Is it a side?  I appreciate the versatility, but I'm not sure what I'd make this as.  THANKS for the recipe, AuLait!
