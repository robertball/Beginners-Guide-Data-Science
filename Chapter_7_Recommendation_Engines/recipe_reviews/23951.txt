SO SO Good!  I didn't use as many onions as this called for and I added some jalapenos.  Many compliments!

1st time I made it, it was ok.  Second time, better...I added a little taco seasoning to the sour cream mixture.  Much better!  Thanks.

Tasted okay, but really needed something else to give it a "kick."  I think some refried beans on top of the cream cheese/sour cream mixture would be good.

This is yet another easy recipe.  I chose this to serve at an employee party.  I made the tragic mistake of scaling the recipie to one half.  Next time I will double it!  This dip was totally gone literally in minutes.

Very good!  I made it for a small family gathering and the little that was left over I ate all the rest that same night, it was just too good.  I put regular white onions in instead of green onions and it still turned out great.

I made this for a potluck at work and it was gone in a short amount of time.  I added a packet of low-sodium taco seasoning to the cream cheese mixture as suggested by other reviewers.  I also omitted the diced tomatoes and only used a small can of sliced olives because I used a smaller dish and the olives and tomatoes would have overwhelmed it and made it too runny.  I think the taco seasoning is what made it so good.  I served it with whole grain Tostitos.  EDITED:  I made this again recently for another work function.  I didn't have olives, so I used drained and rinsed black beans instead.  I also used hot and spicy Old El Paso taco seasoning, which gave it a little kick, but not too much.

We have a similar recipe in our family that is always a big hit.  We use medium taco sauce instead of salsa (less watery and better tangy flavor) and add chopped tomato, onion and green pepper after the sauce layer.  Yum!

I made this dip for a party at work and it was a real hit!  Several people asked me for the recipe.  I think the dip would have been too bland if I hadn't used a jar of HOT salsa.  There is plenty of cream cheese/sour cream mixture to disperse the heat of the salsa yet leave a little kick.

Easy and quick to make.  The salsa I used was a little watery, May think about draining it next time

This was great and easy to make!  I made a few changes - I used a can of refried beans as the first layer, split the cream cheese in half, added about a 1/2 packet of taco seasoning in the cream & sour cream mixture, and added some green onion on top to, to make it look pretty.  It was great, everyone loved it!  It would also work with a little taco meat for a yummy taco salad too!

I made this recipe with a few changes.   I omitted the onions, used light cream cheese and 1 cup of light sour cream to which I added the taco sauce.  I highly recommend mixing the taco sauce with the cream cheese as other viewers suggested and drained the salsa.  This step is crucial to omit runniness.  It was delicious!  I will definitely will make this again!

Taco dips are always popular with a crowd.  This recipe was very bland, which serves the "mild" crowd well.  The amount of green onion was out of balance (too much).  The cheese mixture could use some flavor too (taco seasoning, garlic, cumin, oregano, etc.)  Needs just a little something to jazz up the bland factor.  It's a good dip for those who are new to or don't care for more exotic flavors and it's easy to assemble too.  All in all, still a crowd pleaser.

Have made this many times...always a hit.  I hate olives, so they get left out, and I tend to use a little less sour cream than called for.

Very good, just what I was looking for. I also added taco seasoning to the cream cheese mixture and jalapenos for a little kick. This dip was gone within an hour of setting it out!

This was great.  Wish I had it a couple days earlier for Cinco de Mayo.
I make a quck dip that is similar.  I spread the cream cheese in the bottom of a glass baking dish.
Then I cover it with a can of chillie.  On top of that I place a jar of picante sauce and cover theat with a layer of shredded chedar cheese.
Pop it in the microwave for 10 minutes and it is great with tortillia chipx.

this was VERY bland.  I think it was probably the least favorite of all dips that I have ever served.  
it definitely needs to something to give it flavor.

I am the original poster of this recipe, given to me by my friend Daryl.  I enjoyed reading all the different variations that others have used. I'll have to try a few of them. 
   I usually warm the ream cheese slightly, add the onions and then the cream cheese.  I layer these in the pan and refridgerate pvernight (if I have tiome) for the flavors to blend.
   The salsa is sometimes runny, I usually add it just before serving.  Draining it would be an option. You can easily vary the heat/spiciness of the recipe based on the type of salsa you use (mild or hot). 
   Thanks everyone for the reviews!

Amazing! I made this for a project in my grade 10 food and nutrition class, and it was a BIG hit, instead of using tortilla chips with the dip, we made vegan Black bean and corn quesadillas and used the dip on top of them! My plate didn't last more than 5 minutes! I would recommend this recipe to EVERYONE, there is sooo much room to add your own personal flavours and ingredients!

I made this last night for a potluck at work today along with a second batch to share with the kids at home. Needless to say the batch at home was gone last night and the people at work raved about it. I did add some diced jalepeno's into the cream cheese/sour cream mix and it gave it a little extra kick! So if you are looking for a fresh and easy mexican dip, this is for you! I will make it again for sure.

Good recipe, but would have been better with the taco seasoning in the cream cheese mixture as suggested in the reviews.  I'll definitely make it again though!  I might add some refried beans as the bottom layer next time.

This was excellent.  I made it for a party and everyone said we should have just had it for the main course!!  I made a double batch and put the black olives on half because I don't eat them.  It tasted great without them but, the black olive side went the first. Doubling it made a huge amount and it was hard to find a pan big enough for layering it so, be careful. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I loved this dip. I'm not a huge fan of refried beans so I was psyched to find a mexican dip w/o them. I serve this every chance I get. My family and friends just love it.

Originally rated a 4 star but have upgraded to 5 star.  This really is a huge hit whenever I take it to a party and there are always requests for the recipe so feel it deserves the 5 star treatment - what a winner(even on the other side of the world.)   Thanks for sharing
