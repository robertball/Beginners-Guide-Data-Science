I made two small changes in this recipe--I did not have the dried chile peppers but I did have chili garlic sauce (it's made by Huy Fong Foods, it has a rooster on the jar). I used a heaping teaspoon, it's got quite a kick and a little goes a long way. I also used one small package boneless, skinless chicken THIGHS instead of chicken breasts. This turned out FABULOUS. I served this with homemade vegetable fried rice--NO LEFTOVERS. My husband asked me to make a double recipe next time to make sure there is leftovers.......or at least extra for seconds. This is a very economical recipe to make.

It tasted good. 
I followed the recipe exactly omitting the peppers. 
The sauce was too thick and had a chalky texture. I think there was way too much corn starch for my liking in this recipe. 
In the future, I would take out the 1/4 cup corn starch and use a 1 tsp corn starch 1 tsp water slurry to thicken the sauce. 
Otherwise, it's delicious and worth making.

Absolutely delicious! I used shallots instead of green onion because I had them on hand. I put in half a red and half a green bell pepper, and the added flavor was delightful. When I make it again (which I absolutely will!)I will also probably put half the sugar in, as it was a bit too sweet for our taste. Overall a great recipe!
