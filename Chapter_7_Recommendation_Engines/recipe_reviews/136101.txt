I make this every 4th of July and there are never any leftovers. I use angel food cake instead of pound cake. I also sprinkle slivered almonds on the top. Always a hit!!

Used Free Cool Whip, Sugar Free Angel Food Cake, Sugar Free/Fat Free Instant Vanilla Pudding (cheesecake and banana are great too) and Skim Milk. Absolutely Delicious and Guilt Free :)

This was a very impressive dessert! I brought it to a Memorial Day Party and no one could resist it! It was yummy!I made it in a 4 qt, glass salad bowl. I had to double all the ingredients to fill the bowl.I would definitely make this again!

This was delicious!! I couldn't find a fat-free pound cake, so I just used a regular one. Also, blueberries were expensive at the time, so I used strawberries, raspberries and kiwi instead. It looked impressive and was very tasty!

This was excellent! I made this for the 4th of July and everyone commented on how wonderful it was. Thank goodness they didn't realize how easy it is to make! The only change I made was adding alittle of the coolwhip to the pudding mix. Wonderful!

The only thing I add is kiwi in the middle to add more fruit flavor. This is a cool dessert that will appeal to the masses.

I went to a memorial bbq tonoight, and I had to rate this because it was a BIG hit, I filled an entire trifle bowl and came home with nothing! I followed the recipe, for the exception of making my own whip crm from heavy whipping crm, and doubled the recipe! YUM!

This was excellent! The only thing I did differently is I made my own pound cake instead of using frozen store bought. Soooo good! Made this for Memorial Day and it was a huge hit at the BBQ. I will be making this again!

I used another recipe but this one was the most similar.  I used blueberrys, strawberries, and raspberries.  Instead of 2 cups milk, mix the pudding with 1 cup milk, once blended add 1 cup low fat sour cream.  I used angle food cake.  There were no left overs!

This my my very first trifle ever. I made this on the 4th of July for a barbecue and it was delicious. I didn't use fat free and suger free products because I was taking it to a barbecue and who counts calories there. I will be making this again.

I thought the ingredients left a chemical after-taste, which I didn't care for. I rarely cook or bake with ingredients that are not all natural , but needed a dessert to take to a  4th of July party. Never again! I'll stick to the healthier "chemical free" real ingredients.
