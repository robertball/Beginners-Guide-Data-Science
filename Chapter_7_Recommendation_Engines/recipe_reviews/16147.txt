Great recipe however waaaaay to soupy.  I marinated my thawed shrimp in the lemon and lime juice for about 5 hours.  I then drained the shrimp and mixed the salad as per directions but omitting the lemon and lime juices.  The salad wasn't quite as soupy and had even better flavor.  I added more celery too.

Great shrimp salad, quick and easy!  I used less lemon juice and also only put in enough light mayo to hold it together.  Great in a wrap sandwich!

I just tried this recipe today. My husband and my guest loved. However, I did make a few additions to it. I always season my shrimp before I cook them(since they have little or no taste on their own); so I used a little cajun seasoning and adobo. I also added a third stalk of celery. Overall, the suggested ingredients were great!!!!
I will make it again.

this recipe was really great, but i'm not a big fan of mayo, so i used half mayo and half sour cream.  i didn't have a lemon either, so i did lemon pepper.  it was delish!

This smelled wonderfully, however I think there was too much lemon juice for my family's tastes. It was rather sour and very runny.  I would reduce lemon juice and up the mayo because the "sauce" was not sticking to the shrimp which made it difficult to eat in a pita.

Loved it! Made in a pinch for a impromtu in law gathering and everyone raved about it. I did add 2-3 pounds of imitation crab meat to this recipe so it was not soupy and it helped stretch the amount for a large group.

I first tasted this at a party and 
could not stop eating it! This salad
is delicious. Thankfully, the woman
who brought it gave me the recipe and 
told me where she found it--SaladRecipe.com!

Delicious. I made this with fresh dill from the garden, and it was very refreshing on a hot summer day. I served with fresh baked bread. Yum. I substituted sour cream for the mayonnaise, and it was light and creamy.

I used this recipe for a baby shower and made finger sandwiches on sour dough bread.  It was really yummy.  I used some extra dill and added a pinch of salt.  I think I will slightly less lemon juice next time because it was a little runny or maybe increase the mayo but it was really good and was a big hit.  Thanks!

Delicious! All the flavors blended very well and complimented each other nicely. I used lemon and lime juices to taste and mayonnaise to desired consistency. Important to let it sit and chill so the flavors come together.

Really refreshing ... used frozen baby shrimp, which I defrosted and chopped ... and then I sqeezed as much moisture as I could out of them and dried them with paper towels ... then added some cayenne pepper to the dressing, which clung very well to the shrimp ... a hit with family and friends!

VERY tasty!!  I used light mayonnaise, no lime juice, and a splash of white wine.  I also increased the amount of fresh dill to two tablespoons, and added a good amount of fresh cracked black pepper and a little sea salt.  We loved this!

Big hit. Added to my permanent collection. Changes: Used only 1 tsp lime juice. Also used half-fat mayo and fat free greek yogurt instead of the full-fat mayo.

This is a wonderful salad and has become a staple for when I want something quick and easy.  It works just as well with just lemon or lime juice and just enough mayonnaise to hold it together.  I like to add just a drop or two of hot sauce to give it a little kick.  Using low or no fat mayonnaise also makes it very figure friendly.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Prepared as directed but the citrus tang was overwhelming.  Just dill and mayo would be much better next time.  I think I will just wing it and I think we will be much happier.

I had some shrimp in the refrig and I wanted to make a quick salad for dinner and I did not have all of the ingredience so I compromise and chopped half of an onion a little old bay lemon and cerely . I did not have any lime I used dried dill instead of fresh and the salad was wonderful.  A good cook always use what in the pantry the next time I make the recipe and I know it will be even better thank you for this recipe

I made this for finger sandwiches and it tasted very good. The only criticism I have is that it was pretty runny.

This is one of at least a few of this very same recipe on this website, just named a little differently.  I like it so much I make it over and over again, tho' with my own tweaks to suit my taste  - far less juice, mayonnaise as needed, and some sweet peas for color and interest.  On occasion,  I have also added chopped hard-boiled egg.  This time I had no green onion so a teensy bit of sweet onion filled in.  When Hubs has his potato salad, this is a great, no-carb alternative for me!

We loved this recipe so I made another batch for a luncheon at work and a lot more people validated it - it's a 5 star recipe!  I did add about 2 TBS dill pickle salad chunks because I really like dill, but it didn't need it - the recipe is solid on it's own.  I'm planning to make it again this week.  Thanks, Dirk!

This was what I was looking for ... pan cooked the prawns in butter and garlic. Mixed the Mayo with a tablespoon of blue cheese dressing.
Let it all sit for 4 hours till serving over butter greens. Had along with grilled salmon and wild rice. Now my boyfriend want's to marry me. Thanks for the basic.

Really good favor. served it on a croissant. love it. In my opinion, it was a bit too soupy with the mayo. after I was done I had some extra shrimp and put it in there to lessen the soupiness.  Next time I will only add a half cup of mayo. I also noticed that when I cut up the large shrimp into bite-size pieces the mayo sticks to it better.  overall I very good recipe. I made it also a second time without the lemon-lime juice and really it's good either way.  for my taste less juice makes it tastier.

Did not like these flavors. Way too "lemony". Nothing in here to balance the acid.

Great recipe!   We are lucky enough to have access to fresh shrimp every day and this is my go to recipe!  The lemon and lime along with some dill and old bay seasoning can't be beat. The citrus really brightens up any seafood salad you make. The dill and old bay give it a depth of flavor so it isn't bland. Great recipe

I really liked it.  It was the first salad of this type that my husband liked.  I made no changes.  When I make it again, I am tempted to add a little cayenne and lemon juice.

Quick and easy! Just how I like sandwiches. I used small salad shrimp that I had on hand and it was delicious! This shrimp salad is delicious on it's own or on a buttery hot dog bun- which makes it even richer. I did do 1/2 mayo and 1/2 non-fat greek yogurt which I like to do when making a creamy salad recipe. It added a nice tart flavor to the recipe.

I made only one small change to this recipe: I only added the juice of 1 lemon and the juice of 1/2 of a lime and it was still too citrus tasting.  It was also too runny. After both of those mishaps I had to add extra salt and pepper and some parsley to throw off the citrus taste as best as I could. Recommendations for next time: I would pat the shrimp dry after cooking to eliminate extra liquid then squeeze only a "spritz" of lemon and lime over the shrimp.  Then mix remaining ingredients as specified. If it is still too runny and citrusy I might add a dollop or 2 of full or low-fat sour cream.
