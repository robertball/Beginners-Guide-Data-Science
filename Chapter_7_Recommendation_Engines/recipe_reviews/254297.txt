We served this cake at a family dinner.
It was moist, and not too sweet without any changes to the recipe. We liked the fact that this recipe had no clove in it, kept the spices from overpowering us. We did add 2tsp. Watkins brand
Vanilla extract. We also baked in a bundt pan.
Remember to cool ten minutes on a cooling rack before removing from pan onto serving dish. We dusted with confectioners sugar and served with a dollop of whipped cream instead of Ready Whip. A nice  autumn pudding and easy to make!

I made this tonight and it made a lovely cake and we ate it for desert after dinner with whipped cream.  The taste of the ginger was so mild that my husband even stated that it really didn't taste like true gingerbread.  Before baking the batter, I tasted it and felt like it needed to have more ginger, so I added one more teaspoon at that point.  For us, it needed something else, just not sure what.  I do think it is a good starting point.

I halved the sugar and used white instead to brown (brown is precious in my part of the world) and the sweetness was just right. A really good cake.

I doubled the spice amounts but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  It had a dark, rich color and kept its shape beautifully, but it was dry.  The applesauce that some reviewers added should remedy that nicely.  A bit of grated fresh ginger would be a good addition, as well.

I live in the South.  When I baked this bread, it needed a minimum of 55 minutes.  I didn’t use the multi-grain flour - it was regular, unbleached, all purpose flour.  Perhaps that was the difference.  Anyway, it was delicious!

I made using a gingerbread cake pan from Williams-Sonoma and baked for 19 minutes. Baked very well but I do think the spices could be amped up a bit and I’ll try that next time.

I had one of my students make this cake. He has very,very little cooking experience. He accidentally mixed the buttermilk with the other wet ingredients, so we just gradually added the flour mixture. Still turned out great. Very nice flavour.
