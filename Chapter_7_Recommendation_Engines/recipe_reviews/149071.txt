This was okay, but needs alot of tweaking. It is plain and weird.

This was edible, but nothing more than that. I did use ground sage, not sage leaves. Gave it an odd flavor, without something like sausage to even it out. The krispies would have been better left out. I won't make this again. No photos, sorry.
