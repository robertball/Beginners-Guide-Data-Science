This was a huge hit with my guys. Doubled everything except the pasta, because this seemed like a lot of pasta, and it still seemed like it could have used more ham. I used large elbow macaroni, and subbed Velveeta for the cheddar because I had some on hand that needed to be used up. I also subbed golden mushroom condensed soup for one of the cans of soup, per the suggestion of another reviewer. My hubby, who "doesn't care for Velveeta," raved about this and asked for leftovers for lunch the next day. Not something we'd eat every week, but a darn tasty way to use up leftover ham.

Very basic. Good, but basic.

Seemed to need a seasoning. [I don't know spices]

I made the recipe exactly doubling the ham & peas as it seemed like it'd be alot of noodle if I didn't. Good thing! You need to.

Again, good basic, filler recipe. Seems like it'd be good for a pickier eater who is ok with peas.

I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the recipe, except for the macaroni. I only had one cup of cheddar cheese, so I used some pepper jack for the second cup. It added a nice spicy bite to the dish! Iâ€™ll definitely make this again!

Turned out great! Just stir fried broccoli in deprecate pan then added after instead of the frozen peas. Relish and super easy!

Made this tonight and left out peas (sorry, not a fan). I also doubled the recipe because of the macaroni I had left over. It's a great way to use up those Christmas ingredients that you normally might end up throwing away. Is it the BOMB? No. It's basic, simple and tasty. I did use 1-can of REG cream of Mushroom and then 1-can Golden Mushroom. I will definitely use it again.

Made a white sauce instead because I don't like the condensed soup.  Everything else stayed the same,  Great meal.

Just OK.  Too much pasta in relationship to sauce.  Needs something to spice it up a bit.

We love this recipe...It's quick and easy! I've even made it without ham for a quick pasta sauce. You can spice it up to your liking with lots of pepper or garlic while it's cooking.
