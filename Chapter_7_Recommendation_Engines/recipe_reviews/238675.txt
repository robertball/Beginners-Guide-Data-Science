Tasty! This would also be a great topper for burgers or steak sandwiches. I used light mayo. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this per recipe but found it a bit too oily so I tweaked it using homemade ricotta cheese instead of mayonnaise. You could also use cottage cheese that has been pureed or mashed up a bit though to save a bit of money and time. Then I made a roast beef Panini sandwich with red onions, provolone cheese, and fresh basil leaves. Yummy!

I think it would be better with cheese.
