These were phenomenal!  I made a few adjustments because I am doing Beach Bodies 21 day fix.  I used all white wheat flour and instead of brown sugar, I used 1/3 cup of maple syrup.  I also used 1/4 tsp of any spice that said a "pinch".  Instead of raisins, I did craisins and I used 1 cup of cooked quinoa.

The texture was wonderful but it could have used more flavor! I used butternut squash and 1 cup of cooked quinoa (I was trying to use up leftovers). Next time I would add a touch more sugar and twice the cinnamon.  Also, I stirred the quinoa in with the wet ingredients since the recipe did not stipulate when to add it in.

Made exactly as written (omitted the red pepper due to personal preference), these were really wonderful! They are a perfect option for a healthy breakfast - low in sugar, high in protein, fiber, and flavor. I eat them with home made apple butter which is the perfect compliment to the spices and texture.  If you like a sweeter muffin just add 1/4-1/2c more sugar, but I like them just as they are. Wouldn't change a thing!

Love these. I regularly send these in my kids lunches and itâ€™s one of their favourites. I only use cinnamon when I am making them for the kids.

I made this recipe up so I could have a mid-morning snack that would count. I love the muffins. This is staple snack in my freezer now. I take one out in the morning before work and it is ready by coffee break. You can warm it for 15 seconds in the microwave, if desired.

Do you add the quinoa to dry or wet ingredients?

There is no indication when to add the quinoa. I added it to the liquid mix....

Easy, moist and delicious!  They are just a little sweet. I used all whole wheat pastry flour, 1 c cooked quinoa, and fat free Greek yogurt instead of regular yogurt. I did 1/8 tsp for all the "pinch" spices; no cayenne.   I also squeezed excess moisture from the zucchini.  Also, I'm at about 5,000' and no issues ;).   Also good with 2 cups finely grated carrot in place of squash and added 1/2 cup apple juice.  Comes out to about 100 calories a muffin with  1 g fat, 21 g carbs and 4.2 g protien.
My kids loved these so I will definitely be making them again!

I didn't have squash so I used 1/2 cup crushed pineapple I had leftover and 1 cup grated carrots. I used Greek yogurt which made the batter a little stiff. I also used raw sugar.  I will make these again and add a little milk to the Greek yogurt and maybe a little Maple syrup. Very tasty.  Not sweet.
