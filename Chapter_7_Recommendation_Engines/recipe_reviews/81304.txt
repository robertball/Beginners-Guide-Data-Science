A bit bland.  I added about a cup of salsa and some sour cream.  Tasted much better.

This recipe definitely has potential, but there is something missing. I think a creamier hot sauce would be good, so it wouldn't be as dry. I heated up just the beans/corn/spices mixture the next day over rice and it tasted great!

This recipe was pretty good.  I didn't have onion or cumin, so I gave it a big dose of garlic.  I would like to try this with some chopped fresh tomatoes tossed after removing it from heat, or mixing in some salsa!

To begin, I should have used much less pasta. After adding a can of tomato sauce and tons more seasonings, it reminded me of my mothers very bland, very dry spaghetti (which she always served with corn!). It was simple and tastey enough, though. I'll probably try it again with less pasta.

This recipe was really easy, pretty good, and pretty healthy. I did add a can of rotel though. I also used homemade seasoned black beans and whole wheat spaghetti.

I too added a cup of tomato sauce, and less spaghetti (half the amount stated). I also added 1tsp of dried parsley, some cayenne pepper and seasoning salt. I enjoyed it!

Not bad... definitely needs some salsa in the mix and some sour cream.  Also cut the pasta mix in half--WAY too much pasta compared to topping.

Great twist if you are looking for pasta with an extra something special.  Not so great as leftovers, though.

I made this recipe as written, except that I used a 13 oz box of whole grain spaghetti instead of the 16 oz in the recipe.  I also had cooked my own beans, and had just over a pound of them.  Even with having less spaghetti and more beans than the recipe called for, there was WAY too much pasta for the amount of bean mix.  It was very dry. I ended up adding a bit of sour cream to make it more palatable. I won't try this one again without major adaptation.

Decent dish, but does need additions. I added garlic and diced tomatoes along with peppers. It was good, but still a little dry.

I loved the recipe! But I did change it up just a little! I used egg noodles instead of spaghetti noodles. Once I had everything mixed together I baked it. But before I put it in the oven to bake I made a mixture of... 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup of organic light milk, 1/2 cup of light sour cream.  I poured that on top. Then after that I sprinkled shredded Mozzarella on top. My husband loved it, it was spicy to his liking! We all enjoyed it!

A great pantry classic. I used Â½ can each black beans and garbanzo beans leftover from last night, put in a clove of garlic and topped with fresh tomato. I will keep this one in mind when I can find anything in the fridge.

Tastes good but next time I will add some garlic and use less noodles. Not enough sauce for a 16-ounce package.

I wasn't sure about this recipe at first but decided to make it because I had all of the ingredients on hand. I'm glad I did! I did make a few modifications: I added a dusting of cayenne pepper, about a cup of leftover tomato sauce that I had in the fridge, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice to the sauteing vegetables. Before serving, I tossed the sauce mixture with a cup of medium-heat salsa and a chopped avocado and served over whole wheat spaghetti. It turned out better than I expected... the tex mex taste lent itself well to the pasta.

I couldn't stand having spaghetti noodles and not having tomatoes, so I added a can of diced tomatoes  and used chili powder instead of hot sauce.  My husband said it was the best spaghetti he's ever had and my 2 toddler boys gobbled it up! (Amazing!)

Ok. a little dry. Added sour cream as stated previously and also increased the amount of hot sauce as we like our food hot. Will try again with other modifications because i love the combination.

I was so excited to find a spaghetti recipe that didn't include a great deal of cheese or tomato product, however, this one was not quite right. I added lean ground beef and the bean/corn/beef mixture tasted great. The problems occured when adding it to the spaghetti - the dish was just too dry. My daughter cut hers up and added extra olive oil and said that was better. I may play around with this one and see what I can some up with without adding a bunch of cheese or sauce, but as it is written it was just to dry for my family and it was difficult to get a bite of the mixture and the spaghetti together.
