Good banana cake recipe. Very moist and tasty. I made a few changes. I didn't have any sour cream, so I used plain fat free yogurt instead.

This cake is awesome! Here's another little tip- throw in a box of instant vanilla or banana pudding. Yummo!

The only thing I changed in this recipe was use half banana/half strawberries because I had to use them up or lose them. 

This was really simple to make and it 
smells incredible when baking. I thought about crawling up into the oven with it!
The whole family flipped for this bread.
It's incredibly moist and really flavorful. I'll for sure make this again,
but I think I'll try half banana/half blackberries!

Awesome and Easy recipe!
I replaced the sour cream with 1c. vanilla yogurt. I had a nice thick creamy batter that came together very easily and baked perfectly in the recommended time. The result was light and spongy with nice banana flavor and mild sweetness.
This was my first bundt cake! I wanted to try a new silicon bundt cake pan and happened to have some soft bananas. This is definitely something you could throw together last minute but looks (and tastes) very impressive. Recommended!

Wonderful!  I had Strawberries that were on there way out and a couple of overly ripe bananas to use up as well.  Also had a bag of blueberries in the freezer.  (I powdered the fruit w/ flour before adding to batter)  The fruit addition to this cake made it comparable to Starbucks Blueberry Coffee Cake!  Mmmm!  It was a hit at my husbands work!

This cake has a delicious flavor--I cut the amount of sugar in half and added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and it turned out great!  however, I kept it in the oven for 70 minutes and it still didn't cook all the way.  I think next time I'm going to put it in a 9x13 pan to see if it cooks more evenly that way.

This recipe is a winner. I baked it for Thanksgiving. I did it per the receipe but without the walnuts. My family loved it. It was moist and had a robust banana flavor. Absolutely loved it!

Just made this a few hours ago, and already we had to try it. This cake came out as moist as could be. I did add a little more mashed bananas because I had 4 to use up, and instead of nuts I used choc. chips. I thought nuts would make it taste too much like plain old banana bread, and I wanted it to be more of a  dessert. I will definately make this again. It realy came out of the bundt pan pretty. Great for company!

This cake is so moist and has such a great texture. I loved it. I added about 2 tsp. cinnamon and 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips just because I love the combination of flavors. Love the cake Thanks

Moist and dense, but not as dense as banana nut bread.  I subbed pecans for the walnuts.  Powdered sugar on top is a must.  Not sure if leftovers are any good because the whole thing was gone in 20 minutes...

I thought this was very similar to banana bread and added a cream cheese glaze(3 oz cream cheese, 3 T butter, 3 T milk, 1 tsp vanilla and 2 cups powdered sugar) to make it more dessert-like. My family absolutely loved it; it disappeared in one night. I liked it too, but it's really not sweet enough on without the glaze to be considered a cake. I'll definitely be making this again.

I have made this for the last 5 weeks in a row.
First let me preface my review by saying that I have made many banana cakes/breads using different recipes.  My husband has eaten them but never really commented. Even if he likes something, he isn't very verbal.  Only if he LOVES it.
1st time made as written - Husband and fussy kids loved it and asked for me to make it again (never happened with any other banana cake).
2nd time added packet of banana cream instant pudding mix. Family raved, raved raved.  Begged for another.
3rd time did not have sour cream.  Used a container of pineapple Chobani yogurt. Also added the pudding.  Was ok.  Family was silent.
4th time used french vanilla instant pudding mix.  Everyone loved, loved and was speaking to me again.
5th time - went back to banana cream.  Family still happy.

This is my go to recipe.  I have no need to go any further.  Comes out perfect everytime.  I did find that occassionaly I had to leave in the oven another 5-10 min.  I used a bundt pan.  I would strongly suggest testing and not assuming you need the extra time.  I think the pudding may impact that.
I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could.  It is delicious as written or with pudding.
Try it!!!!!!!

This was amazing!!! Great way to use up older bananas. I didn't have margarine and used oil instead and added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and skipped the walnuts for kids. Amazing!!! Made this in a bundt cake (awesome) but also made them as muffins for the hockey team and they were gobbled up. Cook at the same temp but for about 20 min. for standard sized muffins (makes 24-36 muffins depending on your pan size). Also, I didn't have sour cream so used no fat plain yogurt. If I could give this more than 5 stars I would!!!

I made two alterations to this cake- 1: I used Pamela's Gluten Free Baking mix instead of the flour , 2: I used vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream because it is what I had on hand.  It was delicious.  If you try to make it GF- add one extra cup of flour.

I used butter and non-fat Greek yogurt and I skipped the walnuts.  Baked in my two small bundt pans so I could give one away.  Very moist and good banana flavor.  I think I will glaze the give-away one just to add a finishing touch.  I will make this again.  In fact, I did save my altered recipe but did not intend to make it public as I did not edit the commentary nor the ingredients within the directions, thinking it would only be seen by me so if you stumble across it, my apologies for that faux-pas!

I doubled the recipe, because I had 2 full bunches ready for baking. Filled my 12-in. bundt pan and 6 cupcakes, for dinner company. I omitted the walnuts in cake. I poured the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site over top, sprinkled 1/3 cup walnuts over the glaze. It looked gorgeous and was a huge hit. A lot lighter than banana bread, It was exactly what I wanted. :D

Turned out very nice.  I substituted milk for the sour cream because I didn't have any on hand.  Worked fine.  I baked for 50 minutes, but it wasn't done in the middle.  So I turned off the oven and let the cake stand in the oven for another 10 minutes.  It firmed up nicely.

This was moist and rich like I hoped it would be, but it tasted to me like banana bread, not cake. I was hoping for more of a cake-like texture so it wasn't a favorite for me.

sooo good, and so easy to mix up and bake. follwed directions exactly and the cake was perfect. i know the poster said no icing needed, but as i was making this for Easter supper, i wanted it to be a little fancier, so i found a peanut butter glaze recipe on here and drizzled that over it. omg, to die for. this is going in my recipe box for sure, and may just replace the banana bread recipe i have as this is certainly a dense enough cake to have in place of banana bread.

The MOST MOIST banana cake I have ever had and made.  I always have trouble with banana bread, it's always too dry.  This turned out amazing on my first try.  I used 4 bananas (which was a little more than it called for), added a small box of instant vanilla pudding as suggested in other reviews, I used butter flavored shortening and added an extra tablespoon and a dash of water.  I baked it just as directed and it cooked all the way through.  My husband couldn't wait to try it and at first he thought it wasn't cooked all the way but it is very obviously cooked, it was just still so hot.  It's just that moist.  I will be making this recipe from now on instead of my bananas going to waste. I left out the nuts for my husband but I'm adding finely chopped pecans next time.

This light fluffy cake stood on its own, and is the perfect companion to morning coffee.   I did not have shortening, so I used butter.  I didn't have walnuts, so I threw in a handful of flax seeds, which added a nice nutty crunch, and gives me an excuse to have it in the morning - since now it's "healthy."    Next time I might add some cinnamon and fresh nutmeg.

I only used 3/4 cup of brown sugar, added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 3/4 cup chocolate chips.  I set the timer for 40 min. but wished I had checked it earlier as it was slightly overdone.  My family LOVED this cake, esp. still warm from the oven!

Love this recipe! Most of the ingredients were already in my pantry and I used yogurt instead and it turned out moist and delicious! This was the first banana cake recipe my boyfriend ever tried and he couldn't get enough.

Fluffy and moist. I used butter flavored shortening and substituited 1/4 cup of white sugar for brown sugar and a dash of cinnamon.

WONDERFUL!!  It was so moist and full of flavor!  I drizzled a powdered sugar glaze over the top, instead of sprinkling it on.  Cannot wait to make this for my guys again!  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

Made this twice for my teens.  Once I used choc chips and once thawed blueberry for the walnuts (have child alergic to nuts). What a wounderful cake. They ate it in one day.  I used marg instead of shortning/ yogurt for sourcream because thats what I had on hand.  It's now my go to cake for teens and grown ups because it not to sweet. Thanks Oma.

Loved it! I subbed margarine for shortening, but only because I had that on hand from a vegan recipe I was making. I omitted the nuts so more people at work could enjoy, but I think they would've been yummy in here! Certainly nothing extra needed to top this off...except maybe a dab of butter :) It baked beautifully in about 55-60 minutes, for me. Lovely recipe!

I don't ever do reviews, but I have made all kinds of banana breads and cakes (it's my favorite dessert) and this is by FAR the best. It's incredible. 

I substituted coconut oil for the shortening. So moist, so delicious.

Very moist and banana-y.  We were tired of all the summer fruit desserts so I wanted  something with bananas.  I too didn't want a banana bread look-a-like so I left out the nuts and had some leftover cinnamon/sugar from a previous recipe.  I filled the bundt pan half way with batter, sprinkled a thick layer of cinnamon/sugar, and filled with remaining batter.  It made a nice swirl in the middle and gave it a coffee cake flair.  I do agree with a previous review and think less sugar would be better next time, it is really quite sweet.

I tried this recipe, not only because of the 5 stars, but I also had sour cream on hand (fat free). I did not use shortening, but replaced it with applesauce. I reduced the sugar to just under a cup, and used three egg whites instead of two whole eggs. I also placed the batter in a 9 x 13 cake pan and sprinkled the top with cinnamon/sugar. This cake was so delicious and incredibly moist, that it was gone by the next day!

WOW!!! Fantastic!! I don't even really like or eat bananas but made this anyway for my family and we all are just crazy about it! I halved the recipe and made in 8 mini-loaf pans and topped with Vanilla Glaze from this website. Incredibly moist and just wonderful!

Wow!  I could eat the entire cake!  It is that good.  Very moist!  I added a small box of Banana Pudding mix and instead of sprinkling the confectioner's sugar I made a Vanilla Glaze from this site.

I made this recipe exactly as directed with the exception of using pecans instead of walnuts. This was excellent - it tastes just like banana bread but has a lighter texture like cake. We will definitely make this again. Thank you for the recipe!

I have made this cake numerous times and everytime it comes out perfect.  This is the one bundt cake recipes that does not overbake and get that too dark outside.  I gave one to the neighbor for taking my son to school and she told him it was better than her recipe.  I also tried it one day with 1 cup pumpkin and 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and came out wonderful.  This is in my favorite "gotta use the old bananas" recipe box.

I didn't have any sour cream, and I wanted to make this a dairy-free cake, so here's what I did -- used 3/4 cup of sugar, and beat eggs in one at a time, followed the rest of the directions as written, but added one cup of mayonnaise in place of the sour cream and shortening.  I used a wooden spoon and stirred in the flour, alternating with the mayo.  Instead of walnuts, I added 3/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I baked it in a dark bundt pan at 325F for 45/50 minutes (a lighter-coloured pan would need 350F).  This cake is delicious!!  My kids are crazy for it, and I hope there's some left when company comes for dinner tomorrow.  Definitely my go-to banana cake recipe from now on.

Dusted it with powdered sugar.   (TIP) I'd add the bananas later on in the recipe so they don't get too mashed up (I like having banana chunks)

This was astoundingly easy, and the result was terrific. I made it twice in one week. The first time I skipped the nuts and added blueberries instead. The second time I added chocolate chips. Both versions were a huge hit. This is definitely a keeper.

I thought this tasted pretty good...but it just seemed like banana bread baked in a bundt pan. I wasn't very impressed but the people at work all seemed to like it just fine as it was gone within a 12 hour shift. It sure is a lot prettier baked in the bundt pan!

I made two of these,one for church and one for us.The one I took to church was gone in a few minutes.5 different people ask for the recipe.I made it just like the recipe said,it was really better then the one we ate at home,because it  had a day to rest.I will be baking more of these but  I will make them the day before I serve them.My husband is pretty picky and he loved them both,he did agree that the one that sit over night was a lot moister and seem to have more flavor.Be sure you use very ripe bananas...This cake is very easy to make . While it was baking the whole house smelled just like my grandma,s house around the Thankgiving season.Thank You for another great recipe...Mary Ricki

This was exactly what I was looking for, something not as dense as banana bread.  This was light, yet moist and had just the right consistency.  I did cut back on the sugar a bit because I had very ripe bananas that add to the sweetness and I used 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 plain yogurt because that is what I had on hand.  The kids loved it, even without the chocolate chips, which I always put in banana muffins.  Thanks for the recipe...it's a keeper!

This cake was a BIG hit at the office! Moist, easy to make. No real tweaks on this except that I also added 1 tsp orange flavoring along with the vanilla. This recipe is a keeper!

As another review suggested, I added a 3 oz package of banana cream pudding to the dry ingredients, and about 1/4 cup or so of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.  It came out very dense and moist, although I think I could have baked it for a little longer (I used convection for over 60 min) and the inside bottom seemed a little mushy yet.

Absolutely delicious!  Moist, sweet, and held together well.  The only changes I made were to use chocolate chips instead of nuts and increase cooking time - added 10 minutes, then five more with the oven off.  Thanks for a new favorite way to use ripe bananas!

I really liked this, but it doesn't really have a cake texture, it's just a really awesome banana bread. I topped it with some whipped cream, chocolate syrup, and strawberries to make it more dessert like. I actually liked it a lot better plain. Like I said, awesome banana bread.

This was fantastic!!  I added a box of banana pudding mix to it, and used about 5 medium sized bananas (it was just a little over the 1 1/4 cups it calls for.  I baked for the 50 mins and  probably couldve used even a few more minutes.  (Maybe from the extra banana?)  I slides the cake horizontally into 3 layers and spread some buttercream frosting between the 2 layers. Fabulous! Making again for Easter this weekend!! THANKS! **** UPDATED***** Made again for Easter, used 3 large bananas this time and was JUST over the 1 1/4 cup, probably better amount, still added the box of banana pudding.  Baked at 350 for 50 mins and then turned oven off and let cake sit in oven another 7 mins.  Let cool and put in fridge overnight.  Then next day cut the cake into the 3 layers, was MUCH easier with COLD cake and used a serrated bread knife.  Used whipped buttercream frosting and then dusted the top with powdered sugar.  Was a big hit at Easter too!

Very good moist banana cake.  I was out of sour cream so I substituted lemon yogurt in one batch and raspberry cheesecake yogurt in another.  I added frozen blueberries to the recipe with lemon yogurt.  It was very good!  I haven't tried the other cake yet because I put it in the freezer for later.  Thanks for the recipe!

Not having every ingredient, I used 2 tsp of baking soda instead of the baking powder, butter instead of shortening, combined 1/2 cup of light cream and 1/2 cup of milk (adding 1tbs of lemon juice), used 3 large over-ripe bananas. I used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar. As previously recommended, the last 10 minutes of baking was spent with the oven OFF.  It turned out lovely, with texture between a fluffy cake and a dense quickbread - but a little sweet, so sugar could be further reduced. I shall also try with more banana next time.  A beautifully presented cake I can take anywhere. Thank you very much!

I made this cake for a friend's birthday- she requested a cake made with banana. The cake turned out very well-very moist-watch the time-my cake was done in 35 mins. I was hoping for something more cakelike, this tasted more like banana bread. I did frost the cake with the vanilla glaze as suggested, and added a little rum to the glaze. My friend loved the cake, and it did go over well at her party.

Fantastic, very moist cake.  I also substituted the sour cream with 1 cup fat free yogurt and it turned out great.  Since my husband and I have a sweet tooth, I also added 1/2 a cup of milk chocolate chips.  Delicious.

Very good for a banana nut bread. I was expecting something lighter because it's called a cake and it definitely a bread, so one star off for that. I was also expecting it to be more moist because of the sour cream. It wasn't. My regular banana bread recipe (which has no sour cream) is more moist then this, so another star off for that. It's a pretty "cake" and would be nice for presentation but will not replace my normal banana nut bread recipe.

Our family cannot have sugar, so I made it with Splenda and whole wheat flour.  I was wary, but it turned out delicious! More a nut bread than a cake, dense. It baked up shorter, but very moist.

Quite yummy!  I served it plain and it had a wonderful banana-e flavor.  I'm still looking for the "best" banana cake but this one is very good.  I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.

Wow! This cake is awesome! It's like banana bread in cake form. It's a little sweeter (like a cake should be), moist, and not quite as dense as banana bread. In other words...amazing! I followed the recipe as written and it turned out perfectly. I omitted the nuts and added chocolate chips as someone suggested. I also topped it with the vanilla glaze from this site that other reviewers recommended (which was also excellent). The glaze added to the overall presentation and it was delicious, but this cake could totally stand alone if you didn't want to go to the extra step of making the glaze.

What a great recipe! The only change I made was to use 2 cups of blueberries (I love blueberries) and leave out the pineapple. Moist, OMG!!!  Loved the idea of the coconut on the bundt pan.  I'll make this many times and will try it with the pineapple. Great to use for a tropical theme party or just a summer dinner.  Yumm!!!

Excellent. Moist and flavourful. I didn't have enough ripe bananas so I added 1/2 cup applesauce to compensate. Also added about 1 tsp. of cinnamon and a chopped up, unpeeled ripe pear - the pear made it FABULOUS! I also love the fact that it only has 1/3 cup fat - so many other recipes have a lot more fat.
Watch carefully as I only had to bake it for 45 minutes.

This recipe is just fabulous! Lovely, from scratch, soft and moist. It took me about 3 medium sized bananas and i used 3/4 brown sugar and the rest white sugar. I made a bundt cake and some banana cupcakes, and they were all delicious. I used the Vanilla Glaze recipe from this website and it was wonderful, beautiful and fun and very simple. This recipe is a keeper for sure. The taste is similar to banana bread but soft and moist like cake and definetly sweeter.

This was very good.  I' recommend that you leave it in the bundt pan for a while to cool.  I took it out of the oven, waited a couple minutes and then tried to dump it on the cookie sheet and the only half of the top came with it.  No real worries, though, it looked okay put back together with the powdered sugar on top.  I think it's definitely more 'cakey' rather than banana bread with the chocolate chips in it.  They're a necessity to sweeten it up.  I'd make it again.  It's easy, because I often have all the ingredients on hand.

Are you serious? This recipe is fabulous!   I used as many organic ingredients as possible and used Amish butter instead of shortening but other than that no other changes to the recipe. I fixed them like muffins and they came out super moist and super yummy!

WOW...this has to be thee best tasting banana cake by far.  I just tweaked a tad...i used 3/4 c. sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar. I added 1 t. cinnamon to flour mixture and instead of nuts (my kids don't like them), I used 1/2 c. cinnamon chips and 1/2 c. milk choco-chips.  Delicious!!!  We ate ours last night after dinner while it was still warm with yogurt ice cream....Thanks for such a wonderful and warming recipe!!!

This is really good.  The bananas make it very moist, and it has a light texture unlike banana nut bread.  A great use for bananas that aren't going to last much longer.

Very yummy!  Easy to make and used up the brown bananas.  The sugar on top was plenty of sweetness.  Stayed moist for two days and that's all the longer it lasted in my house :)

Delicious! This is a pure banana cake with great flavor.  I used Splenda, about 4 very ripe bananas and omitted the walnuts and it came out great!!  I also made a cinnamon glaze for it instead of just dusting it with powdered sugar as the recipe says to and it gave the little extra kick I was looking for!

IS there supposed to be a difference between banana bread and cake? Because I really don't detect a difference. This was a good cake for a child's birthday party, frosted with cream cheese frosting, and I will use this as my banana bread recipe in the future.

The cake came out wonderfully. I love cakes made with sour cream. Butter would've tasted richer than shortening. I used 4 brown bananas. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  I cut the sugar in half as suggested, used organic whole wheat pastry flour, and added allspice, nutmeg, and cinnamon as suggested by a spice cake recipe.  I also used butter and a cinnamon-sugar mixture instead of greasing/flouring the pan.  No need for icing, however, my boys poured chocolate syrup on their slices.  YUM!!!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I don't like to change recipes too much so that I can give an honest rating the first time around but I did add 1 tsp of Nutmeg to this one before baking.  It turned out great!  I'm adding this one to my recipe box!

I had some bananas that needed to be used up and didn't want to make the typical banana bread or muffins around here, so I decided to try this. It's amazingly moist and sweet, and was hugely popular with my husband and his office. I made it as written, though I put a butterscotch glaze on top instead of just confectioner's suger. (I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze off of this site, only using butterscotch chips instead of chocolate chips, and almond extract instead of the vanilla extract.) My husband said it was really good with the glaze, and he prefers it with glaze to without, but he did concede you can get away with just confectioner's sugar as well. A butterscotch glaze obviously makes it even sweeter. Either way, it's an extremely good bundt cake and I would most definitely recommend this recipe.

This recipe was absolutely delicious and very easy to prepare. It was moist and full of flavor. My family ate half of it within two hours of taking it out of the oven. We all agreed that we prefer this cake recipe over our favorite banana bread recipe. You can’t go wrong with this one.

I read many of the reviews and took the advice of a few adding some pudding mix. I added half a box of banana and half a box of vanilla and saved the rest for another batch. I also added chocolate chips and cinnamon to taste. It got rave reviews. It's a great recipe you can adjust to suit your taste.

Very good.  When baking with bananas, I often put the bananas in the freezer when they get ripe then pull them out to defrost a few hours before baking.  They don't look pretty, but the banana is completely softened and doesn't require much mashing.

EXCELLENT!! It definitely came out with the consistency of banana bread. But that was just fine with us!  I made it exactly as it says except, upon reading the reviews, I added 2 tsps of cinnamon and I did have to bake it for 60 minutes. Oh, I also didn't have shortening so I substituted an equal amount of butter.

I followed the receipe exactly. It turned out phenomenal. I used a fluted stoneware bundt pan. I didn't even need the powdered sugar. Next time, will try it with pumpkin and make a cream cheese glaze. This is an  excellent and easy recipe!

Super delicious!  I made this with butter instead and half brown half white sugar.  I also used low fat sour cream and didn't add the nuts.  I topped it with a simple powdered sugar glaze.  My kids loved it and requested it as their next birthday cake.  Thanks for the recipe.

I personally am allergic to bananas so I'm basing this review off of other's opinions. I sent it to work with my husband and it quickly became a favorite. It's very easy to make and uses ingredients I usually have on hand. They say it "tastes like banana bread but better." Sorry that's the best description I could get out of a bunch of guys ;) Thanks for a recipe that makes my hubby and his buddies happy!

Good, I checked it after 40 minutes of cooking and it looked done, so I took it out. It was actually a little dry, so next time I think I will take out after 35 minutes. Very good flavor, I think it would be good w/cream cheese frosting, but fine on it's own

I made this cake for my coworkers...They gobbled it up.  It was super moist with a very strong banana flavor.  I used really 5 ripe bananas that have turned completely black and I decreased the sugar to just a cup.  I didn't have sour cream so I used cream cheese instead plus 3 tablespoons of milk and I didn't add any salt.  This was a really great recipe and I will definitely make it again.

You could also classify this as Banana Bread...I have made this recipe twice in the past 7 days and love, love, love it! When cooking for my family I try to use as much as possible healthy ingredients. For this recipe I used 3/4 cups of organic cane sugar, a non hydrogenated shortening, and  unbromated unbleached white flour. Because I used very ripe bananas I chose to decrease the sugar. It was plenty sweet! ***Baking tip I learned in my cooking class...to avoid overcooking and drying out nut breads, shut the oven off to finish up the last 10 minutes of baking.

Quick, easy and delicious. After reading some of the reviews, I decided to add a heaped teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips. As I was adding the chocolate chips, I decreased the sugar down to 1 cup. One of the best uses for over ripe bananas!

Very moist and had a great flavor. I used 3 medium bananas and followed the recipe exactly. Thanks for a great banana cake recipe.

Scrumptious!  I don't do a lot of baking anymore, but I had some over-ripe bananas and was looking for something different from the old banana bread standby.  What a delicious cake!  I probably used a little more banana than was called for, did not add the nuts (allergies in the family), and added a generous tsp of cinnamon (yummm).  A wonderful finish to our Sunday dinner - thanks for the recipe.

Very good- I made it exactly per the recipe. Next time, I'll add chocolate chips as others have done.

Great cake.  Very moist and flavorful.  I used a few cups of the kids flavored yogurts instead of plain(4 oz. size).  Also, drizzled with store bought frosting heated a bit in the microwave over the top when cool.

Tasted like standard banana bread but made in a bundt pan.  I even added instant banana pudding mix to up the flavor but nothing spectacular.

So moist I couldn't believe it! I added chocolate chips to mine instead of walnuts and sprinkled a little bit of brown sugar on top. A huge hit with the family!

I made this cake for my mother-in-law's birthday.  Very little deviation from the recipe--added a little applesauce and cinnamon.  With sifted powdered sugar, it is very pretty.

The best cake!!! I have made it a few times for company and everybody loves it! I have made it following the recipe  (except I added chocolate chips instead of walnuts) and I have made it replacing strawberry apple sauce for some of the bananas. It turned out great every time! Thanks for the amazing recipe!

What a wonderful, quick and easy recipe.  I had some aged bananas on hand and this recipe looked great.  I had to substiture 6 tbsp. of butter for the shortening and cottage cheese for the sour cream, as that was what I had on hand.  I also had to increase cooking time by about 10-15 minutes.  I was afraid it might be 'too' moist, but it was great.  Everyone loved it.  I will definitely make again, and will try with the correct ingredients to see if that will be better.

Lord Love A Duck - Amazing.  Best Banana cake I've made in a long long time.  Not dry at all!    My husband doesn't like nuts, so I used coconut.  Wow... This is a keeper.  Thank you very much for posting it!

The BEST banana cake recipe I have ever tried!!  I ended up using about 1 and 1/2 cups of mashed banana, and I also added one cup of frozen Ghiradelli Bittersweet chips just before baking.  My cake was baked in a "Cathedral" style pan for one hour.  Perfect!!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe, it is so good!

This was a big hit in my house. Was looking for a recipe to use up some bananas that were going brown and came accross this. As someone mentioned I added choc chips to it. Think I overdid the Banana as this was a little soft but not gooey. They weren't eating slices they were taking huge chunks lol. It hadnt even cooled and half the cake was missing. I have been informed I should make this again. Thank you for a great recipe.

Very good and moist.  Better than the traditional banana bread because of the sour cream
