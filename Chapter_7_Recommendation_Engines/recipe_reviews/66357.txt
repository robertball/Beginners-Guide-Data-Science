The chicken part of this recipe was actually very good. Simmering it and then broiling it leaves it very tender on the inside and crisp on the outside. I love the flavoring. Regarding the deaa found it to be too watery...maybe it's my fault for using canned jalapenos but I really think it called for too much lemon juice. I ended up throwing it in a blending with some Greek Yogurt and it made more of a "sauce" which was quite good. As far as the rice and pita bread well this is where the recipe falls apart. It was WAY more rice than I needed. I would have made half. I also thought soaking the rice and pita bread in the stock was quite gross. It was really just soggy bread..and I even cut the stock in half. I'd definitely make this chicken and a "deea sauce" again but will leave out the soggy carbs!
