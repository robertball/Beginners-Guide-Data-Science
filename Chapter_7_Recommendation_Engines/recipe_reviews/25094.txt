I made this and we loved it but MUESLI??? For my second batch I cut the puffed rice from 7 cups to 5 and put in a cup of diced dried apricot and a cup of raisins. It's still beautiful eating and I might move further into the healthy stuff next time.

This is an amazing recipe everything about it the texture and the taste is great. I changed the chocolate pieces for raisins and added seeds and nuts and it was fantastic as a fairly healthy snack with no artificial flavours or anything.

I used raw unprocessed honey and followed the recipe exactly. Came out perfect no problem forming the bars. They were very good. Chocolate did melt but nobody seemed to mind. Cut them into individual squares and put them in the freezer. They thaw quickly and taste fresh. The whole family enjoyed them.

Very tasty yet 4 stars cause I could not get it to form into a bar. I was out of honey used sugar maybe thats why. Thanks for a great recipe though!

Wonderful recipe although I wouldn't go as far to eat it for breakfast (it's not quite that healthy) but definately an easy snack. My mother eats these like there is no tomorrow. Thanks for the recipe!!!

These bars are tasty! I halved the recipe and it still worked out great. Next time I will try adding a little bit less honey as it was a bit overpowering to the peanut butter using the ratio in the recipe. I waited a bit before adding the chocolate chips but as other reviewers not long enough cause they still melted in. Still got the peanut butter / chocolate taste but next time I'll try being a bit more patient.

I liked this recipe but next time I'd modify it a bit more. It was too sweet and not peanut buttery enough. I would also add more nuts dried fruit and skip the chocolate (carob) chips. As it was I didn't have almond butter so I used 1.5 c peanut butter. I forgot the vanilla. I also added raisins as some people suggested and let the coating mixture cool a bit before adding it to the oats and rice so it wouldn't melt the carob chips. It was definitely easy and made a lot of bars.

I really liked these bars a lot and they're very easy to make. They were sweet but the honey flavor wasn't overpowering as it is in some recipes. I thought the texture was great -- crispy and chewy not soggy. The one thing I would consider changing is letting the hot ingredients cool a bit before adding to the dry ingredients because the chocolate chips melted -- the bars tasted chocolatey instead of like the peanut and almond butter. They would also probably be very good without any chocolate chips.

I liked this recipe but noone else in the family did. The molasses adds a strange taste hard to get over for some people. Healthy though!

These tasted great but sort of fell apart. I wouldn't necessarily call them muesli bars either. I think almond butter is too spendy and didn't just have any on hand so I used 1.5 cups peanut butter and that worked just fine. I used white chocolate chips and added about a cup of raisins as well. Maybe I put too much "stuff" in. All in all a great snack.

very nice and a little goes a long way to satisfaction. Good for those who like snack bars and want to have control over ingredients and quality. I feel much better putting this in my husband's lunch than the processed sort:)

Husband says 4 I say 3. There is just something I don't like about how peanut butter tastes after it has been mixed with anything besides plain sugar I guess because I never like these sorts of bars with peanut butter & honey or corn syrup. Although to be fair the hot peanut butter mixture DID taste good while it was still syrupy--maybe it's the vanilla I object to? I'm not sure. Overall this was too sweet for me had an undertone I didn't like and the raw oats were a little difficult to mix in. This was very easy to make and I'm pretty sure it would be well-received by children even with "healthier" additions due to its overall sweetness and store-bought texture (and yes it has that Quaker chewy granola bar texture.) Thanks for the recipe! (Photo coming soon.)

These definitely didn't turn out as I expected. We can't really taste the peanut butter even though I used ALL peanut butter (and no almond butter). However for a recipe to use up the puffed rice cereal no one was going to eat anyway it was a success. I won't make it again though.

I am on a VERY restricted diet with no dairy soy or egg and it is very hard to find anything to eat on the go. I have really enjoyed these bars! i do make a few changes though: i up the amount of crushed almonds I add ground flax seed for nutrition (and you can't taste that it is there) and I use the Enjoy Life semi-sweet choc. chips (dairy and soy free). fantastic!

This is fantastic! It tastes like a cross between a granola bar and a rice krispy treat.
