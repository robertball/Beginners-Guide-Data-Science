I had to write a review of this. I was kind of skeptical about this recipe because it only had one review. I tried it and it is better than an actual Oreo cookie crust. The best part about it, is I always have the ingredients on hand. It was also very easy to put together.

I have made this recipe several times in the last few days.  The first time, I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  It was wonderful, except the sugar crystals crunched a little (might have been the brand of sugar).  My husband liked that; I didn't.  The second time, I used powdered sugar instead and liked the consistency of the crust much better.  Also, I reduce the sugar to 1 c. and even added subbed in some whole wheat flour with success.  I will never make an Oreo crust again!

I love this recipe because it tastes even better than an Oreo crust, and no food processor/ hammer is needed! Don't bake it for more than 10 minutes; otherwise, you'll get a hard shell instead of a crumbly crust (like the texture of a real chocolate wafer crust)

I came across this recipe while searching for a substitute to a cookie crust. I have a lot of cocoa powder at home and didnt plan to spend extra cash and time just to get myself a packet of oreo cookies for my latest dessert project (oreos are quite expensive from where I come from) so I wanted something quick and easy that could replicate an oreo crust (if not 100%, at least 70% of it) by using cocoa powder. And I FOUND IT!  Made a few adjustments though - I used powdered brown sugar and reduced the amount to half and substituted a 1/4 of the cocoa powder with black cocoa powder. The result: 'cookie-ish' dark bittersweet crust which was exactly what I wanted. Loved the texture, loved the taste.  THANK YOU for this great recipe. I most definitely will never ever buy cookies to make crusts again.

Wonderful recipe! Easy with just a few common pantry items. I am gluten (corn and egg) free and this was very adaptable to my dietary needs. I substituted sorghum flour for white flour with very good results. Really I think any flour would work: brown rice, buckwheat, millet or garbanzo! I'm so grateful I found this recipe!!!!

Tastes better than oreo! I was skeptical, cause I really like oreo. I multiplied recipe by 4 and made it in 2 cake pans still using same time.  Word of advice, if you make one to crumble and do a sloppy job putting it in pan cause you are planning to crumble anyways, and it gets cooked at different consistency, just go ahead and crumble when cooled and put back in a short time . It turned out great and looks great too! Thank you so much and for all the reviews that talked me into trying ! Update : I kept having issues of the pie shell sticking to the pan, so I started crumbling it all and really love cooking pudding and mixing the crust crumbled inside and on top and it's very good! Lots of people have loved it! The crust is a very good addition!

This tasted very good and a lot easier than crushing up chocolate cookies.  The only problem was that I cooked it longer than the 10 minutes, because it didn't look done to me and when cooled, the crust got too hard like another reviewer mentioned.  It is probably perfect at 10 minutes like the recipe says.

This was very easy and tasted great, like a famous cream filled sandwich cookie. I made it as a base for a chocolate espresso cheesecake and since it was still slightly warm when I poured the batter in and baked, the top sort of melted and created a very thin layer of gooey chocolate between the crust and cheesecake. Some guests commented that the crust was the best part of the dessert, lol

The flavor of this crust is pretty good. My preference is for chocolate graham cracker crust, which tastes better IMO. The crust does not have the exact same consistency and texture as a chocolate wafer crust or graham cracker crust. It's not as crumbly. Also, the wafer and cracker crusts are more forgiving if you happen to have some spots where the dough is thicker.  With this crust, thick spots turned into solid cookies that were impossible to cut through. Be careful to press it evenly and thinly in your pie plate or spring form pan. I baked it in a glass pie plate and it stuck to the plate pretty bad. Next time I try it, I'm going to butter the pie plate before pressing in the dough. With these couple of things in mind, the recipe is a keeper. In a pinch, when no chocolate graham crackers or wafers are on hand, this crust comes to the rescue.

Great and easy crust.  I do lower the sugar to 1 cup, though, and careful about that temp and cooking time or it will harden - still yummy, but almost impossible to slice!

This crust is so good with chocolate cheesecake!  Thanks for adding this recipe.  I live way out in the country and appreciate recipes to make things that I can't always get to the store to purchase when I want to make something.

I cut the recipe in half to try it for one pie. It turned out well, was easy to mix together, press in the pan, and was quick to make. It is sweet, but it is quite similar to the store bought chocolate crust in taste and texture.

I used this crust for a Nutella Pie. I followed the recipe exact. My whole family raved about this crust--my husband made the comment that this was ten times better than an Oreo cookie crust. Awesome recipe.

I added about 2 rounded tablespoons of  flour; subbed freshly ground, raw, organic cacao nibs for the unsweetened cocoa powder and lessened it to one 1/2 cup; subbed unrefined, organic, cold-pressed coconut oil for the butter and increased it by one tablespoon and one teaspoon; finally I baked it at 325°F on a convection oven setting for 7 minutes and 30 seconds.  NOTE: I live 1600 feet above sea level. The crust came soft, tender, and crumbly with a pie crust in a non-stick pan.  I will update my review when I get the results from a glass pie dish.

Thank you Purple Baker!
I really love this recipe! Sometimes you need a classic chocolate cookie crust, but who wants to use Oreo cookies which are chock full of glucose-fructose, chemicals and other junk? This recipe is even better than the typical oreo cookie crust. THANK YOU! Delicious!

Since going gluten free, I have avoided recipes that called for a cookie crust. It's hard to find a cookie comparable to Oreos that is easily found. A finally came across a chocolate peanut butter pie recipe that motivated me to find a substitute for cookie crust. I came across this recipe and would highly recommend. I used Cup 4 Cup gluten free flour in place of all purpose. It worked beautifully. I got a lot of compliments on the crust.

Yum! I have made this for several things - the base of a cheesecake as well as mud pie (used this as the crust and the middle layer "crumble") and it always gets rave reviews.  It has a more cocoa flavor than Oreo crust for sure, so if you're looking for crunch with a nice cocoa flavor, this is ideal.  It makes a lot, I was able to cover an entire 9" deep dish pie plate and sti have plenty leftover.  This is a keeper!

Very good and couldn't be easier! I tried this recipe because I couldn't find chocolate wafer cookies in ANY of our local stores. We actually liked this recipe better than our usual chocolate cookie crust! I'm glad the cookies were out of stock everywhere! This will now be our regular chocolate cookie crust for our white chocolate peppermint pie.

I am going to try this again but I felt like I was crunching on sugar.  There is a similar comment in one of the reviews where the second time they used a cup of powdered sugar instead.  I kept thinking when I made it, this is too much sugar, and why am I not using powdered?  I normally make chocolate graham cracker crust and even my 11 year old daughter complained.  It was like chewing sugar.  

I wan't to throw the desert out that I made but my wife says she likes it.  I am going to try this again following the directions and then I will try it with less & powdered sugar.  All I can think is that I screwed it up somehow and doubled the sugar.

After reading the ingredients I have to think I confused a 3/4 cup with a 1/2 cup so I am just going up from 3 starts to five right now.  It was 50% too much sugar.  The only plausible excuse

P-E-R-F-E-C-T! Used this crust in a springform pan to make a decadent chocolate mousse cake. Did not change one thing. I flattened the crust on the bottom and up the sides of my pan, baked for exactly 10 minutes (as the recipe says), and let it cool on my counter. Filled with the homemade mousse and chilled. This crust is excellent.

Love, love, LOVE this recipe.  I’ll never use Oreos for a crust again. This is so easy and with basic ingredients, you can’t go wrong. The taste is delicious and chocolatey as well.

This was so good that my kids flipped their Raspberry White Chocolate Cheesecake over and ate the crust off the bottom.  From now on, I'm saving my Oreo's for dipping in milk, which is as it should be.  No need to crush them up for a pie crust.  This recipe is terrific!  **Update**  Some sugars are not ground finely enough to give this crust a smooth consistency.  I have found I prefer to make this in my blender.  I blend all the dry ingredients, then add the butter while blending.  Since doing this, I have not had any grainy sugar problems.

Stuck big time to the pan. I'm thinking that I'm going to have to grease and flour the pan first. it's like a cake. A little flat cake.

This is much better than using Oreos. I will always go back to this recipe. As someone is said, I always have the necessary ingredients on hand.

I have only used this for the no-bake peanut butter pie ( https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/12181/no-bake-peanut-butter-pie/ ) on this site. It's delicious, and no one would know it isn't really made from chocolate wafers. With only four ingredients (I use salted butter so I didn't add the salt) and nothing I can't pronounce - unlike the store bought kind - it's also very easy to make. Just be careful not to overbake! It might have been my oven, but I did taste a little scorched the first time I made it, so I check it at 8 minutes.

It was great. Had all the ingredients, so was much easier than chocolate wafer or oreo crumbs.

If you don’t have Oreo cookies and you’re in a bind, The this is a good substitute recipe for a chocolate cookie crust, but in my opinion it still doesn’t beat the real thing.

I never write reviews but this recipe deserves it.  I was making a chocolate cheesecake but only had graham cracker crumbs.  I just didn't want to go to the store again for Oreo cookies!  I ended up making 2 batches.  After making the crust, I laid the 2nd batch out on a tray keeping it loose with varying sizes of chunks and baked for 15 mins (check after 10.)  I wanted them to be somewhat crispy.  I then made a New York style cheesecake and dropped the chunks into the batter and stirred it around a bit.  The only chocolate chips I used were on top and to be honest, were unnecessary.  Next time I'll put the chunks on top as well.  They're less sweet.  I'll also cook them a tad more making them even crisper.  The texture of the cookie chunks was a pleasant surprise to everyone and to say the least, the cheesecake was a hit.

I love this crust.  Made with gluten free flour, it offers a great option for those sensitive tummies that can't have Oreos.

Loved this crust and so did my guest .  I used it with a no-bake chocolate cheesecake and got rave reviews. Will make again but will try it with powdered sugar or superfine sugar as I wasn't crazy about the sugar crystal effect.

Very easy to make and shape into the pan. Flavor is wonderful! I'm using this for a chocolate mousse pie. I'll use it for my next chocolate cheesecake.
