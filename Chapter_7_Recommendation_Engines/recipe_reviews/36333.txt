This rub wasn't bad. The brown sugar did add a nice hint of sweetness. I added a little bit of garlic to it. I used it on two ribeyes and left it on for two hours.  I think the flavor didn't come through as much because you have to rub a small amount of olive oil on the steaks before using the rub.

I really liked this.  I used it for steak and I used it for steak sandwiches the other day.  It really gave a great added kick to the meat without overpowering it.  Thanks.

I used this rub on two ribeye steaks; let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours and it turned out wonderfully!  I did add 1 tsp of garlic powder to the rub but left out the oregano leaves.  I'll use this recipe for my steaks from now on.

This rub was great, I was looking for something different, I usually just use Montreal Steak Spice when I fix steak. I didn't put any oregano in it because that wasn't the flavour I was looking for but I'm sure it's great with it in there, maybe next time. Instead I did add garlic powder. This was so yummy! Thanks!

This was wonderful.  My husband and I are HUGE Montreal Steak fans.  We use it on everything (it's really good on bacon).  I don't like oregano, so we left it out.  We will make this again and again.  Can't wait to try it on Pork Chops!

Recipe's great! I used this rub for basically anything-- green beans, asparagus, baked potatoes, mashed potatoes, even corn on the cob. It's always a must-have for those hot summer grilling nights! YUM =)

This was the best marinade/rub recipe I've ever used. I can't wait to try it on a ribeye steak.
I marinated the steaks in olive oil for 2hrs before I applied the rub.

Great taste.  I like to use this rub on a tri-tip roast and grill it.  Montreal seasoning is the best for beef!  Try it on elk and deer too.

Delicious!  Husband said it was the best steak he'd ever had (with the exception of the Capitol Grille in Philly).  I add a 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  DON'T forget to allow the steaks to come to room temperature before grilling.

Both my husband and I very much enjoyed this rub. Very easy to throw together. We had 2 large Ribeye steaks that we decided to grill for dinner tonight last minute and I had everything to make this rub so we thought we'd give it a shot. It was a bit peppery but maybe that's because I didn't use it for 4 servings like suggested. I used all the rub on our 2 steaks. It tasted a bit like a peppercorn steak you'd order in a restaurant.

Absolutely wonderful variegation of the Montreal Steak seasoning. I doubled the quantity as I used it on a small boneless rib roast. I slow grilled to medium rare and it came out perfect. My bride raved on it and I truly loved it, also. It's in my box.

Way too spicy for my liking. I thought the brown sugar would perhaps tone it down, but no such luck.

This had a nice flavor but make sure you don't skimp on the amount of rub. The more the better. I also didn't use the specific brand and I don't think it would make a difference!

This simple rub is excellent.  It has a distinct herbal flavoring without being overpowering.  I used it on a Ribeye and broiled it to medium...a pleasant suprise.

My husband thought this was o.k. but I didn't like it.  I thought it tasted a bit to spicy/peppery.  Probably will stick to marinades.

This is delicious!! I'm not a big steak eater but I like them occasionally. Now i might eat them more often with this rub! My whole family and I loved it, even my 6 yr old. I didnt need any steak sauce or anything to spice it up. it was great alone. Perfect blend of spices and sweetness to create its own flavor.

This was pretty tasty - liked the sweetness of the brown sugar with the spicy seasonings.  Definitely made a cheap cut of meat much better.

This was sooooo good.  I doubled the brown sugar and used fresh oregano from my herb garden.  I used it on ribeyes.  The flavor was fantastic and didn't overpower the steak.  This has become my favorite rub.

Liked the rub, and I usually just use the seasoning as a marinade- but this was great! I added the garlic salt as another person had suggested, but needed to cut that back just a little.  This was very good though, made it for company and will make again!

This is an easy and delicious recipe.  I made the full mixture and used about half on a large strip steak.  I used a Spicy Montreal Steak Spice, but didn't find the steak to be too hot to eat.  I saved the rest of the rub for future use.

Great flavor... and we only rubbed the steaks an hour before we grilled them (gotta love that George Foreman in the winter!).  The brown sugar added just a hint of sweetness, not too much.
