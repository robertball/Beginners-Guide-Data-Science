These cookies came out too hard and tasting like pure sugar way too sweet - we couldn't even taste the chocolate at all. It was like putting a spoonful of sugar in your mouth. I read another review which mentioned confectioner's sugar (powdered sugar) - I took the recipe above to mean granulated sugar maybe that was the mistake?

The dough was a little too thick but the powered sugar made up for it

These cookies reminded me of a chocolate cinnamon cookie that I made in baking school. The Dutch-processed cocoa is a must! If they are too hard then you cooked them too long.

When I made these the "dough" was like cake batter. I added a lot more flour and it still was not the consistantcy of dough. What did I do wrong? The cookies that resulted tasted good but I had to drop them instead of roll them.

Great recipe! Thanks for sharing it. Followed the recipe to a tee. Great for making sandwich cookies or chocolate crust for cheesecake...

Spectacular! Roll in granulated sugar then 10X sugar for best appearance. Only makes about 15 cookies-double or triple batch.

The batter was almost like a mousse and it didn't have a deep chocolate taste so instead of adding flour I added about a quarter cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and chilled the batter till it firmed up just a little. If you're going to roll it in confectioner's sugar put a thick layer to get that bright white spotted look otherwise it just cooks into the cookie. Once I tasted the cooked cookie I remember a packaged cookie that's very similar in taste but had that granulated sugar with the slightly bigger chrystals on it. That's the route I'm going next time for these super tasty cookies!

These turned out great! I used Maple Syrup instead of the corn syrup and rolled the cookies in powdered/icing sugar and they were delicious. Soft and chewy and a big hit with the whole family.

No matter what I tried I couldn't get the pretty white crinkling effect to the extent as shown in the photo.:( I subbed 1/2 cup cocoa for 1/2 cup flour but should've added the extra flour anyway. They were very mousse-like like another reviewer said and hard to roll in the granulated and then powdered sugar. Next time I'll use more flour; maybe that'll help with the crinkle look. Flavor (with the extra cocoa) was very good. I am rating this on what I expect the original recipe would have been without the cocoa. I think it needs the extra chocolate flavor - I'd rate it a 4 if it had that as well.

Mine came out flat and not very sweet. What did I do wrong?
