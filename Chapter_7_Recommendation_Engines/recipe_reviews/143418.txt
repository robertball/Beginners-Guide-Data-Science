I made these for my in-laws to top off our appetizer dinner. My FIL raved about them and even added whipped cream. I liked them, they reminded me of fair food. Kind of like a funnel cake coating with a strawberry inside. Making them, I halved the strawberries after cutting the tops off. The batter to coat them was VERY thick. I finally just got my hands in there and got messy trying to coat the strawberries, then just dropped blobs of batter with strawberry into the hot oil. Eating them, I wasn't sure if I liked the warm strawberry or not...it is kind of a taste sensation! I loved the chocolate sauce and pwdrd sugar and whipped cream, all of that went together wonderfully with the coating...I am just not sure if I like a warm strawberry, LOL! But 5 stars for such an original and fun recipe to make, thanks so much Austin! I can't wait to make more of your recipes! ~Tan~

Oh my yummy strawberry goodness! I had some berries and some cream, and wanted to make something different. I'm so glad I found this recipe! I made it exactly as posted, and it was perfect in every way.

It was pretty darn good! kind of reminded me of strawberry shortcake. The fritter batter turned out too thin so ended up having to add more flour. Also, I think instead of semi-sweet that dark chocolate would add a little more contrast. I plan on making this again and changing the ratio of dry to wet to make it a thicker batter with still a lot of taste. Great alternative to cakes or chocolate covered strawberries!

I guess my family and I just don't like warm strawberries... I give it a three as it was a good recipe, just not something we cared for at all...

I would prefer a thicker batter.
