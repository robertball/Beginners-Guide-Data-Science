This was really good. I served it over whole grain couscous topped with freshly grated parmesan cheese.

I was spending too much money going to a mexican place that his entire food was beyond amazing and one of my fav items was shrimp diablo burritos and quesaldias. Now after I looked it up and found this I gave it a try and bought tortilla and made this recipe with minimal revision (only added 1tbs of brown sugar and more red chili flakes to spice it up and 2tbs of Parmesan for texture). This was a bomb. I don't think I am eating diablo from next door anymore. This tasted exactly similar and even better. So I made double portion and saved/froze the rest as meal prep for next time . Thanks alot

Wow!  Watch out for so much red pepper flakes - really hot!  You have to like hot & spicy a lot to use so much.  Start with a little bit and add to your taste.  Other than than great recipe!!

I made this but with chicken not shrimp. So good. Would love to try it next with shrimp. I also did not have wine so used chicken stock. Was really good. I love spicy food and so does my husband.

Personal opinion - this is MAGIC over rice! It is spicy, which means as is my boys (4 and 2) wouldn't eat it. However, easing back on the red pepper flakes would probably make a big difference, so if you're not into spicy, reduce. I used white cooking wine as opposed to white drinking wine, and it worked just fine. Will DEFINITELY be making this again!

Pretty good, just remember to keep stirring the shallots and garlic because it burns easily!
