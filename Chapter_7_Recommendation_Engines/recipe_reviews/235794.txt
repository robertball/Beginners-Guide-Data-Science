I left out the ricotta and after I sauteed the cubed eggplant I added the cooked ground beef and spaghetti sauce to the same pan. I use 2 large eggplant and cut about 6 slices out of each and cubed the rest. I added some fresh basil, italian seasoning and oregano to the sauce. I used about 1 1/2 cups of parm cheese for the inside of the casserole and 1 1/2 cups with the panko breadcrumbs for the topping. I made it in a 9x13 pan.

This was tasty. I had to make a few changes because I did not have all the ingredients. I added artichoke hearts as I was short one eggplant and I will probably make that change permanent for future times. I also sliced the eggplant more thinly because I needed to get 10 slices from one eggplant. I feel this helped with folding them in half. I also added chicken to the marinara sauce. I was looking for more of a all in one baked dish. In the future I will decrease the marinara sauce as it was too much for me. I found this took longer to cook and prep than estimated but I find most recipes take longer than stated. This will be one I cook again and again.

We LOVED this recipe. My boyfriend raved about it with every bite. Everything went together so well and the browned crust on top was perfection. This was my first time cooking with eggplants and I was a little concerned about how they would turn out (I've heard they can taste bitter if they're not perfectly ripe) but they were fine and the recipe only brought out he best in their flavor. The only change I made was in regard to the cheese filling: instead of folding over the slices, I layered several eggplant slices on top of the marinara base, then aded the cheese, then added another layer of slices. The slices I had seemed a little too small to fold over. I also used panko bread crumbs. Definitely a keeper recipe.

We have a large family so I made 9 servings.  I substituted the pepper jack cheese with an Italian blend that has asiago, provolone and mozzarella because I like the softer cheeses in Italian cooking. I also added an egg to the ricotta to make it less dense. The red pepper added a nice spice to this delicious meatless dish. Instead of making little 'taco' filled eggplant slices, I layered them and baked them in my extra large iron skillet. This did take almost 2 hours from beginning to end to make, but it was well worth it.

This recipe was really delicious! I left out the ricotta cheese because I didn't have any and honestly, I would never use it in the future because it was so good without it...which saved lots of calories!

Even though I liked this dish, my kids did not.  It was a blander than I was expecting and the crumb topping was too overwhelming.  If I make this again, I'd add some thyme or basil to the cheese mixture and cut back on the crumb topping.  I also think you could save time by cutting the eggplant in medallions and creating layers.  I would recommend roasting or pan frying the eggplant since it tends to be a little mushy if you don't.

I made this tonight for the first time; I did not change a thing; I did use my own home made marinara sauce.  I think the prep time is a little optimistic, though; it did take me a little longer than 15 minutes to prepare, but other than that, this dish is perfect.  This was a test run for me because I was thinking of serving it to company, so I wanted to try it out first.  Husband loved it as well.   I will never make eggplant any other way.

I really liked this recipe.  First time I ever made an eggplant anything and my meat and potatoes man asked for 2nds.  I sure he still prefers his meat and potatoes but I am glad he ventured off the beaten path and enjoyed something else.

Another winner from Chef John!  This was easy, healthy, and delicious. It's going into the 'keeper' file for sure.  Even my vegetable-hating husband loved it!

Unfortunately, like many of your vegetarian recipes, this is not vegetarian.  Cheese is made with rennet which is made from the lining of a calves stomach, an animal product.  Only kosher cheese or one made from a plant based rennet should be considered vegetarian.

My husband loved it, however, after preparing it, I realize that I prefer the "traditional" Eggplant Parmesan made with mozzarella and eggplant that is fried and breaded.  I did follow the recipe as written, omitting just the garlic and red pepper flakes, as I used another Allrecipes recipe to make the marinara sauce which in itself had garlic and red pepper flakes.  If I were to prepare this parmesan, again, I would try adding mote pepper jack cheese because it did seem lost in the ricotta cheese.  I would also add a pinch of dried basil and dried oregano to the ricotta to give it more character.  The bread crumbs were good but I think if I used melted butter instead of olive oil, the bread crumbs may feel a boast.  Again, all was not lost, my husband is a fan and the reason for a 4 rating.  While, regardless, I am a fan of Chef John.

We loved this recipe and I’ve made it twice now. I tweaked it a little by using two slices of eggplant with mixture in middle instead of taco technique and added fresh spinach to cheese mixture mad in between. It’s amazing!!!

Great recipe! Easier, less time, less oil.... than the conventional eggplant Parmesanthat I have been making for the past 40 years. 
 My friends  said how can you improve on “Perfect “ and I invited them for dinner and showed them how with this new recipe!

I breaded the eggplant first and baked it at 400 for 25 mins and layered it instead of dicing and mixing in the pan, but basically the same ingredients.  I did add some roasted garlic and freshly wilted spinach and thin sliced Brussels sprouts for additional nutrition. Easy way to hide veggies from kids!!

I really wanted to love this, but I did not. It was more bland than I expected (I even added fresh basil after it was finished cooking). I think the bread crumbs were too overpowering. I like the idea of this recipe, a cross between eggplant parm and lasagna, so I think I will try again but will tweak it.

This recipe was delicious!  I added a little extra seasonings to my sauteed garlic and eggplant to enhance the flavor. I also switched the pepper jack cheese for mozzarella, no other changes and it turned out perfect.

This would get 5 stars, but it is a fair lot of work for what it is. Next time, try using a rich pre-made marinara sauce (still homemade, but used in a previous dish) to reduce the work.  C gives this a 9* rating -- and toddlers loved it with spiral pasta. Because real parm cheese is hard to find/expensive, I used half salty cheese from market and used decent cheddar instead of pepper jack.

This was my first go at eggplant. I adjusted for my family and added mushrooms, an onion, and pound of hamburger as well as doubling it. Instead of frying the sliced eggplant we dipped in egg then breadcrumbs and baked at 350 for 8 min per side. Next time we decided we would skin all the eggplant as we didn’t care for it. My mom, stepdad, kids, boyfriend everyone devoured this over a day. Everyone’s first time ever eating eggplant and they are already asking for it again tho it may be a bit. It took us way longer than the hour and 20 minutes stayed. Worth it though. Love love love

I thought this recipe was really good. My first time ever eating eggplant and I was pleasantly surprised. I even had seconds. I did however use my own homemade meat sauce. I would definitely make this again. As always I suggest using a recipe as a guideline and tweaking it to your own liking.

I followed recipe to the tee, but i also added an egg to ricotta mixture. We both really liked this recipe and will make it again. But the prep time was WAY off...about 45 mins?

This is absolutely the best Italian style casserole.   I had previously breaded and baked eggplant and homemade sauce with hamburger and sausage in it that I pulled from the freezer.  That just amped it up.

My daughter brought home the biggest eggplant from a farmers market that I've ever seen. This recipe seemed a perfect way to use it. Sliced eggplant 1/4 inch thick and used cayenne and cajun seasoning since I was out of crushed pepper. it smelled Heavenly coming out of the oven and tastes like a lighter version of lasagna. Definitely a keeper!

This was okay to me. I am not big on eggplant to begin with. I am trying to do more vegetarian options and it was worth making. I will probably make it again.

I made mine a little differently, however, I kept to the original recipe.  I just put the sauce as a base then I cut round slices of eggplant and put them over it, I also fried up onion, mushrooms and garlic and put that over the top of eggplant and ricotta cheese, then more sauce, parmesan and tasty cheese.  Yum!

Only changes I made were adding fresh basil leaves (about 15 finely chopped) into the cheese mixture and topping the cheese mixture with artichoke hearts.  I used about 8 oz of  hearts that I chopped and spread evenly on top of the cheese mixture.  I was concerned it would be too much bread crumb topping but it wasn't...just delicious!  Thanks Chef John!!!

Easy, quick, healthy as you want to make it.....and very tasty.
I added some cooked Hamburg to the dish for the meat eaters in the house but that is clearly optional.  Will definitely incorporate this into our meal plans!

This is a kinda time consuming recipe. But it's yummy! I thought it needed something more so I added ground beef to the marinara sauce. Also thought it a bit runny so made noodles and put over them. Good recipe. I would make it again.

I made the topping with gluten free panko, and used less than in recipe.  Preparation took 45 minutes!  I substituted fresh ricotta for the pepper jack cheese.

I wouldn't change a thing. This recipe is perfect! I'm a big fan of Eggplant Parmesan, and I was intrigued by the thought of making it in a casserole. I wasn't disappointed, I'll be making this again...

So fun to make and absolutely delicious.  I used a 9x13 casserole dish and Trader Joe’s marinara due to time constraints.  Will definitely make again.

Wasn’t sure I liked the crumbs on top as they were kind of mushy even tho they browned and for some reason it had too much juice! It took me forever to prep it about 2 hours! I was expecting it to be easy but it was not! Thus I rated it a 3.

Very good. Needs more cheese. BTW it freezes well. Cook first then put in oven at 350 for an hour or so.

This was terrific! Very easy. I know people make changes and usually I read the reviews before I make a recipe to check in. The only change I made was to add sliced mushrooms with the chopped up zucchini. The hardest, or most difficult part of this recipe, was to not eat the cooked slices of zucchini while I’m waiting for the other parts of the recipe to come together!

Big hit.  I only had small Japanese eggplant, so didn't fold them.  Stacked them instead.  The breadcrumb topping is fantastic - will be using it in other dishes also!

Oh wow! This has completely changed how I make eggplant Parmesan.  It is so much better, easier and fewer calories. My husband usually has some issues with vegetarian meals, but he loved this.

This recipe was delicious. The whole family loved it. The crispy breadcrumbs on the top are a good addition to this casserole. I substituted mozzarella cheese for the pepper jack. That was just a personal taste change and it worked well. This recipe is a keeper and one to share!

I actually made this as a larger batch since I had extra eggplant and my family loves eggplant. I have saved this recipe as it is fantastic! I also used a few additions I had in my frig and pantry, but the basic recipe is great as written, I hope your family enjoys it as much as our son did!

I really enjoyed this.  Taste great.  Only change it had to make was putting more pepper jack cheese on top of the crumbs. The crumb mixture was really dry near the end of cooking and was like loose sand.  Even with that I still give it 5 stars because it tastes really great. I will definitely make this again.

I don't know but I didn't enjoy it as much as the traditional style, fat calories be damned, I like the crunch on the eggplant not in a topping, may be silly,  I cut the skin off the egg plant, always do, but I still wasn't wowed, John I still love u even if u haven't come up with a recipe for Brandy Alexander Pie

It's not vegetarian, as written. Parmesan cheese is not vegetarian..... So take out the parm and it's a vegetarian recipe. I added more of the italian seasonings and it turned out fine.

We loved this recipe..and it was so simple to make...the crispy topping as soooo good.The only thing I wished I did differently would be to use my homemade spaghetti sauce. That would have made it over the top...Thank you for such a great recipe...I will definitely be making this again!

I made half of this recipe for 4 of us and it was plenty.  It is a real hit in our house.  It  is just spicy enough to make it seem very different for our usual eggplant parm.  Really like the taco like slices and then the chopped  in sauce.  The ricotta is a lovely addition.  It will be made many more times that is for sure.

Did not have pepper jack cheese, used an Italian blend suggested by another reviewer.  My recommendation to myself, not a big fan, substitute another cheese for half of the parmigiana cheese. Otherwise, the dish is very good; always glad to find something my wife likes

Yum.  I felt like it needed a tiny bit less spice and a little bit less breadcrumbs.  Maybe a little less sauce, but I typically don't like my pasta terribly saucy.  Tasty!

Good recipe!!!  Didnt miss the traditional breading on the slices of eggplant, just sautéed lightly in oil.  
( I used more because the eggplant soaks it up).  I also just laid the eggplant flat and spread cheese over it, then topped with the sauce.. Used less breadcrumbs on top also.  Very tasty meatless casserole!

Used one larger eggplant and got 6 slices. Easily enough for 3-4 servings - I halved the recipe with the only exception of maybe using a bit extra marinara sauce.

It was good and filling I just wish I would have took the skin off of the eggplant. After reheating it was just mush and  and tough skin.

Delish...I made some changes (smaller amount and used ichiban eggplant).  I also had some left over hamburger that I cubed up and sauteed it a bit with the eggplant to heat it up. I used my own sauce to make it up sooner.  It was really good!

I love this recipe so much that I made it 4 times in the last 3 months, each time for a different audience and all loved it. I think the 4th time is the best and most flavorful. The first 3 times I got great compliments but all commented it needed a bit more kick.

Nice recipe and a good mix of cheese, eggplant and sauce.  I used smaller eggplant so instead of stuffing and folding the slices, I made little eggplant sandwiches with the stuffing. Worked perfectly!

Chef John! I love folding the eggplant and using minimal oil! Lucky enough to have pepper jack & parm on hand I substituted cottage cheese for ricotta as I was out. Due to cutting carbs I also substituted flax seed for bread crumbs. Certainly this is prone to the flavors embedded in your marinara, mine was a recipe found on this site (substituted homegrown tomatoes for stewed, added ground fennel & spinach and it was FANTASTICALLY AUTHENTIC! 
I've been a long time eggplang parm fan but didn't care for the breading, usually soggy. This is the only way to make eggplant parmesan for me! Thank you Chef John!

Incredibly delicious! I used 1/2 sauce from leftover Albondigas turkey meatballs that Chef John made in a different recipe and 1/2 tomato basil Classico.  I subbed ground flax seeds for bread crumbs and used fresh Parmesan.  About 10 minutes prior to finishing baking I sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top. Winner, winner, eggplant dinner. If I could I would give 6 stars. Bon apetit!

My eggplants were extra large so I ended up with 12 slices.  I used about 1 1/4 cups ricotta,  packaged Italian Blend grated cheese (parmesan, mozzarella, romano)  and served it with angel hair pasta.  Delicioso!  It's cheap, easy, and healthy.  LOVED it!

Tasted great but I wasn't happy with the bread crumb topping. The  breadcrumbs were too fine and didn't bake together and it was just a layer of dusty crumbs on top. Have to figure out a change to the topping but eggplant and cheese was great!

Followed directions as written. Finished product had a lot of marinara sauce. The marinara sauce and cheese was the primary flavor and somewhat overwhelmed the eggplant. Enjoyed making it and glad I tried it, but don't plan to make again. Thanks!

My husband used this recipe but he didn't fold the slices of the eggplant. He just layered slices of eggplant and ricotta cheese in the pan. He confessed that next time he makes it (I requested this to be on our Fall/Winter menu) he will follow the recipe as is and fold the eggplant slices. I found the flavors to be wonderful, not too cheesy. This one is a keeper.

I appreciate this recipe as a base, but I definitely reworked it.
I used less than 3 tblespns of Olive Oil.
I lightly sprinkled the breadcrumbs on top of the layer of sauce (which I made from scratch from our garden's tomatoes, green pepper, basil, rosemary, and thyme!) and then added the topping of cheese. 
I cubed the eggplant and after lightly coating it in Oil, sauteed it, along with some green bell and red hot pepper. While that was happening, I grilled 3 chicken breasts on the BBQ. Once they were done, I shredded them into the bottom of 2 shallow casserole dishes, topped with sauce, breadcrumbs, a little more sauce, cheese - popped into the oven until the cheese bubbled and VOILA!! :D

Eggplant was 2 for 3 bucks at QFC, so I went searching for an idea of what to make with it. This was awesome. I probably overcooked the eggplant, didn't realize how much extra they would cook while resting. The lesson as always is listen to Chef John. Didn't have ricotta so I subbed a mixture of cream cheese and cottage cheese. Not as good as the ricotta would've been but still excellent!

I made this as written and loved it.  The pepper flakes gave a nice kick.  I have never made eggplant before and watched the video beforehand.  It was a simple and delicious side dish.

Overall, we liked this recipe.  I halved the recipe for just us two, and subbed sour cream, not having ricotta on hand.  I like that you use the entire eggplant - chopped bits in the sauce.  I also followed one review about layering the slices to save effort and time :)  I botched the crumb topping; it was a bit soggy.  (I had forgotten the olive oil in the crumb mix until the casserole had been in the oven for 10 min, so drizzled on top then back into the oven - my bad.)  I will try this again.

Another winner from Chef John, saved to the recipe box. The only change was using an Arrabbiata sauce and no red chili flakes.

As is, this recipe is pretty good. I followed the directions exactly and found there to be a bit too much sauce for my liking. Truth be told, I thought the casserole was just okay but my family seemed to like it so that bumps it up to four stars. I doubt I'll be making this again but it was nice to try something a little different.

This was a yum. I did use half the bread crumbs but everything else was according to chef John. I did use my own eggplant which made it even better. Can't wait to make it again.

Fantastic!  SOOOO Goood! My boyfriend and I are beginner cooks, and the recipe was easy to follow.  I'm a long time fried eggplant fan, and it was terrific to have a healthier option.  We followed everything except we used less oil for the eggplant and re-coated the pan for each batch.  Also, we ended up needing more cheese mixture, so use sparingly or make extra. Don't leave out the red pepper flakes.  The sauce is the best part, and that's the part that gives it the kick.

First time ever cooking eggplant and it worked out great! Cheated a bit on the vegetarian theme and added a little bit of sausage to the sauce. Served it with a side of spaghetti with a drizzle of olive oil and basil. Great recipe!!!

What great way to lighten up eggplant parm!  Very tasty, but I personally will use a little less breadcrumb next time (my 12 year old's only complaint.
