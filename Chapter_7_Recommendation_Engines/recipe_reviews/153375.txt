Really nice summer recipe.  Make sure to pick up the smaller size puddings - 4 serving size.  I thought it was 4 ounces and could not find the right size.  People ate it all up at the pool party and it looks pretty too. I used kiwi, blackberries and peaches.

Was wondering if anyone else had an issue with the melted white chocolate hardening when it was mixed into the pudding mixture?

I made this quick and easy recipe for my family and boyfriend and they absolutely loved it. The mixture of white chocolate and pudding was so Delish.  I cannot wait to make it again.
