From the beginning I noticed that the recipe did not call for tomatoes. I followed the recipe and at the end it was more like a thick gravy. I then added a can of diced tomatoes. This made it taste more like gumbo and less like shrimp and sausage in a roux/gravy.

I made this today! It was great. I did alter a few things. I added more flour and less oil plus one half stick of land o lakes butter (salted) I made my own broth using chicken bullion cubes and water. I didn't have any any Cajun seasoning, so I used old bay seasoning with a little sea salt and added a bit of ground thyme. I also added mixed vegetables in place of okra cause I didn't have okra at home. My roux was my desired consistency of thickness.

This is not what I had in mind for a good Gumbo, I ended up with a large pan of shrimp, sausage and veges in a pan of gravy. The flavors were good but, it was like eating gravy with meat and veges.

I don't write a lot of reviews but I had to for this one.  I was looking for an easy gumbo recipe after my 8-year-old loved the gumbo at a Bubba Gump restaurant.  (Who'd have thought?)  I had never made gumbo before and some of the recipes just look so laborious.  This took a little time but was so worth it!  Everyone loved it!  The only change was I added a can of diced tomatoes and I used half a cup of canola oil and half a cup of butter for the roux, just because I think roux should have butter in it and I can't help myself. 

The Cajun seasoning I had was Tony Chachere's Original Creole seasoning and I only used one tablespoon of it because I didn't want it too spicy and people could add more after if they wanted it hotter.  I served it with Jasmine rice and garlic bread.  Really happy with this one!

It was easy but of course I had to change the recipe. This recipe didn't call for okra so I added that in with the vegetables.  I had fresh in my kitchen. Trying to make it friendly for my son to eat I added pre-cooked, cut up, chicken thighs in addition to shrimp and sausage. I took the advice of folks and used Old Bay seasoning so I didn't have to buy one more bottle of seasoning then added a can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos.  Well my husband loved it! My son not so much cause that small can of tomatoes had just enough spice to turn him off. A do-over for sure.

I used my own Cajun seasoning mix, since I didn’t have one. I think that it would work best, if it didn’t have so much spices. The flavor of the shrimp was very good. Highly recommended for any seafood fans.

It was great.  Easy to make.  This was the first actual intensive meal I have ever made.  I took the advice of the other reviewer and added a diced tomato.  I also added a few mushrooms and jalapeno peppers since I had them laying around.  Thanks for the recipe.  If shrimp wasn't so expensive I would make this more often.  It cost roughly 20 bucks to make the entire batch.  Love it.

As a learning curve my dad asked me to make a dish by myself. So the first dish that came to mind was gumbo. so I was searching online for an easy recipe and came across this. And for the first time cooking something myself it tasted really good! if ya want some more spice. After you have finished plating it, a couple of drops of tobasco improved the taste. (if you can handle the heat that is).
