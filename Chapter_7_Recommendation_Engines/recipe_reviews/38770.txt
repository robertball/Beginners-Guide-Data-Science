...okay, I won't be making this again.  Not only did it look awful (the milk curd is deposited on the meat) but neither my husband or myself noticed any effect the sauce made in the flavor of the ham slice.  Sorry, Kate...

I used this to fix a small (probably half pound) ham slice.  Normally I just heat them in a fry pan but decided to do something different.  I could not bring myself to use milk especially after reading the reviews about curdled milk.  So I used water instead.  The result was good.  Maybe next time I'll use chicken or beef broth.

Very tasty but yes, it does look pretty awful!  We cut up a half-ham into 3 big chunks and I had tripled the recipe (mustard and garlic) but sure didn't need to - ended up wasting a lot of it so next time I'd only maybe double the mustard and garlic.  We served it with rice and tossed salad and it was a yummy meal!

I've made this recipe about 6 times now, and my results have been a little different from the other reviews.  I have not had the "curd" effect that others have mentioned.  I have made this either in one of the oven proof plastic bags, or the slow cooker, and made the sauce to a boil prior to adding to the meat.  The consistency is completely smooth, and I found it gave good flavour to the ham, and made it incredibly tender.  Prior to serving, I thicken the left over sauce and serve it as a dipping sauce.
The last time I made it the sauce, I added it to left over home-made macaroni and cheese, and scalloped potatoes.  It gave great flavour and a zest to both of these dishes.  Thanks Kate!

This dish wasn't very attractive, but it was DELICIOUS!!!  My husband doesn't even like mustard, but he loved this dish!!  I served it with macaroni salad and garlic toast - flavors mingled well together and left everyone more than satisfied!

My fiancé and I thought this was a very delicious dish (For what we had haha.). The only thing we had in our freezer was a slice of ham weighing about a pound. I looked up this website and typed in “sliced ham recipes” and up popped this. The recipe sounded quick, easy and to make it better, the ham was fabulous. I added a bit of honey and I used brown mustard for the sauce. I’m not particularly picky about what I eat, but it looked nasty; lol! But you know what they say, “Looks bad, but tastes great!”  Thanks! Lynnie!

This was really good and VERY easy. The mustard wasn't overpowering, and the milk kept the ham nice and moist.

It was okay, but I won't make it again. There wasn't much flavor and the mustard made it too salty for us. I didn't have the curdling problem that others had, though. I whisked the sauce ingredients together first and brought it to a boil, then poured it over the ham and baked it in a plastic cooking bag as one reviewer suggested. Covering it kept the ham from drying out, but I'm going back to my favorite way to cook a ham slice. Maybe I'll post that recipe!
