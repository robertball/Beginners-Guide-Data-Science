Served this over the Christmas Holiday when guests just "popped in".  Easy, fast and GOOD.  My intent was to serve it at our block's "tree trimming party" so I had the ingredients on hand.  Kids loved it.  I also tried it (as I was making it) cold, and that is just as good.  The pecans add a nice texture as well as taste.  Inexpensive and on hand ingredients make it a regular from now on.

This is quick, easy and tastey. It calls for ingredients commonly found in most pantries. Not outstanding, but pretty good. I served on Italian panetini for a bit of a texture change.

This recipe made me a little iffy because I had never heard of adding  pineapple to tuna before.  This is so good and very easy to put together.  It is good warm or cold.  I had mine today on wheat bread which was good, but hands down is better on Ritz crackers.

Far East Tuna Haiku: "No need to heat these. The tuna mixture's great cold. (Needs more curry though.) I love the taste of curry in tuna, so I increased the tuna to 1/4 tsp. Only had walnuts on hand, so I toasted and chopped those instead of pecans. I tried the tuna, warmed, as directed, on Ritz crackers and it was terrific, but I actually enjoyed it later in the day on toast with melted provolone, green onion and tomato. With the sweet pineapple, savory curry, and crunchy walnuts, this is a nice and unusual take on standard tuna-salad. Oh and a little shake of S&P doesn't hurt either.

I made 1/2 recipe.  Went over very well.  I added double the curry.  I think it could use a few grains of salt and I NEVER add salt.

I think the concept was good but they needed something else.  I ended up adding a lot more curry powder but probably needs something like toasted pine nuts to add a little more dimension.

This was tasty and easy!  I didn't have pineapple so I used a couple spoons of pineapple preserves, and didn't have pecans so I used chopped almonds.  I also increased the curry powder to 1/4 tsp. and just ate it out of the bowl with sesame crackers. :)  Yum!

This was great. I loved the curry and pecans! I added some green onion, and cut back on the pinapple a bit.

Yum.  This is really good.  We make sandwiches out of the tuna mixture, and they are a big hit.

I really liked this recipe...and think it would also be good on toasted white bread as a tuna sandwich.

Not bad.  I didn't have pecans handy, so I tried it with cashews.  Yummy.

Quick, easy, and tasty but would have been better with maybe crabmeat or shrimp.  I also left out the pecans but only because my BF wouldn't have touched it had I added them.
