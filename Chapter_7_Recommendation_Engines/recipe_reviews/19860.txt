Wow! I just loved this dish.  I didn't have fresh basil, so I added dried basil and fresh parsley.  I also sauteed cubed chicken in olive oil, garlic and italian herbs on the side and added at the end.  One note - you have to remove ALL of the brie rind, otherwise it won't melt and will leave floating bits of rind in your sauce.

That's pretty good :) Thanks. I will make again. I love a cheesy sauce. However, I don't love saucy cheese.  To the review that reported there were cheese lumps in her sauce... cheese melts, duh!

I had this same recipe last night at a friend's home.  However, it was served at room temperature (do not simmer to melt cheese!)  Served as a topping for sliced crusty bread.  A bruchetta of sorts.  Cube the brie, seed the tomatoes & dice, mince the garlic, drizzle with olive oil, add fresh chpd basil, salt & pepper.  Set at room temperature for 2 hours before serving in an open dish with sliced, small ovals/rounds of bread.  Delicious!

I'm sorry, but the small pieces of semi-melted brie floating in my sauce did nothing to enhance the flavor or make it special.
