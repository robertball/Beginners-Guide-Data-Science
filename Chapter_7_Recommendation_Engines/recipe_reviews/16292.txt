I remember seeing this recipe on the backs of Ritz Cracker boxes when I was a kid, the only difference being the use of lemon juice and zest instead of vinegar. I always wanted to try it, but never got around to it. Well, I'm 52 now, and finally made it for the first time this weekend. And you know what? I actually liked it! I did make a change, but took that into consideration when rating it. Thirty-six crackers just didn't seem like enough in the premade deepdish piecrust I used, so I added a third more, a total of forty-eight crackers. This resulted in a pretty firm pie, reminiscent of a chess pie, and I realized that thirty-six crackers would have been just the right amount for a juicy pie, so the 5-star rating is for the original recipe. But, my son said he liked it the way I made it, and that I should make it again just the same way, so it also gets five stars for being versatile enough to handle the changes. And the flavor is apple-y enough to make you do a double take. I'd make this again, even if my son didn't insist on it!

This is so superb. I had this many years ago and did not believe it was not made with apples. For the longest time I looked for the recipe but could not find it. FINALLY I found it and  made  it for my husband and dinner guests. My husband knew what the ingredients were and was reluctant to even try it, but he did. He was literally speechless, and amazed, so were our guests.  Superb!!! Without a doubt

Finally tried the recipe & nobody could believe it was crackers. It came out great. Will keep this recipe handy as it's simple to make & tastes just like apple without the fuss.
