I was nervous to experiment with a new dish for our party... especially because there had only been 2 reviews... but it was SO good!!  Everyone loved them!  The pear had such a delicate flavor you could hardly tell it was there, I used d'anjou pears, I don't know if another kind would taste different.  Don't skimp on the cheese... I cooked up 4 sweet onions (3 inches in diameter), and had about a cup left over.  Three onions would have done just fine.

I really liked these, but the whole process was a little strange. The flavor was good, and the guests ate them up, but the next time I make them I will use the puff pastry cups. I tried it both as written in the directions and as one reviewer mentioned stuffing the triangles. both ways didn't get enough filling for me and I ended up with huge bites of puff pastry with only the middle bite with filling. I would highly recommend this recipe, and I will make it again, just using the cups instead.

This recipe came out amazing! I did like the previous review and put the items inside the triangles. It was a hit with the group I made it for and I would definitely make it again! I might next time add a little balsamic vinegar for a bit more flavor, though.

These were great!  Because I am lazy, I used frozen Fillo *cups* instead of fussing w/the puff pastry triangles.  So easy and so good.  I filled each cup w/a little caramelized onion, finely diced pear, and blue cheese, then baked at 350 for 3-5 minutes.  A great amuse bouche I will serve regularly...quick, economical, and quite tasty!  THANKS!

Absolutely delicious!! 10 stars from me and my mom! I folded the pastry over and made triangles stuffed with the onions,pears and blue cheese. What an amazing combo of flavors. Will most definately make again! Thanks!

I chose to make this appetizer because I LOVE blue cheese, I LOVE pears and I most especially LOVE carmelized onions. I made this exactly as written except using premade phyllo cups. I'm glad I did as it was a time saver. The filling was enough to fill 45 cups with some pear left over. They smelled so good when I took them out of the oven. Unfortunately, the teaspoon of blue cheese per pastry was a bit heavy handed. I liked them okay, but they were not the hit of my party as I had hoped they would be. :(

Devine!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Had to make another batch for a party so -I took the tip of using the cups and made double!  Just saute the pears with the onion as the cooking time for the cups is only 3-5 minutes max!  So great thank you pj.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! The pear has such a subtle flavor that the combination with onions and blue cheese make the perfect compliment. These little pastries will not last long and they reheat very well.

Thanks so much to everyone for your great reviews.  I've tried folded over pastry and pastry cups but I still prefer them open face.  I recently treated myself to a very expensive bottle of balsamic and its great in the recipe!! Cali Pizza Kitchen recently came out with a similar pizza and we have been making it at home and its great!! Thanks again everyone!

very very good...a touch rich, I used a bit less butter with the onions, and a touch more pear,  a hair less blue cheese and added walnuts and it was perfect to me!

I was a bit leery, but these are so good. I have to admit that I did change one thing - I made filled phyllo triangles out of them instead of just setting the topping on top of a triangle only because I needed these to be really mobile. The taste was wonderful and even my 14 yr. old daughter who is very picky loved these. I do believe I would put more pear in next time though - it did get a bit "drowned out" by the onion and blue cheese, but just by a bit. Perhaps three pears next time instead of two, but still, completely awesome recipe. Thanks Scarlett!

Definitely a recipe worth keeping, but read the reviews!  
First, the amount of onions.  If you use small onions (about the size of a tennis call) you will need three.  I used two large onions (about the size of a softball) and it was more than enough.
Second, while this is good as it is, the cups are a great idea.  See my custom recipe for how I plan to change it.
Three, be sure to use parchment paper, and when you cut the puff pastry leave it in a square with just a tiny space between the cut pieces.  That way you can just put the toppings on the entire thing - much faster and easier, and it ensures there's topping all over it.
Fourth, bake at least as long as the directions say.  it's better well done than underdone.  Some of the onions may burn but you can break them off the finished product.
Enjoy!

I loved the onion, blue cheese & pear flavor but there was not enough "room" in the puff pastry triangle to get more than a tidbit of taste. I'll take another reviewer's hint and use puff pastry cups next time. Or maybe a light pizza crust...

These were awesome! I ended up putting all ingredients into each square and folding them into a triangle and sealed the edges so there would be more filling inside, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and they were out of this world!!!

These were fantastic, everybody loved loved loved them.  I did add some chopped walnuts to the mix, and I had to use two packages of puff pastry dough.  I used folded squares of pastry dough for nice neat packages.  The worst part really was carmelizing the onions, took about 40 minutes on my stove....but oh it was so worth it, the flavour...all the flavours melded so perfectly.  This is definitely a keeper, I'm going to try a mushroom and goat cheese mixture next time.

Excellent recipe - I simplified by rolling out the puff pastry as a whole sheet, covered with toppings and baked. Just cut into squares to serve.  Also tried subbing the blue cheese with brie and that was pretty good, but not quite as tasty as the blue cheese topping.

This was okay. I cut my pastry into circles and put them into mini muffin tins. the taste was a little weird for me but then again im not a HUGE fan of blue cheese. very crowd specific and would only make for super blue cheese fans.

My mom and I made these for a family get-together and everyone liked them. If you like pears and blue cheese you will like these. It's a good combination of flavors-strong blue cheese with subtle pear.

I used flat puff pastry, cut into squares and put it in a mini-muffin tin, curling up the corners. I only made half the recipe, and it was good, but kind of onion heavy.

To solve a space/goodness problem that a number of people were having, I made decent sized rectangles rather than triangles and fit on lots of good toppings. It decreased the puff around the edges, but gave about five great bites. I also put the blue cheese underneath to make it prettier and drizzled balsamic vinegar reduction over the top. Yummy!

The only reason I give this 4 stars and not 5 is that I really had to work at the proportions (I had way more filling than I had dough).  And I finally ended up with rectangles instead of triangles.  However, the ingredients are fabulous, and when I finally got them made properly, they were wonderful.  This is a really delicious recipe.

This was a delicious blend of flavors. The blue cheese that I used overpowered the delicate flavor of the pear so I would recommend cutting down the amount of blue cheese on each triangle. These were devoured at my Christmas dinner, definitely a keeper!

Quite good and exotic.  Couldn't find puff pastry cups so I shoved puff pastry squares into mini muffin cups.  Not the best presentation. I would use less onion next time, maybe only 2.  Took 40 minutes to cook down like it said.  Presented nicely.  Put the blue cheese on after cooking, but I'd maybe put half inside next time for more blue cheese flavor.  Time consuming but easy and classy.

I made this recipe for a recent gathering, following the directions for puff pastry for half of them, and the other half I put into mini phyllo cups.  I did put a dash of balsamic vinegar on the top of the blue cheese topping.  While these were good, they weren't sensational in my opinion.  I think I wanted more pear and more blue cheese.  I think that how others made them by folding over the triangle and sealing them but in a bigger size would be better for my tastes.

These were a little too onion-y for my tastes.  But everyone else thought they were fantastic and couldn't get enough.  I'll definitely make these again!

I took them to a holiday party and it was about 50 percent approval rate. The blue cheese was a little over powering. If I made again I would use another cheese. Even the fans of the recipe agreed that the flavor was a little strong to go with other appetizers. I would not recommend.

This was absolutely delicious and went fast at my party. I cut it into triangles and then folded the points over. I also only needed one pear. Thanks!

These turned out yummy, even though it was my first time with puff pastry.  I ended up with twice as much filling as pastry.  Perhaps could've used more if I had kept to the 9 squares per sheet and made stuffed triangles from them.  Overall great... I'm sure they will look prettier next time ;)

I made for a book club meeting at my home. They were pretty good—guests ate some (I made way too many) but I don’t think I will make again. Too rich with all the butter, cheese, & pastry. Also, I drizzled a little balsamic sauce over the tops just to give a better presentation & add another dimension of flavors. I had made them previously without the balsamic drizzle. Still just ok.

I added shitake mushrooms to the onion. Next time I will change out the cheese for a smoky one for a different take. I served it with Christmas Eve dinner where we had only finger food and it was loved by everyone in the family. Thanks!

These turned out great, however there was an excessive amount of onion. 2 onions, or 1 large would have been ample. Also, the pears need to be diced quite small in order to fit inside each triangle.

These came out really sweet.  I made the for dinner but the whole family agreed it was more of a dessert.

Agree that the pastry can overwhelm.  The biggest takes are: this is an onion dish...don’t skimp. Don’t forget to salt prior to baking. Lastly, don’t fear the blue cheese!

Simple meets fancy. Other than a little tedious to construct this dish appetizer has been delishes and has people in aw with how fancy it looks and tastes.
