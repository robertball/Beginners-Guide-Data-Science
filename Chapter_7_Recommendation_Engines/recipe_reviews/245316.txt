Tasty, quick & easy! I made this the night before to take to our monthly group coloring session. Made some slight changes, instead of 2 cups of cheese I only used one cup and I didn't add the bacon bits until just before leaving the house because  I don't like my crunchy bacon getting too soft when it sits in moist foods too long.  It was a hit with the group, especially the guys. Why?...because it had BACON in it.  I was asked for the recipe by all.  I'd definitely make this again & again & again.
