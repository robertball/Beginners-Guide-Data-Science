Interesting. Like the other review I found this different than any stir-fry that I have ever had too. It was sour and tart. I added brown sugar to make it more sweet. I won't make again.

Easy and fast dish to make.  Didn't taste like any stir fry I've had.  I thought it tasted more like a Tex Mex kinda dish.

Super easy, quick, delicious!  Note to self - next time do not double the recipe - the quantity as is is quite sufficient.
