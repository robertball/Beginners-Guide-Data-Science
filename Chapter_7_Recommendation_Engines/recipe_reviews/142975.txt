Great as the chicken, but I tried it a second time using Tilapia filets (about 20 mins. in the oven). Unbelievable! I liked it even better, the fish is very mild and the pineapple sweet/tang is complementary to the flaky, soft goodness of the fish which absorbs the liquids. I also oiled the pan using coconut oil so that added an extra tasty undertone. Next time I also plan on tossing a few toasted macadamias on top.

I made some changes like others did. I added 3 Tablespoons Honey, 3 oz package Melissa's Dried Lemon Peels, 1 Tablespoon Garlic Powder, 1/2 Tablespoon Onion Powder, 3/4 cup Low-Sodium Soy Sauce to the chicken breasts. YUMMY! It went well with rice and a vegetable for a side.

Actually was going to make something else and had chicken marinating in teriyaki sauce for about an hour, then changed my mind, rinsed the chicken, and followed directions. I served it with white rice drizzled with the same teriyaki sauce and it was SO GOOD!! My boyfriend and I loved it. Not sure if the teriyaki marinade had anything to do with how it turned out but will definitely make this again, thanks!!

I don't do artificial sweetner so I suppose I should have gone looking for the recipe that the author said inspired this one. But I didnt, I wanted pineapple chicken and this looked like a good base, However then I read the comments.  Inspired by Reviewed on Feb. 10, 2010 by Jen, I added some slices of root ginger and onion to base of dish before adding chicken on top and I added some soy sauce, red chilli (diced small) and powdered ginger, large dash of rice wine vinegar, and soft brown sugar to the pineapple. I omitted the lemon juice (as rice wine vinegar added the sour note and I ommited the mustard as I never have luck with mustard and chicken baked dishes for soem reason and there was enough heat from other ingrediants in there.  We loved it!!!! Served with stir fry veg (ginger & soy) and rice.

I enjoyed this. I first marinated the chicken in teriyaki sauce. Then when I made the pineapple sauce, I used only 1/4 cup Splenda. I don't think the chicken needs to cook for 50 minutes.

We really enjoyed this. It was easy to prepare and I made a couple small additions to please my family's tastes.

First, I marinated in light pineapple juice with a squeeze of lime juice, along with a couple shakes of garlic allspice and green onion spice blend.

I baked the chicken over some red onion slices and topped 2 out of the 3 breasts that I made with some jalapeno slices. I dumped all the marinade so the bottom of the pan stayed moist and brushed the chicken with the mixture detailed here, with the addition of a splash of soy sauce and using splenda brown sugar rather than the granulated. I heated the mixture up just to thicken it a bit before cooling slightly and brushing the chicken.

Cooked in a pan instead of baking in the oven. Added 2tbsp minced garlic, 1/3 cup light soy sauce, reduced the splenda to 1/4 cup & served over jasmine rice. Delicious!!

I didn't have crushed pineapple and used slice pineapples instead and they still tasted great!  with the left over chicken and juice from baking I made a delicious sandwich with the slice of pineapple.
