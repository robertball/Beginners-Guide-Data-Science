I added two bananas that were getting too ripe.  It added a sweet contrast to the savory.  It was delicious.

Excellent, puffed up beautifully and they were nice and dense. We loved them. I only made 1/2 the recipe, to make two.

I missed something in the directions.  Where do you add the rest of the plain, ( ie.not mixed with egg yolks) sweet potatoes?
