Chicken Tikka Masala is my favorite Indian dish. This was super easy and much like what I have at my favorite Indian restaurant. I, too, substituted heavy cream for the Greek yogurt. It was spicy enough for me but I am not a big "heat" person, if you like hot, I suggest you add your favorite spice to taste.

This recipe was great as is, however I did alter it a tad to my liking :)  I used bone-in thighs with skin on, as a lot more flavor comes out that way.  I also added about 2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon.  Voila!  Such a great dish.  Next time I may add carrots and/or potatoes.  Thanks!

im pretty sensitive to spicy dishes, and did not find it spicy. maybe an
little more chuncky and less sauce based than i prefer,  but it's decent enough. probably won't make it again though.

I read a review that said they followed the recipe exactly, and that it came up runny like water.  I followed it, nearly exactly and it was perfection!  Was VERY much like my favorite tikka masala I order from a high end restaurant.  LOVED this.  Instead of a cup of heavy cream, I did half cup of light coconut milk and half cup of cream.  It's not a thick  sauce, and even the best I've had isn't that--it's a nice gravy--pour over rice, serve with naan to soak it up.  Left overnight, the sauce was much thicker the next day.  DELISH and I'll do it again.  (I might do 6 hrs on WARM instead of on LOW, bc it was boiling about 3 hrs in--and you don't want to boil dairy [yogurt] or it separates and that indeed can cause it to be watery.  Also chicken gets REAL hard and dried REALLY fast in a slow cooker.)

AMAZING!! I thought this crock pot "cheat" would be a far cry from the real thing, but the flavor was phenomenal. Sure, shredded chicken is different than cubed, but the taste is great, and it made the prep much more manageable after a work day. I served over rice with raita, naan, and sautéed veggies on the side.

I served mine over basmati rice. This chicken was delicious, but next time I'll make it spicier.

This recipe is amazing. I too, substituted the heavy cream for fat free sour cream and it turned out well. Otherwise, followed the recipe. I’ve made this on several occasions and it has been delicious every time. The leftovers freeze well.

Chicken tikka masala is one of our favorite dishes and I was excited to see this super easy version.  Unfortunately I thought it was just ok.  Not spicy enough and chicken was dry.  I'm not a fan of chicken in the slow cooker on any day as I have yet to fix it where it doesn't dry out, but that aside, this sauce was a fine texture, but a little bland and much sweeter than we prefer.  Thanks for a great idea - I'll  keep trying to tweak it a bit (maybe sautéing chicken at the end and just adding it, and certainly spicing up the sauce).

The whole family liked this dish!  I thought the yogurt taste was a bit too strong, so I would use less yogurt next time.  Added some cardamom pods for aroma and fragrance.  It's not quite what you would get in India.  But it's easy to prepare and family-friendly.

Flavor was good, texture was a bit mushy, and did not stand up at all to reheating.

Great dish, and super easy to make. I also substituted the yogurt for sour cream and it worked well.  Also added 1/2 tablespoon of Thai red chili's to give it some kick and served with an Indian yellow rice recipe which can be found here: http://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/indian_style_rice/

This is about the best Chicken Tikka Masala I have made. It was not too Spicy and all at  the table were pleased. Next time I will try the heavy cream but the yogurt worked well. I just found it a lil tomatoey in taste and was wishing it to be a lil more creamy.

Made this close to the recipe. I like spice so I added more spice. It wasn't as creamy or spicy as what I eat at my favorite Indian restaurant. It wasn't even close. But it was a good meal. 
So it was an easy crock pot meal. It tasted good but not like the real thing. Yes I will make it again and I will add veggies and more spice  and yogurt to make it creamier.

Great recipe !  Very easy to make, I used a little more garlic and cilantro about 1/2 the recommended salt and used powdered ginger instead of fresh root.  I also used bone in/skin in thighs. I put it over some brown rice and everyone loved it.  Will definitely make it again.

Overall, the recipe was really water-y. I think doing it again, we would either not use canned tomatoes or cook the chicken first to remove any moisture

Most amazing thing I’ve made! I used drained diced tomatoes as I didn’t have crushed. Added  1/2tsp Indian hot chili powder and used 2% Greek plain yogurt as I’ve heard fat free curdling . Yummy yummy

I made this as written. My guy and I agreed that the recipe is solid, meaning the flavor is good, but there is not even a little bit of kick. I would definitely chop and add some fresh chiles next time. Tikka Masala isn't supposed to burn your face off, but there should be a little kick. We threw some pepper flakes in, but it wasn't ideal. Next time... Seeded, chopped fresh chiles.

4.5 stars if possible.  Too much garam masala.  Will half it at least next time.that's the only change I'd make.

I really want to like this dish as is was super simple and I love all types of curry.  It was left wanting. Flavour was just not there. Had to add more of everything plus added clove, mustard seed, and fenugreek so that my family would eat it. Added tumric for colour. Also u never add your dry spices straight to liquid. Always heat up ur spices in a hot pan with a bit of oil for 1-2 minutes to release the flavours first. I guess this is a good base curry for newbies.

This is a great slow cooker Tikka Masala! I added red pepper flake to kick up the spice factor, and added more garam masala then was required for the recipe. Served over basmati rice with saffron! Awesome meal and recipe!

Didn't have fresh  ginger or garlic so had to use powdered and this recipe still turned out so tasty and was super easy to throw in the pot with frozen chicken thighs before heading out for the day.

Excellent version of Tikka Masala. We cut the recipe in half but used the full version of spices.  Beast to make in the slow cooker but with great results. Definitely a keeper!

I added some turmeric and paprika for spice and used heavy cream rather than the yogurt, but I really loved this recipe. It was very easy and reheated nicely (slowly on the stove). I will definitely be preparing this dish again!

I thought this was a very easy recipe & a good family meal. I used heavy cream instead of the yogurt as that was what was in my refrigerator. I didn't have any cilantro on hand so I added some partially cooked broccoli and cauliflower during the last few minutes of cooking. It was flavorful & spicy enough for us. My DH loved it so I will definitely be making it again.

This seems to be missing some needed spices.  Maybe some fresh ground black pepper for mild heat (1/4 teaspoon red pepper flake if you like it hotter) and some paprika for depth or possibly cardamom or  Tumeric or something to wake this dish up. It's all Garam Masala and creamy tomato with no supporting flavors. Probably more tomato would not hurt.

Really enjoyed this recipe. Great flavour without being crazy spicy. Would reduce the salt next time...checking  the sodium content of the tomatoes I use before deciding how much.

This is a very tasty tikka masala. I followed the directions for the most part. Used around 2 1/2 lbs of chicken thighs. I cut the thighs up into random size chunks. Next time I make it I'd like it to have some bite and heat to it. Any suggestions on what to add for some heat? With out ruining the dish.

I have tried several slow cooker tikka masala recipes on this site, and this one is by far my favorite. I think the spices are perfect, not too spicy, just spicy enough. I make this recipe exactly as written.

Can hardly believe that this dish insn't hot enough for some people. All of us here kept piling on the yogurt, loving every bite. Can definitely see adding various veggies to the dish. Small pieces of raw avocado might be interesting.

This was amazing - slightly spicy but fine for my four year old. Super easy in the crock pot, cooked on low for about 7 hours, we used boneless chicken breasts instead of thighs as we prefer them. We will definitely make this again.

I omitted the cumin and cooked it on low for 11 hours (more than I planned, but scheduling is scheduling). 

The chicken came out very tender and delicious. I found the spice level good, but I don't like my food too spicy. If you do, you'll want to add some cayenne pepper or something.

I found it too sweet and too tomato-oriented. It tasted more like strange spaghetti sauce than tikka masala. I think next time I will use more yogurt (or less tomato) and no brown sugar.

We didn't think this dish had much heat as the reviewer from Jan 7 said. I'm not even sure what would cause serious heat.   I put half-and-half and lemon juice in at the end instead of yogurt.  It was very good and super easy.  I'm just glad to do Indian and have some variety of spices.

This recipe has some serious heat to it, which I love.
