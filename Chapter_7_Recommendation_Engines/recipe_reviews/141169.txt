I originally submitted this recipe.  I've been experimenting and have found a healthier low fat version that's just as delicious: 1/4 butter (instead of 1 cup) and 1 can of evaporated skim milk (instead of cream). Turns out lighter but just as delicious. I've also used white fish, scallops and prawns in place of the chicken sometimes!

This recipes was delicious!  I made a few changes, mostly to keep the number of pans down.  I carmelized the onions in a large pan, then I added the rest of the butter, tomato sauce, cream, and spices and simmered (on EXTREMELY low heat) for about 10 minutes. Then I added the ckicken bits right into the sauce mixture (without tandoori masala) and let it simmer on low for about 25 more minutes until the chicken was done, being careful not to boil the cream.  The chicken was tender and the sauce was delicious. I served it over basmati rice and garnished with fresh cilantro. My husband loved it! One of the best Indian recipes I've found.

Fabulous! The only change we made was to substitute the tandoori marsala with 1 Tbsp. curry powder. We loved it and will serve it to company.

This was SO good!! And easy! I cut down on the dishes and made this all in my cast iron dutch oven. I caramelized the onions and garlic in the butter, once they were done I removed them to a bowl and deglazed the pan with a little chicken broth. Made the sauce as directed and once it was hot, I added the chicken. I didn't have any tandoori masala so I marinated the chicken pieces in a mixture of yogurt, lemon juice, garam masala, cayenne and curry powder for a couple of hours. Turned out great!!

This turned out fabulous.  Made changes as suggested by others:  made it all in one pan, didn't have tandoori marsala so used 1 TBS of curry instead, used 1 can of coconut milk instead of the heavy cream, used less butter and omitted the salt.  Next time, I'll add more onions.  Served with Naan bread and rice.  It was fantastic!

this was amazing and super easy! I also recommend skipping out on the salt, and experimenting with the degree of cayenne pepper based on your spiciness preference. Another good idea is to add in vegetables! (red/green pepper's, carrots, asparagus etc.) it tastes GREAT and it adds a bit of health to the meal!  try adding them in about... 10 or 15 minutes b4 the sauce is done, depending how crunchy or soft you want the veggy's!  :) hope that helps! good luck! this is an AMAZING dish

Loved it! It was delicious!! I changed it up a bit after reading other reviews: 1/4 cup butter (instead of 1 cup) 1 can fat free evaporated milk (instead of 3 cups heavy cream) 1/2 teaspoon salt (instead of 2 teaspoons) 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (instead of 1 teaspoon) and 1 tablespoon curry powder (instead of garam masala, which I could not find)  I omitted the vegetable oil and tandoori masala.  I cooked it all in one pot like someone else had suggested. Caramelized the onions with 2 tablespoons butter and set them aside, deglazed the pan with a little bit of chicken broth (low sodium kind), added the rest of the butter, tomato sauce, evaporated milk, salt, cayenne and curry. Stirred it, added cut up raw chicken, and then simmered for 25 min. Then stirred in the onions. It was fantastic over basmati rice, I would definitely make it again!!

this is a great recipe however with 82 grms of fat, it is a walking heart attack waiting to happen.  i followed the lower fat recipe rated below with only 1/4 cup of butter and carnation evaporated milk, with the addition of 1 tbsp. of brown sugar with excellent results!  I added onions and a few chopped fresh plum tomatoes also.  This dish tastes amazing the next day!

Excellent! I chose this recipe over others for butter chicken because of the shortened ingredient list. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and cooked everything in one pan (instead of baking the chicken).  I found 3 cups of cream too much and only used 1.  I also cut the pepper in half for a milder dish.  Tasted just like India Kitchen!

I was intrigued, but once I saw 1 cup of butter PLUS 3 cups heavy cream and almost 900 calories per serving----wow. I'm sure this dish is delish, but definitely NOT healthy!!!!  Will have to keep looking for something with more reasonable ingredients.

Wow! This is the closest I have ever gotten to the Makhani chicken at my favorite Indian restaurant. Thank You so much-I know I will be making this once a week. Next time I will reduce the salt a bit, but it is wonderful

We reaaaaally loved this one.  I couldn't believe that these smells were coming out of my kitchen!  I never thought I would be able to do this, but it was super simple and really delicious.  I also stirred in a 5 oz can of evaporated skim milk (after turning off the heat in the end) instead of using the heavy cream.  I tried stirring it in in the middle, but if you don't have something with enough fat (like cream), then everything curdles.  Trust me, I learned my lesson, twice.  This tastes like a tikka masala.  Served with basmati and store-bought naan.

I love Indian food, and it's tough to recreate the yummy restaurant flavors at home -- believe me when I say I've tried, and I know how to cook.  This recipe is so good and so easy that I'm stunned.  Changes I made: Used rotisserie chicken and mixed the pieces of chicken with the tandoori masala, let it sit in the fridge while preparing the rest of the recipe, then threw in the chicken at the end; cut the salt in half; used twice as much tomato sauce, not as much cream (two thirds, maybe?), doubled the spices, used half the onion, and added a package of frozen chopped spinach.  I  think the secret to this recipe that makes such a HUGE difference is the tandoori masala (this is the one ingredient that I've never used in previous attempts, and always mixed my own spices -- no more!), but whatever it is, I'm madly grateful for this recipe.  In all sincerity, this recipe makes chicken makhani (I've made it "saag" style with the spinach) equally as well as most that I've had.  Wow, and well done, mn!!  Thank you so much for sharing this gem of a recipe!

This is a good recipe!  =My recommendations: add a bit of sugar (not too much, 1 or 2 teaspoons to the whole sauce - this will sweeten it, but not make it a desert), a reduction in salt by at least a teaspoon, and less butter. That, really, changes very little! I was looking for a good butter chicken, and I believe I found it in this one! I have such a weakness for butter chicken.  :) Thank you so much for posting this!  :)

Huge hit with the family, this dish was delicious. I used evaporated skim milk per the advice of some other cooks, and also marinated the chicken in curry powder instead of tandoori masala, and topped the chicken with chopped cilantro after it was done. I will be making this again.

I made the light version. I used 1/4 cup of the butter and substituted 2 cans of evaporated milk for the heavy cream. Doing this took 2000 calories off the sauce alone! The only thing that I added was tumeric..Just a dash, and doubled  garmam masala and cayenne pepper. Served with the  Indian Basmati rice also found on this site, and steamed carrots. The family loves this, it has now been added to our regular dishes. Thanks for sharing

This is a pretty good recipe for butter chicken as listed. I am appalled that some reviewers have noted making a substitution of curry powder for the Garam Masala and or the Tandori Masala. These are both an unacceptable substitutes and will not yield good results. Curry powder was invented by British spice companies as a way to mimic Indian flavors and is not an actual Indian ingredient substituting it is all wrong for this recipe. If you are having problems locating the essential Indian ingredients try to find a local Indian market; Almost every town big enough to have an Indian restaurant will have at least one.

So good!!!!!  This smells and tastes delicious. I make the lightened version with evaporated milk and less butter.  Since I can't find tandoori masala I substitute curry.  I serve this over rice with garlic naan. Tastes like it came from a restaurant but this is soooo easy.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe! I wanted to add that I make this all the time now (1xweek usually) and I have streamlined prep to save time and cut down on the number of pots/pans.  After I carmelize the onions/garlic, I add the chicken chunks which I've tossed in oil and curry (subbed for the tandoori masala).  Once the chicken is cooked, I add the liquid ingredients to the pot and simmer them.

this was awesome!! but i did however make a couple adjustments..I used half cream half 1% milk i used a little less butter and I drained the oil from my chicken before i added to the sauce..it was a little thin so i mixed 2 teaspoons of corn starch with a quarter cup of water and added to the mixture the consistency was perfect and it tasted great with lower fat and cholesterol..

This recipe is one of our absolute favourites, the kids even ask for seconds!!  I did find that cooking the chicken in the oven took way longer than 12 minutes, it was more like 35.  So now I sear it in a frying pan with the Tandoori and then add it to the sauce to simmer for 30 mins (which also cuts down on the amount of dishes).  I've made it with all the fatty products, as well as 1/2 the butter and 10% cream and it's just as good both ways.  I'm going to try the evaporated skim milk to see how that goes next time.  The sauce freezes great, so I always double up on the chicken breasts so there is enough for next time.

This recipe is FABULOUS - even better than my local Indian restaurant! It has just enough kick to be appropriate for the whole family. I grilled the chicken and cut it into bite-sized pieces the night before. The next day, I caramelized the onions and garlic, shook the cooked chicken with tandoori masala in a plastic bag to coat it, then threw everything in a slow-cooker on low and didn't touch it for four hours. At dinner time, I gave it a thorough stirring and served over basmati rice - yum! This will now make regular appearances on my family's menu.

This is sooo good I just ate dinner and had to write a review! I used 3lbs chicken thighs, (big family) doubled the spices. No cayenne pepper so i put 1tsp of chili powder. Used a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes, 2 cups of whipping cream 1 cup of 2% milk. Sautee onions and garlic, then added a few tbsp of tomato paste. Didn't use butter at all because didn't have any (olive oil instead). Add spices to carmelized onion and sautee a few min., add raw chicken and cook everything together 5-10 min. Add crushed tomato, cream/milk and simmer on low an hour. WAS SOO GOOD with basmati rice. Try it.

Absolutely Delicious! I used 2 cups coconut milk 1 cup cream. Added the chicken to the whole thing instead of baking first. Simmered  til chicken cooked and tender. I added "Kitchens of India Butter chicken Curry paste" and Patak's mild curry paste(approx 1 Tbsp but taste test til desired amt) In place of Garam Masala and Tandoori Masala. I still added the cayenne though. 
It was amazing. Even first time curry people loved it. My husbands whole office is calling for the recipe!

Excellent! I also make a non Indian version since my husband does not like garam marsala. I simply omit   the garam marsala and tandoori and and add paprika and tumeric instead. Works for him and he raves about it!

My first Indian dish and it was fabulous.  I had to find substitution recipes for Garam Masala and Tandoori Masala, because I live in the sticks where there are no ethnic groceries... Even with that, this was a fantastic recipe and I'm keeping it.

I tried the low fat version of this recipe.  It is a good start, but I will make a few changes next time I try it - I do prefer a sweet and spicy butter chicken, so I would cut out the salt and add a couple tsp of sugar.  Also, I halved the recipe, but used 1tbsp of garam masala - it's what adds all the warm yummy flavour so you should use lots!  And definitely do it all in one saucepan to keep it simple!

I can't even express how much I love this recipe, 5 stars doesn't seem enough!  The first time I followed the recipe exactly, every other time I have used the healthier revisions suggested by the original poster mn and I like it even more and don't feel so guilty eating it now :) It truly does taste like authentic butter chicken, and I didn't need to purchase 30 different ingredients like some of the other recipes I found.  My only comment might be that by omitting 3/4 of the butter and replacing the heavy cream with fat free evaporated milk, the strength of the cayenne pepper is intensified.  I enjoyed this, but just a word of warning for people who don't like as much spice.  This is a new favourite for me, thanks so much mn!!!

I don't know who's cooking this recipe, but it's not me!  I tried making this dish twice with the butter and the evaporated skim milk as suggested by mn.  It curdled both times, even though I had the burner set on 2 then switched to Lo.  I threw it out the first time and had to run to the convenience store to get more butter and sadly try again without better results. This recipe is not easy... it's impossible!

I reduced butter to 1/2 c. and made the cream mixture as follows: 1 c. cream, 2 cup half n half or whole milk, increase garam masala to 1-1/2 TBSP and garlic to 2T.  Use 3 pounds of chicken (2 chicken breasts wasn't enough for the amount of sauce).  Delicious!!

My husband and I first had Butter Chicken in India on the road to see the Taj Majal in a small street side cafe.  We absolutely loved it and had it several more time over our 3 months we traveled in India.  Back in the states - we were unable to find really good butter chicken at the local Indian restaurants.  So I decided to take it upon myself to make it and this recipe was PERFECT!  I did follow the alternate directions that the original poster added (using 1/4 cup butter and evaporated milk instead of cream) - and the results were fantastic . My local store did not have the tandoori masala - so I just omitted it and added a little extra of the garam masala - but it probably would have enhanced the flavors even more.   I'll be on the lookout for the tandoori masala so I can make this again . It's definitely going in the 'rotation'.   I served it with Naan and even the kid loved it - especially when we told him he didn't have to use any silverware!  Definitely brought back good memories of our time in India!

this is amazing!! I just made it with scallops instead of chicken.  I used one 14 oz can of coconut milk, with almost half the 15 oz can of tomato sauce.  Instead of onion and garlic, I used half a shallot.   I added one full tablespoon of turmeric, because I am new to it, and like its flavor :)  I also added a dash of cumin.  This is truly incredible!!   I just took one star off because the original recipe has so much butter.    I made this with Indian Basmati Rice from this site!!

This was amazing!! Probably one of the best dishes I have ever made. I found the garam masala and tandoori at World Market,but there is also a recipe on this website how to make your own garam. I served this to friends and they loved it as well.

Using tips in reviews, I reduced salt, cayenne and fat and added coconut milk. It was really excellent over rice pilaf with a handful of almond slivers, cilantro and a squeeze of lime. This is a recipe that we will make every 6 weeks or so...but I'll make it hotter with crushed chilis, cayenne is tasted too close to the lips- we prefer back of the throat spicy!

Love this recipe. Have made it several times and it's as good as any restaurant butter chicken I've had. It's a little time consuming, but a great dish to make for company. Most people love it and it's a little exotic! Definitely not healthy though, not something you would want to make all the time.

Amazing recipe.  Each and every time I make it, friends and family ooh and awe.  However, I've learned to skim down the calories and fat while adding to the taste, so here are some substitutions/amendments: 

Skip the butter and use olive oil to caramelize the onion and garlic.  For taste, use one to two tablespoons of butter for the sauce with the tomatoes, but substitute low-fat yogurt or skim milk for the heavy cream to reduce calories.  Lastly, I typically double or triple the spices because the fam likes things hot and savory.

Made this for dinner last night with a few alterations. Cut it down for 4 servings (made WAY more than that though) and used evaporated milk. I also didn't bake the chicken, I browned it in the pan, removed it and once I got the sauce simmering, I added the chicken back in to cook along with. It was great! My family loved it with rice and steamed veggies. You do have to be careful not to boil the sauce though, as the milk will break. Still tasted good, though!

Made this using only 1/4 Cup butter and two tins of evaporated milk (=3 Cups).  I thought had made a mistake because it was SO saucy when I finished.  On top of that my milk curdled (saved afterwards by my immersion blender) because everything must've been too hot when the evaporated milk was added.  This made enough sauce for 2 1/2 lbs of chicken!!  I simmered and simmered until it was reasonably thick.  I'll make this again (but not too often as I'm sure it's still quite cholesterol laden).  I also added 1 tsp of ginger to my garlic/onion mixture.  It turns out my curdled milk/sauce was a happy accident.  I blended the sauce and everything, even the onions, etc. was pureed.  The sauce was rich and oh, so silky smooth!!  p.s. Only use an immersion blender if you want the sauce to be extra smooth, NOT a regular blender.  If you blend HOT sauce in a regular blender it will ERUPT in a scalding geyser, covering you and your kitchen!!

This recipe was quite easy and came out tasting great. I love Indian food and make it often. I took the suggestion of the owner and used 1/4 cup butter and evaporated milk instead. I cooked the chicken in canola oil and tandoori masala first. Then added the butter and started making the sauce. I had some trouble with the sauce thickening up after I let it simmer for 20-30 minutes.  I had to add a bit more liquid. Overall, this will be my go to recipe for butter chicken...for now =)
Thanks!

Very good. I made this using the evaporated milk and 1/4 cup butter. After I added the milk and simmered for a while, it looked like the milk had curdled--I'm not sure if others have experienced this? But, I continued with the recipe anyway, and it turned out pretty well. If you are making the light version of this recipe, as others have noted, the cayenne pepper and the salt should be decreased--I'd say 1 or 1.5 tsp salt and maybe 3/4 tsp cayenne pepper. I couldn't find tandoori masala in my supermarket, so I made a spice rub of 1 tbs lemon juice, 2 tsp cumin, 2 tsp paprika, 2 tsp garlic powder, shake of coriander, 1 tsp chili powder. The spice rub was pretty good, but I think it was too flavorful and overpowered the delicious sauce. So next time I'll either try to find tandoori masala or maybe take another reviewer's suggestion and season with curry powder.

It was so easy to make and outstanding.  I made some changes to conserve ingredients and it turned out so good, I have no idea if the original recipe would have been better, but I can't imagine it tasting any better than it did.

-I halved the sauce recipe.  I used 4 quite large chicken breasts and still had well more than enough sauce so I think with half the sauce recipe you could use as many as 6 reasonably sized chicken breasts.
-I used only 1/4 cup of butter in the sauce. I also only used one cup of heavy cream and half a cup of evaporated milk (I can't handle that much heavy cream!)
-I couldn't find tandoori masala at the store so I googled it to find its ingredients and made an approximate version of my own consisting of 1/8 tsp each of garam masala and ginger powder, a pinch of curry powder, and 1/4 tsp each of cayenne pepper powder and garlic powder and the zest of 1 lemon.  Again, I don't really know how real tandoori masala would have tasted but mine tasted so good I doubt I would spend the money to ever find out.

So, so very good and easy.  Much easier than some of the other similar recipes.
My husband CRAVES this, and he has always said he doesn't like Indian food.  One of our favourite meals ever.  I serve it with basmati rice and naan bread (recipe from this site).  Excellent.

I used scallops instead of chicken, and 1/8 cup of butter. Sour cream sub in for the rest of the butter and the heavy cream (which also prevented too much sauce).  I prefer a thick sauce, so I added a 4 oz can of tomato paste.  It turned out fantastic!

Fantastic!! My boyfriend cannot stop talking about this butter chicken and brags to his co-workers when he brings the leftovers for lunch. So easy to make, ingredients are so simple to find. Followed other reviewers suggestions to use curry powder in place of tandoori masala (because that's what I had) and using 1 can (1 small can is enough) of evaporated milk in place of the heavy cream and cut out most of the butter as a lighter option. The first time I used the 'fewer pans' options, but found the recipe's cooking suggestions to be easier. However, I've had a really hard time not burning the cream either way. I serve this with white rice & Naan (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/naan/detail.aspx). I will be making this for years to come!

This was delicious!!! I love butter chicken and had no idea that making it at home could be so easy. The only changes I will make next time is less cream...this was seriously way to much, it probably should be one cup, and add more chicken. There was lots of leftover sauce.

I followed the recipe but instead of using heavy cream, I used half & half, and evaporated milk (I wanted lots of sauce.  The chicken took about 15 minutes in the oven and perfectly seasoned the chicken with the tandoori spice.  Those who use the "one pot" miss out on this.  Easy recipe and tastes good!  I found all my spices at World Market.

FABULOUS!!  It may not be the authentic dish, but its pretty darn close.  I ordered it from the local Indian restaurant for my wedding and it was very good.  This recipe was VERY close is not better than that....You can adjust the heat with the amount of cayenne pepper you use.  The Masala is found in any Indian grocery store.  Serve with rice and Naan.  YUMMY!  I will make this again.

Made this for dinner tonight!!  Loved it!!  I followed a couple of the other reviewer's changes.  Backed the butter down to 1/4 cup and substituted evaported skim milk for the heavy cream.  Also substituted the tandoori marsala w/ 1 TBLS of Curry Powder.  This was my first time even attempting to make anything Indian!!  Can't wait to try more recipes!!

Absolutely delicious! Made the light version with 4 tbsp butter and can of evaporated milk. Caramelized onions with seasonings, then added garlic, tomato sauce, more seasonings and a little chicken broth. I then added the raw chicken to this and let it simmer until the chicken was almost cooked. Added the evaporated milk at the end and tweaked seasoning. Also, I used curry powder instead of tandoori masala. Will definitely make again!

This is what I did... used tandoori Masala(Kissan)tomato paste(friends from India told me to use paste) marinated for about 2 hours, Only used 2 cups of cream, onion powder, cooked it all on the  stovetop, used only 1/4 butter,pinch cayenne and only 1 teaspoon salt. This had soo much flavor. I really enjoyed this recipe:)

This was my first attempt at cooking Indian food.  I read the original poster's lowfat version she posted and decided to try that. I used two pounds of chicken and three cups of evaporated milk. I cut the cayenne pepper in half, used only one half teaspoon salt and cut the butter to one fourth cup as was suggested for the low fat version. I followed the preparation instructions as suggested. Since I am a vegetarian, I did not try it, but my family all thought it was very good and close to what they like at the local Indian restaurants. It was a bit spicy for their palettes, so next time I will cut the spices. My daughter also thought I should add some tomato paste to the recipe. I served it with basmati rice with some peas mixed in and with some store bough naan. From my family's feedback, it was a good recipe.

I love the flavor of this recipe.  Don't rush the onions.  Truly carmelize them. It makes a difference.  The tandoori masala on the oven baked chicken is also what contributes to the full flavor profile.  I would not skip that step.  Now, I cannot find tandoori masala in my small town so I used the Tandoori Masala Spice Mix here on Allrecipes.  It worked very well.  I was only missing the fenugreek which I omitted.  I have prepared this twice. I will add about one-half pound more chicken which will need a little more tandoori.  A keeper.

Love this easy recipe, but I don't use heavy cream, I use coconut milk.  I also use a lot less butter.  But the authentic taste is amazing for the limited steps.

I gave 4 stars only because of the modifications.
In an effort to healthify this recipe even more, I used Becel margarine instead of butter and used a moderate amount (1/4-1/3 cup).
I used a can of coconut milk instead of cream/evaporated milk.
I cooked the chicken partially with the onions and garlic after caramelizing, then added the sauce that I had simmering in another pot.

Sauce was a little on the thin side, but will simmer longer to hopefully reduce.
Smelled great, tasted quite nice.
Will definitely make again and again!

the final result was too watery. i had about 2 pounds of chicken in bite sized pieces, and i used 3 1/4 cups of evaporated milk in place of heavy cream. i added lots of cornstarch but to no avail...but this recipe gave me another idea for a VERY simple light dinner! step 5, baking the chicken in the preheated oven with oil is DELICIOUS on its own! very moist and smooth texture in the chicken, and very very fragrant taste :] with some cooked rice, theres a light meal!

W.O.W. This was better than some restaurants' I have been to. No Tandoori masala? Google it. I did and was able to grind up some spices on my own to make it.  I was nervous putting in a whole teaspoon of cayanne pepper and the full 3 cups of cream - but I did anyhow and it was divine. Husband liked it so much that he had thirds. I highly recommend making this exactly as the recipe says. Next time I am going full Indian and making Naan with it because there is lots of delicious sauce to dip it in. Well worth the three pots/pans that it took to make it

I used Curry and added sour cream and milk instead of the heavy cream tandoori and Masala. I was scared to death to try this but it turned out great and husband had 2nds and 3rds.  I also pan cooked the chicken with onions and mixed in the sauce. wonderful I would like to try it with tandoori and masala one day

This was awesome! My husband and I kept saying how great it was all during the meal. I too made slight changes but only because I didn't want all the pots. I cooked the onions and garlic as suggested then I just added the sauce ingredients to that. Then instead of cooking the chicken in the oven I actually covered it with some oil and garam masala (that I FINALLY located at the grocery) and cooked it on the stove. Then I added it to the sauce during the 30 minutes it simmered. Also I added a oinch of curry to the sauce while it simmered. Next time I'll cook the chicken with the garlic and onions and make the sauce all in the same pan. Simply delicious! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Recipe was alright. I had misplaced my original recipe and thought this was close... unfortunately it paled in comparison to my original and I was left disappointed. A little tomato-y. There wasnt anything necessarily WRONG with it... it just had a lot to live up to with what I was wanting and expecting. Probably won't make it again.

Personally, I don't really see the point in making this dish if you're going to cut way back on the butter/substitute milk for the heavy cream etc etc. The only changes I made were to increase the amount of seasonings, and I used tomato paste and water instead of tomato sauce. Served it over basmati rice with fresh cilantro sprinkled on top, and store-bought roti. Very good. Thanks!

I've made this so many times and I just made the perfect version!! I used chicken thighs for more flavor, used 2 tbsp of Garam Masala and 1 tsp of curry powder instead of the tandoori. I rubbed the chicken pieces in olive oil and generously applied curry powder. I omitted the heavy cream and used fat free evaporated milk. I kept the 1 cup of butter because, hey it's butter chicken!!! I also simmered the chicken in the sauce for 30 minutes instead of 5 minutes. I served it over one of those 90 second Brown Basmati pouches for convenience. Next time I will buy two pouches because the chicken went fast!! My four year old ate more than I did!

I used a can of coconut milk instead of cream, added a little sugar to cut the saltiness, added a teaspoon of red curry paste, sprinkled some cilantro over the chicken before baking, transfered it all over into a slow cooker for a couple of hours.  Next time, I would only use 1/2 - 1 teaspoon of salt, no more than that.  But otherwise, this was a simple and delicious dish, thank you!

excellent. I did not have tandori masala or garam masala, instead, I added cumin, pepper, coriander, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg and curry. I did the one pot method that others mentioned. carmalize onions, then add tomato and cream other ingredients. once this is simmering, add chicken and VERY slow simmer for about 20 to 30 minutes. Very good and easy.

Great recipe!  I've been using it for over a year now and our family just loves it.  Because of gluten/dairy allergies/intolerance, I have tweaked the recipe to suite my dietary needs.  I use 1/2 the butter (sometimes you just gotta have a little dairy) and I use coconut milk instead of heavy cream.  It turned out even better!  The family had no idea that I switched it out and just thought I made an exceptionally good batch!  I also use extra Tandoori because I just love the flavour!  Thanks for posting this!  I'm about to make it again tonight!  Off I go ...

To make this a healthy recipe without changing the flavor use...

1/4 cup real butter,  
Coconut milk,  
Don't add the salt,  
Use Coconut oil,  and 
Add veggies!!

Just had this for dinner tonight. Made exactly as written and it was awesome! The only problem I had was that my sauce did not thicken but it was still delicious, I will just add the cream more slowly next time. Served it over basmati rice and even my picky 8 year old loved it. As an added bonus, my house smells divine. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

I make this but use only apx. 4 pats of butter and use one small container of plain yogurt and 1/4 cup of heavy cream and also with the gram marsala add 1 teaspoon Indian curry.  I mix all the ingredients but the cream in a bowl and coat the chicken (I like my chicken on the bone)and place in a baking dish or a clay pot and pour sauce over chicken and bake I serve it with honey drizzled over top to take away the bitterness and bake at 325 unttil chicken is done and tender. I also used chopped tomatoes along with tomato sauce.

My husband and I have made this many times, and now I see that the original creator has posted in the comments about how it has been lightened up with about 1/2 the butter and switching out the cream for evaporated skim milk.  I always just used half & half but if the evaporated milk doesn't change the flavor a lot, then I'm changing it next time I make it.  This dish is soooo good, and the leftovers the next day are even better!  I had 2 people at work ask me for the recipe and that was just based on how it SMELLED!  I serve it with basmati rice that contains a little butter, 7-8 cardamom seeds and some dried parsley.  Perfect Indian dinner!

My family *loves* this recipe as a special (yes, very high-fat) meal.  I can't find tandoori masala.  I just mix some curry powder and cayenne.

My son requested I try to make butter chicken for his midwestern girlfriend, so I tried this recipe.  It was fantastic...I added a little less salt and it was still a bit too salty for me, but no one else minded.  I think starting with one teaspoon salt and then correcting seasoning before serving would make this recipe just about perfect.  I bought garlic naan at whole foods, and it was like an authentic Indian meal.  Thanks to the submitter!!

Everyone I cook for knows this as my specialty now, and it's my favorite thing that I make. First time I made it (I was new to cooking,) I misread the "1 teaspoon cayenne and 1 teaspoon garam masala" as one tablespoon of each...and it was the best mistake I ever made. Mind you, I do like it spicy, but if you do to I promise it's incredible that way. I use more garlic, as always, half the butter (that's plenty) and coconut milk instead of the heavy cream- better flavor that way. Give this recipe a try, you won't be sorry.

Very yummy. I used evaporated milk instead of cream. I ended up using diced tomatoes and just used the immersion blender to smooth things out. Easy recipe!

This was a good recipe, the whole family really enjoyed it.  Next time, I will cut down the cream a bit. . .I thought it was too creamy and the curry spices were hard to taste with all that cream.

Yummy!  This was fantastic!  I did some small substitutions, instead of vegetable oil on the chicken I used plain yogurt.  I also pierced the chicken with a fork to tenderize it and let it marinate in the mixture for 4 hours before grilling on a hot grill.  As suggested by the originator of the recipe to make it lower calorie I used a can of evaporated milk and 1/4 cup of butter.  I also cut back on the cayenne to 1/2 tsp and found it pleasently spicy.  Thanks for such a great recipe!!

My family loves this recipe. Every time someone mentions Indian food, they aren't happy until I make this. I've made it with full-fat cream, and with reduced fat cream. Will try with the evaporated milk to reduce fat and calories -- and will see if the family notices the change.

So tasty. I absolutely love Indian food, love how spicy most is and the amount of flavor it has. This is by far my favorite, my husband and I LOVED it!! We used tandoori garlic bread for dipping. I suggest buying dark meat chicken if you can find it, it is so moist unlike white meat. Thanks!

Delicious! Mine came out a bit soupier than I would have liked but it tasted great. The only change I made was leaving out the tandoori masala because I couldn't find it at my local grocery store.

This was fantastic! I, too, cut down on the number of dishes involved and on the fat. I added the chicken to the skillet after cooking the onions, then added the tomato sauce (actually, I found I had only one 8-oz can of tomato sauce, so I used that and a can of tomato paste), and the rest of the ingredients for the sauce. I added a little bit of brown sugar as some others suggested, and I let it simmer until the meat was cooked. Then I added some cauliflower and let it simmer again until that was cooked. To cut down on fat, I used only about 3.5 Tbsps. of butter initially to saute the onions, and I didn't add any more butter or oil after that. Also, instead of 3 cups of heavy cream, I used one cup of heavy cream and one cup of 2% milk.

I did the reduced fat recipe. 1/4 cup of butter and 1 can of evaporated milk. Used curry instead of tandoori masala. I didn't love it and wouldn't make it for myself again. HOWEVER, my sister and bf LOVED it.

Nice sauce and good flavour - however the sauce turned out a little bit runny for me. Fixed it with a tablespoon of cornflour mixed with a bit of milk. I would also say to use the full amount of salt - I used about half and definitely needed more :) Otherwise nice recipe!

Love this recipe!
So easy and full of flavor. I got a lot of compliments on it..
Of course traditional butter chicken is made with boneless chicken breast but it tastes as good with whole chicken; especially for those who prefer thighs. Instead of baking the chicken, I cooked it in a sauce pan with the same amount of cooking oil because I don't like to wait for the oven to preheat :P. I replaced the 15 ounce tomato sauce with a 12 ounce tomato past, it has less water so the sauce takes less time to reach the thickness I want. 
It's great with rice, pita bread, or Naan bread
Defiantly a recipe to try!

Awesome recipe!  I added a little bit of curry to the sauce and we love it!

Delicious! I made the lighter version as recommended by the original author of the recipe, and made it in one pot as suggested by others. Wonderful! The flavors were complex and robust and every bit as good as we've had at restaurants. My husband loved it and is planning on having the leftovers for breakfast tomorrow. He drank beer with his dinner and I had red wine, and we both agreed that either complements the dish nicely. Served this over a jasmine rice, which echoes many of the spices, and it was one of the very best meals I've ever made (and we're known for being pretty good cooks in our house!). Will definitely make this again. A winner.

This was the best Indian food I have ever cooked. Possibly the best food I've ever cooked. I substituted the cream for evaporated fat free milk (and a splash of half and half), used onion powder because I had no onion, and used only 3 tablespoons of butter in the sauce. The first time I tasted it as I cooked, my mind was blown as to how delicious it was. The final product was even better, and I'm going to make this a staple in my kitchen.

This was really good.  I will definitely make again.  It's way better than my local restaurant.  I gave it five stars, because, although it's Butter Chicken, I think it might have been too much better as my sauce didn't thicken and I prefer sauces a tad bit thicker. But a really tasty recipe.  I also did not use the tandor masala or the curry.  I made in one pan as suggested in previous reviews.

Amazingly easy and tastes pretty good and always better the next day. I would not say its point on reasturant flavor but a nice and cheap alternative to going out and it whips up pretty quick. Next time ill play with the flavors to make it a bit more complex and see what happens.

This was AWESOME!!  It was pretty darn close to the restaurant that we frequent.  The only thing I will do next time is let the chicken bake a little longer, or maybe even put it in the crockpot so that it is super moist. DELISH!  Thanks for sharing!

I gave this recipe four stars because I lowered the fat (less butter and evaporated milk) and I did the one pot method.  The taste is spectacular!

Our family of 4 found this to be quite tasty and there were no leftovers! I followed the directions of another reviewer! To cut back on the amount of pans used, carmelize onions & garlic in butter, add sauces, and I found that I needed to let it simmer on a very low heat for approximately 30 minutes prior to adding chicken. Then simmered another 25-30 minutes to cook the chicken. One added note, I don't know about anyone else's grocery store, but I did not find garam marsala OR tandoori marsala in the ethnic OR the spice aisle of any grocery store in my general area. I found other spices that contained similar ingredients, and that is what I used in place of the garam marsala and the tandoori marsala. Still very good and we will definitely make this again.

This was delicious!!  I had to make a couple of adjustments based on what I had.  I used curry instead of tandoori masala, and chili powder instead of cayenne pepper.  I've experimented with Indian cooking before, but this is the first time I've made something that I wouldn't be ashamed to serve my Indian friends, even though I know they'd say it was too bland.  ;)  Perfect for me though! Yum yum.

I made the recommended reduced fat version with less butter and evaporated milk and it was excellent!  Also cooked the chicken in the pan first, removed and then did onions/garlic, etc. to reduce complexity.  Easy and very tasty!!

I really liked this recipe. I had to order the spices from the Spice House and my husband would have preferred pork. The clean up was kind of a drag, takes 3 pans to cook all this in but it was worth it.

This is so GOOD! The sauce took a while to thicken, so I added a few tablespoons of parmesan cheese. I only had about half the amount of tomato sauce called for, so perhaps this affected its thickening ability. Served with rice and also last-minute sauteed broccoli on the side. Next time, I'll buy or make some naan to go along with it. It's so easy to put together. Can't wait to make it again!

Absolutely delicious! The Masala's are easy enough to make with the more common household spices. Search for the recipe or subsitute. I'm so glad I don't have to drive 1.5 hrs to have good Indian food now! This is lovely with the Naan bread too! Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic. As the author of this recipe later suggested I replace most of the butter with evaporated milk. And I decreased the amounts of spices a little bit. This is one of my favorite recipes.

I've been searching for an easy butter chicken recipe, and this is it! I did alter the recipe. I used 1/4 cup butter and 2 cups half and half cream instead. I also added 1/2 teaspoon tumeric powder. This turned out just like the restaurant's butter chicken!

This is delicious and very easy! You just need to be super careful when adding the cream to the tomato that you not let it boil at all, as this will cause the cream to curdle. I personally think it needs more spice, but this is good for serving to a crowd of people who may not like things too spicy. I think you could reduce the amount of cream quite a bit without compromising the taste.

I made this dish today and it was absolutely fantastic! It tasted exactly like the Butter Chicken that I order from my favorite Indian Restaurant, Bombay Cafe. I used the lower fat option the original writer of the recipe suggested with a few minor modifications. Since I had a 1/4 cup of heavy cream in the fridge, I added that along with the can of evap. I used only one stick of butter in the sauce (1/2 cup). The butter that I used was KerryGold Pure Irish Butter which has great flavor. I only used 1 and 1/2 tsp of salt instead of 2 as previous reviewers suggested. I used 2 pounds of boneless skinless chicken thighs cut up instead of chicken breasts because I prefer dark meat and I added 1 packet of Equal sweetner to the sauce which really brought out even more flavor. For those who had a hard time finding the different Masala seasonings, try going to an Indian grocery store. That is where I found them. I used the Garam Masala mix by Shan. It was $1.99 for a small box and I used the Tandoori barbeque Masala mix by MDH which was $1.59 for a box. Not that it should make a difference, but for those that might be interested, I used a Vidalia onion which is a little sweeter than a plain yellow onion, minced garlic in a jar by Spice World, the 15oz can of tomato sauce by Contadina and for the evaporated milk, I used the Carnation brand. Finally, I have a Nu-Wave oven so after seasoning the chicken chunks with the Tandoori Masala mixture, I put them in the Nu-wave and cooked them fo

This was my first time making Indian food and it was great. Make sure you taste the recipie though, because I had to add MUCH more tandoori and garam masala. It was much to tomato-y for our liking, so I added probably 2 more tsp of tandoori (right into the sauce) and 4 or so more tsp of garam masala to make it taste just like our favourite Indian resturant. I also had to thicken it with some flour and water because the sauce was very thin. Over all though, it was excellent and I'm glad to have a great recipe to make at home. It will save us a lot of money when we're craving Indian food!

My husband and I love this dish. I made it twice now and each time has been successful. I've made it in one pot like one reviewer suggested and used curry powder instead. The second time I made it I also doubled the chicken, I found there to be a lot of sauce the first time.

Excellent. I made it this on Sunday afternoon but didn't serve it until Monday night; letting the flavors seep was a great idea. I also added some chopped cashews for a little extra pizzazz.

This recipe is delicious!  Though the sauce is a little thin.  Just add a little flour with the cream and it thickens it up.

Great! I tweaked it a bit. I caramelized the onions and garlic in 1/8 of a cup of butter and water and then simmered them with the tomato sauce, a cup of half and half and the cooked chicken for about 10 minutes. It was delicious and little healthier. Thanks for the inspiration!

So delicious! I added cornstarch to thicken it up a bit because it was a bit thin for me. Otherwise it was perfect... will repeat, even my 7 year old sister liked it and asked for seconds, and she is a super picky eater!

This is a terrific recipe.  If the amount of butter troubles you, I think it's safe to reduce the quantity.  Also, I bet light cream would work well.  My advice is experiment with the butter/cream...the recipe seems versatile. Also, I added a can of petite diced tomatoes and they added a nice thickness/texture. Green peppers would also go well.  I'm Indian, so I'm a tough critic of most Asian recipes...this one is truly great!

This is excellent! Rarely does a recipe work exactly as it should, and this one does. The chicken was tender and moist, the sauce was superb... and it was terribly easy to make! I did up the cayenne and the garam masala in the sauce a bit, as I like it a bit more spicy and flavorful, but it only took a couple of shakes to bring it up to a good, solid level. I will definitely make this again and invite friends over. This makes a HUGE amount of yummy sauce!!!

This was great and very authentic tasting for such few ingredients.  I cut the butter in half like others suggested and used 2 cups whole milk and 1/4 cup plain yogurt. It came out fantastic, great recipe.

This is awesome. I found the garam masala in the bulk barn. I have made it with several variations and it always turns out great! My husband will actually eat rice with it! You can't mess this one up, it has become a weekly dish at our house, made with many variations! I like to add cooked cauliflower right into the sauce!

We followed Naomi's advice with 2 additional things: Tandori Powder and Sugar. I know that sugar is one of the main ingredient as traditional butter chicken is slightly sweeter. If you love this dish, then prepare it next time with sugar... try a little bit and keep adding until it's slightly sweeter. Don't turn this into a dessert! Two days later we went to an indian restaurant, I couldn't tell the difference between the two.

HOLY COW!!! This is the easiest most AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS butter chicken receipe. I have made it about 30 times now and have even tried it with coconut milk instead of heavy cream and reduced the butter by half. You wont notice the difference. Fantastic! It’s a HIT at every gathering I bring this to. Tip: Rather than cook the chicken separately just throw it in the pot after sautéing the onions. Cook through. Then add the rest of the ingredients. No need to make more work for yourself. One pot is all you need.

I made the lightened version of this dish with 2% evaporated milk and 1/4 cup butter.  I know this all seems like a lot of fat, but you need to have fat, properly emulsified, to get the right texture to the sauce.  Low fat = watery cream of tomato soup texture.   I felt that there was more than enough salt in the butter and tomato sauce, so I did not add any to the recipe.  You can always add it at the table, but you can’t take it out! I like Indian foods and spices, so I upped the garam masala a tad and put a little freshly ground coriander in as well.  Marinating your chicken in spices and baking it separately is an important step in getting the flavour and texture just right.  There’s no point in wasting good ingredients by not following basic instructions.  This makes quite a lot of sauce, so I scoop out and freeze a small container of it to use on leftover chicken breast.

Fantastic recipe I add about a table spoon of toasted cumin seeds to the gravy when making it, other then that its perfect. I have made the healthier-ish and unhealthy version obviously  unhealthy is better but the healthier version means I feel ok making it a little more often then just special occasions. If you want healthy you probably shouldnt be looking at BUTTER chicken anyways.

This was fabulous!  It was our first time making Indian food.  We didn't have to travel out-of-town to eat Indian food; we can just make it at home.  This is probably one of the best dishes I've ever had.  It was truly a joy to prepare and eat.  My husband and I have leftovers for tomorrow.  I just ate it for dinner and already I'm looking forward to dinner tomorrow.  Thanks for this recipe!  (I followed a recommendation in another comment and I cut the butter down to 1/4 cup, and we used a can of 2% evaporated milk instead of the heavy cream.)

Quite good, but a couple of suggestions.  First, follow the updated/experimental recipe suggested by the original submitter here in the comments to lower the amount of butter to 1/4 cup, and use a can of evaporated skim milk instead of the heavy cream.  Second, if you're fairly spice averse (like me), I'd recommend using little to no cayenne pepper.  The indian spice mixes already have some of this heat built in, and I find it a little more preferable to my (admittedly boring) Midwestern American palate.

I made this in one skillet using mn's suggestions for change, which were using 4 Tablespoons of butter and evaporated skim milk. I browned the onions and garlic first, removed them from the skillet, browned the chicken pieces which I had sprinkled with a little garam masala (didn't have tandoori masala)and drizzled with oil, then added the butter and all the rest of the ingredients with the onion/garlic mixture and cooked it enough to blend the flavors. I added only one 12 oz. can of evaporated skim milk because I wanted the sauce thicker. I must say the next time I will add the evaporated skim milk last because even though I didn't boil it, it did start to curdle a little so I stopped the cooking right away. At first taste I thought it was too strong of a flavor but when I served it over rice it was incredible! I loved it. It would also be good with naan bread. The leftovers were fantastic the next day for lunch as well. This is a very flavorful dish that did not take very long to prepare. Easy and delicious.

this was so frickin awesome. We ate it for, like, every meal for two and a half days straight. When we got down to the last bowl, my girlfriend and I got into a fist fight over it.  She won, obviously, so I cried for a while, and then started making another batch.

After reading reviews, I used 1/4 cup butter and one can evaporated milk in place of the cup of butter and the heavy cream. Everything else I stuck to the recipe. Turned out wonderful!

This was really tasty and easy to make!  It's my first venture into Indian cuisine.  I wasn't able to find the spices at two of my local stores (hint: Don't wait until 6pm on Valentine's Day when you are cooking dinner to go look for obscure Indian spices), but one of the stores had a spice collection packet just for Butter Chicken and it contained the same spices.  I followed the recipe exactly otherwise and it turned out very good.

Great recipe, 10/10 will make again!
We didn't use as much butter as stated in the recipe and halved the cream. We omitted the cayenne pepper as well. We also did everything in one pan, the onions, the sauce, the chicken. Turned out great. :D

My husband loved this, and he never trusts my attempts at Indian food!  This was absolutely amazing, my only thing I might change is the amount of cayenne pepper I put.  I put half of what the recipe stated and it was to spicy for the kids and I.  But this truly is an amazing recipe.  I followed it exactly, and will definitely be making this again!

So tasty. Made it exactly as is. Have made it a few times now. Yum!

I know people look at the nutrition info and think it's off the charts, but quite frankly, I think the sauce is WAY more than 6 servings. I have halved the sauce recipe before, and it was still enough to feed my family with leftovers. I'd say it's easily 8 servings.

I LOVE this recipe (and so do all my coworkers and friends). This is my go to recipe for a potluck dish - guaranteed to be delicious, even when I accidentally burned the onions a little. I use the light version posted by the original user in "The most helpful positive review". Tastes wonderful and less heavy than the original version. I can no longer eat butter chicken in restaurants because I like this one so much!

I always use 1/4 cup of butter and half the salt to try to make this a little more healthy, but I like to call this a "sometimes food"

This is absolutely the easiest butter chicken recipe to make at home, while still keeping a very good authentic butter chicken taste. Definitely restaurant quality, the only thing i changed was used 1-2 quantity cream and 1/2 quantity evaporated milk. I also only used 1/2 a tsp of cayenne pepper as I was feeding small children, still had just enough of a warm kick.

I do not have much experience with Indian food, but my Daughter has turned me on to butter chicken so l decided to look for a simple uncomplicated recipe and this is the one that popped out at me. . I used this recipes with a few modifications as stolen from other reviews, l used ¼ cup of butter, a can of evaporated milk, and coated the chicken with curry powder instead of the tandoori masala. For a first attempt l was very impressed. My Daughter gave it the big thumbs up so l know it must have been good. Also, my burger munching Son gave it a try and to all of our surprise, he liked it. Next time l make this l am going to cut back on the cayenne and add a teaspoon of brown sugar to take the edge off. I   think this will be a very good easy go to dish that l am looking forward to making again and again. Thank you for posting this.

Butter Chicken is my favorite Indian dish and this recipe does not disappoint. It was so easy and so brilliant. Even my picky kids liked it. Delicious!

Excellent blend of spices, though I'd suggest adding cayenne pepper if you like the heat.  Cooked it as directed and then in crockpot.  Served it over rice.  Very filling.  Leftovers the next day were even more delicious - the sauce thickened and spices had blended more.  I will be using this recipe again.

I love this recipe! Like some other reviewers I make it all in one pot. Intead of cooking the chicken in the oven, I slice it thin and marinate it in yogurt and spices (garam masala, cardamom, cayenne, ginger, etc.) while the sauce is simmering. Then I add it and cook for 10-15 minutes. I also usually add more spices to the sauce as well. We like a little heat!

This was phenomenal! I followed the recipe as written, the only small change I made was I sprinkled a tiny bit of curry into the onions when sautéing them and omitted the salt. I was nervous at first how much the sauce smelled a lot like tomato soup but after it simmered the spices took over! I served it with basmati & warm naan. I can hardly wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow!! It was SO good!

Great recipe! I used the "light" version (1/4 c. butter, 1 can evaporated milk, 1 can light coconut milk) and made minor alterations. Doubled the onion, added all spices to onion/garlic after 10 minutes and sauteed everything for 5 more. Then added all liquids and pureed everything together in a blender until smooth. Then put the sauce back on the stove to simmer. I started the chicken in another pan and when about half cooked, added it to the sauce to simmer on low until done. Served with Basmati rice. My family RAVED about dinner! Thanks so much!

I've made butter chicken numerous times for my family in the past - we love the complexity of flavors that can be achieved even in a mild curry. Wanting a quicker version of the awesomely delicious restaurant style butter chicken I usually make, I decided to try this recipe out. Not a fan. This curry is bland, very heavy and is much too creamy, and is definitely lacking any depth of flavor. I doubled the amount of garam masala because all I could taste was butter and cream, and even then there's just so much missing from the curry. Sorry, I really wanted to love this, but I'm going to be sticking to my usual recipe that includes ginger paste, tomato paste/puree, and fenugreek leaves. All in all, this recipe is for someone who wants something easy, extremely mild and extremely (overly) creamy.

This is a great recipe. I doubled portions of the garlic and onion, caramelized it all. Half went into the simmering sauce; half went on top of the chicken (I used chicken breasts) which baked at 375F for 50 minutes. My husband had two servings of everything. The sauce is remarkable. This recipe will make you an instant food genius.

FOR ALL THE BUTTER CHICKEN JUNKIES OUT THERE.... This is a tremendously amazing recipe... Good enough to open a dam RESTURANT with.   Don't listen to other reviewers that said it was close or didn't taste authentic... It's PERFECT.  Now I did do 3 extra things different 
1) I doubled the garam masala
2) I added 10 oz of tomato sauce and 5 oz of coconut milk to make a total if 15 oz.
3) I added at the end 1/2 cup chopped cilantro and mixed all together!

Thank you M N for posting this perfect recipe
And for all of you that think 1 cup of butter and 3 cups of heavy cream is too much..... Well  your wrong.... It's as authentic as it gets and do good.  If your trying to watch your caloric intake then use the lower fat recipe suggested by other reviewers!

This was so delicious!!! I made the mistake of using salted butter. Do not add the salt called for if that is what you are going to use. I let this simmer for about an hour just to try to reduce the sauce a bit and then added some green beans at the end. This just may become a regular meal in my house.

I enjoyed this so much! I couldn't find tandoori masala, so I just used a Penzey's curry spice blend instead. I will make this again, so I will keep my eyes peeled for the tandoori masala, but it turned out beautifully even with the substitution. I also used cut up chicken thighs instead of breasts. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I'm not interested in low-fat "diet food", so I used all 3 cups of cream as called for, and the whole cup of butter... so rich and delicious! Can't wait to make it again!

To cut down on calories I substituted the heavy cream for 1 (15oz) can of coconut milk and 1 cup of low-fat yogurt.  I also didn't use as much butter, only 1/2 cup. My friend, who is from India, said that it was the most authentic tasting butter chicken he has ever had in the US.

Excellent, turned out really nice followed it to the letter! Next time will probably use less butter and not double cream so it's less fattening! Otherwise just fantastic, thanks to the author for sharing tasted better than restaurant butter chicken.

Sorry, can only give this a 3 star rating.  Fixed as others did with the evaporated milk and in one pot but had to add almost 3x the spice to get it to taste anything but bland.

Love love love this! I never thought it were this easy to make butter chicken! I just don't buy tandoori masalam because I don't use it for anything else so I marinate the chicken with curry powder.
And like everyone else.... Cut down the butter I never ever taste the difference and use evaporated milk by carnation and then adjust with heavy cream! Enjoy!!!

Definitely a keeper! Easy and delicious. Didn't have the garam masala, used curry powder instead and it was tasty.  Didn't have to thicken the sauce as it's thick enough for my taste.  Added some tofu in there as well for leaner protein.  Will try to substitute the half and half next time I make this again.

First Indian recipe that passed husband and kid under 10 approval! YAY! I didn't find garam masala in my local store here in Germany so I used the allrecipes recipe for making my own. I also substituted one can of coconut milk for some of the cream. I loved it, my husband wants to try it with the cream. I did put in a bit more cayenne and garam masala for fear that it wouldn't have enough flavor. I paired it with an Indian Rice pilaf recipe here too. 

I'd say this feeds 6 if feeding my typical portion size, feeds 4 if serving restaurant portions or "seconds." Kids asked for leftovers in their lunches and there was enough - but my kids aren't big eaters by dinner time.

Delicious. Made changes only because of missing ingredients or laziness: baked the chicken breasts first, in a slowish oven, and then diced--no added oil. Substituted curry paste for tandoori masala because we were out. And we usually have jasmine rice, but we were out, so I just used some regular noodles. Substituted half and half for heavy cream because I forgot to thaw the heavy cream. Still, very tasty, and smelled wonderful. I'd like to try this again with reduced-fat ingredients and less butter, just to see if it's palatable. Great recipe! Hubby is just impressed that I made something "ethnic" for once. ;-)

Fantastic!  A little spicy for my little girl but my son loved it.  I'd recommend using half the cayenne the first time you cook it and using the lighter fat version.  I roasted some zucchini in a separate sheet pan while the chicken cooked and it was delicious and helped to tone down the heat of the chicken.  I rolled it in the same spices and oil.  Cauliflower would be great too but it was $$ at the store that day.

OH MY GOSH!! Not only was this a very easy recipe, and pretty much with ingredients you already have on hand, it was super yummy!  My boys and hubby went crazy for it and I had to make it a couple nights in a row.  It is definitely a regular in our rotation now!  I only had (and couldn't find) tandoori masala, and that worked quite well.

My only suggestion: double it!

I thought this recipe was SO easy to make and VERY delicious. The sauce can be used with anything, veggies or meat. I made it a second time substituting coconut milk for the heavy cream and it was superb! I like to rate a recipe using the ingredients listed so it is a true rating!

This is delicious and so easy to make - lots of pans though, I think I'll try it differently next time.  I found the spices I needed at the Bulk Barn.  This one is going to be one I'll be making time and time again.

I made the "light" version. I changed some of the spices a bit (less salt, less cayenne pepper ouch) but nothing too dramatic. We liked this a lot, though next time I'll probably skewer the chicken pieces and cook them on a cookie rack on top of a cookie sheet so I can get them a bit less steamed (mine gave off a ton of liquid due to having been frozen, a problem I solve by cooking on a cookie cooling rack on a cookie sheet). Just personal preference on that. Thanks for sharing!

The first time I made this recipe, I didn't have heavy cream, garam masala, or tandoori masala. As I usually do when I'm cooking, I substitute stuff and have fun with it. So instead of the gm and tm, I used ground cinnamon, black pepper, ground tumeric, and ground ginger. Before adding the onions and garlic to the butter, I put the spices in the butter until it got all brown and sizzly. Then I added the onions and garlic. When that got all caramelized and fragrant, I added a can of tomato sauce and salt to taste. Instead of heavy cream, I stirred in a couple of tablespoons of sour cream I had left in the fridge, and drizzled in milk while stirring until it looked like butter chicken sauce. For the chicken, I just baked it in the oven for 40 minutes at 375F, chopped it in cubes and threw it in the sauce. Simmered it while I cooked the basmati rice. It was AMAZING!!

Today I made the recipe closer to what this one calls for (though I only used 1 cup of table cream, and half a cup of butter). It's still delicious, but not as fragrant. I think the difference is I forgot to add the spices to the butter until it got all brown and sizzly!

I will definitely keep working to perfect this. So easy and fun to make. Yum!!

Loved it. Combination of original and other reviewers created a simple, low-fat, one-pot version: caramelized the onions with the garlic and some butter; added everything else except the chicken and simmered gently for 10 minutes; added the chicken, a green pepper, and a few carrots and simmered for 25 minutes. Swapped the tandoori masala for curry powder, and swapped the cream for a can of coconut milk and a can of evaporated milk. Cut the butter to 1/3 C total and reduced the salt to 1 t.

This was a very easy recipe and it tasted pretty authentic. My friend and I cooked it together and tripled the recipe so we would be able to freeze leftovers. However, to get the spices to meld more and develop more depth, I marinated my chicken pieces in yogurt, tandoori masala, lime juice, salt, pepper, grated ginger and chopped onion for about 6 hours.  We found that this also made the chicken more tender. It was a huge hit with kids and adults alike.

oh. my. goodness.  SO GOOD! Only thing I did differently was to coat the cubed chicken in a little olive oil and curry (enough spice to cover them pretty well) and baked it. Added chicken to simmering sauce after it was baked through and then let it simmer until it was time to eat... sometimes a hour, sometimes just 15 minutes. Always delicious!  And I used half cream and half evaporated milk.

I have a tip  to make this even quicker!  I didn't actually try this recipe but it is similar to my recipe.  One day when I didn't have a lot of time I used a supermarket rotisserie chicken instead of the usual chicken breast and wow, was it good!  Just shred up the rotisserie chicken and add to the sauce, it is wonderful.

It was delicious but we couldn't find either of the Marsala spices in the store so we used some curry spice as a substitute and it still turned out good. We also only used two cups of cream instead of three and the sauce still was very good. It was a little on the spicy side (which is good for me) and I imagine this could have had to do with one less cup of cream or not having the two other recommended spices. So if you don't like spice, either cut down on the Cayenne pepper or use more cream.

I'm a fan of Indian food but had never ventured out to make a dish myself. I was a little intimidated but once I had all the right ingredients and started to follow this recipe, I soon realized how simple making butter chicken could be. This recipe turned out wonderfully. My family gave it rave reviews. I served the butter chicken up with Basmati rice (following the instructions from allrecipes.com), warm naan bread, and steamed green beans. A great dinner I will definitely serve up again.

WOW! I love butter chicken in restaurants, and I can't believe I made something that tasted sooo good! I'm a beginner in the kitchen, and this was awesome and easy! I started with the intention of making the one skillet version, but 6 pots/pans later I resigned to that idea. :-) I also used the evaporated milk, and used curry in lieu of the tandoori masala, and it turned out great. I used 3/4 cup of butter instead of the full cup. My wife loved it, and my 11 yo daughter ate it all, although she wasn't crazy about the spiciness, but said she'd have it again. Thanks so much for this recipe!

We love this recipe.  We also replace the cream with evaporated milk and only use enough butter to carmalize the onions, about 2 tablespoons.  We make this for friends and it is always a hit.

Okay, this is one of my favorite recipes.  So, as written (or amended, with the less butter and canned milk), it is spectacular.  However, it is also really good if you just throw everything in a dutch oven (I even use frozen chicken breasts) and just let it cook on low until the chicken can be pulled apart with a fork.  I usually use light coconut milk instead of the evaporated milk.  So, anyway, the way it is written is spectacular.  But, this recipe is so good that even just thrown in a pan to cook itself, it is delicious!

Oh yes, this is SO good and SO easy!  Be sure to make some rice to go with it so you can "sop up" all of that yummy sauce.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe, it's definitely a keeper!

This was amazing! Best butter chicken recipe I have tried so far. Next time I will cook the chicken first, set it aside, then use the frying pan to carmelize the onions and then add the sauce ingredients in with the onions, and finally re-add in the chicken to save some dishes :) I played with the cream and tomato sauce levels until I got them how I wanted it and it was great. I'd be happy to serve this to anyone!

This was delicious and quite easy. I followed another users advice and used 1 can of coconut milk instead of 3c of heavy cream. The flavor was fantastic. I did have to add a bit more masala (approx an additional 1/2-1tbs) simply because I like a robust spicy flavor. I served this dish with rice that had been steamed with cumin seeds and green peas. Thanks for sharing!

This is fantastic.  Used a cup of milk because didn't have enough cream.  Added a TBSP of curry powder and garam masala to the sauce.  Sauce is thin, will thicken with cornstarch.

Ok, I changed the ingredients a lot, used coconut milk instead of regular milk, didn't use the tandoori spice on the chicken and browned the chicken in the pan then removed finished the sauce and added it back in.  But tht's how I like to cook, it was Very Good!

I followed the lower fat version with the coconut milk (I even used lite coconut milk) and less butter.  My family loved it!!  Definitely a make again recipe.

The easiest and tastiest butter chicken I've done! I just sauted garlic and onions together till light brown then added the spices, since I didn't have tandoori masala substituted it with meat masala and added 1 more teaspoon chilly powder ( we love spicy foods!), stir-fried for a minute then added the chicken pieces and cooked till brown, add tomato sauce, simmer till chicken is cooked then poured the cream and stirred until just bubbling!

Delicious, I used condensed milk instead of the cream and margarine instead of butter, and didn't have any cayenne so I used chili powder.

brought some for leftovers and co worker wanted to take it from me

Super easy and so tasty!  I made the low fat version with 1/4 cup butter and 1 can of condensed skim milk.  I only had an 8 oz can of sauce so I added a tab of tomato paste.  I only put in a little salt and added some curry powder to the chicken since I did not have tandoori masala.  Other than that, it was really good with some basmati rice and some homemade naan!  I will make this again!

This recipe is fabulous! I've made if a few times now and each time it's been great. I, too, only use one pan, and I tend to cook the onion and the garlic with the cut up chicken. I prefer to use boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of chicken breast, as I think they give the dish a more authentic flavor. This dish is so good, I'm making tonight for my birthday dinner. Thanks for such an awesome recipe!

Fabulous dish! Just as good as I get at Chicago's Hema's Kitchen. I lightened it by using 1/4 C butter and half & half because that's what I had on hand. I will try the evap. milk next time.

This was delicious, although I wouldn't say it was all that easy.  Maybe it's easy compared to other ways of making Butter Chicken.  I had a hard time finding the Tandoori Masala. I was able to find the Garam Masala in the spice section of my grocery store. I didn't really want to spend too much time looking for the other spice so I ended up ordering it online from The Spice Sage which would be a good alternative for those living in more rural areas. You'll want to try not to have leftovers because it smelled awful the next day! I will definitely make this again!

Oh my ...so good!  I love masala and this was sooo good.  I didn't use the Cayenne pepper because our Indian place only had the Tandoori Bbq Masala and that was SPICY! I also only used half-n-half since the Heavy Cream was a bit pricey!  My kids loved it...I made homemade flat bread and basmati rice in my cooker and it was perfect.  Am eating some leftovers now!  Thanks for sharing!

Easy and YUMMY! I did the lower fat version of this recipe.  Not quite as good as the stuff I get at the Indian Restaurant...but then again, it is a spectacular Indian Restaurant.  Served with basmati rice and had a regular feast!  :)  Thanks!!

This is the best easy recipe we've found so far for butter chicken. A great starting point but could be improved with a few more spices. I plan on experimenting with what I have in my spice cabinet, such as coriander, ginger, cardamom, etc until I find the perfect combination.   We used about 1/2 of the butter and about one cup of light cream. We also added some Ginger to the sauce and I'd highly recommend skipping the added salt as it's unnecessary.   For the chicken, I coated mine in curry powder, paprika, and chili pepper before marinating in tandoori paste. I'd recommend marinating for a few hours to let the flavors sink in.   Be sure to serve over fragrant rice, like basmati.

i really liked this recipe. my husband was not as impressed- but we did substitue the garam and tandoori for american curry as suggested by someone else- so that may have affected the original intent of this recipe.

This was so easy to make and turned out really good. A little too spicy for me but perfect for my husband. Had to seek out an Indian Specialty store to find both the spices. Used the evaporated milk and 1/4 cup butter version. Served with naan and basmati rice. A definite keeper.

Great taste!  I added a bit more cayenne along with 1 1/2 cups cauliflower, one chopped roma tomato and some chopped cilantro. I used garam masala on the chicken instead of the tandoori masala.  We loved it!!

I thought this recipe was great!  I did the lower fat substitution and it was really good.  At first the recipe seemed kinda fussy and complicated but it wasn't at all.  Make sure you carmalize the onions really well.  Delicious and simple recipe..thank you!

This is a wonderful dish that all who've eaten it rave over!  I followed Naomi's changes to keep in one large pot, but I did marinate the chicken pieces in the Tandoori masala prior to adding to the sauce.  Lovely!

I used the low-fat version with curry instead of tandoori masala on the chicken and used only a pinch of cayenne. My son is still telling people about the yummy Indian dish I made! I served it with basmati rice and ready-made Palak Paneer I bought at the grocery store. So easy and delicious. Thanks for sharing!

Yum!  This was a hit!  I too used the lighter version and only used one large skillet.  I carmelized the onion and garlic with the chicken in a little bit of olive oil then added the other ingredients.  I used 1 tsp of salt and a little less cayenne.  It was still a little spicy for me but my husband LOVED it.  Next time I will add the evap milk a little later in the cooking process.

We used a third of the required butter, as well as replaced cream with half and half. We tried this recipe served colder, as well, and it was very tasty! Reminder to self: Do not salt the chicken meat!

Try using chicken tenders instead of chicken breast. It does make unusually tender chicken with this recipe (if not overcooked). Thought it was delicious!

My boys LOVE this dish!  And I also cook it using the 'one pan' method in my dutch oven.  I prefer using tandoori masala than curry, but have made it both ways and have had equal applause.

This is a wonderful recipe. I also tried the lower fat version - only 4T butter total a 1 can of no-fat evaporated milk.  I also did it all in one panand used 2 teaspoons of garam masala witha couple drops of hot sauce and no tandoori masala.  Creamy and tasty.  It is a definite new family favorite.

I made this dish for my husband's birthday and it came out perfect and authentic.   I made this version since it was a special occassion.   I made it again and used the lower fat version with evaporated milk and 25% of the butter.   It still tasted very good and my son said he liked it better.   This goes perfectly with the nan recipe on this site.

I made this for my boyfriend and he said "babe this is reallly good, it's better then eating out at a restaurants!" He said it was reallly good at least 5-6 times!! I am vegetarian so i didn't try it, but it sure smelled reallly good! It was really easy! I did marinate the chicken over night with tandoori masala. And I used half a cup of butter and evaporated milk instead of one cup of butter and heavy cream!  In the end, we did add more cayenne pepper b/c he likes his Indian food spicy!!!

This is an excellent recipe!!!....  This was delish!... The only change I made was that i lightly buttered then dusted the chicken with flour before browning. I then placed the browned chicken in a crock on low to finish cooking and kept the sauce warm separately. I did not have any garam masala, so simply used ground peppercorns and nutmeg to substitute..  It was a hit!  Next time I will serve over rice.

oh my.  loved this.  used one pan (cooked onion, garlic, added chicken and tandoori....when cooked added rest.....yum yum yum.  Will definately leave out the cayenne next time, used only half and still too hot for my liking.  Also no tomato sauce on hand so used 1 can of Rotel diced tomatoes with jalepenos instead (which likely added to the heat).  This will be a staple in our house.

I never knew making butter chicken at home was so easy! I love making things a little more healthy (and using what I have on hand). Sauteed onion n garlic in 1/4 c butter, added 1tbsp garam masala and 1 tbsp curry powder, 2 shakes of cayenne, 1 small can tomato paste, and 1 cup warmed milk with 2 tbsp coffee mate mixed in. Warmed that mixture then added the raw bite size chicken breast pieces and simmered covered for 15 mins. Garnished with fresh cilantro and served with brown basmati rice. SO GOOD! Thanks so much!

Delicious! I just wish I had some naan to go with it. I did make some changes to the recipe. I always halve or use only a quarter onion, because I'm not a big fan of onions (I also put in four times the garlic, because -- you guessed it -- I'm a big fan of garlic). I also switch Steps 2 & 3, which times things better. I recommend a side of coconut rice (brown jasmine rice and coconut milk instead of water).

Awesome....only adjustment we made was using 2 cups of cream instead of 3. It was a little spicier then I like...but tolerable. Hubby loved it. Very close to what we are used to. Thanks.

My husband said it's the best thing he's ever eaten!  I did make a few changes.  I made it in a crock pot for four hours on high, so I didn't want to add the cream at the beginning and have it boil for that long.  I caramelized the onions and garlic  then added them to the pot with the chicken, spices (I had to use curry, paprika, and a dash of chili powder because of lack of masala), can of tomato paste and enough veggie broth and a splash of white wine to make a sauce. I also added sliced celery, carrots, and peas.  Just before serving I added the cream and served over brown rice.  I'm sure it's great the original way, too.  I just had to make a few alterations for the situation.

I was very pleased with this chicken. It wasn't too spicy for my husband, which is usually an issue with Indian food. It was great over rice, with naan bread.

I too made a low fat version and was very happy with the results. Used 1/4 cup butter, chicken broth, 1/2 cup half-n-half. I didn't realize I was out of tomato sauce so I used a can of C* Tomato Soup. Served with the lentils and carmalized onions recipe from this site. Awesome, definite keeper for me.

I found this quite tasty!  I only used 1/2 cup of butter and instead of cream, I used regular milk and thickened it with cornstarch.  I also used about 12 large roma tomoatos instead of the sauce because my house is overflowing with them at this time of year.  I found the heat temperature just right - spicy but not painful:o)

I like to make things easy so I made everything in one pan.  I tried the low fat version and it was delicious.  I had no luck finding Tandoori Masala so I used Madras Curry.  I also skipped the oil and coating the chicken  I just threw everything in once the onions and garlic were sauteed, adding the chicken last.  Served over basmati rice.  My husband and I loved it.  I'm sure I'll make it again and again.

I made this on Saturday and it was absolutely delicious although very rich.  Not too spicy but really tasty.  I let my chicken cook for about an hour in the sauce so that it took on more of the flavour and became moist.... Thanks for a lovely recipe.

I think I can confidently say that butter chicken is my favorite meal and this recipe was delicious and fairly easy to make. I added the following ingredients which I think really added complexity to the flavour: cumin, cardamom pods, cinnamon, honey and brown sugar (every time I've had butter chicken, it's been a bit sweet so that's how I like it). Garnished with chopped cilantro and almond slivers. Heavenly!

Wonderful recipe! This is one of my favorite Indian dishes, and this is by far the easiest recipe I've seen, and it tastes just like I'd expect.
I followed a few of the suggestions from other reviewers to make a significantly healthier version. I cut down the butter to 1/4 cup as suggested by the author, omitted the oil and cream, and doubled the masala to 2 tsp. Probably not as rich tasting as the original, but we loved it.

I cooked the onions in a large stockpot, and then added the sauce ingredients to the same pan. I used some leftover cooked chicken and didn't have any tandori spices, so I just added the chicken to the sauce and let it simmer on low for awhile.

I love this recipe. It is easily the best Indian recipe I have tried so far. My only suggestion is to use less cayenne pepper if you don't love really spicy food.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I accidentally made it with a 12 oz can of evaporated milk and 1 stick of butter...I think I should have used a 5 oz can of evaporated milk.  Still pretty good, the basmani rice does it for me, it smells like buttery popcorn when it cooks

Pretty good butter chicken. I'm not sure this is as good as the "authentic" stuff at India House, but it's darn close (especially for making it at home). I really didn't want to consume 2 sticks of butter and 3 cups of heavy cream, but was afraid that a low-fat version just wouldn't taste the same (and I was  craving the REAL stuff). Next time, I'll try it with less butter and evaporated milk as submitter "mn" suggests. I found garam & tandoori masala at a local spice specialty store (I think using these spices makes all the difference - the $'s spent were so minimal, it was totally justified). I followed the recipe to a T except for adding a bit of cornstarch (mixed with water) and bringing to a boil during the final cooking step (I thought the sauce was too thin otherwise). Served over basmati rice with a sprinkling of fresh cilantro and a side of naan. Deeeelicious!!!! Thanks for sharing : )

This has a good flavor, but tastes and looks nothing like I used to eat in Western India, nor like what my Butter Chicken masala package instructs (which I bought from India). Maybe it's a regional difference. Anyway, it is good, but I prefer the other way I make it with just a couple spoons of yogurt and no cream at all, with fresh tomato puree, and a spoon of peanut butter or cashew butter to thicken it up a bit. I have enough creamy-tomato-chicken Indian recipes so I don't think I'll make this anymore. Thanks though!

Very nice recipe to build upon. The one I made used 10% cream and only 1/3 cup butter, but I made it simmer for 45 minutes. Also, since spices tend to lose some of their flavour after a long simmer, after stirring in the chicken, I added an additional 1/3 portion of all the spices mentionned, as well as 1/4 cup lemon juice and some tabasco.

I also did not have tandoori masala -- which is just a pre-made mixture -- so I just used the equivalent 2 tbs of garam masala, garlic, ginger, cumin, cayenne pepper and lemon juice.

It's good and relatively easy for what it is, but not quite authentic. I prefer recipes that call for ground nuts in the sauce.

Use all the ingredients exactly as stated but did make it all in one dish as several reviewers suggested.  At the very end, I did add 1/2 cup lite sour cream.  OMG....DH is still complimenting me.  It does make a large amount but that was okay with us.  Froze the sauce and will use another day.  Thank you so much for "perfecting" this dish and sharing.  :)

I substituted 2 cups 2% milk for cream since it's what I had on hand.  It worked beautifully and was still very rich since there's so much butter.  I do look forward to trying it the right way!  Served with Indian Chapati bread from this site.

This is a very tasty dish. The only thing I did different was to cut the butter to 1/2 c & used Half n' Half instead of cream...I just couldn't bring myself to use 2 sticks of butter for a 4 serving dish! But even with 1/2 c butter it was still plenty rich. I probably could've even cut it back a little more. The sauce is more thin than I expected it to be, but it's great for serving over rice. Oh, one other thing, I also just sauted the whole chicken breast in the pan with some curry (didn't have tandoori), salt & pepper, removed it, then sauted the onions & garlic.

We really liked this. I was practically  licking my fingers! I don't have anything to compare this recipe to as I have never had butter chicken. I purchased the tandoori masala at an  Indian food store (lots of them here in Toronto). There was almost an entire wall dedicated to different masalas. I think it really added to the flavour. I enjoy hunting for ingredients I have never used before. The sauce has an odd consistancy, but I have been advised by my friends in the recipe exchange that when cream/milk is mixed with tomatoes the sauce is supposed to look that way. I served this with rice and green beans. Thanks for a great meal.

This recipe was AWESOME!!!!!!!  This tasted exactly like Chicken Marsala.  I have been recipe hunting for this for a long time and have tried two different recipes before this one that were alot more time consuming, way more ingredients and tasted nothing like the original.  I have finally found a winner and its sooooo simple.  My boyfriend finished all the left overs.   Thanks for the recipe!!!  I did take use curry like the other reviews suggested because I didn't have tandoori.

WOW WOW WOW  This was great.  I substituted the garam marsala for curry powder and marinates the chicken for about an hour.  I also used a lighter cream and cut down on the butter by about 1/4 cup.  This is one recipe that will take first place with me.

This is soo delicious.  I didn't have tandoori masala, so I used plain tandoori with some garam masala.  I also took and mashed the chicken a bit with a potato masher to make it more melt in your mouth.  Very good on rice and naan bread.  Have made again and again.

Fantastic! I also followed Naomi's advice to make it the 'easiest' Butter Chicken. I did however use the tandoori spice by just rolling the uncooked chicken cubes in it and then adding them to the simmering sauce. Will definitley make again, once i've burned off the calories!

Delicious dish after the suggested adjustments! I didn't bother baking the chicken and just let it cook in the sauce on simmer until done. I kept it at a low temp the entire time and it turned out great! I also decreased the cream by half because 3 cups seemed to much for me. Definitely reduce the cayenne pepper if you want a milder dish. Great recipe and tips!

Oh man. Y’all are either going to love me or hate me for the wild and crazy variation that I just tried. You should know that I have never had butter chicken so I have no preconceived expectations. But I’m here to tell you that if you up for being brave, I’m really enjoying this. I don’t care that it’s not “authentic,” like you have had at your favorite restaurant. I do keep garam masala, and I did use that and followed the recipe in a general sense. I made this in one cast iron pot. I used one stick of butter, onions and garlic.  I used one can of coconut milk, a can of crushed tomatoes and hold on to your hats... a block of cream cheese! I thought it needed a little more zip so I added another pinch of salt, an extra dribble of crushed red pepper and sprinkled some curry on at the last minute. I mean...don’t knock it until you try it. I had multiple blocks of cream cheese I needed to use up and one just materialized in my hand as I was considering options. I’m glad I did. Next time maybe I’ll try it the way it’s intended but I’m telling’ ya what...mmmmm!

Excellent! My husband is not normally fan of exotic spices but said this was really good! I served it over jasmine rice. I only used half of the cream and I cooked this in one large pot, so I didn’t use the oil on the chicken. I let the chicken cook in the butter and red sauce and didn’t add the cream until the chicken was cooked through. Then I just let the cream warm up, stirring through the chicken and sauce. Glad we like it because now I have the spices!

This recipe was flipping fantastic.  I have never tried to cook Indian food from scratch before, and it was fairly simple.  ( If you cant find the masalas, as other reviewers mention, there are other recipes on this site for them).  Anyhow, this  smelled amazing, tasted even better. It may just be one of the tastiest things I have ever made. I was a bit overwhelmed by the amount of cream so I used 1/2 of the butter and 2/3 of the cream in the recipe, and still had plenty of sauce and taste.  Next time I may try the evaporated or coconut mile, and I may cut the pepper a bit, as this was a bit too spicy for my picky eater kid.

I just made the recipe just how it is and absolutely love it. The only thing I added was pepper flakes since we all like it spicy. One thing I will change next time will be 2 cups of cream instead of 3.

Loved this recipe.  Made it exactly as given.   This is now added to my favourites   I will maybe add a little more chicken next time as it seemed like a lot of extra sauce.  So easy to make!  Thank you for sharing

I made this over two days, cooking chicken and onions/garlic one day and then making sauce and putting it all together the next night after work. I used the author’s recommendation to lighten it up. It was absolutely delicious and my family loved it (well not the picky teenager but he doesn’t count)! This is saved and will be made once or twice a month! Served it with basmati rice, naan, and aloo gobi (Allrecipes). Wonderful!

Worked out well making this casein-free with dairy-free Greek yogurt alternate and ghee.  After browning, I bloomed the spices then added the rest of the sauce ingredients. I used skin-on bone-in chicken quarters (leg with thigh attached) and dry rubbed the tandoori then set it sit for 30 mins, then added more tandoori rub and then baked at 425° for 20 mins skin-side down.  Turned chicken over and turned oven down to 375° and baked for another 20 mins. Removed from oven and added to the sauce (along with any crispy pan bits) then followed the recipe from that point forward.  Served with rice cooker saffron rice and mustard seed roasted green beans (using some of the rendered chicken fat from the roasting pan).

Made exactly as directed in the recipe. It was AMAZING! The only change I would make is to decrease the cayenne by 1/2. Otherwise it was perfect. I served it over quinoa and garbanzo beans since we are going low carb and it was still great! Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this recipe 4 times, twice I got perfections. Twice I got just okay. I finally figured out the secret - Simmer really REALLY low (like just barely bubbling). Too much heat causes the cream to separate, and the sauce loses it's creamy flavor and smooth texture.

Loved it! I made the lighter version that she mentioned in the comments (sub 1 can of evaporated milk instead of cream and cut the butter to 1/4c). Still phenomenal!

I agree with other reviewers regarding the amount of butter, cream, and pans involved in the original recipe. I saw the reduced calorie version and did a variation on this, and only used about 1/4 c. butter total, and used a can of evaporated milk. Unlike some reviewers I sautéed the chicken and tandoori in a skillet prior to adding to the sauce. I only used about 1/4 t. of the cayenne pepper because my daughter isn't big on a lot of spiciness, but used the regular amounts of garam masala and tandoori. I didn't add salt because I thought with the canned tomato sauce and other spices there was enough. Next time I think I will add some veggies. I saw one review that used coconut milk, which I also thought sounded great.

Loved this recipe. I made it a second time with the following changes:
Whole milk instead of heavy cream. .
Everyone who has tried either version has had good things to say, this will be a regular meal in my house.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would. This was one of the most delicious recipes I have ever gotten from here. What a flavor explosion!!!!! And it was so easy!!!! I will admit, I didn’t measure the amount of tandoori masala, garam masala, and cayenne pepper that I used but OMG it turned out PERFECT!!!!! I think adding or removing anything from this recipe would ruin it. Thank you for sharing this recipe. It will remain in my rotation of favorites in my household!!!!

It’s such a shame that people do not know how misled  they are when it comes to fats! Good healthy fats like butter from grass fed cows is packed with health as is cream that is not ultra pasteurized ! I use raw cream from Organic Pastures from grass fed pastured cows! It is not fat that causes heart disease but unhealthy vegetable oils ! In fact this recipe is great for the Keto diet if you leave carbs out like serving over rice or pasta! Very delicious recipe full of healthy ingredients! By the way ghee would be good or coconut oil!

I prepared this as written.  Next time, I will make half the sauce recipe as it was way too much for the amount of meat.  I will cut the salt proportionately in half as my family and I felt it was too salty.  Very good, restaurant-style flavor and very rich.

I made it as is except used chicken thighs instead of breasts.  It was so good! The sauce alone was worth it. I have two vegetarian and vegan family members and they don’t know what they are missing.  I suppose you could make it with tofu and fake butter.

I loved this recipe!! I found it greasy, so I ladled the excess butter out and used paper towels for the rest.  I didn't have whipping cream so I used 2% milk and chicken stock to keep the the mixture hydrated.  I used peppers and onions, what I had around the house.  I finished with cilantro and naan as well as Jasmine rice.  LOVE this recipe

This is the perfect easy buttered chicken. It’s not too heavy on the tomato flavor, not overly spicy. It’s delicious. I’ve made this for at least 10 people at different times and they have all asked for the recipe. If your trying your hand for the first time and looking for something delicious this is it. Tip: crank up the heat a bit by adding an extra helping of cayenne pepper, and some chili flakes, also using skinless boneless chicken thighs changes it up and makes it very tender.

Added tumeric and garam masala to chicken while in oven. Used thigh instead for juicier chicken. Microplaned garlic instead of mincing to increase its taste. Did not use the tandoori masala, so I used cumin, coriander, and cayenne.

I made the low fat sauce and used chicken for one dish and steamed cauliflower for a vegetarian dish. Both tasted great. I stirred the seasoning mix onto the steamed cauliflower and it was very tasty. I also added garbanzo beans to up the protein, but they were not a hit with my 12 year old son. The sauce was also very good with naan bread. I recommend! BTW, fenugreek can be replaced with the same amount of dijon mustard.

I've made it many times and always a crowd pleaser! Not for the faint hearted because there's a LOT of butter and cream in this. But if I wanted healthy, I would've gone for a salad.

Made this in 1 pan , cut up 2 large chicken breasts, added the tandoori masala and let sit while I prepped and go everything else ready.  Sauteed the onion, 2 garlic cloves, some minced ginger in a couple of tablespoons of butter.  Once caramelized, I added the cayenne and garam masala and let the spices toast until fragrant.  Added the tomato sauce and a little over a cup of cream.  Then I added in the chicken and simmered until cooked.  I added fresh chopped spinach and chopped cilantro right before serving with some spiced basmati rice.  It was the best home cooked Indian dish I've made, thanks for the delicious recipe, and excellent advice from the author and  those of you who cooked this previously.  I will be making this again and try with the evaporated milk.  Oh and I added a couple of teaspoons of sugar as someone else recommended.

The recipe was great as it quick and easy. I searched for recipes with onion, tomato and cream and this came up. I had the Indian spices, which was helpful but I did not have the quantities for butter and cream so I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1 cup of heavy cream instead. I divided up the sauce in two and made one with salmon and other with chicken. It reduced the fat content but it was still delicious. My son who is 20 months ate the whole bowlful with chicken and ate the fish. Will definitely do this again!

Amazing! I only had 1 1/2 cream so I used that plus whole milk.  I cut the butter by 1/8 c.. I thought there'd be enough for leftovers tomorrow, but everyone ate 2 servings!  Haha!  I'll definitely make this again!

Fantastic, followed the recipe to the letter and this dish was so delicious. My son, who is a pretty picky eater, inhaled it. We served it with heated garlic nan bread. Plan to make this often. I froze some of it, hopefully will reheat ok with the cream?

I had to mix the spices up from scratch (recipes for both can be found on this site) and rather than mix both "garam" and "tandoori" masala (which are both called for here) I made onlly the "tandoori" and used it in the sauce as well as on the chicken pieces while they were oven baking.  Other than that I followed the recipe as written and enjoyed it very much - as did my husband.  I will make this again!

I added Squash spirals to the dish.  Used Yogurt instead of Cream.  These changes were positive to final outcome.  Served with Naan.

Super easy recipe! If you don’t have Tandori Masala in hand, make your own. 1 t each: grnd ginger, cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric, salt & cayenne pepper. Perfect recipe as is. I did cut the butter to 1/2 C though.

Excellent, restaurant-quality butter chicken. I made my own tandoori masala from another Allrecipes recipe. I loved the complex aromas developing throughout the cooking process and seeing the buttery mixture melt and reform before my eyes. The color is very rich, although it really isn't too complicated of a recipe and doesn't involve that many ingredients. The recipe is easy to follow and I enjoyed the whole process. Made with some turmeric rice on the side and it was still good 4 days later. This one's a definite keeper!

I made this and it was very flavorful and the chicken was wonderfully tender. I couldn't find tandoori masala, so I used garam masala to also coat the chicken.

I also made rice and added garlic and onions in before the rice cooked and it came out well.

If you like butter chicken, this recipe is perfect.

Made this for about 25 people and they went absolutely crazy for it! The only thing I had to change was the spices, I didn't have garam masala or tandoori masala so I had to mix some of my own while making some substitutions (like cardamom, I didn't have any so I used cinnamon instead). Use all the butter it really makes it rich and amazing tasting

AMAZING. Absolutely love this recipe. So easy to make and incredibly flavorful. Perfect for a cold day. A little on the spicy side for me, but I’ll just add less cayenne next time. Would recommend and will definitely be making again.

This is a great recipe, added a little more spice.  Need to work it down a little being single the default six servings is a bit much.  Had it twice last week then froze more than half for a few weeks from now.

Soooo good, it tastes as good as an Indian Restaurant, perfect amount of spiciness for me (I dont like too much heat), but easily adjustable if you prefer more of a kick!

The only adjustments I made were to replace half the heavy cream with condensed milk, and I added yellow tumeric and yellow squash lightly sauteed. 

I did have an issue with the thickness of the sauce, it seemed a bit runny to me even after simmering 40 minutes. I just put like 2 Tablespoons of flour in it. It thickened right up and I couldn't taste the flour at all!

I was new to cooking Indian and this was not intimidating like most recipes are with the ingredient list, but the pay off was amazing! My wife and I will be raving about this for weeks!

3.5. When making this make sure to cut down on the salt as mine came out quite salty. I cut the fat content by using plain milk for a portion of the cream and using half the butter called for. I didn't have tandoori masala so I experimented with cumin and chili power. I also reduced my pans by cooking the chicken in the pan before the onions, removing them and then cooking the sauce and onions in the same pan. This was a great place to start and came out tasty! Just too salty.

Loved it! And more importantly the kids loved it too. Takes a while to cook, but just stay with it.  I did use coconut milk instead of cream the second time I made it and I liked it better. Other than that - spot on!

I had much higher expectation based on other reviews.  I used the heavy cream and butter despite lower calorie options.  This dish is perfectly find for a normal weekday dinner.  But this in no way resembles real Indian food.  The dish is bland.  It should be dramatically more spicy.  This seems like one of those dishes people who never travel make and think it's authentic.  It's nothing like the Butter Chicken you will find at an authentic Indian restaurant in your area.  It's edible.  I guess it's good if you have kids or fear of the heat used in Asia by half of the world's population.

But I won't make this again.  It doesn't even closely resemble true authentic Indian Butter Chicken.  It's the super watered down American version.

Wonderful and easy recipe. The flavor was great! The next time I make it I'm going "kick up" the spice/heat a little. Yum!

I did not add the garam Marsala spice and the cayenne pepper spice. We don’t like spicy stuff.  Instead I added the tandoori spice.

This is the second time I have made this recipe. However, This time I forgot to grab the tomato sauce, so I blended up a jar of home-canned tomatoes. I also forgot heavy cream, so I sacrificed my coffee cream to replace. Both times I pan fried the chicken instead of using the oven (too hot this time of year) and added the tandoori spice to the sauce rather than putting it on the chicken. Once the sauce thickens I add chicken and let simmer for about 15mins. Turns out FANTASTIC! I will make this time and time again. A 5-star hit in my house!

WAY too much salt - it was nearly inedible. I had to add two more cups of cream and milk to cut the salt. I won’t add any salt next time. Be careful if you make this.

I've made this a couple of times, once with the original "full fat" version and once with the lighter version suggested with evaporated milk. Although the light version was fine, the original recipe was so much better. I did think it was way too salty as is so I cut the salt back to half and only used a total of 4 TBS butter, otherwise I pretty much followed the recipe as is .  I would recommend if you have time letting the whole thing simmer for 30-60 minutes after adding the chicken.  It pushed it from good to amazing.  It rivals the butter chicken at our favorite Indian restaurant.

Sooooo good! I did the reduced calorie option. 1/4 butter. One can of 2% evaporated milk. 1 teaspoon of salt.

I used Basmati rice as well.  I'm in heaven.

Sooo yummy. I've been doing Keto lately so this is definitely a high fat option for a tasty dinner. Since I can't have the naan or rice to go with it, I added a head of chopped up cauliflower in with the sauce to cook. SOOO good, pretty sure I licked the bowl. I ended up using a low carb pasta sauce instead of regular tomato sauce, works fine. I would make again, maybe with less butter because I don't think you really need as much as it calls for since there's so much heavy cream. Also, I just pan fried the chicken instead of baking to save time.

I'm disappointed. There is just way too much butter and cream. 
I'm not sure how anyone can enjoy this sauce cuz I used HALF the butter and HALF the cream, then subbed a can of evaporated milk yet somehow this was still so buttery. I even lowered the amount of salt and added a bunch of extra tomato sauce to counteract the fatty taste. Like... My family feels sick. And this recipe is buttery-er than most dishes from my local Indian restaurants. 

Will try again with even less cream and butter.

Absolutely amazing. But what wouldn't with loads of butter and cream! I completely eliminated the pepper as my wife is very sensitive (almost allergic) to it. I took one tbsp of curry and mixed it into the butter and caramelized onions with 2-minutes to go. I also boiled sweet potato, cauliflower and carrots - mashed it all up and used it instead of rice. Will try this again but will try to find ways to bring the calorie count down. WOW!

Try this with an Instant Pot!  I used all the same ingredients but first sautéed the onion and garlic with some of the butter and vegetable oil. Then add the rest of the butter at the end of sautéing to melt it. Add all the other ingredients including the chicken. Set to 20 minutes high pressure and then slow release for 15 minutes.

Fabulous!  I used paprika instead of cayenne because that’s what I had and tandoori paste instead of tandoori masala because that’s all I can get in Podunk.  IMO, there was too much sauce and I will probably increase the amount of chicken next time.  Delish!

This is one of the staples of Sunday dinner at my house.  I don't like the consistency with the sauteed onions and garlic, so instead, I add a dash of onion and garlic powder to the sauce while it's cooking... Tried in the crock pot once, but the cayenne took over.

Definitely the Caucasian version of this classic Indian meal. Flavors not as robust as I would have liked. Also the color is way lighter than it should be. It’s ok at best. Interested in how actual Indian people make this dish.

I have made this several times! As is! Lol. I will do the one pot method tonight. I am doing the Keto diet so it’s fantastic for that! I just don’t eat the rice or naan bread with the family! We love it so much, I usually double it! I do add extra cayenne, curry, tandoori and Garam as we like it super spicy and seasoned!

I'm lactose intolerant so I used coconut milk and margarine. I stuck to the recipe initially, but as it neared finishing, tasted very weak and bland. I added way more spices than called for. Like 1/4 cup or even more, I didn't measure. I just kept tasting it. It was also very funny, so I turned it up and boiled off the excess moisture until it was a consistency I liked. It turned out amazing. I make it regularly now.

I tried it and it's superb!!

My modifications:

1) 1 can of coconut milk instead of heavy cream;

2) 2 cups of spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce;

3) I made my own garam and tandoori but instead of ground ginger I used 1 tablespoon of fresh ground ginger (I keep the ginger in the freezer and grind it whenever I need it);

I've made this both with both the original recipe and the lower fat version with 1/4 butter (instead of 1 cup) and 1 can of evaporated skim milk, and I liked the lower fat version better. I've tried to cut down on pans and do simultaneous steps but you really miss out when you don't bake the marinated chicken first. And you really really need to use the spices as is- make your own version of tandoori masala if you can't find it pre-made!

This is by far the best butter chicken recipe I've tried.  I used the low fat version - 1/4 C butter and 1 can no-fat carnation milk.  I didn't put any cayenne pepper in it because I don't like heat.  Next time I'll cut the butter to 1/8 C to see how that works.    We are vegetarian so instead of chicken, I put the tandoori masala  in with some bread crumbs, diped cauliflower in a mixture of egg white, water and oil, and shook in the bread crumb mixture, then deep fried for about 5 minutes.  Delicious.

My family does not like spicy - did not use the tika tandoori, instead used more tika masala. Big hit.

I searched for hours looking for a recipe for Butter Chicken that was just like my favorite Indian restaurant. Then I reviewed many of the reviews for this recipe, noting the modifications and suggestions therein.  I made it very, very close to as written in the original. The only changes:  I added 2 Tsp of brown sugar (I always add sugar, when using tomato sauces, to cut the acidic effect). I also used rounded teaspoons on the garam masala.  Also, I made sure to cut the chicken into small pieces, which helped them bake faster in the oven (I baked it for 20 minutes).  
I must say, it came out PERFECT, and I couldn't be happier. I would not change a thing, except inasmuch as I am a chili-head, if I made this JUST for me (and not my finicky kids and wife) I MIGHT (probably not) double the garam masala and the red pepper...or add some ghost pepper flakes.  That's just me though. Honestly, Butter Chicken is SUPPOSED to be mild, and in truth I have never encountered it spicy-hot.

I made this tonight and it was wonderful!! I did make a few changes, I used 1/2 cup of butter instead of 1, and also used 2 cups of cream and 1 cup of milk instead of 3 cups of cream. For the chicken, I took the advice of one of the reviewers and made a mixture of 1/3 cup of honey yogurt, half a lemon juice,  a dash of cayenne pepper, 1 tbsp of garam masala, 1 tbsp curry powder, a light sprinkle of chili powder, mixed it all together with the cut up chicken pieces and grilled it outside in a grill pan until fully cooked. This added a depth of flavor and smokiness to the butter sauce that was absolutely DIVINE!!! There were compliments all through dinner, I served with grilled garlic naan bread, coconut rice and sauteed asparagus. Try it this way, you will not regret it!

Wow, this was delicious! I used cut up leftover chicken, tossed it with curry powder (rather than tandoori powder) and let it sit while I did the other stuff. I cut the butter back some, and only used half the cream. I used garlic paste, which I get in big jars at the international grocery, because there's no such thing as too much garlic.  I might try the evaporated milk others have recommended next time, just to see how it comes out, because as super delicious as it is with a truckload of heavy cream, I can't go eating like that very often. I served it with cumin rice and it was just lovely. Looking forward to seeing how it is as leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

I followed the recipe to the letter, then added a little more cayenne and garam masala (1 tsp of each) later on.

Frankly, it just tastes like butter-flavoured butter.

As others suggested, I used 1/4 cup butter, 1 cup cream and doubled chicken.... I used garam masala because it's what I had and added a pinch of curry... delicious!  Slow food in a fast food method - everyone loved end result and I loved how quick and easy it was.  Thank you!

This recipe is delicious following the directions. I personally think adding a couple tablespoons of cilantro (or more if you like cilantro) and mushrooms (4-5 whole mushrooms chopped up)  adds a bit more flavor and makes it that much more delicious.  I have no idea how many times I have made this recipe, but it's a huge hit every time.

It was a very good dish. The only thing I did different, was that I didn't have cream so I used 2% and to thicken I used a big spoonful of vanilla greek yogurt (I know it sounds weird but it was all I had and needed to improvise.  We didn't even taste the vanilla and it thickened to perfection). The dish turned out amazing!

I felt it was a nice change of pace when servered over basmati. I felt it could have used a great deal more heat, but that is a personal preference. The family thought it was "fair" hence the three star rating

My family asks me to make this all the time. We make ourselves sick because it’s so good we can’t stop eating. The only change I make is to add a little more chicken. I serve it over basmati rice and a side of garlic naan.

I've made this recipe several times now and it never fails to be a favorite with everyone I make it for. I do have to make a rue to thicken the sauce a little, but the flavor is perfect. I also make mine with dark meat instead of boneless skinless chicken which gives it an even more flavorful taste.

This is a very easy recipe to make and is an undeliverable delicious dish – well beyond my expectations.  I have gone to local Indian Grocery Store to purchase my spices and I recommend that you shop for authentic spices in your local Indian Grocery stores - or search the internet for other options.

This turned out ok but not great. I subbed evaporated skim milk for the cream, and a reduced amount of margarine for the butter so this is probably the reason

You need to add 5x more garam marsala then the recipe calls for and you can do with out the onions which do nothing for it.  I omitted the garlic also.  I also used a lower % cream and then made it with homo milk and some flour, Tasted great!

This recipe is delicious! I replaced the cream with yogurt & added brown sugar as the yogurt can create a sour taste. Also added more garaam masala and veg: chick peas, carrots & butter beans. Served with couscous & naan bread. Absolutely lovely!

I made the lighter version and it was delicious, albeit salty. I doubled the cayenne because it wasn't hot enough when I tasted it but next time I will only use 1 tsp salt. I also used light coconut milk instead of evaporated milk to give it a nice twist.

AMAZING recipe! I adjusted the amounts of some of the spices according to taste, but overall, this recipe is perfect.

I'm not a good cook by any means, but this recipe was super easy for even a novice like me. I can't get enough of the sauce. I added chipotle peppers (on hand), and it complimented the other spices.

The only caveat would be to watch the chicken in the oven more; I'm not used to cooking chicken at all, so I'll probably use a meat thermometer next time. Also, I tried to make a healthier version with greek yogurt and less butter, but the sauce was still good.

I really like spicy food and not real big on creamy stuff so I substituted the cream with beef stock and added chili powder also. I sauteed the chicken and  used old bay seasoning while I did it.. I sauteed the onions and garlic then added the spices and liquid. I put it all in a slow cooker on low for 5 hours and it came out great..

I am not an expert on Indian Cuisine, but this recipe was delicious! I served it over Bastami rice and it was all I could do to not lick the bowl!!! I only used half of the cayenne pepper that it called for and it was perfect for my taste. I homemade my Garam Masala mix because I didn't have any, and it was very easy because I had all the spices on hand.

This was delicious! I followed some of the reviews and reduced the butter and used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream. And I substituted Penzeys Arizona Dreaming for cayenne pepper, and curry for tandoori masala, because that's what I had in the house. Even my kids loved it! Added peas, and next time, also adding mushrooms.

Amazing don't change a thing! Everyone in my family loved it, including the kids (just to clarify I hate when ppl leave that as a review) cause it's hard to please my 3 kids all at the same time. But in this case was a winner at our dinner table. Will definitely make again

I completely massacred the preparation- but used all the ingredients except for the oil. I chose to make this in my instant pot! I sautéed the onion and garlic in the butter and then added all the seasonings and tomato sauce along with the chicken (my chicken was frozen so I cooked this on high pressure for 30 minutes) and did a quick release. Afterward I added in the cream. I served it with naan bread. Quick Monday meal!

I loved it.  Making it for a second time.  I always low cal. this recipe.  I used coconut milk and lower fat cream to cut the fat and I don't use butter.  Still turns out delish.  You do not need to use butter and heavy cream.  I use very little extra fat.  If you use a non stick deep pan, you do not need to use a lot of butter oil or margarine.  Maybe a tablespoon or two max.

Made as advised with one exception - swapped out the vegetable oil for coconut oil because I had it on hand and stirred up the chicken with oil and spices on the warmed pan before popping it in the oven (gotta keep the coconut oil liquid). It was delicious! Picky eater husband liked it more than the stuff from

I made this recipe  according to the directions and it turned out great. I would suggest using boneless skinless chicken thighs because they have more flavor. Also if you have a grocery store nearby that sells Naan the onion and garlic flavored ones are a great addition. I also tried it with both jasmine rice and basmati rice and I liked the basmati best. It can be found in individual servings at Kroger or I'm sure any other grocery store in the rice aisle.

I cut down on the butter and cream, it was just too much and didn't seem necessary.  I caramelized the onions and garlic in 2 tbsp. of butter and then added 1 1/2 cups cream along with the other ingredients. I didn't remove the onions, I just added everything together. I then added the chicken and cooked it in the sauce instead of on a sheet pan in the oven. Less pans and clean-up! Everything came out nice and was really tasty. I served it over rice.

I am going to make this recipe this week for the first time, but I can't use a recipe that has a rating count--or any related number--of 666. So if my rating is used and the number becomes 667, I will make this and come back to provide a proper review. I put five stars because of HOW MUCH I LOVE butter chicken.  Thank you.

It turned out perfectly and our guests loved it!  It's better with plain crushed tomatoes rather than tomato sauce that comes with other spices included.  I left out the cayenne so I could serve it to the kids as well - who also really enjoyed it.  Would definitely make this again!

This is one of my favorite recipes YUM! Be warned - unless you have some kind of super power you will be busy for at LEAST an hour prepping and cooking this . Worth it - yes, easy - no. I recommend using half the salt and cayenne pepper then add more by taste at the end so it's not too much.

By far the best Butter Chicken I have EVER had.  And it was so easy to make.  My variation was instead of using tomato sauce, I used a can of tomato soup and a can of fire roasted tomatoes.  OUT OF THIS WORLD!  This will be the only Butter Chicken recipe I ever use.

I made this, following the recipe almost exactly except I used a can of pizza sauce in place of the tomato paste, as I didn't have any on hand. I had to use a little more cayenne pepper than it called for to disguise this fact. But other than that it turned out lovely and my family loved it. I made it according to recipe so not the low fat way- so I probably would not make it again much if ever- just too many calories. But it was delicious!

LOVE IT! I did however make some changes to this recipe to make it healthier and milk free.

First for a milk free recipe, I substituted canned coconut milk for the heavy cream. Make sure it is the good stuff that is super thick when it comes out of the can. You can also mix it up with more liquid coconut milks if you think it is too thick. (I prefer a thicker sauce, but some people don't) also... (BE SURE IT IS UNSWEETENED!) Sometimes I get the kind in the carton at the store (unsweetened of course!) and mix half of that with half canned. It depends on the consistency you want.  The butter can be substituted with coconut oil and I found that I didn't need as much butter (or oil) as the recipe called for. So use less! (You can use up to 1/4 of the amount stated in the recipe and it will be fine.)

Another way I have made this is by substituting the heavy cream with the following ingredients:
Yogurt, greek yogurt, sour cream, milk, kefir  (all unflavored and unsweetened)

Usually I just mix these together until I have the right consistency and amount needed for the recipe. Every time it has come out good! 

Note:  Some yogurts, Kefir and especially sour cream give it a stronger taste. Some people do not like this, so please, taste your milk based mix before adding to be sure you don't mess with the flavor. 

Also I have made this recipe in which I did half coconut and half dairy and it came out great. Its a pretty flexible recipe and comes out great every time!

Hope I was hel

Tasty enough, but WAY too much cream and tomato sauce: it became a soup. I also think way too much butter. And it requires a large skillet, a large saucepan, and a baking sheet: not suitable for small kitchens. The NY Times Butter Chicken recipe is MUCH better. I did enjoy making the Tandoori Masala and will use that in other things.

I'm a butter chicken fan, and this recipe was the best I have found.  I've made the full fat version, and also reduced fat version.  My family prefers the full fat, but somewhere in the middle is also just as good.  I used 2 cups cream and 1 cup milk, and 1/2 cup butter.  This is now a recipe that is asked for all the  time.  BTW, if you haven't actually made the recipe, don't rate it - nobody cares what you "think" about  the ingredients,  I want to know about the taste, and the process, we can all read the ingredients for ourselves.

This formed a great foundation recipe. I read some of the reviews, and found the flavour a little flat, so made the following alterations: increased the garam masala two- or three-fold, increased the salt, added some sugar to round out the flavour, used 1.5 c cream and 1.5 cup 1% milk (next time I will try coconut milk).

I will make it again, but I will use a little less cayenne pepper next time, little spicier than my hubby likes. Very easy to make.

I have made this like 15 times and it is really great!  Sometimes I substitute some of the chicken with potatoes, and add probably more butter than needed.  My friends like to add extra garam masala because it seems to make it extra spicy but I like it kinda on the mild side.  I would suggest this to anyone trying out the dish for the first time because I love it very much!

Comes out perfectly every time. I'm Indian & have my own tweaks based on the flavor I like. I do two cups of coconut milk, one cup of heavy cream, tomato paste for a more robust tomato flavor, & add more garam masala & some coriander powder to taste. Delicious.

I made a few changes to this recipe. I used half and half butter and canola oil and cut it back to about 1/2 a cup. Instead of cream I use 0% Greek Yogurt but I add it at THE END. Before I do this I strain off any surface oil. By adding the yogurt at the end there is less risk of it it curdling with the tomatoes. However if  it does curdle a good tip to know is simply blend it in a blender until it's smooth. It works perfectly every time. I also 'play' with the spices I just made it with Sharwood's hot madras curry,  a generic Garam Marsala, some cumin, cayenne and a bit of Anjo Chili powder. I do cook the onions and garlic separately  and add them later. I think it tastes better this way. Instead of cutting the chicken breasts into chunks I coat them (whole)  with Garam Marsala and Anjo Chili powder, and put them in a 425  degree hot oven for 30 minutes (for 4 boneless breasts). This way they are really juicy when you cut them up into chunks and fold them into the sauce with the caramelized onions. All in all this is a solid basic recipe with authentic and delicious flavour. Thank you for posting it. It is my family's easy 'go to' butter chicken recipe, and we make it at least once a month.

I think it could do with a little less heavy cream — I used only 2 cups and it still felt way too creamy.

This is my fave dish to eat when I go out for Indian food and I was surprise how easy it was to put together.  I found the spice on Amazon.  

I will say that the amount of butter is shocking.  I will cut back next time I make this and use low-fat evaporate milk as in other reviews.  This one is a winner!

This recipe is amazing. It's so good that I've made it at least  20 times over the last 2 years. The only two recommendations I'd make is to put the tandoori masala in the sauce, and I normally use a 28oz can of crushed tomato instead of the tomato sauce (since I don't normally have tomato sauce on-hand).
Also to the people complaining about the calories and rating this recipe a one star - it's butter chicken... The cream and tomato is what gives this sauce most of it's taste. If the sauce is not made from cream then it wouldn't be butter chicken...

Could go lower on butter and oil, but otherwise love it! 
For those in the US (East Coast) who dont know where to get some of the ingredients, you can use Saffron Fix - an Indian meal-kit service - to get the ingredients per recipe.

I use coconut milk and yogurt to substitute the heavy cream, and cut up and use broccoli stalks and coconut shavings as a thickener. Instead of regular tomato sauce I use tomato and basil pasta sauce from classic. It's not as good as this recipe, it's better, and healthier too.

I made the recipe as suggested. The timing of everything worked out pretty well! I felt like it was sort of bland and just not as flavorful as another butter chicken recipe that I've made recently; however  my boyfriend gave his one 4 stars, I just like stronger spicier dishes.

This was delicious, but a bit fattening. I substituted cream for  plain greek yogurt and reduced the butter content.  It still came out creamy and delicious.

This is an amazingly yummy recipe! I only used 2 cups of cream instead of 3. In addition, I cut back on the cayenne pepper and added some curry. I did not have any tandoori masala so I tossed the chicken in garam masala. My husband absolutely loved it!!

Overall, this recipe is a little heavy but the flavor is fantastic. It is 5 stars with the changes another reviewer posted. Cut down the butter amount to 1/4 c and use a can of evaporated milk in place of the heavy cream. It turns out much lighter and still full of flavor. I also like to more cayenne because I do enjoy spicier food. I make this every few weeks and my family loves it!

This is a wonderful, creamy, spicy dish. It turned out perfect and was a huge hit with my guests. The only change I made was to slice the onions rather than dice, and it gave a nice texture to the dish. Delicious!

I love this recipe and make this dish every few months, more if possible. It turns out great even though I have to substitute curry powder for the tikka marsala spice, which I haven't hunted down as yet. I also add a package of Trader Joe's frozen mixed veggies to make it an easy a one  pot dinner. I usually use half and half for the cream and one stick of butter. Thanks so much for this recipe.

My daughter helped me prepare this. She doesn't like overly spicy and we made an error using tandoori  masala spice twice in place or garam masala. I expected a problem but it was delicious, This is a keeper!

This is a family fav.  I only use 1/4 c. butter, 1 c. cream, 2 c. 2% milk and only garam masala for seasoning (no tandoori masala).  Its quick and easy.

I accidentally saved my other review before finishing! Love this recipe but I actually also marinate the chicken in the spices beforehand in yogurt overnight. It ends up sooo moist and delicious.

I loved this recipe! The only thing I did differently was use chicken breast from a previously roasted whole chicken, and added the tandoori masala to the main sauce instead. Delicious!

Absolutely delicious. This is an excellent recipe which goes to the head of my East Indian recipe list.
Changed up the recipe a bit. To adjust ease of preparation, I browned the chicken until just slightly underdone in the same pan used for the onion. When I returned the chicken to the mixture and simmered for 5 or 6 minutes, it was perfectly done. To adjust taste to my craving at the time, I used 3 teaspoons of curry powder instead of Garam Masala and Garam Masala to replace the tandoori masala.

Will try the low fat version next time. Not that I would miss doing the original version when I wanted to wow my company.

I haven't made a recipe as many times as I have with this one! It comes out perfect every time. I play around with the spices sometimes; extra cayenne or garam masala, but I find it's perfect the way it is!

I followed the recipe almost exactly, because life is too short not to eat a cup of butter and a whole whack of cream once in a while ;)

I used chicken thighs instead of breasts.

Had it with garlic naan bread and it was a huge hit! Delicious!

Awesome recipe, and very easy for a cook that doesn't do much ethnic food like myself. Could not find 15 oz can of tomato sauce (only 12 or so oz), but it still made a fantastic sauce. I had to simmer the sauce for much longer and remove the lid to thicken it, so next time I will not bother covering it, but stir much more often. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly, and got a great result. Will definitely be making this again.

Very good. Did it a bit different and made it in 1 sauce pan. Caramelized the onion and garlic then added the seasoned chickened into the same pan, cooked until done. After the chicken was cooked, added the rest of the ingredients that make up the sauce to the pan and simmered until thickened (around 1 hour). Much simpler and great results.

This recipe is amazing.  Key is to caramelize the onions properly to give the sauce all that flavour.  I did make quite a few changes to take the fat content down.

I used half the butter
I used twice the chicken
1 substituted 3 cups of heavy cream for 1 cup of 18% cream and 1 cup 5% cream.  I also used my own frozen tomatos.   Added the sauce to the caramelized onions rather than the other way.  
Blended the sauce to avoid the lumpy onions to make smooth.

Served with Brown Basamati

I originally tried this recipe and my family love it..
After trying a few other butter chicken recipes and not loving them.. I find myself coming back to this for my basic recipe..
I rarely ever follow a recipe to a T and never seem to have cream on hand when I want to make it..so I  use carnation milk with water to make the amount needed..which makes a good substitute...and we like it..
This recipe uses a great blend of seasoning ! Which I never change..it is perfect how it is...

Absolutely delicious! I went with 1/4 cup butter and 2 cups of heavy cream instead of what the recipe originally calls for. I didn't cook the chicken in the oven but tossed it raw into the sauce and let it simmer for an hour. SO SO SO GOOD! Served with rice.

Wow. Simple and delicious. Cut a little of the butter out and you have a home run here. I make Tikka Masala often that tastes very much like this but is far more of a hassle to make. This is one of my favorites from All Recipes.

This dish has excellent flavor that isn't too spicy. After experimenting and have found a less fatty version that's just as delicious: sauté chicken and onions in a little olive oil omitting the butter and omit the cream but substitute skim milk just enough for the dish to turn the right color (under one cup).

I'm not much of a cook at all but I was surprised at how good this turned out! I still can't believe I could make something so delicious. Thank you so much for the simplified recipe. Does anyone know how I can get it to look more red/orange as indicated in the pic? Mine usually looks a lighter shade of orange. Too much cream I suppose?

I make this once a month for my family and it is my 9 year olds favorite thing to eat! I substitute half yellow curry powder and half garam masala for the tandoori as it is not readily available where I live. To lower the fat content I use 2 cans of evaporated milk and the rest is regular 2% milk and I use half the amount of butter it calls for as well. We eat this with Basmati rice and whole wheat tortillas for dipping.

Awesome!!!  I made the lighter version she added in the reviews.  Sub 1 cup butter for 1/4 cup and 3 cups cream for 1 can evaporated milk.  I didn't have tandoori masala so used curry powder instead as a few had suggested.  So super yum!!! Big hit with the whole family.

I've made this recipe numerous times and each time it came out perfect using the exact same ingredients and amounts.  As for the comments regarding it's fat content it's got only 12 grams of carbs.  Besides you don't eat this every day.  Make it a special dinner for yourself, family or friends.  It's worth it.

This was by far the BEST butter chicken recipe I have ever made. I used to use the Clubhouse butter chicken powder mix, as it was simple and easy to make, but after it was discontinued I needed a new recipe. I decided to try this one, and am so glad I did. The only thing I adjusted was the amount of cayenne pepper, as I don't like a lot of spice in my food. Other than that, it was creamy, flavourful, and oh so addicting!! I would highly recommend this recipe.

I've made this recipe a bunch of times as directed and it always turned out great. 

This time however I only had a crock-pot available so I marinated the chicken with the cayenne pepper, garam masala, vegetable oil, and tandoori masala overnight, then dumped everything into the crock-pot on high for 4 hours and it turned out amazing. If anything I think the chicken tasted better out of the crock-pot than it does when I bake it.

All and all this is a super recipe.

This was delicious and a great week-night meal. We only used 1/2 cup butter and 2 cups of cream and it tasted delicious. Could probably cut down on the butter and cream a little more next time. I used curry powder to coat the chicken. We made the quick naan to have on the side.

I have been making this recipe exactly as described about once a month for the past few years, my family loves it so much.  My brother found a local source for paneer, so we sometimes add that with the chicken (seasoning and cooking it like precooked chicken).  I have had butter chicken at Indian family run restaurants and in friend's homes, and I still don't know how authentic this particular recipe is, but it's absolutely addictively delicious regardless.

This recipe was delicious! I typically love strong flavor  BUT it was so heavy and hearty that I couldn't even eat the leftovers because I thought I was going to have a heart attack. So the only thing I would change is the amount of butter or substituting it with a healthier option. But overall its an excellent recipe!

I loved this recipe, best butter chicken I have ever had, however I did modify it a bit due to missing some ingredients and to lower the calories. Instead of the 3 cups of heavy cream I added 1 cup heavy cream and 2 cups of thick yogurt. Instead of the tomato sauce I used tomato paste and 1 cup of water.  Also I used 1/4 cup of butter and 2 teaspoons of garam masala.  If you want this to be a bit hotter up the cayenne but do so slowly as when this spice simmers it gets hotter, for those of you that don't know.

This is such a great recipe - tastes authentic!!! I found I have to add the tomato sauce 2 tablespoons at a time and keep tasting to ur desired taste. 
I couldn't find any tandoori masala, but I found Kashmiri masala and that seems great!!! I brown the chicken first then take it out of the pan & put to the side, then I brown the onions. Once I'm making the sauce & am ready for it to simmer, I add back the chicken & let it simmer in the sauce. Makes for tender chicken & an authentic butter chicken taste!!! Thanks to the author for the great recipe!!!!

I have a severe food allergy and have avoided most Asian/Middle Eastern restaurants for years. But I adore Indian food and have really missed it. To get this as authentic as possible, I purchased the spices and made this exactly as written but with the 1/4 c. butter and evaporated milk to make it lighter. Served it over basmati rice and with some perfectly ripe cantaloupe. It was perfect.  I am so, so happy. THANKS!

I love this recipe and make it all the time! It is a little mild. I add tandoor masala into the sauce as well which gives it more flavor.

Excellent. Thankfully I made extra because one serving was not enough!

I do worry about the calorie count and was thinking I could try it with coconut milk instead of cream. What can I use in place of the butter? Any suggestions?

Easy and delish! My whole family loved it. I caramalized the onions and garlic then just added everything else to the same pan, brought to a simmer and tossed in the chicken. Skipped a couple steps and didn't use my oven which was quicker and simpler and  I didn't use any oil.

Sooooo great!! I actually used two cups of whipping cream and one cup of half milk half cream with a little cornstarch to thicken. Only needs one teaspoon of salt, not two if you're using salted butter. Delicious!

It's a really good recipe.  I mix my own garam masala and tandoori masala.  I avoid the hot spices so the kids will eat.  I bbq'd the chicken instead of putting it in the oven.  It just gives it such an awesome taste and avoids the mess in the kitchen as an added bonus.  I only brown the chicken and don't cook it fully.  I let it finish cooking in the sauce instead. It takes longer but the added flavour to the chicken is worth it.

I had to make a few changes because I didn't have all the ingredients.  I combined a couple of other recipes with this one, and used some of the suggestions made in the comments.  It turned out great! and now I have my own unique 'butter chicken' recipe!

I cheated and it was still great. One pot, low calorie version, and I used left over rotisserie chicken marinated in a little olive oil and tandoori masala. Just kept the temperature low while I was stirring in the evaporated milk, and I had no curdling issues.  Big fans of cilantro in my house, so I threw some in the sauce and some as a garnish. I did thicken the sauce a bit with a flour/water mixture, and added the chicken in the last five minutes..  Served with store bought garlic naan bread and jasmine rice, since that's what I had in the house. This was really, really good. Adjust the spices to your taste.

This is my favorite butter chicken, even more than butter chicken at an Indian restaurant! I make a few changes, like using 3 cans coconut milk, reduce butter to 3/4 cup, curry powder instead of tandoori masala(I don't like tandoori), a can of diced tomatoes and tomato sauce, and I make it all in one pot and let the chicken cook in the sauce. I serve it with brown basmati rice. I also divide and freeze the sauce before I add the chicken as this is more than enough for our family out of one recipe. It makes a really fast supper when you can thaw the sauce and just add the chicken.

MANGO CHICKEN! I love this recipe I have made a few tweeks along the way the main one being before you add the chicken split the sauce into two pots/pans one pan with slightly more than the other and add mango puree to the lesser full pan then add the chicken and simmer both then you have mango and butter chicken it's basically to die for.

Terrific Recipe.  I couldn't find Tandoori Masala Spice so I made my own.  Didn't add the mace or the menthi in the spice (didn't have) but it turned out great anyway.  Only thing I did different was used a cup of whipping cream and two cups of canned coconut milk.  Delicious!   Will definitely make again.

I'm not a super experienced cook and this was pretty easy for me. The biggest pain I encountered was making the tandoori masala and garam masala spice mixes because my local store didn't have them (just google what spices go in and get those!). I also used cauliflower instead of chicken. Put it on a  cookie sheet and tossed in olive oil and tandoori masala and oven roasted them. This sauce recipe is to die for, my husband says it's one of the most delicious things I've ever cooked! I've already recommended it to a few friends and highly recommend to anyone considering making it! I used 1/4 butter but still used the heavy cream. Served the cauliflower over rice with the sauce and some naan bread.

I made this recipe for my family of four. I followed the recipe exactly, except I reduced the cayenne pepper to 1/2 teaspoon because I thought that might make it a little less spicy for my kids. It turned out fabulous and it was delicious. I served it with Basmati rice and with Garlic Naan from the bakery of the grocery store. The servings were plentiful.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Quick and easy and the flavor is great.  The only thing that I would change is maybe add a little more cayenne pepper but that is just a personal preference.

This recipe is delicious !  I added 2 tsp cumin seeds when caramellizing the onion.  Used red Indian hot chili powder instead of cayenne...
I have made this recipe numerous times for my family and friends ... I double up the recipe  as it tastes even better day 2 or 3!

Delicious and easy to make!  The hardest part was finding the garam masala and tandoori masali, which I had to order online.  I used the artery-clogging original recipe and my husband gave it a big thumbs up.  It wasn't that spicy at all (we like spicy food) but it had an excellent flavor.  I served it with rice mixed with peas. I think the peas were to make me feel healthy!  I followed suggestions in the reviews and cooked everything in a Dutch oven, to save on dishes.

Pretty tasty and simple enough to make, but it was too much heavy cream for me and I could probably cut back on the butter some as well. The only complaint is that it dirtied a lot of pans/pots so perhaps I'll caramelize onions in the pot before simmering the sauce and maybe I'll cook the chicken in the sauce as well instead of in the oven.

DELICIOUS! I tried this recipe and it turned out great on the very first attempt. I also make some slight calorie-conserving changes. I only used 1/4 cup of butter in my recipe, and I also only put 1 cup of cream and substituted skim milk for the other 2 cups. I also used garlic salt to taste, rather than use table salt.
This is a delicious and easy recipe that I plan on sharing with many others!

A very nice recipe!  Among other people on here, I ended up substituting the heavy cream with evaporated milk.  Also subbed out the tandoori masala for 1 tbl spoon of curry powder.

This dish is very flavorful and goes well with basmati rice.  I'd you want a little more spice then put a bit more cayenne pepper in it.  I really enjoyed this recipe.  Totally recommend it!

Thank you for sharing this recipe. It was very easy to do and was really delicious. I made the leaner version using 1/4 cup of butter and a can of evaporated skim milk. I also used a home-made biryani spice mix in lieu of garam masala (which seems to vary depending on brands, so really I would just use your favourite curry spice mix). I made it as the directions dictated, but next time I will cook the chicken in the sauce like other cooks to compare the flavour.

This was delicious!  Had my whole house smelling like an Indian restaurant :)  I did make a few modifications in the interest of trimming some of the fat/calories.  Instead of 3 cups heavy cream, I used 1 cup heavy cream and 2 cups fat free half & half.  Also, I only used 1/2 cup butter for the entire recipe instead of 1 cup.  The sauce may have been a bit thinner because of these changes, but the rice seemed to absorb it during the eating.  Also, it had a creamy texture and taste, but wasn't too heavy.  I couldn't find tandoori masala like everyone else, so I found a recipe for the spice mix on Food.com - my cupboard had all of the spices except mace, fenugreek, and cardamom (and I left out the red food coloring).  The spice mix was still delicious on the chicken!

Used this recipe for my first attempt at making an Indian dish, and it came out so yummy!! I will make it again. Maybe with a little less butter next time!

Could not find tandoori masala so used curry powder instead. Use the healthy one pan method from other reviews. Turned out great

This dish came out AWESOME!!! My husband and I eat indian food at least once a week, and I've been searching for an easy recipe to make our favorite dish at home. I used all ingredients listed, except the tandoori masala. I substituted curry like other reviewers suggested and the dish was great!! I served with plain white rice and garlic and cheese naan. My husband and neighbors even like it better than the Indian restaurant's butter chicken! I have sent this recipe to friends and will definitely be making again! Thanks!!

Fantastic recipe written just as it is, no need to change a thing! I didn't have heavy cream on hand today so subbed for homogenized milk, it turned out tasting great, but definitely had to simmer for the full 30 minutes to smooth out the texture (it looked curdled when first added!) I also added a little corn starch at the end to help thicken it, when using cream there is no need for this :)

My family and I love this recipe! I make it all in one pan to cut down on dishes. I caramelize the onions/garlic, add in the chicken, then add in the sauce. I also make this with 1 cup heavy cream and 2 cups whole or 2% milk and it is just as good. YUM!

This recipe is great!!  I followed the recipe to the letter and it works.  The flavour was wonderful, nice and mellow which is what the family likes but I like spicy so added some crushed chilis/chili powder to my bowl.  Very good recipe.  Thanks.

This is absolutely fantastic. I've made this a few times now. I've reduced the amount of cream to 2 cups as I found that there was too much liquid for the amount of chicken. It is just my husband and I so we always have leftovers which are just as fantastic. This is our go to recipe for butter chicken now. Delicious!

I made the light version and only used 1 pan as well. The flavor itself was off, like a cream soup(with chicken lol). Perhaps it needed more tomato sauce? It was edible but even the light version doesn't justify the calories at this rate. Unfortunately i'm not any sort of cook and have no idea how this could be improved.

I have made this recipe multiple times now & it is one of the best things I've ever tasted! I followed everything to a T and it came out wonderful. Yes, this recipe is very rich & high in calories. However, it's a nice treat to enjoy every now and then. I highly recommend this recipe!

I have used coconut milk instead of heavy cream. This has changed the texture entirely. It was not rich and creamy at all. The taste was a bit mild due to the coconut milk.

Fantastic recipe!!! I make one modification to the sauce, I add a tablespoon of white sugar at the end and to taste. Slightly less pure to the dish I suppose, but it tastes amazing with or without. Serve with Naan II on this Site, it is divine.

I have been making this recipe for more than 3 years now! I absolutely love it. the only change i would make is leave out the salt. This only takes 30 mins from start to finish to make, so easy and so delicious!

I made both the original and the low fat recipe. Obviously the original is way better. Because butter and cream always make everything delicious. But the low fat version was pretty good as well, however the sauce did separate so I threw the whole batch into the blender and that kind of solved that problem. However, I will not make the low fat version again. The third time I made it, I cut back on the salt and added one tbsp of sugar, which in my opinion made it perfect. Definitely a keeper.

Omg.  So easy. So good.I did use less butter but it was still good. I  also used only one pan. After you you cooked the onions I slid them to one side of the pan, then continued on with the rest of the ingredients. Thank you for the Recipe.

Delicious! I understand it's not for those watching their health, but it is my absolute favorite Indian dish. It's called BUTTER chicken. The indulgent sauce is what makes it amazing! This recipe turned out better than some Indian restaurants around Hampton Roads, VA. Still looking for a good one... The sauce seemed a bit thin though. I saw another recipe that stated authentic chicken makhani is thickened with pureed cashews. I'm going to try that one next. Also, I had to make my own garam and tandoori masala mix. The nearest ethnic food store is through the tunnel about 25 minutes away and I wasn't about to make my appetite wait any longer.

First off, I couldnt get over how fatty this recipe was!!!  This truely is a BUTTER chicken recipe!  So I decided to dramatically cut down the butter to 1/3 cup and substituted the whipping cream for almond milk.  True, if was a thinner consistency than the original recipe would have been, but still tasted great and was WAY healthier.  Aside from the fat content....delicious recipe!

Excellent recipe!!!  VERY rich but using less sauce covers that issue.  My only small suggestion is maybe a little more spice??  An easy fix :)

I made this last night and found it very, as it says in the title, EASY! I made a few changes, as I see a lot of people have. I made the sauce all in one pan - First caramelizing the onions and garlic in butter. I then made a sauce out of tomato paste (half a can), heavy cream, coconut milk I had left over from making coconut rice to go with this dish, water and some whole milk, all the seasoning listed above -- Then I added more butter to the pan with the onions and garlic but not as much as this recipe requires - In total I used 1/2 cup of butter. Then I added my sauce mixture to the pan and let simmer as instructed above. While that was simmering - I took out my chicken which I had previously already cleaned and seasoned with lime, garlic powder, pinch of salt and the tandoori masala which was marinating all day. I then pan fried that until golden brown on each side of the cubes --- Then added some SPINACH to the sauce that was simmering. I took a baking dish out and put the chicken on the bottom of it - And then poured the sauce all over and baked at 375 for half an hour. With the coconut brown rice, it was really really good. I have eaten my fair share of butter chicken, some of the best in Vancouver, B.C. and this came out pretty similar BUT I found it wasn't as sweet as other butter chicken I have had.. I think next time, to experiment, I may add a teaspoon of sugar.. sweetness and the spicy works well and again I notice all butter chicken I have had was sweeter.

My family loved this.  I did cut the butter in half and used one can evaporated milk and a cup of cream, only because that's what I had.  it was very good.  May add a little more cayenne to make it a little spicier.  But it was great.

I made this for the first time last night - it was super easy and delicious. I did reduce the butter to 1/2 a cup and used a can of evaporated milk, as the original poster suggested. My kids aren't big fans of spicy food, so the only other change I made was to reduce the amount of cayenne pepper - I used about 1/4 tsp, which gave it a teensy bit of heat but not enough to put them off. Aside from that, I followed the instructions to the letter and I used the spices specified, no substitutes :) The whole family LOVED it - my 4 year old actually asked if she could have the leftovers for lunch AND dinner today. I'll be making this again, for sure :)

This was so amazing, restaurant-quality, and easy to make although it takes time. I cut the recipe in half for two people and played with the proportions - 1/4 cup butter, 8oz tomato sauce, 1 cup heavy cream. I only used half the cayenne, and curry powder to substitute for the tandoori masala on the chicken. I also added some frozen peas halfway through the sauce cooking time, those were a nice touch of color and texture. Served over basmati rice with asparagus on the side, and wow! I just wish I had naan to go with it :)

I made it as listed, and am so happy with it!! Just like the butter chicken at my favorite restaurant (that I moved away from) and will make it again...perhaps I'll try the lower fat suggestions though.

This was good spice wise, but I did a few things differently to reduce cals and save time. I didn't use any butter, but rather sauteed the onions, garlic garam marsala and tandoori masala together to obtain more flavor. I used 1 can of lite coconut milk and 1 cup of cream to reduce fat. I didn't have any tomato sauce, so I used about 1.5 cans of tomato paste. I also added 3 potatoes chopped up. I removed the baking step and added the chicken to the coconut milk, cream and spices once they had started to simmer. I let it simmer for about 30 minutes before enjoying with rice. It was really good.

This recipe is a quick and easy way to make a wonderful, authentic butter chicken that my kids (even the picky ones) will love. For those of you who are little more health conscience the recipe can substitute the cream for non fat yogurt and it still tastes great ;-)

I tried this recipe last night, and followed the directions with the exception of using a half stick of butter and fat free evaporated milk. The family devoured it with no leftovers. This is very simple to prepare.

This is a wonderful recipe! I added a little more garam masala, cayenne, and ginger when doubling the recipe. Next time I'm going to try the one-pot method another reviewer suggested. Everyone loved it, even the two-year-old!

I pureed the onions for a smoother sauce. I have made it several times and it has been a big hit - especially with my Indian friends! Big downside though - the curry smell lingers big time, even with the windows open, but worth it.

I have now made this dish 2 times. For work and home both loved the dish. I happen to work/live in one of the largest Indian communities in the United States. The people I prepared this dish for some are Sikh and they loved it.  However, they dont use the butter and whipping cream.  Too fattening, they use plain yogurt. Having said this, the dish as is wonderful!!! For a simple dish you spend little time in kitchen, great dish, and plenty of time to enjoy!!!

My family of 6 loved this, but I did make a few changes knowing my kids palates.  First I cut the butter to 3/4 C. added only 1 C. cream and 1 1/4 c. half and half.  Also, cut the tandoori masala down to 2 tsp. and then used 1 tsp. of curry powder.  There was plenty of sauce for everyone to drown their rice and veggies in.  And even enough for leftovers.

This was delicious on both chicken breast cubes and on soy "chicken" pieces. I used only one pan for the sauce, cooking the onions and garlic and then removing them and making the sauce. I used the lower fat method described by the original submitter in her or his post, with the exception of adding about 3/4 cup of heavy cream in addition to the evaporated milk. I used about 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne, and that was just right for us. Served with basmati rice, mini naan, and steamed green beans. Thanks!

This is a fantastic authentic tasting Butter Chicken and I am so happy to have found it.  Every time I make it people rant and rave about it and want the recipe.  The only adjustment I make is that I increase the Cayenne to give it an extra kick.  As for the calories it isn't like you eat it every day it's a treat.  If you are worried about calories reduce the butter amount and use half and half cream.  I personally go for the full fat version.  Five Stars thank you so much for sharing and my husband especially thanks you.

This is one of my favorite recipes. It is SO simple and turns out much tastier than you would imagine with such a simple list of ingredients. The only modifications I make are the ones suggested in the reviews by the author just to make it a little healthier-- I agree that it turns out just as good with the evaporated milk and reduced amount of butter. Serving it over basmati rice topped with some fresh cilantro is a must!

Great dish - just like the restaurant! I did change the heavy cream to half and half and could NOT find the tandoori masala so just used the garam masala. I roasted chicken thighs seasoned with red pepper, garlic salt and some smoked paprika. We loved it!

Great dish! I'm new to cooking, but this wasn't hard to get the hang of. Added some peas about 10 minutes before finishing and it all worked out great. Didn't realize it was so much food haha but it's great! thanks!

Wonderful! Everybody in my family loved it! I cut back on butter and put in 2% milk with only half a cup of whipped cream to make it more healthy, and I added lots of different spices. I highly suggest Madras curry powder- it gives the sauce a delightful spicyness of a more tasty quality than garam masala by itself. I'll definitely make this again!

I've been cooking this recipe for a while now, normally just for myself. I found a shortcut in cooking the chicken, so instead of baking it in the oven, grill the tandoori chicken and onion in a sauce pan (it's coated in oil anyway) until the pieces look almost done, then add the tomato sauce, heavy cream, and spices. Let simmer for about 5 mins, then add the butter. To get an idea of how much sauce I'm producing jus for myself, I usually just add 2 large spoonful of tomato sauce and about 1/4 cup of heavy cream. That should be enough for the chicken and whatever side you use (either rice or naan). It's quick and easy and done within 30 mins. Love it!

This was really good. I did have to follow what others said instead of the original recipe because it's wayyyy too fattening. I didn't have condensed milk so I used regular 2% milk with about 2 or 3 tbsp of dry milk. Another time I made it using half and half cream and...that didn't turn out too great, it was good, but not great. 1 thing to remember is you have to use a good tandoori masala, I used a cheap one once and it was all pink! lol,

This a really delicious butter chicken recipe! I did change a few things. I marinate the chicken in a tandoori masala and yogurt mix for about an hour beforehand, and I don't add as much cream or salt. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe to the letter, and I thought it had too much cream and was a little too salty. Now I only put 2 cups of cream and half the amount of salt. So yummy!

It definitely isn't perfect butter chicken but it's probably the best I'll ever make. Good Indian food recipes are so hard to get your hands on. I am Indian so this rating includes an authenticity factor. It's very rich and the chicken came out delicious. The other popular butter chicken recipe on the site came out horrible when I made it and I think it was the difference between using heavy cream and sour cream. I use chili powder instead of tandoori masla. Recipe edit: I eliminated the butter and used 2 tbs oil to caramelize the onion and garlic, I halved the salt, lastly I drain out the chicken after I bake it. I want to try cooking the chicken in the sauce itself. Edit: I cook it all in one pot now. You really don't need anymore than that. I cook the chicken with the chili powder and onions first and then add everything else. It came out exactly the same. -_-

This was good, but the onion and garlic were very strong. Also tasted a little like tomato soup. I would add more garam masala, and some of the tandoori masala to the sauce. Maybe its the tomato sauce I used.

I made this exactly as written (minus the onions, personal dislike) as a birthday meal for my husband.  It was a huge success!  Served it with basmati rice, creamed spinach and naan.  Yummy!  The only critique I would give is that I had way more sauce than necessary for the amount of chicken.  I could have easily added half or more again of chicken.  But I will definitely be making this again!

Very easy recipe to cook. I too did the one pan version but increased the recipe to serve 12 as I was having company. It was now asking for 4 tsp of salt; I used 3 but it was still WAY too salty so I ended up having to add some sugar, more cream and tomato paste to stretch the sauce and dilute the salt. In the end it was very tasty. I served it over jasmine rice with cauliflower and broccoli on the side.

This turned out really well, especially for being a "simplified" recipe! I think I will replace my more complicated recipe with this one. I did add a little ginger paste with the garlic, and instead of baking the chicken separately, I seasoned it with the Tandoori seasoning, then sauteed it with the spices before adding the tomatoes and cream. Then I simmered it all for about 20 minutes, and added some chopped cilantro at the end. If I'd had red onions on hand, I would have used those rather than a standard yellow one.

Based on other reviews I opted for the lower cal version and very yummy it is too. For our taste 1 teaspoon of cayenne is too spicy. Will add just a pinch next time but thats just personal taste. Very yummy recipe.

WOWeeeWOW! I did the full fat version first, THEN tried the lighter version (but with coconut milk because I was out of evaporated milk). OH MY! Not as thick but no worries! I topped it with Greek yogurt and it was the best -- my fiancé, who doesn't eat yogurt normally, was singing its praises. This recipe takes us to food paradise. I highly recommend this with Jasmine Rice. Makes all the difference.

Great recipe and easy. i made in one pan and like some others, used evaporated milk instead of the heavy cream. Also used 1/4 cup of butter. After I had made it a few times I experimented with lamb instead of the chicken - absolutely delicious!!

Awesome recipe, no complaints with it at all.  Just be careful that while you're simmering the sauce it doesn't boil over, I had it on a low heat and it still ended up boiling out of the pot I was cooking in.

Overall an excellent recipe! I substituted with 1/2 cup butter and 1 can evap milk for the heavy cream, and it worked fine. I added 2x garam masala (before simmering for 30 mins) because I did a taste test and thought it needed more flavour...however I don't know if it was necessary since the flavours could've been stronger after simmering. I also marinated the chicken with tandoori masala, salt and pepper for a couple hrs prior to baking. Finally, I took a star off because although it's a good recipe, it's still not as great as some of the butter chicken I've had at restaurants. In general, it's a solid recipe!

This turned out great! I accidentally read the tomato sauce as tomato paste and used the tomato paste instead. i had a little bit of pasta sauce and added a little bit to it. Turned out delicious. It is "butter" chicken, so no surprise there with the butter and cream. Great for a once-in-a-while meal treat. Thanks!

I'm a novice cook, but was able to make this recipe with no problem. It was absolutely delicious! Will use other reviews next time and cut down on the amount of cream that goes into it. It was even better the next day! I bought the garam masala at a local Indian store as I couldn't find it at my supermarket. Also, if you're going to give this to kids, cut down of course on the cayenne. Great recipe!

Very good!  The whole family liked it.  I used half & half and heavy cream and it worked fine.  Also cut back on butter a little.  Might want to increase the amount of chicken.

Well I made this exactly as directed and thought it was great tasting but too thin. Any suggestions to thicken the sauce would be appreciated. I think maybe next time Iwon't cook it as long.

This was a great base for a butter chicken recipe.  I substituted diced tomatoes and tomato paste for the tomato sauce, I cooked my chicken in butter and garlic and then poured the whole mess into the tomato sauce, used 2% milk to colour I liked, thickened it slightly with flour and let it go in 350 degree oven for 40 minutes.. I also didn't have garam so used curry, garlic, cinnamon, cumin to taste..always taste..It sounds like I changed a lot but the base is great to make it your own..Thanks

I made this in one pot - very tasty.  I didn't have tandoori masala, so I coated the chicken in curry w/o oil.  This recipe is delicious.

I've made this at least 5-10 times now. Love it every single time. It's super easy and delicious! Just pick up some garlic nan and steam some rice, and you're ready to go!

This recipe made a lot. Next time I will either half it or  plan to use the extra in another recipe.  I need to prep more chicken for next time. Since there was so much sauce left over I ran out of chicken.

The spices were good and it has just a bit of a kick that you may not find in other recipes for Butter Chicken.  I look forward to trying it again.

Sinfully delicious.  This is by no means a diet meal.  Heavens, no!  In fact, it's so darned good, I found portion control next to impossible.  I, too, substituted curry for the tandoori masala simply because I didn't have (and couldn't find at my local store) the tandoori masala.  It turned out fantastic!  I'll be making this again... soon.  This is a keeper!  I love recipes that are easy AND delicious.  This is just that.

Yum! If i didnt have to buy the ingredients all the time i would have it every night for dinner. I added 2pinch's of Cumin Seeds (Jeera) and also 2 pinch's of dried fenegreek leaves. This  recipe is amazing. (I only do half everything for the sauce as when i do it all i find i dont use it all, therefore my pinches of the 2 spices above a as per a half batch of sauce). Thank youuuu!!!!!!

I have made this recipe 3 times now... the first 2 times I made it with the condensed milk change but with 4% and it was DELICIOUS!!!! My husband and I go out for Indian food every few months and I felt like I was at an authentic Indian restaurant eating this dish. SO YUMMY! The third time I made this dish I made it with skim condensed milk and for some reason it ended up curdling on me.  I dont know if it was the change of milk, or being too confident and having the heat on high (I also used a different stove) but I just added 1/2 cup of regular 1% milk to thin it out and it still tasted very yummy. One of my favorite recipes I have found on Allrecipes.com.  Thank you thank you for sharing!

very good. I didn't have tandoori masala, but thanks to another reviewer I mixed 1/2t garlic powder, 1/8t ginger, lime zest,a dash of curry, 1/2t chili powder & 1/8t garam masala together as a tandoori  masala substitution. Per other reviewers I cooked chicken on stove top ahead of time, added some asparagus broccoli, lighten it by using evaporated milk and 1/4 c butter.  Accidently bought tomato paste instead of sauce. Definitely thickened up quicker. Will try sauce next time as a comparison.  Wasn't spicy enough for my taste, but for my family of 5 it was perfect. Will make again.

I really don't see how this is getting 5 stars. I had to cut the cream in half and I'm glad I stopped pouring when I did and stirred and tasted it. I should have cut it a little more. It's kind of bland overall. Had to add more spice. I probably wouldn't make this version again. Disappointed, because this was the easiest recipe I found. :/ Edit to add that the sauce is also pretty thin.

Instead of the garam masala and the cayenne pepper for the sauce, I just used a Indian Marsala mix that I bought in the supermarket and the result was great! For the chicken, I used just salt and a little bit of red pepper (no tandori masala). The changes were due to availability of what I had, but the results were great anyway! Definitely, going to make it again, and again...

Love this dish!  Have made several times.  Prefer to use boneless skinless chicken thighs and broil them instead of baking, it gives that more traditional tandoori look and taste.  My family really likes the flavor from the Tandoori Masala so after getting the chicken in the sauce, I taste and add a bit more to the sauce.  This makes a lot of sauce, have even had leftover sauce before.  Stuck it in the freezer and just made more chicken to add to the sauce on another night.

This recipe is delicious.  We are Somersizing, and this dish is perfect!  I don't reduce the fat or calories at all. 

However, I think this makes WAY too much sauce.  The second time I made it, I used about 4-5 pounds of chicken and there's still more than enough sauce.  

I couldn't find tandoori masala, so I sprinkled the chicken with a little bit of the garam masala, onion powder, and powdered ginger. Fabulous and so fragrant.

Delicious. Almost restaurant like. I did not make any changes of my own. I made the lower fat version and I also minimized the number of pots and pans. Made a double batch and everyone loved it. I will give it a five stars because there is really nothing bad to say about it.

I made this tonight & it was good!  You do have to reduce the butter to 1/4 cup.  Also, I used half & half instead of heavy cream.  My son and I both liked it!

This is an amazing recipe! Everyone loved it! I did make it a bit different. I started off with a little but of butter in the pan. Next, i sautéed the onions. After the onions were transparent i added minced ginger/garlic. Then, I added the chicken pieced and cooked them until they were no longer pink. After that I added the tomato sauce, heavy cream etc. It turned out DELICIOUS!

This was fantastic. I definitely cut the butter down to 1/2 cup and exchanged the heavy cream for a can of fat-free evaporated milk. I found it a little salty, I think I would cut the amount of salt in half. Would definitely make this again!

Delicious, very flavorful.

I used deboned chicken (dark & white meat) and served over rice.

Truly AMAZING!  The entire family loved it.  I used the lighter version (1/4 C butter & 2% evaporated milk) and had Garam Masala but not Tandoori, so for the tandoori coating I used 2 Tbl of the Garam but added a pinch of the following:  garlic powder, cayene pepper, nutmeg, salt and tumeric.  I also had a bell pepper on hand so added that to the dish as well (from another rater's recommendation).  We love all things hot (spicy) in my family so didn't notice it being too much on the hot scale, but just right!  Thanks so much for sharing this dish!

I loved the ingredients...  but did not follow the recipe exactly (inexperience on my part).

I did not dice the chicken, used parts with bone inside, so cooking was approx 30 min.

Also put oil in sauce by error, and 2 tbsp (not tsp) of garam  (another slip).  No tandoori (did not plan).  So I put a touch of sauce on the chicken during the bake.

Sauce is amazing!  Next time, I will try to follow the recipe.  Call me Mr. Improv!

This recipe was amazing! Tasted better than anything we've tried in any Indian restaurant. The only change I made was using whipping cream instead of heavy cream and it was fantastic!

I used the low fat version and added an 8oz. container of mushrooms along with the onions. My whole family loved it and I will be making it again. 
Also, a lot of stores sell spices in bulk, so you can get a small amount of garam masala, just enough for the recipe, and not have to buy a whole jar you may not use.

My family loved this recipe.  It had heat but wasn't too hot.  We couldn't stop eating it.  We even ran out of cream and just used 2 cups cream and 1 cup milk and it was still delicious!

I see that many people changed the recipe a bit, as did I.
I used 1 pint of half and half and a half pint of light cream instead of the 3 c. of heavy cream.  I also misread the recipe and used just 1/2 cup (1 stick) of butter.  This all was just fine. I couldn't find my cayenne pepper so I tossed in a few dashes of tobasco.
I don't know the different between gram masala and tandoori masala so I used the only one I had.
Last thing....I couldn't deal with trying to get it all into one pan to cook through so I tossed the sauce over the chicken chunks and put it all back in the oven.  Very easy (I should add I used about 3 pounds of chicken, not just 1.5).  All of this was served over basmati rice...YUMMMMMM.

I just made this last night and it was tasty! I tried to improvise since I didn't have any heavy cream, so I tried to make heavy cream my self: big mistake. The sauce didn't thicken as expected, but I added some corn starch, which solved the problem. I also didn't have any tandori masala, so I seasoned the chicken with garam masala, which tasted excellent. It was a bit too buttery for me, but that could be because I decided to make my own cream. Next time, I will definitely buy the cream.
The chicken took a lot longer to cook than 12 minutes: I put it on broil for 5 minutes after 15 minutes of baking, which made it a bit drier, but the chicken has a lot of juices on the pan and in the meat. 
I will definitely be making this again: pretty easy to make and delicious.

The first time we made this it took us a really long time but we made it again tonight and it only took about 30 minutes total.  So good.   So easy. First time we added chili flakes but thought it probably didn't need that so we left it out the second time. It's one of those dishes that smell so good cooking.

Definitely good! The sauce is thick so rather than using heavy cream I'm going to use coconut milk next time! My sister never tried Indian food and was very skeptical about trying it, but as soon as she got a little bit to taste she definitely fell in love with it!

This was my first time making butter chicken and used this recipe because it was easy to follow and had a short list of ingredients. It turned out AWESOME! It saved a lot of time compared to other recipes I saw, and tasted great. I will defnitely be using this recipe again.

Wish I can give this more than 4 stars - I am not a cook but this was the best chicken curry I have ever made!! I only used 2 cups of cream and substituted curry powder for Tandoori masala (couldn't find any) but it turned out great! and the Kids loved it too!

This is delicious. I didn't have 3 whole cups of heavy cream, but a little less didn't hurt in the least. Goes great over white or brown basmati rice.

Easy and delicious! I made up my own tandoori masala (a very loosely followed version but with these flavors you can't really loose. I also  used half and half instead of heavy cream  (and less butter as well) and it came out wonderfully!

I think the only thing I will do differently next time is cutting back on the tomato flavor. 

My Indian boyfriend loved it!

I made the low fat version with evaporated milk and 1/4 cup butter and it was amazing. I also added an extra tablespoonful of the Tandoori. It was loved by all and will be a favorite in our house.

Great recipe!  My whole family loved it.  I combined the lower fat recipe with the one pot version.  I couldn't find tikka masala, so I added a little extra garam masala.  Watch the sauce closely though, I left to watch a few minutes of football and let it boil.  The result was not a creamy, but it still tasted fine.  Its a good excuse to make it again soon so I can perfect it!

I have eaten Indian food once in my life before this recipe.  Since DH likes Indian and I'm loving trying all these recipes on this site, I gave it a go!  I was mad at the sauce (which didn't look right) before we sat down to eat but it ended up smooth and DEEEElicious.  I did not have either of the Indian spices so used some cumin based on another reviewer, and then a dash of few different spices for the other- mostly cumin as well.  I loved, loved, loved this recipe.  I will make the lower fat version next time although did not use all the butter and cream the original recipe called for and it was still super, super, super!

I wasn't a fan of the curry, it was too thin (even after I let it simmer longer, hoping it would thicken up) The taste of butter was overwhelming. I liked how the chicken was marinated and baked, it tasted great without the curry.

This chicken was fabulous!!  so easy to prepare, and very authentic tasting.  I didn't have any tandoori seasoning, so I substitued 1 Tbs. curry powder.  I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 only because I thought the amount of cayenne called for was a bit overpowering.  (but my husband who loves HOT food, loved it!)

Made this for my family, I could not find the tandoori masala so I used red curry.  I did add a little flour to the sauce after adding the chicken to help thicken and served over brown rice.  The dish was great my 13 year old got seconds and my 2 year old finished his plate!!

I have made at least 100 recipes from this site and I've never reviewed one until now.  This was out of this world. We had the dish for company but I was working that day, so that morning, I baked the chicken off and browned the onions.  When I got home, I threw everything together in 15 minutes.  I omitted the salt and it was fine.  It was a little spicy for my kids (I endeded up giving them some of the baked chicken without the sauce and rice), but perfect for the adults.  My husband took it for lunch the next day and said it was even better!  Can't wait to try the lower cal version.

Really good recipe. I also reduced the heavy cream still delicious. For the thicker consistency you could add a little corn starch.

Have made this countless times and is a recipe that everyone loves. I now only used tomato sauce in a jar (not pasta sauce) as this has a much nicer flavour. For about 2 lb of chicken I used 3 jars (20+ oz each) and a full litre of 10% cream. I also use quite a bit more cayenne but especially a lot more garam masala.  We love a lot of sauce to dip naan bread into.  :)

This was the best Indian Butter Chicken I have ever eaten. My boyfriend is from Bangladesh and said it was perfect. The only down fall is , it is so fatten, but so good I ate it for 3 days straight.

My daughter tells me this is my biggest cooking accomplishment to date.  This was so easy to make.  I couldn't make the recipe exactly as written because I didn't have tandoori masala, so I upped the garam masala.  I also used the one pot method suggested by another reviewer and, because of delicate tummies, left out the cayenne.  This will definitely go into our rotation.  The only change will be a reduction in the amount of cream, I think.  Outstanding recipe!

I've made this recipe several times as it is written in the ingredient section and it is delicious. However, today I tried to make it with fat free evaporated milk and less butter as suggested by the person who submitted this recipe. It was still amazing. I used two cans of fat free evaporated milk and a 1/4 cup butter and it tasted the same. The only difference was the texture of the sauce, which had sort of a curdled milk texture (does not sound appetizing the way I am putting it), but if you want a lower fat option this is the way to go!

FANTASTIC recipe!! I'm fussy with my indian food, but this was incredible and a breeze to make. I made a couple of changes. I mixed the chicken with the oil and masala then fried it in the pan that had previously sauteed the onion and garlic for about 5 mins then added the sauce to it. I left it to cook for over an hour then added the cream before serving. I also added a tsp of curry powder and increased the garam masala to 1 tbsp. It was amazing!! I will cut back on the amount of butter next time as it was too much, and the salt wasn't needed. But a very authentic tasting recipe
Edit: When making the sauce do not mince the garlic and onion, rather finely chop and fry. Cook with the tomato and spices on low for as many hours as you can (the flavour really comes out) then puree with a wand blender. I manage to use only 2 pans when making this. I am now CONSTANTLY asked to make this and is several of my friends favourite dish that I cook. Thanks so much for this recipe.

i think the recipe is perfect, despite my mistake of not having 'cayenne pepper' & substituting it with 'cajun seasoning' instead. so it turns out more sour than nicely balanced, not spicy enough hubby said. adjusted by adding many sprinkles of black pepper. i made the healthier version with evaporated milk, overall satisfied w recipe. u can follow exactly without going wrong. can't believe i made this :)

This tasted just like the butter chicken at our local Indian restaurant.  The only changes I made was cooking it all in one pot and I left out the tandoori masala.  There was way too much sauce in our opinion, so I would cut the sauce in half for 1 1/2 pounds of chicken.  I'll try the evaporated milk version next time to try to cut the calories.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!

Not having tandoori masala, I substitute either a curry or mix of my own. This dish is exceptionally fragrant and strikes the perfect balance of garam-masala-sweetness and cayenne-heat. The chicken is tender and the sauce velvety and luxurious. Throwing authenticity to the wind I have made this with a red curry powder and beef as well. Excellent. 

Did not enjoy the lighter version as much.

Thanks to this recipe and (served on other nights) the cauliflower recipe submitted by the same cook, my wife doesn't want to go to Indian restaurants any more. Why drive all that way when this is so good at home?

I lived in India for a year and this definitely brings me back.  Way fewer ingredients than most butter chicken recipes, with fabulous results.  I used coconut milk instead of the cream and added a tsp of sugar.

This dish was amazing. I made it for my boyfriend to introduce him to Indian food, and he thought it was really good. The only changes made were that I used 1 cup of whole milk to replace 1 cup of heavy cream, and I used hot madras curry powder instead of the tandoori masala. I also used a lot more than a teaspoon of the spices, I just kept adding more and tasting it until it was "right". I served it over basmati rice. I will be making this again, I think the next time I will add some chick peas. It was so rich and creamy, thank you so much for sharing!

Although I have never made Indian food before, I  was surprised on how GREAT this dish turned out!  I did not have Tandoori Masala, so I subsituted Tandoori Chicken Spice. The Garam Masala was hard to find.  I went to 3 different stores .  This dish was so EASY  to make, and my family loved it!  My son ate the leftovers, for 3 days!  I did not use 4 cups of heavy cream, I thought this was too much.  I used only about 3 cups cream.  I also decreased the butter to 3/4 Cup.   I used 6, very large chicken breasts, which was more than the recipe called for.  This dish is very rich in flavor, so a little bit, goes a long way. Served it with warm naan.   I will be making this again!  A BIG thank you to MN, who submitted this recipe!
UPDATE 4/24/2017:  This is so delicious I make it at least once a month!

This is a great recipe, and really easy to make. I'm a total beginner cook but my friends/family loved it.  I had to make some mods in lack of masala: I used Hungarian paprika and curry in the sauce, curry on the chicken, and garnished with fresh cilantro. Yummi! For next time though I'd figure out a way to make this dish a little lighter with some substitutions, as it is quite the job for the tummy to digest all the cream and butter that goes in there..

This recipe was awesome! However, I made a few adjustments. I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter in place of regular butter and I used only 2 cups of cream. I blended a few canned whole tomatoes and their sauce with some tomate paste to use for the tomato sauce because we were out of it. I reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon, as per the other reviews, and added a bit more cayenne pepper because we like spicy food. Instead of using tandoori masala (which we didn't have) on the chicken, I used butter chicken masala. It came out wonderfully even with all these changes! My younger sister and I made this within an hour tonight. This recipe was so simple and delicious; we will definitely make it again!

Tastes just like a restaurant! TIP: use more chicken than the recipe calls for ... otherwise you will be wishing there was more. LIGHTER VERSION: made this again using lite evaporated milk and lite coconut milk instead of cream. Also omitted the salt and the butter - I cooked the onions in the same pot as the rest of the ingredients- served over sauted bean sprouts, this dish has become a regular at my house. Thanks, mn!

This is AMAZING. I have made this several times. A couple of times adhering to the recipe exactly and it is fantastic. I have made it with the omit salt, substitute 1/4 cup of butter and evaporated milk and it tasted fantastic as well. The next time I cook this I'm trying the coconut milk substitution! 5 stars for the exact recipe and 5 stars for the "lighter" version! :)

I have made this recipe several times and it is always a hit. The only change I make is that I always have to add extra butter to get that perfect orange color.

Really easy and delicious! I replaced the butter with margarine, the cream with evaporated skim milk, and the garam and tandoori masala with teaspoons of ground cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and peppercorn. The colour wasn't as richly red as we were used to seeing in restaurants. Next time, we might add more tomato paste or cut down on the milk, just for aesthetics.

closest to restaurant quality, I have made this exact recipe 6 times now,  depending on how it turns out you may need to add sugar, try not to make it too sweet, goes great with brown rice. My boyfriend is Indian, this his favorite dish, although he likes his mother version he likes this version too he says its impressive. Sometimes i use 1 cup of low fat half and half and 1/2 cup of coconut milk. Make it and enjoy it.

I too tried this recipe because of the short ingredient list, and it's great!  I did buy the called for indian spices and recommend doing so if you are going to make this, as tandoori masala is a different taste than straight curry powder.  I cut back the butter to 1/4 C and one can of evap skim milk, per the author's suggestion and it was still incredibly tasty.  I also think the suggestion of 1-2 t sugar is a good one, I didn't do that but will next time.  1/2 t red pepper is enough if you don't like spicy butter chicken.   Try it out, it's very authentic!

After trying numerous different recipes for Butter Chicken, this one is definitely the one that comes closest to the one we get at our local Indian restaurant.  I've cooked this one twice.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly, and it didn't have quite enough tomato flavor.  The second time I used 2 cups of cream instead of 3, and it was dead on!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I have tried several different recipes before but none come close to the fabulous flavor of this recipe.  I increased the amount of tandoori masala for my taste and I got great reviews.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

The recipe is a 10+++.  My husband and I love butter chicken and when I saw this recipe, I thought..let me try it.  I followed the recipe and did not change anything.  It was sooo good!  Tasted just like what we would get at a restaurant.  I did go to an Indian supermarket to get the exact spices and I'm so glad I did.  I served with garlic naan.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  I thought the prep process was easy too.  Thank you for posting this recipe, it is definetly a keeper.  Yum!!

Wow, this was so good! The short ingredient list drew me in but also made me a little hesitant. Boy was I ever wrong! This was our first attempt at an Indian dish and we couldn't get enough! This makes 4 very large portions, and we are looking forward to the leftovers tonight!   I know it's butter chicken, but small changes make a world of difference in cutting back fat. We used 1/2 cup butter, 2 tbsp garlic, 2 cups heavy cream, 1 small can of evaporated milk and the rest milk. Some store-bought naan and a pot of basmati rice rounded out our meal. There many steps and quite a few dishes to wash, but the end result is worth it!    Next time we might add some tomato paste to thicken the sauce. But otherwise the recipe is perfect, as is! Thank you!

LOVE it!  I did the lower fat version and it was delicious.  It satisified my need for butter chicken!  I did, however, curdle my milk.  But that wasn't the recipe's fault.  I was cooking in an electric skillet and it's hard to control the temperature as well.

This was really great! My husband liked it too. I read some of the reviews, and decided to leave out 1 cup of the heavy cream and leave out the salt. I did not have the tandoori masala, so I took one of the tips someone posted and substituted 1TBS of curry instead. I will definately make this recipe again. Very good!

Very tasty and very simple!  I followed the directions as they were originally written, but after reading others say they reduced the salt, I bought unsalted butter but added in salt per the directions.  The only other change I made was the garum masala - I couldn't find it. I looked all over the supermarket and it was no where to be found. I will have to visit an Indian foods market soon to buy some I guess.  So, since I didn't have any, I added in some cumin in its place.  The dish came out wonderful and everyone at the table raved. Thanks for sharing this delightful dinner!

Great recipe!  And so much easier than any other Butter chicken recipe I've found.  I used the reduced butter and evaporated skim milk version and it still turned out perfect.  I'll keep this recipe for years

I've never made butter chicken before but sure love to eat it! I thought I'd give it a try for company we were having but realized too late that I didn't have garam masala! I concoted my own with indian masala and other substitute ideas I found online.  I was really worried and had my husband on standby to order pizza, but it turned out fabulous!  I used the lower calorie option provided and made all in one pot as per another review.   I LOVE the simplicity of this recipe and the taste was sooo good!  just had the leftovers for lunch! yum!

Thank you!!!!!  The recipe was easy on my budget and tasted just like the restaurant's.  I really think the tandoori masala was the key ingredient and I also made the basmati rice to go along with it.  I used the lower fat/calorie version and couldn't really taste a huge difference.  My husband's appetite thanks you as well!

Super easy. The best and most authentic tasting chicken makahni recipe I've tried on this site to date, although initially I was wary of the light pink color of the dish as opposed to the deep tomato red of most others. Seriously, if chicken makahni is your dish, try this recipe!  Oh, because I only had garam masala on hand, I added more of that than called for in the recipe.

Excellent. Super easy and very tasty. Mine was similar to the suggested low-fat version - I used a can of coconut milk instead of cream, and only about 1/3 cup margarine in total. Hate making extra dishes so I did it all in one pan: browned the chicken with the onions, then added all the rest till it was cooked through. I did simmer till it had boiled down quite a bit (even using a smaller volume of liquid than suggested I found it a bit runny). If the contributor hadn't added a low-fat option I would only have given this four stars, since even with only 1/3 cup marg it was rather greasy and I can't IMAGINE what it would have been like with all that cream and butter.

Easy peasy, and close to restaurant taste -- very close.  My favourite local Vancouver Indian restaurant uses Madras curry paste to flavour their dish, so I used this from my local grocery instead of the garam masala.  Equally as good and very convenient.

We really enjoyed this.  Even my 2- and 4-year old picky eaters ate all their chicken!  I substituted 1 can evap. milk as the author suggested in a review, along with 1/2 can coconut milk and ony 1 cup cream. I only used 2/3 cup butter (might cut that to 1/2 cup next time) and 1/2 tsp cayenne (DH and I can add sriracha at the table but my children won't eat it if it is too spicy).  I also added a small pinch brown sugar to temper the acidic salty tomato taste (not enough to make the sauce sweet though).  I couldn't find tandoori masala, so I subsititued a mix of curry powder, garam masala, and corander.  I browned the chicken in the pan I used for the onons and then poured the sauce over and let it simmer on low and it turned out perfectly tender and flavorful.  We had a TON of extra sauce so we will have this dish again soon!  DH is looking forward to dipping some naan in the sauce for a snack as well.  I was worried this wouldn't be too authentic, but it tasted just like that at our local Indian restaurant and we loved it.  Thanks!

Made this for my "Slumdog" party. I couldn't find the tandoori masala so I don't know what I missed without that flavor,but it was great with Basmati rice.

This recipe comes as close as I can get to the butter chicken I always order from my fave indian restaurant. I had to veer slightly from the recipe as I only had "indian masala" on hand, and I added an extra tbsp of it for more flavor. Following other butter chicken recipes I added 1 tbsp minced ginger. Served it with the naan recipe from this site with rave reviews from all who ate it. I can't wait to make it again!

It came out better the second time I made it. The only changes that I made is that I only minced and caramelized 1/2 an onion and only put about 1 TBS of tandoori masala on the boneless thighs and then added about 1 1/2 tsp of tandoori masala to the sauce. Now it tastes as good as my favorite Indian Restaurant!

I loved the lighter version of this recipe.  It was even better the next day as the chicken soaked up more of the wonderful flavor.

Really enjoyed this recipe. I used suggestions of other reviewer and cooked all in the one pot. I also choose this recipe for the shortened ingredient list. The sauce was a little watery for my liking but will use less cream next time. Will be making this a regular meal!

It was good. I made the low fat version, but I think next time I'll try it the original way to see if it turns out even better

WOW.  This really was easy, and so very good.  I used the entire 1/4 cup butter and whole milk instead of cream.  Used only garam masala in the initial seasoning with cayenne and salt (and a little cracked red pepper).  Didn't add tandoori masala b/c I didn't have any, but we thought it turned out fabulous anyway.  I also took the advice of simmering it all gently in one pan, very good idea.  Served over basmati rice, and we just loved it.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

AWESOME.  I have been looking for a good butter chicken recipe for such a long time, and I know I'm going to be making this one every week! I couldn't make myself use that much butter and cream, so I made the 'light' version mentioned below.  It was AMAZING!  I used about 1/4 cup butter, the evaporated condensed milk, and then threw in about 1/4 cup cream just to make it a bit creamier (would have been good without!).  Thank you for a fabulous recipe!!

Absolutely delicious.  Everyone loved it, even the picky ones.  I doubled the recipe and it made WAY too much sauce, but I froze the leftover sauce to add chicken to later.

WOW!! This is one of the best tasting dishes I have made. My husband and mom raved about how great this was. I too used half the butter. I only had the garam masala, so I used that to marinate the chicken. I also used just one skillet to cook the ingredients. I found the masala spice at an Indian market. Overall, make this dish you will not be disappointed. It will be a family favorite.

WOWZA! Yum. This dish tastes as good as my favorite Indian resturaunt. I followed instructions almost exact. I used a little less cream, a little less butter, and substituded  the tandori masala for 1 tbl of curry powder. Thanks so much for this recipe and I will be making it again.

This was awesome.  Fattening, but awesome none the less.  Could not find the garam masala, so used a table spoon of curry powder instead.  Also, added as previously recommeneded, a tsp of sugar.

I made the low fat version from the ratings. I could not find either of the masalas at my grocer so I used 1 tbsp medium curry powder and 1/2 can coconut milk. It was TO DIE FOR!! Melted in your mouth and the hint of sweet from the coconut milk just knocks your socks off! I'll make this weekly!

After all these amazing reviews I was certain this would be delicious, but it wasn't. I used the revised low fat recipe that called for evaporated skim milk and 1/4 c butter, but it lacked the robustness that makes Butter Chicken so amazing. Next time I am going to use cream, so until then this only gets 3 stars.

I thought this was very good. I didn't use the full 1 cup of butter, because I thought that was way to much. I used a little over 1/2 cup and next time I'll even cut it down more. I also cut the heavy cream down to 2 cups and next time I'll cut down to 1 1/2 cups. I thought the butter and cream over-powered the flavor of the meal. This is a good starting recipe though. Thank you.

Delicious!!!  I used only 1/2c of butter, 1/2 & 1/2 instead of the whipping cream.  Otherwise, made it exactly as written.  Served with Jasmine rice and Palak Paneer.  Yummy!  We couldn't stop eating it!  Next time I will try the low fat version that was recently posted.

The flavor of this was great!  My husband put it at the top of his list.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I couldn't get the sauce to thicken at all, even though I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I will try cutting down on the cream, as some suggested.  If I can figure out the sauce, this will be out of this world!  Updated: this dish has become a staple in our house!  I use one stick of butter and just a couple glugs of half and half.  I can't believe I ever rated it less than 5!

Excellent! There is a great little Indian market less than a mile from our house. I went there to buy the garam and tandoori masala spices because I couldn't find them in any grocery stores. It was worth it because this recipe is awesome. I bought some frozen naan at the same market and dinner tasted just like we were at an Indian restaurant.

Close to the best I've ever had.  It seems to have the right balance between rich creamyness, spice, and sweetness.  Delicious!

Excellent dish! I served it to my picky family! My boyfriend swore off all Indian food, but after tasting this dish, he asks for it almost daily! Definitely a favorite around here!
