This was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good! The only difference I did was put in 4 tbsp of mayo and 2 cloves of garlic (minced). I used medium cheddar cheese in my recipe also. I will definetely make this crab dip from now on, this is the 3rd one I've tried off of allrecipes.com and it's been the best.

This is the only crab dip I have found that is some what similar to mine. My measurements differ and has some additions. Everyone goes nuts over this: 1 small can crab meat drained, 1- 8oz. pkg. cream cheese softened, 1 c. mayonaise.( I think you could cut that in half if fat conscious, but I don't think it would be as creamy.) Can add 1/2 cup minced onion, but I never do. Also, 1 T.lemon juice, 1/2 c. grated cheddar, 1/4 tsp. dry mustard, 1 tsp. worcestershire sauce. Mix all together into pie plate. Bake 350 for 30 min. You can also use 1-6oz. pkg. frozen crab meat thawed in place of canned. You can also add a can of tiny shrimp or sprinkle slivered almonds on top before baking. Serve with a nice butter cracker for spreading. This is our favorite crab dip made this way. I gave it 5 stars cuz it is similar to this dip with some changes. Thanks!

I've made this recipe twice so far, to many great reviews. Although, I did make a few changes. I followed a few suggestions that I had read before. I only used half of the amount of cream cheese (this happened the first time because I didn't have enough)and half the amount of cheddar cheese. Instead of paprika and hot sauce, I used about 1.5 - 2 tsp Old Bay seasoning. Then, I seerved it up with tortilla chips.

Made as is, it's average. It's fast, easy, and looks nice, but if you want something with more flavor you need to add more to it. First I think it could use more crab, and then add other ingrediants such as: garlic, artichoke hearts, green onions, diced green chilies, parmesan, and/or pimentos.

It was a good recipe (did it for 10 servings) 

But, I took the advice of previous reviewers and added 2 cloves of minced Garlic (instead of hot sauce), 1 tsp. Old Bay seasoning (replacing dried mustard), added one can of tiny Shrimp, I used 2% Milk colby/Jack cheese (it melts better than cheddar) putting some on top and used 1 cup of Mayo.  I did however substituted Lite Mayo and Lite Cream Cheese cutting the calories.  

It was delicious, and everyone loved it. It's good with tollhouse crackers and tortilla chips.

I'm writing to tell anyone who's considering making this dip, DON'T DO IT!  It smelled awful while it was baking, which should have been my first clue.  Even the cat didn't come around the kitchen.  I had to work Christmas and this was going to be my contribution for our unit's party.  I was hesitant, but I hoped the dip would taste better than it smelled.  Where I work, the doctors and nurses would probably eat a bowl filled with grass clippings and twigs if you put salad dressing on it.  No one touched this stuff...  What a waste of some expensive ingredients.  I'm only giving this one star because I can't give it ZERO.

I hate when people change a recipe and then rate it but I must admit I did it myself this time. I used lump crab instead of canned, doulbed the cheese, 1 cup shredded chedder and 1 cup shredded white chedder and used 1 cup mayo and it was fantastic. I made it for the hubby's 50th Birthday party and it was nothing less then a hugh hit. To the person that rated it 1 star and said it smelled terrible while cooking you must not be a seafood lover because it smells just like it should.

Addictive.  Best dip I have ever eaten, and I do not really even like crab. Make sure to use sharp cheddar and a bit more hot sauce than the recipe listed.  If you use mild cheddar, the dip will not have enough flavor.  I also used imitation crab meat.

2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened 
4 tablespoons mayonnaise 
2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese 
2 (6 ounce) cans crabmeat 
1 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 
2 teaspoons hot sauce 
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 
paprika, for garnish 

It was very good, my only problem was the amount of cream cheese. It seemed that's all you could taste.. Put me off cream cheese for a couple days :( The only things I did different were I used fresh crab meat and instead of paprika I used old bay's (which was really good!) And I ate most of the dip so it couldn't have been that bad ;)

I thought this was excellent but I used Velveeta cheese instead of the cheddar and salad dressing in place of the mayo. I used my own judgment on the amount of ingredients to use.

Fantastic and very tasty!  I am going to be honest here.  I made it to the "T" but then added more of some of the ingredients to make me happy.  First off I cut the recipe in half.  Then after mixing the listed ingredients I decided to up the lemon juice and hot sauce by tasting it bit by bit.  I did sub Old Bay for paprika because I am a Mid-Atlantic Shark!  I also added almond slivers on the top for decor.  Please try this recipe.  It will be great for the holidays and game days!

My pretentious and critical mother-in-law asked me to bring cheese and crackers among a few other things to thanksgiving dinner, so I wanted to impress her and her husband.  I've tried other hot crab dips on this site which are always too soupy.  After reading this recipe it looked like exactly the thickness I was looking for, particularily because not much mayo is used (other recipes with a cup or more of mayo turned out too greasy and thin).
I did add a few things as per suggestions; however, I think that it is all a matter of personal taste and therefore will not list what I added.  If you are particular, I recomend seperating a small amount of dip from the batch, baking, and taste testing to determine what you would like to add/take away.  
I was very happy with the flavor and especially pleased with the texture.  I used lump crab and the exact amount the recipe called for and in my opinion was the perfect amount. Thank you for sharing a wonderful hot crab dip recipe!

I have been craving crab dip since I made another recipe from this site for a party that didn't turn out well.  I was apprehensive about trying another one, but I did.  I made this tonight just for a weekend snack during a snow storm for my family.  This was awesome.  The only changes I made were adding Old Bay instead of hot sauce and putting cheese on top of the dip.  I also did not use a 9X13, too big of a dish for this.  I don't see how it would feed 40 though.

This crab dip is the best.  I substitute Old Bay for the Hot Sauce as well!  I also placed all of the ingredients in a mini croc pot and use garlic bagel chips to serve it on.

I've made this soooo many times now and everyone loves. In fact, it's usually requested for family gatherings. I usually use the canned Phillips crabmeat (claw or whatever is on sale) and shy away from the 6 oz starkist (or whatever brand) cans. I usually dump everything in the crockpot and cook it, that way it stays warm while you're serving it too.

This is a great all-purpose crab dip.  It doesn't have a lot of flavor, but doesn't really need much if you serve it with a good flavorful cracker.  It's a must for any party.

I just made this crab dip tonight for the first time, and it will definitely be my last! You taste nothing but cream cheese, and it's so overpowering, you don't even get a hint of the crab. None of my family members liked it either. Keep looking for the perfect recipe....this is not it!

I made this because I wanted a quick snack. I made it the microwave because I didn't want to wait. It still turned out great. I halved the amount of cream cheese because I didn't have the full amount. I added garlic and onion powder for added flavor.

Good basic dip, I definitely added my own touches. The only trouble is that once it starts to cool it is no good, so if you want to have it for more than half an hour, make it in several small dishes (it keeps just fine in the fridge before it is baked)

This is a great crab dip!  Made it by the recipe and everyone loves it.  Being from Maine fresh crabmeat is plentiful and it adds more flavor than canned but as written it is great.

I made this recipe for a New Year's party and it was excellent.  I used 16oz of real crabmeat instead of the recommended 12 oz and it turned out great.  Next time I may sprinkle Old Bay on the top instead of paprika.  I baked it in the oven and then transfered it to a crock pot to keep it hot for the party and it seemed to get more and more flavor as it sat.  Perfect!!

I made this as a Thanksgiving appetizer.  The guests all had great reviews for it but husband and I did not like it.  Something about the hot sauce didn't seem to combine well with the other ingredients.  I will try to experiment with other flavors to see what I can turn this into.

I found the dip lacked flavor, I would try cutting the amount of cream cheese in half and adding horseradish and Old Bay.

This is an awesome crab dip.  I added a little more hot sauce for extra punch.

Very good dip, my husband really liked it. There's something... MISSING though. i have to look at a few more recipes and figure it out. I would eliminate the lemon next time, it was a little too bright in the background, i wanted it to be more savory.

I was disappointed. I made this for preThanksgiving snacktime. My family are pretty big seafood lovers and I thought hot crab dip should be a winner. I think this recipe's big downfall is the chedder cheese, that with the cream cheese makes a weird tart taste. I'm still not giving up on the whole crab dip idea but this recipe was not for us.

This was a huge hit at my New Year's Eve party.  I used 13 oz frozen imitation crab meat that I chopped.  I also used one regular cream cheese and one sour cream and chive flavor.  I did not add the hot sauce and cut down on the mayo as others suggested.  I was a winner.

this was a good base, but I just don't think canned crab meat is for me. I bought canned "lump crab meat" and I got the name brand kind, just because I thought it would be tastier, and it was just too fishy and sort of had a fishy smell to it. It also was canned with water, so it had like a squishy water texture going on... it was odd. Maybe I bought the wrong kind of crab? I know it wasn't expired... I think if I used fresh crab meat this would have been awesome, because the cream cheese base was very good. I'll have to give it another try.

Yum-o! I was craving crab dip like I used to order for corporate events that this local upscale catering company makes. Oh, this recipe tastes just like it and was oh so very tasty. I was practicing for a party I'm throwing and certain there won't be one little crabby left in the bowl once I bring this out:). Thanks! Oh, the only changes that I made was to throw in some minced garlic - about 2 cloves and about 1/4 C finely chopped red onion (all I had).

Served this for Thanksgiving.  30+ people came.  Followed the recipe as written.  Was a huge hit.  People ate it on crackers and as a veggie dip.  Will definitely be a mainstay at our Thanksgiving and home parties going forward.

This is a very easy dip to put together and makes a good amount for a party.  It was good, but I thought it was a little on the bland side which is not necessarily a bad thing if you are appealing to a crowd.  I personally prefer it with a little more jazz.

I made this for a Thanksgiving appetizer in my slow cooker and it was a big hit.  Made it exactly as the recipe called for and everyone really enjoyed it - would not change a thing.  Very simple and easy to make - just throw all the ingredients in a slow cooker on low for a few hours while making everything else for a big meal.  Served with Ritz crackers.

This was good.  I used canned claw meat, but lump or backfin would be better.  I served this with garlic melba toasts, but I really think chips (corn, tortilla) would be much better--the salt would set off the dip in a way the toasts did not.  Good consistency.

I just really didn't care for this dip. Very bland to me. Not much taste to it. I would have to add some more seasoning and probally some tabasco for taste. But keep in mind I a Louisiana girl and we like our food a bit on the spicy side. I don't think I would ever make this again.

This was pretty good!  My hubby loved it.  I used Miracle Whip because I didn't have any mayo on hand.  I did not like it with Miracle Whip.  Next time I will use MAYO!!!  It is good with blue corn tortilla chips.  Yummy!

I halved the quantity as I was only making it for Saturday afternoon nibbles for the family, but it turned out great.  I couldn't figure out what the Aussie equivalent of hot sauce was so I just added a bit of Peri Peri sauce.  Will make it next time in a bread bowl, would be great for a party.

I used Parmesan instead of cheddar.  I felt that cheddar might over power the other flavors.  This dip was a huge hit at my home.

I made the recipe as directed except I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, Old Bay instead of paprika, and fresh lump crab meat.  It was not impressive in smell, flavor, texture, or appearance.  I took it to a party and it was only 1/2 eaten because there were other more savory appetizers from which to choose.  I wouldn't make it again.

This was so good. We made it as is and it was delicious... I even repurposed it later by adding heavy cream and some extra old bay and it made an AWESOME pasta sauce! I will definitely be saving this recipe.

It was fast and easy to make. I made it without the lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce or hot sauce simply because I didn't want to run to the store. It tasted fine, I would eat it again. Next time I would put miracle whip instead. It tasted a little bit eggy to me. My friends all seemed to like it.

I've made this a few times. It's always a hit, but I do add a couple things. I add bacon (actually the Hormel bacon pieces work great) and diced artichokes. There is never any left!

Made this yesterday for Xmas Eve dinner, and everyone thought it was okay.  Personally I felt it was too overpowering of crab flavor - I know, that's supposed to be the idea, right?  But it was too much.  Not sure if these made a difference, but for one, I bought fresh lump crab meat, didn't use canned.  And since I cut the recipe in half, I should have needed only 6 oz. of crab but my Whole Foods container size was 8 oz.  Would those 2 factors have made it too crabby?  I don't know.  But I'm not ready to abandon this recipe, it seems like it has potential.  Like other reviewers said, it did seem like something was missing from the taste.  Guess I'll just keep at it...

After looking in every cookbook and online site, this is the VERY BEST Crab Dip I've ever tasted or made.  My friendes and neighbors love when I make or bring to different parties.  Have started making copies so they will stop begging me to make it.  Thank You So Much.

This was one of the easiest crab dips I have made. It also is very DeeeeeLicious. Myself and my family loved it. I only made one change and that was use Old Bay instead and we cut up small bread like Italian and buttered it and a sprinkle of garlic baked and served that and buttered crackers. The bread slices and dip together are Hmmmm Hmmmm good. Thanks:-)

I'd give it 5, but I added Old Bay Seasoning.  How can you have a seafood dip without it?!?!?  It was very good and I will definitely make again.  I usually prefer cold dips though, but I will make an exception for this one!

I have to go middle of the road with this because half the people like it and half of people didn't.  I fall into the did not like it group.  It was missing something, and it smelled funny.  If I were more adventurous with my money I would try it again.

I made this for Christmas and it was delicious.  I used more crabmeat than called for in the recipe, and it was wonderful and simple to make.  I also substituted one of the two bricks of cream cheese for the low fat version to try to keep calories down.  My guests enjoyed it!

This is the second time I've made this, and it was again sadly not that great.  Although hubby said he enjoyed it, it just wasn't what I thought it would be.  I added a bit extra mayo which caused it to come out kind of oily. Because it seemed so dry.  However, it may have tasted better, served on toasted baquettes instead of crackers.  I'm not giving up, I will try again, I love crab dip and Im determined to get it right!

Mmmmm-I really like this dip!I substituted imitation crab flakes for the real crabmeat and tinkered with the amounts(half the amount of cream cheese and omitted the lemon juice-didn't have any). By reducing the cream cheese and using the imitation crab flakes,the consistency was chunkier with pieces of crab.I spread it on to crusty French baquettes and was in heaven!-Thanks Debra for the great recipe!

Too much cheese, you can't really taste the crab. I also ended up adding some milk because it turned out way to thick before I baked it. I might make this again and not add as much cheese.

This was ok.  Nothing special, really.  I doubled the crab in the recipe, and added a bit more hot sauce, but it was still a bit bland.  My husband liked it.

This recipe sounded good on paper so I tried it out for a Thanksgiving snack. I substituted fresh crab for the canned crab and wasted my money.  The consistency was unappetizing and the overall taste didn't mesh.  The only person who ate it and liked it was my Dad and he'll eat anything.

I would say that this would be a good base, but something is missing.  I kept to the recipe, I used Sea Fare Claw Crab Meat and Sargento Chef Blend 4 Cheese Cheddar.  I've tasted better and after heating and tasting I added some Old Bay on top, but still missing something.  One could use and add to it.  Some of the other comments mentioned some great additions, but I always like to stick to the recipe the first time.  Maybe adding some garlic and onion would have helped.

This was soooo yummy!  Only thing I added was Old Bay......it's a Maryland thing!  Next time I will decrease cream cheese to one and a half packages instead of two....it was a bit too runny.

It was almost inedible...there is just no taste in the cream cheese; definitely needs another major ingredient to bind as the cheddar just did not do the job.

I don't know what some of you are talking about, but this was absolutely delicious! It was a huge hit at christmas. My recommendation is to listen to the others and add 1/2 cup onion and 2 minced garlic cloves because it was amazing! Also, I would recommend doubling the recipe for a larger group of people.

Delicious!! Everyone loved it at the party and it even repeats great the next day (but don't count on there being any left!). I used frozen crab meat instead of canned  and cayenne for garnish instead of paprika. The only think I would do different next time is chop up the crab into smaller pieces so it's easier to eat. I served with fresh baked bread, but tastes ok with crackers, too.

I did not like this recipe, but I did make some changes so maybe that's why. I usually don't like to review when I've made changes but I'll review this one. First off, the changes I made were no lemon juice or hot sauce and I added 1 T worcestershire and 2 t old bay seasoning, and I used 1 lb. fresh crab meat. I am accustomed to a little bit thinner, cheesy hot crab dip. This was not it at all. Maybe because I used too much crab meat this was thicker and tasted of mustard. I did not like this at all and the comments it got was that it tasted "crabby" and then no one touched it.

Very good as written. Much better with someone's suggestion of dry mustard = Worcester sauce, plus a healthy dump of black pepper. Definitely use sharp cheddar, and next time it could use some fresh chives or sauteed shallots. And less mayo - about half. I made a half recipe (20 servings), and it was about half deep in a shallot 9" pie plate. 4 of us ate it for dinner on crackers w/ veggie. Mmmm!

It was decent for what it is. I messed around with the ingredients but still didn't really care for it. We used imitation crab so maybe that had to do with it? my 5yo loved it

Not bad, not good, just kind of bland.  Bright side?  You won't offend any guests who don't care for seafood because there is almost no taste.  Down side?  Those who love crab will probably not be impressed and, with the expense of crab meat, you want this to be excellent.

This dip is so fantastic!!! My husband and I actually eat this as a meal on those nights we really feel like counting calories (haha) We halve the recipe and have made a few changes but only for personal taste the base recipe is awesome and how we had it the first couple times. We add about a TBSP of Siracha instead of the 2tsp the half recipe calls for and we make a crust of Panko and Cheddar that melts on the top and makes a cheesy crunchy crust that is so yummy. Great recipe!

Better with real crab, but imitation crab was good too. It's delicious as an appetizer, but also on grilled steak or chicken.

I halved the recipe, because there was only 3 of us snacking, but I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  I might throw in a bit more cheese next time, but we are huge cheese lovers.

This reecipe was not very tasty at all! i was very dissapointed and suprised cause it had such great reviews. Their was too much cream cheese and not flavor at all. Have you people every heard of old bay? To make this recipe any good at all you need a lot of old bay and other seasoning to spice it up!

I love this dip and have made it a few times now!  I made one minor modification - I used 2 teaspoons instead of tablespoons of worcestershire sauce (which made it not quite so strong), but other than that we really enjoy it! :)

I made this for New Year's.  I doubled the recipe & served it in a small crockpot w/ club crackers & garlic & herb crackers.  I have lived in Baltimore, MD all of my life .. so I used Old Bay instead of the hot sauce.
It was all gone B4 the 2009 came in!

Made this dip for a party last night-turned out great, there was nothing left of it!

Added 2 garlic cloves and 1 tsp more hot sauce.  Used canned lump crab meat.  First time making a hot dip and was pleased how well it turned out.  Probably will make it for Christmas too!

Great recipe!  Made it for Thanksgiving appetizer and the only complaint was that they ate too much of the dip and didn't have much room for turkey:)  I did add Old Bay to the garnish.

needs several changes: use sharp cheddar, more hot sauce, someone said to use old bay seasoning instead of the paprika which sounds like a good idea to me, and maybe double the crab. We thought it was pretty good, just kinda bland.

This was pretty good. I didn't give it five stars though because there seemed to be something missing. I think next time I will add some spinach or artichoke to it, something to break up the texture of the dip a little bit.

I've been using this recipe for over 7 years, and I won't share it with anyone!  It's now my secret recipe dip.  I could eat this with a spoon, and a few times I've actually caught someone doing that at a party.  This is perfect.

This was really good I did tweak it to taste and added sauted celery and red onion. I also used hot sauce and more old bay, fresh maryland crabmeat! Nothing else would do. I loved it and am submitted the tweaked version. Thanks Debra for a great recipe!

Tried this for New Year's Eve. It was easy and very good. We do not like spicy foods, so I left out the hot sauce and replaced it with Old Bay seasoning. I will make it again for SuperBowl.

Excellent!!!!  I did use artificial crab meat versus canned & next time, I would add some canned shrimp into the recipe too.  Next time, I think I will add a little more hot sauce & some minced onion as another reviewer mentioned.  I served it with onion crackers, which were good & Triscuits, which I don't recommend.  I got many compliments on this dip & will definately make it again!

I made this exactly as the recipe showed, and we felt it was really lacking in flavor. I used good crab and medium cheddar cheese grated from block. The consistency was pretty good as a dip should be, and it bakes up nice and bubbly and browns just right. I served with pita chips, but we also tried flatbread chips and tortilla chips looking for the best flavor combination. The tortilla chips were a slightly better option than the others, but honestly I think it was because they are saltier and added more flavor than the blander pita and flatbread chips. The dip wasn’t terrible, just did not have much flavor. A good crab dip is one our favorite dishes, and we were disappointed with this one.

came out so good when I first made this for New Years, making this again today! I added a little sweet chili sauce instead of hot sauce.

It was yummy, but I didn't use the paprika or the hot sauce. Instead, I used Tony Chachere's more spice creole seasoning. And I cut the amount of crab because I only had one can, but you can still taste it!

Excellent and easy.  My kids love it.  Tastes lake a dish we get at the Chinese restaurant.  I leave out the hot sauce (we don't like it spicy).  Next time a would cut back on the cheese a bit just as preference but otherwise very good

Really good recipe. I served with buttery/plain crisps and not onion or garlic.I cooked in 9x9 glass dish as shown but the recipe called for 9x13, I believe.

Based on other reviews, I used 16 oz of crab and doubled the hot sauce.  I love crab but, this was a little bland. I did mix it with the mixer so, it was more creamy than chunky.  I think I would mix it by hand when I make it again.

This  came out good and was liked by everyone at the party.  Some things I noticed... I had never had crab dip before so I was concerned that it was lacking some flavor - also, this recipe makes a lot of dip.   For my situation, I think  one package of cream cheese would have worked.   I also didn't have an electric beater so I had to mash and mix this all by hand.   Took some time but I eventually got it where it needed to be.   I chopped up a quarter of the meat and folded in the rest whole.   I was a little worried about seasoning so I added a little bit of salt and pepper to mine and in hindsight I wonder if I should've added some more.   I also  put a thin layer of cheese on the top before baking it.    My $.02, determine how many people you'll be entertaining and consider how much they may actually eat and adjust the recipe if needed - because believe me, this makes a ton of dip.

Not that great. I wanted a smaller batch of this so I halved the ingredients. I forgot to do half and did the amount listed when it came to the Worcestershire, hot sauce and lemon. I forgot to add paprika, but I don’t think it does anything for flavoring. Plus my baking dish might have been a little too deep. The dip tasted OK, but it was lacking flavor. I think adding old bay will help it out a lot.

I made this for a company food day.  I doubled the recipe (very large company) used 2 cans of crab and 2 cans of tiny shrimp, medium cheddar cheese, and added green onion. It turned out good, and everyone seemed to enjoy it. I think next time I will make a few other minor adjustments to it as well.  Tone down the lemon and cream cheese, add a little old bay seasoning and perhaps a bit more spice - and cook/serve it in a crock pot rather than a baking dish (easier to keep warm). Bottom line, it's an easy recipe to make and a likable snack/appetizer for anyone who likes seafood.

I've made this several times over the years. Mostly for Christmas appetizers (my family is crazy about appetizers) or other special occasions. I follow the recipe to the "T" and it's perfect every time. I did switch it up once. I added some spinach and some artichoke hearts. That was great too.

This is a great base! Start with this and build on it or modify it as you like. We have a love of horseradish, so I eliminated the Worcestershire but added about 2 tablespoons of raw horseradish to give it a kick.

After reading other reviews I decided also to tweek the recipe. I added ....
1 tablespoon of Horseradish 
1 teaspoon of chopped garlic 
I left out the hot sauce 
Added old bay Seasoning on top. 
It was delicious. Everyone loved it! 
Very quick and easy to make. Just mix ingredients and put in oven!

This is not very good.  It tastes mostly of cheese.  Not enough crab, not enough spices.  Maybe add some Old Bay Seasoning, decrease the cheese, in other words find a different recipe.

I cut this recipe in half and made it for Mother’s Day. The recipe  was good, quick & easy to assemble but a little lacking in flavor. A great  make ahead appetizer. Next time I may add a clove of garlic and instead of paprika  a sprinkle of old bay seasoning. Thank you for the recipe!

I skipped the paprika, added 4 Tablespoons of chopped green onions & sprinkled Parmesan on the top before baking. Serve with good crackers or Tostitos. Excellent dip. I took it once to a family function & it's now my job. Everyone loves & requests it!

My favorite!  My go-to!  My holy grail!  I like using two cans of the lump crab meat and 1 can of the shredded.  I also crank up the hot sauce.  It’s always a crowd pleaser.  Love this!

When trying a recipe I usually make it as stated. The only time I change things up if there is an ingredient that I don't like then of course I omit that. This is just what I was looking for. I know people added other ingredients to give it "more flavor" but I'm looking for a crab dip because I want to taste the crab. Not hide the flavor. Adding anything to this is a waste of the crab flavor. Smh. I cut the recipe in half as it was just for 3 people. It calls for 6 oz of crab but my cans are 4.25 oz so I did double up on the cans. Then made exactly as written. I'm now eating this by the spoonful!  I wish I could smell this while it was baking but we were in the midst of making applesauce so the smells were intertwined! This is a really good dip as!!!

Great base. I omitted the hot sauce and Worcestershire. 
Used local crab boiled in a local seasoning.  Added two extra tp of seasoning to crab and let it sit overnight. Added two finely chopped green onions and two cloves of garlic. This was a great dip.

A little too much cheese (something I almost NEVER say) but that could have been my fault.  It came out more like a cheese dip with crab in it than a crab dip with cheese. But freaking DELICIOUS regardless!

This turned out great and everybody enjoyed it.  I only used 1 teaspoon of hot sauce instead of 2. I will make it again.

Followed recipe exactly except I used nice fresh crab meat. I was excited and anticipating something delicous but this was DISGUSTING.  It was so FISHY, it tasted like hot cat food. I threw the whole expensive mess into the garbage.

This is a good dip, if I make it again I would add more mayo to loosen it, it was more thick than I would prefer. I also like spicy flavors so I would add more hot sauce. Thanks!

Based on other reviews I did make some changes. I doubled the Worcestershire Sauce and Hot Sauce (I used Frank's Hot Sauce which is not too hot). I also used Shredded Italiano Cheese Mixture (Swiss, mozzarella, and cheddar). Two chopped green onions were mixed in. I think those changes enhanced the flavour and ensured that it would not be bland. I served with slices of fresh lemon and crackers.

Family really enjoyed this. I think adding lump crab, or small chunks of imitation crab legs might add more texture. Baked it in a casserole dish, which allowed a great  bubbly cheese-to-dip ratio.

I'm allergic to crab, so I use crab substitute, and that comes in a 12-ounce package.. The first time, I made it as listed. The following times, I made a few changes, too. I added more hot sauce, cut the amount of cream cheese in half, and used pepper jack cheese (for an extra kick).
I've made this for numerous parties and gatherings, and I always end up with an empty dish.

This is a good base recipe but you should definitely modify to make it extra special. I added an extra package of cream cheese, about 1/3 cup extra mayo, one can of lump crab meat, about a cup of parmesan, a few handfuls of fresh spinach and fresh garlic. I omitted worsh and hot sauce. I serve with pita chips. People always ask for the recipe everytime I make it!!

I really love this recipe, but I did tweek it some.  Not a huge fan of hot sauce so I omitted it and added about 2 tsp of Old Bay Seasoning and garlic powder. And also sprinkled some extra sharp cheddar on the top before baking.  Came out delicious!

I tried this recipe and followed another person's suggestion, using only 1/2 the amount of cream cheese and I substituted 2 tsp of old bay for the hot sauce and paprika. It was excellent!!!  I will make it over and over again I am sure.

I added a tbsp of minced garlic and 4 chopped scallions, and used Old Bay instead of paprika.  I almost feel like it could have used a touch of salt.  This was okay when warm, straight out of the oven, but it was much better after it had cooled to room temperature and then the next day.  After the flavors had melded, it was awesome.  This is a dip you want to serve on water crackers or toasted baguette slices.

Love this recipe.  Definitely on par (if not better) than most of the popular crab dip offerings in our area restaurants.  I also use Old Bay seasoning in place of the paprika and some finely chopped water chestnuts for crunch, yummy!  I also make sure to use the best lump crab meat available, seafood dept at our local grocer usually has 1-lb cans of lump crab meat on ice, makes all the difference in the world!

I've made this so many times for family holiday dinners that everyone asks me to bring it every time.  They all love it!  I don't use any other recipe than this one and it's the easiest thing to make.  It's SO yummy.

This recipe is super tasty and great for parties! I made it for a potluck and people raved! I added an extra can of crab because I like mine extra "crabby"! The small amount of hot sauce is perfect and not too spicy at all, even for people who don't like spice much. I'll definitely make this recipe again! :)

I made this for a Thanksgiving appetizer and everyone went crazy!   I had to give out 4 copies of the recipe that night.  It does make a LOT though, so if you have lots of other appetizers as I did, cut it in half.  (I just sent the other half home with one of the recipe-askers!)  The only thing I did differently was substitute one package of fresh crab for one can so I had one of each.  It was a little more expensive that way, but not much.  I also served it with warm pita bread.  Scrumptious!  Great recipe, Ponygirl.  I will definitely make it again.

I had to change a little to use what I had on hand.  No hot sauce, colby/monterey jack cheese, some canned shrimp with the crab, and threw it all in a crockpot.  Everywhere I've taken this it has been gone, and everyone has wanted the recipe!

Fabulous football food!  My only variation was to use 1 cup monterey/cheddar and 1 cup mozzerella in place of straight cheddar, I baked a french bread loaf and served it on thin warm rounds as an appy at kickoff, it's a hit!

I made this dip on 8/28 and it turned out very well!  Since a few reviewers said it was bland as written, I added a bit of celery salt, onion powder, garlic power, white pepper and Old Bay, omitting the hot sauce.  I served it with the butterfly shaped Pepperidge Farm entertaining crackers and it was well received.  I've been asked to make it for future get togethers.  I gave the receipe four stars since I added so many seasonings on my own but it's a very, very good base.  I also put this in a 2 quart crockpot for about 90 minutes.

I loved this recipe!  I can't wait to fix it again.  I cut the recipe in half to make sure we liked it, but next time I make it I will make the whole thing.  I had a little left and it was as good reheated as it was fressh out of the oven.  I served it with pilsbury french bread.  It was great.

This is an absolute hit every time we make it!!! We use fresh crab instead of canned, and it makes a big difference. Takes about 2lbs of crab legs to get the right amount.

This was my first attempt at crab dip and I enjoyed this recipe a lot. I took into account some of the other reviews about the Old Bay Seasoning. I substituted the Old Bay for the hot sauce but I think it still need a little bit more kick. The only other thing I might try and add next time is artichoke hearts. I will definitely use this receipe again.

Made this for the first time  last night and everyone loved it.  The only changes I made was to half it since I only had one can of crab and I also substituted Old Bay for the hot sauce.   It's a new staple recipe for sure!  Very quick and easy to make.

The only reason I do not give this recipes 5 stars is b/c I tweak it slightly.  I do not like spicy food, but adding an extra dash or two of hot sauce and some seafood seasoning (ie old bay) it is supperb!

This is a great fast appetizer to whip up. I use it to take to parties. Everyone loves it. Sometimes I'll add a can of small shrimp in place of a second can of crab. Fresh crab & shrimp is even better if you have access.

Living in the Chesapeake Bay region, I have many crab dip recipes but I have to say this is the best one yet!  Everyone who has tried it loves it, including my nephew who is a chef.  The only substitution I made was to add 2 tsp minced onion and 1 tsp horseradish.

I'm still giving this 5 stars, even though I had to modify it a little! Instead of cheddar cheese I used monterey jack. I left out the hot sauce. I added garlic powder and seasoning salt. I also halved the recipe. It was fabulous! It was served with parmesan garlic crackers. Went great with our Asian themed dinner!

Absolutely delicious variation.  I used half the amount of crab and added ground shrimp.  Also added 4 cloves of minced garlic.  This appetizer was gone within 10 minutes of putting it out to guests.

I made this quick and easy crab dip for about 200 people at my church.  It was easy with the recipe scale.  That was 1 month ago.  They are still asking for crab dip.  They loved it.  Thanks allrecipes.com--keep the recipes coming.

I am not sure the amount of worchester sauce was correct.  It seem like 2 tb is way too much.  I used 2 tsp and it was plenty.  The mixture comes out very thick, it could be thinned out with some milk I think.  It makes quite a large batch.
