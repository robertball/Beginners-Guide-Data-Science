The addition of prosciutto sounds wonderful! Being that my paternal grampa was from Greece I highly recommend trying this recipe with Feta instead of goat cheese ;-) They taste awesome grilled too! One more tip for those who might like to try an additional flavoring is to whisk together an equal amount of honey and red wine vinegar for drizzling.

I made this recipe last night for dinner guests and it was a huge hit! Even those who have never had figs or thought they wouldn't like figs loved them. Three minor changes I made were 1) to use Panache Tiger Strip Fig 2) topped with diced thick sliced bacon instead of prosciutto and 3) I didn't drizzle with honey as the figs were juicy and sweet on their own. Truly delicious! Shared the recipe with friends; will definitely make this again.

We make a similar version at our house. All the same ingredients minus the honey.  But most important we serve it raw!  I usually cut the prosciutto into strips and wrap around my 1/4 fig with desired amount of goat cheese. I've made them with light and dark figs and plain and herbed cheese. It all comes down to taste. I say skip the oven!

6:30 a.m.  Just read this and had fresh figs on my kitchen counter (from my tree).  Also had soft, mild cheese, bacon, honey.  I immediately put everything together being as quiet as possible and enjoyed this little bit of heaven.  And Deeli's honey/vinegar mix is genius!

Great taste! I whisked honey with equal parts of aged Balsamic vinegar for a sweet/tart finish and, being Greek, I used Feta.

I forgot the honey.  I'll try it with honey tomorrow but I did not suffer for the lack of it. Easy and yummy
