Delicious! I did not add the walnuts b/c the kids do not like them in their banana bread, but that was my only change. Great flavor, super moist and the best part is that it is a healthier version of the original, which I'm always on the lookout for. This is a definite keeper in my house~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This banana bread is amazing! I substituted natural applesauce for the yogurt just for preference and had to cook it a little longer. I love that it doesn't have refined sugar and uses whole wheat. Thank you for this recipe!

This recipe is a Keeper!  I was out of plain yogurt and used about 1/3 cup of milk and it was moist and flavorful .  I'll make sure I have yogurt on hand  next time.....I  am sure it will be even better!

Iâ€™ve been searching for a banana bread recipe that includes whole wheat flour, less refined sugar, yogurt and lots of banana. I finally found it! The only changes I made were to use maple syrup in place of honey, and more butter in place of coconut oil. It takes about 70 minutes total in my oven, and I judge doneness by using an instant read thermometer to test when it reaches 190 degrees F. This bread is moist and delicious and is now in my regular rotation of healthier snacks for the kids. Great recipe!

I was just about to modify another recipe when I discovered this one! I wanted something healthier using whole wheat, coconut oil and no sugar. And this did not disappoint! It was perfectly sweet and moist, but took about 75 minutes to bake (I did use 4 bananas so maybe that's why). Quite early into the baking I did find I had to shield the pan with tinfoil, but I didn't modify anything other than omitting the nuts just because of my young toddler. Hmmm, I may have doubled the spices, but that's a preference thing. Definitely tasted like more!!

Just made this and it's very good. Love that it's healthy. If you are looking for a sweet banana bread, this is not it. Despite the honey and over-ripe bananas, I don't get even a hint of sweetness out of it.  Different, but good!

I had to make a few changes but it turned out great. My son is allergic to eggs so we did the "baking soda and vinegar" substitute. I also only had regular yogurt instead of greek. The walnuts was only in the oven for about 10 minutes when they started to over bake so I did not like the taste of them in the bread. Other than that, the taste of the bread itself was amazing!

I don't like things very sweet but I'll add another 1/4 cup honey next time.  Other than that, the bread was good

I love that this uses whole wheat flour, yogurt and honey.   The flavor is really wonderful.  I used 3 bananas and only a cup of walnuts. I didn't care for walnuts in this  so I will not use them again. I did add 1/2 c. coconut, which I will do again.  My mistakes include substituting baking powder (because I didn't think my baking soda as fizzy enough in the pretest) without adding an acid/lemon/vinegar to make up for the switch and forgetting my melted oil and butter until the end.  While it passed the tooth pick test, the loaf was dense and  didn't raise as much as I would have liked.  Seeing though that , I think this is a great recipe and I will make it again (properly)  because it really is a healthier route to a great taste.  thanks for a great recipe.

This is very good. I left out the walnuts and the butter. I use 4 smaller bananas for the 1.5 cups. Also use greek yogurt. The bread cooked up in 55 mins and had a beautiful rise.. Not to mention smells great. Not sure why but its a bit on the bland side to me.. Even with the salt added. Perhaps it may need more of something. Will make this again though foresure!

This is delicious!  It has a great flavor and is very moist.  This will be our favorite and only banana bread to make from now on.
