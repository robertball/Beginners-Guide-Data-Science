I made this according to the recipe except that I mixed half of the basil into the eggs along with the salt and pepper. It was amazing - my 1.5 year old daughter even loved it. It's got a great fresh vegetable taste without any of the really strong flavors common in frittatas that make them tricky to serve to people with varied tastes.

Made this for dinner tonight and everyone loved it!  Did not have sun-dried tomatoes but used fresh instead.  Also added mushrooms.  Will definitely make again!
