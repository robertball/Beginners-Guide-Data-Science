These pork chops were awesome! My husband is the pickiest eater ever, and he was even raving about these. The only thing I changed in this recipe, was I used a can of the Coco Casa Cream of Coconut instead of the coconut milk. I used a little more than the recipe called for, too. I will definitely be making these again!

**Edit**
I tried this recipe again using coconut milk and they did not taste good at all. I recommend using coconut cream instead, it's much sweeter and really compliments the lime and the pork chops.

This was delicious! The coconut milk was very mild and the lime overpowered it and made it tart, so I added some brown sugar which really enhanced the flavor of the coconut! I made this dish with pineapple salsa and white rice. I'll be making this dish again! Thanx!

I changed this recipe around to be more like an actual pina colada, and it turned out amazing!  I only gave it 4 stars because of all of the changed I felt I had to make, but I didn't make it the original way.  It just seems bland.  First, I marinated the pork longer than what it says to do - probably about 30 minutes.  I added a full lime to the marinade, and then added some limeade to completely submerge the pork chops.  I used fresh coconut water, and ended up using all that was in the coconut (I wanted more coconut flavor than what the recipe called for).  I added about 3 tablespoons of rum extract (I liked a lot of rum flavor too - others may want to use less).  I also added a small can of crushed pineapple.  Then to thicken it, I put a bit of corn starch in it, boiled it, then simmered it for about 10 minutes.  The end result was fantastic.  Next time I may use coconut cream instead, and maybe even some real rum.

I made this for supper tonight because I realized that we are WAY overstocked on canned coconut milk...  We couldn't taste the lime juice on the pork chops once they were cooked, which was a bummer.  After reading the other reviews, I decided to add a cornstarch-water mixture to our coconut milk as it was heating to thicken it up, and also added some brown sugar to sweeten it, and another reviewer said, that did enhance the coconut flavor.  I don't know that we'll make this again, but I appreciate the idea of making the coconut sauce - I could certainly do it easily enough and could use it for dipping chicken tenders in, or even use it for a dessert/breakfast recipe.

We were very dissappointed with this recipe.  It sounds really good, but tastes nothing like a pina colada.  It's always good to try something new, but we will never make it again.

This was only ok. First off, I didn't expect it to taste anything like a pina colada. There would need to be pineapple in it for it to be a PINA colada flavor. I think next time I may actually try some pineapple juice instead of or including the lime to sweeten it up. That may do the trick. This had a very bland flavor and I agree with another reviewer about the lime flavor getting lost in the mix. They weren't bad, just not great.

I thought that this was a great "root" recipe.  I added garlic, onion, and a whole lime to the coconut milk.  I pan fried the boneless pork chops until brown and then poured in all of the milk.  Covered and simmered until done.  The pork chops were very, very tender.  I will make this again.

Disappointing. Sounded good, and the coconut milk was excellent served over the rice but as for the chops :( 
enough said. I will keep my pina colada's for drinking.

I really enjoyed these- made exactly as directed except used 1cup of coconut milk to make a bit more sauce. I then drizzled the sauce over steamed jasmine rice. Quick, easy, healthy, and tasty.

This was really good...I will be making this again. Because I did not have limes I used lemons instead and grilled these on the inside house grill. Super and fast recipe.

Tried this recipe tonight, it was attached to a sticker on my pork chops... OMG, it was delicious, a hit with the entire family, even my daughter who is not a fan of pork loved it. My first bite reminded me of something I might have ordered from Carraba's, no kidding, it was that good. The only things I did differently were to season the chops with garlic salt and pepper after marinating in the lime juice, and I added chopped garlic and a little dried cilantro to the coconut milk lime sauce and reduced it a bit. I didn't have fresh cilantro. This one is a keeper, I'll definitely be adding this dish to the meal rotation!
