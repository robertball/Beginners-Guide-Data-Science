This sounds amazing!  I am going to make a half-recipe with the following substitutions, since I don't have the spreadable cheese blend or the refrigerated crab meat.  Lower-fat Neufchatel cheese, chopped canned artichoke hearts, frozen chopped spinach, (defrosted & with excess moisture pressed out) and canned lump crab meat.  Bet it will turn out just great!  Will provide crackers and zucchini rounds to scoop.
