This had a great mild flavor - I added a bit more ginger and garlic as well as adding a few water chestnuts and bamboo with the peas.  My only comment would be that it only makes enough sauce to barely season the shrimp and veggies - if you like it really saucy or want to put it over rice, double the sauce.

MMMMM! I have tried to make Chinese recipes before and I could never get the sauce right. I think the trick was the instruction in this recipe to mix the liquid with the cornstarch before adding to the pan. Beautiful! I love veggies so I added carrots cut into match sticks, bamboo shoots, mushrooms and red bell peppers. I didn't have any chives so I used a chopped scallion which I prefer anyway! The sauce was great..increased the soy sauce, then I had to use rice vinegar in place of the rice wine and added crushed red pepper flakes since I like spicy food. The key to this recipe coming out great was twofold. First, I used toasted sesame oil and I think it gave the dish a rich, deep flavor. Veg oil would have been too bland. The second is to cook it very quickly and keep it moving..even if the sauce looks a little too thin, by the time you turn off the stove and pull out a plate it's good to go. Do not overcook because you'll end up with rubbery shrimp, limp veggies and overly thick sauce. The cooking times seem so short but they are spot on! I cannot wait to try this recipe with chicken and other chinese veggies like bok choy and water chesnuts. This is now my go-to recipe for a delicious Chinese feast. Forget take-out!

This was so good.  I also doubled the sauce, which was defiantly the way to go if you are serving it over some rice. I also doubled the garlic and ginger because I love both of those flavors.  This was an awesome recipe. Thanks.

This was just excellent, but I played around with this dish a little and had some fun.  I used peanut oil rather than vegetable oil and green onions rather than chives (because I had them and because the chives in my garden haven't broken ground yet).  I added a dribble of toasted sesame oil to the cornstarch mixture, the flavor of which is unique and incredible. Snow peas aren't my favorite, particularly JUST snow peas - so I added onion, zucchini, mushrooms, onions and baby bok choy.  I served this over hot cooked rice and garnished it with chopped green onion.  I wouldn't have cared for this with just the snow pea pods, but that's a subjective thing and not a criticism of the recipe.  With the added vegetables, at least for Hubs and me, this was quite an enjoyable dinner.

Very tasty!  Great sauce! We used pre-cooked frozen jumbo shrimp which we just thawed and added towards the end of stir frying the veggies.  Also added some orange bell pepper to the mix.

Super easy and most of the ingredients are on hand.  I doubled the sauce (a must in my opinion) and used dry sherry in place of rice wine.  Also, since I didn't have fresh ginger on hand, I just used ground ginger from my spice drawer.  I realized after making this that I used sugar snap peas instead of snow peas-still yummy. Served over brown rice.

Not bad tasting sauce. It probably needs a bit more ginger or garlic.

This is a great recipe! I did make a few changes: doubled the sauce as suggested and added 1 tsp. of sesame oil to it and a few shakes of red pepper flakes. I also added sweet onion, broccoli, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, water chestnuts and cashews. The cooking times are perfect with the veggies being nice and crisp. The beauty of this recipe is that it is a good basic recipe that is easily adapted to your taste. Husband raved over this one! Thanks for a great recipe... it's a keeper! (Next time I'm trying it with chicken.)

This is a great, healthy, low cal dish and easy to make. Definately double the sauce because it is so good! I cut down the garlic to 2 tsp instead of 2 TBSP which seemed like too much even though we love garlic and I hit it with about 5 drops of tabasco sauce to add a little pop. Everyone in the family loved it. Will also try sauce on a veggie stir fry.

I had to eliminate some ingredients due to allergies and it was still absolutely incredible.  I eliminated the soy sauce, sugar, wine, broth and cornstarch.... I did add ginger from a jar and everything else... it was very fresh tasting!!!

The flavor was out of this world! I used sesame oil for the shrimp by themselves and had to add more chicken broth at the end because it was too thick. YUMMY!

Very good!  pretty much stuck with the recipe except subbing for ingredients on hand.  Fresh ginger, Mirin instead of wine or sherry, celery instead of snow peas and reconstituted chicken powder/water instead of opening a whole can of broth.  This one is a keeper.

Added bok choy and one thin carrot to the recipe.  Used about 1/8 tea of sesame oil during the cooking of the shrimp... Subbed green onions and doubled the sauce recipe as suggested in other reviews.

Served it over steamed Jasmine rice (Chinese style).  It was a hit.  Thank you!

Pretty darn bland. And I'm not sure doubling the sauce would've done anything for this dish. Sesame oil didn't even bring the flavor. I was surprised. I had a mix of veggies from the produce section that had snow peas, broccoli, carrot shreds...I even added more carrots and some onion to get the right amount of veggies... The fact I love veggies was pretty much the only saving grace.

It was alright.  A good way to use snow peas, so I might make it again.  I'd probably add a little more ginger and soy sauce next time.

Yummmmmm!   I doubled up on the ginger and pepper, because I wanted some intensity and this was really good.   I served it over some Barilla Plus angel hair pasta to get more nutrition than white rice. Very pleased to add this to my recipe box.

This recipe gets 4 stars for the sauce, 3 stars for the veggies. I didn't like having just snow peas. Even though they are one of my favorites for stir-fry, alone they were a little boring. The sauce, however, was really very good. It had a nice mild flavor that the kids especially enjoyed. But I did have to double the amount (and could probably have done so again!)It was a very easy and quick to make.

I made a few modifications - I tripled the sauce (and used black pepper instead of white - just a personal preference), doubled the garlic (grated fine to almost a paste to get more flavor), and used baby bok choy, mushrooms, and scallions for the veggies, and served with hot jasmine rice - it was great! Would prefer some spice in a dish like this but that's taken care of with a little spicy chile sauce on top!

One of my favorite recipes from Allrecipes.com.  My friend Cindy suggested adding water chestnuts for crunch.  It makes the recipe even better.

Liked this recipe; super easy; I just added the veggies I had on hand: mushrooms, carrots, green beans.  Next time I will omit the sugar, add dried red pepper flakes and add the shrimp last so that it isn't over done.

Great recipe, although I too agree that sauce should be doubled.  Made a few changes based on my personal taste.  I used green onions (the green part only) instead of chives, and used sherry instead of rice wine.  I marinated the shrimp (used 1/2 lb for 2 people) in about a tsp of sherry before cooking.  I put some of the garlic in the oil (get it VERY hot) before cooking the shrimp... the garlic and sherry give the shrimp a great flavor.  I also used a bit more snow peas and about 4 -5 cut up stalks of bok choy.  I served this with rice and a side of fresh mushrooms sauteed with minced garlic, oyster sauce and soy.  Great meal!

Followed the recipe exactly with two exceptions: only had low-sodium soy sauce on hand and used gin instead of rice wine. Served this on jasmine rice and topped the stir fry with a dash of sriracha. Really good.

I made extra sauce and added extra fresh ginger since we like ginger. I served it with brown rice. This recipe was extra easy and tasted great. The list of ingredients looks long but went together easily.

I made this recipe last night for dinner and it was delicious! I used sherry instead of rice wine and added broccoli and carrots, it just didnt seem like enough veggies to me without. I also tripled the sauce (we are sauce lovers) and served over jasmine rice. YUM! Next time, I'm going to try using sesame oil instead of vegetable and maybe adding some fish sauce to the sauce...

Most stir-fry sauce recipes seem far too salty or sweet making it difficult to taste anything BUT the sauce, but my wife and I agree that the sauce in this recipe makes for a perfect complement to the rest of the dish without masking the other flavors. 

The timing in the cooking directions is spot on. I have a tendency to overcook my stir-fry meats and veggies so I promised myself I'd stick to the suggested timing (even with added carrot slices) and I'm glad I did. 

We ended up doubling up on the garlic, ginger and sauce (as many suggested). We also used a wider variety of veggies and included cabbage, broccoli, mushrooms, scallions, carrots, and celery along with snow peas. Then we served the works over quinoa cooked with chicken broth. Fantastic! We will be making this again.. and again, and again...

I found this recipe to be very good but it lacked interest. The next time I make this dish I plan to modify it by adding a 1/2 to 3/4 cup of sliced red bell peppers and a cup of sliced mushrooms. I recommend that you saute the peppers and mushrooms until they are tender before adding the shrimp. To the sauce I think by adding 1/3 tsp of red chili paste should give it the interest it needs and this small amount will not be overwhelming.

I found this while looking for a good way to use a bag of fresh sugar snap peas. Really excellent flavor and easy to make. I used mochiko (sweet rice flour) instead of cornstarch and subbed a mixture of water and white wine for the broth and rice wine, as well as using sugar snaps instead of snow peas. I also added a dab of sesame oil to the vegetable oil used for cooking. Great recipe!

Yum! Double the sauce for sure. Mixing the liquid with cornstarch beforehand made this recipe unique and worked well. Be sure to mix just a little liquid with the starch before mixing everything together to avoid lumps.

This is my first time rating a recipe. (I know.... shame on me!!!)
I make most of my stir - fried meals without a recipe since I have quite a collection in my head from trial & error over the years. I do not have one for shrimp with snow peas & ginger, so I went searching & I have to say that this was a wonderful recipe & easy to make. 
My husband & I are huge garlic & ginger I doubled the amount of garlic & ginger (I add extra garlic, ginger, & pepper to almost everything)
This IMHO is an A+ recipe! :)

I used the sherry and substituted green onions for chives and added a 1/8 cup of shredded carrots. I used a 12 oz package of frozen shrimp, which I dried thoroughly.  This is a keeper for me. I found the sauce very flavorful and it was a nice light dish. I served it with white rice.

Super easy recipe to make!  I followed the others suggestions and doubled the sauce, ginger, and garlic.  I also added water chestnuts to it (but you can add nearly anything).  You can also use black pepper instead of white (but you'll be able to see the flecks).  I served it over brown rice.  I'll def make this again.

Very good recipe! My children loved it.  We added baby corn which turned out to be a great addition.

Following earlier advice, I doubled the sauce. Then, because earlier reviews had suggested a lack of flavor/spiciness (and because I grew up in Baltimore) I sprinkled some Old Bay seasoning on the shrimp before stir frying. It was great! I highly recommend trying the Old Bay.

The flavor is excellent, but I doubled the sauce and it is still dry.  I also tripled the garlic and ginger.  Next time I will quadruple both.  I topped with cashews right before serving, which added great flavor.  Overall, a woderful meal that tasted like it came from a restaurant!

Very good!  Next time, I'll increase the sauce slightly, and maybe add some broccoli and carrots. But my family just loved it!

my husband and the kids loved it. they said it tasted more flavorfull than the chinese resturant and that is saying a lot because we eat chinese a couple times a week and are very picky about which resturants we eat at. I tripled the sauce and used more garlic a tad too much, also used double black soy sauce in addition to regular soy sauce.Which gives it a more authentic asian taste. Instead of snow peas i added broccli and canned bamboo shoots and served it over steamed jasmine rice.I will make at least once a week. very good shrimp dinner.

Had a huge bag of fresh snow peas we found on sale and decided to try this because I had frozen cooked shrimp in the freezer (added at the very end).  I read the reviews and used some sesame oil, left out the wine (didn't have any) but added asparagus, zucchini,  bok choy, and water chestnuts that I happened to have. I doubled the sauce as well.  I forgot to use up a yellow bell pepper and didn't have any mushrooms  but what  I ended up with was phenomenal!  I don't have much experience with this type of cooking (stir fry) but will be trying it again soon. Too bad snow peas are so expensive.

Delicious!  Took the suggestions of other comments and doubled the sauce/spice mixture, garlic and ginger. Also added bella mushrooms (cooked that first with a little garlic and ginger and removed it from the skillet), then followed the instructions. Added a can of bamboo at the same time as snow peas.  Then add back in mushrooms at the end.  The amount came to be good for about 3 portions with rice, which is perfect for a dinner for two plus someone gets a yummy leftover lunch the next day!

My family loved this dish! I doubled it and modified it to make it spicier by using garlic powder and chili powder on  the shrimp and a hot chili pepper chopped with 3 tablespoons of fresh ginger and a whole large yellow onion. I didn't have cornstarch so substituted flour instead and rice vinegar in place of rice wine. An entire cup of chicken broth too, so we had lots of sauce for the 2lbs of shrimp an a lb of snow peas. Served the dish with Alter Eco's sticky purple jasmine rice- my favorite!

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and doubled the sauce, ginger and garlic.  When I taste tested prior to serving, I felt it needed a little more seasoning.  I added another tablespoon of low sodium soy sauce, a splash of szechuan spicy stir fry sauce and 1/2 cup of low sugar orange marmalade.  The additions created the flavor I was looking for.  I guess my taste buds have aged and need a bit more oomph.

The entire family thought this was delicious, and it's a great way to get them to eat their vegetables! I added mushrooms and water chestnuts and put the shrimp in last. Doubled the sauce but next time, will triple or maybe even quadruple, the kids like things almost soupy.  Great recipe!!

Love how this recipe turned out. I did modify it by adding Chinese Pechay, Porcini Mushrooms, Celery and Coriander. Will definitely make it again. Maybe try it with chicken breast or beef.

Quick to make, and a good mild flavor.  I probably added more than 6 oz of peas, and also tossed in some red bell pepper and scallions I had in the fridge.  Served over rice and it was a light, quick, weeknight dish.  Thanks!

Thank you for this recipe! I loved it!    I get something called stir-fry shrimp at a local Chinese restaurant and have been trying to figure out the recipe for a while. This is it! I doubled the sauce like others here and omitted the peas (I like stir-fried veggies on the side).  I highly recommend it!

This was really good! I added one teaspoon sesame oil to the soy sauce/cornstarch mixture, and added a few more vegetables, like celery, broccoli, and baby corn. I also increased the sauce as suggested by others. Lastly, I substituted splenda for the sugar (on a diet). Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was delicious!  I made it for my 12 and 10 year old daughters and three of their friends and they LOVED it!!!  They devoured every bit of it.  Very kid friendly yet sophisticated enough for a more "mature" palette (My kids just pick out anything they didn't like). I quadrupled the sauce. It helped to have the extra sauce because I added chicken, zucchini, mushrooms, broccoli and water chestnuts.  I didn't have fresh ginger on hand so I added ground ginger to the sauce.  I didn't have rice wine so I added white wine instead and a little rice wine vinegar.  I served it over jasmine rice.  My kids say it's a keeper and I agree!

I tripled the sauce and it was too much.  Doubled would have been perfect.  I like the flavor of the sauce.  I didn't think it needed more garlic or ginger like the other reviews.  I added water chestnuts for extra crunch.

Very good base recipe for stir-fry.  I substituted chicken for the shrimp, and broccoli and carrots for the peas.  Also took advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce.  Rated 4 only because it's been a long time, and I haven't made it again.
