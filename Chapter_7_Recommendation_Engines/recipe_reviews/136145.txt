Yum! Great flavors--I added vanilla bean to the cream cheese mixture. Also, did individual-sized by slicing cookie dough, placing in lined muffin pans and baking as directed. Worked wonderfully and was a great hit! Fruits I used were blueberries, kiwi, strawberry, and mandarin oranges. Will post photo. PS: I have made with orange marmalade in the past, which works as well as apricot. Gives such a nice sheen to enhance the appearance.

Awesome...we loved it.  I brought this to an easter brunch and was a huge hit.  I used a package sugar cookie mix instead of the pre-made ones and it worked out fabulous.  I will definately make again as it was super tasty/easy!!

I have been making this for years and it is OH SO GOOD!!!! Everyone who tries it LOVES it. Easy to make and very versatile with whatever type of fruit you like (just not fruit that is super juicy, i.e. watermelon). You can use use peach preserves or orange marmalade or a combination. This recipe is AWESOME!!

I love philly fruit pizza!  I made mine with Pillsbury Pet Ritz pie crust, flattened down on a pizza stone.  Then I used 1/3 less fat philly cream cheese to make a bit healthier.  Jersey peaches and blueberries with mandarin oranges...it looks like an orange flower!

Fruit Pizza is a family favorite, but I try to keep it simple. I use a disposable, foil pan, if I am taking this to a BBQ and put it in a pizza box. The directions here seem a little time consuming, lining the pan with foil, flipping the whole thing and straining the marmalade.  I just melt a little apple jelly to brush on mine to make the fruit all shiny. Great recipe!

If I were to do this over, I would start the cookie slices in the middle of the pan and work my way out.  Since this was my first time making it, I now have a lopsided pizza.  Oh well, I am sure it still taste great.

This made a great impression! So easy. I debated rolling the dough out or cutting it into cookies and then laying it in the pizza pan. Cutting the cookies was the way to go. Easier to press the dough together and be sure it will cover the pan evenly. Also pack as much fruit as you can to make it pretty and fruity. I could’ve put more fruit on it and it would’ve looked a bit better. I only had a 14” pizza pan so I added another 4 oz of cream cheese a dash more sugar and vanilla. It looks like you slaved but it’s so easy!

Pretty yummy. I added a splash of heavy cream (whipped cream would work) to the topping to lighten it up.

I did not use the preserves and put on the fruit I wanted in the desired amounts and I baked on a large cookie sheet. Baking time was the same. I also didn’t use foil and just greased the cookie sheet. The rest I followed and oh man was this fabulous! Sooo good!

My first fruit pizza. Turned out great. Decorated it with strawberries, blueberries, and bananas for a 4th of July cookout. It was s big hit. Got rave reviews. First dessert gone!  Will definitely be making again. Can use with all kinds of seasonal fruits!  Thanks for a great recipe.

HUGE hit at work!  I made this for a co-worker's birthday treat who isn't really in to cakes and pies.  She loved it and so did everyone else!  Super easy, looks beautiful, and tastes fantastic.

This was a unique dish for my girlfriend and I to try. It was definitely worth it. This fruit pizza was amazing! The fruits we used were blueberries, strawberries, pineapple, and mandarin oranges. We did everything fresh. Made sure everything was as dry as possible after rinsing. The cream cheese spread was the best part. So delicious! Thanks for sharing.

My husband,who is very picky about eating fruit and my kids loved this recipe.  I actually added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the cream cheese mixture and it turned out good.  Also instead of the break away cookies i just used the sugar cookie roll and flattened it out into a circle. Great snack for kids though!

Awesome, this is the best!  I've made this a couple of times with GREAT reviews.  I have always got requests for the recipe.  Even my 7 year old son made one!
