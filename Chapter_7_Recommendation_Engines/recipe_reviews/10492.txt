This was the only thing I've ever made from here that I have had a problem with.
couldn't get the right consistancy, had to keep adding flour and they lost a lot of taste.

I can't believe these are only rated at 2 1/2 stars. These cookies are different and delicious. My friend and i would make these when we were having a bad day and then give most of them away so we wouldn't eat them all. Everyone loves them. 
The chocolate topping stays soft and gooey all the time because of the shortening. AMAZING!

Very moist cookie. Use Rolled oats. I used quick oats and could not roll them but still was a great cookie. Also used almond bark and drizzled on top.

I have made these cookies for years.  They are perfect for a cookie swap.......they make a lot of cookies and everyone loves them.  I did not change anything.
