I made this recipe several times and had trouble with it from the beginning, but I made a few changes which helped.  1.)Two cups of flour left the dough too sticky for me, so I add about another 1/2 cup through kneading.  2.)I used olive oil to grease my pan and then sprinkled some cornmeal on top of that, then the dough for baking.  3.)This for me was the critical problem for this recipe... Many reviewers recommended partially baking the crust before applying the sauce and other toppings so it doesn't get soggy in the middle. I tried this and it simply didn't work for me. I ended up baking the crust initially for 8 minutes w/o toppings and then with the toppings for an additional 20 and the crust still wasn't done.  Now instead I bake it at 400 degrees without bothering to prebake and I don't have a problem with sogginess in the center. 4.) Also add 1/4 tsp each of garlic powder and basil to the dough, but that is a personal preference and doesn't add or take away from the original recipe as it is good without it.  I also like to pair this with the "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" from this site, which is very, very good.  Will make again, but with my changes.

Turned out wonderful!
I made one with the bread flour, like the recipie calls for, and one with regular flour, (because I ran out of bread flour)did not come out as good with regular flour.

We live in the Chicago suburbs so we are never short of wonderful pizza spots around, which is why I don't think to make my own pizza.  My husband and I loved this pizza last night. I read some but not all of the reviews before making this. Next time I will  try to make it in the morning and giv it more time to rise.  However out of options at dinner time, I did the 30 min rising and although it didn't rise much, I divided it and added flour, well floured the surface and rolled it out.  Luckily we like thin and crispy  and so it turned out great for us.  I also used a pizza pan with holes in the bottom which made it crisp up REALLY nice.  Dough was very tasty.  On the edges it was crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle.  Something I learned from my pizza waitressing days is, even if you like a lot of sauce hold back a bit more than you think. Sauce goes a long way and that may be why some of the reviews are stating that their pizza came out too soggy. I used the Exquisite Pizza Sauce from this site and we loved it!   Thank you for the recipe!

Awesome crust. Even better than the crust I've been making for a while now. 1 cup of water is almost too much for the amount of flour in this recipe. You need to reduce the water or add flour. Very nice cripy outside and very light and fluffy inside. I also added seasoning to the dough and it turned out great.

Yesterday I decided to take a shot at making my own pizza crust. I read many reviews and decided after an 8-5 job this would be my best bet.  SO easy!  I used regular flour.  It came out great!  I added 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp thyme and 2 tsps of italian seasoning.  I'm looking fwd to making again.  Next time I'll do as others suggested and use a pizza stone (need to buy 1) and use corn meal at the bottom of pan.  I'll also let it rise a bit longer and use 3/4 c of water for yeast mixture.  I am so glad that although I didn't do some of these things IT was a HIT!!!  Thank you!

This crust turned out great.  Like other reviewers noted, I had to add a little bit extra flour (maybe 1/4 cup).  Great flavor and texture.

Wow, the crowd's getting tough out there! I'm almost sorry I read yesterdays reviews! Well Phyllis, this had to be, the best pizza dough I've made yet. It was so EASY to work with. Normally I have such a hard time stretching it out, but I had no trouble with this. I used it with the sausage pie I made last night. Terrific and thanks!

I used my bread machine for this recipe.  The dough came out way too soft.  I guess I will need to add more bread flour next time.  I did go ahead and add the flour at the end trying to salvage the dough.  The dough baked up pretty good and the taste was very delicious!  I will definitely try this again with more bread flour.  A very good tasting dough!

This dough was so simple to make and it turned out very nice.  I did add some garlic seasoning to the flour mixture.  My 12 year old loved making her own pizza!

I'm a professional baker, and I LOVE this dough. To get even better flavour I make this in the morning, then cover it and put it in the fridge to rise for dinner. You can also freeze it before letting it rise and then when you use it, it will rise as it thaws.  Thanks Pyllis!

I have used this dough several times and my family loves it!  We get really thick and flavourful crusts every time.  The key seems to be in a few things:   First, I always use bread flour instead of regular all purpose flour as it rises a lot more and we like that thick crust!.    Also, instead of rolling out my crust I just stretch it out and toss it into the air to make it round.  When you roll it a lot of the gas bubbles are lost and that's what helps it rise so much.  On the down side, if you don't pop at least some of those bubbles then your crust will rise VERY unevenly.  My family doesn't mind that, but you can always just knead over the dough with your knuckles on a flat surface to solve the problem.  That should disperse the gas in the dough instead of releasing it.  Another thing to mention is that this recipe is proportioned perfectly if you are using a stand mixer.  If you are kneading by hand you will either need to work the flour in longer or add a little more. You should try not to add more than 1cup more flour to any recipe, or the baking times and end result will be different.  I find that adding 1/4 cup of extra flour is enough if you knead it very thouroughly.  Lastly, I often flavour this dough with dried herbs and spices.  I like Italian seasonings such as rosemary, basil and thyme.  Or, if we do a spicy chicken pizza I will spice it with chili powder, paprika, or chili flakes.  A little nutmeg is awesome in a spicy dough, too.   ENJOY!

My favorite pizza dough of all time! Simple, flavorful and tender. 
I only use all purpose flour and active dry yeast. The key is to thoroughly proof your yeast as the recipe advises. I do so in about 1/2 c. warmwater with the recipe's 2 tsp. white sugar. Then I add more warm water (up to 1/4 c.) as I am mixing the dough, so my total water aded is not more than 3/4 cup (otherwise, this dough requires more flour, more kneading & gets tougher). 
I add spices recommended by another reviewer: 2 tsp. italian seasoning, 1 tsp. thyme & 1 tsp. garlic powder. 
I place the dough it in a greased bowl and let it rise near the oven while it's preheating to 425 deg. I bake my crust on a regular cookie sheet greased with olive oil and springkled with cornmeal and coarse sea salt. Unless I make it a thin crust, I cook the dough for 10 minutes at 425, then add the toppings, reduce the heat to 400 and cook another 10-15 minutes.

This is a very solid recipe. I've used it a few times now and have some notes:  #1: I always put in herbs. Basil, parsely, thyme, oregano, and some garlic powder never hurts. I would highly highly recommend adding something to the dough. It just brings the pizza to a whole other level. #2:I knead by hand for about 7-10 min and let it rest for 45 min-1 hour (it doesn't raise quite as much as I'd like in 30 min.) #3: Put a pizza stone in a 475 degree oven for at least 30 min. before putting pizza in. This seems to help the bottom of my crusts from getting soggy. #4: CRUCIAL: Prepare pizza on floured parchment (NOT WAX) paper. If you can slide it off onto pizza stone, good for you, but I just cut the paper down to fit the pizza and put pizza, paper and all, on pizza stone. (Easier cleanup too.) (if you have a wood pizza board, this probably works just as well, but for those of us who don't, parchment paper works just fine.)

Huge hit!!!! Reviews helped alot.  Have made 50+.  Added 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp Italian Seasoning.  If dough sticks to your hands, add flour, it won’t hurt.  Dough is best worked when left at least 2 hrs.  Cooked dough at 425 for 10 mins, put on toppings and back in for 9 mins.

The four stars are for the fact the recipe doesn't call for enough flour, in my opinion. With the few changes to the recipe I made would have to give it five stars. Having said that this is my new dough recipe for pan pizza. The amount of flour listed did not work. In the end it needed about another half cup or so. Used a stand mixer and after the two cups called for just added flour a little at a time till the dough pulled away and formed a ball. With the extra flour it window paned nicely and was very easy to work with. I baked it at 425 deg on a pizza stone until the cheese and edge was nice and browned. My personal preference is for a more well done pizza, if I can use that term. Also added half tsp. Garlic Powder and Italian Seasonings to the dough, another personal preference. Had no problem with the center being under cooked or doughy but I think the stone really helps with that. Cut off about a quarter of the dough since there was more than enough for the size of my stone and used the extra for bread sticks on a smaller stone.  Next plan on using this recipe for Calzone, think it will work really well.

I have never made homemade dough before and this was really easy! I did take the advice of some of the other reviews and added an additional 1/4 cup of bread flour to the mixture. (It was too sticky without it). I brushed the sides of the bowl with a little olive oil, covered and let rise for the 30 minutes and it rised nicely. My friend that has made pizza dough before suggested that I bake the pizza crust before adding the toppings so it wouldn't get too soggy. After reading some of the other reviews about having that problem, I decided to give it a try and it worked out great. I let the crust cook until it just started to brown slightly on top (apprx 13 min) and then added the sauce and toppings and put it back in the oven until the cheese was melted. This made for a really good crust.  After dinner my husband told me to definately keep making the pizza crust instead of buying it. It was a hit!

Excellent! I read all of the negative reviews prior to making it. I figured out that most of those who gave negative reviews was because they either did not follow the directions or they did not use common sense when the dough was too gooey. Therefore, I don't think it was fair that they gave negative reviews over   something they did wrong. The dough did come out gooey for initially however, I added flour as needed, when I was kneading the dough. Also, I baked it at 375 rather than 350 degrees for 25 minutes. Pizza is absolutely perfect!!!! Will make it again.

Like many other reviews have noted, i needed about an extra 1/3 to 1/2 cup flour.  I did use bread flour and had good results.  I would use this recipe again, made a nice, tender crust, not too thick or thin.

I have made this over and over. Great recipe! I add 2 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp Italian seasoning to the dough. I can see how the dough might be too sticky if using in a food processor. I make by hand and kneed about 10 times on a floured board. It is perfect every time.

Very tasty!!!!! Halfway during the baking process I brushed garlic butter around the edges and sprinkled parmesan over the garlic butter. This recipe is a keeper for me.

I'm sure the failure of my pizza dough was somethign I did but not sure how. I followed the directions step by step and I even cooked for 15 minutes longer and the dough was soagy tasting and never seemed to fully cook underneath of the toppings? So I'm not sure if I would try this again myself.

I added a teaspoon of Mrs. Dash Original Blend and a tsp of Oregano. Other than that I didn't change a thing. I worked it all together with my hands and maybe added a tbls of flour and tbls of oil as I kneaded and shaped the round. The critical step is proofing the yeast and never be in a rush with any type of bread. Be gentle and work all the ingredients with your palms. The same thing after the rest, patience and gentle working it into your desired shape. This the perfect crust. Bakes well, slightly chewy, not to bready, excellent flavor and texture. Enjoy the simplicity of the ancient ritual of bread making.

Not entirely bad, but the dough was too moist (pourable, literally) and the pizza was soggy-ish in the middle.  I followed the recipe as stated.  I would make again, but with more flour.

Excellent dough.  I was a little dubious abt it at first because it was so sticky, but I coated the bowl w/a Tbs of olive oil, rolled the dough ball to cover and let it rise.  Made an easy to manipulate soft dough that translated into a delicious crust.  I'll use again.

I've used this recipe a few times, but today was the first time it turned out great. I usually get it going a couple hours before dinner, but today I made the dough in the morning. I used the dough setting on my bread machine and then wrapped in plastic wrap. I placed it in the fridge for about 6 hours. I took the dough out of the fridge about an hour  before baking so it had time to relax and puff in the pans. I only have cake pans--I greased with olive oit and sprinkled them with fine cornmeal. This really made a difference from the times when I haven't done so as the bottoms turned a nice golden brown and the cornmeal gave it a pizzeria texture. Also wanted to mention that I added basil and garlic powder to taste before mixing/kneading. Yield: two 9" and one 9" X 13" pizzas.

This was a very tasty pizza dough.  Very soft and velvety and easy to work with.  I did have to add more flour but it had a great taste and texture and the family loved it! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!  I will be making this one again and again!!

This was a great recipe. I see lots of people mentioning how it was not enough flour. With almost every pizza dough I have made it is never enough flour in the initial ingredients. I think that is a good thing though. This way it leaves you with plenty of room to add flour while you are kneading it. If we dumped all the flour in at once, it would be impossibly hard to knead and get perfect. I think 2 cups is great to start with, then I just add handfuls as I am kneading until the dough is smooth and not too sticky. I also proof my yeast first with 1/4c water, 1tsp of the sugar, and the yeast. For 10 minutes till frothy, then add to the flour and salt. I do the cornmeal on the bottom of the pan too. Makes it taste more like restaurant pizza. :)

Great recipe ..!! You really don't need to add flour to this recipe in fact a tad bit more water would make it even better....  I guess the reviewers who are complaining that they needed to add flour don't realize that true pizza dough is supposed to be a high hydration dough. My personal pizza dough recipe is even higher in hydration then this one. Normally I do an 85 percent hydration dough for pizza. I guess I really can't fault the reviewers who are complaining about needing to add flour as working with high hydration doughs requires skill that can only come with experience working with high hydration doughs. So if at your skill level if you need to add flour to make this dough then that an acceptable solution.  Just don't fault the recipe for your personal lack of skill working with high hydration pizza doughs.

Leavening for a mere 30 minutes will never result in a great pizza. If you want to make great pizza with minimal effort you should use Jim Lehey's no-knead pizza recipe, which requires an 18-hour rise.

You also can't cook pizza at 350 degrees, period. Keep in mind that the best pizza ovens can reach 800 degrees! I use my oven's highest setting- 550 degrees. Even without a pizza stone I get a crisp and bubbly crust and perfectly cooked toppings.

This was an amazing recipe! I cooked it twice! The first time we broke the dough into two small pizzas and the second time we doubled the recipe and made four personal pizzas, with leftovers in the morning! I highly recommend this  A little tip for a really nice thick end crust; roll the ends underneath just a little for a nice chewy substance... but not too thick or it wont cook

Wow!  I've been using the Jay's Signature dough from this site for years and thought it was the best, but once I tried this one there's no going back!  I gave it a shot this weekend with the chicken pesto pizza recipe from this site, baked it for about 30 minutes at 400 degrees and it was perfect- golden, chewy, not bready at all.  Will use this recipe from now on- thanks!

I've only attempted to make pizza dough a couple of times, but this was the best!  Better than any pizzeria I've bought dough from and I couldn't believe how well it turned out.  I ended up using close to 3 cups of flour, otherwise it would have been too sticky like other reviewers said. I just used all-purpose, not bread flour.  I let mine rise a little over an hour and it at least doubled in size.  I sprinkled a little cornmeal on my pizza stone first and poked holes all over the dough with a fork.  I baked it at 400 for 10 mins, then added my toppings and baked another 10 or so.  Perfect thick crust...chewy with a little crisp.  This is a keeper.

A really good standard recipe.  I always use a little semolina flour in my dough though. 

Just a note for this and most pizza dough recipes - if you don't want a deep dish style, bread-like crust you need to keep adding more flour and roll the dough out as thin as possible.  It's not about the recipe, it's the technique.

This was the best pizza dough I have ever made.  I did take some of the suggestions and modified the recipe a bit.  I used all purpose flour for a soft bread like consistency and conola oil instead of olive oil. I used 1/2C water, then added more water little by little to get the consistency that I wanted from the dough. I used a pizza stone, preheated, with corn meal on the stone. I also baked it at 475 degrees for 12-15 min. depending on the toppings.  I tripled the recipe which worked great, and fed a croud of people. The men said that it was best pizza they had ever tasted.

This recipe turns out great once you add an extra cup of flour to the dough. If you can get that part right the dough is very nice and bakes up thin and crisp (on a pizza stone). I omitted the sugar because I don't think it is necessary in a pizza crust. And if you eliminate the sugar you only need 1/2 t. of salt. There are recipes out there with much better proportions....
Bake the pizza at 375 by the way, pizza won't bake in 20 minutes at 350.

Although it is possible that I did do something wrong in making this dough, I feel that I followed the instructions closely and did not get the desired results.  The crust was undercooked, even after baking longer than the time recommended, and quite bland.  I would not use this recipe again.

This dough was excellent.  It had just the right amount of sweetness. (you can also substitute honey for the sugar) I preheated a pizza stone in a 500 degree oven, and then placed the dough on the stone, topped it with a little bit of olive oil, some crushed tomatoes, mushrooms, oregano, rosemary, sliced tomatoes, and mozzarella and baked it at 500 for about 12 minutes.  the result was phenomenal.  i was glad that i invited friends over for dinner - it made me look good!  thanks for sharing!

These measurements make a great pizza! However, I hate it when people rate a recipe on what it comes out as after they make changes.
Follow the measurements and all of the steps. When you start working with your dough it will be really sticky and that's okay. Knead it a few times using as much flour as you need, but if you're kneading for over a minute then you've already done too much. 
At this point I find that this dough is best if you can let it rest on the counter for another hour or so while the oven preheats at 425. Yes, 425. I have no idea where this guy got 350 from, but 350 is wrong, wrong, wrong. My dough would never cook at 350. After about 40 minutes on a well preheated pizza stone my cheese would be brown and the pizza dough still half raw!
The key to a great pizza is a HOT oven and a HOT stone so really let them preheat! After your dough is rested and your oven and stone are HOT flatten the dough and be sure it's well floured on both sides, transfer it to your stone (I fold the dough into quarters then unfold it on the stone) and add your toppings quickly. 
At 425 your pizza will be done in about 20 minutes. This recipe gets 3 stars because 350 is a horrible temperature.

Bread flour folks -- the recipe calls for "bread flour". If you use regular old white flour then it's not fair to review the crust as not rising properly or saying it's thin and crispy crust. This crust was nearly 2 INCHES THICK when I made it using King Arthur bread flour and grocery store brand yeast. I doubled the recipe and made it in a jelly roll/sheet pan bakery style. You also need to be aware that most yeast packages say to add a teaspoon or so of sugar to help proof it. That's in addition to the sugar called for in the recipe. Getting the water temp right for your yeast is crucial as well. Our crust was fluffy and thick and wonderful. SO easy. Used the bread proofing button on my oven which heats to 100 degrees for 30 minutes -- just covered the bowl with a towel & popped in the oven to rise. Worked beautifully -- more than doubled in size. Next time will experiment with adding herbs and garlic to crust. Don't forget the bread flour!

One of the best dough recipes I've found. I used the entire 1 cup water, and put half the sugar in with yeast to proof before adding to dry ingredients. Dough needs to be nice & soft to get the crispest crust. If you really want a super crispy crust, turn your oven up to at least 475 or as high as it will go, bake on  a stone or pizza pan, and put on the highest rack in your oven so reflected heat will crisp and brown the top as well as bottom. I also brushed olive oil on crust and sprinkled with coarse salt and dried herbs before spreading with sauce. Mmmmm good!!

Great pizza dough, for better tasting dough  wrap the dough in saran wrap and put in the fridge for at least an hour or overnight. I always add Italian seasoning to my dough with some garlic. When baking the pizza your oven should be on the highest setting, I bake mine at 550 degrees for about 12 minutes. Comes out awesome.

It was very easy to make, but the baking part is lacking proper instructions. I ended up baking 40 minutes and still the dough would not cook completely. Next time I am pre-baking the dough for about 10 min. maybe. Will update my review then according to the results.

This pizza crust was so good! I didnt bother to let the yeast sit for 10 minutes, I just mixed everything together and let it rise for 20 minutes. I baked it on my pizza stone with sauce, cheese, and toppings--my husband was so impressed, and he is picky!

This crust tasted really good and was very easy to make, but it fell apart when I cut out the slices.  Had to eat the pizza with a knife and fork.

The only recipe I use..don't need to go anywhere else...as other reviews say:need to add flour during kneading to make it less sticky which is intuitive, I think, when an dough is sticky:)

turned out great! A little thicker than I expected in a large, rectangular pan, but cooked up well.  I needed at least 1/2 C more flour than directed.  I added some seasonings (parmeasan, garlic salt, italian seasoning) to the crust.  Generously oiled the pan and prebaked the crust for about 10 min. at 375 (I always do this) then cooked the pizza with toppings for 12-15 minutes longer, the crust turned out great, browned on the bottom, cooked all the way through.  Just a little thicker than I wanted.  Also only had normal flour to use, turned out fine

Oh my word! Awesome recipe, I did, however tweak a few things after reading the reviews.  I used 2/3 cups water, added 1 tsp of dried oregano, 1 tsp dried basil, and 1 tsp dried italian seasoning mix to the dry ingredients.  I let the dough rise in a 200 degree oven for 30 minutes then rolled out and pre-cooked the dough for 5 minutes in a 350 degree oven.  I stuffed the crust then baked it for 25 minutes (15 then checked it and added another 10) after using spaghetti sauce, cheese and fresh basil.  Dough came out so soft, and light, and cooked throughout.  Yumm

I made this the other day while working from home. I didn't have bread flour so used regular flour. I did find it sticky, but put in an oiled bowl, covered with plastic wrap and put in cold oven with the oven light on-that keeps it warm as it rises. I probably left it in there longer than 30 min because I couldn't get to it right away...then I gently punched it down and let it rise again, until I was able to get to it to make the pizza. I heated a pizza stone in 450 degree oven, made up the pizza on a corn meal covered pizza paddle (using pesto, tomato sauce, mushrooms, blk olives, artichokes, roasted peppers). It was the lightest pizza crust I have ever had....my husband, who never eats crust edges, gobbled up every crumb. And it was so easy, especially when made in a kitchen aid mixer.

The proportions are terrible in this recipe.  I had to add LOTS of flour to not get a very mushy consistency.  I am appalled by the number of positive reviews that had to change the recipe a good recipe should work well with the listed ingredients.  Big thumbs down.

This is a wonderful recipe to use as a base! I did have to make some changes. First when dissolving the yeast, I suggest adding 1 tsp white sugar. I'm also not a huge olive oil fan (for cooking) and used sunflower oil in place. This I feel gives the dough a much lighter, crispier flavor. To give the dough a little more flavor I would also suggest adding an italian herb blend (garlic, basil, a little rosemary). The recipe says to "beat well", but what I would do is just use your hands throughout the entire process and knead it in the bowl until a stiff dough forms, then turn out onto a flat surface and knead for a couple more minutes before placing the dough in a lightly oiled bowl for 1/2 hour.   The cooking temperature was a little off, too. I baked mine at 400º for 15 minutes. Depending on your oven it may need more time, but 15 minutes was all it needed in my oven. The result was a crispy crust with a soft inside. I use this recipe with my modifications every time I make pizza! Thank you for posting this! =)

Very versatile, basic and easy to make crust.  I use 2 1/2 cups flour and add King Arthur Pizza dough seasoning along with some garlic powder.  Comes out same every time which to me means the recipe works.

I have made this recipe 4 times now, and it has been good every time. The last time I made it, I added 1 t of white sugar to the yeast and water mixture, and the dough came out even better than before. My husband said he likes it better than any of the pizza places we would typically order from. Thank you for sharing!

I tried this last night and it was a disaster. 30 min was not enough time for the dough to rise. I baked the crust first for about 5 min and then added toppings because I hate when the crust gets soggy, and the crust wouldn't bake through. I left the pizza in for over 40 min and the dough was still raw & soggy. .

I was very impressed with this recipe. While preparing the dough, I preheat my oven just for a minute or 2 (at 200 degrees, turned it off and then put the dough in. Perfect place for it to rise. I just shaped it with my hands, and put string cheese pieces on the edge to make my own stuffed crust pizza. Very good. This is the recipe I will use from now on.

This recipe has ruined my dinner twice now. The first time I thought it was the yeast, so made sure to buy new yeast and ferment it properly. The second time it turned out soupy with not much help from added flour. After being cooked for almost twice the recommended time it was soggy throughout. I do NOT recommend this recipe unless soggy pizza is your thing.

I LOVE this recipe - so quick & easy but I changed it a little. I like my dough to have flavor so I added garlic, & lots of italian seasonings, i also used Splenda instead of white sugar, added 2 extra Tbs of flour & it came out amazing! The extra leftovers were awesome for bread rolls & used with dipping oils, enjoy & thanks for the great recipe!

I really enjoyed this crust!  My husband thought that it should be crispier, but I liked it soft (and I was the one making it :) ).  I added 2 T of sugar instead though, which gave it a great flavor.

I used this recipe this evening. It was my first time making pizza dough, and it turned out wonderfully. The texture is perfect.

The only thing I did differently was cook it at 425F for 15 minutes. It cooked fully in that time without being overdone.

Thanks for this. :)

Very good dough! The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was very good but kind of soggy in the center.  Now I bake it for 10 minutes first then add the toppings and bake until its done and it's perfect.

Quite good! I was out of bread flour, so I used unbleached flour and made a double batch (we like thick crust). I could have cooked it for a few minutes longer to reduce the doughiness, but my family loved it anyway. I added several pinches Italian seasonings before mixing the dough together (for flavor and looks). Goes great with the "Exquisite Pizza Sauce" recipe on this site!

Very nice dough. I added tyme, oragano and basil to the dough to for added taste. I used instant yeast and it works just as well. Husband said we don't have to go out for pizza anymore!!

I have made this twice now and YUMMY! I will offer some advice. The flour definitely needs to be increased. So while my dough mixes I add about 1/2c to 1 cup more so it will not be so liquidy/sticky. The longer it rises the better! Second time I let it rise 2 hours and it seemed to triple in size! I also punch it down. It also helps to coat your pan/surface with olive oil and flour. I use a basic glass cup to help me roll it out. Before I top it I brush olive oil all around. I have to add the dough is still pretty sticky after rising so use extra flour on it and on your hands. Bakes nicely at 450 for 20 minutes, could do 15 minutes just depends on personal dough preference. I do absolutely love this recipe! Makes a thin center and nice big crust that can be used as bread sticks!

UPDATE: Made this at 10am and put in the fridge overnight and it still worked beautifully! The dough had some hard spots but the cold really tamed it! I did not need to use as much flour to roll it out, which it rolled extremely easily! Cooked for 20 minutes and did not really need to be, 15 may have been fine as it came out a little browner. But the taste..still YUMMY!!

I'm just starting out making my own breads and doughs. This recipe seemed easy enough and I had all the ingredients on hand. I followed some of the reviews and used 3/4c warm water for my yeast, and let it rise about 45-50 minutes (since I had the time to let it) I have to say at 30 minutes, it wasn't doubled, but at 45 is was a pretty close to doubled and was nice and fluffy. It was super sticky when it was first mixed, but a little less after rising. I made sure to flour the board and my hands pretty good and sprinkled some on while kneading it into a ball. It rolled out nice and smoothly (my first good expricence with rolling out dough) and made a nice round XL pie. Pre cooked it for 10mins, then baked with toppings for 20-25. I also added some herbs to the dough to give it more flavor (how we like it)
the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it's a super thick crust. rolled it out to 1/4in and it rose to about a 1/2-3/4in in the oven. I might try dividing the dough and using some as breadsticks next time I use it!

Very soft pizza crust - more like a roll than bread.  Tripled the recipe for 2 large baking sheets of pizza.  Worked in about 1/4 cup flour per recipe before shaping.  Cooked at 400F.  The edge portions were fantastic but towards the center it lacked the strength to hold the piece.  Will make again but will try adding a tad more flour.

I've made this pizza dough lots of times now, and all I can say is awesome. One change I've made and use consistently at this point is I use 1/2 whole wheat bread flour and 1/2 all purpose flour. With this half and half mix of flours I usually end up using almost 1 cup of each exactly. I also add 1 tsp or so of dried rosemary along with the flours, and I knead my dough for 4 minutes or so before letting it rise. Best part is this dough freezes fantastic! I usually double the recipe and stick half in the freezer before allowing it to rise. Pop it out, allow it to thaw and it does the rising at the same time. Best baking time in my oven (after way too much experimentation) is 5 minutes at 425, followed by 20 minutes at 400. If you let the pizza cool for 5 minutes on a rack before serving it'll be nice and crispy and firm enough to handle the heaviest of toppings. Thanks so much for the stellar recipe!

I like this recipe! It's so easy and turns out great, even with regular flour. The first time I made it I floured the bottom of the baking sheet... Too floury. This time I used corn meal at the bottom. Turned out great! Recommend having a little bowl of flour near by to help with the stickiness, but not to take away too much of the moisture. Yum!! Our new, cost efficient pizza alternative!

Oh and in lieu of rolling I just put the ball on the pan and stretch/press it out with my hands. It's too wet to roll. Doesn't always turn out round, but works better than having to deal with a sticky mess:)

This was a great, and fast dough with little ingredients.  I am new to baking, so I've been finding Rapid Rise yeast gets a good rise every time, for every bread. Works great for this recipe when youre in a rush and dont have time to wait. I added more flour which wasnt a big deal. Just keep 1/2 cup at hand just in case. I also added spices to the water/yeast mixture which turned out great! 
I also upped the oven temp to 400 and baked the dough alone in the pan for about 5 minutes before adding the toppings.....I do this for ALL my pizza dough recipes.

While I found the dough to be a bit difficult to work with, the flavor is excellent!  I will definitely be using this again and probably just work in a little more flour next time.

I loved the end result of this pizza dough.  I thought it was better than most pizza places close by us.  I had to add quite a bit of additional flour to the recipe to get it to be the right consistency.  The crunch of the crust was amazing and the fluffiness and texture of the crust was fantastic.

I followed the directions for this dough with the exception of:

7/8 cup of warm water
1 Tablespoon of Onion Powder
1 Tablespoon of Italian Seasoning
Dash of Garlic Powder

I put the yeast and water in my big Kitchenaid mixer bowl.  After 10 minutes I added the rest of the ingredients and then mixed with the paddle for about two minutes on the two lowest speed settings.  After that I let it sit covered for 30 minutes.

I am cooking on a 13" nonstick pizza pan in a Breville countertop convection oven.  I put two table spoons of bread flour on the pan and kneaded most of that into the dough which was very elastic.  I then used my small pizza roller to form it into the pan while the over was preheated to 400 degrees.  This is a dense dough and it took some work to get it formed nicely.

I baked the crust on the middle rack without convection for 10 minutes until it has a nice golden brown color.  After a few minutes in the oven the crust started to bubble, so I used a fork to poke holes and press the dough back onto the pan.  If the dough isn't contacting the pan then it can't get crispy.  I then removed and let it rest for a few minutes prior to putting toppings on it.

I put minimal sauce and the rest of my toppings on the pizza then put it back in the oven for another 10 minutes at 400 degrees.

What I got was a good tasting dough which was CRISPY on the bottom and not soggy at all.  Very easy recipe and I will make it again.  Keep the water content down and prebake!

I cut mozzarella sticks in half and made mine a stuffed crust. (Which was a REALLY good idea!) If it's too sticky, obviously add enough flour until its workable. That's what I did and it was fantastic. Adding and keeping it in my recipe box!

If you like a thick crust, maybe you'll like this one. Used Hovis brand Strong Bread Flour (imported from the UK.) Added a little more flour, kneaded it after an hour and let it rise again for 20 minutes or so. Cooked to a nice, golden brown on a cookie sheet. Brushed the crust with EVOO for a nice presentation. Good!

A perfect pizza dough! Like other reviewers I made my own changes: use 1 tablespoon of brown sugar instead of 2 teaspoons white sugar and cooked the pizza at 450 degrees.  Thumbs up from the whole family!

this was a really good pizza dough  recipe:)I made it topped with Ragu pizza sauce, fresh baby spinach, baby portabella mushrooms, and all mozzarella cheese, delicious!  but, I found that this worked better if you knead it two-five times, to make it springy and easier to bring it all into a round, and then let rise for another 20 min. It then gets really stretchy, and it makes a nice fluffy crust :)

Made three batches of this dough for a pizza making party the other night. Turned out fabulous, but I did take some of the advice and altered a few things. 

First, I felt that 2 tablespoons of olive oil was simply too much, so I reduced it to one. 
I also didn't feel that 30 minutes to rise was NEARLY enough, so I let my batches rise for about 3 hours. Turned out perfect. 

This is an excellent base recipe and so simple to make, I would suggest it to anyone. Thanks, Phyllis!

I have made pizza dough in the past and I think the key to this recipe turning out well is making sure you use bread flour. I used it to make stromboli and it was great! Sprinkled itailian seasoning on top for extra flavor.

fabulous dough!  mixed in kitchen aid with dough hook for about five minutes, until dough started crawling up the hook.  added some rosemary to taste. let rise for an hour.  let proof for 20 minutes after forming & before using.  brushed dough with olive oil before adding ingredients.

This was delicious! I quadrupled the recipe (I have a large family) so we could make 4 pizzas. It was a little overkill.... they turned out to be 4 thick pizzas. Luckily, we all like thick pizza crusts... but next time, I'll just triple the recipe for 4 pizzas. Definitely worth a little effort (although for a yeast dough, it's super easy)!

I followed the directions EXACTLY and it did not work at all.  It was way too sticky to do anything with.  I tried adding a bit more flour, but that didn't work either.  Really disappointed.

Very good dough.  Unlike most yeast pizza doughs I've tried, it does not taste sweet and it is easy to stretch thin.  This is my new fav recipe, for sure.

I used to work in a pizza parlor and have to say this is the closest I've come to the same type of dough used. I let it rise for a long time to make deep dish pizza and I love making individual pizzas with my family. It lets everyone pick what they want on theirs. Really easy and fun!

Just made this and added some seasoning. It came out awesome! Even though it seems wet at first adding in extra flour during the kneading process ensures that you dont over flour and wind up with too dense a crust. Excellent recipe!

Pretty good pizza dough, I did make this the lazy way by throwing all the ingredients into the bread machine and letting that do the work.  i cooked the dough on my baking stone for 5 minutes before adding the toppings.  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe was quick and easy.  But, if you want to be the dough to be anything worth working with you need to add at least 1 cup more of flour. It took 1 hr to double in size and was very soggy after being cooked for 20 minutes. OK recipe probably won't use again.

Loved this dough !  I did let it rise a little (maybe a half hour), I used the dough hook for my mixer, so it really wasn't sticky, I did use a little flour for the counter for kneading and rolling it out.  It wasn't soggy at all, I par baked it for ten minutes then topped with cheese and baked it for 10 minutes more.  The kids gobbled it up !  this is one for my recipe box !

Decent pizza dough. I've not tried a ton of recipes, but it was easy enough to make and work with. Still, whether the cook or the recipe was at fault, it was not the best I've ever had. Thus the 4 stars.

Increase the flour to 2 1/2 cups and bake (with toppings on it) for 20 minutes at 400 and you'll be pleased with what you get. We also let it rise a little longer.

This recipe is a keeper! Excellent results even though I used all purpose flour. I found it was necessary to use two and a half cups of flour as suggested in other reviews. I also added the olive oil after mixing all the other ingredients.

Awesome recipe!  I will use this one again and again.  I live in pizza town, and to have the economy tank and still get to have pizza is a godsend!  Maybe not as good as the Italian restarants in the woodburning ovens, but still yummy!  Very easy - try it!  Mmmmmmmm. . .

I did not like this dough. I spent a couple of years working at an award winning pizzeria,so maybe that's why my bar is set so high. The dough felt over-proofed even though I didn't let it rise longer than recommended. When I tossed the dough it tore very easily. Also, it stuck to my pizza stone.
From other reviews it seems like people aren't tossing and stone firing their pizza. This just isn't the right dough for that.

Very good.  I didn't have bread flour on hand, so used all-purpose.  Added some italian seasoning and garlic powder. Added more flour, as it was too sticky without added flour. Turned on oven to 200, then turned off.  Put dough in turned off oven for about 40 minutes.  Dough just about doubled. Had no problems rolling out on floured counter and rolling pin.  Put dough on pizza pan that has the little holes already in the pan.  Then put some fork holes throughout the dough and prebaked for 10 minutes at 400 degrees. Pulled out of oven and then added sauce, pepperoni and cheese.  Put back in oven to brown.  Pizza dough had a great taste.  Was not crispy, but the taste made up for the difference.  A pizza stone would probably make a crispier crust.  Used Easy Pizza Sauce I from this site.  It was a good combination.

The dough is okay.  But it took another half cup of flour or so just to make the dough workable!  It was a nasty sticky mess before i did that.

I was incredibly happy with the dough. Texture was great, with a suprisingly good flavor. I suggest starting the dough in your bread machine.This way you can slam the ingredients together and sit back and watch some TV.

Dough can be made ahead and stored in the fridge in a ziplock. I had no problems taking it directly from the fridge and slamming it into the oven.

Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

The only thing I'll add is... you know how when you roll pizza dough out, it keeps creeping back and not staying where you rolled it? Don't use flour, use olive oil! Just a few tbsp will do. It defies logic, but the oil actually keeps the dough from slipping back. It's delicious and SO much easier.
Have fun!

One of the best pizza dough recipes I've ever found! It does require some extra flour. But it's easy and quick--even for my little siblings or cooking-challenged boyfriend. Makes a slightly sweet, fluffy, soft, delicious crust! For the reviewers  who said it it didn't rise--check your yeast first. It's not a recipe problem.

Had to add a little extra flour while in the mixer to get the velvet like texture.  Also brushed a little oil and oregano around the edge to make a nice golden crust.  Exceptional.

This dough is truly the best I've ever had- AMAZING! It makes a large pizza with generous crust, which I've used for making a 'stuffed crust' twice. I just found this recipe two weeks ago and I've made it four times already. My husband asks for pizza now every time I ask what he wants for dinner. I just bought some whole wheat dough today and will be trying it 100% whole wheat next time. We're both anxious to see how this healthier twist on an already fabulous recipe turns out.

looked like real crust and tasted like pizza shop crust.  wonderful!!! used allpurpose flour instead of bread flour because in the past bread flour has created more of a thick foccaccia style crust,  too fluffy for the kids.
EXCELLENT AND QUICK RECIPE FOR PIZZA DOUGH!!!

I've tried several other doughs on this site, and this one is the best that I've come across.  It's so easy to work with and it rises quite well.  I made it tonight using 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 of white-- still tasty!  I also like to add an extra teaspoon of olive oil.

This recipe was fantastic! I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup unbleached all-purpose. I also added about 1 tsp of rosemary and put this in my breadmaker's pizza dough cycle. It was simple and delicious!!

I think this recipe is great!  I do only use 3/4 cup of water and pre-cook the dough at 450 degrees .  I also add oregano and garlic to the dough mixture for extra flavor.

This is the first time I've made my own pizza crust, and was a bit skeptical.  One taste, though, and now I'm a believer!  It was like a "boboli" type crust, which my family loved.  I'm going to make a double batch and bake and freeze for future use.  I'm also going to do as another poster stated earlier, and make break sticks with this recipe.

Fast, easy and delicious.  Did also use more flour, about 1/2 cup more.  Just kept adding while I kneaded it.  Smooth as silk.  Perhaps a tad more sugar or salt?  I'm not sure, but chewy lovely crust, tender and DEEEEEElicious!
Thank you

Excellent pizza crust. I used my Kitchen Aid to knead the dough and proofed the yeast with the water and sugar. It took about a 1/4 cup more flour to come together but it was a damp day and from past experience humidity can make a huge difference in the amount of flour needed. When I first looked at this recipe I questioned why the yeast was measured in weight and the flour wasn't. A quick calculation determined that I needed  1 1/2 tsp of yeast.  I let it rise in the oven with the light on for an hour, rolled it out and placed it on a perforated pizza pan. Back into the oven for a second rise and removed it after 1/2 hour. I preheated the oven to 400 with a pizza stone. I baked it for about 25 minutes and it was excellent. Thanks for the great recipe Phyllis. I will be using this one again.

I needed to add about 1/2 cup more flour because it was too wet. Crust was pretty thick.  I think doubling the recipe will cover 3 pizzas pretty well

Super easy! I'm no pro, but it turned out fan-fuggin-tastic.  I followed the instructions. But used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 all purpose flour in place of the bread flour. I let mine rise for about 1 hour.   Next time I'll use bread flour, because I like my dough a little chewier.

This crust turned out great! I have used it several times, and each time I've loved it. I didn't add any extra flour, and actually watered my hands to help incorporate the dough. I like my dough to be a little damp as it rises, and then when I'm rolling it out I add plenty of flour on top to help roll it out. So easy and delicious!

The water to flour ratio is wrong - this dough is way to wet & sticky.  I'm not sure why people gave the recipe 5 stars then stated in their comments that they had to add more flour.  The recipe, as is, is a one-star recipe.

I LOVED this crust. It was thick and bready and delicious. My husband however is more of a thin crust lover and didn't like it as much. So take that into mind. Definitely add 1/4-1/2 cup more flour, but with any bread recipe its always better to start with less flour and add more since you can't take any way!

The best and easiest homemade Pizza dough I've found. The dough came out a little soft. I simply rolled it in a little of the bread flour and voila. Perfection. Thanks for sharing it.

The key to an evenly-baked pizza is the temperature at which it is baked.  Preheat your oven to 500 deg.  Yes, 500.  Once the oven is ready, pop the pizza in on the middle rack and drop the heat to 475.  Cook for 8-10 minutes (keep close watch) and it will rock!  **To keep the dough from absorbing too much sauce, take a tablespoon of butter and spread it thinly over the bare dough.  Then add the sauce.  Works great.  Overall good recipe for dough.  Thanks and have fun experimenting.  :)

My pizza was doughy after 20 minutes; I even cooked it at 425 degrees; I used a pizza pan with holes in the bottom.  I tried taking it off the pan and placing it directly on the oven rack at about 15 minutes in hopes of getting a crispy bottom, only to have part of my pizza fall through the grids. I cooked according to the recipe and didn't add the extra flour other suggested.  I felt this recipe was bland and tasted like flour.

This is the most perfect pizza dough recipe.  I have made many in the past.  This was the easiest to work with, kept it's form very well, and cooked to perfection.  After I mixed the exact ingredients, I use more bread flour as needed so it wouldn't stick to my hands when I kneaded the dough.   I did let it rise for 2 - 3 hours and it rolled out great.  It made for an excellent pizza.

This crust was really delicious! I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I did have to make some adjustments. As other reviewers stated, you're definitely going to need to add more flour! I didn't measure it, but it was quite a bit more (just add until no longer super sticky). I also added garlic powder, oregano, and basil to the crust. I cooked the crust only at 425 for 10 minutes, added sauce and toppings and then cooked for another 10 minutes. Would definitely make again with these adjustments!

I thought this was a good easy recipe.  I let the bread rise for an hour, that was the only change I made. If you find the flavor lacking, all you have to do is add some of your favorite seasonings to it. I think I might do that next time, but either way this is a good basic pizza dough recipe.

very delicious! 
I also added 1tsp. parsley, 1tsp garlic powder, 1tsp. complete seasoning.  
The only other thing I would change would be to bake the crust for 10minutes, then add all the toppings and sauce etc, and bake it again.  We found that the crust was a little soggy, and when we heated it up the second time in our toaster oven, it was just perfect - slightly crispy crust, but soft inside still! sooo good!

This was an excellent pizza dough, I did however add 1 cup bread flour and the other cup whoke wheat flour, and also bake it for 10 minutes prior to adding the toppings to ensure it was cooked right through. Next time I make this I will add seasonings and try it as a thin crust. Definately a keeper! Thanks

GREAT recipe and very easy!  I did adjust the oven temperature to 375 but I have an older oven.  Some others mentioned having soggy dough.  I used 3 cups of "00" flour and exactly 1 cup of warm water.  When I activated the yeast in a separate bowl I did so with some of the water from the 1 cup I had set aside.  I did not use additional water and my dough was perfect.  It was not at all soggy.  I also use a pizza pan that has holes at the bottom for a crispier crust.  If you use exactly one cup of warm water you won't have a soggy crust. I baked crust first for 7 mins then added my toppings and then baked another 8 mins. or so.  I will use this recipe over and over. It was perfect. I may even try adding some spices as others did.

I was hoping for great things but wish I had read the reviews more closely.  The oven needs to be hotter, and it needs more flour.  Turned out really doughy and nasty.  I'm sure it's a part my problem or altitude but this just didn't work for me.

I'd give it a half a star if that were an option. We haven't eaten it yet but it was so sticky I had to add nearly an extra cup of flour and it's still really soft - hard to work with.

I agree with most reviewers; you need to either add more flour or only use 3/4 cup water. Love this recipe, we use it most Friday nights!  After mixing all ingredients I usually let sit on counter for an hour or two. Then I just plop it on to my pizza pan, spread it out with we fingers then put sauce and toppings on and bake at 425 degrees. Comes out thick but crispy on the bottom.  Yum every time!!

I didn't use bread flour, just regular flour.  It was sticky and not very stretchy, but it rolled out with a heavy rolling pin very well.

the taste was good but the dough was so wet it was unmanageable. I added a lot more flour maybe a cup or so. I did not use bread flour. I used white flour with 1 tablespoon gluten in the bottom of the cup for each. I make bread a lot so I thought pizza dough could not be that hard, and I think it would have been easier with a different recipe. I cooked mine at 400 degrees in a hard anodized (preheated on cooktop) pan, not sure about time but more than 20 minutes. crust came out crispy

I have tried to make this recipe 3 times and have yet to get it to work.  It turns out much too sticky and impossible to form.  I have moved on to another recipe that produces a stiffer dough and works wonders.  I am not sure how people that follow the recipe get it to work but more power to them.

Great recipe! Quick and simple, with only 1/2 hour to rise, it doesn't take much longer than delivery ;-) I like to add a little bit (a tsp or so) of garlic powder and onion powder, you can add anything you'd like to enhance this yummy basic recipe! Its our go-to pizza dough :-)

This was the best tasting pizza dough I have ever had! It was a little hard to work with in the start because it was so sticky but I balanced it out with more flour after i let it rise. It was totally worth the work though.

I'm with Toasty Mama. It needed more flour, but it also needed a bit more yeast, seeing as it only expanded enough to feed three people. 

Nonetheless, with the help of my topping ideas, this was delicious! I'll definitely be making it again. :3

Good taste and texture. Had difficutly cooking pizza all the way through. Will modify amount of water to 3/4 cup like others had suggested. But overall this made for yummy pizza. Will try again!

I made this in a pinch, because the one I normally make calls for beer (I was out and it was late).  While I still like my original in the bread maker better.  This was good.  I'm keeping it for a change or if I want to offer a second choice.  I also like the fact that it doesn't have beer for when I do make your own pizzas at kids parties.  I did let it rise again for 15 minutes on the pan, don't know if it helped.  I make two larger individual pizzas and one little one for a five year old.

Great tasting dough, very flavorful, however, I don't know if I missed it in the recipe, but this dough absolutely cannot be made into a thick crust pizza or it will still be raw.  I ended up cooking the sucker for an hour and it was still raw in some places!  I tried it again as a thinner crust and it was excellent!  But do not make a thicker crust pizza with this (or a stuffed crust) as it will still be raw.

No way is 350 for 20 minutes enough. I had it on 400 for 30 min--without too many toppings, too--and it was still pure dough in the middle. you HAVE to prebake this one!!!!! Very frustrated after losing the entire middle of the pizza!

This was the first time I tried this and will definitely make this again. I did use 2 1/4 c of flour, and greased the pizza pan. I also sprinkled some corn meal on the pan. I thought the dough was very easy to handle and made a yummy crust. I did leave it in 5 minutes longer than suggested but I think 20 min is fine. However, I have a gas oven (which everything seems to take longer in there) so I did cook it at 400F instead of the suggested temp.

I followed this exactly, and pressed it into a cookie sheet, topped with my favorites, and served it to guests. Everyone loved it! It was super easy to whip up. I highly recommend this recipe! I hope to get a pizza stone soon to try this recipe with. In a cookie sheet, its super easy and simple, but it doesnt get the crispy edges that I like. But thats just the pan I used. Still yummy tho!

I mixed the yeast with the cup of warm water, and then added a teaspoon of sugar to the yeast mixture and let it sit for 10 minutes until it had doubled in size to 2 cups, then after mixing the dough, I let it rest covered for over an hour. The dough doubled and I was able to make two large pizza crusts from this recipe. I did have to turn the oven up to 375 and bake for 22 minutes. Next time, I think I'll bake at 400.

i love this pizza dough. i picked this recipe because it used bread flour and i perfer the chewier texture of bread that is baked with it. i did add about 1/4 cup more flour but other than that that i changed nothing. all five members of my family from 3 years old to 26 years old were madly in love with the pizza i made with this dough. thanks for the recipe.

I have used this as my base recipe for years now. It's a GREAT easy QUICK pizza crust as it stands. If you want it to be better - it can certainly be spruced up. It will work with combinations of whole wheat/all purpose/pastry flour, but it will require a bit more flour in the kneading process. (eyeball it).Bread flour (higher gluten content)- it really has the right consistency and it's SUPER, but a little less healthy. keep in mind though that it's only 2 cups of flour - which is pretty impressive. I usually use about a tbsp. of instant dry yeast, b/c that's what I have on hand (bought in a big package)- and let it rise as long as possible - an hour is great. The less time it rises - the thinner crust you'll work with - the longer it rises - the bigger thicker crust you'll get. If you are going to make grilled pizza - let it rise for an hour+. I DO ADD various italian spices to spruce it up a little.
I am grateful for this recipe. yes, play with it. Knead it a little longer, add a bit more flour - that's what cooking is all about! But this is the BEST BASE I've found for a good easy and quick pizza dough!!

I pre baked the dough for a few mins and then added my toppings and finished the pizza directly on the bottom rack of the oven. It made a really tasty pizza with a nice crisp crust.

I just made this dough for pizza tonight.  I have to admit, my dough came out sticky, and for some reason, after adding in the extra 1/4 cup of flour, it was still sticky.  So I decided against using as pizza dough and used it to make individual calzones.  It came out great.  The dough baked up so light and flaky, it was delicious!  I will definitely use this recipe again, and use extra flour to use it as pizza dough.  Thanks for a great recipe!

The first time I made this recipe I failed completely.. I had left it in the fridge for a few hours and for some reason it was terrible ( my god I cried). I now realize my three big mistakes : first, the water I used for the yeast was NOT hot enough. I didn't have a thermometer, so I would just use water that seemed "kinda hot", now realizing that humans are at 98.6 degrees and anything slightly higher( lets say 104 degrees) will seem hot. So this time I microwaved the water for a few seconds till it seemed VERY hot ( not UNBEARABLE, just HOT) and perfecto! The yeast dissolved perfectly. I also learned that yeast must always be used at ROOM TEMPERATURE ( something important, because I always store my yeast in the fridge because it lasts longer).
ALSO IMPORTANT: 
If you want to make SURE that the dough cooks completely and not end up wasting a bunch of ingredients ( like I did TWICE) then cook it at 415 degrees, not 350, and cook the dough ALONE .  Put some butter on top to crisp it up and then cook it like that for a while. After, put the toppings on it. This way, if for some reason your dough fails, you don't waste all your ingredients.

Also, oil up your pan before putting some corn meal on it so you don't end up with a sticky pizza.
 I added in some pesto to the dough that I bought from target and some basil and oregano, topped it with ricotta cheese, tomatos, spinach, and artichoke hearts.

this recipe could be good. back off on the water to flour ratio, give a weight instead of volume. I have never heard of cooking pizza at 350F. Turn your oven as high as it can go, 500F 550F, even 600F if it does it. Ideally, you want to have a stone to cook it on, doesn't matter for home cooking. Roll out your dough to however thick you want it, put toppings on, use common sense, don't overload. Bake on/in whatever pan you are cooking with and check it every 10 minutes. Mine are usually done in 10 minutes. If it is nice and golden after 10 minutes, then take it out and let it rest for 5 minutes. If not, cook another 3 minutes. A few minor details to this recipe and I would give it a four or maybe even five star.

Follow this recipe exactly and you cannot go wrong. I agree with other reviewers. I made this with all purpose flour and it was fine. I made it with the bread flour and it was FANTASTIC. WONDERFUL!

I had a lot of trouble with it and had to add more flour.  However, it tasted good after I was finally able to cook it.

I needed a quick and easy dough recipe and I ran across this one. I followed the recipe to the tee... the dough was a bit moist and didn't seem to rise much. The one thing that I did differently was, after rolling out the dough, I placed it in the oven for about 5 mins without any toppings to seal and avoid the dough from not cooking in the center... I use a vegan cheese which is very moist and a lot of sauteed vegetables which can make a very "wet" pizza if the dough doesn't cook properly. All in all, I was pleased with the end result... the texture of the dough was nice. I cooked a bit longer for a crispier crust. I'll make this again but will add some seasoning per another reviewer for more flavor. Thanks... hope this helps! Peace & light.

Great recipe! I did lower the amount of water down to 2/3 of a cup and I used Semolina flour instead of bread flour. The semolina made all the difference!!

I typically mix in some finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes and roasted garlic at the beginning of the kneading process, and have had most excellent luck - even when I accidentally slotted in a second rise and ended up with pizza toppings on a thin focaccia.  This dough is robust enough if well kneaded to do a traditional in-air toss-to-rounding process. I am clumsy enough to land it on my head, but happily the dough is also robust enough to survive that.

The pizza crust itself was really good. My dad said it was "good" but I tend to be really critical of my own cooking ha ha so these are the errors I made   -I should have shredded a blend of Italian cheeses rather than buying a bag of the Italian blend stuff   -I didn't think the sauce was sweet enough so I added a few teaspoons of sugar and I SHOULDN'T have done that.    -I should have done two small individual, thin crust pizza's rather than one large.   -I should have baked the pie plate (not sure what its called, its stone and flat and round) and oiled and seasoned it before laying the dough on top. I think this would have given it a way better crust.   *All in all, the crust recipe was great, I'd definitely recommend it and rather than the advised minutes to let the dough rise, I'd give it a full hour just to be safe!*

I tried this recipe and my son who is a teenager and doesn't like anything homemade, took a first bite and loved it. He asked to make this pizza next time his friends come over!!!! that is a blessing. I love the recipe although next time I would double it to make 2 pies and add to the thickness. One thing I noticed was that the dough needs to sit aside for a longer time to rise than recommended. I will no longer buy frozen pizzas from the store when you can make one at home very easily and the best thing is it is fresh and preservative free. Thanks for posting this recipe and btw this is my favorite site for recipes. All the recipes I tried so far have turned out to be great, can't thank enough.

Great flavour and texture, I had to add like 100grm more of flour as the initial amount turned out very sticky, but that can depend on the brand of the flour ( I used bread flour) The temperature of the oven I needed at 200ºc, For the 30 minute proving I preheated my slowcooker on LOW for 10 mintes  with a wiping of olive oil and then switched it off, the dough was easily double the size after 30 minutes, then I divided it into quarters and made four delicious pizzas with a homemade topping. Thanks a good recipe.

We LOVE this pizza dough at my house and make it about once a week!!  I use all whole wheat four instead of bread flour.  We use a cookie sheet and have found that it works best to grease the sheet well and then top with flour, otherwise the dough gets stuck to the sheet.  I have found it easiest to use my fingers to press out the dough to fit the cookie sheet.  This recipe is sooo easy and amazing!!!

I used this dough for some breakfast calzones. I followed the directions and it turned out really great. I rolled out the dough, then layed out the cheese, egg, and bacon. Then I folded the dough in half, slitting the top so it could breathe. baked @400'f for 15 mins. on a pizza stone. once it was done, i used butter like an egg wash... yum :) my family LOVED them and can't wait till I make em again. Thank you for the recipe!

I made this dough for a Chicken Alfredo Pizza.  I added extra flour (regular since I didn't have bread flour) so it wasn't so sticky, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, and 1/2 teaspoon basil.  I patted it out on a pizza stone with cornmeal.  It's very light and fluffy.  The dough didn't double in size even though I let it sit for about an hour.  I patted it out then let it sit for another 20 minute or so before putting on he toppings and baking.  Slightly undercooked in the center even though the crust was golden browned.  Maybe even a little over cooked on the top.  I'll try a partial pre-bake of the crust next time.

Simple and delicious!!  I wanted to try pizza on the grill and wanted an easy pizza dough recipe. This worked fantastic!! Definately a keeper. I did have to add a couple more tablespoons of flour to get the right consistency to knead but that's no big deal. Thank you!

Needs about 1 cup more flour, and should be kneaded after mixing and before rising.  I will stick with my usual recipe.

The proportions of flour to water are way off on this, resulting in a sticky mess. Also the oven temp is way too low. Other helpful people have posted on how to "fix" this recipe, but why should we have to read through 30 posts to figure it out?

Excellent recipe and easy to remember so I can slam a pizza together in no time. I will only say that pizzas should be cooked on high heat. No professional would ever cook at 375 so I follow their lead. I cook at 550 on the bottom rack. Do not let sauce etc. sit on the pizza- cook immediately. I've never had a soggy crust, just watch it closly and when the underside almost starts to burn yank it out and it will be perfect. I happen to use a perforated pan but a stone is probably even better

I've been using this recipe to make all our pizza's (we don't eat store bought, only homemade) and it's spot on. My kids, hubby and I all love it. I don't pre bake it, I just turn it out, top it, and bake. I've even used wholemeal bread flour and it was fine. with any bread product, if you're having problems at all, then try changing your flour....makes a huge difference with the right flour.

Have been using this recipe for two years now, trying to make it a bit better, original recipe is fine.  Maybe a bit less olive oil.  I ended up buying a pizza stone, that made good pizza even better.  Regular flour works, bread flour is a little better.

This is a great recipe. I roll my dough w a rolling pin and a little extra flour after flatening the dough ball w my hands first on a sheet of aluminum foil that's lightly floured, then I flip it on to my pizza pan wich is sprinkled w cornmeal. Since I can never get any of my recipes posted on here, here's the recipe I use after trying alot of diff methods... I use 4 cups of bread flour, 1 and 1/2 warm water 115F, 2 1/4 tsp of yeast and 1 1/2 salt. I only use a drizzling of olive oil and honey and garlic powder. I use the method of putting the warm water in a bowl then adding yeast to that and I add the honey then. Cover for 10-15 minutes. add flour 1 cup at a time, when I add the first cup, I use a wire wisk and this is when I add the salt, oil and garlic powder. Add the remaining flour 1 cup at a time, mixing w spoon. When you add the fourth cup time to get your hands in there! knead on counter till smooth and stretchy. You might need to add a little more flour, you'll know it's ready when you can make a dough ball w out it sticking to your hands,but make sure it's just enough, not too much! then i put the dough ball in another bowl thats rubbed w olive oil. Let rise for an hour and a half or so. And IDK if it's my oven, but Ihave trouble getting the bottom crispy so I have been baking my pizzas on the bottom rack at 425F and they are turning out perfect! I bake for about 9 minutes.

This is now my fall back pizza dough recipe. As others stated in their reviews, you do need to add more flour than stated in the recipe, I just measure by heaping spoonfuls until it's the desired amount - some days it's dry in my house, sometimes humid so that's a factor. Otherwise, I follow the recipe exactly. When I put the dough in the bowl to rise, I do splash a bit of olive oil in the bowl, turn the dough, then cover with a damp towel and put it in my oven to rise (oven not on obviously). I'd also never make pizza without a pizza stone, so I wouldn't pre-bake the dough after shaping. What I do is heat the stone per stone instructions (basically slap it in the oven while preheating), sprinkle the stone with corn meal, then put the dough down, brush olive oil over the dough BEFORE putting my sauce and toppings on. My crust always comes out perfect and my whole family enjoys pizza night.

Not impressed.  I didn't read all the reviews before hand, and made this according to the recipe.  It definitely came out far too sticky, having to add almost an additional cup of flour, and it could have risen a bit longer.  Maybe I will try some of the suggestions and try it again sometime.

Best pizza dough recipe I have found.  I use 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose.  Add extra wheat until it is a dough consistency.  Let it rise once.  Cook it 10 minutes first, then put ingredients on.  It is great!

This is a good recipe for pizza dough.  It is very close to the one we used in our pizza shop.  The flour/ water portions are a bit off so just be ready to add flour or start with less water.  First time I made a double batch and by the time the dough was to correct consistancy, I probaly added another cup of flour.  No real way to measure because I was adding a tablespoon at a time until the dough pulled away from the sides of bowl onto the dough hook.

Loved it!!  Sooo easy!!  Thick, chewy & tender crust.  I used my kitchenaid w/ the dough hook & mixed it for 15 min.  Added 1/2 c. more flour while it was mixing.  **THE TRICK** to fully cooked dough is to preheat your stone in a 500* oven for 20-30 min.  A hot stone will cook it from both sides AND the high heat will make the cheese chewy like pizzaria, not just melted and watery.  Roll the dough lightly w/ a pin & finish stretching by tossing & shaping w/ the back of your hands.  Assemble the pizza on a flat sheet or pizza peel dusted heavily with cornmeal.   Use a spatula to loosen & carefully transfer it to the hot stone greased with olive oil & cornmeal.  I like fresh made ranch w/chopped garlic for sauce, topped with grilled chicken tossed in bbq sauce, pepperoni, mushrooms, red onion, cooked bacon, mozzarella, parmesan, & a little italian seasoning.  Better than the pizzaria!! Thanks! :o)  **UPDATE**  I made this early and refrigerated the dough right after mixing for 2 hours, then let it come to room temp for 30 min. SOOOO much better!!  The slower rise gave the crust much more flavor (thanks to Alton Brown for the tip)

Forget about cooking this for 20 minutes. The topping was melted just right but the bottom was not cooked, actually it was white after 20 minutes. I think I will take one of your reviews and try all purpose flour and bake the dough for 15 minutes before cooking the rest at 400 degrees.

this turned out great.  I am new to making pizza crust and I did take a few of the others hints and added my own spices.. I also kneaded it once after the first rise and let rise once more before baking it.  It turned out great, nice soft fluffy and thick!!!

Fantastic!  Light, easy to combine with herbs or spices, and simple to make!  I mixed in a healthy amount of Italian seasoning (probably 3 tbsp), some dried minced garlic, a little crushed red pepper. After letting it rise, I rolled it out and cooked it as required.  Delicious!

It's not "the BEST" but it was very good for the time it took to make it. I read a couple reviews before I made it and I cut back to 3/4 c. of water. I set it on top of the stove while it was preheating so it would rise good. I also raised the temp of my oven to 400 degrees & it was done in 20 minutes. I added italian seasoning & garlic powder to it. I didnt have bread flour so i used my self rising flour & it turned out okay. All in all it's pretty good.

Nice recipe for pizza dough and I've tried many.  I love using the bread flour, however I had to use at least 3 cups, maybe more to get it so it wasn't so sticky.  I don't measure the sugar, but I probably use about 1 T. or 2.  I also let it rise about 45-50 min.  Thanks for the recipe!

GREAT recipe to work with, easy to roll out!  Mods: 1/2 c more flour, 1/2 t of garlic powder, dash of basil and italian seasoning. Rolled it out very thin, added toppings and baked at 425 for a thin/crispy crust.  Awesome recipe!

Amazing recipe!  I have used it dozens of times since first trying it out just a few weeks ago!  I've adapted it for my family.  I double the recipe and I just do a little drizzle of olive oil to keep the fat down.  I've used it for pizza, breadsticks, and cheese bread.  We won't be buying take out pizza anymore!  It is so quick and easy!  It has been extremely popular with my friends and family.  It is so easy to stretch! My doubled recipe fills two jelly roll pans.  I cook it at 425...I like a crisp crust!  I'm definitely going to be passing this one along!  Thanks!

This is the one!! I've been searching for a pizza dough recipe that makes a nice, thinner crust, not too doughy, not too bread-like, and this one (finally!)fits the bill. I used my bread machine and a large pizza pan with holes in the bottom. I didn't have to pre-cook it at all and followed the quantities in the recipe exactly. It was perfect! Thanks!

I love the lightness of this dough, it seems easier to work with than most others so I can get it extremely thin for the type of delicious, crisp crust my family enjoys. Thanks for a great recipe!

The kids loved this one. I usually use Pizza Dough II from this site because it freezes well and has wheat flour, but this one was incredibly simple and quick with no kneading and only one rise. We rolled it out onto a cookie sheet and it came out great without pre-baking the crust. I used about 1/2 c more flour than the recipe called for.

This made a nice crust - it's more bready than a pizzeria pizza crust, but still good.  I will pre-bake it next time as others said because of the mushy  middle.  I split the dough to make 2 pizzas but it was too thin - the dough did not rise much in 30 minutes, so next time I will just make one.  I used cornmeal on the pizza stone which made the crust come off easily.  This was great!

This was very good. I had only ever done quick crust before like the box mixes you buy at the store. I used all purpose flour and it turned out okay as far as we could tell. This came out very crispy where I was able to get it thin enough. I did prebake this for about 8 minutes before adding the toppings as other reviewers suggested. I used a Wilton pizza pan that has holes in the bottom and baked this near the bottom of the oven (second position from bottom in my oven) to crisp the bottom crust. I did knead this about 4 times to work in a tiny bit of flour as it seemed a little wet. I will use this one again, it was easy to work with and the directions were simple to follow. This made 1 round 14" crust and could have fit a cookie sheet sized pan easily. Thanks Phyllis for sharing this!

This dough turned out WAY better than "Pizza Dough I" did for us. We didn't have any trouble with the water to flour ratio; we simply followed the recipe carefully and worked the dough by hand (didn't add any additional flour or anything). We did add some rosemary to the dough. This'll be our default pizza dough recipe. Thanks a lot!

This is the first recipe we have gotten from this site we did not care for. The dough was easy to make but was dry and bland. It tasted like cheap pizza from the frozen food section of old.

Yummy. I only had plain flour so I added a couple of teaspoons of bread improver and two teaspoons each of dried parsely, marjorgam and oregano and one teaspoon of garlic powder. I just had to check the bottom of the pizza dough to make sure it didn't burn. Oil your fingers and spread it out over your pan.

this recipe makes a delicious pizza dough! it's light and fluffy but be sure to give it pleanty of time to rise. one recipe is not enough for this family... so i doubled the recipe... and it worked perfectly!  after the dough had risen, i simply divided it to make two pizzas instead of one.  was a hit!

Very good! Liked it much better then the other pizza dough recipes on here. Made a few changes though. I added an extra 2 tablespoons of flour, and 2 tablespoons of Italian seasoning and it was wonderful! Make sure dough isn't sticky though. Mine was until I added the extra flour. Also, the recipe asked to let dough sit for 30 min, well I always learned to let it sit in a warm place, So I let it sit on the open door of my oven while oven preheated. After I changed it up it bit, the texture was awesome (not fluffy like others said,it was definetly crispy)! Will use as my main pizza crust recipe. Thanks

It needs to be cooked at a higher temperature about 425.  I thought it tasted like light fluffy white bread, not crunchy pizza crust.  I won't make again.

I doubled the recipe and prepared it in my stand mixer.  Wonderful light dough, easy to handle, and tasty.  I think it might be a little moist if doing it by hand.

This dough is great.  The first time I made it, I followed the exact directions, but it had too much water.  Now I first put 1/2 cup water, then I keep adding water little by little until the consitency works for me.  I use a pizza stone.  I put some corn meal on the stone to prevent sticking, and it works excellently every time.  It is also very tasty.  I will never buy crusts or pre-mixed doughs again.  Thanks, phyllis.

I followed directions to a "T" and the crust was undercooked and disgusting. Maybe the oven needs to be at a higher temp than what is posted?!?!

Excellent recipe. I used plain flour and it turned out fine. I also used fresh yeast instead of dried (you can substitute in most recipes if you just double the measurement of fresh as compared to dried), but other than that I'd have to say that anyone with serious complaints about this one just didn't follow the directions well! Very simple. True about the extra flour, though I didn't even mix it in, just rolled the dough in plenty after rising and the stickiness became perfectly workable. My new standard pizza dough, thank you for sharing this.

Simple and easy to make with a very good flavor. After rising for an hour the dough was still a little sticky so I added 1/2 C. wheat flour until it was easier to handle and this added some texture. In retrospect, make sure you coat the bowl with a non-stick spray or olive oil (I forgot.)  The oven should be at least 375F (400F might be better) and bake for 20+ minutes depending on your topings and whether you've used it as a thick or thin crust.  I'd make it again.

I have used this recipe a few times, and like it very much.  I substitute half whole wheat flour for one of the white cups of flour for a little nutrition.  It tastes great!  Nutty.  I also use my breadmaker, and find that I need an extra 1/3 cup of either flour, as the machine kneads it much more than one would by hand.  Thanks for the simple and delicious crust recipe, Phyllis!

This tasted ok,  but extra flour had to be added,  and the baking time was definitely not right.  I baked it as instructed and it was very dough-y on the inside.

This recipe is so simple and yet it tastes wonderful.  We made two individual pizzas from the recipe and cooked each on our pizza stone (preheated to 425°F) for about 8-10 min each.  Delicious!

My old recipe had to be kneaded for 15 minutes with an electric mixer.  When my hand mixer blew up, I decided to look for a new recipe!  This recipe was very good, it's nice and soft and I could get two pies from the original recipe.  I didn't even use an electric mixer!  Thank you so much for this recipe, it is our new version!

I add the sugar when activating the yeast but other than that small change followed the recipe.  I think the oven temperature is too low when you consider real pizza ovens run at 700-800 F. I use a pizza stone and max out the temperature in my oven (550 F).

I used this for calzones, and it was fabulous!!  Crispy outside and a light, chewy inside,  my kids raved about it for 2 days, even posting pics on Instagram and Snapchat, lol!  I did let the dough rise for 2 hours,  and used AP flour, otherwise followed the recipe.  HIGHLY recommend !

I made couple substitutions came ok. This dough turns out just a little too sticky. Went with "Toasty Mama" suggestions and turned out good. Now instead I bake it at 400 degrees without bothering to prebake and I don't have a problem with sogginess in the center. 4.) Also add 1/4 tsp each of garlic powder and basil to the dough, but that is a personal preference. Two cups of flour left the dough too sticky for me, so I add about another 1/2 cup through kneading. Also added teaspoon of garlic

I added 1 tsp of garlic powder and 1 tsp of dry oregano. I used quick rise instant dry yeast which I added to the dry ingredients and then mixed in 3/4  cup (1 cup was too much for two cups of flour) of very hot water. The dough ballooned three times it's size in just two hours. Oh, I used regular all purpose flour. The pizza crust turned out nice and crispy, not thick and chewy.

This dough is fantastic.  Using the bread flower is a great substitute for flower.  Our cul-de-sac all got together one weekend and we made pizzas.  Everyone loved the taste and texture of the crust and it was wonderful.  I am no longer allowed to order or buy pizza.  I have to make this. It's awesome that it's easy and fast and the kids get to make their own creations. Thanks for the submission.

Awesome pizza crust. It was the best I have made. I used King Author all purpose flour and cooked it at 450 degrees as recommended by another recipe I like, made into pizza shape on a piece of parchment paper that had been sprayed with Pam and sprinkled with corn meal which was recommended by another recipe. Dough was easy to work with although my mixer with the dough beaters did most of the work. Also, I greased the top of the dough before I let it rise. Some of my steps probably were not necessary but it turned our great!

I modified the recipe a bit as I've used it before. I used 3 cups of flour instead of 2, added to the recipe 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and 1/4 baking soda on top of the instant rising yeast. Besides the 1 cup of water I added 2 tablespoons more water and used a bread maker to make the dough. This time I added fine herbs and garlic to see how it turns out. I always pre-bake the crust and slighting stir fry  the topings (onions, peppers, olives, salami/pepperoni and mushrooms) as my family likes them well cooked and have used different kinds of pasta sauce. I use a pizza round pan with a little oil and it always turns out excellent.

I find that it turns out better if you use 3/4 cup of water instead of a whole cup and cold water instead of warm. It will take longer to rise the dough. I typically make it in the morning and let it rise all day. I also add some seasonings to it just to give it a little something extra.

The dough is toon sticky. Even with a ton of cornmeal it sticks to the peel. I would recommend a different recepie that doesn't create sticky dough.

I add garlic powder and italian to the crust, and let it rise for at least 1 hour before pressing it into a pan.  Is delicious!

I doubled it, made it in my Kitchenaid stand mixer and used olive oil that we've infused with garlic. We then used three cake pans to make individual deep-dish pizzas, although I think next time I'll blind bake them for 5-10 minutes then add the toppings, we used fresh beefsteak tomatoes, cheese and sauce, the popped a few pieces of pepperoni on top

Love this recipe! I use bread flour like the recipe calls for and all purpose flour for kneading. Flouring the cook surface keeps the dough from sticking in the oven. I divide the dough into personal pizzas & cook on an oven safe plate. Successfully divided the dough into 5 pizzas. Easily could make 6 personal sized pizzas.

I am stuck doing pizza for my family every other day now!! it's easy and fast. I did use an extra 1/2 cup of flour through the kneading. also an extra spoon of sugar gives it a better flavor. as for the crust I melted some butter and added garlic powder. pour that on the crust.. it was delicious! recommend it

This recipe worked great with my stand mixer.

First, I doubled the recipe and added the flour and salt to the mixer with a paddle attachment. I added the sugar and olive oil with warm water and yeast before adding it to the mixer. It mixes up sticky and will need about 1/2 cup more flour (like other reviewers have mentioned) but this is perfect because you can switch to a dough hook and then add the extra flour. 

I did precook the crusts at 350 for 15 minutes on parchment paper on a pizza sheet pan (I have no pizza stone). Then I removed the crusts and added toppings, then cooked directly on the oven rack for 15 minutes at 400. This gets the crust nice and crispy.

If you wrap the pizzas well right after adding toppings, they are freezer ready and can be cooked just like a frozen pizza (425 for 20 minutes). 

Awesome recipe! :)

This is the best pizza dough i've made so far. I didn't make any changes to the ingrdients but I did knead the dough after rising about 10-15 times. This is the closest homemade crust to the nice soft crust you get from your neighborhood pizza joint. I love how simple it is too.

Just made this pizza dough recipe and it's very good - will definitely be a go to recipe. I mixed by hand and added just a bit more flour as I was forming the ball. I did a cold fermentation in the refrigerator overnight for a breakfast pizza. Oven 525 with a stone and a bit of cornmeal on peel. Was the easiest dough to roll out that I have ever made. Baked up beautifully and everyone enjoyed.

I might of forgotten to leave a comment on this recipe but it's by far, the best. The dough tastes just right. I even had to substitute syrup for sugar this time but either way. It turns out wonderful. Fyi, the syrup gives the dough this breakfast taste.

Loved this recipe! The dough was sticky but when cooked was nice and fluffy. I made this dough and the other "Pizza Dough I" recipe and compared them. I didn't like the Pizza Dough 1 recipe at all. Because the yeast didn't dissolve or rise it resulted in a very thick, weighty, crust with not a lot of flavor. This recipe had the nice taste of yeast in it and just an all around great dough taste! I will stick with this one and throw out the other one!

I've tried many pizza dough recipes and so far this one is the best. It makes a soft, chewy dough (quite sticky before baking) that I have found makes excellent rolls as well. Try rolling dough balls in a mixture of melted butter, dried parsley, Italian seasonings, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt.  Put dredged dough balls in a cake pan,  sprinkle on a generous amount if Parmesan, and allow to rise before baking until golden. Your family will thank you.... And most likely shower you with compliments like "you're the bestest cooker" and "you're the greatest mommy!"

As A Chef, this is an average recipe. While making this, I began by following the recipe to the T. When i added the flour to the water it was very very sticky. I recommend revising the recipe and say 3 cups flour instead of 2. At least say start with 2 cups and be prepared to add more, so it isn't misleading. After the getting the proper amount of flour and getting the dough to the right consistency, the dough turned out great. Like some people said it was a little plain but, with adding some herbs and spices it could be one of the better doughs I have had. For the people worried about it being soupy, I made it out to be a regular crust not a thin crust and cooked it at 375 for 20 minutes, then pulled it out and let it stand for 5 minutes. It all depends on how much sauce you use. If you don't overdo it, the pizza should come out perfect.

Just tried it for the first time yesterday and I am sharing it with everyone I know who makes their own pizza.  So quick and easy and I got the thin crust I have always wanted.  I can toss all my other recipes because this is my keeper now.  I had this and that and the other hanging around in the fridge so it was a kitchen sink pizza and scrumptious!  (canned pizza sauce, mozzarella, parmesan, goat cheese, onions, bacon, pepperoni, cherry tomato halves). Going to make more later today!

I made a taco pizza using hot sauce vs tomato and used all the left overs from fiesta night, beans rice and ground beef mixed together topped with leftover cubed cheese from a relish tray, and baked it for said time. Then I topped it off with onions lettus and shredded cheese. Trying to be creative for my husband when he comes home for lunch but didnt realize that the dought took about forty minutes to make and set until I had already started the yeast so he didnt get to have any. I hope its still here when he gets home cause its goooooood!

This is the first pizza dough recipe I've tried that has successfully withstood my penchant for overloading toppings. For me, pizza isn't primarily about the dough, it's about what's on it! 

I took some of the suggestions and covered my pizza pan in cornmeal, then baked the dough for 5 minutes before adding toppings. I also used half whole wheat flour, just because I always do.

After I cooled and sliced it, I was amazed at how it didn't stick or fall apart, like so many of my pizzas usually do. I was actually able to eat my pizza as finger food. Will definitely use this recipe for all my pizzas going forward!

This is a great recipe. I made the pizza crust according to instructions except I used instant yeast, and added a teaspoon each of garlic powder and Italian blend. I added flour as needed to reduce stickiness of dough. I also used my KA mixer to knead for 5 minutes. Rolled the crust out thin on a vented crust pan, precooked until lightly browned before adding a light covering of sauce,  pepperoni, black olives, and sautéed onions and mushrooms. Topped it off with mazzarella and a sprinkle of italian blend. Mmm mm good. I had a little dough left over so I placed it in an oiled Baggie in the fridge. The next day, I let the dough rest on the counter to room temperature, then kneaded by hand for a couple of minutes. Shaped into two rolls, placed on a cookie sheet prepared with corn meal. Brushed with olive oil, sprinkled lightly with Italian blend, and after sitting a few minutes, I brushed the tops with ice cold water. Baked in a 415 degree oven for about 15 minutes. Omg, the rolls were awesome! Used with  leftover pot roast for sandwiches. Tonight I made more dough, only this time it will be used to make rolls as needed this week. This is a keeper. Quick and easy for a dough recipe.

I never have a problem with this recipe.  Not sure what all the negative complaints are about.  Only 1 major thing I change. . . the temp that it is baked at.  My son worked for a big pizza bakery and the always bake at 500 degrees.  I bake at 500 for 8 minutes then 8 minutes at 350.  Perfect every time!

After mixing up the dough and then reading the reviews (I decided to read the bad ones first) I got a little scared that my dinner could end up in a disaster. After I then found out that I somewhat had to substitute the tomato sauce, because I didn't have any in my pantry, I got creative and added my toppings and baked it at 200°C for about 20 minutes. Many reviews stated that it was too much water to the flour, I cannot confirm that, I did exactly like asked for in the recipe. I gave the dough a good knead (as a yeast dough should always get)before baking and then let it rise for about 30 minutes. It had doubled and I loved the texture of the dough. I found it easy too handle as well. Depending on how you like your crust you can decide on how thick you roll it out. Mine raised while baking to about double as I had it rolled out. I will try this recipe again and probably modify the dough with seasonings. One thing I have to agree on with the other reviewers is that the temperature is too low. That's why I decided to give it only a 4 Star rating.

This pizza dough is truly the best homemade dough i have tried.  I have been trying different ones over the past ten years or so.  It was easy to make with just my hands since i don't have a mixer.  I only kneaded for about five minutes.  It was soft and the outside was crisp.  It even held up against fresh cut tomatoes which can cause your dough to be under done.  I would highly recomend this dough to everyone!! :) MMM MMM  good!

Best homemade pizza we've had!! Big part in due to this crust recipe. Crispy on the outside, and a little chewy on the inside. (No pizza stone required!!) Used the recipe exactly as stated, except I put a couple shakes of garlic powder in it.

This was easy to make, my family decimated that pie in 2 hours! I think the trick is not to overwork the dough. Just proof the yeast, mix all the ingredients, let it rise, roll it out, top, bake. Nice and quick, thanks for the recipe!

i can tell from the recipe without trying it that it will turn out great BUT!!!!!!

- 350degr is ***way too low*** for pizza.  pizza is normally cooked anywhere from 400 to 450, depending on your oven and your pan (stone/no stone, perforated pan, dark non-stick/shiny aluminum, etc).

- if the dough is sticky, keep working it.  the longer you work the dough, the more the flour will absorb the water.  it can take a good 15 minutes to get the dough properly kneaded.  the more flour you add to the dough, the harder, tougher, and drier the final product will be.  try leaving the dough as is and keep on kneading until it is elastic and feels "alive" when you prod it.  that will give you a tender crust that bakes up crunchy on the outside.

addendum:  i just made the recipe as-is and i was right - the dough turned out absolutely perfect with enough working.

I used a high gluten flour and it was perfect. High gluten is what the majority of pizza bakers use because of the elasticity. Very easy and very good.

Have found the perfect pizza dough.  The bread flour really makes all the difference. Now we can pick up a slice and eat it. All crusts I've made before weren't sturdy enough to do this.  Tastes great too. Thanks for the recipe. Will be used often.

This is a really good basic recipe. Very tasty. But there is one glaring error. It should read 3 cups of flour not 2. I have made it now 3 times and it is a hit with kids and adults alike. I topped one with tomato slices and basil leaves drizzled with a little olive oil and kosher salt/cracked black pepper. There was none left for lunch the next day. Try it for sure but be ready with that third cup of flour.

Excellent. I used more flour than anticipated. I split the dough into 8 balls and made naan/ Indian bread in a pan on my stove. Incredible. My kids and husband devoured them

i started putting in 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp rosemary, 1 tsp thyme, and 2 tsps oregano.  Love this recipe, very easy, very delicious.  This is the best crust my family has ever had and makes the best pizza in the world.

The dough was king of hard to handle, after it grew, because it was too sticky. Even that, the flavour and the texture were perfect. I´ll definitely try it again and again. Thanks.

Iv used many recipes and made so much food, and normally they never come out perfect but this was just awesome. I put a little bit of sugar in the yeast water let it sit for about 10 mins, while I mixed the other ingredients, and slowly poured in the yeast mixture. I added some Italian seasonings, and let it sit for about 45 mins. Usually an hour to over night is best with any bread dough, but 45 mins was perfect. Punch it down and roll it out! Good tip: lightly cover your pizza pan with evoo. ( extra virgin olive oil) then sprinkle with cornmeal, only a little but all over pan..Then put your dough on top of pan when ready to make. Add sauce cheese and toppings, and cook for 20-25 mins. I melted a little butter and mixed some garlic powder, brush it on crust when you take the pizza out.. Mmmmmm so good! Best dough ever!!

Great basic recipe -- Next time I will need to double it--- way to small.   I so need to grocery shop and this is a fast life saver. Topped with half jar sauce, half bag frozen sliced peppers onions, mozzarella & parm. Yummy.  I used cornmeal on sheet tray instead of spray.

Love it !  Only thing I do differently is I do not wait for the yeast and water to get creamy.  I found this to make the dough turn out watery and a thinner crust than I like.  I add the yeast to the water and dissolve then add this to all the other ingerdiants, stir and let rise for an hour.  This gives the crust a thicker quality

Best Pizza Dough Recipe I have ever tried. This was my first time making  a Pizza Dough without the aid of my bread machine. Just kneaded for about 4 mins and placed in a glass bowl greased with olive oil. Very easy, and very basic recipe, could be adapted and "fancified" with a few simple spice additions. Try it!

It came out a little stickier than I would like, but it's nothing that a little extra flour can't handle. Overall delicious and very easy

SOO DELICIOUS! And simple! Made this with my two year old for lunch with just sauce, mozza and old cheddar cheese on it, he gobbled it up! Light and fluffy crust which was crispy on the bottom unlike other floppy crusts I've made. I followed the recipe exactly (2 tsp of yeast) with normal flour and it was a bit sticky but a quick dust of flour was all mine needed. DEFINITELY will make again! Yum!

Just tried to make this dough and was really disappointed.  Made it to the exact proportions listed and came out with really sticky dough.  And, it didn't rise.  I've had trouble with yeast before, so I went to the trouble of buying new yeast (which won't expire for another 2 years!) for this recipe, and it still didn't rise.  I realize this probably isn't the fault of the recipe, but we had higher expectations.

Used this recipe as a starting point.  I substituted 3/4 cup of semolina flour and 1 1/4 cup a.p. flour for the bread flour.  The dough was sticky so I added an additional 1/4 to 1/2 cup of a.p. flour.  I added some Italian seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder for extra flavor.  I pre-baked the pizza crust for 10 min. at 350 degrees, topped the pizza with my favorite toppings, and returned to the oven at 400 degrees for 12-15 min.  Turned out great!

This was great! I have always hated the flimsy pizza crust I get when I make homemade pizza (we like to load on the toppings!) but this recipe was the perfect pizza crust! 
The only change I had to make was I added extra flour because the dough was so sticky. I also added some herbs (dash of garlic, thyme & oregano) but thats my personal preference for a pizza dough.

Yummy dough, but man was it frustrating to work with!  Calling it sticky was an understatement!  My fingers were so hopelessly glued together I had to have my husband put a LOT more flour on the counter so I could try to knead it.  I had to read quite a bit of the reviews to figure out how to have this be successful, and in my opinion, if I have to look that hard, the recipe is missing some tips or information, or not written clearly.  I was relieved that the end result was good, but I don't think I feel up to the trial and error right now to get this right.  Moving on to more straight forward pizza dough recipe...

Turned out great. I cooked the pizza a 375 for 30minutes and it could have cooked a little longer, but it was done all the way through.  I also melted some butter with garlic salt and brushed it on the crust.  I did need to add just a little more flour than the recipe called for to make the dough less sticky. Make sure to use bread flour. I used all purpose flour the second time I used this recipie and the crust was not very good. Awsome crust if you use bread flour. 0.25 oz  = 2 1/4 teaspoons of yeast

I make artisan pizza and flatbead ahead of time and keep in my refrigerator for up to 2 weeks to make pizza. This dough is very good in comparison. And I love how quick it was to make. I knew to add more flour right away, and used almost 1/12 more cups. I used fresh mozz. and asiago cheese, fresh mushrooms and pepperoni. I also noticed that this a good crust to stuff with cheese if you want. Thanks so much for posting!

The taste? very good. The prep? Not so much. I followed the instructions perfectly, but my dough came out very gooey, too gooey to work with. I had to add flour, like many other reviewers had to do. I might make it again, but I will have to adjust the proportions. Maybe 1/2 to 3/4 cup water, instead, while increasing the flour to 2.5 to 3 cups... aghh... disappointing. I mean, to see so many perfect reviews. This recipe is NOT perfect.

The dough turned out soft and perfect! I would recommend this recipie! I did substitute vegetable oil for the olive oil as its a bit lighter. We have our own family recipie which i couldn't find and found that this version of dough was just as easy to work with and turned out very similar to our family recipie.

This needed a lot more flour than the recipe called for. I wound up using an extra cup and it wasn't enough.
it also needed to be baked in a much hotter oven in order to cook through.

This dough was perfect!!! I did use a little more flour, but just to handle it while I was touching it. I also used actual bread flour and I think that made a big difference!!! VERY, VERY YUMMY!!! Thank you!

OK recipe, I agree with Toasty Mama's suggestions, but my cooking technique goes for science, not tradition. I use Canola Oil instead of Olive Oil in the recipe, and spray the finished pizza lightly with a high quality Greek Olive Oil when served. Olive Oil is at best a low temp to medium temp oil. In these temperatures the aromatics of Olive Oil is gone and it degrades. I bake at 400 degrees.

Husband really liked the dough but I thought it was ok. Quite sticky so I add a little bit more bread flour. Easy to follow recipe, easy to make dough, and was easy to roll out. Made 1 16 in pizza and it turned out pretty thick.

Cook at 400 degrees and pre-heat the pizza stone.  Use corn meal to keep from sticking.  Other changes:  used 3/4 cup water and added 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp thyme and 2 tsps of italian seasoning as suggested by another.  Delicious!!

This recipe didn't work for me. Like Toasty Mama said, she had to add a 1/2 cup more of flour. On top of that it didn't rise a single bit either.

It was a little sticky so I used another 1/2 cup flour. Also, I only used 1 tsp sugar.  I used it to make both the bbq chicken recipe and the salsa chicken recipe. The dough came out nice both times. When I got to step 2, I added it all to my food processor with the dough kneeding blade. Very handy.

Delish! Made this in the bread machine, oiled a 1/4 sheet pan with wesson oil, spread out the dough, added some hm sauce, sprinkled mozzarella cheese, cooked at 500 for 20 min. And enjoyed a perfect pizza!
Thank you!

We love this recipe!  FYI, .25 ounces = 2 & 1/4 teaspoons.  I have a jar of yeast, instead of packages, so I had to get the conversion. :)

This tasted okay. I liked the fact that it is pretty quick to make up. However, I found the dough texture too soft. I was looking for more of a crispy or chewy crust. I was trying to find a crust that didn't have sugar in it, and realized after I started making it that this one had sugar in it. It tends to make a softer crust. It did make for quick meal tonight. It took about 30 minutes to bake in the oven.

I've been looking for the perfect pizza dough and still haven't found it. However, this is the best one I've tried so far (and I've tried several). I will keep tweaking this one and hopefully make it perfect for my family since this is the best start I have. Thanks for sharing.

I just loved this pizza dough recipe. I used bread flour which makes a great difference in the taste and texture of the crust. I did have to add a little extra flour at the end because the dough was really sticky but just enough to roll it out on the pan. Then I brushed a little extra olive oil on the crust to give it that crispy texture. I can't wait to make it again.

Perfect and easy. I didn't have any olive oil so I substituted vegetable oil and only used 3/4 cup water based on previous reviews.

Great dough recipe.  I doubled it to make a few calzones.  I added the water a little at a time to get the consistancy right.  used it the next day right out of the frige after kneading a bit first.  This one is going into my recipe box to use again.

I have made this dough half a dozen times, and I think I can say with confidence that you REALLY NEED to add between 1/4 - 1/2 cup of extra bread flour. Without the extra flour, the dough comes out very soupy and hard to work with. Once I add the extra flour, it looks much more like dough and is awesome.  I have used both instant yeast and active dry yeast and have noticed no difference, as well.  Hope this helps!

I've tried this recipe a few times. Keep forgetting to note on my paper that this needs more flour. 

The recipe as is is really soft and sticky before it rises. The dough itself is great though! I like the texture and taste. It's also great with added flavorings like garlic. I'm going to make some garlic bread sticks out of this.

Also I dont know if its me and my not so good pizza dough skills, but this seems to rise quite a bit while cooking. It gets really puffy if you dont get this thinned out.

I use a 12 in pizza stone and even with about 2/3 of the dough(it got thin in a few places in the middle) it still rose quite a bit. 
It's not a huge problem for me because I like thick crust, but I thought it worth mentioning.

Thanks for the recipe.  Finally found one that fits the bill.  I did use less water (3/4 cup and a few extra sprinkles of flour) and cut the dough in half and froze it for next time since I prefer thin crust.  It made a 14 inch thin crust pizza (using an air bake pan with holes on bottom) and was strong enough to handle all my toppings.  Hubby said,  "You can sell that!"  Broccoli slaw(good filler, I saute mine first with mushroom and onion) is great topped with any leftover meat.  
Thanks so much!!!  Added to my favorite tried tested and true recipe keepers.

Very easy and turned out great!  I added extra flour, and baked on a pizza pan with holes in the bottom.  It was soft and chewy, a hint of sweetness, with a crusty outside and crisp bottom.  Next time I think I will mix some seasonings, garlic, and parmesan into the crust to give it a little zip.  I'm not a wonderful cook, just ok, but this turned out great for me!

I cook a lot.  I don't think I'm very good at it and
that is why I love this recipe.  This has got to be
my most requested recipe when I make it.  It's so
simple, even I can't mess it up.   I make bread sticks with it too and my boys love it!  My tips are not to thin it out too much.  Also, brushing it with butter gives it a good flavor.  You can also make the dough ahead of time and just leave it in the fridge, then bake it up later.  I've left it for about
3 days one time and it was just as good.  I also like sprinkling it with a garlic spread.  My boys like to dip it in Prego.  You can't go wrong with this one!  Thank you!

GREAT recipe! I baked the crust alone for 6 min to ensure the center wouldn't be too doughy. I had to bake the entire pizza about 30 min to crisp the crust. This is a keeper.

Absolutely delicious!  I have a boy with multiple food allergies, including an allergy to cheese.  I HAD to have a great recipe for pizza dough as his introduction to pizza.  This is that dough.  I did exactly as instructed, and cooked it on a stone bar pan.  The crust was PERFECT!  Thank you so much!:)

Not bad. I had to bake at 375 degrees for 25 mins and it was still a little soggy in the middle. Next time I'll try going 30 mins and see if it is any crispier. 

Update**I bought a grocery store deli pizza dough the next night after fixing this and the deli one was much better than this recipe. I probably won't make this recipe again.

I have been using this regularly for a few months now. works really well, crispy on the edges and bottom and just slightly sweet. I like to put a bit of dried basil in the dough, and some cornmeal on the pan before I bake it. thanks!!!

Delicious! I added an extra 3/4 cups flour and let it rise for an hour. The dough was perfect, easy to work with, nice and fluffy. Also added about 2 tbsp Herbs de Provence which added lovely flavour. We will certainly be using this recipe again. Thank-you Phyllis!

This was a pretty good pizza recipe after a few twitches. I made it in my kitchen aid mixer with a dough hook. I had to add about 1/4 cup more flour. i kneaded it in the machine for about 5 minutes. Let it rise for 1 1/2 hours. rolled it out, put in on my pan then let it rise again for 1/2 hour. the results were great! light fluffy dough that blew my mind!!

Turned out perfectly! The only change I made was adding a tiny bit of the sugar into the yeast. Fantastically light and crisp on the outside.

This is a wonderful pizza dough.  I have tried several different ones on this site and this is the first one that actually had the right texture.  I did have to add a bit more flour.  It is very easy to handle and shape.  This is now the family favorite and we will make homemade pizza a lot more often now!!

WAY too much water. (Actually, the instructions never said to add the water to the flour mixture but I had not trouble figuring that out.) I had to guess how much more flour to add. It made me unsettled, but it all worked out fine, and the crust was good!

This is a pretty good dough but I agree with the many other users that it definitely needs more flour. I made calzones for the first time using this dough and they came out quite well. I'll definitely be making this dough again

Awesome dough and incredibly easy to make.  I had no problems with sogginess in the middle. I did bake at 400 for 10 min and then 350 for 15 minutes so a little longer than suggested but it turned out great.

This is my go to pizza dough recipe.  I have used it for pizza a few times, but mostly use it to make stromboli.  I end up using a bit more flour, probably close to an extra 1/4 cup and I also throw in some extra seasoning.  About 1 tsp each of basil, oregano, italian seasoning and then a few dashes of crushed red pepper.  My husband says it is the best stromboli ever.  We haven't gotten stromboli from the local pizza place since!

This recipe was absolutely fabulous!  A crispy outside, with a perfectly fluffy and delicious inside.  We had to add 1/4 to 1/2 cup extra flour, and added a bit of basil, oregano, thyme and garlic to the dry ingredients. FABULOUS!  The leftover dough made for excellent breadsticks!

Maybe I did something wrong, but the flour/liquid ratio in this recipe seems way off: I had to add a bunch more flour to get a gluten frame forming. Turned out well in the end though.

This recipe is great! I add some herbs and spices to it as well, make two medium sized crusts, and cook for about 10 min at 400. They're so delicious. Reheated in the toaster oven the next day, just crisp on the bottom, somehow they're even better! Thanks :)

The reviews don't lie! This really is easy and delicious! I think I expected the dough to rise more than it did, but it didn't seem to matter in the end. I mixed by hand and split the dough in half for a thin-ish, medium sized pizza. I didn't parbake the crust or use a pizza stone (just a cookie sheet) and the crust turned out perfectly. I think I might try half whole wheat flour next time or maybe experiment with seasoning the bread. Thanks for the great recipe!

I make this dough at least once a month and it's one of my "go to" recipes. I have always used all purpose flour and sometimes use 1 cup white and 1 cup wheat. Other reviewers are correct that you will need an additional couple of tablespoons of flour or it will be too sticky. I also bake the crust for about 10 minutes with just the sauce on it and then add my toppings. It always turns out great!

this was my first ever successful yeast dough, and the "pizza connoisseur" in the house is already chomping at the bit for me to make more. the dog was ravenous for the pizza bones, and even the picky toddler ate with gusto!  i did proof the yeast  as per the directions in the article on this site, and added a little Parmesan cheese to the dry ingredients before mixing.    one thing not mentioned that i feel i should have done more, is poke the crust a bazillion times with a fork all the way through before topping and baking to give it that "thin in the middle thick fluffy crust" that you think of when you imagine pizza.   this was a great recipe, thanks!

This dough came out great.  Followed recipe exactly (exceped used a flavored olive oil) and baked on a pizza stone.  Crispy and chewy with good flavor.  Tasted so good that my mom who usually leaves the crust in the box stole mine while I was eating my piece.

I've never done homemade pizza so I was worried, but this stuff turned out FANTASTIC!  I did two batches and put some whole wheat flour in one and that turned out to be my favorite :)  Great recipe!

I also added 1 tsp of garlic powder to flavor the crust and 1 tsp of gluten (I think it's by the flour in the grocery store).  Pizza crust turned out awesome.  I split the dough in half and made two thin crust pizza's.  I had to cook them about an extra 10 minutes to cook the dough in the middle though.  Might have just been my oven though.  The dough raised nicely in a covered bowl sitting in warm water in the sink.

Very easy to make and an awesome crust for the middle of the week when the full-on kneading and rising process might not be an option.  The compromise is that the crust is relatively one-dimensional, it is somewhat crunchy but not crunchy and chewy all in one bite.

Added a bit more flour (bread flour) but otherwise followed exactly and the pizza turned out great!!  Next time we'll experiment and add seasonings to the dough like garlic.  It's not necessary though, this is a great dough recipe.

Grill it!  I have saved this recipe to my iPhone and utilize it a lot- thank u!  My husband loves grilling.  Brush both sides with olive oil and throw on oiled grill.(divide recipe into quarters)  Flip and apply toppings.  We are trying to refrigerate the dough first tonight, but have put it directly on grill from the rising point.  It Works.  The dough falls between the grill slats and makes wonderful grooves.  Happy grilling!

It's good, it came out like a thin crust. A little crusty on the outside and soft in the inside. Really easy to make.

Great recipe with these tweaks: I prefer to use 2 teaspoons of oil not tablespoons. It is too much oil for the flour content. Bake at 405 degrees for 22 minutes with two teaspoons of oil and it will come out perfect. Be generous with flour when rolling the dough. Do not kneed after it rises (I made pizza and dough at a high quality pizza resturaunt for a year)....Contadina pizza sauce is great stuff that rivals professional sauce. A sprinkle of "italian seasoning" will further enhance the sauce. Professionally we kneed dough 2 minutes in a mixer. I don't bother kneeding at home and it comes out great. A good thorough mixing is enough...enjoy....

I made this recipe and found that I had to add another cup of flour in order to make the dough less sticky and properly cook. I also made a modification by putting about two table spoons of pizza seasoning (mixture of oregano, basil, marjoram, and grain garlic) in the dough. This gave the dough an interesting look compared to traditional white crust and also added flavor to it. I used this recipe to make a white pizza and it was delicious.

Always delicious! Its the best when it is fresh, which takes some time to let it rise. I have frozen it and used it later, but it is too dense if it is not room temp when u roll it out. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Mild flavor, easy to prepare and fast!  Great dough for satisfying an unexpected pizza crave!!!  I agree that one will need to use some additional flour when kneading/forming the dough.  Good stuff, though.

I've tried so many dough recipes....we live way up in the mountains and it's so much time and gas to go get pizza. This dough is as close to the East Coast Pizzeria flavor my Jersey-born hubby loves. He was very, very happy with this!!

love the dough - love the recipe! I use all-purpose flour and it's great!   The recipe should add a rolling pin and to use generous amounts of flour when rolling and also on the peel to be able to get the pizza off.

Very nice! I added more sugar, and did half wheat flour, half regular flour so that it tasted like a honey wheat crust.  The kids loved it.

Perfect.  I used it for pizza and breadsticks.  I did not follow the exact flour amount because I always go by how the dough feels.  I am guessing I added about 1/2 to 3/4 cup more flour.  It still turned out delish!

I thought this was great, it was so fast and easy and i just used regular all purpose flour and it turned out just like something you could get at an Italian restaurant. I made it in the kitchenaid mixer with the dough hook, so simple!

This recipe came out pretty good and I am a semi beginner. I changed it a little though after the first time. This is a single rise recipe, but after the first rise I added a little flour and kneaded it again and let it rise again and the crust came out even better.  Good recipe though! :-)

My family and I LOVE this dough!!  I'm never  making any other dough again.  It was fluffy and thick and tasted amazing!  We actually lined mini bread pans with it to make personal deep dish pizzas, which worked wonderfully.  Thank you for this great recipe!

I also had to use a lot more flour, but overall I really liked it.  This is the first time I've ever made my own crust, so I was pleased that it wasn't a soggy mess in the middle.  I will add less olive oil next time...it seemed a little strong in that area.

This dough is so simple to make. I did add more than 2 cups of bread flour. It probably came to another 1/4 of a cup. And be prepared to add some more cooking time since it does take a while to brown. Overall, an easy to make, thick and flavorful crust.

Very good pizza crust. Holds up to the weight of the toppings very well. I would recommend adding about 1/4 to 1/2 cup more flour to reduce the stickiness. I used King Arthur's Bread Flour, everyone loved it. I also pre-baked the crust for 5 mins before adding the toppings then for 20 mins at 400 degrees.

If you like a thinner softer crust than I'd leave this recipe as is. I always use a blended four (whole wheat and non bleached) to make my pizza dough. When kneeding the dough I add flour to help it be more workable and not so sticky. Although it was a softer dough I found that that made it was easier work with a rolling pin into a thinner crust (making an extra thin crust this recipe yielded two med sized pizzas!). I also always bake my pizza at 400. The crust reminded me of the old way pizza was done. Where as the crust was soft it was by no means uncooked, the taste was perfect but the toppings ended up being the star of the show, without all that bread to get in the way. MMMM!

Excellent, Excellent!  Easy to prepare and it was delicious!  I have used 2 times this week---once with original ingredients.  The second time I added about 1 tsp of crushed red pepper flakes (our famliy loves them) and about 1/4 tsp of garlic POWDER.  Tasty, tasty, tasty!  Will never pay $6.00+ for a pre-made crust again!  Thanks for sharing!

I've made this dough 5 or 6 times now (usually doubling the recipe to make 2 pizzas) and everyone loves this pizza dough.  However, I did make a few modifications based on my own trial and error. 1) You need to use a 1/2 cup to a cup more flour than the original recipe calls for. Just add more until the dough just feels right (not so sticky and easy to work with).  2) Bake at 425 degrees.  350 degrees was way too low for me. 425 for about 20 minutes and it came out great.

Fantastic recipe! We have been using this recipe every Friday night for 3 months and it has never failed. Depending on who measures the flour, sometimes we need to add more. I used this recipe today for cinnamon buns and again it was perfect. Thanks.

WAY too little flour!! Dough was sticky and impossible to work with so I had to add a ton more flour and then it was too dense and cardboard-like after baking. I won't be using this recipe again.

Excellent dough.  I make bread frequently and use the bread dough for pizza.  This is a faster, easier way to make pizza dough.  I did, however, use 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of white flour in the first batch.  In the second batch, I didn't have enough white flour so I substituted some spelt flour in the recipe with the whole wheat flour.  Both pizzas were terrific. This is a keeper.  Thanks so much. Delicious!

just made this tonight; very good crust for an oven baked (home style) pizza...usually I don't enjoy home baked pizzas since the crust tastes very bready for lack of better words, but this one was pretty good!

I am in the process of making this again as I type out my review. This made an excellent dough.  The only thing I would have done different was play around with the flavor a bit which I intend to do this time with some garlic and herbs but that is just my personal preference. Obviously making again, lol!

I tried this dough for both deep dish and thin crust and it worked beautifully for both.  I added a little bit more olive oil than called for and it was flaky and light.  YUMMY

This was fantastic! I did as another reviewer suggested and baked at 400 degrees and added about a half cup more flour. It turned out great. After we ate, I made a double batch and put it in the freezer for an even quicker meal another time. Definitely a keeper recipe!

This crust is AWESOME!  I originally added spices (italian seasoning, garlic powder, etc) but it really doesn't need anything extra!  Also, I have made it with 3/4 cup water to cut down on the dough stickiness and it IS less sticky, but the crust doesn't turn out nearly as well.  Something in the middle, like 7/8 cup water, is just about perfect. Just be sure to flour your hands and counter before you start playing with your dough!  For dough rising, I let it rise for one hour in a warm place (we have a two-deck oven, so I heat the top to 200* and place the bowl covered with a damp tea towel underneath for an hour) and it turns out great every time!  I bake our pizzas at 400* on a preheated pizza stone and cooking time depends on the toppings, so keep an eye on it.

Great dough. Very easy to work with. I used it to make the BBQ Chicken Calzones on this website and it was delicious. Nice and crusty on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside.

I think this is a pretty good dough. I add garlic powder, crushed red pepper, and basil into the dough. I didn't have a problem with stickiness as mentioned in previous reviews. I get a crispy crust by heating my pizza stone to 500 degrees then lowering the temperature of the oven to 375, to cook with toppings. I find it an excellent crust for my pizzas.

I didn't have a problem with the middle being soggy. I actually had a problem with it being too tough. I took some suggestions and heated my oven to 400 degrees and precooked the dough for about 3 mins then decided i wouldnt mind it being a little soggy. (haha) So i took it out and let it cook for 20 mins, but it was a little tougher than expected. I will try this again.

I made this recipe in the bread maker and will need to add more flour or less water.  The dough was too sticky.  I just added more flour, kneaded and rolled it out.  Worked out great!  I normally add butter to the edges of the crust but decided to add it all over the pizza dough.  Baked the crust for 7 mins before adding the sauce and other ingredients.  Baked pizza for another 20 minutes.  Pizza turned out great!  Just need to eat with a fork because it breaks too easy.

Wow!! This recipe turned out great!    I doubled the recipe, I had no problems with it being too sticky. I did as another poster suggested and cooked it at 400 degrees and it definately was not soggy at all. I also added some italian seasoning and garlic salt and it had great taste. Will definately use again!

This is a great great pizza dough recipe.  I haven't tried many other recipes, but why try more when you have the best.  My Husband LOVES this crust.  Sometimes I add garlic or other herbs/spices when I'm making it. Also, I always need at least 1/4 cup more flour than is called for. GREAT recipe.
I've also made this recipe with wheat flour and all-purpose flour.  While I still really like the better for bread flour, any flour you have works with this dough.

Rarely cook with yeast doughs, but the amount of reviews encouraged me. This turned out beautifully. I followed your recipe exactly as written. I am sending pics of the pizza I made. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I will use it over and over.  And to think, I have been buying mine for $4 a round at the local pizza joint. No more!!

I love this super quick recipe!  When I have time, I let it rise for about 3 hours and stretch it into a jelly roll pan.  Have also done the 30 minute rise, but I prefer to let it rise longer.  The dough is a bit sticky, so I put olive oil on my hands when shaping the dough.  Can easily be doctored up with garlic for Italian pizza, extra sugar and cardamom for fruit pizza, or taco seasoning for Mexican pizza.  Mmmm... :)  You can easily make a pizza in the time it generally takes to get delivery, at a fraction of the price!

This dough came out perfect with a little altering. The bread flour definitely makes a difference. I altered a bit by using Garlic Extra Virgin Olive Oil which gave it a great flavor and i increased the flour to 2 1/4 cup bread flour.  I let the dough rise 30 minutes. This resulted in a light yet crispy crust. I made two different types of pizza and used two different types of pans. I bought the "Airbake" non-sick large pizza pan with the wholes in it and the recipe makes a perfect size for this pan. I baked on the lower rack of my oven and the crust was perfect!  The other pizza I baked on a pizza stone from Target. The only down side is the stone is smaller than the airbake so my crust was a little thicker on the pizza stone.  I also baked the crust which was brushed with garlic E.V.O.O. for about 6-7 minutes first before putting sauce, cheese and toppings.  I made a half pepperoni and half cheese and a half margherita (garlic olive oil, sliced mozzarella, sliced tomatoes and chopped basil...YUM!) and half pineapple and Canadian bacon. ALL were a hit for my family. Will definitely be making this once a week!

Definitely had to add more flour.  Used pan with holes in the bottom.  Kept the toppings simple.  My kids thought it was some of the best pizza they had ever eaten.  We can't wait to make it again.

This recipe is great! I'm a little biased on pizza dough... worked at a great pizza place years ago, and nothing seems to compare, but this one was really good! Not too bready, not too tough, thin, crispy and not floppy. I added a little bit more flour than it called for (about 1/2 cup), and a bit of tomato-basil seasoning. My son said- Mom this is the best pizza ever!!!

Both times I tried using this recipe I had to add about twice the flour it called for, for it to become a "stiff dough" at all.    The first time, I made homemade fried strombolis and the consistency of the dough worked out decently, though I was short on dough so had some problems with it tearing.    The second time, I made two double batches for two 16-inch crusts, because I  worried I'd have tearing problems again.  The crust, while very tasty, came out more like bread or rolls instead of the chewy-soft consistency of the pizzas our favorite local pizza place makes.    Maybe next time I'll make the two double recipes but will make three pizzas instead of two.  Can't seem to find the happy medium between super-thin crust and almost a Chicago-style crust yet.

Great dough to work with! My family all agreed this crust was better than Alfy's. We were able to create thin crust and thick crust pizzas from the same batch of dough. I'm making pizza pockets tonight. I'm sure they will be delicious.

This made a fantastic tasting crust that was easy to roll out and work with.  I made to pizzas with it.  1 was a thin crust the other I topped with topping and let it rise a little to make a thicker crust.  I used 1/2 cup wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups regular white flour (not bread flour) and it turned out great.  After adding the oil, it looked very oily, but didn't seem that way when I rolled it or baked it.  It took longer to rise (because of the wheat flour).  After the rise, I punched it down and left it in the fridge all day until dinner time.  I brought it to room temperature and it turned out great.  This is the easiest and best of many recipes I've tried.

Read this first. You will need to add more flower. I always make the recipe to the letter befor passing judgment. I have Done the flower by weight and by volume. So either use 3/4 cups water or 2 1/2 cups flower to get to the right texture. Now that that is said, I will say that this is the best dough I have ever tasted. Wow it makes a great pizza. You can strech it thin like New York and get two Pizzas from it or you can make a thick crust pizza by using the whole ball.

pretty good. my first pizza! Roll this out thiiiiiiiiin because it rises in the oven even if it doesn't before you roll it. I used all purpose unbleached flour in place of the bread flour. And it turned out fine!

Everything turned out great!  The only thing I suggest is upping the temp to 400 instead of 350, after 20 min it's still doughy at 350.  Otherwise turned out great!

My first time ever making pizza dough and this was perfectly easy! My bf is particular about thin crust and this turned out delicious. I added dried dill and oregano to the dough and it gave it a beautiful color. We used the extra dough to make strombollis and since this was a thin crust it cooked perfectly!  The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star is that I think the dough needed more salt and the oven (which we rarely have to turn up) I had to move up to 380 to get a crispy crust.  Thanks for this recipe!!!!

The dough was pretty dough-y and thick. I put too much cheese on the one I made and it made the pizza really heavy. I would recommend a pan with holes or maybe not let the dough rise as long (I let it rise about 40 minutes). Otherwise pretty good.

This is a great tasting easy to make dough. I used cormeal when rolling it out to avoid that flour taste and it was just fantastic. Very easy to make and it makes a authentic tasting pizza.

Certainly the easiest pizza dough I've yet to use (though I still prefer focaccia crusts--so sue me!). I did add about a 1/2c more flour (whole wheat this time) to the recipe's stated 2c. I also added some herbs and such (namely, a tablespoon of Italian seasoning and a teaspoon of garlic powder.) It smelled divine, and tasted great :-) Thanks!

I used white flour (about 2 1/4 cups) instead of Bread Flour because Bread Flour tends to be tougher.  The recipe was excellent - the best I've ever tasted and my husband loved it.

Tried this recipe for my husband tonight and it was not a great hit with either of us. The crust didn't brown much and it was very floury tasting. Will try again and hopefully it will turn out better next time

LOVED this dough. I used it for making Calzones and found that Adding 1/2 tsp of sugar to help your yeast makes for a great lighter dough. I dont add sauce into my calzones so I had no trouble with the soggyness that others describe but I also have a raised baking sheet with holes in it A must have for good crispy pizza.

I'm from NY, so I have fairly specific taste in pizza dough.  This is a completely acceptable recipe.  It was quick and easy, and the dough has a good flavor. But for me, this dough was a bit too bready and not quite chewy enough.  Like others, I wound up adding more flour that the recipe called for.

Great recipe, only adjustments I made (after attempt #1 yielded some soggy dough in the middle) is to roll it out thinner, raise the bake temperature to 400 and keep it in the oven for 10 minutes longer.  That's because I used a cookie sheet.  My sense is that if you have the proper equipment - pizza pan with holes or pizza stone - the soggy problem will go away.

I think this recipe is wonderful.  I use my bread machine to mix the dough and use about 2 1/2 cups flour otherwise it is too sticky for me.  It is easy to adapt if you like more flavor in your crust, just add whichever seasonings you prefer.  Good basic/starter dough.

Two cups of bread flour??? I don't think so. This recipe requires at least and additional cup in order to make a proper dough. Otherwise it is too sticky and unworkable. Otherwise, it's a good basic pizza dough recipe.

I followed the recipe, as far as the ingrediants go exactly.  I mixed everything in my Kitchen Aid mixer with the paddle attachment until mixed then used the dough hook and kneeded it for a few minutes.  I added a little more flour while it was kneeding until it was the right consistency.    The only thing you have to be aware of is using the right yeast...Be sure to use the regular active dry yeast, not the rapid rise.  I made that mistake the first time I made this and the dough didn't rise very well.  Also be sure that the water is at the right temperature, it makes a difference.

This dough is awesome!!!

Very little exp and wanting to make homemade pizza for Xmas Eve.

Was frightened since the dough didn't raise as it should in the 30 mins but I spread it on the pan anyways and hoped for the best.

I was not dissapointed and will never buy a pizza shop pizza again.  Was actually told I should open my own shop!

A little extra dough ( maybe a 1/4 cup) and don't worry about "mixing" too much.  Just throw it a bit by hand in the bowl.  Toss it as a ball into a 200 oven for about 10 mins and spread on a pan.

I only give it a 4 because the recipe had to be adjusted, but overall this pizza crust was great. I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour to the dough and it was still sticky, so I threw in a few more tablespoons while my KA mixer was kneading. I let the dough rise for 1.5 hours and it got nice and squishy. I pre-baked at 400 F for 7 minutes then topped and continued baking until the cheese melted. I will definitely use this recipe again!!

Wish I had read the comments before making this. As written the dough is way too wet and soft. Definitely needed to add more flour. If you want a crispier crust at higher temp and lower the rack,

I never knew pizza dough was so easy to make!  In order to determine the temperature of water for the yeast, I just make it about the same temp. as a baby's bottle--you know the ol' test on your wrist thing.  I had to add a bit more flour so it wasn't so sticky.  Then I let the dough rise for a couple of hours, and then spread it out on a round pizza pan.  I increased the temp. to 400 (as suggested by another reviewer) and cooked with all the toppings for 20 minutes.  Came out great--I will never buy the canned refridgerator stuff again!    UPDATE:  I just made this again with disasterous results!  I made it on a smaller, round pizza pan.  Which made it thicker.  All of the topping burned and the crust never browned--too thick!  So I will use my square cookie sheet from here on out!

This was the quickest and easiest pizza dough that I have ever made... I typically make my dough in the bread machine, but it is such a pain and it takes so long... With this recipe I can make pizza for the family in half the time, it is still homemade, cheap and yummy... I LOVE IT!!! My husband watched me make it and he was like "Seriously, that's it? I could even do that!"

I made this tonight and I was not that impressed. When I went to roll it out all I had was a huge sticky mess so I added more flour like others have suggested. It tasted pretty good but the middle was still a bit gooey when I took it out. It has potential. Maybe I just need to change it up a bit.

seems sticky, but it makes it spread well.  if you just use a lot of flour to spread it out, you'll be fine. I am lazy and I put all of the ingredients in my bread machine on the dough cycle and it works great. I don't change any of the ingredients.   this is a keeper and the only pizza dough recipe I use. My friends rave about my pizza!

I have tried another pizza dough on this site which I thought was great but just for something different I tried this one. My husband and I both think this is the best pizza crust you can make. I made the following changes: I only used 3/4 cup water, I mixed oregano, marjoram, basil and garlic granules to the flour along with the sugar and salt. I mixed/kneaded the dough in my kitchenaid and let rise for about 30 minutes. It didn't come close to doubling, but it still had a great flavor. Definitely 5 stars.

This recipe is great. I used it on average once a week, and I am never disapointed! If using all white flour I suggest adding 1/4 cup of flour to make it easier to work with, but when I use half whole wheat I never have any problems. I make one full size pizza and one small pizza. Definatly a keeper, no need to look futhur for your dough recipe!

I can not get my kids to stop asking if we can make home made pizza again! This was great and I was all out of olive oil the first time I made it so I used veg. and it was still great. We divided it up into 4 balls and each of the kids got to make their own personal pizza. I brushed the crust with garlic butter. Next time I'm going to make a double batch and make bread sticks too.

Simply wonderful. I haven't done homemade pizza in a while, but this was great. Just a note: I use large cookie sheets for my pizza, I needed two batches to make a good crust.

Just made this for supper tonight - my first time making any kind of dough from scratch - and I think it turned out great!  My husband agrees.  The only thing I did different was brush it with olive oil and prebake at 450 for 5 minutes before topping it.  Then about 10-15 more minutes, until it was getting pretty brown.  I'm not sure I'll ever use a mix again!  It's worth the effort (which thankfully is not a lot!).  :-)

This recipe was great! Not complicated at all. This was my first try at making pizza from scratch, and it was perfect. I will defiantly be using it again.

I did not really change the recipe, but I did add a tad extra flour, some fresh ground pepper and dry Greek seasoning. And I also sifter the dry ingredients together to unsure a lump free dough.

I loved this recipe. It was verry easy to work with. I added in something else you may want to try. Three habenero pepers were cut up and boiled into 1/4 cup of viniger. After boiled (set in microwave for 3 minuets) the peper remains were strained out the the viniger was added to the yeast mixture at the beggining. Next three jalapeno peppers were diced and added. And extra half cup of flower was needed. But thanks for the recipe.

Very good.  I sprinkled the pan with about 2-3 tablespoons corn meal before placing the dough on the pan to make it crispy and poked holes in it.  Also, prebaked crust for 10 minutes (should have done for longer) then added sauce and toppings.  Baked with toppings for 20 minutes. UPDATE!!!  I cut the dough in half and froze it since I like thin crust.  Perfect and crispy when prebaked for 10 minutes, added toppings and baked for about 25 minutes.

Nice One! A very good Pizza base, I sustituted the wheat for Spelt flour,(wheat alergy) and even though spelt is usually too delicate to make pizza dough, it worked extremely well. Thank You!

I really liked this dough. It was easy to work with and tasted great. The only thing is, that my dough didn't raise. So, I am not sure if I did something wrong or not. I went ahead and made the pizza and it turned out fine.

The best part about the recipe is that its fast, and easy.  Don't expect it to be the best crust you've ever had, it was bready and did not expand or get crispy.  So so experience, I used organic white flour, maybe that was the problem?

This was very easy to make however, I used regular flour....and I don't know if that is why, I ended up needing to add almost an additional cup of flour because the consistency was way too sticky to work with.  I also, added more salt......and cornmeal to the bottom of the pizza.  Came out pretty good.

This Recipe is AMAZING. I use this all the time. Just make sure to use just under 1 cup of water because sometimes it comes out a little wet. but if that happens, just add more flour until it gets to be doughy.

This was so very good. It surprised me I have never made dough from scratch before. This recipe made as simple as 1-2-3. I did as the others and added some parsley and garlic salt. I also let the dough cook for half way before put on the toppings to insure that it cooked all the way through. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was SO easy, and good too.  I made the recommended adjustments.  I used all purpose flour, added 1/4 tsp each of marjoram, oregano, thyme, basil, and garlic powder, and used only 3/4 cup of water.  This was good, and SO easy.  Five stars for the simplicity of this recipe!

This was a great bread! I made it today and it was SO yummy! I added italian spices to the bread though, about 1/4 tsp of basil, oregano, rosemary and thyme each. Maybe more than that. It really helped to take away that 'flour' taste.

I used white flour, not bread flour - didn't know that existed.

I read through a bunch of reviews left by other members.  I agree that the water in this recipe is a bit too much.  You should only need about 3/4 unless you're intersted in adding flour. I took that into consideration while making the dough.  I used one of those huge countertop mixers with the dough hook attachment, put all of the dry ingredients in, added the olive oil, turned on the mixer and slowly added the yeast mixture. I had exactly 1/4 cup of liquid left when the ball of dough formed. This was a quick and easy recipe. I may try some other crust recipes next time but this was really simple and easy... excellent if you've got a counter top mixer and not a whole lot of prep time.

This is an absolutely amazing recipe for Pizza Dough, I have been searching for a good recipe and I have finally found the best. The dough has a very smooth yet slightly chewy texture that I love. The recipes I have been using called for (in general) around 3 cups flour, I think less flour is the key to the crust in this recipe. One change I had to make, I ran out of bread flour after a half a cup, so the rest was all purpose. This recipe made enough to cover a large rectangular cookie sheet and it's just the right amount of dough. All in all a great recipe that I will definitely be making over and over again. Thank you!

I love this recipe.  I can't believe how yummy the dough was and how quick it was to make.  I even had to use regular flour instead of bread flour and it was still fantastic!!  I did use about 1/4 cup more flour than what the recipe called for.  Highly recommend this recipe to anyone!!

I really liked the taste of this dough. It was too sticky, and I needed to add about a half cup of flour, but I am not sure if that was because I doubled the recipe. It was a bit difficult to get off the peel and onto the stone because the dough was so soft and stretchy. Thanks!

Really enjoyed this pizza dough recipe. I added some garlic and italian seasoning to the dough and once I put it in the pan I let it bake for about 5 minutes before I added the toppings. It was delicious!!!!

I made in a bread machine set on dough.  It needed a lot more flour than the recipe called for, but it could be because I used some whole wheat flour.  I just stopped the machine, started it mixing again and added bread flour until it was no longer sticky.

I chose this recipe because I was running late on dinner and needed a quick dough (compared to another recipe I tried and liked on this site).  I followed the directions exactly, except I kneaded it a bit and in doing so added a smidge more flour (not much).  It made a nice medium thickness 10" pie.  The cooked dough texture was what bothered me.  I'm not really sure how to describe it.  It was light, chewy, bland and very floury tasting.  It was not typical pizza crust consistency.  My six-year-old had no complaints.  All in all, it was edible, but not a recipe I'm likely to try again.

Easy to make but takes a bit of time for the dough to rise. Reducing the amount of water or adding extra flour is needed or the dough is a bit sticky. I even made dinner rolls with this recipe, adding cheese, garlic and herbs. As a pizza base, it is quite similar to the frozen bases from the supermarkets but better since it's fresh.

I like this quick and easy recipe.  I used minced garlic and oregano in the dough mix, and the crust came out fine, but I overloaded my pie with too much stuff.  For a browner crust - coat the dough with sugar before putting on your backing stone.

This dough was ok. It was the first time that I had made homeade pizza. The pizza turned out pretty good, but I wasn't sure about this dough. It was really dense. We made breadsticks out of the dough too- but it wasn't as light as I was looking for. I used to work at a wonderful family owned pizza place- and I got spoiled by their amazing crust. I will keep looking for the perfect crust recipe, but until then- this recipe will do. Thank you.

I thought that a bread-style dough should be kneeded intead of just being mixed together. I also thought that this recipe need to be set at a higher tempreture - try pre-baking for a bit or poke a fork around the dough to allow moisture to escape. Otherwise it was bellisimo!

I use regular flour, and mix the sugar in with the yeast and warm water. We will never buy another pizza mix again. We make this all the time. One batch makes a perfect amount for three 8" cake pans size for the kids! The second batch we use a cookie sheet for ourselves.
I think I am going to try a whole wheat flour/regular flour combo next time for a variation.

This was very easy and took very little time.  My family loved it.  I baked the pizza on my baking stone; it didn't get brown on the bottom but it was very tasty and was sort of like a soft pretzel (my husband's favorite).  I will use this recipe again.  My daughter wants to make bread sticks from this recipe.

I do love the simplicity of this recipe, it was one the first I tried when I ventured into making my own pizza.  What I did have to adjust was the oven temp once the pizza went in.  350 is just not hot enough to cook it properly.  400 works perfectly.  But other than that........it's awesome!!!   Give it a go and you won't be disappointed!!

I've been on a quest to find the "perfect" pizza dough (for us.) If you're short on time, this is it. I used my KitchenAid stand mixer and yes, it's a very wet, sticky dough. I added one more tablespoon of (bread) flour and decided to just see how it would turn out. A dough this hydrated can be incredibly intimidating if you're not used to working with it (dough.) I let mine rise covered, on the stovetop and it rose beautifully. I turned it out onto a fairly heavily floured surface and gave it a few folds. I did it both by hand and with a bench scraper. Next time, I'm going to forgo the floured surface and use a lightly oiled surface. I divided in half and cooked in 2, preheated, screaming-hot, cast iron skillets (500 degrees for preheat and 475 for cooking.) I cooked about 12 minutes and both were excellent. Brown and fry-crisp on the bottom but fluffy on the inside. To make the rounds I, cut in half and then used my fingertips (like making a focaccia) to get it into shape. Light stretches on the outer edges and it was perfect. I let it rest about 15 minutes and it developed a lot of nice bubbles. When transferring to the hot skillet, you have to commit to the move!!! (I used 10 inch skillets) or use a HEAVILY floured peel/parchment sheet. I added about 1 TPBS to the hot pan and added my toppings quickly. 
We'll be using this recipe for weeknights or last minutes pizza decisions when I haven't planned ahead. 
*NOTE* I've tested Bobby Flay's pizza dough, ATK 2 day pizza dough

I've made this dough a few times for either stuffed breads or pizza. I agree with others that it comes out too sticky and pulls apart easily. It's better to reduce the oil to 1 tbsp and to add flour for better strength. It's good, otherwise...

Great and easy recipe!! I ended up doubling the recipe to make 2 pizzas. Would recommend increasing the temperature of the oven (depending on your oven), i ended up having to leave them in for longer than 20 minutes.

I’ve been making this dough for about 8 years and love it!  We do add a bit of spices because we prefer the taste. The key is in proofing the yeast.  I’ve never had trouble with the dough getting done, but just realized in rereading this that I’ve always baked it on 400! It works great for some nice Italian rolls to go with pasta also. Just pinch off pieces, roll them in butter and bake them in a muffin tin. Or shape them, let them rise about 15 min. and brush with butter after baking.

This isn’t a very good recipe. Ive made a lot of bread and different doughs before. I made the dough just as said and even added a little more flour. Still way to sticky and didn’t turn out very well.

Easy to make and even better than fresh dough from the grocery store.  Will definitely be making this again.

This was super easy to make and very tasty.  I followed the recipe as is,  I took the advice from a previous rating and cooked it at 400 for 20 mins or so. I also used a pizza stone.  Between those two things, I had no problems with soggy dough,  it was perfect.

The perfect crispy fresh pizza dough recipe! The only difference is I followed the yeast package for how much water to add, then I just adjusted according the get the end result.

This was every bit as good as the best reviews said, but it did also require the modifications mentioned in many reviews.  I made this using my stand mixer and kept gradually adding flour because it was so sticky.  I added between an extra 1/4 and 1/2 cup.  I also added garlic powder and Italian seasoning, which ended up tasting amazing.  I let rise for about 45 minutes to allow it to double and baked it  (no prebake) at 400 for 20-25 minutes on a vented pizza pan.  I brushed garlic butter on the edge of crust during the last 5.  Will definitely make again.

Flavorless, boring pizza dough. Literally 7x the amount of yeast needed for proper pizza dough. Should use white slices of bread as substitute for same effect.

I used truvia nectar (stevia with honey and sugar) and Wesson canola oil.  I also added onion and garlic powder and Italian seasoning.  I turned the oven on for three minutes then turned it off and put the covered bowl in. Let it rise about thirty minutes. Preheated the baking sheet a few minutes. Then let it bake for 15. I needed a bit of flour on my hands to roll it out. It was sticky. I loved it! Fluffy crust with just a bit of crispiness. Best I’ve made and will make again.

I love this base. I cut the dough into three different portions which are a perfect size for an individual pizza. I then use a basting oil for the crust, jarred sauce with added basil, and fresh mozzarella cheese with oregano.

decided to use brown sugar just to see... and oiled the edge too, dough was perfect and delicious.
will try just white sugar but might add vanilla extract ;D
regardless dough thickness was perfect and enjoyed.

I liked the recipe, but I don't know what I did. Either  I didn't give my yeast enough time or it didn't raise well but it took forever to cook 1hr and 1/2 and still was not done. I had to take it off the pan and put on oven rack to get the bottom cooked. Someone help.

This recipe was so easy and good!  I decided to make a double batch since we were making 2 pizzas.  One I made following the directions exactly and the other I let the dough sit stretched and ready in the pan for about a 1/2 before assembling.  If you like traditional crust go for the exact recipe but if you like the light and fluffy Greek style crust definitely go the 2nd route.  Either way, it's a winner.

After reading reviews, I added a bit more flour. I set it to rise, covered, on top of my heating pad on LOW, and it doubled in 30 minutes.  It turned out great! Hubby LOVED it. I baked mine at 425 F. for 13 minutes - your results may vary so keep an eye until golden brown.

Great pizza dough recipe!  I made it as written, but a hair less than 1 cup water.  (I did use more flour when shaping the pie)  You don't need a stand mixer - I started with a hand-mixer and then by hand.  I made a small garlic white pizza on the grill to see how it went.  Hubby - mehh (he said he didn't like the olive oil taste...so not the dough), but I thought it was great and offers a lot of variations.  Can't wait to experiment with the dough:)  Thank you for the receipe.

Turned out amazing! I followed the recipe to the word. Once rolled out I put garlic powder and basil on top to flavour and did a pre bake by putting a baking sheet in a cool oven while the oven preheats. Then I put just the dough on parchment paper on the pre heated sheet and baked it for 5 mins alone. Took it out, added my toppings and baked normally. Only thing I'd change is put a little more sauce on. Tried to be scant with it so the dough didn't get soggy but I could have gotten away with a little more. Crust came out perfectly

A big hit with the whole family. As many others have stated I added more flour as it wasn’t thick enough to work with. Once I had the consistency to my liking it was very easy to work with. Most importantly- it tasted amazing! We will make this again.

I decided to try this recipe instead of my usual pizza dough which takes hours to rise. I'm glad I did, the dough was tasty and so easy to make. Also, rather than using a pizza stone, try using an oiled cast iron skillet. I prefer my pizza on cast iron over my pizza stone anyway.

Used regular flour, was really good to mix the herbs into the dough, gives it a very flavourful kick (thyme, parsley and Italian seasoning) was a 100/10 in this house hold. Even our 3 y.o. Loved it!

So good I haven't ordered takeout in over a year. I use half white and half whole wheat/sprouted as I find it gives the crust an even fuller flavor.

I will make this again but learned a couple things. 1 Use 2 and 3/4 cups of flour, not 2 as indicated it's far to wet to work with otherwise. 2. I had to let mine rise for 1hr and 20min for it to rise fully. 3. This made 2 med. Size pizzas....very thin crust. The cooking time was spot on though. I will make it again for sure.

So much better than the crust I used to make with regular flour. I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour as per other reviews, and let it rise for 45 mins. Turned out perfect! I will use this recipe from now on :)

Just watch the water temperature to make sure the yeast rises, and it will be perfect.

Absolute best pizza dough recipe!  If I’m making it the night ahead, I add 2 extra tablespoons of flour during mixing.  Put in fridge after initial 1/2 hour rest/rise, and take out and hour or so before cooking.  We love it so much we hardly buy pizza out anymore!

Our pizzas turned out OK, but the dough was by far the best part. One big note: we back at 400-425 F (not 350 F like the recipe says). They can turn out soggy otherwise.

I made it with all purpose flour and it turned out pretty good.  Feels like it was missing something flavor wise, but definitely a good base for pizza! Thank you for the recipe.

Am I missing something?  So many people loved this recipe but it was a mess.  The dough did not stick together at all and I followed the recipe to a "t".   The dough was way to sticky -- it wouldn't even roll out w/o tearing -- and yeast dough shouldn't do that.  And 30 min to rise?  That hardly seems enough.  The proportions of water:flour are SO different from most other recipes.  I should have paid attention.  Also I am waiting now for it to look longer as the center is still undone even though it's gone the 30 min.  The oven temp (350) was suspect to me too -- seems pizza usually needs a hotter oven.  I need to be cautious when something like pizza dough is given a "quick an easy" description.  Some things to be done right just take more time.

I doubled the recipe to make 2 thick crusts for my pizza stones and brushed the crust with a butter seasoning before baking.  A tip, pre-bake the dough for a few minutes.  Mine was still uncooked in the very middle.  Tasty and chewy, just what I needed for a deep dish treat.

We love this recipe in my home - but as pizza making novices we had to try a few times to get it perfect. Here are some tips and tricks we've picked up along the way:
Increasing the oven temp to 375° helps keep the dough from becoming soggy. 
Thoroughly mix the dry ingredients with the warm water/yeast solution and then incorporate the olive oil last. This seems to helps keep the dough from sticking to the pan. 
Last, don't try to knead or reshape the dough round after it's risen, as this makes the dough hard to stretch properly. Just plop the round onto a floured surface, dust with more flour, and roll it out.
All in all though, this is a fantastic recipe. Thanks for posting!

I use this recipe every time and it always turns out perfect! Though I listened to another commentator and have my oven at 400 degrees and don't pre-bake the crust. While kneading the dough I use extra flour [like you'd normally use anyways] but I knead it until it's just a tiny bit sticky feeling but doesn't stick to my fingers or the pan at all. I use olive oil on the pan and then press the dough into the pan. It turns out perfectly each time, doesn't stick to the pan, and tastes amazing! Sometimes I use oregano or any other spice I feel like in the dough itself, but it's perfectly fine without it too.

I made this recipe as is, only increasing the sugar and salt slightly and used AP flour.  The dough was wetter than usual but with a bit of flour on my hands was incredibly easy to shape. After shaping the pizza I let it rest for a moment and was concerned that it didn't rise at all. But once in the oven the crust puffed up a bit and it was beautiful. 
I used all purpose flour but I bet bread flour would have been outstanding. Great recipe, thank you!

Cooked closer to thirty minutes. Initial taste was soggy. I would cook this crust at a lower temp, for a longer period, for my taste.

Easy and delicious.  It is better to let the dough sit in the refrigerator for several hours.  Make sure to oil the surface a little to prevent a skin forming.

This recipe is pretty good with some changes to suit yourself. I read lots of reviews and added more seasonings such as dried basil and oregano. I did not precook the crust and it turned out just fine.

Pretty basic but always turns out good for me. The one reviewer was talking about how he had trouble with baking it but the only way to bake this is either in a pizza oven or on a pizza stone. Don’t have one? Go get one or don’t make pizza from scratch. I use a pizza wheel to put all the sauce and toppings on slide it onto my stone using cornmeal. One trick I learned was if your using active dry yeast, make sure it goes in the fridge after opening. Hehe

This is the second time I used this recipe.  I used fast action yeast because that what I had at the moment. I love Garlic and basil so I added both suggested by a review (Thank you very much!). Took longer to rise an hour or so but I'm making it to use for tomorrow. After I rolled the dough out and put on my pizza pan with a sprinkle of cornmeal on the pan. Then brushed a little olive oil like butter before adding the sauce on top of the pizza. Not too much sauce a little goes a long way.
Add Cheese as desired and top with your favorites 
toppings. I brush the cooked crust on the edge with butter and garlic. Pretty good for home made without a pizza oven.

My husband said it tasted better than pizza from his high school (which was awesome), and it didn't get soggy when he microwaved it. I did have to add maybe 1/2 cup of flour extra.

My kids and I try to test a new recipe at least once a week.  They wanted homemade pizza but since we've moved, we can't find the premade pizza crust we use to.  The one they have here is not good so I thought, let's make it.  I decided on this one and everyone loved it and that's unheard of.  There's usually a 50/50 split or at least my youngest daughter who's super picky but no, they all loved it.  This one is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe!  Made once as the recipe states and it was delicious.  Made again using gluten free flour (my daughter is allergic to wheat) and it was great as well.  Tastes just like regular pizza!  Will be our new go-to recipe :)

I followed suggested changes from reviews; such a great crust! The dough was too sticky to handle with the recipe as written (I used all purpose flour though as it was what I had on hand); I ended up adding almost half a cup extra while kneading it for about 7-10 minutes. I cooked it at 400 for 21 minutes on an oiled pizza stone. The whole family loved it!

I used 2 tsp of yeast, and added the sugar to the yeast and warm water rather than waiting to add the sugar later.  I added more flour to make the dough less sticky. I baked the pizza for 15 minutes on the middle rack of a 400 degree oven. Yum!

This recipe was good and my wife liked it quite a bit.  I definitely recommend cooking the pizza dough after you roll it out on the pan.  Cook it for about 15-20 minutes at 350F.  Then put on the sauce, meats, veggies and cheese.

I didn’t let the yeast sit in warm water first, and I let it rise longer. I think this gave it a slightly strange, softer texture.... but very good overall! Kids liked. I will try following the recipe exactly next time.

Excellent recipe, freezes nicely and spreads easy. I asked a bit of Italian spices directly to the dough for a bit of extra flavour and it was fantastic!

Good crust. Only four stars because I had to modify it a bit. I only use 2/3 a cup of water so I don't have to add flour later which made the crust to thick. This way you end up with nice thin crust.

this was so easy and delicious.  I did proof the yeast with 1 teaspoon of sugar the first time and 2 the second and didn't see much difference.  besides that I followed the recipe exactly and it worked in the pizza oven perfect.  would love to try it with a portion of Whole wheat flour as well...

Easy to make and the best pizza dough recipe we have found to date. Followed the recipe exactly as written and did not find it too moist. Next time will add garlic powder, a bit more salt and Italian seasoning as others have recommended. Stretches out nicely with little or no need to use rolling pin.

Wonderful dough, easy to make, fun for the kids!  I cooked it in a gas oven and broiled it for the last minute to crisp the cheese a bit!

This is a very basic recipe.  As with any dough your ratio of flour and water will vary slightly depending on elevation, humidity and temperature when you're making the dough.  Always be ready to adjust either the flour or the water in a dough recipe.  That's not the recipes fault.  That's about where you live! 
I let this rise for over an hour before using and made the pizza in my cast iron skillet. Really good! I do add seasonings to the dough!

Turned out great! Super easy and fast, so if you don't have time to make a rising dough, this is a great alternative. I had to look in the comments/google how much yeast to put in since I was using a larger jar of it. Would be helpful to include that in the recipe. It ended up being 2.5 tsp. I also just add a bit of flour to the dough before rolling out so it's not that sticky. I roll it out directly onto parchment paper which makes clean up so much easier.

A great pizza crust!  I let is rise for about 1.5 hours and it made a 12" pizza with a "rising crust" - not "thin".  I baked the pizza at 400 for 16 min.  Next time I will do 350 as the recipes states.  We like it a little crispier, so I will probably need to go longer than the 20 min at 350.

I really liked how this dough came out in the end-- it was very fluffy and soft without being really chewy.  I didn't roll it out as much, (because my pizza pan was only so big) and it came out kind of thick. It was delicious.  I was worried about adding too much salt, so I omitted some of it, but next time I make it I will use the whole amount.  I gave it four stars because it was just a bit difficult to work with when trying to "turn it out" and the recipe didn't really mention if you need to knead it at all.  I wasn't sure if turning it out is the same as kneading.  Anyway, delicious and easy recipe, and I will be using it again!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was great. I was able to divide the dough into thirds and store 2 in the freezer. The next time I make it I'll try adding some seasoning to the dough as other reviewers have mentioned.

This was AMAZING and I used all purpose flour because it's what I had. I think the first step of dissolving the sugar and yeast in the proper temp warm water was KEY to my success.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, I will never use another tractor!

Good generic pizza crust recipe.  Make sure to cut the water down to 3/4 cup - I wish they'd just change it in the core recipe!  To help the rising, turn on your oven for a couple minutes so that it's warm and put the dough in with the door open while it rises.

I made this yesterday and like a lot of other reviewers I found 2 cups of flour wasn't enough, but as usual when I make bread or pizza dough I add flour as needed when kneading until the dough is the right consistency. I keep my house cool and find rising times in recipes are never long enough, so for this one I warmed the oven up a bit and let it rise in the oven for a little more than half an hour. I used regular all purpose flour and the rose well and turned out well. It's a good basic recipe but if you'very never made dough before I could see why it wouldn't turn out.

You could make this thinner and crisper by using a pizza stone to bake the bottom darker.  Overall great go to dough.

Dough was easy to put together

However it's too sticky 
When cooking at 350 the dough is not cooked or browned in twenty minutes
I increased to 400 and still didn't brown
So I'll try 450 next time 
Even if dough was a little pasty it tasted and smelt like pizza

My Grandson loves to cook. He's 10 yrs old and I let him go on this site to pick what he wants to make.This time he chose pizza so I quickly skimmed through the pizza dough recipes and came across this one. I used to own a pizza restaurant in Denver and this is pretty close to the recipe we used.
 Ive seen in some of the comments the dough was too sticky, so they added more flour.I recommend trying before pulling the dough out of your bowl, throw some flour on top of it. and throw flower on your countertop to place the dough on. You want to get flour on the outside of the dough to keep it from sticking. 
 We like thin crust, so we only used a little over half of the recipe for a 16" pizza, and made bread sticks with the rest.

I followed what several reviews suggested,1/4 cup more flour, also added a bit more olive oil along with granulated garlic,basil. I mixed with a spoon and then my hands, not sticky at all. Kneaded it for 8 min. and allowed it to rise for 2 hours. Baked in preheated oven at 450 with sauce and spices, for 15 min.then took it out added the cheese and sauteed peppers and mushrooms with hand sliced pepperoni popped it back in for another 5 min. Texture was great, taste flavorful. It was a little to thick for our taste, so next time I will use a little less and use the extra for a couple bread sticks for the dog so he will let us eat in peace. Will use this recipe from now on.
*Have made this 3 times now and have made a few adjustments.
Bake at 450 because my oven is a bit slow.
We like crust 1/4 in or so thick so this makes 2 12 inch round pies.
I read reviews before I made it the 1st time. I have read many since. The few that were neg. must not cook much. I like recipes that you can adjust to your taste.  This is perfect for the way I cook.

Made it as is. A very easy beginner recipe. Needed to add more flour when kneading because it was too sticky, but some flours are stiffer than others. I used all-purpose flour. Family loved it.

Great recipe. Not really difficult either. However, I made a big floury mess in the kitchen ??. I added some garlic powder and dried basil to the dough and it tastes awesome! I highly recommend it.

I have been using this recipe for making pizza for about 4 years now. The dough is too sticky so when I'm rolling it I need to use an additional 1/4c flour, more or less. Like other reviewer, I also put cornmeal on the pan under the dough. The pizza always turns out great!

I took the advice of another review and added 1/2 cup more flour in the kneading process as my dough was so sticky and liquid I couldn't get it out of the bowl.  I did not pre-cook  the crust before adding toppings and that was a mistake- the crust was too doughy. I made with regular flour perhaps also a mistake. Overall it was a useable crust but not impressed.

Very fast and not lab our intensive, I prepared it earlier in the morning and left covered on the counter for at least 4 hours.The result, soft and airy dough that makes 4small to medium thin crust Pizzas. I increased the flour to about 2 and a half cups, 4 tsps of sugar because I liked a sweeter crust, also the sugar made it crispy and browner at the bottom in my opinion. I made it three times, each time adjusting the ingredients to my taste, adding the garlic into the dough and the Italian herbs and came to that conclusion.

This is a great recipe! I did make a few tweaks to the proof time. I let it rise in the bowl with a warm towl in the oven for 1 hour and once it is on the pan I let it rise a little longer. I also needed more flour than the recipe calls for (I'd say a good 1/2 cup more) otherwise it's just too sticky. Our family now uses this recipe every Friday or Saturday instead of buying pizza, and the guys love it!

I leave out the salt and decrease the yeast to 1 tsp for a low-sodium pizza dough for my husband's heart healthy diet. Baked on a 450 cast iron skillet in the oven for 7-10 minutes, its fabulous.

Brilliant! Family and hubby love it. So easy. Im not a great cook, but made me look really clever and tasted great. Fish one tuna and prawns. Another one spinach, mascarpone, mushroom, cherry tomato. Another one feta. Whatever you like. Thickish deep pan type pizza. Will try a different recipe for thin crispy one. Sometimes use deli wrap tortilla for thin one.

Delicious pizza, wasn't oily at all like the ones you buy, the pan I used was a little small so it had some extra. I made them into 2 small bread rolls and they tastes delicious. You can even make a no-egg no-butter bread with this. Amazing recipe

It is okay, but you should add the sugar to the yeast and water when proofing it.  It helps the yeast react faster.  I did need to add  a little more flour .  I also added a little powdered garlic, oregano and sweet  basil to the dough. Turned out good but cook your pizza at 400 for 20 minutes or it will turn out doughy. Also sprinkle a little cornmeal on the pan under the pizza before cooking and it will give it a better unique texture.

this Dough is simple, soft and delicious. I had 1 change, and instead of making 1 big pizza, I split the dough into 6 little ones , and made it. My Family loved it so much. My mom and my sister  don't like pizza, but they are it all. They loved the dough so much. I will make this again, but this time more dough.

It's obvious from the comments that it needed extra flour so I tossed everything in the bread machine plus an extra half cup of flour on dough cycle. I let it rest 15 minutes after and everything was perfect! I look forward to trying different spices and flavors depending on what pizza we're making. For us this made 4 personal sized pizzas and when baking at 385 there's no need to pre-cook the crusts. Yum!

For gluten free. Use PC brand gluten free flour instead. 
I know it's weird to rate a recipe when you sub things but this recipe is fantastic for what I need. We've tried this recipe with a few other gluten free flours and it's perfect if you want thin crust pizza, but if you miss real pizza, sub the flour with PC brand flour and it's freaking fantastic.

I have made this recipie a few times and it works very well! The only thing I do differently is I will cook the pizza for the full time without the cheese. Then add the cheese on top and broil it for about three minutes (you really need to watch it!) this way the cheese gets a nice golden brown look as well.  Just be careful not to leave it in to long or the crust will burn

This pizza dough is always good. Follow the recipe exactly, and it will turn out perfectly. I tried doubling it once, but it definitely isn't made to be doubled. Instead of doubling the recipe, just make two separate dough's. This is my go to pizza dough recipe.

I have made this several times and it has never failed.  It has become one of my fall back meals as I usually have all of the ingredients on hand.  This recipe is forgiving with time.  I have let the dough rise longer than the stated time and it did not have a negative affect on the outcome.

So, I only had AP flour, but after some googling, I found that it wouldn't make much of a difference.  I used my stand mixer and dough hook to mix, and it was SOOO sticky, so I added about 1/4 more flour.  It never really rose, and it was still super sticky when I went to roll it out.  I prolly used another 1/2 cup when I was rolling it out.  When I put it on my pizza pan, I thinned the middle out as much as possible, and poked holes in it, hoping that would counteract it not cooking like a other comments stated.  I also raised the temp to 400 for that reason.  It wasn't not cooked, but it wasn't cooked all the way either.  And I couldn't increase the bake time or I would have burned the toppings and cheese.  It tasted ok, and we ate it, but I don't think I will use this recipe again.

This is my go to recipe for pizza crust after trying a few recipes. I do end up adding a little more flour before letting the dough rise as it's quite sticky. I also knead the dough by hand until it's firm but not tough.

This was sooo easy and it got rave reviews in my household.   We love thin crust pizza, so I just divided it into 4 equal balls and rolled out thin to get a more crispy crust.  I also added garlic powder to the dough.  I also used honey instead of sugar (2 T) and mixed it for 6 minutes on my Kitchenaid before letting it rise.  I am so pleased with how this has come out and have used this recipe many times!  Will no longer buy pizza.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

I made this recipe in 2 doses today and it was delicious!!! I did follow another reviewers' s advice  and baked at 400F, and I believe it really helped in cooking the pizzas all the way. I like my pizza a little crusty at the bottom so I baked them for 25 min instead of 20. The extra 5 min gave it a little crust...not too much.  I really believe the bread flour makes all the difference ...I had baked a very similar recipe before but with regular flour and bread flour is a big improvement in my opinion. My 11 year old son loved it and he is so happy his mommy can bake delicious pizza from scratch!  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This is a wonderful dough that I've made many times. I've started to dissolve the sugar into the water and yeast, and I usually end up having to add a bit of flour at the end, but that's something you'd expect. It is easily modified, a good rule of thumb, and so easy to make!

This was a very "breadth" crust. It had a great taste though! I might try it at a higher temp in the oven next time.

From my bread making experience I suspected 1 cup of water would be too much for the 2 cups of flour. I decreased the water to 3/4 cup and it came out perfect.  I have already made it twice and definitely plan on using it again.

This turned out fantastic, I did add about a half of a cup to possibly 3/4 of a cup extra bread flour so I was able to handle the dough better. It was light and airy, my whole family loved it. I will always use this recipe to make my pizza crust.

Cooking time and temp was horribly wrong. Cooked at 325 instead of the suggested 350 for 18 minutes. Burnt to a crisp.

This was a very wet and sticky dough.  Even though the recipe calls for 20 min. baking time, my pizza has been baking for 40 min. And still not done. Dough is still raw in the middle.

It was quick, for sure, and it got the job done. But it wasn't very good. I might make it again in a pinch, but I'll definitely 1) double the salt and sugar (it's really bland), and 2) pre-bake the crust for at least a good 10 minutes, as the middle stayed very soft while the edges got nice and crispy. And since the crust is missing the traditional chewy feel, you definitely want to get it crispy, or it's pretty off-putting.

Easy & great texture!  This recipe makes too thick of a crust for one large pizza (if you prefer a thinner crust), so I cut off the excess when I'm rolling it out into a nice thin sheet.  I freeze the extra to make something with another time.

This is an awesome recipe for BarBQ pizza , I divided the dough into 4 rounds on very lightly oiled  parchment paper. Got the BarB hot at about 375-400 lay the pizzas down with parchment side up, close lid wait a couple minutes then turn with the dough with tongs to get good grill marks. You should be able to peel the paper off once the dough starts to bake on the down side and bubbles start to appear. When brown and crispy remove pizza raw side down on plates, dress with sauce and toppings then slide back onto grill and bake the raw side till done...going through the same steps... best PIZZA EVER !!!!

I've never made pizza from scratch before so this was my first dough attempt and let me just say I have NEVER done a review until now! My pizza is delicious, flavorful and fluffy! Like one of the other raters, I added garlic powder to it and preheated the dough for 8 minutes before adding my toppings so it cooked evenly. Oh my gosh so good I'm trying not to eat the whole thing by myself (good luck) amazing recipe thanks!

I made this up so quick and easy, the best recipe I have tried for pizza dough yet! As I read in one review, I added extra flour and baked it at 400F for about 15 minutes only as I rolled it out to a thin crust. I don't think I would attempt this without bread flour because it turned out so well.

The proportions of water to flour in this recipe didn't work for me. I had to add another cup of flour to make it workable and it was still sticky. Once that's adjusted, it's a nice dough. I rolled it quite thin and it didn't get soggy with the toppings.

This dough was sticky and I added extra flour, it ended up rising well and was plain, like bread.... I made it again today. I used 3/4c. Water instead and I added thyme and garlic powder. I used the corn meal on the pan as well. I baked it for 25 minutes. It made one medium pizza and my kids enjoyed it.

Crust tasted great! To keep it from getting soggy I baked it at 400 for a couple minutes before putting on the toppings, just enough to get it firm, and baked it directly on the oven grates. The prebake made sure nothing fell through.

My family loved it :) ?? I added garlic powder and Provençal herbs. I followed everything else exactly using my Breville stand mixer. To speed up the rise, I placed the bowl with the dough over another bowl filled with hot water :) made two pizzas!

This is my go to recipe for pizza dough.  I have used it many times and it always comes out perfect.  Not too thick but nice and chewy on the inside.  It is easy to prepare and always tastes great.

Perfect, everybody loves it, I made 4 times this recipe and got 3 beautiful thick crust pizzas.  I left the dough rising in the pan for about 20 minutes before putting it in the oven, this made a nice and airy crust.

I doubled it, because I like thick dough.  Also, because it was sticky, I used a lot of extra flour when rolling it out.  I topped it with leftover spaghetti sauce.  Yum.

The taste is actually worthy of 5 stars, but I knocked it down by 1 as the 2 cups of bread flour are just not enough. Thankfully, I was prepared after reading other reviews. For me, it was closer to 3 cups with everything else remaining the same as originally written. Still it was a little sticky, though with a heavily floured surface the dough rolled pretty well. Getting it off the pizza slide and onto the pre-heated pizza stone was another challenge and I had to do some rearranging of toppings after the force required to move it shifted everything around.....even with heavy cornmeal on the slide.
Bottom line: more flour, heavy surface flour and cornmeal to get your pizza off the slide and this recipe is a winner. Very tasty, great texture and crisped up nicely. Easy to make and far better than store-bought.

This recipe turned out just fine, even though I only had regular flour. I added an Italian-esque spice mix right into the dough (herbs in the dough is an easy way to amp up a basic crust) and rolled this out very thin and it behaved nicely.

This is very good dough!  I used honey instead of sugar.  And at the final phase I did not use flour or roll the dough out.  It was so soft and gooey good!  I sprayed my pan, put oil on my hands and mashed the dough on to the pizza pan. It was great!

Easy to make, basic dough. Make sure you have an ample supply of flour when turning out and rolling out. Cooked it on a tripled up piece of foil, and it finally cooked through after around 35 min. Yum!

No problem at all for me. Added a bit more flour to the dough as many others have done. Placed all the ingredients into my stand mixer with a dough hook attachment and just let it do the work! Easy! Extremely hands free. After which I placed the bowl in an oven which was heated for 10 seconds and then switched off, with a bowl of water and left my dough covered in there. After 30 mins, it came out beautifully risen. The dough was easy to work with and didnt stick to my pan (most likely because mine was non stick). The pizza dough came out delicious, together with the extra toppings I had! Thanks for the recipe.

This was really easy and turned out great! My husband loves it. The only problem I had was it stuck to the pan when I cooked it ( my fault
for using a older pan and not spraying it).I used a Pesto for the sauce and added fresh tomatoes, basil and Goat Cheese for the toppings .
Then lightly drizzled with Basamic vinegar and good olive oil. YUMMY !

This is the easiest quickest pizza dough recipe ever!!  I find the dough is sticky, but it helps it come into a ball without kneading for ages.  I only spend 10 seconds kneading it and then add oil to the same bowl to put it back and let rise.

Great crust. I've made it several times and have let the dough be sticky. I add some cornmeal as I'm smoothing out the crust to fit the perforated pizza pan and then place the pan on the preheated pizza stone. This makes the bottom of the crust nice and crispy. I bake at 450 for about 18 minutes.

Dough was too sticky and runny. I made one with whole wheat flour and it turned out better then using 2 cups of bread flour. After baking, it tasted good but was a little too flimsy in the center for chicken topping.

I loved this! Made calzones with it last night and it came out great. I substituted the olive oil with vegetable oil because that is what I have, and added Italian herbs to it. I will definitely be making this versitile recipe again.

This is the recipe!  I went for 400 degrees and cook it about 26 minutes.  Pizza crust was cooked through, crisp, and evenly brown on the bottom.

Add some Italian seasonings for extra kick.

I made this recipe last Sunday for my kids and they love it. The pizza crust turned out perfectly. I agreed with other reviews that need to add more of flour, I added +50-75g of bread flour and use my Kitchen Aid mixer to mix all the ingredients.

Excellent.  Used it for calzones and garlic knots. Half bread flour and half whole wheat.  Rolled it out thin.  I did let it rise twice though.  Nice crispy crust.

I used this recipe last week and absolutely LOVED it! I never cook from scratch but this was so easy I thought I'd try. I followed the recipe EXCEPT I used all purpose flour because that's all I had. Also, I let the dough rise while I took my daughter to gymnastics then came back and finished the recipe. It was tasty and not too thin or thick. I used it to make breakfast pizza and topped it with bacon, sausage, scrambled eggs and shredded cheese! EVERYONE RAVED about how good it was! Thanks!

Easy to make and it made a nice crust. Followed the recipe as it is. Only deviate from the directions given. After I formed the dough after it rises, I put it into the preheated oven for about 5 mins. Then took it out and put all the goodies on top. Then bake the pizza. My 9year old loved it!  Will definitely make this again.Thank you so much for the share :D

I usually don't write reviews if I have changed the recipe but this time I am , not big changes . When I did my yeast in the water I only used 1/4 cup of water & 1 tsp sugar because that's what the yeast called for . Plus I didn't know if I really was going to need the whole cup of water after reading the reviews .  I made it early in the afternoon and let it sit and rise until I was ready to make my pizza (about 3 hours ). It was a very nice light crust so I was happy . Of course the  oven temp was 425 degrees . Will use it again .

I was in need of a fast easy recipe. So I went to my laptop and goggled "easy pizza dough." And I am so thankful to have been lead to the All recipes site. I picked the first dough recipe I saw and I am now a devoted fan to it. The dough was easy to make. And working it was a pleasure. My family absolutely loved the taste. Perfect dough. Wish I would have taken a few pictures of it. Next time.

Easy! And turn out nice on my first try! I added herbs to the dough too. Heeded advice from other reviewers a little less water a little more b. flour. The crust was soft n crispy on the outside! I halfed the recipe and the dough fitted my cookie sheet pan just nice :-) yummy!

I like the simplicity of this pizza dough. I usually top it with a white cream sauce, add whole garlic cloves, crushed walnuts, skinned sliced pears, chevre, fresh rosemary, and top it all off with a mixture of mozzarella/parmesan cheeses and 1 or 2 random fruit flies that fly into the oven. The fruit flies really make it!

I use this recipe all the time... BUT I am pretty confused that people find the dough workable with 1c water and 2c flour. It's a batter! I add more flour, just enough so I can get it from the bowl to the pan with my hands, but still very sticky--NOT a traditional pizza dough. This is with about 3/4-1c more flour than the recipe states. I don't get it! But with the flour to produce something other than a batter, it's a great flavored dough, and I am able to make the cracker-thin crust I prefer, if I want to.

I really Liked this dough, but I made some common-sense changes. I cooked mine at 425 degrees- 350 is just not hot enough for a good pizza crust. Also, I thought the dough was a touch too sticky and had to knead in about a cup (2 pizzas) of flour, maybe a little more. After that it turned out to be the BEST dough I've ever made, so I really don't have any true complaints.

Very easy to make - dough cooks up nicely. I added some spices as this recipe is bland in flavor - spices really kicked it up. I have a gas stove and it really needed 25 minutes at 450 (the dough wasn't quite ready at 20)...but I'll make it again. I made a fresh pesto to use as the sauce and it was a hit in my house - my 16 month old and husband devoured it!

Turned out wonderfully.  I tossed in some Italian seasonings as I mixed it up (one of those Mrs. Dash bottles--so fancy) to make it a little more exciting, and did end up letting it rise for most of the day.  It was so easy to mix up.  I'll definitely be using this recipe again.

There is too much oil in here and not enough flour. I had a lot of trouble getting it to rise and it did not fair well in the oven either. I should have known when I was rolling it out and it kept falling apart. I have never had an issue with other pizza dough recipes, but this hardly resembled pizza dough to me. More like a chewy bread-like substance once cooked.

Easy, quick, and delicious. Added extra flour and dried oregano. I dug through all my recipes and couldn't find this one, so I printed it again. That's how good it is. It has the perfect texture- chewy but tender.

This is the first time ever that I have attempted to make pizza from scratch. After having read different pizza dough's recipes, I decided to make this one. I went ahead and added 1 tablespoon of Italian spices and substituted the olive oil with Garlic oil. After mixing in the bread machine (had to add about 3 tsps of flour), then let it rest for 40 minutes, I put my pizza stone in the oven for 10 minutes at 400 degrees. I placed the dough only on the pizza stone for 10 minutes and then took it out to put the ingredients; the sauce, mushrooms, pepperoni and cheese. Baked for another 10 minutes. It was perfect! My picky husband liked it and actually asked for more. lol  Can't wait to make it again next week.

This was a pretty good dough. I adjusted a little bit for altitude and it worked fine. Here's how it really worked though. Let us start with that I'm a single Dad. How easy is it for me to phone in a pizza. Pretty easy. I don't because I can make about 30% MORE pizza for about HALF the price. And it's fun. So I doubled the recipe. 4 12" pizzas. Pizza #1 forgot to pre-heat the pizza stone ... baked for 20 broiled for 4. A little floppy but not bad. Pizza #2 Stone heated ... bad job rolling out the dough ... baked for 20 broiled for 4. Still a little floppy but better. Pizza #3 LOL Left oven on broil after pizza #2 for 10 minutes with door closed. Baked for 15 and broiled for 2 really good. Pizza #4 The stone is heated. The oven is at 350. The dough is rolled out just so fine, like perfect. I think to myself, "Scott, Let's have some fun with this." So, the stone is at the perfect temperature. I gently lay the dough. I assemble the pizza. And ... 5 minute broil, 20 minute bake at 350 and a 3 minute broil to finish it off. BEST PIZZA EVAR!!!!!!

THIS recipe is way too sticky. Go with the reviews — it doesn't need a full cup of water. I added what I thought would be plenty extra flour and still couldn't begin to keep it from gluing itself to everything it touched. I may try it again, but with much less H2O.

This is excellent and so quick to make. I thought I would be making the day I prepared but plans changed and I threw it in the fridge and baked it the next day. I paired this with the allrecipes Exquisite Pizza Sauce recipe (which was fabulous). As a side note, I made a second dough, because I was worried the first dough wouldn't be good (didn't put in air tight container when put in fridge), and saved it byputting in the freezer. If I remember I will put an update on that when I try the frozen batch.

Best and easiest dough recipe ever!  I have never tried making my own dough before and this was so easy.  Followed other reviews and added 1/2 cup more flour and basil in the dough.  My husband loves it and he is a way better cook than I am.

After combining all the ingredients, I got sticky goo, as some other reviewers have said. 2 cups of flour to 1 cup of water is simply not enough flour. It takes another 1/2-1 full cup of flour to make a ball of dough every time I try this recipe.

I usually make Italian bread or French bread and use that as a crust but thought I'd try this pizza dough recipe. I know how to make breads and use yeast but this is soggy and doesn't cook. I used a pizza stone and even cooked it at 400F. I have made many homemade pizzas and never ever had this problem. The crust was cooked in 8 mins! The rest of it is doughy and not fully cooked. I will have to cut the crust off over cover it with foil and cook it on the rack but at this point it's beyond repair tbh. 

I will stick to my French bread and Italian bread recipes and use those as pizza crusts. They taste much better and cook without being soggy!

Very good and easy.  PrebAke crust for 10 mins.  Add toppings and bake at 450 degrees.  Slide off pan to rack about midway through for crispy bottom.

maybe it was me but it was too hard and had a strong Yeast smell. I followed the advice of other reviews and let it rise for longer(4hrs)but other then that i followed it exactly.

This dough always turns out great for me. I add at least 1/4 cup more flour and some rosemary for flavor, as well as brush the outer crust lightly with olive oil. After spreading it onto the pan I let it bake for a couple minutes to avoid sogginess. It puffs up and has a pretty fluffy texture. I love it because most doughs require a very long time to rise, but this one is done in a jiffy!

I used regular flour instead of bread flour and it turned out fine. Because this isn't a really stiff dough, I was able to make it into a lovely thin crust for my pizza. It was lovely and not overly yeasty like some homemade dough can be

Fabulous and easy!  My first pizza dough ever and no need to search for a different recipe.  I did use all purpose flour and also added 1 tsp of garlic powder and 2 tsp of italian seasoning for extra flavor.  Yum!

This is the best, easiest pizza dough I've ever made, and tasted better than delivery. As other reviewers have stated, it is a sticky dough and I did add more flour just enough to make it ball up in the Kitchen Aid with a  dough hook attachment. I did use BREAD flour and I think it made a huge difference! The dough was light, tender and so delicious- I'm so happy I went ahead and bought the bread flour just for this recipe. Also, I did allow it to rise for about 4 hours. It definitely doubled, maybe tripled in size, and I did not knead it at all, just dumped it out on the floured surface and started pressing it out- it was very easy to work with. Thank you so much for this recipe.

This is our "go to" pizza crust recipe.  We have used it for years and have been very happy.  I usually dont' have bread flour on hand so use 1 C regular flour and 1 C whole wheat flour.  I also like to add garlic powder and dried oregano or basil to the dry ingredients for added flavor.  Cornmeal on the bottom of the crust is also a nice touch.  I have found that it can be doughy even if you cook it for 22 minutes but pre-cooking the dough for 5-7 minutes before you add any toppings does the trick! As with most doughs, the more you make it the better it will be.

Love this always turns out great. I let it rise for a while longer than 30 mins it makes it taste slightly better and develops a different flavor. We love that we can make two small pizzas a normal one with sauce and things and then a white pizza. Perfect for two people and i love that you can roll it out as thin or thick as you like. I do sprinkle corm meal on the bottom if you dont there is flour left over on the bottom.

Very easy & has a good chew/bite to it. I cranked up the oven when I preheated it to 475 degrees, then lowered it to bake the pizza.

Excellent pizza - I added 1 tbsp of dried oregano too. We cut the dough into 3 pieces and kneaded the. Into balls to rise. Then we rolled them out thinly with a rolled edge crust, then baked 6-7 minutes at 550 on a cookie sheet, then transferred onto a wire rack to cook for the final 2 minutes - absolute perfection.

For the users adding extra flour - keep in mind of your climate. I used the exact measurements and duted my board to knead in maybe an extra tablespoon or two due to our humid climate out east. The dough SHOULD be a touch stickier than usual, as you want it to be moist.

Id like to add that you should mix the sugar in with your yeast when you are proofing it - I added some garlic & herbs too - it was a dream crust !

This recipe worked out pretty good for me. I had to add extra flour (1/2 cup) & i used all purpose flour -still a great dough.  It puffed out nicely, and came off the pans perfectly (greased with olive oil). I also liked how the pizza crust  turned out to be sturdy but soft. Great recipe. Nice and simple.

Very good crust, used whole wheat bread flour instead of white.
Used a pizza stone - pizza needed between 25 - 30 minutes cook time.

We LOVED this recipe!  Of course there were changes... but nothing big.  I didn't have bread flour, so I added a tbsp of vital wheat gluten.  My kitchen was cold and time was short, so I put the dough into the pre-warmed oven to rise for a bit.  I sprayed my pan with butter-flavored spray and sprinkled cornmeal on that; then formed my crust,covered it with plastic wrap and let it rise like that until I was ready to top it.  I topped it with "extra" Walmart brand (Great Value)pizza sauce ammended with garlic powder and a dash of leftover spaghetti sauce.  On top of the sauce I added shredded mozzarella, a maple sausage patty diced into tiny pieces, sliced sandwich ham, finely sliced onion, dried oregano, 3 (yes three) thinly sliced white mushrooms, and a small handful of sliced black olives and a teensy bit more cheese.  It was a "leftovers" pizza and it was FABULOUS!!! 
I was told that it was the BEST pizza that I've ever made and that there is no way that I'll ever be able to make another one as good. LOL  Ahh... a challenge!

I had to change a few things on this, but it's an OK base recipe. I had to add almost 3/4 of a cup of extra flour, bake it at 400 instead of 350 to avoid the middle getting soggy ... and I also recommend putting the sugar in with the warm water and yeast to help the yeast rise more. I've always been taught to bake bread that way and I just find it works better.

Very good recipe.Good just the way it is. I didn't make any changes like to many people do. If you change a recipe is it the same recipe? Maybe if it didn't turn out good,it's not the recipe. Any way thanks for the recipe.

I had to add quite a bit more flour during the mixing process as it was really slimey and sticky but it baked really nice and tasted very authentic.

I don't know how others rated this so high because if you follow the instructions exactly, it leaves a very sticky dough that is IMPOSSIBLE to make into a pizza crust. I gave it 3 because it is a good base. It needs 1/2c more flour to make manageable. It also needs at least 1 tsp garlic powder to make it delicious. In addition, pizza crusts NEED a pizza stone to eliminate sogginess. Bake at 425 for 10 minutes on the stone and the pizza come out to perfection. With these changes, this crust was really very good and my husband said he wouldn't mind me using this recipe again. Thanks!

This dough is soft and tastes great: however the alterations I made were as follows: 

Add 1/2 tbsp sugar with yeast and warm water (and then add the remaining sugar later on with the flour and salt). Before you put the pizza on the pan to bake it it is important to aerate the rolled out dough by pricking the dough with a fork all around it.  I also made sure to lightly oil the pizza pan to avoid sticking and baked it at 375 for 20 minutes. It turned out perfect! My husband and son LOVED the pizza. This recipe will definitely be used in our home often!

Overall this easy peasy pizza crust is GREAT!  I was able to get 3 very nice 14" pizzas out of this one batch! This is a great easy recipe but I did have to add 1/4 cup extra of flour. To add a little extra touch, I also added a bit of garlic powder & italian seasoning.  Thank you for a GREAT quick & easy recipe!!

I made this recipe, following the instructions, and it turned out wonderfully! For those having issues, make sure your flour and yeast are at room temperature before use.

Added some rosemary and oregano, turned out very well for my first pizza in Thailand. Cut the recipe down a bit since the pans (and my convectional oven) are quite small. Added some olive oil to a bag and saved in the fridge for next time.

As many other reviews have mentioned, the flour to water ratio is off. Not just a little off, but VERY. You will need to add nearly one cup more flour, or reduce the water by 1/2 cup. Or do yourself a favor and make Pizza Dough I from this site, which has correct ingredient amounts, and is very good.

This is a fantastic Pizza dough. Family and myself ate it up. I should have doubled the recipe, we all wanted more. 
I also added 1/4 cup more flour to the recipe. I had no problem with the the crust being soggy on the bottom, like I see in other ratings. I watched how much sauce I put and I made sure I baked It until the crust was brown on the bottom. I did this by lifting the egde of the pizza up with a spatula.

Perfect for the bread machine.  So easy, just let the machine do it's thing, then put a bit of olive oil in a ziploc bag, pop the dough in, and refrigerate until dinner.  I've let it sit overnight and the dough is even better!  I use instant yeast, you don't have to proof - just throw everything in the bread machine and you're good to go!

So simple, so good! I use a little olive oil on a deep dish pan. This crust can handle heavy toppings and still hold up.

This was a fun and easy recipe to follow. Its all about balance, use extra flour if needed, leave to rise a little longer, cooking is all about fun. I added a few herbs and some garlic to my dough. I will say that you will need to adjust your cooking times and heat due to elevation, but try it hotter, colder shorter and longer until its perfect for you

This was my first ever attempt at making pizza dough at home. i followed all the instructions, except, I only waited about 5 minutes after I mixed the yeast w/warm water (recipe says abt 10 min). I made 2 small pizzas, I had some trouble with shaping/rolling my dough, but I think that is more due to my skill than the recipe itself. Also, I baked my pizza on the back side of a cookie sheet at a 400 degrees, for about 17 minutes. The crust was perfectly done, it was crisp too, but not super crisp, which is exactly what I wanted. I am soo impressed! The crust tasted really good too! Will certainly make again!

Amazing recipe.

I've made this repeatedly over the past two weeks. As usual the biggest point is prepping the yeast properly. 

I added more flour since tacky dough doesn't roll out well.

I used perforated nonstick pizza pans at 360 degrees with both loaded and skimpy toppings. 25 min bake time, but delicious and perfect every time.

I personally like to add a bit more sugar to the recipe. The sweetness helps offset the yeasty flavor and woprks well with salty toppings. I make a ranch sauce that is absolutely amazing with this dough!

1 Cup Milk
4 oz of Cream Cheese
1/2 stick butter
1 Ranch seasoning packet (for making ranch dip/dressing)
Parmesan Cheese

Melt the Cream cheese and Butter in a sauce pan while the dough is rising. Once malable, add the milk and seasonings. Once thoroughly mixed add parm cheese till desired thickness.
SMOTHER the dough!
The more the merrier it seems.
I think I will try adding some additional garlic salt to the sauce in the future. I love to experiment :)

Ok, it's baking now, so I can't say how the texture turned out. Easy, quick, no brainer recipe. This is my first time making my own pizza crust, and by the looks in the oven, it is amazing. Beautiful crust that is setting up very nicely. Thanks, I hate to think of all the money over the years I could have saved making my own pizza crust/pizza.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars because I had to tweak it in the middle of making. Other than this, I followed the recipe to a tee, which I believe you have to do for a proper review. Anyways, I let the dough rise for 30 minutes, only the dough did not really rise. I needed to get it rolling, but before it was even pliable enough to get out of the bowl I had to add in about a cup of flour. It rolled out great, baking was a little bit of a different story. I put it in the oven at 400 degrees for 20 min as another reviewer suggested and glad I did. After this I took it out and cut it into fourths, seeing that it was still not cooked enough, I put it back in at 350 for another 5-10 minutes checking it. The toppings were cooked before the dough but it still came out good. We like our crust to be soft so it was perfect, but if you like crispy crust, you'll have to tweak it even more.

I've made many of pizza dough at culinary school and this recipe works just as well as those. If you find yourself with a sticky dough just add a little more flour until it is workable. Don't use less water. It needs all of the yeast. It was quick and easy.

My family loved this recipe! Of course I tried to make it a bit healthier, and substituted 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour in the mix. Even still, the dough was a bit soft & needed about 1/4 cup more flour. We tried it with a cream of mushroom sauce, roma tomatoes, chicken, & feta cheese. But the next time we try it out, we're planning on trying it with a traditional red sauce & pepperoni. Should taste great!

Very good and easy to make. Will make again, although I am still on the hunt for a 5-star crust.  Everyone liked this one.  :)

This is a great recipe and the dough is delicious! I read the earlier comments about needing to add more flour and I found that if you kneed the dough for about 5 minutes it becomes stiffer and you don't need to add anything, it's perfect!
Thank you for sharing this recipe  :)

Tasted great! As mentioned the dough was a bit wet; next time I will add more flour, but I hope it doesn't get tough since this consistency tasted perfect when baked. I also baked it at 400+ as other reviewers recommended, and I think brushing the pie with a little oil before adding the sauce helped it from getting too soggy. 

I like to knead some herbs right into the dough (sage, rosemary, thyme etc.).  I topped with marinara sauce and vegetables roasted in the oven in oil and more spices (garlic powder, basil, oregano, red pepper). Came out great, I would make it again!

One side note is that I tend to make a lot of food and microwave to reheat - this is not a great recipe for that. I'd rather leave dough in the fridge for the next day, or make the pizza and freeze it uncooked, as microwaving made it very soft.

The pizza dough was awesome. I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour, because we never have any in the house. I did have to add a bit extra flour so that the dough was not as sticky. I also added 1tbsp of Italian seasoning and 1tsp of garlic salt. All in all this recipe is a winner.

I followed every step in this recipe and it turned out great. You do not need extra flower if you turn the dough onto a well floured surface. The dough stretched nicely and was not a fight to get to the pan size. Thanks!!!

the recipe is good but what is missing is that you have to poof the yeast meaning in the 1 cup of very warm water add the active yeast with the 2 teaspoons of sugar and wait like 4 mins or until it forms bubles and then add it to the flour and sometimes it takes  2 hours for it to double in size hope that helps  you

Didn't work at all. The crust was bland. I wish i had reead some reviews, as i too had trouble with the dough being way to sticky, i added about 1/2 - 1 cup during rolling, don't think i will make again. Sorry. (Huge chance that it was opperator error.)

Soooooo good!  You MUST use bread flour.  We first used all-purpose, because we didn't have the other, which was okay, but with the bread flour, it's AMAZING. I also used 3/4 of a cup of water and spices: 1 tbsp garlic powder, 1 tsp of thyme, and 2 tsp of italian seasoning) as suggested by another reviewer.  We make it with the Homemade Pizza Sauce on this site.  DELISH!

I made this dough last night.  Fantastic! Easy to stretch to fit my pan (I used a cookie sheet).  
I did however need to add slightly more (1/4 cup) flour.  For the future, I would make it earlier in the day to let it rise more.

Used all purpose flour and it came out a bit sticky; problem solved by adding a tiny bit more flour  to the mix and using flour on hands.  Tasters didn't like how thick the crust came out even though i rolled it until it was thin and even.  Not perfect, but pretty  delicious.  Beats any fake tasting store bought frozen pizza. I'd make it again.

The dough came out too soft in the middle. I think the problem was that there was too much oil. Next time i will try making it without the olive oil.

this crust turned out great! so light and crisp and yummy! i doubled the recipe for two large pizzas. on one i had light toppings and only a little bit of cheese, it was ready after about 20 mins. however, the other pizza i topped with more sauce, loads of meats and cheese for my meatlover boyfriend.. it took almost 40 mins!! if you are worried about the crust turning out soggy just make sure you check for nice golden brown bottom before you take out of oven. :) enjoy!

So I tried this recipe out the 1st time following the advice in previous reviews to add more flour. I made my 1st ever pizza but the crust was too dry and hard for my taste
I then made another pizza, following the exact recipe. The dough was runny & sticky but the final crust was AMAZING. Reminded me of Papa Johns which I love.

If you like your pizza soft crust, be ready to flour your finger tips before every touch of the dough
I found it best to place the dough directly on to the oven tray before attempting to manipulate or add toppings

Have fun

I really liked this recipe!  So simple and easy and it had a good taste.  I made a breakfast piazza with this dough, everyone had seconds. I did have to bake it an additional 10 minutes but overall it was great.

The dough was really soft, and I had a hard time getting it to roll out on my counter. I ended up rolling it on my pizza stone, luckily it didn't stick. As far as flavor goes. It was fine. Nothing special, but it wasn't a bad flavor. Pretty middle of the road.

Love this easy pizza dough.  I used to prebake it before adding toppings, but this time I cooked it at 400 without the prebake, and it was perfect.   I usually make a double batch and it seemed less sticky.  I had to add quite a bit of flour before rolling it out on a single batch.

So this was my second time using this recipe and I had to add quite a bit of flour for it to be not sticky, but it came out pretty awesome. It's great for a basic pizza dough recipe and I will probably tweak it as I keep making it, adding spices because without them it's pretty bland, but it's pretty magnificent all around.

Today i made this as an experiment, and also as a quick dinner option. It wasn't very quick and took much longer to rise. While the texture was great, the dough was very salty for some reason though i added the appropriate amount. I would recommend this recipe with some revision such as adding more flour, not adding salt or very little and putting dough in the lowest possible heat of your oven to quicken the rising process. It is a good start of a recipe but definitely needs to be more developed.

I made the recipe as is stated.  Only flour I added was while kneading the dough.  Baked at 400 degrees on a pizza stone for 13 minutes.  Added the cheese to the top of the pizza and baked another 5 minutes.  It turned out perfect !!!!

There is either not enough flour in this recipe or too much water.  Following this recipe exactly does not yield "a stiff dough".  It was runny and jiggly like Jello.  I had to add approximately another 3/4 cup of flour just to get the dough stiff.  I'm glad this is not my first experience with yeast bread so I knew what the dough was supposed to look like.  After the extra flour was added, the dough turned out very nice.  It had a pleasant texture and cooked up perfectly.  This recipe just needs to be modified a little.  Also the recipe does not state how big to make your pizza crust.  I made mine about 12" in diameter.  I imagine that if you make it bigger you should not cook it quite so long and if you made it smaller you should give it a little longer to cook as it would be thicker.

I've never made pizza dough before, and I've never used yeast in any dish yet.  I tried this recipe today for the first time and it was so easy and so good.  To be sure that the dough cooked thoroughly, I slipped the pizzas (I made 2 9-inch pizzas) into a 325 oven for about 5 minutes and let them cool before I added my toppings.  I was able to refrigerate the pizzas until dinner time & cooked them at 400 for about 25 minutes.  Perfection!

I have been making this all summer and now its fall! I always add garlic powder, dried oregano and use half white flour and half whole wheat. Its a great recipe only criticism is that the crust/dough is very crusty after baking. It is not as fluffy as I like it to be but nonetheless I have made this more than 6 times this summer.
Thanks!

This recipe has so many problems for me. I can't understand the high rating. 
The dough turned out way too sticky. I had to add another 3/4 cup of flour. 350 is too low to cook a pizza. And it took about 2 hours for this dough to double in bulk. As for the flavor, not at all impressed.

I can't believe how many good ratings this recipe has. Maybe it's because I used a bread machine but the dough came out as almost liquid. I had to add so much flour just to get it out of the bowl. I baked the crust for about 5 min on 400 and then once I put the toppings on baked for 20. It was very doughy and needed to be cooked a lot longer but my kids were starving so we ate it. It may taste ok with some tweaking but as is this recipe is not to my liking.

Love this pizza dough!  I messed it up the first time because I followed the directions here instead of on the yeast packet but other than that I have made it many times and its been a hit - simple, easy, (almost) fool-proof and delicious!

I'v made lots of pizza crusts and this one is THE BEST! BONUS: It is also the simplest I've ever made. I add spices to the crust but don't have to, equally delicious. The adjustments are add more flour as needed (I ended up adding just under 2 cups extra) and no need to pre-bake. 400f for 20 mins and as soon as you see a hint of light brown on the bottom, she's done!

The recipe doubles fine. Followed exactly except added 1/4 cup of the bread flour. Don't skip the step of letting the yeast sit for 10 minutes. If you roll it out to the thickness that will cover the majority of a cookie sheet, then it will cook in the 20 minute time frame. I used my stand mixer and let it kneed the dough for about 5 minutes. Corn meal on the pan helped it not to stick because it's a pretty sticky dough. My husband and sons said it was the best pizza dough ever. Oh yes, and I substituted half the olive oil for garlic-infused olive oil to give it a little flavor. I'm going to try it for bread sticks sometime.

This is my very first time pizza, what a great recipe! i added some cinnamon to the dough and fantastic. i use 70% high protein  flour and 30% medium. don't forget one thing, don't add water all in one time. add little and add some more till the dough firm.

I immedialely added more flour between 1/4 to 1/2 c. flour after I read the reviews.  I also changed the cooking temp from 350 to 400 (200 C) and the dough came out cooked perfectly.  I did not pre-bake, but, I did do the full 1 hour rise, punch down, rise again then form and bake.  i baked for about 25 minutes on teh lowest part of my oven (closest to the heat source). The dough itself is a little bland and in future I would add my own spices (garlic, rosemary), but, this is just personal preference on my part.  It makes a lovely crust on a 15 in round with holes in it, somewhere between thin and thick crust, though it's neither.

I found this recipe to be quick and easy, producing a tasty pizza base.  The dough felt quite dry but actually tasted fine and was easy to roll.  I stuck to the recipe, using wholewheat bread flour for a more rustic taste.

This recipe turned out better than any other pizza crust recipe I have ever tried before. I followed the advice of others and used 2.5 cups of flour instead of 2 cups. Overall, the crust turned out very soft and chewy. I baked it for 22 minutes at 350F. I will definitely used this recipe again!

I have tried many pizza dough recipes and this was by far my family's favorite.  I made this exactly as suggested and my seven year old liked it better than carry out.  I will definitely make again and maybe try substituting some whole wheat flour.

I made this for the first time after reading the other reviews.  It turned out fantastic!  I added a bit more flour and used my mixer.  The dough was really soft but in 30 minutes had risen perfectly.  When rolling out I used a lot of flour as the recipe suggests.  It was perfect with a crunchy outside and soft inside, done all the way through and held several toppings without falling apart.

Perfect! Exactly what I needed. Next time I'm going to prebake just the crust for about 5 minutes so that it cooks all the way without burning the cheese. Last time I made breadsticks with the leftover dough, and it was SO DELICIOUS with just butter and garlic.

This is a good, basic dough.  It needed about 1/2 cup more flour, though.  I made it into a Chicago deep dish and had no problems with it cooking through.  Next time I may use honey instead of the sugar.

Based on this recipe, I have to give this a low raiting.  The water/flour ratio is off.  It should be one cup of water, 1 and 1/4 cup of flour.  If not your dough would not work out.  Once that is corrected I would give this a very high raiting, pizza was great.

Perfect.  Dough was a little sticky buy I sprinkled flour on it and it was the best pizza dough I've made.  Will definitely use this recipe for pizza crust from now on.  I didn't roll it, I sprayed it with Spam and used my hands to press it out.  I'm going to try it for Calzones and bread sticks too.  Thanks for posting this.

I give this recipe 4 stars because they did not explain how to properly rise the yeast or the dough.  You need to add the yeast to half a cup of luke warm water not hot water and it needs to sit for 15 min (I also add the sugar in with the yeast). The yeast should foam up to the brim of the cup and if it doesn't you've done something wrong.  You should let the dough rise, punch it down and then let it rise again.  It takes some time but If you do not do this your dough will not turn out right.

I used regular flour and next time I'll try it with bread flour...hopefully it will be a thinner crust.  It definitely needed an extra half cup of flour.  I listened to another reviewer and put on a light layer of sauce and it was way too light, next time I'll use more.  I had no clue how to spread out this dough by hand...so I found a great video on youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoC4aEQ20do . The pizza took about 30 mins to cook.  It tasted really good, I'd be curious to try this with some seasoning added. UPDATE: The bread flour made a huge difference.  I also used cornmeal on the pan to keep the dough from sticking.

I made this pizza crust as a last second option for my two kids and two more kids I was babysitting.  It was the first time I've ever made pizza dough from scratch and it was unbelievably easy and turned out PERFECT.  I did add about 1/2 more bread flour because it seemed very sticky, and my pizza pan has holes in it so it makes for a nice crisp crust.  It made a nice very large pizza and the edges were thick and fluffy.  I was so impressed at how easy this was and how great it turned out.  Perfect for first time pizza dough makers!! :)

I made this last night for dinner and it was my second attempt at home made pizza crust. First time didn't work at all, so I searched for a new recipe. This one was so easy and extremely delicious. I added the 1/4" cup extra flour and the dough was perfect. It made a very large pizza enough for 3 adults or maybe more. Next time I am going to cut the dough in half frezze half and only make enough for me and my husband. Not that the left overs weren't devored by my husband this morning at breakfast. I will be making this again very soon and often.

This was so easy, and it came out perfectly.  The only two adjustments I made were to add more flour throughout the kneading process and to cook it at 400 for about 15 minutes.  Also, be sure to grease your pan or add extra flour before baking or else the pizza can stick.  Overall though, this was easy and tasty :)

Great recipe!  I mixed it in my bread machine on the dough setting.  I didn't even let the yeast dissolve in the warm water first.  I just put it in the pan in the following order: water, salt, oil, flour, sugar, yeast.  The only change I had to make was to add 1/3 cup of flour.  And I just used regular flour.

I hate giving this such a poor review, and figure my problems MUST be user error. But I followed this recipe to a "T" and ended up with a pizza with burnt toppings while the crust was still uncooked on the topping side. Very frustrating. I feel like perhaps the dough needs to be pre-cooked before adding toppings and hope that fixes things next time.

Took a little longer to cook, but that may just be our oven.  All in all, though, it was great - big thumbs up from our six year old!

We tried this crust and it turned out great! Nice and fluffy, and the best part was that when we re-heated the leftovers the next day, the crust did not get chewy. It was just as good as the night before!

My husband and I make this dough once a week. It makes a nice crispy crust and stays nice and fluffy in the middle. It works great for both thin and thick crust.

It ended up tasting fine in the end, but I had to add nearly a cup of extra flour in order to work with it. I also added some garlic powder to give it some flavour.

I just made this dough and it was very good.  I did add a bit more flour during the needing process.  What I did different this time is I baked it on a pizza stone on a BBQ!!!!  I warmed up the pizza stone on the BBQ to about 375 F and then placed my pizza on it.  Baked it till the crust was golden on the bottom ( you have to check ).  It was baked golden and to perfection.  Finally I found a way to have nicely baked crust!!!

This recipe works every time- but with just a touch more flour in the dough than called for.  I make pizza weekly from scratch- using this exact recipe (which I post in my preschool classroom) with the kiddos.  Fun & easy for them.

Great recipe, but it could use another half cup of flour. It could also be that I am using a bread machine and it changes the consistency. Other than that, one of the better crusts I have made.

I have made this recipe three or four times now and tweaked it a bit - but each effort was successful, there is no need to change the recipe.  Works equally well with whole wheat flour or a mixture of all-purpose and whole wheat.  I have followed others advice - and now cook at 400 degrees - quicker and more evenly cooks the toppings nad the dough.  Also, I bought a large silicone baking matt.  After the dough has risen I grease my hands with olive oil and place the dough in the middle of the matt.  Then I shape the dough into a pizza circle directly on the matt and place the matt and dough into the oven.  This substantially reduces the amount of handling of the dough that you need to do.    For toppings, I mix generic tomato sauce and tomato paste (roguhly 4 to 1 ratio) and add finely chopped parsely and garlic for the sauce.  I have found that for the cheese toppings - hate to say it - but buying pre-shaved mozzarella or other cheese mixings at the store has lead to better pizzas.  I will also carmelize some onions and peppers and cut some pepporoni.  Great PIZZA.

I made it in my bread machine, and had to add apprx 1 1/2 cups flour...it was runny like batter.  It rose beautifully, so I'm hoping it doesn't mess with the taste!

This dough is VERY sticky!  I had to add at least 2 more cups of flour as I was kneading it. Then a little more after it had risen to roll it out. I did eventually get it to work but it was difficult to work with. The dough is almost "fluffy" while you're preparing your pie until you add enough flour and knead the heck out of it. It also doesn't want to cook.  I ended up burning the rest of the pizza before the dough decided to be edible. Even then the thin crust is still soft and white. If you like doughy pizza then this is good for you. (I personally like thin crispy crust).  It does taste good and eventually works if you take the time to play with it but I think I may search for a different recipe.  Until then, this will do just fine.

ngsA good start. I just made it. I should have looked at the reviews more thoroughly. I used all-purpose flour, and 1 cup water was just way too much. I was surprised at how much flour I had to add to the flour after rising, but that was because I hadn't read the reviews. Because so much flour had to be added at the end, and because I didn't do any kneading, the bread came out ok, but dense-like. I cooked it at 350 degrees, but by the time the crust was done, the cheese was over-done. Oh, and I also added 1.5 teaspoons of garlic powder and 1.5 teaspoons of Italian seasoning in the mix.  Here's what I would do next time: 1) add enough flour to the mix the first time to make it kneadable, and then knead for 10 min or so, until it passes the window pane test.  Keep the special seasonings in. 2) Let rise. 3) Spread dough out on cornmeal sprinkled pan. 4) Pre-cook for 7 min at 400. 5) Add topics and then cook until done.

Best pizza dough recipe in the world. It's even better on a pizza stone and the BBQ. Preheat BBQ with Pizza Stone in it to about 350F - 400F. Pizza will take about 5 - 8 minutes and tastes like a million $$.

Mixed this recipe in my bread machine.  Added a about a 1/8 cup of semolina flour. Removed the dough after the first rising.  It worked great! Very easy! Tasted great too!

This is the best pizza dough recipe I've found so far.  It's very tasty and fairly easy.  We've used it time and time again and never been disappointed!  The main alteration we make is with the sugar.  We add the sugar at the beginning to the warm water and yeast.  Yeast likes sugar.  Also, we tried making it with rice flour instead of wheat flour.  It turned out alright, but it didn't keep well.  For gluten free pizza I recommend "Crazy Crust Pizza Dough" on this site.

I think kneading it for a minute or so would give it better texture, but still pretty good recipe as is.

This recipe worked really well for me.  One change that worked well for me was to pre-bake the dough at 400 degrees for 8-10 minutes.  The crust was crispier and the dough didn't get soggy under the toppings.  I doubled it and used a bread machine for mixing, kneading, and rising.  Half of the dough was used immediately and half is in the freezer.

This dough was easy to make and very yummy!  Even when I baked it with toppings on it it did not become soggy.  The one thing I had to do was bake it for an extra 7 minutes because the crust was not golden brown after 20.  The only thing I would recommend is 1) make sure to flour your hands and the baking pan generously since the dough is very sticky! 2) Don't try to handle the dough very much since it is prone to breaking easily (probably why this crust tastes more soft and bread like)--I put it straight into the pan from the bowl and patted it out while flouring both sides and there was still some breakage.  I made barbecue pork and pickle pizza and garlic mozzarella cheese sticks with it.  The cheese sticks were especially good--just put mozzarella cheese and put raw chopped garlic on top with a drizzle of olive oil.

I've been looking for a good pizza dough recipe and this one is it. You don't need to adjust the amount of water or flour -it's perfect. Make sure you knead the dough long enough so that it gets that elasticity that it needs for pizza - it takes at least 10 minutes. This makes very good pizza.

I used a combination of all purpose and wheat flour & was very good.  Also I let the dough continue to rise longer than the 30 minutes and had a nice thick crust.  Baked perfectly in 20 minutes.

I made this crust as directed, and the dough was so soft it was more like a soup. I added bread flour to try to salvage it and after baking it for waaay longer than the recipe calls for it came out just OK.

Great recipe - best pizza dough I have ever made!  I made it just as stated except I put in a 170 degree oven covered for an hour to rise.  It was a little sticky - but turned out awesome.

This is a great tasting dough.  However, I'll have to go easy on the liquid next time.  After I added the cup of warm yeast water, it got kind of gooey.  Other than that, it tastes great.

I like this recipe.  It indeed does make a good crust.  Like so many others though, I did have to add more flour for the amount of water it called for, and even then I found it is was too sticky.  (So much so that I made my husband get it out since I hate stickiness) I also added a few herbs to it.  We always cook our crust most of the way before adding toppings to make sure it cooks evenly through. (Usually about ten or so minutes)  And then we put it back in the oven long enough to melt the cheese.  We also have used a higher temperature than the recipe calls for, (400, or 425, depending on how hot our oven runs that day)  We love this crust! I do highly recommend starting it early because the more you let it rise the fluffier and tastier the crust is

Good dough...but I had to add more than just a 'little' extra flour.  2 cups of flour, and mine still looked like soup.  I would say I added about another cup.  The dough had good taste, and I pre-baked it on my stone at 400 until it was turning a little bit brown, before adding my toppings.

I love this pizza dough. It's always a hit, fluffy and delicious. The only changes I make are to add a touch more flour, but no more than the you would expect with a dough recipe, and also I bake it at 400. Amazing!

This is just the recipe I was looking for.  I doubled everything and baked my pizza for 40 min at 350.  It turned out perfect.  Next time I will try adding a bit more sugar to the flour, but it was tasty and delicious.  I'm off to the store to buy more toppings!!

I've tried making pizza dough numerous times, usually with very disappointing results.  But this was delicious!  I'm looking forward to using the dough for other things as well--garlic knots, calzones, maybe even cinnamon rolls.  It's that good.

We really liked this....I had to add about 1/4 cup more flour, and I added just a shake of oregano into the bread flour mixture.  I also had to bake this for 30 minutes.  This will be our go-to, easy pizza dough recipe.  Thank you.

i used my breadmaker and it was soup, i had to add a whole c of flour and start the cycle over. other than that the flavor and lightness was great. plus, i doubled the recipe, since it said 1 crust. it made enough for 3+ pizzas.

Awesome and easy! I did have to add more flour. I found that this is actually enough for 2 large pizzas if you dont like really thick dough. Also I added italian seasoning to add more taste. Over all GREAT

I really love this dough, I have used it several times and have been successful each attempt. I've made traditional pizzas, a "white" pizza, and BBQ Chicken pizza, it holds up great every time. I actually split it in half for two thinner pizza crusts. Thanks for sharing this.

This is the best pizza dough recipe I've found and I've tried a lot.  I used some of the previous reviewers' suggestions and put olive oil on the pan and sprinkled it with corn meal.  I also had to add a little more flour so the dough was not so sticky.  I didn't pre-bake the crust but baked the whole pizza at 400F.  Excellent!

Superb. The dough seems to lack flour, but it laid down nicely without having that extra thick feel of other doughs. Just what I was going for! I just added a bit more cornstarch than usual to my slip so that it would go into the oven without reshaping. I used all purpose flour and added some more seasonings but it wasn't a must. I sliced off a third of the dough and made breadsticks prior to baking for an app. Great recipe! Best pizza dough yet.

I turned to this recipe as I had left my recipe book at a friend's house.  Mistake.  Despite adding an extra 1/2 cup of flour as recommended by other users, the center crust remained uncooked and could not support the weight of the pizza.  I had to cook for an additional fifteen minutes, by which point the crust was approaching brown and the texture was off.  I am experienced at making pizza dough and this is the first crust that has not turned out well.

Really good dough, however needs to be a tad bit sweeter than the recipe calls for.  The good news is my finicky 7 year old even ate the crust tonight, so definitely kid approved!

I too had to add more flour and just a touch more oil to get this dough to mix well. It tasted fine and I probably will make again with changes.

We used this pizza dough recipe to use christmas left overs of ham and turkey.  We had one topped with Ham, Pineapple & bocconcini and the other topped with turkey, cranberry sauce, camembert and rocket and cooked them on a pizza stone on the kettle bbq .... tasted great  and was so easy ......fantastic!

My husband is a "pizza snob".  He's from New Jersey and insists that only the best pizza and bagels come from New Jersey and New York.  I tried this recipe while he was away and it couldn't be more perfect.  Sooooo easy to make and I added some spices to the dough.  Turned out great.  My crust was a little thicker than I prefer, but I think that's because I'm inexperienced when working with dough of any sort.  I will absolutely experiment with this and prove to him that good pizza can come from Pennsylvania, too!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, I'm elated that I can make homemade pizza!  :)

I loved this dough. I let it rise for an hour instead of 30 min. Added some chopped fresh basil and garlic salt for a little zing - the crowning glory of my Tuesday evening.

I altered the recipe slightly. After combining the yeast and warm water, I let it sit for about 10-15 minutes. Then I added THREE cups of bread flour (you might think its a lot but it works wonders---its less sticky!), 1/2 teaspoon of dried basil, and 1/2 teaspoon of parsley flakes. I let the dough rise for about 30 minutes, punched it down, and let the dough rise again for another 30 minutes. I also set the oven to 400* to get that crispy crust. Wonderful recipe :) Thanks again!

AMAZING!!! The only two things I changed was I used half wheat flour (1 cup white baking flour & 1 cup wheat flour) & added a few spices (garllic powder & oregano).   I cooked for 15 mins because I had wheat flour and man o' man! It was sooo tasty!!! I'll be making this for my family more often. I gave it to my husband, and all of my family inlaws and they all loved it as well, which made me feel nice because this was my 1st pizza I have ever made! :)

The dough tasted ok, but I found I needed to add lots of flour to make this a good consistency to work with.  I doubled the batch, and even after adding more flour, the first serving stuck to my stoneware.  I added even more flour to the second serving and had better luck.  I probably will try a different dough recipe next time.

Very good tasting dough.  It did not rise very well for me - I'm not sure if it's our altitude or the temperature in the house.  Anyway, it was plenty of dough for a medium size and small pizza.  Will use this recipe from now on for pizza night.

A great crust! I doubled and made 2 thick crust 16 inch pizzas. I probably could've done 3 thin crust. I also added 1.5 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp black pepper, and 1 Tbs Italian seasoning.

After making this many times for pizza, I just baked again on a round pan, but plain. Yes, plain on a pizza pan, no sauce, no topping. After cooled, we eat for breakfast spread with butter mixed with marmalade or jam.  Simply amazing.

Sorry, but this recipe was terribly disappointing.  It needed an additional 1/2 c flour to even make it manageable and the outcome was, well, disappointing!  I worked it as thin as possible without tearing but still it baked up wrong.  SUPER bready & thick.  Maybe that's the way it's supposed to be, but not to my taste; sorry!

Absolutely the best pizza dough recipe I've ever used. It's really hard to find a recipe that doesn't make really thick crust.   This crust is thin, but not too thin, crunchy on the outside, and chewy on the inside.   I did also use a pan with holes in it to help with the crisping, though.  Still, it was delicious, and so fast and easy to make. I'm definitely using this recipe any time I make pizza from now on.

Have added this dough recipe to my recipe box.  My husband doesn't like a really thick pizza dough but he doesn't like it thin either.  This was just perfect for my Pampered Chef pizza stone.  Will use it from now on.

I made 3 batches of this and each one needed about 1/4 more flour added. I also added some garlic to the dough. It is easy stuff to work with and comes out with a nice crunch. I did prebake mine for about 5 min at 475 then added the toppings. This is a very easy pizza dough to make and we did enjoy it.

Good recipe, not the best but I will for sure make the changes in another review and then I am sure it will be a 5 star.

I made this twice and both times were disappointments. The dough is way too sticky as written, and it turned out crispy on the edges and way too much like bread in the middle. I spread it out as thin as I could without tearing it but it was still like a pizza bread.

Love it!  After reading the reviews I toss in an extra hand full of flour, and a few herbs.  We split the dough and barbeque it.  All of my kids go crazy for this recipe.

I love the Recipe! It turns out great when being baked with a pizza stone. I cook it at 500 degrees.  The only thing I do different is add more flour. About a quarter cup or so. Some times I'll throw in some minced onions and a pinch of savory and margoram just to mix it up a little bit.

I used my bread machine. Sticky, so I added flour when rolling it out but will try adding a bit more to the recipe next time (as another reviewer stated). Took it from the machine to the pan. My kids loved it. And they are tough critics. One son, who came home after I made it had to be convinced we didn't but it. This one I will keep handy.

This was very good. However, I found the dough wasn't cooked (or even close to being cooked) at 20 minutes. I ended up cooking about 40 mins, and it still wasn't cooked through. Next time i'll actually bake it a bit before putting toppings on it.

I used the same ingredients but after baking for 350 degrees for 20 minutes, I baked it at 450 degrees for about another 20 minutes or until golden for a very flaky and crispy crust.

A little bland so I added some basil and oregano to the dough and little more salt.  Very easy and fast with great texture!  Think hand-tossed dough from Pizza Hut.  Thanks!

This dough was delicious! I substituted garlic salt for regular salt for just a little more flavor and it turned out great and added the extra flour. A great toddler friendly food because the crust ends up still being really soft once it's cooked.

After reading the reviews I started w/2 1/2 cups of flour and did have to add a bit more to make workable dough after rising 1 hour.  Pre-baked 5 mins in 400 degree oven.  Topped w/sauce, mozzerella, pepperoni, italian sausage, onions, mushrooms, and black olives.  I made 3 batches and made 1 thin crust on a large cookie sheet, 1 "hand tossed" type of crust on a small cookie sheet, and 1 batch of breadsticks.  Pizza was really good (even though I forgot to add garlic powder and italian seasoning into the dough) but the bread sticks were only so-so.  After we finished the breadsticks I realized I should have let them rise again after shaping, so no fault of the recipe at all !LOL!  I do suggest starting w/the extra flour and adding seasonings before cooking.  I wouldn't call the crust "dull", but it would have been even better had I remembered to add the seasonings.

I had a tremendous craving for pizza, but being lactose intolerant, I don't often fulfill that craving.  For the topping, I used my non-milk cheese on my half, and hubby used American cheese on his half.  For the crust, with a couple of small changes, I ended up with the best pizza dough in my (limited) repertoire!  I used regular flour, 3/4 cup water, added basil to the dough mixture, and in place of 1 of the tbsps of the olive oil, used 1 tbsp garlic dipping oil.  Crust (with toppings) was baked for about 35 minutes at 350 on a cookie sheet, then I raised the temp to 400 and baked it directly on the oven rack.  Came out great, and hubby and I really enjoyed it!

I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour. Makes a great crisp thin crust :o), when I made a small personal size pizza.  When I made a larger pizza the crust was soggy in the middle.  Even soggy this was a great crust. I have been trying for the last 2 to 3 years to find a quick and easy pizza dough recipe, this one is a keeper.  I can't wait to try it with bread flour, I'm sure with the extra gluten it would make it that much better.

My husband and I made this for dinner, and I was rather underwhelmed, even for something as basic as pizza crust. Read other reviews- you need to back down the water or be prepared to way up the flour, as we had to add about another cup to make it a dough instead of a batter. Also fairly bland, and the texture comes out more like soft bread than pizza crust, even after baking at 400 for 20 minutes.

great pizza dough! I do agree that the dough is a little wet when made as specified. I added about 1/3 cup more flour. The dough was light and fluffy without being overboard- my husband said a lot like digiorno- but better

This was my very first pizza dough! I used all purpose flour and as some suggested I used a bit more than the recipe called for. I let my dough rise for a full hour. I just ran the oven for a bit, shut it off and let the dough rise in there. Once risen I used my dough to make homemade pizza pockets! I used mozaarella, cheddar, pepperoni, and pre-cooked buffalo chicken bites for filling, wrapped the dough around it and glazed everything shut with egg white. I had a little leakage in the oven but that was my fault for not sealing properly. The resulting pockets were lightly crispy on the outside yet soft on the inside! My family loved these so much they ate the first batch immediately and I had to make it twice in one day!

Perfecto!
I added 1 clove of minced garlic and a bit of Italian seasoning to give it a little extra flavour.
I also used this dough to make braided breadsticks and they turned out wonderfully!
Thanks for the recipe.

The dough was sticky, but I added some flour to make it pizza-dough consistancy, then rolled thin on a dark cookie pan.  Had best luck when I baked it for 5 minutes before adding topping - then the cheese was not brown by the time crust was done.  Also found it beneficial to increase the oven temp to around 385 degrees.
This was also delicious as left overs.

I have to admit that I have terrible luck with dough, but I followed the recipe and ended up with a sticky mess.  I even added a cup of extra flour to no avail.  I wanted to give this a great review, but I'm sorry to say this just didn't work for me.

I have to say thank you.. I truly loved this recipe.  The 2nd time - I added a few more seasonings to give it that Italian flavor.  **I added garlic powder, italian seasonings, and crushed basil while mixing the flour mix, and used the Rapid Self-rising yeast. 
This was quick, simple and very delicious.

Yum! Yum! And more Yum! A total winner, and so easy too! I made this as stated except I added 4 tsp vital wheat gluten since I was using all pupose flour instead of bread flour, and it was perfect! I loved the way the crust tasted, it was delicious! This is my new go-to pizza recipe! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

Very good recipe..easy to make.  I didn't have bread flour so I used regular, and it turned out fine.  I also took the advice of some others and added 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder and 1/2 cup more flour....dough is way too sticky otherwise.

This is a great dough.Easy to make-I used rapid rise yeast- and after I mixed it,I left it to rise for a few hours.The dough was light & elastic and easy to work with.If you want a thin crust,make sure to roll it out well.It is delicious.

Very easy directions to follow. Due to phone calls and going out to the store, my dough rose longer than the 30 minutes and it nearly tripled in size.  The pizza base was light and tastey!  I did not have a pizza pan-we rolled it out on a cookie sheet.  I plan to buy a pizza pan for the next pizza which I know there will be many.

Makes a very good crust. I added 1/4 tsp. of italian seasoning and thyme. I'm still working on perfecting the baking time. The first time it was undercooked so the next time I made it I baked the crust half way through then added the toppings.

This was really good homemade dough.  My 6 y.o. loved it so much she asked if we could just have the dough next time w/o the pizza toppings.  I think it would make great breadsticks.  It was a bit too soft for me, which is why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars.

Very easy - tasted great.  Use less water or add more flour.  Raised enough to be good, but not too much so wasn't "bready".

I put ingredients exactly as listed in my bread machine on the dough setting.  It came out wet and soupy.  I had to add a lot more flour than called for to make it even resemble dough.  After the  sugg. 20 min of baking time I had to raise the temp. to 400 and cook longer.  It came out Crunchy on the edges and chewy in the middle.  Not very pizza crust-like.

Final tasted excellent!  I had to add flour, next time, I'll cut the water by half like another poster.  I added seasonings (and the extra flour) otherwise, I did the recipe as described.  I will make it again!  And I'll cook it at 375, it took 35 mins at 350 :)

This makes a nice soft pizza dough. I loved the flavor, however found the dough really sticky and had to add flour to it and use oil on my hands to keep if from sticking. Excellent texture when cooked, the family loved it.

Good but not great.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I let my pizza rise for the first 1/2 hour as directed and then let it rise again about 45 minutes more.  Then I cooked it at 425 F (instead of 350 as directed) after brushing it with olive oil on both sides.  It was still not quite done to my liking -- doughy.

Good dough! We made 2 small pizzas and it was perfect. It is easy to make it thick or thin and crispy. The flavor is good too. Make this dough!

Very good!  Gets extra points for being so easy.  The amount of water you put in it is subject to what you want.  Use your best judgement, and you will not be dissapointed.

Very quick and easy with the results that it produces. Here is a lesson I learned about oven temperature. I have an older oven that came with the house that I bought. The very first time I baked with it I overcooked a roast! I then purchased an oven thermometer and discovered my oven was off 50 degrees! It may behoove of you to check it out just to make sure.

This pizza crust was absolutely perfect! I just used all purpose flour too! It's delicious! My pizza came out beautifully and all I used was this dough, the Way Easy Pizza Sauce recipe, and some shredded, packaged, marble jack cheese.
