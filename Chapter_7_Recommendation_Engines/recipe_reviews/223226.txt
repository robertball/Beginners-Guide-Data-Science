Instead of salsa, I added chiptole sauce and onion, since that's how we eat tinga. I also grated my own Jack and cheddar cheeses because I refuse to buy pre-shredded cheese. Very, very, very quick and easy, which is exactly why I tried this idea. Sort of like a chicken taco salad.

I sauteed chopped onions and red peppers, then added the chicken to that and mixed in 1 teaspoon of cumin and chili powder, about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, 1/4 cup of parsley, 1/4 cup of tomato sauce, 1/4 cup of salsa and a cup of chicken broth. It was quite flavourful and my family really enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing the recipe!
