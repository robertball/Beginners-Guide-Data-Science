This was really very good.  The hens ended up a little tangy and sweet.  I however used sweetened applesauce because it was what I already had.  I made two whole hens and had plenty of sauce, but I could see where you would not if you were making more.  I also ended up with a little bit of pan drippings.  I used them to base the hens while cooking.  I don't buy game hens very often, but I am thinking I may try this with bone in chicken breasts to see how they taste.

These hens are so tasty!!!  The sweet/apple-vinegary combination was delightful!  My only complaint when I made it was the LACK of sauce.  The amount of sauce the recipe called for was not quite generous enough.  I'd recommend that same amount for one whole hen (2 halves).  Before you roast/bake, cover hens liberally with the sauce.

Disappointing.  The hens didn't brown at all.

We thought these were just OK and will stick with our basting with a mixture of oil, soy sauce, sherry, garlic salt, and cayenne.  This gives the hens a really beautiful browning.  Hens cooked whole make a much better presentation in my opinion.

My Cornish Hens turned out great, thanks to this recipe. However, it has a strong applesauce taste, which was fine for me. I also did not cut the hens in half (I tried but couldn't finish). This was my first attempt at Cornish Hens. I will make them again (I used frozen, if that matters).

The flavor was good.  The only problem I found was insufficient cooking time.  I added an additional 30mins
