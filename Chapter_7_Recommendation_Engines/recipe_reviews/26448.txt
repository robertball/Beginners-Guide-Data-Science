tasted too much like bean dip rather than soup, good thought, thin it down maybe? spice it up?

We love refried beans so when I saw this soup, I knew it would be good.It didn't disappoint me, it was flavorful and spicy.

Easy soup to make and tastes good, too. Could also be used to make bean dip!

Very easy to prepare and tasted yummy!  I served it with cheese enchiladas.
