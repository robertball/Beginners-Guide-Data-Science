This is an excellent side dish. We had it along with scalloped potatoes for dinner. The sweet and sour of this dish added a good accent to normally bland potatoes. I will be making this dish again.

I used one large sweet onion and scaled the recipe to 2.  We had the onion with some chili and corn bread and it was delicious. I broiled it for about 5 minutes at the end.  I will definatly serve this again.  We really enjoyed it.

This recipe had me doing the happy dance.   It is so good youâ€™ll want to eat the whole onion!  Has the perfect balance of sweet and savory. Used panko bread crumbs, and served with a drizzle of balsamic.  CHRISTYJ, loved it, this one's going into my Favorites folder.
