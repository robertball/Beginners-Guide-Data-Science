if you are looking to make florentine lace type cookies, this is not the one to use.  these come out more cookie like than lace like....way too much flour.  at least that's how mine came out.  too thick and not wafer like which is what i was looking for and hence too hard a bite.  i found a recipe on food network i am going to try with way less flour and more butter to get that wafer thin cookie.  sorry.

These were very easy to make.  I shaped them into dessert bowls and filled them with a no-bake cheesecake filling and fresh berries.  Everyone raved about them and said they looked complicated to make.  I will use this recipe over and over when I need to impress!

This recipe is good but you must be prepared to experiment with your oven temperature a little. I found cooling the entire mixture and rolling the dough into small balls gave the best result. I also used a convection oven and just lowered the temp to 325 which gave a more even tone to the cookie. Don't let them get too brown on the edges or they may be slightly bitter. Use parchment paper. If you are cheap you can wipe off the parchment paper a few times with a paper towel or reuse. Also be wary of spreading. If you cool it completely they spread a little less and you can get about 8 cookies on a standard cookie sheet without them touching. Great simple recipe.  With small cookies I was actually able to make about 100 cookies.

I love these cookies. As well as making them into a bowl, they can be shaped into a cone shape while still warm, filled with whipped cream and served amongst an assortment of squares and cookies. They need to be bigger for this.

I also makes the cookies quite small and dip about 1/3-1/2 of the cookie in either dark chocolate, or white chocolate.

Adds to a dessert party platter.

I was dissapointed by the fact that it said this made 30 cookies.  I made 1 1/2 the recipe and was baking this recipe all afternoon!!!  I know there is atleast 90 + cookies!!!  They taste great and I actually made them as a sandwich with melted semisweet chocolate to hold them together.

There are three things I love about these cookies...

They're a cinch to make.  They look so pretty and they taste good too!  What more could you ask for?

If you can get past the way these cookies look, they taste great!  They just aren't the most attractive cookie.  Good idea to make them into a bowl though!

Great recipe, but feel free to modify. I wanted these type of cookies to serve with a fruit compote. I wasn't dipping them in chocolate or filling them with a sweetened cream, so they had to taste good on their own. I found the recipe as written to taste kind of flat...just a sweet taste...a corn syrupy sweet taste, which no one in my family liked. So after the first practice tray of 2-3, I added a little salt. They need salt. While it did improve them, something was still a lacking so I added a combination of maple syrup and maple sugar and just kept tasting the batter until it was to my liking. (btw, maple sugar is not flavored white sugar, but maple sap cooked down past the point of syrup all the way to dry sugar. I live in a maple producing area, but it is in many stores now.) I think if you used all syrup, you would probably need more flour...I suppose that is worth a try, too if you don't have maple sugar. 

The cookies turned out AMAZINGLY!! I didn't measure my additions (I always seem to do that, duh), but am planning on making them again soon, so maybe I will pay more attention this time and post my first ever Allrecipes page!

Easy! I found them a bit too subtle, so I covered the bottom sides with melted chocolate. Just like Skor candy bars, awesome.

These are thin, brittle cookies, so make sure that's what you want. I had good luck with using a non-stick pan and carefully removing them with metal turner. Since I ran out of time to finish, I refrigerated the batter and found this made it easier to work with. Next time, I'll refrigerate in a 1/2 inch layer and cut into small squares for baking. I may try adding vanilla for a subtle change of flavor.
Thanks for contributing this recipe!

The stated measurements cannot be correct.  
First batch made as stated, too much dry ingredient for the wet, was ruined.
Second batch made with 1 Cup flour and 1 Cup of grounded pecans, was better, cookies were cake like and next day cookies were too hard to eat.
Third batch made with 1/4 cup flour.   This might have been too little as the mixture was very liquidity and cookies baked very flat and thin.   However these cookies were amazing.  It was like thin candy brittle.  I will make it this way again not even worry about forming cookies and just break it up as candy.
