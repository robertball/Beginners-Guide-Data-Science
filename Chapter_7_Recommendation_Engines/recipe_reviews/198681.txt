Yummers!!!! The whole family loved it!  The only thing I would do different is probably cook the chicken in the marinade in a saucepan.  (It burned easily in the skillet).  This will be a regular in our home!

My husband and I thought this was really great as is. All the flovors reallt went great together. I marinaded the chicken for 3 hours and used clementines instead of mandarin oranges. I would eat this every day!

This salad was just OK. I felt like it really needed something else for more flavor & more ingredients. I was in a hurry, so I didn't have time to experiment, maybe next time if I make it again. I did add snow peas chopped up in bite sized pieces to add a little something, but it still needed more.

This was very easy to make and lots of wonderful flavors. One tiny bit of advice.....you only need a small amount of the Sesame Ginger dressing. It poured out too quickly and it was a bit over-powering. (totally our fault though) Otherwise, all other flavors were delicious. To avoid cleaning my pan and save some time after cooking the chicken, I think I'll just saute the noodles, almonds & scallions in the same pan. Maybe it will absorb some of the yummy drippings. There were only two of us and we still have enough for one more left-over salad tomorrow.

OMG! I'm not really in to spinach but this salad was AWESOME.  Had a hard time finding the sesame ginger dressing so I used simple Asian ginger dressing.  Great dish!

Ah, this is okay. I used two whole breasts. No almonds or sesame seeds or oil, I used soy sauce and regular spinach and 1 whole onion. I also didn't use Mandarin oranges and I also used the soy sauce for dressing.         When or if I decide to make this again, I may get all of the correct ingreidients.

Very good and easy!!!  Something tells me that once my boyfriend gets here, I won't have any left for lunch tomorrow.  I didn't use ramen noodles because I just remember them being so salty when we used to eat them in college.  I used crunchy Chinese noodles instead.

Delicious, light, and simple!  My only adjustment is to add more orange slices.

GREAT recipe!  This is the kind of salad you would buy at restaurant for at least $13, but you can make it at home!  It tastes really good - I served mine with egg rolls.  This would be a nice dish to take somewhere like a potluck. I used regular teriyaki sauce since I couldn't fine Newman's Own brand, and I used Kraft Light Asian Toasted Sesame dressing.  I'll definitely make this again.

Great blend of flavors. Our 12 year old enjoyed it, too, which is saying a lot. She's not a typical salad eater, but this one worked for her. Made us smile, as we enjoyed it as well. Very nice late summer dinner entree.

My whole family likes this recipe, and it's great to serve company for lunch or dinner.  Next time I won't toss everything together, as all of the goodies went to the bottom of the bowl.  I did cut the chicken I to small pieces before marinating so more of the meat had flavor.  Otherwise followed directions.

I have found my go-to salad!  This is absolutely yummy!  Easy and delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly (which I wish others would do before they give this recipe three stars).  This will become a regular in my household.
