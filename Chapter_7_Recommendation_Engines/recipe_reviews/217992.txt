I could die and go to heaven right now, having succumbed to culinary bliss. I used 'space ship' squash (small, yellow summer squash) and followed the recipe, but I added a few things. Following the advice of previous raters, I cooked mine for about 40 minutes. I added a drizzle of olive oil, sliced red pepper, fresh garlic, and a sprinkle of basil.  Additionally, I had some green chille pepper from my garden that I diced and through in.  The result was beyond delicious and so  easy!

This was good.  I added peppers and onions as suggested along with some rosemary, tossed the veggies in olive oil and omitted the butter.  It took longer than the recommended time to cook, and I ended up raising the oven temperature to 450 to hurry it along, since the rest of my meal was ready and waiting.

My husband and I really liked this.  I did modify it a little, but just by adding a few spices.  I used a little bit of garlic salt sprinkled over the squash, as well as some cracked black pepper.  I spread the zucchini in a single layer on the pan, but with a little bit of overlap so I could fit more squash in.  Yum!

I've made this recipe three times now and love it.  It's a big hit at pot lucks and a great way to use up my abundance of summer squash.  We like it with just yellow squash or alternating with zucchini.  We're spice lovers so I took advice of other reviewers and added some diced onion, 1-2 cloves diced garlic, dried basil (to taste), half a diced red chili or jalapeno (depending on what's laying around), 1/3 diced red pepper, and cut the butter in half.  It turns out perfect every time.  Thanks for this super easy & fantastic recipe!

I chose to take the advice of the recipe submitter and alternated zucchini and squash as well as a bit of diced red bell pepper for a bit of colour. I knew I wanted it to have some seasoning, so I added some garlic powder & italian seasoning to the parmesan cheese mixture. This was good!

Made this last night.  I took the advice of a previous reviewer and alternated zucchini and yellow squash.  This had no flavor and my husband told me to not make it again, that it was a waste.

This was delicious!  I tried to cut back on the butter, just putting a smidge on each piece of squash.  Next time I'll try to spray with olive oil and use the cheese.

I liked the idea of baking the squash, but there was WAY too much butter and it took much longer to brown.

This is simple but really good and it makes a pretty side dish.  One yellow squash does not cut it for my family of 3 but then my husband has always said I was born to cook for a family of 6.  I used 2 very large summer squashes with the same amount of butter.  I thinly sliced some onion and threw that in the dish and seasoned with salt, garlic powder and italian seasoning.  I didn't measure the parmesan just eyeballed it until it looked like it was enough for me.  Everything couldn't lay in a single layer so I needed to bake it for about 30 minutes.  What I like the most about the dish is it frees you up to cook other stuff.  PS I think 1/4 cup of butter would be way too much for just one squash, so butter accordingly or you will be swimming in butter...not that that is always bad mind you.....

Yummy!  I actually sauteed mine on the stove top with some olive oil.  I added a bit of garlic and onion, also.  I also tossed in some fresh basil because I got a LOT with my CSA this go-round (also the reason for needing a squash recipe!)  The parmesan cheese in this is simply divine!!  Can't wait for the leftovers today at lunch!

Had two yellow squash and 1/2 eggplant in frig, what to do?  Found this recipe, sliced squash, eggplant, spanish onion using mandolin at 1/4", cut up red pepper and crushed garlic.  EVOO, Salt and Pepper and baked about 45mins.  Served with Balsamic marinated port tenderloin.  Oh, did use the cheese too.  Nice to get away from just sauteeing squash.

Yum! I used salted butter and added salt and pepper.  That was way too salty!  Next time I'll stick to the recipe and maybe use unsalted butter or olive oil.  Was still yummy though!  The rest of my food wasn't ready so I baked it for an extra 10-15 minutes and it was perfect consistency.

I have made this several times now and I still think it's fabulous.  I  do however cook until the squash is done and then put under the broiler to crisp up the cheese.

Just exactly what I was looking for.  Straight forward, no cream soups, fresh and delicious.  I added seasonings of choice with some chopped green onion and baked in my counter top oven.  Deleting all my other heavy squash recipes, this is so good.  I even prepped it ahead of time and put back in the fridge until the rest of my meal was almost done. Thanks for sharing!

I used summer squash fresh from the garden, swapped olive oil for butter, and used nutritional yeast instead of cheese. Simple and easy and the family loved it.

This was good, but I brushed on soft butter and sprinkled on a lot of garlic powder, and some Italian seasoning along with the Parmesan cheese.  Wish they had gotten a little crispier.

We do something similar all the time with squash and zucchini from my garden. We use white wine with butter and fresh garlic and herbs from my garden. Sometimes toss in shrimp or lobster to make it a meal. Really good cooked on the Traeger in a pan. Awesome recipe with endless possibilities!

This was really good. I only made minor minor changes. I shredded the squash with a grater instead of slicing it. It cooked in about twenty minutes that way. I also turned the oven up to 425. Instead of only using Parmesan I used an Italian blend with parmesan alone, Romano, and Parmesan all mixed in together. About five minutes before I took it out I added some fresh basil to the pan and then browned the top. It was amazing. Will definitely make again.

I used yellow squash, green pepper and an onion cut in rings. I  chose to add some garlic powder and a pinch of pepper to the Parmesan cheese , melted the butter to drizzle it over the cheese mixture then sprinkled Italian seasoning over all before cooking it for 30 minutes.  It was excellent!

Better than I expected! I tried this recipe because it was simple,  but I didn't really think it'd be a hit. I have made it twice this week already. The second time, I simply melted maybe 1 T butter in my pan, laid in the squash, sprinkled with garlic salt, and then parm. Sharp cheddar is also good on this.

Super easy to make.  Added a few seasonings but other than that, went by directions.  I think I might add Italian bread crumbs on top next time.  Will make again as it is a good easy basic recipe to go by..

Used sliced patty pan squash from my garden. Added
Some onion powder as well. Had to cook longer, about 35 minutes and turned on the broiler to crisp up the cheese for a few minutes at the end. Great recipe - thanks!

Great!!!  picked fresh from my garden and this was just a very nice new way to cook summer squash.  I did go a little heavy on the cheese just because I love fresh shaved Parmesan cheese.

This was really good.  I did use olive oil instead of butter and baked for 40 mins.

Took longer to brown the cheese than recommended.  Needs salt and pepper  to taste. Bland. Added onion and needs more parmesan for me. I also used young small crook neck yellow summer squash.  Thank you for the idea. I will continue to use this recipe as a base to get more creative!

I used green squash instead of yellow, because it was on sale at the grocery store. It came out with a great taste but they where very crunchy. I enjoyed the taste, but I feel if maybe doubling the time in the oven will give it a softer texture.

Use a mandolin to slice the squash.  Spray w/ "spray butter" and sprinkle with parm.   Very good

I used a little less butter and added some chopped onion. It was delicious! I will be using this recipe a lot as I have a ton of yellow squash growing in my garden this year.

I made this today for lunch. I took the suggestion of adding some diced red pepper, onion and garlic. I only used 1 and 1/2 TB of butter and added a big drizzle of EVOO. I used fresh shredded Parmesan and baked at 375 degrees for 35 minutes. This is a great way to use garden veggies!

This was yummy and easy.  I baked it a bit longer.  I did not have any parmesan, so 3/4 into the baking time, I put little pieces of torn up Swiss slices which worked out well since I prefer a milder cheese.

My first time making summer squash and i used this recipe. Very simple and very delicious thank you.

And for other first time summer squash eaters, If i would describe this veggie it would be like a juicy less sugary version of a sweet potato.
