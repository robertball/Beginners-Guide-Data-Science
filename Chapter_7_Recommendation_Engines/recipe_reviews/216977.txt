This is the second time I've tried these.  I figured I should give the recipe another chance and make some modifications and I think I'm going to make these yet again and modify them further.  
This time I used only 1 egg in the potatoes and did not dredge the potato pancakes in the flour and egg.  Simply rolling them in panko made them slightly easier to work with.  
Next time I make these I'm going to skip the egg all together!  Unless you're making dry mashed potatoes (no milk and butter) there really is no need for the additional moisture from the egg.  Just add the flavourings, form and roll in the panko.  It doesn't need anything else.

These were pretty good!  If you find that your potatoes are not consistent enough to roll into balls, add potato flakes until you're able to roll them.  I also breaded with Italian bread crumbs.  Theses would be great with shredded cheese in them and topped with sour cream ;)

Dredging these in the Panko crumbs is a wonderful idea.  I used just 1 egg, though, and that made for an easier mixture to handle.  Will do it this way from now on.

These were great! I took other reviewers advice and only use 1 egg and then dipped in 1 egg before rolling in the Panko. I added cheese and 1 TB of dry ranch dressing and some salt. I cooked the onion to golden brown before adding for extra flavor. Definitely spray your hands so you can roll them and they wont stick. I fried in EVOO/butter mix. Definitely a keep in my house!!!!

These were delicious! Patties were hard to shape because the mashed potato mixture wasn't very thick. I had to add flour to make it thick. Very crispy outside which is my favorite party.

Delicious, but mechanics of process didn't work for me. After having problems with patties, I oiled my hands, formed 1/3 C balls which I rolled in the flour, egg & Panko crumbs. Only when these were all prepared did I add them to the skillet and gently flatten with a spatula. The second time I made this, I added 1 tsp each dried oregano, dried basil & garlic powder. I want to try this one with a blue cheese topping, also.

Gave these potato cakes an Italian twist.  I mixed in some grated Pecorino Romano cheese, breaded with Italian panko crumbs, garnished with chopped basil, and drizzled the mashed potato cakes with marinara.  Made a very nice side dish.

These are all about how you originally made your mashed potatoes.  Mine tend to be thick, not creamy.   I really enjoyed the variety of ingredients people added. Made them this time with only 1 cup of thick mashed potatoes, a little flour to help bind it and the whole egg, rather than try to half it.  Had to add a little instant potatoes, but still worked, and rolled in Italian crumbs as that is what I had on hand.  Still turned out fine.  Will add some other ingredients next time and have even more fun - like the idea of ranch seasoning.

What I don't understand is why people thought you were to add 2 eggs to the 2 cups of potatoes.  It clearly said separate bowls so you had the other egg to dredge with.  Another misunderstanding is the 1/2 T of black pepper.  Clearly should have read 1/2 tsp - No recipe calls for 1/2 T of something.  1/2 T would be written as 1-1/2 tsp.

I made this and it was great, though I didn't use the egg and added a tablespoon of Dijon mustard. It was amazing!!

Also, I baked them in the oven instead of pan-frying them. It makes them healthier, but next time I will try the pan-fried version ;)

While this was a tad messy. It turned out well from what my family said. I thought it was to peppery myself. And ended up making not just a double batch, but a half a batch more on top of that to knock out some of the pepper, because that's all I could taste in the mixing round. I also minced the onions in this recipe. But again everyone else told me that the pepper flavor was just fine and went for seconds. The thing I would recommend to others when it comes to dredging method with the egg dipping part. Is use a small but shallow dish for the eggs when dipping the patty into it. And use a spatula to handle and flip to coat the egg onto both sides. If not, you are going to have to be very creative not to have your patty broken up and just a ploppy mess. Just warning others. But We did like the recipe. I can see making this again but still not adding as much black pepper into this.

I had leftover “Loaded Mashed Potatoes,” which were simply ideal for this recipe.  Because I didn’t want to risk the cakes being too gloppy I added no egg.  Also, it didn’t seem critical to coat the cakes in flour and egg first, so I just immediately coated them in the panko bread crumbs and it worked out just fine.  These were so flavorful and delicious, albeit a little on the fragile side.  Hubs thought they were better than most of this type, less greasy, he thought.  Maybe it was the panko bread crumbs that made the difference.

These were very good.  I was a great way to use up some leftover mashed potatoes.  I did not add the 1 egg to the mashed potatoes, they would have been too wet that way.  They were a little difficult to coat with the bread crumbs and get to the pan without falling a part.  I just made them very small so that helped in keeping them together.  I also add a little shredded cheese to the mixture before I formed them into patties.  They tasted great, I would make them again.

My husband and I really liked these. I added extra onion grated finely in the food processor, salt and pepper. I skipped the flour and egg for dredging and did have to add some flour to the mix to get it firmer and easier to work with. I formed the mix  into a ball, rolled in the panko crumbs, and put in the oil. Then I flattened with the spatula. Make sure the first side is crispy before turning. I was making open faced hot pork sandwiches to go with these but my hubby just put the pork and gravy over the potato cakes. Awesome.

It was messy I'd have to admit, and it sort of fell apart when i dredged it in the egg. The overall texture was super crunchy though :)

Definitely skip the extra egg -- it makes the pancakes too hard to handle.  We combined the flour and panko together and that worked fine.

These is great recipe to use your left over mashed potatoes!  I didn't have any left overs, so I used the Betty Crocker boxed kind.  I let it chill in the fridge for about 2 hours.  I had trouble keeping the potatoes stick in the patty.  Next time I will use real mashed potatoes and I think it'll be much better.  Also, this recipe had way to much pepper for us, so I will likely cut the pepper in half.  I think a little bit of shredded cheddar cheese mixed the potatoes would add a nice touch.  Overall excellent starter recipe - so thank you!  I'm always looking for something different to do with potatoes.

Wonderful basic recipe. You can jazz it up, but the most important tip is to make the potatoes a little stiff. (not as much cream as usual).

I didn't use any eggs or flour. I wanted to taste the potatoes. I sauteed some onions and seasoned the mashed potatoes to my liking before I rolled them into balls, then rolled them in the panko crumbs. Everyone loved them.

These are extremely messy to make and bland.  IF I were to make them again I would add Dill & Garlic & maybe some ground red pepper.  And I would not dredge in  flour & egg.

A delicious potato cake - several versions exist for the extremely weighty taste bud added grated carrots and potatoes to one, and served and ate that one under a
fluffy dollop of sour cream.  For the child guest, a small
amount of ketchup on the original recipe' worked out
well for both child and adults alike.  -  Ariel O'Suilleabhain

The first time I made these, I followed the recipes exactly. They turned out beautifully.  My family loved them and asked me to make them again soon.  The next time I changed the recipe a bit. Because  we liked them so much, I decided to
 double the recipe. (I should have done that the first time!) Since I had a lot of leftover garlic mashed potatoes, I used those and added minced Italian parsley from my garden and about 1/2 Cup of grated Romano cheese. I also used Italian seasoned  panko to coat these. They were absolutely wonderful  too.  When I asked my husband which way he prefered them, he couldn't decide.  He said they were equally delicious. So now I have two variations of these to add to my repertoire!  Next time, I think I might try a bacon and cheddar version. 
Thank you for sharing this excellent recipe! It's going to be a frequent item on my dinner table from now on.

I did not add egg to the potato mixture.  I did add garlic powder and Turkish Seasoning to the potato mixture.  Once I shaped them into patties, I dredged in egg, then the Panko and fried as directed.  Very crispy and flavorful.

These are delicious!  They are a little hard to work with but I managed ok and they ended up holding their shape.  I think it's a good base recipe and anything could be added, like cheese, or bacon :)

My Mom made potato cakes every time we had left over mashed potatoes. I think she made extra so we would have the leftovers. One trick she used was to make the patties the same night, (just the potatoes, nothing else) layer them on a plate with plastic between, cover with plastic and refrigerate overnight. 
The next evening because the patties had been in the fridge so long they were firm and kept their shape while breading. 
Of course Panko was not a 'thing' yet in the 60s, so after dipping them in a beaten egg, she pressed them into a cornmeal, flour mixture. I'm loving this panko version, so now, when making these potato cakes, I'll have to decide which version to make... Mom's or panko?!?

My husband makes wonderful mashed potatoes, and always uses Yukon Gold potatoes.....adding horseradish into the mix.  This recipe is perfect for leftover mashed potatoes!

Absolutely horrible. Tried the recipe. It was mush. Tried again and “doctored” it. Still mush. The only way to make them is the old fashioned way.

After reading comments about them being a little bland, I spiced mine up. I sautéed one onion, one garlic clove and one chili pepper in  some butter and caramelized it. I added the onion mixture with approximately half a cup of shredded cheddar cheese, a quarter teaspoon of salt and a half tsp dried parsley. I topped them with sour cream mixed with chopped green onion and no salt seasoning salt. Spicy and delicious!

I made these potato cakes today and we enjoyed them, but they need a little lift. Next time i make them i may add a small amount of either garlic powder or fresh garlic.

I made these for dinner tonight with leftover mashed potatoes. I followed the recipe ingredients but I found the panko browned very quickly, before the potatoes were heated through, so I put them in the oven to heat through (I did make them quite large though). We haven't eaten yet, but I did sneak one and it was very tasty. I think next time I might add more onions and maybe some garlic. All in all, this is a good recipe to use leftover mashed potatoes and I will make it again.
