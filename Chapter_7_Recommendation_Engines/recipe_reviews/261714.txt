I really loved the idea for the mayo and sriracha sauce. I added some soy sauce to it and sesame oil and it was enjoyed by everyone in my family. Thank you also for all the details you provided in this recipe! I also used 2 cups of rice, left the rice vinegar as it was, used 1 teaspoon of salt, and subbed maple syrup for the sugar.
