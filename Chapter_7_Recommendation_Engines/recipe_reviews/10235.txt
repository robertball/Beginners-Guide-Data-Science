I made these for recipe group 12/04/2011. These were a cute little cookie. The full recipe yielded 21 cookies using a leveled cookie scoop. I found out from a lady on the recipe buzz that this cookie was actually a Pillsbury recipe contest winner from 1952 by the same name. The recipes really are exactly the same, except the icing is a tad different. I did not have unsweetened chocolate so I used the icing from the original recipe calling for semi-sweet chocolate and adding 1/2 cup extra of powdered sugar to thicken it. It was a little sweet, so I would stick with the icing recipe here. However, the cookie has just a nice light sweetness, like a shortbread, which I liked. The same lady suggested covering the pecans well to avoid them from burning. After I scooped the cookie on I pressed down slightly, to shape, and then pushed the pecans in a little further. The cookies don't spread too much, and it worked well. Make sure to save the egg white from the second egg. The Pillsbury recipe indicates the one egg should be separated in the ingredients list. I also used 105 pecan halves. The original recipe does state 1 full cup. The cookie looks just like the picture and refridgeration sets the chocolate icing nicely. Despite little recipe quirks, that deviate from the original, I enjoyed making these and were surprised how nicely they turned out. Kids would really love these!

THANK YOU FOR SUBMITTING THIS RECIPE. It is the exact same recipe that I inherited(Original clipping from the newspaper from about 50 years ago!!!) from my grandmother. I somehow missplaced it and was horrified because it was the only copy I had. I only make them for christmas and send them to my family across the country!  THANK YOU!!!!!!!!

So much fun to make! We made them for a Christmas cookie competition. We decorated the backs of them with white, green, and red frosting. We also gave them green gel eyes. It made them much more visually appealing. Lots of fun. Yummy cookie! Thanks!

These are tasty little critters.  Great selection Recipe Group for 12/4/2011!  Not only are they scrumptious, but they are cute as can be.  Kids will love them.  Just a note:  I used quite a bit more than 1 cup of confectionersâ€™ sugar for the frosting.  I also slightly molded the cookies to make sure the pecans were attached snugly.  Now I just need a place to hide them.

thank you for posting this turtle cookie recipe. my mother used to make these for birthday parties, and when we went to summer camp, but the recipe was lost many years ago--about 50!!!  I just found this and can't wait to make them. I never would have guessed they had maple flavor, which is what gives them  that unique flavor. thanks again.

I doubled the recipe the first time I made it: it was a bit time consuming.  Let me tell you these were a hit!  And they do taste great.  The egg whites really hold the pecans on the bottom of the cookie!  As this recipe is written, I used 1/4 tsp maple syrup instead of the 1/8 tsp flavouring.  Not sure if it added much, but they did taste great.  For the icing, I did as this recipe indicated except used only 6 tblsp of milk.  I didn't need to add more than 1 cup icing sugar, it was a perfect consistency, and had a really nice, sweet,  dark chocolate taste.
