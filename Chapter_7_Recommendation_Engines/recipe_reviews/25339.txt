I admit it, a steak flashed thru my mind too after the first bite.  VERY BLAND.  BUT, I just adjusted the seasonings to my taste, let it cook longer, and found it was a great meal.  I did follow the recipe exactly, except I only cooked it 2 hours before adding the flour/water mixture instead of 3.  

I think it is a great "base" for a chili recipe.  I never have luck with my crockpot and all I had to do was add chipotle, liquid smoke, cayenne pepper, cumin, paprika and brown sugar.  If you are adding brown sugar I would cut back on the molasses, it was too syrupy.  Also, I would like to add a lot more beans to this...I would definitely use this as a start to developing my own personalized veggie chili recipe.

If you are making this recipe for a vegan, please note that not all "vegetarian ground beef crumbles" are suitable for vegans. Many of them contain egg, or milk derivatives--vegans do not consume these items.

Having said that--I likedthis recipe quite a bit. It had a nice chili flavor, and the molasses added something different. I added an extra boullion cube, as well.

This chili was fantastic. My meat-loving husband even had a bowl. I will say, though, that unlike most chili, this one is better fresh than left over. I can't wait to make it again.

Have made this twice. Have had to double the receipe to meet demands.  A couple of quick changes, used a mixture of beans, pinto, black, canneli, and kidney beans; added 1/2 TBS dried Basil; added 4 meatless sausage flavored patties chopped up; did not use the flour or extra water, just let it simmer in crock pot. Much better on day two.

This is a good chili, but not great.  After making this, I realize that I'm not a fan of celery in my chili.  Also, I missed the crushed tomatoes of my usual chili recipe.  I added cumin, a must have seasoning in any chili recipe for me.  Next time, I would switch up the beans... just not  use kidney beans exclusively.  I made it un-vegan by using real sharp cheddar.

My family loves this recipe.  It is the only chili that my kids will eat. I usually use all pinto beans, but have used any type of canned 'dry' bean I have on hand (ie: black beans, great northern, white kidney beans, etc) We make this recipe about once a week during the winter.

I use veggie sausage crumbles and brown them first for a more meat like texture. Yummie! Even pleases MEAT EATERS such as myself.

I tried this recipe, and I thought it was the best chili I've ever had!  I make it often.  I find it especially good because I have a tomato allergy, but I don't have to alter the recipe to leave them out, as there aren't any.

This was a great recipe for the whole family! i didn't use the hot sauce so our 1 and 3 yr olds would enjoy it.  I also used 1 can kidney, 1 can navy and 1 can chickpeas and it was great!

very tasty, quick and easy. I decided to use ground turkey in the recipe which negates the vegan part but it was still good.

I thought I liked my chili hotter than most, so I used Dave's Insanity hot sauce which was a mistake.  Now it is way too hot.  Also you have to be sure to add plenty of salt, because it is a little on the bland side other than the heat.

Loved it! A fabulous base recipe. My husband loves to bring it to work, and I love having a veggie slow cooker recipe! I've had rave reviews from meat eaters and veggies alike. I add more chili powder and just leave the hot sauce on the table for those that like it. Corn made a nice addition, but it needed more spice then to balance it out- Overall a great starter recipe!

This chili rocks! Not only is it easy but it's super cheap to make. I added a can of carrots to mine and omitted the molasses and instead added a Tbls of unsweetened cocoa powder. Man was it good! Loved loved loved it;-)

This was really great! My family and I enjoyed this immensely at dinner tonight (and I was the only vegetarian at he table). Even though it was so great, I'm only giving it four stars because I had to tweak it so much. However, I'd still say this was a great base vegetarian chili recipe. Here is what I changed: 
Added: 1 can diced tomatoes;  1 tsp. cumin; pinch red pepper flakes; 1 1/2 fresh parsley; 1 extra bay leaf; 1/2 tsp. more hot sauce; 1 Tbs. lime juice. 
Then, I did not add the extra 1 c. of water with the flour because the diced tomatoes already added extra liquid to the chili. 
Thanks for the recipe! :)

Excellent starter for any chili. I did make a few changes. I used 3 cans of beans but used dark & light red kidney beans and black beans. Also added (1) 28 oz can of Muir Glenn fire roasted tomatoes instead of the water, veg bouillon, and flour. Brought it to my meat starving coworkers and none of them realized that there was no meat in it.

Healthy bold chili.  VERY delicious! I had to tone down the heat by about half for my tastes, tho. I served it on rice, with sour cream and cilantro.  Thank you!

This recipe is simple and delicious! I substituted 3 heaping tablespoons of dark brown sugar for the molasses and was extremely happy with the results. Adding a little chopped pineapple to the serving bowl was also a nice change.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out pretty good. I couldn't tell the difference between the soy crumbles and real meat. It was very very strange eating chili that had no tomato in it, and I had a hard time getting used to that, but with some cheese and sour cream on top of each bowl, this recipe is delicious!

Yep, it fooled my meat-loving family, alright! And it's so easy. I skipped the flour and subbed a little brown sugar for molasses, but what a great vegetarian meal!
