This is the BEST steak sandwich I have ever had in my long life. Amazing! I did have to change it up due to my inability to get some of the ingredients. I had to use small crimini mushrooms because I couldn't find the other. I had to use romaine and a little rocket because I couldn't find any decent arugula today either. I could not find flat iron so I used my much prized prime NY strips well trimmed instead. Now don't go crazy on me folks because I made do with what I had. Loved the sauce and the mushrooms and everything else about this. This is fabulous! Sparky said he wants to have it weekly. Thanks for sharing Chef John!

Great steak.  I didn't quite get the steak cooked enough for it to be really tender but that's hardly the fault of the recipe.  The mushrooms were a hit with my non mushroom eating wife.

I could not get the steak as suggested, so I took a NY strip sirloin, it was great, and I will do it again
