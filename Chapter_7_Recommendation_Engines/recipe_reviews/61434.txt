Very nice. Colourful and cheesy. Everyone at our house liked this. Although the instructions mention adding paprika to the top of the casserole, I added it, but I'm not really sure that it's necessary. Make sure to buy a big cauliflower because there is a lot of other stuff in the casserole. This could be assembled ahead of time and refrigerated, if that is more convenient. Thanks!

My husband and I loved it. A few substitutions to make it more Weight Watcher friendly: I used fat free sour cream, 1/2 cup green pepper and 1/2 cup red pepper (for more color and more vegetables) and just a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese. Instead of salt I substituted Trader Joe's Salt-Free 21 Seasoning Salute. Delicious. I will be preparing this again and again.

I tried to stick to the recipe as closely as possible my first time making it. I will remake it, but I will be making some changes next time. 

My review for the recipe as it is written is middle of the road. My 7 year old son and I both liked it, but my mother did not care for it and my 5 year old daughter thought that being required to eat it was a fate worse than death. I did not like red peppers in this recipe because I found the sweetness off putting. The biggest thing about this recipe that I consider a fail is the corn flakes. Mixing them with sour cream and baking them in the casserole rendered them unrecognizable blobs of mush. What I liked best about this recipe is that it is a vegetable casserole where the veggies are the star of the show. I felt like 4 out of 5 vegetable casserole recipes were calling for a can of condensed soup, and I am all set with that.

Next time, I'm going to begin by using green peppers and half a minced onion and sauteeing them in bacon grease before adding them to the casserole. I will also roast the cauliflower florets instead of steaming them. I will use 8oz of sour cream and 8oz of greek yogurt mixed with the sharp cheddar, and I will skip the corn flakes. Instead of just the parm on the top, I will mix the parm with the corn flakes and some crumbled bacon.

This was a very good vegetable dish.  Very flavorful!  I did substitute frozen (thawed) cauliflower for the convenience of it.

This was a really good side dish that I tried this evening that my family enjoyed.  I didn't have everything on hand to make this, so I had to omit and substitute a few items.  It came out very tasty with my substitutions.  I didn't have corn flakes, so I omitted the bread aspect.  I didn't have sour cream, but I did have plain yogurt, that I used in place of the sour cream.  I also only had a red bell pepper.  I sautéed and added 1/2 cup chopped yellow onion and 3 large minced cloves of garlic  to the 1/2 cup of chopped red bell pepper in olive oil with 1/4 tsp fresh ground pepper for several minutes and then added these sautéed vegetables to the cauliflower and then mixed in the cheddar cheese and yogurt.  I didn't add salt since the cheeses have so much salt in them already.  I will make this again.

My boyfriend doesn't like cauliflower, but he said he'd eat it if I put cheese on it. I followed this recipe exactly, and it was absolutely delicious. I felt really skeptical for a moment before I tossed the cauliflower in with the other ingredients -- I felt that it would be too little to coat everything. However, it was the perfect amount. Each bite was cheesy and delicious. As for the corn flakes, I figured that I would crush them in a plastic baggie. Little did I know in advance that a snack-sized bag filled with corn flakes crunches down to exactly half a cup! Now you do, and you can save yourself a bit of time measuring! :)

I would go a 4.5 on this one. Made it as is but omitted the red pepper(didn't have) & corn flakes(don't like in casseroles). To leftovers, I mixed in some leftover broccoli, a handful more cheese, & a small single serve container of chive cream cheese-YUM! Thank you for the inspiration!!

I halved the recipe because I was using up leftover cauliflower.  I omitted the chopped pepper but only because I didn't have any.  I added a little sliced yellow onion (maybe 1/4 of a small onion) with the sour cream mixture & it added just enough flavor. Instead of mixing the corn flakes & paprika in I mixed them with 2 tbsp melted butter & sprinkled them on top instead of the cheese for a nice crunch.  My husband thought he was eating potato casserole until I asked him how the cauliflower was!

My family was wild over this recipe! I used a large head of caluflower and doulbed the cheese, sour cream, and corn flakes. I also added a chili and lime seasoning mix (witch contains several spices ) for more flavor. It was fantastic. I will defiinatley be making this again.

This is delicious. I think the peppers really add that unexpected flavor that really makes it. I sprinkled bread crumbs on top instead of using corn flakes. Will make this one again.

I made this recipe with fried fish and the kids ate every bit of it and told me next time I needed to make more. I do think next time I will try frozen caulliflower to make it a little easier. But we will make it again and a bigger batch of it too.

Loved this recipe! This is an awesome way to use cauliflower and make everyone happy. I used more garlic and did not have the corn flakes. I used half cheez its and half melba toasts to substitute. I also used red and yellow peppers instead. We will be keeping this one. Chow

Making this recipe I experienced one of those moments when I knew it just wasn't going to work out, but I tried anyway based on the better ratings. I followed the directions exactly. There is simply not enough sauce, and the sauce that was there congealed and separated. I don't know how a sour cream sauce can work if it isn't made with a roux as a base, and in this case, it didn't. The flavor was minimal because of the absence of sauce, and the casserole was dry on top but wet at the base. This was a culinary failure. The flavor was okay. I'm going back to classic cauliflower au gratin. At least my grandson, 3, enjoyed it because there was cheese in it.

Very yummy.  I know people hate it when reviewers say "but I changed...".  I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream only b/c it is what I had on hand.  I will make it again with sour cream, and I'm sure it will still be great.

This recipe was a hit at my family bbq. I will definately make this again. The peppers added such great flavor to the already creamy cheesiness!! I didn't have the corn flakes so I used bread crumbs and it turned out just fine. Thank you for this great new recipe!

Cauliflower (IMO), is an underappreciated vegetable!    I made this dish with 4 minor changes, and my very fussy family (and fussy me) enjoyed it.  I used celery salt in place of regular salt (for a lot more flavor) and Hungarian paprika instead of that generic flavorless paprika which is on everyone's spice shelf, and only adds color to a dish, but absolutely no flavor.  I also sprinkled in a couple of dashes of garlic powder, not enough to actually taste it, but a little bit always brings out the other flavors in a dish.  It was good, and I'll definitely be making this again.

Really tasty. I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and panko crumbs instead of cornflakes......very good...will definitely keep recipe to make again and again. Second time I used half broccoli and half cauliflower florets. DELISH

I thought this was great.  I omitted the bell peppers and added garlic and it was very tasty.  Even the picky bf liked it.

Followed the recipe as written.  Very good, but not quite what I had hoped.  NEXT TIME, I'll use 8 oz of sour cream and 8 oz of cream cheese with chives.  Use 2 cups of sharp cheddar and 1 cup shredded parmesan IN the mixture.  I'll chop and saute one onion with some finely chopped carrots (no peppers).  I'll add some Old Bay seasoning along with paprika, salt and pepper to the sautéing vegetables.  I'll use crushed Ritz crackers in the mixture and a mix of crushed Ritz crackers with grated parmesan cheese with melted butter over the top of the casserole.  I think that will, for me, make it a 5 star dish.  Thank you for the recipe kelliegirl21!  You have inspired me!

Great & easy recipe. I improvised using Ritz cracker in place of corn flakes (I didn’t have any) & I omitted the peppers (my middle son doesn’t like them) I used a combination of Colby jack & sharp cheddar. It came out great. I’ll definitely make this again.

Why eat potatoes when cauliflower is more nourishing and less fattening?  I made this recipe with no changes. It was good tasting and something the whole family loved. Even the picky kids. Easy and delicious.

I gave this one three stars because my husband and I loved it, but my four and six year olds hated it.  I ate it cold the next day for lunch.  Substituted Panko in for corn flakes and greek yogurt for sour cream.  Less fat.

This was exactly what I was looking for in a baked cauliflower dish. I chose to combine broccoli and cauliflower. I used frozen and defrosted in micro slightly and drained off any excess water. I did eliminate the peppers. It really doesn't need it. This dish was even better the next day!! I reheated the leftovers in the micro and it was great! Thanks for the recipe!!

I did not care for the combination of peppers with the cauliflower. Followed the recipe, no changes made.   May try again without the peppers and using bread crumbs or ritz crackers instead of cornflakes.

Followed recipe to the T. Perhaps a bit more of the green/red peppers. Delicious, with a hint of Mexican flavor due to peppers and cheese. I will make it again.

We make this again and again but with a couple changes.  First, we don't have cornflakes so we used seasoned bread crumbs but put them on the top.  We added a couple dashes of cayenne to the sour cream.  We put the parm and a bit of cheddar on the top too.  It is great the next day!  So so good.

As most folks, I adapted. Simplified. Sautéed cauliflower, peppers and onion in cast iron skillet. Added cheese mixture (no cornflakes and used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream as I always do) topped with the parm and put the whole concoction in the oven. Really nice. I did use Smoked Gouda instead of cheddar. Gives a rich flavors without adding bacon - perfect for vegetarians!

I loved it.  I did a couple of things different: I don't have a steamer so I put the Cauliflower in my pressure cooker and set it for 5 minutes (then I kind of forgot it) so it cooked a little longer than the recipe calls for --but not too much--, but in the end I like the results very much.  It blended in with the other ingredients and had a wonderful taste.  It almost lost it's strong cauliflower flavor, but there was just enough to make the final result quite delicious.  Oh, and the other thing I did differently was that I only used green pepper.

I used flavored bread crumbs instead of corn flakes. I think it needs more liquid rather than just the sour cream. It was still good however.

This was delicious!  To make it carb friendly I replaced corn flakes with bacon.  Yummy!!
There wasn't a crumb left!

I made this for Christmas as fit theme with red & green peppers. A couple changes per others reviews. I did roast the cauliflower as someone suggested for additional flavor.  I also omitted the mushy cornflakes.  The rest was per recipe. Very few people tried it and those of us that did, did not care for it. Very bland...

I used purple cauliflower just for fun :-) I agree with others that the corn flakes are not necessary and next time I may add some onions or more peppers.

Made it this morning, added onion and used yellow pepper only.  Must have messed up somewhere and I had a lot of liquid after baking, however I didn't add in the cornflakes so maybe that was it.  Needs more oomph as it is rather bland.  Not sure this will be a repeat recipe unless I really doctor it up.

I put baked potato chips on top and skipped the corn flakes. I also tried fat free sour cream, but I think that made the taste too tangy. But overall, it was delicious and I will try it again.

Everyone loved it!  Even the one who normally doesn’t like cauliflower. 
Instead of the cornflakes I added fried onion mix to the top before cooking. It stayed crispy and added a good flavor.

It was fabulous! I used triscuits crunched up as I didn't have cornflakes, and added some bacon bits and extra parmesan on top. Cleaned out the dish :)

I made this and I added a couple dashes of heavy whipping cream and about  3 oz. of cream cream (softened). I eased off of the sour cream. My company scraped their plates for every bite.

This is a great recipe to turn into a main dish.  I like to steam chicken breasts, cut them up and add to the mix.  For a different take try a sea food casserole with large shrimp as they are an excellent addition.

After reading some reviews that said the recipe was bland, I changed it up a bit. I sautéed the peppers and three diced shallots in 2 tablespoons of olive oil. . I also added a dash of Tabasco sauce.  Then I proceeded with the recipe as written. It was not bland  at all and got a good reviews from family .
I will make this again.

This was tasty, albeit a little salty; if I make it again, I’ll omit the salt and add it at the table if needed.   Also, the sauce separated, which was disappointing.   But, as I said, it was tasty.

Slight modification: I made this basic recipe but substituted crushed pork rinds for the corn flakes to keto it up, then added bacon and sautéed mushrooms, and topped with cheddar and parmesan.   The result was excellent!

This recipe was pretty good. I used low fat sour cream and sharp cheddar as that's what I had on hand. It felt like it was missing something though. Next time I will add chopped onion and frank's red hot to the mix. I added the hot sauce after it was done and it was pretty good.

I liked this pretty much and it smelled so good while baking.  I couldn't wait to eat it.  I did not use the corn flakes.  Sauteed onion with the bell pepper and thru in some minced garlic.  Wasn't as creamy as I thought it would be but it is an interesting change to cauliflower.  Recipe is worth trying!

Superb ending. Didn't substitute anything besides utilized plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and added pieces of asparagus to it.  2/2 now with this dish!

My family enjoyed this side dish. I didn't have enough sour cream, so I added some cream cheese - about 1/4 cup softened. To add more variety, I increased the amount of red and green peppers to about 1/2 cup each. I sautéed them with a diced shallot. I  also added some garlic powder and ground fresh pepper. The result was very flavorful. This will make  a nice addition to our menu rotation.

12.29.16 I steamed the cauliflower in the microwave on high for 3 minutes.  I don’t (well, rarely) buy green bell peppers, but I thought the green would give this casserole a pop of color, so I added some chopped jalapeno.  Good move because that gave this dish a nice presentation, but it also gave it a little zing of flavor.  The one thing that I didn’t like about this recipe was all the liquid that was puddled at the bottom of the casserole dish, which I had to drain before serving.    The cauliflower was crisp tender (don’t over steam, and it had good taste.

Great recipe! I made this for thanksgiving and everyone loved it, a keeper! The only change I made was to the peppers, I'm not a fan of green peppers so I did a medley of red/yellow/orange. It turned out great!

Didn't have any corn flakes so I just crunched up some potato chips and threw those in along with some leftover corn on the cob.  Turned out pretty good and initially my husband kind of turned up his nose at the cauliflower, but went for second portions.

This was pretty yummy and I will be making it again.  My first attempt at a recipe similar to this one was a total fail. It used bread crumbs instead of cornflakes and as with this recipe called for the breadcrumbs (cornflakes with this recipe) to be mixed in with the sourcream.  What a terrible gloppy mess and it was also very runny.  It tasted okay but looked terrible.  So with this recipe I made  sure to drain the cooked cauliflower very well and I did not add the cornflakes to the sourcream mixture. Instead I did as a previous reviewer did and mixed the crushed cornflakes with the Parmesan cheese and sprinkled over the top.  This turned out beautifully!

It's a lovely "basic" recipe that lends itself well to modification based on your audience/menu.  The next time I make it I will probably pep it up a bit.  Might use pepper jack cheese or add jalapeños or crushed peppers.  Onions would also be a nice addition.

Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This is one of my family's favorite dishes! It's an undertaking time wise, but definitely worth it. I have adjusted the recipe a bit to tailor it to my tastes: I use extra red and green pepper (approx 1/2 cup of each); I add black pepper, dried onion, and dried minced garlic to the mix; plus I top the casserole with extra cheese and corn flakes. It is very flavorful and delicious! Absolutely recommend.

This was a great vegetable casserole that I would probably make again as a side dish. It was really easy to make and came out delicious! The red/green bell peppers plus the cayenne pepper on top give it a really nice fragrance when eaten hot right out the oven. My only alteration to the recipe would be to add some kind of heat to kick the dish up a notch--I felt that the pepper fragrance hinted at there being some spice in the casserole, but unfortunately the heat was missing from this recipe. So next time I'm going to try adding some fresh jalapeno into the casserole mixture. Otherwise this recipe was perfect.

I have made it several times, especially while I am in Mexico, as the cauliflowers are so big here.  My husband, who does not like most vegetables, loves it.   I usually add various peppers, some of which are hot and the dish always turns out delicious.

Don't skip the bell pepper. It gives it a great flavor. I added more cheddar and a can of cream of mushroom with the sour cream. Topped with Parmesan and panko bread crumbs. I also cooked the cauliflower longer than suggested and sautéed the bell pepper. I didn't want it crunchy at all. Turned out fantastic!

This recipe was very good. I made exactly as written, but I used one whole green pepper, no red. It was cheesy ànd a great side to Cheddar Baked Chicken from this site. Next time I will add the optional paprika to give it a little extra something.

I made this for New Years eve and it was a disaster. The sour cream and corn flakes kind of gathered in lumps that I could not get rid of without mushing the cauliflower. It was kind of bland. If I was to make it again which is unlikely I would thoroughly mix the sour cream and cauliflower before adding the corn flakes. Maybe omitting the cornflakes and adding more cheese would help.

I used half habanero cheese and half cheddar.  This was a hit with my mom, sister and husband.   (However, nothing will induce my kids to eat cauliflower, so it was just us grown-ups.)   Everyone had multiple servings, and could've eaten more!  So despite the recipe saying 8 servings, I'd call this 4 servings.

The flavor was mild but all right, but it was too dry. I expected more sauce. Perhaps the cornflakes crumbs should not be added with the sour cream, because they made it thicker, but on top with the parmesan cheese. I will make it again and add a little milk. I liked the suggestion of adding a little more zing, maybe ground red pepper or red pepper sauce.

This has become a family favorite.

I forego adding green peppers to the recipe and double the red pepper. Also, in lieu of using corn flakes, I crush up Ritz crackers and only add half the salt.  It's wonderful with a variety of meals, and goes very well with Basmati or Jasmine rice.

I substituted Ritz for the cornflakes and salt, Greek yogurt for the sour cream, and 1/2 teaspoon coconut curry powder for the paprika. Topped it with the Parmesan and Ritz mix. So delicious!

This is very tasty.  Made a few subs just because I did not have somethings on hand.  Used Gouda instead of Cheddar and pita chips instead of corn flakes.  I like seeing what others used also...that is the fun of it.

We loved this!  I think most people change around weekday recipes to use what they have on hand, and I did as well.  Used fresh cauliflower and subbed roasted red peppers, used 'shakey cheese' instead of fresh grated Parmesan, I did use fresh grated cheddar, panko crumbs with a little melted butter on top and dried thyme versus parsley.  Thanks for sharing!

The recipe as it is didn't quite work for me. I did like the sour cream based sauce but it needs more spices. The pepper don't work at all in this recipe. I already added a few carrots because I only had a small cauliflower. I think this recipe will be great for getting rid of leftover veg like carrots, kohlrabi, zucchini, broccoli and maybe beans. I did add nutmeg, chilli powder, cayenne pepper, parsley and za'atar to the sauce. I will have to add a bit more next time (maybe some garlic too) but it was going into the right direction.

Delicious and easy. I've been making this for years, and people who don't like cauliflower tend to love this. The cornflakes are the key ingredient, so don't substitute. I've tried using bread crumbs and crackers (because I was out of cornflakes), and it is not nearly as good. I also usually leave out the bell peppers, just because my family doesn't like them. But it's good with or without them. The paprika is really just to add some color, particularly if you're leaving out the bell peppers – so you would be fine leaving it out.

I added black pepper, garlic  powder and onion powder as well. An additional 1/4 sour cream (I used 1/2 fat) and some extra shredded cheese. Corn flakes on top gave it an extra crunch! My husband said it was "better than cheesy potatoes!"

This was delicious! I didn't use red pepper, just 1/2 cup of green. Try to find a big cauliflower as another reviewer said. It had the perfect amount of sauce for me. I'm thinking this would also be good with some hot peppers added in to give it some kick. Will definitely make this again.

If you make this recipe as written it is bland.  This is my second time and here are my changes. The key to this recipe is not to overlook the cauliflower. 
I roasted the cauliflower in olive oil and I seasoned with garlic salt and onion powder.  Roast 400 for 15-20 min.
I made the sauce but I thinned it out with heavy cream.  I added chopped onions and cheese.  I left out the corn flakes.  
Only headed enough to melt cheese and warm through since we like the crunch of the cauliflower.  Much more flavor!  And satisfied family.

We like this one a lot, but have always done it without the peppers. I never seem to have them when we need them. I just worked out the calories. If you use fat free sour cream, its approximately 120-130 calories(8 servings total). That's all going to depend on big the cauliflower head is. It's a nice filling side dish for those of us dieting.

We loved this recipe! Great variation of a cauliflower side dish. We omitted the green pepper and doubled the red pepper for added sweetness. And instead of corn flakes used French fried onions for added flavor. If someone else hasn't already done this I would be surprised. This dish is just begging for french fried onions. No need for that tsp of salt however in an already salty dish. Fantastic! Thanks for the great recipe!

Tasted okay, but didn't really work out as expected.  Could have been my sour cream...not sure. I used a half head of cauliflower (14 ounces) and the full amount of other ingredients. To save on dishes, I steamed the cauliflower in the microwave in the casserole dish then drained well, and then sprayed the inside edges of the dish with Pam.  Mixed the other ingredients in a large measuring cup and added them to the casserole dish.

Liked this recipe a lot.  Nice flavor.  I would leave out the cornflakes next time and maybe increase the amount of cheese and sour cream, just to make it creamier.

I doubled this recipe and took it to a potluck supper in an attractive casserole dish and it was the hit of the party! Everyone came up to me and complimented me on it. It was the only dish that was eaten to the last drop, so I would definitely do it again. The best thing was that cauliflower was on sale the day I made it, so even though the cheese was a little pricey, it was economical to make. By the way, I added two cloves of minced garlic and stir-fried it with the peppers a little beforehand. I also used cayenne instead of paprika to give it a little bite.

This was a good way to cook cauliflower.  I think it could use a tad more flavoring, so I plan on playing with it.  I'll make it again for sure!

So tasty!  I made just a couple modifications for what I had on hand, and it never hurts to have a few more vegetables.  Instead of 1/2 cup of peppers, I added 1 red pepper, 1 yellow pepper, and a vidalia onion (all sauteed); then used 16 oz of sour cream, 2 cups swiss cheese, and 3/4 cup bread crumbs.  Because of the extra volume, I had to use a 3-quart (9x13) pan.
I love that it's so easy to put together, and it's great comfort food - I could easily see this recipe becoming a staple side dish for the family Thanksgiving dinner!

Looking for a way to use up a head of cauliflower, this recipe did not disappoint with my family.   I had to use half sour cream and Greek yogurt because I ran out of sour cream.  The flavors went really well together and my family gobbled it down.  I also didn’t have corn flakes on hand so I subbed Panko™ for the cereal.  I did opt to put the paprika on the top.  We really enjoyed everything about this dish and it paired nicely with ‘Thai Quivering Tenderloins’ from AR.  Another dish that I will be making again.

Making it now for Fathers day, smells good!, was confused though, when mixing the ingredients they all balled up together since its thick, guessing when heated it will all melt and mix together?, could give it stars just based on smell right now since its still cooking

Good, but am I the only one that had a very watery casserole?  I thought I'd drained the cauliflower well, but maybe not?  Didn't have the peppers, so I threw in some pepper jack cheese; extra seasoning too.  Left the cornflakes (buttered) out to put on top to stay crispy.  May try again and let it drain for 1/2 hour or something!?

I make this recipe all the time!  For the most part it has replaced macaroni and cheese for me. No, it is not exactly the same, but a more healthful substitute. 

Plus, I bet the way I make it, it is gluten free too. I do not use the corn flakes. 

I do add 3 oz of neufchâtel cheese (or cream cheese) and usually use low/reduced fat cheese. 

A bit of crumbled bacon on top  when its finished doesn't hurt either!

I was looking for something different to make with cauliflower and this recipe was great!  I served this for lunch and it was a filing meal with a side salad.  I followed the instructions with one exception- instead of cornflakes, I used store-bought French- fried onions.  I put 4 ounces in the sour cream mixture and a little on top of the casserole prior to baking it. Halfway through the baking process I added about two ounces of water and then covered it.  It came out warm and delicious.  Thanks for a great idea!

I actually loved it better cold the next day! I did double the sour cream and cheddar as recomended by others, omitted the bell peppers, and added 1/4 cup chopped green onion, cayenne pepper and 1/4 cup lime juice.Substituted crushed wheat thin crackers for corn flakes. Will be making often!

I have used this recipe for years and tweaked it a bit I use 1/2 sour cream,1/2 mushroom soup and add a bit of salt and pepper other than that this recipe is awsome:)
