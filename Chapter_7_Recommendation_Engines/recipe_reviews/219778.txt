Love it.  I use the stove stop savory herbs.  Made it for the first time last week and the following weekend made it again.  Thanks so much.

i couldnt find ground turkey so i used chicken and it was a great recipe.... i can see why turkey is the better option because ground chicken is a little mushier but great none the less... A++ on this one!!

Family loved it - used chicken instead of turkey, and bbq sauce instead of mustard.

I used the corn bread stuffing rather than the one recommended.  It was fantastic and extremely easy!

I made this tonight for the first time and I was very impressed. It was super moist and delicious. It had a great flavor. My boyfriend said I beat his meatloaf hands down. Always good to hear. I accidentally forgot to add the egg & kicked it a tad longer to crisp the bacon. I made 6 servings. It was super moist. I substituted the mustard with homemade bbq sauce. I wish I would have added some on top to kind of carmelize the meal. I will be making this again!

Family really liked it. Even my 12 year old son, who usually doesn't like meatloaf, asked for 2nds. I did add an extra egg for more binding. Would have been OK without it. I also had to cook it for an hour and 10 mins.

This was an amazing meal. I changed it up a bit and added some carrots and apple sauce to the mixture. I also used a canberry glaze made up of whole cranberry squce, apple sauce and sugar. Half glaze on meatloaf and some extra on the side for a thanksgiving feel.

Made this twice. First time I followed the recipe exactly and thought that there was too much onion. The second time I only put in 1 green onion and it was great. I also omitted the cheese. Next time I may add cranberry sauce instead of mustard. Very tasty!!

Pretty good. I think next time though I'll use bread crumbs instead of the stuffing mix.

this recipe was delicious! I used yellow mustard and a little bit of BBQ sauce and paired it with some broiled asparaus.

Made this for dinner. Awesome, added two hard biled eggs to the center for a "small change".

Great meal! It could use some more salt but we did skip the cheese.  Easy recipe for a weeknight meal!

My husband loves this meatloaf! He actually prefers it to a beef meatloaf, and that's saying something. I have made it twice, once with the chicken stuffing as the recipe calls for and then once with the corn bread stuffing, as I had that on hand. Both were great. This is a part of our regular meal rotation.
