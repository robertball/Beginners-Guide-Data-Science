I made this salad especially for my husband - I am not a huge fan of fennel or raw onion, but he is. He is rating it 5 stars - yes, he understands the system. :) In my hurry to get through the grocery store, I accidentally grabbed dried cherries instead of cranberries - so I used them and they worked fine with this (although quite a bit more expensive I noticed later, so feel free to stick with cranberries). Thanks for the recipe - he would like to have it again soon! :)

Awesome! I have never used raw fennel and I am not a licorice fan. The flavors blend nicely together and the fennel and red onion blend very nicely, not strong like I thought they would be. The orange I cut the peel off and sliced crosswise then halved. Great flavor addition to the salad. Dressing was very nice, used dried basil about a tsp. MIL raved over the dressing and hubby didn't even mind fruit in his salad. Light refreshing salad. Thanks Chef4Six, it's a winner!

What a great flavor fennel has! This is a great combination of flavors for something different and refreshing. Sweet, citrus, licorice-hint taste- not overwhelming, just right.  Quick recipe. Oh--I did use green onion instead of red onion (out).  Milder perhaps than red onion...I think the vinegar would tone down the red onions strong flavor...and blend in very well too. Thank you for this colorful and creative recipe. For a meal...add grilled chicken.

Great salad-beautiful combination of colors and flavors.  I was too lazy to peel and section an orange, so I used a can of mandarin oranges instead.  Delicious!

This was great! I added a splash of fresh orange juice to the dressing - YUM. The 14 year old grandson screeched at the fennel till I assured him it wasn't an onion and then ate three helpings oblivious to the red onion that was in the salad.

We enjoyed this salad; I didn't have basil for the dressing, and didn't want to use that much sugar, so after adding probably about 2 TBSP sugar, I added some fig-balsamic vinegar to sweeten it. I also added a little more extra virgin olive oil. Tasty.
For the salad, I really liked the mixture of orange, fennel, red onion, and cranberries! Didn't have almonds so left those out. Will make again!

Best use of fennel EVER! Red wine vinegar dressing really makes the fennel mild and marries with the other favors brilliantly. Wasn't sure all those favors would work together but it is great. My friend ask to keep the leftovers; always a good sign! I added a cucumber because I had it and it worked also.  Don't toss with dressing until 5 minutes out on serving or else almonds get a little soggy,

I have never had a better salad, ever!!  It was so delicious !!  The only things I had to change were that I, being a fresh basil nut, couldn't stop at just ONE tablespoon!  I think I put about a quarter cup! And I only had the thinly sliced almonds you find at Costco.  Also I like my salad shaken up in a huge cake container so the dressing gets really well blended.  That was such a great salad, I'm going to serve it at one of my holiday dinners.  Thank you!!!

This was a fabulous salad.  Only change I made was I used Pecans w/black pepper and orange zest.  Grilled a couple Salmon steaks and that was dinner with a nice bread and glass of Chardonay. I was concerned the dressing would be too sweet, but it was great.  First time eating Fennel.  That was a nice addition to the salad.

Wonderful! I brought this to a dinner party and it was a big hit. I also used mandarin oranges. With their sweetness and the sweetened cranberries, I was able to cut the sugar in the dressing in half. Plan to make it often!

Didn't have salad greens, so used 10 oz snap peas & 10 oz green beans, but was true to all other ingredients. Amazing flavors!

I made this recipe as a way to use up left over fennel and it has become our favourite salad and everyone who's tasted it has asked for the recipe and asked me to make it again.  The combination of fennel and orange, along with the light and refreshing dressing, make it an outstanding choice.  Yum!!!

Glad I found this recipe!  Always wanted to try an orange/fennel salad and this was good.  I read some reviews and did a combo as I didn't have all ingredients on hand, and did not want a lot of sugar in the dressing.  Used cherries instead of cranberries, stevia and a little fig balsamic in addition to the red wine vinegar in the dressing, and added some dried basil to that (just a pinch) as I did not have fresh.  Very colorful and tasty.  Will be making this again and using the fresh basil.  Yum!

Because I had fennel and oranges from our produce co-op and lots of lettuce from the garden, I chose to try this recipe. It is not something I would ordinarily make. I cut the sugar by about 1/3, subbed pine nuts for almonds and green onion for red (all I had). It was VERY sweet. . . My husband ate it (jacks up my rating). If I make this again, I will not add the dressing beforehand, I will put the cruet on the table so that we can pour on as much or little as we want.

Made this to use up some leftover fennel.  Husband and I both really liked it.  Will use less sugar next time, however.

This is GREAT, especially if you have some grilled chicken on hand. I haven't tried pork, but, with the fennel..it might also work. (My husband loves fennel, and throws it on the grill, with a little olive oil. I take it, then, chop it up and add it to different salads..The best is my rice salad made with Italian salad dressing, scallions, cherry tomatoes, olives, mushrooms and mayonaisse.)

This salad is great for brining to a party. We used about 1/2 to 2/3 of the dressing and it was perfect. Anything more would be too much

This salad is refreshing, crunchy, and a nice change. I doubled the recipe and used spring mix and arugula. I toasted the almonds. The dressing - I followed the amounts but used citrus habanero olive oil and lime olive oil, and lemon infused balsamic vinegar and pineapple infused olive oil...that took the place of the sugar. I also used the red vinegar called for in the recipe. I took this to Friendsgiving and it was a hit.

This was delicious! I had never used fennel before but i bought some at the farmers market I wanted to try. I made exactly as directed but i added some cucumber i wanted to use up and i had dried cherries rather than cranberries.

I made this as directed and it was a hit at Easter dinner.  I did not have experience with fennel so I checked out a couple of you tube videos about how to clean and chop fennel.  I will definitely make this again.

I added some feta to top off the salad and it was quite good with it. Also this was my first time using fennel; very nice!

Absolutely amazing salad.  I have made this several times and everyone loves it.  After I made it the first time, I used a blood orange olive oil instead of plain so that made it extra delicious.  However, it is really good with plain olive oil also.

First time I every used fresh fennel and found it crunchy and slightly sweet. I made an orange vinaigrette to go with salad that went well with the orange. All the flavors blended well together.

This was very good - made it to bring to Easter dinner and everyone loved it.  I used a bag of spring greens plus a fair amount of romaine for a large bowl and used two oranges instead of one.  I also added a little orange zest to the dressing.  Even with this very large salad the amount of dressing the recipe made was way more than I needed.

This was a nice, fresh pairing with chicken schnitzel.  Doubled the orange for the salad.

Outstanding twist for a salad!! I have made it for numerous parties and everyone eats it all up. Although I can't find fennel at any of our grocery stores. Just use a variety of lettuce  choices.

a bit more prep than I like.  Very flavorful,  Good choice for us Floridians and a good summer salad for anywhere.
