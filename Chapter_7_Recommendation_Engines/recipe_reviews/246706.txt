Only had a small amount of hamburger. Cut the recipe in half. I saut√©ed a red pepper with the onion. Laid the crescent sheet out and put the loaf in the middle. Wrapped it up and sprinkled Everything Bagel over the egg wash. Delicious!

It came out very good...I added more egg & some rice to the meatloaf, was yummy.  Cooked it with cauliflower mashed & baby sweet peas and topped it with fresh mushroom gravy.
