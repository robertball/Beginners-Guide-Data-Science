This cookie-like pie is quick and easy. Great way to use up those egg whites. Very good with vanilla ice cream.

We did not like this dessert.  We crumbled it and ate it over ice cream, and then it was okay, but by itself it wasn't good.  I whipped the egg whites a little too long, so that probably did affect the outcome.

I've used this recipe from my Mom for many years and it is always a hit.  It makes a good alternative to pecan pie during the holidays.  The only difference is that I used 20 Ritz crackers, 1 cup pecans and 3/4 cup of sugar so that it isn't overly sweet.  You should double the recipe, because everyone will want seconds.
