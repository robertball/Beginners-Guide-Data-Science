I could not fine my 'Quick Velvet Cake' recipe; therefore, I added to this one. The cake was moist, delicious, and everyone asked for the recipe!  This is what I did:  I added 1 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup water, 1/3 cup Veg. Oil, 3 Eggs,
1 tsp. Vanilla to the box of White Cake Mix and
Chocolate pudding. I did not use buttermilk.
When I make a Red Velvet Cake I use half of the
amount of red food coloring the recipe calls for.
Why?  Because I do not like the taste of it!
Give this a try---you will be glad you did!!

This cake ranks a 5 for the simplicity and ease, but only a 2 for the taste, it was a little below average.  It is simple to make, and it turned out moist -almost TOO moist, therefore it was a bit heavy, and I had to adjust the baking time -this is probably due to the fact that the cake mix I used, already had pudding in the mix.  I noticed many people noted the "extras" that they added.  I think the part that puzzled people the most, were the instructions -perhaps they didn't read them?-  overall this would be a recipe that a young teen could make, but it wouldn't be anything I personally would not make again -it didn't have that "red velvet" cake taste.  It just pretty much seemed like a milk chocolate cake tinted red, instead of a cake w/ more depth.

Soooooo MOIST! My boyfriend and I LOVED it! And apparently so did my roomate, she ate 1/4 of the cake in one sitting! This is a great recipe for if you are short on time and/or patience... I actually used 5oz. of non-instant chocolate pudding, because that's all they had at the store, (and I don't know how to count oz.) I did as a lot of other people did and used a cream cheese frosting recipe. 5 STAR! I will be making this recipe again, and I think I will do as one reader suggested and try adding just a pinch of powdered sugar and a few drops of vanilla to this cake mix. 

Muncha! Muncha! Muncha!

I made this cake twice in a couple of days (for two different parties) and it was wonderful.  Very moist.  I bought sour cream icing for the frosting but it will probably be just as tasty without the icing.

This was my first Red Velvet cake so perhaps I am not the best judge.  The recipie was easy but the taste was not outstanding.  My husband, who loves cake, was not thrilled by this either.  I'll keep looking.

This cake was excellent!  I made this for my boyfriend for his birthday, and he loved it!  Very tasty, especially with home made cream cheese frosting.  Could hardly tell the difference between this and a made-from-scratch red velvet.  I am not a very experienced cook, so I was a little afraid to try to make red velvet cake the hard way, but this is a very simple and tasty alternative!  I definitely recommed to everybody!

I rated 4 stars as is, because I made several modifications to this recipe.  I made the same subs as others, (cake mix, chocolate pudding, 1c sour cream, 1/3c oil, 3 eggs, 1/2c water, 1tsp vanilla) but also suggest adding 1-2Tbs cocoa powder (depending on how much chocolate flavor you want).  I also added 1oz. Red Food Coloring.  I make cupcakes because I can freeze some and eat a few right away.  These cupcakes were perfect, and that's according to someone who loves Red Velvet cake, and his co-workers.  I frosted these cupcakes with White chocolate cream cheese icing (I used the icing from the "Carrot Cupcakes with White Chocolate Cream Cheese Icing" recipe found on this site (minus the orange extract, 4oz chocolate, 16oz cream cheese and 4Tbs heavy cream).    These cupcakes were fabulous and this recipe was a big hit, and in no way felt like the science project that a traditional Red Velvet Cake recipe may have been. *Note: You should not freeze cream cheese icing, so if you intend to use this icing and freeze cupcakes you will need to freeze cupcakes without icing and make fresh icing when u want to thaw them later or make a different icing that you can also freeze.

I followed this recipe as written and FINALLY found a Red Velvet Cake recipe that's a keeper!  I prefer a heavier, denser cake and found this to fit that bill.  Frosted the cake with cream cheese frosting and kept refrigerated until served.  Yummy!

I substitued French Vanilla cake mix for the white.  This made it very moist. It turned out to be the easiest and best Red Velvet Cake I have ever tasted.

Moist, light and very fluffy, all a plus.  But the lack of any real flavor other than sweet cake mix is definitely a real minus.  I had no illusions about this tasting like red velvet cake, so I didn't even bother adding the red food coloring.  But I did expect an interesting flavor - milk chocolate, maybe, because of the white cake mix and chocolate pudding?  Another thing I expected and this recipe confirmed, is that buttermilk is a real asset in a cake mix (just as it is in most baked goods). In this case, as mentioned above, this meant a light, fluffy, moist cake.  I used the batter for cupcakes and topped them with a chocolate cream cheese frosting.

I made pretty much the same substitutions as many of the reviewers, adding 1/3 c oil, 1/2 c water, 3 eggs, the chocolate pudding mix, and 1 tsp vanilla to the cake mix. I also added about 1 1/3 c sour cream to finish off the container, and a bit of sugar (1/4 c) to counteract the extra sour cream. And it was FABULOUS. The cake was definitely moist enough and was just scrumptious. Yes, this is the lazy way out and I do have a feeling that if I slaved over a from-scratch red velvet recipe all day, it probably would have been better. But listen, this took me all of 10 minutes...and I LOVED it. So there :]

I made this for a friend's birtday and Red Velvet Cake is his absolute favorite.  Everyone at the party raved over it, and the birthday boy said that it was the best he'd ever had, and he eats it every year on his birthday.  It was really really easy as well.

I needed to whip up a batch of red velvet cupcakes for a 40th birthday party...the hostess of the party provided this recipe.  I am so glad she did. These will be made frequently in my house.  So simple and delicious!

This is a great recipe for a quick and easy red velvet cake.  I decided to make cupcakes last-minute for a friend's birthday and needed something special but not too labor-intensive and this was perfect.  I used the whole 1 oz bottle of red food coloring and though the batter looked sort of pinkish, it baked up quite red (not as dark as a true red velvet cake though).  I used cream cheese frosting (I use a plastic bag with a corner snipped out as a piping bag and swirl the frosting on; it looks fancy and is actually a lot faster, easier and less messy than frosting with a knife!) and also topped with some red sprinkles.  I received a lot of compliments and the cupcakes themselves were soft and moist.

My husband's favorite cake is red velvet, so I decided to make one for his birthday--New Year's Eve.  It turned out great and was nice and moist.  I'd definitely do this cake again.  Thanks!

I was looking for a recipe to make fast and easy red cupcakes for a playoff party (Go Flames Go)and this was it. I decorated them with bright yellow frosting and some flaming C's and they were ready to go. In terms of taste I thought they were only okay, not amazing.

This was such a waste of ingredients- not worth the effort. The texture looked similar to playdough after it was cooked- I couldn't even get all the neighborhood kids to eat it. Bad flavor, texture. Skip this one.

Made this for Christmas, and it was loved by all!  Made it in a bundt pan, and topped it with bourbon cream cheese frosting...delicious (super moist and flavorful)!  Loved the simplicity of this, and will definitely make again.

A very good and easy cake recipe for red velvet except I did not find it as satisfying as the "Hershey" homemade version.  Still worth trying for a quick & easy fix.

Nothing special, but then again I'm not a huge fan of cake to begin with. I have had a few recipes that knocked-my-socks-off, but this was not one of them. Sorry.

The only reason I gave this recipe a 2 was for how moist it is. It is NO where NEAR being a true Red Velvet cake. A true Red Velvet cake is blood red, moist and has a "tang" to it given by the buttermilk and vinegar. I was so disappointed in this and this is the first recipe I have used from this site that I wasn't raving about. This is NOT close to being a Red Velvet cake. Sorry!!! NO GO!!!!!!

I made this cake for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day.  I don't really understand how some people thought this had a horrible taste, it's just cake mix plus chocolate pudding!  I only used 50 drops of red food coloring so it wasn't very red, and had some problem getting it out of the pans because the cake is less dense than a plain cake mix.  However, it tasted very good and went well with cream cheese frosting.  You couldn't even tell where the cake had been pulled apart when coming out of the pan.  Next time I'll probably just bake it in a 9 by 13 pan so I can just leave it in the pan to frost and serve! Thanks!

Nothing like true Red Velvet Cake, tastes like what you would expect, a heavy chocolate pudding cake. Not a bad recipe, but definitely not Red Velvet Cake. Very disappointed.

i love this recipe! it's so easy, and makes a delicious and moist cake. i added 3 tbsp powdered sugar and 1 tsp vanilla like somebody suggested. i also frosted it with cream cheese icing (8 oz cream cheese, 1/2 c. butter, 1 tsp vanilla, 4 c. powdered sugar), and it was even more delicious.

my only complaint was that i baked it in 2 8-inch pans and it had really high, rounded tops. maybe if i made it in bigger pans it wouldn't do that.

I made the cake with the changes suggested by another user: I added 1 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup water, 1/3 cup Veg. Oil, 3 Eggs, 1 tsp. Vanilla.  It was just okay - not something I would make again and definitely not something that got rave reviews.

Very good not to be homemade.Fooled everyone but my Mom. I added 1 1/2 tsp. almond extract. Made in tube pan and used cream cheese frosting. Definately a keeper when you don't have time to bake scratch.

Cake was definately yum, but not a true red velvet. Made it layered, with white chocolate cream cheese frosting. Sooo simple, worth making for sure, and I will make it again, however, I'll alter the recipe some.

So easy!  I was dumb and bought a 5 oz. package of pudding instead of 3.5, but it still turned out great.  I hope this will be a Christmas tradition for us.  But I hope I will learn *not"* to eat so much it makes me sick!  Yummy!

This recipe makes fantastic cupcakes! I used french vanilla cake mix and added substituted a little extra buttermilk vs. water and these turned out great! In addition, this recipe was so simple as compared to red velvet from scratch. I definitely recommend this recipe!

I picked this recipe because I've been dying to have some red velvet but just didn't have the time to do a real one.  It was pretty good, you could definately tell it was a cheater red velvet but it still tasted great.  It did take longer to cook than the cake box instructions said, about 10 extra minutes which made the top a little hard.  I was layering the cake though so I just cut it off anyways.

This cake was soooo DRY! It tasted very good, but even with cooking it less than the suggested time it turned out very dry. I wouldn't make it again.

I'm sorry to say I didn't try the original recipe. I used the adjustments that wilddaycare suggested. It won a taste test over the old Betty Crocker recipe with 8 testers ages 54 to 2yrs old:)

GO EAGLES!  Insted of red velvet I made these into green velvet cupcakes for Super Bowl Party at work and they were a hit.  Simply switch red for green food coloring.  I used a mock whipped cream frosting recipe that has been in my family for years.  Thanks for the short cut.  EAGLES all the way.

The taste was ok, but to me it was dry.  My daughter liked it; she is the red velvet nut around here. I made it for her birthday.  Will keep searching for something better.

Its quick and so easy. I have to say that cake mix quality makes a difference. Use high end white cake mix and this will be fool proof and delicious. The family loves it. Great for cupcakes too!

I've made this as a cake and cupcakes.  I don't care for red velvet cake at all but everyone seems to love it when I do.  I don't use buttermilk just because I never have it on hand.  I use whatever I have including soured milk and it's always a hit:-)

I have been making red velvet cakes from scratch since I was a kid, this is a very good recipe. I follow the recipe as written except I only use half the amount of red food coloring, that's all it needs. I added 1/4 cup of flour for high altitude. I've made several wedding cakes with this recipe, it's good and sturdy, but still flavorful and moist. Frost with a nice cream cheese icing.

Omg, One of my favorite cakes is red velvet cake but when I'm busy doing other things I have to eat the storebought dessert version.  So now that I know a quicker way to make it life has been more delicious.

I tried this cake, with all of the substitutions suggested by the user wilddaycare which included adding 1 cup of sour cream, 3 eggs, 1/2 cup of water, 1/3 cup of veg oil, 1tsp of vanilla flavor, and I used 1/2 bottle of red food coloring and it was the perfect tint.  I give the cake 3 stars because based on the revisions I made, the cake was very, very moist and good, however, it tasted NOTHING like a red velvet cake. I honestly don't think it would have been anything compared to this without the revisions. My husband said it tasted like a chocolate cake that so happen to be red lol.  The texture of the cake was different.  I will try the recipe again, but will try other substitutions suggested by other users such as using buttermilk instead of water, possibly adding coa coa and a little vinegar. Oh I made cream cheese frosting fro scratch so this made the cake even better.

My family loved this cake.  It disappeared in two days.  This one is a keeper for the holidays.
