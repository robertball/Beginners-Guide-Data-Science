This is a really good martini.  Not too sweet, and you feel like you're really having a martini.  I did tweek a bit, extra dash of juice, a splash more lemon juice, but otherwise it is good as written.

Awesome- but I apparently can't run with the big boys. 1 oz juice to the vodka wasn't enough. I used 3 oz juice instead and it was yummy!
