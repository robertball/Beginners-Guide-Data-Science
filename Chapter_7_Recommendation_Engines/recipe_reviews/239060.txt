This was very good and a nice change from the plain ole rice side.  I found it needed at least twice the amount of soy sauce if not more.   I probably ended up with almost a tablespoon in there and my husband was still reaching for the salt.  It cooked up perfectly with the times stated.

This recipe was in my e-mail today.  I was looking for a recipe for spinach.  I substituted chicken broth for water.  Added extra soy & 
extra garlic sauce.  Used toasted sesame sauce.  Not the  seeds.  Not a fan.  I know that I'll get a lot of grief for a review with substitutions, but today there's sleet & ice outside so I'll settle for spinach.

This was very good, and I'm glad to have another way to squeeze in healthy Bok Choy.  I did use extra Soy Sauce and a dash more Spicy Thai Chili Sauce which was the closest I could find to chili-garlic sauce.  I served it with Soy-Honey-Ginger broiled Salmon (from a cookbook, not from this site sorry!).  I used Jasmine Rice instead of White Rice and the cooking time and water to rice ratios were tricky so I had to wing it and it still turned out very good.  Thanks Chef John!  Loved the video too.  :-)  See my photo!

I added more soy and chili sauce like other reviews recommended. It was awesome and totally hit the spot when I was craving cold Chinese food the next morning too!

I used my rice cooker for this, and started out by doubling the amount of rice to 2 cups. I was surprised at the water-to-rice ratio in the recipe, as I always do 2:1 water to rice, but I gave it a try, thinking maybe the water in the bok choi would help.

Sure enough, the rice was way undercooked by the time the cooker shut off,  with only 3 cups of water and the bok choi stems. So I added another cup of water.

The soy sauce amount was too little so I added a lot more to taste. Same with the chili pepper and garlic.

As for the sesame seeds, really, only 1/4 teaspoon in the original recipe? Even doubling it for my doubled trial was not enough, but I love sesame seeds so I added a couple tablespoons of them.

The whole thing was sticky, messy-looking, and bland. To my serving in a bowl, I added more sesame oil, garlic and pepper sauce, and soy sauce to make it palatable.

Maybe this is meant to be a bland dish and I just prefer spicier foods. Better that I make a pot of plain rice and have fresh greens separately than try to mix them in a hot dish.

this was our first time using Bok choy and we loved it.  The only change we did was curry paste and garlic powder  for the sambal...all we had.

I love this but I used wild rice and instead of water I used chicken.  I would definitely cook this again....probably by the end of the week as my husbands garden is producing the most beautiful bok choy.

I’ve never made bok choy and this just caught my eye. Delicious! Messed up on directions and put everything in with the rice (except the leaves) but it turned out fine.  I used Trader Joe’s soyaki in place of the sauce and a dash more soy sauce but thought it was plenty seasoned. I was worried the water was not enough but it turned out perfect. I want to try with brown rice next.

My family liked this rice and wants me to make it again. I didn't even add the soy sauce.  Not because I don't like it or felt it wouldn't work with the other ingredients.  I didn't have any! 

I normally have some in the house but nope not this time.  I will add it next time I make this dish. 

I didn't give it five stars only because I didn't add the soy sauce so I didn't follow the recipe as written

Love the concept of healthy and creative! This is what interested me in this recipe. I was pleased with the it however, after following the directions my rice did not cook through. It has promise but, I think the time needs to be adjusted.

I made this last evening as a side for a pork stir fry. I followed the recipe but omitted the sambal as I didn't want it to compete with the flavors of the stir fry. This recipe is a good way to add extra fiber to the meal and dress up plain rice. The toasted sesame seeds complete the dish visually. As a Westerner who lived in Hong Kong, I couldn't bring myself to add the soy sauce to the uncooked rice. Soy sauce was on the table for those who wished to add it. Thanks for the idea Chef John, I'll add it to my repertoire.

This recipe was a surprise hit in my household. I didn't make enough. It was a very simple recipe that was super tasty and I was able to get the kids to eat more veggies.
