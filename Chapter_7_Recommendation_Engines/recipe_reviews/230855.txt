I love it when I'm the first reviewer of a recipe and it's a winner - and such is the case here!  I wasn't sure I was going to like the lemon mixed with the cinnamon but I'm so glad I gave it a try.  This is a cute, soft, buttery little Snickerdoodle of a cookie with just a hint of  fresh lemon.  No, actually this is more cinnamony than a Snickerdoodle because there's cinnamon in the dough here.  I also generally don't like soft cookies but THIS soft cookie is gooood.  My only criticism, and it's a small one that in no way affects the cookie, is that there was probably twice as much of the cinnamon-sugar mixture than I needed.  I'll consider it that I'm ahead of the game, because now I have a batch of cinnamon-sugar all mixed up and ready to go for the next time I make these or maybe to sprinkle on muffins!

These are yummy and very cinnamon-y!  Like a super cinnamon snickerdoodle with a hint of lemon.  I cut the cinnamon-sugar mixture in half, and STILL had a lot left over.  Also, I only got 40 cookies, using a small cookie scoop (each ball being about 1" in diameter).  Baked for about 12 minutes.  They are crispy on the outside, and soft and chewy on the inside.  So nice with a glass of cold milk!  I couldn't stop eating them!

These were really good.  I did not have a lemon to zest so I replaced the zest with 2 tsp of lemon juice. I did not have time to refrigerate them for 2 hrs but just baked them right after mixing them up and they turned out thin, crisp, and yummy. The recipe only made 3 dozen cookies, but maybe I just made them bigger than I was suppose.

I don't understand why some baked goods improve so much overnight but, these cookies got about 60% better overnight. After they cooled completely and my husband and I had about 5 apiece, I put them in a big ziplock bag because I wanted these soft cookies to stay soft. I thought they were good last night, but not spectacular. And not as good as the other reviewers thought they were. Well, today I reached for one and now I DO think they are spectacular. Soft, buttery little mounds of cinnamon/lemon deliciousness. However, I do have a problem with how few cookies this recipe actually makes.  I doubled the recipe as I intended to send some to my grandkids. Even doubling the recipe only yielded 70 cookies. And I made them quite small, only forming the balls to 1-inch size. The picture accompanying the recipe shows a much larger cookie. It is, unfortunately misleading. I should have gotten 120 cookies by doubling the recipe or at least over 100. And these came out so small they looked like dog treat cookies. But for the discrepancy in the number of cookies, I would have rated this cookie 5 stars. Any ideas as to why some bakers got many less cookies from this recipe? I stuck to the recipe except for doubling it and I used the adjustment feature Allrecipes has to change proportions.

This is the first recipe I have taken the time to rate. Both my husband and I rate this 5 stars. The lemon zest adds a welcome taste of light -  reminding us of spring!

I was curious to try the double taste of lemon and cinamon and it s a winner !
After reading the others comments though I decided 1) to double all the ingredients and 2) to go for more lemon by crushing a whole organic lemon and add it to the dough. 
The proportion THEN for taste and quantity (about 60 small cookies) was just the right one.

It turned out great. The only thing is that I added a little lemon juice because the lemon zest wasn't enough.

These are great tasting cookies! They are pretty tedious in my opinion but worth the effort. I did not get 60 cookies but that is because it is only me and my husband and so I made them into about 24 or so regular sized cookies. The lemon zest is the only thing I increased because I really wanted the lemon flavor. These are very good cookies.

These were absolutely amazing. I loved the little bits of lemon in this and I will definitely make these again next time.

Did what it said to do but did not like the texture turned out flat and the lemon flavor just was not there enough. I don't like snicker doodles.
 But thanks anyway.
