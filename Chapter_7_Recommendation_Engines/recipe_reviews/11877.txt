I have made this twice with rave reviews both times.  Once for work and once for home.  I did change a couple of things though.  I don't pre-cook the noodles and that takes care of the "watery" thing that some have complained about.  I prepare it the night before and place it in the fridge.  Then when you cook it the next day, the noodles come out perfect.  I also saute onions and garlic powder in olive oil and mix that with the soup mixture.  Sprinkle black olives over the top just before baking and it comes out perfect.  Great texture and flavor and sooooo simple!  A real keeper.

I found this receipe to be a nice change from the traditional hamburger lasagna, but my family declared that this receipe did not have enough flavor and that it was too runny.  I am going to try it one more time though, but thicken the sauce and add more seasoning.

What a great recipe!
Here are the changes I made: I only used 1 can of soup, and I added onion and garlic to the white sauce, along with onion and garlic powder for a flavorful (not too "runny" sauce).
Listen, it was 110 outside, yet my entire family enjoyed this wonderful lasagna.
Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This lasagna is soo good!  The only thing I did different was to add some garlic and mushrooms. My whole family loved it, I definitely will make again!

This was a good recipe.  I made this for a dinner group I had and everybody seemed to enjoy it.  I did however make some variations:
1.Reduce to one can of soup.
2.Use fresh spinach and sautee it with olive oil and minced garlic.
3.Use chicken in only the middle layer.
4.Use fine ground sausage (spicy if that's your taste) to sprinkle on top.
5.I also used a bit of Romano cheese on the top.
The great thing about it is that it's a good base recipe, and you can add dozens of variations to suite your own taste.

I love this recipe, and have made it dozens of times for friends and family.  I did make however use fresh spinach instead of frozen.  I love black olives and mushrooms, and so I added them too.  Delish, everyone always wants more!  I do always have a little leftover of the mix so I end up making some quiche with that and works out yummy.

I made this for dinner and it was very yummy! I think I will season the chicken more as I cook it next time for more flavor and I used the noodles that do not have to be boiled. My husband's comment was "you got me to eat spinach!"

This recipe was awesome. I did saute the chicken with onion and garlic, and seasoned it with salt and pepper. Increased the mozzarella from 1 1/3 to 2 cups. Used reduced fat ricotta and mozzarella and it came out FABULOUS. Will definitely make it again. Thank you for the recipe.

This did not work with our family.  My husband is not a fan of spinach, I guess.  I thought it was too runny.

This is a good recipe.  I used alfredo sauce in place of the soup and used less milk.  It was EXCELLENT.  Received many compliments.

Just a hair bland and 2 cans of condensed soup was too much.  Will definitely doctor it up with garlic and pepper next time and cut a can of soup out of the recipe.

I really enjoy this recipe!!  I did make changes though.  While I like spinach, the rest of the family does not, so I sauteed minced fresh onion, a heaping tsp of minced garlic and two chopped carrots and used that in the place of the spinach.  I also used two rounded tablespoons of pesto in the ricotta mixture AND used two mesquite marinated chicken breasts instead of plain.  I too found the cheese/soup mixture too liquidy and only used one can of soup.  Hope this helps!

I just made this for dinner last night and it turned out great! My fiance loved it. Since it is just the two of us, we have enough to take for lunch. I am eating it right now at work and it tastes even better for lunch the next day! Thanks for the great recipe. I did however use condensed cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic instead of the regular soup. Don't know if that made any difference but it tasted great!

I wish I had paid better attention to the ingredients and made some adjustments to this recipe.  As written, I found it to be bland.  I think it has some potential, but next time, I will add garlic, onions, more spices and maybe some stronger cheese.

Ok, I know everybody hates it when you review something that you didn't follow the recipe EXACTLY, but I had to put my 2 cents in... The first thing I noticed when I read this recipe: WHERE'S THE GARLIC?? Or any seasoning, for that matter?? This recipe was a great base for what I had on hand, but as-is, this seems like it would be way too bland, and I think a lot of other reviewers said the same. I sauteed some minced garlic (about 2 cloves) in olive oil, then cooked the chicken in the garlic/oil. Seasoned with onion powder, a bit of garlic salt, black pepper & italian seasoning blend, and I also added garlic powder, pepper, & italian seasoning to the cheese mixture (can't really give a measurement, we just add until it tastes right in our house ;P). Didn't have spinach, so I used broccoli instead, and upped the amount of mozzarella by probably another half cup. End result was OUTSTANDING!!! With modifications, or using just as a base recipe to alter to your own tastes, this is a 5 star starter recipe; quick, simple, and easy to make your own.

I took this to a church supper last night and everyone liked it.  I added garlic powder, oregano and basil, and used cottage cheese instead of ricotta (personal preference).  I also used the flat noodles, uncooked, and mine was not runny at all.

Ive tried a few other chicken lasagnas recipes in here, but find we like this one the best, with a few changes.  I use the fresh flat lasagna noodles that you can buy in most grocery stores.  I also used fresh spinach, chopped and microwaved for approx 2 mins on high.  I didnthave any ricotta, so used a 250g tub of lite chive & herb cream cheese. I ran the spinach, cr cheese and eggs together in the food processor. Just mixing until blended.  I then mixed with soup mixture as directed.  When it came to putting it together, I changed the first step as I am use to a layer of sauce then pasta on the bottom. I then added the diced chicken, sauce then pasta again. I also put a layer of parchment paper in my 9x13. This saves so much trouble in clean up afterwards.  With using the flavoured cream cheese it gave the lasagna the flavour it needed. I will make this again, as its a winner with my family.

Made exactly as recipe called for and was disappointed. Very bland and tasteless, also runny. I feed 5 teenage boys daily, and must say that I ended up throwing most of this one away which is VERY rare in my house.

This is a very tasty dish. One of the ladies in the office makes this, and tops it with stuffing mix, and cheese about 10 minutes before it is done. It adds a great flavor to the dish. If you do not like stuffing, just leave it off, and top with cheese, olives, and tomatoes.

Very good.  I followed the advice of others and cute the soup down to 1 can.  The only other thing I did was use wheat noodles, they are a little hearty than regular noodles so I didn't have to worry about it being watery. It was a hit here at our house.

To make this recipe I have to use gluten free noodles and have replaced the condensed soup with progresso since they don't use wheat in their soup (and since it's not condensed, I eliminated the milk). I also replaced the frozen with fresh spinach and took the advice of others and sauteed onions, fresh garlic and mushrooms and added it to the soup. This time I also sliced up some chunk mozzarella and replaced some of the shredded with it. Yum Yum, I can't wait to dig in!

I made this with my mom to feed my siblings. They ate it up and loved it. I also used cream of chicken soup and used the whole can (26 oz.) as opposed to the ricotta cheese and grated 2 1/2 cups of cheese and used the 1 1/3 cup in the recipie and used the remaing 1 1/6 cup for the top.

we liked this, however, next time use half the spinach and maybe add some garlic- i agree with the others, it needed just a little more flavor- but a nice change from the traditional!

I cooked according to the recipe with the exception of adding a little more mozzarella cheese. Next time I am going to add some season as the recipe has potential.  Keep you posted on the 2nd go around!

This is a family favorite!  I've made this several times and my sister even made a several trays for my wedding shower.  I do add garlic to the chicken when cooking it but that's the only change.

I didn't realize until AFTER I made the recipe that it called for TWO cans of soup. Using one was perfect. Lasagna was not runny in the least. Very flavorful. Thanks!

I took everyone's advice and cut down on the milk but it ended up way too dry. Other than that it was pretty good.

This recipe was good. My husband really liked it he said it is a change from regular lasagna and so did my six year old. I did change some things i used 1 can of cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom. I used only 1 cup of milk and i added seasonings to the mixtures. This is a keeper!

Added a carton of fresh mushrooms and some grape tomatoes for some added flavor and it turned out great. My only complaint was that the sauce was a bit thin.

This was so awesome!!! A nice change of pace from the traditional tomato-based lasagna. I didn't think my family would like it, but they devoured it! Even my six year old was scraping his plate. I followed the recipe to the letter, as I always do to be fair to the rating. Will be making this instead of the traditional lasagna.

I made this recipe today to serve for tonight's football game. I used fresh spinach (cuts out the water issue) and no boil noodles. I also add fresh sliced tomatoes for some extra flavor.

After reading a couple of reviews I changed the recipe slightly: 1 cup of whole milk, 15oz whole milk ricotta, sauteed chicken breast with onions and minced garlic, added salt pepper to sautee and to sauce. I also precooked the "oven ready" noodles because my husband HATES hard noodles. The lasagna is now warming up the trash barrel and I'm hanging my head in shame. It was practically flavorless even with the addition of onions and minced garlic! My kitchen was almost devoid of dinner aroma. The icing on the cake - it was so soupy that it was almost impossible to eat with a fork. I don't know what to recommend for a firmer end result other than precook the noodles and omit milk and canned soup entirely.

Even with the suggestions to add garlic, onion and mushrooms, we found this to be quite bland, but not runny.  It was by no means bad, but just "eh."

I was on a quest for a good chicken lasagna recipe.  Despite the other reviews, I still tried this recipe, giving it the benefit of the doubt.  I was sadly disappointed.  I reduced the amount of milk, used no-boil noodles, and it still turned out a mushy, runny mess.  It was very monotone in color and texture, even with the spinach.  My boyfriend ate it, but he eats anything.  He did say that he probably won't request me to make this dish again, which suprised him because he usually loves the lasagna I make.  If you're looking for a good chicken lasagna recipe, keep looking, there's got to be a better one out there.

My son(13) gave it a thumbs up, my daughter(15) said too much green stuff 
and not enough spice.  I agree w/my daughter.  It was easy enough to mix 
all the ingredients though.

I rated this recipe a 4 because of the changes I made to it but it was still delicious.I followed previous reviewers' suggestions and added pepper and onions and garlic which had been sauteed in olive oil to the soup mixture. I also added half a can of sliced mushrooms and reduced the milk to 3/4 c. I used no-boil lasagna noodles and sprinkled some sliced black olives on top just before popping the lasagna into the oven. It was great! Not runny at all. My son wouldn't try it at first because he doesn't like spinach but he did eat a serving of it after watching me wolf mine down. He gave it a 3-star rating. That's impressive coming from a spinach hater! Thanks Holly!

Definitely add salt, pepper, garlic. Reducing amount of soup & milk slighlty helped make less runny. (Make sure to squeeze all excess water from spinach, too!) Use a LARGE egg. I added the Parmesan cheese TO the spinach mixture (instead of sprinkling on top) -- it helped FLAVOR! And I used the no-bake lasagna noodles. They worked great!

I used cooked ground chicken and a little less soup (I live in Switzerland and actually used boxes of mushroom sauce from the grocery store in place of soup), and pre-cooked lasagna noodles -  worked great and hubby liked it. It's good comfort food - the mushroom sauce gave it good flavor, and my stomach is happy that it's not spicy. Will probably make it again - very easy compared to the more traditional red lasagna I made recently.

Made this for dinner for my family and they loved it. It was very good . I did 2 cups of Parmesan and I cooked the spinach with the chicken. Next time I'm just gonna use one can of the cream of mushroom so that it's not as liquidy .

I would give this dish a five for its easiness to prepare.  My family really enjoyed it and we aren't ricotta lovers. I prepared as written, but next time I make it I'll add some onion or garlic because I thought it was a bit bland.

Very good meal. I think this recipe would be great for a seafood lasagna - just substitute seafood for the chicken & I will use broccoli/cauliflower instead of spinach.

This recipe is awesome following the exact recipe.  The only changes I made was that I put chicken on each layer just because I made too much. Instead of adding the final two cups of mozzarella cheese, I used Mexican style, only because I ran out of mozzarella and I just used what I had in my refrigerator. I Thank you for providing this recipe.

Because others said it was bland, I sauté d two large cloves of garlic  disced fine, just till I could smell it..  I mixed the garlic with the spinach and the ricotta .  For the cheese I used one cup of Italian Blend shredded cheese and one cup of  mozzarella .  I used the no cook lasagna noodles. but I saved some of the sauce to put on the top layer of lasagna noodles, because of them being no cook noodles.  Then I sprinkled about 1/2 cup of Mozzarella  and the 1/2 cup of  Parmesan  on top ..  I think I baked it about 50 minutes.   I took it as my dish to bring for an occasion.  Everyone loved it.   I will make it again.  This will be a football dish.

When I made this recipe, it was a bit watery and it wasn't quite what I had in mine. A  couple of things I would recommend are bread crumbs or more cheese between layers to soak up the spinach mixture, as well as covering the dish with foil when baking. Other than that, it was delicious! Plan on trying it again!

The flavor was great, but it was extremely soupy. Next time, I'll only use 1 can of soup. I would also probably add a thickener.  Overall, it was great.  I will definitely make it again.

It was great and everybody loved it. I did make some moderations though.  I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom.  I also added mushrooms and spinach as veggies.  I also used mozzarella and cheddar cheese throughout as well. I will be making this again!!!
