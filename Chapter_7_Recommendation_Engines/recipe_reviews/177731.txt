My husband and I really liked this recipe. The only things I would do different is use half an onion and cut the beef into smaller pieces. Tasted great and I loved that it is served on pastry shells. Will definitely make it again!

Not bad if you remove the "Campbell'sÂ® Slow Roast Beef Gravy" and add your own home made gravy. by the way the picture has nothing to do with this recipe. I do prefer it over noodles but the pastry shells from pepperidge farms is always good with just about anything. It tastes better with real fresh garlic, and not powdered garlic.

My husband and I loved this dish.  I'm not a big fan of thyme so I think I will leave that out next time.

Good flavor - we like onion so I used all of it.  I added garlic as well and that I would recommend!  I should have used a better cut of meat - a little chewy - but everyone ate it!

It wasn't bad, but a bit bland.  And I usually like for this dish to be creamier.
