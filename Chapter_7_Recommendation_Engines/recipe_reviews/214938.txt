This recipe was just okay.  I thought the crab should have been broken up more.  I used tilapia  and it was really difficult to roll it.  Not a hit with my family.  They also felt it had too much crab.  Maybe more mayo and less crab.

This was easy to make! I only had sliced mozzarella so I just tore pieces and laid on the fish before placing the filling on the fish, instead of mixing shredded mozz in the stuffing mix. I used canned white crab meat. I didn't have minced onion so used a little onion salt and left out regular salt at the end. Just added pepper.

This was sooo tasty, and with IMITATION CRAB to boot! I'm giving it 5 stars even though I did things just a tad differently: I used Basa fillets (it was all I had), omitted the mozzarella cheese (although I might try Parmesan next time), and only added some lemon zest to the mayo. I also brushed some extra sauce onto the fillets and sprinkled with breadcrumbs before baking uncovered. Very delicious served with some rice and steamed broccoli. Who knew that imitation crab could make plain old fish so yummy! I will definitely be making this again :)

This is one of my favorite fish recipes. I often use more imitation crab than required, so I simply top the fish with crab. No complaints from me. Easy, quick, delicious.

Substituted Tilapia for Sole.  Tasted great!  Only thing was I couldn't roll up the tilapia,  so I kind of just topped it with the crab mixture.  Very nice & relatively healthy recipe.

Tasted great and easy to make. I used canned crabmeat and havarti cheese as it was what we had in the house. Will definitely make this again!

Made it, family loved it! I used cheddar instead of mozza and added a bit of onion and old bay seasoning to the stuffing!

I cut the recipe back to two portions and used fresh Dover sole.  I couldn't find imitation crab so I used imitation lobster. Nice flavour but I found that there was too much of the stuffing. If I were to make this again I would cut the stuffing back to 1 portion and use two sole fillets. Thanks for sharing.
