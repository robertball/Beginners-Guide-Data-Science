Very tasty.  I did not use guiness as I had a Founders Porter instead.  I also used coleslaw mix instead of cabbage & added fresh mushrooms.  This smelled heavenly during the last hour of cooking.

Very good! I read previous comments about the gravy not thickening so I added some of the leftover flour from the chicken drench to the broth and ale mix.  this made the gravy amazing thick and wonderful. I will make again.

This was really good, the chicken was super moist. Added a little rosemary, garlic, and crushed red pepper. I did use brussel sprouts instead of cabbage because that is what I had (mini cabbages, right?) and they were a delicious addition. I would make this again and the wife looooved it.

I made no changes to the recipe, and we liked it. The "gravy" wasn't as thick as I would have liked, maybe increase the cornstarch by 1 tablespoon to make it a little thicker. The chicken was very moist and flavorful. I did baste the chicken and top veggies a few times during baking, which I would recommend doing. I would like to try this with wine instead of the stout.

I definitely would make it again.  It would be a good "company" dish.  Hearty fare!  I didn't use the cabbage (because I didn't have any).  I did add onions since I am a real onion fan.  Next time, I would salt the chicken instead of putting the salt in the seasoning mix.  I like the idea of using the flour mixture to thicken the gravy.  Thanks for posting!
