I decided to try this for a change of pace and to use some canned tuna that was a little more strongly flavored than we like for sandwiches.  As I was making it, I started having strong doubts that this could POSSIBLY be any good, and was already formulating possible scathing reviews in my mind! :P  Imagine my surprise when I took the first forkful and it was actually GOOD!  I used diluted tomato paste instead of ketchup, since I was out of ketchup, and it was fine; I also put it over some white rice.  It was very easy to make.  My only complaint is that the recipe vastly overestimates the amount of food that results...there's no way it makes enough for 6!  I would double whatever the recipe calls for in order to feed the number you're shooting for, unless you're planning to serve it with several sides.

It tasted pretty much like tuna & ketchup. Not worth the ingredients in my opinion.

This was a really really easy and quick recipe. It's also pretty good, much better than I was expecting at first, actually. I did add some diced tomatoes as well, and served with white rice and a side salad. A reasonably healthy dinner done really quickly.

I really enjoyed this dish. A simple and delicious entree. It also works very well with small macaroni pasta.

Great recipe for what I call a "supper saver", when you don't have many fresh ingredients in the house :)

I though it should be called Sweet and Sour Tuna, I found the title misleading. I added some vegetable stock and water/cornstarch mixture to give it some sauce.

This came out great for a last minute dinner!  I did not have dried rosemary.  I added a few splashes of red wine vinegar to the ketchup.  Served over brown rice!

The trick to this is making sure the ketchup browns well. Keep stirring it so it does not burn. I love it with white rice and a glass of white wine!!!

I wanted to add that this works well with tofu as well.  I just substitued the tofu for the tuna and added some water to the gravy and let it simmer for awhile.

Woke up craving this. I didnâ€™t have any rosemary but it turned out great. I love sweet pepper/bell peppers so I cut mine a little on the thicker side. I will try it again with some thyme.

Very good way to enhance the flavor of tuna packed in water. I used a can of diced tomato instead of ketchup, an orange pepper instead of green and oregano instead of rosemary, all just for my own personal flavor choices. I also added a couple of Tbsp. of balsamic vinegar to give it a little sweet and sour taste. My wife thought it had a Caribbean flavor. Served over brown rice for a Saturday lunch and nice way to eat healthy at a low cost.

My son said, "This tastes like sloppy joes!"  It could be called sloppy joe tuna fish, and we like it!
