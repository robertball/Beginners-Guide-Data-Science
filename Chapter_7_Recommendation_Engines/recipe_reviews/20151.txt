I gave it a try ...It is surprisingly tasty!  Reminds me a little of an ice cream float.  I like to add a little more soda to the mix.

This is a non-flavored version of an old fashioned drink called an egg cream.  It is wonderful for soothing an upset stomach too.

Remember Laverne and Shirley? Laverne loved mixing her milk with Pepsi! Same difference, different soda. She loved this drink from her childhood and incorporated it as part of Laverne's character likes! Of course, we HAD to try it when we were kids since Laverne liked it! We thought it was tasty and cool, but didn't take to drinking it more often than to show someone else. :) I drink Sprite, sooo I might just give it a go!

Pretty good. Not something I am dying to have all the time, but it definitely makes the milk tastes better and makes it more tolerable to drink. Try it!

Ok, this sounded pretty weird to me, so I had to try it!! I have to say... it's not really that sweet, but still surprisingly good. I added a little more soda than milk so it was more fizzy than creamy. Really does taste kind of like a float, only not as overpowering. Very interesting recipe:)
