I made two different meatloaf's in the smoker yesterday with this being one of them. This was good but it was the sauce that made this one the better out of the two. The meatloaf itself was good but could have used something to balance out the acidity of the can tomatoes. All in all great recipe though and one I will make again. Thanks for sharing!
