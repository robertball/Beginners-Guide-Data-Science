Loved it!  It takes about 1 3/4 hours to prepare and bake, including boiling & mashing the potatoes.  I added 3 yellow onions, chopped and fried in 2 Tbsp butter.  Surprisingly, I found it needed a little salt.  I hadn't added any while boiling the potatoes or noodles as I thought the cream cheese, cheddar and bacon bits would make it salty enough.

Served it with sour cream, yum!

I made this the other night for my boyfriend and his family, it went over very well. The thing I noticed is that it needs a little more flavor. I added a few cloves of garlic. I also thought that it would be better if you added milk/butter & salt.pepper to the mashed potatoes. I want to make this again, but I'm going to change up the recipe a little bit.

I made this recipe last night.  I used instant mashed potatoes because I was feeling lazy.  I couldn't find Herb and Garlic cream cheese so I just used garlic cream cheese.  I also used french fried onions instead of green onions.  My husband thought this recipe was very good.  Two children also enjoyed it.  I thought it was pretty salty but otherwise very good.  Next time I make it, assuming I use instant potatoes again, I will omit the salt called for on the box.  The potato mixture does not spread easily across the noodles but perhaps using thinner potatoes would solve that problem.

Cheap, and easy to make! Made my picky eater husband a happy man :)  We used fresh-cooked bacon, which gave it a good touch.

This recipe is easy and delicious.  I always fry a few onions and add to each layer as well as topping with fried onion before serving.  I also mix in a generous shake of white pepper to the potatoes, otherwise this is a bit bland.  Great comfort food recipe.

This was amazing. While I was boiling the potatoes I sautéed a small diced onion & a large minced garlic clove in 2 tbsp butter (next time I will use a larger onion). Then I added the cream cheese (used about 6 oz chive & onion flavored) & once that melted, some milk. I used this & some of the potato water to mash the potatoes - which you want kind of on the loose side so they are easier to spread. I omitted the green onion since I used a yellow one instead. So creamy & cheesy - loved it!

This recipe was good, but not great. It did taste just like pierogis. This took a long time to put together - a good hour for me and I used instant mashed potatoes and fresh cooked bacon. I definitely agree with other reviewers that the dish needs salt added; the bacon and cream cheese just don't add enough. My husband loved it, my daughter hated it, I thought it was just ok. Probably wouldn't make again.

This was really great, it tasted exactly like a pierogi! I added some garlic, salt & pepper and just a bit of milk & butter to the potatoes since some reviewers said it needed more flavor. My family really enjoyed it and my bf said it's a keeper!

Fabulous!!  I used instant potatoes and onion and chive cream cheese and the taste was fantastic!  I served this at a birthday party along with some trays of food from a local restaurant and the pierogi casserole was gone before anything else!  I will definitely make this again. Do yourself a favor and try this dish.

Big hit! Had to use onion and chive cream cheese and I cooked and chopped up real bacon. I also used instant loaded mashed potatoes. Very good! My oldest son asked me to please make it again.

This is very good. I used chive and onion cream cheese because it was all I could find, and made my own bacon but otherwise followed the recipe as written. I didn't believe the other reviewers and didn't add salt, figuring they must just prefer salty food (we are a pretty low salt family) but I will add it to the mashed potatoes next time I make this. Sour cream helped. I will also follow another reviews advice and add onion and garlic to the mixture but leave the bacon just for the top. It looses some of its texture and taste inside the the potato but stays crispy and delicious on top. Lastly, I made this in the am and refrigerated until dinner time, from cold it needs at least an extra 10 mins in the oven.

Maybe 3.5 stars. It was good, just hard to eat a lot of because of the texture, and as a main dish that means you also have to cook something else. The noodles do not cook at all in the oven, so they have to be well done before they are layered.

BEST recipe I have ever made. While very labour intense, I don't care. It took me 1.5 hours to just prepare, but the results were SPECTACULAR. Perfect perfect perfect. While not in my recipe mix all the time, when I am ambitious and hungry would definitely make again. Family and co-workers could not gobble it up fast enough. Arlene, Mississauga, Canada

Loved it! I used one regular already made mashed potatoes from the meat dept and one garlic mashed and made my own bacon bits w/ sour cream & chive cream cheese. We both it was delicious and didn't need any additional salt. Will def keep this upfront in recipes to do again.

My family (including a picky four and two year old) loved this.  I had made pierogi earlier in the week and ended up having left over filling that I wasn't sure what to do with when I came across this recipe.  I used that instead of the mashed potato filling, halved the rest of the ingredients and baked it in a bread pan.  Any recipe I make that causes everyone to eat with no arguments I'll consider a smashing success :)

Love this recipe. I grew up with my mom making a similar recipe to this with instant potatoes but I love it so much better with this potato mixture. I made an adjustment and made my first layer with cottage cheese and then did my second layer with the potato mixture.
