These are terrific! My daughters loved them and called them "banana fries".
I have never used plantains before. They are difficult to peel but I figured out a good way. Cut the end off and slice down the length of the plantain. Then peel the cut edges apart.
For this recipe it says gather about two tablespoons together...Squish them together into a little ball. They will stick together and still make the 'legs' of the aranita.
Fast and easy!

Perfect side dish or appetizer!! The name 'ara√±itas' means little spiders and refers to the shape they take when fried. Make sure the plantains are very green or it will have a different texture and flavor. It is not supposed to be sweet. I always use the special grater I have to make homemade hash browns. What you want is similar to the way carrots are shredded for a salad. They were spectacular!!

Being Puerto Rican I was raised eating these. They are my kids' favorite. My "gringo" friends can't get enough of them!!!!! Gracias, amiga, for reminding me to make them the next time the kids come over.

I am a gringo living in the Dominican Republic- guest at my bed and breakfast LOVE this snack that we always serve on arrival- a real crowd pleaser that cost only a few pesos (or pennies) to make!
