This was a great recipe.  I actually did have beer and added 2 liters (6 cans) of beer in place of the ginger ale.  I followed everything else exactly.  Upper Michiganders who know their bratwurst said they were the best brats they had ever tasted.   GO PACK!!

Didn't much care for this one. The sauerkraut took on the taste of the ginger ale, which wasn't good, and the brats didn't taste all that different than usual. If you try this recipe, I suggest you not put the sauerkraut in the pot with everything else. Think I'll stick to grilling my brats, or braising them in beer.

I thought this was pretty tasty. I cut the gingerale in half and added water for the rest since someone said it tasted too much like the gingerale. I put them under the broiler for 5 mins to get the casing crispy!

This didn't work me me.  Better to use beer or perhaps broth with the kraut brine.

We left out the sauerkraut and used 4C ginger ale and 4C water.  After boiling, we grilled the sausage and ate with the onions and garlic, which we carmelized in a frying pan.  Yum yum yum.  Had seconds.

I made these for Father's Day since I had gone out that morning to get beer and brats for dinner, forgetting that it was a Sunday which means no beer for sale :/ Came across this recipe and decided why not? I only used about 1 liter of ginger ale and then water. They had a slightly sweet taste to them from the ginger ale which I didn't mind but my son refused to eat them. I left out the sauerkraut since hubby hates it and so I used sauteed onions and peppers. After the brats were done cooking I seared them off in a pan real quick to get the yummy crispness to them. I don't think I would do it again if I was in the same situation but it was worth a try. Thanks for the recipe.

I have always made my brats with beer, onions and kraut.  I don't know about the ginger ale part but I just discovered the only way I will make brats with beer.  Substitute beer for ale and the addition of garlic made brats that my family is still fighting over.  I give it 5 stars for the addition of fresh garlic.

Actually the only thing I took from this recipe was adding garlic to my onion while grilling them.. I just broiled the Brats and topped w/ the onion/garlic mix.. Delicious!! I've grilled onions ALL MY LIFE and now its forever changed :)

I used peach habanero brats and ginger beer. Skipped the sour kraut and sauted red and green bell pepper with sweet onions in coconut oil. After boiling I put them on a hot grill for a minute to give them that look... Simply delicious!!!!

I used 3 cups ginger ale, 3 cups water, 1 can sauerkraut with juice, 1 sliced onion , 6 squeezes chopped garlic and  what made the difference was 1/2 cup balsamic Vinagar. Donâ€™t boil brats prior to browning. Just soak in marinade after simmering

Pretty good.  I didn't have any beer in the house (that's a first) but did have the ginger ale.  Added caraway seeds to go with the kraut.

I have made this several times, it is really good. My husband has to be gluten free but I don't like all the chemicals in soft drinks, including ginger ale, so I use Reed's Ginger Brew. Yum! Everyone that has had this likes it. (Would use beer but haven't been able to get GF beer  in my small town). 
My bratwurst is made by a local meat company so it's fresh.
Making it again tonight. Oh, and we lightly grill the bratwurst before serving.

The recipe is just O.K. I think carmelized onions add much more flavor.  There are no green peppers in the recipe, and the recipe doesn't call for sliced onions.  The picture is very deceiving.
