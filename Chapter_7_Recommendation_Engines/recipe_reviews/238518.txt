I highly recommend breaking down your own crab for the stew. It's easier than you think and you can save all the yummy juices and "butter" for the broth. Add the crab when you add the other shell fish.  

I make a few variations to the recipe - I add 3-4 minced anchovy fillets when I add in the garlic. I also add the tomato paste and cook for a couple of minutes, until nice and caramelized. I then add in the crab juices and "butter" along with a bottle of clam juice to deglaze the pan. 

On separate occasions I've used dry red & white wine as well as beer. They've all been great so I recommend using whatever your drinking to pair with the recipe. 

Also, you only need one large pot for the recipe. You can sauté everything right in the pot, no need for a separate sauté pan.

A July 4th hit!  Will make it again soon. All that enjoyed said not to change a thing in the recipe.  Served it over linguine. I did use about 30 Littleneck clams and omitted the mussels. Have leftover sauce full of fish flavors and will freeze it to use another time for a quick meal over pasta.

Loved this recipe.  Made it just as directed, except that I omitted the mussels and added some crab meat.  It was wonderful!

this is beyond a doubt the best recipe i've come across. the additional spices gave it a kick. i tweaked it by adding a 1/4 tsp more of crushed red peppers flakes, homemade shellfish stock with fresh oregano

Easy to make. Added frozen seafood melody that had calamari, other shrimp and bits of seafood to add more seafood. Also had salmon instead of cod which is what we had in the fridge. You really could any seafood combinations you want and it should be fine. I think I added a little too much red pepper flakes so i'll be more careful with the pepper next time. It was good for the first time cooking it.

This soup/stew turned out wonderful! I did use bay scallops and crab meat instead of clams and mussels because I don’t like those. But I didn’t change anything else and I wouldn’t again, except I will get shrimp that don’t have tails on them. I don’t know what I was thinking when I bought the shrimp!

the best cioppino I've ever made. I made this for 2, so I cut the recipe in half and used clam juice instead of chicken stock, but I did use a little chicken stock just to give it a little silkiness...maybe 3tbspns or so, and sautéed the tomato paste before adding the tomatoes and wet ingredients. I also split a lobster tail in half and added some bay scallops. This is insanely good.

DELICIOUS!  I used 2 bottles of clam juice instead of the chicken broth and added in a few anchovy fillets with the onion and garlic, then proceeded with the recipe with no additional tweaks.
