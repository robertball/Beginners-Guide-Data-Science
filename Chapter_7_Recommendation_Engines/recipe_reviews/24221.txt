I make this all the time. I love it. Try this with a bit of pineapple juice. If you are adventurous, add a bit of crushed pineapple. I do this when making pitchers for parties.   If you keep your alcohol in the freezer (it generally won't freeze, depending on the purity), ice is not required, and keeps the drink from becoming watery.  For an interesting variation: Omit the pineapple juice, and try a bit of banana liquer. Interesting taste.

Oh my! These are soooo good! My neighbor just loves these and they're a great way to beat the heat! I filled a glass with crushed ice and poured everything in plus a couple splashes of pineapple juice. To top it off I garnished it with some orange slices and maraschino cherries!

Fruity and refreshing, not too sweet.  perfect balance of alcohol to mixer.  I think pineapple juice and cran-raspberry work best!

I use pineapple juice instead of orange juice and use cran-raspberry juice.  Makes a great punch.  Make a gallon at a time and freeze one gallon to use as "ice"

This is the Original that Recipe that I grew up on...For all my friends BBQ's I serve it in a watermelon with the watermelonballs, cantaloupe and honeydew melon balls...Sometimes I add some coconut rum eyeball maybe 1 cup or so and a just a splash or so of Grenadine also for a little more sweetness...I usually make a lot and keep it in a milk gallon container and keep refilling it... Soak some not all of the fruit in some the night before, that is usually when I cut and sccope out the watermelon...You can make it as easy/pretty as you wish depending on where you are going...I do use this as punch with the fruit in the punch bowl as well....Have Fun!!!! Thanks Great Original Recipe

This is my favourite mixed drink! I'd never made my own before and am glad I chose this recipe, it's great! The colour is a lot more pink than what I'm used to getting in a bar but the taste was pretty bang on. Maybe it had something to do with me greatly increasing the recipe yield and combining it all in a pitcher. Doesn't matter, it was great!

Its a great drink, Tia Maria or Kaluha. I use Tia Maria, Tortuga Ponche (Grand Caymens) for the cream, (still great with Cruzon rum cream) and add 1/2 shot of 1 Barrel rum from Belize. Actually "Bounty" rum from St Lucia is a special ingredient on the island. Splash of Capt Morgan works great too if you forget it get it on your last cruise. And Albertsons Strawberry Syrup to make it truly gourmet . You need to make this at least once. Highly recommend.

Delicious! I used Smirnoff Whipped Vodka for a little twist and I added a little Diet 7-UP to the top of the glass for a little fizz but other than that I stuck to the recipe. So very good.

OMG this was so good!  I scaled the recipe and made it for a party we were having last night.  I made a big pitcher of it and then for each glass, I poured it into a martini shaker over ice so the drink was nice and cold when serving.  Just delicious, wouldn't change a thing.

This is also good with lemon vodka.  As others have said, a nice balance of spirits and fruitiness.

Great recipe for a classic Sex on the Beach cocktail! I like mine a little higher octane so I do 2oz vodka, still 1oz peach and only 2oz each of the juices :)

Caution, if using cranberry juice (not a cocktail) cut cranberry in half.... Else, fantastic, easy recipe that scales easily

My wife and I both liked it.  I stayed true to the recipe for the first batch. However, on the second batch I went one part everything. The second batch definitely had more bite but still went down easy. My wife hates the taste of alcohol and she still enjoyed the second batch. It is great either way. Not a drink I would order at the restaurant but if you need to make something at home for you and the wife this is the recipe.

Really good drink. I love sex and the beach cocktail. And the recipe is very easy to make and enjoy.
