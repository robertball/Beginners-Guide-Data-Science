this recipe was great.  the salmon was tender and juicy and had a great flavor.  i reserved some of the o.j. mixture and added a touch of soy sauce and toasted sesame seeds to serve on the side with the salmon.

i thought this was awesome. and so easy! i had to use red wine vinegar instead of balsamic (which i toned down w/ a touch of maple syrup) and grated dried ginger instead of fresh. i also added one small clove of minced garlic to (forgive me) kick it up a notch. i served it on a bed of cashew/ginger fried rice and drizzled the rest of the orange sauce on top with some toasted sesame seeds. fantabulous!

This was the best salmon recipe I've made so far.  I used a little cornstarch to thicken the OJ quicker.  I followed a prior review and added soy sauce & sesame seeds to the remaining sauce.  I'll definitely make again!

Adding a teaspoon or two of honey helps this glaze to "stick" better to the salmon and lock in the moisture.  Otherwise this is a great base with a very original taste.

I have a very limited time to cook dinner and this was incredibly fast and easy. While the OJ was cooling, I made rice as side dish. Good recipe if you are not an expert cooking fish. Even if you overcook the salmon (like I did) the glaze is sauce-like and compensates for overcooking.  Has a strong citrus taste so I recommend adding more ginger to counteract the sweetness. Will make again without a doubt!

Delicious! I only made 2 pieces of salmon, but used half the recipe, so I had plenty of sauce for each piece. As per other reviews, I added an overflowing T of honey and also a little toasted sesame oil. I also put all the sauce on at once and kept in the oven for 30 minutes. My husband said that it tasted like it came from a restaurant! Will definitely be making this again!

Great recipe.  I seared the salmon first on both sides with a little sesame oil and halved the cooking time.  Turned it out wonderfully.

Great!  I used ½ cup OJ, ½ cup red wine vinegar. 2 tsp ginger, 3 tbs brown sugar, 1 tbs of lemon juice, dash of salt, dash of parsley for color, dash of cognac for flavor. Warm enough to mix the brown sugar.  Marinate salmon about 20mins, bake in sauce at 400 for 30 mins. The lemon juice gives a nice zing to complement the sweetness of the rest of the juice.

This stuff is great!  I was looking for new and exciting ways to fix Salmon, this one was definitely a keeper.  The mix of flavors is fantastic, and it smells great cooking.

Great recipe!  Very easy, and I appreciated not having to buy very many ingredients--I had everything but the ginger root on hand.  I took the suggestion of others and added a bit of soy sauce to the leftover OJ sauce and kept this for pouring over the salmon at the end.  I served it over brown basmati rice with stir-fried baby bok choy.  A nice healthy, easy meal that I will definitely make again!

Very nice flavor, but the cooking time would have been too long in my opinion.  We baked in parchment for 20 min.  Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty recipe. I used white balsamic vinegar since none was specified. This has a mild flavor which makes it easy to pair with many sides. I served it with rice and roasted asparagus.

Entire family loved it! Did double the sauce to use on chicken later this week as another reviewer recommended. Also from other reviews I did add 1TSpn Honey and 1TSpn of Soysauce. Also did not have basalmic vinegar on hand so substituted Rice Wine Vinegar. Husband was thrilled and kids ate it down without a fight! :)

This was great!  My husband and I loved it!  I followed the recipe however, I didn't have any parchment paper so I used foil.  I also added some garlic and 1 tablespoon of a orange glaze sauce I had in the fridge for more flavor! Yummy :-)

Best salmon recipe I've found.  I microwave mine on medium power for 8 minutes.  Add minced cilantro/garlic to sauce, if desired.  Delicious!

this recipe was delicious, all my guests had compliments. As in other reviews, I added some soya to the sauce. I had some sauce left, which I also served next to the salmon. We ended up using it as well on top of the boiled potatoes, which also tasted delicious with this sauce.

I loved this - did make some changes.... I upped the grated fresh ginger to 1 tablespoon.. I added a good tablespoon of orange liquor... I used rice vinegar... and added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar. I let the sauce reduce for about 20 minutes, then had to add cornstarch to thicken it up even more. I used extra puply orange juice for this - as I feel the pulp would release more citrus as it's heated. The flavors accented the salmon very well.

I really didn't care for this recipe. I was hoping the flavors would work but the salmon tasted WAY too fishy. I give 3 stars because I think it might be a great sauce for chicken. It could also use a few more spices for complexity. I always start with garlic but I would like to see some other suggestions.

Best recipe I've tried in a while.  Followed other reviewer's suggestions and added 1 tsp honey and 1tbsp soy sauce.  Also thickened the sauce with some cornstarch at the end.  Served with jasmine rice and steamed broccoli.  Easy and tastes fantastic - will definitely make again!

Very easy, quick and tasty. Made it exactly per the recipe. Baked 15 minutes then basted, then 10 minutes more. I thought it was perfect. Other family members thought it was a little dry. Maybe a little less time baking?

Delicious. My kids didn't like it, but my husband and I did. Very yummy. I used a little soy sauce and toasted sesame seeds in the leftover sauce, like the others suggested. I didn't care for the salmon skin or bones, so next time I'll use salmon filets instead. Thank you!

This is an excellent recipe and a perfect example of great food that is simple to make. I struggle with liking salmon--I know it's good for me so I try it many different ways but it's a bit strong in flavor. But this dish made it truly delicious. I served it along with a salad with a Japanese ginger dressing and it was a perfect meal.

Not sure about all the glowing reviews.  This was the most bland, lackluster marinade ever.  Would not make again.

This receipe was good but I wouldn't say great. I would use it again as my main salmon receipe but I am still looking for a better one. On a positive note, I enjoyed the orange/honey flavor and it was very easy to make.

My husband brought home fresh salmon from his day of fishing and I baked some up using this recipe. I added honey and soy as others have suggested. The salmon made this way was so delicious! I will definately be using this recipe again. We both loved it!

This is our favorite salmon recipe.  The fresh ginger blends nicely with the vinegar and orange juice.  The sauce is thin, but delicious.  Awesome!

I thought this would be a little more flavorful.  I could hardly taste the OJ at all.  It was really easy though, and healthy too.  I added two garlic cloves.  I made Cashew Raisin Rice Pilaf from this site (w/dried cranberries and brown rice) and steamed broccoli to go with it.  It was a nice meal.  This isn't a bad recipe, but I wouldn't make it again.

I liked how this turned out.  I did cook the glaze a bit longer to get it to thicken a bit.  The orange juice gave it a different flavor.  Thanks for the post.

The recipe was very easy but was a little sweet  I may try it again and substitute vodka for rum. I made 4 8oz fillets and shortened the cooking time to 20 minutes for medium

The sauce never thickened up and burned in the baking dish so did not flavor the salmon as well as should have.  The next time I will marinate in the sauce first and then bake.

The orange juice did not thicken up while it reduced, so the sauce was watery, and the fish did not have much flavor. This was a disappointment.

Such a great simple recipe! I was amazed by how easy it is to bake juicy salmon in the oven without the use of extra fat.

Recenltly I gave it a twist using what was at hand: clementines instead of oranges, cut up capers and green olives thrown in clementine marinade or on top of salmon. I decided not to use balsemic vinegar, because there was some rice and green beans and rice to fry up.. only needed some soy sauce after being fried in the pan used for cooking the clementine juice.

Wonderful simple, simple, simple 5 star salmon recipe. My wife & I eat twice a week so it can get pretty boring, but this recipe surprised us. Great citrus, tangy flavor!

The flavor was present, but very mild for me.  I thought I could get the sauce to thicken up, but I failed.  Won't be making again.

Sauce was rather strong and sharp, but generally the recipe was good.
