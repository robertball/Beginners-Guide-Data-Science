I do NOT recommend that you make this for a party or gathering of some kind.  When you are done preparing it, you have to taste it to ensure it is worthy of putting your name on (like any good chef would).  One taste bite leads to a second, third,,,,,,, next thing you know, you have polished off more than half of it.  
I stuck to the recipe and it is fantastic.  My wife HATES peas.  I mean won't eat them if they are the only thing left between her and starvation.  So I gave her a blind taste test and even she LOVED it.

This was very good and was well received at our Easter dinner.  It is one of those salads that gets better the longer it sits.  Leftovers the next day were just as good or even better than on day 1! Thanks for he tasty, easy recipe, tstancell!  (Note:  I used lite mayo and red wine vinegar.  I also used the regular, cheaper raisins in lieu of golden raisins)

Made this almost completely to the recipe. I donâ€™t like raisins, so therefore I had none. But even without them this recipe is so good and will become a standard one in our home.

Yum, this was pretty good!  I didn't get to make it exactly like the recipe since I didn't have raisins.  But it was still great without them.  I think dried cranberries would go well in it also.  I did add in a touch more sugar.  Very good and I can't wait to make it again sometime.  Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone loved this.  First time I made it.  Used the "real" bacon bits in a bag and did add the raisins.  It is a keeper.

I was concerned about the raisins and sunflower seeds, but they raisins add just a hint of sweetness and the sunflower seeds a bit of crunch with the onion. I did add a bunch more peas than the original recipe called for, and that really made it wonderful.

Yummy yummy is so right! I made this recipe exactly as written except I had a bag of 20oz frozen peas and after reading others' reviews I just used the whole bag! All of the different flavors blend perfectly! I will be making this again!l next time though I will scale the recipe down for 2 (wayyy too much left) lol. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I've made this several times, and every time it has been a hit with family and guests. I have varied it a couple of times by adding very small chopped fresh broccoli florets and let it sit for a few hours. I've also left the sunflower seeds out occasionally. No matter the omission or addition it's always been very good.

Tremendously simply to make, but delicious to eat. The 2nd time I made it I replaced the sunflower seeds with French's Fried Onion pieces instead. It added a bit more complexity to the taste and I will continue to use my changed version. I fed it to people who stated that they 'didn't like peas' and they all ended up asking for more.

I have made this salad as written and it's great.  I've also made a lightened version in the name of  weight loss by using a packet of Sweet and Low instead of sugar, and halving all ingredients except the peas and onion and its still yummy.

I made the recipe as written except I used regular raisins as that's what I had on hand and omitted the bacon but sprinkled bacon bits on top.  I think it would be better if the sunflower seeds and cheese were at least doubled.  Slivered or sliced almonds could be used instead of the sunflower seeds--would add a little more crunch plus visual interest.  Chow mein noodles could also be sprinkled across the top for extra crunch.
