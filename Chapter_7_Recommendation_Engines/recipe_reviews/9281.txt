My parents have a hallmark fruitcake made in Texas, the memory of which I was working against in making this recipe at my father's request.  Given that there are only three of us sharing Christmas, I halved the recipe and took some liberties because of what we had in the kitchen, as well as trying to match the Empress Fruitcake of Yore.  I added dried apricots and some withered blueberries, because of what we had on hand, and omitted the sultanas and currents, going heavier on dates.  I also substituted pecans for almonds.  My father also wanted the taste of burbon so I soaked the raisins in burbon for a few days, drained them well and used the burbon-raisin juice instead of coffee and grape juice.

I suggest that you read the recipe carefully for the myriad of steps -- beaten egg whites, beaten egg yolks and the flour mixtures all in separate bowls that converge quite quickly.  It makes for a BIG project and heavy clean up.

The recipe also calls for three differently sized "Christmas cake" pans, the like of which I've never seen and do not see the reason for -- it's not a stacked cake, after all.  I used loaf pans and baked the minimum 2 1/2 hours.  I used two layers of greased brown paper but only on the bottom of the pans; after running a sharp knife around the greased edges, the cakes dropped out easily.

The next time I make this (and I think I will -- it did, essentially, match that acme of fruitcakes from my childhood) -- I won't chop the fruit and nuts as small as I

This fruitcake is delicious but costs a fortune to make - definitely a once a year item!

I soaked dried cranberries in rum (instead of currants) and used half white sugar and half brown sugar - other than that followed recipe.

I made a couple of cupcake size ones to taste and the big one is wrapped and in the freezer for the holidays.

The cupcakes tasted superb.......

Having lost my mother's recipe years ago, I was thrilled to find this one so close in content.  With a few changes, I'm back in business.  Thank you so much

Had a hankering to taste the flavor I remembered from my childhood in the late '50s from an Irish aunt who made fruitcakes and you hit it right on the button.
Thanks   ;)

I made this cake for Christmas... I used Dark Rum instead of fruit juice and made the coffee really strong (used instant coffee). I used maraschino cherries, dried apricots and added walnuts and pecans. It is absolutely delicious.  Everyone is enjoying it already. I also used Blackstrap Molasses and a cup of brown sugar instead of 2 cups of white sugar.  Excellent... Highly Recommend to Everyone!!!!

This is just like my Mom's,  sometimes she would change the fruit.  Mom would say just add the dried fruit you like.  It was always delicious.  My family likes to serve it with cheese.
