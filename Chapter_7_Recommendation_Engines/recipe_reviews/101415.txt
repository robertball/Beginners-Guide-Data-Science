This was really great.  I'm not a fan of pork loins because I always seem to dry them out and there is never much flavor but I gave it another whirl and WOW it was great.  If you aren't a big fan on "hot" spices, cut back on the cayenne pepper.  This recipe makes plenty of rub for additional meats so only use about half the amount for your roast.  I had a 2 1/2 lb. top pork loin roast.  I stuck the roast and the rub in a large ziplock bag...shook it up and let it sit in the fridge overnight.  I then put it in the crockpot in the morning (don't add any liquid) on low and let it cook while I was at work for 8 hours and it was perfect.  It fell apart and was very moist & juicy...and the house smelled great!

Soooo easy...any just dribbled olive oil on the roast, put apple juice in the bottom so it was setting in liquid and would not dry out...Served 23 people and they all wanted the recipe for the rub...

I made this for me and my finace and we both agreed that it was the best pork loin we'd ever eaten! I used all the ingredients except for the ginger (which I was out of and so was our grocery store). I also cooked it out on the grill instead of in the oven. I covered half the grill with aluminum foil and put the charcoal on the other half. (the indirect heat method) I put the loin on the aluminum foil and two cans of opened beer over the coals to create moisture. I cooked it for a little over an hour turning it about every 15 minutes. Also, if you turn up the sides of the aluminum foil the juices stay around the loin which helped keep it juicy and tender. We were able to cut it with a fork! I also spread some fresh garlic over the top of the loin and closed the aluminum foil around it for the last 15 minutes of cooking. I am definately going to cook this recipe again!

I used this rub with a 6lb roast and tripled the recipe.  I didn't have all the ingredients (dry mustard, cumin, paprika, & thyme) and eliminated the sugar and cayenne pepper... but it was still wonderful!  I also poured a little olive oil on top.  Next time I think I'll baste the roast as it's cooking to help distribute the tasty juices on top too (the bottom was saturated with the wonderful flavors while the top was good - but not quite as tasty).   I cooked it to internal temperature of 170 degrees and the roast was tender and juicy!  I definitely recommend this recipe!  I'm sure it's wonderful with the ingredients I left out too :o)

The flavor of the rub was very good.  My family enjoyed the taste.  I added potatoes, carrots, bell pepper and onion to the pan half-way through the cooking time and the vegetables were delicious also.

This was the best homemade rub we have ever had.  One hint though:  We made gravy from the drippings...big mistake...WOW what a kick to it!  Other than that, I can't wait to try it on chicken breast before it hits the BBQ.

YUM!!! wow, i was so impressed with this recipe. So many great flavours.I rubbed the marinade over a 2.5lb pork rib roast (looked similar to a rack of lamb) then i cooked it for approx 1hr and 15mins uncovered(until it reached 150 degrees in a 325 degree oven. I then took it out and tented some foil over it until it reached 160 degrees. (approx 10 mins) then i sliced it in between the rib bones and it looked just like a large lamb chop. It was AMAZING!!!5 Stars. My husband who doesn't care for pork or leftovers, ate it 3 days in a row and cleaned the plate! Very impressed with this recipe and since i only used 1/2 cup of the rub, i have enough left over to do 2 more roasts in the near future. Thankyou so much for sharing this one.

I'd give this rub 6 stars if possible!  It was absolutely with a doubt the best pork roast ever!  All 5 of my guest thoroughly enjoyed it's flavor. I rubbed a 6lb pork shoulder and slow cooked it for 5 hours in my cast iron dutch oven. The pork was fork tender and the flavor was unbelievable!

This is a great dry rub. I made this a few months ago and used it on a pork sirloin roast that I bought from Costco. The roast came out so tender and flavorful. This recipe is a keeper for sure. I stored the rest of the rub in an empty spice jar and have since used the rub on all kinds of various cuts of pork and chicken!

Delish!! My husband told me that this was perhaps the best dinner that I have ever made!  (and I do make good dinners, so this is outstanding!!)  I missed the part where it said only use 1/2 cup on the roast...(till after I had put about 1 cup all over it) and was nervous that I screwed it up, but it was fantastic!  No more dried out pork roasts it this house!!!! I can't wait to try it on chicken...and am thrilled that the batch makes up so much so I have it on hand when needed!  I am also thinking about "gifting" this for people (as someone else noted earlier).  Do yourself (and family) a favor...try this!!!!!! You will not be sorry!!!

I will never be afraid of flavorless, dry pork again. My family is crazy for this delicious recipe! I would give it 5 stars, but in I left out a few ingredients, so to be fair, I'm going with 4 stars. I was out of onion salt, so I increased the garlic salt a little. I also left out the cumin. And I was afraid of too much heat, so I didn't use the cayenne. The roast always turns out so savory! Sometimes I glaze the pork with a sauce of 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1 Tbsp cornstarch, 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, 1/2 cup water, and 2 Tbsp soy sauce, boiled till thickened and brushed on the roast several times during the last 30 minutes of cooking. What a moist, juicy, flavorful, and simple meal.

Made this for 170 people.  They raved!  Made minor adjustments for maximum flavor - can tweak to how you want it.  Added more cumin, mustard, thyme and garlic and also added fresh minced garlic (a must).  Used less heat ingredients to allow children to enjoy. It's essential to get that crust on the meat by searing your meat if you are not grilling.  Made some without that (accidently), and it just wasn't as good.  Absolutely fantastic!  Thanks for a new go to recipe!

this rub was excellent.  I actually cooked the pork on the grill which I felt brought out the flavors of the rub.

This is definitely a keeper, but I would hesitate to say it's the "world's best" !! ;)  It certainly lends a zesty flavor to the meat... but what we liked best was adding chopped vegetables to the roasting pan and the taste sensation that provides! Wow! Be forewarned.. all the sugar in the rub carmelizes and hardens on the bottom of the pan, making for a cleaning mess!

Wonderful recipe.   I just reduced the red pepper some for our taste otherwise did everything the same.  After reading the reviews, I put potatoes, carrots, onion, gr pepper, and mushrooms in a separate pan, poured apple juice over it, cooked it in the microwave awhile and then baked it with the roast in the oven.  AWESOME taste!!!

This rub is OK, but far from the World's Best. The rub from Chris Lilley in another Pork Board recipe, Rubbed and Grilled Pork Loin, is vastly superior. This one somehow manages to be a little too sweet and a little too spicy at the same time.

Used 1/2 the cumin and ginger called for as well as the cayenne (my hubby can't eat hot), otherwise this rub is YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY.

Since I always read a recipe through before I try it, I knew I didn't want the sugar. I might have added 1/2 of the amount if I were grilling but for roasting, no. I wasn't wanting pork candy. Other than that change I made my roast according to the directions and was quite happy with the outcome. :o)

First time in a while I have WOW-ed my family.  This was fantastic, and they said they would choose this over steak.  They are spoiled to begin with, with many recipes from All Recipes, but this one really deserves its 5 stars.  Thanks for a great recipe that I will use over and over. I followed the directions with no variation.

So tasty, and at first I was kind of iffy on how it would taste. Pork tenderloin was on sale and instead of having my husband do it the usual way (with a jack daniels marinade)I found this recipe.  I had 2 3/4# of boneless tenderloin. I used 1 c of brown sugar...totally left out the white sugar...scared it'd be too sweet. didn't have onion powder so i chopped up some onions and put them on top of the pork while it roasted. I also was out of thyme and added a bit of corriander. I rubbed this on, let it sit for 1/2 hour and then baked at 325 for about 45 minutes in a roasting rack. Shut off the oven and let it sit for about 15 minutes before i took it out of the oven and sliced it. VERY moist....and it most certainly had some 'kick' to it. My 15 year old liked it, but I knew the 4 year old wouldn't even try it..so I didn't bother. My husband loved it and demanded I make it again. lol. Which I will. It was a nice combo of sweet and hot...which I'm not used to...Thank you for sharing this recipe. :)

I started by using this exact recipe, omitting the ginger because I was all out.  I sampled it on a small piece of pork loin and baked it, before rubbing on the whole thing.  It was very spicy!  Could have been the age of my crushed peppers that did that.  So, to tone it down I added more of the other ingredients that did not have any heat.  It turned out to have a sweet, yet savory taste.  Served it for hubby's birthday, the whole family loved it. I will definitely use the recipe as a base again, and play around with it to find our perfect rub.
Since this recipe has so many 5 star reviews, I'm really thinking it was the age of some of my spices that made it not quite perfect.  Time to head to Shipshewana to freshen up the spice cabinet!

*Tips for Beginners:  First, get yourself a variety of seasonings to play around with.  Secondly, research how often you should refresh them.  Third, test out new recipes on family before serving to guests or taking to a party.  Once you perfect a dish, you will enjoy having others ask you for your recipe!

I use the Smithfield whole pork loins a lot due to their cheap price. I was looking for a new pork loin recipe and decided on this one. I was nervous about the sweet and savory aspect but it was a near perfect balance! I was also nervous about the amount of heat in the spices and was correct about that. The star of this rub is the ginger, cumin, cayenne and sugar combo! I made the rub exactly as stated the only difference is that I grilled the roast as I normally do with another rub I have used for years. I was worried my family would think it too hot or too sweet for a savory meal. They LOVED it!! And so did I! And I have young children (youngest 6.) They admitted it was very spicy but they asked for seconds and polished off the roast! I can see many uses for this rub and I can see melting it and using it as a drizzling sauce. I think it will work great for chicken. I think the next time I make this rub I will cut the black pepper by a tbsp., the cayenne by a half tsp. each. I love heat in my dishes but I believe there was just a bit too much in this rub and it took away from the heavenly combination of ginger, cumin, sugar and peppers. I might increase the thyme just a bit too. All in all it is an excellent base to work from!

I was looking for a new recipe for pork roast.  This met the need. Excellent, spicy salty sweet crust. Simply delicious. Definitely a do-over.

Very good. I made this for my family tonight and it had that sweetnett my kids enjoyed. I did not use all the red pepper the recipe called for due to little tastebuds and it turned out great.

Very nice. Bit like a porketta.  Cut down a bit on the cayenne and had no cumin.
Will incorporate some oil next time, cut down on the brown sugar by half and use it to baste my meat on the bbq.  
Thanks for sharing.  I have added this one to my favorites and will use it again with chicken or chops.

Used this rub on a pork loin that I put in a smoker with hickory chips. All I can say is OMG!!! We loved it so much we used it again on a pork shoulder the following weekend and I'm sure we'll be using it again and again.

Very, very good and leaves lots of rub for future dishes.  Too much black pepper for my taste - next time will use only one Tbsp. black pepper.

I made this rub with a few adjustments.  I didn't have any dried thyme or brown sugar.  I used Sugar in the Raw as the only sugar, reduced the amount of pepper(s) and omitted the kosher salt.  I applied the rub to two pork loin roasts, wrapped them in plastic wrap and aluminum foil, and placed the roasts in the refrigerator over night.  I reduced the roasting temperature to 300 degrees.  In the bottom my roasting pan I placed 14 ounces of water and four slices of lemon.

This is a very good recipe and I will definitely use it again.

Yummy! Sweet and Spicy and really good. I enjoyed it. Keep in mind that it makes a lot though. I had about the right amount of pork and I still had plenty left over! I tasted it before I put it on the meat and was pleasently surprised by the combination of flavors. Just right!

Great spicy flavor.  To me, pork tends to be bland.  This recipe exercises your spice cabinet, and delivers on flavor.

This recipe and rub are superb! My husband and I made a large 12lb pork loin/roast. We tripled the recipe which was a mistake, it yielded 12 cups of rub and we have tons of left over of the rub. We only needed to use 2 cups to cover our meat!

So I made this recipe months ago, but I have to say the rub is by far one of the best I've ever tasted. We had so much left over we ended up using it on tons of things. Sprinkle on sliced red potatoes with a little olive oil and place in oven @ 400 for 40 mins. Salmon, ham steaks, etc. it's awesome!!!

Made this tonight and it turned out fantastic!!! Will definitely make again. I did soak overnight in a ziploc bag with about a half cup of rub. Then before cooking I took out, dryed off and put some more rub on. Then pan seared for a few minutes and then put in the oven. Wonderful rub. Will definitely try on other meats. Great flavor and sooo tender.

In a pinch, I tried this recipe on pork chops and was very impressed with the results, even being short a few minor ingredients (dry mustard and thyme).  The rub took very well even on the grill so long as the meat was placed on the warming rack and left on high temps.  Next time I will try it as recommended and see if there's a difference.

This rub is fantastic, I'm definitely keeping this recipe!  Super adaptable too, I didn't have dried mustard or garlic powder, so I just stuffed chopped garlic in a few slits in the pork and rubbed it with a few teaspoons of prepared dijon mustard before putting on the spice rub.

This was a great recipe and I have made an abundance of the rub for future use on chicken and more pork. The loin came out tender and juicy and the rub is "friggen" great! This is a TOP favorite of mine!
Thank you for adding this!!!!

Great recipe! My family loved it. The pork was so tender and delicious, the perfect mix of sweet and spicy. The only change I made was that I added 2 tsp of sage and it was perfect. Thanks for the great recipe. There was a lot left over, so I would suggest to half the recipe.

This is my go-to spice rub!!  Not only is it good on pork loin, it has become a staple in my house for chicken wings!  I have also used it along with some chili powder on a version of blackened catfish that I make.  If you are comfortable with spicy food then leave the recipe as is.  If you prefer less use less of any or all the different forms of heat in this mixture starting from the finest ground (cayenne) to the coarsest (coarse black pepper).

Let me say I really wanted to like this rub. I let the rub sit over night on the roast. It really didnt have much flavor. I gave it two stars for the fact that it did keep the roast moist.  Thanks for sharing but for our tastes I wont make this again.

Sweet, spicy, glazy. This recipe was great but I cut down the sugar in the recipe and used 1/3 as much brown sugar as recommended and skipped the white sugar entirely. Sprinkled coarse sea salt on top just before it finished. Was SUPER tasty. Will make this again.

This rub smelled FANTASTIC as I rubbed it on the meat.  My mouth was positively watering.  In the end, I really enjoyed it, but found it a bit too sweet.  I will certainly make this again, but will increase the savory ingredients by as much as 1/2 and will add poultry seasoning.  By the way, this is would also be mighty tasty on chicken wings.  It reminds me of a "Memphis Dry Rub."

Made only one change - the only sugar I used was 1/2 c. brown sugar, and it was plenty sweet, can't imagine how tooth-aching the whole amount of sugar would have been!  Nice and spicy, just great.

Quite good, a bit sweet for me for a tenderloin but I think it would stand up nicely for barbecueing.

I made this for a friend's party.  It was awesome.  I have NEVER in my life had so many compliments and had so many people ask me for this recipe.  I used a 15 lb roast and cooked it in a cooking bag at 200 for about 6 hours.  Then we shredded it and put it in a crock pot.  I am making it again this weekend for a Luau.  It was cheap, easy and feed about 30 people.  I used just a cheap pork butt from Costco for about $22.00 for 15 lbs.

My family loved it.  Next time I will slow cook this in my crock pot so the meat will be more tender.  I think this rub would be great on any meat you like.  Def. a keeper.

Life changing. My husband loves me more after making this. I use pork loin, bone in, in my slow cooker on low for about eight hours. So EASY!

Wow, yummy!  I put the pork roast in a crock pot and it just made it for my family, it was so tender and juicy.  I will do this recipe again for my picky family.  I would just keep the air in the crock pot area ventilated it gets kinda fumey but it makes the hole house smell so good!

This was a good rub, but the kids thought it was too spicy. I prepred exactly as intructed, and let the rub sit on the loin overnight, which may have intesified the spice. I would use it again.

Hot, Sweet and Overpowering.  This is not the rub to use if you like the taste of pork.  If you have had pork every night this month and want something different, give it a try

I had such high hopes for this recipe.  It fell flat.  I hated the cumin flavour (which overpowered the rest of the spices).  I did like how the brown sugar make the outside of the meat crispy though.

I used this recipe on Christmas and it was fantastic.  Everyone raved about it.  I used as much of it as I could - rolling the pork loin over and over in it.  Whatever you do - do not forget to add the cumin.  That spice seems to be the "made it great" flavor.

i don't know if this was the best rub i've ever had but it was super good.. i was craving something spicy and this was peppery enough to help curb the craving.. i left out the brown sugar and white sugar.. scaled this down to 2 servings and wanted more like a marinade so i added 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar and some canola oil.. this was so good on the grill.. ty so much for the recipe

I am confused. Why did the ingredients list tell me to make a WHOLE bunch of rub when the directions say only "use 1/2 cup of rub on pork roast"?
Someone please clarify!!

This rub is amazing. It not only works for pork but also for steak and chicken. My family loves it, especially my husband who is extremely picky with the flavors added to meats. The kids even enjoyed it although it was a little spicy for them. Next time we mix it up were gonna cut the peppers in half to see how it is that way. Overall though, very glad I tried this recipe. Its a keeper.

This was fabulous.  I made a few adjustments.  I substituted Splenda brown sugar and Splenda white sugar for regular brown and white sugars.  I cooked my roast in the crock pot, and sprinkled my roast with Worcestershire sauce (a recommendation from a different recipe), then applied this rub mixture.  I cooked it on the low setting of my crockpot over night (10 hrs), then turned it down to warm for another 4 hrs (again based on recommendations from a crock pot recipe).   It was melt in your mouth fabulous!

I made this tonight with roasted red potatoes and Mexican corn. It was very good! I made this as written but for a five and a half pound pork roast so I was able to use all of the rub. Perfect heat and sweet. I added onions at the end. Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved this recipe.  The pork tenderloin was seasoned perfectly and so moist.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe and I was nervous that it was going to be too spicy. Instead it was great! Highly recommend...

Wow! I tried this rub on a pork loin tonight and it was the best I have ever had in my life! It is a little spicy, so cut down on the black and cayenne pepper unless you like "heat". I put a little apple juice in bottom of pan as well (another review suggested it - great suggestion). I hardly ever review anything, but since this is probably the best and easiest recipe I have ever tried, I thought it was worth registering.

We have pork loin twice a month and usually I just do an herb roast but wanted to try something different.  We LOVED this rub!!  Just the right amount of spicy hot countered with sweet.  The pork loin was one of the juiciest I've made yet and hubby said it was the best so far.  I had plenty of rub left over so tonight I'm using it on chicken.  I tossed it in a bag with the chicken and let it sit overnight in the fridge.  I did not change a single thing in this recipe and would recommend it highly.

This was delicious, and so easy.  I omitted the white sugar, used only 1/4 C of brown sugar, and 1/3 of all the rest of the spices. This was the perfect amount of rub for one roast. Cooked a little longer than the recipe indicated to get to proper internal temperature, but the roast was moist and tender.  Picky man loved this, and said he wants this in the regular rotation.  This pork roast is vastly superior to those pre-marinated ones from the store, and it cost way less and without all that sodium and preservatives.  Will definitely make again.

I had high hopes for this based on the rating and reviews...but it was just WAY too sweet and I even left out the white sugar! Certainly wouldn't call this the "worlds best".  I guess you could serve this for dessert though... :/

Overall I thought it was pretty good.  If I try it again I will cut back on the red pepper and the black pepper by a third, it was plenty hot.

The rub was delicious! I cut down on the brown sugar and left out the white sugar and it was the perfect amount of sweetness. The pork I had took about 90 minutes to fully cook but it was so yummy and moist. Saved the remaining rub and will use on many other dishes!

This is one of my very favorite recipes! I made one small change and that was I omitted the crushed red pepper (didn't have any). It still had PLENTY of kick. I also use this rub on chicken and I bet it would be terrific on ribs. Everyone in the family loves it and since it makes so much I just keep it in a ziplock baggie with my spices.

we all LOVED this!  Amazing flavor!  The young ones thought it was a bit too spicy.  But it wasn't for the 4 adults at all.  Just perfect.  Will make this my go to rub for pork roasts!

Very nice rub.  I left out the garlic powder and onion salt and added anise seed (about 1 1/2 tsp.) If you want the garlic, I would rub the meat first with a cut clove of garlic. I roasted the meat by preheating the oven to 450 and then turning it down to 325.  35 mins/lb.

This rub is absolutely delicious.  Everyone at the table 
gave it a five star rating. I modified the recipe and used a  lesser amount of crushed red pepper flakes and red pepper (cayenne). It was still mildly spicy but even the kids loved it.

I mixed this up on a Tuesday and we loved it so much we had another pork roast on Saturday of the same week. We have roasted the pork roast in the oven and also tried it on a rotisserie. They are both so so delicious. It's a little spicy but I like that. In the last month we have had it 4 times and normally we only have pork roast about once a month. Delicious!!

I used this recipe for 4 very large (1 in. thick) pork chops... delicious! I left out the dry mustard (didn't have) and cumin (personal preference) and it was still great. I baked these in the oven at 350 for about  1 hour in covered dish and then at 325 for another 30 min. or so. Yummy!

Made this last night for the world's pickiest eaters (ages 3, 5 and 43!) and they all loved it!  I made the rub exactly as written and used a 3 lb boneless pork tenderloin.  It was very good...a definite keeper.  Can wait to try the rub on other meats!

This was hands down the best pork loin I've ever made.  I prepped the rub the night beforehand and let it sit on the meat overnight.  I also added some fresh minced garlic on top and a few splashes of beer to the pan.  It baked for about an hour at which point it was still only about 140 degrees so I just turned off the oven and let it sit for another 10-15m.  I knew it was a success when I didn't see all the juices in the pan...I knew they were still in th meat.  Sure enough, the most tender and flavor pork I've had in a while.  I used the leftovers to make vietnamese sandwiches from this site as well.  I can't wait to use the remaining rub next week!

Excellent results.  I used this recipe on 1/2 a pork loin (saving the other half for later), let it set for about an hour before putting it on the grill (charcoal, over indirect heat).  Took about an hour, turned it 2 times during cooking.  The crust that the sugar creates, to go with the sweet/hot combination, was excellent.  Recipe makes more than enough for the full loin, will definitely do this again in a couple of weeks with the other half.

This rub is GREAT.  I've used it twice now and am amazed at how tender the pork is.  I didn't even really measure the spices, just kind of guessed at amounts, and it still came out terrific.  Better make extra to use next time!

It might not mean much to you but my wife went back for a 2nd serving. That rarely happens here. The combination of sweet and spicy was awesome. I did double the mustard with hot Chinese mustard because I did not have ground cayenne. Otherwise I left all else the same. What great flavor!

Nice blend of sweet and savory.  And I've even got some leftover rub for my next pork loin.  I used 1/4 less sugar and more garlic to make it more to my taste.  I will definitely use it again!

Wow! Simple and great. I used this on a pork tenderloin I had cut in half since its only the two of us. Rubbed the meat and then because of schedule changes let it sit in the fridge for an extra day. Cooked on the grill, first searing the sides and then cooking indirect for about an hour. It was fantastic, full of flavor, tender and moist. A definite keeper!!!

This rub is great on any meat.  It's amazing on a whole chicken (empty half of a beer can then stick the half full can in the cavity of the chicken and roast) as well.  Enjoy.

This had a very good flavor. My cut of pork wasn't all that tender, but not the fault of the recipe. I liked the spicy sweet taste. Will keep the leftover rub and try again next week. Thanks!

There are hazards associated with this rub, make sure you have a lot of free time on your schedule because everyone LOVES it and will be asking you to make it again. True story, I've been invited to other peoples family reunions just because I prepared the loins. This rub combined with 5hrs in the smoker may possibly be worlds best pork loin?

Very good,  but I cut down on the sugar by about a third, and also reduced some of the spices.  (Cumin, red pepper). Without that reduction it would have been too sweet and way too spicy for us. I read all the reviews and was surprised no one mentioned the oven temperature. I had it at 325 for about 45 minutes, and finally had to up the temp to 350 for another 45 minutes. If not for the cooking time and the (necessary) reduction of sugar and spices, I would have given this a five.

Amazing!  This rub is one of my family's favorites!  The recipe does make a lot though so I usually only make half the suggested amount and I do eliminate the red pepper since the kids don't like anything spicy.  Highly recommend this rub with or without the red pepper!!!

The rub goes a long way!!!  I've got the surplus stored in a Tupperware and use when needed.  My pork loin roasts are so juicy and succulent when I use this rub.  My boys fight over the end pieces!!  We love the sweet and spicy taste.  The caramelization on the roast is the piece de resistance for me!  Thus is a keeper recipe for me family.

Followed the recipe exactly except cooked at 450 for 10 minutes and 350 until done.  Bland roast.  The spices never penetrated the outside.

I cut way back on the peppers, because we do not like hot, and it was still spicy.  The meat was very tender, though.  I think if I make again, I will maybe eliminate the red peppers, and use less of the black pepper than I already did.  I also won't make the mistake of sprinkling the leftover rub on the potatoes and carrots I cooked with the pork (I had quartered the recipe, so there wasn't much left, but whoa on the spice!)

Followed Receipe exactly and had a strong bite to it.  Threw out extra rub.  Will cut off side of rest of pork roast to save what's left.  Did not let it set on meat just rubbed it on and cooked. I usually like spicy food but not this

Tried it.... I cut cayenne back to 1 tsp and added no pepper flakes.  It was still hot!  It made way too much rub for a 2-1/2 lb. roast. It was a little too sweet as well.

At first I thought the meat was too peppery. That was after I tasted it but before serving it. After serving it and finishing the meal, we all agreed it was delicious and not too peppery. But I think if you know you're not into pepper, you might want to cut down the pepper in the recipe by a little bit. What I LOVED about the recipe is how nicely the rub stayed on the meat when prepping before putting in the oven, probably due to the stickiness of the brown sugar. I made a 4-plus lb pork loin, so I used a cup of the rub and still have plenty of rub leftover to use in the future.

Great! Made gravy from drippings and all the extra rub at the bottom of the pan. Added couple of big spoonfuls of apple butter and corn starch to the gravy.  Excellent.  Will definitely do again.

Five plus stars! Winner winner, grilled pork dinner! We just finished using this recipe for grilled pork loin chops, and I don't think I can ever use another pork rub recipe again. It's already printed out. We didn't make any adjustments, and everyone loved the flavor and the crunchy bits that adhere. Seriously fabulous flavor profile.

This was an overall excellent rub! I used it on a pork tenderloin and it came out beautifully. The only change I will do next time is to cut the cayenne pepper amount in half or even quarter. It was just a bit to spicy for me and my husband. Otherwise, I will definitely be using it again. :)

This was so easy and delicious! I didn't have all the ingredients but it wasn't bad without the thyme, white sugar(not needed really), ginger or red pepper flakes. It was spicy enough with the ground cayenne pepper....
I had a smaller (1 lb 1/2) loin and adjusted the recipe thru my app and it was still delicious. But even then I had a substantial amount of rub left that I saved and will attempt to use on another meat dish...I will say that the cumin is a bit overwhelming and the next time I cook this, I will adjust to probably just a half a teaspoon....also I used a meat thermometer and it was so tender and juicy and cooked perfectly at about 35-40 in oven-remember I had a smaller loin. Def let it rest. This was great and I will definitely make again!

This was really good and made a LOT. It is a little spicy, but not so much that it bothered me (and I'm a bit of a lightweight). I didn't have any dry mustard so I just rubbed my pork loin with regular mustard and them added the rub on top.

Excellent! I used several small pork tenderloins and modified the spiciness due to my seven year old and DH who aren't big fans of hot stuff. I used a scant teaspoon of ground cayenne and no crushed. Also used onion flakes instead of onion salt because that's what I had on hand, and it could have used a smidgen of salt as a result to go with the sweetness. I was a bit concerned it would be too sweet, but it was great! I would have enjoyed the heat of the original, but I'm outnumbered. :) 

I got cooking late so didn't have time to make a gravy with the drippings, but am going to do that tonight to have with tomorrow's leftovers.

Sorry, but this can't be "the best" rub out there.  Followed the recipe, except cut the sugar -- it was still way too sweet. I love sweet and spicy together, so I really had high hopes for this, but honestly, the flavors didn't meld well at all and left us with a "hm?" vote.  You could eat it -- but there must be a better way to do pork loin.  Oh -- and watch your cook time -- use a thermometer!  Ours was done very quickly.

I love this rub and use it often as a start for other recipes to add a little more flavor. I made as described but only used 1 tsp salt since we try to avoid salt when possible in cooking. Delicious!

This was my take on it.  I measured everything exact.  I didn't read the part that it made extra rub though.  I would have cut it in 1/2.  How do you know if you even want to make it again as a first time recipe?  (My fault but no biggie).  I just bought another loin to use it all the first time.  

Its a rub.... so.... I rubbed it into the meats and I let it marinate for overnight.  I cooked it in a crock pot on low.  Added onions and garlic and about 1/2 cup of white wine.  I like my meat juicy and tender.  

Well, it was juicy and tender and PEPPERY!!!  Now.. I like hot and spicy.  More than most.  I usually cook for my son and my mom and THEN... for me.  My mom says i cook to spicy..... that you cant taste the flavor of the meat.  But this wasn't as spicy as it was peppery.  I had to drown it in mash potatoes and salads basically.  We don't waste food so I was the only one trying to rid of it. So it was edible.  But too much pepper - black and red.  

This is definitely NOT the worlds best.

Loved loved loved it. Even my picky stepson was impressed. The only change I made was eliminating the white sugar (totally didn't need it). And as I had no brown sugar, I used pure cane organic sugar instead. I will make this dish a family staple! Thanks for sharing!

We used this on Pork Loin Chops that we cooked on the grill and my family loved it. We did have to alter the recipe to accommodate young taste buds.  We cut the cayenne in half and it was great. It was still spicy enough for the adults but tame enough for the kids. We marinated for about 20 to 30 minutes.  While it marinated we started the coals to grill the meat. We will definitely use this again.

This was delicious. I had a tenderloin that was already pre sliced and so I rubbed this on each individual slice, baked according to directions, and enjoyed. The meat was tender and juicy with great flavor.

I love this recipe...sweet and spicy...I keep extra rub in my cupboard.  Last time, I put fresh pork loin in a ziploc bag, filled it with the rub, let it marinate, then froze it for another meal down the road...turned out great!

Just ok.  Didn't come alive for our family.  Maybe too sweet?

What a great rub!!! Use it on chicken, ribs, everything but beef.  Sweet, but not too.  Making another batch right now.

Awesome . I will try this again and again but will use less pepper as it's too hot for the kids. But us adults love it.

Really excellent, even without the white sugar and with a couple of chile pepper substitutions (no cayenne, used crushed red chile peppers).  Will definitely make this one again and again

This rub is fantastic. I gave it 4 stars because it is quite spicy and I will have to change the recipie next time I make it. The combination of sugar and spicy is makes the rub stand out. My family loved it!!

Delicious!! I rubbed this into two pork tenderloins and let sit at room temperature for about 2 hours before cooking. Fantastic! I used coarse ground Black Maribar Pepper (which has a bit of a kick) and a little extra crushed red pepper--had a nice balance of sweet and spicy. You can back off the black pepper, cayenne and crushed red pepper if you're serving to anyone that is sensitive to spicy. I also used poultry seasoning in place of thyme since I was out of thyme. Also, I cut the recipe in half and still only used half of what I made on 2 tenderloins. Will definitely make again!

This was great!  Even my picky husband who prides himself on his b-b-q rubs was impressed.

This was a very easy recipe to prepare and follow. My family loved this dish.  This recipe is a keeper.
