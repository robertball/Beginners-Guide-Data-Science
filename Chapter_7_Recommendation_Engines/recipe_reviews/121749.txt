WOW!! SO delicious.  A few changes made this the best coffee cake I've eaten in a while. Here is what I did. 1. Add more mashed banana (I did more like 2 cups instead of 1). 2. Add a dash of salt into the dry ingredients. 3. TOPPING: 1 cup pecans, 1/4 cup sofented butter, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon. Mix to make a crumbly topping.
I poured my batter into 2 smaller pans (2 loaf pans) so that I could freeze one.  I had to increase the bake time to 45 minutes. 
This recipe is WONDERFUL - thank you for sharing!

Very moist with a subtle banana flavor.  I was surprised even after I used 3 large bananas!  I used 3/4 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of dark brown and 2 tsp. of vanilla vs. one.  I added the cinnamon directly into the batter along with 1/2 c. of chopped walnuts (didn't have pecans).  I always use Pam for baking and poured the batter into the pan and for the topping I mixed 1/2 c. chopped walnuts, 1/2 c. brown sugar, and 1 tsp. of cinnamon.  After it was done baking I made a glaze out of 1 & 1/2 c. of confectioner's sugar and 3 Tbsp. of milk.  I drizzled that over top after it was cooled.

This coffee cake was to die for.  Everyone in our family as well as my husbands co-workers loved it.  I did add a little extra banana and for the topping I used brown sugar, a little flour, butter and cinnamon.  Can't wait to make this one again.

Wow!  This was incredibly delicious and I got rave reviews from my coworkers.  Note for anyone looking for "banana cake" - this isn't it.  It has a subtle banana flavour but it's not banana cake, it's coffee cake.  Like some other reviewers, I used pecans, butter, brown sugar and cinnamon for the topping, but the cake would have been just as good with the original topping, I'm sure.  Light, fluffy and moist.  This one's a keeper.

This is a great coffee cake!!!   I made this for an Easter brunch & it was extremely popular.  I was sure to beat the cream cheese until very, very smooth so that there were no lumps & this helped produce a very light & moist cake.  I added in 3 ripe bananas; the taste was sooo good and stood out well (which is what I was hoping for).  Will for sure make again...

Very good recipe. THANK YOU!!! A big hit with co-workers! It really annoys me when people alter good recipes, but here I go:  I added a drizzle of icing over the top made with powdered sugar, milk, butter and vanilla.

Yum yum yum.  I would put the pecans in the cake mix (or some, at least; I like a lot of pecans in my banana cake).  Also, I would add a couple of tablespoons (at least) of buttermilk, using it to mix the soda and baking powder before adding it.  And I would omit the cinnamon, which I do not think compatible with bananas.  Finally, I wish you had said, "1 cup mashed, VERY ripe bananas."  I like black-skinned overripe bananas; they are full of flavor and add tang.

Absolutely delicious! I did substitute sour cream for the cream cheese, only because I didn't have any and used walnuts, because that's all I had, but followed the recipe otherwise and boy was it good!

I love this recipe. Very good!! I did make a couple of healthy changes. Less sugar - 3/4 cup and 2 oz softened butter and 2 oz coconut oil. Also added unsweetended coconut 1/2 cup (total) to cake and also to the topping.

This was a great way to use some overly ripened bananas.  I put half of the topping in a greased bundt pan and poured the batter in.  It cooked for about 40 - 45 minutes.  We loved this cake.

Hello my name is Victoria, im 12 years old, and i love to bake! i use allrecipies all the time and this is some great coffee cake! i never follow the exact recipie, so these are the changes i added as my own little twist: a pinch of lemon zest, 1/2 teaspoon of honey, 1 1/2 tablespoons apple sauce, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg added to the topping, and i increased the flour by 1/8 to 1/4 of a cup so that the texture doesnt become too soggy. i know these ingredients sound a little outlandish, but i use most of them in a lot of my cake/cupcake recipies. these add some pizzaz to the pastry without over doing it. you may not choose to use all of them, but keep the applesauce in mind. i always use about a tablespoon of this for a great, moist texture. thanks for checking this out! my coffee cake came out great, i hope yours does too! :)

I made a 1/2 batch of crumb topping from NY Crumb Cake and sprinkled it on top of the cake about 1/2 way through the baking time.

I suppose it's my own fault for tinkering too much, cause even though the flavor was excellent the texture was way off. If I had been going for a banana bread pudding it would have been superb! The flavor is really awesome, but I took the advice of another reviewer to replace the butter with unsweetened applesauce, and I think that may have done it. All the other coffee cake recipes here suggest only replacing half the butter with applesauce for low-fat options, and I think that's probably going to be the answer here. I also used Splenda instead of sugar, which I know can sometimes throw things off, but I doubt that was it. And I doubt it was this recipe itself that's off, because the other reviews are so positive. I will probably take another stab at this in the future, because I love coffee cake and I love bananas, but I won't be doing quite so much experimentation! I'll re-rate and update my review accordingly when that time comes. Again, excellent flavor! Kudos to that.

This is amazing! I used more banana because I needed to use them up, added an extra 1/4 cup flour due to the extra banana, half brown sugar with the white and added cinnamon. I skipped the topping and frosted with cream cheese frosting when cool.

My students made this recipe for a cooking competition where bananas were the featured ingredient. They could not use pecans due to our nut-free policy so they substituted Skor toffee bits ... YUM!!! What a wonderful combination. Needless to say, they WON in the dessert category :)

This cake turned out wonderful!  I live at 9000ft and made no adjustment for high altitude.  I used 4 small bananas(2cups or so), added cinnamon to mix about a tbs., 1/4 c brown sugar and the rest white and omitted the nuts .  I baked it in a bundt pan .  I have a very small oven and that is the only pan that will fit that makes a full size cake. My topping was a mix of butter, flour, butter, brown and white sugar and cinnamon, crumbled in my fingers and spread evenly around the top.  When I removed it from the pan I left it upside down so the topping would remain at the top.  I will be making this recipe again.  Thanks.

I tried this for the first time and used natural applesauce instead of butter. I also cut back to 1 cup sugar and added a extra banana. I used a bunte pan that i sprayed with olive oil and flour.I used brown sugar and canberries along with the peacans,and put them on the top and again in the middle of the cake. needed to cooked 40 minutes. results GREAT!

Delicious! Added more banana (3-4 large). Freezes great, too.

Terrific recipe. The only change I suggest is to make the topping with brown sugar instead of white.  Delicious!

This has quickly become a family favourite!  We're not fond of nuts in our cake, so I changed the topping to:  1 cup of graham crumbs combined with 1/4 cup brown sugar, mix with 2 tbsp melted butter.

Wow!! I just made this and had a piece while still warm and it rocks!! I used 4 bananas and that was perfect! I also added butter and flour to the topping which was also very good. Easy, yummy alternative to banana bread! Love, love, love it!!

I made this according to directions but put it into two loaf pans.  Everything was fresh and up to date.  When removing the cakes and taking a slice there was a quarter of an inch of bananas that settled on  the bottom which made it very moist in that section and unappealing.

I tried this for a family get together and got good comments.  I had quite a bit left over so i took it to work for my coworkers to enjoy and they thought it was wonderful.  Many asked for the recipes.  I didn't have pecans on hand so I used chopped walnuts.  This is very moist and quite easy to make.  will make this a keeper!!!

Great Recipe! Very Moist & Delicious... used 3 Bananas which was slightly over a cup, I would probably up that to 4-5 next time (or about a cup and a half) -- I also had to bake it for 40 minutes, when I checked at 25 only the edges were brown and the middle was def. not set.    For the topping, I used 1c. Chopped/Food Processed Pecans, 1/2c. Butter 1/2c. Brown Sugar & about a tsp. of Cinammon. Put on top and bake... Delicious!

Great recipe - delicious.  However, the suggested bake time seems to be off.  I've had to bake for at least an hour before the toothpick came out clean.

Delicious! I added a cup of bananas and also added butter & brown sugar to the topping. I put mine in mini loaf pans so I can freeze some or give them away. Will definitely be making again.

Made this two days ago ... great recipe!! I made sure to cream the first ingredients until they were light and fluffy, and followed the recommendations to use more banana and use a mix of brown and white sugar. The first day the cake was moist, light and fluffy, and the following day (after sitting overnight in the fridge) it was denser and even more moist (like a pound cake). This one is going into my 'make regularly' file! Thanks!!

Delicious!  I did add an extra egg because I thought the batter was a bit thick while I was doing my mixing, and I didn't have cake flour so I used all purpose.  I didn't make the topping because I was simply in the mood for cream cheese frosting, so I put cream cheese frosting on top and then sprinkled with some "Tastefully Simple, Caramel cinnamon sprinkles" that I had on hand!  Its a winner.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

We loved this! I halfed the recipe and used Greek nonfat yogurt in place of the sour cream and almonds instead of pecans. I also used 3 bananas. It was so moist; it tasted decadent and rich.

This is a great coffee cake!   I served it to my B&B guests last week to good reviews.   The cake has a moist crumb with more texture than a normal cake.  This week I used 2 blackened bananas  (which came out to a little more than 1 C) and decided to use the streusel topping from "Amazing Pecan Coffee Cake" on this site.   With these 2 changes it is a 5-star cake in my book - I got rave reviews from my guests this week!

Have made this many times. It is my go to recipe when I want to use up bananas. I make a few changes by cutting down the sugar to 1 cup, add an extra teaspoon vanilla and mix in some cinnamon I also butter the 9x13 dish and lightly sprinkle with sugar. I have made this without the topping to and just sprinkled some sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg on top before baking. Delicious for breakfast or any time of day.

Delicious!  I used 3 bananas and it turned out great. I made this yesterday and my cake is still nice and moist and it has just enough sweetness and banana flavor without being overpowering.  Also some reviewers said it took much longer to bake than the directions say, but I didn't have that problem - it was perfect in 30 minutes. I will definitely make this again, it's a nice alternative to banana bread.

This was okay.  Mine stayed soft in the middle even though I cooked it far longer than the recommended time.  Myabe I did something wrong, and perhaps my bananas were too ripe.  It still had a nice flavor.

I made this recipe as muffins and it came out perfect!  I used 3 mashed ripe bananna's instead of 1 and still the bananna taste was very subtle.  i will definitley use more next time.   Overall great recipe!

I gave this 5 stars because EVERYBODY liked it.  I did put sliced almonds on top instead of pecans.  It was great right out the oven. This is a keeper.
