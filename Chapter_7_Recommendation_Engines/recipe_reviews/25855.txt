This recipe lives up to its name (and I don't mean "Xmas in February").  It tastes EXACTLY like cough syrup, with none of the medical benefits.  Even diluted over ice, it was far too potent for me, despite dumping in the WHOLE little jar of cherry juice (which I had to do to sweeten it up).
I didn't try this with Irish Creme, but I'm sure it would be better.  I'm sorry I wasted over 1/8 of my bottle of Creme de Menthe on this.
To its credit, though, it does cool and soothe the throat (nothing chocolate-chip mint ice cream wouldn't do), and it does have strong alcohol in it, if that's what you like.  The only reason I felt compelled to finish this drink though, was that I didn't want to waste that much expensive liqueur by throwing it out.

I can definately see nipping on this w/a sore throat.  It has a very menthol-y taste.  The 8oz glass throws me, though.  I feel like I should make in a shaker w/ice, strain into a shot glass, and shoot it.  If I were going to make this a drink, I think I'd add some club soda or other bubbles to round it out for sipping.  It's interesting, that's for sure.  CHEERS (again) DEEJAYDOC!
