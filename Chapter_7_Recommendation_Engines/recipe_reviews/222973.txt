Great easy recipe.  I would suggest a couple of things: 1) I added paprika to the flour mixture. Overall, make sure that you season the flour liberally, this will make a big difference in the taste of your cutlets.  2) Definitely do as others have suggested and dip the cutlets a 2nd time in the flour mixture - this makes for such a great crisp coating, I was amazed. 3) Make sure that you wipe the cutlets dry before coating them.   I had no problem with the coating sticking to the cutlet (I am vegetarian so I used tilapia fillets). I used a non stick frying pan and only turned them one time.  After the cutlets were golden brown I put them into a baking dish in the oven, preheated, at 350 degrees for about 17-20 minutes.  In the meantime I made the sauce and other side dishes.  When the sauce was done I took the cutlets out of the baking dish and served the sauce along side. This way of serving gives you the crisp cutlets and you can customize the amount of sauce to your personal taste.  Try this with tilapia or other white fish fillets as I did, it is great. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS!  From start to finish this took less than an hour- perfect for after work.  The key is fresh lemons and fresh parsley.  
CHANGES:  We did melt the butter in the same skillet, but poured out the excess oil first.
Also threw the parsley in within the last 5 minutes of the chicken simmering.

Served with angel hair pasta and made more than enough sauce to coat the pasta.  This recipe is a KEEPER.

This was absolutely fabulous! My daughter said, "Mom you are an amazing cook, please make this next week"  Everyone cleaned their plates!  I actually only used one large chicken breast and made 4 cutlets, it was perfect for us.  Will make again and again!

Great taste, and easy to make. Made a few minor changes based on some of the reviews. I poured out about 1/3 - 1/2 of the oil before making the 'sauce/gravy', and added an extra 1/2 tablespoon of flour to it. Had a nice consistency. Two cups flour was more than enough, next time I'll cut that back to one cup. I may also cut the lemon juice back just a bit. Will be making this again!

Awesome! I doesn't call for it in the recipe, but we decided to cook mushrooms along with the butter and flour. It works as a great addition. Also, the sauce that accompanies the chicken is great with noodles or rice.

Just made this for dinner.  Picky 6 year old asked if I could make this for dinner every night! It was very good and easy, so of course I said YES!  I used almost 2 lbs of chicken and found that 2 cups of flour is more than enough.  Served it over mashed potatoes or spaghetti - same picky 6yo does not like spaghetti - gotta try to please everyone : )

To die for! I followed the advice of others and tweaked this a little myself too. I added to the flour: paprika, grated lemon and garlic salt. I coated the chicken in flour, then egg, then flour again. Then I browned it and placed it in a baking dish. I placed lemon slices on the chicken while it baked and meanwhile, made the sauce. When I was making the sauce, I realized I had the ends of two lemons left with fruit in them so I threw them into the sauce while it cooked. The kids were a little put off by the lemony flavor, but my husband and I loved it! Definitely a keeper!

I was impressed with myself! This was an easy recipe and tasted great! I followed the recipe, as written. The only thing I tried different was re-coated a couple pieces of chicken in flour again after the egg. Didn't make a difference, and couldn't tell which ones I had done it to. Definitely make this again.

Delicious, hard to mess up (I didn't do the flour/egg covering particularly well but it didn't really matter in the end), a bit more effort than some easy recipes but not much and really tastes amazing. The lemony taste is great and I loved the batter.

Great flavor!  Even though there are several steps to make it, they all go quickly.  I made it with pounded pork loin.  Like others mentioned, I did drain all oil before melting the butter.  I also added three cloves of minced garlic to the sauce.

Easy to make and flavor is good. Too much fat in the recipe though. I cut it back quite a bit for my 1.25 pounds of chicken.

I've made this recipe 2 times now and my family LOVED it! I would recommend dipping the chicken in the egg first and then the flour. I served over angel hair pasta and a side of cooked veggies. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!

Yes.  It is very easy to make and delicious.  I used chicken already breaded and cooked the recipe in my electric fryer.

Very good, I added a little sugar to the lemon mixture to make it a little less tart but other than that it was great!

This was sooo delicious. I am not a great cook and was nervous since I was serving this to company in the first try. It was amazing and everyone LOVED it! Not too hard to follow. This will now become my go to recipe when entertaining .  My only comment is that I did not need all the flour. 1 cup would have been plenty. Delicious !!!

I have been looking for a good lemon chicken recipe that doesn't use white wine (my hubby can't stand wine in anything, unfortunately) and this one is perfect! The only changes I made were that I left out the salt & pepper and didn't serve w/ parsley or lemon wedges. Next time I will drain off the oil from the pan before melting the butter. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!

This is one of the easiest and best chicken dishes I have ever made.  The lemon juice really sets it off.  Even my husband requests it and he does not like chicken.  Fantastic.

This was delicious! Took some to my neighbor as well and they voted it the best dinner of all the ones brought in when he had knee surgery, pretty awesome to be the winner using an easy recipe. The only change I made was that I didn't read the directions very carefully and put most of the butter in with the oil when I fried the chicken. I had intended to decrease the amount of butter but then after frying I added the rest of the butter to the pan. It was delicious and buttery, I will do it again next time.  I did double-dip the chicken as well.

This is a very good recipe.  I think the instructions, though, need a little tweaking.  Even though the instructions didn't indicate it, I drained off quite a bit of the leftover oil after browning the chicken and that was an essential step.  Without that, I think the sauce would be a bit too greasy for our tastes.  I followed the cooking instructions and didn't have a problem with simmering the meat in the sauce as the sauce didn't completely cover the meat so the tops were still crunchy.  However, I did end up having to add some cornstarch to really get the sauce to thicken up.  I used thighs instead of the breast cutlets so that certainly increased the preliminary cooking time as well.  If you're using thighs or thicker breasts, this isn't a quick meal.  I think it's really important to season your flour mixture fully.  I used salt and pepper and lemon pepper this time.  Next time I think I'll try a bit of cayenne to give it a little bite.  Nice recipe!

This is absolutely the best chicken Franaise recipe that I have found and I have been looking for some time.  It doesn't look anything like the picture though.  The picture shows almost a gravy like appearance.  I have recommended this recipe to several people that are also going to try it. Thank you, GCBenezra for posting this.  My family loves it!!!

This was a very easy, moist, and delicious chicken recipe! Next time I will probably drain some of the excess oil because my mixture never quite got "thick" but it was very yummy. The lemon is what gives this that extra something!

I love this recipe and will definitely make it again. I was horrified at the last minute to realize that I had no flour, but did have Bisquick. I crossed my fingers and it came out amazing using the Bisquick. The only others changes I made were cutting back on the butter and adding a clove of chopped garlic at the end. I used 3/4 of a stick instead of a whole stick of butter and doing like others suggested, I floured and egged the cutlet twice before cooking. This created a crunchy skin.  I served the cutlets with green beans and brown rice. Delicious!

Great recipe.  After dredging in the egg mixture, I put the chicken back in the flour mixture.  Gave a nice crisp texture.

Definitely a good recipe. Everyone went back for seconds. I did add a combo of salt/pepper/garlic powder to the flour mixture. I also dipped the chicken back into the flour after the egg dipping. I also sautéed mushrooms and added them into sauce along with chicken.  Just a side note this wasn’t what I would call a quick dinner.

This was easy and tasty.  I was craving spinach and shells pasta and this fulfilled both cravings. It was spicy because I added I think too much red peppers but that’s a personal decision.  I’ll make this again!

I travel to Roanoke VA twice a year and eat at an Italian Restaurant and always order their chicken Francese cause it's the best!  When I found this recipe by accident about 6 months ago i was ecstatic! I have been making it about every other week since and my family LOVES it and that's an understatement! I also make extra for my 90 year old mother in law and she wolfs it down!  This is a keeper especially if you like a bit of a lemony flavor!
5 stars from the Walters family!

Thought this was just ok.  Wouldn't make again.  I added some extra seasoning to the flour mixture, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Though I generally like Chicken Francaise in a restaurant, I just wasn't crazy about the lemon flavor in this particular recipe.  Could have been the lemon juice I used.

I used 4 thin sliced chicken breasts, less oil and butter. Added sliced mushroom to the melted butter and let sauce until just brown, then added the flour and let cook about 2 minutes. Slowly added the chicken stock, stirring the entire time.
I would use less lemon juice and a little white wine next time.
It was a bit too lemony for us. More than enough for 2 adults.
Served over broad egg noodles.

This was pretty good- Definitely would season the chicken more- this was WAY too much flour- I threw at least a cup away. I think next time I will also season the chicken with salt and pepper before dipping in the flour. And more lemon.  It was super easy and everyone liked it.

Quick and easy. The blend of lemon, butter, and broth and chicken is perfect. I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of dried parsley  and I took the suggestion of adding a bit of paprika to the flour. I will be making this again.

This was a basic base for the recipe. You need to add more flavor to the flour first. I used lemon rind, paprika, garlic powder. Then for the broth add some nice white wine, lemon slices , capers and spinach. Flavor goes a long way.

Excellent, easy recipe.  I used olive oil instead of veg--so I needed to fry for less time.  Next time I would bake the fried filets as I made the sauce and probably reduce the sauce by half.

Absolutely delicious!!! The only thing I did different was added garlic powder to the flour and used about 2lb of chicken. After I was done pan frying the chicken I put it in a casserole dish and put it in the oven at 200 while I was making the sauce. Once the sauce was done I took the chicken out and poured the sauce over top. I served with a side of pasta. Everyone loved this dish...I think it was the best chicken francaise.

Flavor was good, definitely do the flour egg flour for the chicken.  I'd suggest using a lot less butter as this was way too much butter for my taste. Overall, not bad.

This was an easy fix and was delicious. I'm tired of making fried chicken cutlets with breadcrumbs. This was a delicious change!

Love the flavor!  I made the recipe as written. I served it with mash potatoes. Love the sauce and poured it over the potatoes. Delish!  I highly recommend you to try this recipe. Pretty easy also.

This is my second time making it. I love it. Only slight change I make is a bit of paprika and garlic powder with flour. Made it for my boyfriend first time and he loved it. Made it for me and Dad tonight and he may just miss out if he doesn't shake a leg! Thank you so much for the yummy recipe!!!

It was quick and yummy - I got rid of 90% of the oil before I put the butter in and I added the fresh sliced lemon to the broth while it thickened for extra lemony flavor.

I was surprised that everyone loved this, even my son who doesn't like chicken very much. It is quite lemony, but everyone said it was great! I made it just as the recipe said, except that I didn't have cutlets. I used tenderloins strips instead, and so the chicken was cooked through after the 7 minutes it took to brown. I just put them in the sauce and let people take them, without actually cooking them in the sauce. The sauce was a little thin but I think it was meant to be like that. It was yummy.  I served it with green beans and mashed potatoes.

Made this and it was delicious. I took some of the reviews and double dipped the chicken back in flour after egg and then out in oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes to make the coating crispy. I also used paprika in the flour mixture! Very yummy! Will be making again!

This recipe is just okay, not great, not terrible. The quantity of flour compared to the seasoning is off. Should you make this recipe cut flour in half to start with and season chicken before flour egg mixture. Sauce was good, added onion, garlic, mushrooms, and at the end tossed in some spinach.

Made this tonight for dinner using organic chicken breasts and it was absolutely delicious.  My husband prefers dark meat poultry, but even he spoke up to tell  me how much he enjoyed it.  I would, however, increase the amount of lemon juice and perhaps add lemon slices to the finished product, as it was not as lemony as I like it.  I served it over a bed of buttered linguine.  The only change I made was to add some dried parsley to the sauce as it was simmering.  I kept the chicken warming in the oven while the sauce was being made.  This was a wonderful dish that I will definitely make again.

Any sauce that requires an entire stick of butter is going to be delicious. This was very good, easy to make , and everyone loved it.  Obviously it's not the healthiest dish but I will definitely make it again.

The recipe is great and easy. I usually never measure how much flour I need for coating meat but I did this time. You don't need 2cups of flour. I had so much flour I triple dipped them in flour. Instead of using salt and pepper, I used a salt free seasoning called "Sunny Paris" by Penzeys Spices. I used a suggestion in a review to bake the chicken in the lemon sauce. I had them at 350 for 20 minutes. They were lemony and moist!

Delicious!  I used 1 cup flour total and had plenty left over even after the 2 tablespoons. I also used approximately 1/4 cup of oil instead of 1/2 cup and used only one jumbo egg.  I sautéed mushrooms in the butter for a couple of minutes before adding the flour and left out the parsley. I served it with riced cauliflower. It was so good I didn't miss the white rice or pasta I would normally use. It was deliciously lemony. My husband and son loved it!

I've just about memorized the recipe, I have made this so often. It is one of my Fiancée's favorite dish!

I usually add a can/jar of quartered artichoke hearts to this near the end, for a little extra. I've served it over egg noodles and most kinds of pasta, and it's yet to let me down!

Easy to make. I added paprika like another person said. And made sure I added enough salt and pepper to the flour mixture. I also added parsley. I actually forgot to add the chicken broth- but I'm glad. I feel like it would have been to thin. Husband LOVED it.

I was pleasantly surprised how delicious this chicken turned out and for very little effort, plus I already had all ingredients on hand.  My husband raved and the leftovers were  just as good. However, I don't think 2 cups of seasoned flour is necessary for the dredging, next time I'll use less. Otherwise, this meal was a real hit with egg noodles to be a staple item in our repertoire.

Wonderful dish!  I used bottled lemon juice and parsley  because that is all I had on hand.  I did put some sugar in the sauce to cut the acidity.  I add,ed 1 TBS of capers , 1 tsp of minced garlic, and some sliced mushrooms  to the sauce. Served over couscous. No doubts that I will be making it again soon.  I will try to remember fresh lemon and parsley.

I love this recipe!  I had made this for the first time about a year ago with my boyfriend, and we both loved it! The only change we made then was to add some sliced mushrooms to the butter/flower mixture when it simmered. This past week, I went back to this recipe again after making it a few times before and used some of the tips other reviewers gave. The recipe calls for 2 cups of flour, and I'm always left with a huge bowl of flour/chicken mush I have to throw away.  I downsized it to 1/2 cup, and that worked well for me because I had only 7 chicken cutlets to bread. I also seasoned the flour with parsley flakes, garlic powder,  paprika, Laurey's Seasoning salt, and black pepper (to taste). I added about half a table spoon of lemon juice to my eggs before I whisked them as well. I coated the chicken in flour, dipped in egg, and then flour again. I set them into a hot skillet with oil and cooked until golden brown and oh-so crispy! I followed all of the directions after that, and then when the chicken was removed from simmering  in the sauce, I added a cornstarch/water mixture to the hot sauce and stirred until thickened. This last time, it was AMAZING! I made it for just my boyfriend and myself, and I'm embarrassed to say that there were no leftovers!  He grumbled because this time there were no mushrooms, but we served it over egg noodles, which was very good. 
Long story short: Good original recipe, Amazing recipe with some changes.

Easy peasy!  Loved this dish.  Will be making it a family staple!  Way too much flour is called for though.  Only used 1 cup and that was too much.  Sprinkle a little paprika into flour before dredging.

This was my first time making Chicken Francaise and it was DELICIOUS! Very easy to follow recipe and the meal was yummy, lemony, and juicy. I would definitely make this again. I served this with rice and steamed broccoli along with Sauvignon Blanc.

Very quick and easy to make.  My husband loved it and he's a fussy eater.  I would use less flour, as I had a lot left over.  I can never seem to get the sauce to thicken.

One of my absolute favorite easy dinner options! The only thing I changed from the original recipe is that I added between 1/2-1 cup of fresh mushrooms to the skillet when adding the chicken broth and lemon juice to the sauce (as recommended by lazycook17 and other reviewers) and the result was DELICIOUS!! I served the chicken and sauce over bowtie pasta (although any pasta, rice, etc would work well!).

I did not care for this recipe. There is way too much grease, even when reducing the oil in the pan before adding the butter. Also, way too much lemon-1/4 cup overwhelmed the entire dish.

Yep. This is good.  I added the pasta like the picture.  Probably could throw in a couple of capers if you wanted...but I didn't.  Followed the recipe exactly.

First time made this as written.  Simply delicious. After making several times reduced to one cup flour and one egg, soaking in egg before flour in ziplock bag. Also use just enough oil to coat pan and sprinkled dried parsley on top when done.  Perfect, quick, easy to make.

This was just too lemony for our tastes and it was overpowering.  I used freshly squeezed lemon juice and had reservations about putting it the whole 1/4 cup but went ahead and dumped it in anyway.  If I make this again I will only use half that amount.

It was fairly easy to make and turned out very well. I changed it up slightly. I steamed some vegetables.  I put the noodles (egg noodles) down first, then some veggies, then the chicken with the rue, then sprinkled dryed parsley on top with a pinch of salt and fresh ground pepper.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and added some garlic powder and paprika to the flour.  Sauteed some chopped shallot in the butter along with some mushrooms.  An easy weeknight dinner

This was sooo good. Followed almost exactly, added a couple spices, and had to use beef broth as I was out of chicken, but it was great.  I always try to make extra for lunch the next day, but my husband ate it all!!  Definitely try this one.

The family loved it.  Not too difficult, but required alot of monitoring. Still, didn't take too long and was tender and flavorful.
