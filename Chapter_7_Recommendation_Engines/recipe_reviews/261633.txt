absolutely love this recipe. It took the anxiety out making tamales. Itâ€™s simple to follow and delicious. I cooked my tamales in the instant pot on manual high pressure for 30 min and allowed them to naturally release for 10

Great recipe! I did have to stream my tamales longer, but I think it may have been because I'm at high altitude though.
