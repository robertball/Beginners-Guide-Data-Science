When your co-workers are scraping the corn dip from the slow cooker liner...it has to be good!  I usually do recipes as they are written 1st..however, I didn't want to buy the chile-garlic sauce for just 2 tablespoons, so I added more jalapeno because we tend to be a "spicy" bunch of people.  Thank you for sharing & have already passed the recipe on 3 times.  SLOW COOKER LINERS...use it...love them!

This is scrumptious!  I forgot the lime and cilantro unfortunately.  I used frozen corn, and I think that made it a bit too liquid.  Next time, I will thaw out the corn first and let it drain.

Although this is an expensive dip, the flavor is very good. It tastes like cheesy, gooey taco dip.

Great recipe, everyone loved it hot or cold. I will share with my friends. The only thing I added to the recipe was bacon pieces and green chilies. Thanks

My new favorite dip!  I used hot sauce instead of the chile-garlic sauce but that was the only change I made.

Delicious.  Huge.
I ate so much I was in pain, and so did my guests.  Once we reached that point, there was 3/4 of it left.  And I only made a half recipe.  Seriously - this makes SO MUCH DIP.  Definitely cut the recipe in half unless you are feeding like 40 people, and it's the only hors doevres that you are serving.   Other than that, amazing.  Delicious. Yum.  Made exactly as described.

I followed this recipe to the "t".  It was very lack luster for the amount of work and ingredients. I felt it was missing something.
