These didn't have any flavor and were really dry.

These were quite good. I used a tablespoon of vanilla (because I love vanilla flavor and I always up the extract in recipes) and rolled the cookies in cinnamon sugar before baking instead of rolling them in powdered sugar after they had baked. I would make them again. They were great with my morning coffee.
