I'm not really sure how to rate these. My husband thought that they were okay and honestly he was a little disappointed. I did like them, they reminded me of an apple crisp with carmel. However, prep was ridiculously long due to the caramels. I would recommend buying a caramel sundae sauce and just drizzeling it over the apples, it would make the process a lot easier.

Delicious and moist! Substituted caramel ice cream topping for unwrapped caramels and had no problem getting topping evenly over apples. I heated the topping in the microwave to make the consistency a little thinner which made it easier to pour.

These were quite good, but they do fall apart a bit when you try to cut them while still warm as the recipe suggests. I melted the caramels on the stovetop in a non-stick saucepan with a tablespoon or two of water added and they came out smooth. Rather than try to "spread" the caramel, I just drizzled it over the top of the apples with a spoon and it worked out fine. The prep time for this is quite a bit longer than 15 minutes though....I'd say at least 30 minutes; baking time is accurate. Be sure to use real butter in the crust...it DOES make a big difference in the taste.  We liked these better chilled than fresh out of the oven.  Quite addicting though...my husband keeps asking for them. Thanks!!

I'd like to preface this by apologizing for this review. I was very disappointed. I followed the recipe verbatim. The chopped apples (I used Granny Smith) were mushy. The flavor was not outstanding. I read such rave reviews, I had to try this. I do not consider myself a gourmet, but
would not feel comfortable serving this at a pot luck or bringing it to a church function. The topping was not appealing to the eye, as well.
I verified the recipe steps, ingred., measurements, and feel that this review is merited. Sorry...

This is a nice change from regular apple crisp.  Very easy to make.  I layered caramel apple sheets instead of melting caramels.  Saves tons of time unwrapping and melting caramels.

This was so good.  I had some difficulty with the caramel topping because it didn't melt to a smooth consistency.  A great success.

I'm not sure about the no fuss issue, but these are good.  Now, how to get the bottom crust to be as crisp as the top.  These are best eaten warm...oooh that top crust/crumbles.  If I make this again I'll use caramel sauce as others suggested, I used stale/hard caramels that I had in my pantry from x-mas & melted with some butter flavored shortening, it was somewhat a pain.  Thanks Hot Pam.

Very yummy!  They do fall apart a bit when you try to cut them.  I will try to refrigerate next time before cutting.  I used old fashioned oats instead of instant, only because that's what I had on hand, worked okay though.

DELICIOUS! Took them to my church small group tonight and they were a tremendous hit. 

I couldn't find the wrapped caramels in the store, but in the baking aisle found caramel bits (no need for unwrapping) used two 11 oz bags and added 1/4 cup of 1/2 and 1/2 to the melting caramels. So yummy!

Followed recipe, using old-fashioned oats (what I had on hand)...tossed apples with generous amount of cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg.  Prebaked the bottom crust for several minutes.  Used 1 package Krafts caramel bits melted in microwave with 1-2 T. milk.  Drizzled over the apples without a problem.  Added toasted pecans to the top layer.  After the pan was out of the oven for awhile, I started to make cuts, and once it was room-temp. I had no trouble cutting into bars.  Served with vanilla ice cream and extra sprinkle of cinnamon.  All in all yum! May want a bit more caramel next time for extra decadence...

My kids, husband and co-workers all LOVED these bars. I found them a tad sweet. I think they would benefit from a little lemon added to the apples if you're using sweet ones (I used Rome), or else use sour apples (like Granny Smith). A little sea salt added to the caramel might make the "caramel-ness" stand out a bit more, as well. But I liked the fact that I could use fresh apples for a bar cookie, and these worked out fantastic.

Awesome!  I read the other reviews and made this recipe with 2 bags of Brachs Milk Maid caramels melted over medium low heat with a 1/4 cup of whole milk.  This was so easy and tasty!  I will definitely make it again.

This was waaay too sweet for me & I had to throw the whole thing out - my son couldn't even eat it. I cut back on the sugar but it was still too much. Thank you for sharing, but I'll try another recipe next time.

I think these are fantastic!  I did melt the caramels in the microwave with a couple tablespoons of milk...super fast and easy.  I also used only 4 cups apples, 2 Granny Smith and 1 Gala.  Would be delicious with chopped nuts added as well.  Definitely refrigerate before cutting.

This tastes SO good, but it was more likely a cobbler than bars. The only change I made was the addition of cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice (which I would absolutely recommend). I would make these again, but I wouldn't cut them. I would serve it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream in a bowl!

Certainly not something you can eat without a plate and a fork, as "bar" would suggest, but absolutely yummy.

Super yummy. I think I will use a bit less salt next time and try more caramels. I mixed the crust/topping in my kitchen aid mixer, melted the caramels on med-low then poured over the apples. Baked 25 mins then let them cool for about an hour before cutting then let them sit another 30 mins before removing from pan. I would let them sit longer to set but they held together just enough that we could eat them as bars w/o needing a utensil.

Delicious and pretty easy to make. I melted the caramels in the microwave. I heated them for 20-30 seconds at a time, stirring in between and watching to make sure they didn't burn.

I took this dish to a Halloween Party and everyone loved it.  The recipe said it tasted like a caramel apple; I just didn't taste very much caramel, so next time I make it, I will be adding more caramels!

Great recipe!  I used caramel topping too and it worked wonderfully.  I added pecans to the top oatmeal mix and it turned out to be just what we were looking for. Prep time took awhile, but it was worth it.  Thank you for sharing.

These bars were delicious!! I baked the bottom crust first for about 12 mins and that helped keep the bars together. I also added cinnamon to the apples like other reviewers had suggested which was a nice touch :) The caramels were a little tricky but I put them in a saucepan on low heat with a little water(since I didnt have milk) and kept stirring so they wouldnt stick, then drizzled it on the apples. The only thing I would change is probably eliminating the salt all together. I could kind of taste it in the bars and it just wasnt my preference. Overall, the bars turned out great and I'd definitely make them again :)

These are divine. They are somewhat crumbly, but we just ate them with forks. Warm them in the microwave for extra scrumptiousness. Mmmm!

Awesome!! Definitely worth the trouble of peeling and chopping! I had to add a little milk to the caramels so that they would melt smoothly, but maybe it was because of the brand I used.

These bars were a big hit at my house. I put the bottom crust in the oven to bake while I melted the caramels so that it wouldn't get soggy and it worked great.  But I think next time I will try the caramel topping that others suggested becuase it's a pain to unwrap and melt all those caramels.

These bars were delicious but a real pain to make! I had to use double the caramel that the recipe called for because the caramel hardened so quickly that I couldn't get it to spread across the apples. They also did not stay in bar form very well, but it tasted great over ice cream.

I brought these to a teacher luncheon they were really good, although a little rich for me. All in all it was a good recipe, there were no leftovers.

WOW!  These are dangerous, what a wonderful Fall treat.  I made them exactly to the recipe except that I increased the caramels by another 16 pieces and they are perfect!  So good, and a great twist of a carameled apple and apple crisp.  Thanks for the recipe!

I halved the recipe (used 8 inch square pan) because I accidentally ate quite a few of the caramels...oops! This turned out great! I was really surprised at how good they tasted cold because I usually like my apple dishes to be warm. They actually tasted even better out of the fridge the next day.
These were easy to make (despite what some other reviewers warned)...I did microwave the caramels, and the only issue that I had was that the second the caramel was out of the warm bowl it started to get very hard very quickly. Therefore, I had to drizzle the caramel over the apples, not spread it. This will be a great addition to our bake sale repertoire.

These were very tasty! My youth group cooked for a church meeting and I brought these for one of the desserts- their was nothing left at the end of the night. I didn't change the recipe, though I guessed at the amounts of caramels (we buy bulk) and lemon juice. I loved that the caramel filling didn't go chewy and hard. :)

Everyone seemed to like these, and they were easy to make. I melted the caramels in the microwave, which is much easier.  I also added a little cinnamon.  Yummy!

I tried this recipe since apples and caramels are my favorite combination. I found that these are way too sweet for me. I think that if I ever make them again I would use a very tart apple and cut back on the sugar.

This bar was very tasty---no spices needed, good flavor. I don't consider it a "no fuss" recipe, tho. I scorched two batches of caramel, trying to melt them as directed. On the third try, I resorted to the microwave on low power, stirring & checking frequently.A double boiler is an option as well.

Oh...my...my...my!  These are mighty tasty!  I wouldn't call them a cookie, though--more of a "crumble" I'd say.  The crust-like part does taste just like an oatmeal cookie, though.  We also added chopped pecans for more interesting texture and crunch.  Absolutely scrumptious warm with a blob of ice cream.  I have never been a fan of cooked apples, but this one is THE exception!  Yum...oh YUM! Tooooooo good!

The caramel bars were great!  I did not have wrapped caramels, so I just made a simple sauce.  They were really yummy.  Next time I think I will add more apples though.

Good taste, but too much trouble. I have made these twice & both times have found it impossible to get the caramel evenly placed on top of apples. Ended up with clumps of caramel. If I make again, I may try using chopped unmelted caramels.

I used a very similar recipe - the only differences were no lemon juice on the apples and the addition of 3 Tbsp butter or margarine for melting the caramels. I signed on here to see if there were any suggestions for replacing all those caramels - what a pain, and they take forever to melt! But the recipe itself is delicious, we cut and serve it at room temperature. I would have preferred more of a caramel taste but my husband thought it was perfect. When drizzling the caramel I suggest keeping it away from the edges, if it sticks to the dish when baking it gets really hard. I am going to try the caramel topping next time. Yummy!

Yummy, but too sweet. I used a caramel sauce instead of melting caramels and I only had Jonagold apples, so those things might have contributed to the sweetness. I did cut down on the sugar. Also, it didn't hold up at all. I really wanted a bar, but what I got was a big gooey mess. A tasty mess, but not what I was expecting. I think the idea of an apple caramel bar is great, but I'll probably try another recipe next time. Thanks anyway.

Prep time was more like 30 mins.  I only gave this a 4 star because everyone else liked it, I thought it was just okay.  I do have to say though this came out very moist, more like a cake then a bar.

This was good, although I expected something differnt.  Maybe for it to be more gooey.....  I found it a little salty so I'll cut the salt in half next time.  But overall I did enjoy it.

Delicious bars, but at least in my case, these took way longer to prepare than the recipe indicated.  Does anyone have a better method for melting and especially, POURING the melted caramels?  Very difficult to spread, I thought.  I did have to bake longer than the reciped said to.  Everyone has enjoyed eating them, but I didn't really enjoy making them.  I will probably make these again, because they are so good...I'll just be like Henny Penny and recruit help from those who want to eat them, to help me make them!!

These are soooo good!  I couldn't wait to take them out of the oven; the smell was wonderful.  The texture is good, the flavor is excellent, and they disappear really quickly.  I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and a half teaspoon of nutmeg to the flour/oat mixture, so it smelled like I had an apple pie backing.

Great bar cookie, but I had trouble with it being so moise that it would not stay in a bar form.  Wonder if you could use carmel sundae syrup instead of carmels?

I was tired when I made these last night but had to get them done for a farewell at work today. I chopped 3 scant cups of apples, did NOT peel them or wash in lemon. Forgot to dredge them in flour  before adding to bake pan so I sprinkled it over them. Then I ADDED home made cinnamon sugar (Vietnamese cinnamon). I used Kraft caramel as they are soft; one 11 oz bag and 10 ea from 2nd bag. Be careful, easy to burn even on low if not watching. After adding the layer of crumble  I sprinkled more cinnamon sugar on the top. Saved some bars for my brother who is my pro sampler and am sure he will love them as much as I do! They look just like the pic shown here...I will let you know if the co-workers like them. Next time I will use the full amount of apples and more cinnamon...stay tuned!!!

Yummy! I really enjoyed these... really good with vanilla ice cream! I didn't taste the carmel very well so I think next time I make these I will add a little bit more camel.

This dessert was wonderful! It did take some prep time to unwrap the carmels, but it was all well worth it! Thanks for a wonderful Fall treat!!

Wow. This tasted amazing. I am glad that we took the other reviewer's advice and used super tart apples, it would have been way too sweet otherwise.

I absolutely loved these! I am a huge caramel lover so I add pretty much whatever I can find. I usually add some Chocolate-caramel morsels, and instead of individually wrapped caramels I use Caramel Apple Dip when I have some. These have always been a huge success with anyone.

Although this bar was very good, it was a real pain to work with the carmels.  No matter how low I turned the burner down, it still browned on the sides.  I ended up transfering to a bowl and doing it in the microwave, but still a pain.  Then clean up was horrible.  Everything had to soak for a very long time and even then I had to use a lot of elbow grease to clean up the carmel.  Bars are good, but will never make again due to the hassle with the carmel, not worth all the trouble.

This turned out more like apple crisp with the taste of carmel - than a bar.  Still very good and a nice change, but I had wanted a bar.  I used carmel sauce instead of individual carmels and that made the process easier

Yummy ~ my (picky) kids gave this one 10 thumbs up!  I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to crust mixture for a little more flavor and melted the caramels in the microwave for ease.  Also, make sure to use supertart apples to balance the very sugary-sweet caramel & crust.  This recipe is a keeper!

Recipe was great. I used a jar of caramel sauce instead of the wrapped candies. I thought this made it much easier. My daughter enjoyed helping me make these bars. We would make this again.

I didn't change a thing in the recipe. It was great on it's own. I did, however, melt the carmels in the microwave per the instructions on the back of the bag of Kraft's carmels. EASY! Good hot or cold!! This is a 5 star keeper!! Thanks Hot Pam!!

These bars are awsome. I have made them three times and each time they were better than the last. They taste best served chilled with vanilla ice cream.

Basically an apple crumble kicked up with the carmals.  If you love carmal apples you will enjoy this.  Also, like a crumble, it would be best served warm with vanilla bean ice cream.  Very good and quite rich.

I made these for church and the whole pan disappeared! Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe!! So very yummy! I think that they are best served warm.Just imagine serving vanilla ice cream with this! I used a double boiler to melt my caramels, and it stayed very warm and smooth and poured easily over the mixture. I will most certainly make these again!
