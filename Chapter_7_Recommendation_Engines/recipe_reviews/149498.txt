A nice hearty fall meal.  I liked the flavor of the beer and the maple - it gave it a slightly sweet flavor.  I did cook it down longer than suggested (about 65 minutes), so it was the thickness I liked.  After the 45 minutes suggested, it was more like a soup.

A thoroughly solid lentil stew. There was more flavour than my Oma's, but dumplings (like hers) would really put this in five star territory. Be careful with the amount of dried lentils that you add, as it will drastically change the amount of liquid left over. I found 1 and a half cups of lentils created a thick stew, while a single cup had significantly more broth. I used both red and green lentils together with success.

We are lentil lovers in our house so I was looking forward to trying this soup with a twist. It really was very good and a good alternative to a classic German Lentil soup. The 4 star rating is because, the beer I used was a bit too bitter and the next time I will choose another brand. I also suggest to cook up a bit more bacon so you have some to crumble on top when serving. I served it with homemade cornbread which really complimented it well. This is a soup that will help us get through the cold winter!

My husband loved this stew. The maple lends a hint of sweetness. I also added kielbasa to mine, which I add to just about every soup/stew that involves legumes! Makes for a good meat addition.

Excellent stew.  Prepared by the recipe - used Sam Adams' Winter Lager for the beer - and served it over brown rice.  Definitely a keeper!

This was very tasty!  Since my children are young I omitted the beer, which probably would have made this truly great and give it a little contrasting flavor. I added a pound of ground beef, which was overkill, so I would omit any additional meat or reduce the amount next time. I also cooked it longer to make it less soupy.  I'll add some chard or leeks next time to add a few extra vitamins since this already packs in the protein.

Super duper fantastic. Giving it a 5 star rating because the recipe is nice on it's own, but it's easy to play around with, which makes it a real winner.  I use canned lentils, and I added a 1/4 cup, or so, of dried red lentil to deal with the soupy-ness some other reviewers have mentioned. The dried lentils help thicken it up and give it a nice taste while boiling. I also use veggie broth instead of beef (personal pref).

I took the advice of another reviewer and cooked it for 65 minutes, and thought that was a good length of time.  I would use a little less maple syrup next time as it was very sweet. My family thought it was only "okay", which is why I give it a 3 star rating.  Maybe it will be even tastier the next day.

This isn't a stew, but a soup... And a bland one at that. I'd bought green lentils on sale, and was looking for ways use the bag. The flavours sounded good, and the seasonings intrigued me. Perhaps it didn't turn out stew-ish because I used a different kind of lentil. I didn't find the soup sweet at all, actually maybe another spoon of maple syrup would have done it some good, and at least doubling the seasonings. Was eaten, but didn't entirely care for it. The bacon would do better used as a topping after cooking. I like the flavour ideas in this recipe, and may apply them to a recipe of my own creation.

This stew was a great choice for a cool, rainy Sunday.  The flavors combined perfectly.  I doubled the recipe (for more leftover) I will definitely will be making this again!

This soup was excellent. I didn't have caraway seed or celery salt but it didn't seem to matter. The taste was wonderful... rich and hearty. I will definitely make it again.

This was very good.  I took into account some of the reviews and added an extra 1/2 cup lentils to thicken it up. I omitted the beer and added in another 4 oz of beef stock, reducing the liquid somewhat.  After it was done, I added some sliced, grilled kielbasi.  Served it at a luncheon and everyone loved the flavor and several asked for the recipe.

Tastes like beer with a touch of maple.  Lentils needed cooking longer. Bacon was soggie.  Okay the first day but by day three I couldn't eat it because it reminded me of dinking an old beer.  This would be a goood camping recipee.

Great flavour! So hearty.. I took this canoeing and it was perfect. My only complaint was that it was a tad gritty. I did use red lentils though, not sure if that matters. I made it with pancetta instead of bacon - awesome!
