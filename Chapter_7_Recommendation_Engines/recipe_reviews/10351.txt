These were fair.  Certainly not a loss, but I'm not sure I'd make them again.  I have a different recipe for chocolate swirl cookies I like better, they come out a little fluffier. 

This recipe produced chewier cookies - I'm not sure I'd say there were like brownies, but not crispy or soft like cookies normally are.

Taste-wise they're fine.  The combo of flavors works.

These just tasted like brownies. And, if you don't wait long enough for the chocolate to cool you will not get the "swirled" effect.

Look great, but just so-so.  I expected more flavor and really have no idea what to add that could make this better.  Not going to make these again.

As others have mentioned, something is missing. They have an excellent soft brownie like texture.  Needs a bit more sweetness to be considered a true cookie, maybe add some frosting.  Descent, but I won't make again.

These cookies, while quite nice looking, were just ok. I think they needed more chocolate flavor. I am giving this recipe four stars because the texture was awesome, it was just lacking flavor.

They were alright.  Might be fun for taking to a get together just because they are interesting to look at but not much flavor.

These tasted great.  I think next time I might try to frost them because the colors of the mixing on mine turned out not very attractive.

They are good, but like someone mentioned before, there's something missing - - don't know exactly what it is...the first bite isn't what you expect, but they're not bad - just need more flavor.

As others have said, this reminded me of a brownie. I found this "cookie" to be quite boring and bland. I would not make again.

These cookies were just okay.  They do not really spread and as another reviewer said, they taste more like a brownie than a cookie.  Probably would not make again.  Sorry

I must have done something wrong! These were the ugliest cookies I ever made! They tasted good, but I followed the directions and "dropped" them from a teaspoon, and as anohter reviewer said, they didn't spread...because of the marbled color, they loked pretty awful! I rolled the second batch into balls and then pressed with a fork for a nicer presentation. Not sure these will become a family favorite!

I loved these cookies!  I took them to a company picnic and they were a big hit.  Great flavor!
