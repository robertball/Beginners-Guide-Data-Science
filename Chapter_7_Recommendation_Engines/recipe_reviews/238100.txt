This recipe is a keeper!  My husband and I enjoyed it.  I cut the recipe in half as there is just 2 of us and omitted the black olives.  I used a homemade enchilada sauce recipe, but I also think the a mixture of the cream cheese and salsa would be great as a top sauce!  I have never cooked with corn tortillas and they seemed to tear easily, so I heated them up using a little cooking spray in a skillet for 15-30 seconds.  A little more prep, but it helped the tortilla to be more flexible!  Thank you for sharing!

These were delicious! I doubled the recipe and divided into smaller pans to freeze for a quick meal for later.  The only change I made was swapping regular cream cheese for jalapeno cream cheese, but we like spicy food. These reheated well too!

I am a fraternity chef so I cook in large quantities. I don't follow recipes to a "t" because seasonings  have to be adjusted carefully. I didn't have scallions which would have been wonderful but I added some cans of chopped Mexica Chilis along with Rotel tomatoes with. Chilis. I also threw in some Saxon seasoning and garlic powder.  I made the 10 minute Enchilada sauce recipe sauce from this site. I made the first pan by dipping the corn tortillas in the sauce before rolling them.  I then looked at the 20 pounds of filling that I had left to roll and decided that they were going to become Enchilada Casseroles. I basically put the meat mixture on the bottom of the pan, tore up the corn tortillas, covered with the sauce and loaded the top with Kraft Shredded Mexican Cheese. Browned in oven. The guys went nuts over it! I froze some of the meat and sauce for mac & cheese night to make an Enchilada Mac & Cheese. Sorry that this is so long but the recipe was such a hit, easy and forgiving!

I had roasted 3 whole chicken and was looking for a recipe to use it up.
I substitued 1 1/2 lbs of chopped up cooked chicken for the ground beef, omitted the sweet and green onions, added more salsa, used 1 tbsp homemade salt free taco seasoning, used 18 corn tortillas and made homemade enchilada sauce using the Easy Enchilada Sauce recipe, I used triple cheddar shredded cheese as well instead of pepperjack.
Made 2 pans of 9 enchiladas, one for dinner and one for the freezer, enjoyed by my family and I liked it used ingredients I had, I will add spinach next time as I think it would be great with the chicken.

I didn't have all the ingredients so I had to do a few supplements. I also made my own enchilada sauce . All in all it was good and my family enjoyed it. I will try it again with all the required ingredients next time.

I'm almost sorry I found this recipe.  It's requested TWICE a week now.  I've made it a grand total of four times.  The first two times, I made it exactly as written.  I slow cooked a shoulder pork roast and a slow cooker chicken the last two times.  Again, I followed the recipe as written, save for the two times I used different meats.  Next on the list is beef.  I'm sure it'll be excellent.  I also made the enchilada sauce and taco seasoning from other recipes here.  Totally worth it.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I followed the recipe to the letter and my family loved it. Even my picky eaters gave it a thumbs up. Next time, I will make half without olives, but that is really the only change I would make. This is a keeper!

Delicious! I used a whole 8oz. pkg. of pepperjack shredded, and I'm glad I did b/c 1 cup wouldn't have been enough, IMO. Also, the little guy prefers flour tortillas, so I used them (the soft taco size), and got 8, generously filled enchiladas, which was more than enough for us for dinner and lunch leftovers. I only bought 1 can of enchilada sauce, but that was plenty for us. I also topped these w/ some sliced green onions in addition to the cheese and black olives before baking. This was a HUGE hit tonight and that makes this a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Tia is a great recipe. I used Las Polmos enchilada save and added 1 med can of green chiles too. If you like things hot you can add one can of Chipotles in adaobo sauce as well.

Fantastic. Everybody loved it. Teenage kids would have liked more sauce on the sides of the enchiladas and in the pan. Served with corn, beans and rice. Keeper.

Wow!!! Delicious! Everyone raved about them. The only difference was I had Mexican Cheese Blend instead of pepper jack and I mistakenly threw in the olives with the beef. A clear winner!

I made these for my family get together and everyone loved these! Only difference I made was I put jalapeños and black beans in with the mix and I used a medium enchilada sauce instead of mild. With my additions I would have given it a five star but that's just because of our taste buds. I will be making this again and again for dinners.

I try a lot of new recipes a lot.  This one got the best reaction from the Hubs I ever had.  The only change I made was using 1 pound hamburger, and 1 pound chorizo.  I got 14 enchiladas and froze half.  This is awesome.

Delicious! Love that it requires only basic ingredients, and it is easy to make. This recipe is going to be a regular. I wonder if it would be as good if one made a double batch and froze one for later. May need to try that next time.

Very tasty recipe.  Husband couldn't stop eating it. Since there are only 2 of us it would have been better to make it in 2  8x8 pans to cook the second another day.  Served with mexican rice.  I too didn't have olives on hand but it was excellent without them.

Everyone loved it. It was easy to make, too. I cheated and turned it into a casserole because I was running short on time. Layered the tortillas on bottom and under the cheese/sauce. We'll definitely make this again.

This was easy, quick, and delicious. Perfect for a weeknight dinner. I used a whole bag of cheese, 1 can of enchilada sauce, and left out the green onion. Thanks so much for sharing! Will definitely make again.

I didn't love the enchilada sauce I got so will look for a different brand next time. I can't find large corn shells, so used the small ones. Heated them up first because they are so fragile when you roll them if they are cold. I used 2 lbs. Meat because you can't find1 1/2 lb packages. There was supposed to be enough for twelve, but I made 20. Had Meat left over. I just put that on t top. We only ate 10 so have leftovers. My wife and son really liked them so I will make them again.

Delicious!
I love how the cream cheese made the filling so creamy. I also added pinto beans and corn to the mixture, with loads of cheese and jalapeño on top.

Great recipe, and very flexible. I made a lot of changes so I could use ingredients I had on hand. Only had a pound of ground beef, still used the entire package of taco seasoning, but they weren't over seasoned. Didn't have salsa or pepper jack, so I subbed a can of Rotel and shredded cheddar. Left off the olives because I'm not a fan of black olives. Added half a bell pepper (diced, cooked along with the onions) to use up what was left from the Spanish rice I made to go with. Only had a pack of 8 low-carb flour tortillas, so they were a bit overfilled and I only needed one can of enchilada sauce to cover them, but they still came out great. Even received a thumbs up from my daughter who isn't much of a fan of anything even a little spicy. I'll be making these again.

This dish was AMAZING! No changes were necessary. This dish was full of mouth watering, tummy grumbling flavor! My husband and our children went back for a second helping, and requested it for lunch and dinner the next day. I paired it with refried beans and a family recipe for spanish rice. Excellent dish!

We skipped the olives. Used Spanish onion and green onion, not cooked in the fat from the meat. Used restaurant style salsa instead of enchilada sauce and topped them with more meat mixture before adding the cheese. Absolutely delicious!

This was really great. I made it for dinner tonight and there were no leftovers, everyone loved it. Simple and delicious. The pepper jack cheese was a great addition, since I usually use cheddar. I really enjoyed the creamy filling.
