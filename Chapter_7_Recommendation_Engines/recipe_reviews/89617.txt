This was a simple, flavorful side dish.  Instead of Italian dressing I used marinated artichoke hearts and just added a little salt before the first baking.

This was ok. I am not the biggest fan of Italian dressing,so I thought the dressing overpowered the artichokes. Next time I try this I will sub Olive Oil for the Italian dressing

Great and simple way to prepare artichoke hearts.  You can play with this recpe alot and unless you're an Italian dressing  nut I would suggest a lighter marinade (slightly seasoned EVOO works just fine).  I make variations of this dish on a regular basis.

This dish was super simple to make, and very yummy to eat.  I used marinated artichokes, so I eliminated the italian dressing.  I will certainly make this dish again.  I think it would work really well as an appetizer, or buffet dish.

I have never been too fond of just artichoke hearts in themselves but found this to be quite tasty. I added in some diced mushrooms and my own preferred spice varitey to give it that special zest. . .

As a big artichoke fan, I was disappointed with this recipe.  It was bland and uninteresting, not at all what I expected.

I took LorraineT's advice, and just used marinated artichoke hearts.  Maybe the original recipe is intended to be a "lite" version?  Anyway, I would also add more cheese!

Good but too vinegary.  Might cut the Italian Dressing and use milk, italian spices and water in place.

Due to the bland comments, spiced it up a bit with black pepper, red pepper flakes and minced onion....still seems like it needs something else but it was pretty good

This is my go-to recipe when I am asked to bring an appetizer to a party.  I also use marinated artichokes and probably extra cheese and lots of the French fried onions.  Serve with Fritos or Scoops and you have a winner. I am always asked for the recipe

I used marinated artichoke hearts and omitted the Italian dressing.  This was flavorful but probably not something I'll make again.

Mmmm, when I had a Costco membership, I’d buy the giant jar of artichoke hearts to make this recipe. It’s quite delicious for marinated artichoke hearts fans.  I used a “local” creamy Italian dressing (Otts).

It’s best out of the oven. Harder to reheat and get that melted mozzarella cheese.

I didn't think I'd like this, but I really did! It was a little too much Italian dressing, so next time I'll cut back to 1/3 cup. I baked the onions for about 5 minutes, 1 min didn't seem enough. Will definitely make it again with the changes.

I read the reviews so decided because I like spice, I added a little red pepper flakes, some minced onion, and black pepper.  I also cut down to a little more than 1/4 cup Italian and added some olive oil.  Fabulous, definitely my taste.

Made it with Sweet Onion & Bacon vinaigrette, used mostly Irish cheddar cheese but some mozzarella and parmesan too. Went over well for Easter dinner .
