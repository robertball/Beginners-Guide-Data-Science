I have made this recipe for years.  One thing  I have found that works well is instead of buying french or itlian bread loaf I buy individual crusty hogies found in the bakery at the grocery store. It makes the sandwich more managable to eat, especially for my kids. I also make this to take to parties and I use 2 long thin baguettes.  When you slice them it is perfect bite size pieces. They get ate up quick!

I was pleasantly surprised by how good this was.  My loaf of bread might have been bigger, as 1 1/2 lbs of beef was barely enough. As others suggested, I added a packet brown gravy mix to the beef. I made this in advance to warm later so decided to scoop out the bread, spread the loaf with garlic butter and toast it. I then loaded it up and refrigerated it until dinner time.  I then put it in the oven at 300 to warm and then broiled the top until the cheese was bubbly.  My 17 year old son at one of the halves all by himself, while my hubby and I shared the other.   A keeper for sure!

This sandwich is a great idea!!  Per other reviews, I seasoned up the meat a bit more with garlic salt, pepper, and Monterey Steak Seasoning.  Also, added mushrooms.  What's stroganoff without the mushrooms?  I thought all that sour cream sounded like a bit much(I'm not a huge fan of it)  So I still used the 1 cup of sour cream, but used 2 TBS of worcestershire instead of 2 tsps.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for the starter recipe which turned out to be a very tasty, filling meal!

I thought this was really good.  I generously added garlic powder to my hamburger as it was browning and then added a packet of brown gravy mix with the sour cream step.  I also used 1 TBSP of worchestershire instead of only 1 tsp.  Did salt and pepper to taste.  I must have had a big loaf of bread because I didn't have enough meat mixture to cover both sides.  That was OK though because it made it much easier to close!  Very good, messy, easy.

Hubby and I really liked this.  I did add some garlic powder to the meat as it was browning.  I think it turned out very good.  Put the cheese on hubby sandwich but left it off of mine....liked it that way.  Thanks for the post.

This is really good! I also, like many, added spices while browning the beef. But I make this all the time. Fast cheap and easy! I also put jalapeno peppers, the pickled kind, and it turns out just perfect!

We are not tomato fans so we left those off, but followed the recipe other than that.  The flavor of the hamburger mixture and green peppers and cheese goes together perfectly. My husband hates sour cream so I was worried since these have so much in them...but they were a huge hit!  We both loved them and each ate two big hoagies!  Must try!

After some changes I would rate this a 5 star recipe. My family enjoyed it, even my 3 kids. After tasting the meat mixture I also added a packet of brown gravy and it added alot of flavor. I also added the green peppers with the onion to cook them slightly and used some fresh mushrooms and garlic instead of the garlic powder. I will use this recipe again. Thanks

This was pretty good, a little bit bland.  It lacked some of the good "beefy" flavor that real beef stroganoff has, so you might want to consider adding some bouillon or something.  Green peppers were a great touch!

Sorry, this recipe was rather tasteless and very messy.  We ate a "sandwich" each, then tossed the rest.

This recipe made great sandwiches!  Everyone in the house loved them.  I did add a little more garlic powder and worchestershire sauce, and a beef bouillon cube to the milk.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

I was skeptical...I mean...stroganoff on a sandwich?? But it turned out to be really good. Different--but good. Hubby and I liked these a lot, but the two-year-old didn't like them at all. I used hoagie rolls to make the sandwich more manageable. I added mushrooms, extra Worcestershire, and skipped the green pepper since we don't like them. I added the green onion with the tomato since I prefer them raw. Whatever you do--DON'T skip the tomato!!! It really makes this sandwich. Thanks for sharing.

I thought this was really yummy! I gave it four stars only b/c I didn't make it exactly as is, but added different seasonings. I seasoned the meat with garlic salt and McCormick's Montreal Steak seasoning. I served it open face and the whole family loved it.

Excellent sandwich!  I added a packet of a jaus to the sour cream and it gave it more of a meaty taste.  Will definitely make again.

Excellent.  After reading other reviews, I added some beef boullion and the garlic to the hamburger as it was cooking.  I also added mushrooms and some black/red pepper combo.  The adults really enjoyed, the kids not so much unfortunately.  Next time they can have a pbj!  Thank you for sharing this great sandwich.

Delicious!!! My fiance and I both really enjoyed these. Made a few minor changes... I didn't have green pepper so I omitted that, added some fresh  mushrooms to the meat mixture, doubled the worcestershire sauce, and used hoagie rolls. Instead of garlic powder, I used fresh garlic that I sauteed with the meat. They turned out *really* well, I'll make these again. Thank you :)

Pretty good and very easy.  I made the filling to put in pita bread.  Spiced it up a little with some cajun spice, and added a packet of dry beef gravy mix and 1 cup beef broth to make a gravy. Would put some mushrooms and maybe a can of mushroom soup in next time.

Extremely delicious.  My husband loved them and so did I.  Instead of ground beef, I used the "heat and eat" Hormel Beef Tips and Gravy and threw it in the pan where I added the sour cream in and other seasonings.  I used lots of white onion instead of green and omitted the green peppers.  Used cheddar and monteray jack cheeses.  The tomato is what makes this sandwich come to life.  AWESOME ADDITION TO MY COLLECTION.  THANKS!!!!!

I have had this in my recipe box for over a year and just got around to trying it today. 
Husband LOVED it. 
I'm a little mad at myself for having waited so long to try this. So so good. 
I also sauteed some mushrooms which complimented the flavors very nicely. 
Thank you for this recipe. It is now in our "menu rotation"!

Eh, I didn't think they were that great.  The husband really liked them though.  I didn't feel like there was enough flavor in them.  Like they were missing something.

Quick, easy, good and no "cream of" soup! The only thing I did different was to add mushrooms and I didn't have any green peppers, so I added chopped red pepper in it's place.

Good, but not super.  I would make again.  It's something different and certainly, good.  I made no changes...a fairly hearty, inexpensive sandwich.

This was just ok.  Maybe it's because my mother-in-law's stroganoff is so much better tasting.  I'll just stick with hers.  Sorry!

My family does not like green peppers, but that is the only think I left off. Very yummy!

This was a very tasteless sandwich, I did dress it up a bit by adding shredded cheese and melting a piece of cheese on the bread before eating.  After all that, it was still pretty bland.  Sorry.

it was a little plain as written, but followed some other reviewers recommendations and it is alright.  But, really, you have to have mushrooms in stroganoff!

I made this tonight and it was SOOOOOOO GOOD!  I used ground turkey instead of beef, light sour cream and left out the tomato slices because I didn't have any fresh tomatoes. Will make again

great dinner, I didn't have the bread so I used hoggie rolls and did smaller sandwhiches, but my wife and I really enjoyed it.

I really liked this meal but I think  some beef broth and mushrooms should of been added into the beef after it was cooked just to add more flavor. Overall this recipe was really great and I will probably make it again with some minor adjustments.

These sandwiches was great. While the meat was browning I added a beef bouillon cube, thick diced onions and bell peppers and fresh minced garlic. They turned out to be some of the best sandwiches I made in awhile. Thanks TWO YOUS

Good, but could use a little something more. I plan to add taco seasoning or additional spices the next time I make it.

Loved it - but changed it significantly.  I'm sure it would be delicious as written too.  I used vegetarian veggie crumbles instead of the ground beef and used about 1/2 of an au jus seasoning packet, which made it quite salty with the worcestershire and salt so next time would eliminate those or lessen the au jus.  I also sauteed the green peppers with the crubmles.  Topped with sliced tomatoes and cheddar cheese - DELICIOUS!!!
