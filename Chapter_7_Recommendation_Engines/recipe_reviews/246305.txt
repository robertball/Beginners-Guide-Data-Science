2 problems with this kind of recipe.
1-Chicken breast has little fat and doesn't get tender like pork over long cooking times.  Change out to boneless skinless thighs to solve this problem.  And no, the increase in fat doesn't change the recipe much at all.
2-Cooking everything that long makes the flavors muted and homogeneous.  I suggest reserving half of the basil, oregano and garlic for the last 45 mins of cooking and a splash (1 tsp) lime juice or vinegar to brighten the flavors.  It's not that much more of a hassle to do so for a significantly better outcome.

Chicken Cacciatore in a Slow Cooker Haiku: "Well, this was easy! Mine was done in 5 hours, smaller chicken breast?" My chicken ended up falling apart when I jabbed it at the 5 hr. mark, and my Classico sauce (I used the basic tomato basil flavor) was starting to scorch, so I had to pull this out of the slowcooker. Served over spaghetti w/ a sprinkle of Parmesan, it was a hearty and easy meal, and one that I would prepare again; however, I would be more mindful of the time.

Instead of spaghetti sauce I used a 28 oz can of San Marzano plum tomatoes with basil and crushed them. I added a small can of tomato sauce after reading the reviews. I also salted the chicken before putting it in the crock pot. The chicken was really soft.  Came out really good. Thanks for the recipe :)

Okay, we kept the ingredients (mostly) the same, but changed things up a little on this recipe, for personal preference.  Salt and peppered the chicken, dusted in flour, and browned in olive oil and butter.  Then cooked the onions, mushrooms, (red bell) pepper, and garlic until softened before adding in the sauce ingredients.  Threw in the chicken and cooked for about 40 minutes more.  Good stuff!

Really awesome! Made a few adjustments. Sorry! No green peppers and no tomato paste on hand. Added red wine, Italian seasong, Classico tomato basil sauce, frozen mushrooms. 2 large frozen chicken breasts. Cooked on high for four hours and warm the rest until I got home 8 hours later. Served over TJ's spinach fettuccini. Topped with a little mozzarella and parmesan cheese. Will make again, thank you all for the inspiration!

Being an inexperienced cook this is the kind of recipe I love (slow cooker). We are empty nesters so the recipe was more than we could eat in one meal (I should have used the portion control button). I froze the left over cacciatore and look forward to thawing and making another meal or two out of it. Having sold food most of my life I know there is no food that pleases everyone but this recipe will come very close. TRYING NEW FOODS IS HEAVENLY!

My family loved this! The chicken was so tender and juice it was incredible. Not everybody in my family likes mushrooms so I held them out and sauted them in butter and red wine.

I added fresh basil. I didn't find it bland at all. My only complaint would be the chicken was a touch dry. I would reduce the cooking time to avoid this problem.

I wanted to give this 5 stars because I love chicken cacciatore, but this was lacking the flavor profile I wanted. Good, but not great. Worth repeating to see about tweaking.

I sauteed the mushrooms, then added them to the finished dish - the mushrooms have more flavour this way.  I found the sauce too bitter from the tomato paste, so I will reduce or perhaps eliminate it the next time I make this dish.

This came out OK, but I stopped it at 4 hours. (I usually cook chicken breasts no longer than 4-5 hours  on low.) I used my homemade spaghetti sauce, which made for a nice flavor. However, the chicken itself tasted rather bland. I served it on whole wheat spaghetti.

The cooking time was off which made the chicken dry and  I had to add some water. It needed more salt. I will have to make some changes if I want to make it again.

Made as per recipe except salted the chicken as per other reviewers and went easy on red pepper flakes.  Everyone loved it, will be a regular feature.

First attempt at this recipe added and some additional seasonings based off the other reviews.  Seasoning on the sauce was great, the chicken was a bit bland.  Next time i may season the chicken for a bit to get better flavor. But overall good recipe.

I loved this recipe.  Very simple. In addition to the ingredients listed, I added two cans of diced tomatoes w chiles to chunk up the sauce somewhat. There was plenty of additional sauce remaining when we were finished eating.  We used the leftover sauce as a hearty spaghetti sauce for the next meal.

Like others, I cooked this only 5 hours. I also added a little sweetener to offset the acidity of the dish. I think the chicken breasts need just a very little salt as they are added to the slow cooker. I served this with vermicelli and apple coleslaw.

This is a perfect recipe to serve with zucchini noodles or spaghetti squash, if you are eating low carb. Adding a hot Italian sausage (or one hot and one mild, precooked and cut up) gives the flavor more zing and depth. Brown rice is also great with it. If you find chicken breasts turn out dry, I usually make this with thighs, which stay moist and have more flavor.

Made this pretty close to the directions provided. I doubled the mushroom, quickly browned the chicken before adding it to the crock pot. I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Used the large jar of Ragu (chunky tomato, garlic and onion)and it turned out beautiful. Will definitely be making this again! My husband loved it!

This is the closest I've found to my mom's recipe, which was my favorite dish growing up. 
Easy to make and makes great leftovers.   
However, I use double the mushrooms.

It was good but the chicken did come out  dry even though I listened to the others and left it on for 5 hours.
I think the time should be cut back even more.

I'm just not a fan of jarred sauces.  Although Hemisfare's (Kroger's upscale brand) Bolognase with sausage and red wine is quite good and really tastes homemade!) I usually make this dish stovetop with a whole cut up chicken, using diced tomatoes and organic sauce with my own seasonings.  I will try this in the crockpot with the Hemisfare's to make it easy on myself!

Very bland and watery, not sure why, even after the next day and adding more spices. I do like all the veggies that are included. I would probably try again using a different pasta sauce perhaps.

This turned out great. I served it with freshly shredded Parmesan over thin spaghetti noodles.
I'd definitely make it again, but I did make a few adjustments. 
First, I only cooked it on low for 5.5 hours and then kept it warm for an additional 2 hours. My slow cooker tends to run hot and the sauce was really browning on the edges. At 5.5 hours, the chicken was perfectly cooked. 
Also, I added a half teaspoon of cinnamon sugar and a half teaspoon of salt. I didn't have any red pepper flakes so I left that out. 
I doubled the amount of mushrooms.

I made too much, had it for two at home dinners, and gave two dinners to each of my italian friends. They thought it was great, maybe a little too thin, because I added red wine, not much,  but the sauce was thinner. I would definitely make it again.

I had used drumsticks instead of breasts.  I added a can of diced tomatoes (Italian-style) and held off on adding anymore basil, oregano and garlic, since my tomatoes had it in it.  Upon completion, I determined no additional spices were needed.  I topped with parmesan cheese.  This was very good!

I used Rao’s marinara sauce, added garlic and more chopped onion.  Put in italian spices, as I’m not a big fan of oregano.  The tomato paste made for a nice thick sauce!  It was delicious!!!

I made this last night, and it was delicious! I was surprised how much depth of flavor was rendered just by combining a few simple ingredients to jarred spaghetti sauce and letting it simmer. Even my picky hubby liked it. This one is definitely going in the front of my recipe binder!

This was an easy recipe. Based on other reviews I only cooked on low for 5 hours which was perfect. Next time I will sauté my fresh mushrooms to remove moisture. I used an orange pepper and I think I will do this instead of green for sweetness. I added extra basil and oregano. Loved the kick from the red pepper flakes. Need to work on the sauce texture, but flavor was good for me.

Very easy to make.  I only cooked on Low for about 5 hours per advice from others as I was afraid the chicken breasts would get dried out and tough if I left them in any longer.  They were moister than I expected.  I'm not a big veggie fan so I did feel that I tasted the peppers and mushrooms a lot but I'm sure that's the way it's meant to taste.  My husband liked it and said make it again.

I thought this recipe was yummy!  It was flavorful, and the red pepper flakes added just the right amount of zip.  I made it as written except for a couple of tiny adjustments.  My can of pasta sauce was only 24 oz., so I added an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce.  I used approx. 2 lbs. of chicken breasts, and cut them up after 5 hours.  Total cooking time was 6 hours, and the chicken was perfect, not dry at all.  I served it over spaghetti, with garlic biscuits on the side.  It was even better the next day!  I'll definitely be making this again.

Good basic recipe. As others stated, cook only 4-5 hours on low to keep the chicken from drying out. I cut the chicken into large pieces before placing them in the crockpot, and used Italian seasoning in place of oregano, since I didn't have that on hand. Could use a little salt, perhaps, but otherwise a good crock-pot recipe.

It turned out very good and I really didn't make any changes except for adding diced fresh tomato and basil from the garden. I didn't have any problems with the cooking time.

It turned out great. Only thing I will do different next time is use bone-in chicken thighs and legs. I prefer the dark meat in sauce. I will use this recipe many times! Thank you.

DID NOT like the flavor the chicken took on from the baby bellas we used. (Thanks to my son). Way too earthy and slightly fishy. I will make this again but with either jarred mushrooms or I will heat REGULAR fresh mushrooms (not bella's) then add them. I made this on my lunch break and enjoyed at dinner time. We served with a salad and angel hair pasta.

Family loved it!   Used frozen breasts; added a small can of sliced olives and 1/4 C red wine and can diced tomatoes + small can of tomato sauce to norm recipe ingreds.   Used Italian seasoning, oregano, garlic salt, celery seed, pepper to start.  After 3 hrs, rmvd meat and cut into pieces, returned to pot with chopped fresh mushrooms, diced green onions as I only had a bit of regular onion left, 1/4 of a green pepper.  Added more oregano, fresh basil & a bit of hot chili powder.  cooked about an our more and served over veggie spaghetti & parmesan.
They loved it and asked for us to have it again next week.   Was surprisinly lite meal, not overly heavy.

Made it as directed except the tomato paste,  which was a mistake,  made it watery. Very flavourful though. Will make again with paste. Very good. ..

This was really easy! I made it with 4 frozen boneless chicken breasts. Only one breast fell apart. I let it cook on low for 8 hours and then left it on warm overnight. I didn't eat it until the next day and the sauce was delicious. It was a bit runny as I didn't have any tomato paste... next time I'll make sure I add some. The only thing I would like to improve is the chicken itself seemed a bit bland. I added fresh ground pepper and Parmesan cheese and served it over spaghettini! I'll for sure make this again!

I did a double batch of this recipe.  I cooked it for 5 hours.  The chicken was really moist and tender.  The second day it was even better.  The only thing extra that I added was salt.  Will be making it again when my company comes in two weeks.

If your chicken is too dry, then it was cooked too long. I only used 3 breasts and turned it on high for 1 hour then 3 hours on low. Halfway through cooking, I cut them in half and they were tinder at that time. I did not have mushrooms or onion on hand. I put more garlic in, but I kept the other measurements the same. The chicken was juicy and with good flavor.

This is delicious and my family loved it. I will definitely make it again. The only item I am made it in the recipe is the mushrooms since my family does not like them. The chicken was so tender it practically fell apart and could be cut with a fork. The sauce was very tasty

I made it pretty much as specified, except I used spicy pasta sauce (Classico brand) and an extra chicken breast, and my family loved it. I cooked it about 7 hours total (6 on low, one on high) and it was great!

This was delicious! Crowd pleasure with people going in for second helpings!! Reading the other posts I decided to cut the time in cooking the chicken. I cooked it for 5.5hrs and pulled the chicken out. It fell off the fork! Then I added another can of tomato paste as the sauce was too runny and cooked that on high for 20-30min. Thickened it up perfectly. I also added twice the amount of mushrooms.

I made this with chicken thighs instead (approx 1.5 - 2 lbs) and - except for the mushrooms - followed the recipe as is. It was done perfectly at 6 hours. My family loved it!

I followed the recipe fairly closer but since I didn’t have tomato paste, I didn’t use it.  Also, I used a can of chopped tomatoes along with a leftover jar of sauce I had in the fridge.  Because I wanted more veggies, I chopped up two zucchinis, salted and let drain for some time and added during the last hour.  I took the chicken out a bit early and shredded it, returned it to the slow cooker to warm back up.  It made a wonderful “stew” to have with crusty bread rather than pasta.

Turned out very well for me despite some of the rather negative reviews.  I increased the spices, as I usually do, added one can of tomato sauce and cooked one hour less.  Also added salt and sugar to cut the tart tomato sauce base.  I will definitely use again.

I added additional mushrooms, more oregano &  basil.

It was much better the next day.

Make it a day or 2 before you intend to serve.

I will make it again

I found this recipe tasty using chicken thighs instead.  Make lots of sauce, though, and I should have added 3-4 lbs of meat instead of 2, and cooked it less time.  The meat literally fell apart after 6 hours of cooking.  Perhaps thicker breasts would require the longer cooking time.

I read the reviews and made a few changes - I added two whole peppers, 1/2 cup of red wine, 1/2 cup of chicken broth, one whole onion, 4 cloves of garlic, a 28 can of tomatoes and a can of tomato paste.  I cooked it on low for 3 hours.  The sauce tasted delicious, but the chicken was dry.

I used eight tenders instead of the four breasts because that's was what I had on hand.   Since I don't care for spicy hot, I used  crushed Aleppo pepper in place of red pepper flakes.  It turned out very nicely.  The husband said I could make this anytime and he tends to be fussy.  So I tried it again, this time using sweet Italian sausage instead of chicken (browned the sausage before adding).   This also was very good.

I made it exactly according to the recipe and didn't care for it at all.  Sauce was way too thin and not flavorful. I'll try boiling down the sauce and adding salt and maybe a bit of red wine to save what's left (most of it; I live alone). Will not make again.

I love chicken cacciatore so I was very excited when the recipe popped up for a slow cooker. I made it exactly as recipe said but it is too dry and way to thick. If I try it again I will not include the tomato paste but will try with canned tomatoes instead.

Made as directed with boneless, skinless, thighs and after tasting I did find it a bit bland .  I added about 2 tsp salt, another 1/2 tsp oregano, basil, and pepper.  It still was missing something so I added 2 tsp sugar and WOW .....perfect for our taste!  The chicken was at the shredding stage and served over angle hair pasta, is was a huge hit.  This is a keeper!

This was great! Easy to make and flavorful. I omitted the tomato paste and add a can of diced tomatoes drained. I also added a half cup of red wine, one Tsp of sugar, 2 Tsp of butter and cooked for 5 hrs.  on low, chicken was very tender and the veggies were not undercooked, also added 6 cloves of garlic. I will make this again for sure!!!

This is very good but I added  Tabasco & cayenne pepper and than  might be bit spicey with 1/2 tsp pepper-  new sauce might have been spicey. Next time adding 1/4 black pepper . We let 4 large chick breasts cook 4 hours on high  than added garlic and more fresh basil .chicken still in big chunks about 4 -6 pieces per piece

I used a whole cut up chicken and two more chicken breasts cut in half to add flavor and variety for the meat. I used 2 teaspoons of herbs de providence for the spices (oregano tends to be a bit bitter unless complemented with other spices) Cannot go wrong with adding more sweet basil). Added a can of chopped stewed tomatoes because of the added meat. 4 hours of crock pot time should be plenty of time to meld this meal. Finally, don't skimp on the pepper flakes, this is what gives this dish its signature kick.

I’ve made this recipe at least 5x and it’s delicious! I use marinara, omit mushrooms, and double the bell pepper. Cook the chicken for a shorter time to keep it in tact. My husband and I prefer to let the chicken cook longer then shred it into the sauce. It’s beyond delicious!

Made this as described in the recipe. As for my tastes. The next time I make this I plan on using a bit more seasonings.   And a different pasta sauce, and add more tomato paste to it. 
But like any recipe. This gives you a great base to start and modify with.

Used the exact ingredients and methodologly, including the suggested spaghetti sauce. Turned out dark, maybe overcooked, after 6 hours on low. Way too much garlic. I would consider using only the sauce, onion, mushrooms, and bell pepper.

This was simple and delicious. Only thing I changed was I sautéed the veggies on my slow cooker’s sauté setting first then added everything else and cooked on low for 5 hours. Came out perfect. I served over thin spaghetti and topped with Parmesan cheese. I used a high quality spaghetti sauce which I’m sure improved the flavor.

This was absolutely delicious!  My husband and I loved it.  Amazing sauce, super easy to prepare, what more can you ask for!  Served this with roasted broccoli and Italian bread using a bread machine (both recipes from this site).  Left out the mushrooms as we’re not fans, but put extra bell pepper and onion in.  Can’t wait to make this again!

Delicious - I normally substitute boneless chicken thighs for the breasts because they are much more tender and juicy.

I didn't have tomato paste so I left that out and I had a mix of red, green, & yellow frozen peppers that I used,  other than that I followed the recipe and it was delicious! I served over linguine the first meal and just had it with garlic bread the next meal, will make again soon.

Made this with some tweets, S&P chicken and used tenders instead of breast ( bought the wrong thing) pan seared in grape seed oil. Sautéed chopped onion and added chopped garlic on top then added salt. Let that saute, then added green and red pepper chopped ( rough chop on everything) and added more salt. Placed chicken in the bottom of crock pot then added sautéed veg, added sliced mushroom some chicken stock, some rosè wine (what I had on the fridge) and no measurements on the liquids. A can of diced organic tomatoes, and small can of San Marzano tomatoes. Added all herbs listed and 8 sprigs of fresh rosemary. 1 teaspoon of capers and 1 teaspoon of caper juice. Cooked on high for 3 hours. Still needed a bit more salt at the end and had it over white rice.

It turned out pretty well. I will add mushrooms and not use frozen chicken breasts.  I think it would be good with legs and thighs.  It only took 4 hours in the slow cooker.

YUM!  This was SO good!  I served it over angel hair pasta.  Didn't modify the recipe much.  I seasoned the chicken first (garlic powder, salt, pepper, paprika, onion powder) and then dumped everything else in (mushrooms, red bell pepper, onion)  The last 45 minutes or so I added zuchinni squash.  This was delicious!

The family seemed to like it, but I thought something was missing - like salt.  I used only the ingredients in the list.  Didn't have that particular marinara sauce, but one  similar to it.  Did add more green pepper because I had a frozen bag of it and it's hard to tell how much 1/2 pepper would be.  Think I added too much.  So, maybe with some salt and fewer green peppers it would be fine.  I'll try it again sometime WITH the correct marinara and a real pepper.

I chose to make this because the slow cooker does not heat up the whole kitchen like the oven or stove top does. I followed the recipe but substituted chicken bottom quarters, which we prefer, for the chicken breasts. I used Barilla spaghetti sauce with basil instead of adding basil. The results were excellent and I expect to make it again.

I switched it up a bit.  After reading the reviews of others, I added a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes and a bit more mushrooms.   I used three thick skinless chicken breasts.  Next time, I will use breasts with skin on them and brown them before placing them in the slow cooker.  We found the chicken to be a bit dry.  That is the reason I didn't give the recipe another star.   I cooked it on medium for 60 minutes and then switched to low heat.  It was done in four hours.

I BROWN CHICKEN THIGHS IN OVEN, AS PER SON, MICHAEL, THE CHEF AT WHOLE  FOODS - IT GIVES CHICKEN MUCH MORE FLAvor than just putting pieces, as is,  in croc pot.
I also had some wine and a tablespoon sugar - helps cut tomato acid for any sensitive tummys.

Easy ...  First time to put frozen meat into crock pot and it cooked just fine.
I did not use tomato paste as I like it juicy and it was just fine; also did not have any mushroom but think will use next time I try this recipe. It was very tasty--I will make again.
