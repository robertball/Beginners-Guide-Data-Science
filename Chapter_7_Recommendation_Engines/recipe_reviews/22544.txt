This recipe is fantastic - Never make the Karo Syrup recipe again!  I'm disappointed I didn't have this recipe years ago - it is infinately better than the standard corn syrup recipes, and just as easy.  This recipe tastes more like real pie, instead of like candy.  I also recommend using Mrs Smith's deep dish pie crusts instead of the cheaper lard crusts - it bakes better.  Warm the eggs to room temp before making this recipe - will keep the butter from clumping when you add it to the eggs.

My husband and I run a restaurant and we have used this recipe as one of our desserts.  Our customers always rave about it!  The only thing I do differently is that I reduce the temperature of the oven to about 300 and cook it longer, until it starts to crack on the top.  This way it does not get over browned on the top.  A great recipe!

I tried this recipe twice and got a different result each time. Third time is a charm, right? Unfortunately not. Then I brightened up and decided to read reviews. What I was experiencing was written in every negative review I read.

First let me say that the taste of this pie is absolutely phenomenal!! A little sweet, yes, but great! My issue is with the unappetizing souffle-type top and that the filling really doesn't fill my dish, leaving a big gap between crust and filling, making my crust crumble down into the pie. Not pretty. But notice the serving calculator underneath the recipe? Problem solved. 

Everything else I would follow to a "T" except that I would decrease baking temp to 300 degrees and bake 45 mins.Anyone that knows anything about pretty pies knows that if your crust goes, then forget the pie! This temp has burnt my crust each time, even with my crust sleeve on it--SO frustrating. The other change would be to add another 1/2 cup of pecans AFTER the filling is in the shell. That way you'll still have a nice appearance on the top of the pie. 

One thing that some mentioned was that this pie is dry-----this pie----let me repeat----this pie IS NOT DRY! You get somewhat of a crust on top from the souffle-style filling, but underneath that is rich ooey-gooey goodness!!

I was hesitant to try this recipe when I noticed corn syrup was not listed as an ingredient.  Well, I tried the recipe & the pie was awesome! I mixed sugars & butter well with a portable mixer while butter was hot, to eliminate a grainy texture, added 1/2 c choco. chips, 1/4 c additional 
pecans, then baked for 10 mins @ 400, reduce oven temp to 350 baked for 20 additional mins, reduce oven temp to 325 & bake an additional 10 mins until middle of pie settled. I reduced baking temp to eliminate burning the pie before it was done.  However it was worth the adjustments. It was magnificent! Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I enjoyed this version of pecan pie very much.  I lowered the calorie count even more by using 3/4C brown sugar and 1/2 C Splenda, and I used heart healthy margarine instead of butter.  Best eaten warm.  I am a traditional cook in pecan country and was skeptical until I tried it.  I had given up making pecan pies because of the high calorie and saturated fat counts so I am thrilled to have this recipe.

Great recipe! To summarize the advice I took from the previous reviews: - Heat butter just until melted, too hot could cook the egg - Preheat oven to 350 deg. F, and place pie in oven for 10 minutes. - Remove pie from oven and turn temp. down to 300 deg. F, place halved pecans on top for a more appealing pie. - Bake at 300 for 50 minutes longer or until the pie is puffed and set. Pie received strong approval from a Charleston, SC, native, pecan pie connoisseur.

A Godsend for my diabetic wife. Pecan pie is her favorite desert, and she will only occasionally cheat on her diet to have a slice of the traditional pie;  but substituting Splenda for sugar, she can (and probably will) have this whenever she wants it.

So easy to make, too!

Very good, but still too sweet. This is plenty sweet with just 1 cup of brown sugar, cut out the white completely. I used 2 tablespoons flour instead of one to have a thicker consistency since there is no corn syrup. This also helps the pie slice better.  I added 1.5 cups of chopped pecans plus a layer of whole pecans on top. I followed tip of baking 10 min/400 degrees, 20 min/350 degrees, 20 min./325 degrees (tip worked great). Pie is done when it slightly cracks on top.  I used 'Basic Flaky Pie Crust' froom this site for the crust.  I will definitely make again but with less sugar.

I'll never make pecan pie with corn syrup again!  This recipe doesn't have that sickening sweetness usually associated with pecan pie, but it DOES have that scrumptious nuttiness.  Thank you, Elaine Helms.

I love this recipe.  I have been making it for a couple years now.  Instead of making it as one whole pie, I usually use the refrig pie crust and roll it out thinner, use a biscuit cutter and cut a bunch of small crust out of it, put the crust in a cup cake pan, and fill those about 1/2 full with the filling.  Bake at 350 for 25 min.  It makes about 2 dozen little pecan pies and that way you have way more to go around.

Delicious! I was so happy that my first ever pecan pie came out great thanks to this recipe. As another reviewer said, I got a little confused about the oven temp (pre-heated it to 350 but it says to cook it at 400 for the first ten minutes), so I don't know if my oven temp was perfect, but the pie still came out great! Just preheat your oven to 400 and then turn it down to 350 after 10 minutes of baking. I highly recommend this recipe.

WOW! I can't believe it had no syrup and it tasted fabulous. I even added semi-sweet mini chocolate morsels. The center was nice and thick and the pecans on top were not fused together as they are when a "regular" pecan pie cools down. Great texture! Won't be needing the Karo anymore.

This is definitely a winner and so easy to make. I've made this exactly as written as well as my own version with couple adjustments. I highly recommend considering suggested tips: toast the CHOPPED pecans for about 12-15 minutes in a 350 preheated oven. It completely changes the pie from delicious to orgasmic. It enhances the flavor of the pecans and adds a better texture. Leave the top pecans as is though because it will toast automatically when baking. Use a 9 inch deep dish crust instead and bake for 15 minutes at 300 and then 300 for 50 minutes  It's only a tad bit more effort, but definitely goes a long way. Love this recipe!

I've tried this 3 times now, and this is what I've discovered...  
A. It tastes awesome no matter what you do! 
B. The more you whip the eggs, the less it looks like traditional pecan pie. 
C. I like the texture better when I added an extra 1/2 cup of pecans (1 1/2 total). 
D. I like it best without the white sugar... I just left it out and didn't miss it at all!
E. Definitely take it out before you think it's done...  it continues to cook, and the one I thought I cooked perfectly came out very dry. 
F. Definitely turned out best for me when cooking at 350 for 10 minutes then 300 for 40 minutes.
G. A little Amaretto in the whipped cream added even more to the DELICIOUS flavor of the pie!! (-:

Oh, and to answer someone's question about the crust, don't cook it first.

This pie was delicious and very easy to make (the hardest part was waiting to eat it). I love that it's not made with corn syrup because it seems more natural and I generally have brown sugar on hand. One important note is that the pie has to chill for a long time to firm up. Two hours later it was still pretty liquid, it wasn't until it sat overnight that it was the proper consistency. This was my first pecan pie so I don't know if that's common sense to everyone else, but I was surprised, especially since no one mentioned it. I thought I'd ruined the pie until I googled it and realized it needed more time.

First, let me tell you about my husband.  He does not like change.  When he likes a recipe, he loves it and only wants THAT particular recipe.  So, when he asked for a pecan pie and I told him I was trying a new recipe without the Karo he was shocked-  "pecan pie made without Karo?  You know I love your pecan pie."   When it came out of the oven, we both looked at the pie.  That did not look like pecan pie, there wasn't the traditional pecan topping.  He tried it and surprise, surprise, he loved it!  In fact, he said that he liked it BETTER than the Karo recipe!   We used, please don't mock me, a refrigerated pie crust (I know, I know) and baked the entire pie at 350 for 45 minutes.  The crust was a bit darker than I would have liked, but it was not burnt (just a nice George Hammilton brown).   The next time we make this recipe, I'll be making the following changes:  1- I'll flour the top and bottom of the pie crust, prior to putting it into the pie pan (this will help the bottom of the crust from getting soggy (our first attempt stuck to the pan).  2- I'll add powdered sugar after it cools (to make the top look pretty)  3- I'll bake at 350 for 10 minutes, then 300 for another 40-50 minutes- or until the outside is set and the middle slightly jiggles.  4- allow to set OVERNIGHT.   Great recipe!  I still have two bottles of Karo syrup, does anyone want them?

I don't like pecan pie at all because of the extreme sweetness of the store bought variety (hurts my teeth!), and my husband loves it.  I tried this recipe on a whim one night (exactly as written), and it is SO wonderful, so tasty, so perfectly the right texture and sweetness, that I am now in love with pecan pie!  I've made this recipe 3 times with no changes, and it comes out amazing.  The omission of corn syrup must help the sweetness level become normal, because the flavor is delicious.  Please try the recipe; it's even extremely simply to make/throw together while working on a weeknight dinner after a full working day (and that's no easy feat).  You will thank your lucky stars.

This was ridiculously good.  I didn't use any white sugar, cut the light brown sugar down to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup maple syrup and used 1/2 cup more pecans than the recipe asked for.  I desparately wanted more than one piece, had to use superhuman self control! Everyone loved it, it will be gone by tomorrow!

I was disappointed with this recipe. It tasted like pecan pie, but had a very odd look to it. It didn't have the crusty, delicious, brown top, but almost looked like a brown foamy layer. Needless to say, I was disappointed. I covered it up with some homemade whipped cream, but I won't make it again.

All of those positive reviews and the overall rating made me think this would be a good pie. 
All I can figure is that those people who actually rated this recipe high either don't know what a traditional pecan pie should taste like or they're just so opposed to the Karo recipe that the think this is the ONLY and/or BEST option.
To each their own.  
If you decide you're going to make this recipe, add the decorative pecans before you bake the pie.
I
IMPROVEMENTS MADE:  Eliminate white sugar, reduce brown sugar by 1/4 cup and add 1/4 cup pure maple syrup.  Increase pecans by 1/2 cup, crushing the additional pecans.
Also used Almond milk since that's what I had on hand.  Didn't think it would alter the taste or baking since it was such a small amount.
Personal enhancements:  First pie - 2 Tbs Jim Beam Bakers Small Batch Kentucky Bourbon 107 proof.  Second pie - 3 Tbs of same Bourbon.  That pie is MINE.  :-D
Changed oven temp to 350 degrees for first 10 minutes and reduced temperature to 300 degrees for 50 additional minutes.  
Pies came out looking beautiful.  Crust nicely golden and top looks perfect.  Could have baked them 10-15 minutes less and they probably would have been better.
I actually like the consistency of the Karo syrup type of pecan pies -it's just what I'm used to.  This pie was just more like a brown sugar (cake like?) consistency.  The picture provided by Redponygirl will give you a fair idea what the texture inside is like.

OK, I have not made a pecan pie for over 15 years, because the pecan pie I made years ago was a total diaster (with Karo syrup).  I tried this recipe and it was THE BEST!  Next time I will try the recipe using dark brown sugar and an extra 1/2 cujp of pecans.  Thank you for the recipe!  UPDATE:  I made another pecan pie today.  This time I used dark brown sugar (instead of light) and an extra 1/2 cup of chopped pecans...PERFECT!

This is the recipe I have used for years as a professional pastry chef.  I often add chocolate chunks for Chocolate Pecan Pie, yum!  This recipe has made converts of people who otherwise would not eat pecan pie with corn syrup.  Simply delicious, the easiest to make.  If you're looking for a recipe to be "your pecan pie" recipe, this is it.  A note, be careful not to overbake this pie.

This was almost the answer to my diebetic dreams! I made this with Splenda products and it was satisfying and rich. Be sure, however that you are aware that it still contains sugar if using the Splenda blends. You should not rush this pie. Make it so it has enough time to completely cool. I started mine to bake at 350 then backed off to 300 after 10 minutes. Although my oven has a convection setting, I did not use it for this recipe; that would make a difference. I will most certainly make this pie again. My husband and dinner guest enjoyed it. It was fast and easy to make. The tip about making sure the eggs aren't cooked by the melted butter is important.

I was never a fan of pecan pie until I tried this recipe. I love that it doesn't have the sticky gummy consistency of most pecan pies. After the pie has cooled a bit I melt about 20 caramels with 3 tablespoons heavy cream. I add 1/4 cup chopped pecans and spread the mixture over the top of the whole pie. It is awesome.

This is the most simple dessert to make ever.... And sooooo good... Baked it at 350 for 10 minutes, then 300 degrees for an hour.... Delicious... Lower temp for a bit longer time, is better....
To make it look more appealing... After 20 minutes taking it out the oven.... I made a chocolate glaze... Very simple... Melted 3 tbsp butter,  1/2 cup chocolate chips, added 1 tsp vanilla... brushed it on top of pecan pie, added more pecans, and wow... It looks like a pie from a 5 star restaurant... Just added whip cream when I served... And my bf was like... This is simply amazing... And I know I did a great job, if he tells me that he will bring it to work the next day.... Thanks so much for the simple yet absolutely Devine recipe....

Really a nummy pie !  My only recommendations/changes:  When I put the filling into the crust, it only filled it half way.  So I mixed up another 1/2 c brown sugar, 4 tbs white sugar, 1 egg, 1/2 tbs flour, 1/2 tbs milk, 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 more pecans.  It filled the 'shell' perfectly and looked amazing. I followed the other suggestions of lowering the heat: 10 minutes at 350, then 40 minutes at 300...just til small cracks appeared in the surface.  My family really LOVED this Pecan Pie !!

WOW! I've grown up eating Pecan Pie made with Karo syrup - what a difference.  It actually tastes homemade.    The only change I made was to the temp. As recommended by others, start for 15 minutes at 350 and bring down to 300 for 55 minutes.  The pie was the best looking Pecan Pie I had ever made. There was the slightest giggle but nothing that resting on the counter wouldn't fix. I've made several Pecan Pies and have to say this temperature is a sure way to have a great pie. Good luck and enjoy!

I didn't bring my recipes with me when I moved to China and was looking for a recipe as close to mine as possible and this is it.  We HATE pecan pies that use any type of syrup (too sicky-sweet)and this recipe is perfect for us.  I have diabetes, so used Splenda. I am from the south, and this is how the older women in my family made their pecan pies.

WOW!! So glad I tried this - for once, I didn't tweak a thing, and this was perfect! (I have to say the directions threw me briefly - it says to preheat the oven to 350, but you'll notice you cook it at 400 degrees the first 10 minutes. Simple to fix - just read the recipe through, as I almost flubbed on!) This will be my pecan pie recipe from now on (my dad LOVED it, and hubby went back for a 2nd piece, which never happens!)- thanks!

I used this recipe because it received such high reviews. And I am so disappointed.  I followed recipe using some reviewers’ suggestions to add eggs that are at room temp and mix sugars with hot butter before incorporating other ingredients.  As well I added 1 ½ cups pecans vs 1 cup pecans.  The pie didn’t completely set in the center and the texture is very grainy.  The appearance isn’t very appealing either. Good pecans are expensive and I don’t want someone else to waste their money as I did.

I am a huge fan of pecan pie and looked forward to creating a different version. THIS is my new recipe!  I did not mention to anyone in my family that I was using a different recipe. However, everyone, especially my husband, raved about how much better this pie was. This recipe has wonderful flavor without all of the excess sweetness that corn syrup brings.  You won't be disappointed!  Thanks, Elaine, for a wonderful recipe!

Like another reviewer said, this pie did not hurt my teeth!  Mine did NOT turn out gritty in the least as others said.  I added 1/2 cup white chocolate chips, and a few Whole Pecans which I placed on the top to make it look pretty.  Easy and wonderful!  My pecan pie of choice from now on!  The whole family loved it, disappeared quickly.

Delicious and sooo easy!  I loved that it didn't have the traditional super syrupy texture.  I did think it was still a tad too sweet but definitely a keeper.
Adjustments:
I lightly roasted the pecans prior to chopping them.  Chopped them large and added 1 1/2 cups instead of just 1.
Left out the white sugar altogether and will probably still cut the brown sugar in subsequent pies.  
Baked it at 400 for 10 minutes then 45 at 300 rather than 350, turned out great.  I love the contrast of the nice crunchy top and chewy bottom layer.

I followed the recipe to a T and it was not moist, but very dry.  The filling did not hold up well at all and I was the only one to have a piece - no one else at the Christmas feast even touched it.  It was very unappetizing looking.  I didn't expect it to come out so bad.  I was really disappointed, especially after reading all the rave reviews.  Maybe there's a reason why it's better to use corn syrup than sugar.  With corn syrup, you get moisture, which is what this pie needed.

Delicious pecan pie that will change your idea of what "GREAT" pecan pie should be. No more yucky corn syrup pie ever again. This is sooo much better. Prebaked my pie shell for 7-8 minutes before filling and added about 1/2 cup more pecan halves to the top of the pie before baking. So EZ. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream. Thanks for the wonderful recipe. FYI - If you don't have time to make your own pie crust ... I've found that the Marie Callender's frozen pie shells are very good and bake up nice and flaky. Altho I usually go to the trouble of rerolling them and using my own glass pan ... no soggy bottom and company thinks it is homemade! My secret!

WOW. My husband is a pecan pie addict. He loved it. Whole family devoured it in minutes. Had to make another one. I did change cook time to 55-60 minutes on 300 degree oven. Never checked pie. Took it out of oven after 58 minutes. I also added 1/2 cup more pecans. Fabulous recipe.

Very good recipe...although if I were to rate it on the day I baked it, I would give it 3 stars.  It just seemed overly sweet to me, but the next day, it was definitely 5 stars.  I guess the flavor needed time to mellow out a bit.  So, prepare this pie the day before you intend to slice into it...you will not be sorry!  Another thing I did was follow the directions for oven temp and time, but I found that the filling was perhaps a tad too dry.  I will follow other reviewers' suggestion and bake for 10 minutes at 350 and then 40-55 minutes at 300.

Yuck!  This pie never set for me and I followed the directions exactly.  My top wanted to burn and after cooking it for the 40 minutes, it was no where close to setting.  So I kept cooking it at 10 minute intervels, and after an HOUR longer....I just gave up and dumped it in the trash.I have a temp gage in my oven, so I know it was running true to temp., so....maybe you'll have better luck.  I'll stick with the tried and true.

OH MY GOD!!! This was sooo good. I am the pecan pie maker in the family and always get rave reviews for it. Was wanting to try something new and with all the great reviews this had ,I had to try it. So last night at 8 pm I went for it,and boy am I glad I did. Hubby and I were laughing and joking about the outcome, finally cooked and cooled and at 10 pm we finally cut into it,and both of us were saying what I started the review with OH MY GOD,lol. Hubby agrees with other reviewer it tastes even better in the morning. We followed it to the T and it is perfect,no graininess,no crunchy sugar bits,curious if the reviewer left some lumpy hard brown sugar in theirs,that would cause a crunch,lol. Anyway TRY IT!! is all I can say,you wont be dissappointed!

A fantastic, easy-to-make recipe.  I first used a ready-made pie crust; then I used the suggestions from other reviewers of 1/2 C. Splenda and 3/4 C. brown sugar, 1 1/4 C. of pecans, and baked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes and then 300 degrees for 55 minutes.  It came out perfect.  My husband loved it so much he wants me to make another right away!

This recipe is great I have made it a few times and I am a real pecan lover. The first time I made it I added double the pecans....don't do this or it turns out really dry. The second time I chose not to chop the pecans and kept them whole laid on top of the pie and it was exactly what I was looking for. This recipe is nice because you don't have that sickeningly sweet taste left over nor do you feel like your shaking for the sugars. I do recommend making it a day ahead of time which give it a day to or evening to set up better.

OH WOW! I made a proper Pecan Pie!! I have tried many recipes and none have turned out like this.  I have substituted Dark Corn Syrup for all kinds of syrups and nothing turned out well (I can't find Corn Syrup here in Australia).  This is an awesome recipe and I will be using it as my desert choice when I have my next dinner party :-)

Okay. I just posted about 6 days ago stating I was making this for a potluck at work, which was today. EVERYONE LOVED IT!!!! I got tons of emails praising me for bringing such a wonderful dessert and begging for the recipe. Many requested pecan pies as Christmas gifts and others offered to pay me to bake more. People who didn't even work in my department heard about it and came by to try it. I've made it numerous times for my family who loves it but my coworkers went crazy offer it.  Awesome recipe!

Oh......My ......Lord!    This came out so good!  It is just like traditional pecan pie without the sickly sweet factor.  I did use ready-made pie crust and altered the Temp/cook time.  350 for 15 mins, then 300 for 45 mins.  Perfection!

1st time I've ever tasted/or made pecan pie.  This is a quick, simple, delicious recipe!  Would recommend to anyone & plan on making & taking it to our next family get together. I followed recipe exactly as written.

I just went through my recipe box and tossed out all my Karo based pecan pie recipes because I haven't used them since I discovered this recipe.  Perfect, just like it is.  (I use the "no roll pie crust I" recipe with it.)  Easy as pie!

I am surprised by all of the gleamingly positive reviews of this recipe. I am a southern gal born and bred in the middle of a pecan orchard and this is not a traditional pecan pie.  The filling bakes too dry and firm--it isn't soft and runny like a classic pecan pie.  And I did not overbake the pie.  The top of the pie is foamy and crunchy.  While this may be fine if you want a pie or tart made with pecans, don't expect it to satisfy your cravings for the pecan pie like your grandmother made.  Look at the photos posted of this recipe and you will see that most of them look dry in the middle.  I will definitely return to the recipe that uses corn syrup for the filling.

This pie has been a huge hit and everyone who has tasted it asked me to please bake another.  I salt the pecans and roast them for a few minutes before adding to the pie, and adjust the baking temperature a bit so it's not too brown on top.

This is FANTASTIC.  I read the rest of the reviews and the slight changes I made were: 1) toasted the pecans ahead of time (350 degrees for 9 minutes), 2) add shelled pecans on the top, and 4) baked at 350 for 15 minutes and then reduced to 300 for 50 minutes.

absolutly amazingly good! :D just 2 things to say: 1. thanks VM for sending me pecans!! and 2. the calorie count doesnt include the crust because it isnt in the ingredient list! so for 1 piece of pie its like 500 calories lol (if you cut it in 8 pieces).. its really good though, a small piece goes a looong way! :)

My family loved the pie. ( even those that aren't nut eaters) I cooked as directed expect I did lower temp as others suggested to 300 degree F. for about 55 minutes (took it out when I saw the top cracking). I included a picture.

Wonderful! made this on Thanksgiving day, 45 min. before dinner and it was so easy.  Made it as the recipe says but only add 2 tbspn. of white sugar, and still sweet enough.  Even my mother-in-law, who has made the same pecan pie for over 30 years said this one was the best one she ever had.
Take other review and baked it at 300º for 60 min. and turned out perfect.

This pecan pie was easy to make and so yummy to eat!  It also filled my home with a delightful aroma as it baked in the oven!

This is one to prepare just prior to having guests arrive if you want a warm welcome when they walk through your door!

Really good. But very sweet.  Next time I think ill cut the sugar a little.  Even though pecans are kind of expensive I think at least one and a half cups is better.  Also, the pecans dont rise all the way to the top with this recipe so if you want to have pecans on the top, just throw them on their before putting it in the oven.  But overall very tasty, I made two for thanksgiving and one was gone before we even ate.

I am not known for my cooking skills, and I also messed up on the 400 degrees for 10 minutes, but it still turned out great. Mine looked a little different than your typical pecan pie (no pecans visible on top), but I probably didn't do something just right.  The taste was excellent.

My mom and I have tried several pecan pie recipes and have always ended up with a sticky, gooey mess.  This recipe comes out perfect every time I make it.  The pie sets up beautifully and it's not super-sugary like those made with corn syrup.

I am so glad I found a recipe for Pecan Pie that does not use corn syrup.  This and a no bake chocolate pie were the dessert hits of this year's Thanksgiving!

This was delish! I made this for Thanksgiving dinner.  I love the traditional flavor of pecan pie, but not too much of the thick ooey-gooey center.  This pie was perfect for me! I did follow the other suggestions to cook at 350 for 15 mins then 300 for 50-55mins.  I also added the sugars to the butter while it was hot to prevent a grainy texture. I did alter the recipe a bit due to ingredients I had on hand: I used dark brown sugar, buttermilk and a regular pilsbury ready-made crust.  I added an extra tbs of flour and a total of 1.5cups pecans in the batter.  I also sprinkled 1/2 cup of chopped pecans on top for a more traditional look(definitely toast the pecans). I refrigerated the pie before serving also.  This is a keeper! Thanks Elaine!

My whole Family LOVES this pie.  We tried several pies in order to choose the best tasting one.  Evn had friends over to help make the decision.  We made these pies as Christmas presents last year and this is now the only Pecan Pie I will make.  How wonderful that the best tasting one,  is also the easiest and uses ingredients I always have (I only used to buy corn syrup for pecan pies).  I love that I can make one whenever I want. Thank you so very much Elaine!!!!

First ever pecan pie, because i don't like the sweetness -- i LOVE this -- i used dark instead of light brown sugar, 1/2 cup extra pecans, and a sprinkling of cinnamon-sugar over the top VERY lightly ... mmmmmmm!!!

Absolutely delicious! I am so glad I found this recipe because I don't like putting corn syrup in anthing. This pie was top notch in flavor and consistancy. I followed the prior reviews of doing 350 degrees for 10 minutes and then 300 degrees for 55 minutes. Turned out perfectly. Not too sweet, good nutty flavor, held together great (not runny). I sub'd a tbsp of bourbon whiskey for the 1 tbsp on milk... great decision on my part. My husband and I had trouble just having 1 piece!

awesome!  i doubled the recipe and made two.  good thing i did!  i have never made a pecan pie before and i now have no reason to try any other receipe, this one is perfect!  i did use the deep dish pie crust, and i did cut the temp to 350 for first 15 minutes and then 300 for 50 minutes.  when i took it out i wasn't sure because it didn't look like my vision of a pecan pie in my head - but OMG, it tastes sooooooo good, and that's exactly what counts!  and as it has cooled it has gotten even better!!!

Delicious! Easy!  Keep an eye on it as it bakes. If the top starts cracking, it's done! I put a few pecans on top as the photos showed (but not in the directions) and next time I will put more on to cover the top, they were toasty, crisp and delicious!

I've been on a quest for the perfect pecan pie recipe.  I've tried about 6, and I have finally found the perfect one!  It has the perfect about sweetness. Its not cloying like a lot of pecan pies.  I also love the fact that I don't need corn syrup.  I never use it for anything else and just end up throwing the rest away.  This will definitely be my go to recipe from now on.

AMAZING !!! For another recipe I put the white sugar in my Cuisinart to make it fine. I used that sugar, not a hint of grit. Baked at 400 for 10 min & lowered to 330 for the remainder of the time. YUM

I decided to give this recipe a whirl. I was a little afraid because I've never made pecan pie without corn syrup before and pecan pie is my favorite! Well let me tell you I will NEVER go back to corn syrup pies again. This recipe was absolutely amazing!!! I made it yesterday for our Thanksgiving dinner. I couldn't wait till Thursday so I sliced a small piece to taste and it was sooo delicious. Not sickening sweet, just sweet enough with a nice buttery flavor as well. I did add a handful more pecans because I love them so much and placed some whole ones on top. But other than that I didn't change a thing. This is now my new pecan pie recipe! Thank you so much! I will probably have to make another one because I don't think this one will last till Thursday's dinner. lol.

This was absolutely fantastic!  I made this at the last minute for Christmas (used this recipe because I didn't have corn syrup for the usual recipe I make).  I will never use the corn syrup again.  Even my 60 yr old dad who has been eating the same pecan pie recipe his entire life LOVED this!!  This is our new family recipe!  Like another reader, don't worry about the top getting dark.  It looks like it is burning but it is not.

Very good!  More "buttery" than the corn syrup kind and not as sweet.  I followed the recipe except for using double the pecans (with whole ones on top for presentation) and it turned out beautifully.  It was not grainy like another reviewer said.  Nice recipe to have on hand when I don't have corn syrup on the shelf.

This pie turned out great- I'm normally not a big pecan pie fan but my husband loves it, and I even liked this recipe.  I doubled the filling to fill a 10" pie.

Oct.25/08....Still as awesome!!  **Update--This is still the best pecan pie around.  Yes the top isn't the nicest to look at, but, nevermind that.  It's the FLAVOR of it that is to die for**  If I could give this ten stars, I would.  I never have corn syrup, so this works perfectly.  This tastes amazing!!  The chp nuts are definitely better.  Super easy, I use my hand blender for the eggs, and butter mixing.  Makes it nice and fluffy.  I use the brick margarine, and you'd never know the difference.  A must for dessert!!!  Thanks Elaine.
***Update***
This is still by far the best tasting pecan pie I have ever had.  I get asked all the time by friends and family to make this.  This is the best!!!

WOW!  Very easy to prepare and delicious!  This pie is nice and sweet but not overly sweet.  I followed the previous baking recommendation of 10min@400, 20min@350 and 20min@325.  Pie came out beautifully!  Will definately make again.

I absolutely hate corn syrup and therefore have never liked pecan pies of any kind.  This will make a believer out of you - in my opinion, a true pecan pie where the pecans are the star of the pie, not the corn syrup.  Just the way it should be.  Absolutely the only pecan pie recipe I have ever thought really was a PECAN pie and the only one I will ever make.  My husband (who loves pecan pies) said it was the best pecan pie he had ever eaten.  I can not tell you how much I appreciate you posting this recipe - from the bottom of my heart, thanks a million!!

I was TOO lazy to use my regular recipe, it has several steps..anyway...made this after reading numerous reviews.  Ugh...was not that happy.  For one thing, there was NOT enough filling...I did like the fact that it wasn't so sweet..the old man thought it was fine.  I don't understand how it could have such high ratings...I will stick to my old reliable recipe which is "pure" heaven.

I took this to an early thanksgiving party. Man was I embarressed. So dry( I followed the instructions NO changes)  We ended up scooping the pecans out and eating them but I WILL never make again.

From what I picked off the top of the pie after it was out of the oven I could tell it was tastey. The thing is, is that the appearance is not that of a traditional pecan pie. It looks like a brown marshmellow pie with a couple of pecans in it. I followed the recipe to a T, and don't know why it came out looking this way. Maybe it's the whole beating the eggs till foamy bussiness. I hope the family is pleased when I take this to the table tomorrow for the Thanksgiving Day meal. I only decided to try it because it had such good ratings. I will stick to the "real" stuff next time.....yes,the sinful corn syrup. ^_^ ~Jess

Although this pie tasted real good, I missed the "chewy" texture of a traditional pecan pie. It was not as sweet as a traditional, and not very pretty to serve. I would suggest topping with pecans to make it look more presentable.

The filling was so easy to make (I used a frozen pie crust).  It was delicious and not sickenly sweet like other pies I have had.  I would double the amount of pecans next time though.

This was just awesome!  My whole family loved it.  I baked it at 350 for 10 mins and then 300 for the next 40.  Came out perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Can't wait to make this on Thanksgiving...However, I'm not a baker and need to know if the 1/2 C butter is 1/2 C butter, melted or 1/2 C melted butter..there is a difference.....does anyone know? 
Thanks

This is the best pecan pie ever!  My husband, a connoisseur of pecan pies, loved it.  I made this pie for a family luncheon and it was gone in less than 15 minutes!  My family of picky eaters all loved this pie.  I made the recipe exactly as written--no changes--and it was fantastic!

My husband said the pie was tasty but I had a slight problem with the top, it formed a crust which turned hard. I'm not sure why. Any suggestions on what I might have done wrong would be appreciated. I'm new to this link so I hope this is going to the right place. The recipe itself was easy to follow. I know I'm not very good at cooking so I'm sure it was something I did wrong .

I will make this recipe again.  Next time however I will make doubly sure that my oven temp is exact (After the ten minutes at 400 degrees I just turned the knob on my oven down to 350 and didn't monitor the temp too much after that.)  I will also take the pie out at 30 minutes and hope that will avoid the crystallization I got in this first try.  The pie was delicious...I just didn't like the crunch of the sugar I got.

This was my first attempt at pecan pie and how easy was this.  I liked the fact that the pie wasn't too sweet, which is how most pecan pies are.  The only thing I think I would do different next time is not chop the pecans and would add extra to the top to make a pretty presentation.

my first attempt to make pecan pie and it turned out deadly DELICIOUS!! OMG just discovered my new addiction (this aint good for my diet =P) the recipe is easy and fast the only thing i changed was the baking temp and time. after reading so many reviews i came to this time which is 350/15 min then 300/40 min and it came out AMAAAAZING. the pecan aroma filled the kitchen everybody was wondering what baking ^_^. ill always make this pie its a keeper.

Update (21/5/2015): I discovered that when not overmixing the egg (decrease the amount of air into the egg) i dont have a pie with irregular surface (i used to have bumbs and balloons) so when i mix the eggs i dont overmix it.

I have been searching for a pecan pie recipe that does not use corn syrup. This is because i never buy/use it and do not want to waste money buying a full bottle just for a recipe.

I tried this recipe tonight and am very happy with the results. I LOVE pecan pie. I have tried making one years ago and failed (undercooked on bottom and burned on top) causing me not to try again. Until today that is.

I followed the recipe except i totally forgot to add the flour. Pie still came out great so i don't know how it would be if i did add the flour. The other small changes i made (after reading the many reviews) was i toasted my pecans first and i used a little less then the 1/4 cup white sugar (like half of that). I added an extra 1/2 cup pecans on top (as i do love pecans). Baked it in a Pillsbury pie crust using a 9" tart pan (did not have a pie pan). I did 350 for 15 minutes then lowered to 300 for 35 minutes. I put 50 minutes but it started to crack at 35 minutes so i turned it off.

Had a slice warm. It was moist and yummy. Will try more tomorrow to see how well it taste overnight.

Overall, i will definitely make this again and again :)

I am not a fan of pecan pie - waayyyy too sweet for me. But my daughter requested a pecan pie and I chose this recipe to make. I wasn't even going to try a piece myself but she insisted and, OMGosh! Fabulous!! I am now a pecan pie lover. Who knew pecan pie could be this delicious and not cloyingly, disgustingly sweet? After reading many of the reviews I did as many of you did and reduced the temperature to 300 degrees for the last 40 minutes and eliminated the white sugar. I also toasted the pecans for the filling for a few minutes in the oven and added 1 cup halved pecans to the top when I reduced the oven temp. I cannot thank you enough for this recipe. It is a favorite at our house now and is devoured almost as fast as I can make it!

I don't bake too often but Pecan Pie is my GF's favorite so I wanted to give it a try.  This was so easy and it was so good.  I think I'll adjust the cooking time in the future like others have said but other than that I won't change anything.  Thanks for sharing :)

This was absolutely fantastic!  I hate the gooey syrupy pecan pie, and this one was just delicious.  We had leftovers all week because not many people were at our Thanksgiving, and I had it for a few mornings with coffee which as it turns out is a to die for combination.  Especially with this particular recipe.  I followed the advice of others and changed the baking time to 350 for 15 minutes with foil around the edges of the crust then 300 for 50 minutes.  I use the refrigerated Pillsbury crusts in the red box which always work perfectly.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving today and everyone really loved it.  I made this and the apple crumble pie also found on this site and people thought I bought them both!  A true compliment if you ask me!

I did use pecan halves as opposed to pieces, but otherwise I made the recipe as written.  Thanks Elaine - you made me into a pie baking star!

This recipe delivers a perfect pecan pie every time!  I've been making this recipe for a year now whenever we get the craving for pecan pie.  I had to take a minute to write a review say that I love this recipe.  Thanks!

I wasn't a fan of this pie.  My family also thought it was just okay; husband and 2 kids under 8.  Actually, my husband, who likes overly sweet pies too much felt this wasn't sweet enough.  I thought the sweetness of it was the best part, the filling just wasn't to my satisfaction.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was just okay.  It didn't seem to have enough filling.  As it was cooking the topping almost looked like meringue, which was odd.  Will stick to my tried and true recipe.

This is a very light tasting pecan pie.  Usually the pecan pie is way too sweet and you can only have a touch before you feel sick. (that's me).  This is NOT too sweet.  I think its perfect.  Will make THIS one again and again!  Perfect with coffee or tea.  THANK YOU!  Pics to follow!

This was an incredibly easy recipe.  I added a tablespoon of coco powder to make it a chocolate pecan pie.  I also used the no-roll pie crust recipe from this site which was also incredibly easy and turned out great! For the cooking times I did 15 minutes at 350 degrees, 35 minutes at 300 degrees, and then I left it in the oven to cool down.  Both the pie and the no-roll crust turned out great!

Excellent. So nice to have a pecan pie recipe that doesn't use corn syrup! Only change I made was to use one and 1/4 cup pecans instead of the one cup.  I also cooked mine about 3 minutes longer, but that may be due to my oven.  Will definitely make again.  Glad we tried this one before Thanksgiving!

Outstanding recipe!  We like this much better than the recipes that call for syrup.  This one is a little less sweet but twice as good.  Thanks for sharing this easy and delicious recipe!

Calorie counters BEWARE !!! Deceiving!! First of all the LIST of ingredients does not EVEN list unbaked pie crust. Found this suspicious so thats why I recalculated it and it came in at  443 NOT 219 calories. Otherwise extremely tasty, but will never experience it again :(

This was to be the first Pecan Pie I ever made.  And it was for my new mother and father in-law, who love Pecan Pie.  I did a lot of research and couldn't decide whether to make the Karo version or this version.  So I made both.  Both baked up perfectly but one tasted much better than the other.  Anyone want my left over Karo?  The difference is not huge but definitely different.  I would say the non-karo recipe tastes richer more like a custard, more homemade and less store bought.  Don't hesitate to try it.  It is still a Pecan Pie through and through.  Everyone loved it of course.

HUGE HIT at Thanksgiving this year! Everyone wanted to know the secret?! I told them unlike most pecan pies, this one was not made with corn syrup. I will ONLY use this recipe from now on! The only thing I changed was I added an extra cup of chopped pecans ('cause I love 'em!) and 2 tsp cinnamon!

I like pecan pie but it always hurts my teeth as its too sweet, and I hate eating all that corn syrup.  Well, I just made this pie as a trial run before Thanksgiving, and its amazing!!!  Perfect flavor.  Did have to lower the heat and cook longer.  Next time I will cook it at 350 and then 300.  And might double the recipe to fill my deep 9 inch pan, but otherwise I love this pie!!!!

Yum!  I had to bake mine a total of 55 minutes.  Next time I'll leave out the white sugar because it's pretty sweet.  I'll also add 1/4c more pecans.

This was a good pie, BUT let me clarify...this is not what I would call your "traditional" pecan pie.  For those of us, who DO love the traditional pecan pie w/ that gel-ish center that you only get with the corn syrup, this is more like a pecan tassie.  With ALL that said, I want to say again, that this is a very good tasting pie.  I used the Basic Flaky Pie Crust recipe from this site.

Made this for my mom who gave it to someone who had really been giving her a hand at her job.  The reviews were great.  My mom said she really liked it, and she usually doesn't like pecan pie. =)

Well, dinner was over, and later when I went to get a piece of pie, it was all gone.  Apparently, it was a hit.  Most of the pumpkin was left, and the pecan was all gone.  Guess I will have to make another to see what it tastes like.  By the way, I used splenda instead of white sugar.  No one knew the difference.

I was a little skeptical because I've always used corn syrup, but this pie is GOOD.  I don't miss the corn syrup at all.  This will be my only pecan pie recipe.  I experimented with a second pie adding walnuts and chocolate chips.  I also baked it in a graham cracker crust.  We'll see how it taste.

My first attempt at Pecan Pie turned out fantastic. Only change was I only increased the pecans to 1 1/2 cups and that is it. I never even liked pecan pie before because I associated it with being sicky sweet and gooey, I really liked this though, and because of my husband's raving over it and the ease in making this pie I now will include this as a new recipe to stand by for the holidays.

This pecan pie was the worst I've made.  It was way too sweet and sugary.  I went with it because of how simple it seemed to make, and it was easy to prepare but the taste left a lot to be desired.  I'll stick to traditional pecan pie in the future.

Worst pecan pie I have ever made, not to mention the least appetizing by appearance and texture.  Made exactly based on the recipe with a good friend double checking my steps.  I had such high hopes with the high ratings and someone said they are now using this recipe in their restaurant.

this was a very good recipe, not too sugary.  The only reason that I did'nt give it 5 stars was the presentaion was not very appetizing.  I will make again, but I will add more pecans and cook at a lower temp for longer.

WOW. Made this for our Thanksgiving Dinner and it was first to go. I was a bit worried at the way it looked as it didn't look like your typical Pecan Pie. We used a Deep Dish Pie Pan and made our own crust. So when we filled the pie it didn't fill it up. So we quickly made another 1/2 batch to fill the rest up. We also placed Whole pecans on top to dress up the top of the pie. It does rise a bit so be careful. We baked it for 10 minutes at 350 and then lowered the temp to 300 and baked for another 60-65 (remember we had a deep dish so it will take less if you are doing a regular sized pie). All we can say is AWESOME. Everyone wanted the recipe. The insides of ours was a bit runny at first. We cut a piece out to test it and it tasted awesome, but it was a tad runny. Once it set there while we ate dinner it set up for some reason. All I can say is TRY THIS RECIPE. You won't be sorry.

Originally I was going to try to make a pecan pie recipe that called for corn-syrup, but I couldn't find any at the store.  Now I'm glad I couldn't!  This recipe is amazing and all I had to buy was a pie crust and the pecans! Everything else I already had!  This pie is extremely easy to make and it tasted great!  I did add a bit more pecans than what the recipe calls for, but that was the only change I made.

I had been hesitant about trying this pie, I tend to lean toward tried and true recipes.  However, a friend was looking for a less syrupy pecan pie so I bit the bullet and gave this one a shot.  I am so glad I did.  I am replacing my old recipe with this one.  It's gooey and sweet, but not too sweet.  I added a half cup more pecans and the result was perfection.  People actually moaned as they bit into this one.  

I did allow my eggs to come to room temperature before beating.  I baked at 350 for 40 minutes until I had a golden brown crust on top.  You certainly won't be sorry that you tried this.  I sure wasn't.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and it was wonderful (with the temperature alterations as stated by other reviewers).  My sister hates pecan pies, and it took some hardcore prodding   to get her to finally try a piece and she was delighted!  She, along with other family members loved how it was not thick and gooey.  Very wonderful pie....planning it for the menu again this Thanksgiving!

This was the best pecan pie I have ever made.  Everyone raved about how much of a buttery taste it possessed.  It was easier than the traditional recipe that required the Syrup.  Definitely a keeper.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE! I LOVE pecan pie but corn syrup is so bad for you so I've been very leary about making/eating it. I stumbled across this recipe and made it last night. It came out perfectly! The only thing I would change is to add a pinch or two of salt. Other than that, it's perfection. I promise you'll never miss the corn syrup.

I chose to make this one from the many on Allrecipes because I can not acquire corn syrup easily.  Everyone who tasted it loved it.  Sweet without being overwhelmingly so and very easy to make.  On a few occasion I have also thrown a handful of choc chips into the batter.  That was sinful and so worth it!

I loved the taste of this pie. I did not give it 5 starts because of the thin unattractive layer it leaves on the top.  Really would look unappetizing without some pecan halves thrown on the top part-way through baking.  But, the taste is fabulous and my 2 pecan-pie loving friends really enjoyed it.

For baking, I pre-heated the oven to 400 degrees and baked for 10 minutes.  Then, I left the pie in the oven and turned the heat down to 350 degrees.  It was done in another 25 minutes (so 35 mins total baking time) and I probably could have cooked it a little less and it would have been o.k.  I think for Christmas, I will put a "spiced pecan" on each slice.  I added the pecans to the top about 10 minutes before it was done. 

What this pie lacks in presentation, it makes up for in flavor and consistancy.

WONDERFUL recipe! My husband does not like nuts in his food & he LOVED this! I baked exactly as recipe called for & came out fine, a little on the thin side, maybe next time I'll use a smaller pie dish or double the recipe. Definately a keeper!

I live out of the USA and really miss pecan pie.  Unfortunately I rarely find pecans at the market and never have seen corn syrup.  Well my mom sent me some nice pecans and I had to try for pecan pie.  I used this recipe but without any white sugar but instead substituted a half cup of real maple syrup.  Aso I used 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract in the mix and half the called for brown sugar and no milk at all.  The pie turned out amazing.  It had perfect consistency and taste.  I shared it with a friend all living here from Texas and she and her husband couldn't believe how good it was!

Tried this pie today with some South Carolina pecans. Was disappointed. It was dry. Followed instructions to the letter. The filling was dry. Maybe I cooked it too long. All ovens are different. It did have a good taste. My husband loved it!  I will try it again with less oven time or lower temperature. I don't think it was the recipe, it was the cook. I'll keep trying.

To me, the regular pecan pie recipes are too sticky and sweet. This recipe produces an excellent pie, but I took the advice from so many, and made the following changes. 1.  12 minutes at 375, 45 minutes at 300. 2. 1 cup of pecans in the mix, 1/2 more placed on top neatly. 3. I put a tablespoon of crown in the mix. Can't taste it, but adds balance. Mine came out delicious.  One note, the filling isn't as thick as some recipes, but it tasted great.

I liked this, but the top of it turned "frothy" while baking, then cracked when finished baking.  It tasted great, and set up nicely, but the top didn't look very appealing.  I think I'll stick to my traditional recipe made with corn syrup.

WOW! I just used this recipe to make my first ever pecan pie and it was awesome! No gummy, stick to your teeth goo in this pie. Hubby and I were looking for a pecan pie recipe that would not snatch the dentures out of someone's mouth and this is the one. We have had to make do with tiny slivers of store bought and family made pies due to the extreme stickiness of the filling. This was great, we both had huge slices...so yummy! I baked it with the additional 1/2 cup of pecans, brushed the unbaked crust with egg whites to keep it from getting soggy and used the 350 degrees for 10 minutes followed by 300 degrees for 55 minutes and the crust was perfectly done...flaky and tender. I will make this several times this holiday season!

Thank you so much for this recipe. My sis #1 favorite thing in thee whole world is pecan pie and i tried this for the 1st time in December for her Bday after requesting a recipe from a coworker who requested that i pay him for his. I advised him I'd try my luck with the internet. I have since made maybe 16 for her, myself, my fiancee, family and friends who adore it. Its brought great memories thanks for your generosity!

I followed this recipe exactly as shown and it turned out great. Really nice texture and great flavor. It's not as sweet as most pecan pies I've had in the past but really good. I will make this again.

Not impressed.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  Turned out too dry, didn't fill a normal-size pie crust and the texture/taste was average to blah.  Both sides of my family are major pie people.  I make pies for every special occasion and I really pay attention to the reviews from the family.  Nobody commented at all about the pecan pie at Thanksgiving this year which means nobody liked it.  I'm glad so many people enjoyed this recipe but I won't be making it again.

We found this pie to be great-even better than the corn syrup ones that we grew up with.  This does not have the jiggly texture of the ones with corn syrup.  Both of mine formed a crust across the top (like many in the photos) which made it a little crumbly on top, but no one cared after they tasted it.

Did not come out for me at all. I took all the advice offered. I am wondering if it is my elevation. There was a crust that formed on the top as it cooked. When I cut into it the pie itself was about an inch think and odd. I was disappointed. I am not sure if I'm going to try again or just make a traditional pecan pie next time.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe as is. It came out too brown on top and a little runny but the flavor was good. The second time I followed another reviewers suggestion and baked it at 350 for the first 15 minutes, then lowered it to 300 for 50 minutes. Hubby absolutely loved it! It's my new pecan pie recipe. Thanks much!

This pie rocks. I'm not a pecan pie fan, but my husband is. So I decided to treat him. He can't stop raving about it. And I think it's fabulous because I'm not a fan of the syrup version. I brought one to his sister's house for Thanksgiving and came home with NONE. No one ate the other pies. I followed another reviewer's directions of baking at 350 for 15 min, then turned down to 300 for 50-55 minutes. I used a Mrs Smith's 9" frozen deep pie crust. Thanks Elaine.

This was AMAZing!! Sweet (but not sickeningly so) and nutty and yummy. Everyone at our Thanksgiving raved about it. I think I'll take the advice of another reviewer and add chocolate chips next time too. The pie set up fine, just bake it until the crust cracks a bit. I also reduced my oven temp to 350 for 15 mins, then 300 for 50-55. This left even the store bought crust in amazing, golden brown shape.

I've made this 4 times now for events and parties and every time people tell me it's the best pecan pie they've had.  Using brown sugar instead of syrup makes it taste more like pie and less like candy.  Great recipe.

It was very good - won second place in a pie contest.  All I did different was add about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and some fresh grated nutmeg.  I definitely had to protect the crust after the first 15 or 20 minutes because it was already getting dark.  I took it out at 45 minutes total cooking time and the center ended up not setting completely - it had the consistency of caramel.  Next time I'll probably cook it 10 more minutes.

Super easy and very delicious.  This recipe is a keeper!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and baked this at 300 degrees for 55 minutes and added an extra fourth cup of pecans.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

I made this last week and it was really good. Not too sweet or syrupy. I prebaked my shell for about 10 minutes before filling it so it wouldn't be gooey on the bottom. The crust was nice and crunchy and the filling divine.

I'm so happy to have found a pecan pie recipe that doesn't include corn syrup! That's not the only positive though, this is a very tasty pie, and really simple to make.  

From now on, when I make pecan pie, this is the recipe I will be using.   Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

I don't know if you can mess this pie up. I have forgot to put the vanilla and milk(last step) in and it was still fantastic.

The appearance was not so good. It looked very dry and unappealing. After getting over that and tasting it, it really was not as bad as it looked. Nothing special though. Dissappointed since I followed the recipe exactly :(

I made this for Thanksgiving this year because my husband, mother in law and friend love it.  They thought it was amazing.  I myself am not a Pecan pie lover but I'm going with what the others said.

A very tasty pecan pie.  Definitely different than the Karo Syrup recipe, not as sweet.  I like both recipes - you do taste the pecans more in this version.  I used a cream cheese pie crust dough with a little sugar mixed into the dough - it was very tasty.  I'll definitely make this again.

This recipe is a winner!  It's much easier than I would have expected, the perfect taste and amount of sweetness, and came out perfectly.  I love pecan pie but have always avoided making it because I couldn't find a recipe I liked.  It's become a family favorite!

Ok great flavor but I think i may have whipped too much.  Followed the baking instrictions that i baked at 350 for 10 min and then 300 for 55 min.  Raised real high but when took out of oven it sunk leaving the top crust still attached.  i am going to try it again though but it tasted wonderful!

Just made this with my first try at home made pie crust. This recipe was so easy to do and I took the advice of previous poster who said first 15 min at 350 and to drop it for the last 55 minutes. My family LOVED this!! They recommended that I make this for Thanksgiving.

Excellent Recipe!! First time making pecan pie. Made just as directed except baked at 350 for 10 min then lowered to 300 and baked for 40 minutes. Turned out perfectly. Deep dish crust worked well. Will definitely make again and have passed along recipe to others who tried and loved it.

needs a regular sized pie dish or shell. Not as sweet as a traditional pecan pie but very good. Pecan pie is my nemesis i always fail. This one actually came out the best i have ever made. I did kind of miss how on a normal pecan pie the top glazes over and on this type it kinda just forms a layer of crust on top. All in all im giving this a 5 star very easy to make and has a very good flavor:) I like to warm it up for a few secs in the microwave and add a scoop of icecream or coolwhip!! Thats how we do it down south....

My husbands favorite pie is pecan.  For his birthday I made 3 different ones, and this one was his favorite.  It is lighter in texture than most, because it doesn't have corn syrup in it.  It is a new favorite.

This is exactly the recipe I was looking for, so I really like this version of pecan pie.  I tried to get clever the first time I made this and increase the quantity of nuts - big mistake, this recipe is perfect as is.  The published recipe does not actually call for a pie crust though, which I assume is a misprint on the part of Allrecipes.

This Pecan Pie is always a WIN/WIN for me. Everyone always loves it, and it is super easy to make.  My personal preference is to roast the pecans in the oven at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes with a little vegetable oil, sugar, and salt to bring out more flavor and give the nuts more of a crispy texture rather than that raw, chewy bite.

Big hit with the family.  I do like the fact that it doesn't require corn syrup...in fact this was one of the reasons why I tried this recipe.  I just don't keep corn syrup on hand.  I have made it several times now and it turns out perfectly delicious every time.

Followed the recipe to the T...next time I will reduce the tempuratures because it did overbrown. Taste was good but the top got a little dry and crispy.

This is by far the best ever! Next time I will beat my eggs and then stir in or fold all other ingredients. The beaters made it to foamy so I had a crusted top. We liked the top that way but I prefer a traditional look. which also means, after you pour into a pie shell, top with whole pecans. The flavor is wonderful! everyone will love this!

EXCELLLENT pecan pie.  It goes to show that corn syrup isn't all that necessary to cook with.  I usually find a way around it, but pecan pie has been tricky until I found this recipe.  I've tried it with brown rice syrup, but it is still too sweet.  I cut out a little of the sugar in this recipe and it was GREAT!

Was really sweet. Too sweet. My pie was also runny. Tried baking it for 15 minutes on 350 and then 50 minutes at 300 per other reviewers. Seemed to burn on top very quickly before cooking in the center.

The best. My only pecan pie recipe now! I do cut back quite a bit on the sugar still. It is so addictive one can't stop eating it. I got many compliments when I took it to our family Thanksgiving. You do need to double the recipe for 1- 9 inch deep dish pie!! I also do cut back some on the butter.

Mine never set before I had to serve it, I left it in the oven for way more time than the recipe called for and it still came out runny. I let it set for 30 more minutes to no avail. It was runny but also delicious. I would make this pie well ahead of time. Once it set (and I ate it the next day), it was Incredible

An excellent flavored pecan pie.  The best I've ever eaten.  I too had the "foamy" top.  On my second attempt I mixed the pie completely by hand and that cured the problem.  I presume too much air being mixed in created a semi-merengue.  Again, the best pecan pie I've EVER had!

I personally hate pecans and therefore didn't even try this, but I made a bunch and sold them at a local high scale specialty grocery store and when we did taste tests everyone LOVED it, and some said it was the best pecan pie they'd ever tasted.  
They also loved the simple ingredients without trans fats that are caused by corn syrup.
It did look different then the one show as the main picture at the time I got the recipe. 
And for anyone interested this recipe actually seemed to improve by quadrupling, didn't compromise flavor, texture, or anything.

I have yet to "mess up" on a pecan pie, and I feel as though I didnt do anything wrong. However this pie turned out bad, the center tasted good but overall was more like a brownie. I am going to just "stick" to the basic corn syrup recipe because I know it always turns out well and isnt a waste of time or money.

Love this recipe!  It is always a hit anywhere you take it.  I also reduced the temperature to 300 and baked the pie for 45 minutes and everything turned out perfect.  An excellent recipe to reduce the amount of sugar or to substitute all the sugar with splenda and splenda brown sugar!

I was thrilled to find a recipe without corn syrup, and even more thrilled when the pie turned out to be delicious! My husband said it was the best pecan pie he'd ever had! We made a design on the top with whole pecans, and followed previous suggestions to turn down the temperature to 300 degrees and cook for 45 minutes, and the top of the pie turned a beautiful golden brown without burning.

I have never had good luck with making pecan pies but this one was so easy and turned out wonderful.  I did use the suggestion of cooking it on 300 for about 45 minutes and it turned out so pretty.  The recipe didn't specify whether to use a deep dish pie shell or regular, so I used a deep dish which was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe.

We did a taste test this Thanksgiving.  I used this recipe "Irrisistable pecan pie" and a good local bakery.  This was by far the least favorite of them all.  It was more custardy than the rest.  Plus I did add extra pecans and it was still not enough.  It is a pecan pie!!!  If you can not have corn syrup then I could see why you would use this recipe.  But if you have no problems with it stick with the other recipes...

This is THE BEST pecan pie I have ever had.  Much better than the ones with corn syrup, none of the gelatin like texture or the syrupy sweetness with this pie.  This one is heavenly.  I did bake the crust first, which was a mistake, so don't pre-cook the crust!  Thank you Elaine!! A note to the reviewer who said the texture was grainy, I found if you let it sit a day or so after baking, the texture changes and you have a very smooth filling.

Excellent!! A friend of mine (who has made pecan pies all of her life) had doubts when I told her it had no corn syrup, but she loved it and asked for the recipe. I liked it better than the traditional pecan pie, because I personally don't like the taste of the whole pecan. I chopped the pecans on the food processor and it was wonderful. Thank you!!!

Best pecan pie. My wife and neighbors loved it. This pie has a much better texture, and a fresher flavor than the ones that use corn syrup. Try this recipe and you'll never make pecan pie with corn syrup again.

This recipe is great and super easy to make! I would have given it a five, but I feel that I'd reduce the sugar a little next time-it was just a little bit too sweet. I'd also like to put in another 1/4 cup of pecans!

This is a fantastic and simple recipe.  Great for my mom who is allergic to corn syrup.  Everyone else seems to appreciate the fact there is no corn syrup used as well.  Holiday staple.

Just didn't look as appetizing as old fashioned recipe using karo syrup.  Many people at Thanksgiving asked what kind of pie it was...not a good sign.  Plenty left over...will go back to original recipe.

tried this back in 2011 and couldn't find it again (my search skills must have been lacking!)  THIS IS THE BOMBE!  Will only make this pie - this way - when asked for pecan pie!  So glad I found it - saving it to my recipe box NOW!

I had never made a pecan pie before, but knew I didn't want to use Karo syrup. This recipe is delicious! I read through the other comments ahead of time and made a few tweaks though: (1) I lightly toasted the pecans in the toaster oven before adding them into the mixture (2) I added cinnamon (3) instead of making one full-sized pie, I used a large muffin tin to make 6 mini pies. They are the perfect size for sharing and reheat in the toaster oven quite nicely!

Amazing! Perfect!! I reduced the heat by fear of burning the crust though. 375 for 10 minutes and then 325 for ~45 minutes. I sprinkled some chopped pecans on top after pouring the mix in to give it a better look and it worked great.

Except for increasing the measurement for pecans to 1-1/2 cups, I followed this recipe exactly.  I made 3 pies for Thanksgiving along with Pumpkin, Apple, and several other desserts (had a big group).  The Pecan was the hit of the night.  Everyone loved it and many told me it was the best Pecan Pie they ever tasted.  It was my first time making Pecan Pie so I felt so great.  It wasn't overly sweet, and it set up very well.  I did lose track of time and accidentally cooked it a few minutes longer than I was supposed to but the result was still amazing.  This is a keeper and I no longer need to look for any other.  I was so happy to see it didn't need corn syrup since it's something I normally don't keep on hand.  One thing I did do was mix the sugars in with the warm butter to avoid any grainy texture.  Worked like a charm.  Thanks for the fab recipe!

My boyfriend made this pie for Thanksgiving & Christmas.The first time he made it, the pie did not form that disgusting crust on the top. I totally enjoyed the first pie. Every pie since has formed that crust and I SERIOUSLY dislike that crust. My boyfriend says I "eat with my eyes" & that is very much true. He also tried "perfecting it" by added a more gooey filling, which I don't like either. So I made it myself today & it's delicious. I can't tell you how many of these reviews I read yesterday in prerpartion of making this pie. I am so thankful to you ladies for all the good suggestions. I only used light brown sugar (apprx. 1.5 c), I took many suggestions and added .5 c of pecans, I used 2 tbsp of milk and I did not totally melt the better. I think the key to avoiding that disgusting crust from foaming at the top was possibly slightly beating the eggs (just a little bit of bubble) & slow baking.I will use less butter the next time I make it, but this pie turned out wonderful!. So sweet and NOT dry at all as many negative reviewers stated. Also, I must note- I USED to like the traditional super sweet and gooey pecan pie. This pie is so much better and more classy in my opinion. It has the perfect amount of crunch vs. sweet ratio. I highly recommend anyone considering this pie to first DO YOUR RESEARCH and then try it. I doubt you will regret it! T O! I almost forgot -- I uploaded a photo of my pie!

It was a nice Pecan Pie, but I've made better, particularly Pecan Pie VII. It also took a long long time for the filling to cook. It was just as well I had froze the pastry in the pie tin before pouring the filling in. The pastry would've got burnt otherwise. One good thing is that it is easy to make.

This pie was amazing!!! I added twice as many pecans, and used 4 eggs. I also had to bake it for less than 350 because it started to burn a little. after it baked and set, the top of it was hard, but it wasn't burnt. So I made some topping cream and put that on top, which helped soften it, came out delicious!

I made this yesterday and thought it was the WORST pecan pie I had ever tasted.  The gelatinous corn syrup-y part of most recipes IS what makes pecan pies so delicious.  This recipe had no body, no moistness, did not stay together, and was a huge disappointment.  Even store-bought and frozen pecan pies are better than making this one.

Not a bad recipe but the filling (I think because of the brown sugar) almost felt more like a cookie rather than the syrupy goodness of a corn syrup based pie.  Tasty, but I think I will stick to the traditional Karo syrup recipe.

I made this pie tonight and use my kitchen aid to blend everything up to the flour.  When I baked it there was a thick crust on top.  I made another one because it didnt look right and I couldnt go without a pecan pie to thanksgiving.  My second pie came out wonderful but still have a crust on the top.  I looked at all the pictures and it seems others came out like this too.  Pie was delicious and will make again.  My pecans did not float to the top like most pies but yummy!  I really like the no corn syrup.

This pecan pie did not turn out for me. It didn't set properly even after 1 hour. I'll be going back to the Karo recipes.

I altered this recipe a little. Instead of using sugar. I only used 1/4 cup of agave nectar. Agave nectar has a natural sweet taste, so a little agave will work, and it will also help to cut down on sugar and calories. I also added 1/2 cup of ground quinoa seeds to make a healthier pie. It was delicious. My family loved it.  I also made my own crust. There is a recipe on this site for a No Roll Crust pie. I altered that recipe and I used 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour, 1 cup of grated unsweetened coconut, 1 cup of ground quinoa seeds grond into a flour , 1/2 of whole flaxseeds. Do not grind them for this recipe it will not work well. 1 tablespoon of agave nectar, 1tbs of cinnamon powder,  1/2 tsp. sea salt, and 1tbs of vanilla essence, and 1/2 cup of extra virgin coconut oil.  I got two (2) pie shells from that recipe and I pressed them down into the 9in pie dishes. I took a fork, and punched holes through the pie shells, and I baked them for 45mins. at 250 degrees because coconut oil burns at high temperature, and also to preserve the nutrients in the pie crusts. It was delicious!!! You can still enjoy desserts, just make them a little healthier!!!! Enjoy!!!

Made this pie with my 2 yr old and 9 yr old.  I thought that it was delicious...especially considering it had no corn syrup.  I was nervous because I poked around in it about 15 mins before it was suppose to be done and it was nowhere near set.  I poked around some more and let some of the 'liquid center' run out and that seemed to help it set.  As for the appearance.  It's not that bad. It LOOKS homemade and tastes great.  If yours comes out unattractive, just let it cool for a bit and top with REAL whipped cream and sprinkle with chopped pecans.

This was so easy and so good!!!  I just beat the eggs until there were bubbles on top (not long at all).  Cooked 10 minutes on 400, then switched to 350 and after about 5 minutes decided to switch to 325 for about 40 more minutes.  Checked on it a couple of minutes before the timer was done and the pies(made a double batch) were cracked on top.  Couldn't wait more than a few minutes before temptation took over.  Made one pie per the recipe and the second I added some Heath toffee bits with chocolate.  Both tasted great!!!  The whole family loved them.  Mine did not have a gritty texture as mentioned in some other reviews.  Best pecan pies I have ever had!!!

I am a pecan pie lover and have been my whole life. My mom taught me to make them with corn syrup, which was delicious but SORRY MOM this one blows that away! This creates the most delicious caramel inside which coats and crunches up the pecans just perfectly. It is so easy to make I whisked all the ingredients by hand, no mixer needed! I think it tasted even better a few days later. If you are looking for the perfect pecan pie recipe, skip the karo syrup section and just check your cupboard. You probably have all this stuff already! :)

Wonderful! I will never make the karo syrup kind again! The batter tasted like a praline. I baked it at 350 degrees for 15 minutes and then lowered it to 300 degrees to finish it.

This gotta be the most problematic 4.5-star recipe I've ever tried from the AR site.  The filling was way too thin.  I more than doubled the amount of pecan to make the pie look like a pie.

I absolutely loved this pie! My husband, who doesn't like pies acknowledged that this was good.  I took some suggestions from other reviewers.  I changed bake time to 350 for 15 minutes and 300 for 50 minutes.  I added two tablespoons of flour and one and a half cups of pecan.  I will definitely make this again.  My recommendation is to use fresh pecans.  This makes a *huge* difference.  I tried the same recipe with walnuts, but I think pecans are *much* better. : )

This pie has great flavor but wasn't as pretty as other pecan pies.  It calls for chopped nuts, and they're mixed into the filling rather than being arranged so that they raise to the top like in other pies.  This also affected the pie's texture.  If I tried this pie again (which I probably will since it doesn't call for corn syrup), I would buy halves and lay them on the bottom and hope they rise to the top.

I used this recipe to make little mini pecan pies.... they were a hit and everyone was sad to find out they had all been eaten! I am usually not a fan of pecan pie but this is delicious! My husband wants me to make some more minis for his Christmas party and the ladies at my work want me to make them so they can serve them to their families for Christmas!

Delicious!  Nice alternative to the traditional Karo syrup pecan pie.  I noticed that a member named "Kym" (a beginner cook) asked a question along with the picture that she posted.  To answer her -- Kym, I believe you simply cooked the pie too long. That can cause the top to become very poofy.  Next time, try removing it while the center is still slightly jiggly.  It will set up as it cools.  Also, your oven may run a little hot, causing the poof to occur before the cook time is finished.  Might want to invest in an oven thermometer (very inexpensive and can be found in any kitchen store, Walmart and grocery stores).  You can set or hang the thermometer in the oven to test the actual temp.  If it's off, adjust recipes temps accordingly.  The correct temp makes all the difference in baking cakes, pies, cheesecakes, etc.  Hope that helps you have better luck next time!  Have fun with your learning adventure and don't be afraid to keep trying -- you'll have it down pat in no time! :)

You can make this sugar free.  I just replaced the white sugar with Splenda, and cut the brown sugar in half and replaced it with Splenda Brown Sugar. It turned out great. My Dad hasn't been able to eat pecan pie since he found out that he was diabetic, so he was so excited when I made this for Thanksgiving and he could actually eat it.  It tasted just like a regular pecan pie, if not better.  To improve the look of the pie, I just patterned pecan halves on top before baking, and it turned out beautiful.

First, it din't fill my 9" pie crust so the edges shrank and it looked AWFUL.  Second, it looked like a chocolate pie on the top - strange chalky texture too.  Third, it tasted like melted brown sugar.  No thanks.  Glad it wasn't baked for guests!

I'm about to skew the ratings, but I don't think you'll mind - here's why! I wanted to taste the difference b/t a pecan pie, bite for bite, made with and without corn syrup.  So, I made two and this recipe hardly compared in taste and color.  While it might have passed for pecan pie on its own, I agree with the oter reviewers who say this isn't 'traditional' in taste.  It has a thicker, more flour-y taste/consistency and desparately needs more [toasted]pecans. The winning recipe was from Baking Illustrated and was complete with 2 cups of TOASTED and CHOPPED pecans.

This recipes is amazing.  I usually can only eat a tiny bit of pecan pie because it is TOO sweet, this one is absolutely perfect and you taste the pecans not just the overwhelming sweetness you get with a syrup pie.  Everyone in my family repeatedly told me it was the best pecan pie they had ever had.

WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My kids and husband loved it. I baked three that Monday before Thanksgiving and planned on freezing them until Thursday morning. Well, all gone before Tuesday and not even a crumb left in the pie tins. I had to bake three more. ******** I love pecans so I put 1 1/4 cup of pecans in each pie. I started the recipe with room temp. eggs and I DID NOT super pack the brown sugar (I just made sure it was a full cup by LIGHLY packing) and baked the pies at 350 for 15 mins. Then 300 for 55 mins. Now we can have pecan pie more often, since the ingredents are a staple in our house. A very wholesome but yet delicate pie and definitely a must try.

I was short about 1/4 cup of brown sugar, so I just added more white.  I also added one more egg because I had a deep dish pie crust and I was afraid that 2 eggs wouldn't fill the crust. I also added about 1/2 cup more pecans. This is a delicious, very easy pie to make.

This is fantastic. I am NOT a pecan pie fan but have tons in my family so I was looking for an alternative to "traditional" pecan pie. My family can't stop raving about it. My aunt & uncle, who live in Indonesia was complaining that they don't sell corn syrup there so they wouldn't be able to have pecan pie for Thanksgiving. I told her about this recipe & they were all beyond excited! I took advice from other reviews & baked at 350 for 15 minutes & 300 for 55 minutes. I also used 12 tbsp butter instead of 8. Thank you so much for this recipe! It's definitely a keeper!!!!

i made this today and husband has enjoyed it immensely.  he is the pecan pie lover in the house.  this pie does not turn out as dark as a normal pecan pie, and it does puff up as it bakes, so it does fill up the pie crust well.  excellent recipe if you're avoiding corn syrup!

LOVELY! 2nd pecan pie I've ever made, 2nd recipe. The 1st one had the Karo syrup. While I did like the karo syrup encrusted topping of pecans that that recipe made, this recipe is a much fuller, all around pie. I'm trying to figure out how to incorporate the 2. This pie was very easy to make (I had some leftover pie crust pre-made - Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust), took me no time to mix up the ingredients. I made a cute flower design of halved pecans on top of the pie and pressed them in half way. I also added about 1/2 tsp more vanilla to the mix and a pinch of salt per reviewers' suggestions. Beautiful! I will make this recipe over and over again!

This was amazing! I Want to clarify that this is not a deep-dish pie, though.

Definitely a keeper. Not too sweet and not bland at all, which is what I thought it'd come out to. Took another user's suggestion and used 3/4C light brown sugar and 1/2C splenda instead, came out just as tasty and felt a little less guilty.   =)

This was very nice. We couldn't even tell the difference. The only thing I change was used no white sugar and added only 3/4 of regular brown sugar and it was still perfect. Don't even miss the gooeyness of the usuall pecan pies.

The will be the pie I make from now on!!!  My family loved it.  It fools you because when it comes out of the oven, it looked like it may have the texture of cake, however, one cut into it and a fab textured nut mix slightly similar to traditional pecan pie is enclosed - only it's better!!!!

I have made this twice now and have had great results.  The fact that it was gone within 24 hours of serving it in a household of two is a good sign.  One caution - it can look as if it is getting overdone on top - it's probably fine - check it properly.

Very tasty! Like others I made a patten on the top of the pie to make it look nice. I also lightly toasted the pecans in the oven while it was pre heating, it deepend the flavor. Thanks for sharing.

I went with this for my first ever pecan pie for my sugarholic boyfriend because it didn't have syrup in it.  The result was absolutely perfect.  He said it was the best he ever had.  Thanks for the recipe!  Note:I added a few extra pecans to the mix and for a pattern on top as well.

My husband has always said that his favorite pecan pie is made by the Old Ebbitt Grill in Washington, DC.  I made this recipe for our Thanksgiving dinner and he pronounced it superior to that of the noted eatery.  I was in search of a recipe that did not call for corn syrup, as I find it too sweet.  This recipe is just sweet enough and has a wonderfully rich buttery taste. Amazing pie!

I used pre-made pie crusts (the cold kind, not frozen) and cut out circles, put them in a cup-cake pan, and made mini-pecan pies - they were perfect!  It made about 2 dozen with this recipe and I used 2 crusts. YYYUUUMM!!! :)

Having moved to the UK, I was shocked to discover corn syrup is unavailable. I had my heart set on a pecan pie for Thanksgiving and found this recipe. The great reviews made me want to try it and I wouldn't make anything else in the future. Many thanks!

This tastes more like old fashioned pecan pie. I hate pecan pies with karo. too sweet and sticky. this one is to die for. Passed the test for my 80+ year old dad--tastes the way he remembered his mom making them.

If you find it difficult to get the custard to set up just right in your pecan pie, try this recipe.  Comes out perfect every time. Regardless, if you like pecan pie you MUST try this recipe. I have made many, many pecan pies as it is our favorite pie. This is far better than the corn syrup recipes I have always used previously.  This is my new favorite recipe for this pie. Thanks Elaine.

It didn't take as long to cook and the top didn't have that pretty sheen that most pecan pies have. It had a crumbly texture. The flavor was good but it was dry and almost over cooked. Would not make again

Followed every instructions, except the amount of pecans.

Tastes good, not so sweet or candy like. However, not so good visually.

Beating the egg to foam, the pie puffed up significantly and formed hard baked outer shell. Texture of the hardened outer shell is nice, but does not look good.

One of the best pies I ever made! Used buttermilk instead of milk and coconut oil instead of shortening but excellent none the less! Also made crust from scratch using buttermilk.

Turned out very good!! I did 10 min at 400 and then 55min at 300 degrees. I think my one mistake is I frothed the eggs too long, but it still turned out well very good!

My husband's favorite pie is Pecan Pie. He said this is hands down his favorite recipe for it! He went for seconds right away!I also made 3 for our neighbors, one note add the extra 1/4 cup of pecans I didn't with the first pie and it made a crusty dome on top of the pie, while it was delicious it was not appealing in appearance the other two pies I added the extra pecans and received at better looking pie with all the deliciousness! This is a family favorite going in our recipe box faves recipe, thank you so much for sharing!

Pretty good pie. A couple tips I've learned making this pie is to poke a few holes in the bottom of the pie crust with a fork otherwise in my experience the pie dough won't cook all the way through in the middle. If you have a propane stove as I do you want to turn it down to 325 instead of 350 and cook for 35-40 minutes.

I'll have to try this again, but only because of all the other positive reviews. I took the advice of baking at 300 for 45 mins., but the filling was too runny. Turned it 350 for 10 more minutes, but the filling was still molasses-like. Makes me wonder if I should add more flour to thicken the sugary mix. Will post again in a few weeks before trying again.

Would agree with previous posts about changing baking time to 350 degree for 15min and then 300 degree for 55min. Amazing recipe  and so simple! If your egg is frothy enough, it almost produces a meringue-like crust on top! This is definitely my go to recipe for pecan pie.

I am from the south and this is a very dry pecan pie recipe. I will not make this again. In the south we like our pecan pie moist and sticky and this DOES NOT fit the bill.

This pie was really tasty and easy to make.  I did change the oven temp and times per other reviewers suggestions and glad I did as I had no problem with the crust getting too brown.  I did 350 for first 15 min and then 300 for 45 min (that's when my pie started to crack) and it turned out great!

Simply excellent! Made twice now. The last time I added a handful of chocolate chips. It was a nice twist.

I have successfully made one (precisely one) karo style pecan pie.  Because it is my boyfriend's favorite dessert, I have attempted (unsuccessfully) to recreate that first miracle of pecan deliciousness many, many times.  To my utter dismay, I could never get them to set.  I had thus given up the battle of the pecan pie, until I recently ran across this recipe...oh sweet mercy.

I followed the mixture of this recipe exactly and it fit perfectly into a frozen deep dish pie crust (though I almost changed the amounts based on another review that said it wasn't enough).  I did, however, follow other people's suggestions and baked it longer and at a lower temperature than the original recipe stated.  300 degrees F for 50-55 minutes worked perfectly to set the ingredients.

The difference, in my "culinarily-challenged" opinion, between the karo and the brown sugar recipe is that this one is more caramel-y in texture (maybe not quite as over-poweringly sweet) whereas the karo version is more syrupy in texture and definitely cavity cringe worthy.

We recently moved to a lovely 1830's farmhouse in SC. The property has over 20 pecan trees. I have never made a pecan pie before because I really did not want to bother. But pecans are falling out of the sky now :-) so I thought it was time. I never use corn syrup so it is not an option in our house. This recipe was spot on! The only two things I did differently was leave a mixture of whole and chopped pecans. And I toasted my pecans for about 5-7 minutes on 350 degrees. Second change came from another reviewer and they suggested to brown the butter and then let it cool before adding it. It got rave reviews and it deserved them. I used a recipe for an awesome butter pastry crust and it was delicious!

This was my first time making a pecan pie and it came out good.  My husband really enjoyed it.  I am not a huge fan of pecan pie but there is a lady that makes them locally and they are delish!  Hers has more of a buttery taste and less of that gooey filling that I don't care for.  Overall it was a simple recipe and the hubby enjoyed it.

This pie is absolutely the best pecan pie I've ever had. My husband, who never had been a big pecan pie fan before, has since declared this his favorite pie ever! I always add 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to the pie, it makes it absolutely heavenly!

LOVED THIS! so much better than corn syrup. The only problem I had was that the filling foamed and hardened over the pecans I laid on the surface of the pie. Still, had a nice buttery flavor! I baked it for 10 minutes at 400 and 35 minutes at 300.

I had never made pecan pie.  I used the tips from another user and added 1/4 choc chips.  I had warmed the sugars & butter on top of the stove to prevent the mixture being grainy.  I added a bit of the hot mixture to the eggs to tempure it.  The baking time was 10 min at 400, 20 min at 350 and 10 min at 325.  WOW, it turned out perfect and wasn't too sweet, I had cut down the sugar a bit.  I thought when it came out with a crispy, cracked crust it hadn't turned out....wrong!!  Served with whipped cream was yummy!!  Next time, I would serve with a scoop of ice cream and top with whip cream!!

I used 6 oz pecan pieces (should add pecan halves on top for appearance), added 3 oz of chocolate chips (about 3/4 cup), and left out the white sugar. Left eggs out for up to 1 hr. to allow the egg to mix better. Melted the butter in microwave using 15 sec @ full power, 15 sec @ 80%, 15 sec @ 60%, 15 sec @ 40%, and 15 sec @ 20%. Then first mixed the melted butter with the brown sugar and flour with a wire whisk, to help melt the sugar, and achieve smooth consistency. Then added milk and vanilla to the eggs, and beat the mixture together with a fork. Then added the egg mixture to the sugar and butter mixture, first mixing them together with a plastic spoon, and then with a wire whisk. Then added 1/2 the pecans, mixed together with a plastic spoon, then added the other 1/2, mixed together, and then added the chocolate chips and mixed together. Result was a very evenly mixed pie filling. Poured into the Mrs. Smith pie crusts, and baked for 10 mins @ 400, reduced the oven temp to 350 and baked for 20 additional mins, and then reduced the oven temp to 325 and baked an additional 10 mins until the middle of pie settled. I used this tip from another reviewer to reduce the baking temp to eliminate burning the pie before it was done. PS This was the second attempt. The first attempt was a comical adventure which turned out well anyway. I measured the dry ingredients, put them in a plastic bag, with a small bottle of vanilla, and packed them in my suitcase with a graham cracker crust.

I made this pie according to the original recipe and according to the reviews. Each time, it ended up being   to dry and/or crunchy. I made this and the Irresistible  Pecan Pie on the site and everyone at my party preferred the one with corn syrup. I wish that it was a big hit like everyone else's seemed to be, but unfortunately it wasn't.

Made it 2x's the first following the recipe and the 2nd with the following changes.  Deleted the white sugar, mixed melted butter and brown sugar well and then added to foamy eggs.  Increased CHOPPED pecans to 1-1/2 c and baked for 10 minutes at 350 the 30 - 40 min at 300.  Much better the 2nd time around.

Hubby loves Pecan Pie and this one did not disappoint.  He gave it the 5 stars and I concur. It was sweet without being overbearing.  I added extra pecans on top afterward.  Will make this one again - very easy to make.  It cooked up a little faster than I expected.  I'll be making this one again.

This was great!!  Much better than the pies with corn syrup.  I listened to a lot of the other reviews and made sure my eggs were room temperature, mixed the melted butter with the sugars until the sugars dissolved before adding other ingredients, stirred the eggs into the mixture insteading of beating them and cooked the pie at 350 degrees for 15 mins and then lowered oven to 300 degrees for 50-55 mins.  I will definitely be making this again!

This is VERY good.  So easy to make and VERY Yummy.  Will be making it again.  I tweaked it slightly based on other reviews.  Omitted the white sugar, used 1 1/2 cup pecans and baked at 350 for first 10 minutes, then lower to 300 for another 40 minutes.  Just Delish!

I've never been a pecan pie fan but made this for a loved one. I use a store bought gluten free crust and gluten free flour instead of wheat flour. I loved it so much that it has become the pie I make for holiday parties. My family and friends now request this pie.

I wanted a corn syrup free pecan pie since GMO's are so prevalent in American corn products. Now I'm hooked for the amazing quality of the pie itself. However, I couldn't just let the pecans float around willy-nilly. So I arranged them in the bottom of the pie and poured the filling over. Seemed like everyone got their fair share of nuts.

Delicious! I'm never making the corn syrup version again! I soaked my pecans in some high quality bourbon and added a dash of sea salt, for my own version of Classic Southern Pecan Pie. Scrumptious.

Delicious. A hit for some, and just normal for others. I thought it was great though! I bit less chewy than the usual pecan pie, but very similar. Some thought it would be ultimate if I added some cchocolate chips to the filling, which I completely agree on and will try that next time God willing! Thanks for sharing!

I was trying to use up leftovers from my Christmas baking so I used ground pecans, I scaled to 12 servings as I had 1.5 cups, made tarts, yielded 36 3 inch tarts that baked in 18 minutes, the clients at the homeless shelter will love these tonight :)

A pecan pie made without Karo syrup intrigued me. So I thought I'd make this one since I always have brown & white sugars, but I have to buy Karo syrup especially to make a pecan pie.  Also, I try to make recipes as written the first time trying, but I didn't have milk, so I used half & half. Other than that I used the exact ingredients. I baked at 400 degress for 10 mins & then 350 degrees for 35 mins.  Was really good, but a little dry. So I made again exactly as I did the first time and just baked 40 mins at 350 degrees, and my son declared it the best pecan pie he's eaten.  He ate the whole pie except 2 pieces.  The taste is phenomenal. This is the way I'll be making pecan pie from now on!

I made this both for Thanksgiving and Christmas and it was a real hit with our family and guests. I like that it doesn't call for corn syrup. I'm sure it would be very good with walnuts instead of pecans. I used to always use walnuts in our financially leaner days. Don't be afraid of the unconventionality of this recipe. It's delicious!

Everybody loved this pecan pie.  I am not really a pecan pie lover so I have to take their word for it.  Very easy to make.  I did add more pecans than called for but that was the only change.

The best pecan pie ever---it is not gelatinous and has a great texture and taste.  We use a 10 oz bag of nuts and ground 1 cup for the filling then put the rest of the nuts on top of the pie. Love this recipe!

EXCELLENT!  My husband has a corn allergy, so we have to stay away from any foods using corn-related products such as corn syrup.  He loves pecan pie though and I was thrilled to find this recipe sans the syrup.  Bonus - it is one of the most delicious pecan pies we've ever tasted.  I get so many compliments and recipe requests everytime I make it.  Perfect!

My family absolultely raved over this pie.  They said it is the best pecan pie they have ever had because it wasn't so sweet.  Definetely a keeper in the recipe box and will be making it again.

I love the idea of no corn syrup.  I also loved that the pie was not overly sweet.  However, be wary of advice in the reviews which say to reduce heat and add cooking time.  I followed this advice and my pie was overdone and dry.  I will try again following the recipe as is.

(Not enough for a deep dish pie crust) However it is... Fantastic!!!! Full of flavor and very delicate texture in your mouth.  I followed the recipe, however for myself I like to make a cup of pecan butter by roasting pecans in the oven at 350 for 8 mins then grinding them into butter. I cover my pie shell with this pecan butter, and add the filling as the recipe states. Thank you so very much for a non corn syrup version.  Besides, it's much better!

When I first made this pie, I was disappointed in how it looked.  The top looked dry and nobody cut into it at Thanksgiving until my best friend's husband took pity and had a slice.  As soon as you cut into it, there is an inside of creamy, gooey, sugary pecan pie that is similar in texture to apple pie filling without the apples.  A scoop of vanilla ice cream and this pie is to die for! It was the only dessert to be completely gone at the end of Thanksgiving dinner, and people were fighting for a piece!

WOW!!!  The only thing I changed was that I used 1 1/2 cups pecans.  I think I cooked it 40 minutes but I knew it was done by the big crack through it.  The crack wasnt an issue as it went back together as it cooled.  A local "pie company" makes awesome pecan pie.  My husband said he prefers this pie to the pie companies.  I don't care for the usual jelly type of texture of pecan pie and this does not have that texture.  SUPER RECIPE!!!

I don't eat pecan pie, but my family didn't like this one. They said the sugar was gritty and crystallized instead of being smooth like with corn syrup. Next time I think I will go with the traditional corn syrup recipe.

This is by far the best pecan pie you'll ever taste! I've been trying to find the perfect one for a few years and here it is! I've thrown away all the other recipes. I added a little extra pecans and cooked at 350 for 15 mins and 300 for 50 mins. this pie is not runny at all and tastes great. doesn't look like a traditional pecan pie on the top so I arranged a few pecan halves on top. I might try adding some mini choc chips next time as we like chocolate pecan pie as well. YUM!

Amazing...no other word for it.  In the mid 90's I won the blue ribbon at the Wisconsin State Fair for my pecan pie...a traditional pecan pie with corn syrup and some Tennessee whiskey.  Everyone always requested I bring this pie to family gatherings.  I tried this pie for Thanksgiving and the raves and reviews were outstanding.  I will not make the corn-syrup version ever again.

I made this for my father-in-law for Thanksgiving - he's a pecan pie maniac; however, I despise the karo-syrup version of pecan pie, so I tried this recipe. I did cook it longer and lower than the original recipe, as recommended by several people (in my oven 350 for 15 followed by 300 for 50 minutes did the trick), and it came out absolutely perfect. This is now my go-to pecan pie recipe. Next year, I think I will try making indvidual tarts with the fabulous filling!

This was my 1st attempt ever at making pecan pie. This recipe is fantastic as written. Hubby loved it and even ate some for breakfast! My only change was to cook it at a lower temp for a bit longer. 300 for 50-55 minutes after the initial higher heat setting. I will be making this again - soon!

I followed this recipe exactly with two exceptions: I used a 9 inch pie pan so I had to times the recipe by 1.5 to fill the crust (I used the Pie Crust IV recipe from this site, which is awesome). I also took another reviewer's advice and baked the first 15 minutes at 350 and baked another 50 minutes at 300 and it came out PERFECTLY. I wish I could give this pie 10 stars, it is that good. I don't even like pecan pie usually but I absolutely love this one and I think it's because it doesn't call for corn syrup. It really makes a huge difference, it doesn't come out gelatinous like it does with the syrup. The brown and white sugars caramelize beautifully and I really like the chopped pecans over the whole ones. The presentation is nicer and it's easier to cut and chew and it really gives it a richer flavor and texture. A+++

Amazing! No more corn syrup! I was really worried about making this recipe. I made four of these pies. I used regular size store bought crust. I wrapped the edges in aluminum foil. 

I made two of the pies with the flour and two without. The two without the flour came out much prettier. The pecans rose to the top all on their own. I had sprinkled some extra on top of all four pies as advised by other reviewers. The pies where I used flour almost hid even the pecans I had sprinkled on top. They were not as attractive. We only tried the pie without the flour as I was a bit worried about those especially, but it was wonderful! I haven't yet tried the pies with the flour but I would recommend omitting the flour all together since the result is a very pretty pie that tastes amazing.

  I cooked the pies at 350 for 15 minutes, and 300 for 50 minutes, until it passed the clean knife test. It looked a teeny bit wobbly right out of the oven but set up great after it had cooled.

 My husband loved it even though he was very skeptical at first, now it is the only version he wants to make from now on!

I followed the recipe as written and my pie never solidified.  The filling had a very thin, runny consistency and ran all over the plates when served.  It was also EXTREMELY sweet (no less so than the pies made with Karo) and formed a top "crust" that had a gritty texture and was not very appealing.  The flavor was nice (very caramel-like) but I could definitely taste the graininess of all the sugar.  I so wanted to like this recipe, but I doubt I will be using it again (at least not without some serious modifications).  :(

Eh, it was alright. I'm sure this pie would be great for people who don't already enjoy pecan pie, but I'm not impressed. The filling had an okay taste, but it didn't have tons of taste even though I added 2 tsps of cinnamon.

Great recipe.  I omitted the white sugar and just made sure to pack the 1 cup of light brown sugar and it was the perfect sweetness for my taste.  I made it the first time exactly by the recipe but I felt the 1/4 C of white sugar made this pie too sweet.  I also decoratively added whole pecans to the top of the pie for a better presentation.  I baked at 325F for 50 minutes also.

This is delicious! I made it this weekend to try out before Thanksgiving day and it was amazing! I used dark brown sugar and added 1/4 cup more chopped pecans but to the bottom of the pie shell (they float up). I also baked for 15 min. at 350, then for 40 minutes at 300...it was perfect! It continues to cook after you take out of oven so don't overbake! Let cool for a few hours so pie will really harden. Delicious! And no corn syrup!

Like many other reviewers said.....I will NEVER make another pecan pie with corn syrup.  Absolutely delicious.  Sure, the stick of butter seems like a lot but come on.....it's a pie...you're not eating it because you're trying to lose weight.

I made this with just the change of baking it at 350 for 15 mins and then 55 mins at 300. It came out perfectly. Even my dad, who said he didnt like pecan pie loved it! I will be using this recipe again, thank you very much!

Made the pie as written. Nice flavor and texture. Mine was a little dry (over cooked I think) maybe because I've never made a pecan pie before and didn't know what to watch for as it got close to come out of the oven. Made two of these pies for company tonight. Everyone liked the pie and some thought it was a little too sweet. Maybe next time I'll cut back a bit on the white sugar. For the crust, I pair this with the Flaky food processor pie crust from this site, another good recipe for you recipe box!

This one is a keeper. I used pillsbury fresh crust and foiled the edges. I also cooked it at 350dgf for 10 minutes then 300dgf for 55 minutes. If you have a mixer whip some air into the final mixture to help with a lighter texture.

ok lets see where to start yum-O!!!! I have two huge pecan trees in my back yard and this is the first time i have ever made pecan pie.  I followed this recipe to the T the only thing i had to do diff. was to bake it a little longer about and hour 20 it was still a bit runny after the time given on the recipe other than that it came out GREAT :0) I dont no if it was because the pecan where fresh off the tree but this was truly a delicious pie thanks for sharing

OMG -- this is the best tasting pecan pie I've ever made!  I love it!!  It's buttery and smooth, and yet has a bit of crunch and texture on top.  Not too sweet, but with a rich, pecan taste.  I love that it doesn't use HFCS, because I like to bake my pies with all organic ingredients.  This is a winner for me.  I've already had two slices before dinner!! Yes, it's THAT good!!

I made this today and it is great. Personally, I think it is better than the ones made with corn syrup. It is good and sweet, but not sickening sweet. Please note in the recipe it does not call for the brown sugar to be packed; this could be overlooked by some. I also followed the advise of others and started out baking at 350 and reduced to 300. Because of the butter amount, you still end up with a crispy crust on the bottom even with the lower temps. This will be my go to recipe from here on out. I've tried many others, but this one is by far the best.

I'm fairly new to baking and this pie was VERY easy to make, and it turned out super yummy! Presentation-wise I'd add some whole pecans to the top next time, just so it looks nicer. But it tasted perfect, and my husband couldn't keep his hands off it! I will definitely be using this recipe again. Very soon!

This is a great recipe. I did not rate this a 5 star because in my opinion a 5 star means when there is no improvements needed. But this was great! I would recommend this to all. Although I do not like that when it is finished baking that it has a crust like over top without howing any pecans. I would recommend sprinkling some pecans for the finished product to look like a becan pie. Other than that it was really good and we enjoyed it! I also used the butter flakey pie crust recipe. Yum!

What a great pie.   I made it for dinner guest and it got rave reviews.    My husband can't stop eating it.  On my second pie, I saved some half pecans to lay on top of the pie before baking.   It made the pie more attractive.

This recipe is top of the line. My husband is from the south, and pecan pie has always been his favorite dessert. He says that this recipe makes the best pie he has ever eaten. I've made this recipe many times, and I've never had a problem. I always follow it exactly, including the baking times and temperatures, except that I usually add more pecans, especially to put pecan halves on the top (before baking) so that it looks special, since this is his "birthday pie." If you're looking for an easy, fool-proof pecan-pie recipe, this is it; it's much, much better than any corn-syrup (or other pecan-pie) recipe, and I've tried quite a few.  Thanks, Elaine!

This was the first pie I had ever made and it was so easy and so good! However the first time, my bottom crust turned out a bit soggy, so maybe it needs to be baked a bit before.

This pie was SOOO good and SOOO easy to make! My husband ate half the pie by himself, then DARED me to make another one. Make sure the eggs are room temperature so the butter does not get hard again.

I don't really like traditional pecan pies. The corn syrup makes them sickening to me, so I specifically looked for a recipe without corn syrup. This pie came out very well. It was pleasantly sweet, not overwhelming. The texture isn't as "wet" as a traditional pecan pie. Very tasty results.

This recipe is awesome.  Many reviewers commented that it didn't look like pecan pie.  Easy to fix. We like lots of nuts so I mix the cup of chopped pecans with other filling ingredients then place a cup or so of pecan halves decoratively on top just before placing it in the oven. Also I've made this pie several times in my convection oven.  I preheat to 400 degrees then turn down the temp as soon as I put the pie in the oven. Otherwise it gets too dark on top.

Excellent! This was my first time both eating and making pecan pie. I loved it. Only thing is that my pie didn't have that layer of pecans because I mixed the nuts in the batter---it may be because I overbeat the eggs. Better luck next time---and there will be a next time!

Very good, easy to make. I put halved pecans on top for appearance, but that made it very hard (and messy looking) when sliced. Not sure that I would do that again.

Having never made a pecan pie before, I was very surprised at how easy this was to put together.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and baked this at 350 for 15 minutes then reduced to 300 for 50-55 minutes and it was perfect.  I took it to Christmas eve dinner at my in-laws house and everyone raved over it.

Made this today to use some pecans my uncle gave me picked from his yard.  I don't usually eat pecan pie, but my husband loves it.  I wanted something that didn't have the corn syrup, to see if I'd like it that way.  This was really tasty, and easy to put together.  I didn't care for the crust that formed on top, so next time I might cut the temp and cover the top with some pecan halves.  The taste was good enough I'll be making another of these for my uncle to thank him for the pecans!  Thanks for sharing.

this is my first pecan pie i've made and my second that i've tasted.  so i dont have alot to compare it to, but that being said, i thought this recipe was extremely easy (making pies doesnt get any easier than this) and tasted great.  i put it in a deep dish crust and that wasnt necessary.  it would fit fine in a regular crust.  i baked it for 15 minutes at 350 degrees and then turned it down to 300 for 50 minutes.  perfect.

I'm a native of North Carolina but I live in New Zealand and we don't have access to Karo or traditional corn syrup.  I found this recipe and it's the best pecan pie I've ever had, and all my American friends here agree.  It's not sickly sweet like most pecan pies, and the only change I've made to the recipe is adding a dash of whiskey or bourbon when I add the pecans at the end.

I liked the taste but I recommend 1.5x the ingredients because I have a small pie pan and the amounts listed here didn't even fill the pan.

Finally a pie that isn't overtly sweet!  I really like this recipe.  It is true, the pie doesn't look like the traditional pecan pie with a nice layer of pecans at top.  But this isn't a traditional recipe!  The fact that it doesn't call for corn syrup is what I hold this recipe to be superior among others.  The flavor is buttery and sweet without being overpowering.  I doubled on the pecans which cut back the sweetness even further and made the pie more dense.  I also followed other reviewer's advise and baked at 350 for 15 mins, then lowered the temperature to 300 for 45 mins.

This was fabulous. Other reviews said it was crumbly, but I didn't have any problems like that. (If its crumbly it may be overcooked. Pecan pie is done when the whole pie jiggles as one semi solid piece. If the middle jiggles on its own its not set. I found that these pies, and I baked two at a time were done after 10 minutes at 400 as per the recipe plus another 20-30 minutes rather than the 30-40 minutes stated.)  This will be the only recipe of pecan pie I make.

My sister made this for Thanksgiving because it didn't use corn syrup.  It was delicious and I found that I liked it better than the usual with corn syrup.  I only got one little piece on T-Day, so I think I'll make it again :) Thanks Elaine for a wonderful recipe!

This was an easy pie to make and to eat. Still rich. I did place pecan halves on the top before baking, at 350 for 15 minutes then down to 300 for 50 minutes. It came out very nice and looked great. I did make my ususal homemade crust. Thanks for sharing.

TO DIE FOR!  I just love the fact that there is no corn syrup!  I made a double batch and it filled my deep dish 9 inch glass pie pan perfectly.  I followed the suggestions to cook at 350 for 15 then 300 for 55 - it wrked perfectly!  I also added more nuts on top which may not have been necessary as the nuts sort of float to the top as it bakes.  Make sure when you add the melted butter to the whipped eggs the butter has cooled or you will get scrambled eggs!  I tempered the eggs and it was fine.  I used the recipe for  Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust  instead of a store bought.  Why go to the trouble to make scratch pie and use a store bought crust?  the recipe is very easy and is my favorite.

This was the first time I had ever made pecan pie. I am not a pecan pie eater but my husband is and my sister wanted homemade for Thanksgiving. I did a "test" run this week since the recipe is so different from the traditional recipe. It was a big hit with my husband and I even liked it! I made it just like the recipe with no changes and it was delish!

This is very over rated and to be honest Mrs Edwards pecan pie in the frozen section of Krogers is better. This was my 1st pecan pie and although i did add too many pecans and added whole ones I thought this pie had more of a cakelike quality or brownie in a pie crust kinda feel and looks very unappealing, my freinds didnt even wanna taste it. It doesnt taste bad but Ive had waaayyyy better. Iwish it would have let me give a 2 and 1 half rating but I rated lower to even out all the people on here with ither bad taste buds or just inexperience in good pecan pies.

I made this pie because I found myself without Karo syrup.  It was wonderful and not as sweet.  I do suggest just before putting in the oven, placing pecan halves on top so that it is prettier.   My mom makes it using splenda brown and white and it is equally as delicious and diabetic friendly.  Now no need to run out of Karo, now I don't have to buy it.  Last Thanksgiving I was told it was reminisent of Pioneer pecan pie, by a lovely great great grandmother.  One would guess she would know :)

This pie was super yummy!!  Made it for my dad who loves pecan pie. I followed all the directions except I added two cups of whole pecans, and I think next time I will add yet another cup of pecans.  I took a reviewer's advice and baked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes and at 300 degrees for 55 minutes.  It was perfect!  The edges didn't burn or get too crispy. I used a deep dish glass pie pan, and  I found that there wasn't quite enough filling for it.  So I will probably just use a regular pie pan next time.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  I was looking for one that didn't have corn syrup in it.  I will definitely be making this for Thanksgiving and Christmas : )

I will make this again, but I will take the advice of some reviewers and tweak the baking time. It was perfect on the inside, but the top was rock hard and tasted a little burnt. :) Still delicious.

Perfect! Love that it has no corn syrup.  It doesn't taste gummy at all, which is always what turned me off about pecan pie. I had to lie to my dad and tell him it had corn syrup though, he wouldn't eat it otherwise! Thanks for the recipe.

This is an excellent recipe! Highly recommend! I've made this twice, following the recipe exactly the first time-5 stars. The second time, while the eggs were beating, I mixed sugars & flour with a whisk, then added melted butter and mixed. This seemed to keep the sugar from having a grainy texture. I added an extra 1/4c of pecans also. Whether or not you change a thing, this recipe is super!!

You won't be disappointed in this pie!  I hardly ever leave reviews, but after eating this pie over and over again, I felt I must.  Follow the recipe as is, but add an extra 1/4 c of pecans.  Also, one reviewer suggested 400 degrees for 10 minutes, 350 for 20 minutes, 325 for 10 minutes, and it was perfect!  Lastly, mix the butter and sugar first and then add the egg.  Enjoy!

This was delicious! I followed others instructions cooking it at 350 for 15 minutes and then reducing heat to 300 and cooking for 50-55 minutes. It beat any pecan pie I have ever had!

I'm a big fan of pecan pie but find it too goopy sweet to eat very often.  This recipe IS a good improvement BUT it is not pecan pie.  More like, pecan cake in a pie shell.  It's consistency is also really crumbly so it tastes great with ice cream but it won't hold its shape.  So for those of you thinking about making this -- do so!  It's great!  But don't think that you are making something that others will consider a good pecan pie because it's too different.

This recipe was pretty easy, amounts were good, filled the pie exactly. The problem I had was not the taste but how it looked. I didn't put any pecans on the top before baking, thought I'd add them when the pie firmed up a little. The problem was that putting it in at 400 immediately put a hard crust on the pie so putting pecans on was no longer a possibility. I'm used to seeing pecan pies with a soft top, not a leathery brown hard top. Other than appearances, the pie tastes great. So I might try it again with the suggestions of reviewers to bake it longer at a less hot temperature.

Really good!  Follow the cooking instructions provided in the recipe, not the suggestions to lower the temperature.  The first time I made it, I used a lower temperature and it didn't set.  The second time I followed the recipe (400 then down to 350) and it was perfect.  When I stuck a knife in it, the inside was still runny but it looked done so I took it out.  It set up perfect once it cooled.  Tasted even better after refrigerating.

Did not care for this at all.  I think that maybe using half white sugar and half brown sugar it would cut down on that molasses flavor, which is what I didn't care for.

This pie came out pretty well when I made it; however, nowhere does the recipe recommend putting pecans on top for the traditional pecan pie effect--I had to garner the information from various pictures posted.

This pie forms an amazing cookie-ish layer on top and is so delicious!  For me, it blew the corn syrup varieties away.

Eight years later, I'm still making this pie for the Thanksgiving dinner. Still making without a crust. Still love it!!! I usually double the recipe. 

This was my review from 2009. Very yummy!!! I'm hooked! Very tasty.  I used less sugar though and it's still pretty sweet.  I baked it in my Kitchen Aid toaster oven. The temp. should be adjusted for that - about 300 F for 30 -40 min. after 350 for 15 min. Also helps to cover the edges of crust with foil for the first 15 min. of baking.  The second time I made this pie I just made it without the crust - I just love this filling so much. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

The pie was great,  I made my pie in a 9 inch glass pie dish, yet after making my pie filling, it only filled half of the dish so I had to go back and make another batch just so the pie filled up to the top of my pie crust. This recipe does not fill a 9 inch glass pie dish. Because I doubled the filling, I ended up baking it for about 10 - 15 minutes longer than the recipe said to. Since I had so many issues with the recipe, I was very nervous while the pie was baking, but it still turned out very well. I don’t like that jelly-like consistency that corn syrup pecan pies tend to have, and this pie didn’t have that. It had a nice consistency and a wonderful flavor.

This is an AWESOME pecan pie recipe.  I have made this pie recipe before and each time the pies turns out great!  I add 1 and 1/2 cup of pecans as oppossed to the 1 cup and cook at 350 for 15 min and then 300 for 45 minutes, as others have suggested.  I am from the north and my husband is a southern boy, so luckily I found this exceptional recipe which is a hit with his family as well!

Love this pie it tastes just like a pecan pie. I never buy Karo syrup so I never make pecan pie. I found this recipe while browsing on here and saved it. Well last night I made it and yum yum yum. My pecans did not rise to the top..? 2nd one is in the oven and I used more pecans I hope they rise.

I used 2 cups of pecan halves and a deep dish crust.   I baked on 350 for 15 minutes and 300 for 50 minutes as others recommended.  The pie came out perfect (the crust was not too everdone)!  I highly recommend this recipe.

My new favorite pecan pie!  Took it to a party and come home with an empty pan, plus had requests for this recipe from several people.   Before I added the pecans, I toasted them. I also toasted an extra 1/2 cup and added them during the last 10 min of baking, just to have "Extra" nuts on top of the pie.

Since corn syrup is hard to obtain here, I've been looking for such a recipe for years. However, when I made this pie, I found that I missed the sticky richness of corn syrup based recipes. If you do make this, throw in 1/2 c. chocolate chips and extra pecans.

I'm not a fan of pecan pie so I made this for my brother who is a "pecan pie connoisseur" & with the first bite he said it was the best he had ever had.  The only thing I did different was doubled the recipe & made 2 pies.  I would suggest putting the pie shells on a baking dish while in the oven to help with spills.  Thanks for the recipe!

This pie is delicious, but there's a little glitch in the instructions.  It says to preheat oven to 350, but it should be 400, as that should be the temp when the pie first goes in the oven. Mis-info like that can throw a novice bake like me into a panic! Also the ingredient list should say melted butter.  Those fixes are minor, and as I said, this pie is absolutely wonderful. I took the leftovers to work because I was afraid I would eat the whole thing in a day!

This was delicious!I followed the recipe exactly. I used a Mrs. Smith's deep dish frozen pie crust and of course topped with some extra pecans. I brought it to my mom's for Easter dessert and everyone loved it. Will definately make again!

This wasn't the best pecan pie recipe I've tasted. The pie was too sweet, and not nutty enough. Also, it didn't make enough batter to fill a 9in pie crust. But after a few modifications, I think this could be a really good recipe

This is the first time I've made a pecan pie that didn't require Karo syrup.  Guess what?  This one is waaaaay better ! Easy and delicious. It reminds me of a pecan pie that my husband and I had many years ago at a restaurant and I could never duplicate it.  Until now!  Thanks.

This is the best-tasting pecan pie because it is not sticky, guey like corn syrup versions.  It also helps people with corn allergies to enjoy this kind of pie again.  Also, I found that using Land o'Lakes salted butter makes it taste the best.  My co-workers have commented on how wonderful it was, and one said that it was the best he had ever eaten; I treat them every now and then with homemade goodies. My pies also have alot better look than the photo uploaded on the page.  Mine has an smooth like glaze look to it, and evenly browned.  Remember, the pecans have to be chopped; I chop mine small in my KitchenAid Food Processor, small bowl attachment.

I am not a fan of traditional pecan pies (the gooey corn syrup filling...bleeh!), but my husband loves them, so they're a Thanksgiving tradition for us.  This year, I decided to try this recipe instead of Mom's, and what a wonderful surprise!  This is a pie the whole family LOVES!  I did make a small change in the cooking temp - 400 for first 10 min. and reduced to 300 for about 35 min. (until top cracked). Definately a keeper - just don't tell Mom...

I'm from the south and this pie is great! So easy, tastes just like grandma's. I use a cookie crust made with butter and crushed cookies. I also cover the top layer of the pie with pecans. I served it at an international Thanksgiving dinner and it was the best dessert! Everyone raved about it!

I've made this a couple of times and it gets great reviews. It is so much better without the super sweetness of the Karo syrup

Hi Elaine:  Just add my thanks to the rest.  I have been cutting out corn syrup, so have been looking for a recipe without it for a few months.  THIS IS DELICIOUS PIE  That said, I did every modification to reduce calories that I could, and it still tasted lots better than traditional pecan pie.  Changes as follows: Whey Low brown and white sugar substitute Egg substitute, Smart Balance for butter, no crust Extra vanilla, non-fat milk and 2 tbsp of bourbon (probably undid all the other good things I did-lol) A delicious pie.  Thanks again  Judy in WA

Not too bad, I missed the 'usual' texture of pecan pie, this one was somewhat dry and gummy. The flavor was good though.

My grandmother has always made the pecan pies for holidays but wasn't able to this year and the task fell to me. I decided to go looking for a different spin and ended up going with this one. No one could believe how good it was! They all said it beat Grandma's Karo pies by a mile, sshhhh ;)

This was a great alternative to the traditional corn syrup version of a pecan pie. I really enjoyed the flavor, but the texture was a bit crumbly when it was heated before serving. Overall, I was pleased with this recipe and I will be making it again soon!

I decided to try this pie using Macadamia nuts instead of pecans. It isn't as overpowering-ly sweet as traditional recipes.  Everyone absolutely loved it and requested the recipe...I'm going to make some for Christmas gifts this year.  Definately going to be a staple in my recipe book!

This was a hit at Thanksgiving.  Here is what you need to know:  if you have crazy picky people who are expecting the supersweet gel-like base of a traditional corn syrup pecan pie, find another recipe. If that is not the case, this pie is delicious.  Sugar caramelizes when it cooks, corn syrup does not.  This pie is rich and dense with a deeper, not so sticky sweet flavor.

My dad loves pecan pie so I was excited to make this for him.  He thought it was just "eh".  He likes the consistency of the corn syrup-based pecan pie better, and I'd have to agree.  Maybe we're creatures of habit, but the consistency of this pie was just a little weird for me.  Too soft.  I added more pecans as many of the reviewers suggested, and still felt like I didn't get enough of the pecan flavor.  The corn syrup-based fillings seems to bring out the pecan flavor better for some reason, even though I don't like the idea of using corn syrup.  Not a bad recipe, just not for me.

We were not a big fan of this one.  The reason I love pecan pie is the filling- sticky, sweet and loads of it.  This one barely had any filling.  I would call it dry.  I was dissapointed.  I will stick with the Karo syrup recipe from now on.  Thanks for sharing.

This is NOT your typical pecan pie!  But WOW!  It was great.  It's more like a Pecan Brownie Pie.  It was a huge hit with butter pecan ice cream.  I used the chocolate chips, as others suggested and found it interesting that the women all loved the chocolate, but the men said it would be better without them.  Next time, I will look for carmel chips.  We all agreed that carmel would be a better choice.  This is an easy recipe, and got raves from everyone!

This pie was awesome, and so easy to make. My husband liked that it wasn't as sweet as other Pecan Pies. I baked it an hour ago and it's already half gone!
Thanks, for the great recipe.

We have baked this several times and each time it turns out excellent. The only thing I suggest is to slightly reduce the amount of sugar (both brown and white) otherwise its too sweet. Our family loves this and my wife asks for more and more...

I've made this wonderful pie so many times, but I double it and bake it in a big square pan; it's perfect as is, but you can also add about 1/2 cup honey to make it even more gooey!  Thanks!

This is hands down the BEST Pecan Pie recipe that I've ever tried!! The use of only sugar and NO corn syrup is what sets this recipe above the rest.Unlike pecan pies made with corn syrup, the filling isn't runny. The pie actually sets in a reasonable amount of time.It tasted perfect and looked perfect!Thank you sooo much for this recipe.It will be the only Pecan Pie recipe I use from now on.

Delicious recipe! It's much lighter and not as sickeningly sticky sweet as the pecan pie I'm used to. The only downside is that the top is not as "pretty" and appetizing as the other pecan pies I've seen. All in all, it's a very good pie, though!

This is probably the best pecan pie I've ever had, I'd never made one before, but, it couldn't have been any easier.

Based on the suggestions, I added more pecans, cooked it at 350 for 10 minutes, then 300 for 55 minutes & I used a Mrs. Smith's Deep pie crust, it turned out absolutely perfect.

My husband and I are pretty picky - I had made a Kahlua pecan pie recently that was frankly not that good.  I still had a pie crust/pecans left and saw this recipe and thought "let's try this one!"  Oh, my it is really really great!  A keeper for sure!  I cut the white sugar to 1/8 cup and added a pinch of salt and another 1/2 cup of pecans but otherwise kept everything the same.  I think this would win a prize in a baking contest - it's that good!  

Thank you!!

I have been trying for years to make a successful pecan pie as it is my sidekick's favorite. This recipe is the best pie I have ever made. I had to bake it for just a bit longer than recipe but I covered the pie's crust with foil as soon as it started to look browned so it wouldn't burn. I love it served with ice cream!

this is the best pecan pie i've ever tasted and my husband agrees.. the first time it burned so the second time i followed other users advice and cooked at 350 for 10 minutes then at 300 for 50.. PERFECT!

*UPDATE* i have made this pie probably 2 dozen times for various get togethers and parties and people say it is the best pecan pie. the only recipe for pecan pie i will ever use.

This recipe is very different from traditional pecan pie.  I'm afraid I like the kind made with corn syrup better.  It just doesn't have the jelly consistency that the traditional pecan pie has.  The top was also strange.  I was disappointed because this pie had such high ratings.  I will go with a more traditional recipe next time.

i honestly never liked pecan pie until i made this. instead of baking at 450 for 10 mins then reducing it to 350, i set the oven to 300 degrees and baked for about 50 minutes, just until the top started cracking. that way it didnt burn the crust or any of the pecans on top. the no syrup recipe is very good. funny, but it tastes better the next day. ( i didnt know that worked with pies lol)

I was a bit hesitant to try this, as I am a HUGE fan of the corn syrup/sticky version of pecan pie. However, I was pleasantly surprised and found this version quite delicious and addicting! It is not sticky at all, and a bit  "lighter" in texture then the corn syrup version, but still has a dense filling. I used the tip of baking it at 400 degrees for 10 mins then turning the oven down to 300 degrees for the remainder of the time. I used 1 and a half cups of pecans and omitted the white sugar as I added some chocolate chips/chunks, a keeper!

This was awesome. I'm usually not a huge fan of pecan pie but this was delicious. I have already made 2 in the last week. I followed someone's suggestion and turned my oven down to 300 and I had to cook it longer than I had anticipated, but it was worth the wait! I also covered mine with foil after about 25 minutes and left it covered until it was done. Thanks!

Wow, this pie really was amazing. I changed hardly anything, but I used dark brown sugar and added a tablespoon of corn syrup to help give it a gooey center, which I like. I don't necessarily know if it needed it since I'm not very experienced as a chef, however the end result was exactly what I was looking for: firm with a crust on the outside, soft on the inside but not liquidy or like glue. It was perfect.

The only problem I ran into was that I had to double to recipe to fill a glass pie pan. Perhaps it was a deep-dish but for what I believe was a 9-inch pie pan, I would suggest doubling or at least making 1.5 times the said amounts.

Otherwise an amazing pie that everyone loved, even former pecan-pie-haters!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving 2007. Followed the recommendations for temperature change and they worked out great. One little change I made to help reduce calories even further. For thew white sugar part I only use 2 tablespoons of Splenda for Baking and for the Brown Sugar I usedonly one half cup brown sugar and one quarter cup of Splenda Brown Sugar for Baking worked out fantastic

Fantastic! My first attempt at pecan pie. All the pecans pies I had seen before looked slimy. Not this one. It set up beautifully after cooling I cut a piece and it didn't run all over the pan. The only variations I made were to bring eggs to room temperature, and reduced my oven to 300 after the intial ten minutes and cook a little longer. Just in time for Thanksgiving. Thanks!

This pie was extremely easy to make and turned out delicious. My entire family loved it and requested that I make it again for holiday gatherings. However, the bake time suggested is a little off. I use an electric oven which cooks fast, so I set the temperature to 350 and baked for 40 minutes. It still came out a little burnt around the edges so next time I'll decrease the bake time to 30-35 minutes. But overall a wonderfully easy pecan pie!!

This is the first pecan pie I have ever made.  I doubled the pecans, used a pre-made pie crust, and baked at 300 degrees.  It turned out good, although I think there were actually too many pecans in it. Good recipe, although I think I am going to try some of the others.

I made this recipe to take to some relatives who avoid eating corn syrup and I wasn't expecting it to be the best pecan pie I have ever eaten, but it was! Everyone raved. Thanks so much. I also reduced the temperature and baked it longer, as suggested. No more store bought pecan pies for us - this is too easy and good!

This was only the second time I attwmpted Pecan Pie. The previous pie was made with corn syrup and didn't turn out as I had hoped... I made this one this evening and it is simply brilliant! it is super easy and so delicious. I took other reviewers tip and added 1/2 cup of pecan halves on top, made it extra yummy! Also did the 350 for 10 min and 300 for 45 min.
just Perfect! Thanks!

I was a bit disappointed because of the reviews stating that this was the best pecan pie ever.  We liked the taste but it's definitely not like your traditional pecan pie so you just have to change your mindset from eating pecan pie to eating a pie made from pecans.  It's good and since I live in an area where corn syrup is nearly impossible to find it works well for me.  Just know it is not like the pecan pie you've grown up loving.

I did a little tweaking after baking it the first time and reading reviews.  I made one and a half recipes and eliminated the flour.  The first attemps was too dry and the second one was super delicious.  I also followed the advice of baking it at 300 for 45 minutes after the first fifteen minutes.  This one is a keeper.

DELICIOUS!!! I took the suggestion of others and baked it at 350 and then 300. I also added more pecans and about a tablespoon and a half of rum. This is now my favorite pecan pie recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Ok first of all, I am the worst baker ever and everyone at Thanksgiving RAVED about this!  People talked about it for days after!  This is wonderful-and SO easy!  If you love Pecan Pie, it is sweet and nutty with a bit of a crispy crunch.  Everyone was also impressed that no corn syrup was used.  So yummy and I WILL make this again!

Love it, Love it! I got so many great compliments on this recipe. I have to go and make another pie for a friend who absolutely loved it.  Now the only thing that I did differently was I used Splenda Baking Sugar instead of regular sugar.  But the taste was still the same, EXCELLENT!

This is probably the best pecan pie I have ever had. I made it exactly like the recipe said. I love the way it isn't so sweet like regular pecan pie. It's sweet, but it's more of a buttery sweet flavor, which is delicious. I highly recommend it. My family loved it.

this was good. it has a brownie like texture. i think next time i will double the recipe and put it in a 9" square baking pan. it was to thin for a 9" pie pan. but it was still very good.

This was definitely the best pecan pie I have ever tasted! For my first one, I even accidentally only used 1/2 a cup of brown sugar instead of a full cup, and it still turned out! Of course, my second one, I made sure to use everything correctly, and it was awesome...definitely a recipe I will use over and over!

This was absolutely positively the best pecan pie ever!  Not sickly syrupy sweet. Everyone at Christmas dinner asked for the recipe.  Only changes - used one and one half cups of pecans and put a few on top for decoration.

i occasionally see reviewers comment how they would give a recipe 10 stars if they could. to me, this recipe falls into that category. the end result was absolutely fabulous & exceeded my family's expectations! on top of that i made this pie a week ahead of time, freezing it to serve on thanksgiving day! two slight modifications: stirring in a 1/2 cup of double chocolate chips & arranging pecan halves in a circular pattern over the top of the pie before baking. many thanks for sharing your excellent recipe with us elaine!

This recipe was ok. I followed it the recipe w/out changing anything and it was better the next day. Not a pretty pie, if I make it again I will do what another person said. I will add pecans at the end before baking. If you don't, it will look like a foamy brown pie.

flavorful, rich, but grainy in the texture, and mine turned out greasy. i would attempt it again, and tweak the recipe a bit.

In all the years I have made pecan pie, I have never not used corn syrup.  This was a first and it made a spectacular pecan pie.  I don't think I will ever use corn syrup again!  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

This recipe makes the best pecan pie ever, bar none! I was skeptical at first, but once I tasted it I knew I would never make the old "corn syrup" version again. Try it, you will be amazed as well.

This is my first attempt at pecan pie, so I'd never made one with corn syrup before, and now I think I never will.  This pecan pie is sweet and delicious without being sickeningly sweet and sitting in one's stomach like a rock afterwards.  The only problem with it is that because it's so light, it's hard to know when to stop!

This recipe is wonderful!  I've made it for the past several holiday dinners -- everyone loves it b/c it's not too sweet, and it's very easy to make.

WOW!!! I am not really a pecan pie person- mainly because I don't care too much for corn syrup. My grandmother wanted a pecan pie for Thanksgiving, so this is what I chose. I'm so glad!!! And it cuts beautifully- no runniness. Thank you so much for submitting!

This was wonderful and my family adored it. I did use candied pecans instead of regular pecans, which added a little more sweetness. Overall, I will never go back to my old pecan pie recipe... this one is here to stay.

So I truly enjoyed this pie. I will be honest and say the soufflé texture on top turned me off. I will never bake with corn syrup and this will be my go-to. Room temp eggs didn't make a difference to me. Simply pour the melted butter in slowly as the mixer goes to distribute the heat without cooking the egg. I too feel that baking lower - 300 - was best. Takes approx 75 min with my oven. And i learned the hard way that its best to let it set over night. Wonderful and can trade the top texture with the corn syrup. Instead of whole pecans on top, i'll wait and add them half way during cooking so they don't sink into the soufflé.

I have never made a pecan pie before this recipe (and rarely made many other pies either). My husband is from the south and a lover of pecan pie so I thought I’d try it out. I actually doubled the recipe because some family was visiting. Oh my goodness! It was perfection! So simple and turned out beautifully. I don’t like to change much when trying out a recipe for the first time, but I did modify cooking temp based on reviews. I did 15 minutes at 350 followed by 55 at 300. I was worried because the pecans seemed to float at the top when I poured the mixture in the pie crust, but this didn’t change anything. The pie looked lovely and tasted delicious! My husband likes it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Definitely will be making it again soon!

I followed the recipe but tripled it to make two large pies. Also followed the advice given here to cook it slower on 300* and used 30 oz of pecans, so more than the recipe calls for. I placed a layer of pecans directly on the crust, poured the filling over that, then added the rest of the pecans to the top, gently pressing them into the filling so they were not just sitting on top. I prefer my pecans to not be chopped, so kept them mainly halved. I really like the no corn syrup method- mainly why I chose this since I don't usually use corn syrup when baking. Will definitely be making this again!

Loooove this recipe, it’s the only pecan pie recipe you need, versatile so if you want chocolate in it, put some chocolate chips! I’ve also done it where I’ve added some bourbon. And I love that it has no karo syrup or corn syrup

I made it with a Gluten Free Crust.  Delicious!
It did not look like the picture though, because it foamed up in the oven and looked like a top crust, so couldn't see the pecans.  (not sure why)

I have made this recipe many times, I have made just 1 pie all the way up to 9 pies at a time. it always delights. Many people say it is the best pecan pie they have had. I have also used the recipe to make tarts. It always turns out good.

This pie turned the party. I doubled the recipe and just made 2 pies, brought them to separate Pi Day events (I know many, many nerds), and they slayed at both events! This one was so easy and delicious that it’s in my rotation from now on! Delicious warm (15 seconds in the mic), cool or room temp.

This pie is really good if you double the filling but don’t double the nuts. Made the first time as the recipe read and it seemed to have a lot of nuts and not enough filling. Had great flavor though!

Agree with reviewers. 350 for 15 minutes, add pecans to top, then 50 minutes at 300. Also, cut the white sugar, use 3/4 cup Brown sugar and 1/4 cup maple syrup. Love it.

Delicious! I’ve never made pecan pie before but the family loves it so I thought I’dmake it for Thanksgiving.  It’s super easy and I appreciate that it doesn’t require a bunch of fancy nut arranging on the top. I also increased the amount of nuts to 1-1/2 cups as others suggested and sprinkled some halves on top, but next time I will choose one or the other as it had too many nuts. Be sure to whip the eggs to get a nice crunchy top.

My family loved this recipe.  I wish I would have just added all the pecans in to the mixture vs placing them on top, they got a little too dark for my taste.  But I will definitely be making this again!

From reading the other reviews, I made 4 adjustments. First, I doubled the recipe for the 10" pie plate I used. Second, I used 3/4 cup of dark brown sugar, 1/2 cup of Splenda and skipped the white sugar altogether. Third, I topped the pie with 1/2 to 3/4 cup of extra pecan halves.  Fourth, I reduced the temp and increased the time of baking.  I baked the pie for 10 min at 350 and then for 50-55 min at 300.

This was my first time making Pecan pie... I overcooked it, but it still got rave reviews at Thanksgiving! For first-timers: When you stick a knife in the middle, it will come out wet even when it's done.

I added a 1/3 cup more chopped pecans in the pie, then layered the top with whole pecans in a spiral. I brushed the top with egg whites and boom! Gorgeous!

It didn’t set well at all. The top nearly burned and it was about the ugliest pie I’ve ever seen! I give it 2 stars because it tastes really good!  Just  too ugly to leave the house.  Bless it.

This was okay I made for Thanksgiving lunch. I probably will not make again. I miss the silky and smooth flow of pie you get when made with syrup as it slide over tongue and palate. The rich taste is not in this pie. Even though I don't like the calories if  I am going to eat I want in a pecan pie.

The best pecan pie recipe out there.  Love that it has no corn syrup in it, but it tastes soooo good.  I cooked mine at 350 degrees for 15  minutes then 300 degrees  for about 55 minutes as previously suggested and it turned out perfect, not burned just delicious!  Oh I also added an extra 1/2 cup of pecans on top after filling!

Really enjoy this recipe. So easy. So good! I increased this recipe by half (minus the butter portion) so it was a nice full pie. In addition, I followed another reviewers cooking times: 10 minutes at 400°, 20 minutes at 350° and 10 minutes at 325°. Thanks for sharing!!

Good recipe, I did a few things differently however.  I was short on chopped pecans so I added a few chopped walnuts to achieve a full cup.  I also Added about 1/2 to 3/4 oz of good quality Bourbon. And I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk because i only had fat free milk on hand. Baked it for 15 minutes at 350 , then for about 40 minutes at 300.

I agree with everyone else! MUCH abetted than the corn syrup method! The only comment I would have is that the top didn't seem to look as pretty, it had a cake type look, couldn't see the nuts. Maybe I just need to add more next time.  I will definitely be making it this way from now on though!

My husband proclaimed it "amazing" and he's been waiting awhile for me to attempt pecan pie. I followed the suggestion of the reviewer to bake at 350 for 10 minutes - at which point, I removed the pie to add halved pecans to the top and reduced the heat to 300 and baked for 60 more minutes. Love the elimination of the Caro syrup!

I was just starting my Christmas eve baking when I realised that I forgot to buy the corn syrup. Not wanting to go back out to the store again in the holiday madness, I found this recipe. I may never use corn syrup again. Lovely velvety texture, and the brown sugar complements the pecans without overpowering with sticky sweetness. If you like sticky sweetness (I'm not a fan) you may find this disappointing from the traditional recipe, but I liked this better than any pecan pie I've made. Marvellous.

I love this recipe. I have made this pie multiple times by now. I did take other reviewers suggestions and made sure the melted butter cooled off a bit so the eggs would not cook while mixing. I turned the temperature down after the first 10 minutes for 330 degrees and baked for about an hour. I would definitely use foil on top to keep it from browning too much. It's always a hit when I bring this to parties and meetings.

I absolutely love this pie I was not a fan of pecan pies being to sweet an all, this I great I use Splenda for both sugars and it is so good! My dad is diabetic is why I chose to make it with Splenda. I also made one like the recipe and it was to sweet using Splenda brown sugar and Splenda sugar made it perfect everyone LOVED it!! Best pecan I have ever had!!!

Thank you so much, a pecan pie I can eat!  I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and followed the lead of another user and made mini-pies in greased muffin tins-they turned out great.  I left out the pecans, put the filling in a pitcher to neatly pour it into the mini pie shells until mostly full, then I went back and topped each with pecans.  It too me two recipe pie crusts.  Baked at 350 F for 25 mins.  Turned out LOVELY, can't wait to share with guests at Thanksgiving!

When great-grandma died, our family lost more than our matriarch, we lost our famed pie maker. No one else in my family would touch Pecan Pie with a ten foot pole, so I (at the ripe age of 25) naively stepped up. 

I try hard to use nice, basic ingredients when cooking, and  have never enjoyed the gooey Pecan Pies I had been served. 

This is THE Pecan Pie my family craves. Every single year! I'm a magician to some family members who refuse to believe it's a simple pie. But hey, I'll take it! 

I always cover my crust, and after filling the pie, float whole pecan pieces on top of the pie to make decorative patterns. Rave reviews every time!

Be sure to beat the eggs long enough, until foamy. It's kinda important.

This pecan pie is freakin' delicious! I never cared for pecan pie but my bf requested it so I tried my best to make him 1.  I've already made 2 since i discovered this recipe a few days ago. I followed the directions exact. I added halved pecans on top like many of the photos I saw. I used a pie crust recipe I found here on allrecipes.com called "Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust" which I highly recommend. I followed the advice of other reviewers and baked the pie at 350 for 15 min and then 300 for 45 min. If you make your own crust bake the crust alone, without the pie filling, for 10 min at 350.I liked that I didn't have to buy corn syrup like most of the other recipes. Tip: Pecans are expensive but I found a great deal at Costco; Pecan halves 2lbs for $13.

This is the BEST pecan pie that I've ever had and it manages to retain that kind of ooey gooey goodness of the filling without requiring corn syrup (something I prefer to avoid in my food).

I have to confess - pecan pie was always a "meh" kind of food for me, and I made it because I had old pecans in the pantry and because my mom adores pecan pie. Well, this recipe showed me that my problem was not that I don't like pecan pie that much, but that I've never had a really good one. 

I didn't have corn syrup and wasn't about to go out and buy some (I'm serious when I say that I don't even know what people use it for), so I looked for a recipe without it. This was amazing! So amazing, in fact, that I am actually rating/reviewing a recipe on here for the first time. 

I don't like my sweets too sweet so I mostly cut out the extra white sugar, and enjoyed it so much that I had to restrain myself from eating half the pie in one go. I used Deb Perelman's crust recipe from Smitten Kitchen, which was also great (not least because it yielded enough crust for three separate pies).  

Agreed with the reviewers that the temperature may be a bit high - I followed instructions and it was just a bit overdone, but I'm still giving it 5 stars because the flavour was THAT good. Thanks for making me change my mind about pecan pie!

i followed advise to double the pecans. made it more nutty but everyone loved it at thanksgiving. would like to try it with homemade pie dough. Followed additional advice " Preheat oven to 350 deg. F, and place pie in oven for 10 minutes. - Remove pie from oven and turn temp. down to 300 deg. F, place halved pecans on top for a more appealing pie. - Bake at 300 for 50 minutes longer or until the pie is puffed and set. "

Make 1.5x the filling recipe and add extra pecans.  Instead of baking at 350 for 30 minutes bake at 300 for 50 minutes. Everyone commented on it :)

So unbelievably good! Make sure you really whip everything together real good, and you'll have a nice layer of delicious meringue-like topping after baking.  
This is an absolute favourite in my house; I get requests to make it all the time. 
I always preheat the oven to 350, bake for ten minutes, and turn it down to 300 for a nice long and slow bake. It usually takes about an hour, but you'll know it's done when the top starts to crack.

I have been experimenting with bacon in a lot of stuff lately.  The best is Christmas cookies and pecan pie!  Try pouring a couple tablespoons of warm bacon grease in the pie plate before you lay in your best home made crust.  then finely grate up 6-10 pieces of bacon and put them in with your pecans.  Hey, who eats pie because it's healthy, make it taste awesome!

Sure it has the right amount of sweetness. But it's also very dry. Every picture in the picture section seems to also show dry pecan pie so I don't think it was my doing.

I, personally, didn't care for the taste... a bit too "buttery" for me. Also, it did not make a pretty pie... it had the soufflé type top.

Great recipe--thanks!  I reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 c. and baked at 350 the first 15 min., then 300 for 50 min. as others suggested.  Perfect and so yummy!  (I always cover the crust edges with tin foil til the last 10-15 min.)  I used almond milk and ap gf flour and it was fine.

This is an excellent pie recipe as far as tasted and texture, and I love the fact that it does not contain corn syrup. The only negative I would note is that it does not make enough filling to fill up the entire pie pan. I was using a pan that is on the small side, and I still had to up the quantities by 1/2. If I were using my larger glass pie pan, I am sure I would probably need to double the recipe.

I used this recipe to make mini pies using the small pie tart crusts. Using half of this recipe, it made seven mini pies. The flavor was amazing, rich and buttery filling that was incredible. The best pecan pie I've had. Next time I use this for mini pies, I will chop the pecans, smaller pieces would work better in the smaller pies.

This was good. Without the corn syrup it wasn't too sweet and you could actually taste the pecans! The only thing I would change next time is to use a sweet/spiced dessert pie crust. I just used a regular pie crust, and the combination of the two wasn't sweet enough.

You don't understand: You NEED to make this pie. My previous go-to recipe was a chocolate pecan pie with an all butter crust.  I didn't think that could be improved on.  Then I made THIS PIE.  My husband, who does not like pecan pie, publicly declared this to be the best dessert he had ever tasted: at thanksgiving - in front of his mother.  I was thrilled....I just had to pretend I didn't hear him.  We can't insult Mama's cooking.  I did add a handful of dark chocolate chips on the bottom: I couldn't help myself.  I added 3/4 cups of chopped pecans to the filling mix instead of one whole cup.  I baked the pie for 15 minutes at 350, and removed the pie and added 3/4 cups pecan halves to the top to make it pretty. I lowered the oven temp to 300 and baked it for 50 minutes, only to be rewarded with PIE PERFECTION.  No strange gelatinous insides, no fused-together pecan mass on top. This was what a real homemade pie should taste like. This will become a holiday tradition for us.

This was great. I had been looking for a recipe without corn syrup. The only thing I changed is that I left the pecans whole and added 6 oz of chopped dark chocolate. The sugar was a little gritty so if I make it again I would add the hot melted butter to the sugars and stir until combined, then add the other ingredients.

I tried this & it was well received.  After following the recipe I made the following changes:   All brown sugar (gives it a deeper flavor), toasted the chopped nuts & increased to 1 1/3 cups (richer flavor & helps carry sweetness), when turning down the oven I took the pie out and arranged halved pecans decoratively on top of the pie.  Also followed 400 for 10 minutes 325 for 55 minutes.  Everyone's oven varies slightly, read the recipe/reviews & you'll get the idea.  Pie will be set at edges & jiggle in the center.  It will set up as it cools.

Used dark brown sugar instead of light but, other that, I did everything as directed and it turned out PERFECT! This pie was a hit at our Thanksgiving gathering!  I will definitely be making this again!

Following reviewer's advice, I omitted the white sugar  and baked at 350 for 10 minutes and then 300 for 50 minutes.  It was good but dry and crumbly.  I'm not sure where I went wrong but there are a few other reviewers who had this problem as well.  Maybe I would try again for less time at 300.

Just the right amount of sweetness, way better than any store bought pie. I'm new to cooking and baking so I was a bit nervous making this but it was easy to do.

My son requested a pecan pie for his  33 rd  birthday & after tasting this home made pie,  he let me know I could no longer "buy" a pecan pie  ever again!! He LOVED it ??& so did I!  Only changes i  thought were necessary were  first 10 min @ 400- then 10 min @ 350 - remainder 30 - min or so @ 300...  Wow, delish!

I followed to recipe exactly. Although it tasted delicious, I was disappointed that the filling was really runny  (like maple syrup). Everyone loved the flavour though so I will try this again but will maybe bake longer.

I thought this was great! Followed recipe to the letter just used pecan halves instead of chopped. I think it makes a prettier pie. I will never use the corn syrup recipe again, this is soooooo much better!!!

This was wonderful!  I haven't been able to bake at 7500 feet and this recipe worked as written with no adjustments for high-altitude.  Yippee!!  Delicious! So much better without corn syrup, no fake, too sweet flavor...just right.  Thanks!

I love pecan pie. This goes together in a snap and is the best I've had. No more half empty bottles of corn syrup! I use 2 cups of pecan halves instead of chopped pecans and I always overdo it on the vanilla extract.

Loved this recipe! I had never made pecan pie before, and I will definitely use this recipe again. I added 1/4 cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate morsels and took other reviewers' suggestions of cooking at lower temp for longer period of time. Thank you!!

This pie is delicious. We make it without the dairy, substituting the butter for oil.  I previously omitted the milk and this time I have added coconut milk. The smell alone is heavenly.

I've made this pie for Thanksgiving dinner for several years and it always brings lots of compliments.  Had a friend over for the first time and she said, "Don't anyone talk to me right now -- I'm going to just sit here and enjoy this pie!  I'm from Virginia and I've eaten a LOT of pecan pies and this is the BEST!"

This is my favorite pecan pie recipe I've ever tried!  I made this for Thanksgiving and it was wickedly DELICIOUS!  My family loved it and I will be making it again for Christmas!  For the main pie, I used a frozen Marie Callender's deep dish crust, but I had a little filling left over put that into a quick graham cracker crust in a mini skillet.  I didn't wish to be wasteful! I'm not sure which crust was more delish!! It gave us a sample the night before the big meal and I hope I always have more filling than I need!

I have tried to make pecan pie for years, and about half of the time it thickens up, the other half it is just liquid with the karo syrup recipe.  And it wasn't overly sweet either, just right. Will use this recipe every time.

I really did think that this was the best pecan pie I have either made or eaten (other people's pies).  And guess what!!  I lowered the calories by using SPLENDA Brown  (advertised as 1/2 the calories of regular brown sugar) and "Truvia" (advertised as 1/4 the calories of white sugar).  It was amazingly great without the Karo syrup, which is the only way I've ever made it (or anybody else I know). Thanks for a truly great recipe!

I wanted to try this before Thanksgiving and used walnuts and apples.  Turned out FANTASTIC.  The only thing I am going to do is make it the night before and let it rest for at least 12 hours so that it has time to set.

I was little apprehensive making a pecan pie without the corn syrup but this turned out very well, maybe just a tad too sweet.  If you have a wicked sweet tooth, you’ll love this.

This was my very first attempt in making a pecan pie. I immediately liked the fact that it didn't call for as much sugar (including corn syrup) as most recipes. Only issue I had was cutting into it before it was completely cooled (waited only 2-3 hours), but the next day, the pie was perfect!

Made exactly as described, except the baking temperature. Based on the recommendation in various reviews, I started 350F for 15min, then, 300F for 55min. Liked the appearance when came out of oven. I noted when I poured the filling in the pie crust, pecan sank in the bottom part of crust, and I couldn't see much pecan on top, so I gently mixed the filling in the crust by using a fork, so the pecan came back to the surface of the pie.  Not sure how much difference this would have made to the surface appearance of the pie, but there was a nice blend of pecan on the surface of the pie, so I liked it :) The filling was less gooey as compare to the traditional recipe, perhaps due to not adding corn syrup, but again, I liked this way. For me personally, I didn't need an extra 1/2 cup pecan (additional) on top (as many reviewers suggested), and I still tasted plenty of pecan in my piece of pie. I saved an extra 1/2 cup of pecan for my next batch :) Yum, Yum, Yum!!

This recipe is hands down the best pecan pie recipe.  It's not sickening sweet like most and has wonderful flavor.  I increased the ingredients to make a deep dish pie and did not chop my pecans but took the extra time to lay them out on top.  The results were beautiful.

This recipe is really amazing.. I had everything to make it except the pie crust so I made a simple pie crust from scratch..

To make the crust 

mix 1 1/4 flour and 1/4 tsp salt with cold butter cut in cubes (I put the butter in the freezer for like 20 minutes).  After incorporating the butter into the flour add 1/4 cup ice cold water (i just put some water in the freezer till it was almost frozen).  Put aside the dough in the fridge for at least 4 hours.  I also added 1/2 cup of craisins because I didn't have enough pecans.. Even my brother in law who doesn't normally like pecan pie devoured this.. This recipe is awesome especially with these slight adjustments!

I've had excellent pecan pie with chocolate before, so after reading some reviews where others added a few chocolate chips I decided to try it too.  Well this recipe doesn't need the chocolate, in fact i think it detracted it's great on its own. But that's not the reason for only 4 stars (cause that wasn't part of the original recipe). The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I really felt it needed an extra cup of chopped pecans. So next time I make this yummy pie I will follow exactly as written, but add 1 more cup of chopped pecans (oh and a pinch of salt).

I love pecan pie, but I've never made it before.  Thanks to this recipe, my first try was a huge success!  I didn't pick this recipe because of the "no corn syrup" factor and honestly didn't think that would make much of a difference, but it really dd.  The flavor of this pie had more depth and complexity than most other pecan pies I've had.  I totally loved it.  The only reason I can't give this five stars is because of the baking time/temperature.  It was kind of a guessing game trying to figure out something reasonable based on the recipes and different reviews.  I just kept turning the temp down and did have to cover with foil at one point.  Turned out great in the end though :-)

Delicious! I had to increase the recipe by half as it didnt fill my pie dish enough, but this was fantastic! I also decreased the baking temp to 350 after the ten mins, then to 300 after 20 mins. It came out perfect! Thank you :)

The last time I had pecan pie was 7 years ago before moving to Germany. I thought it was time to make it again. Corn syrup is not readily available in my area, so I decided to make this recipe. I also made my own brown sugar because the one sold here has no moisture in it. This is the best pecan pie I ever had! I couldn't wait for it to cool off, so I had a warm slice. The pie was runny, but delicious nontheless. The filling did not run after it cooled off. It wasn't overly sweet either. The pie tasted the best by the third day (and a little sweeter, too). I'm not ashamed to admit that I ate the whole thing myself (my husband and kids don't like pecan pie) and gained 5 pounds! It was worth every bite. Will definitely make this again for my German MIL (she loves pecans). Thanks for sharing your recipe, Elaine! This is the a real pecan should taste. :-)

I make over 100 pies a year and quite a few are pecan.  THIS IS NOW MY FAVORITE PECAN PIE RECIPE.  I love the consistancy, the flour helping the filling to set.  I only use butter and with the brown sugar, it makes for a delicious filling.  I like to use dark brown sugar and only butter with 1 1/2 to 2 cups of pecans.  I like to chop my pecans because it helps the pie cut better.  Thank you for this recipe.  Where have you been all my life????

I tried this I loved it.  I always thought (because mom said so) that you had to use Karo syrup.  Believe me, I would never use it again after cooking this one.  My son is a chef and he highly complimented it.  I would definitely recommend it for anyone.

I made this without the white sugar because so many said it was too sweet. 2 tablespoons of flour (as suggested, and toasted the pecans before filling. THIS DOES NOT TASTE LIKE TRADITIONAL PECAN PIE AT ALL!!!! It is more like PECAN CAKE. My son ate it because he will eat anything, but my husband took a bite and shook his head no.

Easy to make and comes out every time.   This has become our go-to pecan pie.  I don't think I'll ever make with corn syrup again!  As some others have said, it's plenty sweet.  I cut out the white sugar, and use a combination of dark and light brown sugar.  I also use 2 Tbsp flour to thicken it a little more.  Love the advice to cook 10 min/400, 20 min/350, 20 min/325 - the crust doesn't darken too much.

When I pulled the pie out of the oven the filling had risen quite a bit and looked almost like burnt rice crispies on top. Apparently while baking the pecans rose to the top and separated from the rest of the filling. The overall taste of this pie was alright but I didn't care for it.

I was so excited to find this recipe!  I stopped buying corn syrup years ago, but I didn't want to give up pecan pie at the holidays.  I made several pies with maple syrup, and they tasted delicious but the filling was always too runny, seeping under the crust and making a terrible (though yummy) mess.  I found the texture and flavor of this syrup-less pie to be perfect.  Everyone loved it, and no one would have guessed it was made without corn syrup.  It also keeps very well in the fridge, if there's any left.

This was my first attempt at a pecan pie and it was absolutely delicious! I followed suggestions for oven temperature and time (bake at 350 for 15 minutes followed by 300 for about 55 minutes). I couldn't have been more pleased!

Amazingly good recipe. Most pecan pies I find to be overly sweet. This pie is absolutely perfect, especially when made as directed in a 9 inch pie plate (not making it a very thick pie). I used store brand ready-made pie crust and it was an easy dessert for Christmas dinner. I will definitely keep this recipe on hand.

I have made this recipe many times now. It is now a standard dish for the holidays.  And what is great, is it is half the calories and fat of a normal pie.  I do use a deep dish pie crust.  I love that you can use a hand mixer and whip this up in like 5 minutes if you have all the ingredients by you. It tastes like it took forever, but instead it is super fast to make.

This intrigued me since it doesn't contain corn syrup, so I made it against my mom's pie. It was similar in taste but not quite the same and it sank in the middle and cracked. Thanks for the recipe, but I'll have to stick to the corn syrup version from mom.

Love this.  So easy to make.  I cut out the white sugar, added about 3/4 cup semi-sweet chips and two tablespoons of bourbon.  That pie was GONE.

This pie is outstanding. I have always loved pecan pie but I'd never tried making my own until now. I was hesitant to try this "zero corn syrup" version but I am SO glad I went ahead with it. If anything, I think I like it better than the traditional recipe pecan pies. 

I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips and some additional pecans. The pie looked beautiful and tasted amazing. This was really easy to throw together and I WILL be making it again... Probably sooner rather than later!

I made this for Thanksgiving, even though I generally don't try out new, untested recipes for company. It was a huge hit, even with my husband who typically doesn't like pecan pie because it's too sweet. This will be my new, go-to recipe from now on. Like some other reviewers mentioned, I left out the white sugar, and used dark brown sugar for the rest. Fabulous!

Hands down one of the best pies I've ever had.  I took other reviewers suggestion of baking at 350 for 10 minutes and then 300 for 50 and threw in some chocolate chips but followed the recipe exactly for everything else and it came out perfect.  I actually think I'll leave the chocolate out next time, it didn't add enough to the already great pie to make it worth putting them in there.  I love that it doesn't use corn syrup and still had the same flavor and consistency you would expect a pecan pie to have. I will make this again and again!

Awesome recipe.  I like to add pecan halves to the top of the pie for decoration.  I do so about half way through baking otherwise they begin to sink in the filling and cannot be seen.

I had high hopes for this pie. My husband loves pecan pie and I was glad I found this recipe being it had no corn syrup in it. I followed it to the tee with exception of following other reviewers by baking it at 400 for 10, 350 for 20, 325 for 20. It was dry and the texture was odd. I only gave it the 3rd star because my husband tasted it anyway and said the flavor wasn't terrible.

I am in love! This is the first time I have attempted pecan pie and it is by far the best I've ever had!  I took the recommendation to bake at 350 deg for 10 min then remove and top with additional pecans (my daughter made a nice leaf pattern) and then reduce temp to 300 deg for 50 additional minutes.   I love that it is not sickenly sweet.  Try it- you'll love it too!

I found myself without Karo on Thanksgiving morning. I found this recipe, and decided to follow it exactly (butter? milk? well, okay!). Actually, I did increase the pecans to almost 2 cups.
The pie cooked up perfectly! Beautiful crust, perfectly set middle. And the flavor is perfect. This recipe has officially replaced that Karo recipe for my family.

I used a pilsbury refrigerated store bought crust & it was awful.  However, from what I could tell, this filling was really good.  I followed the instructions but I think the cooking time was too long - mine got really brown on top.  Next time I'll keep my eye on it & maybe take it out a little earlier or cover the whole pie with foil if it starts to get too brown (I always put a crust protector on).  I put one row of whole pecans on top around the crust just so you could tell what kind of pie it was & it looked OK.  I will definitely try this again with homemade crust & watch the cooking time more closely.

This recipe is amazing!!!!!!!!!!! It has no  corn syrup so my heath freak brother can eat it. When I brought it to church it was gone and I am now known around my church as the best person that makes pecan pie by some of the best bakers.It is really easy to make but what I found was if you mix in the pecans it looks like raisin bran.so I put the pecans on top after pouring the batter into the pie crust.I am only 12 so try this recipe it's delicious and easy to make!

I love that this doesn't need corn syrup. The flavor is fantastic! Not too sweet... it's just right. I've made with and without chocolate chips, and it's great both ways. This is my go-to pecan pie recipe - I love it.

Wonderful, nutty pecan pie! I followed the suggestion of cooking at 350 for 15 minutes and 300 for 10 minutes.  The crust was perfectly golden and crispy.  I also followed the suggestion of toasting the chopped pecans for about 8-10 minutes at 300 beforehand.  This really gave the pie a wonderful flavor.  I love the fact that it doesn't require corn syrup.

LOVE THIS Recipe!! The only thing that make me give this a four stars is that it's just way too sweet !! I would cut out the white sugar and add the semi-chocolate chips (1/2 cup) would enhance the pecan flavor ! I will repeat with the above change for this Thanksgiving.

They are still talking about how good this was hours after dinner.  It was so easy to make and wasn't too sweet.  I was asked to make it again and not to change anything about the recipe!  Definitely a keeper..we love pecan pie and this was my first time making one.

Amazing and so easy! I picked this recipe due to the reviews and the fact that it DOESN'T call for corn syrup and it tastes fantastic. Also, it's not sickeningly sweet so you can actually enjoy all the flavors.

Amazing!  Tastes so good, and so easy.  My family raves over it.  I just use a pillsbury pie crust.

Tastes better than the standard pie made with corn syrup! I can't believe I haven't found this sooner. Thank you for posting, absolutely delicious!

Elaine I have made many pecan pies from your recipes.  They always get rave reviews.  Most want your recipe and I gladly give it to then.  But I tell them I always add a little love to it

Very good, however, I found that it was still runny in the middle after the proper cook time.  Needed to keep it in the oven another 30-45 min to fully cook.  Delicious though!

This is awesome goodness! Didn't change a thing. It's perfect as it is and wasn't hard to make for an amateur like me. Used homemade "Pie Crust IV".

Not quite what I expected, but not bad. Changes: didn't add the white sugar, added an extra 1/2 cup of pecans, and baked at 350 for 10 minutes then 300 for close to 50 minutes.

This pie turned out great, and I'm not that great with baking either.  I took others suggestions and roasted the pecans first, and I also baked it at 350 for 10 minutes then 300 for 45 minutes.  DH said it was better than any pie we've ever bought from Sam's Club. I'll definitely be making this again!

Great recipe and tastes delicious (this coming from someone that normally doesn't like pecan pie). DH adores pecan pie and insisted that I try making homemade for Thanksgiving this year. Well, I did and glad for it. Never realized it was so easy to make. The only thing I would do different is perhaps layer the pecans instead of mixing them in, but otherwise, it's a great recipe as-is. Oh yeah, DH gave his thumbs-up seal of approval. ;-)

I've made this 3 times now & it's a big hit! My mom loves pecan pie but a lot of times, it's too sweet for her b/c of the corn syrup. She tried this & demanded the recipe. SO DELISH!!!

First time making a pecan pie, turned out delish!! I bought the graham cracker crust with the '2 extra servings' so I'll get a smaller pie crust next time and less cooking time was needed, I felt mine was a little done. Also, roasting the pecans that go in the filling was a great tip from another reviewer and made the inside have such a hearty nutty flavor. I did the first bake on a higher heat and then after that I put the pecans on top then cooked   the rest of the time. I'll never even try the Karo pecan pie recipe, this is the best!!

This pie is a CLEAR winner.  It's basically the only pie my husband will eat (he has vowed to never again eat a store-bought pecan pie), and everyone else who tries it looooves it.  One of our friends who usually eats quite slowly (and has a very mild sweet tooth) took three slices of this pie and wolfed them down!  Everyone is surprised at how perfectly sweet and nutty it is; better than the sickly-sweet corn syrup-based pies and it's always a hit.

I avoid pecan pie with corn syrup.  I tried this one for Christmas and its a KEEPER as written.  BIG WIN.  I recommend warming it before serving as it adds to the flavor vs right out of the refrigerator

Ive never had pecan pie before but this was great! My pie dishes must be deeper though. I made two pies and they were not filled up enough. I mixed more and splut it between the two pies. I couldve probably doubled it for each though. Definitely a keeper!

I made this for thanksgiving and doubled the recipe. I doubled it on the site then when I was measuring out the white sugar I doubled it again (1/4 to 1/2 then 1/2 to 1 cup) so for 2 pies I put 1 cup of white sugar and when I realized it I had already mixed the white and brown together and didn't want to waste it. Anyways, the pies came out fine.

Wow, gotta say that this made for one amazing pecan pie! I kept my pecan halves intact for this recipe, and added a LOT more pecans than called for in the recipe (an extra cup to cup-an-a-half), and thought it still could have done with more pecans. It was also VERY buttery; I could taste the butter time and time again, though that might have been due to the fact that I didn't completely melt the butter (for future reference, do melt all the butter). Still, amazing pie; This thing didn't last more than a day on thanksgiving when there was a choice of three other pies to be had!

Excellent and easy!  Sweet without being that sickening sweet that is often found with pecan pies. I only used half a cup of chopped pecans in the filling and covered the top with pecans. I made a whipped cream with vanilla cinnamon and nutmeg to dollop on top. Yummy!!

This recipe is absolutely delicious. I used a homemade crust in deep dish pie plate and increased the recipe by about 50% to fill the crust. 350 degrees for about 20 minutes and 300 for about 35 minutes was perfect. My wife liked it but says she prefers the traditional Karo syrup based pie. I prefer this pie because it has a wonderful roasted pecan praline flavor and with the homemade crust tastes like it could have come from our local artisan bakery.

Finally! I've found a pecan pie recipe that is like my mom used to make. This is THE BEST--not sickenly sweet like the recipes that use corn syrup. Thank you Elaine!

Delicious!! I will never be making a corn syrup recipe again!! This is so much better. I agree with the reviewer that said it isn't sweet like candy. This is perfect!! I doubled the recipe because the only pie plates I have are deep dish and it was perfect. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!!!

Soo good. I asked my husband to make this for my birthday cake instead of cake because it is so amazing. I think I ate half the pie myself at Thanksgiving.

This recipe is so wonderful!  I did use around 1.5 cups of pecans and put whole pecans on the tops of each pie instead of only using chopped pecans.  This pie is so easy to make and was the first of three pies to go at Thanksgiving!  Everyone asked for the recipe and couldn't believe how much better it was compared to those using corn syrup.  It's not sickening sweet like those with corn syrup.  My husband requested another one after all of our guests left and it was gone so quickly as well!  Wonderful recipe!!

This was my second time ever making a Pecan Pie. Last time I used a different recipe and it came out unsettled and mushy. To my surprise, with this recipe I followed all the instructions and let it settle for 2 hours and it came out fantastic! I also loved how it didn't require corn syrup! I brought this to my boyfriends fathers Thanksgiving for dessert and it was gone in minutes! I wished I had made another one to bring to my own parents because it came out so good.

I needed to make a pecan pie and have never done so; searched and found this -- i never liked pecan pie because it was too sweet.  This was wonderful, and so easy, too.  I did substitute dark brown sugar, and i increased amount of nuts javascript:__doPostBack('ctl00$ContentPlaceholder$edit$saveButton','')(lightly toasted first); also sprinkled a little cinnamon on top just before finished cooking.  My boss' request for pecan pie for his birthday was a HUGE hit, and i've made 6 since, by request!

First attempt at a pecan pie. Very disappointed. First off this is my fault not the recipe but I have a deeper pie dish and started with a single batch of filling & it was only half full. Made another half batch and it still wasn't very full. Made another half batch & it ended up being only 3/4 full. I took advice of others and baked at 350 for 10 mins then 50 mins at 300. What I got was a bland thick stew like mess. Can't even cut it. More like spoon it out into bowls. Sorry

Woderful nutty flavor! I used dark brown sugar because I didn't have any light brown sugar - turned out fine. 
The only other thing I changed was to pre-heat the oven to 400 since the first cooking cycle called for 400.

I made this for the first time on Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! I absolutely love Pecan Pie and am so happy I found such a great recipe. It has just the right amount of sweetness without being overbearing. This will be my go to recipe for Pecan Pie from now on.

Fantastic! I was worried that I would miss the gooey corn-syrupy consistency of traditional pecan pies, but I didn't at all! I actually made two pies (this and one with corn syrup) just in case, and this one was better by far.

AMAZING!! I'm allergic to corn, so I've been without pecan pie for a couple of years - this was even better than the pecan pie I remember w/ corn syrup! This one doesn't stick in your teeth, you don't have to heat it to a certain temperature, etc. - it's super simple & wonderful!!
I can't wait to make this again! I think almost HALF of the pie by myself!! :)

This was great!  I really loved that it did not require corn syrup, that was very attractive.  All in all, the only changes that I made were to increase the nuts to 1.5 cups and I added 1 tsp of cinnamon but this would have been perfect prepared just as recipe states.  Thank you for the great recipe with no syrup!

Delicious! Used Dark Brown sugar instead also added 1 tablespoon bourbon in addition to the vanilla.  Took another users advice and baked at 350 for 10 min and then 300 for 50.  Made a pecan design on top with extra halved pecans.  This recipe is a keeper!

My husband wanted me to buy a pre-made pecan pie for Thanksgiving this year.  I argued and got my way (after all, I'm the cook!) and after the first bite, he announced that it was the best pecan pie he'd ever had in his life.  I followed this recipe exactly and used a graham cracker crust.  I'm not a big fan of pie myself, but even I think it's good.  I will be using this recipe again.

AMAZING!  I am not a huge fan of Corn Syrup as it is, but have always just "sucked it up" because I LOVE pecan pie!  However, this pie is even BETTER than the traditional recipe, and in the long run, it's got to be much healthier!!!  Not over sweet or rich, just perfect!  5 stars!  Oh, yeah... I add Chocolate Chips, though and beef up the pecans.. I'm a huge fan of pecans!  I get chopped and halves and mix just for different texture... may attempt to add some brandy some time, too??

Really delicious.  I am a huge pecan lover but had never made a pecan pie because I really don't like the syrupy sweetness.  This was a huge hit with the No-Fail Pie Crust recipe on this site.  Definitely start at 350 for 10-15 min then lower to 300 for the remainder and don't overbake.  Absolutely delicous!

This was the first time I've ever made a pecan pie.  I specifically looked for one without corn syrup as I find such pecan pies to be too rich and I get sick from them.  I followed the directions exactly with no modifications.  I did add decorative pecan halves to make a nice border and a decorative design on the top.  It turned out perfectly.  It was wonderful and everyone wanted the recipe.  There were no leftovers- and that is amazing in my family.  This one is a keeper and I'll be making it again.  Thanks.

I was very excited about this recipe. I've never tried to make, let alone eaten a pecan pie with out corn syrup. Also, because it was a new pie to me i took great care in following the directions to a T. Unfortunately, it turned out more like pecan soup than pie. The top formed a yummy cookie-like crust and after the cooling time seemed to have solidified. This was an illusion. it was only solid on the top crust, it was literally liquid on the inside. If any of the previous reviewers that had seemingly amazing success could give me some advise on how to successfully bake this dessert i'd love it!

Delicious! I am usually a corn syrup pecan pie gal.....but had to try this one.....very nice, not as "gelatinous" as the corn syrup pies. So easy to make and just simply good. Served with Cool Whip....the Sweet Cinnamon flavor they now have out for the holidays. Thanks for a great pie! Even my non nut lovers (my kids) had a small slice and enjoyed! I also forgot to mention that I used only 2 tblspns of the white sugar instead of the full 1/4c. I also used fat free half and half instead if milk.

I'm not sure how it tastes yet but it looks pretty good, i only have one concern.. i can see a few sugar grains on top so i'm pretty worried that this pie will have a very grainy texture.. is this normal or did i not stir the sugar in with the butter and eggs enough? i'm not familiar with pecan pies so i'm not sure what kind of texture they should have. I'll let you know what my guests think of this pie tomorrow for thanksgiving dinner!

Very tasty. Not gooey like traditional pecan pie. Mine seemed to fall apart when I cut it. I did overcook it however and may have added a few too many nuts.

I made this exactly as listed and it was fabulous!  Everyone raved about it and requested I make it again.  It was tasty but not overly sweet as a pecan pies usually are.  My father who does not like sweets said I am going to have to bring him another one this week!  Will be a fall staple.  Thank you!

I've only made this once and I'm not a huge pecan fan, but this recipe completely changed my view of pecan pie! It was so simple, cooked perfectly, and tasted so good! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a keeper. If you like Pecan Pie, you will like this. It's simple, quick and easy and as good as those pecan pies that require karo syrup etc.  Two thumbs up!  Highly recommended.

Never make a pecan pie with corn syrup again!!  I sure won't.  This is my new favorite pie!!  I changed a couple minor things.  Added a 1/2 cup pecans, and 1/4 cup of mini choc. chips also added 1/4 tsp of fine sea salt.  As others did i changed the baking time/temps to 350 for the first 20 min, then 325 for 35 min.  It was perfect!!

Very good recipe. I tweaked it slightly by browning the butter and adding just a bit more. It turned out very well. Also, I found I needed approximately 8 additional minutes added to the baking time. About 48 minutes at 350 along with the original 10 @ 400.

This pie is great!  It is more like a tart as it does not have that slimy filling of most pecan pies. I used my own home made pie crust and I used a previous reviewer's idea of cooking it for 10 min. at 350 and then one hour at 300.   I took it out of the oven at slightly less than an hour. It is absolutely wonderful!!!

Followed the recipe as is. Perfect, except I almost doubled the amount of pecans and made pecan tarts instead.

Signing in as another who has previously disliked pecan pie due to the sticky, syrupy, sweetness of it. We can all live without high fructose corn syrup. 

I doubled the recipe and used a double crust, which was absolutely perfect. No need to be nervous, every drop of the mix fit the crust. 

The pie was baked at 350° for 15 minutes, then I reduced the heat to 300° and baked for an additional 55 minutes. During the last 15 minutes, the edges were covered with a pie crust protector. I even allowed an extra ten minutes just in case, without burning it. 

For those of us who are busy or otherwise not inclined to make our own pie crust, Mrs. Smith is your friend. 

It cooks beautifully, but I was a bit dismayed at the texture. My two cents. The middle still seemed loose to me, and was more like scooping a pile than serving a slice. Perhaps increasing the flour, reducing the sugar, adding a little more pecan next time? It could very well be that I tried to double this recipe. Too many others have had great success, so I'm willing to try again.  

Otherwise, the taste is wonderful! Served with ice cream, it was delicious.

This was the best pecan pie I have ever eaten. I made it for my father-in-law who is a pecan pie lover and he thought it was amazing. I changed the cooking times a little I baked 10min at 400. 20 min at 350 and 15min ant 325. I also chopped up 1/2 of pecans, mixed 1/4 of a cup of melted butter, 2 tbls  brown sugar and a dash of vanilla and mixed it all up. I then added it to the top of the pecan pie after I baked it for 10 min at 400. Again Thank you Elaine for the best pecan pie ever.

Unfortunately I have to give this recipe a low rating. The recipe was easy to make however, the baking time was inaccurate. I had to double to recipe as well because I used a deep dish pie pan. I had to bake it for at least a half hour longer because it would not set properly. After I removed it from the oven it was extra browned and didn't look appetizing. I took a taste test and I thought it was pretty good. However, I brought the pie to a party and no one touched it because of its appearance. I would use this recipe again at a small dinner party and serve it with whip cream and caramel to dress it up a bit.

Great recipe!!! Everyone who had this thought it was "YUM".  I put about 3/4 C more pecans than it called for to fill out space in a 9.5" pie tin.

Fantastic pecan pie!  I love that this doesn't contain any corn syrup!!!  The only downer about this is that it doesn't make a whole lot, probably only enough for a small pie pan.  I had a slightly larger pan & it only filled up just over 1/2 way.  Thanks for the recipe Elaine!!!

Made this twice now, the second time I increased the ingredients by 1/3 so it would fill the larger pie pan. Used Pillsbury refrigerated crust, it was fabulous. The pie was rich with wonderful flavor I gave it 4 stars because I felt it was too sweet, it was almost cloying. I like this recipe enough to make again but I'm going to reduce the sugar by 1/3 and see how that works. Otherwise made it exactly like the directions, crust was perfect, pie set up well.

I dunno WHAT I did wrong. I followed this recipe exactly only difference was oven temp and timing and eggs at room temp (as recommended). I thought it tasted OK, but my issue was the pecans kept crumbling all over the place, they just didnt stay in the filling, and my crust wanted burn within 10 minutes of placing it in the oven, so I had to cut it off around the top. I even had the temp down to 250 for awhile. It was just like eating pecan pie without the pecans(since they kept falling off and out), and they also wanted to burn a lot around the top. My family just topped it with vanilla ice cream or cool whip to make a big jumbled mess and eat it. I would like to know what I did wrong, cause if it wasnt for the pecans falling out and burning it would probably be good or at least I could adjust it to be right.

This is an AMAZING pie. And its extremely simple to make. It took me about all of 5 minutes to make the filling and put it in a pie shell. 

I cooked it following the directions exactly and it turned out perfect. I looked at the pictures and noticed some were as gooey on the inside, which I like. So I took it out at the 30 minutes, and let it rest a bit before serving and it was perfect.

Never using another recipe, simple, natural ingredients. And it taste amazing. Who needs corn syrup?

Best Pecan pie ever! Those are my husbands words. Growing up in the south, my husband has always loved pecan pies but always complained they were just too sweet. This recipe solves everything. It takes no time at all. Just throw everything together and bake. That simple!! I promise you will love it. I had never like pecans till I found this and the Blueberry sour cream cake. Now, I am addicted to them. I buy a ton of pecans so I will always have everything I need to just throw this together for something quick and easy.

This is a great pecan pie. I like my filling gooey so I added the pecans to the top instead of mixing them in. They sank a little but was awesome.

WOW- I'm writing this as I just finished the last piece of pie! My husband and I are avid pecan pie lovers...I always attempting making pecan pies with the corn syrup recipes and somehow they always came out runny. I saw the reviews on this one and, although skeptical, gave it a try.  This recipe is amazing- pie was super delicious (and NOT runny!)! I followed the recipe as is but used dark brown sugar instead of light brown b/c that's all I had. I couldn't believe how perfect it  tasted. I never write reviews but this deserved it! I HAD to voice it!

This IS the pecan pie recipe to make! I made this and my husband said it was the BEST and asked if I could bake one for his grandmother for Christmas, because its her favorite. My daughter, who has never wanted to try the 'nut' pie, loved it! I took the advice of one reviewer - 350 degrees for 15 min and reduce to 300 for 50-55 min. Perfect everytime!!

I LOVED this recipe. Especially since it did not use any corn syrup. I made two pies. One I followed the recipe exactly, another I tweaked by adding some cinnamon and some honey. My Dad LOVED the second one, especially with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I'm planning on making these again as individual servings to share.

So far I've made this recipe three times, and I've had one bite because my boyfriend consumes it faster than I can make it!  Great recipe.  My only suggestion is to change the pre-heat temperature to 400.  Thanks!

Simple to make, BUT...this calls for a DEEP DISH pie crust! I bought the regular size and the filling was almost spilling over. It's in the oven now so don't know if it will "cook down" as time goes by.  Ok, this is the next day, after I took the pie to my gathering. Very disappointing! The top of the pie was a pale brown, there were no pecans on top (I guess I should have "dotted them on" as a last touch) and the pie was DRY with little moisture. I attribute this to the lack of corn syrup. The flavor of the pie was good, however. Especially with a dollop of whipped cream!  I guess I'm looking for a recipe that will give me the rich, dark moist texture of a traditional pecan pie without corn syrup.

I wish there was a 3.5 rating.  The only reason I gave this a 4 was the taste.  It had a great flavor but the Thanksgiving presentation didn't fly.  My husband wouldn't even try it.  No traditional pecan top.  It looked very dry.  And cutting it... it looked more like pecan crumble than pecan pie.  I might make this one again, cutting out some of the sugar for a touch or corn syrup.... it will take some experimentation.

Very good.  Possibly my favorite of the three.  Not runny at all.  Didn't have the typical "look" to the top of the pie when done.  But great flavor and texture.

My pecans did not float to the top & the pie formed a crust on top so it wasn't obvious it was a pecan pie.  Also, I think i should have cooked it a little longer as it was watery in the center. The taste was fine, nothing special. I think I will stick with the corn syrup based recipes over the higher butter content of this recipe. I prefer the gooey texture from the corn syrup.

Pie tasted incredible but the science part of it was a problem.  The  pie was overcooked.  I took the advice of the chefs about turning down the heat but something didn't work out.  Again, it tasted like a 5 star pie but the presentation and the fact that it didn't slice was a bummer....

This pie is simple to make and delicious!  It doesn't quite have the stickiness of a karo syrup pecan pie, but it has all of the flavor.  I read the reviews before making and found these comments to be helpful: if using a 9" deep dish pie crust, you have to make an additional half of the filling to fill the crust; bake at 350 for 15 min, then reduce to 300, bake for 50-55 min.  Also, if you want to add an extra dimension to the flavor of the pie, drizzle caramel sauce over the top of the pie when it comes out of the oven or add a heaping tablespoon into the filling.

"I would easily pay $25 for this pie.  You really should sell these." That was just one of the many compliments and rave reviews I received about this pecan pie.  Double bonus that it does not contain corn syrup!  I am not a big fan of pecan pie, but after hearing everyone rave about it, I definitely had to at least try it.  It really was fabulous.  This will certainly be my go-to recipe from here on out!

If you're looking for a classic pecan pie this is a great recipe. I took people's advice and baked it at 300 for about 45 minutes after baking it at 400 for 10 minutes. I also added more pecans, about a cup and a half, and used dark brown sugar instead of light because that's all I had but it turned out great and I think I'd prefer the dark brown sugar to the light anyway since there's no karo.

This was well loved at Thanksgiving. I always make the pecan pie at Thanksgiving, had lost my original recipe I used years ago that used all maple syrup. Never have been a fan of the Karo recipes. Thought I would try this because it didn't use corn syrup and had several recommendations from Chefs.       Everyone seemed to love it. The only thing I did different was to use about a cup and a half of pecan halves that I just gave a rough chop to. They were still big pieces. It looked a little different (color-wise) coming out of the oven, but the proof is in the taste. Better than the overly sweet syrup kind.

This was by far the best pecan pie I have had to this day! I will echo many reviews by saying that the lack of corn syrup keeps this pie from becoming sickingly sweet. My mother-in-law said that she normally thinks pecan pies are a waste of perfectly good pecans, but this pie breaks the norm.

My pie also ended up with the foamy looking brown shell on top. I ended up chipping that off, adding more nuts to the top and baking it longer.  It tasted OK but I would never make this recipe again.

Excellent!  This was my first attempt at a pecan pie and it turned out great.  I searched for a recipe that specifically did NOT use corn syrup.  I would recommend using the "Butter Flaky Pie Crust" recipe on this site for the crust.  Making your own crust isn't as hard as it may seem and it is so worth it, in my opinion.  I also followed someone's advice and baked this at 350 for the first 15 minutes then lowered the temp to 300 for 50 minutes.  I used pecan halves instead of chopped pecans.  One other tip:  when you pour the filling into the crust, it will rise when baking.  I was a little worried at first because I had quite a gap between the unbaked filling and the edge of the pie plate.  It rose during baking though and came out great!

I usually make my pecan pie the original way with Karo syrup but this recipe is MUCH better!  I swayed some people over to the pecan pie side this evening with this recipe!  It takes less time to cook than the recipe with the corn syrup and tastes better too!  I recommend that everyone switch over to this recipe.

I made this recipe as stated, except I only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar because I ran out and I added nicely arranged whole pecans on top. It came out AWESOME. It was my first attempt at a pecan pie and it could not have been easier or turned out better. I baked for 10 minutes at 350 degrees and then about 50 minutes at 300 degrees. Everyone raved about it at our big Thanksgiving dinner and I was told I must make TWO for Christmas!

This pie is excellent! It's a tad too sweet, but it's definitely delicious. I had to cook mine way longer cause it wouldn't set up at all. I still don't think it was fully set up after an hour but enough was enough lol. I used a butter crust from a recipe on here, so maybe that had something to do with it. Will make again!

This pie is great!  It has he perfect amount of sweetness and great texure - not runny at all!  I baked it at 400 for 10 min., then 350 for 40 min - turned our perfectly.  I did add some extra pecans, but I'm not sure it really needed it.  Delish!

Made this recipe last year and it was a hit! So decided to try again this year!   Only made a few changes: used 2 cups chopped pecans instead of 1. Also, when I made it last year, there was a thick crust on top and the pecans didnt float up. Still tasted great but wasnt as aesthetically pleasing as I would have liked. So this year, I took the nuts and mixed them with a large spoonful of the filling then spooned them over the filling once it was already in the pie shell.   Lastly, followed the suggestion of cooking pie at 350º for 10 minutes, then reducing heat to 300º and allowed to cook for an additional 55 minutes.   Love love love!!

Love it, but needs more pecans for the top for decor (I sugered mine before hand so they "shined" like standard pecan pie), and baking time is indeed off.  But, the taste is really great.

I could not believe how good this was without corn syrup.  I had a deep dish and it was not quite filled up.  My own fault, otherwise delicious!

I followed the instructions exactly. This was easy to make and really delicious. The only issue I had was that I preheated the oven to 350  as the directions said, and then never bumped up the temperature to 400 for the first 10 minutes. It didn't really end up being a huge deal, just the center was a little loose until it cooled. I will be making this again. It was very yummy.

I added a ridiculous amount of pecans (three cups plus more on top) so the whole thing basically just crumbled. But I think it will be amazing next time when I relax with the pecans a little bit!

This is the best pecan pie I've ever had. I always get great reviews when I take it to gatherings. Not as sweet as other pies I've had and that's what I hear most people say. And that's a good thing!! Thank you for sharing this!!

I don't make many pecan pies, but I like this one because it doesn't require corn syrup.  When I serve it is pretty well-received.

This pie was, in a word, delicious!  I'd never had pecan pie before, but all my guests had and they said this was the best pecan pie ever.  I followed the directions exactly and it turned out wonderful.  I guess it's a good sign when you go back the next day for another piece and it's already all gone!

Delicious! This was my first ever pecan pie and I cannot believe how great it turned out! I made it for my boyfriend's dad's birthday and he is a pecan pie coniseure. He loved it! I cooked it at 350 for 15 minutes and then 300 degrees for 50 minutes as suggested by some but when I checked it after 60 minutes the middle was still runny so I turned the oven back up to 350. Well that caused it to finish cooking in 20 minutes (I didn't expect it to cook that fast). I actually thought I totally over-cooked it but...it was awesome! That said, I think the temperature depends on your oven and next time I'll cook the pie at a higher temp and check more often. Also, I used "Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust" and it was the best crust I've ever made.

Yum!!! I've made this many many times, with no changes. However, in an attempt to get healthy, I made some major adjustments last night and it still turned out great! To fill a deep dish pie pan, I used 3/4 Spenda Brown Sugar Mix, 1/2 Cup Splenda, 3/ cup canola oil instead of butter, and 6 egg whites. Still turned out great!! Try this if your looking to stay a bit on the healthy side.

This recipe really came out very good. I am picky when it is aobut desserts, but I could eat this pie over and over again.  There wasn't enough filling like usual, so I will try to make it with 3 eggs next time, and this might mean I should alter the recipe a little. But it is worth it.

Excellent and easy pie!  I agree with a previous poster that without the use of syrup, it doesn't taste like candy and tastes like pie :)  I made one for Christmas (for 5 people) It was devoured..no leftovers, so made a second the day after Christmas :)

I was very disappointed in this recipe. The filling was dry, crumbly and gritty; eating it was like eating wet sand. Overly sweet without much "nuttiness". Sorry...I really do hate to give a recipe a bad rating/review, but there are corn syrup free pecan pie recipes that are much better.

MAKE THIS PIE~I made this for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners w/friends.  I kept it a secret till they tried it to tell them it contained no corn syrup, the raves where amazing, and then the shock when people found out it didn't have corn syrup.  Superb pie, light and sweet, WONDERFUL

I love this pecan pie and so does my whole family. I made it for Christmas this year and everyone said it was the best pecan pie they've had. I used a graham cracker crust but the only thing I changed from the recipe is that I added 1/2 cup more pecans and I used the lower baking temp (15 min @ 350, 50-55 min @ 300). It tastes better once it's cooled and allowed to set overnight in the fridge, otherwise it's kind of crumbly when it first comes out of the oven. Tastes great with vanilla bean ice cream.

The taste was amazing!  But the cook time was really off.  The center was very runny and the top was getting really brown.  Next time I will try 350 for 15 and 300 for 50-55.

This was the most wonderful Pecan Pie I have ever had, not to sweet, finished one piece and wanted more. I added more pecans to make up for the slight less mass then usual. Loved it and will make it again.

Great! Added extra nuts, one layer of wholes on the bottom, the mixture, than a topping of arranged whole pecans. Love it very nutty, not all goo like store bought pie. Great for diabetics (splenda makes a brown sugar). The splenda package says to use half the amount of sugar the recipe calls for, don't worry the pie still turns out wonderful. If you make this in a deep pan you need to add extra goo and it seems to take forever to cook, so it works out great in those little foil ones.

I had never eaten or made a pecan pie before this one.  My husband who is the pecan pie King, said this was excellent!  I thought maybe he wouldn't like it because it didn't have the syrup, but he enjoyed it as well as my 9 yr old son.  It was on the drier side without the gooeyness of the syrup.

DELISH- DELISH!!!  It was a hit!  I blended the nuts in our little mini processor and was afraid I got some of them too small (some was powder form even).  However it made it more flavorful and kept the filling from getting a jelly like feel to it.  All ready to make it again!

I absolutely suck at baking but wanted to try to my this to impress my future in laws on Thanksgiving.  It turned out absolutely perfect, I followed the directions just as they are.  I did get worried because it was still a bit liquefied after baking but my mother in law assured me it was suppose to be that way and would firm up.  It did and everyone loved it so much they want it for Christmas too, only I need to make 2 pies this time!

I made this for Thanksgiving using the no fail crust 2 and everyone really liked it. It is not overly sweet and doesn't have the stickiness of one made with corn syrup. This one is a home run for me, and now part of my favorites collection.

This is an amazing pecan pie recipe - best I've ever tasted, no comparison to the traditional corn syrup variety!  I added a little salt to the filling, and topped the pie with pecan halves in addition to having the chopped pecans in the filling, but otherwise made it according to the recipe.  This made a great impression at Thanksgiving, definitely a keeper!

I made some modifications and turn out great! I added and extra egg, let the sugars out and substituted with a can of fat free condensated milk, used almost 3 cups of chop pecans and half cup of semisweet choc.chips, 1 tbsp of vanilla and the rest as the original recipe says. I made myself a graham cookie crust instead of the tasteless lardy crusts!! for the baking time i did what the other reviews says at 350 for 12 min and then lowered to 300 for almost 50 min....try it! you won´t be dissapointed! the extra egg and the condensated milk really makes  a huuuge difference!

Amazing!!  I've never EVER made a pie before and I was skeptical about how it would turn out.  It was delicious (a bit sweet but that's pecan pie for you), and I ended up listening to other reviews which recommended adding extra pecans and taking care to not burn the top.  Super delicious!

This was the third year in a row that I've made this pecan pie for Thanksgiving. It's not overly sweet like a lot of pecan pies. I think the only thing I don't like is that the chopped pecans sink in the pie while cooking and you don't see them when the pie is done. Easy remedied by lying whole pecans on the top, just so people know what they are cutting a piece of.

very good, very easy recipe.  I didn't change anything except I used whole pecan halves, and used about a handful more than the 1cup called for in the recipe.  Did everything else "by the book" and it is better than the Karo syrup pies...  better texture and more caramel type flavor.  I'll use it in the future!

This pie was exceptional! I made it for Thanksgiving (my first attempt at pecan pie) and it was a hit! My tweaks: I added 1/4 cup of mini chocolate chips, and I used about 2 cups of pecans - which I toasted in a skillet first and right before they were about to get too dark I added a Tb or two of butter (I heard it gets absorbed in as the nut oils get released). I really think that made a positive impact on the pie!

My husband said this is the best pecan pie he has ever eaten.  I thought it was very good too but it confused my taste buds since it had a different consistency.  I'm sure I will get used to it though.  I made it in a large glass pie pan and should have used a smaller one.

Actually-- 3-1/2 stars. I don't eat pecan pie, but it's my husband's favorite. He said that the crusty top created by the filling was weird, and it was a bit too gooey at the bottom, but the pie tasted pretty good. I was happy to find a syrup-less recipe, so I'll probably try again with a few changes-- lightly mix the ingredients (a couple reviews said too much mixing leaves the filling too fluffy), double the pecans (half for the filling, half on top), and toast the pecans first.

The best pecan pie! It still has a bit of the consistency the caro syrup pies have but without that yucky taste. Mine did come out a tad crumbly on the top and I don't think the filling is enough, next time I will modify it to make more. But I loved this pie!

This was an excellent pecan pie, but will not live up to your standards if you want the classic.  It did not have the gooey texture that a classic pecan pie has - it was much more crumbly, but not so crumbly that it didn't stay together well.  I personally loved it, and will make it from here on out on Thanksgiving - the deletion of corn syrup makes the trade off on texture MORE than worth it!

This has great flavor, but I found that it didn't really make enough filling for my 9-inch pie pan.  The pie was not very thick.  Next time I will increase the filling ingredients by about 50%.  I used the Baker's Secret Pie Crust recipe from this site and it was delicious.

I generally don't care for pecan pie but my 12 year old daughter wanted to make one so we chose this recipe. Oh my gosh!!!! LOVED IT! Everyone did. It was soooo good, different than most I've tried. Wasn't chewy nor "tough" but DELICIOUS. And she made it herself!

This pie was a hit at Thanksgiving.  Very good flavor and texture.  Don't be afraid of how it looks.  It does not look like a normal  pecan pie.  I used a Marie Calendar frozen crust and it was just enough to fill.

Awesome recipe.  Absolutely delicious and no corn syrup for anyone trying to make a ... ummm ... healthier pie.  :)  Unlike others, I found my pie to be a bit overdone after 10 min @ 400 and 30 min @ 350.  Pie is done when internal temp reaches 200 degrees and mine reached 220 degrees after that time.  Will bake for shorter time next time.

I decided I would try this recipe for Thanksgiving. Well I had to try it before tomorrow just in case it was awful, just the opposite, this is by far the best pecan pie I have ever tried. I am getting ready to make another as I know this will not be enough even with the other pies!!  No More Karo Syrup for me!!!

My entire family agreed that the taste of this pie was really good, but it was definitely not a pretty pie.  I don't know if it's the "foaming" of the eggs that does it or what, but the entire top of the pie has a crusty, crumbly layer over it.  So much so that you can't even identify that it is a pecan pie.  So if you don't have corn syrup and it doesn't matter what the pie looks like, this is a good one for taste, but it you want a good looking pecan pie, I would recommend a different recipe.

This is an amazing recipe. I have been trying for years to make a pecan pie. The only thing I changed was the cooking time. 10 minutes at 400. 50 minutes at 300... It was perfect. Can't wait to serve it on Thanksgiving....

Never made a pie before, this was my first. My dad who is picky and doesn't even like pecan pie said it was awesome, mom loved it and it passed my fiance's inspection (he's a Georgia boy so that says a lot!)  I threw the pecans in food processor to grind up really good, it gave the pie a nice crumbly texture. Will definately make this again! 5 stars all the way!

I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT, it was sooooo easy to make& best of all I didn't have to deal with corn syrup. It taste so good you don't even notice the syrup is gone. I have finally found my Pecan Pie recipe that I will use every time I need/want one. I did follow a reviewers adv. and let the eggs come to room temp but that was the only thing I changed & again this pie came out great. =]

I found my pie cooked very quickly, so beware and check often. This caused the top to over-brown and crack on top.  It was messy to cut.  I used a 9in deep dish crust and it was not enough to fill it properly...thankfully this was just a test run.  The pie does not have the same texture as a regular pecan pie, it loses some of the shiny gelatin consistency, but the flavor is that of a regular pecan pie.  I will stick to corn syrup recipes and keep this for back-up when I'm out of corn syrup. I give it 4 stars ONLY because it is a working emergency substitute for corn syrup.

Very good!  Mine turned out "puffy" , too.  Next time I won't let so much air whip into the filling.  I made it for a pecan pie loving friend and he LOVED the crunchy surface (almost like a thin merangue layer.)  It wasn't goopy and syrupy like my traditional recipe.  I will definitely make this again!

This pie was a hit. I will admit I was shocked that it tasted good in spite of no corn syrup being used.  I will say that make sure that you beat the eggs until foamy also make sure the butter is competely melted. I see some people said it did not turn out well. Maybe some did not beat the eggs right that is  the key.  I would also suggest adding a 1/2 cup more pecans.

This was awesome.   I donated one to a pie auction and it brought high bids.  Like other reviewers, I added 1.5 cups of nuts and saved some whole ones back to put on top prior to baking.

This Pecan Pie ROCKS!!! I don't normally like pecan pie, but, my boyfriend is from the south and it is his fav so I thought I would give this recipe a shot. Everyone that ate it...loved it! Including me! This is a wonderful recipe...thank you soo much for sharing it. You know it's good if it can win a southerner's heart. I used a vinegar pie crust from another recipe posted out here...the two recipes went together very well.

My family LOVED this pie! My husband was very leary about a pecan pie without corn syrup. He was extremely pleased with the taste and asked my only to make this recipe in the future. I don't even like pecan pie, and I couldn't help eating a second helping.

My first time making this pie and it came out perfect(according to all who ate it). Mine pie formed a bit of a crust on top which all liked. Not sure if this happened to anyone else. Thanks for making me look like a skilled baker!!

I enjoyed the filling I don't actually eat pecan pies not a huge fan of nuts.  But my sister wanted one so I found this recipe.  It was a little different than what I normally do but thought it would be nice to try something different.  My Brother-in-law says he's stealing the recipe so I take it he enjoyed it a great deal.  Next time I might add more than a cup of nuts though that's my only change.

This pecan pie turned out perfectly, especially since this was my first try at making one.  Like another member recommended, use a deep dish crust. I used a standard 9" crust and it bubbled over the outer crust. Thanks for a great recipe!!

I have never ate pecan pie, so I thought I would try to make one and give it a go.  This pie was very tasty and pretty easy to make.  I didn't make any changes except adding a little more white sugar(I like a sweet pie).  I was a little concerned that it would be mushy because when I took it out of the oven it looked like it wasn't cooked after baking it for 40 minutes.  But I let it sit on the counter for a few minutes and thickened up.  I used a whole wheat buttery crust I made myself and it turned out just great.  Will be making again.

My family loved this pie.  I put halved pecans on the top instead of in the pie and they had a nice crunch to them.  The pie for me was a bit sweet and next time I might reduce some of the sugar or use Splenda for the white sugar.  But it was fabulous and I will make it again.

Easily a 5 star recipe, because the pie still tastes great without the traditional corn syrup.

this was great. my husband is a huge pecan pie fan. in fact- its his favorite dessert and he can eat half a pie in one sitting. I was tired of him buying the garbage one in the freezer department so i made this one. It tastes so much better. I used it with a buttery flaky pie crust on this site.

Using my own recipe for the pie crust, I substituted the light brown sugar with dark brown sugar and added an additional 1/2 cup of chopped pecans for a total of 1 and a half cups.  I baked the pie at 350 degrees for 15 minutes and at 300 degrees for 55 minutes.  The pie was wonderful with outstanding flavor.  Thank you for an easy, delicious recipe!

We are living abroad and don't have access to many ingredients.  So I was thrilled when Mom sent some pecans to make a pie, only to realize that I also couldn't get corn syrup, and that's too messy to ship!  So we tried this recipe and it was fantastic.  Took it to our American Thanksgiving celebration and everyone loved it.  This was yummy and I have already shared the recipe with 2 friends.

I made this for Thanksgiving and I wish I made a pecan pie w/ my usual recipe. It tasted OK, but the texture was grainy and it didn't look very appetizing.

The pie tasted great, it just looked kinda gross because the sugar separated from the rest of the filling and sat on top. I tried this recipe several times, always with the same result.

Excellent recipe!  I doubled the number of pecans and used the lower baking times (350 / 15 min, 300 / 50-55 min).

I absolutely hate pecans and walnuts!!!! I rarely bake with them, so when I was asked to make a pecan pie I came to Allrecipes.
This pie is to die for!!! I even ate it. I did overcook it a little but it was Tasty!!
Followed the recipe as is and it was great.
Thank you

I made this pie and it looked great right out of the oven.  Nice and golden brown.  Sampled a little from around the edge.  Nice texture.  However, when I cut it for dinner, it was all runny.  What did I do wrong?  I followed the recipe carefully.  Great taste, just runny.  Would chilling it have helped?

Absolutely fantastic!!
Only thing I did differently. I used a prebaked shortbread pie crust, and added in a little bit more chopped pecans.
The flavor is really amazing and I got rave reviews from very honest people who would've said if it wasn't very good.

UNBELIEVABLE!!  I took this pie over to my boyfriend's family this year...a conservative group that watched my every move.  Pulled this baby out and now I am accepted in the family.  They were literally eating out of the pie dish.   Will be making again for Christmas and every holiday to come!

WONDERFUL! Pecan Pie is one of the few recipes that I have ever had problems with. This recipe is so easy and tastes incredible. Sending it to my sister. Only change I made was to add a layer of pecans on top to give a nice look.

My whole family thought this recipe was much better than the traditional corn syrup recipe.  Even better than the blue ribbon recipes I have tried in the past!  Excellent recipe, it went right in my folder of favorites.  Thanks for posting!

I like that it doesn't have a "jello-like" consistency.  It is quick and easy to make and tastes absolutely delicious!  Much better than the types made with corn syrup!

WOW!  I made this for Thanksgiving, with several other pies, and this one was the number one favorite of everyone at dinner.  I cheated with store-bought crust, but it didn't matter, no one noticed the crust.  Everyone was pleased to hear that there was no corn syrup in the pie.  I'm making several more for the upcoming holidays, per requests.

I used a shortbread crust and cut the cooking time down to about 45 minutes. When I put the pecans in, I put 3/4 cup of them in the mix, then spread another half cup or so over the top. Then, I added a handful of Hershey's milk chocolate chips to the top of the pie. Everyone loved it and have repeatedly requested the recipe. I have to make it for our Christmas potluck at work.

I made this pie for the first time last year for Thanksgiving. I did it again this year for Christmas (actually finished it over an hour ago) And I just have to say, it is still the best pecan pie I have ever eaten! Absolutely delicious and so much better than corn syrup.

Great!
Added about a half cup more pecans.
Also, baked at 350 for about 10 min, then switched to about 320 for about 45-50 min.
Everyone loved it!

Would give 4.5 stars if possible. I was concerned about making this pie since it wasn't going to be as sweet as a pie made with Karo syrup.  I have a huge sweet tooth.  But, I liked the idea of trying something different and the recipe seemed very easy - and it was.  I wished I had seen the reviews to increase the amount of filling.  It was more shallow than say the pumpkin pies I made but it was adequate.  The taste was suprisingly great and plenty sweet.  I used the store bought roll out crust and added pecans on top for looks.  Next time I think I will add the cinnamon as another reviewer suggested...and increase the amount of filling.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and received RAVE reviews. In fact, my family told me that I need to ditch my career as a private investigator and open a pie shop. My family wants me to make this pie for all future family gatherings...I personally LOVED it and followed the recipe exactly. It was wonderful and HIGHLY recommended.

**The Best!**  I followed the recipe exactly.  The top of my pie looked dry when I took it out of the oven but once it was cut and served it was delicious.  I can't wait to make this pie again.  Thank you for a great recipe!!

This was the first pecan pie I had ever made and it was the best I have ever tasted! It was very very easy to make, took me about 10 min. in all. I liked it better without the karo syrup. This one is perfect!

This year will be my third year making this recipe.  It's great because a few members of my family are diabetic. I use room temp eggs and butter, splenda, top it with whole pecans, and I save a bit of the flothy eggs to brush on the whole pecans on the top to make them shiney - appearence taken care of.

This is a great recipe.  Those that say the taste and texture were not good should try it again.  

I followed the recipe with the following additions - the butter and eggs were room temp, added the butter to the mixed eggs while it was still warm/hot, I added a dash of salt and some cinnamon (maybe 1/2 tsp).  350 for 15 minutes and then 300 for 50 minutes.  I made one with splenda and one with the regular sugar both brown and white.  I pulled them out of the oven right before we sat down to eat dinner to let them set and cool, cut into one after dinner to check to see if they were ready and they were.  They were both EXCELLENT.  Yum, yum, yum!

My husband, who is not much of a pecan pie fan, loved it and ate 2 slices and said it was the best pecan pie he's ever had.  He likes that it's not as sweet and sticky as the kind made with corn syrup and so do I.

Okay, about 10 minutes before this pie was done, i laid half pecan pieces all around it and drizzled a mixture of brown sugar, butter, and two squares of baking chocolate over the top to "cement" the pecan halves in place.it turned out so beautiful and the filling cant be beat. so try this if you prefer a beautiful top on your pie.

I made these last night and while they might be OK if you cannot eat corn syrup, there is no comparison to the real thing. The pecans do not stick at all and it just does not taste the same. I remade my bars with corn syrup (just a bit less for less sweetness) & these are the real pecan pie flavor I love.

Very yummy. Following the recipe exactly yields not enough filling for my taste.  My recommendation is to double the filling but leave the pecans at 1 cup. Be careful not to overbake as the pie will dry out.

I love this pie. I made it for a thanksgiving party at work and it was a huge hit! Everyone said it tasted so much better without that sickly-sweet flavor you get from corn syrup. One coworker even asked me to make an extra pie just for him. I will definitely make this recipe again every chance I get.

This pie didn't look that good - it looked dry.  But, it was actually very good and a big hit with my extended family.  I'm not a big pecan pie fan, but those who were said they liked this better than the sickly sweet corn syrup pies.

This was my first time making Pecan Pie. With how easy and delicious it was, I will be making this pie more often. I love the crustiness of it instead of the goo. The only thing I did different was added another bag of pecans [whole].

This was my first pecan pie I have ever made and it turned out fantastic!  It wasn't sickly sweet and I think the fact that it doesn't have corn surup is the key!  I'm making again for a dinner party tonight!

Just for the record, this pie filling rises quite a bit.  I don't remember my corn-syrup based pie crust rising as much.  Taste wise, this recipe is awesome.

I loved this pie!  The first time I made it, the pie was good.  The second time I made it was better with pecans from pearsonfarm.com.  I always thought a pecan was a pecan.  But, the better quality nut made the difference.  Who knows how long some pecans have been sitting around the grocery store!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.  This pie has become a family tradition.

I made this for my daddy for his birthday. It's the first pie I ever made and it was so incredibly quick and easy!  I followed the advice of other reviewers: I topped with halved pecans to make the top more appealing and reduced the cooking temp to 350 for 10 minutes then 300 until done. My crust did not burn at all and the pecans on top were nice and crunchy. My dad said it was absolutely fantastic and didn't even notice that there wasn't any corn syrup in it!

Super easy to make!  Like other reviewers, I put the pie in initially for 15 minutes at 350, and reduced it down to 300 for another 55 minutes.  Great recipe!

I love this recipe. Talk about delicious. I also experimented a little and added extra virgin coconut oil in place of half of the butter. I didn't think this recipe could get any better, but wow. Coconut oil seems to work well with most nut-flavored recipes, and as an added bonus, the fatty acids in coconut oil actually speed up the metabolism. I think I have a keeper here.

I've had some good pecan pies in the past, but this one is the BEST!
I was short light brown sugar and substituted half dark and half light brown sugar. Soo good, and definitely worth making!

Great tasting recipe! I added a pinch of salt and increased the vanilla to 1 tablespoon - just my personal preference. It baked at 400 degrees for 10 minutes and then 300 degrees for about a hour. I tented it with foil after the first 15 minutes. Turned out golden brown, set up nicely and was delicious. Thanks!

Awesome pecan pie.  I also followed the suggestion of others to reduce to 300 for 45-50 minutes and it was perfect.  One of the best pecan pies I've ever had.

This was an awesome pecan pie!  I love that it doesn't contain Karo Syrup...makes it super easy to have the ingredients on hand to whip up a pie!  I make my own pie crusts and it is all SO yummy!

I'm not a pecan pie lover, but thought I'd try this for my dad. He enjoyed it and I actually became a convert -- I loved the pie as it isn't as sweet as the ones with corn syrup.  I've made it twice and reduced the temp to 300 and cooked longer as a reviewed suggested.  Both ways seemed ok.

Very yummy and easy to make. The only thing I didn't care for was the crusty film that formed on top of the pecans. Still a wonderful, easy recipe!

I made this version for the New Year's and received such rave reviews!! My Mom informed me that this was indeed the best pecan pie I have ever made and asked me for the recipe. I was amazed at how wonderful it turned out and tasted. My husband who's a very picky taster devoured a little less than half of it!!! This will make a wonderful addition to my holiday recipe collection. Thank you!!

This is an excellent pecan pie. I always love easy delicious recipes and am so happy that I have found another one here. I used this recipe to make two pecan pies this weekend, and my husband and friends all gave great comments on the pie. They cannot believe that the pecan pie can taste so delicious without using corn syrup ingredient. I followed other members' suggestion and baked the pie 10 minutes @ 400 degree and lowered the oven to 350 degree for additional 35 minutes. It came out perfect. You may want to let the pie chill for couple hours before you serve the pie. Thanks to Judi for sharing this great recipe!!!!

This was my first try at making a pecan pie, and it was terrific. I didn't want the hassle of having to go out and buy special syrup, etc., just to make one pie and was very happy with the result. It was super easy to make and was super yummy too! Thank you for sharing with us!

I've made this now at Thanksgiving and Christmas and it has been a huge hit every time.  To try to make it healthier, I've substituted margarine instead of butter and used half splenda brown sugar mix and half regular sugar.  None of my guests could taste the splenda or missed the butter and I've gotten raves on it both times.  This one is a keeper.

I was very careful to follow directions on this and read the reviews as I have never eaten or made a pecan pie.  I didn't try this one either, but can tell you that it looks like no other pecan pie I have seen.  Made it to add to our Christmas dessert collection and some said it was very good.  My grandmother on the other hand, offered me HER recipe.  I'll probably just stick to apple pie in the future ;o)

Awesome, awesome, awesome!
Put half pecans on top, which added a nice crunch. It looked dry when I pulled it out of the oven so we were worried about it, but it blew us all away. It's soft and chewy but not too too sweet - yay and thanks!

Surprisingly nice... The filling set and was good. It wasn't grainy at all. I was skeptical, but I'm glad I tried this recipe, it does make a decent pie. I used a bunch of pecan halves just because it's tradition. I still prefer the way the filling is more "jellied" with the karo syrup, but this was really decent and will do in a pinch if you don't have karo on hand. A good back up pie.

WOW!  My first Pecan Pie... A SUCCESS!  We got our pecans from Charleston, SC.. picked ourselves from my brothers front yard.  So there was a lot of hard work with this pie (hints the nuts)!   I made two in one night!  Also, I cooked the pie at 300 for about 50 minutes... PERFECT!  My husband is a excellent food critic and loved it :) We had fun cooking tbis easy, yet delicous pie together!

this is the first pecan pie, well, first PIE i have ever made. my husband didn't believe that i made it, he is insisting that it is store bought. it tastes AMAZING and i don't even like pecan pie because it's usually too sweet. this one definitely is not too sweet, it has the perfect amount of sugar. so i give this recipe 5 stars!!!

this was pretty darn tasty. however, something weird happened.  i followed the recipe to the letter, but the pie ended up with a weird crust on the top, that tasted sort of like a meringue, but was brown. the pecans did not rise, so you couldn't tell it was a pie from the looks of it.  i think it might have been because i beat the eggs until they were frothy?  (as i thought the recipe indicated?)  at any rate, it was very tasty even though it looked like no other pie i'd ever seen. ps. the first night, the pie was a little runny, but after being in the fridge it firmed up nicely. perhaps we should have cooked it longer, or let it cool completely before serving?

Easy, quick recipe. Now karo syrup is one less thing I have to keep in my small pantry. Also, it can be made with an egg beater and I didn't have to clean the big mixer. I use a Pillsbury pie dough in the dairy aisle that you unroll. It is not a frozen pie crust although that would  probably be fine too. Be sure to keep an eye on it while baking, the crust edges brown so quickly I always cover it with foil.  I like serving it with Redi-Whip or ice cream.

Really good. Toasted and ground 1 c pecans and added them to the mix (on top of the 1 c pecans already in the recipe) and used the baking trick that everyone else has talked about. Best pecan pie ever! Could cut the sugar a bit, especially with the toasted pecans to add body.

The taste of this pie is very similar to the corn syrup recipe.  It's still very sweet and delicious.  The difference is more in the texture.  More substantial...not so "jelly"-like in the inside.  I don't think anyone is going to beg me for this recipe but I am going to make it a "keeper" simply because I'm more likely to have these ingredients on hand.

Ugh... Thanksgiving meal is over, and I had too much pecan pie like usual. This pecan pie is different... I did not whip the egg whites, but put the eggs in whole as suggested by one reviewer- my pie turned out with a liquidy center and a top crust, nothing akin to a brownie pie. The taste is fabulous, sooooo good, but the texture leaves alot to be asked for- I don't know if it would have been perfect if I'd done the eggs right. Oh- and maybe just a tad less sweet. I can't believe I'm saying that.

Great pie!  It has a creamier texture in the middle than the usual pies and I didn't have any trouble with the insides being leaky, which I sometimes do with the usual recipe.

FANTASTIC!!!  I am not a fan of pecan pie, but I am in charge of bringing one for turkey day this year, so I did a trial run this weekend with this recipe. I have made three more pecan pies in the past two days.  I brought one into work and everyone loves it and I am handing out the recipe.  Highly recommend this recipe and it takes 10 minutes to mix.  super easy!

I had small 8" pie shells that i used.  I decided they looked so small that I could make two pies out of one filling recipe.  I am glad I did because there is no way it would have all fit in one pie shell.  My pies didn't look like the picture, they looked like normal pecan pie with all the nuts on top.  Very very good, everyone loved it.
Thanks, Michele, Cambridge Ontario Canada

Absolutely Delicious!!! Followed recipe as stated.  This is definetely a keeper.  NO CORN SYRUP makes a huge difference in texture, but not taste.

I have never made a pecan pie before. A friend asked me to bake one for her so I went to All Recipes and tried this one. My friend and all of her guests raved about this. She said it's rich and she cut smallish pieces but she said it was the best one she has had since her Grandmother used to bake them.

I would give this 10 stars if possible.  I have given this recipe out so many times and it is now the pecan pie recipe my mother uses for holidays as well.  This is just the right amount of sweet and buttery flavor and so easy to make!

PERFECT!  I put it at 300 after ten minutes, let it go for 45, and it was absolutely perfect!  I can't wait to see how they go over at Christmas!  :)  Thanks so much, Elaine!

SOOO GOOD! I made this, my first pecan pie and first pie ever, for Thanksgiving. Everyone loved it! One taster said it was the best pecan pie she'd ever had & she loved that it wasn't all syrupy & oozey like the ones with corn syrup tend to be. I got lots of requests to share the recipe. This one's a keeper!

I made it for my mother in law who is a Palmetto State native, she raved about this pie as well. Growing up down south I have had many a pecan pie and this is by far the best I have ever tasted. The pecans stay nestled inside the filling, the topping becomes crunchy and like one review say's it gets better with time.

I don't even like pecan pie and I really enjoyed this. Typically, pecan pie is way too sickly sweet and gelatinous for me, but this was great. I used 1 1/3 c. pecans and also put pecan halves on the top. I used dark brown sugar because light brown sugar is not available where I live. Great recipe! Tasted like rich praline pecans!

This recipe is amazing!  It's not too dense, and not too sticky.  I could have eaten the whole pie myself in one sitting!  I did chose to use praline pecans instead of regular, and I put some of them on top half way through the cooking.  I LOVE this recipe!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Wow!  I do not love pecan pie but make one every Thanksgiving for my husband.  This recipe is the very best!  It does not have the cloyingly sweet, artificial taste of pies made with corn syrup.  Instead of just a bite, I ate an entire piece of this delightful pie!

This was a nice spin on traditional pecan pies, but I disagree with the reviewers that claimed that it was less sweet. I found the opposite to be true. I really liked it's unique flavor, but found that it didn't quite set-up as it should.

This is so easy to make and delicious too!  I added about 1/4 cup more pecans and thought that it was perfect.  Careful on the cooking time.  Mine was done in 30 minutes.

Great pie!  Everyone enjoyed it, from those who have been indulging in pecan pie for years to those who never like pecan pie before.  I used a mix of chopped pecans and pecan halves, probably about 1 1/3 cups total.  Before putting the pie in the oven I pressed 4 pecan halves in the middle of the top of the pie in an "x" shape as decoration.

This pie went over really well. I had to quick whip up a pie for a shortage on Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. Much less sweet and sticky than the corn syrup variety. I will make this one again.

I thought this was incredible. Even my husband who has a **major** sweet-tooth usually turns his nose up at pecan pie as he thinks it will be too sweet - but I couldn't get him away from this one! Awesome, will make this again.

A great pecan pie recipe.  I used pecans in the filling and then placed extra in a spoke fashion on top before baking. It was a hit the year.
Will definitely make it again.

Excellent! I made 2 of these for a large THanksgiving gathering at my church, and they were delicious. People were hesitant at first, since we are in the deep south and we *know* our pecan pies here, but once they tasted it, it was a winner!

Absolutley delicious! It had a wonderful light texture. I made it for a dinner party and it received wonderful reviews. I am in Australia and corn syrup is difficult to get, so this recipe is a god send.
I am going to make it for Christmas lunch this year.

This pecan pie was really easy to make.  This was the first pecan pie I attempted and I am happy with the end result.  Although I did not follow directions to a "T", I did not chop the pecans.  Recipe still ended up great with some really nice compliments from relatives at the Thanksgiving dinner.  I was told by my husbands grandfather that it tasted like his late mother in laws.  The flavor of this pie is just right even with out the use of caro syrup.  I give it 5 stars.

This is a great recipe.  I had never made a Pecan pie before but offered to make one for Thanksgiving.  After reviewing many of them, I liked that this one did not have the corn syrup.  I don't care for the syrupy pecan pies.  This was delicious and easy!  I used dark brown sugar since that is what I had.  I also sprinkled some chopped and whole pecans over the top before baking for a more artistic appearance.  This one is a keeper!

My husband loves pecan pie so I attempted this for the first time. I followed the recipe exactly except I put extra pecans on top to make it look pretty. This was awesome. It has all the flavor I was looking for without being "too sweet" like most can be. We loved it. Thank you for the recipe!!

This was fantastic! Easy and delicious. HOWEVER, I added 1 MORE cup of pecans. As one other person said, Cook about 1/2 way thru then add the whole pecans to the top. The Topping comes out a little different looking than traditional pecan as it is from the regular sugar bubbling I suppose but it didnt hamper the taste or look at all! After all the struggle of makign thanksgiving dinner it was sooo nice to cap off a great meal with Hearty and sincere remarks of how good it was and how much better than the caro syrup recipes!

Yummmmm!!  I've never made Pecan Pie before, and have only been able to eat the tiniest bit before because they are usually way too sweet.  I guess my only complaint is that it's too good and I've eaten wayyyy too much!  My Pecan Pie hating hubby even likes it!!

Very good flavor, extremely easy to make. A little grainy in texture. Overall not the best pecan pie recipe I've tried but good to have this recipe for those times when you're craving pecan pie and don't have corn syrup on hand.

This is the end-all to beat-all of pecan pies. Say goodbye to that icky, gooey corn syrupy filling and hello to rich, yummy goodness! Once you try this, you'll never go back to the other!

There’s no going back to pies made with corn syrup. This is the best pecan pie I’ve ever had! The only changes I made were lowering the baking temperatures that other reviewers suggested, and I used almost two cups of pecans.  Sooo good.

Lowered final baking temp to 300, for 45 minutes, per comments.  I also added more pecans on top to fill the shell.

This will be my go-to pecan pie recipe from now on - I love the texture minus the corn syrup and the flavor is out of this world!!  I did take the advice of others and altered the baking time/temp as follows:  10 min @ 350 followed by 40 min @ 300.   I took the pie out of the oven after the first 10 min and placed pecan halves on top.  Thanks!

I've made this three times, and each time was a wild success! I am a part-time baker and I sell a lot of cakes and cookies, etc. My husband says that this is THE BEST thing I've ever made, hands down. I one and a halfed the ingredients for the filling, it made a fuller pie that way. I cover the edges of my pie with foil so they don't get burnt. I baked it for 10 minutes at 350, took it out and added more pecans on top, then baked it the rest of the way at 300. One is in the oven right now!

Didn't completely fill my standard-sized pie dish (it was about 1/2  inch below the rim) but it didn't make a difference. In the end, it was delicious and I wouldn't change a thing. I did add more (whole) pecans to the top after I poured the mix in the dish. That dressed it up to look more like a pecan pie. A big hit with the family. Will definitely make this again!

My family loves this pie!  I love that i don't have to keep corn syrup on hand for it.  Definitely will be my go-to recipe for pecan pie.  

I know some people have trouble with it not filling the pie shell - never been a problem for me, but I also don't build up the crust too much.  I also use pie shields (or aluminum foil) to protect the exposed crust and it's always turned out well, not burnt at all.

This pie was exceptional!!  Not as gooey or sweet as pecan pies made with syrup. Will definitely make this one again. And again!

The taste was exceptional, however the appearance was off-putting. I wish that I had read the comments about the soufflé like appearance of the pie if you did not top it with additional pecans prior to baking before I attempted this recipe as one my contributions to Thanksgiving dinner this year. I will definitely make this again, with a few minor adjustments (Additional pecans in the mix and top with pecan halves prior to baking) as the flavor was spot on, and I absolutely love the fact that this perfect flavor was achieved without using corn syrup! Delicious!

Delicious. Other reviewers talked about a weird color but I didn't find it weird.   Mine was golden brown and looked great. I made a nice pecan design on the top.  Also bumped up chopped pecans in filling. Probably about 1.5 cups total.

The recipe was easy to follow and tasted wonderful. HOWEVER, since this was my first time making pecan pie, I did not know you’re supposed to cover the pie with a layer of pecan halves. The recipe did not specify this step. Although the pie tasted amazing, it was pretty ugly to look at.

Although when cooked, my pie did not look like the photo on the webpage, this was a very delicious and flavorful pie.  Sweet, of course, in the same way as the corn syrup variety, but was happier with the natural ingredients of plain sugar.  Will make this recipe from this point forward.  A previous review said that it didn't fill up his/her pie shell, so I purchased a regular size instead of a deep dish size.  It overflowed, so I believe I would have been okay with the deep dish size.  Oh, well...

Absolute delicious and easy to make! I took everyone else’s advice and Cooke at 350 for 10 mins and down to 300 for 55ish until the pie was set.  Will definitely make it again!

Delicious recipe. I love that it doesn't have the corn syrup. I've gone back to this several holidays now. I always cut the white sugar out, bump up the pecans a bit and add a splash of whiskey or bourbon. The biggest problem is that it doesn't make enough to fill the crust all the way to the top, so I've been trying to make about 50% more filling than what the recipe yields. This year, I did 1.5 cups of pecans, 3/4 c butter and three eggs. It filled the shell, but the extra egg made the filling rise pretty high. Luckily, when it cooled the pecan center came back down to earth and all was deliciously well.

I used a premade pie crust which was frozen prior to use. I baked at 300° for 45 mins and the crust came out perfect! It looks cakey rather than caramel like, which pecan pies typically look like. Tastes  good nonetheless

This was so good!  I made this exactly as recipe is written, except for added more pecans, and cooked in 300 oven for 50 minutes.  I cooked just until the top started to crack, and it was perfect.  This pecan pie was not too sweet, delicious!  You cannot go wrong with this recipe!

Great recipe! 
I didn't have brown sugar, so I used white sugar with 1 1/2 T of molasses instead. I put a little extra molasses in to try to make it denser and more rich, and while I don't know exactly what this recipe would taste like as written, I (and my guests) loved the texture and taste of this pie.

I love this recipe quite a bit. I used it the first time I ever made pie and paired it with a flaky oil crust. I even added some crust on top. The taste was amazing, the only change I made was adding a bit more pecans because I love them. The pie was kind of runny inside but that was likely my own issue. I would definitely make this again.

So this is the 4th time I've made this recipe and my family is hooked!  Even my deep-south In laws thought it great and were shocked to hear it didn't have any corn syrup.  I do add an additional 1/2 cup of pecans and double the vanilla.  There's never any leftovers, so I try to make extra pies.  Thank you for the recipe!!

Simplest put this is not the Southern Pecan Pie I was raised with.  There was nothing wrong with it but it had a (tasty) crust on the top.  The pecans did not shine through.  It was viewed in my house as a mistake.  This recipe, IMHO is not holiday worthy.  Back to Karo syrup.

I've made this particular recipe for years, now. I use dark brown sugar vs light brown sugar. It adds another layer of flavor, I think. Everyone has lived this pie!

Very happy with this recipe! I did turn the heat down to 325 - my oven runs a little hot. The sweetness was perfect and it had the perfect amount of crispiness from the crust and pecans. Will definitely be making this one again.

Outstanding results from such a simple recipe. I had family members swearing that I had purchased this pie instead of my making it. They couldn't believe that I could have made a pecan pie so perfect. It is easy to make, the most difficult part was aligning the pecans on top., Baked quickly and was absolutely delicious. I'll not use another recipe for pecan pie.

I gave this a try for Thanksgiving based on reviews, simplicity and NO CORN SYRUP! I added 1 extra cup of crushed pecans on top, used a Gluten Free crust, almond flour and milk, organic brown sugar and organic raw cane sugar.   
I and my family ate this right up.  I couldn't even wait to get home for a 2nd serving but my kids had already devoured it.  It's not traditional but I like it better knowing it's healthier.

I had never made a pie before and I wanted to make a pecan pie for Thanksgiving in honor of my mom since it was our first Thanksgiving without her. She used to make it and I couldn’t find her recipe. This turned out great. It was delicious and easy. I think I put it in a pie dish that was too deep because it needed more filling. Otherwise it was great! Couldn’t have been more pleased. And yay me! My mom is looking down at me and feeling proud!

I turned this recipe into a version of pecan bars. I added 50%more of the ingredients and put it in a 13X9 pan with an oil and flour crust. I let it cool and cut into squares. They were perfect for our Thanksgiving dessert with a little whipped cream on top!

This is the best pecan pie recipe I have ever tried. So many pecan pies have an overly sweet, sticky texture and this one was perfect. It also cuts beautifully with the chopped pecans rather than the large. This will definitely be my go-to from now on!

I think I cooked mine too long due to reviewers suggestions; it was a little dry for my liking. I reduced the temp, but cooked 50 minutes as suggested by some. Don't do that. Also don't add the extra 1/2 c of nuts as suggested by a reviewer. The flavor was very good. I'll try it again as written originally.

Loved it! I followed some of the reviews and baked it at 400 for the 10 minutes and then decreased the temperature to 300 instead of 350 for about 55 minutes. The only change I will make next time is to use 1.5 cups of pecans instead of just 1 cup

I've made this pecan pie for years. Friends ask for it every Thanksgiving. Add extra pecans and toast the chopped ones going into the mix, then add more untoasted ones 10 minutes into baking time. Do the staggered baking  (10 min/400 degrees, 20 min/350 degrees, 20 min./325 degrees ) . My secret ingredient, which I think is what hooks everyone, is 1/4 cup Maker's Mark in the mix along with a little extra flour to help with the extra liquid.

No changes made.  Very good, was pleasantly surprised.
Next time, I will probably  increase the filling ingredients so as to have a fluffier pie.

I used 1 C dark brown sugar and cut out the white sugar, also used 1 T of cream instead of milk.  I added the remainder of an 8 oz bag of chopped pecans to the top to fill the crust and dropped in 1/2 C of chocolate chips that I intended to put on the bottom, but forgot to put in first, so I just dabbed them in until they sank below the surface.  

I baked it in a small Miele speed oven on convection bake preheated, then baked at 400 for 10 minutes then down to 325 for 60 minutes.  It is the best pecan pie my husband and I have ever had! Not too gooey or sugary and really nutty. I adore pecans but don't like sugary sweets. This is an elegant version that lets the pecans be the star of the show.

Definitely delicious. I skipped the vanilla and added bourbon. Toasted the pecans and broke into bite size pieces. No brown sugar so I made my own by adding molasses which create a intense flavor taking raw but cooked very well. Made my own butter crust.

This recipe works for me.  I don't usually have Karo handy but plenty of sugars. Can't tell the difference.  I almost feel like this recipe is a bit more rich.  That's what you want from a pecan pie, right?

Delicious! I did the 15 min at 350° and 55 min at 300° and it perfect. The pie was done before I was even able to get a slice of my own, luckily I was able to taste one tiny bite my husband was willing to part with. Haha.

I substituted Splenda for the sugar and brown sugar and it turned out quite tasty! It's probably not as chewy as the original recipe but it's a bit healthier...

Excellent!  I used margarine by accident and it was just fine. Also reduced heat to 350 for the first part and then 300 for 40 minutes.  The pie was gone in a skinny minute (although skinny is not a relative term for this pie!!).

Baked at 350 for 10  minutes and then reduced the temp to 300 and continued baking till done - about 20 to 30 minutes. Tried the pie 2 ways. One was as suggested in a pie dish with a pre-made pie crust. The other way was in a 11 X 7 dish with a home-made graham cracker base and 1.5 times the filling. Both were good, though I over baked the one with the graham cracker base.
Next time, I will reduce or eliminate the white sugar as it was a tad too sweet for me. But still a great recipe as is!

Followed the recipe as written. I did let eggs get to room temp & perhaps used a rounded cup of chopped pecans + saved a few pretty ones to decorate top before baking. Super easy & so delicious!!! Thank you for sharing.

Best Pecan Recipe I've came across so far! The whole family loves it! We make at least two a week during the holiday season because we are fortunate enough to have pecan trees on our property! They are not tired of it yet!

I made it for Christmas. Luckily it was just me and my husband. We shared one piece, the rest went in the garbage. It was like eating baked sugar. We like my mother's recipe with three eggs and the corn syrup. Maybe it's what I'm used to. But then again, my husband never had it until we met.

Wowza. Gorgeous.  Convection oven changed temperature settings, 400 initial, 10 minutes. Dropped to 300 as previously suggested, baked 45 min till crust cracked on top. I also had to make and extra 1/2 batch of filling to fill my deep pie pan.  OMG. I’ll never use Karo in my pecan pie again.

Made this pie as an experiement for thanksgiving, it was a smash hit and was requested again at christmas. The only thing i did differently would be tempering the eggs before adding them to hot butter

We always add 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to the pie before filling, and the add 1/2 cup of crushed pecans to the top after the first 10 minutes of baking.

This is a great recipe, I feel like the corn syrup ones are just giant blocks of candy, but this one is amazing. What I usually do is run the pecans through a food processor until they're fairly fine, and also mix in chocolate and a bit of bourbon for the filling. Then for the top of the pie I use whole pecans for the aesthetics.  This is a crowd pleaser every year for Christmas!

This was great and fairly easy to make. The first time came out too sweet, so cut light brown sugar to 3/4 cup. I was also told to add more pecans. Some things people have said is to bring eggs and pie crust to room temperature before beginning. With these minor adjustments, the pie was delicious and has become my go to dessert for events.

Loved this! I only had ¼ cup corn syrup so I tried this but had low expectations. It was amazing! I am dairy free so I used margarine and skipped the milk and followed another reviewer's recommendation to add whole pecans to the top for looks. Delicious, a keeper!

This  was a simple and tasty pie.  You really can't see the pecans like "traditional" pecan pies unless after pouring the mix in the pie pan you either 1) reserve some pecans to set on top of the pie, or 2) add additional pecans to resemble what a traditional pie might look like.  I laid out the pecans on 1/2 the pie.   Truthfully it isn't necessary as the pie tastes great on it's own.  Just be prepared to know it looks "different".  I will make it again.

I have never made pecan pie or particularly liked it because it is way too sweet. My husband asked me to make it for him and I added the chocolate chips. I loved it! Big hit at Thanksgiving this year. I was told that the lack of corn syrup made all the difference.

First pecan pie I've ever made and it turned out perfectly! So much better than frozen and not as sweet as the corn syrup version! I followed the directions, didn't change a thing and it's perfect!

I made this for  Thanksgiving this year and have to say it is the BEST pecan pie recipe I've ever eaten. Everyone raved about it and said it is a must for future gatherings.  The only changes I made were what was already suggested, which is to add an additional half cup of pecans and decrease the temperature. I covered the crust except for the last 20 minutes to keep it from burning.

Good starter recipe. My only complaints are that the baking instructions are not good (I did 350 for about an hour with great results) and as written, there wouldn't have been enough nuts. I added 2c chopped pecans to the filling and another cup on top of the pie. As written, I think it's about 3 stars. With my changes, it's 5 stars.

Fantastic! I have a friend who is sensitive to corn syrup and can't have regular pecan pie, so I tried this one.   It is a hit!  I will be using this recipe from now on.  I did add a few extra pecans.

Use this recipe every Thanksgiving. I always read the other reviews and make some tweaks. This year I toasted the chopped pecans in the oven for about 5 minutes,  added 1 cup of brown sugar to the melted butter and whisked until smooth. Added in 2 tbs maple syrup,  the vanilla as listed, half & half and then added that to the eggs.  I mixed the toasted pecans, plus an additional 1/2 cup that I didn't toast, into the egg mixture and poured it into a GF graham cracker crust. I omitted the flour  entirely.  I baked at 350 for 10 minutes and then lowered the heat to 300 and baked for another 40 minutes. Came out perfect!

My family loved it!! Easy to make. 
It just looked very different than a traditional peacan pie. It was a different texture on top.
I didn’t use chopped pecans so that may be one reason. 
I had to wait for oven so it sat in the pie plate for a while before going in oven. 
It was delicious my husband loved it.

I made this instead of my mom's traditional recipe and loved it. I added more pecans in the mix and when I took it out between oven temps (350 to 300) I arranged more on top for a more traditional look. Also, I decided to add a few tablespoons bourbon to the filling and a splash more vanilla (put in a tablespoon or so of extra flour to offset the extra liquid). I liked that it wasn't overly sticky and sweet like the Karo syrup pies. I always place foil around my pie edges so they don't burn or get too brown too.

DELICIOUS and the texture was actually perfect, but definitely lacking in presentation. As others have said, the cooking time is off. I had to turn the oven way down and wasn't sure what I was going to end up with. The sugar burned on top and it wasn't a pretty pie. I refrigerated it over night to make sure it was set. But none the less, it was everyone's favorite at my Thanksgiving table. Presentation is important to me so I'm only giving it 3 stars.

This is a great recipe! I adapted it to be gluten free (gluten free frozen crust) and substituted Pillsbury’s g-f flour. I also made it dairy free by substituting Earth Balance (butter flavored). The caramelizing taste of real butter was absent, but honestly, for what it didn’t have, it was *very* good (evidenced by the BF finishing half the pie off in two seatings....). Will definitely make again. Thank you!

I've made this for the past two years,  this one will make three. it's always a hit!! There are never leftovers. At least two people ask for the recipe. 
My only changes are, I added a half- handful of crushed pecans into the sugar mix & I also use a pre-made graham cracker crust which gives it a certain edge. Serve it warm, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and you can't go wrong!

This was AWESOME!  My first time making and eating pecan pie...and I’m a convert. It was easy and my hubby and I both loved it. I used refrigerated Pillsbury crust and I floured both sides of the dough before putting in the pie dish (per Pillsbury’s instructions for pecan pie). Added 1/2 cup chocolate chips too. I followed the suggestions to bake at 350 for 15 min then 300 for 40 more minutes. Had just started to crack in the middle...let it sit overnight in the fridge and it was perfect. I served warmed for 12 min at 300 to melt the chocolate.  Yummmm!  Will definitely make again!

I took the advice to bake it at 300 degrees for 45+ minutes, but I also had the problem with the filling coming away from the shell. Also, I just generally don't like the way the finished product looks. I prefer the clear-glossy look at the end where you can clearly see the pecans, rather than a dull brown coating that could have anything under it. It doens't really "shine" or have as presentable of a look. I live in abroad where I can't get corn syrup, but I remember doing another recipe in the past with a honey and/or molasses combo that came out looking more like the classic pecan pie "look." I also prefer keeping the pecans whole!

This pie has good flavor. I made it the way the direction indicated. Baked at 400 for 15 min. I then turned down to 350. If I would of baked it for 30 to 40 min it would of over baked. I checked it at 20 and it was done. The down side was I didn't think it filled the pie shell. I will make another pie and double it and see how it turns out. Like I said the flavor is good and I didn't miss the dark corn syrup.

Fantastic -- easy to make and even easier to eat! Wonderful flavor, not that sicky sweet some p. pies have. It did seem a little drier, but that might have been me. When it tested done, the crust was still very pale, so I upped the temp to 450 and left it for 5 mins. to make the crust a little more golden. It disappeared immediately after it was cut at our church supper.
Definitely my go to pecan pie recipe.

Great basic recipe, I tend to add more spices (cinnamon, ginger, a dash of clove) when I make mine and I'll top it with whole pecans for that added crunch and curb appeal. This is a great recipe without corn syrup which I really appreciate. People love this pie!

I found this recipe to be very good. Mine turned out a little crumbly, but I wonder if it's because I used Fat Free Milk. We really enjoyed the flavors and we'll make it again. Thanks!

It was good but such a different texture from the Karo Syrup ones I'm used to. Perhaps I overcooked it or perhaps it's supposed to be drier and less "creamy" than the KS. Also, when I first cut it, it seemed like it just tasted like a brown sugar pie. But the longer it sat, the better it did taste (started losing the overwhelming brown sugar taste) and closer to a real pecan pie taste about 8-10 hrs. later. I will probably just go with Karo Syrup next time, although the only other time I made that one, it didn't set up for me, which is why I wanted to try this one. Maybe it's time to try again, though.

Taste wise, very good and very sweet. Just a tip thats not mentioned in the recipe, refrigerate for about two hours otherwise it will be very runny and will not look very appetizing.

Follow the instructions and it'll come out great ...

Looks different but is delicious and crusty. Don't peek in the oven at all, it'll throw off the temp too much. I typically have to let it cook for at least 5-10 min longer.

My mods:
Cook at 350 degrees for the first ten minutes.
Don't overwhip the eggs
Add 1/2 C pecans on top.
Use no fail crust recipe
Reduce to 300 degrees and cook for 40 more minutes. Cover with foil at the 20 minute mark.

This pie blew my mind. I followed some of the modifications on the temperature and cook time in the comments. I also topped the pie with halved pecans. It was the best pecan pie I have ever had. Oh and I used a simple oil, flour, and salt crust recipe.

Not sure why there are so many reviews about how this recipe doesn't give you a proper looking pecan pie. Mine turned out perfectly and looked amazing!!

Here are some changes I made to the recipe after looking at the other reviews:
- cut out white sugar
- used 1 1/2 cup pecans
- baked at 350 degrees for 10 mins, then lowered to 300 degrees for 40 mins

Best pecan pie EVER. I used to have a love/hate relationship with pecan pie. I loved the pecans and the sweetness, but HATED that gel stuff. This recipe is amazing. I've made it for the holidays and just because, and people can't believe it this delicious without corn syrup. Sometimes I add a little bourbon to the adults only pie!

This recipe was awesome! We used pecans from my in laws trees.  I followed other suggestions and started the first 15 min at 350, then reduced to 300 for an additional 55 min. Also put halves of pecans on top after placing the filling in to look nice. Everyone raved!

Replaced our usual pumpkin pie with this one for Christmas dinner along with our usual Dutch apple pie.  It was a hit and by consensus apple and pecan pies will be our new tradition.
Did not have the gelatinous texture usually associated with pecan pie.  Very easy and delicious--my favorite combination.

My mother was skeptical when I told her it did not require corn syrup. One bite took all the skepticism away. Now I am expected to bake this every Thanksgiving. I am not much of a pecan pie person but this is an exception. Amazing!

Absolutely DELICIOUS!! A little too sweet for my tooth but it was good and my family loved it. Best it didn't have nasty corn syrup in it. Will be making again and again because it became a favorite.

Delicious! Loved that this recipe did not call for any syrup. I added about an additional 1/4 cup of pecans and it turned out wonderful, it is quite sweet though. Shared it with family on Thanksgiving and it was a hit with all. Thank you for the great recipe!

My best friend and I made this for our Thanksgiving dinner and we were skeptical about not adding corn syrup, as our grandmas always used it.  So, we added an 1/8 cup.  We also sprinkled more pecans on the top of the pie, once it was poured into the pie shell.  This pie was delicious!  Our husbands and kids might have shed a tear when the last piece was eaten.

This is the first time I made a Pecan Pie...I took the recommendation of another review and purchased the Mrs. Smith's Pie Crust in the freezer section and was glad...the crust was AwEsOmE!  I followed the directions to a "T" and it was absolutely wonderful...Everyone loved it with options of Vanilla Ice Cream or Cool-Whip...the entire pie was gone!

NOTE:  In case if anyone else is wondering...I made this the day before and put it in the fridge.  You could not tell the difference.

It's not bad but the top was not pretty (3 stars). Maybe I should make a layer of pecans next time. The taste is great (5 stars). Used Butter Flaky Crust off AR. * UPDATE* Will double or even triple the recipe and put pecans on top next time to fit my pie pans.

This recipe is fantastic!  I liked how there wasn't any corn syrup, I think it helped cut the sweetness of the pie which my family and I enjoyed.  I followed other reviews and baked the pie at 350 for 10 minutes and then 300 for about 50.  The pie came out perfectly.  Can't wait to make it again!

This was a keeper! Love the fact that it is made with pantry ingredients without corn syrup. I am not normally a pecan pie fan because I find that they tend to be too sweet, without appealing flavor. I only ate a small amount of the pie, but enjoyed the rich, caramel  flavor. My husband,  the pecan pie connoisseur, strongly approved.  One note, I bought a steel pie plate that was listed as 8.5 inches,  which was perfectly filled by this recipe. If I had used my regular 9 inch glass pie plates, I would have needed to double the ingredients to fill it.

Jlynpeterson's review was very helpful. I baked this pie along with my pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving and amended the oven temperatures for both, which worked very well. I started them out at 350° and reduced the temperature to 325° after 10 minutes. I think this recipe would be perfect as originally submitted if you use a smaller pie pan than the standard 9 inch, but if like me you don't have one, then the suggestion of adding another half cup of pecans after the pie is poured was very helpful. Very delicious recipe!

This is the best Pecan Pie recipe I have found, and I have made several. My husband loves Pecan Pie and is quite the connoisseur of Pecan Pie. I always use the Basic Flakey Pie crust recipe from this site, and Baked 350 for 15 minutes and reduced oven to 300 for 50-55 minutes. 
The Pie is a bit sweet, although that is what classic Pecan pie is. This pie ends up with a beautiful finished slight crust to the top of the pie. I also add a layer of halved Pecans to the top of the pie before baking and you can't go wrong with this recipe.

Almost a 5 star. Two things I would change or want differently. A. I think it could use more chopped pecans. B. I would likely the consistency to be slightly thicker/gelatinous. Other than that great taste and flavor. This my first time baking it after a 5 year hiatus but it still turned out great.

It was delicious. After reading the comments the only changes we made were changing the baking to 15 minutes at 350, then 55 minutes at 300, and sprinkling some pecans on top after the filling was poured into the crust.

Not my favorite pecan pie, I definitely prefer pecan pie made with Karo syrup. I gave this a rating of 2 because my husband did enjoy it.

Did what another reviewer suggested, baked at 350 for 15 minutes, then at 300 for another 50 minutes. Turned out perfect!

Voted the BEST PECAN PIE by the entire family! Been making these for 48 years and this one won hands down!! Only difference, I added 2 full cups of chopped pecans, and decorated entire top with pecan halves.... as you can see, we love pecans!!! Taste was Outstanding, not runny at all!! Followed the rest of directions!!

My husband likes pecan pie, but he LOVED this one!  He rarely has seconds when it comes to sweets but he had thirds with this one.  My mother-in-law even had seconds!  The only thing is I think I beat the eggs too long as the top was more smooth and crackly, not many pecans showing, but the inside was nice and gooey like I like.  Definite keeper!!

I love pecan pie. I don't like the idea of using corn syrup. This recipe is great! I used about 2/3 of the sugar called for, which I thought worked well as I don't like my desserts too sweet. I also made a cookie crust because it's very difficult to find ready-made pie crusts in Germany. I followed the recommendation of others and cooked it at 350F for 15 minutes and then 300F for 45 minutes. I thought that worked out well. I also made this in a casserole dish because I was worried that my pie dish (which is an 11-inch) would be too big. Would definitely make this again!

My mom made pecan pie with corn syrup every year when I was a kid. This recipe nails the flavor, but curbs the sweetness with a perfect mixture of sweet and nut, loved it! I won't make it any other way.

Got many compliments on this pie, it was delicious! I baked it on 350 for 10 minutes then 300 for 40 minutes. Left out the 1/4 cup of white sugar. Had a creamy texture, which made it even more delicious, unlike overly sweet gooey corn syrup pecan pie. Will be making this  many more times! My new fave pecan pie recipe.

Super amazing. I've made pecan pie before and burnt it. So I was a little apprehensive at first.  This pie turned out super super amazing. It was so perfect and way better than a store bought pie. I think I'll scrap pumpkin pie and just two pecan pies from now on!!!!

I didn't think it would be accurate to give 5 stars because I modified the recipe to be completely full of pecans first, then pour the syrup on to fill. Also had a graham cracker crust instead of pastry--was concerned that would make it weird, but it all worked out great, and we all loved it! Definitely a do-again.

This was a really good pie, although I used all brown sugar instead of the white and added more nuts.  Everyone loved it and next time I will make two.

Great recipe! Tastes wonderful and easy to make. I tried it because I had never made a pecan pie before and was afraid to mess one up last Thanksgiving using a Karo syrup recipe. It turns out great every time I make it.

I loved it, made it with chopped walnuts instead of pecans, used jumbo eggs, and heaped the tablespoon of flour.  Turned out great.  I like that it is not sticky and too sweet.  A new favorite!  I also covered the edges of the crust with foil for the last 15 minutes of baking time.

This has been my holiday go to pecan pie for a couple years now.  Without a doubt this is the best pecan pie and everyone raves about it.   No more corn syrup draining the flavor out of the pecans.

I made the recipe as is, but I only slightly beat the eggs and sugar, by no means did I get it foamy. I also didn't measure the vanilla so I may have put more. This pie is perfect if you like a denser pecan pie like I do. I covered the crust and left it covered until 10 minutes left. It was a nice golden color and crispy on the bottom (I use pans with holes in them to help the bottom cook better.) The filling puffed up while baking and I got one crack as it cooled but I don't care. The pie could have been filled a little more, but with how sweet it was, it was fine and it reminded me of my grandmother's thin pies. My husband will be asking for this one again for sure.

Absolutely the best pecan pie I have ever had. I usually can't eat pecan pie because it's so darn sickening sweet. I made this for a friend who requested it as a barter! I've made it several times since then.

I've made this, and really, it's my go-to recipe for nut pies of any kind, as my family avoids corn syrup. (Sub in walnuts or hazelnuts sometime- they're just as good, just different!) The only change I've ever made to it is to add MORE nuts, and to bake a little longer. Much, MUCH tastier than the supposedly "traditional" recipes perpetuated by the corn syrup industry- after all, a LOT of our grand & great-grandmothers DIDN'T use the stuff! ;)

My husbands birthday is around Thanksgiving and this brown sugar pecan pie recipe has become his - and our family - favorite. I always make two - one for the hubs and one for everyone else! I use the pastry dough from Trader Joe's and it turns out great. (I also use it for pumpkin pie.) Before placing the pie in the oven I create a "halo" from aluminum foil and place that around the pie pan and loosely over the top of the crust to prevent the crust from getting burnt/dry during pies with a longer baking time, a trick I learned from my mom. We also like this pie reheated with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yum!

I put in more nuts into mix.  I also decorated with nuts all around the top.  Also my oven gets too hot so did as another person suggested cooked at 300 for about 50 min instead.  Everyone wants the recipe!   Not sickly sweet, so was perfect with some ice cream or real cream on the side.

I reduced the brown sugar to 3/4 cup dark brown sugar and also the butter to 1/4 c.  and added 1/2 cup chocolate chips. Yes it was a hit and I will make my version again.

The taste was fantastic but the contents were quite runny. Needed to bake extra long to stiffen up the inside.

I made this pie originally during the holidays and it is one of the best pecan pies I have ever had. I love that it is made from actual sugar as all the recipes that I looked at called  for syrup.

So glad to find a recipe without corn syrup in it.  I never could figure out why that stuff even exists.  This pie comes out great ever time and isn't sickly sweet.  Last time I made it, I threw some mini chocolate chips in the bottom before pouring the filling in.  Extra tasty!

Use 2 pie crusts, and 3 cups of pecans, and you get two very nutty pies with half of the custard and/or sweet stuff.

I follow the recipie to the letter and it turns out perfect everytime.  With chopped pecans and ready made pie crusts, it is also super easy and fast to make.  I always double it and make two pies.  Thank you to the OP for posting this!

Best pecan pie ever. Not gooey, more like the consistency of a soft cookie. I've made it with and without semi-sweet chocolate, it's amazing either way.

Changes made:
•Doubled amoubt of pecans
• Added chocolate chips
• Reduced temp to 325 for 50 minutes-turned pies at 25 min for even browning
It came out ok. As others have mentioned the top is very different from a traditional pecan pie recipe. It has a puffy/toasted souffle look (due to the foamy egg I'm gussing) 
Is pretty liquidy until sets at least 12 hours. I think next time I will leave out the white sugar as others mentioned and add a tiny bit more flour. 
It was good according to my boyfriend (I don't like pie so I didn't try it) but he didn't do any backflips over it.

Great easy recipe to follow!! I also changed the cooking times, so what I did was put it at 350* for 15 min and then 300* for 50 min. I know that some areas depending where you live; whether you have gas or electric; cooking times may vary......so I live in Toronto Ontario and I have an electric oven, those times worked for me!

Amazing recipe, and I'm more of a berry pie girl. Used fresh organic pecans from my dad's tree. Cracking them ourselves was half the fun, but will probably use store bought in a pinch. I added about 1/3 teaspoon of cinnamon, and it was perfect. I cooked for 30 minutes on 300, then another 15 on 350. Once it starts to crack, you know it's ready. I'll be doubling the recipe next time because I prefer no gap between crust and pie, but the taste is still unreal!!

I love that this recipe doesn't use corn syrup. I usually double the pecans because I like my pie to have plenty of nuts. Also, I learned not to over-mix the ingredients in my electric mixer and usually stick with a lower setting when mixing now.

I absolutely love this recipe. I follow it to the exact the only thing I add is almond extract. I have been using this recipe for at least four years now. Thank you for sharing.

Very nice pie.  I thought I was being clever by putting more pecans in it but that made it a bit dry.  Next time and there will be a next time, I'll only put a cup in as the recipe suggests.

This was the first pie I've ever made and it turned out to be delicious.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I thought it was slightly too sweet; just my personal preference. 

I did take the advice of other commenters and baked the pie at 350 F for 10 minutes and then at 300 F for 50 minutes.

I have made this pie multiple times over the years since first discovering this recipe in 2011. I always follow it as written and it comes out perfect every time. It's the only pecan pie recipe I use now.

I did not like this compared to the karo syrup version.  The texture was off and it just did not taste the same.  But the pecans alone tasted great.  Like sugar coated pecans.

Despite what other people have experienced, this pie came out aces for me. I used walnuts instead of pecans, and used almost 2 cups of nuts rather than 1 cup, and I could not be happier with the result. To avoid a burned crust, I rolled the edge down a bit, and the filling rose to exactly the height of the edge. Great recipe!!

I've made this recipe twice thus far with positive results.  The first time I made this pie, I followed the recipe to a "T" and, as some suggested, added semi-sweet chocolate morsels.  The pie is amazing with and without the chocolate!!  No one missed the corn syrup at all.  The pie has a good balance of sweetness and nuttiness.  Over the years, pecan pie has not been one of my favorite holiday desserts because most pecan pies I've tried are sweeter than I can handle.  I tried my hand at this pie as it is one of my husband's favorite desserts. He and I both loved it! 

The second time I made this recipe, I followed the advice of reviewer BUSIESTMOMOF2 and used refrigerated pie crust to make 24 mini pies.  The filling fits 24 cupcake sized pies nearly perfectly!  Using her suggestion of baking the pies for 25 min at 350 is spot on.  With the exception of the added work that cutting the pie crust and fitting it into the cupcake pan, I much prefer this method.  The little pies doesn't require a reduction in temperature at different times--just pop them in and let them go!  With the little pies, they're perfectly bite sized--no need for utensils!  This is a keeper for sure!

I wanted to like this recipe.  My pie came out AWFUL.  I'm a decent baker.  I followed the directions... It did not taste good and turned into a big hard lump.  

I noticed a lot of other reviewers have some helpful suggestions to tweak this recipe- and while I'm sure what they suggest fixes the issues- I have to base my opinion on the recipe as it is, because that's how I made it.   For me, it just did not work out.

This is the best and easiest pecan pie recipes ever. I made pecan pies  and pumpkin pecan pies and this is the best recipe for a pecan pie. Even my nephew who's number one pie is pecan loved this recipe. Never had a problem with it, have made it into different kitchens, two different climates and with a homemade and non homemade pie crust.  Just try it and you'll never go back to corn syrup recipes again.

I'd been eyeing this recipe for a while.  Finally made it tonight and it was fantastic!  

To 'Southern' it up a bit, I added a shot of bourbon to the mix.  Some of the  reviews said that it got too brown on top or cooked too much, so when I reduced the heat, I put it down to 325 for 40 minutes.  

Will definitely make this again.

You have to double the batch for  8-9 inch pie.  Lower the cooking level to 300 as suggested and it turns out perfect.  I used whipping cream rather than milk.....yummo

I really loved finding a pecan pie recipe without corn syrup. I pretty much made it as it is stated except I put some whole pecans on the top of the filling before baking. I also started the pie at 425 degrees and turned it down to 325 after 15 minutes. Everyone here loved it. The texture is a little different than classic pecan pie, but it still was delicious and that is what matters.

I loved this recipe. I helped my husband's grandmother make it, because she wasn't feeling well. We made two pies, and while putting them in the oven she asked, "Do they go on the top rack or bottom?" The recipe never mentioned what rack. I put them on the top rack, and the pie crust browned almost too much. If you decide to still cook them on the top rack, maybe cover your crust (crust only!) with aluminum foil for half of the cooking time.

This recipe was excellent.  I made it for the family for Thanksgiving and - based on that resounding approval - made it for friends a couple of days later.  Big.  Success.  And I'm not a pie maker, this was my first voyage.
I did make a crust (what the heck?), which turned out okay but I'm pretty sure it isn't worth the cleaning of the food processor and I'll just buy a good one (TJ's is supposed to have one) next time.
Only tweaks I made based on reading the reviews was the addition of more pecans (my mom is from the South) and dropping the oven temp.
This one is a keeper.

This was the first pecan pie I've ever made, I don't really like them or know anything about them. I'm not sure where my mistake was made but my version looked nothing like the picture on here, it looked disgusting. Everyone said it was delicious and it had disappeared within a couple hours so YAY!!

Very good.  1.5x filling for deep crust.  Bake at 350 for 15 min, then turn down to 300 for 40 min to avoid burnt crust.

I followed the recipe closely, and it was amazing. I took it to a large family Thanksgiving, and it was gone faster than the pumpkin pie. I love that there's no corn syrup involved. My one area for improvement is bake time/temperature. I tried to reduce the temp and increase bake time to save the crust from burning, but I ended up having to take it for about an hour and a half at about 320. I'll have to play with the time/temp a little more to perfect it, but this recipe is a keeper.

The flavor of the pie is spot on, however I did change a few things.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of pecans on top and a few more in the filling.  The pie is a tad on the ugly side with out them but tastes great either way.  I've made this pie multiple times and the baking temps listed on the original recipe are way too high, if you bake it according to the recipe it will burn.  I bake it at 400 for 10 minutes then 300 for 40 minutes.

I only made this because I was out of Karo and. Live in the boonies. Filling doesn't come near to filling crust and crust almost burned. I have hesitated for several days making as ingredients are precious especially pecans! Just a little bummed! Just not the excellent pecan pie recipe on Karo syrup!  No way can you beat it!

I'm giving this four instead of five because I did make some changes but after the changes were made, this pie was PERFECT and I will never use another recipe. I did as previously suggested and I doubled the filling portion and then topped the filling with extra pecans after it had been poured into the pie crust to reduce the  fluffy crust effect. I also dropped the temp to 300 and baked it for 45 minutes. I have had so many people ask me for the recipe I think I could make it from memory now.

I have made this pie.  First time I took chef's suggestion and added chocolate chips. I prefer it the regular way.  However - because it is a very sweet pie, I decided to substutute whiskey for the milk and really liked the outcome.  It cuts the sweetness just a tad.  I know that my grandmother's secret ingredient for pecan pie was a bit of strong coffee which might be a non alcoholic way to cut the sweetness a bit.  I will stick to the whiskey!  Bottom line is this is a great pie and very quick and easy to make.  My family likes and requests it now.

This is a fantastic classic recipe to keep in rotation! 
I did make a few adjustments over the past few times I have made it, based on other reviews.
I changed the serving size on the recipe to 10 which increased the volume of the filling. I also decrease temperatures.
I cooked the pie at 375 for 10 mins, took the pie out of the oven and preheated oven to 300, the placed the pie back in the oven for 45 mins. 
I then turned off the oven and cracked open the door a bit. I let the pie sit and completely cool in the oven. 
Perfect pie!

I'm making this pecan pie every year and I always get great feedback from people about its flavor. This year I replaced regular milk with the evaporated one and the consistency of the pie was a little thicker which I really liked. I think from now on  I'll stick to this change.

This recipe is a keeper! It turned out picture perfect and it sooo good...no more corn syrup for me!  I cut the brown sugar to 3/4 cup (still plenty sweet), added the hot melted butter to the sugars and whisked well to prevent a grainy texture, then added the eggs but did not try to make them foamy (I had no souffle top) and even let it sit for a few minutes to let the few bubbles settle before adding the other ingredients (added an additional 1/2 tsp vanilla and whisked them in lightly and let the mixture sit and settle a few more minutes before baking).  Also, taking the advice of others, I baked at 350 for 15 minutes then lowering the temp to 300 for the remaining time which ended up only being an additional 40 minutes (per the suggestions, the additional time was to be 50 to 55 minutes but mine was already firm after 35 but let it bake another 5 minutes just in case but next time, I won't; I did mention using less brown sugar so perhaps that's why I needed less time).

Husband-catching pecan pie (I have renamed it.)  This recipe does not use corn syrup which is the one thing I dislike about traditional pecan pies.   I add 2 tsp of cinnamon.   It's candied, nutty, sweet, and perfectly delicious.   Everyone RAVES about it at the holidays!!

I made it with dark brown sugar because it was what I had. It turned out just fine! 
I really like how fluffy and less sweet the filling turned out.

I've made this pie for the past 3 Thanksgivings.  My husband's favorite part of Thanksgiving, hands down!  The taste is great, and it is gooey.   I need to try making my own crust (thicker than premade) and maybe that would solve my issue.  It doesn't always fill to the top (however it did this year when I doubled my filling to make 2 pies).   And my crust always gets dark even with covering the crust with foil.  Doesn't make a difference with the taste though. Great pie!

I usually find pecan pie too heavy or glutenous, without the corn syrup this one is lighter and sweet, delightful hot from the oven with a little whipped cream.

I've made this pie for a few years now, and aside from adjusting the temperature (as so many suggested), this is my go-to pecan pie recipe! And not using high fructose corn syrup makes me feel better about indulging in this scrumptious pie!

I made this for the first time last Thanksgiving and  asked that everyone vote on their favorite pie.  This one won by a landslide, even over a pecan pie made with Karo.  I love the fact that I can make a healthier pie without the added sugar and without corn syrup.  The request for pecan pie for this Thanksgiving are already rolling in so I'm planning on making about 3 of these next week.  Thanks for the recipe!

Easy and delicious. I wanted to try this version because, as many people have mentioned, there is no corn syrup being used. Mom,  boyfriend,  and I loved it. I changed the temperature as many of the reviews suggested to do so.  Baked it at 300° F for about 60 minutes. Added 2 cups of pecans instead of 1. One thing I did that is not in the instructions is that I roasted the pecans before adding them to the mix,  I feel it gives more of a nuttier taste. Thanks for the recipe,  it's a keeper. I love this site and all the people that share all the awesome recipes/tips.

It's great!  I read a number of reviews first, and tweaked the recipe using the recommendations from others.  Dropping the temperature to 300 degrees (instead of 350) worked perfectly.  40 minutes (IMO) is too long - 30 is the magic number.

Instead of using pecans, I candied some walnuts and used those - amazing!

I love this Pecan Pie easiest one to make and not  caramelized like the one that you add syrup to.I will be making these again and again .I made 2 of these pies preheated the oven to 350 baked for 10 minutes then lowered the heat   to 300 and baked for another 30 minutes  they were delicious the first one I omitted the white sugar and added 1 cup of dark brown sugar I added 2 tsp of flour and a quarter tsp baking powder I added the 1 cup whole pecans  it was good the 2nd one I omitted the white sugar  added 1 cup dark brown sugar and added the 1 cup whole pecans it turned out perfect  I read some people said that it didn;t  fill the pie up to the top I purchased the no name deep dish pie shells and it filled them up  they are not as deep as some of the other deep dish pie shells

I make this all the time for the holidays and any special event. I live in France and my French husband and in-laws love it! I picked it because there isn't any Karo syrup, which is hard to come by and if I find it is really expensive.  Plus it tastes so much better!

i absolutely looove this pie! it's my go to pecan pie every time i want a pecan pie. i love how it's almost like a caramel custard pie with the bonus of pecans! :) i will say this pie is great despite faux pas' on crust choice.  :) i don't always have time to make a crust from scratch so i always choose a top tier crust and not any old store bought crust. but what else can i say? this is just like THE best pecan pie EVER! :) thank you to the op for posting it! bon appétit!

I love this recipe! I would definitely add more pecans, but then again, I LOVE pecans. Great that this recipe isn't as sweet as the store bought stuff.  I pair this with this crust (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/15995/ruths-grandmas-pie-crust) cuz it's amazing and the combination of the two is  dangerous... to my waist. ;P The 50 mins is a long time to bake it (it only took about 25ish for me)  but it may depend on your oven so make sure you keep tabs to not overdo it. Ohhh lord, this is gooood!

This recipe turns out beautifully. I've made it several times and my family and friends love it. The only change I do is that I prefer to bake the pie in a graham cracker crust.

This is the easiest to make and the most delicious. Everyone asks for the recipe! And the sauce by itself is divine, great over I've cream or drizzled over fruit. I like to bake pecan pies and (see photo) pecan pie bites that you can just pop into your mouth. Delicious!!!

I have made this two Thanksgivings in a row, and this year my 21 year old wants this instead of a Birthday cake.  I do about double the pecans, reduce the temp like AJ and Chef Dawn suggested and that does help.  I'd like to mention that this does foam up (for those who haven't done a lot of pecan pies, like me).  This isn't a bug, it is a feature, so don't sweat the decorative pecans on the top too much, because they'll largely be hidden by the foam. ; )

followed the recipe exactly as a called. came out delicious except there was no gooiness, and all pecans. The only thing I changed was the cooking temperature and amount of time, and that was from the reviews.it came out delicious and if you lIke Pecans, you'll have nothing to complain about. I'll definitely try again with a little more flour, and I will have to work on the temperature and timing in my oven.  give it 3 stars only because I definitely need to work on the cooking phase.

Following others' suggestions, omitted the white sugar and used a few pecan halves on top for appearance.  I didn't have a crust and wanted to save the calories anyway, so made this in a glass pie plate without crust.  At 350 for 10 min and 325 for 30 min it came out perfect.  Southern hubby who has grown up on pecan pie said to make it this way, without crust, from now on!

Great holiday pie. I made one with light brown sugar and one with dark. The dark makes a better looking pie. I did cut back on both sugars by 25%. Delicious! A definite keeper.

Was looking for a new pecan pie recipe and based on previous reviews gave this one a shot.  It is now and will forever be my GO TO pecan pie recipe!  We followed the directions exactly.  I did put a sheet of tinfoil I sprayed on top of the pie for the last 10 minutes of cooking.  The best part was the RAVE reviews as people were eating.  You can tell something is different, but you can't put your finger on it.  It's very moist, not sticky (in that caro way.  Truly a keeper - and I highly recommend you testing it out!

Excellant pie, original recipe not enough filling for my 9 1/2 deep Le Crueset pie pan. Doing 1.5 times to fill pan. Adding 2-3 tbl Jack Daniels & some crisp applewood chopped bacon to one to copy a pie

This is an amazing pecan pie.  Not overpoweringly sweet, rich, creamy, raves from everyone even those who don't customarily like pecan pie.  Made two for Thanksgiving and three more since then, very consistent and easy recipe.

Yes yes yes! My favorite pecan pie ever! Not too sweet, not gelatinous, just yummy and perfect. I am deleting other pecan pie recipies from my recipe box now. Ok, now for the only con.... It is a bit crumbly when you try to cut out a piece. If you try really hard you may be able keep a piece together.....but the taste honestly still gives this one 5 stars.

I LOVE this pie! And it is oh-so easy! I don't like making changes to recipes but I add about 1/2 a tsp of chuncky salt and the other I made I think is more for appearance. I beat an egg white and about 3 Tbsp of sugar until white and fluffy and then added (folded in ) about 3/4cup whole pecans and arranged them on top so the top ended up looking flaky instead of cakey. But ohhhh man I love this recipe! People would NOT stop raving about this pie. Seriously. Four different people told me it was the best pecan pie they have ever had. So thanks!

I added a dash of Bourbon and this pie was fantastic. My new favorite recipe. Now, if I can only figure a way to make it dairy free...

The pie does not get syrupy once cut, as usually happens with a corn syrup pie. One of the people who ate it at Thanksgiving thought it had chocolate in it, too. So good!

I've never been a fan of pecan pies even though I love pecans.  The filling has always been a turn off for me. However, since it's one of my husband's favorites, I tried this recipe and we both loved it!  I added more pecans than called for to decorate the top after pouring the filling into the crust but otherwise didn't make any changes.

Pecan pie is my husband's favorite and I am always looking for a slightly healthier version since it is always so sweet. I liked the idea of no corn syrup and I used the only flour I had on hand for the crust which was a white whole wheat flour. Other than the crust, I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Most of us thought it tasted great but definitely not as sweet as a typical pecan pie. My husband missed the super sweetness so I will try adding a little more brown sugar for added richness.  Still a keeper!

I really disliked pecan pie before I happened upon this recipe.

Mostly pecan pie brought shivers just thinking about the overly sweet dessert that was usually too high in corn syrup and too low in pecans.

I decided to make it for my other family members who happen to enjoy the rush inducing slice of sugary goodness.

Enter this recipe.  Right off the bat I was happy to see the lack of corn syrup.  It's a super simple, straight-forward recipe that relies heavily on technique.

I've made this pie four times all with varying levels of success.  I have baked it too long at 400 and in a panic reduced it to 300 and baked it low and slow covered with foil. That pie was so delicious, chock full of nuts but a little dry.  Add ice cream.

My second and third attempts I used an off brand brown sugar and followed baking temps and times and covered with pie pans after the temp drop.  This resulted in a custardy creamy layer and nice layer of nuts.

My latest attempt I followed all directions precisely omitting the foil and pie pan cover which when taken out had the deceptive crystallized goodness that is the top crust only to yield soup when cut.  We baked it longer.  10 more minutes...until I felt like I couldn't risk the quality of the nuts.  It firmed a bit but still looked quite runny.

However, after letting it sit overnight it firmed up a bit more and is now only slightly caramely, lending nice moisture and texture.  This is my favorite so far.

Amazing recipe turned out great!  My whole family loved it!  I only wish I had bought more pecans for the recipe.   I bought exactly what was needed for the recipe and would've liked more.  Next time I will use 1 1/4 cup per pie.

My mom loves pecan pie. I made this just for her even though she's the only one in the family who likes pecan pie. I made it at Thanksgiving. She was so excited. I was just hoping it would turn out. I read the reviews and lowered the temperature as most said. My mother tried it and finished her piece, but when asked, she finally admitted the recipe was not a good one. She said that she definitely preferred the recipes with the Kyro Syrup. I will not be making this again.

I have made this pie multiple times. It's delicious and has no syrup. The top of the pie comes out fluffy but I think when you over whip it that is what cause the souffle type top. I made this as the recipe stated and changed nothing. It was delicious warm. Yum!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and boy was I disappointed! This pie was insanely sweet considering it doesn't use corn syrup. I couldn't get myself to finishing my slice because of how sugary it tasted. My cousin and aunt agreed on how it tasted, BUT my sister-in-law loved it!! I also gave a big slice to my friend the day after and she said one of her friends are willing to pay me to bake her another one! I've definitely made better pecan pies before, so I would give this 2 stars, but because I got some positive feedback, I'm willing to give it 3 stars.

I did change this up some.  Reduced the temp to 325 after 10 minutes.  I also used 3/4 cup brown sugar and replaced the last quarter with pure maple syrup. It was delicious though!  Cooked until center was no longer jiggly

Amazing!!! Followed recipe exactly except for reducing temp as top commenters have suggested. I used a 9" deep dish Marie Callender's crust. It was delicious and I will make it again. Perfect with vanilla ice cream!

Love this pie.  Followed the recommendation of other reviewers and after the initial 400 degrees, reduced heat to 300 instead of 350 then baked for 45 minutes (it will start to crack on top).  Will make again.

Holy moly! I will never make a corn syrup pecan pie EVER again. Where has this recipe been all my life? Super easy and quick to throw together and the results were a perfectly amazing pecan pie. Threw butterscotch chips on top of the crust before pouring the batter, at my husband's request, and that worked perfectly.  Seriously,  this is the best pecan pie recipe ever. When using the normal corn syrup way, I always have issues with it setting up and it is always way sweet, like candy. But this came out beautiful.  Made it's own nice crusty top and the inside set up wonderfully, and the sweetness was perfect. Like a pie and not like candy. You MUST try this.

This is the first pie I have ever made!  It was so easy, I figured even I couldn't mess up!  I thought it was too sweet even tho I left the white sugar out.  I used a frozen (thawed) pre-made crust and I baked it at 350 for 10 minutes and then 300 for 40 minutes and I thought it was too dry but everyone loved it!  Thank you for a recipe that was simple enough for a 71 year old who has always been afraid to bake!!

No question. This is the best pecan pie in the world.  Even folks who thought they didn't like pecan pie were in love with this recipe.  It wasn't gooey and sickening sweet.  Not using Karo syrup was the secret.  This was like a New Orleans praline in a pie crust. Simply delicious.  Easy to make and our new favorite holiday pie.  I may just make it when it isn't a holiday!!

Pecan pie was easy to make and very delicious! One way to check pecan pie is ready is by jiggling pie and it should wiggle only a little in the center. Pie needs more time if it is  still liquidy

Made it twice.  Both times it was excellent. The first time the top had a crunchy sugary crust, but not the second time. The only differnce was the eggs were a bit older.  I also used two cups of pecans.  My father is a foodie from New York and he is very hard to please and he LOVED it!

I made this exactly as written except added half pecans placed on top.  The sugars crystalized and the texture was gritty and just as sweet as my old syrup recipe.

This tastes soooo good! And it was so easy, I didn't even mind the ugliness of it. It really didn't turn out pretty for me. The top puffed up a little and became like a candy shell, so when it sits out and when you slice it, it crumbles terribly. Otherwise, it tastes amazing. Not too chewy like some pecan pies can be. Great!

Note: I did change baking time and temps. I baked for 350 degrees for 10 minutes, then for 50 minutes at 300 degrees.

Just made this today for thanksgiving. I doubled the recipe to make 2 pies and left out the white sugar. I also listened to other reviews and baked 15 min at 350 then about an hour at 300.. It was SOOO good! Not too sweet like most pecan pies. I also used extra pecans and made a pretty topping. I highly recommend.

I was meeting my Boyfriends family for the first time on Thanksgiving and forgot that I had told him I would make a Pecan Pie for dessert.  I also forgot my recipe and was out of state. I found this one and feel in love. So easy and quick plus it is the best Pecan Pie I have ever had. Not to mention it was a big hit I was asked to make three more before I went home that weekend.

I decided to try this recipe this year and I was greatly disappointed. I love sweets, but this was overly sweet. Next time I'll follow the recipe on the Karo bottle. Why I decided to mess with something that wasn't broke, I have no clue.

First, this is not your regular pecan pie but that's what makes it good. I'm not a huge fan of pecan pie but my husband is. He absolutely loved it!  
Second, my suggestion to those trying the recipe for the first time:  bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes and then 300 degrees for 55-60 minutes. This pie needs to set after baking,  so I suggest making it the night before and refrigerate overnight.  It's better the next day. 
It doesn't look like your traditional pecan pie but then again, it's not!  
I did use 1 1/2 cups of pecan pieces and I added 2 Tblspn of pancake syrup, for flavor.  
I would,  and will,  make this recipe again!  Thank you for sharing it with us!

The one cup chopped pecans are good within the pie filling, but they get mushy. Add another cup pecans to the top of the pie for aesthetics and crunch, as these will toast nicely in the oven:). Also, you can use 3/4 cup of brown sugar and a little less than 1/4 cup of the white sugar and it will still taste great, just less sweet. Happy eating :D.

So happy with the results! It turned out perfect. I did change the cooking time/temperature after reading other reviews and very happy I did. I baked it for 15 minutes at 400 and then reduced it to 300 for an additional 50-60 minutes.

Great recipe! I followed the recommendation of previous reviews by decorating the top of the pie with more pecans then baked at 400 for 10 minutes before reducing the temp to 300 for an additional 55 min. Turned out great! Thanks :)

I decided to try this recipe. When it came out of the oven I wasn't sure I had made the correct decision - and, to top it off, I was bringing it to an event! It looked different, too! Yikes! I showed it to a friend who was looking forward to eating it and he was pretty suspicious as well. We both hesitantly tasted it and both gave it 2 enthusiastic thumbs up! I would definitely make this again!

Easy to follow directions. Seriously, don't change a thing.  This is the most decadent pie I've ever had. Used Ruth's grandma's  pie crust recipe.

I doubled the recipe and baked two pies to take out of town for Thanksgiving. Since I haven't tasted them yet, I can't attest to the flavor, but they look foamy and weird and I'm not sure if they will make the cut. I'll try to sprinkle them with powdered sugar and see if that makes things better. I followed other's instructions about putting them in the oven at 300 degrees for 45 min. Sadly, I spent time arranging pecans on top as you can see in the picture, but the foaminess engulfed them. I just hope they taste better than they look!
Later...Okay, they taste great! Maybe beauty isn't everything.

I made this when I lost my old recipe. I now have a new amazing recipe. I added just a touch of corn syrup because all of my other recipes have had corn syrup. It came out on point and addicting!

This is amazing! Absolutely better than the corn syrup versions! I used the advice of 350 degrees 10 minutes and 300 for 50 minutes. It wasn't the most beautiful pie but it tastes amazing!!

I followed this recipe to the T. Baked at 400 for 35 mins. When I cut into it the center of the pie was not set. Was very disappointed.  The taste was good. I think I'll stick to my Kero recipe.

I do NOT like traditional pecan pie. I pick the pecans off the top and eat them, but leave the rest. When a family member requested it, I looked for a recipe highly-rated. This one was not only good that night, but I think better the next morning. I'm making it again today. (P.S. I used dark brown sugar)

This recipe is delicious. I just made it for a trial run for Thanksgiving. I didn't want to make a whole pie because there will be a lot of kids at our family gathering, therefore I wanted to make a bite size version. I followed the recipe (adding chocolate chips) and baked in phyllo cups at 350 for 18 min. They set perfectly and were delicious. My husband like the ones loaded with pecans, so next time I will add more pecans!

This pie is awesome! I followed the revisions that were suggested in the reviews. The butter wasn't too hot, I baked for 10 minutes at 350 degrees, took it out of the oven and added pecan halves to the top and then baked for 50 minutes at 300 degrees. I also made sure I used a 9 inch pie pan that wasn't too deep. I did forget to add the tablespoon of flour but the texture of the pie was great. This is a great recipe that I will use again.

This pie is out of this world.  I had never made pecan pie before as I was always turned off by the corn syrup.  Well, pecans were on sale at Costco when I went last week and my the mini pie plates I ordered came in yesterday, so my mini pecan pies were fortuitous. I used the recipe for Butter Flaky Pie Crust from this site and followed the recipe as indicated in the video. Since I was making mini pies, I thought I'd have to cook them less, but 10 minutes @ 400, and 20 minutes at 350 seemed pretty perfect. I will be enjoying this recipe and sharing it with others!!! Thank you!

This pie is so delish! it is by far the best pecan pie I've had. I've made it twice already the first time came out great but a little too sweet for MY taste so I made a few changes the second time just to see if it made a difference. I added half the amount of white sugar, I added half a cup extra pecans and cook it at 350 from start to finish for about an hour, came out even better (again for MY taste) This truly is a great, easy to follow recipe that will please anyone and everyone.

Okay, so like many others I was skeptical of this recipe.  I made it anyway and pulled it out of the oven.  We all looked at it and let it sit over night.  Still it didn't look like a pecan pie so nobody tried it.  Then I finally dug in well after dinner!  OH MY WOW!  This is the best pecan pie ever!!!  Seriously!  Everyone loved it after I told them how good it was.  I was one who mixed everything with a mixer and I got a frothy looking top but honestly it tastes like nutty caramel.  I think it could be avoided by not using a mixer at all.  IDK.  This is just so gosh darn good.  I can't even explain it because it's not sickeningly sweet, but it's still a pecan pie!  You've got to try it at least once before shying away from this recipe.

Ok, i tried another recipe for the pecan pie and i felt disappointed and tell to myself not to make one again. But my son really loves pecan pie so when he told me he wants a pecan pie i think why not to give it a try again. So i looked up for recipes and founded this one! I have to tell that it's not only a very easy pie to bake but it's delicious!!! I follow the tip of putting more pecans on top so it looks pretty and it came out great!!! good looking and delicious pie!!! This is a keeper!!!! thank you!!! :)

Best pecan pie I've ever made. I cut the sugar in half and the end result was perfect without being overly sweet. My pie shell was a bit larger than expected so I just doubled the filling and kept on trucking. I will definitely be making this pie again very soon!

This is a great recipe!  It was very easy to make.  My only concern was that I didn't know when it was done.  I baked it at 400 for ten minutes then lowered it to 300 for 45 minutes more.  It is perfect!  Mine is actually a little syrupy in the middle which is what I was hoping for.  I personally think  it tasted better the second day after being in the fridge overnight. I will definitely make this again!

I love this recipe. I've tried the corn syrup one, and this is better. My mother loves pecan pie, and I will surprise her tomorrow with this dessert. I tested the recipe out yesterday, and my husband and I almost ate the whole pie. Try it. You may never go back to using the corn syrup recipe.

This is a good recipe, but I did two things: added more pecans [as another person suggests] and also added about 1 cup of cranberries, cut in half. Cranberries balance the sweetness with some tartness, and I prefer that to too much sweet.

This pie turned out incredible. I tried a different pecan pie the other day, and it was just okay, but this one is going in my recipe box. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer, and cooked the pie at 350 for about 10 minutes, then cooked it at 300 for 45 minutes. I covered the pie edges with tin-foil, and took it off the last 15 minutes of bake time. It came out perfect. The top of the pie had a delicious caramelized texture. My husband even said it was better than his mom's who bakes pecan pies all the time.  I used a frozen pie shell, just the cheap one at wal-mart. This pie was gone in minutes after it was cooled. Best pie ever!!!!

AMAZING!! The best pecan pie I've ever had and everyone who ate it said the same. It was sooo easy to make. Only thing I notice is that it's not a thick pie, almost seemed like it could be doubled or at least add another half of the batch to the pie shell. It only filled half way. It's a great recipe and the top is nice and crunchy like a candy topping

Best pecan pie I've ever had!  I never liked the sickening sweetness of corn syrup in pecan pies, so this recipe takes care of that and the pecans are the star of the show-as they should be!

For 29 years I thought pecan pie was disgusting. A friend made this me and I make it all the time now. It's especially good with a pie crust that has a little extra salt.

Seriously the easiest pie ever! I am not a cook by any means, but my husband loves pecan pie and during the Holidays the stores were sold out. I found this recipe and looked at the video and it seemed almost too easy. I added more nuts and chocolate chip, and wow! Absolutely delicious. My husband loved it! I am adding more chocolate chips this time. I will never buy a store made pecan pie again! When I am invited to dinner parties I will make this pie! Cool whip sets it off nicely as well as vanilla ice cream- yum!!!

Amazing easy to make recipe. Made this twice and was asked for the recipe both times. I made double the original recipe since my pan is bigger than what the recipe was meant for. Came out perfect!

It was my first attempt at pecan pie and it was wonderful! Remember to toast the pecans it really sets off the nutty aroma and gives it the crunchy texture. I also added additional honey glazed nut toppings for additional flavors and texture towards the end of baking. Would definitely make again and again in the future!

I followed some of the suggestions like first 10 min at 350 then 45 at 300 and it was done, chilled it on the counter 30 mins and in the fridge 30 mins just to make sure it was set. This was my first attempt at a pecan pie so I was playing the guessing game while worrying it would fall apart after trying to slice it so soon after it was done. I also added 1/2 cup extra pecans and reduced the sugar by some. I also reduced the butter by 1 1/2 tbs. This pie was not overly sweet, just right. Will try all brown sugar next time. Got rave reviews even from my ridiculously picky 4 yr old (seriously don't know how he survives sometimes). Will make this again just not too soon, this pie could be trouble cause of how delicious and simple it is to make.

This was fantastic...just right in my opinion...made it twice...each time topped with whole pecans, brushed with melted butter and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar...it is divine...love the no corn syrup and it is still wet enough...this disappeared both times I made it!

I usually find pecan pie too sweet.  But I had a lot of pecans and wanted to make a pie.  When I saw this recipe, without syrup, I decided to try it.  This pie is the BEST pie I have ever had; I am usually a chocolate or cream kind of person.
I did add 1/2 more cup of pecans and put half pieces on the top so it would look pretty. also I did not have milk, so I used half & half.  I did not have light brown sugar, so I used 3/4 cup dark brown and 1/2 cup white sugar. I had to shell more pecans in the middle of making the pie, so everything sat for a while, too.  I followed the recipe for the temps.  But covered the crust with foil b/c it seemed to be getting brown very soon.  I am not sure why, but the top formed a crust (beautiful, but hard to cut). 
I could not resist this pie and told my husband I would only make this pie to share b/c I do not want to get into the habit of eating a whole pie between just us. : ) 
I am still craving it 2 weeks later. The filling was rich but not as sweet as the syrup pecan pies.  This was truly a gourmet pie. Others who tasted it said it was the best pecan pie they ever had, too.  Will be making again to "share."

However, I made this lower fat and less sugar and I think it was even better this way! I decreased the white sugar to 3/4 cup and cut out 1/4 cup butter and replaced it with applesauce. It was fabulous and without that teeth-ringing sweetness that pecan pie often has - everyone loved it this way, better than the original!

Very very sweet and rich, but isn't that how pecan pie is supposed to taste? Yep. Lots of compliments, but everyone ate it slow and only had one slice each. Maybe pair it with something to mellow out the sweetness?

I made this for New Year's Day today. Is was so simple. My husband sais it was the best pie ever!!!  I added a 1/4 cup of chocolate chips, used unsalted butter and cooked at 300 as other reviewers lowered the temperature. Will make again!!  Better than buying in a bakery.

Let me start by saying I am not a baker but I love pecan pie.  I bravely decided to make pecan pie for the family Christmas Eve party and pulled this recipe from the internet.  Everyone at the party couldn't stop raving about it! It was easy even for me the non-chef/cook/baker.  My mother-in-law is a baker and has called me twice asking for the recipe!

Recipe is AWESOME.  It's the first pecan pie I've made that doesn't get runny at all.  It does get a bit of a crust on top that looks funny to the uninitiated, but don't be fooled!  I love love love this recipe and so does anyone who's tried it.

This was very good and I really liked it until I tried a different recipe which was amazing. The texture of this pie is too much like a mousse and not a traditional pecan pie, the filling also was not enough for a regular 9" pie crust.

Very yummy. My mother in law called me after Christmas and told me how good it was. The only change I made was to replace the white sugar with splenda.

After eating this, my husband said, "Make it this way, always." Says it's the best pecan pie he's tasted.  Pecan is his favorite, and he's eaten quite a few different recipes in his 51 years.

I took Chef Dawn's advice, baking the pie for 15 minutes at 350, then for an additional 50 at 300.   I also added additional whole pecans to the top. This pie turned out great.  Not too sweet, just very tasty.  I was worried about the dull film on the top, but it didn't affect the taste at all. Will definitely be making this recipe again.

Not sure if I did something wrong, but this turned out very dry for me. The flavor was good, and I actually preferred the texture over a traditional gooey pecan pie. I could eat it while holding the pie piece, rather than with a fork, so it was more like a bar. Followed the cooking advice of other reviewers: start at 350, reducing to 300. Worked out great.

This is a 5-star pie in terms of taste!  As others have said, it is not overwhelmingly sweet and I would attribute that to the lack of Karo.  In terms of baking times, I think others are correct.  I started at 350 for 10 minutes, then turned down to 300 for another 40-45 minutes and that was perfect.  Even with the lower temp I still had to use a crust shield to not end up with over-brown edges on the crust.  When I adjusted the temp I followed the suggestion to place pecan halves on the top of the pie in concentric circles.  Very good advice as it really added to the presentation.  This recipe is definitely one I'll go back to - everyone loved it!

BEST PIE EVER! For years, I used my ex-MIL's recipe, even though no one really liked it. This year, I wanted something different, and I loved the idea of not using corn syrup, since my husband's main complaint is that pecan pie is too sweet. Even though I made this without a crust (we're gluten free) and I used GF flour, it came out perfectly. This is so good heated and served with a blob of ice cream on top. I will never use any other recipe!

I made this pie DAIRY free by substituting vegetable oil for the butter and soy milk for the milk. I then added a sprinkle of pecans and dark chocolate chunks (dairy free) on the unbaked crust before pouring in the other ingredients.  I then read the reviews about cooking at a lower temp for a longer period of time. It was very delicious and will for sure make this again.

This was the first pecan pie I made. It turned out to be so GOOD! I read all the reviews and used the most useful: 1. use a DEEP 9 inch pie pan,
2. eggs should be room temp, 3. add one half cup more chopped TOASTED
pecans, plus one half pieces of pecans, not toasted, placed on top of pie before baking,4.longer baking time.

I decided to try this recipe because I was looking for something different from the sticky, icky, corn syrup recipe.  WOW!  This was perfect.  Sweet and light (compared to the corn syrup) and infinitely better.  The whole family liked it.  I definitely will use this recipe again.

This is my fourth year to make pecan pies with this recipe.  Oklahoma is a place you don't mess with traditional recipes, so I was hesitant at first because I feared my grandmother would never speak to me again for baking a pecan pie and not using her syrupy recipe.  The very first time I made it, she LOVED it!  My family doesn't even ask me if I'm making a pecan pie, they just request I bring two or more!  Great recipe!

This was awesome!  I made this using the crust recipe from All American Apple Pie by Amy (from this sight).  I only made the bottom crust.  I live in a Germany where American packed brown sugar is hard to come by so I used just brown sugar in regular sugar form ( hope that makes sense).  It still turned out great.  Much better than the pies that use syrup.

Excellent pecan pie!  Rave reviews from everyone that tried it, even those that do not normally like pecan pie.  I will adjust the quantity of filling next time so it fills the pie shell better(maybe change the serving size to 10?).  But absolutely delicious.

So yummy. Not super sweet like I thought it might be. Which is good because that is why I have never been a huge fan of pecan pie but my family loves it. It was really easy to do too which is a bonus as I am just getting into baking.

I made this pie for my mom for her birthday.  She is a big fan of pecan pie but typically still finds them a bit too sweet for her liking and usually doesn't even finish a piece.  This pie, however, had her coming back for more!  Even my dad, who is not typically a fan of pecan pie because they are so sweet, devoured this pie and I have been asked to make it again for Christmas!  Everyone who was able to get a piece (or even a bite) LOVED this pie!  Will definitely be added to my collection of "favorites!"

This pecan pie tasted really good once it came out and cooled, but it didn't solidify at ALL even after an hour. And after it hardened, it was like a rock :/ I think it calls for too much sugar. Again, tastes great, but next time I make it i will make some adjustments. Go lower on the sugar, and increase the baking time. Some other reviewers suggested putting it on the tray of the oven that gets less heat, I would too, the top browns very fast.

Ok, this is my first time making/eating pecan pie so I don't have much to compare this recipe with other pecan pie recipes, but I can tell you this: This pecan pie is DELICIOUS! The neighbors brought over a pecan pie and we had this one and everyone loved this recipe better. The pie tastes like buttery pecans!! So good!! And the recipe was super easy to make and baked great! This will be my pecan pie recipe from now on! No reason to try another pecan pie recipe!! As a side note: I used soy milk and it had no effect on the outcome of the pie. Still tasty and cooked perfectly!

(Better with margarine) The first time I made this pie, I was out of real butter so I used margarine instead. It turned out great with no other adjustments. The next time, I made it with real butter and the top became like soufflé as mentioned in some of the other reviews. Use margarine for best results.

Tried this recipe for Thanksgiving this year and it is a winner.  I have made many pecan pies using corn syrup and they haven't always turned out so well. I love this new recipe, it is easy and the pie turned out perfectly.

Everyone loved this. Not quite as sweet as one made with corn syrup, which was a plus. Set up nicely. The video on how to make it was helpful. Made two over the thanksgiving weekend. The second one I used a graham cracker crust, yum!  Getting rid of all my other pecan pie recipes, this one is a keeper!

I made this for Thanksgiving Day. I've never made a pecan pie because my mother-in-law was the expert at it and pecan pie is my husband's favorite. Since my mother-in-law passed away a few years back, I decided to finally attempt a pecan pie. I tried this one because it sounded different from the typical pecan pie, and I didn't want my husband to compare mine to "Mama's pie". With that said, this pie was delicious and my husband loved it! No comparing to "Mama's pie" - just another delicious dessert for our house!

This pie is absolutely fantastic! I made it for Thanksgiving and thought that I would give it a shot due to the great reviews, even though I have a pecan pie recipe that we all love. I am now a convert; this pie is delicious. It isn't dry, which was my fear since pecan pies with Karo are always plenty gooey. No worries! This pie isn't the exact same consistency, it's just a superior product, in my opinion. As far as I'm concerned, I can throw out my old recipe and use this one from now on! The only change I made was that I didn't use chopped pecans, choosing instead to use whole. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Made exactly as written.  The flavor was good, but it wasn't the consistency that I love when eating a pecan pie made with good ol' corn syrup.  This had almost a praline like top.  I baked it at 350 for 40 minutes.  The crust was golden, but the filling seemed to overdone/dry.  Don't get me wrong--still completely edible, just not the ooey-gooey goodness I like in a pecan pie.  If I make it again, I will either lower the final baking temperature or shorten the baking time.  Definitely needs to be eaten warm.

this was the best pecan pie I've ever tasted!  super easy to make, didn't change a thing from the original recipe.  love that it doesn't take corn syrup.  So good I ate like 3 pieces and felt so over-full, but it was worth it!

Agree with other reviewers, not overly sweet like the corn syrup version.  I used a homemade 9-inch pie crust and I didn't think there was quite enough filling.  I would increase the recipe by 1/2 (use the "change servings" button and increase servings from 8 to 12) and it would be perfect. Pecan pie always gets too browned in my oven so I bake for 30 minutes and loosely cover the entire pie with foil for the remaining baking time. My total baking time was about 55 minutes. Really good.

This tasted so much more like real food than those corn syrup recipes. I was concerned that real sugar would give this a grainy texture but it was super smooth. I added about 1/8 tsp salt to help bring out the flavors. As others recommended, after pouring the mix into the crust I put some pecans on top. Glad I did as they were the only ones visible once it was baked.

Best Pecan Pie Ever! My whole family liked it better than any others was worried because of some other reviews. I followed the advice of "Chef Dawn" and baked 350 for 15 minutes and then 300 for 50 minutes. I used chopped pecans and overfilled my cup a little. I let my eggs and melted butter come to room temp. When I did my crust I didn't cut any off. I used the 2 finger in a v and one pushing in the middle. I covered with a silicone pie crust cover and my crust was perfect! I also let it sit and cool down before I cut it. It was perfect. Not overly sweet and the pecans were so crunchy. Only way I will fix pecan pie from now on!

Just made for the first time and it is amazing!  I don't always love pecan pie because it can be too sweet.  This really has a great flavor.  The texture is nice and I don't know if maybe I over baked it a little but the top was almost a little crispy.  In a great way!  Kind of like my favorite brownies that are baked more on the surface a soft & gooey on the inside.  Thumbs up from my family on this one!

great alternative to corn-syrup-based pecan pie. my husband raved about it, and I don't generally think he's a huge pecan pie fan. I DID DOUBLE the filling recipe, though-- and that was needed for me to fill out a 9.5 inch pie pan.

This recipe worked great for me! I've never baked any kind of pie before (though I do bake a lot), but I know this turned out well because pecan pie is my boyfriend's favorite and he loved it! I didn't want to make a whole pie so I took a muffin tin and made 12 muffin size tarts. Shaped the pie dough to each tin and baked at 350 for 20 mins. I also added a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and took the advice of another to let the eggs come to room temperature and make sure not to heat the butter too hot. These were delicious and super easy to make.

Pecan pie is my favorite! I'm pregnant and was craving one terribly. I was skeptical about not making the classic Karo pecan pie. Like most of the reviews on here, it's really a good pecan pie. I'll make this again for the Holidays for my family. You won't be disappointed!

By far the best pecan pie ever.  I made it once for my boyfriend and he loved it. Now he asks me all the time for it.  Brought it in for the office and they all loved it.  It's not gooey and sticky at all and it is so scrumptious.  Very easy to make...even easier to eat!

Oh Mercy, this is the BEST Pecan pie I have ever made in my life. The only change I had to make was using Soy Milk as I was out of regular milk. High Altitude, no change. Did cook a little faster than I thought. This pie will make you famous even if you don't have good luck making pies! My husband is still drooling

I don't especially like Pecan Pie but someone at work mentioned it and it was his birthday.  I baked this as my first Pecan pie ever and I will make it forever and always.  It was a huge hit and I loved it too.

This is the best basic pie recipe, I've changed it up with several different nuts and let me tell you its never bad. Also turns out great with a third egg. I've been considering adding apple or something to the mix but have not yet been so daring. (Chocolate on top works well, too.)

Only thing I did was add some cinnamon for extra flavor. And I really like cinnamon. The pie was really good and not too sweet. Love that it does not contain corn syrup

I absolutely love how this recipe turned out. My only change is that I added a half of a cup of pecans in the mixture, and then added more to the top as well. I also recommend using homemade crust, because it made it to die for!

I really love the buttery flavor.  I can actually eat it because it isn't too sweet.  I make it all the time and it is a crowd pleaser.  Not so much a fan of the way it crusts st top.  Even if I top the pie with pecans instead of mixing them in, it still crusts up like that.  Not sure if it's a technical issue or if it's related to the ingredients.
**update**
I find that beating the eggs less reduces the crunchy top myself and other reviewers complain about.  Scramble the eggs lightly instead of beating them until foamy.  Also, reduce oven temp to 350 for ten mins and 300 for 40 mins.  I wait to put whole or halved pecans on top of pie until after the first ten mins so that the nuts stay on top.   These adjustments make a tremendous difference!  I also double the recipe and bake 4" pies, yielding 8 mini pies.  
For those who think this pie is too sweet:
There is a similar recipe in current Southern Living Cakes and Pies magazine (displayed until Aug 15).  It is called Utterly Deadly Southern Pecan Pie.  It has bourbon, lower sugar amounts, and different baking instructions.

It was good the only thing I regret was adding chocolate chips I think it made it too sweet.  Will try again minus the chocolate.

This was my first homemade pecan pie. I sought out a recipe that doesn't use corn syrup and was pleasantly surprised at how it turned out. I used grandma's recipe for pie crust so I could avoid the processed ones from the store. It is always the first thing people go for when they come over for holidays. This last year, the pecan pie was gone before the turkey was out of the oven!

This made a yummy pecan pie! The only thing I had trouble with was that the pecans I placed on top sunk to the bottom during the baking process. So much for my pretty design, haha! But that is no fault of the recipe. :)  Next time I guess I will add the pecans to the top later in the baking process.

This pie is the best. This is my first pie I have ever made from scratch ( used my own dough recipe from my mom) and it left my family begging for more. My crust would've burned if I had cooked it at 350 for 30. I suggest cooking it for 350 for 20 minutes...check it and cook it for five more. Otherwise it was perfect. It didn't fill up all the way at first but expanded to a beautiful filling.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  I liked it a lot, and I usually don't like pecan pie.  But my family didn't like this as much as the traditional recipe.  For that reason, I probably won't make it again, unless I want some for myself!

Absolutely the best recipe.  I love the fact, I don't have to use corn syrup. I reduced white sugar to 1 tablespoon and added 1 teaspoon more flour.  We (four)ate the whole thing in one day.

Oh My!! I just put this in the oven!! I made pastry from recipe on this sight Basic Flaky Pie Crust. The only two things I decided to do differently is in place of the milk I added 1 tblsp of Jamacian Rum and I followed the baking time in Chef Dawn review. Fantastic!!!

This is by far the BEST pecan pie I have ever tasted! The sugar caramelizes the top of the pie, making a wonderful crispy top. This dessert has become a staple at our Thanksgiving meals, and it never lasts long. I won't go back to a corn-syrup pecan pie ever again!

This is easy to make & is outstanding!  This will be my new pecan pie recipe. I always have brown sugar on hand  but not always corn syrup.  
Also added more pecans than recipe called for....we love pecans...
Thanks for a great recipe!

My pie came out looking rather funny, but it tasted delicious!  Loved not having to use corn syrup:-)  Was kind of runny, but I attributed that to me not doing something exactly right... no matter what, I only got half a piece, so I did something right.

My very first pecan pie and totally loved it. Previous comments and version were very helpful and customized the pie and came out just the way I like it. Not too sweet or gooey. I toasted the pecans a little, omitted white sugar added more pecans and brown sugar. I didnt have dried cherries so I used dried cranberries instead and you never know the difference. Do not use ready-made pie crust. Making the crust itself is easy and worth it.

Made this yesterday.  Was deathly afraid of the odd looking top of the pie.  And the crust did brown very quickly and had to be covered with foil halfway through the baking process.  However, it turned out superb!  I also made the Pioneer Woman's Maple Whiskey Cream Sauce as a topping and it was incredible with this.

This was my first pecan pie, and the best I have ever tasted!  I did read some other reviews and cut out the white sugar, and added an extra tbsp of flour.  Still a bit runny so this week I till try adding 2.  I did the wheel of pecans on top and it was beautiful!  Everyone who tried it wanted the recipe!

Baked 10 min the reduced heat and added pecans on top 30 more min. Try with 50% more filling. Cook 40 minutes when using 50% more filling.

This recipe is wonderful. I'll never use my old corn syrup recipe again. I did use 1.5 cups of pecans plus some arranged nicely on top and used lower baking temps as recommended by other reviewers. I think next time I'll skip the white sugar as this was a little too sweet for my taste.

I have made this pie for both Thanksgiving and Christmas, and it is a big hit!  Everyone argues over the last piece.  I do omit the white sugar and I use 2 cups of pecans.  I foresee being asked to make this for all future family get-togethers.  Thank you!

I made this pie for the first time this past Thanksgiving.  My mother-in-law requested a pecan pie since she knows how I love to bake for the holidays and I chose this one.  I liked that it didn't have the corn syrup in it, so gave it a try.  It was beautiful and it tasted delicious!  Not to mention it was a hit with the in-laws.  It was so easy, by far the easiest pie I've ever made.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  I didn't change a thing and really the only thing I might do differently next year is try a different crust.

I loved this recipe and LOVED the responses I got. Even got a request from my Uncle and Father-in-law to share it. These are old school cooks - it was quite a compliment for me! Pretty much followed all the directions except tripled the pecans - we LOVE pecan pie and this one was wonderful!

My family and I enjoyed this pie.  It was the first time I made it and I was at my brother's house.  Not being familiar with the oven, I thought I had reduced the temperature as directed but I was wrong.  It baked at 400 degrees for about an extra 10-15 minutes.  I successfully reduced the temperature to 325 and baked it for about 10 minutes.  The edge of the crust was burned so I cut it off.  The benefit to this mistake is that the pecans were wonderfully crunchy and carmelized on top.  Next time, I'll probably do the same but cover the crust with foil.   It was a "Happy little accident."

This pie is excellent!!! I didn't even like pecan pie before I made this one! My hubby would be the one to order a slice for desert on occasion and I would sometimes have a taste but I always thought they were too sweet and just didn't taste that great. This is the first pecan pie I've made and it will be the only recipe I ever use. It is very easy to make, has great flavor and it isn't sickly sweet. I used regular brown sugar, whole ground vanilla beans instead of extract (awesome fruity flavor if you haven't used this before) and used pecan halves rather than chopped. Delicious by the slice and cut into bite size for a desert tray :)

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was better than I hoped.  Most pecan pies are too sweet - this was perfect and I will never make one with corn syrup again.

It formed a crust on the top and looked as though it was solid after cooking for the full amount of time.  As I took it out of the oven it tipped a little and out came all the insides of the pie onto the inside of my oven!!!  Delicious pie but I will be a little more careful next time!

Added 1/2 cup more of pecans, placed whole pecans on top to make pretty. Cut out the white sugar and it was still pretty sweet. Added a a couple tablespoons of cocoa powder for a chocolate pecan pie taste. Eat with ice crea and it is delicious! Remember to let it set a bit. Will make again!!

OMG is this good!  Because I had a deep dish pie shell I increased everything by 1/3.  I was a little short on pecans so substituted 1/3 cup walnuts that I mixed with the liquid mixture.  After pouring this into pie plate I then placed pecans on top.  This way they did not "sink" into the mixture as one reviewer mentioned as a problem.  I did cut out the white sugar because I don't like it overly sweet.  Although I increased all other ingredients by 1/3 I kept the butter (1/2 cup) the same.  Decided to make this last minute on Thanksgiving and it was quick, easy and yummy.  Restaurant quality for sure!

This is a rockin' pecan pie recipe! Little different than the others, and that makes it just that much better, IMHO.


The standard recipe is very good with no need for alteration. Next time, I will probably add another 1/3 cup of chopped pecans because I think it can take it - and I like a little more nuts and a little less filling in my pie. Having said that, I still recommend that you try this recipe without alterations first, as it might be the perfect pie for you.


I doubled the batch and baked two pies at the same time on the wire rack with no baking sheet. About half way through baking, I rotated the pies 180 degrees. I let them cook a few extra minutes since there were two pies baking.


For crusts, I used the Pillsbury Pet Ritz frozen variety, thawed before filling, of course.


Hope this helps!

This pie tasted fantastic!  The taste is far superior to the traditional pecan pie.  The only changes I made were to roast the pecans.  I did also add another half cup of pecans on the top of the pie to ensure that it looked nice.  I know there have been some complaints about the foamy top, but this is all you have to do to counter that.  Oh, I did also have to make 1 1/2 recipes to fill my pie crust and then increase cooking time to compensate, but this is common for me.  I will definitely make this recipe again and again!

Delicious, I was trying to find a recipe with out HFCS, this is wonderful...yes it doesn't look like a typical pecan pie, with a crusty top, but it tastes wonderful.  My only suggestion would be to up the pecans.  Definitely keeping this recipe.

My first pecan pie, my husband's favorite and he really liked it! Simple to make. I'm not a huge pecan pie fan, but I think I will try a corn syrup pie in comparison. I'll bet I come back to this recipe!  Took it to a Thanksgiving covered dish and there were not leftovers AT ALL!  Thanks for the submission.

I have made this recipe for many years and lost it.. It was in a book that simple fell apart, I am so glad I found it again. Will never use syrup.
I do use coconut milk and coconut sugar to help make it a bit healthier.
I also have added large coconut flakes to it  ummm

From what I've been told best Pecan pie ever!  I have never tasted it due to the fact that i am allergic to pecans, but it is my hubby's fav.

Good recipe although Next time I will add more pecans and skip the white sugar.  But very easy to bake and this was the first time making a pecan pie!

This may have been one of the best pecan pies I've ever eaten.  Which was awesome since I made it.  I followed other reviewers changes and...
Warmed the eggs to room temp before making this recipe 
Cook at 300 for 50-55 minutes
Mixed sugars & butter well with a portable mixer while butter was hot

A friend made this and I was excited to hear it didn't have any corn syrup in it. After tasting it, I was amazed how good it was. It was alittle crumbly, but delicious all the same. Can't wait to make it myself.

we moved to this house 4 yrs ago, there are 4 pecan trees on the side of the house. The neighbors always told us that they were bad pecans, they would never produced good ones (not smart on our part) we never checked. But this year we finally took a gander, and there was nothing but beautiful great tasting pecans. so i looked up this recipe, and OMG!! this is really good, I have so many pecans falling, that i think everyone in the family will get one of these pecan pies. lol!!! delicious!! thank you

Great recipe! I followed it exactly and its perfect the way it is! No need to change anything in my opinion. I used a homemade pie crust for it instead of store bought.

Seems that I only used to buy corn syrup to make pecan pie-now I can even save a trip to the store because this pie is fabulous!! Added an extra handful of pecans because I liked the thicker filling-Will be making this for Thanksgiving for sure!! THANK YOU SO MUCH for a much simpler and gourmet tasting pie-it's even better the next day because the filling holds up very nicely!

This was my first attempt at a pecan pie and it turned out great! I baked it for 35 minutes, which turned the top very brown and crispy.  I think next time I will only do 30 minutes.  The taste and texture (aside from the crispy top) were wonderful.  Everyone commented how it's not as sickeningly rich as most pecan pies are.  That may be because there is no corn syrup in this recipe.  We all preferred this version.

Thank you for the amazing pecan pie.  My southern wife complimented me, saying it was pretty good, to be made by a northern boy.  I followed the baking instructions exactly, but covered the edge of the crust with foil and then removed it during the last 15 minutes of baking. 

     Also, followed the advice of others to mix the sugars with the butter first, than vanilla, milk, (room temp. whisked)eggs, flour, and pecans.  Made for a nice smooth mix.  Don't forget to smatter the top with pecan halves. 
     
     For the crust I used 1/2 cup of virgin coconut oil, 1/2 tsp of salt, 1 1/3 cups of flour, and 3 tblsp of cold water.  Made for a tender flakey crust packed full of good fat that complimented the filling well.

Absolutely delicious.  The only thing I adjusted was the temperature in increments as others suggested.  I'll try with Splenda next. Thank you for this recipe!

I think I had rated this once before. At first a give it two stars, as I was making it for someone and it turned out really ugly. Then later I upped to to three stars since I was told it tasted good. I'm going to bring it to five stars now, because somehow I got it to look pretty AND it tates fantastic! Most likely I did something wrong the first time. If one simply follows the directions, it should turn out fine. Great recipe!

Pecan Pie V is super easy and delicious!  I have never made pecan pie before. Seriously, so easy and scrumptious! I took the advice of others and baked it for 10 min. at 350 and then for 50 min. at 300.  It turned out beautiful!! So pretty golden brown.  I really couldn't be happier with the outcome, taste and look, also with the simplicity. Thank you for the recipe!

Amazing! I have never attempted a pecan pie before and I could this recipe easy. I made it for a friend who loves pecan pie (and is picky about them) and he loved this one compared to syrup ones. The only problem I had was the pecans that I placed on top kind of sunk..So that was user error. I guess next time I would bake a bit and then place the pecans to prevent sinking.

...Sneak in 1/2 teaspoon of whiskey/bourbon, and you won't regret it.  :-D

After reading other reviews, I was concerned about not filling up a deep dish crust.  I doubled the recipe, but increased pecans to 3 cups total.  As another reviewer suggested, I toasted the pecans for 6 minutes before adding them and used the brown sugar/splenda variation of another reviewer.  Had plenty of filling to fill up 2 deep dish crusts.  Absolutely yummy!  Mu husband loved it!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that there is a lot of fat - 1 stick of butter per pie.  So I definitely would not double the filling to make 1 pie - too much fat.

I want to preface my comment by saying that I have always hated pecan pie and that I, to this day, am not  a pecan pie fan. With that said, even I have to admit that this is, by far, the best pecan pie I have ever tasted! I tried a bite just to make sure that it tasted good enough to serve to others (my husband begged me to make him a pecan pie for Thanksgiving -- I know, I'm a little late with my review) and the pie was great. I still don't like the pecans themselves, but the rest of the pie was truly savory. The pecan pie fans raved about it so much that it convinced non-pecan pie fans to try it and they raved about it, too! I will be making this every Thanksgiving for my husband and will gain a few fans of my baking in the process. Thanks for a great recipe!

This pie is the BEST!!  I'm not a pie person, but I do love pecan pie.  I had never made a pie before, but I tried this for my first pie.  My first one came out a little dark, but tasted so good I tried again but covered it loosely with foil after about 15 min.  That is the only thing I did different.  I took the pie to work, and two of my co-workers told me it was the best pie they ever had, and offered to pay me to make them each one, ha.  Everyone loved it, and this is the only recipe I will use.  YUM!!!!

My family has been making this pie for at least 60 years, possibly longer.  This is a very old recipe, and beats the corn syrup version by a mile.

I made this for Thanksgiving and my family loved it. I had used the Karo syrup recipe in the past and I always thought it never set up good and was too sweet. I'm making another pie today, can't wait to have a slice.

I was not happy with the solid, firm texture, and
taste of too much brown sugar.   Idea is good but
sugary, solid filling didn't resemble the semi-
juicy corn sirup recipes.

Very good pie, everyone at the table loved it! Only comment I have is similar to other reviewers - i found this pie to be a little "empty" looking... I will try adding 1/3-1/2 of the recipe next time to the filling, however it bakes up so high i'm not sure if that will work.

Very good! I followed directions with these exceptions: I added 1.5 cups pecans, baked @ 350 for 15 min., then 300 deg. for 50 min.  Served with extra creamy cool whip... great!!

This pie was SENSATIONAL! Absolutely delicious! I am usually not one to eat all my pecan pie because of the jello-like consistency from the corn syrup, but this pie has no corn syrup and it was the most delicious pecan pie I have ever had in my entire life. I am so happy I found this recipe! Thank you to the original person who submitted this! What a find!

best pecan pie i've ever had - not too sweet, good flavor of pecans, nice consistency despite the lack of syrup. i chopped the pecans into small pieces, which tasted better than whole pieces.

I set out to make a sweet potato/pecan pie for my Thanksgiving dessert, only to realize that my husband hates sweet potato! So at the last minute, I whipped up this pecan pie. It was easy and completely delicious! More caramel-y than the recipes that use corn syrup, which I liked very much. My guests (and husband) also loved it, and it was the first 'leftover' I reached for as I was cleaning up this morning! I only wish that there had been more of the pie filling, because there wasn't quite enough to fill the pie crust. I will definitely make this again.

Oh WOW, an incredible pie!  My buddy made this, his first time with a pecan pie, and followed everything except for the changes in temperature (375 for first 10 min, then 300 for remaining), and adding a few decorative pecans on the top. Fabulous tasting pie -  sweet like candy, but not over the top. As a rule I have chocolate for almost every dessert, but I did not miss my chocolate with this pie for dessert!  Definitely a keeper!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving.  It's amazing.  I did not change anything.  The only difficulty I had was determining if it was done.  I baked it a little longer to be on the safe side.  It was perfect!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a BIG hit!  I even used the Splenda brown sugar.  This is officially my favorite pie recipe!

I have never had pecan pie without corn syrup, so this pie had a very different texture - but it was delicious!!!  I beat my eggs too much and the foam made a crust on top of the pie that looked a bit strange.  I also added a tablespoon of brandy for a kick.

This was the perfect recipe for a not too gooey pie! It was very easy to make and tasted like perfection. I prefer this recipe to the ones using karo syrup!

I was really skeptical that I could make a good pecan pie because I have always thought they were hard. I was so wrong! This pie was SO delicious and EASY! I actually doubled the recipe because when I poured it into the pie crust it didn't look very full so I just made a second batch, yes it was that easy! I also used pecan halves and put them on the top instead of mixing them in to the filling. I had to cook it a lot longer than it specified. I think I cooked it for over an hour. I turned it down to 300 after about 30 minutes at 350. I thought it wasn't going to get firm but it eventually did. Needless to say, this will be a desert I cook often! So easy and very delicious!

Really like this version of pecan pie. Good taste, no corn syrup. It does not quite fill the pie shell so I added 2 cups of pecans. I also prefer to keep my pecans mostly whole instead of chopped. I prefer the visual presentation that way. This is a keeper.

UH. MAY. ZING. Loved how it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet!  I did use 1 tbsp of Splenda  in the place of the white sugar to cut some of the calories. Also I made sure to temper my eggs when adding the hot butter, and strained the egg-butter mixture to prevent cooked egg pieces in the pie.  Took the advice of some of the reviews and reduced the temp gradually - ended up with a nice, crispness on the top of the filling. Tried this for Thanksgiving this year - was a big hit with my family, so much that they requested I bake another one!

I'm a little nervous. I followed this recipe very closely, except I added 2 teaspoons of bourbon and 1/4 more nuts. When it came out of the oven, the pie was all puffy and cracked so I'm hoping it's not overdone and dry. Next time I'll try lowering the temp like so many reviewers have suggested.

EXCELLENT PIE!  I love to bake but had never attempted to bake a Pecan Pie.  We were having our new neighbours over for an American Thanksgiving dinner, as they had just moved here from Savannah, Georgia.  I decided to give this Pecan Pie a try.  Everyone at our dinner party gave it a thumbs up and said it was the best Pecan Pie ever!  I will be baking this for a lot of different dinner parties now.  I did change the baking time to 350 for 15 minutes then 300 for 50-55 minutes.

Haven't tried, but going to.  Only rated to ask question.  The one thing missing is if a frozen or fresh/thawed pie crust was used.  If you use either frozen or fresh does anyone flash bake their crust before adding pie filling?  I think the Karo Syrup is making my frozen crust still soggy in the middle.  I've tried adding 1-2 tablespoons of flour to make the Karo Syrup recipe I have firmer.

I ran out of vanilla so I omitted it.  I also added a dash of cinnamon.  Best pecan pie I've ever had! 

I've made it a second time for Thanksgiving and I substituted the brown sugar with brown sugar splenda mix & the white sugar with truvia (my father is diabetic).  My parents raved about the pie, and I will be making it again for christmas. :)

My husband's favorite dessert is pecan pie.  I don't like it because of the corn syrup so I never make it.  I came across this recipe and decided to try it since he always asks me to make one.  He was hesitant because there was no corn syrup.  He now prefers this one and pecan pie is one of my favorite desserts.  The top is crisp and delicious, not chewy like those awful corn syrup ones.  Great warm and topped with vanilla ice cream!!!!!

My granddaughter does not like corn syrup.  I found this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I did the recipe straight and only changed the cooking time to 350 for 15 min and 325 for the remainder of 55 min.  My friends and my granddaughter loves this pie.  Her 3 year old son is currently begging for a piece as I write this.  It is also very easy to make. It smells great out of the oven.  Definitely a winner

I made this recipe for the first time last week. However, instead of using light brown sugar, I used brown sugar. It seemed to be a little too sweet for my taste but everyone else absolutely loved it.

I made this with a canola oil/flour crust off this site, and it was alright, but not the best. My fiance loves pecan pie and won't eat it. He said it reminded him of the kind of pie they serve at a place like Denny's. His complaint was that it didn't have enough pecans, even though I did the 1 cup chopped plus pecans on top. If you like a lot of pecans in your pie, I suggest adding an extra 1/4 cup or more to mixture. I baked mine at 350 for 15 minutes and 300 for 55 minutes, as a previous reviewer suggested. It did not burn that way, which was a nice change from my mom's pie, but it was a little too soft on the bottom for my liking that way.

This does not taste like the pecan pie that I am used too (like the store bought ones, haha) but it is def. tasty. I made two pies and overcooked the first one and the second one I got out in time. Both were delicious.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I have been making this for about 6 years or so (since I was 11) & not once has it failed. I have received tons of compliments for it throughout the years & it has always been a success! Thank you for sharing! :D

This is absolutely the BEST pecan pie I have ever eaten.  I made this for Thanksgiving last year and, unfortunately for me, my family does not like pecan pie.  I ate it piece by piece until the entire thing was gone!  My daughter's boyfriend, who is a Marine and coming home on leave, also LOVES this pie and it is the one thing he has requested when he gets home this next weekend.  I think we'll be eating a pie together!!!

I've made this a few times now and it is excellent! It is the only pecan pie recipe I use. Personally I prefer more pecans so I add about 1/4 cup more than called for. Thank you for the delicious recipe!

Loved this pie!!!! I made it for my nephew also. He told me he liked this recipe better than the one with Karo Syrup but since Grandma (my mother) makes the traditional pie he would never state that to anyone else. That was cute.

While it didn't look like a 'regular' pecan pie it tasted amazing! Even my father, who claims to be the biggest pecan pie fan in the world, loved this one. I didn't make any changes to the recipe other than laying pecans on the top in a star pattern which made it look fabulous. Have made twice since Thanksgiving!

This recipe was fantastic, and so easy to make! 

Instead of light brown sugar, I used dark brown sugar, and instead of vanilla extract, I just added some vanilla sugar. I baked the pie on a low level in 175c for 10 minutes, and then for additional 40 minutes at 150c. 

Recipe for crust:
3,5 dl flour
125 g cold butter
2 tbsp sugar
1/4 tsp salt
1,5 tbsp cold water

Mix the butter and the flour by hand, add sugar and salt, and enough water to form a ball.

This is the best pie recipe.  Now if I can find a gluten free pie crust that will make it taste as good as it was the first time.  Definately not too sweet.  Just right.

This was a fantastic and easy to make pecan pie.  I loved that I did not have to run out and buy corn syrup in order to make it. I also used a little bit less sugar than was asked for in the recipe.

I LOVE this recipe. I have taken it to two holiday events this year and everyone thinks it is awesome. I am so glad to not have to measure the corn syrup or deal with having a partial bottle sitting around. Also, the taste is far better. The texture is awesome, and the pie is less sweet, more buttery, and just altogether tastier.

I thought this recipe was EASY and Delicious!  I didn't fill the pie up very full though. Maybe next time I will double the recipe. For as long as I had it in, my crust got very dark though. Eitherway it was devoured by all!

Delicious!!!  I haven't made pecan pie in years and this recipe is definitely a keeper.  I really don't know what the reviews that discuss the top not looking like a "traditional pie" are talking about.  Pecans float to the top, that is why you are supposed to mix them into the batter.  They will surface, but the mixture on them also gives them that carmelized flavor.   Very yummy.  You can rearrange them after they float to the top for presentation or you can not mix them in and arrange them on top after you fill your pie crust.  Either way, this pie is sooooooo good.

I was skeptical about this recipe at first but it turned out great. I followed other baker's baking times, though similar, the pie turned out perfect. I used the cup of chopped pecans inside the pie and put a half a cup of whole ones on top. Delicious!

I've always loved pecan pie, but I don't like corn syrup!  I was happy to try this recipe, and now it's my favorite.  I used 1 -1/2 cups of pecans, 1/2 + 1/2 (instead of milk) and 2 teaspoons of vanilla. This is why I gain weight during the holidays!!

Perfect pecan pie! YUMM!!!!! I haven't made a pecan pie in probably 15 years because the corn syrup pies never work for me. This one turned out perfect! I added about 1/4 cup more pecans and used whole pecan halves, not pieces, and baked it at 400 degrees for 10 minutes and then 300 degrees for 40 minutes. Turned out perfect!

Came out excellent, and I was a hero to my husband for making a pecan pie without corn syrup. I found that to fill the pie shell, I had to increase the recipe 1.5 times. Accordingly, I also had to bake it longer.

I have never had pecan pie so I can't compare it to others but I got a lot of rave reviews from friends. Maybe it was a problem with my oven but it took me almost 75 minutes to bake (15 at 350 and then 60 at 300).

Took forever to set - about 2 hours at 300. Was worth it though. The top looked kind of strange, but tasted great. The lack of syrup made it less sweet, which my husband and I really liked. Traditionalists in my family didn't really like it though. I'll be making it for my husband and I though!

Barely got to taste this as it disappeared so quickly. I really enjoyed this and my guests ate it right up (even with an assortment of 7 other desserts). It is not as sweet as a traditional pecan pie. Not for a deep dish/pie crust.

I don't care what anybody else says this pie is AMAZING!! This was my first time making pecan pie for our big family Thanksgiving and I was hesitant because it did not have corn syrup and it was the most asked for dessert but after reading the reviews and seeing the ratings I decided to try it. It was a major hit and out of the 6 pies we had it was the first to go! It didn't have that sickening syrupy sweetness but was still sweet enough for my hubby who has a major sweet tooth, it's the best one he's ever had he said. I doubled the recipe to fill a 9-inch deep dish pie crust and followed the suggestions of others and lowed to the temperature to 350 for 15 minutes and then 300 for 50-55 minutes. I will definitely be making this for Thanksgivings to come!

This is a fantastic Pecan Pie. Tastes like a New Orleans Praline! The only issue I had is that the filling was not enough for a regular 9-inch pie. I would recommend doing 1/2 again as much filling.

Since I'm diabetic, I figured if I want to enjoy my favorite desserts, I need to learn to make them myself since a lot of the store sugar-free or no sugar added don't always taste great. I took a risk this year on Thanksgiving and attempted my first pie from scratch ever with this recipe. I substituted the sugars with the Splenda blends and it turned out very good but not like your traditional pecan pie...drier? (I'm sure it has something to do with the way Splenda doesn't carmelize exactly like regular sugar? I dunno). It turned out more like pralines which I absolutely love. I ended up converting a lot of my family members who usually do not like pecan pie and also impressed a few of my family members who grew up in the south. I would definitely use this recipe again..maybe adjust it a little to accomodate to my needs :)

This was a huge hit at our Thanksgiving!  I added about a 1/4 tsp of salt to the filling mixture to bring out the brown sugar/butter taste and it was amazing!  I will be using this recipe from now on, instead of the traditional recipe w/corn syrup.

This is definitely different than the typical pecan pie, but still great. I also added chocolate chips to the mixture and put a layer of half pecans on top.  Also very good reheated.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Made this exactly as written.  Came out great.  The pie is not as sweet as a cornsyrup pecan pie, also the mixture underneath the pecans is not as syrupy/clear like a traditional pie.  Its a keeper recipe, great thing is you generally have all the ingredients in the pantry.  You must try it!!

I made 2 of these for Thanksgiving this week and everyone said it was the BEST pecan pie they ever tasted and that was with store bought crust! I can't wait to make a homemade crust and try it again. I'm sure it'll be even better. Thank you for a great recipe sans corn syrup!

I just made this pie and while I haven't cut into it yet it looks and smells delicious!  I made it gluten free by making a GF crust and replacing the flour with rice flour and about an 1/8th tsp of xanthan gum.  Like the other reviewers suggested I cooked it at 350 for 10 mins then 300 for 50 mins - I also added some pecans to the top.

The pie was delicious! I can't believe there was no corn syrup in it. However, I followed someone's recommendation of cooking the pie for 10 minutes at 350 and lowering it to 300 for 55 minutes and the pie cracked in the middle. So next time, I'll try not cooking it for so long and see how it turns out. But it is delicious!

I'm giving this a 4 star based solely on taste (which is really the most important thing!). I received nothing but good reviews from my family when I made this yesterday. However, it does not look anything like your typical pecan pie. I even arranged halved pecans on top in a cute little arrangement, but during cooking they all sank down into the pie which left the top with just a plain looking brown crust.  One piece of advice that I followed from other reviewers is that if you have a deep dish pie crust, the filling will not fill the crust adequately. I doubled the recipe but was left with a bit of filling left over. Next time I wouldn't quite double it, but it definitely needs more than what is listed if you have a deep dish. I also lowered the bake temp and increased time. Would definitely make again.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I personally did not care much for it, but my guests raved about it.  I made it exactly as directed, except for adding a few pecans to the top as other reviewers suggested.  I would make it again because everyone loved it.

This recipe was super easy and quick, and yielded a pecan pie that was (according to my family)"The best they'd ever had!"  It has a pecan praline taste, and when whipped cream is added on top, the combination is much like the flavor of Butter Pecan ice cream! Definitely a Keeper! Bravo!

Yummy, easy pecan pie.  This came out perfectly and was a big hit with no changes made.  I did use a Mrs. Smith deep dish pie crust, which help the filling perfectly and made a beautiful pie.

Who needs corn syrup!?  The other reviews were right on.  More flavor, less tooth-dissolving sweetness.  Everyone loved it.

This was delicious.  So glad I tried a new recipe this year for pecan pie.  I made a pie just for us to snack on the rest of the weekend, so I felt no shame in cutting a sliver tonight to test out.  Very good!

Just cooked this up (more or less) doubling the pecans (additional cup on top) and the cook time was spot on. I got in and turned the pies a few times as I tend to do.  Took about ten minutes longer to finish than directed but that's acceptable. If the smell is any indication, these pies will be the stars of tomorrow's desserts. And present well too!

This was a delicious recipe and I was so excited to find a pecan pie recipe without cornsyrup!!  I do have a question.  The nuts in my pie didn't rise to the top but rather it was almost like browned eggwhite crust on top.  I wondered why this may have happened?  I did follow someones sug. and baked it at a slightly lower temp (350 15 min and then 300 for 55).

This is such a fantastic recipe. I love pecan pie, but hate it when its too sweet or falls apart when you try and serve it. This stays together when you serve it warm and it tastes even better than the typical recipes! I was on weight watchers for a while and used splenda white and brown sugars to make it less calories. YUMMY! Thank you Elaine Helms!

Amazingly easy! This pie is in the oven right now, and I'm giving it to a neighbor, but it was SO easy to make, and it smells incredible. Only change I made was doubling the pecans.

Delicious!! Made no changes to the recipe except the cooking time. Cooked for 15 mins on 350 then lowered to 300 for 55 mins. Came out perfect! I'm going to make one for my FIL with Splenda because he's diabetic. Pecan pie is his favorite...but its so loaded with sugar that he can no longer eat it. He's gonna be so happy!! Excellent recipe, thanks Elaine!!

This pie was delicious! I used whole pecans to top the pie prior to cooking so it could mask the filmy top layer that reviewers speak of. It took a little longer to bake than the recipe called for and once I noticed the crust was brown, I immediately covered the pie with foil and continued baking until the center was done.

Awesome recipe for pecan pie.  I loved it.  I think I might have over cooked it a bit because the filling was a bit dry.  The flavor was great.  I will surely make this again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is the best pecan pie I've ever had, it might be the best of any kind of pie I've ever had.  I'm a big nut fan, but I can never bear more than a couple of bites of the sickeningly-sweet corn-syrup pecan pies.  This one was amazing and the perfect sweetness.  I will never make a corn-syrup pie again.

Thank you. My husband loves pecan pie and I have never been able to conquer it. Until now of course. This was so easy to make,and I loved the fact that it had no corn syrup in it. I served it on Thanksgiving and it got rave reviews from all.

This was an amazing recipe! I added an extra handful of pecans to each pie. Rave reviews from everyone - even those who usually do not like pecan pie.

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving.  I wanted a recipe that did not include Karo syrup and this surpassed all expectation.  I did use extra Pecans to decorate the top.

Best pecan pie I've ever tasted! Definitely sweet enough but not sickly sweet like most pecan pies, which allows the flavor of the pecans to come through. I substituted Splenda for the white sugar and you'd never know the difference. I also added about 1/4 cup extra pecans because I LOVE them! Yum!

I'm not sure I'll ever bother with a corn syrup recipe again! This was wonderful and so simple! I love that it is not gooey like typical pecan pies, but still has that traditional pecan pie flavor. Just fantastic!

Wow, this pie was fantastic! I baked it alongside an apple pie for Christmas and to my surprise the clear favourite was this one! Even the relatives that don't like nuts were ranting and raving. I followed the recipe to a 't' and the taste was superb. My only complaint would be that the top cracked a bit when baking, perhaps next year I will turn the heat down in the oven to prevent it. Otherwise this is my go-to pecan pie recipe!

This was my first time ever baking a pecan pie and it couldn't have been easier! Its also delicious! I didn't have a traditional pie crust handy so I used a graham cracker crust without any problem. I also followed another reviewer's suggestion and baked it at 300 degrees until the top started to crack (about an hour). I will definitely make this again!

I listened to the other reviewers and dissolved 1T of flour into 1/4 cup of butter and added it to the rest of the ingredients. I'm glad I did because it worked well, I cooked it for the full 45min and it turned out perfect. I gave it a 4 star because I did change the recipe, and also because it wasn't as ooey gooey as I was hoping. I think it lacked flavor too. Other reviewers said it was too sweet. I don't agree. I think next time I will try brown sugar, but yes there will be a next time!

Best Ever!  Though I always made pecan pie (corn syrup) for my hubby, I never ate pecan pie till I found your version.   Now it's the only one my friends and family will eat!   It gets rave reviews every time.  Thank you Elaine, for sharing this wonderful recipe with us!  10 Stars for You!

This was a hit on Thanksgiving day!  My Mom just loved it!  I liked it as well!    It seemed to have a high pecan to filling ratio, so next time I'll probably cut down the pecans or at least chop them a bit.    Again, LOVED IT!  Bit hit!  Thanks for sharing!

My husband is more of a fan for Pecan Pie then me. This recipe changed that. My husband and I both loved this pie. Way better then the Karo pie. I followed the recipe to a T except I throw 1/2c more pecans. Thank you Elaine.

Ok so...this was my first pecan pie ever.  I am not really a fan of pecan pie but my husband is so I decided to give this one a whirl.  Oh my goodness...it is excellent!  The only things I changed was I did half marg and half butter.  I also added 1 T. of corn syrup because per other reviewers I wasn't sure about the no corn syrup.  (Just for good measure).  This will be the recipie I use for every holiday!  Thank you very much Elaine!

Great and easy recipe. Took other suggestions and lowered the temp for baking to 350 and 300 degrees. I also used a premade graham cracker crust (only thing I had on hand). Sprinkled some chocolate chips on the bottom of the crust before pouring the mix over. Was a big hit for Christmas Eve family get-together.

simply amazing!!  I used the lowfat butter and it came out perfect and a few less calories and fat--but all the taste!  I toasted the pecans for a few minutes before putting them in.

I've never heard of  this pie without corn syrup. It was excellent. I used Rapadura sugar instead of the brown and white sugar, and it still turned out great. This is a nice, healthy alternative. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was very easy to make.  I made this pie for my brother, the pecan pie lover, and he absolutely loved it.  If you like it be a little more "pecany", I put in an extra half cup of pecans.  Came out great!

Delicious, and simple to make! Mine turned out lop sided once it was baked and all, not sure why...but as I said on Thanksgiving, just because its ugly doesn't mean it doesn't taste great! Used the Mrs. Smith deep dish crust, per another's review and worked wonderfully.

Absolutely wonderful! I made a different recipe the day before Thanksgiving and it was all runny so I was desperate to find a different recipe when I found this one. It was better than the first. I have been trying different pecan pie recipes for 3 years now and this one is better than all the rest. Everyone finished the pie in one day! Thank you so much for the recipe!

Great pie! It was the first time I'd ever baked a pie and it was for Thanksgiving dinner! It took a long time to bake (1.5 hours) but turned out well. Thank you!

This is so much better than the Karo syrup version.  I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone was raving about it.  I used a deep dish pie pan so I had to double the recipe.  I think I slightly undercooked it though so I will have to experiment with the cooking times as a deep dish pie.  Excellent!!!

This was not the prettiest pie I have ever seen, but it was one of the most delicious.  My husband and I decided that the pie's appearance must be a defense mechanism to dissuade predators off from eating it.  I found that the amount of filling was a little scant and the next time I make it I will either use an 8 inch shell or increase the recipe by 50%.  The directions are confusing since they indicate that the oven should be preheated to 350 but then the cooking directions indicate that the pie should be started at 400.  I ended up overcooking it a little.  However, the pie is so good, that even with clear baking instructions, it turned out terrific.

This was the best pecan pie in the world. It didn't have that over sweet corn syrup taste.  My family loved it. I am going to make it again today.

This was so easy to make, and everyone raved about it.  It is so much better than the corn syrup based pies.  I used 1.5x the amount of pecans to thicken it up and the results were great.  I had never made pecan pie before, and frankly have never been a fan of it.  Now I am a huge fan, and will be making this pie every Thanksgiving and Christmas.

This was sooo easy!  And it got rave reviews at Thanksgiving... some even went back for seconds.  Then came over for thirds the next day!  I took the advice of one of the reviews... 350 for 15 minutes then 300 for 55 minutes.

My mother liked this but I was waiting for the jelly like consistancy of the regular pecan pie.  It tasted fine, but I would probably put more pecans in it.

I have never made a pecan pie so I had nothing to compare it to, but this came out tasting and looking great.  I did follow the recommended time adjustments other reviewers suggested.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  It's great to find a recipe that did not call for corn syrup.  Yummy!

Finally!! I was able to create an edible pecan pie. I have tried and tried over the years and for some reason, I have failed consistently. It would drive me crazy because I can make all kinds of pies with success but never pecan and my grandmother always claimed that it is the easiest to make. This year I followed the advise of one of the reviewers and cooked it until it began to crack on top, the results was a pecan pie that was set in the middle and tasted terrific.

I found this recipe by looking at ratings.  I have made the one with corn syrup and didn't like it.  This was excellent - it was definitely the best pecan pie recipe I have ever tried and was incredibly easy.  I added more pecans because my husband loves them but next time I might go with just over a cup.  Served with fresh whipped cream with sugar and vanilla - a definite keeper recipe!

With the exception of my Uncle's pecan pie, this IS the very best pecan pie I have ever had!!!!  I usually am disgusted by pecan pies because I do not like karo syrup, this IS the bomb!!!  I have made several, some with shortbread crusts and some all butter recipe crusts, either way you cannot go wrong:)  Thank you soooo much for sharing, Elaine!

Delicious! However, according to the directions it does not say to add pecans on top after pouring in the filling, so my pie looked rather non-pecanish! I should have sprinkled more pecans on the top rather than just mixed in filling. Oh well, I will try again! It really was simple and a nice alternative to corn syrup : )

Loved this pie!  Used Nucoa for the butter and vanilla soy milk for the milk (my daughter is allergic to milk and butter).  I toasted the pecans and it came out tasting wonderful!  There wasn't a crumb left.  It was a bit flaky on the top,  but it was delish!

This was my first time trying and making pecan pie.  It was a success.  If I ever make it again, I will use this recipe.  Preheat the oven to 350 and bake for 15 minutes.  Turn down the oven to 300 and bake for 50 minutes.

This pie is amazing! I made it for Thanksgiving this year and read the reviews first. I actually wound up doubling the recipe and I baked it in a 9.5" deep pie dish. I ran out of brown sugar so I just added a little more white sugar to make up the difference. I followed other reviews and baked the first 15 mins at 350 and then reduced it to 300. After 50 mins I thought it was still rather runny inside even though there was a light colored crust on top. So I took a knife and broke down the crust and mixed it back into the batter and baked another 30 mins at least, maybe longer (I just kept checking it).   It turned out great and I can't wait to make it again!

Wanted to try this because of all the reports of how bad corn syrup is for us, and these do not use it.  They are tasty, but not that gooey yumminess we really look for when we splurge on pecan pie, so will probably not use often.  Pecan pie is a special treat around here, so guess we will stick with that rare use of corn syrup.

I am floored that I actually pulled this off!  I modified the recipe and used a mini muffin pan, ready made pie crust, and made pecan pie bites.  I increased the pecans by 1/2 a cup but I would use 1 cup the next time.  I also toasted the pecans beforehand and was forced to use pecan pieces because all the stores around were out of chopped. I also cooked it at 400 for about 10 minutes and turned it down to 350 for another 15 minutes.  I will cook it for 5 minutes less next time.  My mom has already eaten 2, so I will need to hide them until guests arrive!  These are delish I will probably make them for the other upcoming holidays!

Being born and raised in the south, I was a little skeptical about not using Karo syrup in my pie, gave this a try....ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!  We will never go back to our old recipe.  Like many suggested I used 1 1/2 cups walnuts...Give this a try, you won't be sorry!  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

I made this for my family Thanksgiving and I've already had requests to make 3 more!  Everyone was fighting over the last piece!  It was so great and I must admit I enjoyed all the compliments on my baking even though it was incredibly easy to make!

I thought the Pecan Pie was very good but it didn't fill the whole 9 inch pie plate. It needed more filling.

Wow! This pie is phenomenal! The only change I made to the original recipe was adding a bit of cinnamon. I also used the Pie Crust IV recipe from this site for the crust. Next time I think I'll double the filling. Yum!

This pie reminded me of Thanksgivings long ago when they girls would spend hours baking pies in the kitchen. It was perfect! I used whole wheat flour and you couldnt tell the difference in flavor. I put in a cup of pecans, a little more would have been good too. My husband and I LOVED this pie!!!!

Pecan pie is my all-time favourite dessert, and this recipe made me love it even more! It's lighter and not so sickly sweet.  I made Thanksgiving over here in England and used this recipe, and now I've been asked to make it as a wedding dessert and for other special occasions.  This is the only recipe I'll ever use for pecan pie!

Better even then I expected! Store bought have always turned me off (way too sweet with scary ingredients), but this was perfect. All the pecan pie lovers in my family say this is their absolute favorite.

did anyone else experience a meringue-like layer on the top of the pie? might have been because i didn't pay very good attention and added the (unbeaten) eggs to the butter/sugar, then beat it all together. anyway, i got a great tasting pecan pie with a thin layer of meringue on top.

My first homemade pie and I liked it.  It's not as gooey as the first-ever pecan pie I tasted in my life, I think that's a good thing.  My only modification was I reduced the amount of sugars (3/4 cup packed brown sugar and 1/8 cup white).  It was still too sweet for me and my husband so I'll be using less sugar next time, but it's a hit for my finicky five-year-old and my eat-almost-anything three-year-old. I wonder if the top should really turn out as crunchy as mine did.  Anyway, thanks for sharing this recipe.

Absolutely fantastic pecan pie! Love it! I made it yesterday morning and it is almost gone. I have a small container for a fried as well ( otherwise I think I would eat the whole pie ). My daughter loves it too and I can't wait to make it again. Used just under the 1/4c white sugar but left everything else the same. Cooked 10 mins on 165 ( forced fan oven ) and then reduced cooking time to 30 mins on 140 degrees. Had to cover about 20 mins into the last part of cooking to prevent edges from getting too dark. Still turned out perfect! Will make again and again, smiles!  This is the 2nd time I am rating this recipe again 5 stars. I have made it twice now with macadamia nuts and it is beautiful. A fab recipe for both pecan or macadamia pie. Love them both. I always get asked for the recipe or to bring a pie along to a get together....... YUMMY!!

This is absolutely one of the best pecan pies I have tasted. I made this and it was gone within the hour! My husband told me not to make it anymore because he could not stop eating it! This recipe was so easy and I liked it so much because it wasn't sickening sweet. It was perfect and the top was crunchy. Just the way I like it. This will be the only recipe I ever use from now on!

This pie is awesome!  It is not too sweet like most pecan pies.  I baked it for 10 minutes.  Then turned the oven down to 300 and baked for 45 minutes.  It came out perfect.

Delicious!  I added 2 T. of real maple syrup and decreased the butter by 2 T. I also doubled the pecans, mixing most of them in and putting the rest on top before baking. I used a Pillsbury Ready Crust. I also set a foil square a little larger than the pie over the top to protect the crust from burning. I bake a lot and had never made pecan pie before. I'll use this recipe from now on!

This turned out great--the best pecan pie I've had to date.  One thing: allow it to cool completely before serving otherwise it's pecan syrup in a crust.  But still way yummy!

Absolutely fantastic! I can't wait for my husband to get home and try this pie. :) I doubled the pecans and shouldn't have, but the pie is wonderful. Next time I'll make the recipe as stated. Thanks for a great pie without the icky corn syrup!

My husband asked me to make this for him twice in one week! Pecan pie has always been his favorite and this recipe was amazing! I think it's the best pecan pie we've ever had. I did adjust the cooking times like other reviews suggested. 350 degrees for 15 minutes and 300 degrees for 55.

This is the first time I have ever made a pecan pie...I wanted something easy and special to do for Christmas...this recipe was awesome!  The pie turned out absolutley perfect & everyone loved it...the only thing I did differently was added more nuts....on a good pecan pie, you can't have too many pecans!  This is definately a keeper!

Delicious! I'm not a pecan pie person, but I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. I had a slice and it was definitely the best pecan pie I've ever had!

I love that it didn't have corn syrup, but it is definitely different than the pecan pie I'm used to.  Tastey, just be prepared for a bit grittier.

I had one little slice of this pie.  My family gulped the rest of it down.  I'm not a big fan of pecan pie, so this was made for my husband and kids who loved it.

it was absolutly delish, it might ful you as it is cooking becase as it bakes it starts to puff up like a cakeand as it sits out is goes down. i used a deep dish pie crust and added more pecans and a went by her recipe too and made two pies. they were both gone by the end of the day. the deep dish made it so i had more crust (just because i like alot of crust).

Living in rural Australia it is hard to find corn syrup so this recipe was just too good to be true when found. But the best part of all it was delicious. Have made it several times & has turned into a family favourite. I also always make my own pastry so I think that always makes it extra special!

I tried this recipe during this past holiday and everyone loved it!! This was the first time that I made one without using Karo syrup, so I was afraid to try something new, since I was baking for guests. However it was a hit to be repeated!!

this was very very yummy... my husband wasn't sure because the top developes a thin crispy crust that doesn't look like a pecan pie "should" look.  However, after the first bite he was hooked!

It was easy to make, and was very tasty. Also, it is wonderful with some vanilla ice cream, but it is very good without it too. Thanks!!

Wonderful pecan pie recipe, I like it more than traditional corn syrupy ones. It isn't the most attractive pecan pie ever, but as long as you don't mind that, try it! I made no changes to the recipe at all and it was great.

This was the first pie I ever made and I made this for the first time this Thanksgiving and it was a hit. I'm making it again for Christmas dinner tomorrow. I followed the advice of another reviewer and started at 350 for 15 minutes then reduced to 300 for 50 minutes. This is definitely better chilled and I enjoyed it even more the next day. Great recipe!

YUM! Super-easy and wonderfully tasty. One note - it did take longer to cook that the receipe says. I had it on 400 for 10 mins, but I think it took about 50 min to cook at 350. I will be making this again!

Incredible!  It taste like a warm pecan brownie.  Try using the Graham Cracker crust.  Definitely works well.  Unless you make your own dough, there really isn't a store brand pie dough I would consider tasty.

This recipe was VERY good, I baked it for Thanksgiving and my entire family raved about it, and were sorry there was only one and not two pies!  However, that being said, I will say that I made this one by accident, I was looking to make the Irresistable Pecan Pie from this site, I made that the year before and I believe it was better.  What I did not like about this one is that it sort of seperated into 3 layers of consistency with the bottom being VERY gooey, and I like gooey so this was just not quite right, a little too thin.  Other than that, the TASTE was good, but the other recipe has a very consistent filling.

I love this recipe, easy and delicious.  People who aren't crazy about pecan pie enjoy this.  I use rum extract, and add a little extra pecans. I always get asked to make it again. I think I need to go make one now...

Although not real pretty so so tasty. Every one who had it said how much better they liked it then the traditional one, Even the pie some one brought from the professional bakery. As long as you dont care that is real attractive this is the best pecan pie!

WOW! This is different than any other pecan pie I've ever eaten.  The taste is fabulous.  I did add some salt, and used roasted pecans.  To die for!  I made it for my husband and am trying to not devour the whole thing myself.

I made this for members of my family who cannot eat gluten by substituting rice flour for the regular flour and baking it in a wheat free pie crust ("Melt in your mouth shortbread").  I also followed the baking instructions of some of the other reviews.  It tasted wonderful, and I plan to make it again in the future!

This was my first time making pecan pie. I followed the recipe exactly other than lowering the temp as suggested by others. Placed in deep dish crust. Turned out perfectly. Best served warm.

wow.  i can't say enough about this recipe.  i don't even like pecan pie usually and this was amazing.  i melted the butter, added the flour and sugar until they cooked together dissolving the sugar then added the rest.  poured it into a read made crust and boom it's done.  so simple and i made it 2 days ahead!  highly recommended.

Clearly this recipe doesn't need more praise, however I made 3 pies for Thanksgiving and this was clearly the hit of the party.  It is buttery, soft and delicious.  I toasted my pecans before I mixed them in and I topped the pie with pecan halves arranged in concentric circles.  Will definitely make again.

Followed the recipe to a T and it turned out great. I have made pecan pies in the past and they turned out hard because I could never get them to bake correctly, then ended up over baking! This was simple! I did cover my pie crust with some tin foil as one reviewer suggested and it helped to keep it brown, not burnt. I used the double pastry pie crust from this site as well, GREAT!

I make a Pecan Pie every Thanksgiving and Christmas - my husband's favorite pie.  I loved this -- but I'm not normally a Pecan Pie lover -- because it didn't have that syrupy middle.  But my husband was't a fan -- again, because it didn't have the traditional syrupy middle.  So - I averaged the 5 stars I would have gave with his 3 stars.  The pie tasted more like pralines (yummy!) but it definitely a diffent taste/texture than the ones with corn syrup.

This pie was super easy and it tasted really good... it did kinda weird but if you put extra pecans on the top in a design it looks a bit better

This is my absolute go to Thanksgiving pie recipe.  Love that it isn't so sweet that you can taste the pecans.  My husband, kids AND father in law all request it, so I need to make two at a time.  Make it just as presented.  So easy my son (13) made one too this year.

Awesome recipe! It was so easy to make and it tasted delicious. It wasn't too sweet due to the fact that it doesn't call for corn syrup. My crust did turn really dark quickly so next time I'll cover the crust with tinfoil for half the cooking time. This is the perfect pecan pie recipe!

This is my new favorite pecan pie recipe! It tasted so much better than the sickly sweet stuff. I made two pies and gave one to my neighbor who said it was the best pecan pie she had ever had. My only disappointment is that it crumbles easily so the presentation isn't fabulous, but in the end, who cares, it still tastes good!

Awesome. I put a layer of pecan halves on the top to cover up the "ugliness" and it came out beautiful. THe top layer added an extra cup of nuts, so next time I might cut the chopped nuts in the pie to 1/2 c.

I chose this one for my first every pie. This is a great flavored pie and easy to make.  The baking times is what I had problem with.  The middle was not set up when we cut in the pie several hours later. Once I figure that out it will be better, But over all a pretty good pie!!!

Easy recipe and great taste. I added about 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans and placed about 1/2 cup pecan halves around outer edge of pie and center for decoration. I'm glad I did. It would have looked a bit unappetizing. Followed suggestions from other reviewers and baked 10min at 400 and then 50min at 300. I was scared it was over baked but it turned out very nice.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and I had to fight to get a small slice.  It was a hit!  Much better than the recipes with corn syrup.  This tastes more "real".  Thanks!

This pie had a good flavor....however, the sugar didn't dissolve well.  It had a sandy sugar texture...I followed the recipe exactly and followed the other reviews baking at 300 for 55 minutes.

I made this pie with my 1 1/2 year old daughter, and brought it to grandma and grandpa's house for Thankgiving dinner. We ended up leaving before dessert, and my parents were left with the whole pie. It disappeared before dinner the next day; my mom no longer wants a birthday cake, she wants a pecan pie! My dad actually said that it was better than HIS mother's pecan pie, so I'm going to make it again this weekend so I can try this delicious pie! I did use the lower temperature adjustment and will probably add another half recipe to fill out my deep crust pie plate.

Everyone loved this recipe. I wanted to keep it moist (some reviewers said it could be a bit dry), so I added a splash of buttermilk to the batter (maybe 1/4 cup), cooked it at just a lower temperature for a longer amount of time, then decorated it with pecans on top after it cooled.  I'm not a pecan pie fan, but even I found it to be delicious and my company raved about it.

Wow! This is hands down the best pecan pie I have ever tasted. 

It is so much better than those made with Karo syrup; you can really taste the butter.

To make it really awesome, try to use fresh new-crop pecans and use the regular (not deep dish) pie crust.

My pie was not the most visually appealing, but it was DELICIOUS!

Delicious. I love pecan pie, but usually find it sickening sweet.  This pie was wonderful!  Not too sweet and not gooey.  It also got a thumbs up from my husband's grandfather who is notoriously impossible to please.  Will be making this again for Christmas!

This pie was wonderful.  I doubled the pecans and used a deep pie crust because my family loves a whole lot of nuts.  I especially liked the texture of the pie.  Yummy!!

Great pie, but I used an 8-inch pie crust and not enough filling. Next time  I will use 1-1/2 times the filling as others stated and I also had to adjust the baking time.

In an effort to reduce calories and still treat myself to pecans, I used sugar substitutes and cut the butter in half.  The pie still turned out wonderfully and no one was the wiser.  This is a keeper!

Good pie, but as another stated, you really need 1 1/2 times the filling to fill one deep dish crust.  I, too, found that I needed to cook it at a lower temperature for a longer time.

I have not been a huge pecan pie fan, but my husband is and we both love this pie.  I took this pie for our Thanksgiving dinner and everyone raved about it.  I made several pies at several different times.  The first one I made as listed,but turned down the temp to 300 for the last 10 minutes.  The second one I made with the suggestion of 400 then turning it down for 50 minutes.  When I did that the center of my pie fell after taking it out of the oven.  I didn't take that to our Thanksgiving dinner thinking it was ruined but kept it for ourselves.  It wasn't ruined, it still tasted wonderful, but the presentation wasn't great.  This will be the only pecan pie I make in the future.  I always hated the corn syrup taste.  Thank you for a wonderful pie.

I bake often but have never made pecan pie (because I am not fond of it) but it was requested for Thanksgiving.  Used this recipe and it was a total hit. My oven is convection so followed the directions for 300 degrees after 15 mins at 400. Baked a total of 75 mins and it was a beautiful golden brown, not dark. I used 2 cups of pecans. Drizzled melted caramels (16 Kraft) plus 1 T heavy cream over top for design. Not difficult in the least and a sure thing!!

My boyfriend loves pecan pie so I decided to make him one for Thanksgiving..needless to say this pie was DELICIOUS! I even had a piece this morning for breakfast! it was so easy to whip up and the crust came out perfectly..I did take the other viewers advice to start out on one temp and then lower to 300 and I think that made it! I wish I would've had a camera it came out just lovely!

This Pecan Pie was excellent !  I was hesitant to make it because some reviewers did not like its presentation.  I was very pleased with the looks and the taste.  I made a 10 inch pie so I did make a recipe and a half of the filling.  The only changes I made to the recipe and a half was to only use 1/4 cup of white sugar and 2 cups of chopped pecans. It was really plenty sweet and was enjoyed by all. I will certainly make again.  Thanks for the excellent recipe.

I loved the flavor of this pie, and so did most people who tried it (except for my husband, he loves that icky karo-syrupy filling).  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of its appearance.  Contrary to other comments here, I thought the pie looked fine before it was cut (but I added some whole pecans to the top, per other suggestions).  Cutting it was the difficult part, it was just sort of a crumbly mess.  Maybe I should have chilled it first?  Fantastic recipe, though, I'll definitely make it again.  Thank you!

I work at the Firehouse and had to pull duty on Thanksgiving.  My Captain requested Pecan Pie. I have never made pecan pie before, used this recipe for the very first time. Oh My Goodness, it is amazing. These guys are the toughest food critics out there. Firemen regard themselves as lords of the kitchen. They were impressed and stuffed themselves. Use this recipe and follow the suggestion of oven temp variations and you will have a pie to die for. also, I drizzled ever so lightly caramel ice cream topping in a criss-cross pattern on the top. YUM !!! It was amazing, and I have lived in Tennessee where pecan pie is king!

best best ever !

VERY GOOD... Made today for Thanksgiving dinner...lots of raves.  Could have added more pecans (to taste, I guess) and I took the advice to bake for 10min at 350 then 50min at 300...perfect results!! I will definately make again!

Delicious...a great and nutty pie without all the ooey, gooeyness!
I increased the filling ingredients by 1/2 because I had a deep dish and it helped bring the filling level up more appropriately.  Everyone raved about this pecan pie.  I also decreased the white sugar amount (and will probably leave out next time) by 1/2 and kept the brown sugar the same, and it was really plenty sweet.  With diabetics in attendance, I was happy to offer this as an option to all of the other traditional holiday treats.  Thanks for the great recipe- I will definitely bake this again!!

I wish I could give this more stars. My family absolutely loved this version of pecan pie.  I made two of these pies for our Thanksgiving meal and only have one piece of pie left.  Wish I had had this recipe years ago.  Thank you so much for sharing it.

This was my first time making a pecan pie and I have to say, the recipe was super simple. Everyone that tried it said it was fantastic. It doesn't have a traditional pecan pie appearance. I added a few decorative whole pecans to the top before putting it in the oven. It definitely helped the overall appearance. I also found it a tiny bit runny. It was not as sickly sweet as the more traditional pie but that was a hit with those that tried it. Served with vanilla bean ice cream. Yummy.

Taste wise it was absolutely great. I give it 4 only because when I cut it, it would crumble and lose its form.

Fantastic!! I made one tonight for Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow. I had to try it and WOW it is GREAT!! It is nothing like a traditional Pecan Pie (which I still LOVE) but it is very yummy. Not sure why so many people said it isn't super sweet like traditionl with the syrup. I felt it was all most as sweet. Just like other reviewers I will say the pie was VERY unattrative. I think next time I make one I will take others advise and place some on the top so it looks more appealing. Will defiently make again.

Wow!  This pie is far superior to the versions made with Karo corn syrup.  Great nutty taste, delicate texture, sweet but not overly so.  My family loved it and now wants this version instead of others.  I used a deep dish pie crust and found that the recipe needs to be increased to 1.5 size in order to fill the crust.  Loved it!

This was my 1st time attempting pecan pie and it was wonderful.  It's such an easy recipe.  I'll be making this for Thanksgiving.  I used about 1.5 cups of pecans, but next time will probably do just 1 cup like the recipe calls for .

This pie was so good.  It didn't even last a whole day.  It was much lighter than the Karo Syrup version.  The only thing I would do to change this would be to increase the recipe by about 1/2 so that the pie fills to the top of the pie crust.

Amazing how this simple recipe resulted in a really great pecan pie. Got excellent feedback from everyone who had a piece. I'd probably recommend using a little less butter, but overall still a very good pecan pie!

This was my first attempt at making a Pecan Pie. The only change I made was to add about 1/4 cup more pecans. It turned out perfect. It is hands down the best Pecan Pie I have ever had. Thanks!!

Great Recipe!!! Loved that it was not overly sweet so it would be great with ice cream. Top layer had a crisp to it that i didnt like. Taste great though! I will make again. Dont be fooled by the looks of pie recipe is a winner!

I have never made a pie.... this one is my first and it won't be my last!!!!  I love this pie.  I did make some changes....  I put in a cup and 1/2 more nuts.  I also mixed the nuts half and half...  macadamia nuts and pecans... and it turned out superbly!!

This pie recipe, for taste alone, definitely deserves 5 stars. I prepared it exactly as directed. I followed one reviewer's suggestion of baking for 1 hour 15 minutes at 300 degrees and the crust browned nicely, not too brown.  My only reservation with this recipe would be the way it slices. It did not come out of the pan clean at all.....crumbled. Is there a trick in getting nice slices with this pie?  I would make this recipe again except for the "sloppy" slices. I did use a prepared pie crust....a Pet Ritz, but have never had a problem with them.

This recipe is AMAZING!! I made it for the first time as dessert at a party and everybody LOVED it! It was all gone before I knew it.  This pie tastes even better served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  YUMMMYY!! My husband keeps asking me to make more.

This pie was yummy!  Very full of flavor.  Definitely does need the extra 1/2 cup of pecans as suggested by others and more for the top to make it pretty.  I also used the 1/2 tsp. of molasses for added flavor.  This one's a keeper!

Very good pie. My father-in-law said it was a little dry, but I only had a 9.5" pie pan.. So what's the trick for cutting the pie? And why don't we like corn syrup? Just curious, I'm new to baking and this was my first pie.

Thia recipe turns out a wonderful pecan pie that everyone will love.  It is so easy and tastes great. I used 1 1/2 cups of medium pecan pieces and a some more for the top as others suggested and it looked great.  I did not have any light brown sugar in the pantry so I used all organic cane sugar, which is not white, but not quite light brown. It still tasted and looked good. I baked at 400 for 15 minutes and 45 minutes at 350. Thanks for the new and way improved version of pecan pie!

The best pecan pie! Not so sugary like the ones that call for Karo Syrup. I added extra vanilla and 1/2 tsp of molasses for a little more robust flavor. 

Yummy.

I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS AN EXTREMELY FORGIVING RECIPE- ONLY I CHANGED IS I ADDED 1 1/2 CUPS OF NUTS AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE WITH THE RECOMMENDED 1 CUP- I ADDED EXTRA VANILLA- I LOVE VANILLA!! AFTER I LOWERED MY TEMP I SET MY TIMER FOR 30 MINS TO CHECK THE PIE AND DOZED OFF ACROSS THE BED- I DID NOT HEAR THE ALARM- SO THE PIE WAS AT 350 FOR 1HR AND 15 MINS- INSTEAD OF THE 30 - 40 MINS- IT WAS STILL ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD- AND SURPRISINGLY VERY EDIBLE- I CAN IMAGINE IT HAS TO BE TOTALLY AWESOME WHEN YA COOK IT RIGHT-  TRYING AGAIN

I have never made pecan pie, because neither I nor my husband are big fans. I decided to make one tho for my sister-in-law's birthday, it being her favorite dessert. I picked this recipe based on reviews and the fact it doesn't use corn syrup. It came out wonderful, according to my sis-in-law, the pecan pie expert. I had a piece as well as my husband and we both loved it! I will be making this pie more and more and for the holidays! It's easy & delicious!

Yummy! I followed the recipe exactly and it was great. The only thing next time is I made double the filling - just to make the pie last longer, I think I ate alot more in one sitting than neeeded becuase it was that good. What I love about this recipe is that it does not use corn syrup therefore I was able to use the splenda baking blends and nonfat milk - which does not do much but still makes me feel a little bit better about eating it! :)

This is pretty good. Better than the one my mom brought home from Lancaster, PA. I did enter it in our local bake contest just to keep 4th of July funds circulating in my hometown, (they auction off the baked goods.)This pie didn't get a second glance. Oh well, I love it because it is super easy, I don't do anything difficult in the kitchen! Plus it is tasty enough to satisfy a pecan pie craving!

This was my first ever pecan pie, but I will certainly keep this recipe! The top of the pie didn't look like a normal pie, but tasted just as good. I liked the fact it didn't have any corn syrup.

WOW! I made this earlier today and yeppers, it definitely is a keeper. I used a chocolate graham cracker crust instead of the regular pie crust. My son and I dang near finished the whole thing. We told my hubby he'd better get some before we ate it all gone. He took just a small wee bite and said it was way too sweet. That's okay....More for Us! ;) We stopped when there was just one piece left. My son wants to take it for lunch tomorrow. Hmmm...this is going to be really hard, cuz it's like it beckons me to come and eat it.(mmurrhahaha)But, I'll behave and just make another one tomorrow. Thanks a bunch Elaine for sharing this wonderful "Sugar Rush Pecan Pie" recipe.

My dad's favorite pie is pecan so I thought I'd make it for his suprise 50th b-day party ...first words from him..."WOW" and "Killer".  This is a keeper!  I followed advice of another woman and cooked @ 300 for appx. 1 hour & 15 min.  The crust (store bought)wasn't burnt at all.

Everyone who tasted this pecan pie over Christmas said it was the best they've ever had and my husband who usually avoids pecan pie because it's too sweet thought this was just right. The big drawback? The presentation was not attractive. I'm willing to work on a better look; the flavor is worth it. Followed the recipe completely, except I didn't put the pecans in first. Maybe this is the trick a prettier pie.

Made with 1/2 recipe "Pie Crust III" from this site - no changes to either, and LOVE this.  Am not a pecan pie lover normally, but this was perfect amount of sweet and texture was great!  Did the 10 min @ 400 and 45 @ 300 and came out perfectly.

This was delicious. Coming from Australia we dont use corn syrup at all and so this recipe suited our tastes very well. I also made this into mini pies and cooked it at 150C for about 40minutes. I only used one egg as I only had one in the fridge, great recipe. Thanks

This was excellent! I've made many pecan pies and this was the best. Thanks so much for recipe. Didn't seem so overly sweet which was a great change.

Excellent recipe!  I made mini pies using a ready-made crust.  Used a 3" cookie cutter and placed the mini pie crusts into the mini muffin tin.  With 3, 9" ready-made pice crusts, this recipe makes about 37 mini pies.  They were devoured within minutes.

Made for Christmas Eve dinner for my family and husband...who loves the 'regular' pecan pie and was skeptical of this - until he tasted it!  We all loved this one and I won't be making pecan pie with corn syrup again!

Great Recipe! I made miniature pies, and pecan pie bars using this recipe. I wasn't sure about the brown sugar vs. corn syrup, but was pleasantly surprised! Definitely a keeper.

I found it a little overly sweet, but good just the same. A few of my guy friends ate all but one slice in about 30min. I added 3/4 cup extra pecans.

Best Pecan Pie EVER! Very easy prep. The first time I made it i burnt the h*ll out of it and it was STILL so good that it was completely gone the next morning. My family  loves this recipe. I have made it the regular way and with splenda and its great both ways.

THE BEST pecan pie I have ever had!! The texture is perfect and it looked nothing like the picture here- it looked like regular pecan pie. Mine was done about 10 min sooner than called for and I did add a few more nuts too. I made it for Thanksgiving and now Im making another one just for us!! This could be dangerous!!

I made this pie with pecans my son and I gathered together.  Paired with the Best Ever Pie Crust recipe on this site, you can't imagine a better tasting pecan pie.  I let it bake a little longer because I was not sure how to tell when this one was done.  The knife never came out totally clean, but it was done.  The extra time made the pecans on top of the pie nice and crunchy.  Yum-O

I LOVE this pecan pie recipe!! Usually, I notice that pecan pies are way too gooey, but this one is the best one I have ever tried! It only takes 5 minutes to whip up and it actually takes about 10 minutes longer than the recipe suggests to cook. If you are buying the crust, make sure it is a high quality one. I promise this will be a family favorite!

I tried this and followed the directions pretty much exactly. I did chop the pecans too finely, though, as my mini-chopper tends to overdo the nut chopping. Nevertheless, everyone in my family loved it. I will make this again for sure. I recommend it!!

My family absolutely loves this recipe. My dad is a huge pecan pie lover and he says this is the best he has ever had. Even those who don't usually like pecan pie love this. I do find though that it takes longer to cook than what is posted on recipe. It may be because I usually cook more than one at a time.

This is the first time I have EVER liked pecan pie. I made it in addition to pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving because my husband doesn't like pumpkin and everyone went crazy for it! Who knew it was the goopy corn syrup that was ruining pecan pie all this time?! This will be a regular at all my holiday meals from now on.

Great pie! I like how it isn't sticky like the maple syrup versions I used to have.

This was the best pecan pie I have ever tasted.  Traditional pecan pie has nothing on this recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was great! I was very happy with the end result of the pie not being too gooey and sticky and the taste was delicious. I actually added an additional 1/2 cup of pecans. My husband, who is a huge pecan pie fan also loved it and mentioned it each time he took a bite.

This pie was easy and delicious. I made it for Thanksgiving.  I also made the original pecan pie with the corn syrup.  This pie was all gone before the other one.

I usually don't make pecan pie but I had to try this one and I loved it.  I think it has a better flavor and texture than the corn syrup variety. One reviewer mentioned a grainy texture so I made sure it was well mixed and that was not a problem. As another reviewer mentioned I also added nuts to the top for presentation. It came out wonderful. Great recipe

Don't expect this to be like a standard pecan pie. Its not as custard-like or eggy. It forms a very crusty top. I like the idea of not having to use corn syrup, so next time I'll try adding another egg.

This is one of the pies I made for Thanksgiving and it was well received. I was in a bit of a hurry when I made it, so used the beater to mix all and only stirred in the pecans. It had kind of a caramel taste/texture that I really enjoyed. Extra points for not having the leftover corn syrup bottle in the way in the refrigerator!

I did not like this at all.  The filling was not enough, so I doubled the recipe.  I guess I just like the old karo syrup way of making it after all.
