This was really good.  Previous reviewer, how can you substitute cheddar cheese for cheese sauce and then complain it was not creamy??  That's not the same thing at all.  Of course that doesn't work.

I made it just like the recipe except I didn't have cheese whiz so i used cheddar cheese. Not creamy at all and it might have been the generic soup i used but I did not care for it.

This was a good starter recipe.  There was something missing I cant put my finger on yet, but it was bland.  My guests and kids loved it but all agreed it needed something more.  The only change I made was to use a red pepper instead of green.  The chicken pulled apart easily and people asked for more.  I will make this again and maybe add some cayenne pepper or hot sauce to give it a kick.

This was a good easy recipe. I used montery jack cheese in lieu of mozzerella and it was tasty. I only had to cook for 7 hours on low and it was cooked completely. Definitely had to add corn starch at the end of cooking which thickened the sauce and it thickened as it cooled. Would definitely make again makes a good rainy day slow cooker recipe with a lot of taste!

Did not have a lot of flavor was not creamy enough. My kids did not like it. It was a miss in my household.

I used Campbell's Broccoli Cheese Soup instead of mushroom soup to add a more cheesy flavor especially since I did not have Cheese Whiz. I also added a bit of sour cream to add to the creaminess as well. Considered using cream cheese...may try another time. I also used shredded colby jack cheese instead of mozzarella: I thought the flavor would meld better with the broccoli cheese soup. All in all my husband loved it (despite the overall yellow hue of the dish) and had seconds...as did I!

I loved this! Made a few substitutions: cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom, and a smidge of velveeta instead of spray cheese. I also fixed my chicken breasts, since I only had 2. Its  a great comfort food dish!

As is I don’t think it would have enough flavor but it’s a great starter recipe!  Used a jar of Queso dip and added Parmesan cheese along with some hot sauce and season salt and it was delicious!  Definitely a keeper and you can modify to your taste very easily.

It was okay! I added peas & diced green peppers to it and a lot of ground black pepper after it cooked.

It was okay. Edible but not impressive. Potatoes cooked well. Not much flavor. Might have been better with a different condensed soup like cheese soup. Honestly it's not a recipe I plan to use again.
