These are great! Yes, a little time consuming but not bad. I boiled the onions closer to 30 minutes since I was using large onions. I also used purple onions because I like the sweetnes to them. One thing I did to help separate the layers is run a toothpick along the edges of the top and bottom of the onion. The onion stayed together just fine when I parted the layers. I used only 2 onions and used all the layers I could out of them and got about 4 large stuffed ones and 5 or 6 smaller ones. I then topped them off with some shredded mozarella before putting into the oven. Yum! I also used a whole pound of the sausage. These will surely be made at my house again!

I used slices of fresh bread instead of day old bread, and the first time I made this I forgot to add the egg, but it still turned out wonderful.  I took it to a crowded party And was asked for the recipe by at least 7 different people one of which was a caterer who said they were one of the best things she's ever eaten.  I'd like to try this recipe with red and green peppers or inside a tomato next time.  I've only gotten compliments on this recipe, even a friend of mine who is usually extremely picky & doesn't like to try new things enjoyed them.   A little time consuming, but totally worth it.  I highly recommend!

I tried this recipe with vegetarian crumbles and it came out just awful. I can't really blame the recipe for that because with sausage it might be fantastic. Still, found the seasoning a little bland.

Soo Good!  I substituted the ground beef, and the pork sausage for ground turkey, and hot turkey sausages.  Also, I actually didn't boil the onions, and mine all split, so I folded them, stuffed them and then stuck a toothpick in them.  I then baked them in the oven, and they turned out perfectly!  They were a huge hit!  I would use this stuffing to make meatballs, or meatloaf!  Thanks!

We thought these were very good.  I have to admit I decreased the recipe by half and then approximated the ingredient amounts. I also added ¼ cup of mozzarella cheese to the mixture and topped it with a little mozzarella cheese the last ten minutes of baking.   In addition, I took a short cut and cut the onions in half and microwaved them in a casserole dish with a little water for five minutes.   As I’m making this, I kept looking for the garlic and kept thinking I should add some anyway.  I didn’t, but it was still very good, but next time I would definitely add some garlic.  This dish is a little different from our usual fare and we all enjoyed it.

Delicious!  Only change I made was,  I didn't use near the amount of spinach it called for, and added mushrooms. This is a keeper!

This is exceptionally good! The stuffing was great and I would use it to stuff other things, maybe peppers or even tomatoes.  I used the inside of the onions as a simple side by slicing them up and throwing in some butter, salt and pepper.  My boyfriend and his mom loved these too- she even aasked me for the recipe and took the leftovers home with her!!!

This is UNBELIEVEABLE!!!  Sooooo good!!!  I replaced the bread with 1 and 1/2 cups of old-fashioned oats, run through the food processor (for some extra nutrition) and doubled the nutmeg.  The 1st layer of onion tore some when I was removing it, but the 2nd and 3rd layers came off easily.  It actually made 11 onions, so now we'll have left-overs for lunch tomorrow!  We all loved this.  I think, next time, I'll use fresh parmesan cheese.

wow!!  def tricky to separate those onions,  (hence "carefully").  turned out great though!!  i did leave out the spinach and bread.  instead i chopped some orange bell peppers and some of the remaining onion to put that in the mixture.  then when they were done in the oven i placed a piece of yellow american cheese on the tops.  yummy!!  i def will be making these again!!

This is such a neat idea ! I used textured veg. protein instead of meat and veggie sausage. Turned out very well. Even though the onions may have cracks, it still looks cool!

I had a little difficulty separating the onions without tearing, but they were real good!  I chopped the insides of the onions and added them to the meat mixture as well as some minced garlic.

Used fresh spinach and bread crumbs... also added corn, green & red peppers. My husband LOVED it, especially with the HOT sausage beef blend. It was a Home Run!
