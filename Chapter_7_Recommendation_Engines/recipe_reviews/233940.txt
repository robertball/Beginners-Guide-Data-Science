This had way too much cinnamon for me, but I guess that's what the recipe writer meant by "tangy."  I ended up adding more vinegar to mask some of the cinnamon flavor, and moving forward I would either omit it completely or reduce it by at least half.  But admittedly, that's a personal taste preference.

I made this recipe exactly as written. My family LOVED it! What a nice change to the same ol' thing. I was asked to make this for a big family gathering next time and will.  It is so easy and delicious. :)

While on the road in NC  I stopped at a coffee shop for breakfast and was served a sweet potato biscuit with a warm purple slaw and a hard poached egg on it....fantastical! I am sure this is close and it's good in the pan. Will make again!

I don't normally take the time to write reviews but this recipe was too good to pass up! I saw a cooking show that featured a warm red cabbage salad and immediately came to allrecipes to find a recipe, knowing it would be good, and this one was excellent. So good that we have decided to add it to our Thanksgiving feast. The only change I made was to omit the apple. I am sure it would be just as good with the apple, I just didn't fancy it. Thanks for sharing it!

Very good for a cool night. We just added more apple cider vinegar as we like it with more tangy. Super easy and I will be repeating it often. Thanks for the recipe!
