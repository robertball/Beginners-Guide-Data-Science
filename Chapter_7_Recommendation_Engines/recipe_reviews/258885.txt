This was delicious! The 1/2 of a small red chile pepper is vague. I didn't know what kind of red chile but it turns out all I could find fresh that was red was a jalapeno. Because jalapeno's are typically mild in the heat department for us, I used the entire pepper and also left the seeds in. So while I'm not sure I made this as intended, it still came out excellent!
