I  haven't found "rock candy syrup" just regular simple syrup.  Also, I wish I knew the difference bet. "dash" & "3-4 drops" as this other recipe cautions you about measuring the Orange Flower H20 very precisely:  I used to make these by blenderfuls 4 Sun. brunch too!  Heck, the 2 bartenders got drunk perfecting the  recipe b4 all the guests arrrived!    The good old daze!

I remember the good ol'days when I used to have these every Sunday for brunch.  I didn't have all the ingredients on hand so used gin, italian sweet cream coffee creamer, orange juice, powdered sugar and crushed ice.  I ran it through the blender and it tasted as great as I remembered!  YUMMY!!
