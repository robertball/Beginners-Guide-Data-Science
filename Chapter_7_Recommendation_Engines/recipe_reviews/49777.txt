This tastes very good & refreshing.  I used strawberry instead of raspberry because that's what I had.  Even if you aren't crazy about rhubarb you will probably like this.

This is my favorite jello salad of all time.  Even people who don't like rhubarb like this.

I thought this was very good!  It was easy to make too.  I peeled the apples and sliced them very thinly.  It would be a pretty side dish for a holiday dinner.  And I will double the recipe next time because it's that good!

I used Strawberry instead of raspberry.  Turned out awesome.  I keep trying to get a picture up of this dessert (why wouldn't they put one up?), but it never lasts long enough to take one! I will have to take a picture when it's in the fridge next time.

WOW!  This salad is fantastic! An interesting combination of sweet/ tart & a delicious way to cool down during the summer heat.  I used strawberry jello & pecans (what I had on hand), (though strawberry/rhubarb is one of my favorite combinations). Excellent use for the rhubarb surplus.  Thanks CYNSABL for sharing a great recipe!

I have a patch of Rhubarb growing by the barn and needed to find easy recipes to use it up. I'm not familiar with rhubarb but it's beginning to become a favorite. This recipe keeps that slight tart taste but is still sweet enough to make you want to dive in. It was simple to make. I used strawberry jello, delicious. I'm going to use the little bit of left over sauce to top some ice cream. Great recipe!

A wonderful way to use rhubarb.  I am diabetic so I used a sugar substitute and sugar-free gelatin.  It was delicious!

LOVED IT!!!  I made this for mothers day dinner and everyone who ate it liked it.  I will definitely make this again and again.  I used sugar free jello, so I let my daughter eat the rest of it for breakfast!  It has lots of fruit and nuts in it so why not!  It's better than powdered donuts!

The taste was excellent! I my market doesn't sell Jell-o in 3 oz anymore so I used the 8 oz but the consistency was off. I hope this helps those of you w/ 8oz boxes...beware.

I made this according to recipe and our family rated it a five. Made it a five plus the second time around by dividing a 6 oz jello package and making a 3 oz jello  jell first and then adding this recipe as a topper.

This was a fabulous salad that can be used as a desert as well.  I love both rhubarb and raspberry so it is a great combo for me.  I made a topping of whipped cream cheese and powdered sugar to spread on top of the entire gelatin which makes a great Christmas or Valentines day salad. But as Yvonne said in her review it's a great cool down for the summer as well!!!

love rhubarb and this is a tasty dessert salad. I made this without the nuts because while I love nuts, some of my kids don't. It was very good.I put the diced apples in half of my gelatin mixture and put it in the frig to set up. The other half of the gelatin I added some cream cheese and used an immersion blender to fully incorporate the cream cheese into the gelatin. This I left sit on the counter until the gelatin was half set up in the frig. At that time I poured the rhubarb/cream cheese mixture over the gelatin and returned it all to set up in the frig. Next time I am going to used crushed pineapple instead of the apple as that is what they use on the salad bar of am Amish restaurant that I often go to.

Loved it! Of course, as a rhubarb lover, what's not to love? I doubled the recipe and used one strawberry jello and one black cherry jello since that is what I had on hand. Will use this recipe again.

Amazing! I only had strawberry jello on hand but it was still great! I also added a cream cheese/sour cream topping which turned it into a fantastic dessert.

Yummy and refreshing!! - I found this recipe here several years ago and make this salad every spring, at least once if not more!  I have used both strawberry and raspberry jello with equally good results. I make it exactly as written - I chop the apple in my food processor so the chunks are fairly small.  Great standby recipe for me!

Faceless Frenzy - November 2013 - Loved this recipe!!  I love rhubarb and this was a really nice change using it.  I used a sugar-free gelatin and omitted the nuts, knowing that my son would not eat it with the nuts.  This had a nice tang, just the way I like my rhubarb.  The apples were a nice addition and the next time I will add the nuts.  This recipe has been sitting "faceless" since May 2003, glad I was able to give it a face!
