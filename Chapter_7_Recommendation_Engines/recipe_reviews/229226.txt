Couple recommendations.  First, try to make your crescent dough as square as possible, as that will help when you fold it into a triangle.  I would suggest using the peanut butter sparingly, as it can easily overpower the delicate flavor of the pear and even the sharpness of the cheddar.  Next time, I’m going to try substituting TJ’s cookie butter for the peanut butter.  I sprinkled some cinnamon-sugar on the top after they came out of the oven, and that added a little sweetness.  Easy to make, and it was enjoyed for a lazy Saturday breakfast.

I really wanted to try these to have something other than traditional sandwiches to put in my kids lunches... I used the AR magazine "from our kitchen" suggestions. I fed them to my three kids plus two of their friends (ages 6, 8, 7, 8, 9)... they ate them up but all complained it was too much peanut butter and cinnamon was too strong. The pockets were good, and I will try them again... however here are some changes I will try: a little less PB, less cinnamon and possibly mix with just a bit of sugar, more cheddar in each pouch. I also wonder if it could be better with pie crust? I guess that would be making it less healthy, though!

I like all of the suggestions already submitted.  Personally, I used Honey Butter crescent rolls, because that is what I had on hand.  Ate the first one while warm.  Good but could use a little more sweetness.  The next night, I warmed a roll in the microwave.  Then topped with 1 scoop of Vanilla Sea Salt Caramel ice cream.  Wonderful!  Would make again incorporating the suggestions given.

Pretty good,  I did follow the advice of some of the other reviews and reduced the peanut butter to approx 1/4 tsp in each pocket, I also added extra cheese and used a whole pear (1.4. in each pocket) and a little sprinkle of sugar over the top before baking, I didn't use any cinnamon.
Overall it was ok - my kids liked it but weren't overly excited about it - I don't actually like pear so will probably make it again but with apple instead.
I will probably try it with other fillings too - I love the little squares of pastry - super super easy if you are in a rush but like another reviewer suggested I may try making it with my own pie crust recipe.
Great base idea though!

I substituted hazelnut spread for the peanut butter and Gouda for the cheddar, making it more of a breakfast dish. It turned out amazing!

I've been wanting to try these for a while and was quite please with the result.  If you put in the right amount of peanut butter it comes out good.  Also make sure to put in plenty of cinnamon.  A relative suggested using honey instead of peanut butter and cheese, but honestly I thought the cheese (although hard to taste) was a good addition.  Overall, I would recommend it.
