Instead of almond milk, I used lowfat milk. I also skipped the ice cubes and cut the brown sugar back to a couple tablespoons. Tasty smoothie--the kids and I enjoyed it a lot. Next time, I may just omit the banana and increase the pumpkin.

I loved this. It really does taste like pumpkin pie. I omitted the wheat germ only because I did not have any. Both my pumpkin and banana were frozen so I left out the ice. The only down side I could find was that I scaled the recipe down to 1 serving and it was very small. Next time I'll cut the recipe in half and make 1 serving out of it.

This tasted pretty good or a little closer to a pumpkin pie flavor than other smoothies I have had with the same flavor. I cut the recipe in half and it made 2 good sized servings. Originally, I planned to follow the recipe and cut the brown sugar in half but realized it badly needed the full amount of brown sugar. I bought a seasonal box of crackers that had some almost homemade tasting honey graham crackers. I used those. Whipped cream and honey graham crackers were a good compliment. I just wouldn't put this smoothie in regular rotation due to the added sugar, but was different to try. ty

Very good recipe. Used pureed butternut squash and mixed spice as hard to get some of the ingredients here. Still worked quite well

I loved this recipe! The only thing I think it needed 1/2 of a banana instead of a whole banana.
