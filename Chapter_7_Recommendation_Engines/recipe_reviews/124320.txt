These muffins are awesome!  I used 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of rolled oats, 2 cups of sweetened chunky applesauce, 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown and added 1/2 cup of shredded carrot along with the raisins.  I altered the spices a bit: 1 tbsp. of cinnamon, 2 tsp. of cinnamon, 2 tsp. of nutmeg, 1/2 tsp. of allspice, 1/4 tsp. of cloves. I used an over sized muffin tin and got a dozen huge muffins.  I topped them with a mixture of cinnamon sugar and they not only smelled good but tasted great!

With an abundance of homemade applesauce that I made and froze this fall, I have been looking for recipes to use it up!  I will keep making these!  I did make a few changes to make them healthier-I halved the recipe...I replaced one cup of flour with 1/4 cup wheat germ and 3/4 cup oats.  I subbed the butter for fat free sour cream and I cut the sugar amount in half.  I also added about 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts!  I got 12 big and yummy, moist and delicous muffins!!!

These are really wonderful. I omitted the raisens, hubby and son hate them. I cut the recipe in half and added a pinch of cloves and ginger, just because I like them in any "spice" type dish. These muffins were great, and the whole family loved them. I also used half whole-wheat flour just to make them a bit healthier. Wonderful recipe.

I cut this recipe back by half to get 12 muffins. I used vegetable oil in place of the butter and I halved the amount of vegetable oil and used more unsweetened applesauce. For more texture, I threw in one large shredded Granny Smith apple. My muffins were done baking at 22 minutes as they were a little on the larger side. Very nice muffin--chewy, moist and very flavorful.

Good with a few changes- added cloves and nutmeg in addition to the allspice and cinnamon. Also added about a cup of shredded apple. Brushed the tops of the muffins (once baked) with a little butter, then sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top.

At first I thought that there would be too much allspice and cinnamon -- one tablespoon of each sounded like an awful lot -- but it was just perfect.  I used chunky applesauce and the muffins were so moist and delicious.

My family loved these! My 4 year old could not get enough of them. I followed some of the others suggestions, I used a cup of rolled oats for a cup of the flour. I used only 1 cup of white sugar, and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also stired in a 1/2 cup of chopped apple. Then I chopped some more apple and sprinkled them on top just before baking.  I am going to be sending these wonderful muffins to my son's preschool for snack next week! I am sure all the kids will love them as much as he did. Thank-you so much for sharing!

Theses were pretty good, not overly sweet, so I'm glad I sprinkled a little brown sugar over the top before baking. I would make these again.

Yesterday I told my husband that I found a great "Cinnamon-Raisin Muffin" recipe (his favorite kind).  Then I made some changes to this recipe, as follows: 1 1/4 c white flour, 1 1/4 c whole wheat, 1 c rolled oats, 1/2 c wheat germ, 1 1/2 c butter with 2 1/2 c applesauce and 1 1/2 c raisins (soaked in hot water to plump them up), 1 c brown sugar, 1/2 c white sugar...everything else I left the same.  I topped with a little brown sugar, too.  He LOVED it!!!!  He usually just picks at the recipes from this site because I'm always trying to make them healthy, so this time I didn't say anything and he has NO idea that he's eating something that is actually somewhat good for him!  I'm still giggling over it! ** Next time I will put in 2 c of raisins; even with the extra 1/2 c it didn't seem like there were that many.**

Great muffins.  I substituted 2C of white flour with 1.5C wheat flour and 0.5C oat bran. These were absolutely delicious even without the subs!

I was looking for a simple but flavorful muffin for breakfast/snacks, and this recipe fit the bill! I made this recipe exactly as written since I don't like to review recipes unless I make THE recipe. Thanks for a great recipe! Will definitely make again.

My extremely picky granddaughters who won't eat anything loved these.  They were very generous in size and very moist.  I enjoyed the balance of flavours and I thought the amount of raisins was just right.  The only things I did differently were to plump the raisins and to add the raisins to the dry ingredients before adding the applesauce mixture to ensure that the raisins don't all fall to the bottom of the muffins.  I will be making these again soon.

Made this with a few changes.  My son wanted chocolate chip muffins, but I had applesauce to use up so I made these, with changes.  I left out the cinnamon, allspice and raisins.  I only had 2 cups of all-purpose flour, so I used 2 cups AP and 2 cups WW.  It was pretty sweet, so if I make it again I will leave out some sugar.  I ended up with 24 muffins and extra batter, so I used the extra batter to make a small loaf also.

Just the right texture. My son made these and they turned out great. He didn't use the raisins so they were a smooth perfectly sweet but not too sweet muffin.

My husband and son LOVE these!  Not overly sweet, but in a good way.  I have added golden raisins and chopped apples to different batches with much success.  I think if you use the raisins or apples, 1 cup is not enough--I always add two.  Since the muffin isn't that sweet, you need more fruit to compensate--but that's just my preference.  Great with butter or margarine, and super simple to make!

Really good recipe!  This recipe makes a big batch, so be ready!  I got 30 muffins out of it.  I'm sure they'll all get eaten because they are soft, moist, and sweet - but not too sweet. 
I added extra raisins (one cup is a bit stingy if you are someone who likes them) and substituted butter flavored shortening for the butter/margarine because that's what I had on hand, and I was really pleased.  
Next time I make it I'm going to try adding carrots and oats or wheat flour as other reviewers have suggested.  It may make for a better, richer texture.  Maybe.

Great muffins.  I usually hate when people leave reviews and then list all the changes they made, but I'll be guilty of the same today.  I substituted whole wheat flour for 1 1/2 cups of all purpose and 1/2 cup barley flakes for another 1/2 cup flour.  I added an extra tsp. cinnamon, and 3/4 tsp ginger.  I also cut the sugar in half.  They were delicious!

Perfect! I love these. Everyone at preschool loved them. Yeah! The only thing I did different is added 1 cup of oats, 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose. I also made them into mini-muffins and baking time was 15 mins spot on. Thank you for such a easy and wonderful snack!

WOW - These muffins were so moist and delicious. Followed recipe, absolutely no need to change anything. Shared with my neighbor and of course she wanted the recipe. Only added raisins to 1/2 as my husband doesn't care for them.

My family really loves muffins and they absolutely raved about this one.  I followed the recipe as is except I did omit the brown sugar on top and we didn't miss it.  These make a good breakfast or snack for my busy college son who has Crohn's disease. And my husband gave it the ultimate compliment..."This tastes just life something we'd get in Gatlinburg, it's that good!"  Thanks for the recipe!

They turned out like charcoal on the bottom even though I did them the minimum time listed. Also the mix seemed quite dry, not like a typical muffin mix.

Absolutely delicious!  I halved the recipe and the only change I made was the addition of a mixture of sugar, cinnamon, and chopped nuts sprinkled on the tops.  Baked for 20 minutes.  Definitely a "keeper".

These are delicious! I used golden raisins, all I had, and Savory baking spice - which made the muffins special. It is a wonderful blend of Saigon and Indonesian cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, allspice and ginger. Also dipped them in melted butter, cinnamon and sugar after they were done. This recipe goes in my file!

These were excellent!!!  The only change I made was to add 1 cup oats in place of 1 of the cups of flour.  I also added about 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and sprinkled a bit of brown sugar on top of each one prior to cooking.  This made 20 regular sized muffins for me.  The kids loved them and so did I!  Delicious!!

Delicious! Like most, I made a few tweaks in the recipe. I used 1/2 all-purpose and 1/2 wheat flour, which I find adds more flavor as well as nutrition. I cut back the sugar a bit and think it could comfortably go down lower (especially if you use sweetened applesauce). Chunky applesauce gave them great texture with some little apple pieces. I used a combo of raisins, craisins and pecan chips instead of just raisins. Sooo good and adds a nice texture.

These muffins were moist, delicious, and fairly easy.  With a few alterations, they are perfect!  Here's what  I did: 4 cups white flour, 2 tbsp ground cinnaomon, 3 tsp baking soda (makes the muffins even more fluffy), 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup cane sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 eggs, 2 1/2 cups applesauce, 2 tbsp vanilla, 1 1/2 cups raisins, & 1 1/2 tsp ground cloves.  Mixed together and baked for 25 min these are so, so, so good!! Best eaten warm (I heated up for 30 seconds in the microwave).  I also made up a batch substituting 3/4 cup honey for the 1 cup sugars and upped the applesauce to 3 cups - still turned out yummy and a great breakfast or snack food!  I recommend you try these!  Oh and the house smelled insanely wonderful while I was baking the muffins.  Like fall, Thanksgiving, happiness.. :)

Pretty good muffins.  I used 2 cups AP flour and 2 cups whole wheat.  I also sprinkled the tops with a little turbinado sugar.  But I was surprised that they don't have a really strong apple taste in spite of using 2 cups of chunky homemade applesauce.  Might be the nutty whole wheat that takes away from it, but I wanted it to have some whole grain, so I wouldn't change that.

Loved this recipe! Came in handy when I didn't have milk but wanted to make muffins.  I followed everything in the recipe except I used chopped dates instead of raisins.  Very tasty and moist with dates.  Also made one pan of mini muffins....bake only 11 minutes.

Not half bad for an applesauce muffin.  I didn't think the flavor was wonderful, but OK.  It was a little bland, so you could think about revisions to add a little flavor.

WONDERFUL recipe!  My family LOVES these.  I have two little boys and it is fun to make mini muffins with them - you only need to cut the time by about 5 minutes.

We loved these muffins!  I don't have allspice on hand so I used a mix of fresh ginger, cloves and nutmeg.  I always replace 1/3 of the white flour with whole wheat flour.  I had to use maple extract because we were out of vanilla.  Very good!

These were really, really good!!  I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and could have probably gotten away with 1/2.  I used whole wheat flour for half of the full amount.  I think next time just to be a little bit healthier, I would cut the butter in half as well.  They are pretty buttery as is.

I made a few subs...used pearsauce and currents instead of applesauce and raisens. I added .5 t of nutmeg, too, since I used the pearsauce. Sooo good! Oh, I also halved the sugar and they were still plenty sweet.

I made 1/2 of the recipe with a few changes and it was great- I was able to overfill 24 mini muffins.

Instead of 1 C sugar, I used 1/4 white sugar, 1/4 brown sugar, 5 packets stevia, 2 2/3 T agave (I know this is ridiculous but I was playing around and I honestly cant taste a difference)

Instead of just raisons, I added an overflowing cup of raisons, cranberries, and chopped apricots. I also added ~ 1/4 C of chopped pecans.

I also added a bit of nutmeg and a pinch of sea salt.

Very yummy and moist!  I used craisins rather than raisins, and I also sprinkled brown sugar to the tops before cooking. (I suggest pushing the brown sugar down into the batter so it doesn't crumble off when they're done.)  Don't overfill the muffin cups or you'll destroy the muffins trying to get them out of the pan... they are very soft.  Delicious!

I make muffins almost every weekend for my family for breakfast during the week, school lunches, and snacks, and am always looking for new recipes.  I had some unsweetened applesauce with mixed berry combo that I wanted to use up.  I also used brown sugar in place of white, and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg in this recipe.  The muffins smelled wonderful, and taste great!  They are moist, with lots of apple flavour!  Going to add this recipe to my file!  Everyone likes them, including my toddler and husband!

I made these for our 4-H bake sale and they were great. I use PamperdChef Cinnamon Plus when a recipe calls for cinnamon and all spice instead. I also made a dutch apple type topping and sprinkled on before I baked. Used jumbo muffin pans so it made 12. Really great sold out the 1st day and had to make more for 2nd day. Will definatlly make again

I took some other's advise and used 2 C white flour, 1 C wheat flour and 1 C oatmeal in place of the 4 C flour. Made no other changes. Muffins were very dark from all the cinnamon so I was afraid appearance would deter my family from eating them, but they loved them. May use a chunky appleasauce next time or add a little fresh apple. The apple flavor was a little lost with all the cinnamon, but still very yummy!

1st time made as written except added  1/2c oats and 1/2c. wheat germ. I found them to be a little sweet/fatty for breakfast for the kids so this time I did 1/2 the sugar(1/4cbrown and 1/4cwhite) and reduced the butter to 1/2c. added a bit more apple sauce, some nutmeg tasted great. not a huge diff in taste and less fat without the butter.

So good.  Just what I was hoping for.  I had already started another recipe where you soak oats in milk, so I incorporated them here.  I used 3 1/2 cups flour, and then 1 cup oats soaked in 1 cup milk.  I blended the soaked oats and milk with the butter and sugar, and they blended into a great creamy texture.  I was worried the batter would be too "wet," but I followed all of the other proportions, and they turned out so delicious.  Definitely making them again.

The BF specifically asked for muffins this week for breakfast, and, being low on funds in order to go and buy ingredients, I went searching through the house for something to make this with.  Our TJ's applesauce had gone bad, but lo and behold, a bag of the homemade 'sauce from last year's bumper crop was hanging out in the back of the freezer.  I substituted cranberries for the raisins and made half of the batter in mini cupcake tins and the other half in pint canning jars.  Om nom nom!

Made a half batch, deleted the raisins,  and then made them into mini muffins.  My kids loved these as an after school snack. They are moist and have just the right spice balance.  Thanks!

These muffins are AMAZING.  They are very cake like, and scrumptious. i did everything that the recipe called for except three things.  1. I did not have baking soda, but instead, baking powder, and I added double the amount it called for, and they still turned out great. 2. I didn't have raisins, so I put craisins in the batter, and they really added a nice flavor to them. 3. I did not have allspice, so I added nutmeg, as the recipe called for.  It was a little too potent at first, but after letting the muffins sit for a little while, the entire recipe turned out amazing.  EVERYONE (even the picky kids a few houses down) LOVES THEM!

Wonderful!  These just came out of the oven and the smell while they were baking was heavenly.  The texture is perfect--light and moist.  The spice mixture is just right.  I followed the recipe as written except I left out the raisins because our family doesn't care for them.  Next time I make them I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks!

This was a great base recipe, and I love that you can make it with pantry staples!  I will add some additional spice next time since the muffins were a little on the bland side for me.  I also added pecans, white chocolate chips and 2 T. molasses and cut down on the white sugar by 1/2 cup. Yum!

Delicous!  I halved the recipe and got 8 giant muffins out of it.  I made some changes to make it a bit healthier.  I changed the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup and sprinkled a bit of brown sugar on top.  I also subbed in 1 c of wheat flour for one cup of the white flour.  I kept the 1tbsp of vanilla even though i halved the recipe.  I also added in some extra cinnamon and wheat germ.  I'm sure these are great as-is but I've got to sneak in the healthy when I can when cooking for my kids.  :)

I would give it 4.5 stars... the muffins turned out well, very tasty, moist, and dense. I subbed 1c oats in place of flour, 1c brown sugar in place of white, and added about a cup of diced apple. I think that about half the oats, and twice as much apple will make this almost perfect. Sprinkle of brown sugar on top prior to cooking did give it a lovely crunch... and this recipe made 24 muffin-cup sized muffins (when filled to 2/3 as directed), next time I'll halve it, and overflow the cups to make 8ish large muffins.

Just made these with my own applesauce and a gluten-free baking mix and they came out brilliantly! Light and fluffy, not too sweet. Changes: I made only a half batch and it made 14 muffins. I then used slightly less than half of the allspice and cinnamon - just personal preference.

Yummy!  I halved the recipe (didn't need 2 dozen muffins), omitted raisins and added a dash of nutmeg and cloves... I think they'd also taste great with walnuts added.

Very good muffins but I expected more apple flavor to come through.  I will make again and think I will try adding 1 grated apple to the ingredients.  Thanks for a keeper Peggy.

My family absolutely loved these muffins.  I used unsweetened applesauce (which for our family made them just sweet enough) and I used 21/2 cups applesauce instead of 2 cups which made them moist.  also I did not have ground allspice, I had either whole allspice or pumpkin allspice, so I used the pumpkin allspice.  This recipe is the best and so easy to use.  I hardly ever make things from scratch nor do I cook, my husband does al ot of the cooking.  Cooking is just not the thing I love to do, but this was so easy to follow and to add to.  Got to try it!

Absolutely delicious. Perfect for my 14-month-old. I halved the recipe and made mini muffins. I used 1/2 spelt, 1/2 white, and 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white. VERY VERY moist!!

I had 4 stars on this recipe and I am changing it to 5 because I added leftover streusel that I had from To Die For Blueberry Muffins from this site.  My one year old wasn't a fan of the allspice in the recipe, so I will probably reduce it or leave it out next time I make these.

These came out quite good.  I halved the recipe for one dozen muffins, and my three kids ate them all in less than 24 hours.  I did make some small changes.  I used 1 1/2 cups white flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat.  I also used half white sugar and half brown.  I cut back slightly on the spices because I used Spiced Slow Cooker Applesauce from this site.  I also left out the raisins because my kids don't care for them.  The result was a moist, flavorful muffin perfect for a snack or breakfast.  Thanks!

I found these while looking for a way to use up the rest of the applesauce in the fridge. I halved the sugar and doubled the spices - result was a subtly sweet, filling muffin that we both enjoyed. Will definitely make again.

I love this recipe! It is so easy to make. I made a batch for my daughter's class. My changes include: we had leftover home-made cranberry applesauce from Thanksgiving (Cooking Light-Chunky Spiced Applesauce)so I used that; I cut the sugar to 1 cup and used whole wheat flour (2 c.) and AP flour for the rest. They were just a tiny bit dry (probably due to the lowered sugar and/or whole wheat flour) but brushing butter and sprinkling cinnamon/sugar on top once they came out of the oven did the trick!! Delicious!

So good!  I just whipped these up in no time for my 1 and 3 year old.  I cut the recipe into a 4th of this and it made 12 mini muffins that were overflowing (the more muffin top the better :).  I used twice the cinnamon and no allspice.  I left the raisins out of half the muffins since my 3-year-old doesn't like them and just put sprinkles on hers.  They turned out so soft and moist.  Both of the kids are tearing them apart right now.  I'm pretty sure these required less of my attention than pancakes so I will be making them again

Great recipe.  I didn't have any allspice in the house, so I used a little ginger and cloves.  I also substituted 1/2 cup canola oil for the butter. Yum!

This is one of my favorite muffin recipes.  My children love them as does my husband.  They rarely last more than a day or 2 in our house.  I have always used homemade applesauce with them and they are wonderful!

Most Awesome muffins ever, doubled the recipie and made 24 large muffins. I substituded raw sugar for both the brown and white sugar also I substituted applesauce for the oil. Genius now I have fat free muffins- used fat free milk with lemon juice as buttermilk. They were gone before everyone went to bed. I also used 3 cups white flour and 1 cup oats. Easy and delicious I am making them again tomorrow!!

My family loved these muffins! For half the batter, I left out the raisins, and the other half, I added golden raisins and white chocolate chips. I topped both with a streusel topping. Makes a large batch, but they don't last long:) I will certainly be making again. Thanks for sharing!****Made these again this morning. I left out the raisins, substituted sugar in the raw for reg sugar. I added just a hint of pure lemon extract & sprinkled just a bit of sugar in the raw & cinnamon on top. My family loved the hint of lemon! Loved these muffins both ways...will make again!!

A very tasty muffin with minimal involvement. I did use homemade chunky applesauce and, as one reviewer recommended, added a little bit of brown sugar to the top. I'd definitely make these again but might consider a little less all spice or substituting with just nutmeg and ginger.
