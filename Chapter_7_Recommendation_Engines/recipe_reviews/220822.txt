I used the seasonings in this recipe and thought the flavor was delicious. I did use a ham shank instead of diced ham, and kale instead of bell pepper and added carrots too, since thats what I had on hand. I the veg up in the FP and added the last 2 hrs of 7 hrs in the slow cooker. My son came home to these and hamemade bread and butter..a comfort meal made in heaven...yummm

Pretty much how we make our beans, only we use bacon instead of ham, and jalapenos instead of bell pepper. Also, no celery...and we use equal amounts of cumin and oregano. About a tsp each per pound of beans being cooked. This was a nice change though.

I've made this several times, today for the 1st time I did it on the stove top. I had not soaked my beans overnight but, fear not there is a solution, I just brought them to a boil in about 5 inches of water and then turned off the heat and let them soak for an hour. After that time I poured out the water and started the recipe. Instead of ham I used two ham hocks and no lard. I used a 48oz. box of chicken broth and after some of that juice had boiled down I added an additional 32oz. box of vegetable broth. I also noticed that I inadvertently used only 1tsp. of the oregano and thought the beans tasted great. This will undoubtedly be my go to recipe from now on.

The beans were soft, but the recipe was too spicy for my kids.  Next time, I will not use as much cumin and add some sweetness to compliment the ham.

I made this recipe for a vegetarian church potluck today; at first, I thought I'd take it home, because it didn't look appetizing -- the overnight cooking and extended time on "warm" made it look dark and questionable, but it was gone, baby, gone! Because it is an all-vegetarian potluck, I omitted the ham and lard, used MorningStar beef-like crumbles, and kicked up the flavor by adding McKay's Beef-Like broth/seasoning. I used half a green bell pepper, saving the other half for our salads. Husband loved it, picky Daughter had two servings, and I even got to scrape the crockpot and have a spoonful over my rice. I plan to make this again for my little family, keeping it vegetarian. Normally I do not like pinto beans, and usually only have them refried. This is definitely a keeper, and I know it'll be good for church potlucks. Thank you for sharing!

Loved this base recipe & made some changes based on ingredients I had on hand.  I substituted a can of rotele chilies for bell pepper, tossed in some cayenne & a few splashes of Tabasco.  Mmmmmm, we like it spicy.

I thought that this dish turned out very well! I used all of the ingredients except omitted the celery and onion (forgot to purchase) and substituted bacon for the ham. Because I used bacon, I also did not add any lard. I like to leave my bell pepper in halves instead of chopping. After the beans have been cooking for hours, the bell peppers broke up into nice, bite-sized pieces so it saved me a bit of time. Delicious!

Really, really good and so easy! Everyone liked it which never happens in this family of five. I did salt it some.  I didn't have black forest ham. I had ham hocks in the freezer so I put those in. Also used onion powder instead of onions. I wonder about trying it without the bell peppers as they were an unappealing mushy texture they way that they always do when cooked at length.  But not too big a deal there especially if you are just eating it all together with the beans. I just know my picky eaters inspect each little bite and so I knew to pick them out for their portions.  I didn't have quite 5 cups of broth.. more like 3 so I made up the rest with water and it definitely worked out well.  We ate it as a bean soup and also put the beans in tortillas rolled up like a burrito with salt and pepper. Yummm....Definitely a keeper. There were no leftovers, next time I will double the recipe. :)

This is a great recipe especially when served with some cornbread. I omitted the lard and used smoked turkey instead of the ham. If you use smoke turkey ( I used a wing) make sure you have a large crock pot to fit all the ingredients. Once everything is cooked, you should be able to pull the bone out of the pot while the meat falls off effortlessly. Thank you!

The first time I made the recipe I didn't have the oregano, even my kids devoured the beans.  The second time I made it with the oregano and we all agreed, it wasn't as good.  I just made it again and left off the oregano.  Great beans and great recipe!

This was really good, and very healthy (I did not put the lard in (did not think it was necessary!) I swapped out ham for a smoked turkey leg instead. I halved the amount of spices and added in 1/2 tsp of creole seasoning. I meant to add a chopped jalapeno pepper, but it got lost somewhere between the store and my kitchen! The onion, bell pepper and celery make this soup great! I used turkey broth frozen since Thanksgiving and it turned out fantastic! And like most meals, better on the second night of leftovers.

I am not a big fan of beans, but this recipe looked good. It is not, it's fantastic! I used bacon instead of ham and celery seeds instead of celery because I didn't want to run to the store for two ingredients. These beans are super flavorful as a side and they added a lot of flavor to my chili. My biggest issue with dried beans is the texture, but these turned out wonderfully creamy and plump. I will definitely be making these again.

This is a fantastic recipe for crock-pot beans and it is very easy to make.  I did change a few things to better suit my households tastes.  I leave out the bay leaves and use jalapenos for some extra spice.  I also omit the Black Forest ham and lard. Insted I use 1 pack of salt pork along with 3 smoked ham hocks.  Once the 6 hours of cook time is up I take the ham hocks out, clean the meat off the bone, shred it, and put the meat back into the pot. My family loves having the beans in the fridge for a quick snack or meal.

tI tried this recipe, except I used my pressure cooker, after soaking beans. The only other changes I made was to replace green pepper with a roasted pepper, and no meat. It was absolutely delicious! Definitely my favorite pinto bean recipe, in face I'm making some more tonight!

Did not use celery because I didn't have any. Used 1/2 pound cooked bacon instead of ham and a 1/2 a jar of pimentos instead of bell pepper because I had an open jar on hand. It was super. Would make it the same way again - especially the bacon instead of ham. Also, cooked it on low for 11 hr and was perfect.

I made this again tonight. This time with the Christmas ham bone  and fresh red bell pepper (but still no celery). I remembered it was good but this is really delicious.  So much that I felt I had to say so again. Everyone in the family raced for seconds and not a drop left.

Yum yum and yum! I left out the cumin and diced ham and used a smoked ham shank with a good amount of meat still on it instead because I had it in the freezer. We loved these so much more than the recipe I grew up eating.

Superb.  I like both cumin and oregano, but based on 
reviews I swapped amounts and used a TBs cumin and a 
tsp oregano (the ingredient  list does say "to taste"). 
 Loved it.   But one question:  The first thing in the directions states Prep 20 min : Cook 5hr : Ready in 13 h 20 min.  Sorry.  I can't do the math.  What am I missing?

Loved/loved, I used left overs (were dryer)which was perfect for a delicious 'RE-FRIED" beans for taco"s, enchiladas, and in a 2" high casserole dish piled high with cheese and melted under broiler.  Spicy "WONDERFUL"  ALSO used a smoked ham hock one time and the next polish Kielbasa and also again used a hock with hamburger... EVERYONE was great !   toni

I made this recipe without the bell peppers and the celery and it was good. I think one tablespoon of oregano is just too much. The recipe does say, to taste. So now I know to put in less next time.  I did not soak the beans the night before but I did have to cook them a couple hours longer.  I had to add more water too.  They were delicious though!

I left the bell pepper out. I used a turkey leg and not ham. I added just a little salt to each bowl before serving. It turned out great. Everyone was very impressed.

Really tasty!!  I turned it into a vegetarian dish by using vegetable broth and meatless meat and was a success. I had to add a couple cups of broth.

The recipes it's self is a 3.5 I made this twice already.
The first time I made it,I followed the recipe. It was spicy for my child. So the second time I only put the beans in the crock pot, then added 1/2 a teaspoon of ground cumin, garlic clove, and chicken broth. When it finished (6hours) I added fresh chopped cilantro and salt. My little one LOVED it! Make sure you add the cilantro at the very end if it is fresh. If its not fresh cilantro then go ahead and add it when you add the garlic and cumin

I will use whatever ham that is cheap or that is left over. This time it was part of a ham bone from dinner the night before. My most favorite bean recipe ever!! Delicious! Full of flavor. I serve it with cornbread and fried potatoes! Yummmmmm!

Great recipe.  I did change garlic to 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder instead of fresh only because I’ve had better luck with dried herbs when using a slow cooker. Other than that I completed the recipe as written. My husband and myself throughly enjoyed a hot bowl of pintos on a cold rainy day with a piece of garlic bread. Thanks for the recipe.

This soup is easy to make and helps empty the crisper with all the hearty vegetables to be added along with leftover ham. The cumin gives it the earthy taste you expect from south of the border beans.

I made this for my husband with only these changes. I added 1 tsp. of smoked paprika and used a smoked ham hock instead of the ham.  I used olive oil instead of lard. Cooked it on high for about 41/2 hours in my 4 qt slow cooker and it was delicious. This is going on my regular rotation. Thanks for the great recipe.

Made this recipe exactly as posted (with one exception) and found it to be marvelous.  I left out the cumin as my husband does not like cumin.  Personally I think it would have been better with the cumin, so gave the recipe 5 stars anyway!  We had some wonderful pinto beans from a local farm and wanted to cook them up to use in a 3-bean chili recipe from this site.  This recipe gave the beans lots of flavor and body but will not overwhelm the chili.  Next time I will use my own home made chicken broth, as the store bought had an awful lot of sodium, which is not good for my husband's heart issues.  Great recipe!  Will be using again with only minor changes.

This was a great base, made some slight changes...no oregano, bay leaves or lard. Subbed orange bell pepper, used a ham hock instead of chopped ham and added a few fresh green chiles...we like it spicy!! It was delicious and my family loved it.

Added tablespoon of brown sugar. 
Small can tomato sauce. 
Used a meaty ham bone. 
Extra garlic.. 

Sautéed the veggies in bacon grease and added after cooking beans overnight in crock pot with bay leaves, 1 garlic clove, oregano,  1/2 onion,  chix stock, salt and pepper, and ham bone. All the other veggies were added in the morning.  This prevents the veggies from being over cooked.

A great base recipe you can change up to fit your likes, available ingredients, and time. I had kielbasa, not ham; a quart of homemade turkey broth; wanted more spice so added 1 T Chili powder. I needed to leave it all day while i was at work, so low and 10 hours and I came home to amazing smells and yummy dinner.

Easy way to make beans! My only issue was the beans ended up being too salty. I used 3 cans of chicken broth for a little over a pound of soaked beans. Next time I would probably do 2 cans of broth and 1C water. I added bacon instead of ham and I think the salted meats add a bit of salt to the beans. Had this as a side to shredded BBQ chicken and rice. Delicious!

This recipe was spot on. Only change I did was omitting the lard and green pepper, but it really turned out well. I usually add my own spices to recipes I find on here but this was perfect as is.

I made this today!  It was yummy!  I didn't add the bell pepper because I don't like them, I used Italian Seasoning because I didn't realize I was out of oregano.  And I used smoked ham shanks instead of the ham pieces and took it off of the bone when it was done cooking.

I used beef bouillon because that's what I had, and a red pepper instead of green. I soaked only for an hour and a half, not overnight, then cooked it on low for an hour and a half before putting it on high for the six hours. It turned out good!

Delicious! I've made this twice now and my kids, husband and I all love it! The second time I made it I used just 1/2 the ham because I thought it had a bit too much the first time and it was perfect with less. Other than that, the seasonings are exactly right!

The beans turned out very bland and flavorless, so I added about a cup of brown sugar and ketchup and mustard to make them more like barbeque beans since we were having them with bbq chicken.

I have NEVER loved pintos this much, ever! And my kids devoured them! I didn't have ham, so I used some frozen bacon I had and didn't have bay leaves and forgot to use broth. I also added salt. But this was so good!

I made a double batch of this recipe and used a can of stewed tomatoes instead of the bell pepper.  It was very good and I will make it again.  My two teenagers liked it.  I served it with corn bread. The only other change I made was to use bacon instead of ham and Itailan seasoning instead of just oregano as that was what I had on hand.

Hi! We make our beans in much the same way.  I always use the crock pot, too! I never had good luck when I used a pot on the stove. I'm the low and slow kind of guy. I'll let the beans soak over night and the next day. That night I'll turn the crock pot on to "keep warm." When I get up the next morning and pour a cup of coffee I'll turn it on "high"  for three or four hours. Then I turn it to low for a couple hours. I'll add all the goodies when I put it on low except for the ham because I added that several hours prior. it's usually done by 3pm, and it  always turns out great!  I just wanted to tell you that your recipe is very good! Thanx for posting!!!

I really enjoyed them, the only problem I had was the beans were still slightly firm after 8 hours on low, so I let them go another 4 hours.  I did soak them over night.  However, I will make them again.

I had to punt as I didn’t have some of the ingredients.  I omitted the celery and bell pepper as I didn’t have any and used a leftover ham bone in place of the Black Forest.  Supplemented the stock with water and added a can of mild green chiles.  Used another writers suggestion of boiling the beans for 5 minutes then resting for an hour in the boiled water.  Drained and dumped in a slow cooker - done right at the 6 hour mark.   Thank you so much!

These beans were delicious! I cooked them on low for 10 hours and it turned out great. The only change I made was adding some cayenne pepper at the end when it was done just cuz I felt like it could use a little spice. Will definitely make again!

It only took 4 hrs on high in the crockpot. I also left the Bell pepper cook in halves and it broke apart nicely at the end.

Excellent ! I did variate from the amount of a few ingredients, but it paid off. I started with the dried and rinsed beans without the presoak.I added 1/4 more green pepper,2 cups more chicken broth, and by accidentally misreading the amount of cumin 1/tlb vs 1/tsp.Tremendous ,flavor describes it best

Easy and delicious bean recipe. I soaked the beans for 8 hours, any longer and they might have been too mushy. I didn't have any lard so I baked some bacon and used the rendered grease. I also used smoked ham hocks instead of processed ham. Then I cooked it all in the slow cooker on high for about 5 hours. The beans are tender and the ham hock adds some meatiness. One of the easiest and tastiest ways to make beans.

Being a Southerner and a purist when it comes to my ethnic food, I was pleasantly surprised. I could love on regular pintos and cornbread, but these were great. The seasoning is great and they reheat well. I will try them over rice in the future. I anticipate another great paring.

I made and it is delicious as well as easy to make.
I always sauté onions to brown slightly as well as the other solid ingredients to give it a little more flavor.
My husbands idea was or put ham steak in next time, I think he’s on to something!

Great recipe! Made the beans taste good.  I didn't have time for the crockpot when I decided I wanted some beans for dinner so I put them in my Instant pot.  I just put the pot on the chili/bean setting and it cooked the unsoaked beans just right.

It's a bit salty even though I used low sodium broth. Beans are all tender and my hubby likes it a lot. I personally don't eat beans much but I like it okay. Will make it again if my hubby wants it.

Great recipe and easy way to fix beans.  I soaked the beans overnight in lightly salted water.  I already had a cup of diced onions in the fridge so I added them to the med. onion (chopped) the recipe calls for.  Also used four stalks of celery, four large carrots (chopped), four cloves of garlic (we like it spicy), whole green pepper (chopped) and reduced the cumin to 1/2 tsp.  Had 1.2 lbs of sliced ham in the freezer (left over from a spiral cut we had at Christmas) so I chopped that into 1” squares and threw that in.  Couldn’t imagine what the Tbsp of lard would add so I substituted a Tbsp. of butter.  With all these additions I had to add about a cup of water to the 16 oz. of chicken broth to cover the beans.  Pretty much filled a 5-qt crock pot. ??. Cooked on high for six hours.  It was delicious.  Even better as leftovers.  In fact, next time I’m going to fix it a day ahead and leave it sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours to give the flavors more time to meld.  Served it with the Awesome Creamy Cornbread Casserole listed elsewhere on this site.  Yum!

Followed recipe but doubled garlic & onion, used leftover slices of ham & bone instead. After cooked, beans were succulent & tasted good, but they seemed like they needed something else.  I added 28oz of diced tomatoes & 15oz of Rotel tomatoes w/ jalapenos.  This added a more robust flavor. Next time, I think I'll use more peppers. Beans are standout delicious and I'll continue to use the recipe.  It appears from what I added that I might've been going more for chili,  but these were still pinto beans with ham... Just more flavors.  Delicious food!!

I made this as recipe stated except I didn’t put celery. Family did not like it at all. They said it tasted like chicken soup, not at all like beans like I usually make it creamy. Did not like it made with chicken stock. Will have to take this off my list.

My pinto beans turned out great. I didn’t use the lard, oregano, green peppers or bay leaves and they still turned out delicious. I substituted ham hocks for the ham chunks and man o man I can’t wait to make them again! They were delicious ????

No changes, just try and follow the recipe, it will turn out great. After you make it, if you want to make any changes, that will be the time to do it. But this is a great recipe.
Thank you,

I think the flavor is 5 stars. I would definitely cook the beans before making it next time or it takes too long. Great basic bean recipe. And if you don't eat ham you can use miso.

I put everything in the crockpot together, not soaking the beans overnight.  Cooked for about 6-7 hrs on low. Not sure  if I’d do this again because the dish had a strange flavor. Perhaps the beans.

I did not have chicken broth, lard, oregano or green bell peppers. I made it with water,  the other ingredients, carrots, one jalapeno and used basil. I actually cooked in the crock pot for  2 days. It is great!!!! My  teenage grandsons loved it and so did I! We put the mixture in a tortilla with melted cheese. Yummy. Chris Holt

I added carrots to the recipe.  Both my wife and I loved it!  The recipe title did throw me a little.  I would call it something like "slow cooker pinto bean and ham soup"  because that is what it turns out to be.

This is very tasty bean soup. I only made small modifications. I used 1 tsp of cumin and oregano.  I didn’t use the lard, instead I cooked two thick cut bacon slices in the microwave , broke it up and added it with the drippings.  This is a keeper.

Pinto beans a good bowl don’t need all of this.  All I add are beans, water about 1 inch covering beans, I use salt pork but you can also use a ham bone leftover, about 5-6 garlic cloves, pepper and I add salt at the end of cooking if needed.  Cook beans to tenderness and voila!  Good ??

I'm not understanding some of the comments that said it was spicy. A teaspoon of cumin is very little compared to what's in chili. 
Anyway, I found this to be a good base for almost any recipe calling for pintos. It's not clear though if you drained your beans after soaking. I do but some may not know to and that could be where they think it's bland. I also do not use water to cook my beans, I use all chicken stock. It provides a better flavor base. 
I've used this for chili, minus the ham and added ground beef and chunks of chuck. I made a bean soup. I made a white 2 bean chili and whole bean burritos. 
If anyone has a good recipe for refried beans I would love it if you could share it. I'm looking for something as close to authentic and I can get. My grandson's fiancee is Latina and I want to try to impress her with my "skills"! haha

Good recipe.  I don't use garlic and cumin and oregano should be about 1/4 teaspoon each.  Use a small amount and taste your food.  Add more spice and herb if necessary.   Use a good chicken broth with lots of flavor like Better Than Bouillon brand. 
 There is no MSG and if used correctly you may not have to use much added salt.

Go to Walmart and get dry casserole pinto beans. This will aleviate the need to soak overnight. Cook them the 5 hours.

I made these for a fundraiser for over 200 people and it was a hit!  I got more compliments on them.  I used meaty ham hocks instead of the Black Forest ham and lard.  Then I pulled the meat from the ham hocks and returned to the pot.  I left the celery out only because I didn’t have any.   Super good!

Nice recipe.  I added salt and pepper toward the end.  The recipe does not call for salt and pepper at the beginning and I suggest to wait because it is hard to know the amount of salt that will be released (especially from the ham) during cooking.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I will definitely use it again!

Excellent! Nothing needs changed on this one. The ham I used wasn't Black Forest, b/c I had a bone-in ham in the freezer, but I think it would be just as good as stated in recipe. Didn't have lard either, but I think the extra fat on my ham was fine.

This recipe was delicious!! I purchased a 2 lb bag of dry pinto beans and just doubled the recipe. I had red peppers on hand and used them instead. Even the neighbors enjoyed them??

Beans didn't get soft. Very disappointed because the recipe seemed delicious. Sorted, rinsed and soaked beans in water overnight, at least 17 hours. Cooked in slow cooker on low for 7 hours. I feel that I wasted ingredients on hard beans. Not sure what the process is going to be next time.

This turned out great. My first time to use a slow cooker for anything. I didn't have Pat's so I substituted olive oil and I didn't burn the house down or die, so I'll call it a successful swap.

Three stars because I didn't add any of the spices and I should have.  So the three stars are my fault!  I did use the slow cooker overnight for 12 hours on low and it turned out great.

I loved this easy recipe! Of course, using a slow cooker to cook these beans was the best! I placed a turkey neck in the dish for flavoring. Make  sure you boil the turkey neck for an hour then place in the slow cooker. This is the only way I would cook the pinto beans. I added salt, pepper, garlic salt, and garlic powder.

I had pork neck bones to use so wrapped them in cheesecloth to keep the bones out, and I couldn't find my bay leaves.  Didn't miss them, this was excellent.

I used a ham steak, cubed and omitted the lard.  Soaked the beans overnight and cooked it on low for six hours.  Served over rice, everyone liked the flavors.

I made this almost exactly as the recipe, I used smoked turkey instead of ham and I added cayenne pepper because we like spicy in my family. Everyone LOVED them! I served with rice and cornbread.

I used smoke pork jowl instead of ham, so there was no need for the lard as the jowls was fatty enough.  I used 4 cups chicken stock and 1 cup water.  Did not soak the beans overnight because I did not buy them until this morning. I did not use oregano and I used celery flakes instead of ribs of celery.  I added a couple dashes of Louisiana Hot Sauce® and Worcestershire Sauce.  I also added a couple tablespoons of sugar.  Since I did not soak the beans, I cooked them on low for 9 hours.  They turned out great.  The liquid took on that nice gravy like consistency that we so love, not runny.  We served it over white rice with a nice piece of cornbread on the side.

Very good flavor, but oh, so salty. Probably because I added a ham hock. Next time I will use sodium free broth.

With a few changes, this the best pinto bean recipe ever! The changes: substitute one medium whole pablano pepper for the green pepper indicated and forget the celery. I also used an 8 ounce package of diced ham available at our supermarket. Wonderful beans!

I used sausage instead of ham.  I believe the real secret is using chicken broth instead of water.  These were great and will definitely make them again.

Awesome!!! Between my husband and I, it was gone in less than 2 days. Used smoked turkey wing instead of ham/bacon. Because it was gone so quickly, made it again a couple of days later.

I used broth saved from boiled ham and cabbage dinner in place of the chicken stock.  I also used bacon grease in place of the lard.  Separate note, I also use bacon grease to pop popcorn in and then salt & pepper it - great snack.  Fantastic ham and bean recipe, easy and delicious. Will make it again.

Delicious! Very flavorful! I had leftover ham bone (with a good amount of meat on it) from Christmas and used that rather than diced ham and lard. Took out the bone after cook time and removed and shredded the meat. Mmmmm... Cornbread and you've got supper!  I will make this again!

These are FANTASTIC! I was going up a traditional Southern family recipe when I tried these, so I knew it would have to turn out well to be enjoyed.   These were declared to be BETTER than the family recipe. This is going to be the standard recipe in our house from now on. Thanks for sharing!

My husband enjoyed the recipe.  I ended up adding additional garlic and a few other odds & ends with spices.  We have thrown in cooked chicken fajita meat (green bell peppers & onions included) that I had canned, as well as some pork stew meat.  Both times the meat has come out amazingly tender.  The key to this recipe is most definitely allowing the beans to soak overnight!  Thanks for the great recipe!  Will make again.

Quick soaked the beans then put in crock pot with bullion. Didn't have bacon so subbed sausage. Used plenty of garlic and cumin. Very tasty. Will make again following overnight soak and bacon. You know, the recipe. This will go into rotation for sure.

Not a bad recipe but not everyone enjoyed them. A little spicier than I expected!

Idk.... I didn't use the bell pepper or celery because my family does not like them and I left out the oregano based off other reviews. I used a pack and a half of Bacon BC someone else said they used that and I didn't have any Ham (Bacon's got more flavor anyway)... it was not spicy at all to us and trust and believe.... U NEED TO ADD SALT. Without salt is VERY bland. BC I used Bacon I didn't add lard. I used 2 seasoning cubes and sprinkled salt over the top about half way through and mixed it in. I also added curry BC my husband loves it. To us it was just ok. Good for a base but definitely needs more seasoning.

This recipe is awesome! I do alter it a little bit. I do not add the celery or green bell pepper and I replace the black forest ham with a 1 lbs. slab of bacon, cut up into 1 inch pieces. I also keep bacon grease left over from Sunday breakfasts and use that for the lard. Also, I add about 2 tsp. of salt, just because the first time I made it, it was very bland. You could easily adjust the salt though. Overall, this is some good eating.

Awesome! I didn't have any stock so I used boiling hot water in the crockpot. They were perfectly seasoned and cooked in half the time. Definite repeat, and cook on low.
