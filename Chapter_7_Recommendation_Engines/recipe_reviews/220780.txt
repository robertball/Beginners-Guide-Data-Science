I made this with scallops instead of shrimp on a rainy day and it was a big hit.  Not a drop left in the pot!

I do like this recipe over the cream of leek soup recipes. But I find the colour is washed out by the end of cooking time.  So I had to add some extra parsley at the end to each bowl to make it a bit more colourful. The taste was very good.
