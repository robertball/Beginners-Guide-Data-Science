OH MY GOD!  This has to be one of the best cookies I have ever tasted!  And that's a LOT of cookies over 50+ years!
SOOOO Wonderful, but very addictive.. the sesame seeds just add such a great flavor to the melt-in-your-mouth cookie. This is getting a FIVE-STAR in my card box.  Very pretty, too!

These cookies were really good. They are a nice change from the usual cookies. The only thing I would do differently is bake them on waxed paper since they stuck pretty badly from the jam melting, but they were VERY YUMMY.

Very good and quite simple to make. I used salted butter and wish I would have used UNSALTED butter. It didn't detract from the taste or texture, just after a few days tasted a little bit like salt. Would definitely make again.

These cookies are awesome! I used margarine instead of butter, and I had no almond extract so I used vanilla extract. I also just mixed in the sesame seeds before separating the dough into little balls and placing them on wax paper. I made 12 bigger cookies instead of 24 and baked them for 15 minutes. They were not dry at all, very delicious!

This is the exact recipe I make every year for Christmas! I got this from Taste of Home Magazine YEARS ago. I do use a variety of fruit fillings and double up on the almond extract. I don't measure the sesame seeds or the filling, but I knoe that I use more of both. My family LOVES these cookies and it just wouldn't be the holidays without them! :)

Dry and not very tasty.  Will not make again.
