This was good, but I changed the ingredients.  I first made it with vegetable oil, but thought it was to oily.  I changed the vegetable oil to Mayonaise and I used surgar instead of splenda.  I also used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar.  I heated the sugar and vinegar together until the sugar was disolved.  I liked it a lot with the changes i made.

I enjoyed this but we found it too sweet.  Next time I'd use half of the splenda.

I took the advice of other reviewers and made these changes: used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 olive oil in place of oil, used 1/2 rice vinegar and  1/2 cider vinegar, used 2 T. of Truvia in place of Splenda. It was still a bit on the sweet side.  Went over well with my partner who doesn't like too much mayo.
