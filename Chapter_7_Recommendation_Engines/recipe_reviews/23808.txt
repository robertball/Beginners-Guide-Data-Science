This turned out great! I had never made spelt bread and, after searching on the net, I discovered that it's supposed to be difficult to make come out right. This came out in my bread machine better than the white and wheat recipes I'd used. I used the "Quick" setting, which had 2 risings, instead of the "Basic" setting, which had 3 risings in order to cut down on kneading. Delicious! Beth, I hope you've posted your muffin and brownie recipes too--I'll search! :-)

I have been trying to find a good spelt flour bread recipe for awhile.  This turned out excellent.  I used skim milk instead of rice milk and added 5 tablespoons of cracked grains (flax, rye, millet, etc).  I used the quick bread cycle and selected light crust on my bread machine.  Then I buttered the crust as soon as it was done and put it in an airtight container to soften the crust. It turned out great.

This bread turned out well.  We often buy spelt bread from the health food store for my child who is allergic to wheat.  He often dislikes the store bought loaves as tough & tasteless.  He devoured this bread.  Sliced thin it was easy to handle, tender, and moist.  Cost much less than the store bought loaves.   Thanks!

This is the tastiest, moistest spelt bread I have EVER had.  Better than the bakery.  After reading other reviews, I put mine on the quick bread cycle, which on my machine is called the "cake" cycle for 10 minutes until it beeped and I scraped the edges down.  I then realized I had probably selected the wrong cycle, and switched it to the "rapid" cycle which bakes for 1:50 minutes.  This turned out a moist, beautiful loaf that could easily be mistaken for white bread, were it not for the nutty flavor of the spelt, and the sheer goodness of it.

My son is allergic to wheat and we have been struggling to find a bread he will eat. He really misses bread! This is it. He loves it and will even eat it 1-2 days later. We use almond milk(he hates rice milk) and have used honey or stevia instead of sugar. It is a heavy dense loaf, but slices nice thinly and doesn't crumble.

A nice dense loaf.  I used soy milk instead of rice milk, otherwise followed recipe exactly.  I'll play with this a little to try to get it to rise a little more.  But excellent recipe.  Kids and parents alike gobbled it up.  Thanks for sharing!

this is a great recipe for proportions i just upgrade the quality of ingredients to make it a super healthy bread! I use almond milk, hemp milk or coconut milk whatever i have in fridge, raw honey, unrefined salt  and coconut oil! I have also started adding one egg and 1/2  tsp less yeast and that helps this bread rise really well, otherwise you often end up with a very dense loaf when using spelt. I have also used my revised recipe to make hot dog and hamburger buns!!!

I didn't have rice milk so I used skim and made it in the breadmaker.  It didn't rise, but I'll experiment using my manufacturer's troubleshooting suggestions and see if that helps.

I used a bread maker and mine didn't rise all that high. But maybe that's typical of spelt bread? Tasted alright though.

We just found out my son is allergic to wheat (along with many other things), so I'm desperately searching for recipes that fit his new diet. I've never made spelt bread before, and I've not yet bought spelt bread from the store. This bread seems a little heavy and dense, but I guess a loaf of its whole wheat counterpart would be the same way. It tastes fine, like wheat, but I wish it was lighter. Thanks for the recipe.

The dough was very dry in the bread maker so I added 1 more tbs of oil, 1/4 more cup of rice milk, and 1 egg. The bread didn't have any problems with rising. :) yeah for a bread maker recipe!

I used honey instead of sugar.  The spelt flavor is wonderful, nutty and light!  I baked 1/2 a loaf in a 400 oven for 25 minutes.  Great flavor!

The consistency was wonderful, our children gobbled up every slice quickly.  Easy to make, great typical spelt taste, made a perfect slice of toast.

I make this bread a lot, but I give only 4 stars, because I think it needs more water. I always get more water for it to be right consistency. As somebody reccomended on this sit I use 1 tsp of xanthan gum. It helps too. But the taste is amazing!

This bread tastes good.  However, it did not rise at all.  It is very dense.

This loaf felt like a brick when I pulled it out of my breadmaker! I wouldn't use this bridge for sandwiches but it was easy to slice and made lovely toast. I used 2 cups white spelt and 2 cups wholemeal spelt which may be the reason my results weren't as good as other reviewers'. I added 2 tsp bread improver and used skim  milk instead of rice milk.

In going wheat-free, I was looking for a spelt bread recipe that would make good toast in the morning. I found it right here! Even my husband, who is a picky eater and often rejects things after a taste, loves it. I do make a couple of substitutions to suit our needs. I use honey instead of sugar, melted organic coconut oil for the canola, powdered goat milk in water for the rice milk, and I found organic white spelt at our local co-op. Same proportions of each. This is a dense loaf that I would personally not use for a sandwich but love to eat first thing in the morning, toasted with butter or jam.  Thanks for a great recipe.
