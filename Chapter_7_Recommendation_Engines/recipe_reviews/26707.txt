This is a good recipe for hummus, but is even better when you toast the sesame seeds in a dry skillet until they pop, puree with the olive oil to make a drizzly paste, then add the rest of the stuff. I like to coat the top with olive oil and serve with toasted pita. Yummy! And good for you.

This is an excellent recipe for basic hummus.  It's very easy to add other ingredients if you want to try different flavors.

I always thought hummus was hard to make, so I never tried to make it until now. This recipe is so easy & it taste great. I multiplied this recipe by 4 & I had very little left over.

This is super quick and easy, and great for dipping veggies in.  I reduced the oil to 1 tbsp. and used 4 cloves of garlic.

I felt the garlic was a bit strong, even though I love garlic.  I added lemon juice and more bean juice as I blended because is seemed very thick to me.  Next time I will add half the garlic and continue to use lemon juice to gain the texture I like...overall, it is a good recipe though.

This was the first time I tried making hummus at home.  Loved it!!  Yes, it was a little plain - but it was a BASIC recipe.  You can definitely use this one and add whatever you want.

I usually make the Hummus III recipe (which is excellent), but I was out of tahini and went looking for a different recipe without tahini.  This one just didn't measure up.

I am giving this recipe three stars, mostly because of my own silly blender. In order to work at all well the blender needs a certain amount of water always inside. The hummus came out with the consistancy of mashed potatoes (lol) but it was a good recipe. Once I find my food processor, I plan on making it correctly.

When I made this I toasted the sesame seeds which brought out a nice flavor. I made it with verbal instructions from my mom and the step to cook the garlic was accidentally missed, but it still turned out great. I loved how fast it was to make too.

I would give the recipe less stars except I have to take some of the blame myself.  The garlic was too mild after cooking it and the beans didn't all get to the right consistency with the processor I was using.  I couldn't get the right taste with the salt and pepper.  I actually dumped it and had to buy store bought for the luncheon.  If I try this again I will smash and chop the garlic real fine and add it raw.  And instead of the liquid from the beans, I'll use the olive oil directly in the mix along with lemon juice.

This ended up a big clump in the bottom of my blender, I couldn't add enough liquid to soften it.  I had to toss it.

This was definitely not good hummus. I didn't think it was something that could be messed up. It was SO THICK! I didn't want to start adding a bunch of liquid from the can. That is not traditional and it would have made it super salty. As is, it reminded me of a chickpea version of refried beans. It was also bland, with missing the seasonings. I added some salt, lemon juice, and some cubard seasonings, but it still was missing something important. I was not sure exactly what. Maybe, the tahini is really needed for texture or creaminess and possibly flavor too. I have a good blender, and it even left some sesame seed bits. They just were not a good subitute for prepared sesame seed paste (tahini). I guess, it is just needed.

This was really good!! I use 6 tablespoons of lemon juice like another reviewer said. I used 3 tablespoons of minced garlic,1 tsp of cumin, 2 tablespoons of roasted sesame seeds, 1 tablespoon of paprika, and I used all the juice that was reserved. Of course the high calorie hummus from the store is going to taste better, but for just a few calories this is really good :) It says basic in the title so it shouldn't come with whistles and bells. :)

Excellent hummus!  This is a great recipe for the person who does not stock tahini in their pantry.  I added 1/3 cup roasted jar red sweet peppers for zip and also sauteed the garlic in sesame oil.  Great flavor and big hit.

4 stars for being a basic recipe intended to be hummus at its most simplified, but it's definitely bland. Personally, I think hummus needs to have at least some lemon juice to brighten it up, but this recipe is a good foundation for making your own hummus to suit your own tastes.

The first time I made this it was a HUGE hit! I added a Tablespoon of lemon juice and another clove (or two) of garlic with a dash of garlic powder. It was perfect. My friends all asked for the recipe.

Very good, and simple. I didn't have sesame seeds, so I added some soy sauce. Which also doubled as the salt. Thanks for the no fuss recipe!

After reading the revies, always having used the tahini in my hummus, I too toasted the sesame seeds and garlic in a drop of olive oil. Considering how I love a bit spicy taste, added a pinch of cayanne pepper and paprika for giving that beautiful color. Oh so yum! Good recipe for a basic hummus. Not sure how it would taste without toasting for flavor. Do not like the raw garlic taste either....

I did not like this recipe at all.  BASIC is the key word here.  I had to add more garlic and even add lemon juice just to get it to taste right.  It didn't even come close to authentic hummus.

This is a good recipe for very basic hummus! You kinda have to build up from there though. Add lemon juice to your liking and I like to add lots of toasted sesame seeds and garlic too. Serve warm with a little bit of extra virgin olive oil and fresh pita bread. Or dip raw cauliflower florets into it as well. Super delicious & GOOD FOR YOU!

This was wonderful! If I had known making my own hummus was this easy I'd have been doing it a long time ago! I skipped the sesame seeds but followed everything else to a tee. I used this for the Hummus Casserole recipe off this site---Yummmmmy! Thanks so much!

Good but needs a few tweaks to be amazing!  Toast the sesame seeds and roast the garlic first!  Next time I will add an extra clove or two of garlic.  Overall a great jumping off point to add numerous flavors too...perhaps sun dried tomatoes, roasted red peppers, olives...the options are endless!

It was just ok to me. This was my first attempt at making hummus and I feel it is missing something. I see a few recommendations for lemon juice. Perhaps I'll try it.

I really wanted to like this, but Hummus needs Tahini. It's not the same without it. I also use lemon in my hummus. I tried this without the lemon and it's just not on. Sorry.

Honestly, I thought this needed much more liquid than called for- I think the recipe should call for more like 1/4 cup and then add more as needed beyond that amount.  The blender just wouldn't move anything around until we got to about the 1/4 cup mark, and was still too thick after that.  We thought this needed a bit more of a tang, too.  If I were to make it again, I might add some lemon juice.  Don't think we'll be making it again, though.

I thought this was pretty bland by itself, and added a lot of extra stuff.  My boyfriend liked it, so maybe I'm just being too picky. Good spices to add are ground cumin, paprika, garlic powder, and lemon juice. Plain yogurt also adds something. It's good to experiment. Adds a little spice to life, no pun intended. ;-)

I needed to add a lot of liquid to this to get it smooth enough, including lemon juice which is definitely needed for an authentic flavour.  Unfortunately, though, I think I used too much of the sesame seeds and I toasted them a bit too much as well, because the sesame taste was really overpowering.  So watch out for that...

I LOVE this recipe. Yes, simple. Yes, you could add ingredients but for a simple, great hummus recipe-start here. I love garlic and have used this as a dip (mostly) but also as a sandwich spread in lieu of mayo. This is in regular rotation for my family and as such, always have chickpeas just so I can make this recipe! A keeper!

The taste was 4 stars. However, I gave this 3 stars b/c of the alterations made. I added 6 Tbls of lemon juice & at least 3 tsp of reserved liquid b/c garbanzo beans did not blend w/out more liquid being added. Other than that, it turned out good for a basic recipe.

This was the first hummus recipe I've ever made, and it gave me a good starting point. However, I didn't rate it highly because I felt like I had to add so much to the original recipe. Here's what I did: 
-sautee sesame seeds with garlic
-double minced garlic and add 1/2 tsp. powdered garlic
-add 1/4 c. lemon juice
-add 1/2 c. reserve (after the tsp.)
-add 1/2 cup roasted red bell pepper (from a jar)

I was disappointed by this very thick hummus.  I added plenty of extra lemon juice make it 'dippable'.  Perhaps it is a little too simple to work.

I made this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving.  This was my first attempt at hummus and it came out pretty well.  I didn't add all of the olive oil, trying to save some calories.  I added probably 2-3 tablespoons of reserved liquid to get it to the right consistency.  It tasted somewhat bland, so I added a little garlic salt and some rosemary seasoning blend.  The end result was good.  I served it with pita and bagel chips...yum!

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. Not everyone in my house agreed but my girls...the guys just didn't care for it. But as the girls out bet the guys...It's going to be a repeat offender on the app table. I stayed with in the ingredients but used a homemade garlic and herb infused olive oil. And I measured the liquid from the can of garbanzo beans, to know how much I need to add for my desired consistency. In a can of beans the liquid amount is roughly 2/3 cup, I used 1/3 cup when processing my batch in my Ninja unit. And used the smaller of the unit. I processed until I couldn't feel any bits of sesame seeds and to be quite honest, a little bit of bits isn't bad. You just need to know that every little bit when processing you need to make sure to scrap down you mix, or it will be left chunky and not desired smoothness your looking for. The nice thing about this basic recipe, is there is room for add-ins. I can totally see adding roasted red peppers and other flavors from my pantry and even left over veggies. But the true testament is that if you don't like hummus, you won't like the recipe. I love hummus and I think this is a great basic recipe as a base.

I liked most things about this recipe but the olive oil was too strong for my taste. I would probably make this again, just with less oil.

Very easy and quick to make. I made it for a party and people loved it.

Everyone really liked this.  I did have to add MUCH more (almost one whole can's worth) of liquid.  Maybe it's because I doubled the recipe.  Tasted yummy and you can add whatever you want.  I added some hot sauce and chipotle powder for a little kick!

This is a great recipe I've used many times.  My favorite add on is to double the garlic for garlic lovers hummus.  A nice hispanic twist is to add cumin, chili powder, and paprika.  YUM!

From this base recipe, it is very easy to experiment with some extras. I added some roasted red pepper, chilli  powder, and cumin, and mine turned out very delicious
