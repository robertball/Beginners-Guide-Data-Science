Puts the flavor right into the corn! I didn't need to slather butter on the individual pieces...though I guess you could :) Great if you're cooking for a crowd.

Wonderful. This made for a perfectly prepared corn on the cob. I've heard of boiling the corn in milk, but never tried it before. This recipe has made a believer out of me.

Everybody loved this corn!! My husband couldn't see the point in putting all this stuff in the pot, but after we sat down and started to eat he said that it tasted like the corn already had everything on it. This was the first time we didn't eat our corn with butter :)

Been doing it this way for years. Coming from Jersey I was used to the yummy corn from the markets. Living in Holland you cant always get "Good"corn on the cob so you make do. This is a way to make any corn taste like sweet jersey corn. BTW, I dont use whipping cream, the milk is enough to give it a nice taste.

Oh my, this was DEE-LISH!!!  Moist, flavorful & sweet corn that hubby & kids were all fighting over...thanks for the great recipe Daddy K!!!  Update: Tastes even better if you throw the cooked corn on the grill with a sprinkle of salt...unbelievably good!

I have made a similar recipe like this. This was really good other than the cook time wasn't enough. I also used half and half instead of heavy cream just because that is what I had on hand. Other than the cooking time it was a great recipe.

I had heard about using milk and sugar for corn on the cob, found this recipe and had to give it a try. Enjoyed it very much! I liked the light coating of butter that the corn had when pulled out and the addition of sugar and dairy to the water did add to the quality of the end result.  I didn't have heavy whipping cream so I used half-n-half. I will use this recipe again.

Well that is just fantastic!  Didn't need to add anything but salt and pepper.  I did not use the sugar, but otherwise made as written and it's amazing!

I have to try this again, I totally forgot the heavy cream!  And the corn wasn't very good to begin with either.  We both prefer to cook corn 8 to 10 minutes.

Super yummy...made really good fresh sweet corn taste exceptional.  I loved the ease of serving it to my kids without the hassle of buttering it for each one.  A little salt & pepper and it was perfect.  The only drawback was that the ears were slippery as heck to get out of the water -- kept slipping out of my tongs -- but that was just a learning curve.  :)

I didn't know people even made corn on the cob any other way than this growing up!  My grandma always made her corn this way (and my family are farmers from Nebraska; we definitely know corn!) Omit the butter in the pot and slather some on at the table instead. Yes, grilled corn is definitely good, but I will always prefer this method because it produces that "crispy" bite each time.

Ok I admit it, I was a skeptic. Seemed like a waste of perfectly good milk. But I've made corn a thousand times, usually boiled, and it's never great.... but it's corn on the cob and it's a summer tradition. This was fantastic. No one used butter or salt at the table - an absolute first in my house. Everyone wants me to make it again, to see if it was a fluke. All I know is, I'll never boil it any other way again.

Simply delicious ... make sure you use some quality corn to begin with. The recipe was spot on right up to timing ... 8 minutes and put the corn in AFTER the water boils.

Quite good and the corn didn't shrink down after cooking, but stayed juicy and moist. Also didn't add any more butter after cooking and used half and half.  Cook time was a little longer than the specified time.

This was wonderful - I'll never cook corn on the cob my old way again! After it was done, we cut the corn off the cob, sprinkled some salt on it and dug in. No complaints!

YES YES YES!!!! So much flavor was added to the corn. I was born and raised in the south and grew up on corn on the cob. I have never tasted corn so good as when I boiled my corn in this mixture. YOU CAN'T GO WRONG HERE!!!

I omit the cream and it is still wonderful. I also use Splenda, maybe 10 packets. I know it sounds devious, but the method works and the corn is delicious!

It wasn't quite what I expecting. I may try it later and soak the corn longer, maybe cook it longer at a lower temperature.

I “poached” some frozen prebought niblets in this butter/milk/sugar mixture for approximately 10 minutes. I can say that I will never make corn on the cob any other way.

I skipped the sugar since I was using sweet corn. I also used regular whipping cream since the only "heavy" whipping cream I could find was too large [the recipe only calls for two ounces]. They came out great! Not only were they rich and flavorful, but the mixture does something wonderful to the texture. The corn is bitten off with ease while remaining firm and juicy. I didn't even need salt or butter when it was done. And I tried smearing some on a portion of one of the cobs just to see; it actually tasted better without the extra butter. My roommate and his girlfriend mentioned how good they were, too. I do wish I would have added salt to the water, though. I'll try that next time. Oh, and I'm at high altitude, so it needed about 15 minutes to cook.

This recipe was delicious as is.  I made it exactly according to the list of ingredients and the directions, and my husband and I, as well as our company, all thought it was wonderful!!  I will say, though, that I started it with very good corn, and that can make a huge difference.

Some of the best corn I've ever made. I am the worst cook in my family. I can barely boil water but this was so easy to make. My boyfriend thought it was delicious

This was the best corn on the cob recipe so far for preparing on the stove. I followed the  instructions and didn't change anything.    My whole family raved about it.  I will definitely make again.

I made it per the recipe, except I used half & half instead of the cream because it's what I had on hand. This was excellent corn. Most of our family didn't even require butter on it, as it was already very buttery. I will definitely make my corn this way again.

When I'm not making corn on the grill, this is the only other now accepted way in my house to make corn....absolutely incredible....we tend to cook the corn longer than specified for texture purposes.....We even use the same amount of ingredients when only cooking 2 ears

I'll never make corn another way again.  Some miraculous happens both to the flavor and texture.

the only change I made is, I used half and half because I didn't have any whip cream on hand.  Husband was a skeptic at first, but after the first bite, he converted.

I liked how the corn didn't come out mushy like most boiled corned. It was thoroughly cooked through but still had some crunch to it. The flavor is pretty good on its own, but I'd recommend sprinkling the cobs after they're done cooking with some seasoning salt or pepper to jazz it up a little bit.
