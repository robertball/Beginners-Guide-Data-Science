I cut this recipe in half using two eggs, one apple and one zucchini. The result was a dozen very moist, tasty muffins. Next time, I think the addition of some walnuts and some extra spice would be nice.  Thanks for the easy, tasty recipe, justsmurfy!

Omg! Amazing! I have a ton of zucchini from my garden and decided to go with this recipe because it also has apples. I tripled the recipe so I can individually freeze them for the kids to have a quick and healthy breakfast. They turned out moist and fluffy. Not as dense as the other pics I saw (perhaps, because I almost doubled the zucchini and apples)? Absolutely perfect. I added raisins of course. ;) Thank you!

Loved it! Its an awesome twist on zucchinni bread!  The apples and cinnamon really did the trick. This is a tasty and healthy subsitution for cupcake at family gatherings, office treats, and after dinner desserts! Thanks so much for the recipe!! Two thumbs up! P.s. For those who enjoy sugary snacks, this is probably not for you. Its mildly sweet and like i stated, much healthier for you :)

Very good! I read everyoneâ€™s comments and incorporated the ideas.  I used 1/2 of the oil with 1/2 cinnamon applesauce and added a little salt, some raisins along with a couple of shakes of Allspice, cloves and an extra 1/2 TBSP cinnamon.  It made over 18 muffins.  The kitchen smelled so good. Will make it again.

Made according to directions. Very good texture and taste. However, next time I will add 1/2 tsp of salt. It just seemed to be missing something.

I will keep this recipe, as they were so good! Very moist and not too sweet. I have 10 lbs of raisins to use up, so I put raisins in them and that's the only change I made. We loved these!

I made two batches - 1st exactly to recipe and 2nd  used as basis for a whole new recipe which turned out spectacular. As written this recipe is 'meh' at best lacking interest and very bland. Also too sweet for a zuch muffin.  Second batch became whole wheat with sugar reduced to 3/4 c demerara sugar, added cloves, ginger and nutmeg, an extra scant cup zucchini, and an extra egg. This is now my go to recipe for zucchini bread and will make a batch of chocolate ones with the leftover zucchini.

First, these muffins are AWESOME. I did make one change, but it was only because these sounded so yummy and I didn't have an apple. I substituted applesauce instead, and the muffins turned out moist and delicious. My 15-year-old son said they're the best muffins he's ever had. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

My 3-year-old and I liked these.  I cut the recipe in half (3/4 a large zucchini, 1 small apple, 2 eggs, 1/2 C sugar, etc), which only made 9 muffins (filled the papers most of the way.)  They were not quite finished baking at 25 minutes.  We both said they taste good, and they're soft and moist. They need to cool fully before eating so they won't stick to the muffin papers.  I agree that adding chopped walnuts would make them better.

Delicious! A little like a fairly dense apple cake. Mine got sticky on top, but probably because I had to transport them with a lid before they cooled completely. I can't wait 'til the second batch gets out of the oven!

I added a dash of nutmeg and will probably add some walnuts next time.  Very moist and even better the next day.  Will definitely make again.

Pretty tasty, and kid-approved! I subbed cinnamon applesauce for half the oil and added a pinch each of allspice and nutmeg. Mine turned out moist, not dense, but I used about half a cup more shredded zucchini/apples than the recipe called for, so my batter was fairly watery. Filling the muffin cups about 3/4 full worked well. They're also popular as mini muffins (bake time about 14 minutes).

Like others, I added spice: a couple of rounded tablespoons (probably almost 3, if level) of pumpkin pie spice.  And, some salt.  I also cut back on the oil, and added some plain yogurt.  And, I toss walnuts into just about any muffin batter. So moist, so tasty, SO making these again. And, again... :)

Uhhh SO yummy!!! I followed the recipe as it looked pretty solid, except I didnâ€™t measure my zucchini or apple... I did peel both (2 small green apples and one whole zucchini) and pulsed them in the Ninja until slightly more than sliced (you donâ€™t want them juicy) I also love wheat flour so I used 1c wheat and 1 1/4 white. I did add the extra cinnamon because we are cinnamon people!

Definitely 5 Stars!  I did not have enough cinnamon on hand so, I used 1/2 t each of ginger, cloves & nutmeg and barely more than a T of cinnamon. Flavor is good but more cinnamon would be better. So for next time make sure I have plenty on hand.

This was a good recipe. The cinnamon added just enough extra flavor. I added two apples only because I love big bold flavors. I would make this again for sure.

The recipe is great.  The muffins are moist and delicious.  I find it can use some more zing, which is why I'm giving it a four star.

I'm using it now as a base, but cutting back on the cinnamon for freshly ground nutmeg and adding diced apples along with the shredded to give it more apple flavour and texture.  

This recipe makes a great loaf and I think I prefer that over the muffins.  Pour the batter into a well-buttered loaf pan and bake at 350F for about 55 minutes.   Moist and light and absolutely yummy!

They are so moist, make sure to freeze or refrigerate them right away .

I was looking for an apple muffin recipe to make for my baby and since this one had zucchini in it I figured that would be a bonus! Because I was making these for my 9 month old I left out the sugar. Still delicious! He loves them! So happy I found this recipe, I think it would work with carrots in place of the apple too and that's what my next batch will be!

These were good-but next time I would add salt. The flavor was slightly bland without salt.

As I was short of zucchini I halved the recipe.  I used two eggs and baked it in a small loaf pan for about 25 mins. at 350o. This was a very light, moist loaf and I will be making this on a regular basis.  Definitely 5 stars.

I used 2 full tablespoons of cinnamon and added 1 teaspoon each of ground cloves and ginger and 2 teaspoons of nutmeg.

I think if I make it again I'll add a little more cinnamon and maybe some kind of chopped nuts.

I made the whole recipe with one change to it.  I did not want the muffins to be dense, so I used the trick I found in another recipe, "Abbys Super  Zucchini Loaf" in order to purge the zucchini of water.  After that I followed the recipe as it is written.  They were delicious and did not last a day in my house.

This one's a winner. I baked the muffins at 375F for 20 minutes instead of 350 for 25 minutes. And I added 1/4 cup of miniature chocolate chips. The muffins came out moist and flavorful and totally delicious. Even my picky daughter, Miss "I hate all fruit and most vegetables," loved them. I am keeping this recipe.

I substituted 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 3/4 cup of white sugar instead of using all white sugar and also added 1/4 tsp of ground nutmeg and 1/2 tsp of salt. I dusted each muffin with 1/2 tsp of cinnamon sugar before baking. The muffins were moist and light and tasted wonderful. Will definitely add these  to our family recipe favorites.

Had zucchini from the garden and apples from our tree and thought what the heck? I substituted half the flour with whole wheat and 1/3 cup oil and 1/3 cup of homemade applesauce. I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar. I made them in my stand mixer and they  turned out moist, not too dense and not too sweet. I will add nutmeg and all spice next time. Also it made 17 muffins not 24. My kids hate zucchini and they gobbled them up this morning!

I made these a bit healthier with the following changes and they still turned out perfect!
1.5 c. all purpose flour, 3/4 c. whole wheat flour.
1 T. cinnamon
1/2 c. white sugar, 1/2 c. brown sugar
1/3 c. oil, 1/3 c. applesauce
2 eggs, 1 T. milk
2 tsp vanilla
I used an electric mixer to combine wet ingredients, then folded in dry ingredients.  Just made 17 muffins though.

These really deserve a three and a half. They're good for you, particularly if you make the changes I made - replace half the oil with applesauce and use light whole wheat flour. But I found them moist to the point of unpleasantly dense, and even with the addition of nutmeg and allspice, they were still a little bland. Still, the kids did eat them, and it's a breakfast I'm happy to give them, so that counts for plenty.

DELICIOUS!!!  I cut the recipe in half (and used one organic zucchinni and one organic apple, and two eggs), to make one dozen muffins.  Also, needed to add about 10 minutes to the bake time.  And I used parchment baking cups.  The muffins turned out wonderfully moist  and airy.  Fantastic flavor!!

After going apple picking today, I made these with my fresh picked honeycrisps. I used whole wheat flour and substituted half the sugar for 1 1/2 tbsp. fresh honey (cut oil down to 1/2 c. because of the added liquid). I also added some ginger and nutmeg. After the first batch came out of the oven, I added more of the spices to the rest of the batter.  This is a delicious, lightly sweet, packed little muffin. I'm definitely looking forward to this autumnal breakfast treat. As with other reviews, if I would have had them on hand, chopped pecans and raisins would have been great additions!

These muffins turned out full of flavour, moist, and soft. My muffins often turn out too dense, so I was careful to not overmix. I used 3/4 cup sugar, subbed 1/3 cup coconut oil + 1/3 cup oil, and I added a splash of almond extract and a dash of cardamom and allspice to round out the flavour. Delicious.

The apples and cinnamon really make this special! It's a great muffin under 200 calories! Not over powering sweet!  Nice and dense.  Very satisfying! A great little cheat! I will share this with friends and will make it again!

I like the taste, but I was hoping for them to be more like a banana cupcake, but they turned out very dense.
Hardly any air in them.

Baking them now. I'm giving this a five because I know they're going to be great!
