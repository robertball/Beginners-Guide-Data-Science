Fantastic! These are just like mom used to make. They are melt-in-your-mouth good. Since the recipe doesn't tell you how many or what kind of nuts to use, I find that 2 c. finely chopped pecans works great. I filled them with vanilla frosting dyed red and green for Christmas and they were delicious and pretty to look at! Thanks.

These are very good cookies! I needed to add a little more flour so they were not sticky to roll, and filled the cookies with the jam before baking.

These are, hands down, my favorite Christmas cookies.  Light and buttery and not overly sweet which makes filling them with  tinted sugar cookie frosting perfect.  I don't think the egg white dip is necessary if your nuts are chopped finely enough, especially if using walnuts which are fairly moist after you chop them.

This is a very good tasting and easy recipe. I did find out that you really don't need to dip them in the egg whites. I made my first batch dipping them and rolling sprinkles on the edges it was an ugly mess . so i tried rolling the dough into a log after chilling it for about a half hour than just rolling the log in sprinkles and slicing them into about half inch cookies it worked out so much bettter and they look really good.

Fabulous!  I rolled the cookies in chopped pecans and filled with raspberry jam!  Everyone who tried them LOVED them!  I also did a batch with chopped walnuts - they were good too, but not nearly as good as with the pecans.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I was looking for a recipe to compare to cookies a co-worker used to make.  These looked really close so I decided to try.  I'm glad I did; however, it does need about 1/4 to 1/2 cup more flour otherwise they are very sticky and hard to roll.  I just scooped out with a small ice cream scoop (after a failed attempt to roll) and indented as directed.  They came out perfect!  I added almond flavoring to plain white canned frosting...excellent!

This is an awesum recipe. My grandmother used to make this when I was little and she's been gone a long time and decided to make them to honor her. We use all flavors of jams in them and love them all especially apricot.

Excellent recipe!  I followed the other reviewers tips and added 1/4 C more flour and did not bother with rolling the dough balls in egg white.  I let the dough chill in the fridge overnight.  We like frosting for ours, so I made a quick glaze-type frosting with butter, powdered sugar, milk and food coloring.  I used the rounded side of a melon baller to create the well in the center, so it would hold the frosting without running out the sides of the cookie.  My husband has been asking for years, for me to make thumbprints and he LOVED these.  Will definitely add these to my holiday cookie repetoire.

Rich buttery cookies, just what I wanted for a holiday cookie. I used a cream cheese frosting.

Did not care for the consistency of the cookie, and it just didn't taste good.

Will not try these again.

I made these cookies for a special event at church, and I must say, I was disappointed.  The cookies took at least 10 minutes to get even slightly brown, and I didn't roll them in nuts because the nuts weren't listed in the ingredients.  I put the jam in before baking, and I think that worked out fine.  Unfortunately, I thought the cookies were OK but sort of tasteless. I probably will look for another recipe before making these again.

Delicious!!!  I rolled them in chopped pecans and filled them with rasberry jam.  They look amazing and taste so great.  Mine baked more like 12 minutes before they lightly browned, thanks for the recipe!

Mother in law used to make these for Christmas every year, now that she is gone, I felt the need to find a recipe for them. I asked my husband what he honestly thought, he smiled and said he thought he would never have them again. Both my boys really liked it. I must have made them too big (I thought they were regular size) because I had to cook mine for at least 13-14 minutes. I put jelly (peach preserves to be exact) on before cooking, not sure if that made a difference. Also didn't use the egg yolks, just kind of rolled the nuts into the ball as I rolled the ball.

Totally flat. Followed recipe  exactly. This recipe is missing baking powder, or baking soda, or both. Or, maybe the dough needs to be refrigerated for a while prior to baking. Dunno.

I've been looking for this recipe for years and am so thankful to have found it! Minor tips, no need to use the egg whites.  Chill dough for 20 minutes before baking to prevent them from flattening.  Use a royal icing to finish them off, no need for sprinkles. Thanks for the recipe!!!

I liked this cookie recipe.  I gave it a 4 because I did want to tweak it. Easy and not too sweet.  I do think I will try adding a little more sugar next time, I also put the jelly on before baking the cookie, it was a nice finish.  Also, I added the nuts (walnuts) good and pretty too.

I made these with a dollop of home made peach preserves, and they were excellent.  I thought that the cooking time was too short, and ended up baking the cookies for 12-13 minutes.  I also found I had to let them cool slightly on the pan before moving them, as they were rather delicate.  I will make these again for Christmas, for sure!  They're too rich for an every day treat.
