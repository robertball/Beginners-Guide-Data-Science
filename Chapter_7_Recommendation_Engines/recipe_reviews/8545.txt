This was wonderful. I will make this again. As recommended by other reviewers, I doubled the sauce, and I only added 1/2 tsp of pepper. I also cooked it for about 40 minutes, and I disolved a spoonful of corn starch in about 1/3 cup of cold water and added right at the end of cooking. This made a nice thick sauce. I made rice and broccoli as recommended. After dinner, I just put all the leftovers, (chicken, sauce, rice, and broccoli) in one bowl and brought it for lunch today. It was really good all mixed up too! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was very good, but nothing exceptional. I took others' advise and tripled the sauce without tripling everything, and I'm glad that I did. 9 Tbs. ketchup, 6 Tbs. soy sauce, 5 1/2 Tbs. white sugar, 6 Tbs. lemon juice, 1 1/2 tsp black pepper. This was perfect. Not too sweet and not too hot. The reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because serving this dish with rice is a must and should have been included that way. The recipe should have at least doubled the sauce, as well. I also cubed my chicken because it looked so tasty in the photos that way. I think my changes are what made this dish a success. Overall, served over rice with brocolli and a nice loaf of French bread, this meal was a hit with my family.

Excellent! I tripled the sauce recipe, and it was perfect. I did, however, when tripling the sauce, cut the sugar by a third (6 tbl instead of 9) and added a handful of sliced mushrooms at the end. This is fast, easy, and delicious. I served with white rice and broccoli. Will make mashed potatoes next time. Thanks for the comfort food!

Well we liked that one! I didn't put the sugar in at all because we don't like sauces to be too sweet. Only wish there was more sauce...it all seems to reduce too much so next time I will make more sauce for it. Thumbs up!

I named this Sweet & Zesty Chicken. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and made more sauce than suggested because we love sauce on our rice. I did 1/2 c + 1 Tbs. ketchup, 1/4c + 2Tbs. soy sauce. 1/4c sugar, 1/4 + 2Tbs vinegar because I didn't have lemon juice. Other than that i followed it exactly and it came out GREAT!! i'll definitely be saving this one and tweaking it some more. I served it over Basmati rice!! SO  GOOD!!!

This was pretty good. I scaled the recipe down for two people, but ended up needing to make enough sauce for four people in order to have enough to simmer. Next time I make it, I'll probably substitute Worchestershire sauce for the soy sauce, which will essentially make it a BBQ chicken recipe.

I'm not a big fan of chicken but I really liked this!  I left out the oil and used cooking spray to grease my skillet and I chopped up the chicken in small pieces before browning it.

I was looking for a cheap dish to make and found this. Doubled the sauce but kept the sugar amount the same. If made next time, will decrease sugar or omit.

This is a really good recipe for a simple, easy to prepare midweek meal. I used diced chicken breast pieces (I think these stay moister when cooked like this on the stove top) and tripled most of the sauce ingredients (apart from the sugar and pepper) as others had suggested. I also added some chopped peppers (1 red, 1 green) to up the veggie count and add some colour and crunch. I think most veggies would work well (even something like canned pineapple). The sauce had a good consistency and was tangy and savoury without being overpowering; I will try adding chilli flakes or a chopped red chilli next time, for a spicier flavour.  Thanks for the recipe - I'll definitely be making this one again! :)

Quick, easy, and delicious!  Made as is, but doubled the sauce - and recommend doing that.  Served over jasmine rice with veggie on the side. Yum!

I made this w/ 4 big chicken legs, that's all the chicken we had.  It was sooo good!  My husband loved it!  The meat was falling off the bones, the sauce was so good!  Oh, also I didn't have lemon juice so used lime.  Tasted so good!!!!

This recipe was delicious.  I tripled the recipe and because my chicken breasts were originally pre packaged frozen ones there was plenty of water from them and so I cooked them with the cover off the whole time.  Served it on rice and had stir fry vegetables with them.

It was "okay," nothing spectacular. I could have opened up a bottle of bbq sauce and it would have been a great deal easier. We tripled the sauce, ate it over rice with green beans. I will probably make it again in a pinch, since I always have the ingredients on hand.

Loved this sauce but I double or tripple it.  Add a bag of frozen stir-fry vegetables. I liked plenty of onion with it.

Yes, it was easy.    I made the recipe as written but  doubled the sauce.  Sauce flavor was bland and tasted like a cheap bottled mix.

I was not expecting this chicken to be as flavorful as it was! I chose this recipe because I had all the ingredients, and it would be ready in about 30 mins. I doubled the sauce like other reviewers suggested, and it turned out just fine. This is definitely a quick, easy recipe.

A good recipe.  It's really, really fast and unfussy.  One bad thing - if you make it as directed you will wind up with something VERY hot due to so much pepper.  I will significantly reduce the amount of pepper the next time I make this, probably to 1/4 teaspoon as someone previously suggested.

I thought it was really good, but just kind of like a glorified bbq sauce.  I think if I were strapped on time, I'd just as well dump some bbq sauce on my chicken and cook it.  But it was really good.

Yummy, easy, very salty (will use less soy sauce next time).  Would recommend doubling sauce as many other reviews also suggested.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I tripled the sauce and it made a good amount to pour over the rice and chicken.  Before adding the chicken to the pan, I cut it into thick slices (didn't want to cut into cubes right away and risk it overcooking or drying out before the sauce reduced).  About 5 minutes before it was done, I chopped it into cubes and threw back into the sauce, and the chicken stayed very juicy and evenly flavored.  I really enjoyed the flavors, with brown rice and steamed broccoli, but my boyfriend said it had a little too much of a kick that covered the natural flavor of the chicken.  He still ate seconds, so it couldn't have been that bad.  It definitely does have a kick, so maybe next time I'll add less pepper and soy to adjust it to his tastes.

This was very peppery but we loved it. I also tripled the sauce plus I used half olive oil and half chili oil which gave it just the right amount of kick and then sprinkled on some five spice. Sooo good!

By the way: If you want to prevent the sauce from reducing too much be sure to keep the lid on while simmering. The lid keeps the steam in. Vice versa if you want a thicker sauce.

I doubled the sauce and mixed in a spoonful of cornstarch with 1/4 cup water at the end.  it was good, but I felt it could have used some more garlic and maybe red pepper.  Good recipe, though.  Fast and easy.

Excellent recipe!! It's hard to believe such 'common' ingredients combine to make such a delicious dish.  Definitely double the sauce--that's the only change I made & this one definitely goes into the dinner rotation.  Thanks for sharing!

So exciting to see my recipe ! I did add when I submitted this dish that the original recipe did not have enough sauce and I suggested to double or triple according to your preference. I agree it's too much pepper. I like all the suggestions of different spices or vegetables to try. It's simple, kid friendly and I'm glad it's liked by many of you !

We liked the taste and my 6 year old granddaughter loved it too.  I sautéed 1 chopped garlic clove with the chopped onion, and added 1 chopped red bell pepper.

As suggested I tripled the sauce except for the sugar and pepper and we liked it that way. We like sauce so I was glad I read the reviews first.  As suggested I reduced the sugar to 3 TBS and used 1/4 TSP of ground pepper.  It was perfect for us.  I cooked the broccoli separately and added to the cooked onions and red pepper to serve.  I prepared a  Jasmine Asian Rice because we like a slightly sticky rice and this one is perfect.  I thought 6 TBS of soy sauce was too much and would be too salty so for the triple recipe sauce, I used 3 TBS soy sauce and 3 TBS worcestershire sauce.  My family loved it.  My husband said it was "excellent" that way.  My granddaughter loves chicken and she thought it was the best tasting chicken.

The recipe was a go with the family. I tripled the sauce. As suggested by many. However,I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. Also, I added a roux at the end. Which I made by melting one tbsp of unsalted butter and 1 tablespoon of flour.To thicken the sauce.Instead of making a side vegetable I added 2 bags of stir-fry mix to the chicken last ten minutes of cooking time and served it over brown rice. I will make this again.

Followed the suggestions and tripled the recipe (all except the sugar, used 3Tb). Served with Jasmine rice (with a bit of lemon zest tossed in), family polished it off in record time :) 
Will DEFINITELY be doing this one a few more times

Made some minor changes to the recipe. I dont use that much oil for one. I added a table spoon of korean pepper paste (guchujang). I think I added a little bit more lemon juice until I got a sweet and sour kind of taste. It turned out great. My boyfriend loves this chicken. I've made this recipe twice...in one week :]

Very good.  I used green onion in the recipe and then added a more green onion tops when it was done cooking. 
Used diced chicken and doubled the sauce.

I enjoyed this bbq chicken recipe. I was worried while making the sauce thinking it was going to be too sweet but as the sauce cooks it mellows out. Its still sweet but not overly. I did add some garlic powder and dried parsely. I will be adding this to my low carb collection. ty.

Made this exactly as written and it was good. A little too sweet for my taste so next time I will cut down on the sugar, but a good twist to chicken that I will definitely use again.

Appropriately titled- so quick and easy!  I left out the olive oil to cut fat and calories- just sprayed the pan with Pam.  I doubled the sauce as suggested by others.  Next time I will double the sauce except for the pepper.  2 tsp was too much.  Will definitley make again.

This recipe rocks!   I've made this dish about 10 times and we have it every week or two.  I prefer to use 2 lbs. of boneless chicken thighs rather than breasts (thighs come out much juicier).  The sauce is unbelievable -  it's almost like a homemade sweet and spicy barbecue sauce.  I ALWAYS double the sauce.  You need to try this recipe!

This is quick and easy....and good!  At first I couldn't figure out what type of cuisine it's supposed to be - American, Chinese, BBQ?  I decided to take a Chinese spin on it.  I cut the chicken in bite-sized pieces, doubled the sauce, added some green onions for color and served over rice.  We gobbled it up!  By cutting the chicken up, it made it even quicker - it only had to cook for about 10 minutes.  It reminds of the Szechwan Shrimp recipe on this site.  Next time I might ease up on the ketchup and add garlic and ginger root.

This is a very quick and tasty dish! My husband and I both really enjoyed it!  I put it together with a couple of Chinese dumplings and frozen sweet potato fries.  This will be a great staple in our house.  If I can figure out how to get the sauce to thicken after cooking and use it as a dipping sauce or glaze afterwords that would be even better!

Yum! I served this with vegetable rice medley (also from this site) and it was a big hit. The only thing is....too much pepper! I reduced it to 1/2 tsp, and we still thought it was too much. Next time I will use only 1/4 tsp. Nonetheless, a very tasty dish.

This was good for a quick dinner, just as it implies.  I added celery and was glad I did and I had plenty of sauce with two chicken breasts.  It isn't necessarily something I would put together for company but it's great for a fast meal.

I had a hard time getting the chicken to brown, other than that it was very good.  We also thought the sauce would be equally as good on beef or pork.

This is an excellent recipe. It is extremely easy and delicious. The kids liked it because it is sweet; they just pushed the onions to one side. 

I served the chicken on a bed of wilted spinach with sauce spooned over the top and a wild rice mixture on the side. Wonderful.

Delicious!!! I didn't have soy sauce so I substituted Worcestershire and added garlic & onion powder and a few shakes of cayenne. This was very reminiscent of sweet & sour sauce, next time we might try shrimp. I also threw in some carrots and zucchini but any veggie would be great in this. I to doubled the sauce. Very easy dinner!!!!

Great simple recipe.  Sometimes simple is best.  Could also substitute orange or lime juice for the lemon for variations.   And I would male this with cubed chicken to increase the surface of sauce exposure

Very tasty and tangy. I cut the chicken to cook in bite sized pieces and served over rice. Once made I decided to add some canned pineapple and it went well together. I also doubled the sauce and it was nice and saucy to cover the rice.

Easy and delicious! This is my go-to recipe whenever I have guests over but don't have too much time to attempt something fancy. My friends always love this, plus the recipe does not require any fancy ingredients. My dinner guests that day included a pescatarian friend so I modified this recipe to cook fish fillets instead. The result was amazing and everyone were fighting to pack the leftovers home!

This chicken turned out phenomenal!! The only change I'm going to make the next time I make it is just half the black pepper.  I'm not a huge fan of the flavor and it was very pepper-y.  Super tasty, though.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

It was simple and easy to make.  I would double the sauce next time and cut the pepper in half.

quick and easy fits this recipe perfectly.  i took some other tips  and made extra sauce.  I also added a few stir fry veggies, but even if i didn't add the veggies it would still be great.   Will be making this on those busy nights, because it was ready in about 20 minutes

This was quick and delicious! I was out of soy sauce, so I substituted it for teriyaki sauce, used lime juice instead of lemon, and cut the chicken into chunks to mix with the rice. I also added bell peppers with the onions. This is definitely a recipe I will be using in the future.

I love how easy this recipe is. I happen to really hate onions so I left out the onion and oil bit but that's just me. I also like having a lot of sauce so I usually double the sauce and I cut back on the sugar a little bit. Easily one of my favorite fast recipes.

sauteing the onions took the longest, but other than that this was quick and easy! I doubled the sauce (kept the sugar amount the same) and added in some hot and spicy mrs. dash as well as a few squirts of mustard. I would definitely make this again!

made it yesterday, it was all right. i just hate how much sugar the recipe calls for(sugar/salt overdose imo). of course most things that taste awesome aren't the healthiest.... i'll probably make this once in a while tho, pretty easy/great tasting for those busy work days. i also cubed my chicken and added peas when almost done. served w/ white rice = win.

I give this 3 stars only because it was good, but just tastes like BBQ chicken. I only made 2 breasts, but still doubled the sauce since many reviewers said too. I still think you need more. Also be careful if you add the sauce to the pan after cooking the chicken. I let my pan cool for a few minutes and it still burned to the bottom. I ended up just finishing the chicken with the sauce in the oven. Overall though, it was alright. I would make it again in pinch since it is easy and doesn't require many ingredients.

The only good thing about this recipe is that the chicken was moist but it was too greasy. I doubled the sauce as some reviewers suggested but the leftover "sauce" was swimming in oil. I did not enjoy the taste of the sauce either so I will not be making again.

My husband and I were not big fans of this recipe. The sauce is just not our style. I normally love sweet stuff but not with this recipe. Do not think I will try and cook again. It is definately tolerable to eat though!

I am always on the lookout for chicken recipes that require minimal preparation, so I can run home from work and have dinner ready without much planning ahead of time.  This was it, plus it was tasty!  My husband and I had this for dinner over white rice and loved it.  Leftovers the next day were a great lunch, too!

This was good!  It needed a little brown sugar and worcestershire added, and really did NOT need the sauce doubled (but I did thicken it) - we ate it with broccoli and rice for a quick dinner for two.

Wonderful flavors!  I tripled the sauce and added a little cornstarch to thicken it 5 mins before the end.  Served over brown rice, this was a WINNER!

Wow... this was very good. I followed trinawittler (below) measurements for the sauce and it was AWESOME!! I think the only thing I may try differently is to cut back just a little on the soy sauce- just a personal preference. I also think I may want to try adding some pineapple and pineapple juice just to see how it would taste. I will definately be making this one again.  :)

As written I think this recipe has way too much pepper (I would cut the amount in half), and it's not enough sauce. I made it with one chicken breast and a little bit of carrots and green beans thrown in, and it was just enough sauce, so I would have to at least double, maybe triple, with 4 chicken breasts.  With those changes this would be a 4 or 5 star recipe.  I also thought this would have more of a Chinese sweet and sour flavor, but it really had more of a bbq flavor.  Still very tasty, and will make again though!

I'm giving this two stars, because it wasn't God awful but it certainly wasn't as great as the other reviews have claimed. And what's up with those that give it 4 stars and then say "it was just ok"? This would be a great recipe for a child to make and enjoy. I thought it was pretty crappy and too sugary (and I used only a bit of sugar.) It just lacked depth of flavor. For those that said it was a glorified bbq sauce: You are correct. I will say that by basically frying the chicken first and then simmering it, this makes for a really juicy meat.

Very good recipe. I think I improved it substantially by following other comments.  I tripled the sauce, added a tbsp of cornstarch in cold water at the end, and I also added chopped fresh garlic when I was sauteing the chicken (which I chopped up before cooking). I ran out of soy sauce after the second serving of sauce so I used Worcestershire for the last measurement.    Served with basmati rice and corn. I would make this again, with the revisions I used.

Quick & Easy, just as its name says!!! Definite weeknight dinner!!!! My husband LOOOOVED it!!!! 4 stars because the sys is not enough to make it simmer, but as others have said, I doubled the sauce without doubling the sugar & pepper... pretty good! My only concern is its a bit high on the sugar side.... next time I'm going to try with Light Agave Nectar for a healthier version.   Also I did do as one reviewer said, and diluted 1 tsp of cornstarch in 1/4 cup of H20 and added it at the end, and continued to simmer a bit.... the thicker sauce was delicious...

As many have done, I doubled the sauce, and cut up the chicken. It had a strange flavor, and even my always hungry DH shoved his plate away before it was empty. Will not make again, sorry.

I followed the previous reviews and tripled the recipe.  Good thing, because it was such a hit.  I have 3 picky daughters and this is the first "new recipe" I have ever made that they all liked.    We will certainly be using this recipe again.

This was great!  (And truly quick and easy).  I was worried about the amount of sugar in it, but it wasn't too sweet at all.  I made two changes:  I diced my chicken breasts into large chunks before cooking, and I added only 1/2 the amount of black pepper it called for.  We'll definitely make this again and again!

This was great!  I did double the sauce and was glad I did because I had enough to flavor the rice.  My kids liked it too.  I will definitely make this easy and GREAT recipe again.  And the house smelled great, too.  I never knew a recipe with ketchup could taste so good.

This is a great weekday recipe!! I followed other reviews suggestions regard the fine pepper, and I only used 1/2 of a vadalia onion. a whole onion was too much for our tastes. We really liked it, will definately make this again and again!! Thanks for the recipe.

I used chicken tenders and served this with rice pilaf. I added a pinch of oregano as well. Although the chicken came out very tender, I thought the sauce was too tart. Next time, I may omit the lemon juice.

Great recipe! Lots of flavour, sweet but not too sweet. I decided to use 2 bone-in chicken breasts, but I boiled them for a little bit beforehand to make sure they would cook through.  I made the amount of sauce that the recipe suggested and I found there was just enough to coat the chicken.  I would probably add a bit more sauce though next time I make it.  Didn't have any lemon juice on hand, so I used a half a lime and it was still delicious.

The sauce will NOT cover the chicken unless you double the recipe.  Several people have metioned this and really, it's important! I customizd the recipe to one serving and as expected, it took less time to cook as well.  The onions carmelized...tasty!

This was a big hit with my family!  I doubled the sauce too and served it with rice.  For those wanting to cut back on carbs, use Splenda instead of sugar and serve it with zuchinni, squash and bell peppers instead of rice.  I'll be making this again and sharing the recipe with family and friends.

I just love this recipe, I'm not known for my cooking ability but this dish really is, as the name suggests, quick and easy, it goes down a storm! I've done this recipe a few times now and and have discovered that if you make twice the sauce you neeed and bring it to the boil twice, the onions and the sauce will become thick and caremelised, this, in my opinion, is not entirely a bad thing!!!

This was such a great meal. I made it over rice and almost tripled the sauce. My 5 year old loved it and has asked me to make it everyday since i made it last (5 days ago). It's the perfect meal to make on a lazy kinda day.

This recipe is easy to make & VERY delicious! Just serve it over rice. You don't need anything else it's that good & filling. The first time I made it my husband couldn't get enough! He actually asked me to make it again 2 days later. So I did!

This was good for a really quick meal.  I did what other reviewers suggested and doubled/tripled the sauce (I just eyeballed it to taste).  This was good with some rice and veggies.  My husband will probably eat the leftovers for lunch.  Will definitely place this in rotation for weeknight meals.

Super easy and doesn't take long, but I would start it first. I, like most others, doubled the sauce, not hard I just eyeballed it. The ingredients are so complimentary it doesn't have to be exact. Also I was out of lemon juice so I used some margarita mix. Family loved it. Thank you for sharing the recipe Anny!

I was surprised how good this really was. I also tripled the sauce using only 2 tsp of black pepper, but it was a little too spicy for my kids. I will definitely make again with less pepper. I diced up the chicken and served it over rice.

This was a very good dish and took no time to prepare. I took the advise of other reviewers and I tripped the sauce amount by using 9 Tbs. ketchup, 6 Tbs. soy sauce, 5 1/2 Tbs. white sugar, 6 Tbs. lemon juice, and 1 1/2 tsp black pepper.I also diced up the chicken in small cubes and cooked it that way instead of in big pieces. The chicken and sauce went excellently served over a bowel of white rice. I also had broccoli on the side but next time I might try sauteing the broccoli with the yellow onion and cooking it with the chicken in the sauce instead of having it separate. Overall, I really liked this recipe and would definitely make it again. This will be a go to recipe on those busy work nights. :)

This is definitely quick and easy, although I don't know about the whole "under thirty minutes" thing.  I too cut the chicken into cubes before cooking it and I think it was a good decision!  This was delicious served over rice.  It has a nice tangy flavor.

Nice quick chicken recipe for a weeknight.  I doubled the sauce, per advice from previous reviewers.  It was good, but I thought it was much too sweet---closer to a syrup than a sauce.  My husband has a sweet tooth and loved the sauce.  He said I should make just the sauce to keep on hand for dipping.  Next time, though, I will reduce the sugar content when making this again.

I made it tonite for the second time.  My husband &  I enjoyed it again.  I changed out the Ketchup both times.  Canned whole Cranberries the first time.  This time I used my homemade Bar-B-Q sauce.  I omitted the sugar both times.  Served with rice is the best.  I also omitted the black pepper,  because I have spices my sauce.  This recipe is now part of favorites.

This recipe is delish! I don't cook very often (okay I don't cook normally at all) but this recipe was actually very easy to follow and turned out great. I didn't have any lemon juice when I made this the first time so I just added water in its place and instead of black pepper I had to use white pepper for I was out of it as well. I also wanted to add a bit of kick to it since I enjoy spice so I added a pinch of red pepper flakes and the results were fantasic! I also add a tablespoon of cornstarch to some water and throw that in at the end to thicken the sauce since I like thicker sauces. I've made this recipe many times since and have found I like it better with the spice than with the tangy taste, however it tastes very good either way and I actually cook it often since its one of the few things I can actually cook.

I loved this recipe.  I added a clove of minced garlic to the onions and a bit more ketchup and soy sauce but kept the sugar the same.  I might put even less sugar next time though.  I will probably be making it again since it's so simple

OMG! I am just getting into cooking and found this recipe. I did triple the sauce measurements like the other reviewers did (except for the sugar, I only used 6 tbsps.) I added garlic and other veggies. After browning the onions and chicken I slow cooked it for 2 1/2 hours and added a little corn starch to thicken the sauce. And my husband also loved it! He said this one's a keeper. Thank you for the recipe - it is really easy and very tasty!

Great, easy recipe. I like the person who named this "Sweet N Tangy chicken" Great name for it. I used boneless, skinless tenderloins since i knew that i was going to chop it up (about 8 tenderloins) I doubled the sauce as suggested and used the tip from another review to double sauce: 9 Tbs. ketchup(half a cup + 1 Tbs), 6 Tbs. soy sauce, 5 1/2 Tbs. white sugar, 6 Tbs. lemon juice, 1 1/2 tsp black pepper.  Also, I seasoned my chicken while it was cooking with onion powder, garlic salt and pepper. I also chopped the chicken in the pan before adding the sauce. Again, great easy recipe. Served over rice with a side of broccoli.

This is a really simple and fairly quick recipe.  My picky, sick of chicken boys had seconds! I agree on double the sauce, just not the sugar and its a keeper!

I've been looking for something easy, fast and something everyone would love. This was a winner! All my kids ate it and 2 out of 4 are picky eaters. I even threw some stir fry vegetables in it and they ate it all.  I did what others suggested and tripled the sauce and I'm glad I did.

Quick & Easy Chicken Haiku: "Way too peppery. I also doubled the sauce, didn't change a thing." Scaled the ingredients up to twice the amount so there would be additional sauce to spoon over rice and veggies, but it was way too peppery; daughter wouldn't touch it, and as far as hubs and I were concerned, it might as well have just been BBQ sauce, which would've been alot easier to prepare (as in, open bottle, pour.) Looks like alot of the reviews have changes for this, but I made it as written, and wouldn't make it again w/o significant changes, although I will say that the method and timing resulted in a rather moist chicken which was nice, but texture doesn't win points over flavor for me.

Not great, not bad, only ok. Doubled the sauce except the sugar. Won't make again. Tasted like a cross between asian and BBQ.

This turned out to be such a surprise hit!!!  Along with the chopped onion, I chopped 3-4 cloves of garlic and sautéed both in the olive oil.  I doubled the recipe like most reviewers suggested and left the pepper at 1/2 teaspoon, also as suggested.  I had reduced-sodium soy sauce on hand and used it instead of regular soy sauce - it wasn't bland at all and didn't need any additional salt. We had thinly sliced chicken breasts on hand, so total cooking time was cut in half.  This is definitely a keeper; we will be making this dish a lot!

Excellent chicken!  I tripled the sauce according to other reviews, and I cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces.  I served with white rice and broccoli.  My kids went back for seconds and my house smelled wonderful.  Thank you!

We realized we were out of ketchup as we were making the recipe so we substituted with 1 tablespoon of barbecue sauce Kansas City style.  Delicious.

Way too much pepper.  I would reduce it to 1/4 tsp and also, I would double the sauce.  
If it wasn't for too much pepper, I would give it a 5 star rating.

This was good!  I did double the sauce (using only 1/4 c sugar) at the recommendation of other reviewers and added some cornstarch in water near the end to help thicken it.  I also cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces before cooking.  I don't really think doubling the sauce was necessary for my tastes, but the extra did soak nicely into the brown rice!

Overall, it's very easy to make and will reheat nicely for lunches.

Very yummy.  So nice to make something with ingredients I already had on hand.  As others recommended I tripled the sauce ingredients (except the  sugar) Cubed the chicken.  Served with rice, broccoli and asian salad.  Hubby loved it.

Made this exactly as listed. I added just a tad more sugar as we like things a bit sweeter.  Both my picky kids - ages 5 and 4 ate it without complaint! :)

Received this recipe via daily email AllRecipes.com. Gave it a try, following the recipe to the letter except did cube the chicken and doubled the sauce and I have to say, it was great. I cooked this for me and my grandchildren, we all loved it. A neighbor dropped by during dinner, gave it a try and also said it was great, wanted the recipe. It was so good that I believe it deserves it own specific "Identity / Name", something other than Quick and Easy, even though it is just that - Will definitely make this again - Thank you Anny and Allrecipes

This was so yummy! My husband loved it and even was commenting late into the evening on how good it was. I simmered it on medium low and after 25 minutes it was a little too cooked. I used 4 large (Costco) chicken breasts and cut them each in half. I also doubled the sauce and poured it over rice and yummy stir fry veggies.

Great dinner.  I made this before I went to work and put in it the frig.  I heated it up for dinner, so good.  It was quick, easy, and full of flavor.  We used chicken tenders, which cooked fast and the flavorful sauce really melted into the chicken.  I have added this as one of my weeknight dinners.

LOVE IT! I cut the chicken breasts into half inch pieces, and doubled the sauce recipe. I also cooked it for 40 minutes. During the last minute of cooking I added a mixture of 1 tablespoon flour and 1/3 cup of water to thicken the sauce. I served it over white rice and steamed broccoli!

Very Tasty! Yummy and very easy, making a sauce out of things most of us have in the fridge! I used chicken tenders instead of breast halves and added sliced mushrooms and a little garlic. I cut the sugar in half. I think next time I would start browning the tenders, then add the onion and mushrooms. It also has a lot of black pepper, I might cut that back and add a few red pepper flakes instead.

This was very tasty with brown rice and broccoli. I tripled the amount of ketchup, added extra soy sauce (low sodium), and 1 T of honey to make more sauce. I also cubed the chicken. I seasoned the chicken first with pepper and garlic powder. I added diced green onions on top during the last few minutes of cooking. My husband agreed that it was very tasty. DEfinitely will make again.

Saw this in my daily Allrecipes.com emails. Had just over an hour to get dinner ready and served, and it's so quick and easy to prepare and cook! Then had some unexpected guests visit just in time for dinner, thank God I had made extra. Everyone absolutely loved it! When they were done the plates looked just like when we pulled them out of the cabinets, clean and spotless. I think that says it all. I love this recipes because i always have these ingredients on hand, I cannot stress how easy this recipe is. It's a real crowd pleaser and a must try!

This was really good. I also recommend doubling the sauce and adding the corn starch solution ( teaspoon of corn starch dissolved into 1/3 cup cold water) a couple of minutes before serving. Will make again!

This is FABULOUS! I always read reviews. I did triple the sauce as the reviews suggested.  Next time I will quadruple it. Only doubled the sugar though. That sauce is soooo good!!! I used strips instead of breast. Definitely a keeper!!

Yum, yum, yum!! Like many others, I double the sauce but I also cut my chicken into bite-sized pieces before browning. I sometimes also saute some sliced bell peppers with the onion and add pineapple tidbits for a sweet and sour type meal. Either way, this is absolutely delicious!!

I have prepared this easy chicken recipe as an unplanned quick meal.  It was delicious! Since then, I have added vegetables (broccoli florets, carrots) toward the end, allowing the veggies to steam and my family love it!  Has become a favorite, the grandkids even put in requests!

When i first mixed the sauce i wasn't crazy about it, but after it simmered with the chicken it was crazy good! I added chili powder to mine to add a kick and mixed veggies into it post-frying. Super yummy!!!

This was a huge hit with my family! I reduced the sauce to half because i thought it would be too salty and only simmered for a couple minutes. It tasted a bit bland so I added onion powder, more salt and pepper, thime, chopped parsley, and basil flakes
after that it tasted quite good and i served it with brown rice. 
Thanks for this recipe!

My family loved this. I would do what everyone else said and double if not triple the sauce recipe. Next time I will add less pepper because it was just a little to spicy for me.

This was great but even with thick pieces of chicken it was a little overdone. Next time I will cook for less time, and add raisins.

I'm always looking for recipes using chicken breasts since I'm on a perpetual diet.  This was so tasty !  I think I would only double the sauce if I was going to serve it over rice, otherwise there's enough sauce.

Yummy! Didn't have lemon juice or an onion and it still came out good.  Made it for just myself and I had to double the sauce.  I served it over rice.  So simple and quick.

Amazing! My husband made this tonight and served it over grated cauliflower as a paleo alternative to rice - the chicken was seasoned so well and very tender, will make again in the future.

Well my parents and my picky 4 year old loved it. Next time I will use more chicken as I couldn't help "tasting" it as it simmered. I added cayenne pepper though instead of black pepper and doubled everything else but the soy sauce and sugar.

Very good and easy but I added cubed pineapple and a little of the juice to the sauce.  I let it cook in for flavor.  I also steamed broccoli florets and then tossed them in and sauced them before serving.  I will definitely make this again.

Made this tonite for my fiance and I and we loved it.  I didn't use rice instead I used some mashed potatoes and broccoli.  She is begging for me to make more.  I did use the sauce mix for 4 but the chicken amount for 2. Perfect amount :) delicious   wish i would have taken a pic

Family LOVED it, even my picky eater!
I tripled the mixture and held back 2.5 tbsp sugar, it was perfect!
This ends up being a unique sauce, making the chicken super tender and perfect served over rice.
This will be on our menu now, thank you for taking the time to share!

This was very good. I have made this several times and its pretty hard to screw this up. I did make it exactly as is the first time and the taste was great but it was NOT enough sauce. Please, Please triple the sauce! Serve over rice and you have a wonderful dinner recipe!

my family absolutely loved this recipe. I along with others, tweaked it to my liking...I tripled the liquid but still cut a T of sugar out and a T of oil and soy sauce. Only used 1 tsp. pepper total. It was actually delicious. I also cut 4 breasts into chunks.  Great Recipe...It's a keeper.

Yummy and easy. I also doubled the sauce recipe. I added some curry powder for a bit more spice.

I doubled the sauce like other reviews said, and used white wine vinegar instead of lemon juice.  Although I like sauce I thought doubling it was too sweet and heavy for the rice.  Next time I'll follow the portions on the recipe because we liked the flavor. I enjoyed how tender the chicken was cooked in olive oil at a low temp.

This was not our favorite.  I think the taste came out the way it was supposed to, but it's just not a sauce that we care for.  Oh well!

Love this recipe!!  I was doubtful at first, I didnt know if I would like it, but tried it as I had all the ingredients at home and didn't have to go to the store.  It has become one of my favorite "go to" recipes when I am in a pinch. So easy and I have shared it with so many people!  A great find!!!!!

I made this and my family loved it. I don't usually cook because my moms a chef and just likes things "her way" all the time. but she even fell in love with it. it was a little spicy and then savory. It was really good. only thing, when i do make it again i wouldn't cook it as long. otherwise its delicious. yum!

I only used half an onion and used only two chicken breast halves because there was only two of us. also i put in just under a table spoon of sugar. this recipe how ever was amazing I loved it. we also cut up the chicken into small bits so we didn't simmer it nearly as long. but it was delish. P.S. the sauce was plenty no need to add too many calories I'd rather enjoy the meal.

My husband and I were looking for a new recipe to try and we came across this one. The first time we tried it we didn't have any lemons or lemon juice so we used lime juice. It was amazing. It has become one of our favorite dishes to make. It's simple and easy. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a different way to make chicken.

I tripled the sauce and found the sauce to have too much pepper.  Good flavor but next time I will use only half of the pepper...

This was really quick and easy. I took the advice of others and added cornstarch at the end to thicken up the sauce some. I think next time I will use a little less sugar (or maybe omit it altogether) 

I served this as a rice bowl with the rice, chicken, and broccoli.  Very good! Even the kids enjoyed it. I stored the leftovers altogether for what I'm sure will make a great lunch today :)

This is a wonderful recipe.  Many have said to double or triple the recipe for the "sauce"> I totally agree.  I did make one substitution.  My wife can't eat soy products so I substituted balsamic vinegar and it's great.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

Excellent dish - and very easy to make! Doubling the sauce portion makes the perfect amount. Would recommend tripling it if wanting more for all the rice. Added sesame seeds and green onion on top. Made for a friend and both of us were thoroughly impressed. Will make again very soon!

This is a great, easy meal when you're out of ideas. I made this on the stove and took a walk with my son only to come back with the kitchen smelling amazing and the chicken was wonderful. I'd take it off the stove about 5 minutes earlier next time as the chicken was a tad overcooked, but that's my error. My husband also ate the leftovers before they actually became cold leftovers. Hooray!

Pretty good, though the sauce didn't quite penetrate into the meat.  Maybe I should marinate the meat next time.

Decent. I left out the sugar because we don't like sweet sauces. Tasted mostly just like ketchup. Haven't decided if I'll try it again.

Amazing! It has so much flavor. It's incredible to think that all those very different flavors can be put together to make something so stunning! I omitted the onion because I didn't have one, but I'm sure it would taste even better with it! Be sure to double or triple the sauce recipe and serve with broccoli and rice. The BEST!

My family loved this recipe. I took the advice from others and doubled the sauce recipe. I cooked it with mashed potatoes, cornbread and asparagus, it was very good.

I am a long-time baker who's trying to do more cooking. I was drawn to this recipe because it all took place on the stovetop. I loved it! It really lived up to its name, and it was tasty to boot! I wanted a lot of sauce, so after reading other reviews, I doubled the amount of sauce and only made two chicken breasts, which seemed just about right. I also cut the amount of sugar in half, though I don't know that I would have minded the full amount. Next time I might reduce the pepper a little, but I'm also a wimp when it comes to spicy food. This recipe is delicious, satisfying, and so easy that even a beginner can make it!

This was pretty good! I doubled the sauce and used less pepper. I also cut my chicken into bite sized pieces before cooking it and served it with fried rice.

So easy and delicious as well.  The sauce as written was not enough to coat the chicken, but doubling it would have been too much.  So I just ended up squeezing a little more ketchup into the pan and then added a little more soy sauce and lemon juice in.  I didn't add more sugar.  I would say this had an Asian flare to it, and we had it over brown rice.

This was so good and easy! I am so bored of chicken breasts, so I had to try something new, and it worked out great. It was too spicy (peppery) for my toddler, but the rest of us loved it. Thanks.

This was okay. I did double the sauce and did not add as much pepper. The main reason it is good is because it it super easy!

Really great recipe!  didn't add lemon juice (thought I had some but didn't) so I subbed 2 tablespoons pineapple juice.  It tasted great before I added the pineapple juice though!  I tripled the sauce and also tweaked it a bit by adding a 1/2 tspn sesame oil (a little goes a LONG way!) broccoli, a squirt of prepared mustard and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  VERY good!  Will make often!

The title says it all:  Quick and Easy.  Be sure you double the sauce (or triple it if you want to mop it up with some good bread).  I kept the sugar and black pepper the same and doubled all the other sauce ingredients.  I also added some minced garlic to the sauce.  Mine was ready after about 20 minutes of simmering - - maybe that's because I cut my chicken into chunks instead of cooking them whole.  So keep an eye on your skillet.  Thanks, Anny!

This was a tasty recipe and, like the title says, quick and easy. Definitely double the sauce like most people said. Even triple it if you want. Careful of the pepper though. I tripled the recipe but only used half the pepper. I like spicy foods but too much black pepper can kill a meal. It's got plenty of heat with half the pepper.

This recipe was fantastic! I took the advice of the other reviewers and tripled the sauce and also served with white rice and broccoli. This was good the way it is written but I also decided to make with some pineapple chunks and it was FANTASTIC! Thanks for such an easy go to recipe!

The only thing I changed with this recipe was that I added some garlic powder. My son (5 yrs old) is pretty picky and he even enjoyed the taste of it! It was his first dinner he helped cook it was so easy :)

Although I am only giving this 3 stars, it is okay, just not as special as many of the 4 star recipes I have made.  I like that I can make this pretty much any time b/c I usually have all the ingredients and it seems pretty healthy unlike many of the chicken recipes you come across that have loads of cheese and creamed soup in them.

Yummy!  I doubled all ingredients except for the sugar and I didn't add black pepper.  Rather, I let people add red pepper flakes as they liked.  Very quick, very easy, very good!  I used almost a pound of chicken tenders and did add 1 can mushrooms, drained.  This sauce would go well as a sweet and sour sauce.

The amount of pepper, for me, was WAY too much. I ended up scraping the sauce and vegetables to the side because I couldn't eat them. I will say, though, this came together very quickly as a last minute meal - and I'd use it again as a starting point for flavors, but leave out the pepper.

I loved this recipe! It was very flavorful and the chicken was cooked to perfection, very moist. I didn't have soy sauce, so I used General Tso's sauce and I doubled all of the sauce ingredients, as recommended by others. This one is definitely a keeper!

Very good. Use large or medium yellow onion. Definitely double the sauce. Sauce thins out so a thickener might help. Sauce has good flavor. Not too over bearing. Quite tame. Starts out strong then mellows as cooked. Good as is. Bar-B-Que like flavor.

Just as the name says it, it was quick and easy.  My husband is not much into sauces so I didn't double it as others recommended and it was fine.  Also, 25 minutes was way too long, I had to take it off the stove after 20.

This really is quick and easy and very tasty.  I made one minor change.  I added a couple shakes of worchestershire sauce.  I will make this over and over again.

Maybe I did something wrong because everyone else seems to love this recipe but I didn't like it at all.  I ate it for dinner but am throwing away the left overs.  It was like taking a lovely chicken, olive oil, and onion stirfry and ruining it by pouring ketchup all over it.  It was too sweet, too salty and too ketchup-y.

Yes this was pretty good.  I doubled the liquid as others suggested and added some chopped garlic and a few red pepper flakes.  This method of cooking chicken is probably the best never really letting it boil-just simmer...it stays really tender.

Flavorful and tender, this dish is so yummy and delicious! Since I was cooking for just my husband and I, I did double the sauce. I also seasoned the chicken with sea salt, pepper, and garlic powder prior to cooking. The chicken was so most that you didn't even need to use a knife to cut and the sauce carmalized so nicely. This is definitely a recipe I will be adding to the rotation. Oh, and we served it with corn on the cob and a baked potato. A great dinner tonight! Thank you :)

This was really good.  If you have fine ground pepper only use half the recommended amount.  Ours came out really spicy, so the kids were turned off a bit. The adults like it alot!

I liked this recipe.  It was quick and easy (hence the name! lol)to make and I didn't have to turn the oven on.  It is kind of a bbq sauce sweet style.  I served with egg noodles.  After cooking with the lid on I took the lid off to thicken up the sauce.  I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! Love it! I did twice the amount of sauce, and made my own ketchup (because I forgot to buy some at the store....1 cup of tomato sauce with 1/2 cup of sugar, and 2-4 tablespoons of white vinegar), and used sweetener instead of sugar. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Thank you everyone for your reviews on this recipe! If I had followed the recipe exactly, it definitely would have been too spicy for us. I doubled the sauce and only used 1/2 tsp. of pepper. I also substituted teriyaki for some of the soy. Will make again, but probably add some crushed garlic. Thanks for a tasty recipe:)

This was very easy but taste was actually just ok.  I agree on doubling the sauce but it was a bit thin.  If I try it again maybe I will add cornstarch.

Wow was this good; if my family wasn't at the table with me,I was tempted to eat the whole pan full of chicken! While it was simmering it smelled really ketchup-y,but hang in there,because the end result is yummy. I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce recipe,added some garlic powder and a little red wine,and let it simmer about 45 minutes and the chicken was as moist and tender as you could ask for. I made rice along with the chicken,and the sauce was very good on top of it. I will definetly make this again! Thanks for such a wonderful and easy recipe! :) *****Update*** I tried this with boneless Pork Chops and it's just as YUMMY!

This was really good, I even surved it w/ rice like in the picture.  The only changes I made was to cook it in the oven with the sauce on it, I also made extra sauce for the side.

I was looking for a recipe that I actually had all the ingredients for and this one worked.  My husband and I both really liked it.  I doubled the sauce and served it with angel hair pasta and a side veggie.  I will make this again.

This is a pretty good recipe.I agree with prior reviews though that you need to double the sauce in order to have enough to simmer.

This is quite a different dish from your everyday chicken.  When my husband first tried it he said it was "weird but good" Then he asked for seconds and when I asked if I should make this again he said "yes".  This dish was very easy to make.  I followed other reviewer's comments and doubled the sauce, but I was out of lemon juice so I used orange juice, and it worked fine.  I used chicken breast tenders.

The kids, 14 and 11 really enjoyed this tasty quick dish as  did my husband but as he's a leg and thigh man and I'm a bit of a wing girl I had my butcher cut a good sized fresh chook into about 8 pieces and browned them before adding the sauce mix. As other reviewers suggested I doubled the sauce but found it a bit runny so once the chook was cooked I removed it and reduced the sauce a bit. Served with rice and brocoli this was a meal that made my whole picky family happy!!

This is a simple recipe with simple ingredients that you can make last minute.  I used only two chicken breast, but cut them into strips and made the amount of sauce that the recipe states and it came out fine.  The taste is almost like a sweet and sour chicken.  I also added a celery to the onion.  I think you can add almost anything based on what you have in your fridge.  Next time I might try a green onion and a few mushrooms if I have them on hand.  Easy and good, thank you!

I made this when I was packing to move across the state, so I was refusing to buy new groceries!  This is a perfect recipe to make when you have a bare pantry.
Given the ingredients, it was tasty.  I don't think I added enough pepper.  Next time I'd add garlic. 
just like most of the other reviewers said, DOUBLE THE SAUCE.  I did, and I had the perfect amount of sauce.

Great Recipe!  Like everyone said, you need a lot more sauce!  I used about half a bottle of ketchup and adjusted the soy sauce and lemon juice accordingly.  I also sauted with the onions a bag of frozen veggies (broccoli, carrots, bell pepper) for extra flavor.

All I have to say is "WOW" this was so easy to prepare and so delicious.  My husband raves about it!  I serve it over roasted chicken flavored rice but any rice does well.  The only changes I made were that I used 1/2 an onion instead of a whole, half the amount of pepper and a drop more ketchup and lemon juice for more sauce

We loved this recipe! My husband isn't really a chicken fan, but he really enjoyed this. He is also prone to covering everything with hot sauce, and let me just say that the hot sauce didn't make an appearance that night! I have made this several times, and we especially like it with brown rice instead of white.

This recipe is great. I used thighs and leg. Cooked a little longer, about 45 min. I also tripled the sauce. Just enough for the 3 of us. I will make this again and again for sure.

This chicken is great!  I did have to triple the sauce to make enough to cover the chicken.  My boyfriend loved this dish and asks for it all the time, this is a keeper!  Thanks!

This recipe is very easy to follow and the result is exceptionally delicious! This is the first time I cooked chicken all on my own, and that is devastatingly embarrassing to admit considering I am twenty three years old, but I could not have asked for a better or easier recipe to begin cooking!

Made this for dinner tonight and everyone LOVED IT!! I had to make 6 servings so I cooked it in my Dutch oven instead of a frying pan. There was a considerable amount of juice from the chicken so at the end I removed the chicken breasts, turned up the heat and reduced down the sauce to thicken it. That sauce was divine! I also doubled the sauce and added a 1/4 tsp of toasted sesame oil and a 1/4 cup of toasted sesame seeds. We have a new family favorite dinner!

This is an easy recipe that is really great.  I doubled the sauce and it was great with rice.  My wife thought it had pineapple in it, but it doesn't.  This is a keeper.

A few changes.
1. As mentioned by someone else, triple the sauce.
2. Use liquid amionos instead of soy sauce.
3. Cut the chicken into chunks.
4. Serve on top of brown or rice.
VERY DELICIOUS.  ONE OF THE BEST CHICKEN RECIPES.

I really liked this recipe.  It was very flavorful and easy to make.  I am a weight watcher so I cut the olive oil down to 1 tablespoon.  After reading the reviews, I added 1 extra tablespoon of ketchup, soy sauce, and lemon juice to the sauce and used 2.5 tablespoons of Splenda instead of the sugar and 1 tsp. black pepper.  There was plenty of sauce and no need to altar the original sauce recipe.  Next time, I will use the amounts called for in the recipe.

I really wanted to love this recipe, but it was just okay and was way more trouble than it was worth. A friend said it tasted like it couldn't decide between bbq sauce or asian. I tried to save it by adding spices, which helped, but it was a lot of wasted effort. Kiddo ate all the (plain) broccoli, so I'm adding a star for getting my child to eat broccoli.

My husband and I really liked this chicken dish. The sauce is tangy but also sweet and the chicken comes out so moist. The only change I made was that I substituted worcestershire sauce for the soy sauce since I was out of soy sauce. I served the dish with a side of spaghetti and lima beans. Delicious meal!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I’ll use 1/2  tsp black pepper rather than the full amount.  It was really good.

This was a winner.  My household loved the sauce, restaurant quality and would like me to make it again.  As many other reviews stated, the sauce is not enough quantity - so I, too, tripled, the sauce ingredients minus the sugar and it wa delicious and peppery!!

With so few ingredients I was a bit worried this would be too bland.  It was actually quite flavorful.  My hubby seemed to really like it and had a big second portion.  I doubled the sauce to put over the rice and since others had mentioned that the sauce had a tendency to reduce I added about 4 tablespoons of chicken broth prior to simmering.  It was good and I will definitely make this again.

I tried this as a one person meal so I only had one breast to work with so I'm not sure if I didn't make enough sauce for it. I didn't have the onion and decided to use cooking spray for the pan as a result of only having the one breast.

I liked the flavor of the sauce but I cut back on some of the sugar, since there's sugar in the ketchup. Next time I might double it just to have more of the sauce, but it was really easy to make and as someone who hasn't cooked much, I appreciated that.

Very easy and very tasty.  
A quick supper after coming home from a long  day at work. 
I doubled the recipe for extra sauce, but that’s it no changes as it is good just the way it is.
Thanks for posting it !

This was a great recipe. I put it in the crock pot but doubled the sauce just in case I needed more...definitely didn’t need to. Next time I would do a little less sugar because it was pretty sweet but overall it was great served on rice!

We loved this, after reading reviews, I also doubled the sauce recipe and was glad I did as we poured it on the chicken and brown rice. So yummy.

Delicious. I took the advice of the other reviewers and doubled the sauce, halved the sugar, used the juice of one lemon, and added about 1/2 cup water. This was a great sauce and will definitely make it again.

Very easy to make plus the recipe called for ingredients that I already had in my pantry! My kids and husband are picky eaters but they loved this chicken recipe. I served it with oven baked potato wedges and salad. Will make again!

Loved this recipe. it was easy as it said. We had all the ingredients for a last minute meal.
I made it just like the recipe said, well actually made it with my Mom.  We  did let it simmer a bit longer than the recipe said. it was very, very, good.  We made it with 2 1/2  chicken breasts and &  we would used 2 medium onions., that's what we had.
Only changes I would make would be, to add more onion (we  cooked it down but kept it translucent and we felt we would like more sauce, especially if we make it with 4 breasts. We would just like to add a spoonful to each breast for each serving.  Lastly, I would say "MAKE IT!! Easy and very good!!

I've made this many times and love it! I cut 1.5 pounds of boneless chicken breasts into cubes. I sprinkle some salt on to the chicken and onions when I'm cooking them. I just do 1/2 a teaspoon of pepper. Great recipe!

I followed the recipe as written, but I did double the sauce as others had mentioned.  While I really wanted to like this simple and easy recipe, it tasted just like chicken that had been cooked in a bad barbeque sauce.  I just didn't care for it myself.

Very good and easy. I would recommend less ketchup and mire soy sauce. I added garlic and ginger to the sauce. Also added broccoli and red peppers and made like a stir fry!

I made this while getting ready for work and my family loved it. Very quick and easy. Super tasty. I served it over white minute rice (because I was in a major rush) and steamed some broccoli in the microwave. Great meal in 30 min. I will make this again.

I used brown sugar instead of white, that is all I had.  Didn't care for the taste, too much of a ketchup flavor.

Modified for five people. 6 chicken breasts cubed. Tripled sauce, added a teaspoon of chili sauce and added chopped bell pepper and 2 cups of sliced mushrooms. Very good and had left over for lunch next day. Will be adding pineapple chunks next time to make it more a sweet and sour dish.

This dish was so easy to make.  I doubled the sauce ingredients so that we could also add sauce to the pasta served with it.  I cut back a little on the sugar and it still had a good, zesty taste.

Very tasty, very easy.  I made the following changes: 1) Add  1/2 t garlic powder to the sauce; 2) Replace soy sauce with Worcestershire; 3) Replace (and reduce) some of the white sugar with brown sugar (I doubled the recipe and ultimately used 4 T white sugar + 1 T brown sugar). The lemon juice in this is super tasty! Would have been good with rice too.

This was very simple to make and surprisingly good! I cut up the chicken into bite size pieces and the only addition I made was sliced fresh mushrooms. Served with rice and a salad, it was an easy, quick and satisfying meal the entire family loved.

I was looking for a simple recipe for the family pack of chicken breast I had in the fridge. This was perfect for me at the moment because it didnt require me to buy any extra ingredients.  I love recipes that are simple  and have ingredients that are common like ketchup and onions. Nothing fancy. I did make a few changes, I doubled the chicken for my family of four. Plus we love leftovers. Added lots more onion, my hubby and I love onions. I used 2tbsp extra of olive oil since i doubled the chicken. I also added green bell pepper for that added snap in your bite and color. I liked this recipe alot with rice cooked in chicken or veggie broth instead of boring water (rachel ray tip) Yummy and tangy!

I saw this recipe, shopgirl02's review, and the list of ingredients that really made me curious how it would be. My family and I LOVED this recipe! I did however make a minor modification to it by replacing the soy sauce with liquid amino and only used 1\2 tsp pepper. I also doubled the sauce ingredients so there would be more to spoon over the meat and quinoa that we had it over. Thanks for this truly "quick, easy chicken" recipe!!!! :-)

Very nice recipe. I used chicken thighs instead of breast which yielded more water than the breast would be. I used 3 times the sauce and cut back on sugar. Very nice recipe!

Easy and pretty darn good.  I cut back on the sugar and added some broccoli.  I added the instant white rice to my pan of chicken and sauce after it was cooked and mixed everything together.  The kids even ate it.

This was delicious. We had other dinner plans that fell through so I had to come up with something last minute using what I had on hand. I used chicken thighs and tripled the sauce, but followed the recipe exactly otherwise. My husband and duaghter asked for thirds.  Definitely needs more sauce because it's so good.

Pretty tasty and easy to throw together. I did triple the sauce, but I found that there was just too much ketchup in the ratio. I made another batch the day later and cut half the ketchup with regular BBQ sauce, and the end result was much more tastier: a bit more smokier and less ketchup sourness. Will make again with my adjustments!

I eliminated the sugar and added sweet fresh pineapple, plus I added sugar snap peas, broccoli, carrots and sweet red and yellow pepper while sautéing the onion. I also added another tablespoon of soy sauce.

I had opened two packs of diced chicken and noticed that the dices were on the large size.  So instead of being downsized to two it was increased to four and my son and I shared it with an elderly neighbour.  Boy this is on the remake list.

I went completely different from what everyone has said. I made this how it called for at first... Once I tasted it I tripled the recipe I added a can of petite diced tomatoes I can of chili beans, one very small pinch of chili powder, pinch of salt, pinch of garlic powder.

I only cook for my husband now that the kids are gone and I try not to eat at night, so this recipe I made for just him.  I made TOO much sauce lol and it was a bit over powering, but he said he really liked it and it was a definite do over.  Next time I might make more sauce on the side in case he needs it.  So funny how such simple ingredients that i have in my kitchen can make a great meal.  Thank you.  Easy Peasy and a do over all in one.

I made this after searching for a quick and easy weeknight meal. My family loved it! I tripeled the sauce and added fresh garlic and ginger. Next time I won't add as much sugar since it was so sweet. I served it with brown rice and broccoli.

I made it last night and it was so good I've been sharing with everyone that will listen, lol!  I tripled the sauce as mentioned in reviews, and tapered back on sugar as suggested...it was amazing!  It can only get better each time I make it.  I would like to try mushrooms and maybe other vegetables?  Thumbs way up!

I added a bit of garlic and ginger, doubled the sauce and threw in some frozen veggies near the end.  It was great with some rice and a salad, and a really quick and easy dinner.  All my kids like it.

Pretty good! Fast, easy, exactly what I was looking for.  Would definitely make it again. Might try pounding the chicken next time to tenderize a bit and make the pieces less chunky.

Truly lives up to its name, just add "delicious" to it! I did deviate from the correct measurements a little bit (I made sauce for 4 portions and only made two servings) and added a couple more ingredients (a tablespoon of barbecue sauce into the sauce mixture and galic salt as the chicken was cooking with the onion). Simply a great and quick recipe from the ingredients you probably have in your pantry.

Thanks for sharing!

I have made the recipe exactly as it is written and it is delicious! I have also made it with a few additions. When I make it I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces so it cooks much quicker. I have also added pepper, small tomatoes and black olives. I always serve it over rice. It is always a hit.

This dish was pretty tasty and easy to make. My kids ate it and hubby was caught afterward sampling more from the pot. Its pretty rare for all of my family to like a dish so will definitely make again.
I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce. Served over rice with broccoli as recommended. Yum!

Just need to say I read so many reviews here saying triple the sauce.  I doubled it and had chicken swimming in excess sauce.  Unless you plan to drench your rice in the sauce I would say follow the recipe.  I don't think this one is intended to give a thick coating of sauce to the chicken just a light flavoring.

I made this the other night. I did have to improvise last minute because i did not realize we were out of ketchup. I used bbq sauce instead. My family loved it. We all agreed that it probably would not have tasted as good with ketchup, so I will be substituting bbq sauce from now on

This is a tasty alternative chicken recipe that uses things that are already in the kitchen. I only cooked 3 medium breasts as opposed to 4 and thought the sauce was the right amount.

For once my boyfriend did not add hot sauce to a dish. (That's a definite he likes the flavor.)

I also doubled the sauce. I added some chunk pineapple that I cooked separately on the stove in its own juice with some brown sugar. I also added some of the juice from the pineapple chunks to the chicken as it cooked. We enjoyed it. I've served this for casual company and they loved it as well!

An excellent, quick and tasty recipe!  I served with steamed asparagus and rice with wasabi flavoured soya sauce.

I made this for dinner tonight, I did what others suggested and tripled the sauce recipe, then the last 5 minutes of cooking I brought it back to a boil and added a little cornstarch mixed with water to thicken the sauce. Served it over Chinese noodles and broccoli on the side. Delicious!

Double the servings to 8 and it was still flavorful, tangy and sweet. My sauce substitutions (for 8 servings) were 1/4 lemon juice, brown sugar, 2x soy sauce and 2x ketchup, and 1 teaspoon of black pepper. Everyone in our get together loved it, recipe will be going in our meal plan for sure!

Love this recipe, the only change is I double the sauce and only put 1/4 tsp ground black pepper in because my family found the 1 tsp to be too spicy but if you like spicy go for it.  So good! Highly recommend!

This is very similar to a recipe I used to make that I got off the back of a package of chicken breasts, which I wrote down once, but lost and then they stopped putting it on the package. It was great to find it again, and like many others mentioned, even back then I used to double the sauce. I like it over rice and with broccoli. Great tasting and fast meal. Update: After making this several times, I remembered that the original recipe I had was the same except at the end of the cooking process, remove chicken and then combine a small amount of cornstarch with water and then add to the sauce and simmer until thickened. I think this is a great step for the sauce for a great recipe.

My family loved this recipe and so did I.  I put it over mashed potatoes and next time will try over rice.  I tripled the sauce like "Mary" did and it was perfect for the mashed potatoes. Very delicious.  Thank you for the reviews. I got alot of ideas from them.

This recipe is great, very simple, made with ingredients I almost always have readily available. I tend to throw some minced garlic in with the onions after they're about translucent. I'm fairly garlic crazy so I'm not sure if it improves the recipe or just appeals to my taste, but I like it quite a lot!

This recipe has been a staple in my home. I don't have a ton of time to baby my food while it's cooking, so this is absolutely perfect for me! I do double the sauce recipe, but other than that, I'm usually golden. This stuff goes well with quinoa. Also, for those who are looking to add more veggies to their life, adding bell peppers while the sauce is simmering makes the dish even better.

Loved this recipe.  Its healthy, tasty, AND easy to make!  I served it with brown rice.  Another great thing about this recipe is it tastes even better the next day because all the different flavors have time to blend together.

First recipe I've tried from the website, and my teenage boys loved it!  Easy and delicious. A great find!  Thanks for sharing.  I  did double the sauce, we like things peppery, so used recommended amount of pepper, and even my picky 14 year old liked it.  I served it with sushi rice, which was thick and sticky and absorbed the sauce beautifully.

This was a hit with the family! I suggest making a little extra sauce if you like your food saucy. I didn't have soy sauce on hand, but I did have some teriyaki chicken marinade sauce. I tasted close enough to soy sauce and had the right consistency. I also added 1/8 tsp. of minced garlic. I really think this dish would be good with some grated ginger root, drained unsweetened pineapple pieces and some coarsely chopped bell pepper for some color and flavor. Some frozen Chinese vegetable mix could be added for a one dish meal.It was quick and easy to prepare after a long day of teaching. A great easy, fast home cooked meal!

Doubled sauce, using honey in place of sugar and served with rice.  Good sauce, but not totally sold on the strong ketchup flavor.

Great recipe -  Easy and Delicious. I made 2 chicken breasts (1/2 the meat serving) but kept the sauce dressing for 4 breasts. I also substituted 1 tablespoon of Siracha for the Ketchup, since I love spicy food. I did cut up the chicken in cubes - one note though; if you decide to do this, you likely can cut out about 5 mins from the cook time as the chicken was a little dry when I cooked it for 25 minutes.

I have tried this recipe twice and both times we really want to like it.  The first time we made it just like it was written.  The second time we made it with a few alterations suggested by others.  Frustratingly, it just doesn't work for us.

I thought this chicken was very tasty for a quick fast meal.  Enjoyed it with white rice.

I made this tonight for my husband and I and we didn't care for it at all. It was hard for me to eat and my husband even went as far as to wash the chicken off. I followed the adjustments that other commenters suggested and I just didn't care for it. It is quick and easy but not delicious. :)

This recipe is great!!  We made it some much one month we "almost" got tired of it. I modified the recipe a bit. The sauce isn't nearly enough so I use 1 cup of ketchup, 1 cup of sugar, 2/3 cup vinegar and lemon juice and pepper to taste.  Also, I use balsamic vinegar instead of soy sauce.  My wife is allergic to soy and the vinegar is wonderful!  Also, I debone chicken thighs and use them.  They work great!

Made this last night and was a little worried, but it turned out great.  Tripled the sauce and only used a tsp. of sugar and sprinkle of pepper (I'm not a pepper lover).  Cut the chicken into strips so it would cook a little faster.  My husband loved it!  Will definitely make again.

I used the original recipe and it turned out great!  Everybody loved it (it came out spicy) with lentils and green beans.  The only thing I did differently is that I cut the chicken breast into bite size pieces so it would  cook faster and absorb the flavor more

The only complaint I have is the name, cuz it just does sell it like it should! This was absolutely delicious, and went brilliantly with sticky rice and fresh steamed green beans! Definitely making this again!

I thought it was just okay but everyone else liked it so I probably will make again.  Kinda reminds me of sloppy joe sauce. I trippled the sauce & added some water as it seemed too thick & a little too tangy. I also added some garlic powder, & cayenne pepper flakes. Also, I cut the onions in bigger pieces.  Cooked up pretty quickly which is a plus.

A keeper!  The whole family loved it.  I tripled the sauce ingredients as recommended by others (with the exception of the sugar, which I only doubled) and would do the same again.  Very easy and tasty over brown rice.

This truly is easy to make chicken. My whole family loves it. I double the sauce and marinate the chicken in a little ketchup and soy sauce before browning. Always a favorite when I have a short amount of time.

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband loved it! Its perfectly sweat and spicy :) I doubled the sauce but next time I will be tripling it....I added broccoli and carrots and water chestnuts with white rice to it ...when adding the sauce just add a can of water chestnuts with it so it soaks up some of the flavor :)

Absolutely delicious and different!  I also tripled the sauce recipe so I could saute veggies in with the chicken.  We didn't have any rice so I served it with ramen noodles minus the sauce packet.  Very good... will definitely save and use again.

This was very good. I also tripled the sauce as suggested by others and added corn starch to thicken it, which was perfect. Only thing I'd change is I think I added too much pepper and it definitely had a kick to it. Overall though, very tasty and will definitely cook again.

Very good! Tastes like a unique sort of bbq sauce. Since I was out of lemon juice I used lime juice and it still came out fantastic. I do have to agree that the sauce needs to be tripled, I doubled it and still didn't have enough to put on the rice, which it tastes wonderful with.

Very delicious and easy to prepare.  My boyfriend and I loved it! I only had three chicken breasts defrosted which I cut up into smaller pieces.  It yielded a good amount of sauce and had a bit of a spiciness to it, which we liked.  I served it over white rice, steamed broccoli and carrots.

Excellent recipe! However, doubling, even tripling the sauce is a must as it is soooo good! We ate this with a rice/vegetable steamer for the microwave. It is a quick, easy dinner for any weeknight and will definitely be added to our regular rotation!

Really tasty sauce, but felt like it needed just a little zip...so poured in about 1/2 cup of the dark beer I was drinking (pale ale) to the sauce before adding to chicken and it REALLY made a yummy difference! 
Would also recommend a tsp or so of chili paste for those who like a little heat...

Was fast & easy- although I didn't care for the taste of the sauce. I followed the recipe exactly but thought the sauce tasted of too much ketchup. Just okay- would not make again.

Very quick and easy indeed! Highly recommended for those nights when you are out of ideas and energy to whip up dinner. The lemon juice adds a nice citrus flavour to the dish - a welcomed change from the usual ketchup/soy sauce sauces.

Nice recipe, like suggested, I doubled the sauce and add 1 spoonful of cornstarch diluted in 1/3 cup of cold water and added it at the end of cooking time, do it, you'll get a perfect consistency. I will definitely make it again, but next time I will REDUCE THE PEPPER! It was too hot for my taste, I will only ADD A GOOD PINCH. I will also REDUCE LEMON JUICE BY HALF, it was a bit too acid, and I will REDUCE SUGAR BY HALF as well. With this changes I think its going to come out PERFECT!

Great quick, easy recipe.  I didn't change anything.  The only thing that I did do is cut up the chicken into bite sized pieces so that it could cook a little faster.  Will make again!

I made this yesterday for Sunday dinner and am really glad that I did. Yesterday, it was a bit on the fence about it I could really taste the flavors in the sauce and thought that it didn't flavor the chicken well. But now that it has had time to marry it's taste really good today. I will definately be using this sauce again. I trippled the receipe like others suggested and added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch disolved in 1/3 cup of water to thicken it up. However, next time I'll only double the sauce ingredients and will disolve the cornstarch directly into the pot as I still felt like the sauce could have been thicker.

No one in my family liked this. They are picky eaters and I was hoping they would like this one...not a keeper! I didn't like it either and I'm usually not picky.

This dish was a hit!  After reading several reviews, I also tripled the sauce and added a tablespoon of cornstarch dissolved in 1/3 cup of cold water to the sauce after removing the chicken.  I served the chicken with sauce over herbed rice and a spinach salad on the side.  Everyone had seconds (=

This was very quick and easy.  I didn't have an onion, so I substituted bell peppers.  It is not often that I find a recipe that the whole family loves - this was one of those!

Way way too much pepper! I even cut the amount of pepper this recipe called for in half and it was still too much. I would suggest just using 1/4 tsp. Also, too much sugar. I would cut that in half, as well. With those changes, this might be a decent recipe.

This was great! I doubled the sauce and added a bag of frozen stir fry veggies and a can of pineapple chunks and we loved it. I bet it would be good with pork or shrimp too.

This is absolutely fantastic. I did not have chicken on hand, so I used a package of extra firm tofu sliced into 1/2 inch slices and quadrupled the sauce. All the ingredients are items that I already had on hand, so I relished not having to make a last minute trip to the store. It was an instant hit among all the picky eaters in the house, and it had my roommate begging for the recipe. I definitely will be making this again.

I absolutely love this dish... I was making it for 2 so I only tweaked the sauce a bit...I chopped half an onion (which was plenty), 4 tblsp ketchup, 3 tblsp soy sauce, 3 1/2 tblsp white sugar, and the juice of one full lemon....the sauce was ridiculously good...I didn't have any breasts on hand so I used boneless, skinless thighs...so great!

This recipe was a hit w the whole fam! Even my 3 yr old twins loved it. The only thing i would probably do different to suit my family's taste is make it w less pepper. Maybe 1/2 a tablespoon. To me however, the more kick the better. Overall great tasting and as it describes, quick and EASY!

Wow...so simple and good. I didn't have soy sauce so I added teriyaki, worchestire, chili sauce, and one fresh tomato. Perfect for a fast weeknight meal. The kids loved it too!

I made this tonight for my family and it was excellent.  I took the advice of others and tripled the sauce;however, next time I will omit some of the sugar since I thought it was too sweet.  The sauce caramelized which added some texture and was so yummy.

I will definitely be making this often

I have to say that my family LOVED this and ate every bite. I left out the sugar and lemon juice (didn't have any at the time) and decided to add a tad of corn starch at the end to make the sauce thicker like gravy. I WILL be cooking this again and agian! thank you.

Meh.  This recipe was ok, but the ketchup-heavy sauce didn't really work for me.  I would also recommend using more veggies (like bell peppers or bean sprouts) besides just onion.  It was passable for a quick meal, but I probably won't make this again without some serious adjustments.

I cut the pepper to half the amount, and it was still a bit too much.  However, it was very easy to make and had a great taste!!!  I would make it again, with less pepper.

What a great recipe! I doubled the sauce as well and I missed it with some white rice.  It was absolutely delicious. The chicken came out so nice and moist.  My husband loved it as well and we will defninitely be keeping this recipe close at hand. I am going to try this sauce on spare ribs as well!

Very good. Did make a couple of revisions based on prior posts. First, I used Krazy Ketchup instead of regular ketchup. It doesn't have as much sugar. I doubled the sauce except for the sugar and pepper. I didn't add pepper at all. I addded a splash of Rooster Sauce instead. I also added some frozen asparagus at the end. Served over sticky rice. It was just as good as something you would get out at a restaurant.

Every person in my family of 6 loved this recipe!  I sauteed a clove of garlic in with the onions and doubled the ingredients for the sauce so that it could be served over rice.  This recipe is a keeper!

Loved this recipe! My boyfriend and I made it together, with some broccoli and rice. We added garlic,salt and chili powder to the sauce. It was so easy and flavorful! Our new favorite chicken dinner!

Not only was this very tasty, but all the ingredients are things you normally have on hand.  It was a bit too peppery so I would reduce the amount by half. While this was easy, it does require constant basting while cooking.

Excellent flavor, but VERY "peppery".    I doubled everything exactly, but way too spicy with pepper.  Next time I make this I will still double, but will use less than half the pepper listed.

Super easy and simple to make and taste great over rice. Doubled the sauce could even triple it for more over rice. Great for a party too. Will make again.

I made this recipe using about 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs because that is what I had on hand.  I baked the chicken for about 20 minutes at 375 degrees then drained the fat.  While the chicken was baking, I sauteed the onions, added the sauce ingredients and let it simmer.  I poured the sauce over the chicken and baked it for another 10 minutes.  Because I made so much chicken I quadrupled the sauce ingredients but kept it to one onion, 3 Tbl. sugar and only used 1/2 tsp. black pepper.  It was a delicious dinner served over rice.

Very quick, easy and tasty! I doubled the recipe as suggested by others, and was very glad I did.  Would probably make a nice marinade for any meat.  I also poured in a little bit of store-bought teriyaki marinade into the sauce for some added depth.  Will definitely make again.

We used the suggestion of other users and doubled the sauce ingredients. However, next time we will probably half the pepper. Turned out good nonetheless.  Easy and quick meal on short notice. Most homes will have the ingredients on hand without any extra trips to the store.

Tripled the sauce because hubby and I like lots, but would decrease the sugar, it was a little too sweet.. otherwise this was really easy and great served with rice.

I was not in love with this recipe, and my husband didn't take the leftovers for lunch, which is a HUGE thumbs down. I doubled the sauce and, at the end, added straw mushrooms, green beans, and water chestnuts for texture. It was ok, but certainly no better than popping open a bottle of teriaki glaze, which would have been quicker. There was something kind of weird about the ketchup/lemon combo. I will be sticking with the bottle of glaze in the future.

I made this dinner last night after not having a clue what we'd have for dinner.  I had all of the ingredients on hand and gave it a shot.  It was so delicious and amazinging easy.  My hubby loved it and asked that I keep this recipe to make again.

This was very good and easy. While I sauteed the onions I cut up the chicken in bite-sized pieces and let it marinate in the sauce mixture. I also doubled the sauce, but not the sugar and it turned out wonderful! Next time I will add some sesame seeds to this and put it over white rice. Definitely making again!!!!

Good, definitely quick & easy.  I love that it uses ingredients I always have on hand.  I added celery as recommended, doubled the sauce, and used only 1 Tbsp sugar, and added cornstarch at the end to thicken, and just a sprinkle of pepper.  For a little spice, some crushed red pepper would go nicely, but for dinner with the kids this was great and my 11 month old who spits out anything with meat, despite all my efforts, actually gobbled this up!

Excellent flavors.  Sauce was too sweet - I would cut sugar in half, and reassess.  I also added dry roasted peanuts and green beans.  Excellent.  Celery would be good, too.

Very good, beware if you don't like spicy i would suggest to cut the pepper in half or just leave it out. I loved it as is. I cubed two chickens breast and let it simmer about 20-25 minutes. Will try with dark meat soon, Thanks i love it!

This sauce is amazing!  It would be great with turkey and pork, as well.  It was a tad salty for my taste, so I'll probably use low-sodium soy sauce from now on.  My picky toddler asked for unheard-of THIRDS!  Definitely a keeper!

This was very good. zucchini to it since I had just picked it from the garden. I followed the advice of others and doubled the sauce, but I only added more soy sauce and lemon juice, I kept the pepper, ketchup and sugar the same.  I also added a dash of rice wine vinegar.  I simmered for 35 minutes and then added a slurry of cornstarch and cold water to thicken the sauce.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was so quick and easy (would have been even quicker but I had frozen chicken).  I went with everyone else and cut the pepper in half and doubled the sauce.  I added just a little fresh garlic when I was sauteing chicken and onions then added some steamed broccoli at the very end.  Thanks it was great!

This was a great recipe. It didn't take very long either. My boyfriend really liked it! I served as recipe is except I cut out the onions and added toasted sesame seeds on top right before serving and served it with white rice. I also doubled the sauce just make sure I had enough to cover it. Very tasty dish! Will make again!

This was absolutely wonderful...I enjoy cooking however as person who has a strict diet when competing I have to make my food healthy.  I used low sodium soy sauce, substitued the ketchup for no salt added tomato sauce, and instead of sugar I used Stevia as my sweetner.  These minor substitutions cuts the sodium, sugar, and carbs...still tasty!

What a yummy, fast recipe! I tripled the sauce ingredients, minced two cloves of garlic which I sautéed with the onion and added fresh ginger to the sauce. What a hit with my husband! Even my eleven month old daughter pointed and asked for more after trying it!

Yes, lives up to it's name:  Quick and Easy for sure!  With ingred. usually on hand, it is a quick, tasty dinner.  I think dark meat would be just as good or better with this sauce.

I also doubled the sauce on this recipe and was really glad I did. This is a great and healthy dinner you can whip up anytime. Everyone in my family, including my two kids, loved this. I will definately make this again.

I didn't use all the sugar it called for and it was still pretty sweet - at first I was worried it was too sweet but it actually turned out quite good!  My husband was a fan.  I doubled the sauce (more than enough) and it was pretty watery - so I added some corn starch which thickened it nicely.

this is good.  I will probably make this again.  I always precook chicken, cut into chunks and then freeze it.  To make this recipe, I just throw about a pound or 2 of frozen chicken in the pan and make the recipe as written.

Perfect recipe for sweet and sour style chicken!  I usually make this with some definite differences, but this recipe is pretty close!  In my version, I dont include the onions.  I first brown chicken breasts cut into cubed pieces, and then add 2 tbs olive oil to further crisp it.  I mix 4 tbs each of the soy sauce, ketchup, and lemon juice and 8 tbs of sugar.  I add 1/2 of this mixture to the chicken and oil and let it simmer until the sauce is nearly gone.  It turns the chicken a nice carmel/brown color and almost crystalizes it so that it is sweet and crunchy. Finally, I add the remaining sauce and simmer just enough to heat through.  This gives it enough sauce to be served over rice or noodles and tastes wonderful!  Its great if you like chinese food!

This recipe was very easy, and absolutely delicious. Myself and my husband thought it was really good, but the real clincher was that our 2 yr old and our 4 yr old couldn't get enough! 

Like many others, I doubled the recipe for the sauce, and I think that was the perfect amount. Any less might have been too little. 

Also, served this over brown rice.

I gave this 4 star's b/c my husband liked it a lot. I doubled the sauce and unlike everyone else I think I would have liked it better w/out all the sauce. Something with the flavor didn't sit right with me. I did serve it with rice and broccoli and my husband did enjoy it.

this recipe was great! as per previous posters, i tripled the sauce quantity because i like a lot of sauce on my meat. i  omitted the lemon juice b/c i had no lemons, and i also added in some teriyaki sauce and added more black pepper b/c i love black pepper. it was a quick and delicious recipe that my husband really liked and i'll definitely cook it again.

My picky husband loved this meal - it was perfect with rice and broccoli. Following others' advice, I doubled the sauce recipe, which I am glad I did. I also added a little cornstarch at the very end to thicken the sauce a bit. Very good, and very easy!

This chicken is fantastic!  My boyfriend hates ketchup, but still loves this recipe.  A couple things I do differently: double the sauce recipe and use 3 onions. (the sauteed onions really make the recipe, and the more the better!!)

The sauce would be really good as a stir fry sauce. Definitely double.

Excellent!  I can't say enough about this recipe.  It is my new favorite meal!  Easy to prepare and tastes fantastic!  My 3 year old loves it, too.  It's great with rice and broccoli.  My only suggestion would be to double the sauce like some of the other reviews say, but really a great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

I cooked a little longer, too for 45 minutes.l This was very tasty. I used a large pkg of chicken thighs legs with bones also. I tripled the sauce but 4x the ketchup. Im a ketchupaholic. Once done, I removed the bones and shredded the chicken and it was a hit.

This recipe inspired me to play around with the ingredients a little bit. What I did was use one lemon (4 Tblespns of lemon Juice), One Orange( 4-5 Tblespns of Juice), 4 Tblespns of Honey chipotle, 3 Tblspns of Ketchup, 3 and a half Tblespns of sugar, and 3/4 teaspoon of ground pepper. Also I used garlic instead of an onion because my family doesn't like onions. This came out soo yummy. Try it.

Based on the other reviews, I tripled!! the sauce amount and used a lot less onions. Also only used a dash of lemon juice.  I enjoyed it, but the sauce amount is way off.

I liked everything about this, except that I found the sauce just a little too tart and thin. I should have read the reviews first. (I found the recipe, thought it looked good, printed it out and got to cooking!)  I would've doubled the sauce (maybe not the lemon juice or pepper??) and would've let the sauce boil a bit longer. I will take another reviewer's suggestion and add some salt next time. Otherwise I really enjoyed this and will make again, due to the speed of prep and moistness of the chicken.

I was very disappointed after reading the reviews. I doubled the sauce and only put in half of the recommended pepper. The pepper taste was SO strong it ruined the other flavors. Will definitely never make again.

delicious! I paired it with rice and veggies for a quick & easy meal. Make double (or even triple!) the amounts there though... I found it hardly covered the chicken. Enjoy!

Not a sauce to be used with rice.  It is more of a bbq sauce.  Would be great in the summer on the BBQ.  Also, this dish was very sickly.

Loved it! I was making lunch for myself and wanted some sort of chicken over cavatapi noodles (had the noodles as leftovers).  I also didn't have an onion (used it the night before) so I used a red pepper.  I doubled the sauce & devoured it!  Definitely hit the spot!  Thanks.

This is a great, tasty way to prepare chicken.  I always double the "sauce" ingredients, as my husband enjoys it over rice.  I usually use the frozen bagged chicken tenders, and it comes out just fine.

This was yummy but I totally agree about doubling, even tripling the sauce! I used 2 chicken breasts & used the sauce ingredients as listed but there still wasn't enough flavor! Next time I'll double the sauce. Thanks for such an easy recipe.

Very good and soo easy.  I used thighs and legs and it came out very tender, like Boston Market.. yum.  The onions carmelized perfectly.  Only thing is that my husband thought it was a bit too sweet (even though I only used 2 tablespoons sugar), but maybe that is due to using thighs.. I don't know.  Next time I will use less sugar and add lots of garlic too!

This dish has a really good and unique BBQish flavor, which is another good reason to make extra sauce like others have said.  I didn't measure the sauce ingredients; I just eyeballed it.  It still came out very tasty.

Wonderful recipe for last minute meals! Delicious! You can use the sauce with the chicken to put on mashed potatoes. It's great! I also steam broccoli to round out the meal. Takes no time at all if you microwave the potatoes first.

I, too, changed the recipe a little.  As previous reviewers suggested, I doubled the sauce so there would be enough to put over the brown rice I made with it.  I didn't use any oil, instead I sprayed the pan with Olivio spray (no fat or calories).  I added 1 cup each of chopped frozen squash, zucchini, and bell peppers (thawed slightly first in the microwave) to the onions and cooked them all together before adding the chicken.  While it was all cooking together, it smelled WONDERFUL!  And the  taste didn't disappoint.  The chicken was tender, the sauce was fantastic, on the meat, rice, and veggies.  Really very good.  Thanks, Anny, for a truly "quick and easy" (and tasty!) recipe.

I made this last night because we needed 
something quick and it was great. Really
easy to make and tasted really good.
I tripled the sauce and had plenty, I also
added garlic as some other reviewers had
suggested. Hubby gobbled it up!

I doubled the recipe.  this recipe was ok... i think i didn't do something right.  It maybe that I put too much black pepper.  I will try to cook this again, but this time not too much black pepper.

Very good flavor and so easy with simple ingredients. I followed the recipe exactly and it was great. If serving with rice - I would double the sauce.  Next time, I will use just a little less pepper.

We LOVE this recipe!  We always at least double the sauce, and eat it over rice.  It is so quick and easy, it is definitely my favorite recipe to use when we are short on time.

I doubled the sauce and poured it over black beans and rice -- MMMMMMM!  It was a little more peppery than I prefer (though DH loved that) but this is definitely one I'll add to the repetoire.

I liked this recipe because it was so easy and quite good.  I, too, doubled the sauce recipe.  Next time, I might add just a little garlic.

We enjoyed this. It's a lot like sweet & sour barbeque sauce. The sauce was nice on rice: I doubled the sauce to have extra. I was out of white sugar, so I used light brown sugar. I'll make it again, perhaps adding some ginger or garlic.

This was delicious and so easy to make. The next time I make it, I'll double the sauce to have more to pour over rice. Definitely a keeper!!

Soooooo good.  I'm a college student and make it all the time at my apartment, because it's not so hard.  I also made it for my family and they raved.

I absolutely loved this recipe! My husband doesn't like foods that are sweet, so it wasn't something he'd eat again. But I think he might not have liked it because he hates soy sauce. I didn't tell him it had soy sauce in it or he wouldn't have eaten it at all ;)

Great flavor and very easy.  Onions were great, however, if you don't have a whole onion, a half would do just fine.

Quick, easy and delicious! A great change of pace for the dull, boring chicken we usually have.

I am always looking for news ways to cook boneless skinless chicken breasts and now I have another recipe to add to my rotation. I doubled the sauce and used it to pour over mashed potato's which turned out well. Next time I will try with rice and see which one I perfer! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was pretty good.  It doesn't make much of a presentation, but there weren't any leftovers, and it couldn't be easier to make!  Thanks!
