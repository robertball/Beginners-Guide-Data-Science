Made these today. I didn't mind the looseness of the mix because it was the easiest to roll of any of these I've ever made. And I've made a lot. The taste is great, too!
If you aren't a fan of cacao nibs, try some cocoa powder instead.

The taste is nice, the agave lends a good sweetness, not overly so. But even after 1 1/2 hrs in the fridge, the balls just didn't firm nicely. I think it needs some kind of binder, maybe cocoa powder? I may try it again & will probably toast the oats & see if that gives it a less "raw" taste. 

Not bad but bit as great as expected.

These are great for a quick energy boost.  Next time I will be more creative and add dried fruits instead of Chocolate Chips.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I substituted peanut butter for almond butter! It turned out great. They have the same flavors as those chocolate no bake cookies, but much healthier. Perfect for when I donâ€™t have time to sit down and eat a meal but need to get some nourishment in my body.
