I do believe that you should rate the recipe "as-is", but I still would like to give this recipe 5 stars as the changes I made were my preferences and does not change the quality of the original recipe.  These "substitutions" were that I used boiling water and chicken bouillon to make the broth (I never buy canned brother anymore, too expensive and takes too much room in the pantry as I use quite a bit). I also substituted my own salsa for the Pace brand. I added a little more cilantro since I LOVE cilantro. And I didn't have the "Mexican-style" corn with the peppers, so I just used regular corn... I don't think that made a huge difference in flavor since those peppers probably don't have much taste coming from a can of corn... more of a texture thing.  I tasted the soup and thought it was excellent and flavorful BEFORE I added a can of Rotel HOT Tomatoes with Habanero peppers. I like things very spicy and I also think tortilla soup should have some diced tomatoes in it, so this was an great touch for me. However, the soup was still very good before the Rotel.  I look forward to making this recipe again on days I have leftover chicken for a very quick meal (30 mins. with precooked chicken that is already chopped/shredded). I also would like to try this in the crockpot with whole raw chicken breasts thrown in with everything else... and then shred the chicken at the end.

Absolutely Delicious!  I added 1 can drained and rinsed black beans to the soup and topped each bowl with shredded cheese and a dollup of sour cream along with store bought tortilla chips.

Very easy & made good leftovers too!  I made some small changes:  used brown not white rice, more cilantro, a can of diced tomatoes & low sodium broth. Just tried to make healthier & still yummy!

Love it!  I made this for supper tonight on this chilly Delaware evening and it was DELICIOUS!  I was so proud of it and of myself because I followed it to the letter (except for adding a can of rinsed and drained black beans) and it turned out just perfect.  We could smell the cilantro and cumin as the soup was cooking and it made us so anxious for it to be done.  I did use a different kind of salsa just because I like it better and it has a bit of a kick to it (not hot, just zesty), but we do like Pace and I'm sure it would have been just as tasty if I'd used that salsa.  My only problem  There was only enough for one bowl left for leftovers because the four of us ate it all!  Next time, I'll double the recipe. Thanks so much for this recipe...I know we'll use it again and again.

I am so in love with this recipe!!! The only thing I changed was adding more rice, cilantro and broth. Wonderful for cold Colorado nights. My mother-in-law even approved and took my copy of the recipe home with her! Thanks!

This was great! My two year old even ate it! I added a can of black beans for some extra nutrients. Added just 1/3 c rice and used my whole carton of broth (4 cups). I added a can of green chiles along with my can of corn because I didn't have the corn w/ peppers. I was also missing the cilantro :( It was still delicious but I'm sure it would've been even better with some extra cilantro!

This is awesome!  I substituted the chicken breast with a large can of Tyson Chicken for a quick fix. I used a 24oz Pace "Medium" Salsa and a carton of Swanson Chicken Broth.  To jazz it up a bit, I added Rotel tomatoes,  a can of Black Beans (drained and rinsed), Northern Beans (undrained), substituted rice with a can of Spanish Rice, and added 16 oz Sour Cream and a can of Fiesta Nacho Cheese Soup.   About 5 mins before serving, I added bite size flour tortilla pieces. Feeds an army!  Outstanding!

This was a surprisingly good soup!  I followed the recipe to a T, with the exception of the tortilla strips (I used store bought for those).

I made some changes. I cut up an onion and orange pepper and cooked with the chicken, I also added salt, pepper, cayenne, and chili powder to them while they were cooking to make it spicy. I used 4 cups broth, and added some tabasco. It was really yummy, will make it again for sure!

My picky 12 year old son loves the tortilla soup at “Wahoo’s Fish Tacos,” so I thought I would give a shot at making one at home that he might like. This was the first recipe I tried. After looking at it, he said, “It doesn’t look the same.” And after me saying, “Giiiiive iiiit aaaa tryyyyy,”  he was hooked after one bite. It may not taste exactly the same as Wahoo’s, but I now I have an excellent tortilla soup for my recipe box. We tried the soup with the homemade tortilla strips and then with crunched up tortilla chips, and prefered the chips. Also, we found that less rice is better (@1/4-1/3 cup). 1/2 is still good, but it is more like a gumbo consistency than a soup.

Delicious!  I served this at our football watching party and it was a hit.  I added some black beans and a can of Rotel Tomatoes and more broth.  Next time I will cut back on the rice by half.

This soup is a great way to use up those broken tortilla chips in the bottom of the bag!  Just pour the soup over the chips and let soften for a few minutes before serving.

This is really delicious.  We used frozen corn instead of the canned.  You have to keep an eye on the tortilla strips.  There's a fine line between perfectly done & burned, that you don't want to cross. I used a pizza cutter to cut them.  The recipe was super easy and fast to make.  It has a really great flavor.

Made this recently and was a little disappointed in the flavor. It was somewhat bland but it was still good. I added 1 can of rinses black beans which turned out very good. I would probably change something to the recipe next time, but I'm not sure what that would be...

This was very good! I did make some healthier changes/additions tho.  I try to get the kids to eat extra fiber, but because they ARE kids, I have to hide it from their little turned up noses!  Here's what I did: I browned the chicken in olive oil. I used 99%fat free broth, stirred in 1/2 can of fat free refried beans and put the rest out for a condiment because my kids think they don't like 'that yucky brown stuff'...little did they know it was in the soup!  I used 1/2 quinoa (the mother load of grains!) & 1/2 brown rice, whole wheat tortillias and threw in a handful of flax for good measure!  When it was time to serve, I had fat free sour cream, chopped green onion, low fat shredded provolone, the remaining refried beans (!) and additional salsa & fire sauce for the fire-proof pallet!  The result was a thick attractive soup packed FULL of hidden nutrients and it tasted AWESOME!  Everyone INCLUDING the kids loved it!  Thanks for sharing!  :)

Hmm.  4 1/2 stars?  We're not feeling it.  This soup was just OK --Definitely not extraordinary.  I reread this recipe several times to see if there was something I did wrong.  It wasn't bad, but just really unexciting.  On the positive side, it was very easy to make.  Not sure that I would bother making again even with changes.

This recipe is very good on a cold winter night.  I think the recipe can be played around with if you don't have all the ingredients on hand. I added a can of green chilis and white northern beans to this and it was great. The other note is that I would go with less rice than called for.  When I was ready to put it away for leftovers, I noticed the rice had soaked up all of the liquid so it wasn't like soup anymore.

This recipe just saved me a bunch of money! This tastes IDENTICAL to chicken tortilla soup from a very good local mexican restaurant that my daughter and I used to go to as much as we could. The recipe does not need any fixes, but you can adjust to your tastes if you want -- I only added a bit more cilantro and at the end topped it with tortilla chips with melted mexican blend cheese and fresh avacado. Oh my goodness, this was so good!

delicious soup! I would definitely make this again. I was really easy and used up my left over whole chicken that I baked last week. I took another persons advice and added a can of black beans. For the salsa I used half a mild salsa and half a hot salsa to make the soup a bit spicy. Amazing with a wedge of lemon squeezed over! Yummmm!

Mmm good!  I didn't use cilantro, added Parsley instead.  I used bought whole wheat corn chips instead of making my own.  Also topped it with regular yogurt (like sour cream).

Seemed too easy to be so highly rated----but it was great!! Might like chicken more of a shredded texture next time.  Made the tortilla strips in oven and worked just great. Will definitely make again and pass this one on to others.

EXCELLENT! I used Rotel tomatoes instead of salsa, added a can of rinsed black beans, added some onion and lemon juice! Great... also when I roast a whole chicken I always make a soup with the left overs. That what I did here, boiled the bones to make my broth, added onion and celery, and used the left over chicken for the soup! It was fantastic!!! A keeper!

This soup was excellent!  I doubled the recipe and just added a little bit of salt to taste and an extra can of Hunts Fire Roasted Garlic Diced Tomatoes.  I also probably used a little more cilantro and fresh lime juice to taste.   It's much better served the day after so the flavors can come together.  I didn't make the tortilla chips, however, I used the lime flavored ones...recipe is awesome.

This is a good soup, I must admit I never had chicken tortilla soup with rice in it but it was a nice addition. And I didn't have any corn with red and green bell peppers in it, so I just used a can of corn niblets and I had a red and green bell pepper so I just cut them up and added. I also only had a fourth of salsa sauce left in my frig so I just used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies.

Made this last night, eating left overs right now... Love it!! I can never follow a recipe to a T though, so I made some changes.  I cooked the chicken with some onion that I had left over.  I also added a can of tomatos, I used about a cup of rice, and added a little cinnamon to give it that "hmmm what is that?" perfect!! I'll make this again.  I baked my own tortilla strips, but next time, I'll probably just use store bought. Too much time, and I burnt the first batch... oops.  Wonderful soup though! Thanks!!

This has such a great flavor, the lime and cilantro really added to the flavor. My daughter even ate it and she usually hates anything with corn.  I also added black beans and used brown rice.

Very yummy! I would make it again.  I skipped the chicken steps because I put my chicken in the crock pot to cook.  I doubled the recipe so I would have leftovers.  I also added 1 can of black beans.  I topped with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream. Instead of the corn tortillas, I had tortilla chips on hand.

Wonderful soup! Couldn't find that corn with peppers in a can, but in the frozen section I found Birds Eye had a "ultimate southwest blend" which is a mixture of sweet corn, black beans, mild poblano chilies, red peppers and roasted onions. I also used chicken bouillon, instant rice and tortilla chips. That shaved off some time, effort and mess. This will be a permanent recipe in our family menu! :)

Great recipe- super easy with stuff you will have on hand. I didnt have corn tortillas so I just crushed up some corn tortilla chips and it was terrific. I did add more lime juice (just because I love it) and it great. Teen daughter loved it too. Will definitely make again when its cold out and you just want to warm up with some comfort food.

I made this for lunch today.  Super easy.  Added a can of black beans and northern beans after rinsing and a can of rotel though just the Pace would have been fine.  This is one of those recipes that you can add and take away ingredients without impacting the flavor greatly.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was FABULOUS!  My entire family went nuts over this meal and I had to promise that it would remain in the rotation.  I used store brand chunky salsa, but pureed it (personal preference).  I used chicken tenders browned in olive oil, shredded them, threw them back in the pot and tossed the water/bouillon cubes right on top (once the chix was fully cooked, of course) along with the other ingredients.  Garlic powder was thrown in along with the wonderful cumin.  I admit I cheated and bought the store brand tri-color tortilla strips--so easy.  I made my rice separately in the microwave steamer and just poured the soup over it in individual bowls--perfect!  Thank you so much for this recipe!  WONDERFUL!

Delicious! I did make a few modifications - I added a whole jar (24 oz) of Pace, 3 tablespoons of lime juice, and 1.5 tablespoons of cilantro.  I've made this multiple times now and it never gets old!

Fantastic! It was the first chilly night of the Fall season and this was the perfect dinner! I very much enjoyed it! The only thing I changed was adding black beans that I read other reviewers say they did.

Love this soup!  Used leftover cooked chicken.  Next time I will add more broth as mine was not very "soupy", just a little too thick but delicious.  It has a very fresh "lime" taste to it.  Yum!

Great basic recipe to build on. I added a can of black beans, used brown rice and frozen corn instead of the canned corn, and added a 4 oz. can of green chilies and Frank's Red Hot sauce for added zing. DH thought it was great so we'll be having this again.

Not full of flavor, but good. Used store bought crunchy tortilla strips instead of making my own to save time. The smaller I cut the chicken, the more I liked the taste.

Me and my family love this recipe.  I have tried it a few different ways.  My favorite is using chipole flavored corn instead of the bell pepper corn, (not a real big pepper fan).  My picky husband loves this soup.  I made it for my extended family (inlaws, aunts, uncles, etc,) Of course, I tripled the recipe, but still almost ran out.  It was a huge success.  I don't think anyone had only one bowll.

This is a great recipe as is. I like to take the leftovers from a rotisserie chicken...I de-bone it, put the bones and any drippings in the soup pot with 6 cups water, bring to a boil, and simmer for an hour or so on low.  That liquid takes the place of the chicken broth, only better! I add a couple of teaspoons of salt since prepared broth is generally salted. After removing the bones, and adding the chicken I saved from the de-boning, I make the recipe as written, with the addition of a can of black beans, with liquid. I like to drop a few of the sliced tortillas to the soup just before serving, as well as leaving some for topping, along with a dollop of sour cream and pinch of fresh-chopped cilantro.

Easy, fast, and delicious.  5 stars as is... I like to add black beans and a can of stewed tomatoes.  I also shred the chicken.

Yummy!  What a great soup on a cold winter night.  I made as written and it was excellent.  Only thing I forgot before taking a photo was to put the tortilla strips (which I'd bought ready-made) on top of the soup, so after we'd started to eat it I added a dollop of sour cream and a few of the Sante Fe strips.  I loved others' suggestions of adding black beans, shredded Mexican blend cheese and using a crockpot and I'll definitely be  incorporating those when I make it again.

I made this in a slow cooker using 8 boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts.  I also used 1 cup of pace Salsa Verde and a can of rotel with lime & cilantro and a can of drained black beans. I dumped everything in the crock pot together and let it cook overnight. The next morning it was ready. I shredded the chicken and added the cilantro and lime juice after it finished cooking.  Delicious and makes alot so we had enough left to take to work for lunch the next couple of days.  Best topped with shredded mexican blend cheese and a dollop of sour cream.

This recipe was absolutely amazing! My husband is a VERY picky eater(meat and potato guy) and he went back for seconds!! He told me the next time I make it, try adding a little more salsa for heat.

Tasty. Not as hearty and thick as it appears. You should double the recipe if you want leftovers or are cooking for more than 3 people. But overall it was tasty.

Quick, easy and delicious, what mare could you ask for?  We like to add sour cream and cheese to each bowl for more flavor (and calories I guess).

So yummy! The only change I made was I put everything in my slow cooker after browning the chicken.

We loved this... and it was super easy to prepare! I used frozen corn instead of the canned and brown rice instead of white. I do have to mention that the cook time on the tortilla chips was too long. I neglected to check them while cooking, and at the 10 minute buzzer, they were all black. Otherwise, it was fast and easy and my 4 kids loved it! :)

Made it exactly as written. Very good flavor. My only change would be to use much less rice as it soaked up too much of the broth, rendering it not very "soupy." I added a little more chicken stock & salsa to balance it out but it was still too much. Good recipe, though. Very quick and easy to pull together and even my picky kids enjoyed it.
