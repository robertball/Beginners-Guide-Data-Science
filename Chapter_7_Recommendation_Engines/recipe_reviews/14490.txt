I really like this recipe, it is really quick, and I have made it several times.  I add stuff though, some of the things I might throw in are:  a 1/2 bottle or so of purchased honey barbeque sauce, a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, a little brown sugar, and a dash of chili powder.   It always comes out good.

Good and easy. Sweet but great on hot dogs with sauerkraut. I added 3 garlic cloves instead of the powder.

This was a TERRIFIC recipe for BBQ sauce.  I ran out of BBQ sauce for our steaks for dinner one night and had to come up with something quick...well..this did the trick for sure.  Gotta admit, the Coke was WEIRD but .. it was real tasty and amazingly easy.  I'd definitely do it again.

Having no ingredients for BBQ sauce and a brisket on the smoker, I turned to this site and found this recipe.  It's definitely a good recipe.  I used a generic store brand cola but spiced it up with a little more brown sugar and the juice from half a lemon.  I also made another sauce and let the family pick.  This one was the better of the two.

This recipe is easy and tasty!  To cut calories I used diet coke instead of regular soda.  It came out great!

We used this on grilled chicken and it came out really good.  I like some other reviewer's suggestion to add liquid smoke, although I didn't do it this time, I will the next time I make it.  This is a really simple and good recipe.

Very basic, but has potential.  I made with diet coke to save calories.  It was good and my 4 yo daughter liked it because the taste was very mild.

This was great. I needed a quick last minute bbq sauce, and this was perfect. I adjusted the amounts, since I didn't have enough cola on hand. I kept the hot sauce off, but added worcestershire. I added pineapple preserves, and it was a delicious sauce for my chicken meatballs. Perfect appetizer!

EXCELLENT!
I added fresh pressed garlic.  This is much, much better than any prepared sauce and you can control the consistancy.  Cook it longer for a thicker sauce.

This is good, cheap and easy.  However, I added 3 - 4 tsp of liquid smoke to give it that extra zip.  Also added a little salt to cut down the sweetness

You wouldn't believe it, but this is actually good!  I used a Coke Zero, an entire small onion (chopped) and fresh minced garlic (instead of garlic powder).  Also ended up adding a good amount of worcestershire sauce and lots more freshly ground black pepper, which gave it even more depth.  I simmered it for a lot longer to help thicken it up even more.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

This sauce was really easy to make and we really liked the taste of it. I made a few changes. Diet cola instead of regular, 3 tablespoons of dehydrated onions instead of minced, real garlic (to taste) instead of powder and also a small amount of honey (maybe a tablespoon or so). I will be making this again.

I love this recipe.  It's simple to make with ingredients most of us already have in the kitchen.  Best of all it tastes good!  I made it the first time with the cola and the second time with Mello Yello.  That was good too.  It doesn't seem to matter which beverage you use.  The 1/2 tsp hot sauce gives it just the right blend of hot and sweet for us.

I really like this bbq sauce. I use it sometimes with my fried chicken (instead of gravy), which works really well! My family, even my picky 7yo, loves this sauce.

This was good but i think next time i will marinate longer. The overall flavour was great so i think the extra time will only enhance it.

It's not what I would call your typical BBQ sauce, but it did taste nice as a different type sauce on the meat.  Will use this again.

This sauce was pretty good. I added about a tablespoon of molassas and some red pepper flakes. It was a little on the sweet side, but good.

I used this sauce on steak and chicken and it was good on both.  I used fresh garlic as I didn't have garlic powder and I also added a couple drops of liquid smoke.  Everyone liked it.  I won't buy bottled sauce again.

Cleaning out my recipe box and forgot to rate this from a long time ago. This was ok, there are so many other outstanding barbecue recipes on here and I would have to doctor this up a lot to suit me.  This isn't bad, but it isn't great. Thanks.

This was simple and good.  I added a shot of maple syrup after the sauce was reduced in order to deepen the flavor.  Thanks for an easy and good recipe.

It's good and easy. I made it exactly according to the recipe, but upon tasting it I felt that it was just missing a little something. I adding a little lemon juice, Old Bay, Worcester Sauce & brown sugar as many reviews suggested. It was mild and sweet. I would have preferred it to have a bit more of a kick.

This was surprisingly very good.  I added brown sugar and hickory flavoring, served it over chicken breasts, and my family cleaned their plates.  It's the easiest, quickest barbecue sauce I've found.

Superfast and easy recipe. Although I didn't find the taste too sophisticated, I'm sure this sauce will do well with kids.

A good and easy BBQ sauce!  I used all of the ingredients, but I switched garlic powder for minced garlic instead.  I also added in chili powder, a little bit of Johnny's seasoning and some pepper.  The longer you cook it the thicker it will become.  It was sweet, but had a nice spicy bite!  I will make this again!

like it very much; it is basic so one can add whatever they have on hand and/or what they like.  It's like a process!  I added minced garlic, anaheim peppers I had frozen from last year and India Relish, used it with pulled turkey and it was very yummy.  The other thing I like about this sauce is that if I want to make it, I can get a can of regular cola from a vending machine, no need to keep a lot of sugary soft drinks in the house.

Very easy, I made it with diet coke and it worked wonderfully with our pulled pork.  So tasty, and only uses what most people have in the fridge.  No need for other spices, sometimes more is less!
