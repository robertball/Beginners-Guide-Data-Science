I added 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder because I read the review that said they were flat. They were delicious, pretty, and chewy. I will definitely make them again and again!!

My dad recently had heart surgery, so I was thrilled to find a cookie recipe that called for oil instead of solid fats.  I used canola oil, omitted the coconut, threw in an extra handful of oats, and added some Hershey's Special Dark chips for a heart-healthy cookie that everybody really liked.  Thank you for posting this!!

This was a tasty recipe to mix up and cook quickly.  I skipped the coconut and added 1 cup of white chocolate chips.  I reduced both sugars to 3/4 c. each, and reduced the oil to 1/2 cup.  After mixing, the batter seemed a bit dry, so I put in a tad more oil.  Very good flavor, and the texture is great - somehow they are chewy, crispy, and soft all at the same time.  The first pan I cooked a full 12 minutes; these came out kind of crunchy, but still a little chewy, and very good.  The second and subsequent pans, I cooked more like 9-10 minutes (took them out just before they looked done), let them cool on the pan for 2 minutes.  These were our favorites.  Delicious recipe and a bit healthier using oil vs. butter.  Thanks for sharing it.

This is my favorite cookie recipes. I printed this one off a couple of years ago. It is my go to recipe for an easy and delicious cookie. My husband goes wild for these! I find that one can decrease the amount of oil and sugar and still have a very delicious and chewy cookie! The trick is not to overbake them and to let them cool a bit before removing from pan. I gave these out to neighbors and friends this year for Christmas. (No one knows my secret--Allrecipes.com!) :)

Delicious! I am trying to avoid as much fat in my diet as possible (due to gallbladder issues) so these were perfect! I tend to find oatmeal cookies lacking something and I think I know what it is. The oats need to be toasted (I toasted very slowly in a dry non-stick pan until golden brown). I also toasted the coconut.  I used 2 eggs equivalent in egg whites and subbed 1/4 c applesauce for 1/4c oil. They are very sticky and hard to roll at first but once in the fridge and cooled down they are much easier to work with. I am also freezing some dough, I will let you know how it turns out. I think I cooked them for a bit longer than called for but I like my cookies crisper. They turned out crispy on the egdges and chewy and moist in the middle. I will be making these on a regular basis. THANK YOU!!
The dough froze well, I rolled the log shaped dough in parchment paper and then Saran wrap and put it in a Ziploc freezer bag. Let it defrost in the fridge and baked them sliced right off the log. Still very good!

These cookies took only ten mintues to prepare and that's a plus for a girl with an impatient sweet-tooth!  These were fantastic and I will double the batch next time!

These are wonderful, I did make a few minor alterations to the recipe, I subbed 1/2 cup of the oil with plain fat free yogurt and reduced the white sugar by 1/2 cup and tossed in a few chocolate chunks.

Delicious and rich tasting cookies!  I picked these because they use oil (I used canola).  Used half white and half whole-wheat pastry flour, and sea salt (it tastes better).  Added 1/2 cup raisins, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, and 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  I used the electric mixer and dropped spoonfuls onto the cookie sheets.  Mine spread out a lot while baking.  They disappeared quickly! We loved em!  Thanks for recipe.

This cookie recipe is really, really good. It was moist and VERY chewy--and chewy is good :o). Only thing is that personally, I thought it was too sweet. I even cut the white sugar to 3/4 cup and omitted the coconut---BUT---take it into account that I am a 'salty' muncher--not sweet. Very good oatmeal flavor---it is a keeper! Thanx for the recipe!!!

Ok well they didn't rise like the pic I see but I made a few changes so that could be why.  Ran out of oatmeal and only had 1/2 cup so replaced the rest with buckwheat flour (what I had on hand).  Subbed the white sugar with 1/3 cup of honey.  Used shredded instead of flaked coconut.  And I have kids - gotta add choco chips!  Oh and since I love cinnamon, I added maybe 1 tsp of that.  They took a bit longer to bake, were too soft while warm to eat, but once they cooled, amazing taste!  I wish I could customize this one but I'm not a paying member so there goes that idea.  :)  Great recipe though, I am sure even without all my subs the original would be just as amazing.

I love these cookies. They are my favorite oatmeal cookies and I eat nearly the entire batch every time I make them. (oops!) After reading other reviews I only use 1/2 cup each for the sugars, and I never have coconut, so that's left out. I decrease the oil to just a little more than half a cup because of the missing ingredients. 

And in my latest batch I tried adding 2 tablespoons cocoa powder and they are fantastic!

I wasn't blown away, but it was good. The only thing I did was adding the 1/2 tsp. baking powder so it would stand up a little more as others mentioned, and cut the sugars in half. It was plenty sweet. Raisins are a good addition. The batter will be quite oily but the cookies will turn out fine.

My husband baked these after changing the recipe to include butter instead of the oil because he likes the flavor butter adds to baking. He used fresh grated coconut rather than the flaked coconut, and added chopped walnuts. The cookies did spread out quite a bit, but despite their being sort of thin, they are chewy, besides being super delicious! These are now my favorite home made cookies.

These were great!  The batter seemed greasy but once baked they were delicious!  I did transfer them to paper towels to cool before plating them.

These came out all right. I tried replacing the oil w/ apple sauce and baking soda with baking powder (I was out) and they just tasted too cakey. Oh well, next time I won't mess with the ingredients!

I just made these for the first time. They are soooo good. Made them exactly as is and wished I had doubled the recipe.  Mine looked perfectly round and flat because I rolled into a ball and flattened with a fork slightly like it says to. It's supposed to look like that. It's good for stacking and taking to a party. Don't keep it in the oven until it looks done. Take it out as soon as you see it slightly browned. It will cook more on the pan.
Yummy chewy cookies. I might lessen the oil next time just because the cookies feel oily when you handle them. But this is definitely a keeper.

These are pretty good, not great in our opinion but better than they look. I was curious about this recipe, I never made one with oil before and I know oil is better than butter & shortening for cholesterol but I just don't know, I think I'd prefer other types of cookies instead. I did add 1/2c choc chips so my boys will eat them too lol

I totally screwed up when I was making these by adding 1 1/2 cups coconut instead of 1/2 cup, but they still turned out!!!  Love the fact that you make these all in one bowl too.  A keeper.

Great recipe, just too sweet! Cut the sugar in half and it's delicious. I changed the recipe as follows: 1/4 tsp salt, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1 cup rolled oats, 1 heaping cup coconut. All the rest the same ;-)

These cookies were pretty good; I mixed them using a wooden spoon instead of a mixer and used 1 1/2 cups brown sugar and 1/2 cup white granulated sugar. I am not sure if it was just from using a different amount of sugars but the cookies were awfully sweet! Not a complaint, more of a surprise!

5 stars with alterations.  I tried this with the recommended extra 1/2 t of baking powder and cut the sugar to 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/4 c white sugar, but I think they would be better without the extra baking powder and 1/2 c of both sugars.  I also added chopped almonds and dried fruit - dried apricot pieces work really well with this recipe.  Baking for 11 minutes turned out about right.  Everyone at work loved them!

The cookies were a little bit flat, but they were nice and chewy and pretty delicious. I thought they were especially good when they came out of the oven. I used a tablespoon to make pretty good sized cookies.

These were a breeze to make and turned out well…but a tad on the "too sweet" side.  Next time I'll cut down on the white sugar and maybe toss in some cinnamon!

This is a very good base recipe! Instead of the oats and coconut, I added cereal and chocolate chips. Very yummy!

I only made these because I had no butter handy, and the hubby and I had a sweets craving. I tweaked it a bit by adding cinnamon and raisins. I was very surprised at how much these cookies spread, so I suggest rolling them half the size of a walnut. They worked well for out sweet tooth, but I don't think I will make these again.

The dough seems very oily and I will try cutting back to 2/3 cup next time. I followed the suggestion of previous reviews and toasted the oats and coconut. I make some with and some with out chocolate chips. Both are very good.

Excellent and easy!! I don't like the taste of butter, so was thrilled to find a recipe using oil. I omitted the coconut, as I didn't have any. Instead I used raisins and nuts. I also added some cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.

First, I have impossible standards. These cookies did turn out flat, but so much the better. They were nice and crisp on the edges, but soft and chewy in the middle. I made them a tad larger than the recipe called for and ended up with a dozen monster oatmeal cookies. Good recipe.

oooooooh yum!!! So chewy, so flavourful, and hubby and the kids love them too. They are quite sweet so I would maybe cut down on the white sugar - but not the brown as that is what gives this cookie its chewiness.    Will be making this again and again!

These are VERY good!!   This recipe would I am sure be fabulous as is, however I made a few changes to the recipe due to food allergies, and my taste.   First, I substituted 2tbsp cornstarch + 4 tbsp water for the 2 eggs.  Second cut both types of sugar in half. I doubled the amount of coconut, and added about 1/4 cup of some allergy free/vegan chocolate chips.  I was also feeling lazy so dumped the batter into a greased 9x13 pan and baked for about 20min.  They were heavenly!!!  Chewy, Thick and rose beautifully.  Three days later, still chewy and very good!!!

First of all, listen to the recipe and form the dough into WALNUT sized balls! I used my traditional tablespoon sized cookies and they spread like crazy and ran together. Not a huge problem, but now I have giant cookies. Good thing they're so tasty - I don't think anyone will mind eating a huge one! I made these with dried cranberries. Next time I'll add a little cinnamon or cardamom - but they are great as they are.

These were delish. I also added dried cranberries, white chocolate chips, and walnuts. So good. Definitely do not overcook...by the third pan I figured out the timing and taking them out of the oven when they seemed just under cooked was perfect.  Also, I used grape seed oil and although the batter does seem oily, just hang with it, it works. I did keep the batter in the fridge between making the pans and that also seemed to help. Love these cookies! Thank you for sharing!

I have to say - this is one of my favorite oatmeal cookie recipes!  I cut both sugars to 3/4 cup and used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup white flour. I also used unsweetened coconut.  These were plenty sweet!  My kids insisted that I add mini-chocolate chips, which I did.  These were a hit in my house, for sure.

I really liked these, they work well on their own or asa base to add what you want. A word of caution though... I made these for my boyfriend as a protein/carb booster during a big bike race, and they really messed his stomach up. Combination of oats, sugars and fats can cause, well, gas. So watch out!

Okay, so some people may scoff at my customization, but I realized too late that I didn't have any rolled oats. So, I used two packets of Apple Cinnamon instant oatmeal. I also nixed the coconut, but let me tell you- the cookies are delicious. I probably should've used one more packet of oatmeal, though. Mainly because it seemed to really flatten the cookies out.   Still, it worked out well. The cookies are great!

I did not want to use oil so I excanged it for vegitable shortning, and I did not have or want to use coconut flakes so I used choclate chips. and I read about the flat cookies so I put in some baking powder aswell. So basically I changed the Recipe to this:

3/4 cup shortning
1 cup white sugar 
1 cup golden sugar(i did not have brown)
2 eggs 
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
1 1/2 cup flour 
1 1/2 cup quick oats
1 cup small unsweetened chocolate chips.

in oven for.. 12 minutes. let rest before transfering ot cooling rack.
 they brown  but if you don't leave them in long enough they are not cooked. 

and yes they are SWEET!

I am not sure if I will make this recipe again. I will see how it goes over.

I can't have butter, so I was happy to find this recipe.  They were delicious and very simple to make.  They really were done in 30 minutes!  I took the advice of someone else and used 1/4 cup less sugar, and they were still plenty sweet.  They are a little flat, which is not a problem, and a wonderful chewy texture.  Just make sure they cool a little on the sheet before you remove.  Thanks, Tanya.

I've been making these cookies for years, but the recipe I have was called, "Pride of Iowa Cookies."  They are SO good!  At Christmastime, I add Craisins to the recipe or red and green M & M's.  Other times I add some chopped walnuts.  They're also great with chocolate chips.  It's a really versatile recipe!

We LOVE these cookies! I used monk fruit zero calorie sweetener and regular brown sugar. I also omitted the coconut because I didn’t have any. Added semi sweet choc chips, and they came out absolutely perfect!

I swapped out the egg with a flax seed egg and used coconut oil instead of butter and they were delicious

I liked the recipe. Used real all purpose brown sugar so very sticky but healthier. I also used 1/2 the sugar and sweet enough. next time may even use less. Will keep it in my list.

Don't be afraid of using Coconut Oil in place of Vegetable Oil. I used an ice cream scoop for uniform balls (it was larger than a walnut) and the cookies spread when baking,  joining each other, probably from the size and maybe the coconut oil. They turned out so very good. Next time I won't add any chocolate chips, just want to enjoy the wonderful flavor without any enhancements. I'll bet no one can eat just one . 
 You'll need quite a bit of self control for these!  10 STARS!!!

Good cookies! Basically made it as is, except I cut the oatmeal back a 1/4 cup and added chopped pecans. Baked only 10 minutes. Nice a chewy and soft and yummy.

Added a third cup coconut oil instead of coconut flakes and reduced the oil to 1/2 cup. Also used whole wheat flour for half the amount needed. Used quick 'rolled' oats. Came out perfect.

I was craving a really good chewy crunchy oatmeal cookie. I altered this recipe and these are the BEST cookies ever ! Everyone will want the recipe and you can add and change up as you want. I only used 1/2  cup total oil.  I used 1/4 cup coconut and 1/4 sunflower oils. I used 1/4 cup white sugar and used 1/4 cup of raw brown sugar and 1 cup packed brown sugar. I added 3/4 cup of choc chips and left out the coconut flakes. I used 1/2 teaspoon baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon baking powder. I also prior to starting I toasted for a few minutes 2 cups of the OLD fashioned oats. I also mixed the oil and egg's and vanilla before I put in dry mixture I also added 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon. I chilled for a half hour and measured packing into a one tablespoon measuring spoon so they would bake well and be a nice size. I baked 5 minutes and turned sheet around for another 5 minutes and let sit 2 minutes and put on cooling rack.
If you make the cookies too big the middle wont bake well. I also put the dough back in frig in between baking. BEST cookies ever !!

These turned out a little oily  for my taste, however, the outsides were crusty and yummy.  Will make again with a couple tbsp's less oil. Thanks!

These are my husband’s favorite cookie! They are chewy and crisp on the edges, just perfect! I subbed chocolate chips for the coconut and they came out really well. Just make sure you space them out enough on the cookie sheet or else they will run together.

Yummy!  I added 1 tsp cinnamon, and got 28 cookies using my medium sized cookie scoop.  Next time I might reduce the sugar slightly.  But these are really chewy and good!!  Update:  2nd time around, I didn't have coconut, but added 1/2 cup peanut butter...mmmmm!

These cookies are great! Easy to make and I will keep this recipe as one of my favorites. I do not use white sugar so I substituted for raw sugar and I used Coconut Oil. I cooked them for the 10 minutes and they were soft and a bit chewy, just perfect! I like that you can change it up in a number of ways to make a different cookie; chocolate chips, raisins, nuts, etc.

My new favorite cookie.  After reading the reviews, I did add 1/2 tsp of baking soda.  The cookies were light and fluffy.  I also added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of craisins.  This will be a new go to cookie recipe.

I made a few change to the basic recipe which I doubled -- mainly changing the oil for butter.  Like others, I cut the sugar back a bit, added 3 tbsp of cocoa, and some sliced almonds I had in the pantry.    they are wonderfully flavored, and look just like the photos.  I will make more of these in the future.

Quite the hit! I followed the advice of other reviewers and added 1/2 tsp of baking soda. Also didn't use coconut. I also used approx total of 1 cup of salted caramel chips and semi-sweet chocolate chips. Pretty sweet cookies so next time with probably use just caramel chips. Yummy!

Didn't have coconut, but made them without it.  Added raisons and some cinnamon instead.  Replaced sugar with artificial sweetner, same with the brown sugar.  These turned out so good they reminded me more of the old fashioned oatmeal raisin cookies I haven't had in years.

These were some of the best cookies ever, but I did alter the recipe.  I omitted the white sugar and added half cup of chopped walnuts, apricots and white chocolate.  Before baking, the mixture was quite crumbly, but moist.  I formed the cookies on the baking sheet (3-4 inches in diameter) and baked 12-14 minutes.  The cookies came out crisp but soft in the center and the perfect amount of sweetness.  This recipe is one for the archives.

I doubled this recipe based on my trust of  the reviews.

The following change calculations are based on the single recipe amounts:
I added 1/2 tsp baking powder, minimized the white sugar by half, added approx 1/4 tsp each of cardamom and cinnamon.
The cookies were baked in 10 min (yumm!).  

I'm keeping them in a sealed container so they keep their  chewiness.  Will definitely make them again and again!!

LOVE THESE COOKIES!!   I am tired of the regular chocolate chip, actually not really, but wanted to try something relatively healthy.  I don't know if this cookie is that with 2 cups of sugar.  Anyway, the only change I made was instead of oil, I used applesauce.  Made it even healthier.  I loved the texture and the coconut.    Great job!

Followed recipe exactly and added some chocolate chips.  Great texture!  Might cut the sugar a bit next time since I used sweetened coconut.  This is a keeper!

Excellent and easy! I never bake and these turned out delicious. I took some of the modifications from other reviews; added 1tsp of Baking Powder and Decreased my Sugar to 1/2 C, also I used the Raw Organic Sugar.  I did not use Coconut or Raisins...and they are so good I can't stop eating them!

My adult son adores oatmeal cookies so I tried this recipe since I had no butter. These are the best oatmeal cookies we've ever made. They are crispy and chewy at the same time and relatively quick and easy to make. I made no changes to recipe and cooked them in a convection toaster oven. We even made a batch together. Big fun!

This is my go to recipe for cookies! For an amateur baker like myself, I've used this recipe maybe three or four times- and every time has been successfully delicious. I've used left over corn flakes, crushed honey roasted sunflower seeds etc instead of the oat component. I also used canola oil because I don't have vegetable oil. I put less white sugar in the mix and even added a little nutmeg one time.

These are very moreish! Thanks for a great, dairy-free cookie recipe. They are disappearing fast this weekend. It also seems like a great base recipe--I wanted to find a dairy-free oatmeal raisin cookie, and I think this could be a great start for that.

Delicious. I thought they were slightly oily, though. I only used 1 1/2 cups of total sugar and I think they were perfect. Great cookie recipe for when you're out of (or don't want to use) butter.

Delicious!  Took the suggestion of adding 1/2 t. of baking powder and, to accommodate a vegan friend, substituted chia seeds for eggs (instead of 2 eggs, mix 2 T. chia seeds with 6 T. water and let set 10+ minutes until it turns into a gel).  These might just be my family's new favorite cookie.

So easy, I should have refrigerated for about 10 minutes before cooking cookies because they flattened out too much but I was hungry for homemade cookies.  I've added to my recipe box.  Oatmeal and coconut 2 of my favorite combos. Can't wait for the family to try.

I really like the way these cookies turned out :)   I added the 1/2 tsp baking powder as mentioned before in another review, I used a 1/2 cup white sugar instead of the full cup. I also added 1/2 cup raisins and used non stick cooking spray on my cookie sheet because it said prepared sheet but didn't tell you specifically how to prepare them. I baked the first dozen for nine minutes there were a little goey in the center after cooling so I did the remaining dough for ten minutes and they turned out great!

I made these cookies but added some walnuts, raisins, and about 1/2 cup from a bag of (raisins, cranberries, dried apple pieces, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds) that I bought at Sam's club. They turned out scrumptious. If I had not added anything extra they would have still tasted scrumptious. This is a great recipe. I love the coconut in it too. Thanks you Tanya Anderson for the recipe. My daughter is going to love them; she is a cyclist and a runner. She is in triathlons all the time.

I never rated any recipes before.  But this one is so easy and yummy. I did reduce the white sugar to 1/4 cup. One thing i have to mention is: I made the first batch which i thought was too soft when the cookies were still warm.  So i decided to put the second batch back into the turned off oven for another 40 minutes. It turned out incredible good.  These "over cooked" cookies are hard, crunchy in a very good way. Plus, those ones which i thought were too soft are actually very good too when they are cold. My husband had 4 of each version. I know.....TOO MANY :)

My cookies came out flat, but they tasted delicious.  My husband loved them. I added a 1/2 tsp of baking power suggested by another reviewer to help them rise but it didn't work for me. I also added raisens to the recipe which made them very chewy and sweet.  In the end I will make them again but I will probably chill the dough overnight to help the cookies rise in the oven.

LOVE these cookies... by coincidence, My Dad's mom was named Dorothy, too LOL. These remind me of the cookies Ikea carries. I have no idea why these taste so buttery with no butter in them, but we make them sans coconut and sometimes add chocolate chips. If they get a bit crisp they are awesome with a cup of tea. Also liked with added cinnamon. SUCH an easy recipe to change up for variety, but it is our favorite as is.

This was absolutely delicious. We used organic Coconut flour and when it partnered with the coconut flakes, it was DIVINE!! I added a little extra baking soda and they were chewy and rather large!! A quick and easy recipe that i'll use again and share. :) Can't wait to make more! Yumm!!

Pretty new to this whole baking thing but try orange extract instead of vanilla - pretty great cookie.  I also added another 1/2 cup of oatmeal (used quick oats) and liked the consitency better.  Haven't tried cutting the white sugar down as suggested by others but they do seem a little sugary so I'm going to try this next time.

I made lots of alterations to this recipe. I used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/4 cup oil. after I blending the ingredients the dough was liquid-ish. I added another cup and 1/4 of flour. I made some with a coconut topping but I think its a little too sweet that way. I used semisweet chocolate chips for the rest and they taste really really good. the chocolate balances out the sweetness

Oh yeah.  I followed everything in the recipe and these cookies were great!  The lack of spices made me leery and intrigued at the same time, so of course I had to make this!  It's a very different recipe than the one I've used my whole life, but it's a good difference.

I am SO glad that I reduced the sugar, as others suggested!!!  I used 1c brown sugar and 1/4c white sugar--next time, I'll just leave out the white sugar entirely.  I'll also reduce the oil to 1/2c and add 1/2c unsweetened applesauce & see how that works.  I added 2t cinnamon, next time it'll be a full tablespoon--plus 3/4c raisins, but no coconut on hand.  Thanks to a review, I toasted the oatmeal first and I really do think that enhanced the flavor.  I also added juice from 1/2 lemon, in order to activate that baking soda a bit more, and it worked!  They did NOT flatten all that much.  In my oven, 11 minutes gave me cookies that are crispy around the edges and chewy in the middle--I like the texture.

This is a wonderful recipe. I use 1 & 1/2 tsp baking powder as I do not like the taste of baking soda and it turns out great. I add slightly more flower (1/8 of a cup extra) and use 2 cups of oats and just slightly less oil than 3/4 cup. And around 3/4 cup of each sugar. I haven't tried them with the coconut. I have made them with dried cranberries and with chocolate chips and both are marvelous.

Great recipe, with some changes. I add a tsp. of cinnamon, because I love spices in my oatmeal cookies, and I add 1/2 tsp. baking powder to keep them from flattening too much. I usually don't have coconut on hand, so I either add a little extra oats, or today I substituted raisins for the coconut. My 10 yo daughter made this recipe today by herself, it's so easy, and always turns out great.

These cookies were great! I read some of the other reviews and made some changes by adding 1/2 tsp. baking powder and reducing the sugar amounts to 1/2 cup of each. I also omitted the coconut and added some cinnamon. They took an hour to make from start to finish! So easy and delicious, and are made with ingredients you probably have in your pantry.

So chewy and flavorful! I decreased the sugar as well, but they were still a little to sweet for me. Next time I might try 1/2c each. Overall, though, wonderful cookies!
