I made this for 4th of July, and it was a HUGE hit!  It was easy, served a large crowd, and had people begging for seconds!  Looks like something you spent a lot of time and effort on, but was really quick, easy, and delicious!

I have not sat down to take a bite but I have tasted all the components to this recipe.  And all components are fantastic.  I will say, I have a trifle bowl that has a stand on the bottom (I hope that makes sense).  Therefore, it is not one big glass bowl.  Because of this, I do not think you will need 3 lbs of strawberries.  2lbs in my case would have been plenty.  Same with the pound cake.  One would have been enough (I made my own so I knew I would have leftovers).  Also,  I did not use the rum.  I think it would have added a really nice touch but I didn't have any and I am serving this to kids as well.  Overall, really nice.

This was easy to make and looks beautiful. I didn't use the rum because I made it for children and adults. If I made it for just adults, I would add the rum...yum!
I did have lots of left over pound cake and some strawberries.

Use greek yogurt
 that is thicker and then just a light cream or even try 2% milk next time. Use angel food cake and you've got yourself a low cal dessert! (and use honey to sweeten the strawberries instead.)

LOVE IT! Yes I only used 2 pounds of strawberries (two containers) and like 8 oz of blueberries, and one and 3/4 of one 14 oz pound cakes. It all depends on the size of your dish! But the cream was perfect, you can't have too much cream. (We used 4 TBs of rum. Sshh!)

My 10 year old daughter and I have made this twice with rave reviews. Yesterday we served it on the beach to all our friends.  We have used French Vanilla pudding with lemon yogurt but we want to try coconut pudding and add some coconut and pineapple. There are so many possibilities to this recipe.  It also keeps well in the frig for a few days before serving

I never leave reviews but, I just made this today for my son's 4th birthday party. I got rave reviews on it. It was all gone before I even got to have some, fortunately I had leftovers when I made it. I did make a few minor changes to it. My family wasn't too up on the white chocolate pudding and lemon yogurt so I went with vanilla yogurt and lemon pudding. Gave it an amazing taste. I will DEFINATELY be making this again and my husband even asked me if our next party was tomorrow so we could have it again. Fabulous recipe!!!

This is delicious, and a beautiful dessert for a friend who just became a US citizen!  My trifle bowl must be a lot smaller than the one in the picture, because I filled it up and had enough fruit, cake and cream to make another smaller trifle.  The next time I will buy a little less fruit and maybe just 1 pound cake.

Kids loved it at our 4th of July event! Adults too! Definitely will make again. Use toothpicks on top so that you can cover the dessert without the mess getting on saran wrap.

This was great, thanks for sharing this recipe.   It was a perfect dessert to serve on the patio after our 4th of July cookout.
The only thing I would consider doing differently next time would be to whip the cream separately from the yogurt, rum. pudding mixture and then fold them together.  It could have been because of the heat in the house (the  sliding doors were open for everyone who was going in and out) but I had a difficult time getting the cream fluffy.  It was still delicious!  Thanks again!

Made this for 4th of July party and everyone loved it - kids and adults! I had more than enough ingredients to make two trifles, so this recipe probably was meant to fit a large trifle bowl - like those cake platters that turn upside down. Next time I'll use just one pound cake, 2 pounds strawberries and 3C of cream to fit my smaller bowl. I also think I'll try coconut yogurt and drizzle both layers of cake with rum for added flavor. And there will be a next time! This was a fun recipe to make together with my 10yo daughter.

i made this recipe for a housewarming party and it was a HUGE hit! i was told that i am mandated to bring this with me everywhere i go from here on out. i made my own pound cake using grandmother's pound cake II from this site, and it was perfect. the only change i made was i used french vanilla pudding mix, as i could not find white chocolate. i also added chocolate chips.

I didn’t think the whipped cream was sweet enough.  Maybe next time I will use two vanilla pudding mixes.  It serves a lot so be sure you are having a crowd!  Looks beautiful, very festive!

Delicious!  I substituted cool whip (because it is my husbands favorite) for the home made whip cream and made one with and without the coconut rum.  Will definitely make this again!

Beautiful, easy dessert !  If you make your own pound cake do
not cube the last 4 or 5 pieces,
wait & see if you need it.  I did a
pound cake cake mix in a bundt
pan and did not need the last four
pieces.  Used a 2# carton of strawberries & only used 1& 1/2#,
large blueberries and had at least
a cup left.  Bought a coconut rum
at the liquor store (the airline size) and it makes the 3 Tbsp you
need for the cake. Did not sugar
my strawberries as they were sweet enough.  Highly recommend any time.

Absolutely delicious....YUM! However, I have never seen a trifle dish big enough to fit all these ingredients. I have a good size trifle dish, and I pretty much halved the ingredients and it barely fit. My husband said it's because I used half the bottle of rum.

It was so easy to make and was delicious! My only complaint was that I had a whole pack of strawberries and blueberries and also had half a pound cake left. I would also suggest making a double batch of the cream because I felt there wasn't enough to have two layers.

My daughter and I made this together. It was fun, delicious and turned out beautifully. Taking the time to slice enough strawberries in half to carefully line the side of the bowl made a big difference on the look of this dish. We did not use the rum and we substituted French Vanilla for white chocolate because we couldn't find any.

An absolute favorite at cookouts....plus the homemade whipped cream recipe can be used for other recipes (I added a dollop to my cup of coffee...yum!). This is definitely a recipe I will make again and again in the summer.

This was easy to make and a huge hit! It’s very delicious but be careful not to over beat otherwise it’s a thick pudding rather than a creamy consistency.

I made this for 4th of July and it got great reviews from everyone.  I also found that the full recipe made a lot of dessert - but then I did double the cream as others suggested.  I used a 12 cup bowl and I  had enough to make 1 1/2 bowls.   The only thing I would change the next time is to add more lemon to the cream - perhaps it was my brand of yogurt but it wasn't as strong of a lemon flavor as I would have liked.

Made this for our July 4th celebration 2019. It was wonderful! Looked so patriotic sitting on my table. I did not change a thing. It is perfect exactly as written.

 Thank you for this recipe.

This was a winner! And, so quick and easy! I love when I make something for a party and it all goes :-) Someone told me they had 3 servings of it because it was so good :-) I made a few changes - I used angel food cake already made from the grocery store bakery (huge time saver); 8oz of Cool-Whip, instead of making homemade whipped cream (which I will do the next time - I just had Cool-Whip from another dessert I wanted to use up); 2-5oz containers of Greek lemon yogurt and the smaller box of Jello instant vanilla pudding. I love all the different variations you can make of this recipe. Thanks so much for sharing it.

Fabulous! Next time I might put more coconut rum in it, and perhaps add some lemon zest.

I used only half the ingredients and it filled my dessert bowl exactly.  Everyone liked it, but we were wishing for more juice from the strawberries to soak into the cubes.  Also I used the coconut rum but could not detect it in the cream (didn’t get to the bottom where I sprinkled it on the cake).  Used vanilla pudding; couldn’t find white chocolate.  Will make again!

Huge hit!  As a tip, I’d cut the strawberries in small cubes.  The moisture seems to come from the strawberries.  As they give off their liquid the remaining fruit loses its color and gets a mooshy texture.  Larger slices call attention to this.  

I do like topping the cake with large slices.  (Don’t use my trifle as your example to aspire to!). However, I’d try to figure out a clear sugar glaze to better preserve the look of the strawberries.

As my cut strawberries sat coated in sugar in a bowl waiting to be added to the trifle, they were already releasing liquid.  I poured this liquid over the top of the trifle when I was done with the layers.

I did use cheesecake flavored pudding mix because white chocolate wasn’t available.  I’m sure it’s good either way.

Finally, I used food coloring in my cake layers to make more festive.

I could not find the exact size of lemon yogurt, so I added two  small ones.  The creme worked up beautifully.  I did not add rum.  I had so much left over after the trifle bowl was full, I believe I have enough to do another!  Can't wait to eat it!

Made it for a party, and it was very popular.  Not too sweet and the cream reminded me of white chocolate mousse.  I think it would have been better with a little less whipping cream so the other flavors could come out more. I will make it again!

Had this last night at a Fourth of July party and it was awesome! All the ladies wanted the recipe and my husband insisted I make it NOW!  The one who prepared it said she  
 found it here and followed the recipe  exactly except for adding more rum.

I made this for a BBQ this summer.  It was a big hit.  The only thing I changed was the presentation of how I served it.  I used small cups and made individual servings and that was a huge hit!  Also because I had children at the cookout I omitted the rum! Will definitely make again!!

This was a definite hit! Of course, I made a few adjustments.  I used kiwi and strawberries for the fruit and just one pound cake. I used Truwhip (no high fructose) instead of whipping cream and Rum extract, not Rum. This was yummy and true crowd pleaser. I will certainly make this again with other fruit possibly.

I did not add sugar to the strawberries (as they were naturally sweet enough:). Based on another recipe (can't remember which), I added 8 oz cream cheese and used vanilla extract. Beautiful, tasty desert!

I made this for the Fourth for a party. But they didn't say it was WHIPPING cream we needed..so my topping  was quite liquid.  (It says heavy cream!!) So that was disappointing. Also I didn't find the topping sweet enough.

This is so delicious! Everyone who tried it loved it, and it was so pretty and easy. I didn't use the coconut flavored rum, because my family and I don't use alcohol, but I am thinking of trying plain coconut flavoring next time I make it.
