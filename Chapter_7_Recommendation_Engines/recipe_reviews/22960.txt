Delicious!  I cut sugar from 2 Cups down to 1 & 1/2 C. Also cut oil from 1 & 1/2 Cups to 1/2 C. oil and substituted a 1/2 C. applesauce.  I used a bag of mini choc. chips and made them into mini muffins.  Took these to my kids MMO (Mother's Morning Out) class for a Thanksgiving treat.  Would probably cut back choc. chips next time to just a Cup as the pumpkin taste was a little overwhelmed by the choc. chips.

Great muffin!  I made these for Thanksgiving.  Listened to alot of the prior variations.  Used 1/4 cup oil and 1 1/2 cups of applesause. Added 1tsp. pumpkin pie spice.  They were great!  The key to keeping them moist for days is to wrap each muffin individualy.  I wraped them like that and they were VERY moist for 4 days!!  Great gift idea too!

Quick and tasty.  Too much oil as written. 1 cup of oil is plenty.

When I first took a bite of one of these hot muffins, the first word out of my mouth was "WoW."  I didn't follow the recipe exactly b/c I didn't have everything, changed things here and there, doubled the recipe AND I took the advice of others.  
//Here are some things that I changed:

/**decreased oil to two cups (in a single recipe, it would have been reduced from 1 1/2 cups to 1 cup [would have preferred to use part applesauce but was out])**
/**used whole wheat flour and added wheat gluten**
/**The cinnamon was freshly ground**
/**added 1/2 a teaspoon of ground cloves [I might have added more except it was my first time and I didn't want to botch a doubled recipe}**
/ **Instead of semisweet chocolate chips, Guittard [brandname] Choc-Au-Lait (white chips)were used**
TIP: Keep an eye on muffins after 14-16 minutes -they MAY BE overcooked or slightly burned at around 18 minutes.

I made a half recipe of this. Instead of vegetable oil, I used melted butter. I didn't want to use a whole 3/4 cup of melted butter so I cut the amount in half again and used more pumpkin. I cut the sugar back to a half cup for a HALVED recipe and I used half of a bag of Hershey's cinnamon chips that I had on hand instead of chocolate chip only because I was out. I was a little concerned about the muffin batter because it was so thick but these turned out beautifully. And the smell? Oh my goodness. The one issue I have is there isn't enough cinnamon. Next time, I'll double the amount of cinnamon or use a teaspoon or so of pumpkin pie spice. Texture wise, these were wonderful and I didn't miss the sugar or butter that would have been in them had I not cut the amounts in half. NOTE: I always bake my muffins at 350 for 20 minutes. That was absolutely spot on baking temperature/time for these muffins.

These muffins were moist, good and easy to make, but a bit to oily for my taste. The second time I made them I decreased the oil by 1/2 cup and added a 1/2 cup more pumpkin, vanilla and spice (cinnamon and nutmeg) much tastier!

These are very good - even my picky 6 year old loves them.  I took previous advice and only used one cup of oil.  I also increased pumpkin by 25% and used mini chocolate chips.  We make them several times in the fall and freeze them.  Then we just take a couple out at a time to eat. We love them!

Fantastic muffins - so yummy!  I only add 1/4 cup of oil.  I don't substitute and the muffins still come out moist and delicious.  I'm not sure why so much oil is included in the original recipe.  I also use chocolate chunks rather than chips - they are just really really good muffins!

I made these muffins as a "munchie" for the kids at our Thanksgiving get-together.  Instead of making the regular sized muffins, I made mini muffins, using mini chocolate chips.  I decreased the oven temperature to 375 and baked them for 10-14 minutes.  They turned out GREAT!  I ended up having about 80-90 mini-muffins.  I took 50 to our Thanksgiving celebration and froze the rest.  I should have taken them all -- they were gone within an hour!!  I've already forwarded this recipe to 4 people!  A huge hit!  Thank you, Laurie!!!!!

AWESOME!!!  I made this recipe using 1/2 cup peanut oil, 1 cup of applesauce, and I also added 1 cup of chopped walnuts!  In addition, I added 1 teaspoon of nutmeg along with the cinnamon, and used just one cup of milk chocolate chips.  Excellent!  I will be making this again very soon!  Laurie, thanks for a great new recipe!

This is a muffin/cupcake crossover, because they are light and chocolatey.  I used 3/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup cinnamon applesauce to reduce fat, but maintain light consistency.  I make a lot of muffins and these are quite good as a seasonal treat.  I got 30 muffins out of the batter.

This made way more than 24 muffins, I got 36. My 2 year old helped make them, and they were still easy to make in a short time!  They were a hit with the world's two pickiest eaters-my daughter and husband.

What a wonderful recipe!  I used slightly less oil and they still turned out great; my boyfriend and I both loved them!  In fact, they were so good I plan to make them for a Halloween party so that my friends can enjoy them to!

Excellent muffins! Everyone from my parents to my kids (5 and 2) loved them!! Even my dad, who doesn't like pumpkin! And very easy - my 5 year old made most of it. We frosted them with a cream cheese icing. Lovely!

I found a can of pumpkin puree in the back of my cabinet leftover from the fall. Decided to use it to make this recipe. Other than adding 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie mix, I made the recipe exactly as directed. I got 24 regular size muffins and 6 mini-mffins. They have a good flavor, but I think I will add more pumpkin pie spice along with the cinnamon. I did use the entire amount of oil indicated in the recipe, but the end result made the muffin paper seem a little too greasy. Next time (and there will be a next time) I will reduce it to 1 cup. Thanks for the recipe!!

I really changed this recipe up, hence, the four stars (though what I made I would give five).  Here are changes...I will go in order of the ingredients listed.  1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown, 3/4 cup veg oil and 3/4 cup applesauce, 1.5 cups white flour and 1.5 cups whole wheat flour, added 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice, used a scant tsp of salt instead of the full tsp, and used the mini ch. chips to taste.  Used the silicone mini muffin pans and they turned out great.  Did about 15 minutes for the mini muffins.  Would make these again as my version was very moist yet fully baked through.

These were very yummy!  I did, however, add only 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of the oil.  I also used baked pumpkin (left over from Halloween) instead of canned.  I made 1 batch of muffins and liked them so much that I made a loaf out of the second batch.  Will make again :)

Made these for teacher and neighbor Christmas gifts, they were great.  Used 1 c of oil, 1/2 c of applesauce, a little under 2 c of choc chips, only 1 & 1/2 c of sugar and they were plenty sweet.  Would definitely use this recipe again!

I made these muffins exactly as written, and they are awesome! I couldn't even believe that I made something so good without a mix! It does seem like a lot of oil, but if you want healthy, find a recipe for bran muffins:) these are great, and i wouldnt change a thing, and i am so glad I didnt!

I used 1/2 cup less oil than the recipe called for and added some vanilla, b/c I love vanillas. Didn't think the choco chips were overwhelming, but I'm a chocolate lover! You can barely taste the pumpkin in these, but they are creamy (you have to use the right kind of oil... I use Wesson 100% Canola and it's amazing for baking) and a nice treat. My co-workers all loved them, even though they thought it was a weird combo (until they tasted it). I guess it would be a weird combo if it were more pumpkin-y. Will definitely make these again when I'm in the mood for chocolate chip cupcakes, but not if I'm in a pumpkin mood. :)

Very good.  Made this for my coworkers as a post Thanksgiving treat.  Although a number of them didn't make it to work because my husband and I couldn't stop "tasting" them to make sure they were okay to bring to others.  They were so moist and soft.  Very delicious.    The only things I changed was how much sugar I put in them...but that was because I ran out of sugar at about 1 1/2 cups.  Oops - better plan ahead next time :)   I will definitely make these again, and would suggest that others give them a try as well.  A wonderful fall treat...that I will now go have for breakfast before work :)

Used applesauce for the oil, 1/2 splenda for the sugar, egg whites, whole wheat flour and blueberries instead of chocolate chips.  The result was amazing, they are so moist and sweet that this is one of the few recipes where I have made healthy substitutions and you wouldn't know the difference!

I really liked this recipe.  I tried it twice now.  The first time, I used the chocolate chips, but the chocolate chips were so overwhelming that I couldn't taste the pumpkin.  So the next time, I omitted the chocolate chip, add 1/2 can more pumpkin and 1 1/2 cups of applesauce instead of oil (I just realized how many calories there was in apple sauce compared to oil).  They turned out great.  I love them this way.  These turned out like mini-souffles.  These are definately a seaonally tradition for our family!

We really enjoyed these muffins.  I did substitute apple sauce for the oil, though.  The first batch that I made seemed to be overwhelmed by the chocolate chips.  I halved the amount of chocolate chips and the relsult was quite delightful.  I also iced one batch of muffins with maple frosting.  They were great. I brought them to my daughter's soccer practice, where the kids and parents all had seconds and I had no leftovers!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I don't think these were anything too special, they tasted like the chocolate chips overwhelmed the pumpkin taste, if I do make them again I will not put chocolate chips in them and I'll probably add more pumpkin and spices to up the flavor a bit more.  I also used to applesauce in place of the oil, maybe that muted the pumpkin flavor.  Though made them lower in fat.

I made these with fresh pumpkin, only 3/4 cup oil and substituted whole wheat flour for one cup of the all-purpose flour. They came out awesome. My kids can't keep their hands off of them.

These were great, but like others I tried to lighten them a bit.  I've been experimenting with replacing slightly healthier ingredients so I did the following replacements:
2 cups whole wheat flour, 1 cup white
1 1/2 cups sugar in the raw, 1/2 white sugar
1 cup applesauce, 1/4 cup oil
1 1/2 cups of mini choc chips (versus 2 cups)

They really turned out great!  Very light though, not dense.  Also, I made them a bit smaller and got 28 out of the batch.  If you follow WW, they were 5ptplus each that way.  Next time, I may just go with a cup of choc chips

Made these for the first time tonight!  They're tasty but could be more pumpkin-y.  I added vanilla extract, pumpkin pie spice and more cinnamon than the recipe called for, but I think I'll adjust the spices more when I make them again.

Yum, these muffins are going to be a new Fall tradition for me.  I made some modifications to make it a bit healthier.  Used 1 C white sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar.  Reduced the oil to 3/4 C and added 3/4 C unsweetened applesauce.  Used 2 C all purpose flour and 1 C whole wheat flour.  Finally I increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp.  It turned out great!  I had 24 mini muffins and 14 regular sized muffins.

quite good and simple enough; they turn out great without so much oil indeed. I put bittersweet chocolate morsels, I wonder, what if I had white chocolate ones and also, maybe ground pecans are a good addition?

An ok muffin...but not much flavor.  Way too much oil for this recipe.  "If" I were to make them again I would cut the oil in half and replace it with additional pumpkin.

These muffins have been a favorite of ours for the past few years. My son would gladly eat them for breakfast every morning.
Here are the adjustments we make to the recipe: 3/4 c. oil, 2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2-3/4 c. mini chocolate chips.  I also split the flour 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 all purpose.  I have also substituted 1/2 c. of the sugar with Splenda.

I have made these muffins for the past few years and they have been a great hit each time. As others have stated the oil in recipe is way way too much. I use about 1 cup and it works great. I use white chocolate chips and they are a big hit. Both my and my husband's family have requested I make them for the upcoming holidays. Even people who are not into pumpkin (such as myself) will love them because the pumpkin it is not overpowering.

I look forward to these every fall and winter!  I agree that less oil is a good idea and making mini-muffins (with mini chocolate chips) is a great idea too.

These make a delicious dessert, addition to meals, quick breakfast or chocolately snack

My family loves this recipe.  After reading the reviews I followed the recipe except I changed the amount of oil.  I used a 1/2 cup oil and 1 cup of applesauce.  They really turned out good.  Thank you for the recipe!!

This is a wonderful recipe loved by young and old alike.  I have made a few changes to boost the health aspect.  I have decreased the amount of white flour and added oatmeal and whole wheat flour.  I have also decreased the amount of oil and added a bit more pumpkin.  The are yummy and even the kids can't tell!

Not a pumpkin fan, but these were awesome.  I halved the recipe, used less sugar, and replaced the oil with applesauce.  They tasted great!  Will definitely make again, probably for Thanksgiving.

Crazily good.  I made 3 batches of these over Halloween.  And now that Jack-o-lantern pumpkins are on sale, I'll be making plenty more.  I didn't find any problem using regular fresh pumpkin puree instead of canned or sugar pumpkin.  Also, I used broken-up Hershey's kisses instead of chocolate chips, and when those were out I used walnuts and raisins, sometimes both.  One batch made about 34 muffins for me.  An excellent seasonal treat.

I followed the recipe for these verbatim. Like others have said, 1 1/2 cups of oil is too much! If I were to use this recipe again, I'd cut it back to 1 cup at least. Other than that, they were super tasty.

Beautiful and moist muffins. I left chocolate chips out of it and switch oil with 100 g butter. Really lovely they are. As well I made my own pumpkin puree. Delicious! Thank you for sharing it.

Rather than chocolate chips, added small diced granny smith apple; half cup less sugar; increased spices; 1/2c oil; added 1t vanilla (I had to.)  I bet these would be very good with soaked raisins instead of chips.  'Not a big fan of apples in muffins, but these were cut small enough that they cooked.  'Don't like baked muffin & crispy apple combo.  :o  I faked streusel with a little plain bread crumbs, half pinch or less sugar & half a shake cinnamon.  'Like 'em! ... So modifications: 1 1/2c sugar, 1/2c oil, 1 1/2t cinnamon, 3/4t ginger, 1/8 + 1/4t nutmeg. 'Think I'll try using 2t cinnamon, 1t ginger, 1/2t nutmeg - & leave out the apples.  375 20mins.

Very yummy! Only use 1 C oil and add extra 1/2 C pumpkin. Also, I'm high altitude, so I tossed the choco chips in a few tbsp of flour and added to the mix - kept the chips from sinking and helped the batter.

This is a delicious recipe! The first time, I made it "as is" and my family ate it up! The subsequent times I made these muffins, I read other reviews first and made my own customizations to the recipe. Here are the changes I made...

Preheat oven to 350
use 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 (or little less) of sugar
1/2 cup veggie oil is plenty (next time I will try applesauce as a replacement)

Add a dash of pumpkin spice to the top before baking

 and bake for aprox 25 min or until tooth pick in center comes out clean!

A cream cheese frosting compliments the muffins nicely!

Happy fall:)

This was very good. I too followed the advice of others and only used 1.5 cups sugar, 1/2c oil and 1/2c apple sauce, and added 1tsp pumpkin pie spice. I only cooked them for 14 mins, and they were still a little overdone, so next time I think I'll try cooking at 375 degrees. Delicious.

This recipe is perfect. Just the right amount of sweetness, very light and fluffy muffins. I did not add the chocolate chips but am sure they would make a nice addition (next time.) I might try replacing half the white sugar with light brown sugar next time just to experiment, but these are wonderful as is!!!

Very yummy indeed, I just felt that it was overloaded with unnecessary fat content....I used 3 eggs instead of 4; a bit less sugar, used 1/2 parts wheat flour/white & used some yogurt, water, & flax seed in place of some of the oil...guess i should have just posted my own recipe, haha.

I loved this recipe EXCEPT the chocolate chips overpower the pumpkin flavor. My kids loved this since they *say* they don't like pumpkin but I love pumpkin so next time I will use less chocolate chips.

I added a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of cocoa powder.   And since we were out of chocolate chips, I chopped part of a Ghiradelli double-chocolate bar.  Not as pumpkiny as I would have liked, but still good.

These are yummy, but a bit dry.  I think I'll try one of the apple/pumpkin recipes next time.  I also would need to adjust this for high altitude, which I forgot to do.  (I'm at 4,500 feet.)

Yum!  I used half applesauce for the oil and they were still delicious and moist.  I also ran out of sugar while making them so used 1 C. sugar and 1 C. brown sugar.  We like these spicier so added allspice and also used dark chocolate chips.  They disappeared very quickly!

Wonderful, tasty! I baked two pumpkins halfs  wrapped in foil for about 40 min. I put 2/4 oil and 1/4 butter instead of only 3/4 oil and it made the crust more crustier and delicious. Also I use half cup white sugar and half cup brown bake sugar instead of one cup of white sugar. One more touch - zest of half of lemon. I baked 12 muffins for 20 mins and they turned out so goooood!!

I had yummy pumpkin muffins in 40 minutes from to finish.  Quick and easy, I was able to whip these up before we headed out the door for school.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I used 3/4 cup of applesauce in place of the oil and whole wheat flour in place of the all purpose.

I just made these wonderful muffins. The only thing I changed is the pumpkin, I used fresh sugar pumpkin instead of the canned pumpkin. They came out amazing, they were moist. I will make these again.

I just made these to take to a womens' bible study meeting.  They are fabulous!  I made them exactly as the recipe was written.  Yes, it does seem like a lot of oil, but they are so moist and so good.  The only thing I did different was to make them in mini-muffin tins.  I cut the bake time down to 14 minutes and turned the heat down to 375.  These are a keeper.  I may put some up in the freezer as well.  Enjoy....

These were yummy! Both of my daughters liked them, which is miraculous! I only used 1 cup of oil and will probably use even less next time. I also added about 1/4 cup of wheat germ for added nutrition and it wasn't even noticeable in the taste. I also used 2 cups of wheat flour and 1 cup of white. There was enough batter for 30 muffins.

This recipe is great. My husband ate 4 of them straight out of the oven. I took the advice of other reviewers and only used 1 cup of oil instead of 1 1/2 cups. These came out great. I ended up with 34 regular size muffins. I will be making these again especially in the fall.

Outstanding muffins.  I added 1.5 cups unsweetened applesauce and cut the oil down to 1/4 cup.  The muffins were super moist and so delicious.  I also put in half the amount of chips and used mini ones.  You have to try these.

I used the other members suggestion of using only 1 cup of oil and the muffins turn out perfect every time! All 5 of my kids love these muffins! All of their friends love them too! They're even great without the chocolate chips! One batch doesn't even last 24 hours in our house!

Received compliments, but seemed a bit greasy to me.  Maybe reduce the oil and add applesauce or more pumpkin?  Think I will next time I try this.

WOW.  I made this last night for our Thanksgiving party and it came out amazing.  The muffins are so fluffly and delicious.  I doubled the recipe and made some cakes also (they took a lot longer to bake and I recommed sticking to the muffins).  Everyone who tried them LOVED them.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I used applesauce instead of oil and 1 cup of chocolate chips. I still thought the chocolate overpowered the pumpkin flavor. Still good though, and best when eaten warm.

I also made some changes to this recipe. I used splenda and brown sugar instead of the white sugar and no one could tell the difference. I also double the amount of spices suggested and used pumpkin pie spice in thier place. These are absolutely delicious right out of the oven. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because the next day the seem to loss something and taste a little grainy.

My whole family loved these muffins!  The only thing I would change is the amount of chocolate chips.  I would cut them down to half.

Good Muffins.  Family enjoyed these. A good alternative to pie to incorporate pumpkin into your diet. Will make again for sure.

These are tasty treats for fall afternoons!  I forgot to read the other reviews before baking though and wish I had cut down the sugar and oil as others suggested.  With those adjustments in my next batch, these will be perfect.

These are spectacular muffins! I made one batch for my son's preschool class, and made another the next day for my husband! I substituted 1 c. of tofu blended with the liquid ingredients for the eggs, and I substituted 1/4 c. of applesauce for 1/4 c. of the oil to cut the fat a bit. They were so moist and cake-like! I will definately be making these often!

Very good recipe!  I will be making these again.  The chocolate chips make a nice taste surprise... I used 1 1/2 cups chips and 1/2 cup raisins.  I didn't have applesauce so used all oil, but will be trying cinnamon applesauce next time I make them.  I took some over to the neighbors and they loved them as well.

These are wonderfully tasty!  I made them as mini-muffins and the recipe made about 100.  I used half oil and half applesauce, and they turned out well.

This is a great recipe.  Divided all ingredients in half to make 12 muffins.  I also reduced the vegetable oil with good results.  Absolutely a big hit in my house.  My husband, who hates muffins, ate these up.  Yummy!

The scent of these baking in the oven was so wonderful!  My dad loved these - the cinnamon and pumpkin taste is the key to this great recipe.  It's an innovative way to use pumpkin puree.  However, it's a little high in unhealthy fat... I may substitute apple sauce in place of oil next time.

I made these as a Halloween surprise for my coworkers. I made them into mini muffins not realizing that the yield was already so high, so I ended up with about 70 mini muffins. They were very good and people had good things to say about them, however the one criticism I got over and over again was that they weren’t very pumpkiny. The taste of the cinnamon dominated most of the pumpkin flavor. Therefore if you are making this recipe to be very strong pumpkin, it’s not the one for you, but if you would like it to be mild then it’s a good choice. I also reduced the amount of oil like others said and it proved to be a good call.

Substituted one cup almond flour for one c AP flour, 3/4c sugar, 1c coconut sugar, 1/2c oil, 1/4c applesauce, 1/4c coconut oil, added 1 tsp vanilla, and 2 tsp cinnamon. So good! And don’t feel so guilty eating for breakfast

These have become my most requested muffin!  My husband does not like pumpkin, but he eats these two at a time.  :)  Very flavorful, very moist.  I tried using less oil to make it a bit healthier, but that made them too dry.  Make them as is!

Loved these. As suggested, I lowered the amount of oil to 3/4 c. I will try applesauce next time, include nutmeg or pumpkin spice, and add raw sugar on top. I also added 1 T of Vanilla, added 1/2 t more of cinnamon, and substituted 2 c of the white flour with whole wheat pastry flour. They were delicious, moist, and devoured by my husband and 3 year old daughter..

My family loves these! It makes almost 3 dozen so I freeze half and pull out a couple the night before school. I only add one cup of chocolate chips and one cup of oil, and a little more cinnamon than calls for.

I made only a half batch the first time, not knowing how my kids would like it. They absolutely loved these muffins and ask for them every day. Definitely making a full batch next time. I made only two minor changes, reducing the amount of oil slightly and using pumpkin that I had previously cooked and mashed rather than canned. I followed everything else exactly and they turned out great!

I liked how moist they were, but they lacked flavor. The chocolate chips helped brighten it though. Next time I’ll add more cinnamon as well as some nutmeg. These are the alterations I made: substituted 3/4 C. mayonnaise for the eggs, 1 1/2 C. sugar, about 3/4 C. oil, 2 1/2 tsp. baking powder, and 1 C. chocolate chips ( putting most into the batter and saving some to press on the tops).

Yum!!! These are a huge hot with my children.  The only change I have made so far is too so a bit of nutmeg, and they've come out perfectly both as regular muffins and as minis.  I also used sightly more pumpkin as I like to use fresh and the little sugar pie pumpkins tend to give me about 2 cups.  I'm going to play around with mix-ins and frostings.  The muffins were great as is, but we're a tad ticket with cream cheese frosting.

These would be giant muffins if you divide this batter into 12 muffins.  The batter easily makes 24.  I use some coconut oil and applesauce instead of the oil and agree with others that 24 oz of chocolate chips overwhelms the pumpkin taste.

First of all I did read prior reviews so I don't get all the credit. I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup butter. I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. They came out perfectly with rave reviews from family and friends

These were delicious! I did half whole wheat flour and added pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinnamon. I also added 1/4 cup 7 grain cereal and a few teaspoons of molasses! Moist and delicious, fantastic!!

I must admit to changing this recipe but the essence of it is really good...I used half oil and half vanilla yogurt; half white and half brown sugar.  The texture was great as was the flavor!!  I also used pumpkin pie spice because I rarely use it didn't want it to go to waste.  Delicious!

Best pumpkin muffin recipe I have found so far! 
Changes:
1- 1/3 cup natural sugar because I did not have brown sugar to do half the required amount at the time
dash of nutmeg and ginger added (because it is pumpkin)
1/2 stick of butter instead of oil. (because no applesauce on hand)
1 cup butterscotch chips and 1 cup choc chips.  Added a different flavor 
My husband is not a fan of ginger nor pumpkin and he scarfed these down! So GOOD!

These are delicious muffins!  Make sure you note that this recipe will make 2 dozen, so you may want to cut it in half if you're not feeding a ton of people.  Also,  I used mini chocolate chips and LOVED it!  There was a lot more chocolate throughout the muffins, and they weren't hard chips after baking.

I followed many other commenters' advice and replaced some of the oil with applesauce. I think if I had used more applesauce instead of oil per Lisa's suggestion, it would have been even better, but the muffins were great anyway. Also added pumpkin pie spice and used cinnamon sugar instead of ground cinnamon. Again, good, but even more would have been even better. HOWEVER I wanted to be sure to comment just in case anyone else had the same problem I did. This is a lot of batter. 12 cup muffin tin at the prescribed temp and time? Lovely. THEN being inexperienced and naive, I plopped the rest in a loaf pan and baked at the same time and temp. Surprise novice bakers, bread takes a whole lot longer to bake and it got crispy on the outside while underbaked on the inside. So next time I would pay more attention to Great British Bake Off and remember to 1. lower the temp 2. set the timer for longer so I don't keep opening the over every ten minutes wondering what's happening 3. cover with foil so the top doesn't get too brown. Also probably would have been better if I wasn't baking it alongside other things (i.e. the muffins and then some cornbread). All this to say, great recipe with the suggested modifications, don't be like me and try to cheat/multitask without knowing what you're doing. hehe

Delicious!!!! I read up on the reviews and used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. They are so tasty and moist and I will definitely make them again!!! I didn't have two muffin pans and in my impatience , put the 2nd half of the muffin batter in a bread pan! Turns out this recipe makes a nice choco-chip pumpkin loaf as well!

I loved this recipe but cut the oil in half. I added 3/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup water. Turned out delicious...would also add more cinnamon and a little more allspice. It made about 26 big muffins.

Delicious!  I used the 1/2 cup oil & 1/2 cup applesauce modification.  I used corn oil b/c I was out of veggie oil.  I used 1 tsp each of pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg & ground cinnamon.  I cooked at recommended reciew time of 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  Came out fluffy & tasty & clean.  Will make again!  Thanks for the recipe & recommendations!

This is the perfect pumpkin muffin recipe!  Still delicious with some healthier swap-outs (switched out 1 cup of white flour for wheat, 1 cup of the oil with apple sauce; also did half brown sugar). I often find that pumpkin muffins are so moist that they're almost gummy, but these are the ideal texture.  And I love that it uses 1 can of pumpkin - who wants to save a partial can of packed pumpkin?  Easy and yummy.

Yummy muffins.  I had leftover fresh pumpkin in my freezer and needed something to use it for. Made these muffins and they were great!  The amount of batter made not only the 24 standard sized muffins, but an additional 6 large muffins.  Watch your oven carefully the last couple minutes so they don't burn.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! The only thing I would maybe change next time is to do as others have suggested and cut down on the oil by substituting apple-sauce or mashed bananas. I also used mini-chocolate chips, and these turned out to be a wonderful treat!

I halved the oil and didn't put as many chocolate chips as the recipe called for, but these muffins are SO DELICIOUS. I also subbed the flour with gluten-free flour (Cup 4 Cup) and had no issues. These are a staple in our house.

I converted this recipe to GF. Mine came out very moist and with an excellent taste and texture. No sandiness. My husband does not think it tastes GF. I also did come out with 24 cupcakes and they rose nicely. I also only used 1 c pumpkin. 

My conversion: Instead of 3c flour:
1C almond flour
1C coconut flour
1c sorghum flour 
approximately1.5t xanthan gum
**I also only used 1c of the pumpkin.

I love this recipe!  Because we grew lots of winter squash,
I did change the recipe by using winter squash instead of pumpkin.  I changed the 1 1/2 cups oil to 1/2 c. coconut oil & 1 c. applesauce.  I also added 1/2 t.allspice.  My grandchildren love them!  They think they are cupcakes.

The muffins are great with the improvements mentioned: 1/2 c applesauce, 1/2 c oil, 1 c brown sugar, 1/2 c white sugar, 20 oz total canned pumpkin AND I accidentally bought a can of pumpkin pie MIX and the muffins are amazingly moist and flavorful. Wonderful recipe!!! Best I've ever had!

I loved it! It made a bit more than I thought, so I ended up having 24 cupcakes and a small pumpkin chocolate chip loaf. They are amazing!

Awesome recipe! We're only two people so I halved it and did a lot of tweaking.  I did a split of oat flour, whole wheat and white and the consistency was amazing.  Used smart balance margarine instead of oil. Put a mix of chopped almonds and chocolate chips and skipped the pumpkin because didn't have any on hand.  400 for 15 minutes was perfect, the muffins came out nice and soft.  Will definitely be making this again!

I rate these a solid 5 with added changes recommended by previous bakers. Instead of 15oz. pumpkin, I used about 2 cups. Rather than 1.5 c. oil, I used 1/2 cup. I also added 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, 1 tsp. roasted cinnamon and approx. 1/4 tsp. ground cloves. I might double the spices next time! Yummy, moist muffins! I recommend mini semi-sweet chocolate chips or even cinnamon chips!

The recipe as written has too much oil. I cut it down to 1 cup. I also cut down the sugar to about 1 and 3/4 cups because I used milk chocolate chips. I used 1.5 cups instead of 2 of the chocolate chips. Along with the cinnamon called for I added cloves and nutmeg. With these changes the muffins were delicious!

I followed others advice and halved the oil and replaced with applesauce. It was great, but I don't think it would have been with all the oil.

I halved this recipe. I think it needs more pumpkin flavor so I will add pumpkin spice next time for sure. Delicious none the less. Substituted the sugar/oil for honey and applesauce. Perfectly Moist!!

This was very easy to make. Nice and moist inside, but it was a bit plain for me and my family. Turns out we don't care for chocolate in our pumpkin muffins.

Very Yummy.  Instead of 1.5 C oil, I used 1 C oil and 1/3 C extra pumpkin.  I also added more cinnamon and some pumpkin pie spice.  Used mini chocolate chips and cinnamon chips, all totaling about 1/2 cup, and that was plenty.  My kids love these.

great easy recipe but I made some changes- used 1 cup oil (would've used 1/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce but didn't have), increased to 1 & 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon allspice/cloves,  used half regular sugar, half brown sugar and substituted white choc chips for semi-sweet. they're delicious!! would def make again!

Loved them! I  cut the recipe in half and then cut the oil down to 1/2 cup as some others recommended. I also added some ground flaxseed, maybe 2 TBL, just because. I used mini chips. These muffins were  perfect to me in texture and taste. Delicious!

Made these muffins last night with my 3 year old. Was simple and delicious. I made exactly as written, however I only had 1 3/4 C. of chocolate chips. This is a good recipe for the family because the taste is light but good. My kids are picky and liked that it wasn't pumpkin spice.

These muffins are SO TASTY! I love them. When I make them I can't keep my hands off of them. My daughter loves them too. There are only two in our household and I only splurge occasionally so the recipe is way to big for the two of us. If you have a small household it would be wise to change the serving size or if you have a big household or are making this for pot luck you will be good to go. I make them in the mini muffin cups and they come out so nice.

Per other reviews, I decreased the oil to 1 cup, and the muffins were perfect.  I added a tsp of Nutmeg also.  They turned out very moist with a great texture.  I'll definitely be making these again.

These were really good! I baked them too long, so they were a little tough. For some reason, I also felt the need to cut down on sugar and white chocolate chips. I shouldn't have. I cut down on the oil too, and that was a good idea. I'll make them again the right way, and expect deliciousness.

These are super!  I made it using Jules' Gluten Free Flour, and substituted 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon--they were delicious!! Beauty of this recipe, is it is so dang easy to make, and bakes up in nearly no time at all.  I highly recommend it.

These muffins were wonderful!  The kids couldn't get enough of them, and my darling husband--though he does not enjoy pumpkin goodies--ate nearly half of the lot.  Great recipe!

DIVINE!! These are my favorite muffins EVER. I substituted carob chips for chocolate chips. They did take more than 20 minutes to bake though.

These are very tasty.  To make a little more nutritious and a little higher fiber I used 1 cup whole wheat and only 1 3/4 cup white flour.  I also used 3 peeled apples and microwaved them with 2 tablespoons water, then mashed them up for equivalent to 1 cup, and then used only 1/2 cup oil.  Also cut down to 1 3/4 cup sugar.

These are great!  I did as others suggested and only put 1/2 cup of veg. oil and then 3/4 cup applesauce (even though I think next time I will try to put a whole cup of applesauce.) I also didn't put as much sugar in them since the applesauce I had was sweetened.

I made this muffins for Halloween. I first forgot the eggs and was in panic, that they not will be good. than i made it again with eggs, while the other one baked in the oven. both, with and without eggs, were very, very good. and i'm happy to made so much, so i was eating this muffins the whole week. 
i decrease sugar and oil but it was still juicy and not to dry.

Wonderful, easy muffins!  I chose this recipe because the ingredients are basically the same, though different proportions, as my favorite cookie (see Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Cookies III) - The cookies never last long enough!!  I made the muffins exactly as directed - they did LOOK oily while stirring up, BUT baked up perfectly, moist, and fabulous.... I did 12 normal sized muffins, and 24 minis, out of one batch, literally filling muffin cups to the top of all.. I WILL be making this, repeatedly, with no changes!!!  Thanks Allrecipes peeps!! :)

I changed a few things (used a 796ml can of pumpkin  because that's all I could find, it was about 3 cups so I topped it up to 4 cups with oil. added 1 tbsp of vanilla and used only 1 cup of chocolate chips). Pretty good! I might try adding more cinnamon or adding nutmeg next time.

I made these yesterday and substituted applesauce for the oil and used just 1 1/2 C sugar. This knocked off 100 calories.  My husband said these were the best pumpkin muffins and possibly the best muffins he ever had. I agree! (I could have saved more calories by using raisins instead of chocolate chips, but where's the fun in that?) Thanks for the recipe!

I just love these muffins! So simple to make and oh so yummy! They're the best warm out of the oven, but they're great after they've cooled too. :) I do what several other reviewer's have done which is leave out 1/2 cup of the oil and also I leave out 1/2 cup of the sugar and I only use 1 cup of chocolate chips. I think 1 cup is definitely p-lenty! :) These are so delish, if I could rate them above 5 stars, I would!!

This was a delicious and quick recipe to make. I only used 3/4 cup of oil, and added 1/4 cup of liquid chai mix and 1/2 teaspoon of cloves. I also used half semisweet chocolate chips and half milk chocolate...I will definitely be making them again.

Excellent muffins!  I too added only 1 cup of oil after reading other reviews (trying to lighten them up a little bit!).  I also substituted brown sugar for about 1/2 c of the white sugar, just for my personal taste, and I thought they were PERFECT!  My entire French class devoured them, and even my boyfriend who doesn't like pumpkin!

Awesome muffins, even my kids loved it! The only changes I did was I used 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder and 1/2 c. of oil and 1/2 c. applesauce (unsweetened)also, I cut back on the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. It still came out good.:)

Very tasty. I replaced the 1-1/2 cups of vegetable oil with 1 cup of applesauce and 1/2 vegetable oil.  I also used mini chocolate chips (only because I didn't have the regular size.)  I gave some of the muffins to my neighbor.  She later called to ask for the recipe! FYI: I also found this recipe in my May/June 1995 issue of Country Woman. It won Grand prize in their muffin contest. I rated it 4 stars because of the large amount of oil orginally called for.

Very pleased with these muffins!  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon, I would probably increase the amount next time for a little more flavor.  Also used mini chocolate chips.

I also cut out the extra 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup of sugar.  My husband thinks they taste even better and aren't as heavy.  My students love them as a breakfast treat... and I've also made the extra batter using a bread pan, just have to cook about 20 minutes longer depending on how much is left.

These were a different take on my usual pumpkin bread. They were a little dry for my taste, but not bad. I displayed these on a cake plate with a paper towel underneath, and they left a very large, unsightly greasy pumpkin colored stain. Not very appetizing - I've NEVER had muffins or bread for that matter do this. I will not make these again. Much better recipes out there.

Great recipe! I decreased the amount of oil to 1 cup and I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups white flour. The kids are begging me for more!

Used 1/2 white, 1/2 wheat flour with 1 1/4 cups applesauce and 1/4 cup oil. Everyone loved these. Very moist, delicious, and tasty!  Made 24 full size muffins and 24 minis.

These were outstanding!  It made exactly 24 muffins (jumbo).  My family loved them.  I also brought some in for my co-workers and they requested more.  To top them off I used Cream Cheese frosting ontop.  Alse,   I did as others suggested and cut the oil down to 1 Cup.  Love this recipe.

Great recipe.  Followed others about the oil (1 cup).  Added more pumpkin and a little nutmeg.  Made them for a school snack.  They were a big hit.

These were absolutely amazing. Every single person who tried them loved them. I added a thick cream cheese cinnamon frosting to them. The entire batch always gets eaten immediately.

Everyone loves these when I make them.  The key is to use 1/2 oil and 1/2 cinnimon applesauce.  Then you can use less sugar (1 1/2 cups is plenty).  This makes them more moist and much more healthy!

I will be making these as part of an assorted goodie plate for the holidays!!
I agree with some previous comments, and made the following changes: I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I used 1/2 cup oat bran, 1 cup whole wheat flour and reduced the white flour to 1 1/2 cups. I reduced the sugar to about 1 1/2 cups. I only added 1/4 cup oil and since I didn't have applesauce used 1 cup lo-fat sour cream. Making these healthy changes still creates a yummy muffun!!

Changed the recipe just slightly.  Used only 3 tbs of honey to cut down on the sugar content.  Loved the texture and the taste.  It's like eating pumpkin pie in a muffin shape.

Very versatile recipe.  I used only 1/2 c. of oil and increased the pumpkin to 21oz. I also subsitiuted 1/2 c. of the flour for whole wheat flour. Kids loved it.

These were so good!  Great big, fluffy, muffins with a great taste.  I used white chocolate chips instead of regular.  Will definitely make again.

One word... delish!  I loved these muffins and my batch made so many I had plenty to share with others and they each gave rave reviews.  These muffins were incredibly moist and perfect for a fall snack.  I took the advice of others and cut back on the oil and added applesauce in place of it.  Yum!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  I can't wait to make these again!

Very moist and yummy!  Here are the changes I made:  used 1 1/2 cups of applesauce in place of the oil, used 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 2 cups, added some cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger (pumpkin pie spice would have been ideal if I had some) and used just over a cup of chocolate chips instead of 2 cups, though 2 cups wouldn't have hurt.  :)  Nice recipe!

This recipe is the best pumpkin muffin recipe I have used. My kids won't eat any other. I scaled it down to 12 muffins and added a few extra spices like nutmeg and cloves, you can play with the spices. I have been using is since 2002 and it hasn't failed me yet.....

I made these and they are good.  However, I guess I was expecting something super wonderful.  They taste like a mild pumpkin muffin with chocolate chips.  They are good and the recipe does make a lot.  Like I said, they are good, but I think I was expecting much more.
