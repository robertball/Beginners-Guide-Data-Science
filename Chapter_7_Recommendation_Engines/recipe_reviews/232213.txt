Soo perfect!  I love them.  I added a shake of Italian Seasoning as well and used hotdog buns because I had no bread.  Very easy.  Will not be buying croutons ever again!

Perfect. I actually used six slices of bread because I removed the crust. These were so good, I could have ate them alone as a snack! No need to buy packaged croutons anymore. These were easy and taste better!!

These are great.  In order to make them a bit healthier, I used soft margarine and added 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder instead of 1/4 tsp.   I added more because the seasoning didn't seem to get absorbed as well with the margarine as with the melted butter.    I used french bread and it worked well.  Thanks for a terrific recipe.

I serve these croutons with Chef John's pea soup. They are a hit every time. This time I used leftover Italian bread. Delicious.

These are everything the reviews said they are, fantastic. I usually do not tweek someone's recipe but I had some English  muffins, onion buns, and bread that needed something done to so I cup them all up and followed the recipe. My birds will no longer be getting my old bread products.

Excellent recipe & wished could give it 10 stars!  Made it last night with leftover Italian loaf some white & some wheat.  Followed the recipe exactly with additional 5 more minutes of baking time, as I like more crispier croutons.  As one reviewer said, I'll never buy the packaged ones ever.

These were so tasty.  I did cook them five minutes longer as I like my croutons crispy and a little on the well done side.  THis recipe is a keeper that I will make over and over again.  I even made them for a snack and they totally satisfied that crunchy salty craving.  All thumbs up!

The easiest way to make croutons and there's always something special about making your own. Very tasty too!

I didnâ€™t use any seasoning -just butter.  Nothing like home made croutons.  The best!

I agree with others, easy and had a hard time not finishing them off plain with no salad.  I did have to bake mine longer to crisp them more but they were awesome!
