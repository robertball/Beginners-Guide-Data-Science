I think there is an error in the first ingredient of this recipe.  Chinese Sweet Rice is always made with a short-grain rice called glutinous rice (aka sweet rice or sticky rice).  Jasmine rice is a long-grain rice and will not yield the sticky consistency.  The two types of rice are not interchangeable in recipes.

In reference to the first review:
It is your assumption that the author is referring to "sticky rice". However, the phrase "sweet rice" is also applied to Jasmine rice because it is named after the sweet-smelling jasmine flower of Southeast Asia. Jasmine rice has a naturally distinctive scent released during the cooking process and is likened to a flowery perfume.

In addition, the ingredients in this recipe go perfectly with a rice grain such as Jasmine rice that can separate without difficulty. It makes it easier to combine the ingredients in this dish in such a way that each bite can blend the various flavors.

Don't forget: Wok at least three times a week for a healthy heart!

i think this is probably more of a fried rice. the sweet rice version you're thinking of, the ingredients are steamed with the rice.
