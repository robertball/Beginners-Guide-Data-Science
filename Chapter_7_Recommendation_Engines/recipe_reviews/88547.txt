At first, I was very skeptical about this recipe.  How messy would it be?  Would the popcorn burn with the extra microwave time? But, I was craving that salt/sweet thing . . . so I thought I'd give it a try.  No mess, no burn and DELICIOUS!!!!  Will make over and over again.  Thanks for the GREAT idea!

We raided the Halloween stash and only had Baby Ruth candy bars left. They worked great. The kids loved this. 
Don't bother with the mini peanut butter cups. They never seemed to melt enough without the popcorn getting too chewy. 
I think Three Musketeers would work really well with its soft marshmallow center.

Yum!  Wish I had more than what this made! I think if you chill the candy bar first, then use a grater, you might be able to more evenly distribute the candy over the popcorn.

My sister LOVED this popcorn. I was very skeptical of it but thuoght I would give it a try.
 I only had fun size candy bars leftover from halloween so I used milky ways and added some marshmallows, peanuts and peanut butter. 
 I'm not a sweet tooth so this was my sister's kinda thing.

I have been making this for over 20 yrs. Our local skating rink used to sell this and they called it Mary Anns. Not sure why but love this stuff.

It didn't melt all together well at all. It didn't even taste that good. Not sure what all the rave is about.

This is the perfect combination of sweet & salty. I use the microwave popcorn that comes in a bucket because it's easier to work with. I also use 5-6 fun size snickers and cut them into at least eight small pieces. I add them to the bucket of popcorn immediately after it comes out and use a fork or knife to move the mixture as I add the candy. This helps to break up the clusters. I only microwave it again until I see some of the caramel melting. Again, I would use my knife to mix it up in the bucket and to get the chocolate spread around. You can microwave it longer, but I read some reviews that stated that the popcorn gets chewy after a while. I don't care to melt every little piece, because I don't mind a tiny bite of a candy bar. It's all going in your mouth by the handful anyways.

After reading reviews, I tried melting the candy bar and mixing in.  Did not work well.  Ended up with small chunks  of candy mixed in with popcorn, not coated on popcorn.   I think ultimately resulted  the same way as cutting into small pieces.  It tastes good but messy and would prefer popcorn to be coated and that isn't going to happen with that type of candy bar.

I just made this and it is delicious.  Exactly what I was looking for as I was craving that salty/sweet thing.  I don't know what happened with the person who only gave this one star, but I love this!  So simple, so easy.  Thank you!
