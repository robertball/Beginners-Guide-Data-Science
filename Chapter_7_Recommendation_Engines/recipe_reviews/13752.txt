I have been making these rolls for years, this recipe is almost identical to the one I use except instead of ginger I use pumpkin pie spice. For the filling I only use 2 tablespoons of butter instead of 4.  I end up making almost 10 rolls a year and this year was the easiest because I just started using Parchment Paper.  I bake it on the parchment then take it out of the oven and roll it up warm right in the parchment paper. Another thing I found to make the cake spongy and easier to roll is to beat the eggs until they form peaks, then add the sugar gradually and beat the sugar and eggs for about 5 minutes before folding in the pumpkin (Libby's 100% Pure pumpkin in a can).

I got this recipe from the Southern Living Cookbook and it's fabulous! The only difference is that you add 1 cup of finely chopped walnuts or pecans sprinkled over the batter before putting the pan in the oven. Also, in the cream cheese filling, I throw in a dash of rum for the yum rum in the tum...oooo:) Hint: you must roll the cake while still hot and moist and must let cool completely before unrolling to keep from breaking. I make this at holidays a week in advance and freeze and pull out the day of. And in a pinch, you can cheat with with cream cheese frosting out of a can, but don't tell anyone! he, he

I've made this roll twice.The second time I added 1t of pumpkin pie spice in addition to the other spices.I wanted to enhance the pumpkin flavor. To make it more attractive at serving time, I frosted it with a little filling I have saved, to which I added 3T of apricot preserves. You could also use peach preserves or orange marmalade for a great flavor combination.My friends enjoyed the more enhanced version, the the original version is delicious, too. Thanks, Diane.

Wow! I just cannot say enough good things about this recipe! I don't know if I would call this easy...I don't think any rolls ever are...but it was SIMPLE. And the finished product is just soooo impressive. The cake was easy to roll with no cracks (always my big problem when making a roll cake), and the filling/icing is just SUBLIME! It's a wonder any of it got on the cakes! Thank you!

I made this recipe following the directions exactly and it came out great the first time.  After that, I used the advice of the other reviews and used wax paper instead of a towel, and I don't use all of the icing just to keep it from oosing.  It came out even better, and my friends are all still asking for the recipe!! Thanks

This pumpkin roll was delicious.  I have never made one before and I am not much of a cook, but this turned out wonderful!  I did not have to use a towel.  I just rolled mine up in wax paper and it held its shape perfectly!

The house smelled wonderful as I baked this, but the pumpkin and spice flavor was not strong enough for such a rich cream.

I can't believe I never reviewed this! This is AWESOME!!!! The best pumpkin roll recipe I've tried. Once I was very low on sugar, so I subbed 1/2 brown sugar, and it is very good like that, too! When rolling, I always dust a piece of waxed paper with a little powderd sugar, then roll the cake and let it cool. The cream cheese filling is perfect! YUM!

This was really tasty, but hard to unroll from the cotton dish towel. It was pretty sticky. I will make this again because I could have messed it up. So my advice to someone wanting to try this just watch the portion of the instruction. The frosting is really really yummy and really makes the whole dessert. My husband thinks this filling with ANY roll cake would rock! Thanks for summiting this recipe.

As a novice the unrolling was tricky. I used parchment paper once it came out of the oven. It worked very well.
I can't believe how quickly it disappeared from the tabel...I will definitely me making this many, many times to come.

Very good.  I brought this to school for the staff, and I had to go and print out the recipe three times.  For a staff of 10 people, I'd say that was a success.

This pumpkin roll is delicious and easy to make.  I have made it about 10 times already and no one has complained.  I always sprinkle chopped walnuts or almonds to mixture.

I made this recipe twice today, and neither turned out.  The first one turned into a cracked mess when I went to roll it up in the towel.  I thought maybe I overcooked it, or had waited to long to roll it.  I tried it again, followed the recipe exactly, and this time the thing fell apart when I went to take it out of the pan.  The flavor of the pieces was fine, but it was a mess.  I ended up cookie-cutting little circles and filling them with the frosting, kind of like little whoopie pies.  Although i'm sure this would end up tasting great, I will not be making this recipe again.

Excellent!!! A wonderful dessert to make ahead for the freezer. I used half brown sugar and half white instead of all white just for something different. Took it to a potluck and received LOTS of great comments.

This was so delicious! I was in an adventurous mood and decided to try this and it actually wasn't too difficult. However, when i was rolling it, it did crack. But that didn't matter in the end really.

This was my first attempt at a pumpkin roll... a success! The recipe was really easy and the cake didn't crack! I didn't have ginger, so I added 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice in addition to the other spices. Also, mine only took about 10 minutes to cook... maybe it's my oven, or maybe my pan... anyway, check the cake early just in case. Oh, and I used plastic, sprinkled with powdered sugar to roll the cake in, instead of the towel. It worked great. I will make this again and again. Yummy!

This recipe was very tasty, a hit at thanksgiving dinner but I found a regular sized cookie sheet did fine and I am going to use parchment paper next time to cool it.  The towel made it a bit too gooey.

This recipe was great!  I cut the cake in half and made two rolls.  It was a little easier to handle.  The combination of spices made a great pumpkin roll.

Very moist, and liked it very much. Although I thought it a little to spicy and did not like the o.j. in it. Next time less spice and no orange juice.

I have used this recipe for years--I got it from my aunt.  It's wonderful for those allergic to peanut butter, it's a standard for fall in our house.

I gave 4 instead of 5 stars, because I like a strong pumpkin and spice flavor, so I had to use more than the recipe called for (1 cup pumkin, 2.5 tsp. cinnamon, and a heaping tsp. of ginger) to keep the cream cheese mixture from overwhelming the roll, but it was excellent this way.

I love this recipe!  I have used this recipe or a variation of it for years.  I used to use Foil in replace of the wax paper but the foil always seemed to stick.  I'm young and don't have a use for a Jelly roll pan, though I'm thinking it may come into great use as I learn to cook more recipes, anything is possible!  I saw your suggestion of greasing the wax paper.. It made the clean up so much faster!  Thank you for this neat trick and God Bless!

I have never made a pumpkin roll before, and I was highly successful. The filling is AWESOME! The only thing different I did was sprinkle powdered sugar on the cake before I put the cream cheese on and after I rolled it up.  Make sure you roll it in the towel while it is still quite warm. Mine did not crack! Thanks for the great recipe!

I have made these for years.  It was my mom's recipe.  Something that I like to do to mine at Christmas time is sift powdered sugar on the 1/2 towel before I roll it up.  I use a pretty god layer of sugar so the steam from the hot cake won't "melt" the sugar.  It gives it a "snowy" look

Delicious, everyone is still raving about it! I baked it on parchment paper on a cookie sheet and just rolled it up with the parchment paper. I was shocked it didn't fall apart and it didn't stick! I filled it with a buttercream icing (I was out of cream cheese). It tastes great at room temperature and ten times better when it's cold. Beautiful dessert!

I followed the recipe , however, I was not sure of my pan size so I double the recipe because the pan was very large....I got the cake to thick.... the roll needs to be very thin, so that when you fold it has a nice layered swirl look. I recommend to add more spices as it was not enough( I would double).  If you add nuts; add to the top of the roll, so that you can see them on top of the cake...  I made extra mini cakes with the left overs... for tasting and it is very yummy.  Also, as recommend in the comments. Beat the eggs at least 5-6 minutes prior to adding the pumpkin- it worked perfect.

It was good, but not the best.  It was weak in the spice department.  I would recommend using pumpkin spice instead of the ginger.

This was a hit at our Thanksgiving dinner.  I had some difficulty spreading the batter onto my parchment paper-covered pan.  It took me a while to get it even.  I used non-stick foil to roll the cake.  I also added pecans to my frosting.  Delicious!

Cold cake with sugary frosting inside.  My boyfriend and my family and I didn't really like it, but I'm sure young kids would.

I find it helpful to put the flat cake into the freezer for about two hours (making sure that you have peeled it away from the pan or if you are using waxed paper, make sure it doesn't stick) before rolling. It makes it easier to work with and also allows for the filling to not melt!
