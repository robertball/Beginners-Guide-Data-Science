Love this recipe!  I'm following the Blood type diet and all potatoes are an 'avoid' for me.  I had three parsnips, but used almond-milk (unsweetened) rather than whole milk, and enough to cover the 'snips.  Cooking time was about 20 minutes, so keep an eye on the pot if adjusting from original numbers.  The almond milk gave a little nutty flavor in addition to the 'snips, but the thyme was a nice enhancement in the mouth.

OK so I tried this because my mom is on a no salt, low carb diet. She is not down with mashed cauliflower as a sub for mashed potatoes. I used almond milk (per previous reviewer) to cover and cook the parsnips. Since we use no salt, I added the dried thyme and a little no-salt butter during the cooking step. I cooked with a cover until tender and removed the pot cover to reduce the almond milk down to zero. It did not take 25-30 minutes. I added the remaining butter and a bit of half and half as I used a manual potato masher. It was a hit!

Let me say I LOVE parsnips!  I had 4 Large Parsnips - I used just enough milk to barely cover them.  Be very careful cooking these in the milk (BTW - I think 5 cups would have been way too much milk)  even by greatly reducing the amount of milk, using a large sauce pan and cooking on Low, the milk still simmered over, making a mess of both the pan and the stove.  The milk separated, as if when scolded.  The taste was fine but the appearance wasn't great.  They mashed up fine, tasted good (I didn't use thyme - we have a thyme hater in the house)  butter, salt and pepper and some of the reserved milk.  I still ended up tossing out quite a bit of milk.   5 stars for overall taste, 3 stars for method and mess.  (Simmering milk with the lid on will boil over - if you are going to cook in the milk simmer without the pan covered and keep an eye on them!)

Super easy and delicious! Used cream instead of milk. Added 1/2 tsp nutmeg & 1 tsp garlic powder...OMG! I use this recipe when I make braised beef short ribs/beef cheeks. Accompanied with Brussel sprouts or wilted spinach. Yummm!!

I peeled and chopped the parsnips, and placed them in a sauce pan over medium-low heat. I salted them and added about 90% unsweetened almond milk and about 10% half and half, just enough to cover the parsnips. Covered and let them simmer for around 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. After they were fork-tender, I strained them over a bowl and placed them into a food processor. I added a generous pat of butter, thyme, and salt and pepper to taste. Then I blitzed the parsnips and added some of the milk until it became a lovely, creamy purée. 10/10 will make again. It was very easy and tasted like it came from a 5 star french restaurant. Paired it with ribeyes and lemon sage asparagus

Loved parsnips before this recipe and even more now.  Did not measure anything - just cooked the cubed parsnips in milk at low temp and hand mashed with thyme and butter.  They came out great.   This will be a common dish on our plates.

First of all , I didn't know if it was parsnips I was buying until I got to the counter and the cashier asked the bagger what they were and she said parsnips. With that being said I made them exactly how the recipe said. They did have the consistency of potatoes, but they were sweet like carrots. I will boil them in water next time and will grow them I  my garden. I did like the taste of them

Yum. So good. I didn't watch is close enough and the milk boiled and curdeled. I put it in the blender and it turned out perfect.

Loved it! I used almond milk. Nice to have a healthier alternative to mashed potatoes.

Made it per the recipe. I didn’t tell my husband what it as he ate it. After it was gone, I asked him if he liked it. He asked me what was in it beside potatoes.  He was surprised when I told him there were no potatoes. It had a slightly sweet taste. Easy to make and delicious. Will absolutely make again.

I followed the recipe exactly as written cutting it in half. I thought it was very good. This was my first time trying parsnips. My family did not like this at all but it is not the recipe. They do not care for parsnips.
