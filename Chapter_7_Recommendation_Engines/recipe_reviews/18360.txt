Here's a huge hint with this recipe.  The Dutch don't really use a pie plate for this style of pie.  They use a springform pan.  You just simply pat the dough into the  greased and floured pan and then add your apples.  It's quick and delicious.  You might have to place a piece of aluminum foil on the top to keep it from burning.

I halved this recipe in order to make a single 9" pie.  Either the measurements given were wrong or the dough is meant to be very wet.  It was difficult to work with and was very greasy.  I will not make this recipe again.

I've made this recipe many times either in a 9" x 9" dish or as individual tarts and it has always turned out great.

This turned out SO good!  Our homeschool group participates each year in an 'International Festival' and this year my family chose Holland.  I searched and searched for recipes, and found this one, and boy am I glad I did. Ive had multiple requests for the recipe from the moms in my group. I had no problem whatsoever with the dough, and it turned out perfectly...ONE SUGGESTION...you definitely DO NOT need that many apples.  I would suggest for One recipe, to use 4-5 large apples. 8 just will not fit!  Raisins added are a plus, also!

This pie just did not turn out!
The dough was a wet mess, and I probably needed a deep dish pie pan which was not stated in the recipe.  The sugar topping did not leave the crunch I was expecting.

it sure was quick and easy as promised, and it tasted good enough. but I must have got something wrong: I could not possibly find enough room in the small quantity of pastry for so many "large apples" as directed so I put only six, and not large at all...so I had a very little apple pie, more similar to an apple crumb than I expected.

I made it twice, and the bottom crust always got very wet and soggy.  I won't make it anymore.

This can be so EASY and Elegant!   I agree with KK's comment on Jan. 10, 2011, it really should be made in a spring-form pan (or a deep, round casserole?).  The dough should be sticky --  use your finger tips to draw it up the sides of the pan and pat any cracks or holes together.  

The crust on the sides will taste like buttery sugar cookies, the bottom will absorb all the fruit juices, and the top crumbles are lovely.  Three different affects from the same crust mixture.    

You can make this with just four big cooking apples, such as Cortlands, or fill the spring-form pan with eight.  Don't forget the cinnamon sprinkled on the apples (not listed in the ingredients).  I've made it several times now --  it is the BEST!

The crust was very greasy, but after I let it sit a few minutes, it firmed up some and I could use it.  I think mixing the cinnamon into the apples before putting into the pie crust would have helped and I had to bake the two pies for about 20 minutes longer than stated and I used 9 1/2' pie plates.  Taste was good, though.

This recipe was taste tested by my skeptical Dutch born husband who gave it a gracious nod and "not bad".  I found it to be almost exactly like the authentic pie he makes.  I only used 4-5 apples in this recipe as there wasn't enough crust mixture to fit in any more in the springform pan.  I am making it again tonight and I will double the crust and use the full amount of apples the recipe calls for.  These pies are traditionally about 3-4 inches tall.  Mine was more like a tart.  My husband says the crust should be very thick up the sides and that this is the best part of the pie.  Another suggestion he made was to toss the apples in cinnamon before layering.  I suppose you could sprinkle the cinnamon in between the layers as well.  I only put it on top, and the pie was still super.  Those are the changes I would recommend for a truly authentic Dutch appeltaart. Lekker!
