Not so quick... had to cook the lentils for a lot longer but it wasn't difficult to make. Good just not something that I would make regularly. My fiance requested that I don't make it again.. he is a little on the picky side.....

This recipe was good. I added much more vegetables and did let it cook a lot longer than the 20 minutes. I also added red wine vinegar to the lentils. The fish was excellent.

Loved this recipe.  I was surprised at the flavor from the lentils!  I added sriracha and cooked the tuna for slightly less time than suggested based on our preference.  Will certainly cook again!

I used shallot instead of red onion and added a bay leaf while cooking the lentils. I added lemon zest and more lemon juice while cutting back on the olive oil a bit.
