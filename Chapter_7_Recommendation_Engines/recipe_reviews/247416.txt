Excellent taste, but the pretzels get soggy VERY quickly. I have made this twice, and the first time I thought I just waited too long to serve them. However, when I made them the second time, I served them immediately, and they still became soggy within a few minutes. I think this would work better if the layers were arranged in a horizontal dip and you just dragged the pretzel across. This way there would be no wait time.

Once my wife spotted these I had to get my photo done quickly and in my haste I forgot to top them with the cheese. Regardless they are equally as good with or without the cheese. Five stars from both of us. I switched out the olive slice on some of them for jalapeno slices, oh yeah. No need for a special occasion to enjoy these company worthy appetizers. Thank you lutzflcat for sharing this.
