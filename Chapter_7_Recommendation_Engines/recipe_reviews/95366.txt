This is a very pretty and exotic looking and tasting cookie.  The jelly roll pan is essentially a baking sheet with sides - and you probably have one.  It does need to be the specified size though.  I doubled the pecans and this recipes is GREAT. The cookies must still be warm to cut - don't wait until they are cold.  The really stiff dough will cover the pan eventually even though at first it looks like it won't. I have made these cookies many times and they never last and I am giving out the recipe every time I take them somewhere.  The men seem to particularly love this cookie and my friend said they went great with tea. They have a toffee type flavor and there is something addictive about the flavor.  Also, the price of cardamom is around 75% less at an Indian or eastern type grocery store.  Don't pay the national chain prices!

Delicious and unique. Sort of similiar in texture to some North Indian sweets I've had (sweet, smooth and very dense) A note for making the frosting, 
Do not make the frosting until after the bars come out of the oven and you are almost ready to drizzle it. This frosting stiffens very quickly as it cools and looses the nice flowing consistancy. I recommend making the frosting right before you need it, it only takes 5 minutes to make. I put watm frosting in a baggie and drizzled it over the bars.
Additionally, I found I needed about 1/2 cup pecans, not 1/3.

Really really good.  Everyone at work loved them; had 3 requests for the recipe.  I used almost 1 1/2 cups pecans and still could have used more :).  Definitely cut while warm and do not make the frosting too early.  I started mine when the cookie part came out of the oven.  Might try in a 9x13 pan next time for chewier bars.  If using salted butter cut the amount of salt to 1/4 tsp or they will be too salty (comment from a recipe recipient).

I love the flavor of cardamom, and any cookie that turns out as good as these, even when half the butter has been accidentally left out deserves 5 stars! I had read about how thick and sticky the dough was, and mine was just crumbly (sort of like shortbread cookie dough) - that's when I realized I had left out half the butter!  I went ahead and patted it into the pan like you would do with shortbread and continued per the recipe.  I cooked it a few minutes less (just kept checking by patting the dough), and cut them into bars immediately upon taking them out of the oven, then poured the glaze over.  They were probably crisper than they would otherwise have been, but extremely tasty.  I plan on adding this to my Christmas cookie repertoire.  Might even use the full amount of butter - haven't decided yet!

These are pretty good, but the cookie portion was not nearly as good as I was expecting based on other reviews, so perhaps I did something wrong.  I used over 1 cup of pecans and that was just about right.  In the future, I'll add a bit more cardamom (I really like it) and maybe a pinch of cinnamon, and will use orange extract instead of vanilla extract in the icing.

I was called to bake for Church Bake Sale so I decided to try this recipe.  If I didn't like it I could bake something else.  I don't want to give these to the bake sale! I did wet my palms with cold water when patting the dough into the pan and used a generous cup of pecans.  GREAT aroma when baking!

These were excellent and easy! I love baking with cardamom and am glad to have another great recipe. The bars have a nice shortbread texture without being dry.

Will not make these again because I couldn't taste the cardamom; cutting them into bars was next to impossible, they break and crumble; pecans should be mixed in, a lot were wasted by placing them on top and then they fall off during cutting.  I could deal with the lost pecans and the crumbly-ness, but these just don't taste like much of anything.

I read all the reviews before making especially after noting the picture shows pecans IN the dough and not on top.  So I followed the suggestions for 1/2 cup pecans mixed into the dough and then 1/2 cup on top of the whole egg white brushed on top.  I lined the pan with parchment paper and then put another piece on top to roll the dough flat (it was very stiff).  I did add 1/2 tsp cinnamon, yum! And, yes, make the frosting AFTER you remove pan from oven and then immediately drizzle on top. I put the frosting in a quart Ziplock bag and then snipped a corner off to make easy drizzling.  I let the cookie cool and frosting set for a few minutes and then cut into diamond-shaped pieces WHILE STILL WARM.  I separated the cookies gently along the cut lines and allowed them to cool completely.  They have wonderful flavor and I'm sure I will make them again.

These cookies need to be cut while they are still warm or you will have a crumbled mess. Also I read reviews that said the nuts kept falling off the cookie. So I whipped the egg white until soft peaks formed then brushed that onto the cookies base then sprinkled on the chopped pecans. This really helped keep the nuts on the cookies. Also I think cinnamon would taste better than cardamom in this cookie.

For me, these cookies had the consistency of shortbread.  They were very crumbly and very rich.  I could not taste the cardamom at all.  I did not drizzle the icing on the cookies to try and cut down on the calories and, instead lightly sprinkled decorative sugar on top to give the cookies a little color.  Pretty good for a shortbread cookie.

Everyone who tries these LOVES them.  They always try and identify the unique spice.  I did change the icing by just mixing powdered sugar with orange juice and zest of 1 orange drizzled over while still warm.  Thanks for the recipe.

These are very good. I will skip the glaze next time I make them. I don't think it helped the final product. In fact it was a little too sweet for my taste.

Excellent cookies. Used cardamom seed because I didn't have a way to grind them, and substituted 1/4 cup Splenda brown sugar and 1/2 cup Splenda white sugar for regular sugar.

Delicious! I cut them warm but left them in the pan too long and it was a bit hard to chip them out. I think I'd try to get them out sooner next time. Added more pecans. Love them!

Tastes like a spicy shortbread cookie - yummy. 1/3 cup of pecans was NOT enough, used more like 3/4 of a cup. Cut while warm, and they pop right out of the pan nicely when cool

Thank you Lea!  Today I wanted to make this recipe and couldn't find it, and then voila, here it is!  The only thing different in the recipe I use is I substitute the vanilla extract for almond.  Yum.

These were really good, if you like the flavor of cardamom.  I also used more pecans (3/4 cup).  My only problem was spreading the dough.  I finally covered it with plastic wrap and pressed until it covered the pan then removed the plastic.  Really good.

Not bad but very very crumbly. I wasn't overly keen on the frosting stuff either. I love cardamom, but it was a wee bit strong (could have been that the stuff I used was very fresh, and, therefore, potent). I probably won't make this again. Thanks though!

Yummy, and it got rave reviews from all my friends. I used almond extract instead of vanilla, and it was great. I added a bit of baking soda, and next time I would use half of the egg white in the recipe as well. I also might add a bit of maple syrup to the icing, though it was great as is.

Fantastic cookie. All my friends love them. I did change a little bit. I added cinnamon and used walnuts instead of pecans. I also you use butterscotch chips for icing after the cookies were done. Highly recommend this cookie

I used a little less white and brown sugar than recipe calls for due to several commenters stating they were too sweet , and they turned out very good.  I used a 9X12 pan with good results.

Very sweet (a little too much for me and I didn't even put the icing on the top) but yummy! They didn't come out as thick as the photo. They were almost cracker thin and very brittle. Broke up when I tried to cut them into squares. Fortunately the ladies at my fellowship group and my boarders at home don't care what shape they're in. Oh, and I didn't really notice a cardamom flavor even with the 1 tbsp of cardamom and that was the reason I chose the recipe, my Swedish roots.

Made these just as the recipe states except used 1 cup chopped pecans. Also, waited to make glaze just as bars were coming out of the oven, do slightly brown the melted butter it gives a slight Carmel flavor to the glaze great with the cardamom spice. These are a keeper to make many times over!

I made a few small changes.  Added the whole egg, cut back the vanilla to 2 t., mixed the pecans into the batter, used a 9x13 pan, baked at 325 for 30 minutes.  Definitely cut while warm.  These sure went quickly!

Crispy goodness. Smelled lovely baking away in the oven. Tasty and a nice change from the usual drop cookie. I worried about the egg wash that I’d end up with cooked egg on top but it turned out fine. I also pressed those expensive pecans slightly into dough so they wouldn’t just fall off. Tip on the icing, don’t make it until close to getting those cookies out or it will harden up on you. Slice cookies while warm or you won’t get them cut.

I made this cookie bar thinking that it was going to be softer, but it was so crispy that it tasted nasty.  I threw the whole batch to my chickens.

Amazingly good. I love cardamom. Also had a great shortbread-type texture. Liked the simple icing, too. 
1) Didn't have pecans, used walnuts. Didn't use more than suggested because I didn't feel the need for a solid nut layer lol. None fell off - I chopped them finely and after sprinkling them on, I just patted my hand over them to press them into the dough a little bit.
2) Yeah, don't make the frosting early, it sets up quickly. Also, when you mix the butter into the confectioner's sugar, it won't be a liquid, so don't be concerned, just mix until you get an even "crumb" texture.
3) Yes, cut them while warm.

I made these for an Indian-themed party--I made them with crisco instead of butter and it was a little too crumbly and the cardamom flavor was really strong.  Maybe next time I might 1/2 the cardamom and add some almond extract?

I made these on a larger pan than the recipe called for because it was all I had. They ended up spreading all over the place and I getting very crispy on the edges. They came out very thin and my boyfriend said he preferred the crispy ones anyway! The glaze is a nice touch,but please measure the cardamom exactly. I used a heaping tablespoon and I think the cardamom was a bit overwhelming. Use a level tablespoon or even just shy of it. Even with all the mishaps I do feel it is a good recipe. I think I will make it again in the right size pan but with a little less cardamom.
