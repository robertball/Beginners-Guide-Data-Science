I made fish packets with aluminum foil following this recipe and cooked them on an open fire . Instead of tilapia, I used haddock schrod (because it was available), and the dish was delicious. I found no need to measure most of the ingredients. I do suggest using one chopped tomato per packet to one 1/2 lb. strip of fish. Then add an estimated amount of onion, capers, garlic, and kalamata olives. Coat the fish with olive oil evenly before closing the packets tightly. Thanks for the great recipe that I will use when company visits and we cook outdoors.

Iâ€™m not a chef by no means. I enjoyed the flaky texture of the fish, I also enjoyed the topping. I added salt based on other reviews and it just seemed to be lacking in something. Others have suggested feta cheese and I think that might just be it.

I had fresh garden tomato and added some butter and red wine to the sauce. I used green olives instead in the topping and it was very good on the fish.

The fish is very bland. The topping, however, is delicious!  I highly recommend seasoning the fish filet before cooking. In the very least, use salt, pepper and garlic powder. You can also saute it in a bit of olive oil in a pan for added flavor, instead of baking in the oven.
