This is an amazing cookie.  I made a couple of changes, 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white, 3/4 tsp vanilla, used pecans and raisins and sliced the rhubarb fairly thin, then coated it in the flour mixture before mixing with the wet ingredients.  Do yourself a favour double the recipe I wish I had as I am going to have to make it again tomorrow night.  Thanks... going onto the favourite list.

Really good, but changed quite a bit... Used 2 cups whole wheat pastry flour and added 1 cup of rolled oats.  Increased the butter by 1/4 cup and used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Also increased rhubarb to 2 cups because that's what I had.  I did not use raisins or nuts just 2 1/2 tbs of flax seeds, same amounts of everything else.  Baked for 10 minutes, these were amazing, I will make them again and again they really showcase the rhubarb-I enjoyed that!

I recommend chopping the rhubarb into as small pieces as you can.   I blended half the amount of rhubarb to get the taste throughout the cookie, then the other half was chopped small.

Made a double batch from the get-go. Used half brown and half white sugar as well as half the cloves and replaced the other half with all-spice. Very much like a small piece of rhubarb cake. Will likely make again!!

These are pretty good, but mine turned out nothing like the picture, they looked like little biscuits. They're a little on the dry side, and you can barely taste the rhubarb. I would suggest doubling or even tripling the amount of rhubarb.

4.5 stars I read the reviews and tweaked accordingly. I doubled the recipie and am glad I did (I yield 62 cookies). I used all white sugar instead of brown and white, I used half clove and half all spice, I doubled the rhubarb (4 cups), and I used half all purpose flour and half whole grain. Also instead of nuts or other fruit (which I didn't have) I used coconut. They turned out great but they are definatly more muffin consistancy than cookie but thats ok because they are tangy, sweet, moist, and semi-healthy. I'll probably eat the whole batch tonight! lol

These cookies were pretty good. My husband loved them. I thought they were too soft but he liked that a lot about them. I thougt they had a good flavor to them. I used 1 teas pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon and cloves and used 1/2 cup almonds for my nuts. I did not use flax seed or rasins. Also, 12 min in my oven was a bit long. I will bake them for 10 or 11 min next time. Also, I think I will adding some friut next time like strawberrys or crasins.

I veganized the recipe by using ground flax and water as my egg, and Earth Balance as my butter.  I also used 1c whole wheat and 1c white flour, and used 1/4tsp each of cloves and allspice.  The final product was a good, lightly fruit flavored sugar cookie. Could have used a little more rhubarb, but that might be because of the whole wheat flour.

Good cookies! Our whole house loved them. I did have to substitute allspice for the cloves,but they were still great. I used raisins in them, but not the nuts. My husband and daughter hate nuts in things. They are very soft, which I consider a plus. I grow rhubarb and am always looking for rhubarb recipes. Thank you for sharing.

This was a really good cookie!!  I changed a few things:  I doubled the recipe, used 2 cups of frozen rhubarb (thawed and drained), 16 oz frozen strawberries, added 1 cup oatmeal, and like the others used half the sugar white and half brown.  For the rhubarb, I briefly chopped it in the food processor.  I thawed but did not drain the strawberries and also briefly chopped them as well.  I used everything else and cooked as instructed and they turned out AMAZING!  If you like strawberry rhubarb pie, you will really like them prepared this way.

I almost never write reviews here, but I feel this recipe is worthy of a review.  These cookies are just okay, I would say.  I didn't really change anything other than doubling the rhubarb and omitting the raisins, nuts, and flax.  As noted by others, these cookies are more like muffins.  In fact, you could probably cook them in a muffin tin and they would be very tasty.  However, as a HUGE rhubarb fan, even doubling the amount of rhubarb was not enough to overpower the ground cloves.  Personally, I would omit the cloves altogether.  Most of what I taste is clove, which is hugely disappointing to someone who likes strong rhubarb flavor.  I plan to try this same concept (a drop cookie with rhubarb) using a different base recipe like a standard oatmeal raisin cookie.  If that turns out well, I might post a completely new recipe of it here on allrecipes.com.

If I could, I would rate this cookie recipe 4 1/2 stars. I think it could use more rhubarb, but since I used some thawed rhubarb I had frozen, the cookies had more of a juicy taste. These would be delicious with strawberries! I will try these cookies again, but with a few changes.

I have gooseberry bushes in my garden and harvest the berrys when they turn red. By replacing the rhubarb, raisins, and nuts with gooseberries, I made gooseberry cookies. The combination of the berry's tartness and the sweetness of the dough is awesome. Because of a big harvest, I will be making and freezing hundreds of these cookies.

I have to thank Rachel for this awesome recipe!!!!  I just love it.  Like many, I did add a few of my own touches  according to my tastes, but it hadn't been for how tasty this recipe sounded I'd never have tried to make cookies out of Rhubarb.   I added a generous amount of fresh grated ginger and some orange zest to the recipe, and only half the cinnamon.  I did not add the other spices this time.  Can't wait to curl up with a book and enjoy these.  This is a MUST TRY  recipe.

Took several of the recommendations on this one but still good! I wanted a tart rubarb tasting cookie. So I doubled the rubarb but I'd probably triple next time if not more. Next time I'd leave out the raisins and cloves because they overpower the rubarb flavor. Added one cup of oatmeal and some coconut. I'd probably add more coconut next time. They are more of a muffin texture but still work as cookie. Will probably make again and try some adjustments.

Tried to make it healthier, substituted 1/2 of the flour with 2T milled flax seed & whole wheat flour to amke a cup,  and 1 C with oat flour, substituted 1/2 the butter with 1/4 C greek yogurt, didn't quit fill the cup with sugar. Used almond for nuts and used some chia seeds with flax seeds. They were still moist &  yummy.

Just average. Swapped out half white for lt bn sugar. Didn't use raisins or flax. Used almost 2x rhubarb and almonds-slightly toasted. Tasted like a fancy-soft spice cookie. No rhubarb taste. If I make it again will use half the baking powder/soda. These cookies do not spread.

Smells good.  I used chia seeds.  BUT  the cookies are REALLY dry.
