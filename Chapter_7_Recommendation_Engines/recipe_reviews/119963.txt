The flavor is a little strong. I find it tends to overpower the beef.

Cooked these today on a propane grill. I omitted the chestnuts because they kept falling apart on the skewr. Overall, a great marinate I got a lot of compliments! I made enough for 30 yet had enough meat to cook for later. :]

The marinade is delicious! I just used it to marinade my pork, and then put red onions, peppers and fresh mushrooms on the kabob. And they looked really pretty with red, orange and green peppers :)
