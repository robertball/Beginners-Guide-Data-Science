These waffles definitely do not have a waffle texture.  As other reviewers stated, they are soft and flimsy and I would say almost rubbery.   But.. the flavor is absolutely amazing.  I made these for my children who are on a dairy/soy/gluten/sugar free diet.  And if it were up to them they would eat them all day long!  We don't put anything on them, they are very sweet themselves.  But I'm sure they would be great with some fresh fruit.    NOTE:  I have recently read that the brand of Almond Meal/Flour can make a big difference in the consistency of the waffles!  So experimenting with different brands might be an option.

Suggestion for improving the texture of this batter:

If due to allergies you cannot add a different flour with more gluten (which would be one way to make these more waffley), then I suggest separating the egg whites.

We do this when making wheat waffles to add lift and fluffiness, and it should work here.

Just make the recipe as directed but before adding the eggs, separate the egg whites.  Then whisk the egg whites to stiff peaks before very gently folding them back into the batter.

Whisking to stiff peaks is tough - I suggest using electric mixers and you may need a stablizer such as cream of tarter.  But this should help the texture tremendously!

This recipe has some potential. My husband and I are fairly strict paleo eaters and so I did reduce the honey and added cinnamon to make up for the flavor. Like many of the reviewers I did not think these were crispy at all. I ended up baking my waffles for a few minutes at 350 to give them more crunch. It seems like there is too much moisture in the recipe-- perhaps one less egg next time. I also used coconut oil to grease my waffle iron.

I try to make a recipe as written to see how it works out, & most important, to see if my family likes it.   Unfortunately, this recipe was not well recieved by my family. The eggs, baking soda, & honey called for was too much for a single cup of almond flour & I should have caught that.  My results following the recipe was soft, almost flabby waffles. 

 I re-made the waffles with changes suggested by my celiac friend >> 3/4 cup almond flour, 1/8th teaspoon salt, 1/4 tsp baking soda, 2 large eggs,  1 1/2 tablespoons honey & dollop or two of buttermilk if needed.  Had much better sucess the second time around.

Since it's been mentioned that the almond meal/flour used can make a difference, I will say that I used 'Bob's Red Mill Almond meal' to make these.  I wasn't too sure about the lack of oil or milk, but I get plenty of both in my diet & I was surprised at how runny the batter was.  
**WARNING** These cook up FAST!!!  
My DH (the waffle chef at our house) burned the first one because they cook so fast.  As others have noted, they do not crisp up like a good waffle should.  Also previously noted, they are more "eggy" than a normal waffle (it reminded me of the "egginess" of a french twist donut).  These two things combined equal 1 star lost in rating.  Still tasty & worth adding to my personal recipie collection, but not over-the-top, all-out to-die-for delicious.  I liked the heartier texture & the light sweetness.  Even better with a sprinkle of cinnamon in the batter.  I also liked these better plain than I did with butter, which never happens for me.  Syrup is definitely not needed.  I didn't add fruit or yoghurt, as suggested, but may next time - I can see where they would compliment the taste & texture.  I also think I might try subbing almond extract for the vanilla.  
These are a pleasant change of pace that I will make again & I really love the natural ingredients that allows most of the people I know with health/dietary restrictions to enjoy these with me.

This recipe will go straight to my collection! Ok, these have an amazing flavor and bite to them. They are a bit on the sweet side, so they would go great with a simple fresh fruit topping and some plain old-fashion whipped cream. One thing I would like to mention is that they do not have the crispness or cakeyness of waffles; they have more of a pancake texture. That said, I would still make them in the waffle iron, as they shape up beautifully. Thanks nmyers11!

This recipe saved my life! I can't eat sugar nor white flour and I absolutely loved these waffles. I uploaded a picture after my second try at them. The only change I made was substituting honey with agave syrup. I also added some raspberries before putting the batter in the waffle iron but putting them on top of the waffles is also delightful! Thank you for this recipe!

The taste of this recipe is very yummy, texture is kind of soft but it is still good.  One suggestion that I have for the people who are trying to follow the paleo diet is using unsweetened apple sauce instead of honey and maybe using half coconut flour and half almond flour and use sea salt.  This will add the sweetness without the honey and will be paleo.  Although, I am not sure if this recipe is supposed to be paleo but if you wanted to make it paloe thats what I would do.

Heavenly!  I am allergic to wheat and gluten so this is great!  I woke up this morning and wondered what to make for breakfast, luckily I checked my email first and found this recipe.  It's a keeper! I took some mixed berries from the freezer and microwaved them with a little Splenda to serve over them and broke out the yogurt as you suggested.Yummm! Thanks for sharing.

I followed one reviewer's (untested?) advice and whipped egg whites with a pinch of cream of tartar.  Good idea, but if you follow the rest of the recipe exactly there's no way to blend the whites with the rest of the batter - the other stuff is too stiff - so here's what I did:
3 eggs, separated
1/4 cup almond milk
pinch cream of tartar

Mix egg yolks, honey, milk vanilla and dry ingredients.  Beat egg whites to stiff peaks and fold into egg-yolk mixture.

Because of personal preference, I cut back on the honey by about a tablespoon.  I added cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg (batter smelled like custard and nutmeg goes with custard).  I filled my 1 cup measure most of the way up with loosely packed almond meal (trader joe's), then topped off the last 1/2 inch of the measuring cup with a mix of oat flour and corn meal (medium grind).  The oat flour helps things stick a little, the corn meal adds a bit of crunch, neither adds gluten.

Waffles were delicious with a fluffy texture - not crisp on the outside, but not super rubbery either.  Topped with cherry compote and greek yogurt.

One note - Almond flour is usually HIGH FAT - this is why the recipe doesn't need any oil.

These are really good. Because we're not on any special diet restrictions we'll only use 2 eggs and add milk next time. The texture was a bit rubbery, but didn't put us off at all.

I have made these for a long time - just as listed.
I have a heat control on my waffle iron so cook them at a lower temp for longer and they do get crispy.  We also make them while camping in the pie irons / bush pie makers over the campfire - those get CRISPY
So many allergies in the family and these are safe for all and no one knows they are anything but "breakfast"
Personally I prefer them cold

TO GET THE PERFECT TEXTURE:
Follow the recipe, but add 0.5 cups of almond flour and 0.25 cups of ground flax. I use Bob's red mill almond flour and golden flax. I also recommend to leave out the vanilla extract, the flavor is so much better without it.

Love the taste.  I tried subsituting meal for flour, maybe next time half flour, half meal.  They do cook quickly and get way too dark.

The description below the title: "these crispy waffles" must not refer to this recipe. These were not the least bit crisp. I was very disappointed. I should have know better judging from the amount of almond flour to eggs. They were tasty, but flimsy like an omelet or crepe. A surprise result.

This one needs some adjustments. These lovely ingredients became dry inedible slabs. I followed advice in the comments and did half almond and half coconut flour and I kept my waffle iron on the lowest setting. The batter was like cookie dough, not runny at all, and I ended up with strange dry dense biscuity things. The flavor couldn't save it, and there was only a hint of flavor. If the ingredients lure me again I will try adding some kind of milk.

My first impressions: *very* strong egg flavor, not crispy, and a very light flavor/sweetness. Some may like this, but didn't really rock my boat. Now, since I read through many reviews before attempting this, I did do some things differently from the original recipe. Because I didn't have much almond flour, I used a mixture of flours (1/2 c almond, 1/4 c rice, 1/4 c sorghum); and I also separated the eggs and beat the whites before adding to the rest of the mixture. My thought was these modifications would improve the texture (I've read rice flour makes things crispier).  So, overall result: It was okay, and I plan to make again, but with some modifications. Next time I will try using 2 eggs and add some almond milk for more liquid. I will probably increase the amount of rice flour I use. I may also add a bit more honey or a bit of sugar (maybe brown?).

This recipe was a strong start, but with a few tweaks it becomes a five star project!  I changed the soda to 3 tsp baking powder and reduced the eggs to three.  The key difference is that I whipped the egg whites until stuff and stirred everything else together. Then I folded the white back in.  This improves texture and volume but is also why one less egg is better. This came out golden brown and fluffy, which is a major feat for Paleo!

Excellent! and so easy...a great healthy breakfast! I love mine with yogurt and fruit as well. When I don't have yogurt I use natural peanut butter and fruit preserves. The only ingredients I added were a tsp of cinnamon and a little more almond flour. I added more almond flour only because the batter was very thin, due to the fact that I only had jumbo eggs. The next time I make them I will adjust the eggs and see which turns out best! (more flour or less eggs) This is definitely going in my recipe box. I am always looking for healthy alternatives to feed my family, and they loved them!

I made one with the recipe as is and it was way too soft so I added more blanched almond flour for the next one. Then I tried adding a little oil, then more flour and a little milk trying to get a crispy waffle. Didn't work - I don't want to go through the trouble of whipping egg whites. If I wanted a soft aqnd fluffy breakfast food item I would have made pancakes. They also do burn VERY easy as another reviewer said.

I am a strick Paleo eater and this was great way to feel like I was getting a sweet/bread type meal... I used agave instead of honey and some cinnamon. I  only had 3 eggs in the house so that is what I used and I don't think the recipe needs a 4th. As others have said, they don't crisp up but the flavor makes up for that....

My husband followed the recipe exactly, cooked on the lowest setting on our waffle iron, and they came out really dark, bitter, burnt-tasting and with a terrible texture.  I will definitely not use this recipe again.

I was surprised that these turned out so well.  The kids ate them up!  I whipped the eggs and added 1/4 c. ground Flaxseed.  I would make them again.

Just made this today for Easter breakfast/lunch after church. I loved it. My husband not so much but that is okay because it just leaves more for me! They are very soft & not very waffle like & that is why I like them!

After reading very negative reviews for this recipe here, I was hesitant to try these. So glad I did!  They were delicious and completely satisfied my craving for waffles. The whole family enjoyed them with butter & syrup & we'll be making them often!

These are actually pretty good! the texture isn't as bAd as I thought it would be... very good flavor. they turned brown alot faster than traditional waffles... so my first one was a little dark. Very little carbs.. can't beat that!

This recipe is fantastic!  I did as another commenter suggested and whipped the egg whites to a stiff peek (with half a tsp of cream of tartar) before adding it to the rest of the batter.  It was definitely a light and fluffy batter, and the waffle, although not crispy, is definitely not pancake like as other commenters suggested.  Whipping the egg whites is the way to go. It was perfect with fruit and yogurt. So yummy. Oh, and I also added cinnamon to the batter, and will perhaps increase the vanilla next time.  But, really, I didn't AT ALL feel like I was eating a gluten free product.

I just had to review this recipe because I think many of the other reviews are misleading. I made these exactly as directed, except I added some cinnamon. Yes, the consistency of the batter is almost watery. You’d never imagine it could make good waffles. But it does!!! They cook up very quickly (1.5 minutes in my mini waffle maker) and yes, they are sort of limp at first. But once they cool down a bit, they are a bit stronger consistency and SO LIGHT AND FLUFFY AND DELICIOUS! No, they’re not crispy waffles, but they are incredibly delicious and very filling!

This is a good base recipe. As others mentioned, following the recipe as is will have the waffles cook up to be a bit springy, zero crispness. A bit eggy for my personal taste. Next time I will eliminate two of the egg yolks, add a pinch of cinnamon, pinch of baking powder, a 1/2 tbsp  of coconut oil and 2 tbsp of milk. I think this may just do the trick to add crisp and lightening up the batter a bit.

I'd give these waffles 5 stars for flavor, but they are not light and crusty like a waffle normally is. They are soft with a consistency of a pancake or French toast. Fact I commented that they tasted like French toast. If you want a crispy waffle this is not the recipe for you, but the flavor was very good.

They were very good! I separated the egg yolks from the egg whites and beat until stiff. The almond flour made them darken quickly so they have to be watched.

Since I've had experience with other almond flour baked goods being too dense I added a tsp of baking powder to the recipe. I also whipped the wet ingredients to add extra air to the mix. 
So, These are great! I have family members with a strong sweet tooth. They usually reject anything made with almond flour or that uses honey to sweeten a recipe. They all happily eat these.

Sorry - but I would not make this again. Like all other posters said these look like waffles but they are not even close. They were like rubber toy waffles.

I'm not sure on what planet this might be called a waffle. More like a thick, soggy crepe-wannabe. Perhaps the ingredient proportions are in error? Way to much egg for the amount of flour. Glad we tried ourselves before company :(

This was great to tinker with, though I didn't make it as written. I swapped 1/4 of oil with Splenda to taste in place of the honey and added just enough water to make it batter like. Perfect, tasted amazing this way. Knocked off a star because as written is not waffley enough.

I made this per the recipe exactly. I will say as far as waffles go, you'll be disappointed since waffles are crispy. But if you want waffle shaped pancakes this recipe is 5 stars! I loved this recipe actually but just not as waffles ;) heads up, this cooks SUPER fast! Less than a minute fast. So don't walk away from your waffle maker and make sure you have your plate ready to put it on. They are just sweet enough that you don't really need anything else, but I bet some macerated strawberries and some coconut whipped cream would be amazing on top.

I used Eggland's best (Cracked and Ready) eggs, 5 packets of Splenda instead of the honey, and added a heaping tablespoon of coconut flour.  Put the batter in the fridge overnight. Texture was not rubbery, even a bit crispy. Will make again soon.

I have been staying away from wheat products for the better part of two years and have missed having my homemade waffles that my family always enjoyed. These were pretty  darn good. As most people said a little soft but yummy. I did not have any honey so I used maple syrup, which I love, and added 1/4 cup more almond flour to thicken the batter.  As an added bonus it only makes two and a half round waffles keeping me from stuffing myself. P.S. Fresh blueberries and strawberries completed the great breakfast.

I thought the waffle was too eggy for my taste, as I'm not a big egg eater, however, my daughter absolutely loved these. I did substitute agave for the honey and the flavor of the waffles was delicious; I just wish they didn't have that eggy taste...it reminds me of when there's too much egg batter used on French toast but all in all a good recipe.

The flavor is delicious

The waffles were easy to make and made for a great breakfast for our family attempting to eliminate normal flour.  The texture was a little less firm than normal waffles- it had the typical almond meal texture so although this is not a fault of the recipe, it's something to note.  The flavor was good and the waffles were tasty enough that they could have been eaten without syrup.

Dig these waffles, especially with some minor adjustments. First, to all the people who think they aren't crispy enough, trade the honey for organic brown sugar and they will crisp up nicely. I don't mind that they are a little soft, I just add a couple of mashed up bananas and they taste like banana bread waffles. I also add about a 1/4 cup of tapioca starch and two tablespoons of butter to help them hold together better. I never would have tried it without this recipe giving me the idea. Thanks for the post.

Here are my changes  1/2 cup almond  flour, 1/2 cup coconut flour, salt, soda, 3 eggs, 1 cup almond milk, almond extract, 1/4 cup applesauce, 3T honey, 1T coconut oil. Mixed in frozen blueberries. Check for consistency and add more milk if needed as coconut flour soaks liquid up. Results were phenomenal. I don't like waffles flimsy or eggy waffles. These were right on! Makes 6 waffles in Belgian waffle maker.

These waffles were pretty good and pretty quick to make.  My 3 year old woke up wanting waffles, and I needed something quick.  Every other paleo recipe out there is much more involved.  These took 5 minutes to put together.  Reading the other reviews, I used unsweetened applesauce for the honey so they wouldn't be too sweet.  I did add about a teaspoon of honey along with the applesauce.  They were not too sweet with maple syrup on them.  The waffles were not crisp like "normal" waffles, but the they weren't too flimsy either.  I give this recipe 4.5 stars, only losing 1/2 a star for the consistency.  Although they lack in consistency, the time it takes to throw these together makes up for it.

This recipe was gross, way too eggy and you could taste baking soda.  Not crispy in the least.  I had to douse it in chocolate chips and maple syrup so as not to waste my almond flour.  YUK!

I love theses waffles but I did things a little different.  Instead of vanilla, honey, and baking soda I used milk, powdered sugar, and baking powder.  I felt that it made the waffles have better texture, and firmness to the waffle. :) :) But overall I like the recipe!

These are perfect for the gluten free and paleo people in my family.
I'm experimenting making it into pasta substitute, sans honey/sweetners.
Beating the egg whites until stiff is a good suggestion and gives body.
I also tried brushing the waffle iron with clarified butter (Ghee), cooked the waffle until crisp,  and came out with something tasting like a butter cookie.  Thanks NMyers11, for sharing this recipe.
