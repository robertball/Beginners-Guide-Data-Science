This recipe is awful.  Anyone with taste buds will find it extremely bland.  Not worth the little effort it does takes to make this dish.

Very disappointing. Granted, it was a very easy recipe and it required almost no work at all, but there was hardly any flavoring at all. It tasted like plain chicken, nothing else. I thought that the sauce amount was too small. If I were to do this again, I would probably double the amount of the sauce and season the chicken before putting it in the oven. I won't be making this again anytime soon though, I have plenty of other recipes I would rather try.

Sauce needs to be thicker.  I recommend cooking the sauce and using a thickener.

This was a very tasty dish.  I added extra pineapple juice and a little ginger, it was wonderful.  Not bland like some of the other reviews said.  I also served it with asparagus and drizzled the sauce over that as well as the chicken.  If you do not love pineapple, you may want to scale down the amount used, there is a lot of it.  Yummy!

We love pineapple so this was yummy! Make sure your dish is in the lower part of your oven or the pineapple will over-cook. Very quick and easy - will make again!

After I baked the chicken the honey glaze was very runny and diluted! I made the glaze again and poured it on after baking.
