So disclaimer: the mixed reviews scared me a bit so I did take several suggestions and added a few of my own -- so I did change it up quite a bit. And it was delicious! Here's what I did: I only had clementines, so I used those in the blender. I zested just a sprinkling of the peel into the bowl. The batter was runnyish in the end, so I added about 3 additional tablespoons of flour, to make it closer to a typical cake batter. For the sugar, I used half white, half brown. I used the called for oil. I used 1 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp baking powder. And I used the called for salt. I also added a tsp of vanilla and a tsp of cinnamon. I poured the batter in a glass dish sprayed with cooking spray. Then I sliced one Fuji apple thinly, tossed it in cinnamon sugar and put it on top. Baked it for 45 minutes or so -- just until a toothpick inserted in the middle came out clean. Let it cool about 10 minutes, sliced it in squares, sprinkled with powdered sugar, and voila. It was fantastic. Whole family loved it. Totally changed it up,  I know. But figured someone might like what I did. Cheers!

I really appreciate the omission of dairy from this recipe, even though I am not vegan :). I followed the recipe and added some extra ingredients to make this cake feel a little bit customized. I ADDED  an extra orange and a kiwi to the juice, which yielded 1 3/4 cups orange-kiwi juice, also 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, and i altered the sugar by using 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar ( this was not intended,  i ran out of white!!). The cake baked for 45 minutes, but that is probably due to the extra liquidity of my cake. I greased the pan with butter  This cake tasted chewy but not mushy with a flavor that displayed the fruit in a tasty but not overpowering way.

My cake came out tasting like baking soda. Tried again with a teaspoon of baking powder and it was much better.

This cake was amazing! After reading reviews I made a few suggested changes. I used baking powder instead of soda, I added the zest of the orange to the batter and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 regular.  I made a glaze with powdered sugar, orange juice and orange zest and poured it over the cake while still quite warm. This was better than any store bought cake we have had, vegan or not!

Super easy to make and delicious. I blended my orange in Vitamix, had to add 1/2 cup of OJ to make 1 cup.  I added all ingredients in Vitamix and  pulsed just until mixed. Changes: I added 2/3 zest of orange to batter, replaced 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda with baking powder. I also topped it with a glaze while it was warm: 2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup water, orange extract and zest added after sugar dissolved and syrup removed from heat. Everyone really enjoyed it!

Gotta say I was skeptical about an orange cake without dairy, especially eggs, so I was keen to try this recipe when I went to a vegan dinner party. Have made it twice now with good results each time varying the recipe. Both times it rose quite well and was moist. First time I added orange zest & bakng powder (not soda). It tasted great with strawberry coulis (punnet of strawberries puréed with a little sugar)and banana ice cream (puréed frozen bananas, that's it!). The second time I substituted 1 cup of the flour for almond meal, used coconut oil, and sprinkled 1/2 cup of frozen blueberries over the top. Recipe is a keeper.

This cake is surprisingly moist and very tasty! I made it with pineapple juice instead of orange, and it was a huge success with vegans and non-vegans alike :)

This cake is good but I will use it as a jumping off point from now on as I felt it needed more flavour.  Next time I will also both flour and grease the pan as the cake stuck with just greasing it.  I will add orange zest along with some fresh nutmeg, as well as using brown sugar for half the sugar called for, and some vanilla.  Also based on ratio, only 1 tsp of baking soda is needed.

Really good..I doubled the recipe,used half wheat flour and half white. The zest of two oranges (bit too much),half brown sugar and half cane. A tsp baking powder ,pinch of ginger and walnuts. Used half oj and half pineapple juice. Made an orange glaze. It cooked 35 minutes and didn't raise much but pretty good,moist cake. Yummy! FIrst vegan dessert I've enjoyed.

LOVED IT! I added the zest of the orange in addition to the juice from it. I also added 1t of pumpkin pie spice.  Another reviewer mentioned making a glaze for this cake out of vegan butter, powdered sugar, orange zest, and walnuts. That put the recipe right over the top! 

I loved that this was easy and quick to make. We will definitely come back to this recipe!

Very good basic recipe. I modified with what I had on hand.
Oil was replaced with coconut oil,
Baking soda was replaced with baking powder,
1 c flour PLUS 1/2 c coconut flour
Orange was replaced with about 1 c pineapple tidbits and blueberries pressed on top. Hubby n teens ate it up!

I baked this in a small cast iron! I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, and I added a dash of vanilla extract. I also laid slices of orange on the bottom and they caramelize perfectly. The batter was a little bit more like a dough, so I added another splash of orange juice, which may have been a mistake; the center never baked fully while the edges were browning, so I removed it and just ate it anyway. Not too bad!

This cake is just delish!  I grated some orange rind into the batter for a fuller orange flavor, added mini choc chips and dark choc icing!  Wow!  Also, used gluten free flour, which made is somewhat crumbly, but would be great in cupcakes.  Very, very tasty, even if you aren't vegan, gluten free!!

I've made this cake twice, and plan on making it more in the future. It's moist and delicious, and I like that the recipe just happens to be vegan, rather than using a bunch of substitutes. Perfect flavors for Fall, too.

Moist and tastes pretty good. I am surprised at the good texture. I don't know why it has a bit of a metallic flavor, but I thought it was good overall. I made a orange glaze with 1 cup of powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons of fresh orange juice, and a teaspoon of orange zest. I always like my cake with a frosting or a glaze. It turned out good.

Yummy!  This is really good and I didn't think I'd like an orange cake but needed to use up some orange juice. I decreased the sugar because I was adding a glaze. Also I've gotten where I use Pensey's Lots of Love when baking, which are little purple pieces of dehydrated sweet potatoes. 

Thank you for the recipe. I'm vegetarian but love recipes that don't use eggs.

I made mine with gluten free flour.  It ended up tasting like an orange bran muffin. Next time I'll add more orange rind or orange flavoring for a little more orange kick. Very moist and very good.

I made this cake and I swear it didn't taste like an orange cake.  It tasted like a banana cake. Tthe cake itself, besides the wrong flavor, has a strange consistency. Maybe I did something wrong to affect the consistency?? I don't know. BUt the banana flavor was not anticipated and not what I wanted.

I added 1 more orange to the cake for extra flavor and because the "cake batter" was way to thick so to wake it looser I added the extra orange.  It was a hit or miss in some spots for me because of the orange, but my family loved it.

Doubled the recipe and added a splash of vanilla, baked for 45 mins in a fluted bundt pan.   Used high pulp O.J. instead of the whole orange.  Birthday cake for a vegan friend.

Made it with a few modifications as said by different users, baked it for 40 minutes. Came out great, kind of like a coffee cake, after being refrigerated it was even better. Next time, I'll add a bit less sugar.

I made as it is and will not make it again. It was ok but lacked flavour.

The first one I followed the recipe completely but found it delicious but a tad sweet.  The second one, made a couple of hours later, I used 1/4 cup less sugar than was called for.  It was also delicious.  I’ll definitely make this cake again.

I followed the changes suggested by the top comment - 1 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp baking powder, etc. The orange flavoring in this cake wasn't too strong - even with the zest. I was hoping for something more pungent but it is nice and moist. I used blood oranges in my cake and the batter was purple and the cake itself is purple too. I glazed it with chocolate icing (coco powder, powered sugar, water) to add another layer of flavors to it. It compliments the hint of orange well.

When I said it was a vegan cake it didn't get many smiles from my family. Very different attitude after eating it! Everyone loved it!  I did add vanilla and did the tweaking to the baking soda, but aside from that followed the receipe. It was super easy to do. Thank you for sharing!

The flavor of this cake is delicious. Unfortunately, mine stuck to the bottom of the pan and tore up the cake fairly badly. So, while it looked a mess, it still tasted wonderful. The only change I made (besides scooping pieces out of the baking pan!) was to add an orange with confectioner sugar and a touch of hot water in the blender for a drizzle icing. Definitely trying this again.

I really like this recipe. I made it exactly as is. I found it to be very moist and a great density. Just did not have the orange "pop" I was hoping for. I thought about zesting an orange into the batter but opted not too (I didn't read reviews first, wish I had). With that said, this is really great will definitely make again, but orange zest it up.

Will definately make this again.  I added a can of mandarin oranges and used a cup of orange juice instead of processing an orange. Very moist and delicious!!!

Tried this with a lavender almond milk glaze and it pairs very well together. Also used a generous teaspoon of pumpkin spice and a bit of baking powder as well. Worked best in a bunt cake.

Too much oil in recipe. One guest thought it was a carrot cake with chocolate frosting. Others could not tell it was orange. Maybe chocolate frosting is too strong. Next time I'll try vanilla or an orange glaze. One person lived this cake. One person disliked this cake. Three of us thought it tasted ok.

Was looking for an eggless cake for my son birthday as one of the kids is allergic - this was great!!! Made a few adjustments as suggested by others: 2 cups flour, 1 tsp baking sode and 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp vanilla, and added a cinnamon/ginger mixed spice. Amazing! This recipe is fantastic as a base to get creative with. Definitely a winner!

Was looking for a vegan treat. This is SO delicious that you will love whether you are vegan or not. Am making again today. I folded orange chunks in to the batter, which worked very well. The crusty edges were actually my favorite part. It was like eating a cookie.

Very delicious , my husband is a huge fan of this cake now. I added a vegan Italian meringue buttercream icing on top, and finished with grated orange zest.

Nice! I added extra flour and 2 more oranges and used baking powder as opposed to soda (I never use baking soda due to the yucky taste). Also did 50/50 brown and white sugar. Plus had Betty Crocker vanilla icing handy so put on top. Mmmm. Also add a dash of nutmeg. Gobble.

I used 1 TSP baking powder instead of the 1 1/2 TSP baking soda. I peeled 1 orange & used it's zest in addition to the orange juice (it enhanced the orange flavour a lot). Mine was ready in 45 min yayyyy:)

Wonderful cake. Easy and eggless. I did us a strawberry banana orange juice, and opted for baking powder.  I was very pleased.

I have a dairy allergy and it's hard to find pastries that don't have dairy. This tasted great! I replaced 1/2 tsp of the baking soda with baking powder. Will definitely make again.

We loved this recipe! Very few ingredients, yet such a great cake. I thought it was a little crumbly, but my husband liked that.

Delicious and simple! I used canola instead of vegetable oil, so if you're doing this, I'd recommend using a little less, because you can definitely taste it. I also added Trader Joe's pumpkin pie spice (about a teaspoon should do, you could also just add any spice blend of your choosing). Will certainly be coming back to this recipe. *Also, just make sure you get all the seeds out of the orange(s) you're using*

Pretty simple recipe, which I love. I made a glaze for it as well, with powdered sugar, orange zest and orange juice, vegan butter, and walnuts. :)
