Made this tonight, exactly as stated. I admit, I was a bit skeptical about the amount of water and stuffing that it called for. It turned out much better than I expected. My oldest son and husband loved it. My youngest wouldn't touch it after a bite and I thought it had a nice flavor. The only thing I'd change is swap out 1 lb of the ground venison burger for ground venison sausage (something I do for all my meatloaves normally to add more flavor) and cut down on a little bit of the stuffing (the seasoning in it was a bit much with the barbecue.) The barbecue was much more predominant than what I usually taste in my regular meatloaf with ketchup. Very nice change!

This was PERFECT for me. Not a lot on-hand at the moment, but I definitely have all of this, I tell you. It was easy, delicious, and definitely NOT too onion-y. We used Sweet Baby Ray's for a BBQ and ohhh, OHHH. Perfect. Just perfection. Lean and wonderful. They couldn't tell it was venison! Loved this, definitely will use again.

I made some slight changes. 

Venison was 15% pork added. Used 2lbs. 

The BBQ sauce used was Sweet Baby Rays Honey. I added 3 tbs of Lea & Perrin Worcestershire to it. 

Used a small to medium white onion and a stick of celery chopped. 

Stuffing used was Stove Top Savory Herb. 

Replaced water with 3/4c of milk. 

For topping, rather than more BBQ sauce, I used my blend of Heinz ketchup, brown sugar, French's spicy brown mustard and Ghost Sauce (http://soninlaw.net)

It's good. I'll make it like this again.  Literally just finished eating and want more... Just no more room. ;-)

I made this along with another venison meatloaf recipe during the bow rut hunt.  It was my first time ever making venison meatloaf, and I was a bit skeptical.  But we had a freezer full of deer meat so I thought I'd give it a try.  The recipe was delicious and so easy.  I used chicken broth instead of water.  The hunters voted this the best recipe, and I will definitely be making this again!

This was great! A nice change of pace with venison, My 6 and 7 years old couldn't get enough. If the 6 yr old liked it then I will using this recipe again.

Made a few changes and both hubby and kids loved it! Thanks for sharing.
My changes:
7 oz Parmesan bread crumbs instead of stuffing
1 pkg onion mushroom soup mix by Lipton instead of chopped onion
3 TBS Worcestershire sauce
BBQ sauce was Smokey Mo's 
I added Heinze ketchup for added flavor on top

Won't be making this again. Waaaay too much onion, even with 2 1/2 lbs. of meat. My stupid fault for putting it all in, but I didn't realize it til it was too late. I don't think meatloaf is supposed to be crunchy. Could barely taste the BBQ sauce. Even added extra to accommodate the extra meat. Basically flavorless.

I omitted the BBQ sauce because ....no. And it turned out so good! These heathens I'm raising ate it like they had been held hostage and starved for a week.  My husband liked it so much he ate so much of it he felt ill from being over full. I used Sage Stove top dressing. Best meatloaf I've ever made and super easy and almost no prep time

I will definitely make this again!  The only thing I did differently is to use one lb of sausage and one lb of venison.  The flavor was divine.  So savory and perfect for comfort food.  My 1 and 3 year old both ate it up.  It really makes a huge serving too!

This was delicious! But I only baked it for 45 min and not 1hr as directions state. And I still wish I would have taken it out at 40 min. My gas oven cooks hot. I used savory herbs stove top stuffing and we loved it, I may add in some mozzarella cheese next time just because I can't leave anything alone. Haha.

Made this tonight. I used beef broth (canned) instead of water. The mixture seemed VERY moist and I was concerned, but it turned out great! We ate half of it with dinner and will eat the second half in a night or so. I've tried a lot of meatloaf recipes (using beef) but this is definitely one of my favorites. I will be transferring this to my recipe box!

Love it! I make this all the time!!! My 3 daughters, husband, and I. It's wonderful. I use minced onion in ours. And add a little of my own dried spinach powder(sneaking veggies in everywhere I can) but the meatloaf is wonderful on it's own as well ??

Have made this a couple of times and it always turns out great.  The only substitution I made was I mixed up ketchup, spicy mustard, and brown sugar for the barbecue sauce as I didn't have any.  I mix the recipe as is but freeze half of it for a later meal.  Freezes great and just add more sauce when I am ready to cook it for supper.  Definitely a keeper.

I made it for dinner tonight.  I substituted 1 lb of venison with 1 lb of ground beef (only had 1 lb of venison thawed)!  Turned out moist and very flavorful.  Awesome recipe!!

I used cornbread dressing, sweet baby ray's original, but only 1/4 cup in the meat. Just for juice I covered the top completely with thick cut hickory smoked bacon. OMG. I made the mistake of taking to a pot luck at church, I got one small portion and great reviews from everyone that got to it before me.

01-20-16 ~ Made this meat loaf as directed, but split it in to two one-pound loaves.  Baked one for my husband and froze one to send to TN with our son and DIL.  It was super easy using a box of stuffing for the filling.  They all liked the taste, and I liked the ease.  Since we have a freezer full of venison, I'm sure I will be making this again, for them.  I am not a venison eater.

Yummy! Used 2 lbs of venison and turned out great. Instead of putting the bbq sauce on top, I added it to the mix and used another sauce for the top. Moist and Tasty!!

DELICIOUS!!!!!! First time making anything with deer meat and this will definitely be one I will make over and over!!! Only thing I changed was I added half a bell pepper finely chopped...I also forgot to put water but it really didn't make a difference on the taste...the meat made its own juices.

I made some changes. I used 2 lb venison and 2 lb ground turkey. To make it gluten free I used 1 cup certified gluten free quick oats instead of the stuffing. I left all the other ingredients the same as for the 2 lb venison recipe. It came out very moist and tasty. Next time I will use more bbq sauce and less water in the meatloaf with 4 lb meat. The loaf held together well - this is a major victory when trying to cook anything gluten free! Definitely a keeper!

We've made this recipe 3 times in the last couple months and love it. The stuffing mix really adds great flavor and texture. We have made it using both venison or ground bear meat, and both turn out great in this recipe.

I thought that this recipe was excellent, if not just a tad salty.  I will adjust the amount of salt I add next time.I added half a grated onion, rather than the whole finely chopped. It was easy to make, moist and very tasty.  I will definitely make this again,

Such a great low-carb meal! I cut back on the stuffing as suggested and added a few dashes of Worcestershire to the top along with smoky BBQ sauce.  Served it with cauliflower and broccoli with cheese sauce.  The meatloaf crust was so good, my husband liked this recipe better than his mother's! Super easy to make too!
