Was looking for something a little different to serve at a shower and this was a nice.  For those who wanted something sweeter they were a hit.  When summer arrives and fresh fruit is available I will give both strawberries and blueberries a try.   I am certain I will do these again.

This is the first time I've ever made crepes and they turned out wonderfully.  I used fresh fruit since it's in season and the filled crepes are delicious.  I would be very happy if my family made these for me for Mother's Day (hint, hint!).  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I don't know I wasn't too impressed with this recipe, maybe it just me and crepes aren't my thing. Either way I won't be making this again. Just too eggy, I had my doubts to begin with though. I will say one thing the crepes cooked up beautifully no sticking at all and the filling was delicious.

These were great! I found that if you whip the crepe batter until a light/pale yellow and rest it for 15 mins before cooking they don't have the eggy taste. These were light and tasty. Thank you for the recipe

I have had crepes but I have never made them. This is a great recipe. My family love them! The only change I made was to use melted butter instead of the oil. Thank you for your sharing recipe!

We found this too sweet as a breakfast, if you had it as an appetizer at a party it would be good... I doubled the recipe except for the cream cheese and we still found it quite creamy... a bit too much.

Increased the amount of batter to make 8 rolls for the amount of filling. An excellent start to this Mother's Day by me, the amateur chef dad! I will make again but maybe cut back a bit on the filling (for my belt size). ;)

Instead of mixed berries I just out raspberries and it was delish. I also loved the crepe part. It tasted really good with the inside.

I was looking for some way to use some fresh fruit I had left. I used the cream cheese and the sugar spread. I then put it on a flour tortilla instead of the crepe. My family liked it and asked for it again.
