Great receipe. So yummy. Like toffee. Only thing I did different was to sprinkle chocolate chips on it after it came out of the oven. Give them a few minutes then spread over grammies. I broke em up and storered in a plastic container.

My mother always made this.  The only difference is that we used brown sugar.  I prefer that.  We cooked the sugar mixture about 10 minutes and then sprinkled on salted pecans and baked them for 10 minutes at 350.

I agree too much butter/margarine in the original recipe so I tried it again. I used: 1 cup of butter 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of chopped pecans with 3 packets of cracker (27 whole crackers) and they came out a better consistency. I also tried the trick with adding chocolate chips on top and that worked nicely. I did not frost the entire cracker with them as that seemed overpowering I did a heavy drizzle

i grew up eating these cookies, they were a go to around my grandma's house. her only difference was that she used almonds rather than other nuts. 

my aunt on the other day made them fully loaded, she added chocolate chips and coconut and cinnamon and even mini marshmallows (added after baking while still hot) along with the nuts. 

I prefer this purist version though!

It was very tasty but butter mixture did not cover the entire cracker area. Will also try more pecans next time.

My family likes these! It is actually a recipe an elderly German lady gave me a number of years ago. I do use more pecans and cook the butter/sugar sauce a little longer.
