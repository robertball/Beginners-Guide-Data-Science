This was a HUGE hit with the WHOLE family.  I think you could use any flavor of instant pudding.  I'll try butterscotch next time I make it.  Thanks!

Wow! Love this "cake". I made this for Christmas since I thought the pistachio green would be pretty. This one was a big hit and a few people have asked for the recipe. Easy to make and very tasty. Now I wonder how it got it name. .......

I had to put this in a graham cracker pie crust because I was short on time but will try the crust next time. With that being said, it came out delicious. I sprinkled some green sugar crystals on the top and made it look festive for the holidays. This dessert was gone in no time and everyone seemed to enjoy it. Keeper!

This was a huge hit with my family and my husband, who isn't a pistachio fan, keeps asking me to make it. I want to try adding a layer of fudge sauce between the crust and pistachio layer, but my husband refuses to let me mess with "perfection."

Excellent recipe!  Got rave reviews from family members!  

Would someone tell me how this awesome creation got the "Robert Redford" name?

My Mom has been making "green stuff" for more years than I can recall. It's harder for her now with arthritis, so I am going to mix things up a bit and make it with chocolate pudding. Will probably double the cream cheese layer as it is the best!

My mom made this when we were growing up.  We call it FOUR LAYER PUDDING and always make it with pistachio pudding.  I've never had anyone NOT like it!!!

My sister used to have a recipe like this one, but lost it.  I made this with chocolate pudding.  It was very good, but next time I'll make double the cream cheese mixture; I could barely taste it and that's my favorite part :)

This is a versatile recipe that can be used with a number of flavor combinations: banana cream w/ sliced bananas, oreo, chocolate w/pecans,etc. When someone has a craving for a cream pie, this is what we make

This is awesome!  I put some pink and green sugar and Springy things on top and used all the walnuts (plus!) in the bottom.  The cream cheese layer could easily be doubled.  I can't wait to try it with other flavors but really liked the pistachio!  I'm going to do chocolate next with chocolate cream cheese!  Lemon after that...
