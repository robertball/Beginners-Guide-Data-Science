Wow!  I love this stuff!!!  I just made it, and I can't stop eating it.  Great with veggies and with light tortilla chips too.  My sister uses a similar recipe, but it has ranch dressing mix instead of veggie mix and 1/2 c. parmesan cheese.  One could alternate for variety.  Be sure to use light, low-fat, or fat-free sour cream and mayo to cut calories and fat though.  There's no sense in ruining a perfectly healthy snack or appetizer with all that fat!

I used marinated artichoke hearts instead of the water chestnuts and it was fabulous!

I wasn't really sure how this would turn out as at the time I made this recipe there were only 4 reviews of it. I made it exactly according to what was posted. At first taste I was incredibly disappointed, however after letting the dip sit in my fridge for about a 45 minutes, I was amazed at how fantastically the flavors seeped into each-other. I don't think that I would change anything. My advice to anyone making this dip is to make it a day or even a few hours in advance to allow it to really bring out its wonderful flavors. Thanks for such a simple and tasty recipe!

This is a great dip!  Sometimes I add dried dill and/or chives or green onions, but it is perfect as a basic recipe!  Good way to get kids to eat veggies. Thanks Susan!

I only had 9 oz of spinach so that is what I used.  I had to doctor it up with 1/4 tsp each of onion and garlic powder.  I also added 1/2 tsp of seasoned pepper.  Everyone loved it but I know it would have been bland without the spice additions.

This is basically like cold spinach dip with a packet of veg mix in it.  I didn't like it at all to be honest and no one touched it at our superbowl party.  too bad.

Bear's Picnic Veggie Dip Haiku: "What a unique dip! Quick and easy to prepare. I didn't change much." I used light mayo and light sour cream, and leaned a bit heavier on the sour cream over the mayo, but otherwise, used the other ingredients and was really surprised at how good this dip was. Great for a veggie scoop, and equally tasty w/ tortilla chips.

I took it to bible study with fresh veggies and sourdough rounds- and the ladies absolutely loved it!  It's kinda a cross between spinanch dip and veggie dip.  It's thick enough to pipe onto cucumber rounds and top with cherry tomato halves or red pepper pieces.  It was really yummy!
