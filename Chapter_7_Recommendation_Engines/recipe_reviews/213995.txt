I started cooking this for friends who were coming over and things got off to a bad start. DON"T mix the breadcrumbs and sour cream in a separate bowl! In thirty seconds it becomes a hard lump that is impossible to get evenly mixed into the meat without completely overworking it. Cut down on the clove! 1/2 teaspoon is WAY too much. When these are cooking all you'll smell is clove. Not good. Lastly, be prepared to get something on-the-fly to go with these. There is no sauce and the recipe mentions something about beef gravy but there are no instructions for one and the gravy is NOT listed as an ingredient so when you print up the shopping list, the gravy doesn't get included. The taste is nothing but clove. Rather than dumping it out, I quickly saved it by grabbing a jar of heavily flavored spaghetti sauce and boiling up some pasta. Luckily dinner was saved. Hand out dessert right away before someone notices the after taste and send everyone home with your apologies. Look at it this way, you'll never have to cook for your friends again.

My grandmother was from Sweden. She used allspice and nutmeg, white bread crumbs soaked in 1 cup milk and just a little onion. If the meatballs grew larger than 3/4", you had to do them over! When the last meatballs were browning in the pan, she sprinkled a tablespoon of flour over them. Then added 3/4 cup of cream to simmer the meatballs. Made a nice gravy.

I made these last week and they were okay.  I did not have the same problem as the other reviewer with the sour cream and bread crumbs, my mixture turned out just fine.  I do agree that the clove is a little overpowering.  I made a brown gravy (package mix) and added the leftover sour cream to it to make it creamier.  Over all it wasn't bad, just not my preference in tastes.

All was well until I tried to combine the bread crumbs and sour cream, it was very hard to stir together and combined with the other ingredients. Once i mixed everyhting together it was too wet, i couldnt even form meatballs at all, I ended making it into a meatloaf.

I tossed the mixture (lump) of bread crumbs and added the sour cream and bread crumbs to the meat balls seperately and that was alot easier. Definitel halve the cloves/nutmeg or that will be all anyone tastes. Over all a very good recipe for someone w(like me) who is making meat balls for the first time.

Our family loved these. Per others recommendation I cut cloves amount to 1/4. We served with garlic mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce. Yummy!
