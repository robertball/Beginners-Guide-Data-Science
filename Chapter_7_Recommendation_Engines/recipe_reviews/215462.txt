This recipe was delicious!!! I would definitely recommend it! I used a little less onion & garlic (personal preference). Also, I omitted the Cannellinni beans and only used half the can of Kidney beans. I then added 1 cup of chopped fresh broccoli. I added chicken breasts to a skillet with some cooking spray and Goya Adobo---YUMMY!!!
