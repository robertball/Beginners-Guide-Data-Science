I have been making this for many years at the holidays except that I add a tablespoon of orange marmalade to give it some zip.

This was good, but very, very tart. You might up the sugar a bit (to a cup or more) and let the cranberries pop as another member suggested.

This is a wonderful thick, tangy relish. My husband loved this. Goes great in turkey sandwiches. Definately a keeper.

I was never much of a cook before discovering Allrecipes.com and my family had always assumed I couldn't cook.  
So I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving last year.  I didn't have the proper dishware for serving so I used a disposable pan.  Well halfway through the meal I assumed no one liked the cranberry relish because no one was commenting on it.  Turns out they loved it so much they thought I bought it already made from the market.

Wow, these cranberries were tart!  I think you want to let most of the cranberries pop before you take them off the stove.  People enjoyed it, but I think it would be better served over ice cream or something like that, rather than as its own side dish.

I've made another of the cranberry relish recipes in this section, and it was ok, but this one is fantastic and so easy!  As with any recipe, I like reading the reviews and make any necessary change--to this recipe I went with the full cup of sugar as suggested and it worked out perfectly.  I actually made this relish for our company Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow, and made the mistake of sampling it--it has so much flavor it's hard to stop once you take that first taste.  This will be on our table each and every Thanksgiving from now on!

This was a very good relish which would appeal to a sweet palette. The inclusion of the dried cranberries added a nice texture.

I'm shocked that cranberry relish can taste this good - everyone LOVED it - must double the recipe next year so there's some left over for sandwiches the next day!

I thought this was great!  I did add more sugar (about one cup total) to help with the tartness of all the cranberries.  I also made this a couple of days in advance of our dinner to let all of the flavors mix together.  That made it perfect!

I've made this a couple times.  I do like the sweeter cranberry relish, so this one works for me.  Update: I made it again today.  It turns out I only bought a 12 oz bag of cranberries, but it was still very good.  Also, I always let nearly all of the cranberries pop.

Sorry.  I followed the recipe exactly.  This dish is so sour that I was unable to unpucker my face for at least two full minutes.  It didn't smell very good while it was cooking, so during my last minute shopping, I picked up a can of the ready-made stuff.  I'm glad I did.  If you like TART, you may like this recipe.  It didn't work for us.

This is great. Will go perfect with my Christmas ham. BUT - I just want to point out this is NOT a side dish, it is a condiment so you don't eat it on its own.  And if it is too tart add more sugar. Some cranberries are more tart than others but they are never sweet so you have to add the sweetness to your taste.

I usedmixed berry frozen juice because I couldn't find any frozen cranberry juice, even at Harris Teater;  Used vanilla granola for some crunch.  Next morning, I added about 1 C. orange/mango fresh juice to loosen it up.  It was fabulous.  Big hit. took 2 minutes to make.  Will definitely make it again.

I didn't have cranberry juice so I substituted pomegranate juice. I cut back the sugar a little and added a diced apple. It was great. Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner loved it.
