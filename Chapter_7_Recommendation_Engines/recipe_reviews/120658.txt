These pancakes were light with a hint of orange flavor.  My kids loved them.  I loved the buttery orange sauce.  I will make these again!

The pancakes are 4 stars- they are a little thin and flat, but have good flavor.  But the orange sauce is 5 stars.  It is incredible, and we ended up eating it on our plain buttermilk pancakes the following day.  This morning my daughter had some on her toast, as it thickened up in the fridge to almost be jam-like.  It has just the right sweet/tart combination, and makes more than enough for the pancakes.

Sooooo good! We've making this type of pancake for a while but this recipe is excellent. The last couple of weekends we just used pure maple syrup and it's delicious. We just tried the orange syrup and it's out of the world good. The recipe  will likely make more than you need. Highly recommend. Probably the best pancakes I've ever had. Kids loved them too. Total crowd pleaser.

These are so orange-y and delicious.  I used fresh squeezed oranges for the batter and sauce.  My kids liked it so much that my 4 yr old asked for the recipe!

Pancakes have a good soft texture, and the syrup goes perfectly with it. The only reason I'm giving it for stars is because its just a little to much citrus for me.

The pancakes were really good, light and fluffy.  I used Tropicana pure premium OJ and the flavor was strong, but my kids really liked them.  The syrup was too sweet, so next time I'll 1/2 the sugar.  I did take the left over syrup added garlic and then put my pork chops in there as a marinade.  Cooked them on an indoor grill and they turned out very yummy.  The cornstarch did make the pan smoke a little more than I would have liked, but they tasted great.

This recipe is awesome!  I've never liked pancakes, but after trying this, I realized that I just don't like buttermilk pancakes.  These are light and delicious!

These are very light pancakes with just the right amount of orange flavor (very subtle & just enough).  The batter is thin, so I added in some extra flour. I will probably add some whole wheat flour in next time...and yes, there will be a next time!  The orange sauce was a nice change.  The orange sauce is thin just as some other reviewers mentioned, but we liked it just fine.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made this exactly according to the recipe, except that I added a half teaspoon of powdered ginger and halved the sugar in the sauce. The batter is thin, but if you make around 1/4 cup sized pan cakes as per the recipe they still turn out just right.

So so good. I made this for breakfast today and I was so impressed and I have to say the best pancakes I have ever had. I loved the orange sauce but my boyfriend said he doesn't like orange peel. It is good he doesn't know it is also in the pancakes as he loved thous. I made them exactly how the recipe calls but changed olive oil for butter as that is all I have and I cooked them in butter too.. SOOO yummy I have more left in my fridge for tomorrow. YAY Thank you so much

A great pancake!  Light, fluffy with the orange flavor in the background.  I didn't have fresh orange to zest which I'm sure would have intensified the flavor.  I will make again.

Haven't made the sauce yet, which is probably the crown jewel of these pancakes.  Easy and good, may make again.

I enjoyed these pancakes. I didn't use the syrup recipe, though.  The flavor of the pancakes were great, by themselves.  I saved this one.  Oh, I also substituted the o.j. for mango juice (its what I had) and lemon zest for orange zest. Still yummy.

This review is for the sauce ONLY. I thought it was too thin & needed more sour flavor, so I wound up adding more cornstarch mixed in lemon juice. It makes a very generous quantity of sauce! This sauce has a lot of potential but isn't quite perfect for my needs yet. Thanks for sharing!

Really liked the flavor in this one, but did not care for the texture. Another reviewer dubbed them 'rubbery' and I would agree. My review does not include the sauce, as we topped them with honey butter and 'Orange Breakfast Crunch Topping' (AR's).

Yum! These are really a great change from traditional pancakes with maple syrup. They pancakes are very tasty - and fine without the syrup - but I STRONGLY recommend giving the syrup a shot! It's easy (mix it up while the first batch of pancakes is cooking) and you probably have most of the ingredients on hand. I only did half the recipe for the syrup and it was more than enough. *I omitted the zest because I didn't have oranges, just orange juice. *Used half all-purpose and half whole wheat flour. This is a wonderful recipe - I cannot believe only 9 people have tried/reviewed this SUNNY, scrumptious recipe!

I liked the sauce better than I liked the pancakes, the pancakes seemed a bit rubbery, maybe because of the sugar and the sugar in the OJ.  Next time I might try this with Bisquick and a 1/2 recipe of the sauce.  There was way too much for the amount of pancakes that this reciped made.

My family thought these pancakes were delicious.  I loved the texture and the orange flavor was so yummy.  They were good alone and with the sauce.  I pretty much made them as directed: used fresh orange juice, half whole wheat flour, and had to add a little cornstarch mixed with cold water to the sauce to thicken it more.  Mmmm-mmm

I did enjoy these pancakes, but my kids and husband didn't care for them much.  They do have a different texture than buttermilk pancakes, probably because mostly orange juice is used rather than milk or buttermilk, so I think that threw them off.  The batter was very thin when I mixed it up but it seemed to thicken up at bit while it sat and was just the right consistancy when I was ready to pour them out on the pan.  The kids didn't care much for the syrup either, which I thought was really yummy.  I think next time I would add a bit more cornstarch though since I would have liked it a bit thicker.  Next time I will stick with a buttermilk based pancake and add the zest and some orange extract.  I think the kids might go for the orange sauce if they liked the pancakes I served it on.  I would give the recipe 4 stars, the kids would probably give it 1, so I compromised and gave it 3.

I'm actually only rating the pancakes as I didn't make the sauce. My girls like their pancakes with butter. These were light and fluffy, and the orange taste was very subtle. I might just down the baking powder to 2tsp next time as we seemed to be able to taste it. I'd still like to try them with the sauce as well. Thanks.

These were very good.  Light, tasty pancakes - not as rich and filling as with maple syrup.

These were awesome -  a refreshing change from the traditional buttermilk pancake.  They had a nice citrus flavor and great texture.  The orange sauce was fabulous.  I only added ½ cup of water because we prefer a thicker sauce.  We loved it.

With the recipe as is, I was able to make 8 smaller pancakes. This was a very good and refreshing end to Pancake Week. I didn' use as much orange zest because I'm not a big fan of the powerful taste. Other than that, I made as is and it tasted so good.

Delicious and simple.  My kids love this recipe.
