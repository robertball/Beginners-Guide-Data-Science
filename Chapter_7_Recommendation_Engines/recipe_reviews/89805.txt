WOW, This is a winner! My wife does not like peas! but I do :O) I was trying to find pea recipes so she would eat some. Well this is the one! And we just can't stop eating it! I constantly have to make a new batch so we always have some in the fridge... and by the way it stays fresh for a whole week in the fridge... One of the best salad EVER!
Thank for this great recipe :O)

I found this dish delicious! Second time I made it, I threw in some penne pasta and turned it into a meal. It was even better.

Had this last night, and LOVED it. Tasted it with and without almonds, and for us it was better without. We added more feta and used lots of freshly ground pepper, and had a feast. Next time we'll use white balsamic vinegar instead of red, as the color was a little strange, but the flavor was great. Five stars!

Wow!  I was really surprised how good this was.  The only almonds I had in the house were smoked jalapeno ones - I roughly chopped them and they really gave a great flavor.  The only thing I think I'll change next time is to omit the cheese - it really didn't add anything for me.  Thanks!

It wasn't what I was expecting.  If I make it again, I will replace the toasted almonds with water chestnuts and probably use less mayo.

I was worried that my guests wouldn't go for a pea salad - by the time I finished in the kitchen, there was one spoonful of this left for me to taste... 'nuff said!! I cut back on the mayo (used about a heaping tablespoon) and would cut back even more. I would also try adding more balsamic just because I love that kick. Substituted the feta with chunks of cheddar. The almonds are so perfect in this! I love peas so this salad is like a double whammy of deliciousness for me.

What says summer more than pea salad!  this  is a good down-home recipe, I did make a couple minor changes. I used Kraft 3 cheese Crumbles instead of the feta, also I sprinkled some bacon bits over the top and let this sit in the frig overnight before serving. The flavors mix together by letting this dish age overnight.

Great recipe.  The only things I did differently were to cut the mayo a bit, add a few more peas -I found it a touch too creamy- and a sprinkle of sugar.  Very very good.  Got my 4 year old eating green food!!

Oh yum this is so good. I have served this up a couple of times, especially when my vegetarian friends are coming over for a casual lunch, and we all love this salad. Sometimes I use basil flavoured feta but it is just as yummy with plain.

I took this to a recent family potluck and it was a hit with everyone.  A definite step up from other rather boring pea salads I have had in the past.  I will be making this again!!

Very good. Balsamic added a wonderful flavor to the pea salad. The dark balsamic discolors the salad though to a weird brown. I would try again with white balsamic in order to avoid the color

Wow isn't an appropriate enough word!  First:  I DETEST peas!  I was making something for my girls, as I firmly believe giving them the healthy variety, even if my palate doesn't care for it.  So, instead of just fresh peas as usual, I thought I'd mix it up for them.  I found this recipe and thought it had potential, plus it seemed simple enough.  I had no feta on hand, and only had canned peas.  Plus, I thought the mayo was way too much for something I was just whipping up for the kids (my husband hates peas too), so I only used 1/4 cup of lite mayo.  Mixed it all up, and as any good cook does, I tasted the creation, fully, 100% expecting my senses to go into rejection mode, but no!!  They didn't!  In fact, I had to taste it several times to realize I was actually LIKING it!  In fact, I liked it so much, we ate it right away without refridgerating!  Amazing!  Just goes to show - it's all in how it's made!  So, will most certainly be making again.  Will get frozen peas next trip to the store and feta also.  I actually will keep the mayo at 1/4 cup, possibly will try it with 1/2 cup, but certainly no more than that (like to mind the fat cals).  Thanks for expanding my horizons!   **Made again today... used frozen peas - even better!  We ate it all up!

Excellent PEA & CHEESE SALAD!  I added celery (a must), deleted the nuts and used extra sharp cheddar cheese as that is what I commonly have on hand.  If I had white basamic vinegar that would have made the color "prettier" but the balsamic vinegar really added to the flavor!

Excellent salad...I use SHARP cheddar chunks in lieu of feta.  Otherwise, no changes & everyone loves it.

5 Stars on flavor. Everyone really enjoyed this salad. The only thing I didn't like was the color. The balsamic vinegar turned the mayo and feta cheese kinda tan. I think a little cheddar cheese thrown in would help the appearance. Either way, I will make often. Thank you for a great recipe!!

Been making this for about 40 years.
To the reviewer who cooked the mayo, that is not suggested in this recipe. You only cook the almonds. The rest of the ingredients are just folded in, after taking the almonds off the stove.
This recipe usually tastes a bit better after sitting in the refrigerator overnight or for at least four to six hours.
Serve on lettuce leaves (Bib, iceberg, romaine, red or green leaf) for a pretty presentation.

The balsamic vinegar gives this pea salad a great twist of flavor.  I reserved some of the toasted almonds and sprinkled them on top for a fancier presentation.  I'll keep this recipe handy - it's an easy and impressive side dish.

I needed to make a lunch to serve 20+ volunteers working at a spay & neuter clinic, and I was looking for something a little different than the same old pasta & potato salads. I decided to give this a try based on great reviews. I didn't anticipate liking this salad myself, because I really don't like peas. What a surprise!  I wish I had tripled it so I could have had some for my family!  I added a red bell pepper for color, used half cubed gouda & half feta (didn't have enough feta for the double batch) and substituted cashews for the almonds because it was what I had in the pantry.  I mixed in the cashews about an hour before serving so they'd stay crunchy.  Fabulous!!!  Quick to throw together and I like that it's better when you make it the day before- saves time on event day.  I will definitely make this again.  Even if you don't like peas, give this a try!  You may be pleasantly surprised.

I'd also add less mayo and add in the bacon bits. I like a bit of spice so I added red chili flakes as well.

Loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly, and while it was great, next time I'll cut back significantly on the mayo...it just doesn't need so much.  I tried this immediately after making it:  wonderful.  Five hours later at dinner:  even better.  24 hours after I made it when I was having leftovers for lunch:  still quite good, but the onion flavor was really pronounced.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

WOW!  This is delicious.  Green peas have never been a favorite but I can't get enough of this recipe.  I make it the night before so the flavors have time to meld together and the sauce thickens and clings to the vegetables.  This is definitely a keeper, go to recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I admit to using sunflower seeds (roasted/salted) and less mayo, but I don't believe these changes made a big difference. This is a fantastic recipe! Frozen peas are so nice and crisp, as opposed to nasty old canned.

I love peas. I love pea salads. I love THIS pea salad as much as any I've ever had. After a friend of mine put nuts in her pea salad at a company picnic, I've been looking for something comparable. I don't think I would change anything, except maybe increasing the feta cheese next time.

What a unique salad....perfect for spring time.  I served this as a side dish for Easter dinner and my family and guests LOVED it.  It was so easy to make and I love the fact that it is a "make the day ahead" type recipe.  I cut way back on the onion and mayo as other reviewers' suggested and I'm glad I did.  Super dish!

Excellent recipe!  I've made this many, many times since I first saw the recipe on this site only a month ago.  Using the other reviewers' suggestions, I did cut back on the mayo.  I also leave out the onions as the hubby does not care for them.  Every time I bring this salad to a gathering, people rave about it!  The best part is it is easy and quick to make.

I've made this recipe many times.  I love the balsamic in it. Definately use white balsamic rather than a colored one in order to prevent the salad from becoming an odd color.  I recommend adding chopped water chestnuts for additional texture and bulk. The nuts I add prior to serving in order to prevent sogginess.

This was very delicious. I took off one star because the recipe calls for way too much mayo! Next time I make it, I'll start off with a few tablespoons of mayo first. Other than that, a keeper.

This is the best salad ever! This is my fist time reviewing a recipe and I just had to review this one after I tried it! I had it at a potluck luncheon today at work. It out-shined all the other salads there!!!! Fabulous!

Wow! I was expecting good, but this was excellent. I have a friend who makes pea salad and although I'll never tell her this, this recipe blows it out of the water. I agree with the other reviewers to reduce the amount of mayo to just enough to coat (but that's my preference) and I also added real bacon bits because everything's better with bacon! The basalmic is an amazing touch and with the crunch of the almonds it's absolutely delicious. I even tried it BEFORE adding bacon bits and would still have given it 5 stars so no "tweak rating" going on here... ;)

Nice twist on pea salad.  This was very quick to put together with ingredients I usually have on hand.  I did not measure the mayonnaise, just added enough until the salad was 'wet".  The balsamic vinegar and feta were a nice addition.

The adults liked this - the kids did NOT. I used far less mayo - a heaping tablespoon that was probably closer to 2T. So, husband and I enjoyed and will eat again. I'll offer the kids a salad.

Delicious.
I wanted to make a meal out of this so I added kielbasa sausage.  It turned out very good.   Small cubes of ham might work as well.    But as a side dish the meatless version here is very tasty.

Yum, yum...it's the middle of winter and I'm craving "summer" foods and this is it.  Delicious...I didn't have any green onions so I substituted red onion.  I also used salad dressing in place of mayo because I like the tang.  Will definitely be making this again and again.  (Used a little less than 1/2 cup of salad dressing) Edit 4/30/12: I have used different flavored balsamic vinegars in this and it's even better.  This time I used fig balsamic for a little sweet kick.  I've also been cutting back drastically on the amount of mayo/salad dressing.  I now only used about 2 tablespoons.

Absolutely yummy, I didn't have any feta cheese in, so I added crumbled stilton. The almonds toasted is definately the magic ingredient. My family are all lovers of balsamic vinegar, so this recipe went down a treat. It was quick and easy and goes with any meal. Because my peas were frozen, I simmered them for about 5 mins on the hob, just to thaw them. We served the Balsamic Pea Salad warm and it was gorgeous with a quiche. Served chilled would be equally yummy!

I fed this to my fiance who apparently doesn't like peas and he ate the whole thing.  I wasn't trying to trick him into liking peas, but he tried it and liked it.  As with other reviewers, I used less mayo.

Haven't stopped making this since I ran across the recipe. Much, much better with fresh peas (English peas from Trader Joes).  I lose the almonds, drop the mayo to 1/2 cup, and use fresh peas, and it's perfect. Whenever friends are over the demand a batch!

Made this in an attempt to convince folks who don't think they like peas that they might.  And it worked!  Big hit at our party.  It's a wonderful mix of flavors & textures.  I did toast my almonds in the toaster oven, tho.  Will make my travelling team for dinner!

Dad and I really liked a whole lot.  Chloe not so much, but Liana liked better than cooked peas so that's good.  Would be good for a pot luck.  I also used only about 2 or 3 TBS. of mayo for a recipe calculated to feed 5 but used about 11 oz. of peas, instead of the 8 that the reduced recipe called for.  A do again!

This is wonderful. I made it for a family gathering and everyone loved it. I doubled the recipe for approx. 12 adults. I also used 16oz. of Feta because we all enjoy Feta it did not make the the salad over powering. I also used 3/4 cup of light mayo and 3/4 cup of reg. mayo and let it sit overnight.

I fixed this salad tonight with a few changes.  I cut mayonaise to half cup and also vinegar to one tablespoon. I prepared it about 2 hours before supper and that was just enough for flavors to blend.  Very easy and unsual salad.  I will make this again

I'm generally not a big pea salad fan, but I really enjoyed this recipe, as did my guests.  The feta cheese was a nice addition and really complimented the balsamic in the dressing.  Thanks!

this recipe had no flavor.  the balsamic vinegar gave it a really unappetizing brown color.  a bit expensive to make with the feta cheese and almonds.  i threw the whole batch in the trash.  very dissapointed.

I love this recipe. I always use 1/2 cup light mayo. Make sure you use white balsamic. If you're using mayo with even less fat then the light, like lowfat, you may want to cut back on vinegar.

I replaced the feta with cheddar cheese.  The next time I would use less of mayo and more of the Balsamic vineger.

Just wanted to add that I sometimes throw in some dried cranberries. They add a nice flavor to this, too. Glad so many of you like this!

Way back in my teens I used to be a nanny for a little two year old. Her mom showed me how to make this without the balsomic and feta, she used cubed American.That little girl ate this salad like no one's business. I made it for her all the time. Sometime using canned peas because that was what she wanted for lunch.She loved it with chopped pickles in it too.

I thought this was pretty good.  It seemed like a lot of dressing (mayo), so I doubled the peas and kept the rest the same.  I let it set in the fridge and shortly before serving I sprinkled in some more balsalmic vinegar (I used white instead of regular) because I thought it needed some extra tang.

I really enjoyed this salad, I liked the combination of sweet, tangy and salty from the peas, balsamic and feta respectively.  I chose to make mine the night before and it was very good.  Not everyone responded as positively as I did though, the strong flavors will have to grow on some.

I had forgotten about this recipe until I saw it go by in the review section the other day, so I made half the recipe to try it out.  Upon first combining, the salad tasted like peas with balsamic, feta and green onion with nuts (I used walnuts).  Then I tasted it once it had the chance to meld overnight.  Better -- but the onion was really pronounced.  It still needed something... so I added a sprinkle of real bacon bits which gave it a smoky dimension.  I'll make this again and try it with basil also.  Thanks for the recipe.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used a little less feta and a little less onion. I am glad I did.  The toasted almonds gave fantastic texture! A hit at my last party.  Will definatly make again.

This is wonderful.  Used ham and not nuts, used less mayo like suggested in reviews.  Added chucks of cheddar cheese.  You can really do this up the way you want. This is a keeper.

This was mostly just okay. Didn't fly off the table like I had hoped. I will probably make it for myself again at some point because I liked it, but I doubt I will make it for a large gathering again. The pea salad lovers seemed to love it, although they could have just been being nice, but it turns out there aren't as many pea salad lovers as I had thought. As for modifications, I used both feta and  cheddar cheese cubes, omitted the almonds and threw in some dried cranberries instead. I also think I used more mayo than the other reviewers but lost track of the specific quantity that I used. Since I was making this for an event, I used extra of everything and then just kept tweeking it until I got my preferred taste. Again, it was super super quick and easy, I mostly liked the flavor, but don't expect to be the hit of the parade unless you KNOW everyone there loves pea salad. ;)

My whole family loves peas, but we weren't crazy about this.  I did not add the almonds, so maybe that makes a huge difference? It definitely needs something crunchy, so maybe that was the ingredient that threw it off. The color was a little weird, too. I would recommend slightly less mayo.

Fantastic salad!  Like other cooks, I used white balsamic and the color was beautiful instead of brownish.  I also reduced the amount of mayo to 1/4 cup as suggested.  My changes were to use red onion and add minced fresh mint.  The mint was a fresh pop and worked well with the feta and balsamic.

I'm giving this 4 stars for the original recipe and 5 stars after making a few changes. I followed other reviewers suggestions and added about 1/2 cup of halved cherry tomatoes, 1/4 cup red pepper, and the best suggestion, smoked almonds.  I like a lot of mayo but 1/2 cup plus the balsamic was perfect.  I will certainly use the mayo/balsamic combination for other things.  I brought this to my book club and every bit of it was gone and I was asked to share the recipe.  I made another batch of the salad today just for myself. Thanks for all the great ideas.

Really good! Would make again. Added some more stuff: Doubled the amount of peas, added a bag of fresh spinach, shredded and chopped carrots, chopped cheddar cheese, fresh grated asiago cheese, a few cloves of minced garlic, dash of sugar and a bit more vinegar. (Didn't use feta or almonds cause I didn't have any- was great anyhow!)

I used this recipe hoping for something like the pea salad that my mother in law makes. It was pretty good! I think adding a chopped boiled egg might add something. I also used small cheddar cheese chunks instead of the feta. Good recipe!

An excellent pea salad! The feta and basmalic vinegar give it a unique flavor. I do cut down of the mayo a bit, and to please my husband I microwave the green onions for 30 seconds which cuts the sharp flavor just enough. Slivered almonds work well, too.

Very tasty salad, I agree with using white balsamic for appearance sake.  It did not look appetizing with the dark and sometimes with my family that is half the battle to get them to try a new dish.

This was pretty good, but if I make it again, I'd cut the onion way back--it is really strong and overwhelms the other flavors.  I used toasted pine nuts--I think you could use whatever nuts you have on hand.  I agree with another reviewer that the color is odd after adding the balsamic vinegar, but I think I'd still stick with the dark stuff for the flavor.

This review may sound harsh but, I made this today for lunch. My husband and I did not care for this. All of the ingredients do not blend well together. The feta with the acidity of the vinegar creates a bad odor. And when you add mayonnaise to a hot pan with warm ingredients, it is not good! Mayonnaise is supposed to be cold..never heated. I really did not like this. I will never make this again.

Perhaps this is unfair, but I can't stand green peas.  I have a freezer full and needed some means of using them up so I tried this recipe.  I did not care for this recipe, my poor family did the best they could do in trying to finish this side dish (even the green pea-lover of the family).   If you are trying to do something creative with peas I suggest you find another recipe from this site.

I like all of the ingredients in this recipe (LOVE feta, balsamic vinegar and peas), but something just didn't taste right to me.  My family thought it was okay, but I was expecting spectacular from the reviews.  It wasn't horrible, but I probably won't make this again.

I didn't bother to chop the almond slices --for looks.  Used Miracle Whip since it was Father's Day (next time, Best mayo) and hub prefers that to mayo.  Only had some good shredded Parmesan.  In spite of the changes, this is an EXCELLENT pea salad, better than the other ones I have used.  I'll be sure to use feta next time as we both love it.  Thanks for such an easy keeper!

This recipe is WONDERFUL.  My hubby ate the leftovers for breakfast!  I skipped the almonds because my son is allergic to nuts and it was still fantastic!

I don't like peas, but my family does and they wanted me to fix them more often. This recipe is a WINNER! I LOVE this recipe, and couldn't get enough of it. And my family loved it as well. It is definitely a keeper.

I love peas and who would have thought of PEA salad??  I agree with all the YUMS out there - used a little less mayo as most suggested and I agree.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers tonite!!!  Thanks submitter!

This was really good.  I made it twice, the first time in a single batch, the second time a double batch.   The double batch was a little to liquidy, so the next time I make a double batch I will cut back on the mayo / balsamic.  This was really good.
