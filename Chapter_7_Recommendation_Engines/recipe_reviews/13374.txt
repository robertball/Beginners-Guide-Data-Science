Good with jazz.

This was a great base recipe!
When preparing it I added a pinch of basil, cinnamon, and nutmeg for the sweet tooth and 1 can green chiles and a pinch of cayenne for spice.  For added creamy I used 2 tbsp of sour cream and a half stick of butter.  End result: soup to write home about.  :)

Over all I enjoyed this recipe.  My 10yr old son and I made it for his 4th grade class we made a few changes, I added 1/2 lb of crisp bacon, I used shoe peg corn. I also added small diced carrots one time and you can also use sausage to make it a sausage corn chowder.  I crisped the bacon first then sauteed the onions in the bacon grease.

As other reviewers have said, this is a great base.  My revisions:
1 - I used cream instead of milk.  I'll probably use half&half next time.  Also, I drained the potatoes to get all the water out.  It gave it great texture.
2 - I didn't use canned corn.  I used corn that I had frozen from last summer.  
3 - Salt & Pepper. I added at least a Tablespoon of ground black pepper.
4 - Frank's RedHot!  Perfectly blended with these ingredients & gave it a nice kick.
Thank you for a good base recipe that is easy to maniuplate to still get a great chowder!

Thought I could help this recipe by adding garlic and hot peppers and sprinkling with cheddar cheese.  Nope, not so much it was still really, really bland.  It needs to be richer, maybe 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk. I don't think I will bother as there many other better soup recipes ot there.

Awesome base, but I added garlic to the beef and the onions and used heavy cream and 1 percent milk. Oh and bacon. It was amazing after that. So easy to make and its an easy recipe that I usually have all the ingredients.

Super Bland, easy to make, just needs a lot of flavor, would be easier to start with a different base and make stew or soup.

This recipe had some issues, all of which can be fixed.  For flavor, we will try chicken broth to cook the potatoes instead of water.  The potatoes did not cook when the recipe doubled - we will try microwave or boiling water.  For thickening, we will try flour or cornstarch slurry.  Until then, only three stars.

This chowder was EXTREMELY BLAND.  I added 5 beef boullion cubes hoping to give it some flavor but it didn't help that much.  If you attempt to try this recipe anyway, I would recommend frying up some bacon (until crisp) and adding it.  That might make a big difference.

I thought this was a fantastic recipe!  I'm currently living in a different country and could not find creamed corn in the grocery store, so I substituted by adding extra milk, a teaspoon or so of sugar, and a teaspoon or so of flour.  I also doubled the amount of whole kernel corn to make up for the lack of creamed.

hearty but very very bland.  not sweet enough.  not salty enough.  maybe add garlic to the saute to give the beef a little kick of spice.

Super yummy. I used red potatoes and added sour cream while the soup was simmering. Added a lot more spices to it like garlic and extra onions due to reviews saying it was bland. My husband, teen and 8 year old loved it. Got my picky 7 year old to take a couple bites, but he still gagged. That boy is way too picky. I wish he would eat something! We added cheese on top when dished in bowls. Very yummy. Will make again. My husband keeps requesting it.

I used left over rib eye steak and Baked taters and corn off the cob.  then I added some left over mushroom sauce.  to spice it up a bit I saute`d some green and yellow bell pepper with fresh garlic and ginger.  top that off with some home made Jamaican hot sauce (just a few drops).  as others say .....a good base.  I'm thinking you could also add some Percorino ramano for some more pizzaz.

it was pretty good as is but much better when I added a pinch of minced garlic to the beef and onions.  And I used half and half instead of milk.

I didn't have all of the ingredients to this recipe, so I sort of used the bones as a guide, and made the MOST delicious chowder.  I wish I could rate this recipe based off the recipe alone, but maybe another time.  I just wanted to say thanks.  I found it to be a life saving guide to a very delicious meal. :)

This was very easy to make and even better after I added about a half cup of sour cream and 4tbls. of butter!  I also used chipotle corn and it gave it a little kick, as well as fingerling potatoes, leaving the skin on! I agree, it is a great base soup! You can adjust the recipe to suit your own taste!

VERY bland. If I tried this again, it would be with some major alterations.
