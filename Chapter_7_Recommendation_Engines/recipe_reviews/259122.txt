Made as written and these turned out good. I'll admit that I did not love the creamy green onion sauce. It has a dominant sour cream taste to it and I do not care for sour cream. My husband on the other hand does like sour cream and enjoyed these. If you like sour cream on your potatoes then I really recommend giving this a try. I also recommend adding more green onion so that the flavor of them comes out more.

Very good! The flavors were definitely great, but I had to make quite a few adjustments to time since it was all over the place. 1 hr is not enough time to cook this as I needed 1 hr and 45 minutes. Furthermore, I would salt the potatoes when adding pepper as it was not salty enough. Broiling it for 3 minutes should be enough, otherwise it'd turn into a blackened mess. But with these adjustments, it should be reallllly good.
