I made five BBQ sauces today to get a head start on the 40 pound whole hog I will be fixing for Thanksgiving and I've got to say that this one was the best hands down. None of the sauces I made were what I would call a traditional BBQ sauce  and this one really stood out in terms of flavor. It was great right out of the mixing bowl but I am anxious to see how good it got after it sat a few days. This would be great on brisket or roast beef!

Very easy, very tasty. I could not find extra hot horseradish and didn't measure the vinegar, which dominated a bit, so I will be more cautious with that next time. Also, it goes a long way, so I might make less.

This was good, but not great, as a tangy dressing for house salad. It really saved some dry and tasteless pork ribs from another recipe. It was also nice as a dip with pita bread.

Easy to make, tastes great.  Great for marinating, basting, and garnishing after cooked.  Marinated chicken thighs and a thick cut pork chop; flavors were incredible.  Will do this next for BBQ salmon and Ribs.

I didn't have a lemon so I used the only lime I had. I couldn't find "extra hot" horseradish so I made do with what Food Lion had. Next year it'll be home grown. That being said, I'm excited for Memorial Day weekend when I'm doing about 20 pounds of pulled pork. Freshly made this has a really good flavor that should get better by Saturday. With the ratio of spice, this is actually milder than I thought it would be but that means more people will enjoy it. There's a little pleasant heat at the end that stays awhile. 

I will make this again.

Wow! Great Alabama White Sauce. I made 1/2 a batth in case I didn't like it. I learned two things...1) a couple reviewers said to judge the taste the next day. They were spot on. There is a big difference in flavor. 2) I used half the amount of vinegar called for. For 1/2 a batch I used 2 tablespoons. Wait and taste next day to compare. This was a matter of taste for me.
This sauce is good on so many things. I may even try it on a flip flop.
Thanks for the recipe!

How do I love this?  Let me count the ways!!!  I originally made it for Pulled Pork and it was wonderful on that. But it's also great as a dip for French Fries and makes an outstanding Cole slaw dressing to serve with Brats or hotdogs. It's a nice sauce to use on steamed cabbage as well. If you like hot and spicy, this sauce is very versatile. But be warned, it's not for the faint of heart!!!

This is an awesome recipe.  Everyone must do this and I only use skin-on thighs, but everyone loves it and asks for it often.  This is a big party hit and always set aside the sauce for extra dipping.

I made this for a family BBQ and it turned out great!  Our guests enjoyed the sauce on some smoked chicken and ribs.  The next time I prepare the sauce, I will add a bit more cayenne and horseradish to increase the flavor a bit.  Overall, great sauce!

Hubby loved it and uses it on so many things. Last night we even put it on corn on the cob. I will use a bit less vinegar next time per my taste.

Delicious!! Tip: make it the night before you are planning on eating. I made this, tasted it and almost threw it out! My husband suggested letting it sit overnight and trying it the next day. I am really happy I listened to him! We could literally drink this sauce it was so good!

Tastes almost exactly likes the Newks white barbecue sauce! It’s really good, although I would do half the amount of Mustard. I made 6 servings so I could share with my family. I’m making chicken bacon sandwiches with white barbecue sauce. 10/10 would recommend.

Very good base.  It needs less vinegar in my opinion and more cayenne pepper.  Also added extra garlic and smoked paprika.  Chef John you rock!!!!!

Used chipotle in place of Cayenne and spicy brown in place of yellow mustard. Very good! Will try it as a marinade as well as a salad dressing. This time the sauce was used on rather bland braised short ribs.

This stuff is awesome!!!!!.   Made 1/2 recipe used on hot wings first  as dipping sauce,  then added some to basic cole slaw ,  going to use the rest as a sauce for roast beef instead of au jou or horseradish.   Add this to your recipe list.

We made Boston butts and chicken for a fundraiser. Needed white sauce, which I've never made before. Wow! This was great. Also added to my slaw but added celery seed and a tad bit of sugar. This is a keeper and my husband loves it too!

Absolutely delicious! I used it as a serving sauce with roast chicken. Fantastic. Only change was substituting red wine vinegar since i didn’t have any apple cider vinegar. This would be good with any kind of chicken (bbq smoked, grilled, roasted, fried.....).

I have to admit that when I first read the recipe I was a little worried because I am not a fan of horseradish.  It turned out great -none of that burning-in-your-nose sensation that I usually get from horseradish.  Definitely will be making this again.   I did make some minor changes to accommodate what I had on hand:
1.  Only had regular horseradish so I ended up doubling the amount.
2.  Used Sriracha instead of Cayenne Pepper.
3.  Added a couple of tablespoons of honey.
