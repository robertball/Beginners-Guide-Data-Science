I saw the beautiful photo of this sandwich this morning and had everything in stock to make it. I made one for DH and one for me. His didn't turn out too well since the cheddar cheese mixture was really globby and I couldn't get it to soak into the bread and had to sort of spread the cheese on. But the second time I didn't add the full one cup of cheese to the butter. maybe a wee bit over a half cup, and used Colby Jack instead of Cheddar. It melted much better than the cheddar did. Once it reached a well mixed taffy like texture I removed from the heat and put my thick slice of white bread on it and sort of soaked the mix in it like a sponge, then quickly removed it to the fry pan already heated on medium and ready, threw on the ham slices and then soaked up the rest of the cheese mixture with second piece of bread moving it and dabbing it until no mixture was left. Timing seems to be the key and the longer you wait the cheese mix starts to gob up. You may also want to start your egg while cooking the sandwich, or the sandwich gets pretty cool waiting for the egg. I liked the taste of the crusty cheese bread and the oozing egg yolk on top. Was a very nice breakfast treat. Just have everything out and ready and be prepared to have a bit of clean-up. But tasted very good and worth the extra work. My husband loved his even though it wasn't exactly pretty.

Difficult to rate, as I'm uncertain at what consistency the melted butter/cheese is to be at to not burn, but make it easy to coat the bread. So I expect that my attempt was more a cobbling of the ingredients than the complete blending and presentation I would imagine is involved in a French treat.

This was oh so good! I swear my taste buds were singing the hallelujah chorus. This was so quick and easy to make and very filling. The only thing I did differently was to thinly slice the cheddar cheese since 1) I wasn't keen to have another item - the grater - to clean up. Lol and 2) I saw some persons had issues with getting the shredded cheese to melt properly. It came out perfectly! I feel a little guilty about the cholesterol content of this meal but I'll get over it. Lol

Made it for Christmas breakfast. Yummy! We used french bread and cut them into thick slices and they are so good! I melted my cheese over a make-shift double boiler (a glass container over simmering water in a saucepan) as I was afraid that the cheese might stick to the pan. Took a while for the cheese to melt, but it did eventually. Dipped the bread into the cheese (had to spread the cheese a little) and quickly put it on the already heated skillet. Great breakfast for special occasions as the colours of this sandwich is bright and beautiful!

This was fun, easy and tasty- my whole family agreed.  I threw several different cheeses into my saucepan (mild white English cheddar, yellow cheddar and some monteray jack).  It was interesting how, at one point, the cheese was almost a taffy consistency.  Once you reach that point, you're almost there.  This is very rich, and definitely not diet food.  It is super yummy though.  Thanks, Alyssa!

I would have rated this higher but I had a lot of difficulty getting the cheese to a proper consistency. I ended up thinning it out with a bit of milk but I still had to kind of spread it on. I think maybe using a proper melting cheese would improve this a lot. Other then that though it was quite good, everyone in my family (including the kids!) enjoyed it.

Turned out good, but the part about mixing the cheese and melted butter in the pan was bunk. Had it on med temp and the cheese burned to quickly and got stuck to the first slice of bread for my mother's croque madame. So I did an alternative by spreading butter on both slices for mine one side at a time, placed the shredded cheese, and fried each side until golden brown. So much easier. But I digress, for something that's considered a snack in France... turned out to be a very good delicacy to be made hopefully throughout parts of the world. To any who doesn't have allergies to meat or dairy should give this a try.
