I read the recipe and something looked wrong.  Here's what I did and it turned out yummy.  Decrease the butter to 1/2 c. and I increased the cocoa and used tablespoons instead of teaspoons.  With 1/2 c butter the ratio between butter, sugar and milk is what starts my regular fudge recipe.  But you must decrease the butter.

These were good and easy to make. I did decrease the butter to 1/2 cup and increased the cocoa powder to 5 TBSP instead of tsp. Thanks for the tip from another review...Would absolutely recommend these yummy treats!

I didn't care for these myself. They didn't come out for me...maybe I did something wrong but they wouldn't harden and I even left them overnight...

Excellent recipe...only thing I changed was the cocoa I prefer the "special dark" I think it gives it an enhanced chocolate taste.

Wish I'd read the reviews before going to the kitchen. Not a great texture to these cookies. Not sure what happened but the chocolate pooled around the bottom of the cookie leaving a dry pile of oats & coconut on top.

I won't make this version of no bake again. They formed together ok but I could taste the milk which made them taste sour. Maybe not enough choc. was added.

They fell apart a lot and many people agreed and said that they were too sweet. I couldn't taste the chocolate either. I would have appreciated at temperature at which to boil the sugar so the right consistency could be reached.

This was the first time for me to make these. My mother made them a lot when I was young and I loved them. I'm definitely going to cut the amount of butter in half. Way too much buttery taste! Also the cocoa mixture needs to boil more than 2 minutes. I followed the recipe according to these instructions and they were still gooey. I wish I had read the reviews first. My fault.

Easy and a nice candy type cookie. You can not taste the oats so you don't even know there are any in there. Has a fudge type yumminess.

These are pretty tasty and so easy to make. So easy it is more time consuming to clean up than to make lol. I did the 5tbsp and less butter but I ended up using regular milk b/c my evaporated milk expired (and didn't realize until I started making this). My own version was I added 3 tbsp of peanut butter and added 100 grams of chopped peanuts. Delcious. I am sure I will make again.

This recipe should read "5 Tbs unsweetened cocoa powder " not teaspoons. If you use 5 Tbs the recipe turns out very good. If you use only 5 teaspoons they don't set up and they are not very chocolatey.

this is a good recipe. I used regular rolled oats and I think it would probably have been better with the quick cooking or 2 minute variety. Also reading the reviews certainly helped. I used the 1/2 cup butter and 5 tbsp of cocoa.

I was sooooo looking forward to making these cookies from my childhood days. I read the recipe I always knew what was in them but wasn't sure of amounts. So I read the reviews and followed the recipe from the lady who said she was making these for 50 years and makes them every week. I cut the butter to half (like so many reviewers said to do) and followed her instructions to the letter. Terrible. I have a crumbly mess. They won't stick together at all. I'll keep looking.
