Thank you so much for posting this recipe. It is my new favorite cookie with a few changes.  I only used half the butter (6 Tbs instead of 12 Tbs).  For the flour, I used a combination of almond meal, ground flax seed, and whole wheat instead of all purpose. I left out the walnuts and threw in some chocolate chips.  It is good with chocolate chips, but the bananas make it sweet enough that it would be great with out the chocolate, too.   I just gave my husband one and he LOVED it.  Cutting back our sugar intake isn't going be so bad after all!

I think the substitution of applesauce for the butter works great.  I also added the chocolate chips and used wholewheat flour.  Turned out great.

This cookie doesn't spread out, the way you plunk it on the sheet is the way it comes out. I've been subbing no sugar applesauce for the butter and adding chocolate chips. They turn out great!

It does not matter these cookies do not expand, or they are brown in color (that is normal for bananas!).  These cookies ROCK!  I made them four times in one week and they were just as awesome each time.  I did end up decreasing the amount of butter but at least 25 percent and it did not compromise the recipe.

It is delicious, but the texture turned out more like a scone.  This is the only reason I gave four stars.  I think sugar gives cookies the crunch, so without it they become something else.  I do think we often can do away with sugar.  Next time I will make them as muffins or drop scones.

Was hoping for more flavor, but most of the taste seemed to come from the butter.  I didn't like them as a stand-alone food-- but they weren't terrible under some ice cream.

I wasn't necessarily looking for a no sugar cookie, but wanted something lower in fat or calories. I am glad I found this recipe. I made 2 slight changes. I used 1/2C butter and added 1/2C semi sweet chocolat chips. I am definitely glad I added the chocolate chips because without them they would have been a tad bland. I also have a major sweet tooth so that's why I added them.  They were nice and soft and cake like in texture. I will definitely make these again and when I do I will probably add even more cinnamon just because I like a stronger cinnamon taste.

These were really good!  I added a couple packets of Splenda.  They don't look so good after a couple of days, though.  The banana turns the cookies kinda brown.  Luckily they usually don't last more than a day or two at my house :)

In my constant quest to find low sugar desserts to manage my hypoglycemia, this fit the bill!  Like another reviewer, I used whole wheat flour.  I always bake with egg substitute, and I added the equivalent of about two eggs plus a teaspoon of olive oil to offset the extra density from the whole wheat flour.  Also I added a few packets of Splenda.  Great recipe - I might start using this as my new base for other types of cookies!  Thank you!

These are the best sugar free cookies I have made.  My bananas were black ripe so I'm sure that helped.  I did add 1/4 cup of chocolate chips, 1/4 cup of coconut and left out the nutmeg.  I will make these again and will add only 1/4 cup of sugar to see how much better they are.

I made these last night and was disappointed in how they turned out. I experimanted by baking 3 different types. The first pan I followed the recipe exactly, other than when I was mixing it up, I ground the oats in the food processer for a finer consistency.  This pan had no real cookie flavor for us.  I then decided to add 1/4 cup of raisins to the cookie dough to see if that would help. The next pan I baked was better with the raisins. I still had a little bit of the dough left so I decided to add in 2 packets of splenda and see how that helped. These cookies were much better! My husband and I both liked these. I know some people don't like splenda but we use it in place of sugar often.  The cookies don't flatten out while baking so you have little half-balls, don't worry about leaving much space between them on the cookie sheet.  Not sure if I'll ever try these again but if I do I think I'd try adding in some cocoa along with splenda, this could be a good base to work from.

For being a sugarless cookie, it's not bad.  My daughter initially disliked these, but they grow on you.  I added a can of finely chopped pears.  I think crushed pineapple might be good to try in these, too.

These are some of the BEST cookies I've ever had! I also used half butter half applesauce (6 TBS butter 6 TBS applesauce) and I used a Tablespoon of soy flour and they have the most delicious, moist texture! I leave the walnuts out but I'm sure they'd be wonderful. I've made these lots of times and I'll continue to do so. SO GOOD!!

I can't even remember how much I adjusted this, but having this as a starting point was great. They turned out pretty tasty and the idea alone is worth four stars. My husband likened them to really good bread. Some people said scones, but after he said that I realized that they really do taste like a cakey banana bread. These are the switches I can remember (I know some of them add to the sugar content, but I just liked the idea that it was all fruit and no refined sugar or sweetener like honey or maple syrup): 1/2 C butter with 1 1/2 cup ground flax for the fat and what ended up being 1 cup of applesauce (1/2 initially & half when the batter was too thick from the flax) in place of the egg. I had read not to replace egg with applesauce in drop cookies because it would make them spread too much, so since I read they didn't spread at all, I thought I would use that flaw to my advantage--it didn't work. They still stayed the shape they were plopped in. I also ommited the walnuts and added a diced fresh peach (weird but good). Thanks for sharing; it was a fun experiment.

I made the cookies according to the recipe.  I was actually surpised how much better they tasted than the batter.  They do not really taste like a sweet cookie, more like a banana biscuit, but with the cake texture.  I`ll make them again for my diabetic husband, so much healthier than artifical sweetners!

I was tired of banana breads and muffins and decided to try these out.  They're OK...like most reviewers said, more like scones than cookies but tasty enough.  Nothing spectacular though...

I have been making this cookie for years and love it. The only change I make is often leaving out the oatmeal and especially the walnuts, although they make the cookies especially rich. It is a favorite with coffee. My brother loves them and he's a sugarholic. I think he and our mother can somehow taste how good they are for them. Oh, and I often use whole wheat flour.

I added a bit of Stevia and it helped cover how bland it was. These are delicious and I love the texture. The only thing I didn't like was that the dough had to sit for an hour, therefor not making them an easy bake.

I changed the recipe as follows:  Did not chill the dough, baked when finished.  Used only 1/2 C butter, used 1/2 C whole wheat flour + 1 cup all-purpose flour, used only 1/2 C rolled oats, added chocolate chips and 2 level teaspoons of sugar.  Added a dash of milk.  They do come out like scones and don't spread much, which is fine, but despite some sugar and chocolate, they are still not tasty/sweet at all.  They also came out too dry, so cutting back on the butter was not a good idea.  I will finish eating these (they're okay) but keep looking for the perfect low fat, low sugar recipe.

These cookies were easy to make but I have to say the taste would be improved by adding sugar.  I wasn't a big fan but my boyfriend (who is very sensitive to sugar) loved them.  I substituted margarine for butter so think we lost a little of the taste there.  Next time I'll try adding another banana and maybe a little agarve.

After reading reviews, I was prepared to make adjustments.  Good base cookie but needs more taste of banana or sugar or rasins or something. Kids liked with 2 pks of splenda and some rasins, and well, they are the reason why I bake.

I made significant changes to this recipe. I melted 2 oz. unsweetened chocolate with 1/2 cup butter. I added about 1/2 c. peanut butter and about 3/4 cup raisins and 2 eggs instead of 1. I also used almond flour instead of the flour, but they were so wet I added 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour. I skipped the walnuts. They turned out not too sweet but quite enjoyable. Kind of cakey because of the extra egg I think. I like them and might make them again. I don't think I'd change much if I do.

We found this bland, dry and not a very nice texture. The main flavor was oats, wholemeal flour and the bicarb of soda, even though they smelt like banana. I followed the recipe exactly.

I added raisins. It tastes more like a scone than a cookie. The texture is light and fluffy.

Just ok. My 4 year old daughter ate them but my 2 year old spit them out. I did everything exactly as stated with the exception of adding raisins.

Very easy and moist, but not nearly sweet enough to satisfy.  I cheated and added 1 tblsp of molasses, 1 tblsp of maple syrup and 1 tblsp of brown sugar- which helped a lot.
I also subbed half of the butter for canola oil.  It still needs something like coconut or mini chocolate chips.

Pleasantly surprised with how good they taste! Would recommend making sure your butter/margarine is softened (room temperature).

If you are not expecting them to actually taste like cookies they are not bad for a healthier alternative.
I used 3/4 cup of Whole wheat flour and half cup white flour. 
Next time I may reduce some of the earth balance margarine for applesauce and maybe use a flax egg to make it vegan. I added a handful of raisins.

Made these yesterday & they are better today. For a person who is sugar free, these are a nice treat. For my sugaraholic 18 year old son, they were; "Bland and Gross!"  I added a 1/2 cup of "no sugar added" applesauce & mixed that with the oats for about 45 minutes to give them more moisture & I had three black Bananas & used all three. I also added two packets of Splenda, per other reviews. I didn't use any nuts due to allergies. These remind me of a protein bar. I thought they were tasty & mine came out moist! I baked them for nine minutes, on parchment paper, at 350 in my Convection Oven. It runs hot. My two DIL's both liked them. I think if you wanted more sweetness, you could add dried fruit. I'm thinking of grating carrots, extra fine, & adding that next time! Pumpkin Spice or Apple Pie Spice would be great in these. Chopped Apples would be a great addition too. Five stars for a great base! The extra banana made the batter thinner, but these cookies still don't spread out. For a sugar free cookie, really good! Thanks for the recipe!

I did make them as a dessert when  my son and daughter-in-law came to dinner one night. She prefers that type of dessert and loved them. The rest of us enjoyed them also but I'd suggest having a second dessert  at the ready, as I did, for those who count on something a bit sweeter. 
I gave it a five because it has excellent taste for a sugarless cookie

Like other reviewers, I made some adjustments:
-I used 1 cup white whole wheat flour, 1/4 almond meal, 1/4 cup flaxseed meal.
-Instead of butter I used 1/2 cup of coconut oil (I like the coconut aroma it gives to baked goods)
-I added 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips.
-Made me 28 cookies by rounded tablespoons. And i did NOT chill the batter

I've never been able to make cookies without sugar and these are awesome. I'll be making them again, and again! :)
