Made this from Bobs Gluten Free Flour and it was really good. It can appear runny when first mixes but just pour it into your pizza pan and it will turn into a nice crust.

This recipe was a great start- and super easy too, but to get it a little crispier I've since tweaked it a little.  I use half garbanzo bean flour and have rice, as well as adding an extra tablespoon of oil.  Making two small crusts instead of one large one also helps.  I've come to like this even better than 'regular' pizza!

Tip learned from another recipe:  let batter rest for at least 30 minutes before using

Good flavor, but the recipe could really use some clarification. I had no idea what size of pan to use, so I guessed and used an 8x8 glass dish. The crust was pretty thick and a little doughy.  Next time, I would try something bigger.  Also, it would be nice to have clear directions about how to cook it once the toppings are actually on there.

I used a gluten free flour and extra virgin olive oil. The crust turned out great!!

Really good recipe! I will make again and add some herbs to the batter.  I was worried that I forgot to preheat my cast iron skillet and that the crust would stick, but it still turned out ok. I love that it's quick and easy.

I didn't add any garlic to the crust but instead added some thyme, oregano and garlic powder and cooked in a large oven proof casserole pan. I topped with eggplant, dried cranberries, mushrooms and parm cheese. Next time I think I would add carmelized onions. This was actually quite tasty and would definitely make again!!

This was better than some pizza parlor gluten-free crusts I've had. It could be a little crisper on the bottom, and I'll add more salt next time, but other than that, it's the closest I've found to gluten pizza dough in terms of texture. I used a 9 x 13 glass baking dish and it didn't quite fill the bottom, but this recipe is easy enough to adjust. I baked the loaded pizza on a cookie sheet, but next time I'll try it directly on the rack to see if that gives it a crisper bottom.

It tasted okay. The texture was extremely crumbly and it burned very easily

it was GREAT!  I added Italian seasoning and garlic powder.  The texture was a little grainy, but my gluten loving 9 year old said it was delicious.
