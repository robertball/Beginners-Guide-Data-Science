Yum, James. :)   Good recipe with minimal changes. Instead of draining the marinated artichoke hearts liquid, I used it all up in addition to the evoo. I had a bunch of grape tomatoes, so I cut them all in half, rubbed with a wee bit of evoo, sprinkled a bit of salt on them and roasted them for a few minutes. It really brought a nice sweetness with their natural sugars. I also chopped some Kalamata olives which bring that great savory/salty bite. This was really good James!

The only thing I did different was to use fusilli rather than farfalle because that is what I had on hand and needed to use up (sorry!).  This was very tasty.  I think that the next time I will grind some of the walnuts fine and then leave some chopped.  I highly recommend using freshly grated pecorino romano cheese.  This was pretty much cool by the time I served it, and all I know is that hubby wanted more----a sure sign of a keeper in this household.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I used chopped pistachio nuts instead (having no walnuts). I cut down a little on the olive oil and lemon juice since I used the marinade from the artichoke hearts. Chopped fresh tomato or tuna or a little cooked chicken can be added as well. Thank you for this teriffic recipe James!

Pretty much just followed the recipe as is, though I did add some grilled chicken (which I marinated in the juice from the artichokes).  And I used pecorino romano cheese instead of parmesan because that's what I had on hand!  Really good and even my very picky-eater kid like it!

I have to admit that I don't usually use recipes from this site that have less than 40 reviews because I'm afraid of wasting food and more often than not when I follow a recipe exactly without using the changes that other reviewers have suggested, I'm usually very disappointed with the results. But, I had all of the ingredients for this recipe so I decided to give it a go because if it wasn't good then I was only really wasting a box of pasta and some artichokes. I'm SO happy I tried this because it is delicious! I will absolutely save this recipe and make it often. Thank you for sharing, James!

Try using fresh basil & oregano. Try fresh chives or pine nuts instead of walnuts.

I decided to try this because I had all the ingredients and it looked simple and quick to prepare on a week night. I am so glad I did! It was a great side dish for my grilled chicken breasts. Next time I will add some grape tomatoes and fresh broccoli florets..maybe even green pepper strips.

I pretty much altered this entire recipe, but it was so delicious! I used a whole box of bow tie pasta, 24oz of marinated artichoke hearts, juice of 1 1/2 lemons, and added Aidells chicken apple sausage (artichoke garlic), 2 hot house tomatoes, and about 12 white mushrooms (sliced). I also poured half of the marinating liquid from the artichokes onto the cooked pasta before adding everything else. Will definitely make this again!

This is very good. I followed the recipe as stated. The dear wife had some for lunch and wanted some again for supper. It should be even better tomorrow after all of the flavors have had chance to meld. Thanks for the great recipe  Chairman James.

This is a nice light & lemony pasta. I used pistachios because I didn't have any walnuts. I also added some garlic. I found that it didn't need as much lemon as it called for. I can't wait to try it with walnuts and might add some crumbled goat cheese next time. It's a keeper for sure!

I enjoyed this super easy dinner.  I didn't have the marinated artichokes so I used an 8.5 oz can of  whole artichoke hearts which I sliced in half and pan fried with three cloves of garlic minced  and olive oil.  I cooked it slowly until it browned.  I followed the rest of the recipe except I didn't add the cheese (Vegan) and I only did half a pound of pasta.   Yumm.  Thanks for a great simple dinner.

We've made this several times with some changes. (Skip walnuts, add cherry tomatoes, use fresh herbs when we have them).  It's a nice, light alternative to red sauce or Alfredo.

VERY, very good! What a nice change from heavy cream pasta sauces. Delightful. I made it with tortellini, and I'll probably use a portion of the artichoke marinade next time, but that's it! Thanks Chairman James!

Delicious!  Made recipe with almost everything but substituted chopped roasted sunflower seeds, chopped green onions and Kalamata olives.  Also added extra grated Parmesan cheese.  Got rave reviews from my husband!
