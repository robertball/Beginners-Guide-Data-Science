Super easy and delicious!  I substituted the red onion for green and halved the evoo and it turned out amazing.  Great crunch factor and love the bite of the vinegar!

I'm giving this five-stars even though I had to change one of the ingredients. I had to use green onions instead of red, and believe me, it was missed. This salad is awesome and super easy. I baked my brown rice in the oven (see recipe here on AR) and added in some shredded carrot and diced sun-dried tomatoes. If you are not vegan, add some hard boiled eggs or tuna and you won't be sorry. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing.

This was not bad. Aesthetically it's not too snazzy, but as a side it would be worth making.

Delicious! Replaced the EVOO with about 2 tbsp pesto, and I added a chopped apple.
