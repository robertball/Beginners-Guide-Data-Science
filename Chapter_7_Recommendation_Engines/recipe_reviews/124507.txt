Absolutely wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly - except I didn't have fresh blackberries so I rinsed and slightly thawed a frozen berry assortment to use instead.  This was delicious and easy!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

This is wounderful. I put one extra apple in it. [just for good measure] I didn't have any corn starch left, so I used 1/4 c. of flour, and I also put a 1/2 tsp. each of cinnamon and nutmeg.Ummm!

Mine turned a little soupy, and I felt it a little bit lacking. Still tasted good, but not great. I may try again with a crumble topping, and add some cinnamon. It has potential to be a really great pie, but I think I may have to doctor it up a bit.

I made this for a large family get-together. Used 6 Granny Smith apples on this (medium) and 600 g (about 3 pints) of blackberries -- but I had to bake it in a casserole dish (no pie pan). It turned out amazing. I added a little cinnamon, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. So delicious!! Not even any leftoever crumbs in the dish after my family got done with it.

I have 24 pints of blackberries in the freezer and some Cameo apples needing attention so I was looking for a recipe to use both.  This worked like a charm.  I didn't bother with the top crust.  I used a crumb topping instead.  Great pie!

Thanks so much for this recipe, it is so easy and tasty! This was my first pie to make EVER, and it was amazing! I didn't have any blackberries on hand, so I just used all (red) apples and some extra sugar and cinnamon.  And don't forget the vanilla ice cream!  It turned out so delicious, and the added bonus was my boyfriend was thoroughly impressed!  I'm actually making another one today for the 4th, but this time, I'm using half apples and half peaches!

I love blackberry and apple pie! It's the perfect summer fruit pie. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream.

This was absolutely delicious.  I had some gala apples (which are not really great for pie) and some blackberries that I needed to use.  The pie was wonderful and I can only imagine how good it will be with the right apples.  I forgot the last step of sprinkling the crust with sugar but I didnâ€™t miss it.  I served this with some vanilla ice cream and it was a huge hit.

Very YUMMY!  It was a huge hit at Christmas, I doubled it and put it in a 9x13 baker, came out perfect.  I did sprinkle cinnamon/sugar over the berries before I put the pie topper on, it just adds a nice flavor.

My husband really enjoyed this, but I think I'd have liked it better as an all apple or all blackberry pie. The combination of the two without any spices didn't really do it for me. A few changes I'd make if I made it again: Use 3 TB of cornstarch because you lose at least one to wetness in the bowl when mixing; add cinnamon and vanilla (in my case probably dry cinnamon and vanilla sugar, but not everyone has vanilla sugar on hand) somehow. Otherwise I thought this came out really pretty and very tasty aside from the points I already mentioned, which were not noticed by anyone but me. Thanks for sharing!

This is an excellent recipe.  The blackberries create a nice twist for the standard apple pie.  My father doesn't let me make any other kind of pie anymore.

Thought it was a good pie, but just couldn't taste the apples, only the blackberries.  Was very good, but may add more apples next time.

Very yummy.  Mine came out quite soupy, though - not sure why.  I did put in the cornstarch.  Could a regular top crust vs the lattice account for this??

Extremely delicious! My whole family gobbled it up the same night I made it. I used green granny-smith apples which offset the sweetness of the blackberries perfectly.

This pie was great!  Took it to a potluck and everyone loved it!  I accidentally forgot to dot with butter but we never even noticed.  I used granny smith apples and they were perfect.
