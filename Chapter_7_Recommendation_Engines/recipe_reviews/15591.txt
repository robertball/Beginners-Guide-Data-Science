Tastes very much like pumpkin pie.  I wish I had followed the suggestion to bake in a 9x13 pan rather than a jelly roll pan because I think I would prefer them "deeper."  For those who do not have pumpkin pie spice, here is how to make the 4 teaspoons called for in this recipe:  Mix together 2 t. cinnamon, 1 t. ginger, 1/2 t. allspice and 1/2 t. nutmeg.

great recipe. i used a 9x13 pan and yellow cake mix instead of pound cake and it was absolutely wonderful. made it for work and everyone asked for the recipe. definetly tastes more like pumpkin pie than cheesecake but i think its better than pumpkin pie because its much creamier. we have a winner!!!

I made this twice this week for gatherings. Very good recipe. I changed it the second time. I added a ginger snap crust and added a layer of cheese cake(recipe for chescake cups)then the pumpkin on top and baked until a tooth pick came clean. Perfect!!! I will only make this with the layer of cheesecake from now on.

Very good! I didn't think they were too sweet, loved the pumpkin flavor and the spicing was very good (I used the recommended by Mama Cass and added just a pinch of clove), I also added a tsp of vanilla to the pumpkin mix because I don't bake anything sweet without vanilla. I also substituted low fat cream cheese with no problems to cut a little of the fat, and used a 9X13 pan, and baked for 50 minutes, it turned out perfectly. I would recommend spraying the heck out of the pan though, because I had a hard time getting them out of the pan (and I used well-seasoned stoneware, which normally nothing sticks to).

Delicious and easy dish everyone loved it. you can't go wrong unless you did what I did the second time making them, I accidently used pumpkin PIE mix instead of pumpkin puree. still tasted good but definitely wasn't the same:-)

I made this recently for my husband, who really loves pumpkin pie (I'm not personally a big pumpkin pie fan). He absolutely loved it, and said it's the best dessert he's ever eaten. The next day it was served with whipped cream at a family gathering, and everyone there loved it. I tried it and also thought it was great, even though I don't generally care for pumpkin pie. Before making it, I read some of the other comments that indicated the final product was not really very "cheesecake-like". I wanted to make something basically like a pumpkin-pie flavoured cheesecake, so I made a few changes to the recipe, and it turned out exactly like I wanted. I added an extra package of cream cheese (I used two 250g packages) and an extra egg (for a total of three eggs in the batter, plus the one in the crust). I also added about a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter. For the crust I used a Duncan Hines French Vanilla cake mix, and I made it in a metal 9" X 13" pan (I sprayed the pan generously with cooking spray and had no trouble getting the cake out of the pan). I omitted the pecans as we don't like nuts. I baked it for about an hour.

This is a great quick treat! I wanted a little more cream cheese flavor so I drizzled a cream cheese frosting all over.  Yummy!

Excellent recipe. Everyone at work loved them. I wish they were a little more like cheesecake; they taste just like pumpkin pie squares. Made them in a 9x13 glass casserole. They came out much better the second time (the first batch was gone in a couple days), probably because I baked a good 10 min longer, and also put the nuts on top of the crust before putting in the pumpkin mix. I couldn't find pumpkin spice at the store so I had to call a friend to go online and read me the ingredients someone else posted... 2 t. cinnamon, 1 t. ginger, 1/2 t. allspice and 1/2 t. nutmeg. The recipe should be amended with those ingredients.

These were a big hit with my family.  I subbed yellow cake mix instead of pound cake and it was great.

This was my first attempt at baking and these tasted amazing.  I baked them for about an hour in a 9x13 pan.  Be warned--these bars are extremely rich and a little goes a long way!  The crust is definitely a keeper,  I may try it in other recipes.

I made these tonight and was disappointed!  They taste nothing like cheesecake at all. The crust is much too sweet and chewy. It should be made with a graham cracker crust and renamed pumpkin squares. If you're really looking for pumpkin cheesecake...keep looking! Sorry!

I followed some of the change recommedations, I used 2 packages of cream cheese instead of one, 4 eggs instead of 3, and I baked it in a glass 9X13 dish for 60 minutes.  I stored it in the refrigerator at first, but it became too hard.  When we left it at room temp., it maintained the flavor and was enjoyable to eat.

We absolutely love this recipe.  I don't like cheesecake, but this is awesome.  i can't even count the number of times we've made it.  The crust is much better than traditional "pie crust" or "graham cracker crust", and it's thick enough to support the weight of the bar.  The texture of the pumpkin/cheesecake filling is thick and smooth.  It's very easy to put together, and bakes evenly.  it's hard to wait for it to cool down to eat it. 
In a nutshell, it's simply delightful.  Always a hit at pot lucks and family get togethers.

My boyfriend absolutely loved this recipe and he knows his cheescake! I did use an individual mini cheesecake recipe and made a cheesecake layer. The poundcake crust was awesome. If you do make a cheesecake layer, make sure you put it undder the pumpkin layer because otherwise it will not layer, and increase your cooking time by about 10-15 minutes. Thanks for the great recipe, I will use it often!

These bars were dangerous to have around the house.  I'd take one bite and before I knew it I'd eaten two bars.  I made them in a 9x13 pan, and baked them for about 40 minutes.  The only problem I had is that the crust didn't totally get done (maybe because they were thicker in the smaller pan?).  Next time I might try baking the crust first for ten minutes or so.  The filling was wonderful, even better than regular pumpkin pie, in my opinion.  In fact, you could easily use this filling in a pie recipe.  I left out the pecans at the request of my husband, and it was still great.

Used yellow cake mix and added layer of cheesecake (recipe from cheesecake cookie cups).  Used 2 more tbs butter for crust b/c it didn't seem crumbly enough.  Cooked at 350degC for about an hour.

Loved it! Brought to a get together and everyone loved it! Made with yellow cake mix and was perfect. Will make again!  I accidentally used squash I had in the freezer instead of pumpkin, but you couldn't tell.

I've made these twice in the past month. The first time, I crushed a box of gingersnaps and added some melted butter to make the crust. The second time, I followed the directions and used a pound cake mix. I much prefer it with the gingersnap crust. The pound cake became a rock in the pan; a tasty rock, yes, but still a rock. The gingersnap crust gave it that little something extra to make it extraordinary. Three stars with the pound cake, five stars with the cookies. Thanks for sharing, Angie!

Delicious! I found these bars to have a wonderful cheesecake flavor despite what other reviewers have said.  I used a yellow cake mix but other than that followed the recipe as written.  My co-worker's loved them - they were gone fast!

YUM! These were so good - and a nice change of pace from traditional pumpkin pie with the flaky crust! Plus it was nice to cut small squares to get a taste. That being said, the recipe title is a bit misleading because these do not taste like cheesecake but rather taste more like pumpkin pie. The addition of the cream cheese did make it a little more dense but the whole "cheesecake" taste was lost. If I make these again I might double the amount of cream cheese using one 8 oz. package whipped with a little sugar to swirl it into the batter giving it a marbled effect. I was able to find the pound cake mix and like others I used a 9x13 baking pan that I lined with Reynolds Non-stick foil which made removing these from the pan very easy giving me a flat surface to cut these into squares. Be sure to wipe your knife with a damp cloth after each cut so each things don't get messy. These were perfect topped with a dollop of whipped cream!

Ditto to many reviews - I wouldn't call these cheesecake bars. But they're delicious. Because they taste like pumpkin pie, I couldn't help but top it with whipped cream and a dusting of pumpkin pie spice. I also did the 9x13 recipe but otherwise left everything the same. Delicious. I dare say I liked these even better than pumpkin pie. Thanks!

My husband likes anything made with pumpkin and this was no exception. We individually froze some of them for him to take one at a time for his lunch.  He is also a fan of chocolate chips, so I added a handful of them to half of the batch along with the nuts.   YUM!!!

I used a chocolate cake mix and it turned out great. Definitely bake for longer (50 minutes). Made it in a 9x13 pyrex dish (thank you for the advice, all!). I like a more buttery crust, so I'm going to add an extra tablespoon next time. Not too sweet, which is what I like most about this recipe. Thanks!

loved this recipe.  I don't have pumpkin pie spice so I just added a bunch of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, allspice to it.  For the crust I put in two eggs and used olive oil and not pound cake mix but butter pecan cake mix...then on the top after pouring on pumpkin cheese mixture I through on chocolate chips and pecans...I cook them a bit longer b/c I do it in a greased 10*13 glass casserole dish...everyone liked have made it for three different parties this fall and winter.

This is the second time I have made this. The first time I had pound cake mix and the this time I didn't have any so I used a butter cake mix. I definitely liked the pound cake better. I also added a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla to the batter as another reviewer suggested. Also instead of chopped pecans I sprinkled ground pecans on top which I liked alot. Very good recipe!

This was soOOO delicious and I don't like Pumpkin pie at all! I used (French Vanilla Cake Mix) instead of pound cake, the flavors together mixed so well. Other than that, I didn't change a thing! Thanks for a wonderful yummy pumpkin recipe that I can enjoy!

This is a fabulous recipe and it's even better using gingerbread cake mix instead of pound cake and then putting the pumpkin pie spice in the cheesecake filling.  It really gives it a great flavor with the gingerbread crust!  I didn't change the rest except to omit the nuts.  My father in law hates cheesecake but thought these were great (since we told him they were "pumpkin bars")!!

This was so good. I couldn't find pound cake mix, so used yellow cake mix as suggested previously.  I also used pumpkin pie mix, instead of pumpkin puree, left out the pumpkin pie spice (but did use it in the crust part) and added a few dashes of nutmeg and cinnamon to the pie mix.  Delish!

I've made this quite a few times and everyone loves it.  To me they taste more like a creamier pumpkin pie, rather than a pumpkin flavored cheesecake.  The pound cake crust is the best part!

This was very good however I think I prefer it without the pecans on the top and I substituted gingerbread mix for the pound cake and omitted adding the spice to the crust.  I actually make one of each batch and co-workers preferred the gingerbread crust.  Very Good!!

Absolutely to die for!  I've been cookin' & eatin' for a long, long time and this is the best dessert I've ever put in my mouth!  My 14-year old daughter assured me she didn't like pumpkin and would not take one bite.  Well, after much encouragement and an offer to pay her $1.oo, she tried it.  She couldn't stop eating these delicious bars!  I have another batch in the oven right now.  The only change I made was to bake them in my 9 x 13 inch pan and increase the cooking time to about 40 minutes.  They could not be easier and cleanup is a breeze 'cause I mix the crust and filling in the same bowl with just a quick wipe in between.  Thanks Angie for this outstanding recipe.

Don't expect "cheesecake", but a very delicious bar. Nice for snacking or cut larger and serve w/whipped cream.Comes out very thin. We loved it. Freezes well too.I put the pecans on first and then the pumpkin. That way you won't risk buring the nuts.

Although this is not typical cheesecake, it is fantastic.  It's quite rich but has a yummy creamy pumpkin flavor.  I made mine in a 9x13 pan rather than a jelly roll pan and I really liked the way they turned out.  Thanks!

Thank you, Angie!!  I took these to work and everyone just LOVED them! It's sort of like having a slice of pumpkin pie without the mess.....and the pecans on top were perfect. The crust was like a wonderful cookie base. I had to go to this site at work to print the recipe for several people. Thanks again. Yum!

The recipe was easy. As others said, it's more like pumpkin pie than cheesecake but nonetheless, it's tasty! I substituted low fat cream cheese and non-fat condensed milk to lighten the calorie load. A nice holiday dessert!

I have to agree with some of the other posts.  Too much like pumpkin pie and my family didn't like the cake mix on the bottom. I will probably not use this recipe again.

These are so-so. Tastes more like pumpkin pie...couldn't detect anything resembling cheesecake. Also, really did not like the crust at all...in my opinion, the use of the pumplin pie is a bit heavy-handed. Will not make again.

I thought I would love these given the reviews, but I wasn't impressed.  It tasted just like pumpkin pie (as the reviews said) and the crust didn't seem to go with the rest of the dessert--maybe because my taste buds were expecting pumpkin pie!  I wish I had added the cheese cake layer one of the reviewers suggested.  I doubt I would bother to make this again.

This was really good.  A hit at a bonfire I had.  I did put it in a 9 x 13 pan and it was perfect.

These were way below average IMO. As another reviewer did, I used a 9x13 pan in lieu of the suggested jelly roll pan, but I can't believe that would've been the difference. The crust was dry and that really detracted from the taste overall. Maybe needed more butter? Maybe if I'd drowned the whole thing in whipped cream? Also, these weren't "cheesecake" at all. I won't make these again. There are way better recipes out there for pumpkin desserts.

My whole family loved these bars.  I made them in a 9x13 pan versus the jelly roll pan.  I sent some to school for my son's class and all the teachers and kids wanted the recipe!

A word to the wise: 

Do not try to economize this recipe; it just doesn't work. In a pumpkin pie, you can substitute the less expensive evaporated milk & sugar for sweetened condensed milk. DO NOT DO THIS. You cream cheese will end up nasty and gritty. I made this mistake the first time I made the recipe. Also, two bars of cream cheese works better than one. I omitted the nuts-- no need for them. I topped this cheesecake with a sour cream/brown sugar/vanilla mixture-- tastes great. I'm taking this one to church!

Everyone at my house really liked these. I think next time I will adjust the recipe to include the pumpkin pie spice in the pumpkin mixutre to break up the condensed milk flavour that runs through the pumpkin portion of this recipe. Very good taste overall.

Very Good! My family really enjoyed it. Once it chills in the refrigerator, it gets much thicker. It kind of reminds me of a cheesecake dessert, rather than cheesecake itself. I would think you could add more cream cheese and extra eggs if you wanted more of a cheesecake texture. On the other hand, I would think adding more pumpkin would give it more of a pie texture. This recipe could be changed to fit whatever taste you are looking for. 

*** I will make this recipe again and may try some modifications to change the texture in different ways. Thank you for sharing.

This is definitely a delicious recipe.  I read reviews before I baked it for the first time and decided that I needed to make it more "cheesecake-y" the first time around.  I bought a box of No-Bake cheesecake mix and just mixed it in with the pumpkin.  It still turned out delicious but was not as cheesecake-y as I had hoped.  I felt it was missing something.  Next time, I'm going to add a layer of cream cheese on top after it comes out of the oven and cools and sprinkle the pecans on that.  This is a great recipe for the pumpkin lover.

Yummy!  used spice cake mix for crust and mixed up own spice for pumpkin layer. already a favorite and will make it again & again.  less fat than gooey pumpkin bars that call for 2 blocks of butter and the texture and flavor was even better!

I'm not a fan of cheesecake but I loved this recipe. The cream cheese flavor is fairly subtle when mixed with the pumpkin. I'll be making these for Thanksgiving rather than traditional pumpmkin pie.

These were "okay".  I love cheesecake & pumpkin, but these just didn't do much for me.  I guess the consistency was just too creamy for my liking.  I wasn't crazy about the crust either.  Too crumbly.

I've made this recipe three times this month for different events and it's a big hit everytime!  I'm not very skilled when it comes to cooking/baking, but everyone raves about this dessert and a co-worker just asked for the recipe.  I just hope they don't expect more from me.

I got off to a slow start with these because I had to go to three stores before I found a pound cake mix.  However, it was worth the trouble because they are excellent.  I made them according to the recipe (using pumpkin pie spice recipe from this site) because I was taking them to a gathering and wanted lots of fairly small pieces.  Everyone said how good they were.  Unfortunately, one piece leads to two that leads to .......  Be forewarned!

These are wonderful and I think even better the next day and the day after that if you have any left.  I used a 9x13 pan and cooked for 40 minutes like other reviewers suggested.  Perfect!  Even better with vanilla ice cream.  After reading other reviews I renamed them Pumpkin Pie Bars and wouldn't you know my husband said "these taste like Pumpkin cheesecake"!

Wonderful fall dessert!  I ended up baking mine at least 10 minutes longer.  I refrigerated it overnight and served it for a family gathering the next evening.  It's not the most beautiful dessert, but everyone loved it!  Thanks for submitting this one; it's a keeper!

So disappointed in everyway.  I love pumpkin cheesecake bars and  have been looking for a great recipe, this is NOT it.  I did not care for the crust made from the pound cake, the filling was too sweet.  I make my pumpkin pie with condensed milk so I like a sweet pumpkin pie, but this was TOO sweet and did not have enough pumpkin flavor.  I am sorry I wasted the ingred on this recipe.

Made exactly as recipe, but baked in 9x13 glass pan for about 40 minutes.  Everyone loved it.  Will be making again.

Made as described, but used pumpkin pie mix rather than pumpkin & spices. Great way to use up the supplies I already had on hand. Two thumbs up from the hubby.

Amazing taste. I did cheat and use pumpkin pie seasoning along with a extra tablespoon of cinnamon. Highly recommend recipe.

Love this but with a graham cracker crust, I find the pound cake crust too moist and not like a real cheesecake crust.

I was a little dissapointed by this recipe. After letting mine cool and then putting them in the fridge the crust was rock hard the next day and extremely difficult to cut.  I would recommend letting them cool, cutting them, THEN put them in the fridge.

I also found them too rich for my taste but should be expected though all the condensed milk and cream cheese. Will try another recipe next time.

I also used a yellow cake mix and a 
13 x 9 pan.
It was easy to make.

These are great! I love the flavor and creaminess. I used parchment paper instead of cooking spray and had no problems. I did have a hard time getting the crust to thin out evenly in the jelly roll pan. I think next time I will try the 9x13 method. Thanks!

These went fast and were delicious.  I had a little trouble finding the pound cake mix, and then it was much more expensive than other cake mixes.  I think next time I'll try it with a regular cake mix.

These were a little mushy but sooooo good. I wasn't sure how I would like combining pumpkin and cheesecake, but this is one recipe that I will make often. The family raved about these, definitely recommended!

The crust was a little too crumbly, but overall this was a very tasty dessert.

These are really good. I wish this recipe would have more of a cheesecake flavor though... I think I'll try adding more cream cheese next time.

I expected more after reading all the great reviews.  I found the bars way to sweet.  I did not like the crust at all, the filling was ok.

This was just okay, nothing special. Would be better with an actual cheesecake layer between the crust and pumpkin. This was taken to a potluck and no one asked for the recipe or raved about it like the other things I brought.

I made these following the recipe except I only put nuts on half the pan. I made 2 batches, one for work and one for home. The pan at work was gone in 15 minutes and everyone wanted the recipe! I also enjoyed them alot even though I usually don't eat pumkin desserts much.

This recipe is great!  Make sure you copy the recipe when you bring it to a function.  You will be asked for it numerous time.  Also, try the crust in a regular pumpkin pie. It's very tasty.
