This is a good recipe but my husband prefers a pie crust.

I really liked this recipe, it is simple, it has all the food groups, the texture is amazing. What I did differently, added Mrs. Dash Southwest Chipotle to the onions, used a large clove of fresh garlic, and like the author suggests used some of that Smoked Virginia ham. I deliberately added parmesan on the top before cooking about 1/4 cup grated Reggiano, ground black pepper on top a light sprinkling of Mrs Dash.

I made this for my wife last night and she thought it was fabulous! The hash brown crust really adds a new and delicious dimension to the quiche. I had to modify the ingredients a little in quantity, as my pie plate is of a larger size, about 10 inches. But otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Since my pie was bigger and perhaps my oven a little cooler, I needed to cook it about 55 minutes and could probably have gone to 60 minutes.
The broccoli was crisp and had a little crunch which was perfect. We are looking forward to the leftovers, and we will make this again!

Next time I will use cubed ham.  Deli ham seemed to get a bit hidden.
