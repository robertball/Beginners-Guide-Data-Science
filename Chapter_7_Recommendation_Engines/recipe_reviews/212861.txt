I added the whole box of cream cheese, they are a lot softer and if you like cream cheese this was great to have the extra! I also had to cook mine for 8-10 mins  Excellent recipe, my mom liked mine better than the one shes been baking for years!

So awesome! The only thing I would suggest is to refridgerate the 15 minutes before so they stay in the same shape. Also, I needed to cook mine for about 8-10 minutes; not 6. I keep them cold in the fridge and they are great snowballs to eat!

THESE ARE AMAZING! I love Mexican Wedding Cookies and these are similar with the addition of cream cheese and more cake-like--- which is better! I doubled the recipe for holiday cookie plates. MY CHANGES: I left out the almond extract (because I didn't have any and I don't normally like it anyway) and added a tiny bit more vanilla extract. I also used confectioners sugar in the dough mixture to give it a smoother texture. I mixed the finely chopped walnuts into the dough then rolled them in my hands to make little 1.5" balls. They baked for about 10 minutes, I think. I didn't really time them-- I just watched for golden edges. They kept their general "ball shape" and didn't flatten much at all. I let them cool a few minutes on the cookie sheet, then transferred them to a cooling rack. When they reached room temperature, I gently rolled them in a bowl of powdered sugar. My family was eating them as fast as I was finishing them. I love that these have the taste of a Mexican Wedding Cookie, but are softer and have the hint of cream cheese. Great recipe! Thanks!

These were SO GOOD!  I used all butter (no shortening) and they came out great; the cream cheese flavor isn't too strong but definitely gives the cookies a nice flavor and texture.  I would recommend letting them cool about 4-5 minutes before rolling in the powdered sugar or they get sticky.  I stored mine in a big ziploc bag with the remaining powdered sugar and they kept very well.

I didn't use any nuts, but instead added a small package of chocolate pudding to the mix and also added chocholate chips at the very end, before baking. I rolled them in the confectioners sugar and then put them in the fridge. Serve them COLD!! They freeze beautifully. You can really use as much cream cheese as you wish - I added more than the recipe called for and they were great!!

Supposed to get 24 cookies but instead I got 30 and yet had to bake them for 15 min. and still they were very doughy...  The almond extract taste was overwhelming! Will never make them again.

Moist and yummy. A wonderful alternative to the original snowball. After reading the reviews I did refrigerate the dough for 15 minutes and that helps keep the snowball together. I did opt to add the nuts to the dough instead of rolling the cookie in nuts and I doubled the recipe. While my son Chef Junior (also on this site) is out making real snowballs here in snowy NH I am back to the kitchen to make the Peanut Butter Blossoms also on this site as part of a large cookie assortment tray I will bring to my New Years Eve gathering tonight. Happy New Years everyone!!!

I always read reviews before I make anything. I would absolutely suggest refrigerate dough before baking. I made two batches and the one I had in fridge for 15min. The other 2 hours.. 2 hours is suggested for holding shape. I made some plain and some with chocolate chips.. I suggest dipping in powdered sugar twice. Once warm, once cold. YUMO

Loved these cookies. I followed the instructions, with the exception of the walnuts(not a big fan). I did take some of the reviewers tips into consideration. Such as, refrigerate the mix for at least 15-20 minutes. It will be easier to manage and will hold their ball shape. Also I waited for them to cool down completed before rolling them in confectioners' sugar. Will make again and again!

These were easy to make, kids could help with rolling into balls because the dough is not messy. Love the cream cheese flavour and tenderness. I took these to a cookie exchange and everyone else wanted the recipe. People think they're short bread but are surprised (and delighted) to discover they're soft. I too found they needed more time in the oven. (Just keep an eye on them since ovens vary so much.) I didn't have any sugar to coat, or the optional walnuts, so I drizzled melted white chocolate over them and they looked and tasted great. I will definitely make these again!

these are very good, might even try rolling them out and making shaped cookies next time.  I ended up baking for about 12-15min for a crispier cookie.  First batch was a little doughy but still good.  Play with the time to figure out your personal preference.  This one is easy enough for the kids to help with.

These were delicious, I was nervous about the addition of cream cheese but just as I thought Everything is better with cream cheese. The crumb of the cookie was more soft and you taste the twang of c-cheese. I gave it only 4 stars because I didn't use shortening otherwise this is a great recipe. I just added it to my family Recipe Book I've been making !!!!

Let me start out with the good news: The taste is FANTASTIC!  These are exactly the cookies that I remember from my childhood!  The bad news: Not sure if I mis-measured, but my "balls" ended up as regular cookies (had to call them "Sunny Day Snowballs" because they looked like puddles!)  Oh, well!  My fam is not particular about the shape, so we are happy with this recipe.  Will try to add more flour next time around.

Very disappointed in this recipe.  I baked the cookies longer than 15 minutes recommended but still moist inside.  They did not hold ball shape even though I put them in the refrigerator, as recommended by others.  The sugar would not stay on the cookie.

I accidentally added double the cream cheese. They still turned out really good, but would have been better with less cream cheese...and I LOVE cream cheese.

These were spectacular! Only I changed walnuts to pecans. Next time I make them, I'm going to put the chopped pecans in the cookies and not in the powdered sugar covering.

The taste of this cookie was wonderful, but the consistency was not what most think of when baking the traditional snowball cookie. I was looking to make a twist on my snowball cookie and was disappointed when these cookies did not come out of the oven in the ball shape one might expect. They were flat and undercooked. I had to bake them much longer than the recipie called for. Since these cookies taste very close to what I traditionally would call a snowball cookie (without the shape), I won’t likely make these again. If the recipe was called anything other than “snowball”, I would have given it a much higher rating.

I will not make this recipe again.  I refrigerated the dough but these cookies were almost flat when they came out of the oven.  After cooking them for about 14 minutes they were still kind of mushy in the center.  They tasked pretty good...but they just weren't pretty.

Pretty good. I did waste a 1/2 cup of walnuts however because they wouldnt stick to the snowballs, other then that nice and fluffy pretty good flavor. I added the whole block of cream cheese as well because I love cheesecake tasting stuff.

I did everything as described & they flattened then started falling apart.  I guess I should have read other reviews before hand & put in fridge for 15 mins before cooking and cook longer.  I would also add walnuts to dough seemed like there was to much shortening would add alittle more flour.

This makes a very wet dough.  I had to raise the oven temp to 375 to get them to brown, doubled the cooking time, and wait for them to cool before putting them into the powdered sugar.  They taste great, but I'm not a fan of this particular recipe.  I also tried a batch using some of the reviewer's suggestions (butter in place of shortening and a whole package of cream cheese).  They slid around the cookie sheet while baking and still needed extra baking time and heat.

I added a whole 8 oz box of cream cheese , replaced the almond extract with another 1/2 tsp vanilla (was out) . Stuck the dough in the snow for 15 minutes before rolling them and then they took about 15 minutes to bake.

I first made this recipe 3 years ago. Everyone loves them. The only thing I do different is I add the chopped nuts to the dough. This is a 5 star simple cookie with a huge taste of YUM!

I must have made VERY small cookies because I got 70 out of this recipe, which is fine I was just expecting fewer. The cookies did spread out some even though I refrigerated the dough but it wasn't too bad. I mixed the nuts in with the dough. If you do that I'd recommend chopping them up very finely.

The cookie was too soft and broke apart when rolling in powdered sugar.   Had to bake for an extra 12 to 15 minutes.  I will not use this recipe again.

Easy, tasty and can change ingredients for healthy options. Falls apart easily. 

Instead of lard, I used coconut butter and Splenda baking sugar.

I recently made these however I changed up the recipe to make it work for my family. I used the entire block of cream cheese (about a cup) and used a full cup of butter rather than shortening. I also decided to skip the almond extract as I have always found it over powers any flavor, and used a full tsp of vanilla extract instead. I had to cook them a bit longer as I was using convection bake (15mins per batch) they turned out great, light and fluffy and full of cream cheese flavor. Not quite a snowball cookie any longer but a cream cheese cookie instead. These are now a family favorite.

I wanted a cream cheese cookie without having to roll, cut or do anything special to it.  I knew it sounded great so I made a double recipe.  I was doing this after 10 p.m. and was too tired to bake so put dough in fridge.  Maybe that was the issue but a rounded tablespoon does not equal 1" diameter.  A rounded teaspoon is more like it.  And 6 minutes?  I had to bake 15-20 min.  They are delicious and I will make again but at a time that isn't my bedtime (LOL).  Oh, I also used double vanilla instead of almond as others I made these for do not like almond.  Pecans instead of walnuts too.  But I really think the nuts could just be added into the dough instead.  Next time....

They were very yummy! The fell apart a lot so it was kind of messy. I don't like almond extract so I doubled the amount of vanilla extract. Good luck!

my mom accidentally put flour in the cream cheese instead of confectioners sugar.  she was going to throw it away and I told her no, looked up cream cheese cookies and saw these.  I did not have almond flavoring but had lemon. so used that in place of the almond. Needless to say everyone loved them and asked for recipe.

I made these today for grands. They loved the powdered sugar coating but, said didn't taste like anything. I agreed. Next time, oh yes there will be a 'next time', because the ease in making these little cookies makes it worth tweaking the flavor. Adding more flavoring and experimenting with other flavors will be worth the time.

I followed the recipe exactly, omitting the walnuts, except for baking time. Following the advice of other reviewers, I baked for 8 minutes which proved to fit perfectly to our preferences.  My only criticism, and the only thing preventing me giving this 5 stars, is that the almond extract really overwhelmed the flavor. I LOVE all things almond and/or amaretto  (& I prefer strong favors) and yet the almond was too much for the delicate cookie. Next time I'll probably just stick with vanilla.

I liked this recipe. I followed the instructions as they were written. The only change I made was I substituted vanilla extract for Bailey's Vanilla Cinnamon. I also found that the ballscrumbled when rolling in the powdered sugar and nuts. Instead I placed them in mini cupcake papers and used a shaker to cover them. The nuts didn't stick. I put this recipe away for safe keeping. Definitely one you can have fun with. Thanks for sharing.

Loved these. Taste awesome and look super cute. I would suggest using something other than shortening because it kind of leaves a distinct taste behind. Dont get me wrong they still taste great! Definitely need to be cooked longer. Maybe 10 mins. Also added sprinkles to the powdered sugar to roll them in (: awesome holiday treat!
