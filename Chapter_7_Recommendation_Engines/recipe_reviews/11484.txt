These are fantastic cookies. Light and airy with the powdered suger dusting make them irresistible. You can't eat just one!  I made these with my mother when I was growing up and were always a special treat. The recipe was lost in a fire and I have looked everywhere for another. You cant imagine how excited I am to have found this one.

Wonderful! I've been trying to find the recipe most like my Baba's because I left mine with my brother. We don't use alcohol in ours, either. I'm allergic to alcohol, so it was very important to find a recipe that doesn't use rum or whiskey. Thank you so much for sharing this!

I'd never heard of this before, but I needed a recipe to use up the leftover egg yolks from an angel food cake I'd made. I brought these to our Mother's Day brunch, and everyone loved them! Thanks for the recipe! I've submitted a picture here, but you can check out my blog for more pictures (clarindas.blogspot.com).

So yummy! My grandmother made similar ones and I lost the recipe. I'm glad to have found one almost exactly like it again.

I was excited by this recipe, but unfortunately it was very bland and I had a really hard time cooking the dough all the way through in the oil. Also, make sure in the first step where it says 'Combine all ingredients', do not include the shortening! This was tricky. Also, maybe I am inept, but I couldn't make anything that looked like a 'bow' from the strips that I cut. All-around awkward.
