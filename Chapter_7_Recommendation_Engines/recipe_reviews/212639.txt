Very satisfying, but this does have a very different taste from most stroganoffs because of the use of yogurt and not sour cream.  With that said, my husband and I actually preferred it!  I used red wine instead of sherry and it really gave it a richer dimension and an elegant taste.  (I also used 93/7 ground beef and added a beef bullion cube to the water.)

This was so simple and tasted great!! I did adjust to my taste: added garlic powder to meat while browning, 3tsp Worcestershire sauce and 1TBS Dijon mustard with the soup, and I used beef stock instead of water. Oh, and I just added what I had left of a Sour Cream container, maybe 2 TBS instead of the yogurt. Yum. My husband said "thank you!" after he ate this.

I made this last nite with a couple of substitutions/additions.  Used gr. beef instead of steak; strained it into a bowl, set aside; wiped cast iron skillet & added a bit of olive oil to sautee onions til tender; added beef and stirred in a packet of brown gravy mix and cooked a bit longer; added 1-1/4 cups water and simmered a few minutes (I always add the brown gray mix to gr. beef dishes for a richer taste, the amount of liquid depends on dish); pushed meat to the sides of skillet and added a can of cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic (instead of plain cream of mushroom) to the center and stirred to mix soup and liquid; simmered for a bit longer; poured over cooked egg noodles then mixed in the sour cream.  Hubby doesn't like sour cream much, but ate 2 helpings plus took leftovers today for lunch at work.  I will make this again.

If I could give this a 4.5, I would.  I used Campbell's Golden Mushroom soup, which I think made it much better than regular Cream of Mushroom soup.  Next time, I will use half the sherry because I thought it overpowered the mushroom taste.  I used pre-cooked meatballs because I was trying to clean out the freezer, which made this recipe supper fast.

I made this with some garlic and sour cream instead of yogurt. It came out very good.

Campbell's used to have a WONDERFUL older version involving milk, cream of mushroom, Worcestershire, and sour cream.  Unfortunately I have lost my copy and have been searching for it on the internet ever since.  This definitely needed some doctoring up.  I always use ground beef in my stroganoff.  And here are the modifications I made to this recipe which made it MUCH tastier!  I used Regular Cream of Mushroom (more flavor), 1 Tbsp tomato paste, omit the sherry, 1/2 cup milk instead of water, 2 Tbsps Worcestershire and definitely always good sour cream 1/4-1/2 cup.  I also add a small can of chopped mushrooms in at the end along with salt and pepper to taste.  Yummy!  Very close to the old recipe!

I didn't like this dish.  It was bland, the sauce was nasty and the beef was really tough.  I won't be making this one again.

Good basic stroganoff. I used ground round and about 1/4 c chopped onion. I didn't have sherry so I subbed it and the water for chicken broth (adding another cup of broth) and I tossed the dry noodles 4 oz. worth right in the skillet with the meat and broth and cooked it until they were done, about 15-20 minutes. I subbed a spoonfull of ketchup for the tomato paste and sour cream for the yogurt. This turned out well and I'd fix it again.

I did as the recipe called for and did not salt the beef because some had commented that it turned out salty.  Wish I had.  Ended up adding some beef boullion for flavor and that did it.  I also added a small can of mushrooms.  I am definitely throwing it into rotation because it was so easy to make.

This recipe was bland. If I make it again I will take the advice of other reviewers and add to it.
