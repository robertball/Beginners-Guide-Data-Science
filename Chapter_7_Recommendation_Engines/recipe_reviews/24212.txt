My husband would eat these every day for breakfast if he could.  He loves bacon and thinks it should be declared a food group ! I didn't use refrigerated biscuits instead I made "J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits" from this site (they're awsome) and then added the eggs, bacon, and cheese.  I wrapped a few in saran wrap and a layer of foil for my husband to take to work and pop in the microwave for a quick breakfast.

Good, fast, and easy breakfast.  You can replace the meat with sausage or ham easily.  I prefer to use frozen biscuits rather than canned, but either work.  English muffins do also.

This an easy and delicious recipe.  It is fast too.  Hubby thought that I spent a ton of time in the kitchen making this...He doesn't realize that I didn't make the biscuits from scratch.  Thanks for the post...delicious.

Our favorite breakfast sandwich! I sometimes use canadian bacon instead or my hubby prefers a sausage patty. Even better with homemade biscuits.

This was a nice basic egg biscuit sandwich.  I used J.P.’s Big Daddy Biscuits recipe listed on this website which we like.  I prefer it made with a fried egg because it would be less messy to eat than with scrambled eggs.

My kids really enjoyed these!  I had leftover biscuits to use up (baking powder biscuit recipe) so I didn't need to use store bought.  I also used the cheesy herbed eggs recipe (again from this site) which really gave much flavor to the sandwich. I will make this again and will try using a sausage patty in place of the bacon.

Pretty good.  Made my own biscuits from my own mix.  Will make again.  Good as a take-along when in a rush, as another reviewer suggested.

These were well recieved by my kids.  I substituted the bacon with sausage patty's with good results so it is a versatile recipe. (canadian bacon, bacon, sausage patty's, etc.)  I think these are better than the fast food chain, and really didn't take too long to put together.

This was a perfect hit with my family.  I made homemade biscuits, because I did not have refridgerator ones.  They were great.  I will make this again.

Made big biscuits with Bisquit mix and cheated with precooked bacon. Also used American cheese instead of cheddar. Liked the idea of buttering the biscuit on the inside. While it is not close to my favorite fast food biscuit, it still was pretty darn tasty and good. Added fresh ground pepper.

Good one! If you want to contain the size of your egg, use the larger rim from a Ball canning jar to hole the egg at a perfect size. JFess

I enjoy its versatility. If I have the time I make my own biscuits; if not the tube things work ok. Love the comment about wrapping in parchment and serving to a crowd!

I love to make home made biscuit sandwiches and egg Mcmuffins with English muffins.  I usually cook the bacon on a cookie sheet in a 400 degree oven, easy and you don't have to flip it.  I will then keep it in the freezer to heat up as I want it.  I also use Canadian bacon, wrap it in a paper towel and zap in microwave for 30 seconds to warm it, and I make my egg in the microwave too, spray custard dish with Pam and crack egg into it, scramble it or just break the yolk, cover (very important to cover as it will spit) and microwave for 45 seconds.  Perfect egg and shaped perfect for a round sandwich!  It takes longer to toast your English muffin than it takes to cook your egg.  Top with cheese and your meat of choice and enjoy! (Brown and serve sausage patties are perfect for these sandwiches too)

I make these all the time.  A quick method for an individual serving of eggs is to spray a ramekin with Pam, break the egg into ramekin and add 2 tsp. of milk, mix well and mic for 50 seconds to 1 min. depending on wattage of microwave.  Assemble as called for in Step 5.  Very quick breakfast if meat and biscuits are made in advance.  These are so good and versatile!

Delicious! I topped the split piping-hot biscuits with an American cheese slice, then the egg, then another cheese slice, then the bacon. The cheese was all melted and gooey. Mmmmm! Husband finshed his with some hot sauce, I had ketchup. Thanks so much, Kristi!

Oh I love these, they are a million times better than fast food versions! I make bisquick biscuits or use an English muffin, sometimes I use frozen sausage patties instead of bacon, depending on what I have on hand. I also prefer fried eggs to scrambled, you can fold it up to fit. :)

i make these every weekend for breakfast at work during the week. I use Egg Beaters and mix shredded cheese in a 8x8 pan. I bake them in the oven for about 15 minutes. Cut onto squares and they fit nicely on a biscuit, muffin, or croissant with bacon, sausage, or canadian bacon. Yummm!!

I make these for the after church crowd. An easy brunch. Use American cheese because it melts. Wrap each sandwich in some parchment paper. Pop them in oven, on a cookie sheet at 375 for 10 minutes to melt the cheese. Serve them in a basket. Always a big hit, especially with the menfolk. I also prefer the frozen individual biscuits.

There are so many variations and/or combinations for canned biscuits. I thought everybody used them. My kids grew up eating them and are now in their 40s.

It's a decent recipe. I just wish that people wouldn't throw the word "homemade" around so much. Homemade biscuits are very easy to make. Just my opinion.

I used the GRANDS biscuits wheat or honey butter, rolled out and filled.  I folded them over and used a fork to seal.  They looked like empanadas or half moon pies.  My family loves them!

I make these breakfast sandwiches all the time. Sometimes I use English muffins and toast them in butter in the pan first. Then I fry eggs, and I'll use sliced ham luncheon meat,sausage or bacon, which I brown in the pan and top it with cheese. Delish!

You can make this go even faster. I toast and butter an english muffin. Instead of scrambling the egg, I cook it sort of like an omelet. Fold the egg so it fits on the muffin and top with cheese and bacon. We have our own eggs witch makes it even better!  I love to make these for guests!

These are wonderful, a quick change-up would be to use the slider buns available at Kroger's, and either bacon, ham or sausage are equally as good on this terrific  fast breakfast. - mixgirl

I made this with bacon one day then with smoked ham from the deli another... But the only difference is I made it with yellow american cheese being that my family isn't to big on cheddar.. But it was a delicious breakfast sandwich...

Definitely wonderful! Great also with English Muffin, Bagel, muffins, toasted bread of any kind. I've also used soft boiled egg, pan scrambled egg (break eggs separately into frying pan, break each yolk and lightly mix with fork into its white.....actually suppose you don't have to keep them separate, just divide them to put on buttered bread).

It is a great way to wake up your loved ones. Great as is in this recipe, also very good with buttery scrambled eggs. My family has actually grown to look forward to the scrambled biscuits on Sunday morning. Two of those will start your day off right.  And being from the South it's important to have some hot sauce nearby..... Thanks

I love it although i might look for a different type of biscuit to use. I also used maple sausage patties in place of the bacon. Very simple and a quick breakfast or snack

These are great.  I made them with Cooked Sausage, too, and, since my hubby likes them,  I have used English Muffins.   The Muffins work great too!!  I like the Canadian bacon or ham idea too.  It makes a good "change up" to mix it up a little!!   I make them by the dozen and freeze them.  Wrap each one in wax paper or foil and freeze then   store in a gallon Ziplock Bag in the freezer for 1-2 months.  They don't last that link at our house!!  LOL.

Followed the recipe exactly...almost.  Have to admit I cheated a bit by adding the crumbled bacon to the scrambled eggs just before they set so the bacon didn't fall off. DH totally loved it, & so did I!  Thanks, Kristi, for an easy, quick, tasty breakfast!

I can't eat them for various medical reasons but the recipe is fine. If I could eat these I'd make them.  I gave up trying to make eatable scratch biscuits 30 years ago after my family offered to paint my last batch black and sell to the NHL for pucks. Canned biscuits and biscuit mixes work just fine. The recipe is an 'idea' that works for some people. You can find recipes on AllRecipes that reviewers have made changes to fit their taste, ingredients they have on hand or what they can afford. That's what I like about the site.

This is a great recipie for quick on the go breakfast biscuits for those of us who don't have the time to make our own homemade biscuits. Thank you VERY much Kristi for sharing
Still making these and LOVING them. I don't think Kristi was alluding to these being homemade biscuits, she said these are homemade version of fast food biscuits, and these are much better than those!!
