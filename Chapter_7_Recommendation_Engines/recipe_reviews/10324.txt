I made these for the office and added a butter/maple/sugar glaze and they were gone in 5 minutes with a note that they were the best cookies they'd ever had.  A few tips:  don't flatten when you put the pecan on top, they spread, and if your kitchen is warm put the formed cookies on the sheet in the frige for a few minutes so they won't spread too much.  A great recipe I will use over and over and over again.

I always look for new cookie recipes around Christmas and this one appealed to me. However, when I saw the up and down reviews, I was hesitant to try it.  I can say I'm really glad that I did.  These are tender, buttery, tasty and attractive!  I didn't change the recipe at all.  You should make sure your butter is soft (use the real thing), but I don't recommend putting it in your microwave.  I used a small cookie scoop to keep the size uniform, which I think is also important.  Mix the dough thoroughly.  I had some butter on the top of the mixing bowl that I incorporated into a couple of cookies and these really spread out!  Otherwise, the other cookies were fine and maintained their shape.  Mine took 12 minutes exactly at 350ยบ, and when done, I let them cool on the cookie sheet about 10 minutes before removing them to a wire cooling rack.  The maple flavor is very delicate, so if you want a heavier maple taste, you may want to make a thin maple glaze for garnish once the cookies are completely cool.  My husband loved them just the way they were, and I will be making these again for sure.  Thanks, Denise for this wonderful recipe!

Nice and buttery, kind of like shortbread. I ran out of pecan halves, so I finished up dipping the tops into pecan pieces, and it worked just as well. Next time I might try rolling them in pecan meal. Very easy to make.

Right out of the oven these were awesome, warm and chewy, but when they cooled they got very hard.  I wish they'd stayed chewy.

I liked the idea of a maple cookie but I am not a huge fan of artificial maple flavor so I did make a big change: I subsituted real maple syrup for the sugar. With the added moisture did have to add a bit more flour ....but I liked the natural flavored end product

I am trying to make a variety of flavors of Christmas cookies and picked this one. One of the reviewers thought the cookies tasted floury. I actually thought the opposite and thought, for the amount of sugar, they tasted rather sugary and a little crunchy. For some reason, I was thinking they would be like shortbread, but not at all. I did not have any pecans, and wanted the maple flavor to stand out. I used a modified version of a maple icing from another cookie recipe on the site. I made 1/2 recipe and got 18 cookies with a cookie scoop. My favorite part of the cookie was the icing, but I am actually reviewing the cookie. Based on the picture, I was surprised that these cookies spread quite a bit to, so make sure to leave them in a mound. They also get even more crispy as they cool, which I didn't care for, but that could possibly help with that. I wish these would have worked for Christmas. I put them out, but they didn't get eaten like the others. It could have been because they were so flat, but for me it was the texture and sugary taste of the cookie.

Took this one to my club meeting. Ladies loved it. I liked it because it was inexpensive to make, but tasty and easy .

Sorry, but I was not as impressed as the previous bakers...nice maple flavor, but the cookies themselves turn into a floury paste in your mouth-almost everyone at Thanksgiving Dinner agreed with me. Sorry, but I won't make these again :^(

I made these cookies twice and loved them! I will say do not use margarine!! As most know, real butter is key! My cookies didn't flatten out. I had to flatten them slightly before putting them in the oven. I also did not have any pecan halves so I too used a maple glaze which really MADE the cookie! Everyone seemed to love them! I was very pleased with the end result! Thx!

I was excited about this recipe because I love maple but I was really disappointed with this cookie. First of all, there is hardly any maple flavor. The flavor is decent but takes more like a straight up butter cookie. Second, the cookies did not spread at all so the 12 minutes the recipe calls for is way off. Even after flattening them more, they have still been in my oven for over a half hour now and are still doughy inside. Decent cookie but the recipe could use a few tweaks.

These cookies were good. I made them with half white sugar and half brown sugar. I also added another half a teaspoon of maple extract and I added chopped pecans because I didn't have halves. They were good. the did spread out, next time will be be adding more extract. I didn't taste enough maple.
