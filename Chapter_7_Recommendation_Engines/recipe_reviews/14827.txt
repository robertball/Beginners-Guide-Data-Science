This was a great recipe. I did make some modifications. I ommited the chevril. I also used closer to a cup and a half of olive oil. I used wheat pita pockets, and they just really soaked up the olive oil. I baked for 5 minutes and they came out perfect! **Update** I made these again, and I used less olive oil because instead of cutting the pita pockets into triangles and then brushing them with the olive oil mixture, I only cut them in half, and then I brushed them. After each was covered I cut into triangles. This was SOOO much easier and less time consuming!

The recipe never said exactly HOW to cut the pita into 8 pieces and, to me, this made all the difference.  First, I cut it like a pie with 8 pieces (leaving the two layers of pita).  I had to bake for 15 minutes (flipping the pitas once) to get a crispy effect.  The next time, I cut it lengthwise and then into 4 thin pieces (yielding a total of 8) and cooked for 7 minutes.  Each came out well, but I guess it's a matter of preference.  The first way, chips are thicker, the second way, they are thinner and crispier.  Also, I found it easier to sprinkle the herb mixture.  When I dipped the pitas in the oil, some pieces had a lot more seasoning than others.  Still, they were a great hit and tasted delicious.

Unbelievably good and tasty.  I split the pitas in half and then cut into 8 pieces.  I baked all the "thin" halves in one batch and all the "thick" halves in one batch.  I omitted olive oil and just sprayed wedges with olive oil cooking spray.  I combined the spices as stated in the recipe in a small bowl and sprinkled these on and then one more quick spray to make sure everything stayed put.  My guests loved them and they disappeard quickly.  My kids thought they were better than potato chips...what a healthy, fat-free snack for them.  Thanks for sharing.  We will be making these often in our home.

These are fantastic!  Or, I should say they were, as my guests devoured them as quickly as I could take them out of the oven, and asked that I make another batch later that same night.  I didn't use the chevril, and added a little parmesean cheese sprinkled on top.

Yum! I used homemade whole wheat pitas (from this site), sprayed them with canola oil cooking spray, and sprinkled on the spices (rather than measuring).  Then I sprayed them again to help the spices stick. Dip in homemade hummus - yum!

What a great recipe! We made these to go with a jalapeno jelly/cream cheese spread for Christmas. Didn't have chervil- but found that the substitute is 1/2 parsley & 1/2 tarragon; so use 1/2 tsp. of parsley and 1/2 tsp. tarragon. So simple!

These were fantastic! I didn't expect much flavor out of so few ingredients, but everything really just works. I didn't have chervil, so I substituted dried parsley. The only reason this recipe isn't getting five stars is that they don't keep well overnight. Even sealed in a ziplock bag, they got very tough and chewy.

Easy to make. I had to lower the temp for my oven; so, the first time you make them, be sure to watch them so you can make any adjustments to prevent overcooking.

I used olive oil spray on mine and sprinkled them with Jane's Crazy Mixed-Up salt because that's what I had on hand. Very tasty!

These are so good I ate them plain after I ate all the hummus (hummusIII recipe).  I used whole wheat pitas.  I'm serious..these are super delicious.

Made these to go with spinach dip.  Excellent.  I ommitted the chervil.  My duaghter asks me to make them all the time.  She like them better than potato chips.

Why would anyone buy chips after trying this?  YUM.  It is easy AND cheap.  I can buy a bag of 16 freshly made 8" pitas at a local ethnic grocer for $1.89.  That would make enough for a good party!  Oh, it's easier to split the pita into two rounds, brush each half's inside with olive oil, sprinkle with seasoning(s) THEN cut in wedges.  Goes quicker.

5* with the following changes: 
Only cut pitas in 1/2, then separate pocket halves. 
After halving, brush with olive oil before cutting into triangles.
Can substitute chervil with 1/2 tsp. of parsley & 1/2 tsp. tarragon.
Use coarse salt.
If spices won't stick, use spray oil before sprinkling with remaining spices.
One side is thinner then the other so cook thin ones in 1 batch & thick ones in another batch.
Bake at 350 for 16 min., flipping after 7 to 8 min. to make crispy (not chewy) or they won't keep overnight.

Excellent. I made a few changes to make them a bit easier and crisper. First, separate the layers of the pita's so you get two thinner pieces instead on one thick one. Using a pastry brush, brush on the oil before you cut, makes it much easier! Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut into wedges, then sprinkle with the herbs and seasonings of your choice. You can use those mentioned in the original recipe, or add your own to customize your pita chips to your liking. There is no wrong here. You can even use melted butter (in place of the oil) and cinnamon sugar to make some delicious sweet pita snacks instead of savory! Your imagination is your only limit with this recipe!

My daughter makes Pita chips similar to this, but she sprays each chip with cooking spray and then sprinkles them with Greek seasoning.

I tried it both ways, after cutting them, separating them and not sepatrating them. My conclusion is... separate them if you want crunchier, but keep them together if you have a dip. Also less baking time for the separated one.

Delicious!  Yet another suggestion:  Brush them whole and then simply cut them with a pizza cutter! It certainly beats tediously brushing each triangle. I stacked oiled ones then cut 2 at a time with cutter. Oily counter top, but very fast!

I have recently started making my own pita chips cause I am hooked on Hummus and don't want to spend the money on store bought pita chips. I found the easiest way to do this is to put the whole pita bread on a cookie sheet and brush a small amt. of olive oil on it and then sprinkle with what ever you want..garlic..basil.  salt  pepper. Then with scissors cut the pita in half and cut each half into 8 thin rectangles.  Bake in a 375 oven for about 10 min. but watch so they don't burn.

Very good chips - but take my advice and brush on the ingredients BEFORE you cut them. Saves a lot of time!!

This is a recipe from weight watchers.  I have been making these for years based on the recipe they have published.  They do not have chervil on their recipe. You can put whatever you like on them - an easier tip is to spray the chips, once split and cut, with olive oil spray, then top with whatever you like and bake.  They store well in a zip-lock bag.  I like to make mine "Everything" - dried oniion flakes, poppy &/or sesame seeds/ garlic powder / corse salt / fresh ground black pepper - just like an everything bagel, but on a weight conscience chip!  (Dip into fresh bruschetta or salsa for a very low cal/low point value treat

Easy to make. I split the pitas in half, then cut them into triangles to get more out of the pitas. I sprayed the cookie sheet, placed the pita triangles on there, sprayed them again w/olive oil spray then sprinkled the seasoning to make it 'stick'. They crisped up really nicely. Next time I will try w/whole wheat pitas for an even healthier snack. Thanks.

After experimenting with the pita preparation, I settled on splitting the pitas into the two layers and brushing the herb mix on one side was the best way to go. Leaving them together made something heartier than the light snack I was looking for, and brushing on both sides (even with both layers) left it a little too oily for me. When I make this again, I think I'll double the seasonings with 3/4 cup oil - then it's a bit more concentrated, I thought these proportions were a little weak in flavor. Great seasoning mix - thanks for sharing :)

Super good!  I split the pita slices:  for half, I used seasonings as directed.  For the rest, I brushed on melted butter and sprinkled (heavily) with sugar & cinnamon.  We love these both ways!

As far as healthy chips to dip with these are great!  So, simple to make and tasty!  The first time I made them I did as recipe directs to just cut the pita whole.  These ended up great but a little filling.  The next time I cut  around the perimeter first to make to pita's the are much thinner before cutting into triangles.  I wasn't sure how they would hold up to dipping but they were just as sturdy as the whole ones.  Also, I suggest brushing with oil before cutting into triangles and then just stacking them and cutting the triangles all at once.  Less work and more efficient.  I sprinkled mine just with salt and garlic powder because the herbs called for wouldn't have paired well with dip I was serving.  The other thing that is great about this recipe is that you can season them any way you want to go with what you are serving.  Also, great to munch on plain!  Thanks for the recipe!  Love it!

Well worth the minimal effort they require. We used mini pitas sliced in half to make them extra thin and served them with the hummus III recipe from this website...an excellent combo.

EXCELLENT!!! I have been on a pita chip and hummus kick lately (store bought) and decided to try and make my own. These pita chips are awesome!I didn't use the chervil and added a little parmesean cheese, but other than that stuck to the recipe. I used whole wheat pita's and seperated the pocket and then used a pizza cutter to make the triangles, it does take some time, but so worth it! Also, 7 minutes was perfect for me. It made a ton of chips, I have been paying almost $4 for a bag a 1/4 the size. My pita's were only $1.25 each so not only better than store bought, cheaper too (if you have everything else on hand)!!

I used olive oil, garlic powder, pepper and a bit of salt.
I cut the pitas with a pizza cutter, and seperated the top and bottom layer so that each piece would make 2 chips.

Delish and really easy!  Best to eat them immediatley - they don't save well.  Even after storing in a tupperware container they tasted stale the very next day.

Too much spiced to use for a dipping tool, as the spices on the chips were all we could taste.  Used olive oil PAM spray in place of olive oil, and sprayed the pan and then the bread.  Thanks for sharing

Great basic recipe.  I didn't use basil or chervil because I didn't think it would work well with the sausage dip I had, just garlic salt & pepper, and it turned out delicious.  The great thing about this is once you add the olive oil you can put pretty much any seasoning you'd like and make it work.  I'll definitely be playing with different seasonings and making these again.

We didn't have chervil, so we used a half & half blend of onion powder and marjoram. You could customize this recipe with many different mixes of herbs.

I have been making these for years, and it's always the first thing to go. My boyfriend begs me for them now, and even my Dad who is very suspicious of anything not meat or potatos would eat them all if I let him! 

I use olive oil cooking spray, and just sprinkle on greek seasoning (not sure of the brand, mccormicks I think) I have tried other kinds, but that seems to work the best.  These are great with any kind of dip! I have served them with roasted red pepper dip, hummus, salsa, chicago dip, anything you can imagine!  I also use kitchen scissors to cut up the pitas, it makes it even easier!

VERY GOOD!! I made this using "Peppy's Pita Bread" from this site and these were wonderful!! We ate them with our pasta but would make an awesome appetizer!! Plus, they're sooo easy to make.  Since I kept a good eye on these, I had no problems burning! Thanks Dawn!

I have made this recipe and it is very good. I found I like to cut the pita bread horizonally in half. If you go with a point knife carefully around it is easy. then I cut the pita into 8th. I like the crisper effett.

Call this one 4.5. A winner on many fronts... simplicity, relatively-healthy alternative to other fried chips, fabulous taste result and great flexibility (I'm already conjuring up alternate flavor combos for these.) I made them "as written," (for a recent family dinner appetizer) just sans-chervil, as it is not a staple in my pantry. Served them with humus - delicious! Would also be a awesome with spinach and/or artichoke dip. Thanks for the recipe Dawn!!

Like several other reviewers, I used Olive Oil Pam to save time.  For toppings, I only used a little sea salt and Italian seasoning - that's it!  Baked at 350 for 8 minutes, turn and bake another 8 minutes.  Very crispy. I had tried baking as specified in the recipe but they came out kind of chewy, not really what I was looking for.  Be sure to separate halves of the pitas after cutting. It's wonderful with home made hummus.

These were very tasty. As others have noted, the recipe doesn't clarify if you cut the pita in half lengthwise, and then cut into 8 pieces. I cut the pita itself in half and then 4 pieces each half, so I had double-sided pita chips. As others said, you'll want to cook for 15 minutes, turning once, to get crispy chips. HOWEVER, I think I would have preferred the thinner chips. It's also a good idea to invest in an oil sprayer - if you brush too much of the mixture on the pita, it won't cook off, and any leftover chips will get mushy. I really loved these, though, I will make again! Next time I'll sprinkle with some Parmesan cheese!

These were so easy and WAY better and less expensive than store bought ones.  I won't spend money on pre-made pits chips again! I used wheat and white pita bread, and I found that the white pita bread had a better flavor.

Just did a double batch of these for the 4th - well actually followed the instructions from another reviewer - sprayed with olive oil spray, and sprinkled sea salt, garlic, and parmesan/reggiano cheese on top.  Everyone loved them and they were gone quickly!

These are excellent!  Served these with store bought hummus, but chips were all gone!  I didn't have chervil, so left that out, ran out of garlic salt, so I used garlic powder and added some onion salt.  Also, I don't get how everyone warned to make sure to watch the chips carefully...I baked mine for 10-15 mins (maybe longer) and they still weren't crunchy!  It did however become nice and crunchy.  Thanks, will be making again.

Mmm.... these pita chips were the best and you really do have to watch them carefully to see that they don't burn! A couple of mine got charred around the edges a bit because I wasn't watching. But they were delicous none the less!
I found they taste great dipped in Hummus.

Recipe worked well as submitted.  Only thing I realized is that at the end of the baking time, chips still look like they aren't quite done; actually, mine were.  They crisp up after they come out.  They were amazingly good!

I really liked the texture of these - I halved each pita to make each chip one layer and cut each half into eight wedges.  I used multi-grain pitas.  I misted them with olive oil and used garlic salted, red/black/green peppercorns, and Crazy Jane's Mxed-up Salt. I put them in the toaster over 6-7 and flipped them over.  I gave them another spritz or olive oil and seasonings and put them back in another 4-5 minutes.  Awesome!

This recipe is so fun! You're easily able to make all different kinds of pita chips, and they taste delicious :) The varieties I made were salted, onion and pepper, garlic herb, and parmesan.  I left them in my oven for 7 minutes exactly and they came out perfectly.  I'd love to serve these at a party with some hummus and toum. This recipe makes plenty of pita chips!

These are great! The spices were not too overpowering so they can work with any dip but are also fantastic on their own. I love how easy and healthy they are, especially using whole wheat pitas. So much more satisfying than a bag of store bought chips :)

Excellent! I paired this with the "Extra Easy Hummus" recipe from Donalyn with great results. I had no chervil, but used a smattering of Italian Seasoning (about 1/4 tso) and it worked very well. Pita chips and hummus at a FRACTION of the cost for store bought with all the flavor and zest- no competition. I will be doing this from now on. So long, $4 bag of Stacey's Pita Chips!

I did not use chervil; however, I used dried Italian seasoning, garlic powder instead of the garlic salt and sprinkled the triangles with parmesan cheese before baking - be careful of your oven temp and time and check what works best in your particular oven.

These were very tasty.  One review suggested burshing the oil mixture on before cutting and that made it very easy.  I did have a lot of the oil mixture left over so either I need a lot more bread or a lot less oil.  Other than that, they were de-lish!

Really did turn out like pita chips@  I got bags of wheat pita bread from Trader Joe's for less than 2 bucks each, so it's much cheaper than buying pita chips already prepared from the grocery store.  You absolutely must keep an eye on the chips though because they really burn easily.  I had mine in the oven for 15-20 minutes.  25 minutes turned mines all black.  You can really experiment with the different spices and herbs too.

These are great, I can't stop eating them. I didn't add garlic salt as dips tend to be on the saltier side anyways, I subbed garlic powder instead. I added in oregano and finely chopped parsley. I served these with the Greek dip "htipiti" which I think is called "Tyrokavteri" on this site though the recipe I have is a bit different it seems. Also a note, it seems like a lot of people don't know what CHEVRIL is, it is very similar to PARSLEY, it is a herb commonly found in french cooking. That would be the closest sub to chevril if anyone is wondering.

These pita chips were delicious! I find the store bought ones are often hard and too salty. I like how you can adjust the taste and texture of these.  I made 3 batches in my toaster oven using different combos of salt, basil, chili powder, parmesan, and black pepper. All of them turned out fantastic. This is one recipe I'll definitely be using over and over again.  Thanks.

This was soooooooooo good, I followed the recipe almost as written except for the chervil, didn't have on hand so I took another reviewers advice and used 1/4 t. of onion powder and 1/4 t. of marjoran. Yum! To make cutting the pita pockets eaiser, I used my kitchen shears. Worked so slick. Also, I used onion flavored pitas. Serve with Hummus lll from this site.

These were fantastic!  I added some parmesan cheese and simply used a spray oil instead as another reviewer suggested.  Delicious dipped in hummus!

So delicious, and very versatile. I did half with sea salt and half with parmesan- I can't decide what I like best.

These were a hit in my house! My kids loved them plain, and the rest of us also dipped them in hummus. Excellent either way. I did not have chervil but apparently it is used a lot in French cooking and is really only good if it's fresh. I will be looking for some to see how it tastes, but these were excellent without. I used whole wheat pita bread, and the oil/seasoning mixture was about 2x more than I needed. They also needed to cook about 14 minutes in my oven to crisp.

Very yummy.  I make them in a microwave oven.  I use olive oil cooking spray, and usually make them with parmesan cheese and italian seasoning or garlic powder.  They are also very good with butter flavored spray and cinnamon and sugar, as a low guilt sweet snack or dessert.

These chips were very easy to make, and very good to eat!!!  I brushed the olive oil mixture on the pita bread BEFORE I cut them into wedges, then I seperated the wedges into thinner triangles.  The oil was only on one side but they still tased great. UPDATE: I now use the olive oil in the spray can to make them even easier to make.

I made this for to dip with Greek Feta and Olive Spread, also on this site.  It went great, and the kids loved the pitas!  They ate them and left the dip for the adults!  I'll definately make these for after school snacks or other appetizer dips.

These were easy to prepare -- and a huge hit at my Super Bowl party!  One caution...keep an eye on them in the oven...they REALLY do crisp fast!  Two thumbs up.

These are quick and easy! For a fat free version, I replace the olive oil with butter or olive oil flavored PAM. For the kids, I cover the pita chips with garlic butter and shredded cheese!Makes a great snack!

My family like these pita chips. Every time I do this pita chips I change the spices to have a variation. Olive oil, fresh garlic, Parmesan cheese and parsley are my family's favorite. And when I'm preparing this I put the olive oil and the spices on the pita before cutting into triangles; it's easy to do it this way at least for me. I also make a lot of pita chips to have leftovers and give it to my kids for snack.

I made the recipe exactly as written. (had to go buy the chervil) It's good. But I still prefer 2 changes.  Split the pitas open, it makes for a crispy chip. Be sure to cut back on the cooking time! Also, I had a basting oil with spices already in the oil and my husband preferred it that way. (Wegmans Brand)

Made these mid week to go with pizza instead of my normal homemade potato chips and they were great! Kids and adults loved them and I made homemade Hummus for a dip or ketchup or mayo works well too! I did not have chervil so used dried mixed herbs instead.  I also did not do all the 12 pita pockets and only used 1 pitta pocket per person and found this was plenty as part of a meal! Will be making this recipe again and again! Great idea and delicious straight from the oven!

Easy.  Just use whatever dried herbs you already have.  Naan bread can be used as a substitution for pita bread.

Wonderful recipe. Made these last weekend with whole wheat pita, going to try this weekend with white pita. I will take other reviewers suggestions to brush halves with oil before cutting. Also split the pita for crispier chips.

This was a great recipe to use up a package of pita shells that I found in the freezer.  I made this to go with ‘BLT Dip’, another AR recipe.  I didn’t have dried chervil, so I used dried parsley in its place.  I made a half batch of this recipe and half of 'Perfect Pita Chips', another AR recipe so that we could do a taste comparison.  I took this to card club and came home with an empty platter.  Everyone liked both varieties.

Store-bought would definitely be easier (and maybe cheaper), but what's the fun in that? These are very tasty - perfect for dipping - and all your friends will be impressed!

These are great!  Per other reviewers' suggestions I cut my pita into 8 wedges, split, brushed each one with olive oil, then sprinkled with spice mixture.  I also subbed parsley for chervil.  Good with Smokey Chipotle Hummus!

Really easy and very yummy! If you want your chips to be more crispy, just split the pita and then cut the triangles from those two pieces. Awesome with Hummus III recipe!!

I spray the pita bread with olive oil from a pump oil sprayer and then use kitchen shears to cut the pita into pieces. Once they are cut I add any herbs/spices.

I found this recipe a few years ago and just realized I never reviewed it.  I love this recipe because it's so easy.  I like my pita chips a bit crispier, so I leave them in a few minutes longer.  I serve these with lentil or black bean soup or homemade hummus, and they never last more than a few days.  I like that I can mix it up with different herbs pretty easily.  I've used all sorts of herb mixes on these, and they're always good.

Great with hummus or any dip.  I usually leave out the chervil simply because I don' think it adds much to this great recipe.

Oh my these are good! I will never buy pita chips again!  I didn't have any chevril the first time I made them and they were still wonderful. I mixed all the seasonings together and put them in an empty spice bottle and just sprinkled them over the pita bread pieces after I had brushed the olive oil on them.  When I took them out of the oven, I gave them just a little extra sprinkle of the seasonings and let them cool.  They store great in a ziplock bag, but they don't really last long enough to say I stored them, we made them disappear pretty quickly!  Thanks Dawn, great recipe!!

Very easy and very good.  I find that these last best in a ziploc type bag.  I also find that if you get them really crispy, they will last longer.

I used the spices I liked instead and followed the general idea. I used olive oil, salt, dried parsley and garlic powder. Mixed random amounts with about 3/4-1 cup oil. Cut pita in half, separate the "pocket" so you get four half moons. Brush oil mixture onto one side, stack, cut into triangles with sissors. Bake in a single layer until crispy and browned. Very tasty, salt is important.

These went great with an artichoke/jalapeno dip, and everyone was impressed that they were homemade. I should mention that I did slice all pockets in half, which I will always do from now on - and still cooked for exactly 7 minutes.

The first time I made these I made them as directed, but this time on reading other reviews, I sprayed pitas with pam, added seasonings (I used Italian seasoning on mine), and cut them into triangles with a pizza cutter - much easier. I also used pocketless pitas, they are a little thicker and baked them at 350 F for 10 minutes. These were great with spinach dip.

So easy and much cheaper than store bought.

I used buttermist cooking spray on pitas and then sprinkled the basil, garlic power, and a bit of parmesan cheese on mine.  I also cooked mine a little longer and just kept an eye on them.

Thanks for the quick and easy recipe;)

Great recipe but I made it even easier:  cut pita in half and open/split each into two more.  Spray both sides with cooking spray oil then sprinkle rough side with garlic salt and chili powder.  Bake for 10 minutes, turning over half way through.  Cool and break into chip-sized pieces.  Yum!

Excellent and Easy. I changed the ingredients by substituting rosemary for chervil. I changed the preparation by brushing both sides of the pita, then cutting it into the triangles. Quicker and less absorption of the olive oil. Good with spinach salad.

These were great!  I didn't have any chervil so I used parsley instead.  I did end up burning them a little (it was one of those days) but it didn't matter.  Later on, we covered them with shredded cheese and popped them in the microwave to have nachos!

These are very good.  I did not have any chervil, but they were still very good.  My family couldn't stop eating them, I served them with spinach & artichoke dip.  Will make again.

These are so addictive.  I made whole wheat pitas using a bread machine recipe on this site and used them for pita chips.  I cut them all up and threw them in the freezer so that I can make chips anytime I'm having a craving.

Too salty!  Probably would be better with garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I didn't have chervil and subbed some Italian seasoning.  Other than the saltiness, the flavor was good.

This recipe is so wonderful!  I only used one pita round so I just dribbled on a bit of olive oil, spread it around with my fingers, and sprinkled on the seasonings.  I look forward to playing with the combinations of herbs and spices.  Thanks for sharing!

These were great! I brushed the tops of each one with basil-infused olive oil and then sprinkled each one with fresh ground black peppercorn. I paired them with the  "Hot Artichoke and Spinach Dip II" from this website. They were definitely meant to be together! Thank you for a great recipe. Oh, and these are even great just on their own! I definitely recommend.

These were great on the first day, my kids (8 & 11) took a bowl outside and ate plain. Everyone loved them at the party we took them to. Only problem with mine were that the leftovers got pretty chewy by day 2.

These just came out of the oven. They are tasty. I didn't have any chervil so I just used the other ingredients. The next time I think I'll try some other combos of herbs. The only comment I have is they took about 20 min. in the oven at 400. They are a keeper. Forget the store bought.

Delicious, as expected.  I followed the recipe exactly, and even leftovers were great once heated in microwave for 30 seconds.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I also added parsley, which was perfect.  Thanks!!

Was serving hummus as appetizer to middle eastern main (falafel and kabobs) and realized I didn't have pita chips. Did a quick search at allrecipes and this guy popped up. I did just 24 pieces because I needed pitas for the main, but they turned out really well. If you do the full 12 pitas, yielding 96 pieces, you'll need multiple cookie sheets and repeat batches. I think sprinkling the herbs would have added more flavor, but they were very good and the guests gobbled them up. Will make again with varied spices just to mix it up. A package of 12 pitas costs only $1.39 at the produce market I go to, so it's hard to beat the price on these homemade treats. Way better quality and super convenient -- especially if you keep a package of the pitas in the freezer, just thaw, oil, and bake. So easy in a pinch.

I make these all the time with my own recipe, but its basically the same.  I cut the pita and brush with olive oil, rosemary, basil, and sprinkle with ground sea salt and bake.  these are so yummy!  im actually making them tonight for a party! :)  yummy!!!  you really can't go wrong. just keep a close eye on the chips in the oven since they can burn easily.

These were very yummy.  I made them for a picnic and they made my boyfriend and I smile.  I used whole wheat pita and sprayed them with olive oil non-stick cooking spray, for an even healthier version.  I sprinkled them with parmesan cheese and garlic.

Love it! I mixed olive oil, garlic powder, pepper and brushed them on both sides whole.  I stacked them and then cut them into triangles.  I put them on a cookie sheet and sprinkled them with grated parm and baked them for 5 minutes and then flipped them and baked for another 3 minutes.

This was a FABULOUS recipe ! And easy to boot. I did take the suggestions of a couple of the reviewers and split the pita to get a thinner 'chip' and another reviewers suggestion to use olive oil cooking spray then sprinkle on the herbs and salt. I ran out of garlic salt (discovering it 3 minutes after coming home from getting the pita bread) so improvised and made my own with garlic powder and grey sea salt, 25% salt 75% garlic powder. No chervil ? Another clever reviewer said to use 1/2 parsley 1/2 tarragon !! I'll never buy the greasy bagged pita chips again, not to mention I used whole wheat pita, so my 'is-it-good-for-you' meter was in the 'YES-it-is zone'. Thank you so much for posting this Dawn !

These were fairly easy to make, and came out delicious. I used a bit more oil than it suggests, and created a spice mixture including minced garlic and white pepper. I suggest baking them at the back of the oven, and rotating them once in a while so that they cook evenly. Mine were a TAD soft and chewy in the very middle, but only some. That was my fault. Otherwise, as I said, delicious pita chips. My middle eastern family approves!

Great base recipe.  I like to mix parmasean with the oil before brushing the squares, then I sprinkle with spices and dried herbs.  When pairing with hummus I sprinkled with dill, garlic powder and fresh cracked black pepper.  When pairing with spinach artichoke dip I sprinkle with garlic powder, onion powder, basil and pepper.  yum!  I found they took longer than the recipe called for(about 10 mins), but I think the pitas I'm using are thicker and don't have a pocket.

This was amazing. Such a great idea for left over pita chips and with hummus. Yummmy. I used just garlic salt, pepper, and a Italian infused EVOO. It did take a bit longer (10-14 minutes) but worth it. Crunchy and chewy!

Very good flavour, but began to burn at 3 minutes. I'd turn down the heat next time and let them bake a little longer.

This was great! So easy, thanks reviewers for the tips on baking and cutting and oiling. My first batch did not crisp enough, so the next day I just put them back in the oven again for six minutes and that made them perfect. My daughter loves the cinnamon and sugar kind.

Yummy!  I used sandwich thins 100% whole wheat by BrownBerry!  They did burn at 7 minutes, I think 5 minutes would have worked better!  Make my homemade pita chips and hummus!!! That will be awesome!

I can't always find chervil, and use dried parsley instead. These are great with everything, but they are my go-to accompaniment to the hot spinach and artichoke dip recipe on this site. The only modification I make is that I always use fresh minced garlic (lots) and add a dash of salt instead of using garlic salt.

These were fantastic, cut them thin and you will get that wonderful crunch. The seaonings can easily be changed for more variety, but this combination is outstanding and would go well with hummus. Thanks for sharing!

Mine just didn't turn out all that great--I don't think I'd bother making them again.  They were too thick and dry--the store bought ones taste so much better.

It took me about 3/4 cups of olive oil to cover every wedge on both sides. Instead of garlic salt, I only put garlic powder. The chips were lightly salted after 7 minutes in the oven. Then were baked until the surface turned golden brown. Bake thin and thick chips separately is a good tip.

These were excellent!  I am going to cut down on the salt portion a bit next time, maybe 1/2 tsp garlic salt and 1/2tsp garlic powder...but otherwise, very good.

I have made a version of these e chips for a few years. I have always used butter instead of olive oil.  I always slip them in half as well because I like my chips a little thinner.  Also I just use garlic salt for a seasoning

These were awesome!  And simple to make!  I used dried parsley instead of the chervil, and fresh basil from my garden.  I sliced the pitas like pizzas, so each chip had two layers.  They were done in a little more than 7 minutes, though I did turn them over halfway.  Yum!

Great recipe!  I actually like thin chips, so I first cut each pita circle around the edge with scissors, and divide the circles into 2 rounds.  I follow the balance of the directions, also adding some sesame seeds and change the spices as desired, depending what I am serving them with for the dip.  I bake WHOLE rounds, and when baked, cool and then break into random pieces. These are always a hit with Baba Ghanoush.

My husband and I love these things! I prefer to split whole wheat pitas in 2 then slice each half into 8 triangles. Rubbed one side only with olive oil (before cutting into wedges) and then sprinkled with spices. So good! Thanks!

These were great and had a wonderful flavor to them.  I'm not sure why the recipe calls for so much olive oil though, as I could have used the left over oil/seasoning mixture to make another batch or two!

These were delicious.  I would also suggest that for easier handling that you cut the whole pita in half and brush with the oil mixture before cutting into wedges.

These were so good.  I didn't change anything.  Even my pickiest eaters ate them.  It didn't really tell you how to cut the pita so I cut them in triangles and cut them in half for a thinner chip.  Spice was perfect.

Fabulous! I prefer keeping the thickness of the pita, so I don't separate the sides. This is so fast - just spread the rounds with the olive oil & spices, and then cut into 8 narrow wedges. 7 minutes in the oven was perfect, and they were ready to eat almost instantly.

These turned out pretty good.  I used whole wheat pitas.  I brushed the front and back of the pitas with the oil mixture before I cut them into wedges.  I found that the bake time was a little off.  I ended up baking them for about 15 minutes.  I then turned off the oven and slightly opened the oven door.  I left the chips in the warm oven for about 10 minutes before serving.  They turned out crisp and delicious!

To JILLYBEAN14: use your pizza cutter, and cut the pitas pizza-wise into 8 wedges. Pitas are 2 layers; separate the layers and you have 16 chips to put in the oven. One side is thicker than the other, so either bake the thin ones and thick ones in their own batches (so the thin ones don't burn and the thick ones get crispy) or put the thick ones on the outside edge and crowd the thin ones in the middle (a good way to do a smaller batch, but watch them carefully). I like whole wheat pitas, but any way you like them they're good with dips & spreads!

The chips were edible but didn't stand out. The recipe didn't mention exactly how to cut the pita pockets, so i made them two ways: 1. slit the pockets in half and then cut it into 8 wedges 2. Just cut it into 8 wedges. I felt the second option worked better, but it took a little more than 15 minutes at 400F and i turned it over once. Next time I will try increase flavor by adding some chilli powder to the recipe. Will have to work around this recipe a bit to make it more interesting

Really good.  Very easy, but does take a bit of time to run various batches through the baking time.  I followed the recipe as written, but also put some freshly ground salt over them before baking.

It was good as-is to go with something where the dip is the main attraction.  Otherwise, would consider playing with the spices to get more punch.

Amazing! I had some.. old.. pita bread left over in the fridge. I'm in college and hate to waste food, and this put that old pita bread to good use. I really like pita chips from the store, but its always so oily to me. I loved these because they're so easy to make and I can go light with the oil.

Love these! I make them at least once a week. I use a spray olive oil (kind of like PAM no-stick spray, except it is only olive oil) on the pitas, which makes it so easy to coat the pitas evenly and lightly. I usually just sprinkle with freshly ground pepper and salt. Awesome alone or with hummus. I've even sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar for a dessert.

The flavor of these chips was yummy, but I had an issue figuring out how to cut them into the 8 triangles like the recipe states. I left them as pockets and cut it like a pie. The finished chips were great straight out of the oven, but became chewy after sitting for just a short period of time. This is why it didn't get 5 stars from me, but I think next time I will try and separate the pocket and make thinner chips. I dipped the chips in dill dip and it was great!

OMG made these a long time ago to go with homemade hummus.  Followed the directions exactly including finding the elusive chervil.. didn't *still don't* know what that is.  But don't leave it out!  And don't try to skip steps by just brushing with oil then topping with spices.  Doesn't work to skip that important step.  FABULOUS one big hit at a party with hummus!  YUMMY!

These chips turned out nicely crisp and seasoned. I left out the chervil and served them with homemade hummus. Excellent alternative to regular pita bread.

Tasted great, but I used a lemon flavored olive oil to give it an extra kick.

3 year old and DH like theses alot, I did the recipe as required but did add and extra bit of parmesan cheese to the oil mixture. I used mini pittas and did oil them whole and then cut them. Only problem I would say would be that it might be an idea to cut the pittas in half horizontally as they can be kind thick. And then of course you would need to reduce the cooking time and make sure they don't burn.

Easy, yummy, healthier than store-bought, and you can try all sorts of different herb mixtures. I will never look at Pita the same way again. (I didn't have Chervil, so I omitted it, and they were still delicious.)

I changed the spices as most people did, to garlic salt, onion powder, pepper and bit of smoked paprika. Mine took much longer in the oven, something more like 13-15 minutes...but my oven sometimes runs cool.
Tasty, much cheaper than store bought, and it allows you to keep out the preservatives and use wheat pitas.

I didn't have ANY of these spices, so I used thyme, garlic and sea salt.  Still VERY good!

I was trying to figure out what to do with a bag of flat bread I mistakenly picked up last week.  I followed this recipe and it worked for flat bead too!!  I followed the receommendations to brush both sides first, stack and cut with pizza cutter.  Easy, quick and yummy!!

These were totally addicting! They had the perfect crunch and just enough flavor. Better than store-bought! For the ideal crispiness, make sure to cut them open so you have two round pita halves. If you make them this way, you also get more chips out of it!

I just made these chips & like everyone else who said they were delicious, I agree. I used whole-wheat pitas & didn't use chervil & they tasted wonderful. A big thanks to whoever first posted to brush the oil on the pitas before cutting them.

These were pretty tasty. I didn't have any chervil, or garlic salt. I ended up using plain garlic powder instead. My batch was smaller than the recipe's amount of servings, so I just eyeballed the measurements to taste. It took about 10 minutes in a preheated 400 degree oven for my chips to get browned.

I made these chips to use in fatoosh (salad recipe from this site).  I didn't have a lot of success tossing the pita bread with the oil and seasonings as some suggested.  I ended up brushing each cut up piece.  Next time I want to try brushing each side of the split pita and then cutting it up.

Excellent recipe.  Yum !  I brushed my pita triangles with olive oil intended for basting in that it was already infused with herbs.  I added extra dried basil & a sprinkle of sea salt to each triangle.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Yum! I didn't have chervil so I was heavy-handed with the other spices. Came out nice and crispy after 8 minutes, and were great dipped in hummus. So much fresher and better-tasting than store-bought!

fabulous!  I left out chervil and used italian seasoning instead of basil.  They were wonderful!  Don't be afraid to be a little heavy handed with the mixture, especially on wheat pitas - they need all the flavor on there.  Seven minutes was perfect timing.

Just delicious. I baked them a bit longer for crispiness .Invested in a bottle of Chervil, not cheap but it won't go to waste, because I'll be making these all the time with my hummus.

These were very good.  I think I over cooked them just a touch.  After applying the oil mixture I sprinkled the chips with more garlic powder, cause I love garlic and a little salt just before baking.

This recipe is GREAT! I have made it three times now and every gathering I take it to, they get gobbled up instantly! I followed the recipe exactly, but I would also recommend adding a tablespoon or two of parmesan cheese, it adds a nice flavor. The chervil is a great spice. I found it alphabetized as a "D" for "dried chervil leaves." I don't think I'll ever buy pre-packaged pita chips again.

These were really good!!  Played around with the seasonings a bit (didn't have chevril) and I split them in half so I cut the cooking time a little so they didn't burn...got raves from everyone!  No one could believe they weren't store bought!  I think they are better!  No need to spend a mint on Pita chips ever again...thanks for an awesome recipe!

WHOAA these are addictive!!  I didn't have chervil so I didn't use that but mmmmmmmmmm, no one could keep these out of their mouths!  They were extremely simple to make and a good "healthy" alternative to chips.  Will be making this probably on a regular basis for snack foods.  DELICIOUS!  Thanks for the fab recipe.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but mine weren't crispy at all.  They were kind of chewy - they tasted good, but the texture wasn't what I was looking for.  Next time I think I'd use the cooking spray to lighten up the olive oil.  The taste was good though.

These are wonderful!  I cut the pockets in half to make a lighter, thinner version, a little tricky as they tend to break, but crunchier.  You can skip the oil for a lighter version.  My favorite topping is kosher salt and curry powder, great with hummus or eggplant dip!  Thanks, Dawn.

I had seen pita chips in the store, and knew they were becoming popular.  WELL instead of heading to the store for them before a poker party I was going to, I decided to just make this recipe.  Someone else brought the bagged ones from the store...and MINE were the only ones touched!!!  Everyone preferred MINE!  SO HA!  This recipe rocks.  I subbed Grapeseed oil (what I had on hand), Johnny's seasoning, Italian Seasoning, & pepper.

These are great!  I made a batch yesterday for a dinner party, and everyone loved them.  I'm going to make more tomorrow!  I recommend using the thinner pita bread as opposed to the thicker bread.  I made some of each, and the thinner pita chips were far better.

Made these according to the recipe and everything turned out just great.  Didn't have any problem with burning but I did watch them carefully as several others suggested.

One note:  You could probably use 1/3 cup of oil or even 1/4 cup instead of the suggested 1/2 cup.  I had plenty left over.  May also be just as easy to brush on the oil and then "pinch" or sprinkle the spices.

All in all....very good recipe idea.  Thanks.

Never could find chevril. Used lots of garlic powder, salt and Italian Seasoning instead.  Loved the seasoned taste.  Make sure you toast this long enough as one batch wasn't toasted well and came out gummy.  Overall GREAT recipe.

This recipe is way too much drama in prep. I just used a pizza cutter and made bite size squares, and then threw everything into a plastic freezer bag, shook it all up and poured it out to a pan and into the toaster oven. Just shake and bake and toss or recycle the bag when done, nothing uneven and no clean up.

Changed a few things about this recipe.  Did not use chervil or dried basil.  Just used fresh garden basil. Baked for only 6 minutes - separated the triangles in half as well. That probably explains why less baking time was needed.  Wonderful flavors and a party favorite.

Thanks so much for this fantastic idea- they are completely  addictive!! I separated the pita into its 2 halves then brushed on flavoured olive oils ( I made these mixtures in little bowls, all containing olive oil, sea salt and black pepper. I added garlic powder to one, cumin and corriander powders to another and basil and zaatar to the other.) I just threw in spices and oil according to taste and after brushing on oil, I cut into triangles.
baked thin and thick chips separetaly. I turned over the thick ones for about one minute. Baked each batch between 7-9 mins, but keep on checking...
they are truly divine and will be a keeper recipie :))

This recipe was easy to make. Since I like the Stacy's sea salt flavor pita chips,  I opted to just use olive oil and sea salt...yum!

I made these to go with my jalepeno cilantro hummus. I didn't have chervil so I omitted the basil as well and used Italian seasoning I had. I cooked them for 12 minutes and they started to brown a bit but were crunchy. I've made these a few times now. Super easy!

I make this will almost every meal but I only make them a tiny bit crispy so they can be used in the meal with rice, sauce, chicken, pasta, anything! I also don't bother using the chervil, still so good!

This was really easy. I used 5 pitas and cut them each into 8 triangles. I used a pizza cutter to cut them. I used fresh garlic, italian seasoning, sea salt, black pepper, and 1/2 cup olive oil. I followed the temp & time and baked on a clay bakers tray. They turned out great! I broiled them for a bit too just to brown them more. I would like to make these and freeze to take to the cottage. Has anyone tried freezing them for later?

I wanted some pita chips while at the store and a bag of stacy's pita chips were 6.69.  Really?  So I bought a bag of pita bread for 69 cents.  I made this exactly as stated and was a thousand time happier.  I saved six bucks and these were really great warm out of the oven.  I can't believe I actually had Chervil :)

Received many compliments. I have also tried with whole wheat pitas, but the flavor gets masked by the whole wheat flavor. I would again use white pittas for guests. Delish!

I liked these! I was looking for ways to use up some pita bread I had, and this was perfect. I don't have a brush, so I just drizzled the oil over the pita triangles, and then sprinkled the seasoning. (not the chervil, I don't have any). Thanks, Dawn.

Seriously delicious pita chips. Had to leave in a lot longer than 7 minutes (even in a pre-heated 400 degree oven) to get them to be lightly brown and crunchy. My husband loves them too!

WHOOPS!! I had 2 large baking sheets of chips in the oven and they burnt to a black crisp! I never do that! These need to be watched closely and 5 minutes is pleanty! Luckily we had tacos the night before and had some flour shells left over and they worked great! Very good with Buffalo Chicken dip from this sight. Making these again tonight to top off a taco salad for dinner. These are so easy the kids will make them next time. These will be a regular from now on!

Loved this with some cucumber sauce. I used flat bread, although I'm not 100% sure the difference, the recipe picture looks like flat bread not pita bread. I didn't have any chervil, but this came out great and I'll definately do it again.

Instead of olive oil and the rest of the ingredients,  I sprinkled over my pita chips with garlic oil and omitted the salt.  It was yummy with the Pineapple Chicken Salad I made to go with it!!

Excellent chips!  I  made these last weekend for a Christmas party.  Instead of cutting the pitas into wedges, I used metal cookie cutters & cut them into holiday shapes -- trees, holly leaves, snowmen, stars, bells, & gingerbread men.  They were a BIG hit!  I'd suggest leaving the salt out of the oil mixture, and instead sprinkling on a little kosher salt just before baking -- you'll get a more even and controlled coverage.

To make this even easier, I purchase whole wheat pita breads.  Then I cut them into pieces about 1 1/2" x 1 1/2".  Split the pieces into two. Spray a pan with olive oil spray.  Lay the pieces out.  Spray them with olive oil spray and then dust them with popcorn salt (very fine grained salt).  Bake at 350 for 6 minutes. Wonderful! and healthy!

Very good pita chips. I made hummus to go with it, which created an ideal appetizer. I do reccomend that you use more olive oil. Make sure you serve it the same day you baked it or else they'll stale.

These were delicious! Unlike packaged chips, you can put only as much of the oil mixture on as you want to. I guess you could use parsley if you don't have chervil, but my roommate had some and she said it is better, so I used it. I only had one pita pocket left over from falafels a few weeks before, so I cut it up into pretty small pieces, 3 trays worth for my little toaster oven, to be exact. Actually I bought my toaster oven at a thrift shop so it didn't come with a tray. I made my own out of a piece of aluminum foil turned up at the edges. These little pieces are good for salad.

So good! I cut the pitas into 6 pieces (without splitting the two halves), which resulted in large, thick chips that were delicious! I just used olive oil, garlic salt, and Italian seasoning. Served with roasted garlic hummus. Yum!

Wonderful. I made them with a Moroccan Carrot Dip and they turned out well. The only change I made was adding rosemary in for the chervil; that's why I withhold the last star. I don't know anyone who keeps chervil in their cupboard!

I guessed on the spices.  I stored the chips in one of those veggie fresh ziplocs and they were still crispy the next day, but they did seem kind of stale.  Definitely at their best right out of the oven!

I made these the other day with the restaurant style spinach dip also on this site. They were a huge hit. Even my sister who hates all chips loved them. I used rosemary and oregano, a little dash of onion powder and garlic powder and seasoning salt because I didn't have any garlic salt on hand. Very very yummy!

These were good. I omitted the chervil because I didn't have any one hand. These came out just as good as the ones you buy at the store and if you increase the basil and reduce the salt you don't even miss the salt. Healthy and tasty!

I liked these, but I should of used regular olive oil like the recipe called for. I used EVOO and it was too overpowering. Otherwise, these are good pita chips. Even my picky 11 year old enjoyed them.

I made these with a spinach-artichoke dip for 2 parties, and they were the hit of the party. People didn't seem to understand how simple the chips were to make! I used whole wheat pita bread once and white pita bread once, and they both turned out wonderful. I didn't use the chevril, because I don't have it, but it turned out fine without it. The only variation was the cooking time-I turned it to broil for a few minutes to make them brown and crispy.

I had some extra pita bread lying around and thought I'd try this recipe.  Absolutely delicious!  One reviewer stated they became tough and chewy overnight, but I did not have this problem - it depends on how crispy they are out of the oven.  If you leave them slightly soft, they will become chewy the next day.  Will make these again!

these were so good. hubby and i ate almost the whole batch. i made easy greek yogurt cucumber sauce (from this site)to dip them in and the combo was great. i applied the olive oil mixture before cutting as another reviewer suggested. i used a pastry brush and then cut the pitas w/ my kitchen shears instead of a knife. it made the process quick and easy. it took me 12 mins to fully crisp them up. i will know to double this recipe for company in the future since they went pretty quickly.

Family went nuts about these. Extra yummy while still warm. I played a bit with the ingredients and added paprika, changed garlic salt to powdered garlic and kosher salt. We preferred them thinner vs thick so sliced them further down than originally posted in directions. Excellent!   Have since played a bit with these and use like croutons in salad. Make Mexican flavored (dried cilantro, cumin ) for taco salad and have used with the super gyro steak salad recipe on here. I cut in thin strips before baking. Absolutely look wonderful on salad as a crunchy garnish. Of course, we still make often as above for hummus dip.

Turned out great - at first they were not getting crispy after 10 minutes in the oven, but they hardened right up after I pulled them out to cool.  Thanks!

Phenomenal.  I subbed cajun seasoning for the chevril to go with spinach dip.  Agree with other reviewers that they become tough the next day, but they reheat quite nicely in a 400 degree oven after just a couple minutes.

I've been making these quite often after I found the recipe. I've served them with white bean dip in the past and today we had them for lunch with tuna salad.  I usually only a 1/4 c. olive oil to save on calories.  My husband and I love them.  Thanks for the great recipe:)

I thought these were very good!  I didnt have garlic salt so I used garlic powder and some sea salt. They were very good but too garlic-y... probably bc I used garlic powder.  So next time I make them I will use less garlic powder or use garlic salt.  Yum!

These were unreal! Made them last night to go alongside some falafel sandwiches and they were a hit with both me and my boyfriend! I used less pita bread and the same amount of the topping called for in the recipe so they had a kick and were extra flavorful. Yum!

These were good, and I really needed to use up some pita bread I had, but I would rather just buy a bag of pita chips next time...easier and in the long run taste better

Just made this today for lunch, along with the recipe for "Simple Hummus" found on this site.  The chips were wonderful!  We did a bunch without separating the halves, so we had a chip that was crispy on the outside and chewy within.  Wonderful!

I've made this with olive oil and kosher salt, not the other spices. It's delicious with hummus! The great thing is that it's so easy to make.

I'm never going to eat plain chips again! These are so much tastier and easy to make. I made half really crispy and half a little softer and my guests ate them all and made me cook more:) Both were equally as good. Thanks Dawn!

I really don't have a clue what all the fuss is with this recipe!  I made a special trip to the store to buy "chervil" - had no clue what that was?  Anyway, although very easy to make they really didn't have much flavor at all and didn't appeal to anyone at the party I took them to.  More garlic?  More herbs?  I have no clue.  Wouldn't make it again.  Sorry

I used Italian seasoning instead of chervil because I didn't have any.  Awesome!!  Next time, I will try it with olive oil spray to cut down on calories and fat.

Everyone LOVES these chips! At work parties they're always the first thing gone. My husband loves them too. Do heed the advice to watch them carefully. They will burn very quickly. Exellent recipe!

Yumm....I separated each pita into 2 pieces. My latest method is to pour some olive oil onto a plate, lay 1 of the pieces cut side down onto oil, quickly remove, and put it back together w/other half. I finish all the others, dipping one and then putting both of the cut sides together. I separate and lay face up on cookie sheet(ran out of parchment so used plain cookie sheet) Sprinkled with whatever seasoning I feel like at the time. Use plain old season salt the most. Cut into smaller pieces and bake. I put the "thin" half on one sheet and the "thick" ones on another. I usually turn once also. I put them onto a paper towel as soon as done as I am sure mine have more oil than using a pastry brush.

These were delicious and a big hit at the office.  Gone within an hour.  I did split the triangles and substituted italian seasoning for the chevril.  A coworker asked for the recipe and is making them for a party this weekend!

I got 12 chips out of each pita pocket, so 10 pitas was plenty for a party of 20. No idea what chervil would add to the flavor.

I cut the pitas into long strips and then halved them.  Also, I used Italian seasoning instead of chervil.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  Came out perfectly.  Highly recommended.

These are amazing.  The pita chips at the market are hard and tasteless so my son tried these. We made them 2 days in a row because both my granddaughters loves them. My husband said he preferred them to chips. The second batch he added cumin about 1/2 tsp. We are trying the everything recipe next!!!

These pita chips were so good and so simple to make. You can really use whatever spices you like. My daughter loved them and said they were way better then the store bought pita chips.  Will be making these regularly

I have put this in my bag of tricks,for last minute get together's  and if you don't have Chervil  do not sweat it
use thyme and oregano instead.

These are fabulous! And so easy to make. I like that I can flavour them the way I like, and they are wonderful with home made humus! I ended up using my air fryer instead of the oven, which worked like a charm! They have stayed crispy and delicious for a couple of days now, but won't last much longer as I can't stop nibbling them! I will be making these regularly as a much healthier and tastier alternative to potato chips. Thanks for posting!

Brought these to a St. Patrick's Day dinner and everybody loved them! They're dense but not heavy tasting and the icing was very light. I cut the powdered sugar amount by half and they were plenty sweet enough!

very good.  I sprayed my pita chips with oil instead of brushing it on and just sprinkled with salt.  Left out all the other herbs.  Very good. We are enjoying them with hummus

Delicious and a good way to use up leftover pita shells. Instead of brushing the oil on, I mixed all the ingredients (except salt) in a bowl and then dumped all the pita pieces in and coated that way. After putting them on the baking sheet, I sprinkled with coarse sea salt.  I used garlic  powder rather than garlic salt so I could use the coarse sea salt.

For me I thought it was a waste of pitas, the pitas were soggy, so i pulled them apart put them back in the oven for a couple minutes to get them a little crunchier, the olive concoction was just a waste of a couple spices, too bland. Sorry this was not for me.

I first baked it at 400 degree and the pita got brown quickly but when I tried it, the center of the chip was a little chewy.  So I dropped the oven temp to 300 and baked the subsequent batches at a lower temp and much longer, about 25 mins.  The chips are crispy and it keeps well.  Third day in a ziplock bag and still crispy.  Baking longer allows the chip to get dehydrated.  Thought I mention it since I saw several reviews saying it doesn't keep well past a day.

This recipe was very easy to follow. The only problem I had was the thickness after making the recommended cuts. I ended cutting lengthwise for thinner and crisper chips. I baked both thick and thin ones, and they were equally tasty. For spices, I opted for the traditional Middle East style using a liberal amount of fresh Za'atar with oil. The wild thyme and sumac add a tarty, thyme-oregano flavor, with a nutty punch from the ground sesame seeds. I buy my Za'atar mix online. Their blend has the finest flavor as they use high quality ingredients with zero fillings like ground wheat or peanuts. Good Za'atar blend is hard to find. There is always something missing. Either the amount of sumac, sesame seeds and zaatar herb is low in the blend or the quality is poor. You need to make sure the spice blend mainly contains these three mainstay ingredients.

This is a delicious, quick and easy bread to make. It is great for dipping into hummus, but also to serve with chicken salad . I did not gave chervil so I used basil and it was wonderful.

Turned out perfectly.  The whole family loved them, even picky hubby!  I cut the pita in half then split open for thinner chips.  Spread oil mixture on larger pieces before slicing into triangles.  Omitted basil, since we would be using these in dip, and baked each side for 5-7 minutes at 350 degrees.  The first batch at 7 minutes was a little darker, but not burned, so I took the second batch out at 5 minutes.  Both had perfect crispiness and taste.  Thanks for the recipe!

Mix the olive oil with several spices I prefer to a whole pita then cut.  Way easier. Never measure and I use recipes as guide and add what I like.

Excellent recipe, and so easy! I used whole wheat pitas. I didn't have chervil, so I used parsley instead, and didn't change any of the other ingredients. These definitely do burn quickly - I turned my oven down to about 365 degrees, and they browned up nicely in 7 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe - this is a keeper!

I would open up the pita and then cut them.  Make them thinner and crispier. And I couldn't find chevril in the grocery store so I used parsley.  Tasted good!

Very easy.  I used flatbread, sprayed with olive oil, sprinkled the seasonings and baked on parchment paper for 8 minutes.  Turned out perfect.  I can't wait to try other seasonings.  I think butter with cinnamon sugar will be next.

This is a great recipe which I got longtime ago so this is a remake/re-submission of an old recipe.  However, I used oregano and added parmasean cheese and it was fantastic.

Spraying the chips with olive oil cooking spray and then seasoning them afterwards will save a lot of calories.  Just 1 tablespoon of olive oil has 119 calories.  There are EIGHT tablespoons in 1/2 cup!!

Perfect with any mix of herbs and cheese (I used parmesan). They can be used with dips, cheese fondue etc. Just a perfect quick, cheap snack!!! Loved it!!!!!!!

Awesome chips! They're also a snap to make. I didn't use chervil and made my own garlic salt (3 parts salt to 1 part garlic powder). I used slightly large whole- wheat pita pockets so they needed longer baking time to be crispy. Once they were they were awesome with the spinach dip I served them with!

I made these yesterday for a large party. 1 batch was wheat and 1 was regular. I followed someone's suggestion to use the olive oil spray and they turned out great. I didn't add the chervil since I didn't have any on hand. These chips are a great snack, I just love them and they went over well!

MMMM.  We love these.  We make them to go with homemade baba ganouch or hummus on this site.  But, I tried to store them overnight one time and that didn't work out.  So we make them fresh when we want to gobble them up.  My pizza stone works great for these.

Either the temperature is too high, or the cooking time too long because both of my batches were almost burnt. This resulted in minimal flavour. I used large pitas (not separated), olive oil and a Parmesan-herb blend. I think this would fair better baked at a lower temperature, and possibly cooked longer. Will try that with my next batch. These are also great with processed cheese spread, garlic butter, or cinnamon-sugar if you're looking for some variety.

I loved these. I actually change it up a little each time I make it. One time I used butter and cinnamon sugar (DELICIOUS, especially with vanilla ice cream) I used Santa Maria seasoning, feta cheese, parmesan cheese, everything I could think of. The reason I'm only giving it two stars is because if you save them for the next day, they end up chewy.

I did not use basil or chervil, but added parsley and Parmesan cheese. I cooked about 7 minutes on each side to make them extra crispy.  Served with Garlic Spread from this site and they were a hit together. :) Plus, they still tasted great the next day!

A simple alternative if you cant get Pita, or if its overpriced, as it is, where I live. I substituted Pita bread with regular sliced bread. I used a rolling pin to roll it flat, brushed both sides with the olive oil mix and baked it - turned out better than when I last did it with Pita as the bread turned out uniformly thick. Good, cheap, tasty option!

I've been looking for a recipe to make my own pita chips and found this one!  It's great but like most of the others I do make changes.  In addition to salt and just a small grinding of pepper, I also add garlic salt, garlic powder and fresh crushed garlic.  I guess I love garlic and they smell delicious baking too!

So easy, and so great!  I throw some in the oven while cooking to have as an appetizer.  It goes great with the Artichoke & Spinach Dip Restaurant Style recipe on AllRecipes, or even the triangles of Laughing Cow cheese.

Used this as a base recipe for cinnamon sugar pita chips.  Used leftovers from homemade pita (Peppy's pita bread), double quartered pita bread, lightly covered with olive oil (about 2 tbsp for 2 pita), heavy on the cinnamon and sugar and a touch of salt.  Baked at 350 for about 7 minutes.  REsults: crunchy and slightly chewy sweet/salty bites. Thanks!

Fantastic! I lightly brushed some olive oil on the pita. (I used much less than 1/2 cup in total - but next time I will just spray the pita with PAM). I sprinkled it with zaatar seasoning and placed the pitas on the grill for 4 minutes per side. It was a great with our BBQ dinner!

Quick, Easy and tasty. I added a little more garlic, onion power and used parsley instead of Chervil since that is what I had on hand. Will make these again. It was a great way to use up left over pitas.

Opened the pita up and cut in half. Dredged the halves through the seasoned oil mixture then cut into wedges.  Baked 5 minutes on one side, turned them over and baked 5 more minutes on that side. After dredging in the oil, allow pita to drip, when the oil heats up in the oven it will get runny so be prepared to drain the cookie sheet or have a pan underneath the sheet to catch any oil that might spill over.  They vanish and those that don't still keep well in a plastic bag. Yum! Yum!  Thanks for a great recipe!

MUCH better than store-bought!!  i keep it healthy by spraying the whole pita on both sides with olive oil spray, then sprinkle garlic powder, seasoned salt,ground black pepper and a pinch of cayenne (adds a nice spicy contrast to the usually mild hummus) on both sides before cutting into small bite-sized chips and baking until crisp (usually about 10 minutes at 400 degrees).  just keep an eye on them 'cause they do burn easily!

These were delicious!  I left out the chevril, as I could not find it in the grocery store or in the multicultural supermarket.  I brought them to a Super Bowl Party and they were gone in 15 minutes!  I would definitely make these for a party when you don't have much time.  I cut them like a pie, but had to flip them once...

Love black pepper and garlic salt so these are right up my alley. Didn't have any chervil so I skipped that otherwise made as written. Great for using up pita that's getting stale.

I made these pita chips for the Artichoke Spread recipe on this site. I would say this recipe is just average but I haven't looked around for a better one yet. I'll have to experiment, but it'll do in a pinch.

These were very good, but a little too salty for me. Next time, I'll either reduce the garlic salt or won't put the herbs/spices on both sides of the chip. I'll separate the pitas too, so they're not as thick.

After reading the other reviews, I made the following changes - used olive oil cooking spray, sprayed pita bread on both sides before I cut the triangles.  I sprinkled the seasonings on the bread (both sides), and spritzed a little more olive oil spray. Then I cut and separated the triangles and baked as directed. Next time I will use garlic powder instead of garlic salt because the flavor stands on its own.

Excellent. I did a variation on these in that I used PAM Olive Oil Cooking Spray and it worked extremely well, gave it all that great olive oil flavour anyways. I didn't have chervil and I used regular table salt instead of garlic salt. 6 minutes was a perfect time. I'm so pleased with how delicious they are. And also to kick up the flavour a notch, I used olive oil pita pockets not just plain ones.

These are great.  I keep it simple, whole wheat pitas sprayed with butter flavored Pam and sprinkled with sea salt.  I cut the pita in half, slide a pizza cutter into the half and split the pita...I don't like thick pita chips. Always served with our fav hummus (Curried Hummus on allrecipes).

Great recipe; had some leftover pita bread and didn't want to waste it.  No brush to be found so I just quickly dipped the triangles in the olive oil; used soul seasoning and some garlic powder.  At first I thought the chips were not done, but they got crispier as they cooled. This is worth making without leftover bread.

Easy and delicious. I halved this recipe and used parsley instead of the chervil. I served with a jalapeno dip, but these would have been just as good without the dip as they have just enough flavor to stand on their own. The only general change I plan to make going forward is to use less garlic salt. I look forward to mixing up the spices and experimenting with this recipe.

Delicious. Served these with guacomole (forget about the tortilla chips), just amazing. Only problem is they are addictive. I didn't have chevril, and substituted parsley instead, and it still came out good.

These are very versatile as you can mix and match the herbs & spices to your own taste.  Here's a helpful tip....try cutting the pitas with a pizza cutter!  It's so much quicker & easier than using a knife.

These are a great party snack and my guests really liked them. I will make them again but will play with different herbs until I find my favourite mix. I split 8 mini pitas down the middle and cut each half into 4. In my oven they took longer than 7 min and I also turned them once.

This is great recipe.  Alternatively, you may try and toast pita bread in a pop up toaster till brown and then cut into triangles and sprinkle with olive oil, salt and mixed italian herb.

Be careful that you watch them closely, they can burn easily.

I made these with whole-wheat pita, halved the olive oil, added 1/2 tsp. rosemary, and omitted the chevril.  I also separated the two halves of the pita as well.  They turned out fantastic!  Very tasty with hummus or alone as just a snack.

These are great!  I did have to buy Chervil, but other than that this one time, these chips are very economical and MUCH better than the store bought with all the preservatives!  These are the best tasting pita chips I have ever had!  Thank you for the recipe!!!

I can't seem to make enough of these suckers. They last about 10 minutes in our house and then they're gone. We love dipping them in hummus. They are my standby for when we have get togethers at our home. Totally wonderful and easy! Though, I must admit, I have never been able to find chervil, but they are fabulous even without it. Beware, you can't eat just one!

These pita chips are soo good.  I had never made them before, and now they are a great snack to have on hand.  My husband likes them a little bit softer than I like them, so he can dip them into pizza sauce, as he thinks they taste just like breadsticks!  I like them really crispy-either way they are delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

These chips sure were yummy.  Hubby has been bummed since our favorite pita chips haven't been in the store lately, I had bought some pita pocket bread for my 6 year old daughter she decided she didn't like, so I tried this recipe!  WOW!  They were gone in minutes!  We didn't have chervil, but substituted parsley instead...and also subbed garlic powder for garlic salt.  Hubby loved them, and my daughter wants me to run to the store right now for more pita bread!  Thanks, Dawn!

A good way to save money on those expensive Pita Chips at the store. But the store ones are still better. I had a hard time "brushing on" the olive oil mixture.

I loved this recipe, but I'd half the amount of garlic salt and add 1/2 or 1 pressed garlic clove.  It's a simple enough recipe for my Foods 7 & 8 class to make.

Yummy!  I cut the pitas in half, then separated them.  I then cut each half circle into large strips.  These worked well for dipping!

I made these for a dinner party/pot luck at my apartment tonight to go with my baba ganoush (also from this site), and they were gone within minutes. I'll have to make more next time. I just used a dipping herb mix that came in an Italian foods basket I won at an office party. I also added some salt and some garlic pepper. Very very good... will definitely make them again.

These are extremely easy and OH SO TASTY!  The very first time I made these I served them with Hummus at a party for the employees at my husbands upscale restaurant (these people are critical).  Everyone raved about them!  We had tons of other food but these were gone in the first 15 minutes of the party.  I only wish I'd made more.  An excellent recipe.
