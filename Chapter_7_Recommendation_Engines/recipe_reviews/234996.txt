Delicious! I accidentally bought a 29oz. can of sweet potatoes, but I used the whole can anyways. These came out soooo good! LOVED the Kahlua flavor, which was not too strong, but just right! I had some heavy cream to use up, so I used that in place of the regular milk, ya know, to keep the calories low, lol. I will def be making this easy, yummy recipe again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was way too sweet for us but we enjoyed the flavor that the Kahlua imparted with the sweet potatoes.  I probably won't try it again, but if I did I'd use much less brown sugar.

I used fresh sweet potatoes but other than that, followed the recipe. Next time I will reduce the brown sugar.  Very good.

Based on one review, I reduced the brown sugar by a bit. We were short on coffee liquor so was only able to use a 1/4 cup+.  I also used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk. It was still terrific
