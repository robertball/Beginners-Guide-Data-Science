This soup is great as is, but could be improved.  The original recipe is quite sweet and tangy which is good but I prefer a bit more savory.  I made one batch exactly as written and found that I needed more so I made a half batch, adding an onion and using chicken stock instead of vegetable to make a more savory blend.  When the two were mixed together it came out PERFECT!  Everyone loved it!

Great soup!  I too used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  I also added an onion...soup was a perfect blend of savory with just a hint of sweet.

I did not care for this recipe. I even used chicken stock and added onions like others suggested, but it was very sweet/tangy.  Also thought it had too much ginger. Guess it just wasn't for me.

I love this soup!  I used chicken broth instead because I didn't have vegetable broth.  YUM!

I tweaked this recipe as others suggested. I used 3 tbls. of butter, and started sauteing the onion as I was peeling, coring and cutting the pears and apples. I used chicken broth as well. Still, it was a little too sweet for my taste. I did not want a dessert soup. When I was reheating it after pureeing it, I added more sage, pepper, and decided to throw some savory in there. It is perfect now according to hubby.

Okay so I had to modify this recipe even from the suggestions but a VERY good base recipe to start off with. 
Modifications I used:
7 Cups of water (I am strict vegetarian so chicken is out as is veggie broth b/c most contain some meat byproduct)
1 cup of yellow label freshly brewed tea (tannin's help kill sweetness)
Ginger paste 1.5 teaspoons
1/4 Cup of cranberries
1 medium size onion
1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning (I didn't have bay leaves, sage, parsley on hand) 
Sounds strange with the tea but I have substituted tea a lot for broth and it always adds that extra flavor plain water doesn't have. 
Worth a shot, I enjoyed it as well as my hubby.
