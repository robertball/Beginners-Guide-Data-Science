This cake is so good you will not be sorry that you made it.  Make sure, if you make this for company or your family, you hide a couple of extra pieces for yourself later!!  :)

I made this lemon  ricotta cake. It was very tasty. I made it in a 9x9 pan. I greased the pan with canola oil spray then used the parchment paper and buttered it. I then put the batter on top of the paper. After baking in the oven letting it cool I made a buttery glaze for the top. I tend to like things sweet. It was good either way.

Excellent texture and subtle lemon flavor. Not too sweet. Not too fluffy or sticky.  Similar to a pound cake. I donâ€™t like normal cake that is too airy.
