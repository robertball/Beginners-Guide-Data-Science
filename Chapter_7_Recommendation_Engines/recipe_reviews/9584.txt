I hate to cast a negative vote among all the five-star ratings, but I thought the crystallized ginger in this recipe was too much! I like ginger, but biting into a small chunk of crystallized ginger gives the kind of hot sensation you get from eating Thai food--not exactly what I'm looking for in a cookie.  Homemade treats usually disappear quickly at my office, but I couldn't find any takers for these overwhelming cookies.  If I were to make these again, I'd definitely omit the crystallized ginger.

I have made this recipe twice in the last week. Wow! These cookies are good! Thank you, Laria. 

I did modify the recipe the second time I made them. In the first batch I used butter and  followed the recipe almost exactly. I used an entire jar of McCormick's crystallized ginger (about 2+ oz) ground in a food processor. Clearly that was much less than the 1/2 cup called for in the recipe, but at over $8/jar, who can afford that for a batch of cookies?    I did not compensate with any extra fresh or powdered ginger but they still tasted very good. They did, however, come out flat and soft and those that survived my family for a few days got softer and stuck together as time went on. 

For the second batch, I used Crisco butter-flavored shortening,and doubled the amount of fresh ginger and powdered ginger. When I tasted the uncooked batter  I was worried that I had produced an inedible ginger kick-in-the-head but those cookies were incredible. The batter was much easier to work with--not sticky, it was easy to shape in uniform round balls that produced perfectly shaped round raised cookies with a cracked surface. Once baked, the cookies were crispy but not hard and intensely gingery without a bite. 

I am writing this, my first review, to save myself from eating the rest of the cookies. Fortunately, I gave most of the batch away yesterday for a "ghosting."

These are fantastic!!!  To make chopping the crystallized ginger easier, I used my mini prep food processor--did a beautiful job in just a fraction of the time.  Will make again and again.

Thanks for this delicious recipe - it was exactly what I wanted in a ginger cookie.  If you keep your ginger root frozen, you can grate it quickly without peeling it because the skin falls to the side as you grate. I reduced the baking powder to 1 1/2 tsp. to keep the saltiness down.   If you like to add other spices to these cookies, you should try cardamom or five-spice powder.

As much as I REALLY like ginger, I made sure that I chopped the crystallized ginger into very small pieces. I really do think these are the BEST ginger cookies that I have EVER eaten, and I'm almost 55 years old!!!

AMAZING! I wanted to ensure they would be crunchy and chewy so I added 1/4 c more butter and decreased baking soda to 1 1/2 tsp. Theese are the best Ginger cooies ever.

YUMMY!!! These are wonderful! The grocery store near me ran out of crystallized ginger (available in the baking aisle near the candied cherries for fruit cake). I ended up tripling (actually probably more than that) on ground ginger and grated fresh ginger. I also found ground wet ginger near the minced garlic and used 2 teaspoons of that as well. (I'm a HUGE ginger fan.)
   These came out soft, moist and cake-like which I love. I can appreciate a crunchy cookie, but I like my ginger cookies soft. 
   Beautiful cookies! Will definitely make again. Though mine did stick to the cookie sheet. I will have to lightly grease it next time. Thanks Laria!

Dee-lish-us!!!The prep isn't bad for such a great product. I even rolled to cookie balls in turbinado sugar before baking (makes a great sweet crunch).

These were wonderful!  Crispy outside, soft and chewy inside, and very, very "gingery".  My kids said they were the best cookies they've ever had.  They don't spread much as they bake, so you can place them fairly close together.  Took only about 15 minutes to bake in my oven, rather than the 20 suggested.  A great recipe!!!

They're very, very chewy, even in the desert - maybe from the raw ginger?  I'd recommend baking them until the tops are brown, too (they'll still be chewy), and waiting a bit before eating them - they only get better.  Thanks for the recipe!

For a family of ginger lovers, these are the cookies of the gods!!! I did not chill them before baking, too impatient, and they turned out perfect, just like the picture. Used a microplane to grate the fresh ginger, didn't even peel it, quick and easy. Needless to say, these will be made again and again. THANK YOU!!!

Finally found this recipe after losing it for so long!  I made this with butter flavored Crisco(remember to add the 1 1/2 tbls of water to the 3/4 c. of Crisco or the cookies won't come out correctly).  They tasted as if they were from an expensive bakery, and I finally had my favorite cookie again! Thanks Laria!  As for the complaints about the crystallized ginger, I saw that 1/2 cup was way too much for what amounts to a quart of cookie dough so even without reading a review I reduced it by half.  Additionally, if you don't like too much ginger then a recipe titled "Triple the Ginger" isn't going to be for you.

These were not hard to make and they are the BEST ginger cookies I have ever tasted. I cut the brown sugar back to 2/3 cup and they were just fine. They crystallized ginger has sugar on it and I sprinkled the tops of the balls with sanding sugar. I used a cookie scoop rather than rolling them into balls and that worked really good also. I highly recommend them.

I didn't find these hard to make.  I used a food processor to mince the crystallized ginger so that part only took me 30 seconds.  I also followed others advice & froze the fresh ginger so that went fast too.  I LOVE the crystallized ginger bits in these cookies!  That's why I found this recipe...to mimic the trader joe version. I know some people don't like them, but to each his own!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe.  However, you have to be familiar with how strong crystallized ginger is.  It's kind of like eating the strongest cinnamon candy.  Surprisingly spicy.  If you like crystallized ginger, you'll love this cookie.  I made a change to the recipe.  I refrigerated the dough and then formed it into a 2 inch thick log which I then cut into half inch slices.  They baked up perfectly.  Much easier than forming round balls.

Careful about the distance on the cookie sheet and careful about baking time and temperature! Do you use an oven thermometer? I find it indispensable and I just don't know how some people manage without one! These cookies are rich and tasty, even too sugary for my taste, so I made them smaller. I used hot air to bake them for 10 minutes at 165C. Initially, I tried to bake at the suggested 175C and as I was keeping an eye on them I saw that at around 7 minutes they had started to burn around the edges...

I found this recipe when looking for a homemade version of Trader Joe's Triple Ginger cookies. Loved it. Now I've been diagnosed with gluten intolerance and can't eat wheat or butter. This recipe translated beautifully to GFCF (gluten-free, casein-free), though. I just subbed a bit of Earth Balance margarine (dairy-free) and shortening for the butter. I used a blend of brown rice, garbanzo, and tapioca flours for the flour, with 1/2 t of xanthan. They came out PERFECTLY - no one would know they're not "normal". They are a bit spicy, but that's the point - I would recommend dicing the candied ginger VERY finely though. I also like to add cinnamon and lemon/orange zest - they add a lot.

As long as you have a food chopper, this recipe is quite easy! A 2-inch piece of fresh ginger will yield the amount needed in this recipe - although of course, adding more doesn't hurt! The dough is really sticky - I recommend rolling the dough into logs with saran wrap and freezing it, then slicing it into rounds. 
I found the ginger flavors had more time to meld and intensify after storing the dough in the freezer. This is a wonderful ginger cookie!

Just made these today.  I made the dough yesterday.  I added more fresh ginger, used 1 cup of butter and 1.5 tsp. of baking soda (someone had previously suggested this for more chewy cookies)and rolled them in raw sugar before baking and they are perfect.  I don't really like baking cookies, too fiddly for me, but these were well worth it!

I love ginger so I had high hopes.  I was a little disappointed.  The flavor was only moderately gingery, but they do have a noticeable hot bite from the ginger.  I would have preferred more ginger flavor and less hotness. *The next day the hotness had mellowed, and the flavor improved. They turned out great.

Used 1/4 cup olive oil since I didn't have butter, and sorghum since I didn't have molasses.  Added an additional 2 t. ground ginger instead of crystallized ginger (wanted to cut down on sweetness).  Delicious!

Everyone loved these. They are also a great cookie to mail: moist and the flavor actually IMPROVES with time, plus they aren't super thin and breakable. My boyfriend lives out of town and I sent him a batch. I rolled them in sugar for sparkle as another reviewer mentioned, then wrapped two at a time in plastic wrap back to back and put them in a pretty box with some airpopped popcorn for padding. They arrived in perfect condition and absolutely delicious. Thank you for this great recipe!

Sooo good!  Made these for my husband and I think he died and went to heaven.  We like them spicy so I added a couple more teaspoons of ginger and grated an oz of fresh ginger into the dough.  I also added several teaspoons of ground cloves.  I under-baked them a little bit, but they're so good and chewy that way it was fine.   Id recommend cooking them for 20 min if you make the dough balls more than an inch in diameter.

Fantastic cookie!  I made these for my sister while she was going through chemo to help with the nausea.  Now, I am a giner-holic, but even friends and family who are not loved these soft, delicious cookies.  Definitely recommend these!

I followed this recipe exactly, except I couldn't chill the dough for 2 hours.  It did rest for at least this time though.  Perfect cookies and not too gingery at all. The dough is very soft and gooey - rolling the small drops of dough in sugar is a must and so is using parchment paper to bake on.  The final result: a soft tender cookie with a crisp outer edge to them.  I'll post again after they've been in a tin for a bit to see how they hold us.   I used a food processor to puree the candied ginger pieces and I used minced fresh ginger from a jar (Asian cooking).  All in all, not too gingery at all - and very flavorful.  The cookie turned out just like in the picture.  Definitely do again!

Whoo-ee!!! Yep, for ginger cookies, these go to the top of the list; HOWEVER, don't worry about chopping the crystalized too fine. I'm leaving the chunks bigger next time...maybe choc.chip size.

If the cookie turns out half as good as the dough (it's chilling now), I will be a very happy camper. I'm having a hard time not nibbling on it. I had to use shortening rather than butter (I was out of butter), baking powder over baking soda (again, out), and increased the salt (to make up for the baking soda). Increased powdered ginger and chopped up a little extra crystallized ginger, and ginger syrup (I had used all my fresh ginger to make the syrup). Anyway, I know the recipe as written tastes wonderful, too!

Really yummy and cakey. Kids even loved them. Something different if you've got eaters that don't like nuts or chocolate.

Wonderful!  Followed the recipe exactly, other than rolling in the turbinado sugar as someone else suggested, which was a great touch.  I'm a little surprised by the varied response on this recipe ... Mine were perfectly chewy in the center and crispy on the edges after 10 minutes, although fairly thin, unlike some of the photos. They do flatten and spread a lot from the balls.  I did not use parchment paper or grease sheets, and had no trouble with them sticking.  My only complaint was the recipe didn't make enough ... not that the yield was off, but just that we liked them so much we needed more!  Will definitely double when I make these again next weekend.

I made these for a cookie swap with all my relatives.  They were hugely popular - I like my ginger cookies with some BITE.  I recommend rolling the cookie dough in turbinado sugar before baking it - the sparkle makes them feel that much more festive!  This will be a welcome addition to our family traditions.

Perfect replica of my favorite Trader Joe's cookie, at quite a cost savings.  I used ginger paste from a jar and it worked very well, saving some of the prep time.

This is an incrediable recipe! If you really like ginger, don't be afraid to double or even triple the amount of fresh and crystallized ginger.  It's been a hit every time I've made it!  
If you find the ginger too much, try using younger ginger root. It's not as potent as the regular stuff.

Kids and adults adored these cookies over the holidays. Added a dash of cinnamon and ground cloves. Also, the first batch I stored in a tupperware ... a mistake. They became soft. Leave the cookies out and they'll stay crunchy.

Amazing!  Didn't have crystalized ginger and didnt miss it! Increased ground ginger and fresh ginger root as other cooks reccomended.  Also, heeded advice of adding additional spices: 1/4 teaspoon each ground black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, and allspice. Used electric coffee bean grinder to grind all whole spices, and even the ginger root.  For eye appeal and added moisture, mixed in  1 cup raisons that were dredged in self-rising flour right before  baking. Doubled the recipe easily and yielded 12 dozen ( I like smaller cookies, dropped from teaspoon at 12 to cookie sheet).  Last but not least, I used self-rising flour since I am lazy!! Absolutely fabulous cookie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Best ginger cookies ever! As others have said your fresh and crystallized gingers must be finely minced or a big chunk of either will overwhelm your palate.I prefer them rolled in sugar before baking ( as others have suggested)  The sugar adds a slight crunchy texture and puts out a little of the "fire" of the ginger.

The love this recipe I used white  sugar instead of brown sugar.  I cut the sugar down  to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 teaspoon each of ground cloves, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper and 3/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. I baked it longer for a crunchier cookie. It was real big hit!

I first ran across these cookies and made them for special occasions.  I was away from my cookbooks recently, however, and wanted to make them for my mother who suffers terribly from arthritis (ginger is one of the wonder spices and particularly good for arthritis).  They were as good as we remembered them being and, with a chopper, are not that difficult to make.  Don't, however, use one the hand-grinder ginger bottles for powdered ginger!  That was the killer.  Thanks to the contributr and All Cooks -- I depend on you heavily when I'm visiting my parents!

These are fabulous. For those of you who don't like biting into a hunk of ginger...the recipe does call for MINCED ginger. I take my chef tony super duper chopper and it takes it to fine little pieces. You want them to be no bigger than a peppercorn, tops. Even my two year old loves them. Someone recommened little jars of the chrystallized ginger...that can get spendy. You can also find it in the bulk bins at most stores or nutrition centers. Half a cup of ginger pieces ( you must chop them up yourself )will run you about a dollar. I make these all the time, and they will taste just fine if you double the ground ginger and omit the fresh, if you don't have any on hand.

These are buttery, spicy cookies.  I love the candied ginger...what a fun treat!  I used slightly less sugar and made a triple batch.  I rolled half the recipe into balls, rolled them in sugar and froze them on a plate.  Then I put the frozen cookie dough balls in an air tight container and left them in my freezer.  I can make a small batch at a time by putting them on a baking stone and cooking them until they are golden brown.  By making a small batch at a time, I don't eat "too many" at once.

Easy and deliciously spicy.  I cut the brown sugar by half, and rolled small balls of dough in granulated sugar before baking for a little sparkle. (Remember that the candied ginger is very sweet too.)

i didn't think they were a pain at all. i also didn't find them "hot", and would probably increase the candied and/or ground ginger next time. either way, these are delicious, and i don't think i'll ever make another kind of ginger cookie. my father is a huge ginger-holic, and i can't wait to let him try these. even my three-year-old enjoyed them. thanks!

These were seriously good.. Like bakery quality -- in both looks and tastes.  I was a little worried that the ginger would be too much, so I cut the fresh ginger to 1 tbsp.. next time will use the full amount. Even my husband, who is not a huge ginger fan adored these.  They stay nice and chewy, too.

Hello ginger fans.  This is by far one of the best cookie recipes I've ever made.  The trio of ginger was delish!  I used a small ice cream scooper, rolled them in sugar and then pushed them down with the bottom of a small glass dish.  I made them 3 weeks ago and they are still chewy.  If you've never had the chewy ginger pieces give them a try first . . I've found that you either like them or don't.  I LOVE THEM, so I was tickled when I saw them in this recipe.  I took them to a cookie exchange and they were a big hit. Thank you for sharing this recipe Laria.

WARNING:  these cookies do not take 20 minutes to bake!!  Check at 10 minutes!  This is a very good ginger cookie...nice and soft and flavorful.  However, I am not crazy about the candied ginger, and I still prefer my standard gingersnap recipe, so I don't think I'll be repeating this one.  But if you're looking for a good cookie, you won't be disappointed.

Groan!!! Oh so good! If you don't at least REALLY like ginger, don't bother making them :) I chop the crystallized ginger pretty finely, but even the occasional bigger chunk is still lovely and delicious to me. My boyfriend is not a huge gingersnap fan, but I couldn't keep his hand out of the cookie jar after making these!

WOW!  Fantastic Ginger flavor.  If you are not a huge ginger fan, you should probably follow a more standard recipe, but I just can't get enough ginger and these are moist too!  Make extra!  They'll go fast.

My husband and I love this recipe. We've been buying Trader Joes Triple Ginger cookies for years and these are the best homemade version of that. The crystallized ginger adds such great texture. I rolled them in sugar and flattened them a bit. Very crispy and good.

These are fantastic! I made them exactly as written except for my high altitude adjustments (1/4 tsp less baking soda, 3 tbsp of acidic liquid such as buttermilk or mayonnaise). Don't let the reviews that these are too gingery sway you. If anything, I was looking forward to the "spicy pieces of ginger" and didn't taste them as much as I would have liked. I might add more crystallized ginger next time or cut the pieces larger.

I was really disappointed in the flavor and texture of this recipe. I followed just as written, but these had very little ginger flavor, which was an absolute surprise to me. The texture was nothing like a typical gingersnap either. The cookies were very soft. I'll stick to my 'tnt' ginger cookie recipe.

Not happy at all! The cookies did not spread out. Instead they turned out like little puffed up mounds. Flavor is not bad but maybe it's just not my thing. If they were crispier I could maybe eat it with some tea.

I've been searching for a good triple ginger cookie recipe since my husband likes Trader Joe's triple ginger snaps. Decided to try this one.  He gave me the highest compliment - said he liked these even better than the Trader Joe cookies!
These cookies are also now one of my favorites.
The dough was firm enough to use a cookie scoop and drop onto cookie sheet (lined with Silpat) without having to refrigerate it first.
This recipe does require a lot of prep work (mincing fresh ginger and chopping crystallized ginger), but the end result is well worth the effort, especially if you love ginger. :)

This is sooooo Good!  They are very chewy and almost melt in your mouth.  The only tip I have is:  Buy your crystized ginger in the oriental section at the grocery store.  You can buy it for about $8 in with the spices or in a box for $3 and 2 times as much in the oriental section.

Added glace ginger, candied ginger, ground ginger and.... the zest of a lemon... oh my gosh are these ever good... not if you don't like ginger though... or shouldn't that go without saying??  They are super easy to make and I've rolled them into logs in wax paper and am leaving them in fridge for baking on demand. *****

I didn't think these were any more trouble than most cookies, and less than some.  The results were excellent.  I love the extra burst of ginger you get when you bite into a chunk of fresh or crystalized ginger.  I rolled mine in granulated sugar before baking them to give them a little more fancy appearance.

I just had to try this one after reading all the rave reviews.  These cookies have a wonderful, rich flavor & are easy to make.  With a good knife, like a santoku, chopping both the fresh & crystalized ginger is easy.  I chilled dough for 2 hours & felt it necessary to return it to the refrigerator while each batch baked.  I will probably add extra fresh ginger next time I make these.  This is the first cookie recipe I've ever made where I liked the finished cookie better than the raw dough. Thanks, Laria, for a truly great recipe. P.S.  I think these cookies turn out well as long as you put lots of ginger in.  For my latest batch I didn't have enough crystalized ginger, so I used extra fresh & powdered and they tasted the same.  They are still the best cookie I've ever made.  My friends also gave them rave reviews.

Apart from leaving the dough (I left it overnight), these are really easy to make. I loved the chewy texture and will definitely make these again, though I would not bother with the fresh ginger, I'd just use more crystallised ginger. Excellent!

Love these cookies!!! Just made a batch and doubled it because of all the high ratings.  I took the advise to use some shortening, so in my double batch I used 1c. butter and 1/2 c shortening. Cut down the soda to 3 tsp. for double batch and only used 1 1/2 c brown sugar. They are yummy and so close to Trader Joes Triple Ginger. Thanks Laria!

Delicious! I'm a big fan of Trader Joe's triple gingersnaps and these had the same bite and flavor, but were much softer and airier. Like another reviewer, I rolled the 1" balls in raw sugar before baking. I also had to leave out the molasses and fresh ginger, but the cookies suffered no loss of flavor. They were a big hit at my Christmas cookie party and I can't wait to make them again.

Wonderful...only change i would make would be to make them a bit bigger but what a great ginger taste...not at all hard to make!  also the crystallized ginger is available in bulk at Winco and other grocery stores...much cheaper that way!

These are excellent! I almost thought the ginger flavor would be too much, but it's not - it's perfect! And the soft, chewy texture of the cookie is very nice.  Nice change from the typical gingersnap cookie, and now one of my favorites.  Thank you!

This has become my trademark during the holiday season. I put a twist on things though by adding more fresh ginger than is called for. I also do not put the crystallized ginger in the dough, but I add one little piece to the top of the dough balls before baking so they look cuter. Delicious!

I made these cookies exactly to the recipe and they are delicious. Not sure what the reviewer below me is talking about, because they really don't have any "bite" and are quite sweet. Perhaps some varieties of crystallized ginger are stronger than others?

These are incredibly good! In addition, they freeze really well (at least for 2 weeks - then we finished them). This is my new favourite cookie and I'm usually a chocolate lover.

Had some extra ginger around the house to use up, and these cookies were the perfect use. Loved the great ginger flavor! The only thing I'd change is to bake a little longer than directed (or maybe my oven is just off), because mine were a little underdone. I didn't care though. I could eat this dough raw... it's so good!

Wow, these are amazing. I used Soy Garden instead of butter (lactose intolerant) and that worked fine. Also used candied ginger instead of crystalized ginger. You can get it at Trader Joe's for about 1/4 the cost of the crystalized and it's just as good. And instead of mincing the fresh ginger, I just grated it, which saved a lot of time. The only problem I have with these is trying not to eat the entire batch in one sitting. Too yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

I adjusted the recipe by adding almost 1 tsp more of each the ground and fresh ginger. While I liked the crystallized ginger in the cookie (a nice surprise when you bite on a piece!), I think I used the wrong type or brand. I got really crystallized pieces - they were almost crunchy! I think I'll try using a different brand, or soak the chopped c. ginger in some liquid (like rum or water!) to soften them up next time. In all though, a nice, mellow gingery cookie that I'll make again. Thanks for sharing!

Couldn't stop eating these!  Very very good.  Take note of the recipe guideline about spacing the cookies apart enough - I didn't do this with the first batch and they spread and stuck together.

These cookies have a really nice bite to them, and I LOVED them. The only thing I did differently was sprinkle coarse unrefined sugar over the top for a bit a "sparkle". Aside from that, wouldn't change a thing.

I am a huge ginger snap fan and these did not disappoint!  I could not find any crystallized ginger in my grocery store so I just used double the fresh ginger amount and it was just the right amount of ginger flavor!  Thanks for the great recipe!

the flavour of these was great but they hardened up quite a bit for me. They were still nice esp. if dunked into hot tea, but I would have preferred them to stay softer. Anyway, they are nice and gingery but if you are a fan of ginger (like me) you could definitely up the amount of ginger (especially the crystallized or powdered).

These are wicked good and gingery.  Mix them in the evening and bake them in the morning.  Won't seem to take so long and the dough is easier to handle.  
PS:  This recipe was in a "Silver Palate" cookbook from the 80s that I thought I'd lost forever. So glad to find it again!!

This is a fabulous recipe. I made it vegan and the cookies really wonderful. I then bought lots of ginger root so crystalize myself so all the ingredients will be easily on hand for next time, which will be soon. 

Did you design this recipe yourself Laria? And if so how did you go about doing it?

Thanks for a really noteworthy recipe!

Made these as a test for a cookie exchange and followed the recipe exactly and one other person's tip to freeze the dough in a roll and slice from that.  Cookies are the best my husband and I have had - especially good 1 to 2 days after baking since the ginger taste developed nicely.  Not too gingery and still slightly soft.  Made 20 on the first baking and still have some dough in the freezer - possibly because the dough slices were about 1/4 inch thick.

Will definitely make for the cookie exchange in December.

I've made these a few Christmases in a row and they're amazing. However to the people who suggested forming it into a log, chilling, then slicing into rounds, I say DON'T DO IT.  I tried that this afternoon and it was a disaster; spreads way too thinly in the oven so in the end the whole flat little pancake is overdone. Just stick to the program, form into balls, and roll in sanding sugar.
Also, the addition of a 1/2 teaspoon of fresh pepper and the same of cardamom makes it extra tasty!

These are the best ginger cookies I have ever eaten!  My nephew is wheat intolerant so I made the recipe with spelt flour (in the same proportion) and they turned out the same as if they were made with all-purpose flour.  My husband, family and colleagues all love these cookies!  Thank you so much for posting this recipe so we can all share in consuming these little nuggets of gastronomic joy!

We liked these. I had to cut the fresh and crystalized ginger to suit our tastes, but that wasn't a problem. Will use again. Oh, and I got 40 cookies from this recipe.

A great cookie for those who like spicy cookies. I used half as much sugar as called for and they were still sweet enough for me. I rolled half of them in turbinado sugar. Very pretty.

My husband and I really liked these.  We really love ginger, though, and some of our friends commented on the over-abundance of ginger (whereas my husband thought they could use more ginger.)  Our friends still liked them, but prefer the big soft molasses spice cookies that I make.  I'll make these occasionally for something different.

These could have been the best cookies I've ever made!  They were easy to make and came out perfect mine baked for 12 minutes.  If you like ginger cookies, you will LOVE these.  I did not get to baking until 2 days after I made the dough and they still came out great.

Mmmm.  These little babies rock!!  Althought I love ginger in all forms, I took a lazy shortcut and didn't use the fresh ginger this time and instead used a little more ground.  And I used ginger in syrup instead of crystallized ginger.  I also added a generous splash of vanilla.  This one is definitely a keeper.  They are delicious and really not that much trouble...if you like to bake, that is.

I used just two tablespoons of chopped crystal ginger and the ginger powder and  the results were great.  I think the fresh ginger would have been too strong.  I also tried shortening the 2nd time and it yielded a chewier cookie than using butter.  Dip in coarse or regular sugar before baking.

Fantastic!  If you haven't tried them yet, imagine a soft, chewy, gingersnap bursting with flavor, which leaves you with a warm glow that lingers - that what this is like.  My family & friends love this recipe.  Hint - make a double batch :-)

It came out too oily and soft. Next time, I'll try to bake for 15-20 minutes, and/or put in less butter, or add more flour.

I've been making these exactly as the recipe is written for five or six years now.  If you aren't a ginger fan, look for a different recipe because these are for those who are looking for a cookie with a bite.  I read another reviewer's comment that she didn't like them because of getting bites of the crystallized ginger; that's exactly why I love them!

These were easy to make and unlike another reviewer I found crystalized ginger in a bag for less than $2.50. Very good strong ginger flavor. Made once with dark molasses and once with reg. I do prefer the dark.

These have a pretty good ginger kick and they are quite good. My only problem is, that both times that I made them, the batter spread and produced a very thin cookie. They had  a crispy edge and a chewy center. Everyone loved them. I got about 5 dozen from a single recipe. I used a 1" cookie scoop, which really sped up getting the dough onto the cookie sheets.  The first time I made them, they stuck to the cookie sheet. The second time, I used parchment paper - sticking problem resolved. I tried this recipe because I'm trying to reproduce a ginger cookie I had in Bermuda. The picture looks just like them and the ingredients are almost the same, so I thought I had found my recipe. But the Bermuda cookies were  thicker and slightly chewy. Others, who've made this recipe, have described these cookies as exactly that, so I don't know what I'm doing wrong. The only difference in ingredients was the Bermuda cookies said vegetable oil and sugar, not brown sugar. Maybe I'll try that next time or use butter flavored crisco as others have recommended.

These are great! Using suggestions from other reviews, I added 5 "shakes" each of ground clove, cinnamon and allspice. Out of ground ginger, so mine were double ginger by instead increasing the crystallized and fresh gingers. Out of regular BS, replaced with 1/2 cup Splenda-brown sugar blend. And I topped each cookie with slivered almonds. Changes made to this recipe were personal preference and a somewhat limited pantry until shopping day.

Best ginger cookies ever!  I shared them at work and everyone loved them.  I made them extra small to make them last longer... and it didn't work.  I just ate more of them and then wanted to bake another batch!  Don't bother half-ing this recipe, you'll regret not having the other 18 cookies on hand.

Bravo!! These are a 'triple' winner with both my husband and me. I previously bought Trader Joe's Triple Ginger cookies but now I can make my own.  I followed the recipe with one exception.  I only had UNcrystalized ginger from Trader Joes rather than crystalized ginger.  I believe it's much cheaper to purchase than the crystalized.  It IS time consuming to chop it up as it's gummy and sticky.  So if anyone has a solution to quicken the chopping time for either crystalized or uncrystalized ginger, please let me know! A keeper recipe!

I add more crystallized ginger than it calls for (2-3 x more) but these are divine!

The cookies were a little paler than I'd expect from gingersnaps, but they taste of -excellent- and as gingery as I'd expect. Great recipes.

I've made these twice now and we love the flavor and "bite" of these cookies.  I used the fresh minced ginger in the jar and crystallized ginger bits (both from The Ginger People), which I further chopped a bit, so they really weren't any more work than any other cookie.  However, I had a problem with them turning out so flat.  I've experimented with baking time, oven temperature, refrigerating or not, and adding 1/4 cup extra flour - all without any real improvement.  I can't quite figure it out but I will continue trying as they are extremely delicious.

I made this without the crystalized ginger and it still came out really tasty. I didn't have enough ground ginger so I used more fresh ginger instead. My mom doesn't really like ginger but she ate these right up. I would definately make them again.

Very refreshing and wonderful! I had been concerned about too much ginger, so I cut the dry ginger back to 1 tsp. The fresh ginger root I sliced and chopped in my Zyliss hand chopper and it worked great and got it so fine there is no chance of getting a bite of only ginger. I put the crystalized ginger in the food processor and chopped finely, almost  made a mash. They are soo good! They taste like the real stuff! Will certainly make again and add the other tsp. of dry ginger.

Outstanding. I made them for a bake sale- two months ago- and I've had to make three additional batches... due to _begging_. They have been described as "addictive".

I did not have enough of the candied ginger, but otherwise thought these were good.  Be careful when adding fresh ginger, the little stringy pieces can be quite unappetizing.

These turned out amazing!!! CHANGES: I used soft margarine instead of butter; oat flour instead of all-purpose flour; 1/2 cup candied/crystallized ginger, which I blended together with the egg & molasses (I poured boiled water on the ginger before using to remove some of the sugar). Also increased fresh ginger root to 3 tbsp & added to the blender mixture (didn't have ground ginger, but it has better kick with more of the fresh stuff!!). Added 1 1/2 tsp nutmeg/gr.clove.cinnamon mix to flour mixture.
I spooned (teaspoon) rather than 'formed'; dough was still pretty soft after 2 hrs in a metal bowl. Use PAM (or other non stick spray). They were done in 7 min. at 350. 
A little too sweet-- next time I'll skip the sugar coating before baking.
Chewy, crispy...gingery:)

This is hands-down the best ginger cookie I've ever made -- very chewy, moist, lots of ginger flavor, and they keep very well for days.  I've made these for lots of occasions and am complimented on them every single time.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is excellent! The cookies were so moist, I couldn't believe it. I didn't have ground ginger, so I used 2 tbs fresh ginger and a little more crystallized ginger. These are the best ginger cookies ever! The only slight problem(didn't affect the taste), was that the cookies were flat. My cookies didn't look like the picture, but they tasted great. Does anyone have suggestions?

these were easy to make. i peeled the fresh ginger with the bowl of a spoon, and used the kind of chopper you pounce on with your hand. i cut the crystallized ginger with a knife. but here's why i only rated it 2 stars: it took more than an $8 bottle of crystallized ginger to make the recipe, and the results weren't worth it. sorry. also, if you don't use a really good baking sheet, the cookies fall apart when you try to remove them (i had two different types of sheets). i also substituted whole wheat pastry flour for the white, which added a "wheatena" crunchiness to the batter. 
won't be adding these to my christmas list, though.

Absolutely delicious. I didn't think they were a pain in the butt to make, with a food processor to chop both the crystallized and the fresh ginger, and a welcome break for a busy mom between the making and baking. I will make these again and again and again...

This recipe is fabulous! Added a little extra ginger, rolled in turbanado sugar before baking and then drizzled a few with bitterweet chocolate. If you add a little shortening to the dough in place of some of the butter, the cookies will stay softer. This cookie is a regular at my house and requested often by friends. Thanks!

Wow!  YUM-O!  I made these to take to work for a returning co-worker on sick leave.  Husband doesn't like ginger, so this was a good excuse to try them.  I played a little fast and loose with the amounts of fresh, candied and powdered ginger, but stuck to the recipe otherwise.  I guess the "pain in the butt" is having to keep rinsing my hands in cold water to keep the dough from getting too soft, and I kept the dough in the fridge between batches.  I got way more than 18 cookies, which is a Good Thing.  I'll have to make a little sign telling people they REALLY need to like ginger to enjoy these fabulous cookies.

Excellent.  I added the traditional spices; cinnamon and cloves.  I used my onion chopper to chop the crystallized ginger; it worked great.   The bake time is not nearly long enough; I tried 20 minutes with two trays in the oven.  I like my cookies crispy.

These are very good cookies, but I don't think they're quite as good as Trader Joe's addictive Triple Ginger Snaps. It is definitely easier if you buy minced crystallized ginger - the Ginger People sell a terrific one. Tasty, just not out-of-the-ballpark great.

I'm not crazy about the bites of fresh ginger either. I guess I'm just used to fresh ginger in savory dishes, and that's how I like it. These were OK, but I doubt I'd make again. I only made these because I had crystallized ginger to use up.

These were pretty good, but I was expecting better from the reviews.
I followed the recipe exactly but my cookies came out rather flat and, for some reason, much too salty!  Texture was good though.

Very good cookies.  My first pan did not cook very evenly.  The second pan came out perfect.  Next time I will let the pan containing the balls of dough come closer to room temperature before baking.

These are fabulous- I got tons of compliments on them.  The only change I made was to roll the dough in granulated sugar before baking for extra sweetness and sparkle.

WOW! The flavour of these cookies is so intense! I had high expectations making these and the outcome exceeded them.  I would'nt change a thing about this recipe,  however I did put a dollop of raspberry jam in the centre of each cookie. YUM.  I will definately be making these again and again!

These were AMAZING!! Perfect cookie consistency, nice and soft/chewy, with great ginger flavor. They are not that difficult to make. I grated the ginger root instead of chopping and that worked fine. Will be giving these out as holiday gifts!!

These are fabulous ginger cookies, nice and soft; they remind me of the gingerbread men I used to get as a kid.  And I found them very easy to make... the worst part being trying not to eat them all when they come out the oven!

I used the suggestion of Crisco. Had only 1/4 cup of crystallized ginger but added more fresh. Sprinkled with colored sprinkles and they turned out great!. 10 minutes in my oven.

Absolutely will make it again as I make it different every time. This time I just added shakes of cayenne and black pepper; none of the cloves and nutmeg in other recipes. Oh, and used 1/3 organic sunflower oil  instead of all butter. Dough's good. Chilling right now.

I think the taste is great! (But I really love ginger - even my 8 and 5 year old loved them though..).  I made the mistake of leaving them out overnight.  They are way to soft now.  I will try drying them out in the oven.  I'd advise freezing the rolled balls and only baking off what you will eat right away.  (I got about 50 one inch rolled balls). Or at least store airtight immediately after the cookies are cool.

I love these cookies and they are always a big hit for the Christmas holidays; they have become 'my thing'. 
My only suggestion in to take your time to chop/ mince the crystalized ginger. Additionally if you leave your dough in the fridge longer than the recommended 2 hours (I did and learned), I would give it a gentle mix to incorporate the liquid and moist dough inthe lower part of your bowl.

My husband and I both like the taste of these ginger cookies. I baked the cookies several minutes longer than the recipe called for and let them firm up several minutes on the cookie sheet before removing to a cooling rack. One batch made 36 cookies. These cookies freeze well.

These cookies are so good that my (extended) family and I literally cannot stop eating them until there are no more.  We usually are good at not eating everything in sight, but these we just take piece after piece until they are all gone.  There is no resisting.  They are both chewy and crunchy, sweet and tasty.  So good.  One of my all time favorite cookies, definitely in the top 3.

These are my husband's favorite cookies. He has digestive issues and says the ginger helps him, but I think that is just an excuse to eat more! I have made them more than a dozen times and they always come out amazing just as written, I have not changed anything other than occasionally using bottled ginger in place of the fresh minced.

These ginger cookies are fantastic!  They are a little firm soft and chewy, even days later. I chopped my crystalized ginger in little chunks to really get a ginger blast through each bite. Im making these again today.

These turned out perfect!  I left out the fresh ginger and used the ginger powder and crystallized ginger pulsed fine in my mini food processor.  These have an Intense ginger flavor and come out soft and chewy.  I didn't have time to rest  the dough and they came out just like the picture as I rolled them in sanding sugar too.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thank you so much.

I am a ginger junkie, so these were super delicious to me!  As I was tasting the doe, I thought of adding a little orange zest. Hmmm. My family loved them, except the one who isn't a fan of ginger.

Delicious did not change one thing except I did add organic sugar which is bigger granules on top to make them sparkle. Making again today since they disappear like magic.

I did roll the cookie dough in cinnamon sugar before they were baked. The cookies stay chewy and moist in a tin for over a week if you can keep them around that long. Definitely a winner. Made two batches. Some were made into ice cream sandwiches with homemade apple pie ice cream. YUM.

I minced the candied ginger finely and refrigerated the dough overnight (about 17 hours due to my schedule) in the hopes of getting a really punchy ginger flavor. I used a cookie scoop (#50) and baked them 8 to a tray on a silicone lined sheet for 12 minutes. They ended up slightly chewy with a nice deep dark brown color. 

Unfortunately they weren't as spicy as what I was looking for so if I make these again, I'll follow some suggestions found in the comments from previous posters.

I love spices so I added cloves and cardamom; cut back on sugar as always; candied ginger is costly and not an item I choose to have on-hand, so these were merely double ginger snaps.

Very good if you like ginger...it is intense.  I won a local baking contest with this.  The only change I made was I drizzled on a few streaks of coffee/powdered sugar/vanilla mixture.

Just made my second batch. These cookies are wonderful. The photo shows them with sugar on them, though the recipe doesn't mention it. I rolled each ball in demerara sugar before baking. Used reconstituted freeze-dried ginger instead of fresh. Used plenty of chopped candied ginger. Next to Toll House, I'd say these are now my favorite cookies!

All these were gone at the end of the party, and sent this recipe home with a guest. Winner in my book!  They're really good on the lighter edge of done when they're still soft and chewy in the center too. I just love the addition of crystallized ginger, it adds a nice kick with a soft raisin-ish texture. Might try coating them in coarse sugar next time to get that crackly texture, make them look a little less like chocolate chip cookies.

I loved the recipe, but I am confused about the cooking times mentioned.   At the top, it states cook for 20 minutes and in the body of the recipe it states, bake for 10 minutes.

Awesome! I've made this about ten times and I keep adding more ginger. I'm up to about 50% more of each type of ginger input. FWIW: this is a great recipe for well-infused butter, especially if you've had enough of chocolate-based infused products.

I found these when looking for a copycat recipe for Trader Joe's triple ginger snaps.  For extra BAM I substituted bacon fat for the butter.  Use Penzey's Spices Sweet Ginger Bits for the crystallized ginger.  You can refrigerate it in batches, rolled into logs, then slice and bake whenever you need cookies in a jiffy.

The crystalized ginger is delicious. They were easy to make. I refrigerated the dough on a log encased in cling wrap then just sliced and baked. Makes it a breeze to have fresh cookies. Thank you for a very good recipe.

I don't understand the rave reviews.  The recipe made"as is" resulted in a very cake like cookies that did not spread, was dry and needed sweetness.  The recipes is missing granulated sugar which is the culprit.  Epicurious has a similar recipe that will yield the right consistency and taste.

What great cookies!  Slightly chewy with a wonderful ginger flavor.  Since I didn't have crystallized ginger, I used an extra teaspoon of powdered ginger.  I also rolled the dough balls in Demerara sugar.  These cookies actually leave a fresh taste in your mouth!  I will definitely keep this recipe to use again and again!!

I had such high hopes for a very gingery, crisp cookie, so I was a bit disappointed. I solved the crispy part by baking them for several minutes longer (I think I should get an oven thermometer, though.) I would also add much more ginger, all three forms, but mostly the fresh.

This cookie was excellent.  I made no changes to the recipe, but I didn't have the time to wait for the refrigeration.  I just dampened my hands a little to keep the dough from sticking to me, rolled into ball shape, and then rolled into white sugar before baking.  I could not stop eating them.  Everyone was eating them.  I wanted to save them for Christmas,  I guess I will make more.

I was looking everywhere for a really great soft ginger cookie recipe and I have finally found it.  This cookie is not only soft but has the most delicious ginger flavour.  I cut the crystallized ginger into fairly small pieces but I put more in that what was called for.  I also rolled some of the dough balls in fine sugar to give them a bit more sweetness.  I brought some to work and all my co-workers have said they are the best they've ever had and ask when I'm bringing more in.  More importantly my family LOVES them. This recipe is now in my list of must haves.

These are great! I followed the recipe, except substituting butter flavor shortening for 1/4 c of the butter.  Put the crystallized ginger in a food processor so the bits would be tiny and rolled the dough in turbinado sugar. This made 48 cookies with a #60 disher (scoop).  They are outstanding: a little bite, soft and a bit of crunch on the outside.  These definitely go in the Christmas Cookie folder!

love these.... i did use my food processor to mix all the ginger and flour, which made the pieces of ginger very small :D  ... i didn't have butter so substituted half olive oil, half plain applesauce...  it seemed a bit moist so added a bit of coconut flour, they turned out awesome!!! they reminded me of the Trader Joe's Triple Ginger cookies...

My mom's cookies are the gold standard. These are up to that standard. They take time and are absolutely worth it for the layers of intense ginger flavor.

These are hard work so when I make them I double the recipe, use 3 jumbo eggs not 2 and add a some extra molasses. I also add 2 teaspoons of baking powder. They're a huge hit

Perfect. I rolled half the cookies in sugar before baking, as I do with other ginger cookies, but I shouldn't have bothered, they were better plain. If you're a fan of ginger you will love these.

Easy to make once you get used to chopping crystallized ginger. Use a large, sharp, broad based knife, and just go at it until it's minced well.  These are so good, you can use them for gifts because EVERYONE loves them.  My secret?  A pinch of cardamon and a healthy dose of cracked black pepper.

A big winner in our house. I didn't use cristallized ginger but maxed out on fresh ginger and powdered ginger.

Golden syrup works well as a substitute for molasses and dark moscavado sugar adds an addictive sweetness!

Excellent recipe, maybe not for the timid palate but a favorite for ours.  The soft texture and complex, stimulating flavor of this cookie really set it apart from the ginger snaps I've made before.  I rolled mine in sugar before baking and I'm pleased with the sparkling effect that resulted.  The pliant form makes for an excellent ice cream sandwich, too.  Write this one in your cookbook, you'll be coming back for more!

Best ever!  My husband was complaining about having too many chocolate selections in our upcoming xmas trays.  So, this sounded good.  Boy was I correct.  My son has a peanut allergy, so finding crystalized ginger was tough.  But I found the BEST ginger from The Ginger People.  Super tasty, best I have ever had.  These do take planning ahead to have your ginger supplies ready and to wait for baking.  Well worth the effort.  My husband is eating all the extras I have right now!  My daughter is trying to keep up with him!  I will make these many times again.  The only thing I did in addition to what the recipe states is that I rolled the tops in sugar before baking.  Made them a little fancier.

Excellent cookies!  I use Billington's Muscavado Light Brown Sugar to give the cookies an even deeper flavor.  The cookies taste better two or three days after baking, if you can wait that long.

These cookies were really yummy, but my cookies turned out very flat.  I used golden syrup instead of Molasses, could that be why?  If somebody knows how I could make these like the ones in the photo, please let me know.

Fantastic recipe!!!  I made these to send to my mom for Mother's Day, but we snuck a few here, too.  I added a cup of white chocolate chips to the batter.  So gooey and delicious!

These are for ginger & gingerbread LOVERS! 5 stars because they came out just like everyone said they would: chewy & delicious.  I loved the idea of the three types of ginger but was looking for less of a gingerbread taste. I usually like my cookies less chewy...but my cookies were gone in a day and they stayed nice and soft. I baked one batch 2-3 minutes longer and loved the crispiness. Thank you :o)
