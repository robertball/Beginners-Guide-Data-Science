These muffins are wonderful. I love cinnamon and Hersey came up with a winner in their cinnamon chips. This recipe was extremely easy to whip up and I cannot wait to try the chips in other recipes. Phoenix.

This was certainly the easiest recipe I've ever tried, but I wasn't wild about the result.  They weren't terrible; they're just not my kind of muffin. I like moist, cake-like muffins.  These came out kind of dry and biscuit-like.  They reminded me more of scones than muffins.  Just not my cup of tea.

These were good.  Moist.  Sweet.  I made this recipie into mini muffins and they only took 10 minutes to bake.  I will make these again.

I had this recipe just lying around and almost threw it away.  Boy am I glad I DIDN'T.  I'm not really a muffin person but these are really easy and VERY tasty.  I made some when my friend came to visit from Virginia and she thought they were wonderful too.

I loved these for breakfast. They are best served warm. I heated my left overs in the microwave for about 30 seconds, and they tasted great! So quick and easy too. Thanks for sharing these with us.

These were a little sweet, but an excellent texture-- slightly crispy on the top, and nice and moist on the inside. They might be good with chocolate or butterscotch chips as well.

This was a quick, easy recipe.  But they were a bit too dry and biscuit-like for my taste.  I will probably use this again when I need something very quick, but I will try adding something to make them more moist.

Finally!  A perfect muffin recipe that is easy, light, fluffy, delicate & delicious!  I used mini chocolate chips & baked them in mini-muffin tins.  I baked them until the edges just turned brown & had to let them cool in the pan before removing them since they were so delicate!  No more muffin mixes for me - this was too easy!  Thank you!

This recipe is delicious! I read the reviews on them turning out dry before I made them and I added 1/3 cup oil instead of the 2 tablespoons and boy did that do the trick! Absolutely melt-in-your mouth muffins! Wonderful!

Wow these are great! I topped half of them with chopped walnuts before putting in the oven. These are very light and fluffy, and will be good with milk chocolate and peanut butter chips also. I used the reduced fat baking mix. Will make these muffins again very soon.

Very easy, but extremely dry. I even added a little extra oil, but they still needed to washed down with a huge glass of milk. I'm not sure I would make these again.. I prefer moist muffins.

These are fantastic! I couldn't find cinnamon chips, so I used a peanut butter chip/milk chocolate chip mix for my first round. Woah! YUMMY! This is my new base muffin recipe. I'm so anxious to try it with cinnamon chips...maybe even fruits at some point. I'm not sure why other testers had trouble...I think it's easy to overmix muffin mix. DON'T DO IT! :-) This hardly needs any attention...I think I stirred my batter 6 times total...barely moisten the dry ingredients. You'll still have lumps of biscuit mix...and they'll be perfect!

These were okay. I didn't like them too much, they were sort of dry. I bought some cinnamon chips to experiment with, and was a bit disappointed by this recipe. They get three stars because my family seemed to like them.

I made these muffins just the other day.  They were sooooo easy to make! Definately one of the simplist recipes to follow!  They were very good.  I did add an extra tbsp. of oil since other reviewers said they were too dry.  I thought they were good and my grandparents loved them.  They weren't the best I've ever had, but I will probably be making them again.  I also would add just a bit of cinnamon to the batter.

These were easy enough and had a pretty good taste, but they were so
dry, you had to have something to 
wash them down.  I too, would like to
add something to make them more moist.
