This "frosting" is very good but is not the original for this torte. The original "buttercream" uses a cooked sugar/water syrup, sweet butter, bitter chocolate and egg yolks. Vanilla and dark rum were added to make the flavor unique. One must try it to appreciate the "Swiss Chocolate" creamy texture and flavor. I submitted the recipe on 15/01/07 but it is still waiting for review.

I made this frosting to use on kids' cupcakes. Everyone loved it, but I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars, as there is no way I would serve frosting with raw egg in it, especially to children. I omitted the eggs, and after blending in the chocolate, I substituted enough milk to reach the desired consistency, then beat the mixture for 4 minutes. I also omitted the salt, which no one missed.

Im only giving it 4 stars because i made changes after reading other reviews- It came out beautifully and spread very well even smoothed out nice to give me the crisp clean lines like a reg buttercream

-used 1c. crisco & 1c. butter instead of 2c.butter
-added 2 tbsp cocoa powder to the sugar
-omitted eggs & added 4 tbsp of cold milk in place.

If you  are looking for the "just like store bought" frosting, this is it.  It spreads beautifully! It is too bad that the raw egg is in it, though, this means you have to use it and eat quickly AND keep it cool.

Very, very good.  Made it exactly as written with 2 exceptions; I used 1 c. butter and substituted shortening for the 2nd cup (but only because it was for my daughter and she's not that crazy about butter) and I added a couple of tablespoons of  cocoa to intensify the chocolate flavor.  This recipe made PLENTY of frosting for my two 8-inch cakes and in fact I could've split the cakes and made 4 layers and still had enough. It spread easily and firmed up nicely in the fridge, so I can tell it would be fine for piping.  This is a keeper for me.

I've used this recipe twice to rave reviews.  I substituted cointreau instead of the vanilla extract (doubled what the recipe called for on the vanilla extract).  they were a smashing success!!

This recipe was wonderful, though I omitted the raw eggs. The consistency was fine without them.

This has become my family's favorite chocolate frosting.  I'm looking for a white or close-to-white frosting that is just as good - at least one that requires this much beating and turns out this fluffy.  Does anyone know if I can accomplish this by just leaving the chocolate out of this recipe?

This was marvelous! A great compliment to the Buttermilk Chocolate Cake, also on this site. I was going to make the fudge icing that goes with that recipe, but then I realized I was out of cocoa powder. I AM EXTREMELY GLAD I TRIED THIS RECIPE. 5 Stars!

I used this frosting on a chocolate cake with a strawberry/chocolate ganache. It was a huge hit, with some people saying it was the best cake they ever had. I also added some piped strawberry cream cheese frosting for accent and a little more strawberry flavor.

Raw eggs? Why does buttercream need raw eggs? I omitted those and it works well otherwise.

I thought this was almost perfect. Not to heavy not to light. I did add 2 T unsweetened cocoa for more choc flavor and color and did not add eggs. I added just a bit of milk till it was the perfect consistency.I don't know how the photo shown is so dark but either way the taste is wonderful.
