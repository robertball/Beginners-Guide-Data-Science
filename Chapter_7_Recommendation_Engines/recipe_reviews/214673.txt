This recipe was absolutely wonderful!  I made it for a family gathering, and there is nothing left!  I did have to make a couple of changes, though.  Following the recipe, the batter is way too thick to be called a "smooth batter" or to "pour."  It was more like bread dough.  I added about 1/2 cup more of milk, and it became much easier to handle and pour.  I also had to bake it an extra 10 minutes - the inside was still gooey after more than 15 minutes, like an undercooked biscuit. After all was said and done, though, I loved this recipe.  It's sweet, but not TOO sweet; the fruit shines!
