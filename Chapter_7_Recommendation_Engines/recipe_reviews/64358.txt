This is a great alternative to old-fashioned potato salad.  The flavors blend well together and is actually easier to make than traditional.  Even though the ingredients for the dressing sound strange, it is good and not too spicy.   I think a little crumbled bacon would be excellent in it.

Something (I'm guessing the 1 tsp of tumeric) made this very bitter.  Plus, there was no "sweet" factor as one would think should be there with german potato salad.  I was hoping for a sweet/hot combination.

If you want something different - this is it.  I was relatively easy to make.

We just didn't care for this.  The flavor of the dressing with the potatoes and the combination of textures just didn't work for us.  It wasn't much like a German potato salad but wasn't quite Asian either.  YMMV!

This salad tastes better the second day, and it was great the first day!  I didn't use the oil, ham or hot sauce.  I liked this for a change of pace!
