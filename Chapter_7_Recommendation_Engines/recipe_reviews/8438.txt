I don't understand why someone would rate this two stars and not explain why. For me, this worked out very well. I did upgrade most of the ingredients to either use healthier or organic counterparts. I used organic whole wheat white flour, I cut the sugar back to a half cup (as the raisins and tomato soup have their own sweetness), I used pecans instead of walnuts (personal choice as we don't care for walnuts), I used Healthy Request tomato soup and I used organic eggs and raisins. I was able to get 12 large muffins out of this recipe and they baked up beautifully though they did turn out a little dry for me. (Not a deal breaker for me, it could be a number of reason why they turned out dry.) This recipe used all ingredients I had on hand plus it used up a can of tomato soup I had in my pantry. Quite good but really, I just love tomato soup cake. It's one of those comfort foods you remember your Mom making for you as a child. I urge you to try this for yourself. You'll be skeptical that tomato soup would be good as a spice cake/muffin but it's really tasty. Trust me.
