Very good flavor.  A full recipe fits perfectly in a 1.5-Quart slow-cooker.  I used a heaping 1/2 cup of sugar (granulated sugar subsitute worked well, too).  Cooking on High for 1.5 hours worked best, stirring occasionally (2 hours made the pearls pretty mushy).  

Using 2 egg yolks worked for me, and that's the QTY of yolks in the original video for this recipe.  The original also called for 2 Tablespoons of vanilla.  I love vanilla, so I use that amount. It will seem SOUPY even after you add the yolks and let it cook for 20-30 minutes - don't worry, because it will set up nicely after it cools and chills.

Best tapioca recipe I've ever found..........creamy, yummy comfort food!

Made this as stated. I am not a tapioca fan but figured our littlest would love it.  I was right he devoured it. I tried some and actually liked it also. It was very smooth and creamy.  The tapioca was done perfectly and the texture was fabulous, one of the reasons I didn't like it in the past. I also have a newer slow cooker but did not have any issues with it.

This recipe has great potential WITHOUT any changes. I had trouble because my slow cooker runs very hot. I tried cooking it on low and then warm and finally succumbed to high. It finally started thickening and I then over cooked it. I will continue to make it stovetop because I can't babysit my slowcooker. If you have one of the older crockpots, I think this would work much better. It still is very tasty. BTW I am going to keep my eye out for an older and slower crockpot. I did serve this over a puddle of grand marnier and the orange liquer was a very nice addition. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe Meadowwood!

We really like tapioca here so I doubled the recipe.  Also, I only had large pearl tapioca on hand. I soaked it overnight and it worked out fine. I did cook 3 hours on high before adding the egg yolk since it was such a large batch.
I also like to use the egg whites, beating them to a stiff peak with a little sugar. I folded these in 30-45 minutes after adding the yolks. (This was about how much time it took for the pudding to start to thicken.)
You may have to wait longer for your tapioca by cooking it in the slow cooker but I love not having to stand over the stove! This is the way I'll be cooking it now.

Very good recipe. I have a 1 1/2 qt slow cooker and it was the perfect size.  It's not overly sweet and I liked that. Easy to make, smooth and delicious. I didn't make any changes.

How fast and easy!  Using the slow cooker made for much less fuss, and the results were so good that my family requested that I make another batch the next day.  My slow cooker worked beautifully on the high setting as long as I remembered to stir this occasionally. I did once substitute 1/2 cup of cream for 1/2 cup of the milk for a wonderfully rich and flavorful pudding, but it was also delicious using only the milk. My family thought this lovely with fresh strawberries, chilled, but I enjoyed it while it was still warm.  If you've never had homemade tapioca, forget you've ever tried that store-bought packaged stuff.  This is the way to go!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was DEE-licious. I used the 1 1/2 qt. slow cooker that only heats to hight, and cooked it for 2 hours. I used 1/2 cup sugar (perfect sweetness), 2 TBSP vanilla like it says in the video, and 2 egg yolks. You don't really need to cook it long after adding the egg yolks, since you're not bringing the temp down much so it cooks in just a minute. We were ooh-ing and ahh-ing so much over the flavor that my son even turned down ice cream for it, and he didn't like tapioca before this!

I made this exactly as written except for reducing the sugar to 1/2 cup. At first I was worried about the consistency because it looked thinner than I am used to when it was done. However, it thickened up nicely when it cooled. Something about the flavor is a little off for me though and it also tastes a little salty. I may try making it again but use only 1/4 tsp. salt and maybe use two whole eggs instead of two egg yolks. As much as I like vanilla I think that I would only use 1 tsp vanilla next time too, so I can really get the tapioca taste I'm looking for.

Lowered the sugar to 1/2 cup and it was delicious.  I've wanted a recipe that didn't take constant attention and this fills the bill.

If you cut the recipe in half, make you sure only leave it on high for half the time! I almost burnt mine. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderfully. The best Tapioca recipe by far!

I used large pearl tapioca but didnt have the patience to soak it overnight.  I did soak the tapioca for 3-4 hours using just hot tap water. The pearls cooked just fine and wasnt chewy.  I doubled the batch and took advice from a previous comment about backing down on the salt.  I am a salt fan and always keep a shaker nearby but the 1 tsp (1/2 dbled) just sounded like a lot so I tried 3/4 tsp and am glad I did as it was perfect, a hint of salt and not overpowering.  It took a little longer to thicken then stated, but be patient, good things come to those who wait! YUM :)

Hubby loves it! Used 2% milk and 1/2 cup sugar. Cooked it on high for 2 hours. After adding the egg yolks, I reduced the heat to low. 20 minutes later it was perfect. I’m not a fan of tapioca but really liked the flavor. I think I will be making this quite often.

So easy to make when you have a toddler and baby on your heels and not worry about burning it! the 1.5q crock pot really is the perfect size for it! Came out to 5 cups of pudding exactly.  The pearls are so perfectly cooked. I went with the suggested 1/2 c sugar and did a heaping 1/2c of pearls. Soo yummy!

Yum, and EASY!!! How wonderful to throw a few ingredients in the crock-pot and have a warm, creamy, comforting, delicious pudding, a few hours later. I'm making it my second time, this week. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe. I'm trying it with 1% milk, right now. Enjoy!

Insanely delicious. I let ours cool off and the end flavor was a bit like Spanish natillas, caramel-vanillaish. You could see the tapioca pearls perfectly but they were very smooth and melted on your tongue. This was very, very, VERY good. Oh, I forgot to say I used a real vanilla bean, and if you do that you will need to whisk it a lot to break the seed paste into the pudding while it cooks :)

I gave this recipe a 3 only because if you cook this in a slow cooker on the high setting it will burn.  I'm going to try it again on the slow cook setting because I think that will be fine.  Flavor and texture were great.

No changes made. Will make it again. The best part is being able to make it in my slow cooker. Love it! Little cinnamon sugar or nutmeg on top, wonderful dessert.

We are tapioca pudding fans and this recipe is nice and easy.  Didn't have to worry about burning on the stove with a baby running around with the slow cooker method.  I followed as written, except I added 2 TBS of vanilla as suggested by video and reviewers.  I didn't cut the sugar, because it tastes like the right amount as written:)
