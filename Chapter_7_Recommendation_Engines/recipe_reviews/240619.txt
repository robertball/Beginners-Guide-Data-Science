Ok, so here is the scoop with this recipe.  As written it would make a massive amount of food, based on the other reviews here are the changes I made and my house full of picky boys + husband loved it, called it homemade hamburger helper.  Used one lb. of ground beef and the whole 12 oz. pkg of noodles which was a perfect meat to noodle ratio and filled the 9X13 dish perfectly.  I did cook the noodles but to al dente.  Adjusted the other ingredients to:  1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 cup of corn (mine was frozen so I thawed it first), 1 cup of sour cream, tablespoon of worchestershire, added about a cup of shredded cheddar into the meat/noodle mixture and salt and pepper to taste.  Cooked it for 20 minutes and then topped it with more shredded cheese and cooked 10 minutes more. I think it would also be delicious with corn + pico de gallo if you wanted some more flavor and spice.  Thank you for this recipe, it's an easy and filling week night meal!

Didn't say whether to cook the noodles or not before adding to the skillet and didn't say whether to add water to the soup mixes.
I went ahead and added the noodles from the bag  and no extra water.  I added about a half cup water when I noticed the noodles weren't getting tender in the oven.

Next time I will add at least one cup water to the skillet before transferring to the casserole dish.

I also used onion flakes rather than a fresh green onion as my guys don't like so much onion flavor.

One other note:  this recipe makes more than will fit in a 9x13 casserole dish. I put the extra in a deep 4 cup casserole dish.

Other than that mix-up, my family loved this!  I have picky eaters in my house so this was a winner.  Thanks for the recipe.

So easy even a man can do it. Just switched out cream of mushroom for a can of cream of broccoli and doubled the noodles so I would have leftovers. Next time trying ground turkey.

Good basic casserole dish. I cut this one in half, but left the original amount of called for pasta (6-oz uncooked). I cooked the noodles before baking, mixed in half the cheese, topped the casserole with the rest of the cheese and let it heat through in the oven for only 15 minutes to reduce cooking time. Quick and easy, good work night meal!

Good, basic, "comfort food" casserole. This made two casserole dishes' worth for me, so I suggest cutting it in half unless you're feeding a crowd. There was easily enough for 10 people. Some other reviewers questioned whether or not to cook the noodles or add water- I did NOT pre-cook the noodles but did add about half a cup of water because I was worried about it. This was unnecessary. I ended up upping the temp to 375 and cooking for about 15 minutes extra to thicken up the dish. So just follow the recipe, but do mix half the cheese in or layer it with the meat mixture instead of putting it all on top.

This recipe was so good.  Everyone in my family loved it.  Very cheesy just like I love.  Next time I might consider putting half of the cheese in the meat mixture or cutting the cheese in half.  The way the recipe is written there is 1/2 -1 inch cheese just on the top.  My kids claim to hate cream of mushroom soup and didn't even realize that it was made with it.  Pretty sneaky on my part. :-)

OMG, this is delicious.  In all fairness, I did change the portions but otherwise followed the directions. Here's what I did:
1 lb hamburger, seasoned, cooked and mashed
3 cans cream of mushroom soup
1 can cream of chicken soup
2 cups sour cream
1 can drained corn
1 - 16 oz bag egg noodles
Shredded Tillamook Sharp cheddar to taste
Holy cow, it was sooo good.  I won't ever cook boxed Hamburger Helper again.

This is a good recipe to try out. If you have a lot of ground beef in your freezer this casserole is the trick. Nothing but egg noodles, sour cream, mushroom soup, and lots of cheese!!!! It's really good.

I halved the recipe and used only cream of mushroom. I boiled the egg noodles for 6 minutes before adding the meat mixture which reduced the baking time to 20 minutes at 325 then 5 more minutes for melting the cheese. It turned out awesome and saved some time!

I adapted the recipe according to what I had on hand. I used cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom and used a mixture of egg noodles and bow tie pasta. I cooked the noodles first, then baked it for less time. Everyone liked it and we will be making it again!

I made this dish yesterday and it was incredibly tasty!  I did make some changes to the base recipe and would like to share those changes (and additions) as I believe it made it a positive difference in overall flavor profile.  CHANGES IN QUANTITY/MEASURES; I used 1.5 lbs. of ground beef, 8 oz. of egg noodles, cream of broccoli soup instead of cream of mushroom,16 oz. of sharp cheddar cheese. ADDITIONS AND CHANGES IN PROCESS; when browning the ground beef and onion I added 2 Tbsp Hatch Chili's, 2 Tsp of ground Cumin,salt and pepper (season your meat every step of the way when cooking, it DOES make a difference). I mixed ~8 oz. of the cheese and another ~3 Tbsp of Hatch Chili's into the mixture before cooking. Lastly, as a "test

This recipe reminds me of one I use for Cheeseburger Macaroni.  My husband loved it and said to make it again.  I followed the recipe exactly, I added chopped fresh mushrooms and a little garlic, while I was cooking the hamburger.  Very filling.

So simple and delicious. I used 1 pound of beef instead of two, and cooked the noodles till they were almost done before adding them to the mixture. The hubs suggested adding mushrooms next time... I'll definitely make this on a regular basis.

Great way to use up those little bits of leftovers. I had exactly half a bag of noodles. I adjusted the servings to half. I had one pound of hamburger left and half an onion. 
Could use some more flavorings, but to do a review based on the recipe alone, I didn't add any. 
I had a small bag of frozen corn. Works just the same. 
Will make it again, but add more like peppers, more onion, and spices.

Good dish and quick to make. I halved the recipe because there is only two of us. For me it was bland and not enough “sauce” because it was more on the drier side than creamy side. My 11 yo said it was good but not to make it again,she’s so picky. I made the recipe as is and if I ever do make it again I’d add more flavor and maybe milk or more condensed soup or sour cream thank you for the recipe, quick simple and it did taste good.

It is alot of food if I may say 1st,next time it will be 1/2, Use a deep casserole dish is a must, 13-1/2 x 9 will catch you with your pants down.
 I would alter it a bit, add some water or milk perhaps a full cup, soften onions before adding the meat in. 32 ounce of cheese seemed like alot but in the end it was fine,  i used colby jack and cheddar, a few more noodles perhaps if you want more. all in all yes, I would do this again and again. I ran short on sour cream, used  cottage cheese to fill the void. made it my own.

I used 24oz. of cheese and put 8oz. in the mixture before baking. During the last 15 minutes, after the cheese is added to the top, I increased oven temp. to 375° so the cheese would brown. Great comfort meal!

Way too much cheese and not enough noodles.  Nothing exciting about it.  Basic hamburger dish.  Wouldn’t recommend unless you just want a fast dinner with no quality.

I made this verbatim and it was a huge hit with the men in the family. I personally felt the cheese could be  cut back a bit, but still loved it. I had no trouble getting everything in a 9x13 pan.

I used cream of celery soup instead of cream of mushroom.  I give this recipe a 5 star rating.  Kids and adults just loved it!.

This recipe was a hit with the four of us.  I reheated it the next day and the noodles got a little overdone, but I added some cooked white rice, and everyone said it was still delicious!  Real comfort food!  I will make it again!

Super easy to make. I used about 1.5 lbs. of hamburger, no corn. As suggested by another reviewer, I cooked the egg noodles first, mixed them with a cup of cheese and the rest of the ingredients, topped with cheese and then just warmed it through for 20 minutes. The whole family liked this. I would definitely make it again.

It's easy, and pretty tasty. We followed the instructions to a tee, some of the noodles were not done, probably due to a lack of liquid. So we added a little milk, heavy cream and more cheese to it and put it back in the oven for a little longer. I like it, my sister doesn't.

This was one of the easiest casserole I have ever made!  My husband and my 6 year old twin daughters absolutely loved it.  They think I have slaved over making this dinner but of they only knew how easy it was!!!

Tasted amazing but it doesn't fit in a 13×8. I had to put it in a 15x9 and it still overflowed. And I didn't even use all the cheese!  LOL

I made this  exactly how it said to make it.  My son and I really liked it! I gave it 4 stars, because my husband and other 3 children didn't like it and I had tons of leftovers that were wasted. If I make this again,  I will cut the recipe in half.

This recipe was delist. I made just 1/2 a casserole and omitted the cream of mushroom soup and it turned out great. Definitely would make this again. Rich and creamy.
