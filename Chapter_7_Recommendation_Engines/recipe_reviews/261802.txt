I used herbed cream cheese (garlic salt and parsley) and Parmesan cheese because its what I had on hand. It turned out amazing! I made it a second time using pesto and ricotta! Also delicious. There's so many varieties to make with this!

Easy, quick & festive.  I used goat cheese and tomato basil pesto per directions, but I may try cream cheese next time, as I always have that on hand.  I added green dye to the egg before brushing it on top, and the grated cheese over this made it look like a flocked tree. Guests loved it and it looked pretty; however, it wasn’t very good reheated the next day, so that’s one downside versus the Nutella version of this holiday offering.  Loved it and would make again!

Everyone loved it.

I sprinkled bacon bits on top as well as the Parmesan and Oregano, just a couple tablespoons worth.

So very good.

I did it several times and found I could put quite a lot of filling in it. Try cream cheese, shredded cheddar, sauted  mushrooms and bacon.  It's impressive and delicious!

This turned out really cute. Easier than I thought it would be. If you like this kind of cheese (I really don’t, my husband does), then you will love it.
