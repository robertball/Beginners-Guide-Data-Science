I consider any recipe that calls for all ingredients you can  buy at Aldi or similar discount grocery store a good one! I omitted the cuke and capers and subbed evoo and vinegar for the Miracle Whip. I cooked frozen salmon, let cool and added feta. I mixed it all up with fresh spinach leaves and added a glass of wine. Great for summer, and winter when you need a break from the heavy dishes.

I must admit I'm not a big fan of Miracle WhipÂ® however it worked well with the salmon. The perfect light salad for lunch. I agree with the submitter that celery would work well as an addition.

I did not add the capers as I had none and maybe that would have added some flavor. I found this somewhat mild and added celery and some spices.

I used a creamy seafood mustard sauce instead of the creamy dressing and fresh dill. This was a tasty and simple to prepare bite.

This was a great change up to my salad choices. Loved it. With or without the miracle whip
