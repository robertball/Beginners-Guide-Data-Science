I just bought a "Vegetti" which turns zucchini into spaghetti and thought this recipe was perfect for my first use.  Delicious.  I am a bit fussy with seasonings but decided to follow the recipe.  Only differences were I used 1/3 the amount of salt and I sauteed the spices in olive oil before mixing with the tomatoes.  I did use my favorite brand of organic tomatoes (Muir).  Net result was fantastic.  I particularly like that I cooked the zucchini as directed and it came out "au dente".  Lovely!!!!

Zucchini Spaghetti Haiku: "Really just a sauce, albeit, a tasty one. Just WAY too much sauce." 3 zucchini weren't nearly enough for this recipe, and I had to quick make a pot of noodles to supplement the much-needed filler. Maybe if the tomato sauce can was an 8 oz. instead of 15 oz. or if the recipe specified the zucchini in a cups' quantity instead of just "3 zucchini." Truly, the meat/tomato sauce WAS great tasting, but after mixing the zucchini noodles into it (the current photo for the recipe has the sauce just spooned on top of the zoodles), they just disappeared altogether.

We loved it! Turned out exactly as described. I (always) use soy crumbles instead of ground beef, and also didn't read the shopping list correctly when shopping so ended up with an 8oz can of tomato sauce rather than the 15oz the recipe calls for, so I about 5oz water to make up for lack of liquid. Otherwise followed recipe, and really enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing!

Just made it without any meat-delicious! I recommend spreading the spiral zucchini on a cookie sheet lined by paper towels and sprinkled a little salt on to help dry out first before you cook it.

This was very tasty, everyone loved it. The only changes I made was I used a lot less salt and Morningstar vegetarian crumbles instead of meat. I also added a bit of cheese on my sons.

Very delicious! The only thing I changed was I used sausage instead if ground beef. I keep everything else the same. Definitely will make it again.

The only thing I changed or added were diced onions and mushrooms to the sauce.  I'm sure it would've been great without the changes but when I think of spaghetti sauce I must have mushrooms and onions.

I used a spicy Mexican style tomato sauce and nixed the red pepper flakes. Much spicier and just as delicious.

We made this without meat. We saut√©ed yellow squash , green bell peppers, carrots, and zucchini and added to our sauce instead of using meat.

The taste was 5 stars, but the ratio of sauce to noodles was way off--I could have cooked six zucchini! Thus it only gets 4 stars. But I will make it again, and again, and again.  Yummy!

I tweaked the recipe and added a can of coconut milk and it tastes better than the vodka pasta sauce at the store. The coconut milk is key! It gives a rich creamy flavor.

I used an Italian seasoning blend, with the red pepper flakes, salt and pepper.  I also used marinara sauce instead of the tomato sauce and what not.  But the overall idea of the sauce and cooking the zucchini noodles in the sauce worked beautifully.  Delicious with the seasoned tomato sauce and zucchini!

This was delicious, especially the sauce! I like my sauce to cook longer, so I added some water and cooked it until it thickened. I also used fresh basil because I grow it on my porch. I cooked the zucchini for10 minutes, but it was a little crunchy. Next time, I would cook it longer.

The family loved it!  I added mushrooms and spinach plus doubled the zucchini, excellent!  I used ground turkey instead of ground meat and blended it with spices before putting it in the pan with garlic and onions.

Too spicy for me. I would need to reduce the spice quantities a bit to enjoy it. Also, I think I prefer ground turkey over ground beef in red sauces.

This was my first dish I have ever cooked in my entire life and my whole family absolutely LOVED it! We are only starting to venture into a Keto lifestyle therefore the zucchini pasta definitely gave a good first impression of the diet. It tasted like actual spaghetti, only crunchier. Thank you so much! I will definitely do it again.

If you are looking for a low carb version of spaghetti, look no further!  I didn't miss the pasta at all. Used all the spices called for, added a sprinkle of sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes and sauce. I used precut zoodles from the geocery store so adjustments to the amount of sauce were necessary. It didn't ruin the sauce at all. I will make this again and again!

I've made this recipe twice. The first time I adjusted the salt content. It ask for 1 tablespoon. This is significantly high and will make your dig very salty. I used 1 teaspoon which is enough for me but one can adjust to their liking. The second time I decreased the thyme as I found it to be a little to strong for me. I used 1/4 teaspoon instead of a 1/4. Again, adjust to your palate.  It's a pretty easy to prepare and tasty. My 14 year old daughter actually liked it. I suggest using a vegetti or something similar as cutting the zucchini is time consuming.

We actually really loved it. My husband hates vegetables but when I made this he was very surprised. I used morning star veggie crumbles instead of ground beef and it was still yummy. And I used 3 to 4 zucchinis instead of two, but overall great meal. We will definitely make this again.

I made this spaghetti because my son is a "PASTA" monster and we decided to try a different recipe everyday for 30 days. I must say that this is one of my new favs. PERFECT in everyday.

Thanks so much for this new addition to my kitchen arsenal.

I used my home canned tomatoes for this recipe and skipped the red pepper flakes (I'm a wimp!). My tomatoes just so happened to be on the thicker side so I also skipped the tomato paste. Sometimes my home canned tomatoes come out a little on the watery side and if that was the case I would have definitely used the paste. And since my hubby wouldn't be eating this I took the opportunity to add fresh onion and also fresh garlic to the sauce and added some basil because I love basil. Using a spiralizer made cutting my zucchini a breeze. I am picky on how my sauce is on my "spaghetti" whether wheat pasta or zucchini noodles - I don't like to coat the entire strands in the sauce so I just ladled the sauce over my noodles. Yum!
