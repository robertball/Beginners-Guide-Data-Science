I made a lot of modifications to this recipe. Based on the previous review that said the muffins were too dense, I used self-rising flour instead of whole wheat. I realize that reduces the nutritional value, but the muffins had to be tasty, too. I added a bit of ground flaxseed, left out the oil, and increased the milk. I subbed pecans instead of walnuts, because that's what I had on hand. Oh, and I made some with chopped apple instead of blueberry. All in all, they turned out well.

I added some cinnamon, and since I had sweetened applesauce to use, I put only 1/4 c. brown sugar, and they are just right on sweetness.  A delicious and healthy recipe - love the inclusion of Greek yogurt!

Delicious, healthier recipe for a blueberry muffin! My almost three year old and I eat them right up!

I try to stick to the recipe to review it, but a couple minor changes here.... 1. I used whole milk not skim, as that's what we have and use and I believe whole is actually healthier for you anyways. 2. I used 1.5 cups of blueberries and no walnuts. We're just not that into nuts in breads/muffins.

These were a little too heavy for my liking, and they stuck to the muffin papers. They are a nice option for those who are into healthier muffins, as they are not overly sweet.
