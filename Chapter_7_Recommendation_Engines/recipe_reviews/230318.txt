I tried this recipe last Thanksgiving at my mom's house. You are correct the dish didn't look appetizing so not many touched it at first but when they realized that it did taste better than it looked there was none left over. I did send my family the video on youtube, so they could find instructions and the recipe. 
I used white mushrooms because that was what I had on hand and canned corn. This year I all be using frozen corn and the porcini mushrooms. 
Thank you so much for the accidental deliciousness I will be making it for church potluck on thanksgiving and also for our family thanksgiving dinner.

Amazing! I used more porcini than the recipe called for, almost twice as much, probably. And pro tip: the first time I made it I left it in the oven as long as the recipe says. The second time I shaved off about 8 minutes and I thought it was even better! Was a little more moist. Wow! What amazing flavor. Perfect for the holidays, goes great with any protein. ***tip: if making for holiday meals with gravy, save the delicious porcini water, strain it through some paper towels through a fine mesh strainer  to get rid of the grit that sometimes comes out of the mushrooms, and use it in your gravy!

I added some chopped celery and red bell pepper for color. Made it for Thanksgiving and my family LOVED it.  Nobody noticed it was unattractive, just that it is all gone. I will definitely make it again and not just for the holiday.

This came out great. I used fresh mushrooms instead of dried, no cayenne (I don't like spicy), no green onions (didn't have any), fresh corn instead of frozen and added sweet onions and sausage. I halved the recipe since it was only for me (saved some for the next day). It did take longer to bake. I baked it for 45 minutes....Some people were saying that it comes out looking ugly. I didn't find that. Mine had a nice browned crust. I let it sit for about 30 minutes (cornmeal holds heat well) and it didn't fall apart when I used a spoon to serve. Looked fine and tasted even better. I will definitely make this again.

I made this for Thanksgiving 2018. It was in place of a traditional corn casserole  that is more of a souffle. The casserole transported uncooked very well. Cooking times were right on. It was good- a cross between stuffing and a corn casserole. I gave it 3 stars because it is a bit sweet and has a confusing taste profile. Is it corn or stuffing you are eating? Anyway, I wasn't a big enough fan to make it again.

I had never made stuffing in my life & needed a recipe. I made this & I thought it was the best stuffing I have ever ate. Thanks Chef John.

I liked this.  I will make it for myself again but not a crowd.  It was the most leftover side of the day.  I will say it was better the second day.  I also wished I had served it in a nicer bowl.  It would have jazzed up the presentation a bit more.
