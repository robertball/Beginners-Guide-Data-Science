This dip recipe is absolutely delish! The secret is the seasoning salt. So good! I used dried herbs (in smaller amounts) and the dip was fabulous!

I love this recipe but I did make some changes. I looked at all of the reviews first and I lowered the amount of salt by half. I also preferred to put in real fresh minced onion. I also minced green onions (a stalk) & just threw in about 1 tablespoon,( but you can add more or less for your own particular taste) and threw that in the mix for more flavor as well. I followed the rest of the recipe & I just stirred everything in real good & it tastes great. This is a great creamy, fluffy, thick vegetable dip that isn't as loaded in salt & additives like the store instant dressing packets contain. It's also very simple to make as well! I love it! Thumbs up :)

I made it as stated. But was disappointed in the high salty taste. I had to add a lot more mayo and sour cream to tone the salt back down. I know that depending on what brands of season salt you buy, the amount may need to be adjusted.
After making this with only 1 teaspoon season salt, I really like it! And I will make this again, just not with as much season salt.

This dip is very good, but I found it to be too salty. I added more sour cream and mayo to make up for it. (Btw, used reduced fat sour cream and Kraft mayo with olive oil to cut down on the fat and calories.) I also doubled the amount of dill and parsley. Next time, I will cut the seasoned salt to 1 teaspoon. Very good recipe!!

I made this but did not have fresh parsley on hand, so used dried. The herbs/onion were SPOT ON with flavor. I think the minced fresh onion is so important, though. What I didn't like was the excessive taste of the mayo (hence why I gave it 4 stars), and I only used 3/4 cup to start instead of 1 whole cup. I balanced it out with about 1/4-1/3 cup more sour cream and then it was PERFECT. Everyone (we had 10 people over) went crazy over the dip.

Love this dip.  I didn't have any seasoning salt, so I substituted half the amount with regular sea salt, and the other half with chili powder.  It was a hit!

The family loved it.  I did add a little more dill, but that was the only change. This makes surprising more than I thought.

This is my go to recipe for veggie dip. Won't be buying the little ranch packets anymore! Everyone who tried it, loved it. I also used dried herbs, like the other reviewer noted, because that is what I had on hand.

We liked this dip; it was a little mild for us, so we jazzed it up with more dill, used both fresh and dried minced onion, and added two green onions. Also cut the salt in half - more would have been too salty for us. Very good served with fresh cucumbers.

We loved this!  I made half a recipe which was more than enough for three of us.  I substituted dried herbs per the suggestion of others and used low-fat sour cream and mayonnaise. I will definitely be making this again. Yumm!

i did a twist on this and used different herbs and spices and i made about 1/4 a cup and made toast to dip it in. Also I added some sheaved carrots and I thought it needed a bit more so I also add, and this may be weird, but a little but of Arby's sauce. All around great and it inspired me. Cant wait to try it when I have some fresh veggies!

I do not like to rate adaptations of a recipe so I started with the original. I agree with those who found the recipe far too salty and tasting too much of mayonnaise. I had no more sour cream so I added plain yogurt. I found the end product only acceptable.

This was easy and versatile, it's a great base recipe that allows you to customize the favors with the herbs you have on hand. I made this for Christmas as an appetizer dish for my veggies and guests loved it. Use fat free sour cream and may with olive oil for full flavor and less calories. :)

Used more SC than mayo (to taste), fresh minced onion, 1/2 tsp of Lawry’s season salt.  Easy and tasty!

I absolutely LOVE salt. It's a major food group for me. So when I say that 2 teaspoons of seasoned salt is too much, believe me. Most people would find it inedible. I ended up adding more sour cream and more mayo to help tone it down, but it was still very salty.
I'd recommend a single teaspoon of seasoned salt to start with; maybe even less if your palate is sensitive to salty foods.
I used Lawry's seasoned salt, if that matters. Perhaps other brands would be less salty; I can't say for certain.

Next time I'll add a little something with kick, probably  Tajin. I also used all dried herbs and used dried chives instead of green onions. All ages LOVED it, including the granddaughters. I used light sour cream and olive oil mayonnaise.

I made this and did cut back on the seasoned salt quite a bit...probably used 1/8-1/4 of a teaspoon at most.  Went over great at a party I brought it to. I have made similar dips and this was perfect because it was quick and I had everything I needed to make it.

Very good--wonderful on hamburgers.  I cut mayonnaise back to 3/4 cup as others recommended, and I was glad I did.  Also cut back on salt.

I'm picky when it comes to veggie dip and don't like anything you can purchase at the grocery store. But, I like this. I did change it a little - just used dried parsley instead of fresh and didn't add the dill - and it worked out great.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

A delicious and quick dip for raw veggies!  I use dry/dehydrated herbs, and it's still a hit!
Try it with greek yogurt instead of sour cream for a wonderful alternative!
YUM!

Great dip.  Good for a change from ranch dip for veggies. No one ate the ranch dip at the tailgate get together. Good for dipping Stacis bagel crisps too. Yum

We loved this!  I made the recipe as written except didn't have fresh herbs, so used dry herbs and cut the amount in half.  I didn't notice the saltiness that many other reviewers complained about, but I like salt.  No one at the pot luck I took it too complained either.

I added a little bit of curry, about 1/4 tsp, and 1/2 tsp of sea salt instead of the seasoning salt.

added salt only to taste and some powdered lemon. Many variations ( i.e. toasted garlic, barbeque seasoning, chopped capers) love this base recipe ! So easy....

This dip is fantastic. Everyone loves it. Like some of the other reviewers, I reduced the seasoned salt by half – 1 teaspoon is enough to give it some flavour. The only other comment I would make is measure your sour cream and mayonnaise carefully. If you add too much mayo, that’s all you’re going to taste.

Easy dip to make and excellent for a basic veggie dip. I felt 2 tsp seasoning salt would be far too salty. Used 1 tsp seasoning salt (no MSG added) and it was the perfect amount of salt for our tastes...and this is coming from someone who loves salt! Didn't have fresh ingredients on hand, but subbed with dry, using 1 tsp dried parsley and 1 tsp dill. I think the dip would go well with plain chips too, but veggies are the healthier option! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Halves well, good easy recipe, but I think I'd reduce the salt.  It does mellow over night, but it comes off a bit salty if you make it day-of and only have a few hours of fridge time.

I needed a dip last minute and this one perfect with a few substitutions. We're not a fan of mayo so I always substitute if for Greek yogurt and add olive oil for a little fat. I didn't have fresh herbs so I used dried and it was just  as good.  I would definitely make it again.

I also used dried herbs as mentioned in another post.  Also added black pepper, ground garlic, and a little basil.  Tastes delicious, thank you!

I couldn't imagine how this would be but I was in a BIG hurry. I didn't even have the herbs I needed OR the seasoned salt but I made it anyway and the seasoned salt too with a recipe found on Allrecipes. Everyone LOVED it! And me, I am addicted! It's fabulous on Ham sandwiches, and pork burgers with homemade sauerkraut! To DIE FOR!

Simple yo make...used light mayo.  Turned out great.  Much better than and salad dressing dip you can buy.  The fresh dill really makes it.

Made this dip for our Easter family gathering. Everyone loved it. It was gone within the 1st hour. Never saw them eat so many veggies. Just because of this dip. I am making it again for sure!!
