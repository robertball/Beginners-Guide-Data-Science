it tastes and smells just like Taco Bells baja sauce! I left out the bell pepper and added a little extra jalapenos. I can't live with out it now.

Pretty close to Taco Bell's Baja Sauce. VERY simple. I would make this again but I think I might try this with half sour cream next time and increase the garlic powder and cumin. Heat-wise, it's perfect.

This is an amazing tasting sauce, I cant get enough of it. Feel free to throw in an extra jalepeno if you like a little spice. Also they don't mention it in the recipe, but when you chop up the bell pepper, jalepeno and onion, it actually produces enough to make more than 2 recipes worth. So if you want, double up on the mayo/vinegar/spices since you will have enough of the other mixture for more than twice as much.

This was a great sauce! After letting it rest for 5 hours I tasted it and it seemed a little bland for me. We added 1&1/2 tsp. more of the pureed mixture to the mayo mixture.  As well as an extra 1/8th tsp. eash of cumin and garlic powder.  We let it sit about 2 more hours and it was great!  We served this with Southwestern Eggrolls from this site and they went well together.

As with a few other reviewers the "all mayo sauce" was a bit heavy.  After talking with a few other people the next batch will replace the mayo with sour cream.  I put sour cream on my tacos anyway... and I discovered that a local Mexican restaurant uses sour cream in their sauce.

I suggest doubling up on the first part of this; use 1/2 red bell pepper, 2 jalapenos & about half of an onion. Then mix the 2nd part of the recipe as stated. I mixed half of the pepper mixture with the mayo mixture. Then reserved the other half of the pepper mix in the fridge. Later in the week I used it blended with some melted butter to have as topping for crab cakes. This was incredibly yummy both ways, with the mayo mix AND with the melted butter! It's also simple enough to make it to your liking... add more or less jalapeno, depending on how spicy you want it. Also, some of the reviewers thought the mayo was too heavy. If you feel that way, just add a few more splashes of vinegar. Overall, a great recipe that is versatile and extremely tasty. Well worthy of 5 stars!

Pretty good - next time I'd probably do half mayo and half sour cream because the mayo taste was a little too heavy for me

I used my stick blender to puree this. It worked great and it was fast. I enjoyed this on chicken tacos.

Pretty close tot he taco bell version.  I found it hard to puree such a small amount of stuff.  And as others have said, the amount of peppers and onions listed makes enough for a double batch.  I did double the mayo and other wet ingredients to make up for that.  Next time I will try roasting the pepper and onion first.  I think it will intensify the flavors.  I didn't find it to mayo-ee as others said, but I will play around with using some non fat plain yogurt or non fat sour cream to lower the fat content in the sauce.

Love this recipe! I don't totally puree the pepper mixture, I just mix enough so that it is super finely chopped. Since there is so much pepper mixture left over, after I scoop out the amount needed for the sauce, I add more onion, some fresh garlic, and some cilantro and process again. Add to chopped tomatoes w/ some lime juice. Now I have baja sauce and pico de gallo!

This was wonderful....I ended up using a whole bell pepper and half of an onion with the jalapeno, I didn't seed the jalapeno, so adding the extra bell and onion mellowed out the heat for my kids. But when adding it to the mayo, 1 used a total of 8 tsp of mixture and I did 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup of sour cream and added 1 tbsp chili powder, 1 tsp cayenne and 1 tsp paprika and Man Alive was get awesome. I'd rate this a good recipe, because it is a good recipe, we just modified it a little more for us.

To me this tastes just like the baja sauce at my favorite mexican fast food place, which is what I was hoping for.  It's great on quesadillas.

This has become a family/friend favorite. We add more jalepeno and sometimes some cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit. I also use LITE mayo to cut back on calories.

I loved this sauce. I used this with chicken tacos. I also diced up onion and tomatoes with some lime juice for some acidity and topped the tacos with shredded lettuce. Very good and so fresh!

Fresh tasting but needs to be intensified more next time. I had let it rest for several hours until dinner time. It paired very nicely with our pan-seared striped bass.

This sauce was great, we made grilled stuffed burritos just like Taco Bells and with sauce it really made it perfect.  I did everything just to the recipe with a few exceptions, I read the other reviews and I used a little sour cream in it as well, and I used all the pepper mix instead of a few tbs.  It was great!

This was a good start to a sauce that really complimented tonight's dinner of fish tacos (I used a Beer Batter recipe from this site to fry the fish - yum!). I used a half cup of canola mayonnaise (if you haven't tried it, I really recommend it. It tastes the same as regular mayo but with lovely Omega-3 goodness), and a half cup of fat free plain yogurt. I also minced the jalapeno, and used green pepper because that was what I had. I also minced up some fresh garlic instead of powder, which I always think has a bit more flavor. Very simple and quick, and when I put it together with my fried fish and shredded cabbage it really did remind me of vacations at Rosarito Beach in Baja. Thanks!

I love this sauce!  I did substitute the mayo for sour cream.  It came out very light and flavorful.  We had it on tacos last night and tonight I'll be serving it w/ fried Tilapia.

Yum! I made this super easy on myself by defrosting part of a bag of frozen onion/bell pepper mix, throwing in several slices of jalepeno from a jar, and mashing it with my potato masher.  Estimated the mayo, vinegar, and spices, and had a terrific sauce in minutes. My husband, who loves Taco Bell Baja Sauce, said something is still different, but that this is great.  He said, "Now all you have to do is figure out that Bloomin' Onion sauce."  Thanks for the recipe - we were thrilled.

Great sauce! We added it to steak burritos along with rice and beans, then grilled them in a G.F. grill. The sauce really added more flavor. We loved it.

As with others the mayo was heavy. Now, I use half mayo, half sour cream.  I use all of the pepper mixture, not 4 tsp.  It's perfect! I've made it 5-6 times since I found it. It tastes just like Taco Bell Baja Sauce. I also use it in place of tarter sauce/remoulade for fish.  I have folded in room temp cream cheese to thicken it and served it as a dip for nacho chips.  It's simple, uses regular household ingredients, has tons of flavor and is versatile.

Was great! We had a green pepper and red onion on hand, and used that. I processed all but the mayo, then mixed together. I also put more of the processor mix in so the mayo flavor wasn't as stong. 2 jars, gone in 2 days.

Very Good, but only for about 1-3 days. After that it liquified.

Great sauce for blackened fish tacos with a little shredded cabbage and avocado!  I've made many times and many variations, but in the end I settle on roasted red pepper instead of raw, and half light mayo/half light sour cream.  I don't always use the jalapeno either and will spice up with ground red pepper or cayenne.  I always make it the night before so that it can get all delicious by the time we use it.

Totally awesome sauce. I will be making this again many times. Great on my fish tacos. I used 1/2 mayo and half sour cream like another reviewer mentioned. I also added all of the puree and it was perfect. Nice and spicy! Even tasted great when I tasted it right away and then we ate it on the tacos after only one hour in the fridge.

A very nice sauce to compliment many of my Spanish inspired dishes definitely a keeper. I like a little bite to my sauce, and a few more jalapenos did just that. great recipe.

I really enjoyed this ... I prefer with a 50/50 mix of mayo & sour cream tho.  Great as a topping for spanish rice, tacos, etc.  Similar to Taco Bell baja sauce.

This was really really good.  I made pork Carnitas and had this as our sauce on the corn tortilla  with the carnita meat.   My hubby really liked it.  I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream and put a tad more jalapeño in it for the heat.  I think next time I will spice it up just a little bit to fit our taste.****UPDATE***** I USED ALL LIGHT MAYO THIS TIME AND THINK IT WAS MUCH BETTER!  IT SEEMS THICK BUT ONCE IT SETS IN THE FRIDGE FOR 4 HOURS IT HAS GREAT FLAVOR....FOR NOW ON JUST MAYO!****

I love this recipe!  I changed it just a bit for my taste.  I used fresh garlic and instead of a rich mayo flavor I split the portion of mayo with mayo, soften cream cheese and sour cream.  I love it on fish tacos!

I love fish tacos but have never tried to make them myself because I was worried that I couldn't duplicate the baja sauce from my favorite restaurant for fish tacos(Chuy's). I made this sauce and was thrilled with how easy it was and how DELICIOUS. yumyum
