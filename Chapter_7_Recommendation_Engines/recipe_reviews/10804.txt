If ever a recipe deserved five stars this one is it.  A few thoughts, I followed the recipe exactly because I was in a hurry and didn't have time to read the reviews.  Wish I had taken the time.  Other reviewers are right in you really need more chocolate for the top.  Also, maybe because we lived in such a humid area, but I had trouble getting the peanut butter layer spread.  I ended up finding a plastic spatula sprayed with Pam worked the best.  Next time I will add the additional crumbs to stiffen up the mixture.  Also, hands do not work well, even when buttered because they heat up the peanut butter and cause it to release more oil.  These are super rich and I cut them into small pieces.  I figure I got twice the number the recipe stated.  These were super easy, fast, and I will sure keep them in mind for future use.  Last though, mine never really set up, so I ended up having to store them in the fridge.  Not a huge deal, but a thought if you are planning to take them somewhere.

Very Good! I did follow some other posters and added more graham crumbs (1 3/4c) and cut back on the butter (2tbs) for the topping. Also used used 1 1/2c milk chocolate chips. My husband says they are better than reese's! Thank you!
Wanted to edit my review to add that I froze 1/2 of these and you could not tell the difference between the fresh and frozen! I cut them into 1 1/2 in squares wrapped individually in plastic wrap. And placed them a freezer bag.

I have made these peanut butter bars a few times now and they are always a big hit at work.  After melting the butter, I add the peanut butter to create a creamy mixture.  I combine my graham cracker crumbs and confectioners' sugar together in a separate bowl and then add these dry ingredients to the peanut butter/butter mixture.  The ingredients come together much better this way!  I agree with using 2 cups of chocolate chips and 1-2 tablespoons of butter for the topping.

This recipe is good - like a square version of buckeye candy - but it needs a lot of alterations!  First, make sure your graham crumbs are extra fine (don't crush by hand - use the processor) Second, soften the peanut butter in the microwave before adding and the mixture will spread easier. Third, pour into a cookie sheet or 9x13 pan instead of a jelly roll pan (too thin!). Fourth, double the chocolate in the topping and only add 2 tbls butter (otherwise it's "greasy").

This was easy and excellent.  I did what some  suggested and added about 1/4 cup more of graham cracker crumbs.  Also I added the whole 12 ounce bag of chocolate chips to the melted butter. It coated it perfectly.  (Just a side note about the peanut butter, 2 cups is a whole jar of peanut butter plus a heaping tablespoon or two.  Very good recipe Lisa.  I will be making this again. (I went to work tonight and came home to over half the pan empty...the whole family loved it!)

Incredible for a low-cal dessert! (Just kidding).  These bars are great!  I used an 11"x17" jellyroll pan.  For the topping I used 2 cups of milk chocolate chips and it covered well.  Also, no need for 1/2 cup butter in the topping ... just a tablespoon or two will do (even with the increase in choc. chips to two cups).  Very good.  Will make again.

I've been making these for the past year and can't believe I never took the time to give my review of them to say how fantastic they are!  The only change I made was to add more chocolate;  to the 1/2 c. of butter I add 1 c. milk choolate chips and 1 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips.  That seems to balnce it out perfectly.  I have to say, this is probably the BEST recipe I have ever gotten off of this site!

THESE WERE A BIG HIT BOTH AT HOME AND THE OFFICE.  I THINK NEXT TIME I'LL PUT CHOCOLATE ON THE BOTTOM AS WELL AND USE LESS FILLING AND FILL MUFFIN CUPS TO MAKE THEM LIKE THE REAL THING.  BEST PART IS THEY'RE SO EASY!!

Yummy! I made some alterations to this recipe, thanks to the helpful reviewers here. Used 1 and 3/4 cups of graham cracker crumbs, used 1 tbsp of butter for the chocolate topping and 2 cups of milk chocolate chips. I also used natural peanut butter, but that's just my personal preference. Awesome!

I used 2 cups semi sweet chips and melted with no butter, spread over top and everyone when crazy over them... they are absolutely excellent... i cut them into squares and wrapped them in red foil and put them in baskets with my other homemade candys and these were the biggest hit.. especially with the guys.. everyone loved them.. they are much better than store bought cups! thanks..

This recipe gets 5 stars with the following adjustments. My husband's coworkers have started asking me to make this for them again! After about 3 attempts, my last batch turned out the best. 
 
* a 13"by9" pan works great, and mine has a cover so it's easy to store.  
* use 3 cups of powdered sugar, NOT 4.  it's too sweet otherwise.
* crunchy peanut butter adds a good texture to the graham layer.
* only use 2 tbsps butter and extra chocolate chips for the topping. (I used nearly a full bag)
* cut the square soon after making it. it'll settle back and you'll have to cut it again, but the final pieces won't break or fall apart then.
* it's delicious but very rich, try cutting small pieces, you can always have two then. *^^* (in my 13by9 pan, I cut 36 pieces.)

This should be called "Chocolate Peanut Butter Crack" it's so addictive.

That said, I followed others' advice by:

*cutting the sugar down to 3c. 
*mixing the sugar together with 1 3/4c. graham cracker crumbs first
*adding the peanut butter to the melted butter while it was still in the sauce pan on the stove, so that it combined well before adding it to the dry ingredients
*pressed the peanut butter mixture into a 9x13" glass pan [lined in foil] by using the back of a metal spoon
*melted 1c. milk chocolate chips and 1c. semi-sweet chocolate chips with about 4 tbsp. butter for the topping

You cannot eat just one of these.

I halved the recipe & used a square baking dish. I used less butter & confectioners sugar & a bit more peanut butter. I still used the full amount of chocolate (a whole bag of semisweet baking chips) and just a bit of butter. I really don't think as written you would get a good chocolate layer on top. Everyone likes them, thanks!

This is the first recipe I ever made as a child and it's been my favorite for over 12 years!  There are a couple of minor changes to my recipe which I think make this complete.... 2 and 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs, and I melt the Peanut Butter WITH the Butter, it makes it MUCH easier to work with!  Oh and add 1 more Cup of Choc chips for the top...refrigerate 30 to 60 mins and enjoy!  Oh, one more thing, cutting with a plastic knife helps!

Fantastic!! Quick and easy way to make a great treat...try 1 3/4 cups grahm crumbs (one sleeeve) and the entire jar of Peanut Butter. An 18 oz. jar is 2 cups and 2oz. of PB. Just throw it all in to avoid sticky measuring. Freeze Great too!

These are excellent, but 1/2 cup of butter in the topping is overkill.  The butter is only there to make the chocolate easier to cut.  You only need a tablespoon or two.  Also, cut down on the sugar a little and add more graham cracker crumbs.  The peanut butter and chocolate is sweet enough.

I give these five stars for being so easy to make and for tasting just like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. I made them for my students--college age--and they loved them. So these aren't just for kids! Let the pan sit out (from the fridge) a few minutes before trying to cut them into squares. If you do, they'll cut very easily. Also, I used two cups of chocolate chips like the other reviewers and agree that it would be difficult to get by with less. Thanks Lisa!

I've made this a few times and love it!  It's amazing.  I followed others' advice and used more graham cracker crumbs (1 3/4 cup), and actually replaced a bit with plain breadcrumbs, just to cut back a bit on the sweetness.  I used natural peanut butter, b/c that's what I had, and it didn't make any difference (except that I needed to add salt to offset the sweetness of all that powdered sugar!).  I ran out of chocolate, so I wasn't able to follow the advice to double the amount, but I definitely will next time!  Best no-bake treat ever!

This recipe is primo.  I made a similar recipe from off of this site, but this one was much better.  I will make these again, and may mix 50/50 milk chocolate chips and semi sweet chips.  I'm also thinking that I might make these egg shaped for easter.

These are AMAZING. my father asks me to make them at least once a week. I would reccomend using less confectioner's sugar, however, otherwise they're painfully sweet.

Yes, this recipe is very sweet and rich, but isn't that the point?  I thought it was great - just eat in small pieces at a time.  Very easy.  MUST use more than 1 cup of chocolate chips on top.  1 1/2 cups is perfect. Milk chocolate is best. Spray your hands with a little Pam and use your hands to smooth the base into the pan.  Keep chilled.  Excellent.

Good, but very rich!  After eating a couple of peices, I was turned off by how sweet they were.  A little does go along way so I recommened small portions.  I did double the chocolate like many others because I could not see how 1 cup of chocolate chips could have been enough for the entire pan.  I also had to substitute graham cereal for the crackers since I forgot to pick some up at the store.  I do not recommend this substitution...this may have been why mine were overly sweet.  Probably won't make again but glad I gave them a try.

These came out really rich, but also really good.  I really liked them, but you can't eat too many of them, you'll get sick of them because they're so rich... just look at how much butter goes into it!  I tried subbing in 1/2 cup Reese's peanut butter chips for 1/2 a cup of the peanut butter, but I couldn't tell that they were in there.  I also didn't completely pulverize the graham crackers (because I did it by hand with a wooden spoon), so there were some nice crunchy bits in it.  Goes really well with ice cream.  The next time I'm going to make it more chocolatey (probably by making less peanut butter portion), because the peanut butter portion mostly overwhelms the chocolate.

I'm just learning how to bake and cook, and these turned out to be a hit!!!! They were delicious!! I made a few changes: I added 2 cups of chocolate chips instead of 1, and also left out the butter that the recipe wanted to mix in with the chocolate, and it turned out really good. I'll defintely make these again!

This is probably the simplest and most outstanding recipe I have found. I agree - reduce the butter - it's a bit much for the topping. Increasing the graham crackers does make it better. One thing I think is that you could try different mixtures of chocolate for the top. "As is" this is probably the best simple dessert you can make. This is perfect for teaching simple cooking to kids or those who don't cook because it's a very basic recipe.

We made these just this past week and they were gone in one day. I had to hide them because my 5 year old kept sneaking them! This is definitely the go-to dessert for any peanut butter and chocolate lover.

I've tried a couple variations of this recipe, and this one is the best! I could eat the whole pan! Made a couple variations: used 9 x 13 pan. For the topping I used a whole bag of chips and only 1/4c butter.  I let the pb mixture sit in the fridge for a half hour before putting the chocolate on.  After putting the chocolate on, I chilled for 45 minutes then scored the chocolate. I found that made it easier to slice them up once completely chilled.

These are so easy and so yummy! I didn't spread the mixture over the whole jellyroll pan so that they would come out a little thicker. A 9x13 probably would have been the perfect size. So, so, so good!!

I melted my butter in the microwave and poured  12 of it on the mixture.  When it seemed too dry, I realized I had not put the amount I was suppose to put in so I added the other 12 cup.  I lightly sprayed the bottom of the pan with butter.  Then after I had it all pressed in the bottom of the pan, I realized I left out 23 cup of the graham cracker crumbs.  Needless to say, I didn't go back and add them.  I melted my topping in the microwave as well.  I must say, they are WONDERFULLY YUMMY and attractive as well.  This is definitely a recipe for my

These were delicious.  I messed with the chocolate & butter measurements, so it wasn't as easy to spread on top of the peanut butter mixture as I had hoped.  The taste was still great though.

These squares were delicious with a capital D.  I followed the suggestions that others gave and they tasted just like the real thing.  I did have a little trouble completely mixing in the Conf. sugar.  But it didn't matter my family thought them a delicatescent and my husband not to make them too often because he can't stop eating them; very rich.

Easy, Tasty. I doubled the amount of chocolate and used crucnchy peanut butter (because it was all I had) and it turned out great. I made extra and froze a bunch for snacks later on. They are so good frozen! Just cut them into bite size pieces and enjoy.

Outstanding!  These taste awesome and are very addicting!  I agree with others that next time I'll add a bit more chocolate (maybe 1 1/2 cups) on top to give it a bit more chocolate flavour.  But otherwise they taste just like the peanut butter cups.

These taste fantastic.  I made them last night to bring to a party this weekend.  It was a little difficult to mix the confectioner's sugar with the other ingredients.  The kitchen was a little messy by the time I was done.  The end result was worth it.

So good! Only quibble is this is too sweet and gooey as listed. See tweaks below.

Changes to peanut butter base: 
- 2 cups graham cracker crumbs
- 2 cups confectioner's sugar

Changes to chocolate topping:
- Use entire bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips (12 oz)
- 1/4 cup butter

After refrigerating, the chocolate may be brittle due to using less butter; allow tray temp to come back to room temp before cutting.

My grandmother made these when I was a kid. I have been looking for the recipe for a while and finally found it on here. I made these for my Husband to take to a pot luck at work.  They were wonderful.  I did use more chips for frosting and used as other reviews suggested about 1/2 cup more graham cracker crumbs.  Awesome recipe!!!

I made this recipe for the first time last night. I am not much for measuring things (makes more dishes to clean). I used about a cup (more or less) of Smart Balance. 1 two pound bag of confectioners sugar would be 4 cups (turned out to be too much) so, I only used half of the bag and one package of graham crackers which I crushed with the flat side of my meat tenderizer while placed inside a ziplock bag. The peanut butter mixture was perfectly sweetened with 1/2 bag of powdered sugar (and I love sugar!) and with the graham crumbs, holds together perfectly. I would as one reviewer said use the food processor or in my case my Ninja the next time to get the crumbs ground a little finer. Texture didn't make a difference as these taste amazing! I used a whole pkg. of semi-sweet morsles and 1/2 C. Butter. I made everything on the stove top since I am a naturalist and have read some scary things on how the microwave actually heats food. I chilled this in the freezer for 25 min. and my fiance and I pigged out. The next morning after sitting out on the counter overnight covered in plastic wrap the chocolate and peanut butter are still holding together perfectly and taste great at room temperature. This is definitly a five star, go to recipe for peanut butter squares!

This is my most requested treat that I make! I have been making these with my mom since I was a kid. I do have a few changes. I do NOT use any butter in my chocolate topping, I simply melt a full package of MILK chocolate chips in a bowl in the microwave and spread it on. I use a large rectangle pan and refridgerate for about 1 hour before cutting into squares. I store mine in the fridge but my mom stores hers at room temperature...so it's just whatever you like better. I always make a double batch because they seriously dont last! I use creamy peanut butter but Im sure crunchy would be fine too. Lately, when Im crushing the graham crackers...I dont make them so fine, so they have a little crunch. After reading some of the reviews about maybe adding a little more graham...I dont measure out my crumbs. Gragam crackers usually come in a box with 3 packs. I just use 1 and 1/2 packs. So for a doulbe batch I use the whole box. It may be 1 1/2 cups like the recipe says but Im not sure. You can adust most of the ingredients to what you prefer. It's hard to mess this one up. Have fun and enjoy! These are AWESOME!

Go to no bake cookies. Great addition to Xmas cookie list as they are different and get devoured! Easy at any level to make. Just don’t substitute anything else for graham crackers - does not come out the same!

Made 1/2 of the recipe and put into an 8X8 pan.  Letting these set up in the fridge is the key to easy removal from the pan.  They cut into perfect squares and were a favorite, especially with the kids, at our party dessert table.

this recipe is more like 4.5 as written - but as others have said, you definitely need to decrease the butter in the chocolate part to 2T, and milk chocolate chips would be much better than semi-sweet.  otherwise, these are to die for.  the graham cracker crumbs in the PB mix sounded weird to me, but made the texture so similar to a reese's pb cup... oh my we were in heaven!!

Yummy! If I would have read reviews I would have put more graham crackers in.  I could tell right away that 1 cup of chips wasn't going to cut it so I added more.  Will make again!

Also great if you use rice krispies instead of the graham cracker crumbs. Over all, it is a delicious recipe

These are chilling as I type!! I did them in mini cupcake liners in my mini muffin tin so they will resemble a reeses pieces.  I put a dollop of chocolate at the bottom and then a dollop of peanut butter mixture and another dollop of chocolate.  I KNOW these will be rich so I'm guessing a small sampling of these for a candy basket will be plenty!  Can't wait to try these!! YUM!  The only thing I did differently was to add an extra 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  The rest of the recipe seemed to be perfect consistancy.

DELICIOUS just the way it is! I did put in less confectioners sugar, thank you to the other reviews-- just about 3-3.5 cups instead. The peanut butter is pretty sweet on it's own. Everyone in my office now knows me as the girl who makes the best peanut butter bar thingies. Everyone wants the recipe and is always questioning the amount of butter.. but that's what makes it so good :-). Love it and is now my go-to recipe if I don't know what to bake for an occasion. Big hit and SUPER easy/quick. Thanks!!

These are good. I put mine in 9x13 dish. This makes a lot. It def needs more chocolate. Double if not triple the amount called for. I tried both semi-sweet and milk chocolate. We prefer the milk chocolate. Also I skipped the butter step in with the chocolate and used a little olive oil instead. It set up perfectly.

These were good but not nearly as good and creamy as the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.  Reading the reviews, I eliminated the butter in the chocolate topping and increased the amount of graham cracker crust and chocolate chips used.  4 cups of confectioner's sugar??  My gosh.

These are great! Everyone at church asked me for the recipe. The only thing I changed was that I only put 2 tablespoons of butter with the chocolate when melting it and I added more chocolate, based on previous reviews.

For all you health nuts out there...I used "Smart Balance" peanut butter, made my own powdered sugar (use 3 cups splenda in a blender), and substituted unsweetened applesauce for the butter. They turned out great! :) Also planning on freezing atleast half of them to have in the next few months...

These are fabulous! I added a little more crushed grahams as stated in previous reviews and would not do that next time I made these. It made them a little on the dry side, but that was my mistake:)

GREAT! Better than the candy bar. I added 1/3 cup more graham crumbs. I made mine in a 9x13 pan and used the entire bag chocolate chips as many suggested. It was just perfect. Everyone at the pot-luck loved it! Will surely make this again.

omg, these are amazing.  rich, chocolatey, peanutty... everything a reese's lover could ask for, but better.  i agree with a few other reviewers:  double the amount of chocolate chips, and they DO taste exactly like buckeye balls but w/o the labor of dipping.  next time i think i'll add some rice krispies to the bottom layer (a la buckeye balls) to add some crunch.  WOW!

Made this recipe 2x--once for my workplace, once for husbands-- rave reviews by all- dieters begged me to take them away as they are addictive, but very rich.  Few adjustments as previously suggested-- double choc chips and used 2 Tblsp shortening (ran out of butter) instead of 1/2c-- also 1st batch was a little dry when I upped the grah crax  (crumbled when cut)- 2nd batch was perfect-- will make again-- makes alot & is a crowd pleaser!!  Thanks

I followed most of the suggestions given in previous reviews & had the same great results.  I increased the graham cracker crumbs to 1 3/4 cup and used about 1 3/4 cup of chocolate chips.  This was super easy to make, especially because I had the pre-crushed graham cracker crumbs on hand.  The only suggestion I have is to use a large enough sauce pan for the peanut butter mixture.  I used a 2 quart and had to transfer it into a larger bowl to completely mix everything.  I finally had to knead it by hand to get it evenly mixed.  This makes way more than 18 servings if you cut them into small squares.  It is very rich so one inch squares or a bit smaller are perfect.  Will definitely make this again as it is an easy treat for the holidays.

Yum! My family has the same recipe and the only thing we do differently is to melt down Hershey's bars instead of semi-sweet chips (or you can use milk chocolate chips). I think they're even better than peanut butter cups!

Easy, but entirely too sweet and rich.  They are like a bug huge pan of peanut butter cups.  Not a healthy snack, and just too rich for dessert.  I melted the peanut butter for about 30 seconds in the microwave which made it really easy to mix everything together.  I used more chocolate chips also like other reviewers suggested.  It was fun to make once, but I won't make it again.

This is a yummy recipe, but VERY rich!  I followed some of the other suggestions by adding more chocolate chips and cutting some of the butter out.

Make sure you don't make the same mistake I did by trying to cut them too soon after cooking....they fall apart.

We'll make these again for special occasions.

I'd give it 5 stars for how easy this is to make,
5 stars for how much you get out of it , with 3 hungry little boys this is very important.
And 5 stars for the taste! they were really good, completely addictive, although VERY rich, you can't have to much at one, which I thought was a good thing until I found myself cutting off a little square, oh, every 10 minutes or so.
Thankyou very much for this great recipe, we will deffinetly be making this again.

I used a bag of milk chocolate chips and 1.5 TB of butter for the topping- it was perfect!  My husband refused to let me bring it to his parents for a party- he wanted it all to himself (I brought some anyway and they all loved it)!

SUPER!! I know this is what all the reviews say...but you cant get too much of a good thing! These were extremly easy to make... I melted my butter in the microwave not the stove and then mixed those ingredients in a large bowl. I also ended up using close to 1 3/4 cups of chocolate chips...the mixture looked oily without the extra...it turned out perfectly. Cut them small though because they are rich (however I have eaten more than I needed since making them)
A winner for a great treat that is super easy to make!

I AM THRILLED WITH THIS RECIPE! THE MAGIC INGREDIENT IS THE GRAHAM CRACKER CRUMBS.  THAT IS WHAT IS MISSING FROM ALL THE PEANUT BUTTER CUP RECIPES I HAVE TRIED. THIS IS SO EASY TO MAKE. I AM AFRAID I WILL BE MAKING IT MORE OFTEN THAN I SHOULD. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!

This recipe is truly amazing! Many friends have been unable to return to the store bought reese's cups after indulging in these. I use all milk chocolate and sometimes chunky peanut butter for a twist.

Lisa, I'd like to Thank You for sharing your yummy recipe. With summer break,the kids out of school, I needed something to keep them busy. Came across your Easy to follow recipe for my 11 year old son Scott. As for his review, Easy to follow directions. His comments: "These Are Awesome!" As for his older brother, he is enjoying eatting them all up.

These are amazing!  Based on previous suggestions I doubled the chocolate (both the chocolate chips and the margarine) and they turned out perfectly.  I won't even admit how many of these I ate yesterday.  Added peanut butter to my grocery list already... LOL

5 stars! Not to sound like a broken record but these really taste like the real thing! The only thing I would suggest is adding a little more chocolate because the peanut butter over powers the 1 cup.

AWESOME recipe!!  These were loved by my family.  They taste just like Reeses' peanut butter cups!  But beware, they are very rich.  I highly recommend these to anyone who loves the combination of peanut butter & chocolate!  Thanks Lisa.

Deeeee-lish!  I agree with the other reviewers on cutting down the butter for the chocolate topping and using a deeper pan.  I actually used my hands to press the peanut butter part down and that method worked best for me.  We loved these and the recipe makes a lot, so we shared with EVERYBODY.  Thanks!!

I AGREE WITH USING LESS BUTTER IN THE TOPPING ITS TO GREASY.. I CHANGED IT BY LAYING WHOLE GRAHAM CRACKERS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN BECAUSE THEY ARE EASIER FOR LITTLE FINGERS TO HOLD & IT MAKES LESS OF A MESS & ADDS XTRA CRUNCH!! I ALSO USED CRUNCHY PB INSTEAD OF REG.. IT WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!! I HAVE MADE THESE TWICE IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS BECAUSE EVERYONE THAT TASTES THEM REQUESTS MORE :)

These taste five-star; however, they were not so easy to make per instructions. I did read various reviews, but decided to follow recipe exactly first time. Only change was not to do as much butter with the chocolate chips; I actually didn't have enough chocolate topping so I quickly threw a bit more chips in the microwave and melted w/o butter - was actually easier to spread than the first batch that contained butter. However, mixing the other stuff together in the melted butter was difficult - oh and actually I did warm the peanut butter up a bit since I could see it was going to be difficult. So I think next time I will put dry ingredients together and melt PB and butter together then combine, as another reviewer mentioned. I also think as is, it needs more of a chocolate top and less of the graham/PB bottom. So will tweak to find my balance, but I will definitely make again....and again....and again! I thank you for the recipe but then I don't...sometimes feeding your addiction isn't always a good think! No really, thank you though! :)

I just made these and they're not that great. Definitely not worth the calories. I scaled down the recipe to make 12 servings and prepared it in a 9x9 pyrex dish and i still cut 16 huge squares out of it. Too sweet and too heavy. Half of one square gave me an instant stomach ache. Will never make again.

Made as per the recipe with the exception of using a 9 x 13 baking dish. It was excellent!

Absolutely delicious!  Tasted just like a Reese's peanut butter cup.  I used 1 bag of milk chocolate chips, I melted the peanut butter with the butter.  So much easier.  The only thing I will do different next time is to use a 9 x 13 pan.  They were just a little bit too thin for me.  Took them to work for a party and they were a big hit!

Not really impressed.  I followed the recipe and it was nothing like Reese's which other people suggested.  I didn't have enough graham crackers to add extra as suggested, so I will give it a try again with that tip, but otherwise wouldn't bother making it again.

This was sooo easy and came out great.  I rewarmed the sugar mix in the microwave a few times for a few seconds so it was easier to mix, worked perfectly.  It tastes just like Peanut Butter cups !! I never would have thought of graham cracker crumbs in the peanut butter - perfect !!!

I followed the recipe as it is and it is delicious.  I prepared it in a 9x 13 glass baking casserole.  I think I might add more chocolate next time because I think a thicker chocolate "shell" on top would make it even better.  I chilled it in the refrigerator for a few hours before cutting it and I made the pieces small because it is sweet.  Tastes just like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups!

Yumm-O!  I changed the top due to what I had on hand.  I am sure it was great as written.  I did cut back the powdered sugar.  I added 2 c of crumbs.  My top was choc. bark and I think extra so I added a little milk and just a little coffee.  They are not completely set but I just took a little bite and OMG good!

I've make this recipe every Christmas for the past 25 years and now I'm being asked to make it for dessert auctions at school.  It's a hit!  I make it in a deeper dish (Pyrex) and use a food processor to crush the graham crackers and then to mix in the peanut butter, etc.  I also create little 'gutters' in the bottom mixture.  This gives each piece an interesting look when cut.  Lastly, the freezer is where I store these before serving.  Delish!

DH is the biggest Reese's Cup lover, and he said these were better than Reese's! I added 1 3/4 graham crackers, but the chocolate didn't stick to the peanut butter in some areas, so I might try the recipe with the regular amount of graham cracker crumbs next time. I added the peanut butter in to the melted butter first, then added the dry ingredients (which I had mixed together in a separate bowl per another reviewer) and that worked very well. I also lowered the amount of butter in the chocolate part from 1/2 cup to 2 tablespoons, and it still came out deliciously. I don't normally like Reese's and these are AMAZING! They're similar but much better. I'm taking a container of these to the office today, and I'm sure they will be a big hit. Thanks for this recipe! :)

I followed one of the review recommendations. I used a whole package of chocolate chips with 1/2 stick of butter and I used 2 cups of graham crackers. My husband LOVES them. He gave them a 5 without hesitating! They are quite yummy.

Tasted super good! My family ate the whole batch within a few days. Needs twice the amount of chocolate chips for the topping. Others have said to cut the amount of butter for the bottom, I wouldn't. I tried reducing the butter and the crust came out two dry.

I made these for a bake sale.  They were a hugh hit and they had people asking for the recipe!  These were by far not only the easiest, but the tastiest bars I've ever made...I highly recommend them, will make them again and I followed the directions to the letter...wouldn't change a thing!

I have made these three times now and finally finding time to write a review. My one piece of advice save a few squares if you want some for yourself before taking them to a potlock, party or any place else as these go fast and there are NEVER any left over to bring home! They are PERFECT as is! Thank you for sharing!

I had a lot of peanut butter once and looked for recipes. I liked this one because my son loves Reeses cups. This is a very strong contender to the comercially made cups. This is very very good.

I did not like this recipe at all!I thought It was way, way, way too sweet.I also thought there was way too much peanut butter,and not enough chocolate (even though I doubled the amount of chocolate after reading other reviews!)I do NOT see myself making these ever again.

It's okay. I thought putting butter in the topping was weird & it still didn't spread well. GO for the Peanut Butter Squares I on this site. They are SO GOOD. Taste just like a peanut butter cup.

This was a very delicious dessert, especially for chocolate peanutbutter lovers like myself! It was extremely rich, but very tastey! If you are a serious chocolate lover, then you will love this recipe. Next time, I'll cut the recipe in half before we had leftovers for awhile!

Very Good Rectpe.  I used Milk Chocolate,instead. Also, a tip on melting the chocolate. If you don't have a double boiler,use 2 saucepans. Put about a cup of water into the bottom pan,put on medium heat on stove,then put the chocolate into the other pan.Place the pan with the chocolate on top of the pan holding the water. Slowing stir with a wood spoon. If using solid chocolate,break apart in bigger pieces before adding to pan. This will help melt faster.   I prefer this method over the microwave,because a microwave has hot spots, a lot of times when using to melt chocolate,it was cause the chocolate to crust in places.

These are awesome! I followed the other reviewers' recommendations adding an extra 1/4 cup graham crackers and I used a whole 12oz bag of chocolate chips with only a tablespoon of butter. I used a 9x13 pan as well. I recommend using natural peanut butter (the kind you grind yourself that you can find in the health food section of most stores) for the perfect consistency. Just like peanut butter cups! I had this recipe a long time ago but lost it, so thanks very much for posting it.

These were just ok.  I like pb cups but these really didn't have the same texture. I'll try another next time. I like rich things and these were too rich!!

Super easy and tasty. I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan, which was a mistake. It made way too much and the squares were too thick. It still tasted good, though.

Very Rich!  Must be kept refrigerated or they get soft.  I used 3/4 c. marg in the peanut butter mix and only 3 c. powdered sugar.  Also, only 1/4 c. marg in the chocolate topping.  Kids LOVED them!

This was OK but not as good as I expected. Everyone was excited about trying it but very few had seconds. I ended up eating only the chocolate.

These are soo good.  Everyone asked for the recipe at my son's birthday party.  I actually used crushed rice krispies instead of graham cracker crumbs.  They were good but might have been better with the graham crackers.

I found it a little hard to mix because it was so thick and I noticed little specks of powdered sugar throughout the mixture because of that. Also, I think that next time I would use milk chocolate for a more peanut butter cup taste.

Great crowd pleaser.  I would suggest using melting candy coating (available in craft stores or Walmart) to cover the top of these.  It is easier to spread than the topping suggested here, and has a nicer finish look.

I was looking for this recipe since my mom was not home at "baking time." -- This was it!!  I had time to read reviews and did make more choc. topping. (used the whole bag of chips)  I did not add more gr. crumbs to bottom though and it turned out fine.  I also used chunky peanut butter (what I had on hand) and it was wonderful!!!

Give this one 10 stars!!!!  My husband and kids loved this.  I doubled the chocolate and used 1/4 cup of butter with the topping.  Worked Great. Used a cookie sheet, thought it maybe to thin, but it was perfect.

Excellent and simple.  I used a 9x13 pan instead of a jelly roll pan (which I don't have).  Better than a reese cup!

These are really delicious.  My husband and family loved them.  You can use an entire package of semisweet chips without a problem.  I also used a smaller bar pan for thicker bars.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was so easy to make and everyone loved it!  I am just beginning to cook so I don't have a jelly roll pan (I'd never even heard of one), so I just used a regular pan and everything turned out great.  Be sure to give yourself enough time because mine needed a few hours in the fridge before they were ready to be cut.  Thanks

A little sweet, but oh so good, almost like the chocolate disk candy. Next time I'll cut back on the sugar and I think they'll be just fine.

These are so easy and incredibly yummmmmmmmmy. They are just like peanut butter cups and cut into perfect squares, so very little is wasted. I brought this to a potluck and the plate was clean in just a few minutes. It always makes me feel good when i see people going back for seconds..and thirds.

My grandmother used to make these all the time and I continue the family tradition. I use a 9x13 cake pan and use 3 to 4 cups of milk chocolate chips. She always used semi sweet. Great either way.

ok heres what you should actually do.

dont use any sugar at all. theres enough sugar in the chocolate and the graham crackers.

I use a food processor and puree whatever nuts i want to use. i often use pecans, walnuts, pistachios... you can use anything. I like making my own peanut butter that way when i do this because that also cuts down on sugar.

Also, if you have a food processor, make your own graham cracker crumbs. you can actually use any cracker. I prefer to use a sweet organic cracker like annies. I have also made it with chocolate teddy grahams and had amazing results.

basically you cant go wrong with this dessert but think outside the box and try to limit the sugar when its not necessary.

I read the reviews 1st and increased the graham cracker crumbs, which is the wrong thing to do, if you're using fresh ground peanut butter from the deli; worked better the second time using the normal amount.  I decreased the sugar to 3 cps and double the chocolate chips!  I'm not usually a big peanut butter and chocolate girl; but this is definitely a keeper!!

This tasted delicious! Only thing I'd have done different is put my graham cracker crumbs in the food processor. I found I could feel the crumbs too much lol (but that a personal texture issue). I used the 2 tbl of butter and it worked great with an entire bag of chocolate chips. Super easy and my friends and husband couldn't stop eating them ;D

This was fantastic! Can't wait for the kids to try!. So easy to make to. I added a quarter of a cup more graham wafer crumbs and slightly less butter for the bar. It was perfect texture for patting into pan. The chocolate topping I used half as much butter and slightly more chocolate and microwaved it til smooth. Perfect for covering!

Fast to make and popular with the pot-luck crowd. I like the addition of the graham cracker crumbs to give these squares a little more substance. Adding rice crispies works too!

I was hoping for more.  I think the base layer was too thick and a bit too sweet.  If I made it again I'd reduce the base layer by half and decrease the sugar to 3 cups.

These were delicious! I made a couple of changes that were recommended in some reviews. I used a whole bag of chocolate chips for the topping and reduced the butter to about 2 tbsp., and it was the perfect amount. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was delicious. I got so many compliments and was asked to make them again for the next holiday. Next time I will crush the graham cracker crumbs more fine. I used a 13x9 baking pan, but I think next time I will use a cookie sheet because they were too tall and they are so rich, I think thinner pieces would be better.

Took advice from other reviewers and used 1 3/4 C of graham crackers and cut the butter to 2 tbsp and doubled chocolate chips to 2 C. Came out perfect. Peanut butter mixture was hard to smooth out in pan but results were worth the effort

This is amazing! I made it before for a potluck meal and everyone was so happy with it. I've been getting requests for it so I had to come back and say how amazing it is. I did make it with less confectioners sugar (it was really sweet) but everyone is different. I just added confectioners sugar until it was right. 
I will definitely be making this more!

The recipe was very good!  A little sweet but I think that is kind of hard to get away from with peanut butter squares. When I was putting the graham crumbs in, I did not measure, just kept adding them until it made a good texture. I added Rice Crispies to my peanut mixture and that made it nice and crunchy! I think I will make it again but will look for a way to alleviate some of the sugar.

Since i am a diabetic i substituted the 4 cups of sugar with 3 cups of stevia and 1 cup  of brown and white sugar, and i did melt the peanut butter...worked great :) and it was Delicious! And instead of using chocolate chips i melted unsweetened chocolate squares

This recipe is EXCELLENT, with a few tweaks recommended by other reviewers.

I used 1 3/4 cups of graham crackers and, in the topping, cut the amount of butter to 2 tbsp and increased the amount of chocolate to 2 cups (if I didn't use this much chocolate, I don't think there'd be enough to cover it).

I made this in a 9x13 pan, which made them the perfect thickness!

These were easy to make and very tasty.  They're rather sweet, but not overly so in small doses.  I sprinkled coloured sprinkles on top so they would look better.  I will definitely make them again.

This recipe is very good. I used 1/4 cup of butter for the topping. I also put the peanut butter in the butter after it was melted. I left the peanut butter in there till about 1/3 of it was melted and it was easier to put in with the sugar and the graham cracker crumbs. i will be making these again for sure.

A tasty treat!  I took others' recommendations about lessening the amount of butter on the chocolate topping and only put in 2 Tbsp.  I also increased the amount of graham cracker crumbs to a little under 2 cups.  I would encourage extra mixing, because it creates a smoother bar; ours were a bit crunchy in areas where the graham crackers didn't get mixed in as well as they could have been.

These were pretty good, quick and easy to make, but they were a little too rich for my taste.  My family liked them but only ate one or two at a time. I kept them in the freezer for a while and they held up pretty well.

These squares were very good however I was very disappointed that they cut very poorly bad and presentation is hugely important to me. I did add about 1/2 cup more graham crackers but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Put them in the fridge to cool before cutting but unfortunately probably half of the squares in my pan fell apart :(
I most likely won't make again.

I added about 1/4 cup more graham cracker crumbs.  
I kept the 1/2 cup of butter the same for the topping, but i increased the semi-sweet chocolte chips to 2 cups.
I put it in a 9X13 pan to make them extra thick!
I put aluminum foil in the pan so i just had to lift them out and put them on a cutting board and cut them.

These tasted yummy, but not like the store brand. I spread mine over 3 foil containers so I could freeze some. I ran out of margarine for the chocolate top, but wasn't concerned as many reviews said you can nearly omit it. This was NOT true. You need a fair amount in order to spread your chocolate. I had to squish mine down with my hand and plastic wrap. Also I used close to 2 cups of semi sweet chocolate chips and I don't find you taste much of the chocolate at all.

Messy, gooey & clean up afterwards was time consuming. I followed recipe as is and will not make these again. I actually am so dissapointed i signed up so i could review. I love most recipes on this site but this wasted my time & ingredients. So many better pb & choc recipes then this. I gave 1 star because the filling had a nice flavor.

Tastes great!!  I followed other reviewers advice and went with a full bag of the Choc. chips (milk Choc.) and the add'tl 1/4 of Graham crackers.  The bottom set up nice, but seemed awfully dry prior to putting into the fridge and was too crumbly upon cutting it up.  Next time, I'll stick with the 1 1/2 cups of the graham cracker and see if it holds together better.  Tastes very similar to Reeses.

I tried this recipe with a few tweaks. I used natural unsweetened PB, I used a sweetener blend instead of sugar, and I used almond meal instead of graham crackers. No sugar/starch.    I didn't read all of the reviews before attempting a half batch. I felt wary of using all the butter and was rewarded with a batter too gooey to hold unless frozen.  Next time I'll use half the butter.   Also, just like other reviews I had to use almost twice as much crumbs to get a thick texture. I think that would be fixed by using less butter, also.    If I had used regular graham crackers this would have been too sweet. I used the equivalent amount of sweetener but the almond meal is not sweetened as graham crackers are so it toned down the sweetness a lot and made it just right.  If I were making it regular I'd use probably a quarter cup less sugar.    Finally I did read about the topping being to slick so I used 100% baking cocoa and just enough coconut oil to make it smooth enough to spread and when it cooled it was more solid than the filling.      I like the flavor of the peanut butter. it is just right. Now I just need to work on a texture that's safe for handling.

DELICIOUS! I followed early recommendations in terms of butter and chocolate chip ratio for topping, and more graham cracker crumbs. They are sweet but not excessively so - I have had to freeze over half of the recipe so I don't eat them in less than a week - very moreish. Living in New Zealand, we can't buy reeses peanut butter cups, so I am SO glad I have found this to satisfy my cravings.

Im giving this 4 stars because my husband loved them. They were too sugary for myself and the kids. I suggest using a whole bag of chocolate morsels or more to cover the top and cut down on the sugar.

AWESOME!!!  I made these last minute for a bake sale and they were the biggest seller :D  I did take previous reviewers advice and added more graham crackers and chocolate chips to it.  My personal preference is less powdered sugar as well but everyone else seemed to like it just fine.  Thanks!

Way way way too sweet.  The texture was nice. I thought the chocolate to  peanut butter ratio was off as well.

It was a huge hit at our Easter dinner!  It was like having a huge peanut butter egg in a pan!  I'm glad I followed some of the suggestions from the other viewers.

OMG. This is so delicious and easy. The only thing I added was 1 cup of milk chocolate chips to the topping in addition to the semi sweet chips.I made it 2 days ago and I am trying to give it to anyone who comes over before I eat it all.I will make this next Christmas and give it to my neighbors and friends.

Made this for a shower yesterday. If you love PB you will love this! I followed other suggestions and used 1 3/4c gram crackers and only used 3-4tbs of butter in the topping. I also used milk choc chips (what I had handy) and it turned out GREAT! No problems with it setting up like some others had.

Excellent! With the extra graham cracker crumbs, more choc chips & less butter as previous comments have suggested - OMG!!! Easy to spread in pan by covering with a piece of saran wrap & using your hands, quickly because if you linger the warmth of your hands will make little pools of butter on top. Super fast & honestly better than my favorite brand name peanut butter cups. Thank you!!!!

Awesome!  The peanutbutter filling tastes just like a Reese's, but better!  I followed the other reviews and added more graham cracker crumbs (love the crunch that adds) and used 2 cups milk chocolate chips.  These were awesome.

These tasted awesome!  I'm not a huge peanut butter fan, but they're still addicting.  I did have a few problems, my chocolate wouldn't melt in the microwave and ended up turning into a frosting like substance that I "spread" on and I'm not sure if it is because I took another reviewers advice and added butter to the chocolate.  They looked really ugly, and when handling them they tended to fall apart, but the taste made up for it!

Our family loves this recipe! I will make it again, only I will probably cut the recipe in half and use an 8x8 pan so that we won't eat these for a week straight. I used 3c of sugar, 3/4c of butter and 1 1/2c of graham cracker crumbs. For the topping I only used 
1 1/2c of semi-sweet chips with 2 tbsp of butter.

Fantastically Addicting! I used organic peanut butter which changed the texture of the bottom layer but it wasn't bad.  I also substituted cinnamon graham crackers (it's what I had) and it actually made for a nice complement to the chocolate I used (62% cacao dark chocolate).

I thought these were okay. I don't think they are comparable to Reese's PBC. I tried making these in foil cupcake liners... they turned out too thick. I'll try making them again...but a different way...

I have made these many times.  Every time, they get gobbled up so quickly.  The only change I make is to melt 1/4 cup white chocolate chips with 1/2 teaspoon shortening in a zip bag.  Then I cut the tip of the bag off and drizzle the chocolate across the top of the peanutbutter bars.  It just  makes them prettier.  I have also made the bars with white chocolate on the peanut butter mixture and have drizzled the top with semi-sweet chocolate.  Yummy!

If Reese's cups is what you're going for, this is very close for being homemade.  HOWEVER, if you are a true Reese's cup fanatic, like my husband, I don't think it's really possible to every totally replicate them!  I made bars and mini cups with a mini muffin pan and regular mini liners.  If you're going to try making the cups, I'd suggest using foil cup liners...I just used single paper liners, and they became SO oily/greasy!  Very cute in the end, though.

Very good! I use low fat butter/margarine. I added an extra cup of chocolate in the topping and mixed semi-sweet with milk chocolate.  Lastly, I used 3 tbls of butter in the topping instead of the 1/2 cup.:-)  It firmed up really well. Yum!  Ally

While I am clearly the minority here, I thought this was like eating a stick of butter, way too rich way too sweet.  Too bad I was looking forward to this.

Very yummy, my whole family can't get enough of them!  However, I made a couple of changes.  We're trying to cut back on sugar, so I only used one cup and that seemed to be fine, and then I cut the butter by a good amount as well.  I did increase the amount of chocolate chips and also melted some peanut butter to swirl in the chocolate.  Mmm!

I was skeptical about how these would turn out but after about an hour of chilling they came out perfect.  I made them with my daughter--this is a great recipe for kids to make or help with and we took them as kids snacks to our bible study group.  They vanished in no time flat, but I thought they were a bit rich.

Fantastic recipe! Made this for myself and my peanut butter loving dad it turns out we're not the only ones that loved it!  Everybody went crazy over it and it was gone in no time. I made in a 13x9 casserole dish. Used a little extra peanut butter (crunchy kind) Very good!!

Tastes exactly like peanut butter cups.  The only thing I changed was instead of 1 cup of chocolate chips, I used two.  Make sure that it is nice and chilled before cutting it.  Thanks Lisa

These were very tasty, but didn't leap off the plate like I was expecting. I really liked them though. Of course they did have a lot of competition from the typical Christmas eve favorites.

I remember this recipe from when I was a kid and loved it.  I've Never  been able to find the recipe until now.  Thanks Lisa.  They taste just like peanut butter cups.  My soccer team devoured them.

Tasted okay, but certainly not like peanut butter cups.  I was expecting something different.  It tasted just like buckeyes, only spread into a pan.  Way too sweet to eat in bars.

Very good recipe...makes a lot.  The peanut butter mixture really tastes just like a Reeses.  The only thing I would change would be to decrease the amount of butter at the end.  I don't like the taste of buttery chocolate.  Maybe if I would have increased the amount of chocolate like others suggested, the butter tast would have disappeared.

A really easy and very sweet dish.  I used 1 cup creamy peanut butter and 1 cup crunchy for some texture in the base, and I also used half semi-sweet and half milk chocolate chips for the topping, which cuts down on the bitterness.  All my friends loved them.

Initially, I didn't care for these.  Then the whole pan seemed to disappear.  They really are good and somewhat taste like peanut butter cups.  They are sweet, but I don't think I'd change anything.  They also taste really good frozen.  We'll be enjoying these again.

This is an unbelievable recipe!!! I did not have to change anything.  My family says this is the best all time recipe I have ever made and beg for it.  But Beware that the bars melt easily, so make sure they are kept in the frig until served!  Will use this recipe MANY times!! Delicious!

This recipe is just like Reeses peanut butter cups!  I used an 8x8 square pan and cut the recipe in half but left the chocolate chips and butter topping measures as is.  SIMPLY FANTASTIC!  My children and my husband devoured them.  Enjoy!

Oh My God!! These were wonderful. I got rave reviews from friends and family. I will make them a million times. They were very easy to make. I am a huge chocolate fan so I used a 24 oz package of chocolate chips other then that I didn't change a thing. I give this a huge thumbs up!!!!

These were great, and tasted just like Reeses.  I used a 9x13 pan, which worked, but there was definitely not enough chocolate.  I'll have to buy a jelly roll pan to try this one again.  The youth group loved 'em!

I love all the pb square recipes I've ever tried, so maybe I'm easy, but this gets five stars for sure!  I mixed the pb in with the butter on the stove becuase it was hard to mix in otherwise.  The heat melts it a bit and eases the mixing.  We nibbled on this for days.

I didn't have any graham crackers so I left them out. And it still turned out great. I took them to a friend of mine who is a peanut butter cup addict and he was in love! I didn't read any reviews before I made them, so I did it just like it said and I see no problem with the way they came out. Amazing!!!! Thank you for the recipe!

Great tasting recipe and it's very easy to make. I followed the receipe as is for my 1st attempt. But, I will definitely be making these again, and I will likely increasy the amount of graham cracker crumbs next time.

This is a quick and easy recipe and it is good, although it provides a quick and easy result. My cookie connoissoeurs are not impressed with this recipe, although my son was. It makes a large quantity of small cut pieces that are needed for my church social hour. I cut a recipe up into small pieces, layered them with wax paper, and put them in a tin and froze them. They thaw relatively quickly once put on a plate, so they are a hit with my church. Would be great to fix and freeze for school treats also.

I'm so happy to find this recipe. A schoolmate gave it to me about 20 years ago, while in high school, and I've been making it ever since... but recently I could not find the measurements (I remembered the ingredients, but not the amounts!) nor my original recipe. This is ALWAYS a crowd pleaser, there are hardly any leftovers, and it's so quick to make. Try it, you'll like it!
