Great recipe!  I would suggest using fresh ginger and adding some vanilla.  Also, I used whole wheat pastry flour for half of the flour, butter instead of shortening, and yogurt instead of sour cream.  I added raisins for some more texture.  For the frosting, I made a cinammon whipped cream cheese frosting and sprinkled the top with crushed walnuts.  I made the cake for a friend's birthday and everyone loved it.  The ginger really adds something special.

Wonderful cake. Moist and flavorful. I followed exactly except used a Bundt pan and baked for 45 minutes. Frosted with a maple-cream cheese frosting that I made very soft and sort of draped over the cake. Then I grated some hazelnuts and chocolate dust over the top - beautiful presentation! Thanks for the great recipe! OH. I used butter instead of shortening, too.

Very good cake!  I baked this for my sister's birthday, and it was very well received.  I just used a basic powdered sugar/milk icing, and there was more than one comment of 'best cake ever'.  I also used softened butter instead of shortening.

Very yummy cake!  Light textured, and nice with a cup of tea or coffee. It's very sweet.  Too bad maple syrup is expensive...

The flavor of this cake is wonderful. I made this as a layer cake, and it was quite an eyesore.  The middle of the cakes did not rise so nicely and the edges got kind of tough. I am new at baking cakes from scratch.. maybe my baking powder and soda was tired, maybe my maple syrup and eggs were too cold. I want to make this again.  I used Sour Cream Frosting as a glaze, and the flavors worked together nicely, but since the frosting turned out to be a glaze, it didn't hide my cake's defects. This cake is fantastic with coffee.

I made this for an office thing and everyone really loved it. I did a basic vanilla glaze and everyone commented it was perfect for breakfast. Not too sweet but flavorful.

The cake was excellent! :) Although, one flaw the cooking time was too long when I put the cake in for the recommended time it was overcooked.

I chose this because I wanted something autumn-ish but not something common at Thanksgiving like cranberry or pumpkin and fancier than an apple dessert.  The flavor was strong with 1 c. syrup even though other recipes like Martha Stewart's called for 2c. syrup. I thought the ones with maple flavor instead might be as tasty.
It did sink in the middle for me which I thought was due to being in the mile high city but I saw a Virginian baker had the same issue, so I'm not sure how to fix that. A cream cheese frosting piled up in the middle fixed the saggy appearance. If I had more time I wanted to grate some nuts on top. 
Thanks for sharing the recipe!

PHENOMENAL recipe. Had been given a can of  pure Canadian dark maple syrup and was looking for the right use -- this is it. Followed the recipe very closely; my only changes were using butter rather than shortening, doubling the cloves (an accident, but a happy one!) and a pinch of allspice. I cooked this in a bundt pan for 55 minutes, though I should mention my oven runs colder than most. After it had cooled I topped it with a maple-cinnamon cream cheese glaze (which was literally just store-bought cream cheese icing melted to glaze consistency, with a bit of maple & cinnamon added) and some crushed pecans. The result is a moist, spicy, flavorful cake that goes great with coffee in the morning or bourbon at a birthday bash! I'll definitely make this again.

The batter tasted delicious, nice & spicy with my favourite, maple syrup. But when I went to bake it the cake was still wobbly in the middle so I left it in the oven for another 5 minutes, then I turned down the temp & left it in longer, about 30 minutes more than the bake time suggested, I went to take the cake out & the outside was totally dried out while the inside still hadn't baked all the way. I know it's not my oven.

I made it as cupcakes. I filled them with homemade carrot marmalade and topped them with sour cream frosting. Soft, fluffy and gingery! Great recipe and easy to follow!

This is our new favorite cake recipe. Added raisins soaked in 1/4 cup water, substituted real butter instead of shortening. Made with homemade cream cheese frosting. Kept in fridge and each day, the spices really enhanced. Real moist. My husband loved it!

Everyone loved this cake!! Supermoist! I followed direction but only change I would make is limit ginger to 1 1/2 tsps. I believe a maple cream cheese frosting would work really well, but since I was out of CC I drizzled cake with salted caramel and topped off with chopped pecans. Delicious!!

This is great. I used grated fresh ginger, added some allspice and cardamom, and baked it in a bundt pan for 50 minutes. It is really moist and springy and I would absolutely make this again. Aesthetically, this cake would be gorgeous with icing or something, but I would be nervous about covering the subtle nuances with too much sweetness. Great cake! Thanks for the recipe!

Very good flavor because of the real maple syrup, and with a delicate texture. I made it exactly as written. I used the Maple Walnut Frosting recipe from this site, minus the walnuts, and it was a good match because that frosting is a light cooked meringue style that doesn't overwhelm the lightness of the cake. A drizzle would work well too.
