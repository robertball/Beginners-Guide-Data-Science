This recipe was quick, delicious, and the ingredients were inexpensive. I added sliced black olives to the top and sometime I want to really spicen it up with jalapenos. I definately recommend this to families because the kids will love it and it is done in no time at all. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

Mmmmm, yummy!  A bit time consuming, but worth it.

We don't like black beans, so we substituted with refried beans.  Everyone LOVED it! Will definitely make again.

This recipe was so easy! I'm a single, 22 year-old just looking to cook simple things that can last me a few nights and this is going on the list for sure! One thing I would say though is ditch the zesty italian, it added a taste that just didn't mix will with the other ingredients. Maybe a little more seasoning in it's place. Still love it!

Really great easy recipe! I made a few changes, using ground turkey instead of beef. I also added some mushrooms and yellow peppers that I sauted with the garlic and onions. I will make this again, it was so yummy, like a spicy Mexican lasagna.

I wasn't crazy about the flavor, maybe it was the Italian seasoning..

I browned the ground beef seperate from the half onion.  I sauted the onion in jalapeno juice.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  My entire family loved it.
No one added anything.....It was just the right spicey taste.

This was excellent!  I had all the ingredients on hand (except for the zesty italian dressing - I just used Good Seasons Italian) and it was super easy to make.  Followed recipe exactly and it came out great!! Served with a side of shredded romaine lettuce. This will become a regular meal in our house. :)

I really enjoyed how simple this was.  I used ground turkey and handmade corn tortillas, I also spread the sour cream on the tortillas to make it easier to spread.  Makes great left overs!

My Mom surprised my Fiance and I with this dish and it was so wonderful I begged her for the recipe.  Was surprised when she found it on allrecipes after we had told her about the site.  I defintely recommend this easy meal as it's now one of my favorites to eat & to make!!!  Healthy with lowfat cheese and still delicious :)

This was so good as is.  But I did top with sliced olives and chopped lettuce while it rested the last 5 minutes.  If it was just for my husband and me, I would definately add some sauted serano peppers and some more cheese.  Very easy and very yummy.

This is sooooo good.  My family just loved it.  I didn't change a thing.  The only thing that my husband added was he put some of the casserole on some extra tortilla's.  He loved it.  It is so easy to make too.

First time I made this I followed the recipe to the letter, cooked it in my West Bend slow cooker and really loved it, Second time I made some of the changes others recommended and I think I liked the original best....it is dryer and hotter but I liked that.

This dish is like - if lasagna and chili each went to Mexico for spring break and hooked up....it was really delicious!  I changed a few things though:  I used 1 cup of salsa and the other cup was a mixture of chili sauce (1/2 cup) ketchup (1/4 cup) and water (1/3 cup).  I used the water because I used my own recipe for taco seasoning which contains flour, so the mixture was a bit thick for us.  The end result was absolutely delicious - even the kids ate it!  We will make it again for sure.

This Was A Nice Change  From The Norm, Nice Flavor, Thank You. I Added More seasons such as Goya Sazon, Chili Powder, Cumin. And I Used Corn Tortillas Instead Of Flour  (Just My Preference).  And I Topped With Lettuce And  Tomato. Thank You For The Recipe.

5 stars for easy and good.  I use cumin and chili powder vs. taco seasoning.  Less amount of salsa,  everything else,  however as a different twist I roll them up in a tortia top with enchilada sauce cheese and black olive slices, bake and serve with sour cream to top it of after baking....I'm sure the orignal way is good too!!  Thumbs up !!

My family loved everything about this recipe except for the sour cream. I am not sure if it is because I used generic or if it was just the sour cream but it did not heat well. so we just put it on the top when finished baking

This was really good.  I did a few things differently though.  I did not add the salsa to the meat...instead I used it like another layer in the casserole.  I did add garlic to the onions while cookin before adding the meat.  Another thing I added was a can of corn....we like corn in almost anything that has a "mexican" flair.  I also didn't add the sour cream until it was finished baking as a topper.  Only had a little bit left over and hubby ate that the next day.  Will definately use again.  Thanks for the post.

This is so easy to make!  I followed the recipe for the most part but used ground turkey and Reeses original salsa instead.  I also saved most of the sour cream it calls for to add later and topped it with shredded lettuce and sliced avocado.  YUM!

This was great!  I used Medium salsa and it was just spicy enough.  I will try corn in it next time and see how that is. You could also call this Mexican lasagna.

Family Hit!!!  I added Olives and used medium Salsa...it wasn't too hot but had a kick. PLUS...it was so filling that I had 1/2 a pan left for another meal (or several days worth of lunches).   I can't wait to share this easy recipe with my friends.

So easy, SO good! Loved this recipe. 
I topped it off with lettuce and tomato, as shown in the picture. I had Frank's Red Hot ready to put on top, but it didn't need it. Very simple and really good.

WE loved this recipe.  I replaced the meat with vegetable crumble since I am a vegetarian, and even my husband loved it! (and he's not a vegeterian) Also added some sliced black olives.

This was great! However, I did make a couple changes. I added green pepper just to have another veggie. I sauteed that with the onion and ground beef and added a clove of garlic. I completely omitted the dressing fearing that it would make the meat filling too runny and the flavor was perfect without it! I made this for company and they and my husband RAVED about it! Will definitely make it again with the same modifications!

Not sure what happened, but tasted funky.  Maybe too much chile powder.  I used Bill Ehols taco seasoning instead of the taco bell version.  What I did was to divide this into two meals.  I used a 2 large round corrning-ware dishes which fit the tortillas exactly and made the three layers and repeated in the other casserole dish.  One to cook now and the other to freeze.  I also spread the sour cream on the tortilla first then layered the meat mix and cheese.  Made it a lot easier to layer.

Grubbin'!  Followed the recipe as stated except added a cup of corn and left out the sour cream so it could be eaten on the side.  The salad dressing is definitely what gave it a unique flavor though next time I may put in just a tad bit less than 1/4 cup.

This was yummy!  I used ground turkey instead of beef and topped with lettece, tomatoes and olives.  It turned out very flavorful, even the kids enjoyed it.  I served it with a side of spanish rice.

Much easier than making enchiladas or burritos, this recipe captures that mexican flavor I'm after when looking for something I can throw together in 20 minutes and let the baking do the rest.  Even my picky 5 yr old give it a thumbs up!

Used ground venison instead of beef and no onion. It was okay, nothing special. Tasted like a bean/meat/cheese appetizer dip to me. I would change a lot if I was to make it again; adding jalapenos, black olives, maybe no sour cream in it but on top after cooking. Wouldn't make again as is.
