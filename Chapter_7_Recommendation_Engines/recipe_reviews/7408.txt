It's more of cake-coffeecake, you get half-half, best of both worlds. It goes GREAT with coffee. I made it for my boyfriend's birthday at work. Some of co-workers admitted they've had FOUR servings of it. Next time I will try adding cinnamon for extra flavor kick, otherwise, it's so good the way it is! I used pecans instead of walnuts, after all I'm a Texan. :)

i tried this cake hoping that it would be a great birthday cake, but it turns out to be more like a coffee cake, something you would have for breakfast, not for dessert. i was extremely dissapointed. although it was a quick and easy cake, i don't reccommend it for a dessert cake.

Everbody just loved this cake, it is so moist.
It's more like a coffee cake, I guess you could
drizzle it with some icing.  Very good cake.

Wonderful -go to recipe. I doubled the crumb part, just because we love a dense crumb top. To make this cake quicker; I skipped the melting of the chocolate and just added the chips to the batter. It does have to cook 10 min longer than the 30 minutes it calls for. It has a nice coffee cake density with some moisture. Don't expect a birthday cake moisture.

I was craving some kind of crumb cake. I saw this recipe and thought I'd give it a try. It turned out great, loved the flavor and texture.  I'd give it a 5 star if my husband loved it as much as me.

I was not very pleased with the crumb topping.  Taste overall was ok, will bake again.

However, the receipe calls for 1/2 cup of milk for the cake, but I had to use 1 full cup of milk

Very tasty! I'm not a fan of very sweet cakes, so this is perfect for me. 

I did need to cook it for 45 minutes rather than the 30 the recipe indicates.

According to Google, a crumb cake has more crumb than cake, whereas a coffee cake has more cake than crumb.  Knowing that, I would call this a coffee cake, but it is a very good one!  I followed the instructions, including the baking time even though other reviewers had to bake it much longer, and it turned out perfectly.

Very good coffee cake that looks like it took more effort than it did.  I doubled the crumb mixture.  Easy cake that I will make again.

Definitely will make this again. The only change I made was using vanilla chips in the crumb topping instead of nuts. So moist and delicious.

I too felt this was more of a coffee cake. It took about 45 minutes to bake rather than the 30 indicated in the recipe. I found the cake light, but kind of bland tasting.
