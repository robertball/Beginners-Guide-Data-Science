I wonder if it was supposed to include an egg with the crab cakes, I had to in
order to make the cake stick together.  I also threw in a few of the bread
crumbs. I also question the amt. of flour to butter in the sauce, it made it too 
thick. The recipe did not specify when to add the lemon juice or the garlic.
The flavor was good overall.  I especially enjoyed the hint of hot sauce in 
the crab.

The directions were imcomplete.  There were ingredients that didnt go into the directions.  The crab cakes fell apart.  Way to much sauce for the crabcakes.  All around disapointed.
