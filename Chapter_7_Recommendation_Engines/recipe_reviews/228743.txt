These were wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly, except I did increase the flavoring to a full teaspoon for fear that the flavor would get lost. That was a good call because it was still a very subtle flavor. Because of the weather, I upped the flour by another 1/4 Cup also and believe that it was perfect. Used a cookie scoop for uniformity, baked for 15 minutes exactly. Once cooled, I did dip half the cookie in melted chocolate and topped some with the toffee bits and others with almond slices. A very nice addition to the holiday cookie round up. Thanks for a great and easy, straightforward recipe.

This was a fairly easy recipe to follow so not sure what happened, but the cookies weren't good. The texture was flat and nothing, they tasted like eating a pound of butter (and put I made sure I put in all the ingredients as listed). Sorry, I didn't care for them.

Always a hit when I do my holiday baking; of all the cookies I make, people ask me for the recipe to these most often.
