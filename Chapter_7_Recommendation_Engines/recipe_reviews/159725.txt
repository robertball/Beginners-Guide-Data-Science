As daughter of Mylo,owner of the Torch Cafe 1959-1982 It upsets my family when we see people giving out a recipe and saying it is my father's Original Finger Steak recipe. I would like to let all my fellow Allrecipe forums members know that it is not his Original recipe. My family are the only possessors of my dad's recipe and yes, he was the creator of the original. My Dad created them for his own restaurant in Winslow Arizona before WWII.After serving in the army in WWII he returned to Idaho. Mylo's Original Finger Steaks appeared on the front of the Menu's in "59" when Dad was owner of the Torch & until Torch was sold 82 then again in Yuma until 1984 at his 3rd Restaurant before his death.

My husband grew up in Boise and every time we visit we had to go to the Torch Cafe for finger steaks. He says these are the ones! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

My husband and I just didn't care for the taste. Also, we never heavily salt our food or eat very many processed type foods that tend to have a lot of added salt/sodium and so the salt content here was just too much. At first I thought that was why we didn't like the recipe so after I cooked the first few fingersteaks, I remade the batter using much less salt but then found the herbs to be too prominent. Just not our cup of tea.  I did think the batter was a very good texture though. It clung well to the meat and crisped up nicely.

I made this last night with the Blooming Onion and Daddy's fried corn and onions, and everyone liked it. I even used some of the onion dip to dip these fingers in. Very good, thanks for the recipe! BTW, I didn't change a thing, only lessened the ingredients becuase I only had a 2-3 lb. top round steak.

Oh my ridiculously good! We didn't season our meat or anything before and these were some of the best that we've EVER had. My husband grew up in Idaho and his family has made finger steaks all growing up and he couldn't stop eating these. One trick: tenderize the steak before battering them-- it makes them soak up the seasonings a little better from the batter and it makes them, well, tender. Also, you could probably cut back to about 1/2 of the salt or seasoning salt-- one or the other. I also followed some other's advice and made the sauce for the blooming onion...  WOW! We'll definitely make these again.

So...  we REALLY liked these.  BUT..  next time I will be adding garlic salt or garlic powder to them.  The batter definitely needs to be refrigerated.  It makes a leathery like shell on the finger steaks.  We live in the Boise area so we just might need to head over there and try these out.  I made the Blooming Onion and Dipping Sauce to go along with it.  The finger steaks in that dipping sauce is great!

I lived in Boise in the early '70s and ate at the torch many times. There was a drive-through restaurant that also had decent finger steaks. But I can not remember the name.  Thanks for this recipe. I will be making it soon.

Pleasantly surprised to learn that the finger steak originated in Boise; I grew up in the Twin Falls area, and my family now lives in Boise. I do remember eating fast food finger steaks as a teenager!   Tried this recipe tonight and it was ABSOLUTELY DELISH!  I will make this many times in the near future.  A couple of issues I had was that the batter was VERY thick, so I may use less flour (2 cups rather than 2 1/2) next time and play it by ear from there.  I also left out the salt, as recommended by other reviews, but I will probably cut back on the seasoning salt as well in the future.  Also realized I didn't have marjoram, so I substituted Herbs de Provence (thyme, marjoram, rosemary and savory) and this worked just fine.  BOTTOM LINE:  This recipe is a keeper!

These were not good at all. The batter turned all gooey and solft and had way to much worstershire sauce flavor. I was able to fix them by adding baking powder and more milk to thin it out and they were really good. The baking powder made them crispy and they were delish.

Delicious!! Native Idahoan and 20+ yrs in the Boise area. Can’t speak to the Torch comparison, but I’d eat finger steaks from anywhere with this batter on them. The flavor rivals anything I’ve had around these parts throughout my life.
Didn’t have marjoram, so subbed equal parts ground oregano and rosemary. Also left out the extra salt as others noted. Used with chilled cube steak strips.

I followed the recipe but the finger steaks tasted too salty and the batter seemed to be dry and thick. 

I used a 12" cast iron pan to heat the oil and cook with.
1st problem was controlling the oil temperature and I discovered I only had one thermometer that would measure up to 375°F.
2nd problem was oil splatter
3rd problem was making a quick transfer from the batter to the pan.
4th problem finger steaks sticking together.

I want to try it again but use a deeper pan and probably only one tablespoon of seasoned salt.

The theory is this recipe comes from the restaurant know as Torch cafe. The Torch was popular as far back as the 1930s when the offer was dinner and dancing. Later in the 1990s, it became a strip club. The Boise Jay-Cees used the recipe to sell finger steaks and raise money at the annual Fair.

As close as I can find to what I remember from the Torch cafe in Boise, ID. Leave out the regular salt.

We love these made with bread crumbs. But, this batter was not even edible.  It was bland and had a nasty texture. We peeled the cooked batter off and ate the meat without it.

I have an aunt in Idaho who makes this for special occasions. She is famous for it! It's amazing and this recipe is almost perfect. Careful with the salt. To make the dipping sauce mix Miracle Whip,  Ketchup,  Worchester Sauce, and course ground black pepper.

These were pretty good !  I live in Boise, home of "Finger Steaks" and have the supposed original recipe from the Torch Cafe.  But these sounded better because of the marjoram and thyme.   I used top sirloin steak, rather than round, because it's my favorite cut.    Next time, I'll cut the recipe in half-  2.5 cups of flour makes a LOT of batter.   I liked the texture of the batter, but didn't really taste much other than the cocktail sauce I dipped them into after frying them.  Great texture, and fun to have made these.  Yum.

The daughter of the owner should be ok with these recipes for the finger steaks served at the Torch Café.  Im pretty sure that he did not use a batter.  I walked through the restaurant one evening when I seen what I believe was finger steaks being breaded.  No batter. Just as a chicken fried steak is not battered nor were these.  The question is what was in the flour. The color of the flour is one of the ingredients but the rest is a mystery to me.

Thank You, Thank You, Thank You!  The Torch Cafe was one of my favorite places when I lived in Boise in the 70's.  This recipe brings back memories.  If you are in Boise, by the way, a good place for finger steaks at a restaurant is the truck stop that is on I-84, about 15 miles east of Boise.

My husband really liked these. I thought they were a little tough. The flavor was delicious and the batter stayed on very well. I haven't made them in a while, so I guess I will make them again soon.

Easy to make and tastes exactly how I remember them!  They were great!
