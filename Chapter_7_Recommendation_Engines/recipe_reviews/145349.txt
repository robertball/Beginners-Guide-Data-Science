I made this for the boys this morning. I used regular milk, regular JIF peanut butter and omitted the extra sugar. The kids had waffle fingers and sliced apples to dip in this. They seemed to like it--they sure thought a dippable breakfast was a great idea.

I made this but skipped the sugar and it's great! Next time I'll try it with sugar free pudding and see if it still tastes great!

This is delicious, tastes like the PB in Reese's Pieces.  You don't even need the fruit--just eat it with a spoon!!  It got my picky 2 year old gobbling up her fruit and anything else she could find to dip in it.  It does make ALOT though so you might want to invite some friends over to share.

I love all of the ingredients individually so I thought I'd like this, but somehow it's just a little weird. I'm not sure I liked the sour cream tang with the peanut butter.

This is pretty good, but I think I'll try a different one next time.
