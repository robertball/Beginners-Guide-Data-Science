This was great! I used instant rice, because I'm terrible at "real" rice, and it still came out VERY tasty!!! Instead of bulk sausage, I used link sausage (smoked keilbasa type) diced fine and used it to stuff a roasted chicken. Soooo awesome. I'll use the leftovers by itself for lunch tomorrow. I will make this again, going to try it as a base for red beans and rice!

Came out very bland.  I will try it again and bump up the spices.  Not sure why it's called "Cajun" - being from Southeast TX/Louisiana - this is nothing like Cajun.  Will also add some Creole seasoning next time.

Awesome recipe and a BIG hit with my Louisiana husband! Only MINOR adjustments I made were that I used a couple tablespoons of butter to cook the onion and bell pepper in a skillet & I made the rice in a rice cooker. Other than that followed the recipe as is. Thanks for sharing!

Great dressing! I served it beneath blackened salmon & it was a hit with my family. I did make some alterations, however. I used 1/2 the amount of rice & chicken broth & added garlic powder, onion powder, sea salt & Tony Chachere's creole seasoning to add some zest. Very tasty! Next time, I will actually use it as stuffing for a turkey.

We made this, and it was absolutely wonderful, as an addition to our Christmas Dinner. My husband is from Louisiana, and has made a similar dish for years. The only thing we did differently was tripled the onions and celery, pork and beef.

This turned out pretty good but WAY too much rice. I made as written but next time I will cut the rice back by two cups and leave all other measurements the same. I really enjoyed the sausage/beef combo and this is one I will make again. I sprinkled some Old Bay on the leftovers and that  worked nicely too.
