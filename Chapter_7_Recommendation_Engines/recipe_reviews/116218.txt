The recipe mentions adding honey to the sauce but I do not see an amount.  How much honey should be added?

These are very good. I put them in the freezer on a cookie sheet lined with waxed paper for 30 minutes before cooking and they held together just fine.  I added crushed garlic cloves to the red pepper sauce since my family loves garlic and it was excellent.

The crab cakes weren't our favorite but the sauce, after some modification, was nice. I don't know that I would be able to say that, however, had I used the hefty amount of Dijon mustard called for - I reduced it substantially.  Since shallots were in the ingredients I omitted the white part of the green onion. I chopped everything up real fine, not bothering with the blender or food processor for fear of overdoing it.  For its characteristic light crispiness I coated the cakes in panko bread crumbs.

The Red Pepper Sauce was to die for.  I substituted Jalapeno Mustard (Black Bear brand at Target)for the Dijon.  Wonderful!

Super easy and made 10 small to medium crab cakes.  I did have to add a little melted butter so they would stick together better.  Overall, wonderful recipe and the pepper sauce is the perfect compliment.  I made in advance for a dinner party and warmed before serving.

I only made the sauce, but it was very good!  I think a little less dijon would have been fine too.

This was my first time making crab cakes and I was nervous because it is my bf's favorite. He said they are the best crab cakes he's ever had! I followed the recipe except that I added one cup of crumbled ritz like crackers to the mix instead of using french bread, and I did not coat the crab cakes in anything. The trick is to freeze them for 15 min or so before cooking, and they came out perfect! I cooked for 7 min on each side since they were solid, but you could cook for less. We cracked the crab ourselves so it oculdn't have been any better. I also made the red pepper sauce which is PERFECT for the cakes. I have made this twice now. The first time I put in too many shallots and it was too strong. The second time I stuck to the recipe and it was perfect. Instead of Dijon I used a spicy honey mustard which was really good. I made them for his parents too and they also said it was the best crab cakes they've ever had. I was so proud that I made them! This recipe is DEFINATELY worth making, even with the time it took to crack the crab. Thank you so much!!!

I made just the red pepper sauce with the Maryland crab cakes on this site. I was looking for a different topping for my crab cakes and love this recipe. It is the best red pepper sauce on the site that I have tried. It was fresh and healthy. I used a sharp deli dijon mustard in this. I used chop on my blender and didn't blend real fine. My guests were impressed with this and you will be also and it really is easy to make. This will be my new crab sauce recipe to use.

These were fabulous! I didn't really change a thing with the crabcakes except add the chives and parsley to taste. And for the sauce I added a little jalapeno and garlic for extra spice. You could use this sauce with pasta or chicken--it's that good!

Like many other reviewers, I used my own favorite crab cake recipe, but did make the red pepper sauce.  It was good... quick and easy, but not as outstanding as I would like.  A little too much vinegar flavor, maybe.

Wonderful!  These taste just like the crab cakes and sauce that I order at my favorite restaurant.  I have been craving them every day since I made them.

I am rating this on the red pepper sauce alone as I have another crab cake recipe I use. I followed the recipe exact for the sauce and it is the perfect compliment for crab cakes.

Delicious!  I am rating this on the sauce only as I already have a tried and true crab cake recipe (Lori's Famous Crab Cakes, from this site).  Hubby and I agreed that the sauce is fabulous! I didn't change a thing and it was an excellent compliment to the crab cakes.  I especially liked the fact that there is no sour cream or yogurt included in the sauce.  I'm tossing out the old sauce recipe and replacing it with this one!

These were delicious! I made these ahead of time and took them on vacation to my parents cabin. They were a hit and the sauce was to die for. I have had made crab cakes in the past, but they always seems to fall apart. These stayed together and remained together for the entire cokking time. I will be making these again.

So delicious and so easy.  I used boxed breadcrumbs instead of the french bread to save time.  Also, I shaped the crab cakes into balls and baked them in the oven on 400 for about 15 minutes (until browned) to eliminate all the butter and oil.  I will definitely make these again!

I made the recipe without changing it (well other than using a loaf of fresh mountain bread instead of italian) and it was the BEST crab cakes I've ever made or had. You don't need to change a thing (no eggs, nothing). Just make sure to press the breading on the crab cakes and pat them so it really sticks.  And the red pepper sauce was perfect with the crab cakes. Even my son and husband who are somewhat picky eaters loved it.   Definately a GREAT recipe and a keeper.

Only made the sauce and it was wonderful! Didn't have shallots or parsely and the flavor was still great. Used the juice of half a lemon rather than 1Tbsp.
