9-26-2018 ~I must confess I made these only because I was desperate to find something to do with an excess of jalapenos from my garden.  I mean, much as I love them, you can only eat so many jalapeno poppers. That said, I gave these a try.  I made these just as the recipe directed and would do so again.  The best testament to how good these are is that Hubs, in spite of his sensitive innards, has been making nearly a nightly habit of nachos.

I would definitely make these again and I am making future plans to grow more jalapeños in my garden next year.  
I did not change anything in this recipe and the jalapeños were perfect.  A bit crunchy,  and the flavor was excellent unlike the store-bought peppers that ate too soft for my liking.   we use them in all different recipes in our kitchen.

I made 8 half pints and canned them in a hot water bath. I made them last year as well and they were a favorite of our family.

Can't get much easier!  I especially like the fact that I can control the heat by the amount of seeds I leave/remove.  Please wear gloves to avoid touching the seeds.  If the juices get into your eyes, it's very painful.

Super simple and much better than store bought. You could even make these milder if you wanted by leaving out some of the seed. I too cut the sugar in half but that is the only change I made.

I highly recommend making these. Once you try the homemade version of pickled jalapeños, you'll think twice before buying store-bought. I added some red cayennes too. I used less sugar seeing that I don't like sweet and wanted all the heat possible. Thank you for the recipe.

Found that 2 TBSP of sugar is too much for me....used 2 tsp.  I also reduced the vinegar to water ratio from 1:1 to 3/4 cup vinegar to 1 cup water.  Nice easy recipe for my abundant crop of jalapenos!

Loved this, so simple and easy and I think tastes way better than store bought...I left all seeds in and added a lil crushed red pepper for added heat but it looks pretty also. :)

This is a great recipe. It made enough for 2 pint jars. We had taco salad and ate all of one jar. The sugar takes a little from “japs” but there is plenty of heat. I won’t be buying these anymore as the cost of theingredients a much less. And of course I enjoy the kitchen time to make it myself.

I think this will be my third season making these.  So good!  They’re so popular with my friends I’ve grown more jalapenos plants this year.  I do use more garlic than called for...3-5 depending on my mood.

Really easy to make. Only changes I made was using less sugar, added about a tsp (maybe less) of dill seeds, added about 1/2 tsp of oregano (saw this on a different recipe), and added a pinch or two of cayenne.
