Beautiful salad! I loved the dressing for this.  Lovely and simple on its own, this salad would also go well with some cheese and/or green onion, as well as any kind of fruit or berry. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my ladie friends last night....they loved it!  I did whisk in 2 Tablespoons of raspberry jelly to the dressing only because I was craving it, not because the salad needed it.  Its a great salad and a gone salad too...they ate it up!  Thanks!

This was a really great salad. I double that for a crowd and it was a  crowd pleaser!   I didn't have vegetable oil so I use the olive oil I had on hand. It was fine.

Something just doesn't come together with this dressing for me. I could try to tweak, but I can't even figure out what I liked.

Lick your plate good. My kids helped me make this; and so we ended up with triple the amount of parsley in place of thyme by mistake. It was still super delicious. This is the salad that I will take to potlucks so I can get compliments. I agree with other reviews that a little cheese would make it extra special. I made it and ate it before reading the reviews and didn't think it was missing anything. Now that I know about the cheese idea, I'll be sure to try it next time.
