When I decided to try this marinade, I kind of knew what the answer was when I asked hubs if he'd like his pork chop marinated too, or if I should leave his alone. Not surprisingly, he told me to leave the marinade off his. But hmmmm, once he was done with his, he ate the rest of mine!  This was really good!  Kind of teriyaki-like, but more subtle than that.  The plain pork chop purist and I enjoyed this very much!

Terrific idea.  Cut the soy sauce drastically, like, by 2/3 (used reduced sodium soy sauce, also) and doubled the brown sugar.  Used fresh squeezed lemon juice, also.  We loved it!!

My husband says he only likes pork chops with shake and bake on them or a tenderloin.  He says otherwise it's just a dry piece of meat.  These came out great though.  Very flavorful and moist.  He ate it up!  The kids didn't however... I should have done theirs plain.  Used ketchup instead of chili sauce.  I would definatly make these again.

These were just okay for me. We thought they were somewhat bland although very juicy. Thanks for sharing. :o)

Super easy, super quick, super good!  This was a huge hit with everyone in the family.  We had purchased a large package of chops and the unmarinated chops were tough and flavorless.  This marinade saved dinner on night 2!  I used fresh garlic rather than powdered and it turned out amazing.

This was a huge hit in my house. Even the kids ate it. I doubled the brown sugar though. More sweet and savory, then spicy!

i JUST started to marinade the chops, but i tasted the marinade....tastes AWESOME!!! maybe a little salty, but i love soy sauce! i added 1 extra tablespoon of lemon juice and squirted a little honey on top of the chops, as i thought it may use a little more sweetness...will edit when chops are on the table!
*EDIT* I think next time I will cut the soy sauce down to 1/2 cup, and add a little more sweetness (with honey) and a little more lemon juice. the amount of hot sauce was right on though. And this tasted so good the next day after sitting in the fridge! YUM

This was SOOOOOOO SALTY. I used the recipe exactly and the chops smelled awesome on the grill. My husband said it tasted like plain pork chops with a ton of salt , and i would agree, except that the marinade took more effort than putting a bunch of salt on top. I even scaled the recipe to 4 and used it on 6 chops. I would not recommend this recipe and I will not make it again.

Best pork chop I have had.  I had the family over for Sunday dinner, amazing that EVERYONE love them. I'm sure you know how difficult it is to please everyone.  Followed the recipe with no changes.  Prepared the chops in the morning and marinated them all day. Then grilled them.  Was a little low on charcoal so I added some small pieces of oak from my wood pile. Great recipe! Thank you!

This was really good.  I generally don't like pork chops, but I really enjoyed these.  I only had time to marinate them for an hour or so but I basted them a little more while they were on the grill.  They were very moist and flavorful.

As I was marinating them, my husband said he preferred his chops breaded. But when he tasted these, he said this was one of the better meals I have ever made. I made them exactly as the recipe called. I think next time I will add more garlic powder or perhaps minced garlic becuase there will definitely be a next time.

Followed the original recipe. Rather disappointed the soy was about all I tasted in the meat. Pretty blah marinade if that's what you like. Sauteed mushrooms with onions and garlic were a nice complimentary taste to banish the soy.

Perfect as written! It's my favorite way to make pork chops. If I don't have the chili sauce, I  substitute half ketchup and half chili powder. Delicious!
