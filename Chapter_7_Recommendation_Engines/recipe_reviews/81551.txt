Some reviewers, apparently, haven't a clue what this recipe is all about.

Please note:  (1) this is a Moroccan SIDE DISH; (2) it is SUPPOSED to be spicy and somewhat sweet; and (3) it is intended to be served with a tagine, or other stew, and should be DRY enough to soak up the juices of the main course.

When used as it is intended, it is a spectacular--and VERY fast and easy--part of a meal featuring, say, a delicious, savory lamb tagine.

It should come as no surprise that it will need some alteration if it is used in another way.  But I think it's unfair to criticize baked potatoes because they aren't prime rib or pound cake.

I find this recipe really, really good, just as it appears here.  I have made it dozens of times as an accompaniment to Middle Eastern food. to rave reviews.

However, if you want bland and soupy, look elsewhere, or make the alterations others suggest as "improvements."

Per others' suggestions, I substituted chicken broth for the vegetable broth, reduced cinnamon to 1 1/4 tsp., and used dried cranberries instead of the dates. Liked the buttery, sweet flavor.  Reduce the 2 cups dry couscous to one 10 oz. box of couscous (measured out to 1 1/2 cups approx.) Even with that reduction, it is a tad dry so you might want to add 1 or 2 T. extra broth.
(The dried fruits absorb some of the liquid, leaving less for the couscous and making it a tad on the dry side.)

Very good!  The recipe calls for 3 teaspoons cinnamon.  However, I do suggest that you start with 1 teaspoon, then add more, to taste.  One teaspoon gives such a subtle taste!

This was a very good/easy recipe, but I did change the recipe substantially.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, I omitted the dates because I didn't have any and used dried cherries in their place.  I was also out of almonds, but used toasted walnuts instead; and reduced the amount of butter by half.  Lastly, I added 2 small chopped green onions and about 1/4 cup of chopped Italian parsley.  The end result was very good and we will most definitely make it again.

DO NOT-I REPEAT-DO NOT PUT THAT MUCH CINNAMON IN!  I put 1 tsp. cinnamon and that was plenty.  This was a pretty good side-dish, though I got no raves from my family.  I think it needs something else savory to balance the sweet.

OK - this DEFINITELY needs at least 1 cup or even 2 cups of additional stock.  I am middle eastern, too, and this is not how couscous is supposed to be - even when served with a liquidy dish, which I did.  Other than that, I loved the flavors and texture (I also added dried figs).  I might even add more fruit next time.  Served with Israeli Moroccan Couscous from this site.

My husband and I enjoyed this very much.  For quick vegetable broth, try Knorrs vegetable cubes - I use them in place of any broth (chicken, beef or vegetable).

This was the perfect recipe for a first time Moroccan food eater!  Not too spicy but with plenty of flavor!  It was sweet enough and not so exotic to feed the kids too!

I really like the idea of this but for my taste buds the amounts are a little off, I use more dried fruit and almonds and add nutmeg, cardamom and a few pinches of cloves.

i used an olive oil and herb bouillon cube for the broth and it turned out great!  i didn't put the almonds in until right before i served it so that they stayed nice and crunchy.  the flavors and textures went well together, and the whole bowl of coucous disappeared accordingly!

This is a great recipe with wonderful texture and flavor.  For a Thanksgiving twist, I create the couscous with equal parts chicken stock and couscous with a bit of finely grated garlic.  I added a mixture of dried fruits (apricots, golden raisins, dried cherries, etc).  I also add toasted pine nuts and scallions or green onions.  The dried fruit, green onion and pine nut mixture is fairly equal...to your taste.  The sweet fruits, savory nuts and green onion flavors meld well.  To help with a bit of dryness, once the couscous is cool enough to handle, I drizzle olive oil in my palms and 'massage' the olive oil throughout the mixture.  With the olive oil added, it reheats well.  If it's still a bit dry, a squeeze of fresh orange juice does wonders.

The flavours are nice, but be sure that you serve it with a runny dish. My accompanying dish turned out drier than I anticipated and the couscous really needs that moisture.  Without it, the dish is very very dry.  With a great Moroccan tagine this would be fabulous.  On it's own, not so much.

I like this dish! I had it accompany some fish. I didn't have dates on hand, but I had figs, so I substituted and it was still great. I like the fact that the sweet just comes from the fruits that are added and the most fattening thing is the butter, which I cut down to 3T and it was still good. Thank you for sharing!

Didn't have any dates so I just used cranberries as someone else mentioned. I like my couscous a little bit sweet (to go with the fruits and nuts) so I added a bit of local honey. It was GREAT! Served with Baked Peach Chicken.

It was a little bit dry, but it wasn't too bad.  I was amazed by how delicious this ended up.  If you want a very moist couscous, though, definitely follow the advice of the others.

Very easy to make and very tasty. Like others have said it needs a little more broth. I added about 3 shakes of cinnamon and it tasted fine.

This was very good!  I used salted butter and left out the cinnamon and almonds.  I didn't have unsalted butter nor almonds.  Also, I served it with a moroccan tagine sauce which I added cinnamon to, so I didn't want it to be cinnamon overkill.  The apricots are really good in this, especially with a sauce and the raisins.  Do not leaved either of these out!

This is a definite 5-star recipe.  I made it as written except for accidentally measuring out too much of the fruits.  The cinnamon level was just perfect.  One suggestion I would make is to make sure you use Korintje cinnamon (I've found it in health food stores as well as online), because it has a much better flavor than cassia cinnamon, which is what most easily available, commercial brand cinnamon is.  We served it with the Lamb Tagine from this site, which was a perfect combination.  My husband  and I both enjoyed this very much.  We will be making it again.  Thanks, Christina, for a great recipe.

VERY good. I'm quite pleased with this, and surprizingly so was the rest of my family. We ate every little bit. I made no changes or substitutions. I served this with Orange Herb Roasted Chicken and Balsamic Glazed Carrots. Not a true moroccan dinner, but it flowed well together. A very welcome change from your average pasta-rice dishes.

This is delicious!  I was a little leary about using so much cinammon so I added it slowly, but I ended up using the amount called for.  I also substituted cranberries for raisins and toasted pumpkin seeds for the almonds since it was for a fall gathering.  In addition, I used coconut oil in place of the butter and that made it really good. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe.  It hits all the marks for me:  delicious, easy, fast, and uses common ingredients.  I've made it with both vegetable and chicken broth and it's good either way.  This is a staple in our house.

This was excellent.  The problem I always find with couscous is that it lacks flavor and is hard to make really flavorful.  But this recipe makes an often boring grain very tasty.  I didn't have any dates on hand so I just increased the quantity of apricots and raisins.  The toasted almonds are key - they add a very nice crunch and aroma to the couscous. Thanks for the recipe!

This is good and quick. I brought it to a potluck at work, and it got good reviews. I like to eat it with plain yogurt - especially greek-style or kefir.

This recipie served as inspiration for me - I substituted craisins(great color) for golden raisins, chix broth for vege broth, and lastly, sugared almonds (1/2 c. sliced almonds, 3 tbs. sugar - put in pan over medium heat, stir constantly until almonds are coated with sugar.  Burns easily.) for slivered almonds.  Also, I added S/P and olive oil at the end.  Turned out great!

This was excellent. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable, cut the cinnamon to 1 tsp. (which was plenty), and omitted the nuts since my kids aren't fans. The result was a delicious and different side dish, great with roasted chicken.

So tasty!! I made this to serve with the Israeli Moroccan couscous recipe (also from this site) instead of serving that one over plain couscous and I'm pretty sure I have a new favourite meal. I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was perfect. 
I'm seeing a lot of reviews saying you need to increase the broth a lot, and I guess you might want to if you're planning to eat this on its own, but as a side to a saucy stew-type dish, it's perfect. I absolutely loved it on its own as well, actually. I made this first and I definitely did some snacking on it while preparing the other dish. Thanks so much!

Very good! I have picky teens and even they gobbled it up! I will definitely make this dish again. I used 3c broth instead of the 2c based on others' suggestion and it came out perfect. I also used chicken broth ... served with chicken tagine ... very complementary!

I made this on Mother's Day as one of the side dishes for dinner and everyone loved it! It was a bit too powerful for my personal tastes and would decrease the fruit and cinnamon just slightly (maybe 1/4c of each dried fruit and 2t cinnamon) - this is probably because I'm not very big on any sweets, so def my personal preference.

I understand that it should be salty but we and the kids loved it with sugar ;-). I used dried figs instead of dates as I did not have any on hand.

This was really simple and delicious.  I left the dates out since I really don't like them.  I agree with others that it is quite sweet.  Not sugary sweet really but could be substituted for a dessert if needed.  I'd make it again.

I took the suggestion of a few and halved the cinnamon, using 1.5 tbsp. This was fine for my tastes. My husband who likes cinnamon less thought it was too much. I also used chicken broth because I didn't have veggie broth and that worked out fine. Recipe is dry and I needed to add some more stock and butter but overall it was delicious but seems to lend itself more for breakfast. And I certainly plan to enjoy it that way tomorrow! I would rate a 5 by the taste but but gave up a point because I needed to doctor the recipe.

This was good- though a little dry and a tad sweeter then I'd like for it to be. I used dried cranberries instead of raisons.

This is an excellent recipe. I was looking for something close to a salad I had from Marks & Spencer's and this is it. I substitute dried cranberries for the dates which gives it a really nice flavour.

I admit I was sceptical at first glance due to the amount of cinnamon called for, but I made no adjustments. my whole family loved the dish (served with lamb tagline). I would highly recommend this side dish to anyone not afraid to go outside their comfort zone.

Not bad. I added cinnamon, cumin, allspice, cardamon, and butternut squash. I also used half couscous/half quinoa, since that's all I had. Tasty, something different.

I made it a bit differently and was happy with how it turned out. I'm not familiar with Moroccan cooking or dishes, so I offer my changes without meaning to disrespect or presume:

For spices I put 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp cardamom, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg (I'd recommend more of each but I made it for  me and my mom and she needs food to be more mild).

Instead of broth I used about 1/2 cup more water than the couscous box asked for, instead of butter I used about 2 tbsp sunflower oil (2 1/2 would've been better though).

I also put in papaya instead of mango, and I put in pine nuts and cashews in addition to almonds.


Cheers!

Really good! A nice side for dinner with some sweetness, but not overpowering. Be careful to use normal veggie broth (not unsalted) or else be prepared to add some salt. I also made the mistake of not preparing the mix-ins ahead of time, so some of the broth burned off, making the cous cous a bit dry. Prepared as directed, this is a winner. Served with chicken asparagus roll ups. 6 svgs = 6-8 individual meals (served as a side to chicken) for our family (2 adults).

I used Chicken Broth instead of Vegetable Broth and substituted Olive Oil in place of the Butter.  I also cut the cinnamon in half.  It was delicious!

I made this dish for an international potluck and we loved it!  I subbed dried apples for the raisins (which I was out of) and the result was still amazing.  Thank you for the recipe!

This is fantastic!  Nutty and sweet but not too much.  Perfect as a compliment to other Moroccan dishes.  Much better than I expected.  Will certainly make again.

Great couscous!  I forgot to add the cinnamon so we just sprinkled how much we wanted on each serving.  A little dry, and maybe needs more salt.  Missing something I can't seem to figure out.  But we loved it and can't wait to try again!

We cut the butter as well but it affected the texture quite a bit--it didn't stay together as well as it would have. Excellent flavor, though!

I made this the other night and the whole family loved it.  I used chicken broth instead of veggie and put in dried apples, raisins, orage cranberries and plain cranberries (that's what we had on hand).  This is a great way to get my 5 year old to eat couscous.  Thank you!

Never even seen couscous before.  Taste was good but dry, dry, dry.  Will eventually try again with mods.

Overall, the flavor was really good.  I used 1/2 c of all of the fruits just to have a little more in the recipe.  I also added a bit of sugar to help bring out the cinnamon flavor.  However, like other reviews have said, it is a bit DRY, so use extra vegetable stock!

I did make some changes to start.  As suggested by other reviewers, I added only three tablespoons of butter.  I used vegan butter, and normally using vegan butter does not change the taste of my dishes drastically.  In this dish, I think I could have used 5 tablespoons.  In the end, I think I actually needed more cinnamon.  My dish ended up a little on the bland side :(  I tried adding some salt to make the flavors pop, but no such luck :(  I had to add a half cup water near the end since it was so dry, so maybe that's what did it in.  Next time I would only use a cup and a half of couscous.

Fantastic way to spice up an otherwise ordinary dish of couscous.  Love all the fruity, chewy, sweet and crunchy textures.  The dish is definitely a winner.

Two suggestions.  For those of you who don't like cinnamon, nutmeg is a great substitute.   Of course try the nutmeg in a small bowl of couscous before adding it to your entire dish! And medium to large size yellow coucous adds a flare.

i did as others mentioned, and put only 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and only 1 1/2 cups couscous.  it was very good!  only 4 stars b/c of the necessary modifications and still a bit too buttery.  next time i will maybe only use 3T of butter.

So easy and yummy.  This makes a lot though, so be sure you're making it for a side dish for at least four people.  I'll make this again for sure.  And maybe even with more fruit next time.
