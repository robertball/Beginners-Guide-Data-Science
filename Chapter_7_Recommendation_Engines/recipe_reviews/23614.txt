I followed the recipe exactly except instead of pepperoni, I used small meatballs sliced.  It was delicious.  I had fun making it and eating it.  It did not take that long and the husband enjoyed it.  Bringing it for lunch this week.

I am telling you that this was fantastic.  I didn't have vermicelli pasta but used rotini, since that is also my grandson's favorite pasta.  Everything else was done according to directions.  I did put some pepperonis on the top for the pizza effect.  As I was making the recipe, my neighbor came in, saw it and wanted the recipe.   My grandson loved it!  As my husband and myself had seconds.  This is a keeper along with my other Allrecipes recipes.

Very tasty.  For added nutrition, I used whole grain spaghetti and fresh garlic, no added salt.

Was a good recipe, had to alter some of the stuff like ground beef because I had no pepperoni, and my wonderful timer decided not to go off so I overcooked it a little bit, but all in all I would recommend it and will try it again and hopefully be more successful.

We thought this was great! We added a bit more cheese, added some Pepperjack which added a bit more spice. I left the temp at 400 for the final 10 minutes which I think was a good idea. It made the topping a little more crusty too.

It was okay.  The pasta had an interesting texture to it.  I usually judge the success of a dish to whether my husband will go for seconds.  He didn't have seconds and he didn't take the leftovers to work.  They ended up in the garbage.

Good stuff. I used a lot more cheese - mozz, Parm and extra-sharp Cheddar. The pepperoni made it a little bit greasy, but it was good otherwise. Thanks!

Really good - I will make it again.  I think I will use 1/2 package of pasta next time - it didn't turn out as crust-like as I would have liked.  I will also try leaving it at 400 for the last ten minutes so the pepperoni get a little crispier.

I made this as a side dish for my family.  I thought it was great but my kids did not.

Seemed like one pound of pasta was a bit much so I took a little out.

Overall, I think it was grand.

I really love this type of family-friendly pasta dish. (The kids like it because it doesn't have ricotta or cottage cheese in it.) I added a half pound of cooked ground turkey to the sauce so it would have a bit more protein. I also put the pepperoni on top because it looks more interesting.

I didn't have vermicelli or mozzarella, so I used spaghetti and cheddar cheese. I also used fresh parsley and garlic and it made it taste so healthy. I put the pepperoni on sparingly and the whole dish was wonderful!

I omitted the milk and egg step because of time. I was cooking it for a church supper for 60 people. But it turned out great. Everyone was very curious, and it was a big hit!

It was OK. My husband like it enough to go for thirds.  I thought it was too dry - I would use more sauce and too much pepperoni. I would add other pizza type things like black olives and green peppers.  But that would be a different dish wouldn't it?

Way too cheesy, and need more pepperoni. Besides from that, it's a okay dish.

I used about 3/4 package of vermicelli.  Instead of garlic salt, I used 1/2 tbsp Lawrys Seasoning Salt and some garlic powder.  I also used a six cheese blend instead of Mozzarella. For my sauce, I used turkey sausage mixed with a jar of spaghetti sauce and added basil, oregano and garlic.  I topped it with shredded cheddar.  Awesome!

This is a definite keeper!  I used up some extra pasta from my pantry (rotini and wagon wheels) instead of the vermecelli.  My pickey 5 year old ate his entire plate which is always a phenomenom.

I used rotini noodles, added some peppers, onions, olives, the works and it was fantastic.  Simple and uses a ton of leftovers from the fridge!
