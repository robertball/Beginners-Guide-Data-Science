This recipe is so yummy! Everyone loved it!

However, I followed the recipe and once it was in the bowl I drizzled it with olive oil.  It definately would have been too dry to eat without it.  Served it with tostitos.... YUMMY... it was all gone!

Have been making this for years, except I melt the butter in frying pan and cook onions in it until completely browned. Also, make sure you use the clam juice, this should not be dry. Serve with mini rye or pumpernickel loaf.

This recipe was soooooo dry. I had made it for a Big New Years Eve party I was having. Thank god I saved a bunch of the clam juice because, I had to add a lot of it to moisten it up.

Excellent!  I kept the juice from the clams and used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and it was absolutely delicious!  Everyone loved it!

Good dip but I think next time I would serve it with celery sticks and carrots. Too many carbs when you serve it with crackers.

I made this on New Year's Eve and everyone loved it, even people who don't like clams and those who are allergic to them wanted to eat it!  I used Italian style bread crumbs instead of regular ones.

Very, very rich, with so much butter. This is quite different that cream based dips and particularly if you are looking for an unusual dip, this one is a good choice. It reheats pretty well. I used the new Triscuit Rosemary and Olive Oil crackers for dipping, which was an awesome choice. I will experiment with leaving the clam sauce in the mixture, since the dip has a tendency to dry out after sitting for awhile.

I made this dip for a family gathering, anf everybody from my grandparents to my little cousins loved it. I had to give the recipie to everybody! I used swiss instead of cheddar and it worked great.  The only thing I didnt love about it was how oily it came out, but it ended up soaking up anyways. I have a feeling this dip will show up at many family parties this holiday season!!!

I thought this was just okay. I followed the recipe pretty much as written. I assumed the clams weren't supposed to be drained (I think a few other reviewers may have mistakenly decided to do so), the lemon juice was from a bottle instead of fresh-squeezed, and the dish I used was a 9" round Pyrex dish. All I had on hand, cracker-wise, was saltines, and I'm sure there were better options. But the recipe itself was a bit of an odd combination, to my taste, and I probably won't be making this again, sorry.

This "dip" is much too dry to dip into.  It's the consistency of stuffing.  It tasted just okay - wouldn't make it again.

I made this for my husband's poker game - it got excellent reviews! This dip goes excellent with Nabisco's Triscuits - and is really good with any hard cracker.....I myself thought it was absolutely delicious!!  This is a keeper and will be made again, and again and again!!  Thanks for a super easy and delicious appetizer!!

I used panko crumbs, added some Italian seasoning, added a bit of the clam juice (I saved all of it...it has great flavor) & I used a monterey jack/cheddar blend of cheese. We tried the dip w/ assrted crackers (club crackers were the best) & celery slices. While tasty, I don't think this recipe is very well-suited for a dip w/ crackers. It's too heavy & dense (despite adding extra moisture w/ the clam juice). I think it would be better suited as a stuffing for mushrooms or  spread on toasted french bread slices. Thansk for the recipe,  Connie Malagrino!

This dip was ok.  I liked it but my husband and guests didn't care a whole lot for it.  It was strong clammy tasting.  It is not like a typical dip (with cream cheese or sour cream) if that is what you are expecting when making this recipe.

My son thought to try something different, so he bought 2 cans of minced clams. After opening one can, he gave me the other; he prefers fresh. I saw this recipe--quick and easy--so I gave it a try. I used seasoned bread crust in place of salt and pepper. Loved it! For minced clam lovers, this is a must-try.

I really didn't like the taste and consistency when warm; it was better in both respects when cold.
