I gave this 4 stars because I had to make some adjustments to make it taste as good as it did. I sauted an onion with cumin and chili powder and real garlic. Then I added a can of diced tomatoes and a can of beans. I simmered for 10 minutes then added mostly cooked brown rice and simmered another 15 minutes. I served it with real cheddar cheese and sour cream on whole wheat tortillas. It was delicious but I don't believe it would have been as good (at least to me and my family) with white rice and processed cheese.

The good things about this dish are that it is cheap, quick, and relatively healthy. The bad thing is pretty much just that I thought that the ratio of beans to rice to tomatoes is off. I was expecting it to be way more beans. I prepared this with microwave brown rice which is healthier than white rice, whole wheat tortillas and shredded cheddar instead of the velveeta. I will do this again, but next time I think I might use half the amount of tomatoes. On a good note I thought it was seasoned very well.

This recipe was a huge hit, even our three year old loved it!  I did make some adjustments.  I sauted some onion in a bit of oil, used fresh garlic instead of powder, added an extra can of beans and adjusted the spices a bit for the extra beans.  Like a previous reviewer, I thought the beans to rice ratio was a bit off.  Two cans of beans to one can of tomatoes is perfect for my family.  I was really suprised my family of carnivores didn't even miss the meat!
UPDATE:  DH regularly requests this for dinner.  I think it may be his new favorite!

My husband and I thought this recipe was great. I like to play around with spices, so I added some chili powder, cayenne pepper and lemon pepper. Together with a salad this made a quick and healthy dinner.

Great basic and easy recipe when you want something different quick.  I added lemon powder (though you can, of course, use lime or lemon juice) and dried cilantro to the rice  and did not mix it with the beans.  I layered the rice and then the beans and then the cheese (used shredded sharp cheddar) on the tortilla.  Nice and tasty.  Oh, make sure you use a slotted spoon with the bean mixture since there is quite a bit of juice that comes out of the tomatoes even if you pre-drain before cooking it.  This way the juices will not leak out of the tortilla or make it too soggy.  Add some sour cream too!

I made several changes to this including using a Spanish rice mix instead of white rice, shredded cheddar instead of Velveeta, and fresh garlic.

I only gave it four stars because I varied the recipe to suit my family's needs. My first step was to brown ground beef and add taco seasoning as directed on package, then added the beans, etc. I changed the velveeta to shredded cheese and added shredded lettuce and tomatoes to the burritos. (I have to sneak in veggies to any dish I make for my kids). I substituted fat free sour cream for the regular sour cream and whole wheat tortillas for the plain tortillas. I gave it 4 stars because it is a good "starter" recipe.

This recipe was alright. I think the amount of beans and tomatos needs to be adjusted a little bit, there didn't seem to be enough beans. The seasoning was good. I used white rice and instead of processed cheese I used shredded cheddar. My roommate used the leftovers the next day to make nachos.

We love this recipe and make it 2-3 times per month!  I made a few minor changes.  Instead of Velveeta, I used mexican blend shredded cheese.  Also, once the burritos were assembled, I put them in a 9x13 pan, sprinkled some more cheese on top, covered with foil and baked in a 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes, then removed the foil and baked an additional 10 minutes.  I have also added 1/2 cup of pureed butternut squash when heating beans/tomatoes/spices.  This was an easy way to add additional veggies without even noticing it was in there!

This recipe needed a fair amount of tweaking to be really good.  Like another reviewer, I started by sauteing  chopped onion in oil.  After a few minutes I added chopped green pepper and a clove of fresh garlic, chopped finely or minecd.  I then added a little minced jalapeno pepper, as well as a small can of mild green chilies.  Then I added cumin, oregano, salt & pepper and chilie pepper, according to your heat preference.  To that I added 1 can diced tomatoes and  2 cans of beans (one black and one refried).  Lastly, I stirred in some grated chedder cheese and a little bit of cream cheese.  I added the bean mixture to the middle of the tortilla, put some rice on top of that, then put a little sour cream on top.  It was very good this way.

Fast and very simple. I added some saut√©ed onions, cut the cumin in half, and used a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies. I filled the burritos, folded them, and sprayed them with cooking spray before putting in the oven. 12 minutes at 400F gave them a crispy crust.

I had to change this based on what I had. I used refried beans and less sour cream and also shredded cheddar instead of Velveeta. Nornally I wouldnt use a recipe for stuff like this but I thought Id try something new and I did. Everyone liked this alot. I was impressed how fast it came together. Ill make this again.

As the recipe stands, it looked a little bland and unhealthy so I added a fresh garlic clove, 1/4 cup red pepper, 1/4 cup red onion (all chopped finely) and sauteed for about 7 minutes in olive oil. I then added 2 tbs of cumin and chilli powder (each) with a dash of taco seasoning, cooked for about 10 minutes with the beans. Mashed several times then added the rice for another 5 minutes or so. Turned out delicious! The original recipe is great to start out with, especially for something quicker and easier.

We really liked these. I did change it a little bit though. I added an extra can of beans, green chilies, and instead of the seasonings I just used Taco Seasoning 1 (AR).  Added extra cheese too. Served with lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, olives and chipotle sauce. Yum! Thanks for the recipe.

This was a great recipe but I changed a few things to fit the supplies I had in my house. I used refried beans instead in black beans, fresh cheddar cheese instead of processed, chili pepper, and I added a can of peas. It was a great recipe, my husband enjoyed it.

Thanks for the idea.  I wanted to spice up the black beans for burritos and this was perfect.  I substituted green chiles for the tomatoes and kept the rice separate.

These were pretty good, we had company over so we made these and Traditional Beef Burritos.  Hubby adored these, and I thought they were tasty, I did cook my rice in some homemade chicken stock that I needed to use up and after adding the rice, I decided it did need another can of black beans as per other reviewers, and I did not have any Velveta so I used shredded cheddar instead.  Thanks for the recipe.

great recipe!! i used a 19oz 5 bean mix. just eating one now and it's wonderful. I didn't mix the rice and beans, just layered them- will make according to recipe next time (all around flavor). I've frozen the rest, which will make great (and affordable) student lunches. Thanks for submitting.

This was so quick and easy. I added a little can of green chiles and some cayenne pepper for a little kick. It was so good. Also, I used the 90 second Uncle Ben's rice. So, this was one of the quickest meals I have ever made!

It was a very good base recipe.  I used my rice cooker to make this.  Added 2 cups of water, 1 cup of uncooked long grain rice, a 14.5 oz can of Basil, Garlic, and Oregano Diced tomatos juice and all, and I also added 2 Tbsp of Taco seasoning and the rest of the ingredients to rice cooker and shut the lid and set it.  It was ready in under 20 minutes:)  even my picky eater ate a whole burrito!!

This was a great start to a quick week night meal! I made a few changes, just based on personal preferences. First I sauteed some red onion and minced garlic, then I added the beans and a drained can of diced tomatoes with green chiles. Mixed everything up with the cumin, splashed in some lime juice, a couple of shakes of dried cilantro and two cups of saffron rice. Tucked the mix into tortillas with shredded cheddar jack cheese and topped with sour cream. Delicious!!!

Very tasty!  I made this recipe without the cheese and sour cream to make it healthier, and it was still very flavorful.  It works well with black and pinto beans.

Even though I substituted Ro-Tel-style  tomatoes with green chiles for 2/3 of the tomatoes, this was a little bland. It was missing something, but I can't put my finger on what. I did also use fresh garlic and shredded Colby-Jack cheese. If I make this again, I plan to use a more traditional taco seasoning and possibly cook the beans with the seasoning for a while before adding in the tomatoes.

This was a quick and easy recipe. I omitted the tomatoes(my family does not eat tomatoes) and added some ground turkey. I agree with the other reviews...I reduced the rice to bean ratio. This is a keeper for our house.

What a super fast and healthy meal!  I'm sure it's not one my family would specifically request, but some days you need recipes like this just so you can get a decent meal on the table in a short period of time.  I sauteed some onion and garlic in EVOO, then added all the other ingredients.  I only recommend a 1/2 can of tomatoes, and 1 cup of cooked brown rice for the one can of beans.  I will use this recipe again.

I made this tonight because I wanted an easy meal that I could make from things I already had in the kitchen.  I made the same kinds of changes as others suggested - I sauteed  an onion with fresh garlic and the cumin and I added about a teaspoon of Adobo seasoning as well.  I also added a handful of frozen corn while it was simmering near the end.  We wrapped it up in homemade tortillas with cheddar and they were delicious.  I'll make this again.

Very yummy and super easy to make!! I think the garlic powder and cumin helped to make the meal more flavorful. A great meatless meal. Will definitely have again. I did a couple changes: No Velveeta (used a bit of shredded colby jack instead) or Sour Cream. Husband thinks it could have used more tomatoes, or perhaps salsa instead.

Even my carnivorous husband loved it. I followed the other reviews and used two cans of beans, of different varieties. Although I thought it was really good to have two types of beans (black and chickpeas) there was definitely not enough tomatoes for my taste. Stick to the original-- or better yet, double the recipe and add a different kind of beans. I also used grated cheddar cheese, rather than processed.

Replaced the Velveeta with real cheese and used mild salsa instead of the canned tomatoes. Made it a bit better. Good thing about this was you can make up all of the burritos and freeze them for a quick lunch later on in the week.

My friend and I made this recipe one day when we were starving and looking for something cheap to make.  I didn't think it was gonna be as good as it was because it doesn't have any meat in this recipe but it actually turned out very tasty!  The only changes we made were we used shredded cheddar cheese instead of Velveeta and we used brown rice to make it a little healthier.  I would definitely make this again!  It was quick, easy & cheap!
