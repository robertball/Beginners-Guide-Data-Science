Easy to make! The pecans are a great addition and the texture is just what I was looking for.

I omitted the nuts and replaced with oats since my guys don't like nuts in desserts. I also added extra cinnamon and a dash of ginger, cloves, nutmeg and allspice.  Very easy dessert and quite tasty! I'll make it again.

My daughter gave me this recipe to take to our extended family Christmas dinner. It was a hit! Loved the taste and texture, it's better than pie!

This is the third time I make this and every time it comes out delicious. I substituted walnuts for the pecans and I did not have the allspice so I omitted that from the recipe. I also doubled the crumb mixture so I had more of a crust on the bottom and was able to sprinkle more topping on top. Excellent!

Was  looking for this delicious recipe, as it was a family staple at thanksgiving growing up.   Don't come on here and give this a one-star review after omitting the nuts lol that's half the taste of this bar.

I've been making this for Thanksgiving for the past couple of years and my family and my boyfriends family love it. I actually put this into a graham cracker pie crust. It really is delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly but left out the pecans, which I can't imagine would make a difference. But this turned out very weird, not like pumpkin cheesecake but not like pumpkin cake either--a very weird mishmash that neither my husband nor I found palatable.

The flavor was good but the bars didn't set very well and I found the texture of the bars to be lumpy and I missed the creaminess of a cheesecake. If I make it again, I wouldn't do the crumble on top. I did follow the recipe exactly so I'm a little puzzled.
