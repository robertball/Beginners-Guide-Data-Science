5 stars for a fabulous idea! I did not make the recipe for the cupcakes because I wanted yellow cupcakes. So I made the Golden Rum Cake recipe on this site. The kisses were the caramel filled ones. I frosted with a creamy chocolate buttercream, an wow! What a treat! A couple of recommendations. Fill the paper liners no more than a little over half full, since when the kisses displace some of the batter, you don't want an overflow mess. Secondly, I didn't push them into the batter, but halfway through baking, gave them just a hint of a push downward. The cake rose up to cover them completely, with just a hint of a dimple at the top of the kiss. And the kiss remained fully suspended midway through the middle of the cupcake, which makes for the perfect presentation. I baked them for only 18 minutes, which was perfect. Only the barest hint of an indentation should remain when you touch them lightly. This way, they won't be dry. A+ idea - thank you!

These are very good! The Hershey's Kiss inside is a really cute surprise.  If you didn't have the time to make this batter, you could make cupcakes from the box and put kisses in them..it would be just as good.

Soooo great!~ I used golden cake mix with milk chocolate frosting (all store bought; I was on a time crunch). I just dropped the kisses in and gave them a little tap. Don't worry about a large part of the top of the kiss poking out; the cupcake will cover is while baking. These were a hit. What a great idea!!!

I have to give this 5 stars because I didn't actually use the recipe, but the concept. I was totally out of cocoa and had no buttermilk, so I used an 18.25 oz. Devil's Food Cake Mix (Wal-Mart brand actually). I simply followed the directions on the box to make the cupcakes, but add the Hershey's Kisses to each cake. These turned out great and couldn't be simpler. Oh, and one thing I added was some chocolate icing (store-bought). I am usually not too much of a fan of the store-bough icing, but I have found that if you beat the icing with an electric beater, it tastes much better and is easier to work with.

This is genius!!  The four year olds thought these were the coolest cupcakes ever!  Much Like CookinginFL, I used a box mix (Pillsbury Valentine's Funfetti).  The only thing I will say is:  DON'T PUSH DOWN THE KISS!! Just drop it in the batter, and cover lightly with a spoon.  Also, if you do happen to push the kisses down - use paper liners. (I lost a couple kisses, even though the pans were greased well - but I just crammed 'em back into the "holes" and used those cakes as the "Samples" for the kids).

Time is never on my side w/ 3 kids 5yrs and under so I used the Moist Fudge Cake box mix and pre-made Milk Chocolate Icing.  I substituted mini Reeses Peanut Buttercups in place of the Hershey Kisses.  When they came out of the oven I popped a few tablespoons of peanut butter in the microwave for about 30 seconds,stirring 1/2 way through, and used that as a crumb coat icing.  The heat of the cupcakes just removed from the oven helped melt the peanut butter more.  Then I popped them in the frig to cool off and finished w/ the Milk Chocolate icing over the Peanut Bitter crumb coat.  YUM!

4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I didn't have any kisses so I omitted them.  I give it 5 stars otherwise.  Great chocolaty flavor, they came out light and fluffy with a great texture.  This is one of the better homemade cake recipes I've found! It makes a ton of batter, I had 18 large cupcakes, 24 minis and 4 star shaped (which are bigger than the large cupcakes)!  I will use this as my go to chocolate cake recipe!

I know everyone loved this recipe, but I thought they were terrible! The cupcake was awful. It tasted like flour and had no taste! I couldn't taste the chocolate at all! The convept is a good one, and I will just run to the store and use this idea with a boxed mix like many of you recomended.

These cupcakes were pretty good, but I was expecting them to be better because everyone raved about them. They were a bit dry, and the kisses sunk to the bottom in mine.

All in all, they are good and I enjoy eating them, but I honestly don't think I'll make them again because they're not extraordinary. I prefer cupcakes made from a box.

These are great, but a little dense.  I tried to add a little milk to it the next time and it lightened the texture up a bit.  Very excellent flavor either way.  Loved the kiss in the middle, tasty!

This idea works with store bought cake mix or even brownie batter.  I turn the kiss upside down when I put it in the batter. (point towards the bottom of the pan)

I made these for valentine's day for my kids and others.  They were good and I didn't have any problems with the kisses sinking to the bottom.  I did toss them in a little flour before I pushed them in which may have helped.  For me, the batter was VERY thick.  Overall, a good cupcake.  I got 27 out of the recipe.  I would scale it to 24 next time for convenience.

Not bad but also not moist enough or chocolatey enough. I'll be looking for a new recipe.

Very good and not too difficult to make. I found them to be a bit dry but that is probably fault on my own part. Definitly will make them again! Everyone loves them.
