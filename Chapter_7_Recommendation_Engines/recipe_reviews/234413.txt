These were great! Made as written and left out the optional five-spice powder. I really thought the oyster sauce was going to overpower but it didn't. I made 2 different Asian style wings from this site last night and these were the bigger hit. I will definitely make them again and I think it would be fun to do it during Halloween as mentioned.

Served this to a group of 28 Ultimate Frisbee players, they loved it.  I let it marinade all day rather than 30 minutes

Delicious tender wings!!  Everyone loved them and will make again soon!! We used Hoisin Sauce instead of Oyster Sauce because we had that on hand, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

Wanted something other than hot wings to take to a party. Made as the recipe states. I should have used a larger pan to bake in.  Too crowded to let the moisture evaporate during baking. At the end I placed the wing on the serving dish, then thickened the sauce with cornstarch slurry. My husband and I were kinda meh about them, but  I received rave reviews from those at the party.  Asked for the recipe by many.

I will definitely make this again.  It was a hit at our fireworks party!  I made it with drumsticks in place of the wings since they were on sale.    I adjusted the recipe slightly to accommodate the larger poultry pieces.

My family liked it although I thought it was a little salty and not sweet at all.
