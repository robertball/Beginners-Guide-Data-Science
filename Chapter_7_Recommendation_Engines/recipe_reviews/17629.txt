This is a great recipe for pavlova. Some of the other recipes tell you to add water & cornstarch which are not needed for a true pavlova. You can also use white vinegar instead of malt. The reason the previous reviewers had trouble is because the 150 degree oven temperature is in CELCIUS. You need to convert to Fahrenheit if you live in the US.

I think the author has included the wrong baking temperature.  The recipe states that it should be heated at 150 degrees F (65 degrees C).  After baking the pavlova for over 2 hours at this temperature, it was still not cooked.  Similar recipes call for an oven temperature of between 300 and 350 degrees F.  This recipe was a total waste of my time.

The meringue did not set up in the 150 degree oven.  I think the cool temperature and length of time caused the whites to liquify while in the oven.  My recipe calls for a 300 degree F. oven for 45 minutes.

Very good! I did adjust the temp. to 300 degrees F, and I only cooked it for 50 mins and then turned the heat off and let it sit in the oven until cool. It tasted delicious- even with the malt vinegar! I would recommend this to anyone. However, my only problem with this was that the pavlova stuck to the parchment paper and it crumbled while trying to pull it off. Still, delicious, and when it's covered in whip cream and fruit no one knows it's broken :)

This was my very first attempt at making pavlova.  Due to the confusion mentioned in the reviews, I compared this recipe to others and decided to bake mine at 300 degrees for an hour.  Then turned the oven off and let them sit in the oven for another three hours.     Even though I made smaller, individual pavlovas by tracing a custard dish, mine still weren’t totally done in the very middle, where they were hard and chewy.  I dusted my parchment paper with cornstarch as mentioned in another recipe and I didn’t have any sticking issues. I would have preferred these to be whiter in color, but I think the malt vinegar and perhaps the vanilla made them more beige than white.  The taste was very good, however.
