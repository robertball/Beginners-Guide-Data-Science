I had a very weird experience with this chocolate bread, and I am wondering if this has happened to anyone else.  When done, I cut a slice of the bread and the top 1/3 was chocolate colored (like a brownie) and the bottom 2/3 was GREEN.  It was the exact tone of green as a Florist's styrofoam block that they stick flowers into.  Needless to say, it was not appealing.  Also, the texture of the top was cakelike, but the bottom was overly moist (almost mushy).  Maybe I didn't bake it long enough.  I am thinking that it was from the coloring in the Chocolate Pudding I used.  I threw it away as it was too scary looking to eat. I did try a taste and it seemed okay.  Curious to see if this has happened to anyone else?

I made this as muffins with chocolate chips, and they were fantastic!  One bag of chocolate chips, an extra tablespoon of cocoa powder, subsituted applesauce for oil, and baked for about 25 minutes.  Great!

I make A LOT of Amish Friendship Bread around the holidays, so I was excited to try this variation. After reading others reviews, I made these modifications. First of all I don't use Amish Friendship Starter...I am way too lazy for that. Instead I just use 1/3 C. of milk, 1/3 C of flour and a 1/3 C. sugar mixed well. That is my substitute for the starter mix. I also added 1 T. of cocoa, 1 C. semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1 bag of dried cherries (approx. 1 1/4 C.) and I used almond extract instead of vanilla extract. The bread turned out great, we call it Cherry Chocolate Bread. YUMMY!

I baked and I baked and I baked this bread, it wouldn't get done in the middle.  By the time it was done the outside was so hard.  We were able to salvage the bread and eat the middle out of each slice, it is very good.  I used devils food chocolate pudding and added some chocolate chips...yummy! I just wish we could eat the whole piece and not just the middle.  anyone else have this problem?

I received a starter dough for "Hemin" Bread, which is exactly like Amish Friendship Bread starter dough. My Qualitycook friend Mandy had made it last year and she wasn't impressed with the taste. With that, I decided to look for something to doctor it up. I was a little confused about the pudding amount, so I used two 1.4 ounce packages which made it nice and chocolatey. I also threw in a goodly amount of chocolate chips and topped it with powdered sugar. Oh and I only used one loaf pan and it was perfectly done in 50 minutes. For those who've never tried this before, this is more like cake than bread. Anyway Kathy, it's delicious and I was very happy with the results. Thank you!

I am a chocolate fanatic but was not overly thrilled with this recipe.It's not bad at all but not as chocolatey as I envisioned.Might try again and add chocolate chips.

This is a delicious, moist cakelike bread.  I think it would be good sliced and topped with cherry pie filling and a dollop of whipped cream to make it a company dessert!  Or a white chocolate sauce and a fresh strawberry on top!

These make wonderful muffins, bake for only 30 minutes, though.  Add mini chocolate bits for extra flavor.

This is yummy, yummy, yummy!  I also use pistachio pudding in place of chocolate and almond extract in place of the vanilla.  

This is fun and easy.  I make my bread into four mini loves and give this as a gift with a copy of the recipe, starter and one of the mini loaves in a pretty hand stamped bag.  My friends have all loved it!  I am going to give one to each of my boyâ€™s teachers as teacher gifts!

This is really good.  I only gave it 4 stars because I modified it.  First,I mixed 1/3 cup cocoa powder and 1 tsp cinnamon with the dry ingredients.  Next, I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce instead of a whole cup of oil.  Last, I folded in a 12 ounce bag of semi sweet chocolate chips.  I made one loaf and 12 muffins.  The muffins baked for 20 mins and the loaf baked for 60 mins.  They both came out perfect!  I can't wait to try other variations on the Amish Friendship starter!

I baked my cake in a bundt pan at 350 degrees for 1 hr and 15 minutes.  The only variation I made was to put a can of pecan coconut frosting in the bottom of the pan before I added the batter.  This is absolutely delicious!! Just like a German Chocolate Cake.  The frosting coated the whole top of the cake.

This bread was a nice change of pace from the cinnamon Friendship Bread, especially if you have been baking the same kind every 10 days.  My husband liked it - he said it tasted like chocolate pudding.  I don't think I loved it, but I definitely liked it enough to eat it and make it every few Starter cycles.

This turned out great!! I used sugar free instant choc pudding and the "quick Amish bread starter" given by another reviewer. I also added a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. The only thing that gave me trouble was this took FOREVER to bake all the way through. I swear by the time I was done I had baked it nearly 75 minutes!  At 60 minutes it was still completely undone in the middle. I'm not sure if increasing the oven temp from the get go would help with that. Although even with all that baking, the bread was still soft and cake like and SO delicious. Definitely a keeper!!!

Yeah so the bottom half of my 2 loaves turned a greenish color too.  I checked the ingredients of the pudding box and it contains red, blue, and yellow dyes.  With the heat of baking, the dyes must have settled to the bottom and made green.  I tasted it and my roommates and I love it!  regardless of color.  nothing is wrong with the bread, it is just food coloring.  I also added 2 mushed bananas to one of the loaves and it came out even better tasting :)

This is exactly what I was looking for!  And to those who said it turned out dry--you cannot eliminate the oil in a sourdough recipe or it will be extremely dry.  You can replace it with applesauce, though.  I've tried cutting back the oil and it was terrible.  I used almost all applesauce with only about a tablespoon or 2 of oil.  I also had only one small box of chocolate pudding, so I added about 1/2 cup of cocoa.  I did not increase the sugar since I used sweetened applesauce in place of the oil.  I also added about a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I made it into 22 muffins and followed another reviewer's guidelines and baked 20 minutes at 350.  They turned out fabulous!

Yummy!  It is a nice, new recipe to use with my Friendship Bread starter.  I've passed this along to my friends who are tired of the same bread receipe for the starter.  I didn't have the Chocolate Instant pudding on hand so I substituted a small box of White Chocolate Instant pudding, a box of Vanilla Instant pudding and a T. of cocoa powder and it tasted great.

I made this bread and my family loved it. Only thing i did different is I used 2 boxes of pudding and added one bag of chocolate chips. It was a lot like a brownie just a tad lighter.

This was a very good recipe.  I made some modifications, mainly to attempt to cut back on some of the fat content.  I used half applesauce and half vegetable oil, and I used Splenda baking mix instead of pure sugar (the starter itself has enough sugar in it.)  I also used half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour.  I added 3 T of cocoa powder to the dry ingredients, and folded in chocolate chips at the end.  The batter was very thick and at first I thought I did something wrong.  But the end product tasted great.  I made muffins, which I baked for 20 minutes, and a loaf, which took at least an hour.  I may try a different pan next time, as it was hard to get the center of the loaf to cook.  I took the bread over to a friend's house for a gathering this weekend, and the bread was gone within the hour.

This made less than what I was expecting. Did anyone else experience this? It tasted great, altough it might could've used more chocolate somewhere (coming from a chocolate fan) It was a little drier than I expected,but this was probably because I over baked it a little. Thanks for the recipe! :)

I made mini muffins, cupcakes and a small loaf from this one recipe.  I added dark chocolate chips to the mix and sprinkled on the top of each.  I also added about 2 - 3 Tbs of cocoa in addition to two small boxes of chocolate pudding mix. Even after all of this the baked goods came out with the taste of the original Amish Friendship Bread.  Bleh.   I like the Friendship Bread but it refused to be taken over by the flavor of chocolate.  I had opted to try this recipe in hopes of finding a yummy keeper to share with the original starter recipe...  I guess if I'm wanting chocolate I'll go for brownies or chocolate bread instead. BTW, you do not need to bake this in a non-metal pan because it doesn't alter anything at this point.

This was absolutely perfect! I added chocolate chunks and it was so moist and rich that everyone who tasted it asked for a bag of friendship bread and the recipe. I will definately make this again.

To the person who got green bread. I think your chocolate pudding was old and it probably didn't cook long enough.

I used half applesauce and half oil instead of all oil. I split the batter in half. Then in one batter I added Andes Candy mint chocolate bars crushed up about 1/2 cup of the candy. If you can find andes candy mint chips that works well also. In the other batter I added 2 tblsps. of chunky peanut butter and 1/2 cup of Reeses peanut butter chips. The breads came out wonderful and both tasted great!

came out like a think, dense, fudgy brownie  crossed with a moist gourmet chocolate cake without frosting. i made it in a bundt pan, and used Jell-O Brand Chocolate Fudge pudding mix. also used applesauce instead of oil, and subbed half the flour with whole-wheat flour. i also added finely chopped zucchini - you cant even see it in there AT ALL! nobody knew i put wheat, applesauce, or zucchini in it - they thought it was the BEST chocolate cake they have ever tasted! oh, i also sprinkled chopped walnuts on top of the mix once i put it in the bundt pan and pressed them down some, so when it came out there were nuts on the bottom of the cake. i also left out the vanilla on accident - whoops! still the best ever - i will make this again and again

This was pretty good. Added mini chocolate chips. Half the oil can easily be replaced with applesauce to cut calories and fat. Freezes well, too.

Great recipe!  I made this in a bundt pan as other reviewers have mentioned.  It was fantastic, almost like a cake!  I didn't have enough vegetable oil, so I used 3/4 c vegetable and 1/4 c extra virgin olive oil.  It was very moist and dense.  I also just used 1 large box of chocolate fudge pudding instead of 2 smaller ones.  I will definitely be making this again.

This is one of my favorite things to make! My children also LOVE to help, which can be a bit stressful. I have successfully made this recipe in the worlds most finicky oven. If your bread didn't turn out, check the ingredients list and give it one more try.
I have had it turn green, just once. The only difference was using shortening and flour to grease the pan. All the other times I used cooking spray with flour. 
I'm about ready to make some as my birthday cake. I bake it in the 9" rounds, fill it with dark chocolate ganache, ice it with chocolate silk frosting, and give it a drizzle with the rest of the ganache. It will be my birthday cake from now on.

Tried this recipe for the first time and will be making these again! The only think I changed was I made muffins instead of bread. The muffins were moist, and baked  really nice. The recipe makes 2dozen muffins and baked for 20min.

I followed some other reviewers' comments and made these into muffins.  I added 1 Tbsp of unsweetened cocoa, stirred in mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and also sprinkled some on top before baking.  Instead of 1 cup oil, I used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil.  (I used cinnamon applesauce as it was what I had on hand and it tasted just fine!)  They turned out very moist and chocolaty!  Oh..and I used 3.9 oz package of instant pudding mix.  I could not find a 5.9 oz and thought maybe it's a typo?

Yum!!!  This was very tasty.  I used half white whole wheat flour and half all purpose flour and tossed in about a tblsp of flaxseed meal.  I did not have chocolate pudding, only vanilla so I added in 1/3 cup of cocoa.  I also only had 3/4 of a bag of chocolate chips so I put that in as well.  I made one loaf and 12 muffins...the muffins I baked for about 20 min. and they came out perfectly!  I will definitely make this again :)

I have made this several times now.  I don't think that it is quite chocolatey enough.  This last time I added 2 T. of cocoa, a cup of chocolate chips, and 3/4 cup of coconut, and used 1/2 oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  I then sprayed my pan with cooking spray and sprinkled more coconut on the bottom of the pan.  This prevented it from sticking.  It turned out very good.

Love this recipe!  It's a cross between chocolate cake, brownies, and sour dough bread.  I added a handful of chocolate chips (milk chocolate morsels) to mine like I do for my brownies.  I also made 3 large loaves with it...two are just too big.  I made a second batch and made 5 mini loaves...which really could have made 6-7 but I used the extra to top off the 3 large loaves.  I had all 8 loaves in the oven at the same time on top of a air bake cookie sheet.  I cooked it for about 47-48 minutes.  It all came out PERFECT!

After reading the reviews, I chose to add dried cherries and semi-sweet chocolate chips.  It was better than okay but not the best bread I've ever made.  We must have liked it, though because it's all gone!  Still, I prefer making quick breads. To me they are better and I don't have to "adopt a pet" by taking care of the starter every day.

My husband just loves the chocolate flavor. We have tried many different variations and I occasionally make the bread as a bundt. It makes a tasty cake and I like to pour ganache over it and serve it with whipped cream.

As I sit here licking the crumbs from my plate, I reflect on the confusion I experienced with this recipe.  But first, let me say it IS delicious.  The recipe called for "1 (5.9 oz.) pkg instant chocolate pudding mix".  The largest I could find was Jello's 2.1 oz. size.  So, I assumed it was a typo.  Also, it called for TWO 9x5 loaf pans, but it could have easily fit into ONE as they raised only to about 2 to 2 1/2" high.  I used the one box of 2.1 oz. Jello pudding, substituted the sugar for a slightly less amount of Altern (Splenda), used olive oil instead of regular vegetable oil and a bit less than the 1 cup, and used a litthle less salt.  It was really moist and tasty.  My huband loved it!  Next time I'll get adventurous and add chocolate chips.  Thank you, KATHY422, for this great recipe!

My co-worker made this and I made the lemon-poppy seed version (very good) to bring to work last week.  The chocolate bread was okay but very bland; not  chocolately tasting at all, so I'm not sure why so many reviewers claim it's like chocolate cake or even fudge brownies!  (Makes me wonder if they've ever had *real* chocolate cake before! LOL)

Meanwhile, I think the recipe can be salvaged by using chocolate *fudge* pudding and/or adding cocoa to the mix.  It could also really benefit from chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, Andes mint chips (loved that suggestion, folks!), and/or nuts.

Or another suggestion is to make the bread as is but serve it with a spread made with peanut butter or Nutella, cream cheese and powdered sugar.

This recipe turned out great. I did four mini loaves, which took about 50 minutes (do not fill your container more than half full! this stuff puffs right up). My pudding package sizes were a bit different; I used 3.9 oz of Instant Chocolate and 1.34 oz of Instant Sugar-Free Vanilla, since that's the closest I could get with what I had! Then added 2 T. of cocoa powder, after reading all the reviewers wishing for more chocolate flavor. The only other thing I did different was coat the pan with cinnamon/sugar, kuz I love cinnamon flavored chocolate. The taste was awesome, wonderful texture; will make again!

This was my 1st experience w/ the Friendship Bread starter and this is a great recipe.  Not quite chocolaty enough for me so will add cocoa next time.  I did add craisins & chocolate chips and they were nicely distributed through out instead of sinking to the bottom.  Overall 4.5 ****

I made this recipe as was written and was disappointed.  I thought the flavor was lackluster for what had the texture of a chocolate cake.  Next time, I'll just make chocolate cake...

Update:  just checked breads and they were not done in center...but toothpick came out clean!!!  Must have been the high fat content..should bake them 40 minutes at 325 probably.

I made this with the following changes: I only used 1/2 teaspoon salt since regular recipe only calls for a 1/2, I always only use 3/4 cup sugar (less sugar lets you taste the chocolate), added 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa to dry mixture, used 1/2 cup cream instead of milk and heated cream 30 seconds and then disolved 1 teaspoon instant dry decaf in it, (milk or half & half would have worked too) and added 1 cup mini semisweet chocolate chips. Baked in two loaf pans at 325 for about 35 minutes, came out tasting and looking like a cakey brownie and the center fell-but tasted very chocolatey. Still, might not go through this trouble again to make a brownie.  The regular cinnamon (or you can make it maple flavored by omitting the vanilla and adding maple flavoring) amish bread can't be beat...

We loved this.  I did not want to make 4 new starters b/c I am tired of Friendship Breads,so I just scooped out 3/4 cup of starter and added 1/3 c of flour, sugar, and milk.  That made about a cup of starter that was ready to add to this recipe.  It is not overly chocolatey.  But really good, nevertheless.

These were WONDERFUL! I used someone else's advice and added a bag of milk chocolate chips to it, and made muffins out of them. FABULOUS! Just, be sure to not leave them sit out, or else they get a bit hard on the top. I left one batch out, and they are a little hard, while I put the second batch in an air tight container right away, and they are still extrememly moist a day later. Has anyone tried them with a cream cheese frosting? If so, let me know how they were, and what you used!

This was wonderful. I was going to freeze one loaf but family ate it before I had a chance.  I used almond extract, chocolate chips and candied cherrys.  Tasted like chocolate covered cherries.

Definitely be sure to add 1 Tbsp cocoa powder to keep  your bread from having a greenish color in the middle. I also added about 1 Cup mini chocolate chips.

I use a pkg of chocolate & a pkg of chocolate fudge pudding mix.  I also add about 3/4 cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I haven't had any complaints from my taste testers!  They are very moist & delicious.  I bake at 325 F for about 35 minutes.

I'm sure this is the best, but my concern is the starter. This is my 4th day making the starter and it has not bubbled. What did I do wrong. I look forward to making this bread.  Mary

This is a great variation on the standard recipes.  Husband loved it!  Only change I made was to add 1 cup mini chocolate chips to the batter.  Thanks for this recipe.

I felt it was better when choco chips were added...  As for the GREEN you saw... I don't know if this is the same thing... but this happened to me with cupcakes once.  Turned out my roommate had made blueberry muffins the weekend before and decided not to wash the pan.  Not sure why I didn't notice this ahead of time!

I made this substituting 1 tsp of Raspberry Extract. Also found sugar for the rim of a martini glass and used that to "flour" to pan. It was called Chocolate Candy. It gave it the traditional sugared coating we love on Amish Bread. I added a third egg, like most of the other recipes call for, too. Quite good and different.

My family loved this! My husband doesn't usually eat bread like this.  He ate half the loaf before going to bed. I added half a bag of milk chocolate chips and baked for 5 extra minutes.  I am waiting for my starter dough to be ready for another round.

I made this recipe and was utterly unimpressed.  In fact, I was disappointed...it was dry, didn't taste like much of anything, and it got dark before the suggested time.  I had high hopes for it, too.

Very good!!  I always add a teaspoon of cinnamon into the flour mix, as well as one cup of frozen chocolate chips just before baking for an extra punch of chocolate.

This was really good, everyone loved it.  To lower the fat a little, I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  Plus I used 1% milk because thats all I have in the house.  Will definitely make this again.

I don't know why, but it didn't turn out well at all.  It was dry and didn't really even taste like chocolate cake at all.
