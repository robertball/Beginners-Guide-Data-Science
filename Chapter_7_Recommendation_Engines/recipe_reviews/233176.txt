I used this on a pumpkin spike cake ("Easy Pumpkin Muffins", but baked in 9x13) last night & it was delicious.  I used dried blueberries (because I had run out of dried cranberries & don't keep raisins on hand).  The recipe doesn't say how much water to use...I used about 1/2 - 2/3 cup.  I also cooked it down a lot longer than this says....I wanted the apples really soft & for it to be a bit "saucier" to spoon over the cake.

This was my first try at Apple compote. The recipe was fine. I added about 1/4 cup of water to the apples, and I used very large Granny Smith apples. The topping was good on waffles and I Think it would work in crepes as well. This is a solid basic recipe that you can customize as you see fit.

Yummy!! Substituted brown sugar for white, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg.  Also simmered on low for another 5 minutes after I  added whiskey etc. Planning to serve over goat cheese with honey and almond/raisin baguette toast rounds. Can't wait for it to cool down so I can get to tasting!!

Looks great but you didn't specify how much water to use. =( I definitely like the addition of the butter, though! And I like to use mango rum in my fruit compotes when I can. But tonight I think I'm going to make this using a bit of cranberry juice. Bet that'll be mahvelous!  =)
