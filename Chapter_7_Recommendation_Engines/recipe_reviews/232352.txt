Yummy! I used semi-sweet chocolate chips (personal preference) and we thought these were very good. Thanks for sharing.

The name of this recipe implied it would taste like toffee. I didn't get that. To me it tasted like a spin off of Magic Cookie Bars with the coconut sweetened condensed milk and chocolate. These tasted good I just didn't get the toffee flavor I was looking for. I added chopped almonds to the top of mine....

I did this last night and it was huge hit. I followed the recipe exactly and was amazed that a toffee flavor could come from toasted coconut. It was very easy and is definitely a do again. By the way I opted to melt the chocolate for the frosting using the microwave (pulsing at 30 sec intervals) and that worked well.

These were like coconut macaroons with a chocolate topping. Very tasty but not toffee. I used unsweetened coconut and semi-sweet chocolate chips and they were plenty sweet.

Not bad. Just that they weren't tender enough.Maybe 35 minutes is too long to bake. Although the taste was excellent.

I chose this recipe to use up the condensed milk I accidentally bought instead of evaporated milk. What a happy ending. These are chewy with a nice texture and flavor. My icing was too thin so I added a bit of corn syrup to help harden it. This may have caused them to turn out sweeter. So I cut them into smaller pieces and ended up with about 28. I ll remember this recipe.

The four stars is for the taste - don't know if it was me doing something wrong but the consistency was all upset - the coconut bar part was too hard and the chocolate frosting too runny and slipping all over the place. Will try it again though because this combination of chocolate and coconut is soooo good.

Coconut lovers rejoice! These bars are divine. Packed with sweet toasted coconut and covered in milky chocolate. When making the frosting I melted the chips and the butter then stirred in the milk and remaining ingredients. This is like eating a candy bar. Even my husband who doesn't like coconut liked these.

These were very straight-forward and there was nothing wrong with them at all they just weren't "wow" bars. I subbed brown rice syrup for the corn syrup and semisweet morsels for the milk chocolate and that was just fine.... more to my taste in fact. They are definitely super sticky and super sweet. I also have to wonder if "toffee" is the best name for these bars.... they are more like cocoa-coconut bars or something.
