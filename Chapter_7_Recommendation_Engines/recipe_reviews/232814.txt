This recipe is great!  It is very retro with the warm dressing but the combo of butter, sugar, and vinegar is delectable!  I did not use slivered almonds because I had toasted pecans and that were fabulous.  I recommend this for everyone!

Just made this for the second time in 2 weeks. Fabulous! Didn't change a thing. Didn't add croutons though.

This recipe is very easy & delicious. I may substitute another sweetener for some of the sugar next time I make it; or I may  decrease the amount of sugar by 1/3.

Delicious just the way it is, I skipped the cooling step because I was in a hurry and it didn't seem to take away from the product's end result, just make sure its completely dissolved!    So good, put bacon on anything and the kids will eat it.

Very good salad.  The dressing was good, but I think the salad would be just as good with a bottled poppyseed dressing.  I used cashews instead of almonds and opted not to use the croutons.

This was a great salad. Not hard to make and very tasty. I served it to guests and they were very complimentary of both the salad and dressing. I didn't toss with dressing, because I knew my husband wouldn't care for it, so I put out several dressing choices and explained this one.  I will definitely make this again.

I made it without onions and croutons. The salad was delicious, although I will use honey or a little less sugar next time.

This salad was so good.  We used 2 Tsp of honey, rather than the sugar.  Excellent dressing and salad.

The butter in the dressing made it congeal over everything in the salad giving everything a solidified butter coating that was not appealing.   I should have thought about that.   No, just no on this salad dressing.

Delicious as is. On occasion I’ve added dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds and/or chia seeds. But I like crunchy salads. I’ve also occasionally replaced the oranges (fresh is best) with strawberries. This is a versatile salad. But, the dressing is Mmmmmoowa!

Very good salad! Only changes I made was no nuts (d/t allergies) and I sauteed the fresh mushrooms in a pad of butter.

Flavors were great combination.  Did not include onion.  Would not use all the dressing next time as it made it too soggy.

This is a great recipe.  I didn't have time to let it cool, so placed it in the fridge.  Skipped the croutons only because I don't like them in a 'fruit' type salad.  You can substitute lwttuce (leaf, romaine) for spinach.  A nice twist would be to substitute honey and mustard and less red wine vinegar.

Just made it. Added chicken breast for protein to make the recipe an entrée. Used pecans. Excellent! Will use the almonds next time to contrast.
