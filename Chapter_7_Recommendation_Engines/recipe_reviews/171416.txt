As the best friend mentioned above, who finally joined this site (thanks Lis!), I have one correction to share that may improve the recipe, especially for the person who already tried it.  The pineapple should be the first layer:  Spread pineapple over crust; pour blended cream cheese over it.  Sprinkle top with nutmeg (Aunt Tootie's secret ingredient)  Enjoy!

I'm on the fence about this one.  The flavor and the texture is good.  It is not as sweet as I thought it would be.  The initial layer taste more like a custard.  I thought it would taste more like a cheese cake?  Also, mine got so runny that the pinapple sunk in some spots.  I think it is supposed to have 2 distinct layers.  I have never had pineapple pie and I had all the ingrediants in the pantry so I gave it a whirl.  Thanks for sharing.

This pie is VERY good! I didn't use a blender, just a beater to make the custard mixture fluffy, and followed the advice to put the pineapple filling on the bottom. Yum!

I love this pie, not to hard to make, I did use the already made deep dish pie crust. Like I said it was pretty easy and so delicious, I have made 4 of them know..It's so hard not to eat the whole pie. Try I can almost guarantee you'll love it..
