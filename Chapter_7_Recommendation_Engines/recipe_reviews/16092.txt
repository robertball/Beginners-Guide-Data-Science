Good stuff but I added some ingrediants which I am sure improved this recipe a great deal: used 1lb of ground beef, 8oz noodles, 15oz can of tomato sauce, 1Tbls of worchestershire sauce, 1Tbls brwn sugar, 2tsp of chili powder and apprx 8ox shredded cheddar cheese mixed in to melt. I think perhaps next time, I'll add some mushrooms or green peppers. The extra noodles gave this more substance, the increased tomato sauce made this not so dry and the additional spices gave this a mild kick. Other than those additions/changes, I did follow the recipe (kept the corn, garlic powder etc...) This is a recipe that is very easy to adjust to your tastes.

I really want to give this recipe 4 stars because of it's simplicity and the fact that it is a good 'base,' but it's very bland for my own tastes. Especially if you're using tomato sauce from the can, spices need to be added or else it has that 'metalic' taste to it. I browned my beef with the recommended amount of onion and added some diced green pepper and minced garlic.  I also left out the corn. Then I added more garlic powder, sea salt, pepper, an Italian seasoning bland (about a teaspoon), paprika, and a few pinches of sugar. Then I added the cooked pasta (used shells, and way more than the half cup), and added fresh diced tomatoes. I let that simmer for about five minutes then transferred the mixture to a baking dish and topped with large tomato slices and mozzarella cheese.  I baked it at 350 for about 25 minutes.  Turned out great this way.

I loved this recipe. It was quick , easy, and tasted wonderful. I added a can of tomatoes with green chilis and a little chili powder. Kids think it is great, too.

We just made this last night, and it was really good and very quick. I did make changes though. I didn't have ground beef, so I used ground pork. I used Sun Dried Tomatoe Sauce (as it already has big chunks of tomatoe in it, so I wouldn't have to use the stewed tomatoes) I added purple onion (becauce I find them sweet and flavorful) I also used a few dashs of Franks Red Hot Chicken Wing Sauce, a few Tblp Brown Sugar, and a few dashs of Black Bean sauce, as well as lots of garlic. Basically I made my usual Spahgetti sauce. (I didn't use any corn because that sounds a little strange to me!)
I used Rotini instead of maccaroni, because I find that the sauce sticks better to it. I then assembled it like a casserole. A layer of cooked pasta, half the meat sauce, a layer of grated aged cheddar cheese, repeat. I then baked it at 350 for about 25 mins, till it was all hot and bubbly and melted. Very yummy!!! We had it with ceasar salad, and fresh french bread. Mmmmm! My boyfriend had 3 helpings and ended up moaning on the couch, uncomfortably full. *LoL* 
I'll deffinetly make it again.

Tired and un-inspired, I logged on to find a recipe that would use up the ground turkey I had and that didn't require a trip to the store. Your recipe filled my requirements so we had it last night for dinner. Everyone enjoyed it, but I think my food snob hubby actually liked it the best. This is not our usual fare but it was very yummy, and just what we needed last night. I tripled the noodles called for and added more tomato sauce because of that, thus lowering the meat per serving ratio. I omitted the corn just because I wasnt in the mood, but would try it in the future. This was a very simple recipe, fast and easy, thank you for sharing.

I used a 28 oz can of diced tomates and added about 1/2 a can of water and put the uncooked pasta (shells work well)with all the other ingredients, then I cooked it until the pasta was cooked, put in a casserole dish and sprinkled cheese on the top. MMMMMMMMMMMM delicious, even my brother who hates everything loved it, I left out the corn and had a salad on the side instead.

You know what?  This exceeded my expectations and turned out to be a very satisfying meal.  I have a very empty pantry right now and just trying to make do with what I have, I stumbled upon this recipe.  I pretty much followed it up to the end aside from using ground turkey in place of the beef, but once I tasted it, I NEEDED to add something.  Chose chili powder, cumin and a dash or two (maybe even three) of hot sauce and finished it off with a Mexican cheese blend.  Was great - thanks for the recipe!

A good, simple, easily customizable recipe for days where you just don't feel like spending alot of time and energy in the kitchen. I doubled the elbows, halved the ground beef, added 2 cloves minced garlic, used seasoned pepper, Italian seasoning, brown sugar, a splash of White Wine Worcestershire, cayenne and doubled up on the tomatoes and sauce. Didn't add the corn. We actually enjoyed this dinner very much, with the suggested garlic bread and a salad. Thanks, Diane!

I JUST made this for dinner tonight and I have to say it is VERY good!! I added extra pasta to it, used some minced garlic, and shredded cheddar cheese over the top of it all and I'm VERY happy with the results as is my family. I think this is a great basic recipe that you can do so many variations on to make it uniquely your own. I highly recommend it for taste and easiness.

My Grandma makes this same thing with egg noodles instead of macaroni and you put it in the oven topped with cheese long enough to heat through and melt the cheese. We call it Tallarini. YUMMY!

This was the type of meal I rebelled against when I had to eat in college dining halls.  

I sampled this when it was nearly done and it was totally flavorless.  It wasn't repulsive and it certainly wasn't good.  I tried adding some seasonings (oregano, basil, more garlic powder, etc., but nothing helped.  This is a big, bland YUK!  My daughter would never touch this stuff again and neither would I.

I took the many of the  suggestions and added 1 can of kidney beans as well.  Because I only had a 15 oz can of tomato sauce I doubled it and then used about 1.5 Cups macaroni.  The suggestions I added were the worchestershire sauce, cumin & cayenne.

I know people hate it when you alter a recipe and then give the review but I actually like to read the variations.  I altered this by adding cumin, just a dash of chili powder and diced tomatoes with green chili's instead of diced tomatoes, I then topped with cheddar cheese and baked for 25' and served with salsa.  It is pretty good.

Mmm reminded me of a Goulash we made in "Camp Fire Girls"  I used about 8oz. of macaroni with 1 pound of ground beef.  I threw in some diced celery and onion powder instead of onions for the kids sake.  I added some chili powder, a dash of cayenne and worctershire sauce too;  I just knew what would make this 4 star into a 5 star recipe!   When it was ready I put it in a casserole dish and sprinkled cheese on it!  The kids will eat anything with cheese on top! :)

I have made this a couple of times now and my family loves it! I am not a big fan of corn mixed into anything, but my husband and some love it, and I found that I actually liked the corn added in as well. Gave it that extra "umph". The only altering I have done is mixed in a can of Rotel (tomatoes with green chili peppers) because I was out of plain canned tomatoes and it was even yummier! I have also put shredded cheddar over the top and got rave reviews as well. To sum it up.. there are never leftovers when I make this and that speaks well for any recipe!

This is a good basic recipe but as others suggested I needed to doctor it up quite a bit.  I used marinara sauce instead of tomato sauce (didn't have any on hand), also I added fresh basil and fresh oregano.  After adding quite a bit of garlic, rosemary, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper, it was pretty good.  My picky eaters even had seconds.  Thanks  for the recipe.

This is easy to prepare but has hardly any taste at all. Needs a huge injection of herbs, garlic, chilli, parmesan cheese etc... way too bland as is!

I made this twice, the first time I only used diced tomatoes because I didn't have any tomato sauce (a big mistake). The second time I used just tomato sauce, and some tomato paste as well. As others suggested, I added more noodles, green pepper, brown sugar, parmesian, and chili powder. Then I melted a bunch of shredded mozzarella on top. We had these with biscuits, and it was very good! It's nice to find a good skillet dinner recipe! Thanks!

My husband and I really enjoyed this "goulash" like recipe.  We spiced it up a little bit by adding about 1 tablespoon of chili powder and 1 tablespoon of brown sugar to bring out the flavor in the tomatoes. I will definitely make this again, it was so quick!

This was a very quick and easy recipe.  It tasted pretty good as well.  I left out the stewed and diced tomatoes and instead used jarred spaghetti sauce.  I would definitely make it again.

This didn't knock my socks off but it was very good, very easy and very fast. I like my pasta saucy so I used one 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, one small can of Italian paste and one 14 oz can of tomato puree. I only used 1 pound of ground turkey and I minced my onion very fine so my kids wouldn't see it. (If they see ANY onion, nothing gets past the lips) I used fresh garlic instead of powder. I thought the corn sounded really strange but decided to try it anyway just to eat something different. It was actually very good. I really liked the texture and flavor of the corn. It was a nice surprise. My three kids picked at it but I find it is difficult to find something all three will eat especially when they have been sneaking snacks since they got home from school. 
I think this would have been good with some bell pepper as well (red or green) but left it out to keep the kids happy. Same with the cheese. A good idea but I left it out to keep the kids happy.

This recipe was really easy and quick, but I thought it was missing something.  I think I would spice it up more next time.  However, my two year old daughter ate three helpings, which shocked me!

This is good if you have no time to cook and just want to get something on the table. All the ingredients are already in your pantry. But the end result is not that great. Granted, it is better than Hamburger Helper. I did add some italian seasoning, minced garlic and worcestshire sauce.

I made this dish last week, and just as others said it was a little bland. I kicked it up with some italian seasoning, garlic powder, and some other seasonings around the kitchen. FANTASTIC! I'll be making this dish again.

This recipe lacked flavor and the corn was sort of an odd pairing for a spaghetti-like dish.  My son wouldn't eat it either.  I wouldn't recommend this recipe unless you're really in a pinch for something quick and easy.

Well this is exactly what I was looking for considering I only had ground beef and tomato sauce in the house. This is edible but I wouldn't recommend it.

I just made this tonight and thought that it was pretty good.  I will probably make this again since it was so quick.  My 6yo liked it even got seconds.  I to made a few changes.  I added more pasta and used jar spaghetti sauce and then for some added kick used red pepper and then my favorite sauce Tiger sauce which gives it a sweet spicy kick to it.

After reading some of the reviews, I made my own "southwestern casserole" version of this dish and it turned out pretty good!  Instead of garlic powder I used fresh garlic and in place of stewed tomatoes I used a can of diced tomatoes w/green chiles.  I also added about a tbsp. of brown sugar.  I put half the mixture in a casserole dish and layered mexican blend shredded cheese and then the other half of the mixture on top and another layer of cheese.  Covered and baked it at 375 until bubbly and cheese is melted.  My kids didn't like the corn, my husband and I did.  Maybe next time I'll try half w/corn, half without.

Wonderful go to meal. I make this on a weekday night. It is great quick and hardy meal! I changed it just a bit. I add more noodles, 1 Tbs Worchestershire sauce, 1Tbs brown sugar, 15oz or more of prepared tomatoe sauce. Everything else is perfect.

I look for recipes by ingredients I have on hand.  I used ground turkey and seasoned it with a seasoning packet I found in the supermarket that sounded good that I liked.  I used pasta I had on hand.  So, based on my twikes, I rate this a 5 star.  I put all the ingredients together in a casserole dish and topped with the cheese I had on hand and french fried onions ( I usualy use these for Thanksgiving green bean casserole) to give it a crunch and baked it until the cheese was melted.  It was an easy, delicous, filling weeknight meal. - Honestly, I was penny pinching with my cupboard ing. and it was awesome.  So, I suggest to others- use what you have and make this your own! Yummy!

Mmmm mmm, very good. I did add some fresh garlic, LOTS more pasta and seasonings, but it was a good base recipe to season-to-taste.
Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe, I make it all the time. A this point I don't really measure anything anymore, I just kind of eyeball it. My neice and nephew are very picky eaters and they love it. All the rest of my family loves it too. I always add a handful of cheddar cheese when I add all the other ingredients, and I top mine with cheese. I also use minced onions and I add salt and pepper to the meat and when I add everything else. Sooooo good the day after also.

I used this as a base recipe and thought the end result turned out great.  I went mexican with it using garlic, onion and green pepper with the ground beef.  I used roasted garlic tomato sauce and diced tomatoes with green chilies.  I added cumin, chili powder and black olives along with the corn.  I also cooked the ground beef with the cumin and chili powder.  Added the macaroni, salt and pepper and served with cornbread muffins.  Great hearty meal - I will make this again!

This was excellent!  Even my husband, who is quite picky, loved it.  At first I was skeptical of this recipe because of the claims that it was bland, and my first helping was kind of bland, so I added more salt to it and it did the trick.  Very flavorful and easy to make.  I made the recipe exactly as it was listed except that I had a can of tomatoes with oregano and other spices already in it.  I think that helped a bit too.  I might try a little less meat and a few more noodles next time, but it's good just the way it is too!

Excellent! The whole family LOVED this! I was surprised because it seemed like it'd be just another easy (boring) meal but it was great and I'll be making it again in no time! Thank you, Diane!  Do this to polish off the dish: add 1 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp season salt, and 1/2 tsp italian seasoning.

Awesome! My 3 year old throws a fit when he sees onions in his food and he saw them and ate them this time.  I used the tomato sauce and diced tomatoes that come with garlic flavoring because my husband beleives there is no such thing as too much garlic.  Incidentally, I served this with garlic bread and it was fantastic!!  (Throw in a glass of white zinfindel wine to make the perfect meal!)

My kids LOVED this. When they came to the table they were all complaining saying they don't want to try it. But I told them just one bite and they were hooked. Differently a new family favorite. The only thing I did different was put it in a glass dish and sprinkled with cheese and put in the oven for ten minutes. Perfect!

This was pretty good! I didn't use the exact measuring units per se, I just adjusted to what I thought looked/tasted right (I like to think I'm some super cook lol)! My friends came over and they enjoyed it. I took the advice of everyone else and tweaked it to my liking. I didn't have shredded cheese or anything so I went 'old school' used american cheese slices. After it was all in the pot together, I put half the mixture into a casserole dish and took three slices of cheese and split them in half and put them on top, then I spread the other half of the mixture on top and did the same thing again with the cheese. Then I put the whole dish under the broiler for about 3 to 4 minutes, just enough for the cheese to melt. Then I took it out, and voila, dinner was served! I  served it with grated Parmesan cheese and couldn't stop eating it. I went back for seconds, and thirds.....

This recipe needed some tweaking, which I knew before I tried it. I added almost 2 tbsp of chili powder and a dash of red cayenne pepper and a dash of cumin as well.  Also 4 times the pasta and sprinkle with shredded cheddar at the table.  YUM YUM

Easy recipe to make. My teenagers did a great job putting this one together for dinner. Without my help. They used two cloves of garlic instead of powder. This is a keeper for their bachelor recipe box. Teenagers like easy recipes that they can be put together in 15 minutes are less.

This was good. I modified it as I didn't have pasta in the house. I started by sauteeing onion & garlic, then browned the meat. I made two boxes of mac & cheese & mixed it all together.

The four star rating is really credited to the reviews.  I followed a lot of their suggestions and it was fabulous.  I increased the macaroni to 2 cups, replaced the garlic powder with 3 minced cloves, and substituted Ro Tel tomatoes (extra hot) for the stewed tomatoes.  I also replaced the tomato sauce with canned enchilada sauce, about 12 oz.  Outstanding!  This made it really spicy, but my 1 year old still finished his plate.

Very good.  I followed suggestions by some of the other reviewers and added 1 cup of noodles, along with 1 Tbs of brown sugar.  I also used fresh diced tomatos and melted cheese into hamburger mixture.  Will definitely use again.

We make this every thursday night (Survivor and Big Brother night) in our house, but it's called mexican goulash!  We make it exactly the same except the tomatoes are rotel tomatoes (with the diced jalapenos) and to the meat we add cumin, chili powder and ground red pepper. Also, instead of elbows, I usually use rotini because the kids like the shape and the cheese clings to it better.

Tasty and the family liked it. I also added a little cheddar cheese to the sauce which makes it more rich and thick. A good weekday, comfort food dinner.

This tasted like Hamburger Helper's Lasagna to me, but I'm sure it is much healthier for you. I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, added a clove of chopped garlic alond with the onion, and used Lawry's(seasoned salt)instead of plain salt and also added granulated garlic and granulated onion, since I did not have powder.  I topped my bowl with parmesan cheese, while my husband top his with a bit of cheddar cheese. Not a knock off your socks meal, but it was tasty and quick.

This was good with my alterations. I seasoned the ground beef with salt, pepper, basil, oregano, garlic powder and a dash of paprika prior to cooking. Instead of using tomato sauce, I used pasta sauce (cheese flavor) and added half of it before adding the corn and pasta. I mixed well and added the pasta (shells). I added the rest of the pasta sauce and added some shredded Cheddar cheese. Afterall, it came out delicous.

After cooked, I added cheese and baked for 20 min. Was very good that way. It resembled a goulash, which the kids didn't like too much, but I did.

this dinner was ok i had to add alot seasoning because it was so bland and was to much tomato taste for me, if i do decide to make this again i will probably use something besides tomato sauce to give it a better flavor.

I've made this meal yesterday.  I did add sharp cheddar cheese on top like others had suggested and I added a bit of oregano.  My husband and I loved it, it made the house smell lovely too.  It makes great leftovers.  Will add this to my repertoire.

I really liked this recipe however we are allergic to wheat so I had to modify the ingredients.  I boiled large sliced of red potatoes until they were soft and put the beef mix on top.  Then I layered with cheese and baked on 350 for 10 minutes.  My kids loved this!  They said it was great!  I added a little more seasoning and some paste to thicken the mix.  Also, we used sour cream once we got it on our plates at the table.
YUMMY! If your allergic to wheat, try yams or red potatoes!

Fast and Easy!  My family liked it.  A little bland, we jazzed it up with garlic salt and pepper.  Overall, pretty good!

MMMM MMMM good! Super easy to make and super fast. Chances are you will have everything in your pantry to make this. The only changes I made was to add green chilis, diced bell pepper, brown sugar, worchestershire sauce and hot buffalo wing seasoning. I deleted the diced tomatoes and added tomato sauce only. Wonderful, wonderful recipe. Loved by all. This recipe is so easy to adapt. Go wild with it!

Pretty good, but too liquidy so I use tomato paste instead of sauce.  Kids love it.

My family really enjoyed this although the finished product was pretty far from the original recipe. I used ground beef with an italian sausage for extra flavor, browned with lots of garlic, italian seasoning, crushed red peppers, worchestershire, mushrooms and a whole cup of noodles. For sauce I added 1 can of V-8 and then a can of flavored crushed tomatoes. Not bland at all and good for leftovers too.

I rarely, rarely make casseroles such as this...but I decided to try this one.  This tasted like a Hamburger Helper dish to me.  There were no dominant flavors, just a big plate of glop.  I even spiced it up with green chiles, chili powder, etc. and it still did nothing for me.  Guess I need that something to wow me.   Won't make this again, which is too bad, since it was really easy to prepare.

Very moist.  This was a good recipe to fix when you want something out of the normal.  I will try it again.  Next time I will add green peppers.  My husband loved it and he added shredded mozarella cheese to the top for added taste.

Well, my 15 month old son loved it, however as for me, very bland, very boring.  I did not care much for this at all.  The next day, I creamed the leftovers and served it over toast and that was excellent.  But the original recipe I was just not impressed.

I was greatly surprised at this recipe!  Perhaps I was overly hungry as well but I thought that this was very easy to prepare, very tasty and the ingredients list is stuff you've already got in your cupboard!  Try adding melted mozza or white cheddar on top for a variation!

Sort of bland so I added 1 teaspoon cumin and a small can of enchilada sauce (hot) and 1/4 bell pepper. Sooo much better.  With that much sauce, the corn went with it nicely.  Will add Mrs. Dash's pepper flakes next time to kick it up.

I made it strictly by your directions, and enjoyed it, as did my grandson.  
We are both quite curious about the origin of the recipe's name.   We are both natives of the Atlanta area and recall a local, past restaurant of much notoriety by the name of "Aunt Fanny's Cabin". Any connection?

Whenever I have lots of kids to feed, I make this for dinner, because they all seem to love it!  I use more pasta than ground beef, and I add lots of other spices as the other reviews have suggested.

Yummy meal! I added chili powder,paprika,4 cloves of garlic,half an onion,teaspoon of worchestershire,and a few dashes of tobasco sauce.  I cooked the corn,tomato sauce,other liquids and stewed tomatos (yes,i used both)while cooking the meat,garlic and onions together in another pan. This is a great meal,the corn gives great flavor and texture. Dunno why anyone would whine about delicious corn flavor in ANYTHING! LOL

My family liked this recipe's taste but they didn't rave about it.  I did though because of how easy it was to make.  I did make some substitutions due to the fact that I had to work with what I had in the cupboard.  I also made a bigger pot of it because I like to have leftovers for the next day's lunch.  

I increased the ground beef to 2 1/2 pounds, used a jar of spagetti sauce instead of the can of tomato's and tomato sauce, I didn't use the onion because my kids would reject it before tasting it but used onion powder to taste along with the garlic powder and salt/pepper.  I added 2 cups of grated chedder cheese and increased the uncooked pasta to 2 cups.  Lastly, I added green beans.  It was the only veggie I had available.  I think the corn would have been very good in it.  Maybe I will try it with mixed veggies next time and would add a little chili pepper for "kick" if the kids were not eating it.  

This was definately a recipe that you can play with to make it your own.  By the way... it tasted very good the next day.  That is always good to know when it comes to leftovers.

This is an "okay" recipe, it's good to use as a base and add your own embellishments to.  Otherwise, it came out rather bland.

This was okay and average.  Nothing really jumped out at me when I ate this.  Bland.

Very bland! I added cumin, chili powder, cheese, and a little sugar to spice it up a bit.  It was pretty good after that, but the recipe as written has no taste.

Aunt Fannie should be fired.  This was such an odd dish.  The corn ruined it for us.  We won't be making this again.

Good and easy.  I went the cheaters way and added a jar of spaghetti sauce and took other reviewers advice and added extra seasonings (Italian seasoning and fresh garlic.) I then tranferred to a casserole dish and took RanValRJ's advice and put french fried onions on half of the mixture and left the other as is.  Baked in the oven for a few minutes and was pleasantly suprised that everyone preferred the side with the french fried onions.  Who would have known.  Thanks!

This was surprisingly good but I only gave it 4 stars because, like many of the previous reviewers, I had to "spice" it up a bit.  In addition to the seasoning that the recipe called for, I also added parsley, cajun seasoning (someone previously had added that and it sounded interesting), as well as a little bit of red pepper.  Also, I cooked and added about 1 1/2 cups pasta (the 1/2 c. just didn't seem like enough).  My 8 and 6 year olds loved it and even wanted seconds.  My 4 year old ate it with minimal complaints (to know my 4 year old, that's a compliment).  I love meals where all the food groups are represented all in 1 heaping scoopful.

I thought this was yummy and so did my family. I knew it was a hit when my one year old tried it and actually liked it. It is very hard to find anything he likes-except crackers. I cooked the beef with 2 cloves of fresh garlic to add a little more flavor.
We will be making this one again.

This is just like mom used to make and we called it "meat and noodles".  Yes, we are original LOL.  The only change from moms recipe was the corn.  Spiced it up more based on other reviews by adding fresh garlic, parsley and oregano.  Good stuff.

This was surprisingly good!  I used what I had on hand, which was egg noodles and crushed tomatoes.  I also added basil, oregano, and paprika liberally and did not measure the garlic powder - just sprinkled a bunch on there!  I added a can of green beans too.  Nice, easy dinner!

A good recipe to jazz up to your own taste. A little bland as-is, but add some spices and it makes for a good dinner. Good base recipe.

This was fast, easy, cheap and yummy. I added some celery, bell pepper and fresh chopped garlic to the onions. I also topped with 2 cups shredded cheese as well as adding a few spices like Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes! Very Good! Thanks!

I changed this recipe quite drastically because as is it just seemed a little too blah. I was in the mood for chili so I added half of a green pepper, increased the tomato sauce to 2 cans and added 2 cans of stewed tomatoes. Then I added about 2 or 3 tablespoons of chili powder and a little cayenne. Used shell pasta because it’s what I had. It still seemed to be missing something so I sprinkled on some celery salt and that did the trick. Topped with shredded cheddar and everyone loved it.

I omitted the onion (I have 2 small children and if they see them, they don't eat the dish), and added 1 can of rotel tomatoes instead of the stewed tomatoes.  I doubled the tomato sauce and macaroni and seasoned it a little heavier.  It was very fast and easy and very good!  I would make again!

This was a good simple meal when you don't know what to make.  I didn't have tomato sauce so used fresh tomatoes it was good.  I did find myself jazzing it up with more spices but it was good.

My family loved this! Very easy to prepare, and is one of those kind that you could add many different things to it to suit your tastes. I added more noodles to it, and have plenty of leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I bet it would be great with either some grated or parmesan cheese on it. Thanks for sharing this one!

This is wonderful. Like a comfort food for me. I add chili powder, green pepper or whatever sounds good at the time. We also like shredded cheese on top. Thanks.

This recipe was easy.  I put more noodles in and used shells instead.  I also added one more can of sauce,  It was a nice change!

This recipe was unbelievably easy and really delicious. I put left overs in individual containers and it made a perfect meal the next day. I will certainly make this again.

This is a good base recipe which allows for lots of personal preference modifications.  Because I was making it for a crowd, I used 1.5 cups of macaroni, 1 lb of ground turkey, 1 can diced tomatoes, 2 8 oz cans tomato sauce, and a whole onion.  I added sausage seasoning to the meat, lots of italian seasoning, and ended up adding several ounces of Velveeta at the end because it needed something extra.  It turned out great and I was left with an empty pan.

I thought this was a very simple recipe, although like the others I tweaked it a little. I omitted the corn just because I didn't have that on hand, and added Rotel along with some sage, parsley, and ms dash. It turned out great and I think the rotel added that kick to it, even my 2 year old ate it.

It was alright.  I took the advice of others and added mushrooms and bell peppers; received the input that it needed more garlic.  We tend to like flavorful food, this was kinda bland for our tastes.  Thought it might be better if the sauce weren't so soupy.

My family loved this espically my mum but I think there was a little too much corn.  Also next time I'd just put a little more tomato sauce in and forget the tomatoes altogether

Its a very quick and easy recipe, but its overall taste and quality its so very basic.  Its not that big of a deal, and its just for a simple meal.  Not for a "come one over to dinner" type of meal.  Just a quick meal.
