Isnt cabbage on the grill awesome! But I use just foil and wrap wedges indivuallly there is no mess and each serving can be customed if you have different tastes in the family like I do! That way you dont have to ruin a baking dish. Also reyonld wrap has the "foil bags" you can use if you are doing a large order!

This was so good!  I never thought of doing cabbage on the grill.  It tasted like Haluski with out the noodles!  I didn't bother with the whole metal baking dish thing.  I just cut the cabbage into wedges and removed the core. I cut pieces of foil big enough for each wedge then sprayed the foil with Pam so nothing would stick.  I seasoned each wedge with a bit of salt, pepper, and minced garlic.  I put a bat of butter inside and wrapped them up.  Delicious - I'll definitely make these again.

My grandmother taught me this years ago.  For a spicier version, season with cayenne pepper.  I wrap individual wedges in foil.  The moisture content cooks the cabbage.  If you aren't up to lighting the grill, this works very well in a 450 degree oven...tightly covered heavy pan-no foil.

I have made this dish several times both as is and now with some minor modifications.  It's the absolute best way to make cabbage!  I use about 1-2 cloves minced garlic and instead of seasoning salt, I use kosher salt (to taste).  Instead of a metal baking dish, I double wrap the wedges in aluminum foil, and cook on the grill for 30 minutes.

This is fantastic.  I used a pat of butter, a little seasoned salt & pepper.  Wrapped in foil & stuck it on the grill. It was sooooo yummy.

For a full meal.. brown some ground beef & spicy sausage, drain & put in the foil packets with the cabbage.  For St Patty's day we did this with corned beef also!  EASY great dinner!

O.K.  If you are looking to impress some friends.  Show up for their cook-out with these prewrapped in individual foil and put them on the grill away from the direct heat and watch the fun as the guest open their little packet of goodness.  I have cooked this recipe many times.  The only thing I add is a sliced onion as a last step.

What a great way to eat cabbage! I love what the grilling does to the flavor of the cabbage. In order to cut some calories and fat, I use I Can't Believe it's Not Butter instead of real butter.

Came out great! I made mine into individual packets for easy serving. Go heavy on the salt, and easy on the pepper though. Cabbage needs a good bit of salt, but a lot of black pepper is not so tasty on it. Thanks for the recipe!

I love cabbage and I loved it grilled. This is a really good and easy recipe. I did as some of the other reviews suggested and added a little cayenne pepper and wrapped the cabbage wedges in foil and just throw them on the grill. They worked at perfectly... the only thing I'd do differently is I'd use a little less butter and cook for slightly longer.

This was great I never had cabbage like this before. The only thing I did different was I shredded the cabbage and added a couple of slices of bacon.

I did this on my george foreman (being an apartment with no outside access dweller).

I then added it to my kelbasa, onions, and egg pasta. Stuck all in crockpot and I think the grilled versus sauted cabbage made a nice difference than usual.

Pretty darn good.  Not earth shattering, but worth trying a second time for sure.  I had 2 little cabbages; one I quartered and one I cut in eights.  I I should have quartered them both.

This was awesome.  I didn't make it on the grill but in my oven and it still rocked!!!  I convection roasted it at 400 degrees for 35 minutes.  It needed at least 15 more minutes as it was still quite crunchy.  However, the flavor was great.  I also didn't use seasoned salt I just used regular kosher salt.

Easy, easy to plan and take camping too.  I've made this lots of times and now I've simplified it to slicing up cabbage into foil packets (the thinner the quicker to cook), drizzling olive oil and a sprinkle of seasoning and then sealing it up.

Good recipe! I wrapped my wedges in aluminum foil I sprayed with cooking spray and sprinkled them with salt, pepper and garlic powder (topped with the dab of butter). Perfect with some salty smoked sausages we grilled.

I wrapped each individual wedge in aluminum foil and grilled.  I also used nonfat butter flavored spread, making this fat free.  I had no idea that cabbage could be that delicious!

Amazing!! I had some cabbage that needed to be used and it was way too hot to cook inside, this was a great way to cook cabbage!  Will be doing this again!  I individually wrapped the pieces in foil on indirect heat and didn't turn them.  So tasty!

Grilled cabbage is awesome. Whether you use a pan or foil don't forget to put in directly on the grill just before it's done for that great charred flavor.

We haven't dusted the BBQ off yet this spring so I took the advice from another review and made each piece in a tin foil packet and baked at 425 for about 30 minutes. Turned out really well and was surprising delicious! I'll definitely make again.

Amazing, never thought of grilling cabbage but everything else for dinner was going on the grill so I figured, why not.  It came out delicious.  I have told my friends about it and they are all giving it a try.  Followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect.

It turned out awesome!  I cut cabbage wedges, used a tad of margarine, minced garlic, and red onion circles and wrapped it all in foil.  Cooked on grill 25 minutes and added salt and pepper to taste before serving. Turned out wonderful

Have made a similar recipe in the oven and lost it.  Searched for this, and will def try it on the grill.  I added real bacon bits to mine and it does take longer to cook unless you really like it crunchy as we don't, so will adjust according. Baked it in the oven at 424 for 40 mins.   Good eating tho!

I usually fry bacon and add the cabbage with similar ingredients and this was far easier.  I cooked it 10 mins longer then recommended, because my mom has no teeth.  She loved it!!!

Kind of bland. I did it in foil packets in the oven.

i think i was hoping for more of a smokey note but bf said wrapping the cabbage in foil is what prevented the penetration.. didn't use the metal baking dish/water.. i just wrapped everything up.. subbed margarine for butter but followed the rest of the recipe.. not sure if i'd give this another try
