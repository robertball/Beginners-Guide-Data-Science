I love the idea of this cookie and have made it a few times now.  I think it is 5 star-worthy with the following revisions:   I use 3 cups of flour, 1 1/2 cups brown sugar, 1 8oz. can of pineapple WITH all of the juice, 1 1/2 cups white choc chips, 1 1/2 cups macadamia nuts, 5 drops candy oil, the oil is a MUST!  Everything else stays the same, use a small ice cream scoop and fill them generously, bake for 16-18 mins.  SO GOOD!

This was a good cookie recipe idea! I made the cookies as per the recipe. If the cookies are to be the size of a golfball it makes about 6-7 dozen. Also the baking time of 15-20 minutes seemed a little excessive. If the cookies are made the size of a golf ball and baked 20 minutes they were too overdone for our tastes. We baked at 325 in a convection oven in our bakery for 12 minutes. They were moist at this temperature and time. The flavor was good with the addition of the candy oil.

My Mother made these cookies for a Hawaiian theme party and everyone raved about them.  These cookies are moist and delicious and really make you think of the tropics.

These cookies are awesome!  They are a perfect summertime party cookie.  Lots of fun things in the cookie which goes over great with the adults!  I made them for a hawaian party and they were a big hit!  I reduced the sugar in half and they were perfectly sweet.
I omitted the pina colada oil because I did not have any.  I can't wait to make them with the oil.  I just ordered some from. Here is where you can find it.

Overall, they were pretty good, but a little bland. I dusted them with powdered sugar once they were cooled and that sweetened them up just enough. Very  nice!

These cookies tasted GREAT!!! I didn't have parchment paper though & had a hard time trying to figure out to grease or not to grease the cookie sheet & how long to bake & WHY did they spread out so much??? Hubby hates coconut but he wouldn't stop eating the underdone ones....WORTH TRYING AGAIN!!! (Next time I'll use the parchment).

Kind of lacking an overall sweetness, and are very cake like with not that much crunch. A little vanilla and coconut rum icing drizzled on top maybe, and less flour and more egg in the cookie.

Well received by the party I took them to.  I however prefer a chewy or crispy cookie, this one is definitely cake-like.  A little bland looking when complete also.  I drizzle some Wilton White Candy Melt over top to dress them up.

Since I didn't have the pina colada oil, I substituted 1/2 teaspoon of coconut extract. And I didn't have any parchment on hand so I used my sil pats which worked really well. Slightly crispy on the edges and chewy goodness on the inside!

these cookies are phenominal !!!!!! but this recipe makes a TON. i suggest doing 1/2 or 1/4 of the recipe because these cookies are best if you ea them within the first few days. they lose moisture as the days pass and with the full recipe i was eating on those cookies for WEEKS- even after giving some away.

I only made half of this recipe in case I didn't like it -- should have made it all!  The cookies came out great., not cake-like, but very chewy.  Cant wait to share them with others.  FYI -- the recipe calls for baking soda, but the directions said baking powder.

I made these over the weekend.  I didn't have the pina colada oil, but I did have butter rum so I used that.  I didn't have rum extract so I used vanilla and I only had 1 bag of chips.  1 bag seemed plenty.  The cookies were very good, but I will get the pina colada oil and rum extract if I make them again.
