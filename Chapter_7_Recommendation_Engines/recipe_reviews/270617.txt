I may not make this again. I found the puff pastry difficult to manipulate.  If I do try again i will probably use regular lie crust.

Made as directed, but only had 9 oz of chicken and frozen peas & carrots, so used an 8x8 pan, cooked for 35 minutes.  Next time, I'll omit the bottom crust. Great comfort food for a blizzard day.

This was delicious! I had some leftover chicken and only one pastry sheet, so I made a half portion in a smaller casserole dish. I added mushrooms and a splash of cooking wine, and exchanged the onion with asafetida powder to make it low FODMAP. Mine cooked only about 20 minutes before I was afraid it’d burn - I’m not sure if that was because of my smaller, different dish. Turned out great!!!
