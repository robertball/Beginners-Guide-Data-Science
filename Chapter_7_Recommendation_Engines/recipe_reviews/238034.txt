This is quick, easy and good. I agree with Chef John that a simple base like this is the best for strawberry ice cream. If you want a pretty color this is the way to get it. But I think I will add part pureed berries next time and then some berry chunks after churning and before freezing. Steps 3 and 4 are a repeat basically and I omitted one of them. Also, I added some of the cream into the blender with my berries and sugar...because it wouldn't blend without it. I also cut up the berries before putting in blender.

This is the best strawberry ice cream I have ever had!
I love the simple, real ingredients used in this recipe.
I didn't add any food coloring so that I could keep this completely natural. I used fresh, raw cream and whole, raw milk from my local dairy, organic strawberries, and a pinch of Himalayan pink salt. 
My ten year old has never liked strawberry ice cream, but he can't stop eating this. The smooth and creamy texture and light, sweet taste just make this delicious.

I found the flavor to be a bit lacking. I made this as a treat for my husband who requested Strawberry Ice Cream as our flavor of the week and we both thought it was "just okay."  It's missing something for sure. In my opinion, it wasn't sweet enough and didn't taste enough like the real deal. Perhaps adding strawberry extract will help or even adding more strawberries and sugar. If you are used to starting your home made ice cream with the egg custard, you may be disappointed a little with the taste of this one. This one needs tweaking a bit.

Awesome!  The fresh flavor of the strawberries shines brightly in this ice cream.  Out of habit, I keep all the containers to be used in the freezer until I’m ready to fill, and the blender jar in the fridge to keep all the ingredients cold. I didn't bother with any food coloring. Definitely worth making!

It's really important to use fresh, sweet strawberries with this recipe. I make strawberry ice cream every year when our local strawberries come in season -- and I'm happy I chose this recipe this year because it's a keeper! I did mix up the dairy because that's what I had on hand - I used 2 cups of half and half and 1 cup of heavy cream. Delicious! And very, very simple to make.

This was my first try at an eggless ice cream, and all I can say is WOW ! Very creamy, not too sweet and a taste of summer in the middle of a long winter.  I cannot wait to try this with the fresh berries from my garden.  Hubby loved it and I am making it again today.  hanks Chef John.

This recipe is pretty good except I agree with a previous reviewer that it could have used a little more sugar. When you make this ice cream be sure to evaluate the sweetness of the fruit you are using. Maybe my berries were not as sweet as they could have been. Before freezing I thought it could use more sweetness but held back thinking my judgement was off. When it was all finished/frozen I sampled the finished product... bummer, it still needed sugar. You are the best judge of what it will need.

We thoroughly enjoyed this ice cream. I forgot the vanilla but will make sure it's added in next time.  Very, very good. Next time I may substitute some milk for half the heavy cream and see what happens.  Makes a really nice strawberry milkshake!

AWESOME. The only thing I did different was I put aside about 1/4 of the strawberries mixed with sugar, and cut them into smaller pieces, then added them to the ice cream about 5 minutes before it was finished i(n my Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker). I won't do that next time though, because the chunks of stawberries froze like another reviewer stated. My fault, so from now on I will make this as written. Otherwise,  very smooth, creamy and absolutely delicious even though I am not a big fan of strawberry ice cream. I usually make ice cream with a custard base,  so this was a first for me. I am not  disappointed. Hubby loved the creamy flavor and requested I make this more often. Thanks Chef John!

This was fun! I've never made Strawberry Ice Cream before and this turned out wonderful. Used fresh strawberries and used food processor to puree.
Glad I choose this recipe. Thank you.

I made this recipe using very ripe strawberries. I did not add food coloring. Instead of cream and milk, I used all half and half.  It was delicious and I will be making this one again.  Another good Chef John recipe.

We thought this was a perfect strawberry recipe.  We blended everything together in our blender (cream, sugar, milk strawberries, vanilla) and then froze in our ice cream mixer.  Super easy and so yummy!

Nice flavor and what real strawberry ice cream should taste like. I'm so used to store-bought ice cream with artificial flavor that I often like to get back to how it's really supposed to taste. I dropped score by one star, though, because there's no gelatin to keep this ice cream from hardening like a rock. I always dissolve a packet of unflavored gelatin in warm milk/cream and blend into the mixture to improve scoopability without affecting the flavor.

Do it just like he says, and it’ll be perfect every time. Be sure to take it out of the freezer 10-15 minutes before serving, and it’ll be nice and creamy.

This was not only my first time making strawberry ice cream, but also the first time making ice cream without a custard base...it turned out great! Tastes like fresh strawberries instead of strawberry extract that some store ice creams taste like. The texture was good, and I even got a "You made this??" from the hubbie. I made this for my mom who loves strawberry ice cream and she enjoyed it. Adjust the sugar to the sweetness/tartness of your berries, I wanted a tad more sugar because our berries were tart, but it was for mom and she said it was good the way it was. Thank you Chef John, your recipes never disappoint.
...did I mention my kids LOVED this?...But that's no shocker, is it.

It's strawberry season right now here in NC. I used 3 cups of strawberries and followed the rest of the recipe.   It turned out perfect. Right consistency too. I like tihat no eggs were used. Very creamy and berry tasting. Next time I double the ingredients because it only makes a quart.

Mine turned out well, nice fresh strawberry flavor, but not sweet as reviewers noted. Another 1/4 cup of sugar would probably fix it.

I did make some changes. I used 1 cup of cream and 2 cups of half-and-half, because that's what I had on hand. I figured that was about the same butterfat content as the original recipe. I used 16 oz (1 pound) of organic strawberries instead of 12 oz because that's how many came in the package I bought. I also doubled the vanilla to 2 tbsp. And I added 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips that I chopped up in a garlic chopper.

Perhaps the best classic example of "simple is best."  The color without food color was a vibrant pink and the flavor was stellar. The key appears to be freshness. The bright and firm berries of early summer make for delicious ice cream.

I plan to experiment with the fresh blackberries we have and perhaps add a recipe of my own to this category.

Heavenly!  Best ice cream I've ever eaten, verified by my grandchildren.  Didn't think they would even notice, I thought ice cream is ice cream to them....you should have seen their faces on the first taste.  Didn't change a thing.  Think I may need to pick more berries for the 18 quarts I picked the other day to last through the winter!

No. It is high calorie and just wonderful. the way ice-cream used to be. We have a friend who loves strawberry ice cream and is disappointed how rare it is these days. He loved it.

I had a 6 quart ice cream freezer, so I tripled the recipe.  The ice cream turned out fantastic!  This is the first time I have made an ice cream without eggs, and truly, this strawberry ice cream is delicious,  We made it for the 4th of July neighborhood fireworks show,  Everyone loved it.  Thanks, Chef John.

This is a very good recipe. I have a similar recipe I use for vanilla ice cream. I had home grown strawberries and used half-half for a richer flavor In place of the milk.  I omitted the food color. It is a very pretty pink! I do like the idea of adding strawberry pieces after churning. I will try that next time!

Made no changes except did not add food coloring - My husband is not a great fan of  ice cream but when he tasted this he hit the ceiling!  Had a great big bowl!  Always watching his calorie intake but didn't watch it this time.  Wants me to make it again and again.

This is an amazing and creamy recipe!  Absolutely adjust your sugar on the sweetness of the fruit. That's just common cooking sense. My berries were ripe and sweet and followed recipe as is, except I always double vanilla in all recipes. No food coloring and it was still a gorgeous pink. Will make again and try different berries!  Used my kitchen aid mixer with the ice cream churn attachment.

I made this for dessert for a 4th of July party.  We all thought it was good but not worthy of 5 stars.  It could have been the strawberries that I used.  They looked really pretty but didn't have much flavor.  I did add 1/4 cup additional sugar and I used Mexican vanilla but otherwise followed the recipe. The texture of the ice cream was really nice.

Used 600ml double cream and a cup of low fat milk.  Added the juice of a lemon to the strawberry mixture, ended up with so much that I had to split it in half and churn it in order to fit in the 1.5L container.  Also added some chunky strawberries.  Yummy.

Wow, great ice cream base. I cut the recipe in half but used a tad less sugar--1/3 cup of sugar, extra rich vanilla extract, a little more strawberries--8 ounces of strawberries. It is absolutely delicious. I can't wait to make it again with different fruits. Very easy recipe.

Amazing! We tried some of the batter before we put it into the ice cream maker and it was already scrumptious. We couldn't even let it sit in the freezer after churning because it was so delicious! This will be a staple in our house.

I made this for my grandmother who loves strawberry ice cream. It was for her 95th bday. I used extra strawberries that I sprinkled with about a tsp of sugar and let them sit a little before using. Once blended, I placed the mixture in the fridge overnight so that it would be extra cold when I put it into the frozen bowl for churning. 
This ice cream came out nice and creamy and fluffy. The flavor was awesome! I have a sensitivity to fresh strawberries, I could only taste it in small amounts and I loved it. I like that the recipe does not use eggs as a base, I made French vanilla that way as my first ice cream and though it tasted good, I prefer not to mess with the raw eggs if I can avoid it. 
This recipe is easy and delicious and my wonderful grandma loved it! She said her great grandson liked it too because it does not have the large chunks of strawberry like her store bought version, he picks those out. She said she loves strawberry regardless. 
Will definitely make this again or use as the base for other flavors.

This is a great recipe, simple pure ingredients. I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup and to me it was perfect because the strawberries were so sweet. No need to add food coloring the strawberries add enough color. I will always use this recipe I just need a good ice cream maker, mine is so wonky.

This was a really good, simple recipe. I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and didn't use the red food coloring  as it's not really needed. Otherwise--quite good and easy! It does make A LOT of ice cream, so you made need a couple of containers to store it.

Tried this about a year ago. I was amazed at how good it tasted as well as how easy. I figured it would probably work with any berries. I just made it  using blueberries instead of strawberries. It definately works with other berries.

This was my first time making ice cream in an electric ice cream machine.  I didn’t think it would be much different than a manual machine, but wow.  The strawberry ice cream was absolutely delicious.  Simple ingredients, it came together easily.  Following the machine directions and Chef Johns recipe this was perfect.  It was creamy and not overly sweet.  I’m looking forward to making it again.

This is an excellent recipe.  I did however tweak it a bit.  I used fat free half and half and a small box of Jello instant pudding to reduce the calories/fat and still retain the consistency.  It turned out to be the hit of our dinner party.

Thanks Chef John !  What a delightful easy recipe.  I used 2 cups whole milk and 1 cup of cream as that is what I had on hand. Delicious.

Easy and quick. Made more than my 1.5 qt machine could churn. Directions 3&4 are confusing.  It was good but not sure I’ll make again.

Super easy. Flavor is very berry. I skipped the vanilla which let strawberry be the star. Of course, the better your berries, the better the flavor.

I used frozen strawberries and tossed them with the sugar until the strawberries were somewhat defrosted before putting into the blender. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as directed and we we were all pleased with the results. I would make this again.

Great ice cream, and easy to make.  However, there was some concern that it wasn't going to fit in the ice cream maker even though it was the same one in the video.

I didn't make any changes except for not putting the cream in the blender. Mixed it in so it doesn't turn to butter. I thought it was flat. Did need more sugar.  I wouldn't make it again as the recipe with my ice cream maker was better.

This recipe is very close to the "Philadelphia style" ice cream that I prefer. I am not a fan of eggy flavored ice creams, so I use my basic and then add any of my favorite summer fruits.

very 1 dimensional. I think that the complexity of the egg custard base compliments the strawberries.

Love the texture, but it needs to be a little more sweet. I'll make it again, but I'll probably add a little more sugar (or some honey?) and a few more berries.

My first time making this fruit ice cream.  I used frozen mixed berries instead.  The flavor is really good. But I think I'll try half-n-half instead of milk to make it creamier.

I was going for a more keto version so I added swerve instead of sugar at half of the amount. Also increased the cream to 2 1/2 cups and reduced milk to 1/2 cup.

This was okay ice cream, but tasted bland.  I have another recipe that uses about this amount of strawberries, but less cream and milk, and it is much better.

This is basically the same recipe I used for years.  But, now I change the cream to 1 cup, milk to 2 cups and add a box of instant vanilla pudding mix.  Try it, you will like it.   I also cut the sugar back to 1/3 to 1/2 cup.   Works great with the chocolate pudding mix or any other flavor.

Very good!  This makes about 2 quarts. Don't overfill the ice cream maker. I diced some strawberries and added it in the last 5 minutes of churning.

Yum! The only change I made to the recipe was to alter  the amount of sugar from 3/4 cup to 1 cup. After tasting the strawberries I was using they were not as sweet as I hoped. The ice cream came out perfectly. My advise is to taste a strawberry before mixing the ingredients to test for sweetness.  This frozen confection is creamy and tastes like a mouthful of summer.

I followed this recipe exactly as written.  Steps 3 and 4 are repeated so I just put the blended mixture into my ice cream maker.  It was good creamy ice cream and we liked it..  However, it id not have much strawberry flavor to it.  But it wasn't bad.  I'll probably make this again for the ease of the recipe.  But I will add my homemade strawberry topping to top it off.
