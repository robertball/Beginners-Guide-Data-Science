These were great--nicely sweetend and chocolatey. The pancakes are fluffy, light and cake-like. My daughter put whipped cream, chocolate syrup and a cherry on top. She liked them a lot.

I made these but they are not sweet enough as written.  I doubled the sugar then added a little more before these approached a browniesque experience.  I topped them with grass-fed butter and homemade chocolate syrup - cocoa powder, maple syrup and vanilla extract to taste.  After tinkering with the recipe me and my daughter enjoyed them.  I look forward to trying them again with chocolate chips for total chocolate insanity.  Note - I did use coconut palm sugar instead of white or brown.  I sub it in all of my baked goods as it enhances the flavor.
