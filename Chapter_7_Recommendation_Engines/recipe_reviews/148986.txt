I really liked this recipe, although I changed a few things around. I did not have broth so I just used water to cook the rice. I used olive oil instead of butter, did not use an onion but used some onion powder, also used powdered ginger instead of fresh.  I used all the other spices as written and really liked the flavor of this rice.  I also used about 1/2 cup of celery and 1/2 cup of raisins.  Both of my toddlers liked this recipe too, which is quite an accomplishment since they are really picky.  I will make this again and next time use broth and fresh ginger.  If you are out of those ingredients it still tastes fine without.

We thought this was very good and will definitely make again, with these improvements. A whole onion and much more celery, increase the spice to 1 tsp., Don't overcook it. When you add the spices, you're just toasting to bring out the flavor, the longer you cook after adding the spices, the more flavor you lose. 
Next time we will also increase the amount of soy sauce and raisins-we love raisins. They add a nice touch of sweetness.
Very tasty dish, am looking forward to next time.

This was sooo good!! I added whole cardamom pods to the rice water, a bunch more vegetables including carrot and red onion, and used currants instead of raisins. It was phenomenal!! Thank you for this recipe!

This was very good. I followed the recipe exactly, except I only had regular soy sauce. I put 1 tbsp of regular soy sauce and I thought it was a little over powering. Next time, I think I'm going to double the ginger (I love ginger!), add more veggies (I'm thinking carrots and red bell peppers), and reduce the soy sauce to 2 teaspoons. Raisins really added nice flavor to this dish. Thank you for the recipe!

This was very good.  I used leftover rice that had been cooked with water rather than broth and it still tasted great.  I had to add a little salt.

Very yummy.A definite keeper. The only change I made was to use vegetable broth instead of chicken because it was what I had in the house. I will probably leave out the celery the next time I make it, but that's just a matter of personal taste.

By the time I was done with this recipe, my boyfriend didn't even mind that I was cooking with brown rice :) When I didn't have celery, but wanted crunchy - I tried walnuts, and it was just as good.

This dish made a pretty good side but I did tweak it just a little a other reviewers had recommended.  My husband did say it was a keeper though.

Delicious spice mixture! I made this with instant brown rice, as I didn't have regular & didn't want to use white rice; worked fine. Omitted celery, since none to hand; soy sauce is optional, since also salty chicken broth in ingredients (I left it out, tasted fine). The raisins get very juicy, and contrast beautifully with the spices.

Yum,yum,yum!  I was a lttle hesitant about the raisins.  My husband came in while I was about to add them to the skillet and made a doubtful face.  But wow.  This was the best part of the dinner.  I had planned to make it exactly like the recipe, but it smelled so good while cooking the vegies I couldn't wait to taste it.  I completely forgot about the soy sauce and added a bit of salt and some pepper flakes instead.  My husband and I both agree this is a keeper!

I made this for company and they said the raisins made them a little nervous but after trying it decided it was really good!  I used beef broth instead of chicken as it was all I had on hand and I think I would do it that way again!

Excellant! Was delish! Would never have thought these would combine so well.  I was a little suspicious of my coriander (think it is a little outdated) and will try it next time when I'm sure it is fresher. - BEST PART - you can make the rice ahead of time - reheat, cook and add the other ingredients before going to the table. I love the sweet and savoury aspect of this dish. Thank you Mtreeesor!

We enjoyed this brown rice recipe as our main dish.  I would say it serves 4 if it is the main entree.  I omitted the butter in cooking the rice as we are trying to eat healthy and plant based.  I added more celery as other reviewers recommended.  It was a tasty dish along with our favorite kale salad.  Hint for fresh ginger.  Mine usually goes bad before I get around to using it until I decided to freeze it.  Peel the fresh ginger, and cut into chunks about 1-1/2 to 2 inches long and freeze in a plastic bag.  When you need it, take it out frozen and use your microplaner to shred it....so easy.  Make a larger pile than you might think, as it melts down as it thaws.  This way I always have ginger on hand and ready to use.

A big hit at my book club! I substituted pistachios for walnuts (didn't use celery), and used golden raisins (1/2 c). Everything else the same. Try the pistachios - delicious and good color.

I thought it was pretty good. The raisins were nice and tender but my rice turned out to be a little mushy, which I don't like. Nothing that a quick toss in the oven won't fix though.

I used half a teaspoon of cumin instead of a whole one, partially because I'm so familiar with cumin in Mexican dishes that I can pick it out of any dish, plus I think it would over power it. I also threw in some chopped walnuts in there and it was awesome.

Used oil instead of butter and water instead of broth, but it still turned out great. I really dig the celery taste in the mix (cut into about 1cm chunks) - who would of thought.

I did follow this recipe as written, but for all the spices and ingredients added, i thought it would have had more WOW to the taste. It definitely wasn't bad; better than PLAIN brown rice for sure- but not different or interesting enough to make again.

Loved it!  I will definitely do this again.  I think it needs way more raisins though, which I added to add in the "sweet" factor.  Also, when cooking the items you are to mix in, be careful not to overcook.

This dish was very tasty. I used a little less cumin and coriander because I thought  it sounded like a lot. I served it with a roasted chicken and gravy, and broccoli. I saved this to my recipe box and will make it again.

The best rice dish I've ever had ! Like another reviewer suggested I used walnuts instead of celery. I also used Grapeseed Oil instead of olive oil. I also left butter out. This will be in my starting rotation for sure.

I read a negative review (the only one I saw) of this recipe that began "I didn't follow the recipe exactly and then continued on to express disappointment.  Gee, wonder why?  

I was looking for something to pair with grilled pork chops, and I didn't want to do apples, because they're just too obvious.  This is the perfect blend of savory and sweet, and worked beautifully! I'd suggest something nutty -- maybe some pistachios or almonds... I actually topped it with sesame seeds, and that was good.

Still haven't quite found the brown rice recipe I can "love". Even cooking it for 50 minutes, it's still too aldante for me. Although, the flavors were really nice with the raisins.

This was fantastic! I accidentally left out the bay leaf but it turned out excellent anyway. The raisins were a very nice touch, they made this dish so much more sophisticated :) I also mixed in 1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts just before serving, for extra crunch. One suggestion: if you use water and a bouillon cube instead of the suggested chicken broth, don't add the whole cube unless you like your rice very salty.

This rice went great with my Asian-themed dinner. I omitted the coriander because I didn't have any of it and I also used my rice cooker instead of a saucepan. I cooked my rice (1 1/2 cups) with water and left out the butter and bay leaf. I added a few walnuts to the rice and I substituted soy sauce for teriyaki sauce. My siblings did not like this rice because of the onions, but I thought it was tasty and flavorful.

I've made this recipe MANY times and we just LOVE it.  Don't omit the pepper from this recipe, it adds a special kick to it.  I've also exchanged dried currants for the raisins which is equally as good.  This is a great way to dress up brown rice and it goes with virtually anything.

Great taste and simple preperation. The raisins caught my co-worker off gaurd as he eats like a 3 yr old but he pushed through and found it quite enjoyable. There is a good balance of sweetness and the celery is a delightful crunch. This rice will see its way to my Fire House dinner table often

This was great and really easy. I didn't have all the spices and it still turned out good.

We loved this rice recipe and don't think I'll make rice any other way. I may try adding a half cup rice next time and call it a meal. Thanks!!!!!

I rinse my brown rice first so I decreased the broth to a little more than 1 1/2 cups. Otherwise made exactly to recipe.  A nice change with ingredients on hand.

We really liked this dish.  I used ginger powder since I didn't have ginger but think it would be better with real ginger.

Made as written for one exception. I had no raisins. thought I'd substitute dried cranberries & out of them too. I then finely chopped a sweet baking apple (I used Honeycrisp) and added it at the end. If you taste this dish right away don't be tempted to taste for seasoning. The spices need time to blend and it will taste under spiced. Luckily I made it early, planning to reheat it for dinner . It seemed bland but decided I'd wait until then I reheated it to adjust the seasoning. Glad I did as by then the spices had permeated the dish nicely.  A very nice dish with good flavor and texture.

Increased the ginger ; used light and dark raisins.  Will add pecans next time.  The heat of the ginger is a nice contrast to the sweetness of the raisins.   Very good.

Heed the advice of other reviewers and make sure you don't overcook the rice. I did and it got mushy. We enjoyed the amount of spices and other ingredients as written, but then I had added chicken and hot peppers so it was perfectly balanced. Thank you for the recipe.

This was tasty and a nice change from regular rice. I wasn't crazy over the spice combo, hence the four stars rather than five.

Deliciously sweet way to prepare rice. I served with the teriyaki rib eye recipe from this site and they complemented each other very well. I'm not a big fan of cumin, so I used curry instead. Perfect dish.

I love this.  I use chicken broth instead of boullon and add leftover meat after the rice has cooked to make it a main dish.
