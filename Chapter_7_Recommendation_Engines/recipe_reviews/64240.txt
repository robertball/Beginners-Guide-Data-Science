The step for frying these "fries" is totally unnecessary. They can be BAKED on a noninsulated cookie sheet, lined with parchment paper. Brush will olive oil and bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes. Turn over brush wil olive oil again and bake for another 10 minutes. Serve with marinara sauce!! This cuts calories considerably!!!

I gave 5 stars for the idea because we loved them so much!!! but i read the reviews and really changed up a bit, because i can't ever just follow directions ;)  Made plain grits w/ just water, for breakfast one day, but made extra.  After everyone had taken theirs, i stirred italian seasoning and lots of parmesan into the leftovers, then spread it onto a (clean) styrofoam meat tray to chill.  Several days later i just cut into home-fry-sized pieces and baked at 450 on my baking stone.  We had an emergency so i forgot and probably left them in 25-30 minutes, but they were great! really really crispy on the outside, tender inside!  yum!

First of all, this makes ALOT! They are so good. I halved the recipe and substituted dried Italian seasoning for parsley. I also used olive oil instead of veg. oil. My husband was amazed they tasted so good. Will definitely keep the recipe on hand.

I had a tube of polenta sitting in the cupboard that has been crying out for a new recipe.   I sliced it into strip (approx 1/2" wide), then brushed with olive oil and sprinkled with salt, pepper, parmesan & chopped parsley.   I used the oven method, but it took way longer than 10 minutes per side.   I left them in the oven for approx 60-70 minutes, they were just starting to brown but were nice and soft in the middle.  They were great on their own, but now I'm on the lookout for the perfect dipping sauce.

As this recipe stands...it is bland.  I added some italian seasonings and a little more cheese to help with that. Hubby said that they were just ok.  I figured out that we just aren't big polenta fans.  Thanks anyway for the post.

I used a roll of seasoned ready made polenta and cut it into fries per a past suggestions and baked them in the oven.  It took about 45 - 60 minutes and I upped the heat to 400 degrees to crisp them up.  They were good with marinara dip.  A little different texture than I expected, but would make again.

This was the first time I have had polenta.  My husband and I found it to be very bland.  I grilled the sticks after they set up rather than deep frying.  I am sure deep frying would have added flavor, but I was concerned about the fat.

I liked these, though I didn't follow the recipe exactly, and used it more for inspiration than anything else. I used a tube of store-bought, prep-prepared seasoned polenta, and just sliced into fry shapes then baked in my countertop oven for about 20 minutes at 400. A nice change of pace, but it got mixed reviews - three adults liked it, but the fourth thought it was just so-so. If I make this again I'll definitely add additional seasonings, such as salt, pepper, and perhaps chili powder to them.

I found this recipe yesterday and had a roll of polenta in the pantry and tried this for supper.  I was very disappointed.  They never did crisp up and were very bland. I really wanted to like this.

I used store bought polenta and sliced and then cut into sticks and deep fried them. They are okay. Don't fry in big batches because they stick together. They're not greasy if you drain them on several paper towels. Probably won't use this receipe again.

I didn't substitute or add anything and these were still very good. Next time I'll add a little bit of water because they seemed to crumble a bit (this was at 2 servings).

Add generous amount of Mexican cheese, and chopped green chilies while still soft. After frying top with chunky chili. Your men-folk will eat until they're stupid.

Very good, I added onion and used asiago cheese, as that is what I had.  I think next time will cut down on the amount of polenta used to see if they become softer in the center of the fry,  Thank you for the recipe

Made this with store-bought polenta and oven baked them like I would regular french fries. It was really good, though more chewy than crispy. A bit too chewy for my two-and-a-half year old, but my four-year old loved them. Couldn't give them to the baby as a finger food like I had been hoping. I'd make it again only if I had some store-bought polenta kicking around, which I don't usually. I don't think I'd make homemade for this, but then that might make it better!

Perfect consistency for deep frying.  Nice a crisp on the outside yet creamy on the inside.  The only thing I did different was add a fine garlic powder to the mix.   I made a home made marinara dip to go with them.  Thank you for sharing!

Very good, I received an air fryer for my birthday and was trying the new air fryer out, these came out very good. I think reheating any leftovers, I would do in the air fryer as well.
