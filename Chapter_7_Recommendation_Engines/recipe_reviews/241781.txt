I thought this was ok as is, but could be easily enhanced with other ingredients. I microwaved my bacon for a few minutes first before wrapping and broiling in the oven. I used parchment paper as suggested, but it started browning and smoking so I had to pull it out. Use foil instead. I used a greek feta, which I found too strong if the chunks were too big. I dipped a few in maple syrup, which was not bad, and a few I ate with a wedge of tomato. Pretty good.
