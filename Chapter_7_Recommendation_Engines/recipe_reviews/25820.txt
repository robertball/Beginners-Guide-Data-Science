I'll give this recipe five stars, because the resulting cookie really was delicious.  However, if you're looking at the serving size as a guideline, I didn't find it accurate.  I used balls that were definitely under a tablespoon each, and only got 5 dozen cookies.  I was skeptical when I saw the quantities of the ingredients, and it turns out I was right.  I didn't make the half moon shape, I just rolled each bit of dough into a ball and flattened them a bit.  Took 12 minutes, and ended up delicious.  Reminded me a bit of shortbread.

Simple and delicious cookie recipe.  I was looking for something to use up some vanilla beans and this worked well.  I will definitely be making these again around the holiday season to share with friends and family.

These have been a Christmas tradition at our home for years now.  Since the dough is rather sticky, I tend to refrigerate and then shape small bits into cresents rather than rolling them into ropes.  Instead of powdered sugar, we use vanilla suger so they have an extra vanilla punch

These are great!  We live in Germany and these are the best ones I have had yet.  I have the form so that was easy.  I only used one vanilla bean and used vanilla sugar after baking being that I was out of powdered sugar, oops.  These are like yummy pecan sandies, but almond.

These cookies are fantastic. I only made one change to sub coconut oil for the butter since my daughter is allergic to dairy. I did have two problems, one was the same as another reviewer in that the quantity stated is way off. I used a tablespoon measure to make sure they were all the same size. I only got 30 cookies total. The other that was when bending them they kept breaking on me and just didn't want to shape very well to they were hard to form. But the taste is great. I do think in the future I will sift on the powdered sugar instead of trying to roll the cookies in it. It should be easier and prettier.

OMG. These are tasty and easy to make. I followed the recipe but could never get half moons. They kept crumbling apart; so I'm rating a 4.
Not to worry. I rolled the dough into balls, while holding it in my hands I pinched the tops to make peaks, then gently pushed down on the base to flatten the bottoms so they could sit upright. Dusting with the confectioners/powered sugar (almost immediately out of the oven) they looked like mountain peaks with snow.
Vanilla beans being pricy where we live, I lightly used vanilla extract (1/2 tsp); possibly causing the crumble. However, going with the mountain peaks theme I would add almond extract (1/4 tsp) to enhance the nuts.
