After a few adaptations, this recipe is a keeper in my kitchen. First I added 1/2 cup sugar and 2 tsp. baking soda. For the flour, I use 3 cups wholemeal, 2 cups all-purpose and 1 cup blended oatmeal. My family and visitors love them. The last batch, I didn't mix the butter, so I can keep it in my pantry. I add approx. 1 tbsp. oil or melted butter per cup of mix with the water and egg just before cooking.

Church pancake breakfast special.  I use this recipe to make scratch pancakes to raise money for special projects.  Divide 4 cups of the dry ingredients into zip bags so you don't have to measure again. To each batch, stir in 3 c of milk and 3 eggs (add more water/milk to get the right consistency).  I don't need to know how many are coming.  The dry bag ingredients can be frozen till the next breakfast. To me, this is superior to mixes.

These were good! Because of food allergies, I substituted butter for the shortening and didn't add the egg.  Also, I added a little sugar to the mix for my sweet tooth.  I wasn't sure if the butter would work, but it was good-- they didn't need butter on top.  I used 1 1/3 cup of mix to 1 cup of water and this made 10 pancakes.  Thanks for the recipe.  Now my daughter can enjoy pancakes and the rest of us like them too!

It is nice to see a pancake mix without sugar. I am not a fan of sweet pancakes at all so I have never been happy with the "just add water" type of mix you can buy. This mix is nearly as easy. I used buttermilk powder instead of regular dry milk.

I have to admit that I am a pancake cheater...I always buy the powder in a box.  It is one of the few things that I cheat on.  This was very good.  They did turn out a bit thick.  I may take the advice of another reviewer and hand them out as jar mixes for the holidays.  Thanks for the post.

Perhaps I did something wrong.  The pancakes came out heavy and flat (not fluffy). However, the taste was wonderful.  If anyone knows of a "trick" to get them to be more light, please let me know.

Tastes fine, but since we always make them from scratch - they were just pancakes. A little to thick, could be lighter.

I didn't use shortening and replaced the dry milk with whole milk. I also added vanilla, sugar, and cinnamon and they came out wonderful. But this is a good recipe to add too.

This recipe is awsome.  I have five children plus run a daycare out of my home.  It makes breakfast for all the children easier than trying to guess on how much to make.  The kids love to make the dry mix and my husband who doesn't like pancakes that much loves these.  Even though I don't always add the egg or as much water to the dry mix they still have a great texture and taste.  They always come out fluffy.  Thank you for sharing.

This was fantastic!  I followed suit with the other reviewers and added some sugar in a ratio that I figured was about what I normally add when I make pancakes from scratch (2 Tbsp. per batch).  I am allergic to dairy so I used Darifree powdered non-dairy milk and it worked perfectly.  We brought 3 batches (bagged separately) on our trip to Disneyworld last week and it was so easy to whip up a good hot breakfast in our kitchen at the hotel.  This is going to be a great timesaver on school mornings as well since my kids like fresh pancakes better than frozen and reheated.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

This is a really great mix.  I double the batch and keep it in a plastic canister in the fridge.  My 12yo dd likes to make this up and it's easy enough for her to handle.  The pancakes are very filling but not heavy.  YUM!

I decreased the servings to 5 on this and it was a bit too salty.  Not sure if this is a problem when u make the recipe as listed.  I a hand full of sugar...I know,I'm very precise, lol. Very good recipe. Doesn't make big fluffy pancakes...which is fine by me. Will def make again!

My children loved this recipe.  I added sugar and substituted powdered buttermilk. I also keep it in a zip lock bag in the freezer. Topped with chocolate chips and it is out of this world.

We have pancakes for brunch every other Sunday after church and this is what I use adding a little fresh milk to make them finer. Also not having sugar in the ingredients allows us to top them with sugar and fresh lemon juice. Yum!

Definiatly something missing from this - my guess was sugar. I added about 2 TBL to the dry mix but didn't seem to make a difference, need to add more though. I did find that this mix is great for apple pancakes w/ cinnamon & sugar.

We liked them.  They were a little thick, and I will probably add a little sugar next time, but other than that they were great.  We did put chocolate chips in them.  I saved the mix and we'll definitely be making these again.

These pancakes were not all that tasty as far as my family was concerned.  I had tried them for possibly making a gift jars of pancake mix.  The pancakes were not fluffy and had little flavor.  I added some baking soda and some vanilla...also an extra egg.  Nothing seemed to help.  I think this recipe would be better with a lot of additions like many others have done but that totally changes it. I rated this recipe "as is" and it just didn't work for me.

As good as any bought, packaged mix I've ever used.  By the way, several have mentioned no sugar being in recipe.  Why would you add sugar to mix and then pour maple syrup over them?  HMMMM!

This was good, but I added the sugar as suggested by other reviewers.

This was a rather odd recipe. I like to make pancake mix ahead and store if not used so the shortening didn't really work for that purpose. But, as for the recipe as written, I do think that the recipe was missing approximately 2 TBS of sugar and could have used another egg. This just wasn't for us. Thanks anyway.

I really liked this recipe.  I had all of the ingredients in my pantry so I made up a batch.  Very good and easy pancakes, nice to keep some pre-made mix on hand for a quick breakfast.  I loved the freezer idea, I froze one batch and made it the next weekend.  Thanks!

the recipe is good but there is NO reason to store this in the fridge.  None of the ingredients are refrigerated to start with and mixing them together doesn't suddenly make them unstable or more likely to spoil.

Delicious! I went with half the baking powder and they didn't fluff up but they were very tasty, also added apple and cinnamon.

My kids and I really liked this mix. The only changes I made were to substitute half the all purpose flour for whole wheat and butter-flavored shortening for the regular.

This is old school. I had thoughts about the sugar not being there. These came out perfect with the syrup. The syrup is sweet enough. 
great recipe.  The shortening brings out the delicate flavors.

These are a little tasteless.  But they were also easy to up the healthy by using half whole wheat flour, butter instead of shortening, and dry buttermilk mix.  The "fast blueberry sauce" that is here on allrecipes (along with a different waffle recipe) was a great topping I would highly recommend.

I love this recipe. I always have some made up in the fridge. My husband likes it with blueberries, my son likes it with chocolate chips. A real winner.
