This was refreshing, but it needed a bit more vodka and peach schnapps.  I brewed my Lipton tea, 3 bags to 4 cups for 5 minutes.  Next time I will brew the tea stronger for this drink or brew the tea and refrigerate instead of diluting it by pouring over ice to cool down.  Overall, it was a nice refreshing drink to sip on a hot day.

I didn't have any peach schnapps, but I did have peach flavored vodka and southern style sweet tea... so I used 2 ounes of the vodka instead. I added a splash more tea to tone down the alcohol and it was perfect! Thanks for the easy tasty drink recipe!

I have been making this for about 30 years. I like fuzzy navals but the o.j kills my stomach. I dont drink much but when i do this is my drink of choice.

Great recipe! I like mine a little more sweet and peachy, so I used unsweetened tea and added an ounce each of peach schnapps and simple syrup. I used Svedka and Dekupyer Peachtree for the alcohol.
