I made this for a company lunch and they loved it!  The recipe forgets to mention that you should add the crushed pineapple to the mix.  Great with strawberries on top as garnish.

If you try to eat this salad before it sits overnight, you will be disappointed. All of the flavors separate out, and it will taste as strange as it sounds. BUT, if you let it sit overnight, it is awesome! Everything melds, and the marshmallows sort of lose their shape and make the salad very "fluffy". It is SUPER good! Even some of my vegan friends tried a bite for kicks!

This was so good. I added cherries all around the top of the bowl to add color and it looked so pretty. This was even better the next day, so think about making this the day before you serve it and let the flavors meld together in the frige. Thank you for such a good recipe. I think this will be a new tradition at our house!!

I let this sit for 22 hours before serving... as others had suggested. I garnished it with halved strawberries.  It tasted best on the berries, but not so good alone.  Not much taste for the amount of fat and sugar it has. Just a waste of calories.  I won't be making it again.

OMG!!! This salad was so refreshing - not a drop left in the bowl. The pineapple makes it taste almost tropical, and it is so light and fluffy, you'd never guess all of the ingredients. So good - evrybody wants the recipe! Thanks for posting!

I really wanted to like this salad. I thought it needed more pineapple flavor or more sugar or something...something was missing, even after it sat in the frig for 24 hours. I really wanted to like it and high hopes...maybe it is all up to 'taste'. Other reviews were good...

This is the recipe that Mom always made back in the 50s and it was called Salad Delight.  Going to make it for Christmas and garnish it with frosted grapes for color. Have always loved this salad
