I'm a Yank living in Ireland and was taught to make Colcannon by my Irish mother-in-law. The recipe would be even cheaper if you used real potatoes and mashed them yourself.  Also the type of cabbage used can make it taste differently.  We often used "green" cabbage (spring cabbage) or Savoy cabbage.  Also, if you saute the cabbage in a bit of butter in a pan, it tastes less strong.  I would also recommend putting butter and warm milk in the mashed potatoe.

This is a very good recipe, although I did change the instant masted potatoes to "real" red skinned mashed potatoes.  I've made colcannon using carrots and cabbage, but REALLY liked the taste of the broccoli and cabbage in this one.  I served this with "Feta-Stuffed Hamburgers" from this site. Thanks WM Chef for sharing your version of Colcannon

Great recipe. I used real potatoes and just mashed them because I don't like instant potatoes. Actually, I hate them lol. I also sauteed the cabbage in a little bit of butter and a pinch of garlic and added some green onion to the mashed potatoes. Turned out great. Very tasty and simple to throw together. Thanks for sharing.
