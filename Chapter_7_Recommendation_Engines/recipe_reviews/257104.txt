Such a great recipe. I caramelized the onions for about 30 minutes before browning the chicken for a richer flavor, added half the honey, and used parsley instead of cilantro. A major crowd-pleaser!

Absolutely delicious! Family loved it! Made it twice. I didnâ€™t have cilantro. It was the only ingredient missing. Will make it again!

I used a jar of Salsa instead of the Chicken Broth.  Everyone loved the flavor.  Made one day and served reheated the next day for a crowd!  Highly recommend.  Unique and delicious!
