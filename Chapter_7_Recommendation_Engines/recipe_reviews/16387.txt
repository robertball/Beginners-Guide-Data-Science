This is a very impressive cake. It is rich and decadent. I used a chopstick to poke the holes instead of a fork.

best cake i ever made!  will definitely make again, especially for parties or special occasions.  used Creme de Peache, orange zest and orange marmalade.  Maybe I overbeat it, but there was SO much batter the cake almost over-ran the pan.  You MUST serve this cake warm or re-warmed...  SO scrumptious!!  I was tempted to over-decorate with chopped nuts or powdered sugar, but when you see the serving and how understated it is, it only adds to the spectacular surprise taste and texture.  Definitely reserve some syrup and glaze to serve on the side (warmed).

One of the best pound cakes I've tried. I always use more brandy in the batter than what is called for and I use a pineapple-apricot preserves in the glaze. Stays moist a long time. Takes a little time and effort but it is well worth it.
