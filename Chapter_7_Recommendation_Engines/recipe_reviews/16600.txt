This makes a good cheeseball, but not the greatest one I've ever had; average flavor, nothing to write home about! If you make it, I recommend you scale the recipe down.  I ended up for 3 large (could have been 4 medium) sized cheeseballs, and unless you're entertaining an army, you don't need that much!!  Even though I had softened my cream cheese, the mixture really taxed my food processor.  And the pecan and parsley mixture didn't adhere to the frozen cheeseballs, so I had to bring them back to room temperature.

I just served this at my mom-in-law's surprise 50th b-day party and it was a hit. I ommitted the nuts and parsley and instead shaped them into an apple (rolled in paprika), pear (rolled in parmesan dyed green) and orange (rolled in parmesan dyed yellow). I used whole cloves for stems (sticking out for apple and pear and in for the orange).  They were so cute! And they were quite easy to make, it took a bit to get the mixture to combine in the food processor but I think that my cream cheese wasn't soft enough.

Quick and easy. Using the freezer to firm the cheese ball is a great idea. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out delicious. I recommend scaling it to 8 servings to get the perfect size cheese ball for a small party. You may want to play with the different brands of hot pepper sauce available.

I cut this recipe by 1/3 to make one cheeseball, using 1 package of cream cheese.  (Scale the recipe to 4 servings to do this....although one cheeseball should be way more than only 4 servings!).  This is a really good cheeseball.  Like another reviewer, I added a squeeze of mustard (spicy brown).  It was very easy to make too, and I didnt' use the freezer at all, but rather the fridge for a few minutes.  Served with Trader Joe's pepper poppyseed water crackers, and it was great!  Great for New Year's, and much better than the other recipe I was using!  I love the sharp cheddar in this!

I doubled the seasonings in this recipe because it tasted bland the way it's written.  Served it as an appetizer for Thanksgiving.  Everyone there loved it.  Someone even said it was addictive.  I will definitly make this again.

This was a very good base recipe. I only used one package of cream cheese to make one ball, and added 1 tsp of dijon mustard and almost the same amount of the other ingredients so it would not taste too bland. I also added about 4 TBS of butter and it was heaven! I rolled the ball in the parsley and nuts before putting it in the fridge as well.

I used only 1 1/2 pkg. cream cheese but kept all other ingredients the same due to comments regarding it being bland.  Also added some freshly snipped chives. I didn't freeze; just rolled in pecans and fresh parsley, wrapped it up and placed in fridge.  Absolutely wonderful! Great flavors after sitting in fridge all afternoon.  I rated it four stars since it would have been a bit bland using the three blocks of cream cheese.

I set this out for our BBQ and unfortunately no one touched it.  After one person finally got into it...they wouldn't leave it alone.  Hubby was glad that there was some left over and has been snacking on it ever since.  Only thing I will do differently next time is to reduce the amount of garlic a little bit...it was a bit strong for us.  Thanks for the post.

Everyone loved this at a family gathering. 
This really turned  out good. I doubled the spices though, and added chopped bell peppers. So easy to make and it looks great. The family are asking me to make this again!

I ended up with four medium cheese balls.  I thought they tasted good and I put the pecans and parsley on before I froze them.  I wrapped them in red saran and then put them in a zip lock bag.  The only complaint was that once frozen and defrosted they did tend to crumble unstead of being creamy.  That was my husbands complaint as he continued munching.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was the hit of the party! I left out the Worcestershire, because I unfortunately didn't have any. I kept the rest of the ingredients the same, but cut down the cream cheese to one package. Everyone (including me) loved it and insists I make it for Christmas, too! Great recipe, thanks!!

I cut the cream cheese in half to make one large cheese log, but I kept all the other ingredients the same. I made this last night, so it could sit overnight and really meld flavors and really get good. I doubled the garlic and took What a Dish's advice an added a squirt of dijon mustard. At the last minute I added in a teaspoon of onion powder and fresh ground pepper. My husband and I really liked this but my kids were lukewarm about it. Very good first savory cheese ball recipe attempt.

FANTASTIC! I added a little finely chopped green onion and opted not to roll in the pecan/parsley mixture, but instead shaped it into a turkey for my Thanksgiving appetizer. Everyone went crazy for this cheeseball. I will be using this recipe VERY often! Thanks for posting. :)

The recipe was a hit for our Christmas Eve Brunch. However, don't waste your time using a blender. Mix the ingredients by hand.

this got rave reviews from friends at the party - I added a bit of garlic and herb feta that I had, and I skipped the pecans & parsley since I was shaping it as an igloo with olive penguins - but it was great!

Made this for a baby shower and everyone loved it! I didn't have parsley so I used chives instead (which I mixed in the cheese and rolled on the outside) and I also used walnuts and toasted almonds instead of pecans (because I didn't have them on hand). Wonderful recipe

This was good with a little bit of changing around! I added a little bit more garlic, some onion powder, and some seasoning salt (the initial recipe was a little bland!), and I also rolled it in chipped beef instead of almonds, but in the end it was delicious!

this is a very good cheese ball I actually made 4 medium size cheese balls from the recipe. I added 1 Tablespoon horse radish (Minced) and increased the garlic to 1 tsp. I also added two chopped fine green onions as well. 1 tsp djon mustard may be added if more zip is wanted.All in all, it was easy, a a big hit at the party!

This is a very good cheese ball!  I scaled it down to two packages of cream cheese, and it was still huge.  I did not do the pecan/parsley coating, because I decorated it like a turkey for thanksgiving, but I wish I had added the parsley to the cheese ball mixture - I would have liked the green color and the freshness. This is my cheese ball recipe from now on!

This was excellent! And I am never that crazy about cheese balls, but decided to try it for Thanksgiving because I know it's an easy crowd pleaser. Well, was I absolutely pleased too! I scaled back to 2 pckgs of cream cheese, kept the worcestershire amt. the same, left out the hot sauce & parsley, and added 1 tsp. of garlic. Oh, I also added a little over a half stick of soft butter. I didn't freeze it, just put it in the fridge over night. Plus, I just mixed it by hand really well since it was so thick that I was afraid it wouldn't do well in my blender. I made the turkey feather version by sticking whole pecans into it like feathers & bistro-style pepperidge farm crackers for the tail feathers. My husband carved turkey heads out of cheddar cheese...we made two balls and they were absolutely adorable! My mother-in-law insisted on taking some pics before we devoured them! I will always make these for Thanksgiving!

I made this recipe last night. Yummy amazing sums it up for me! It yielded 3 good-sized cheese balls, so I've got one for today and 2 for later in the week - love that!! Since I can't ever seem to leave well enough alone, I added 4 slices of crumbled thick slab bacon (cooked extra crispy) just before adding the cheddar. I mean really...doesn't bacon make everything better??

I made this cheese ball for the first time this Thanksgiving.  My entire family loved it!!!  We made the turkey cheese ball for decor and it was a great hit!  Hint, use baked veggie chips for more color for the fan of the turkey feathers.  The pecan/parsley rolled cheese ball was devoured!  Enjoy!

I thought this cheeseball was very good. I served it for our Christmas Eve get together. Everyone liked it and I thought it was different from the plain ole store bought ones I had had in the past. I forgot to buy the nuts so I used all parsley to coat it. I am definately making it again this year!

Made this as  Christmas appetizer and it was so delicious! However I must say, 3 blocks of cream cheese?!? Really?? I made this with only one block of cream cheese, which I mixed by hand (pulling out the food processor seemed like a lot of hassle & clean-up.. I didn't miss it) and left the other ingredients the same and man oh man did it come out good!! I sprinkled smoked paprika on the outside as packed it with nuts. Tip, as your rolling it in nuts keep pressing them in. It makes for a nice, sturdy cheese ball and ensures there are plenty of nuts in every bite. Will most definitely be making this again with my slight modifications.

This is okay. It kinda ends up tasting like something you would buy pre-made though like from hickory farms or something. I won't be jumping out of my skin to make this again, but it wasn't bad either. People generally enjoyed this.

This is a really good, simple cheese ball.  Something to make with what most of us might have on hand, however I wouldn't call it the 'best cheese ball' either.   After I made this recipe I then decided to make another batch but tweaked it somewhat.  Added some dill and very finely chopped onion and omitted the hot pepper sauce, and that seemed to be big hit as well.

First cheese ball I ever made, and it came out awesome.  I formed it into the shape of a football for my son's birthday party.  The pecans made it the perfect football color, and I used fresh shredded parm for the lines and laces.  It looked cool and tasted great.

I think this needs some additions to become a great cheese ball.  Next time I'll add some seasoned salt, green onions, a bit of chopped bacon.  Texture was just right.  I cut recipe in 1/2 and still made 2 nice logs.

This is absolutely the best cheeseball I have ever had!  I have experimented with many different cheeseball recipes over the years.  After I made this, one of my friends asked "How did you finally get it right?"  I toast pecans to roll it in and omit the parsley.  Just an excellent recipe.  Thanks for posting!

This is fantastic!  Note that 16 oz. cheese = 4 cups.  I added 1 1/2 cups finely chopped ham (chopped in food processor) and 1/4 cup green onions - would do that again!  I decreased the tabasco to just a few shakes, and added 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper (just a personal preference).  I used my hands to mix everything instead of the food processor.  I ended up with two very large cheese balls, and needed 3/4 cup pecans for each.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the first cheese ball I have ever made.  I made most of it in the food processor but I mixed the cheddar in it in a separate bowl.  I rolled it in sliced almonds.  It tasted really good to me and my husband - but the proof will be in how it goes over at his company party.  I thought it was very tasty and I will definatly make it again.

I made this for a Christmas get-together and it was a huge success!  Before I rolled it in the nut/parsley mix, I shaped the cheese ball into a wreath shape, then after rolling I added little pieces of chopped red bell pepper for decoration.  Everyone at the party asked for the recipe and said it was the best cheese ball they had ever had!

It says you can use a blender to make this. Well I don't have a food processor so I'm using my blender and I can't get it to mix at all. How am I going to have this ready for tomorrow if I can't get it to mix?

Not too bad. I'd recommend cutting back on the Worcestershire sauce, it's a bit strong. I used a block of blend cheese (Colby and Monterrey Jack) and shredded it myself so that it was thicker shreds of cheese, turned out really well.

Made this for the baby shower as well. It was fine, nothing great but certainly nothing bad. It tasted like any other cheeseball. I kicked up the spices considerably and it still didnt have much kick. I make another cheeseball with ranch dressing mix that I like better. Thanks for the recipe though, the guests at the shower liked it. UPDATE: Becausse this recipe makes SO much, I had some leftover. This afternoon I opened the fridge and decided to try another bite. It was MUCH better. It wasnt nearly as bland, it had a much more garlicky flavor. Maybe 4 stars now. If I ever make this again, I will add much more SHARP cheese, more garlic and spices, and let it sit in the fridge atleast overnight.

This is a great Cheese Ball! It is super easy to make and is just delicious. I followed the suggestion to make it for 24 instead of 36 and it was still more than enough. I put this out on the snack table at Thanksgiving next to two store-bought cheeseballs and no one ever touched the store-bought balls. If you're not a huge fan of parsley I'd say you could do without and just put the pecans on the outside. A very good recipe - serves great with wheat thins. yum!

Delicious. I added more garlic, hot sauce, and Worcestershire than called for and rolled it in nuts only. It was a hit at the Xmas Eve party. I'm already thawing another one for tomorrow's New Year's Eve!

Awesome recipe!!  I did reduce the cream cheese to 2 packages and only 1 8 oz package of cheddar cheese. I kept the seasoning the same to give it a little extra kick.

I have made this recipe so many times since I
found it on this site. At Christmas I give it as gifts and now have friends and family expecting it. You
will not be disappointed.  The one change I make 
is I use smoked cheddar instead of regular cheddar.
Simply delicious...

Fabulous Recipe!  I skipped the garlic and added a packet of zesty italian dressing mix and 2 tsp of chopped red pepper.  Skipped the hot sauce and rolled in just pecans!  My family's favorite.  Made 4 cheese balls.

Very yummy, thanks!  I mixed the parsley in with the cheese ball and that was fabulous!  Definitely make it ahead to let flavors meld.  This makes a lot!  I made 3 smallers balls out of it to go farther.  I only had almonds on hand, so I chopped them up and used them.  It  was very good!

I have made this recipe twice now, once exactly as written and once using mozzarella and parmesan cheese instead of the cheddar.  The first time it was ok, but looked very similar to another cheese ball I had made for the same party.  The other one was completely gone, and about half of this was eaten during the party.  Next time I used the other cheeses, and I added more worcestershire and hot sauce, and I liked it much better.  My husband ate half of it in one sitting.  Still not as good as my old standby recipe, but definitely pretty good.

I followed the recipe exactly. The consistency of the ball before freezing was verrrry soft so not sure if I made an error.  Rather than making all the mixtures into balls (messy), I reserved enough of the cheese mixture to make about 1.5 balls and rather than rolling it in the the pecan/parsley mixture, I mixed all ingredients and refrigerated it.  I served in a clear glass serving bowl as a cheese dip (firm).  It was fabulous and not as messy.  I will definitely make again.  Hub loved it too.

I am not a huge cheese ball fan - but needed an appetizer for the holiday...I was able to produce 3, nice-sized cheese balls from the recipe...I used a salsa picante hot sauce and eliminated the parsley (actually I forgot to buy fresh)...The cheese balls are really tasty and everyone enjoyed them - very refreshing flavor...

This recipe is great.  I found this recipe in 2005 and my family requests me to bring this to every Holiday.  I have modified the recipe a little.  I roll the cheese ball in Colby Monterey Jack Cheese instead of the nuts and I serve with Grandma Sheares Corn Chips.

This turned out good, I will make again and I think I will cut the tabasco and other seasonings a little, they were pretty strong. I used one bag of shredded cheddar (2 cups), maybe more cheese would have made the difference. Great texture.

I made this cheese ball last night and cut it down to 4 servings using one stick of cream cheese and it fed more than 4 people. It was excellent. Everyone thought I bought it. I will start to make this for all get togethers.

I brought this in for a potluck at work and it disappeared in no time.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was absolutely perfect.  I'll be making it again for Thanksgiving.

This was wonderful.  Thanks for the great recipe.  It's a milder version of a cheeseball that my family has been making for years in which we mixed the pecans into the cheese mixture, formed into balls, and then rolled the whole cheeseball into chili powder.  It isn't as fiery as it sounds but is spicier.  It could offer a contrast if you are making two or more of them.

Excellent basic cheese ball. You can roll the cheese ball in so many different things and freeze or keeps in frig for 3 weeks. I roll in parsley, pecans, walnuts, bacon bits, etc. My go to cheese ball.

Great recipe!  I didn't quite like the idea of having pecans and parsley on the outside so I included the parsley in the cheese mixture instead...I thought it added nice color to the ball of cheesy goodness :)

It had a very strong garlic taste but my family loves that.  Watch the amount of cream cheese it makes the ball kinda runny.  Otherwise it was good.  Also you might want to change the serving amount.

LOVE this cheese ball. I omitted the nuts because, well, I'm not keen on nuts! Used the 'rooster' type asian chili sauce, and about twice what was called for, and covered while warm with fine minced parsley (I think the frozen bit may be a typo?) Made this for a 4th of July party, and plan on making again for my Christmas munchy board- but as a christmas tree this time!

I served this at my wedding reception and though I didn't personally get a chance to taste it I heard it was amazing! One person said he could of just eaten that all night! I'm making it again, and will probably follow other reviewers by cutting it to 8 servings and add more/double flavor ingredients.

Loved it!  I added maybe a touch more of the hot sauce and garlic, and I used co-Jack cheese.  Don't be fooled by the hot sauce - this is not hot.  People that don't like spicy food should still like it!  We thought it was a keeper - I make a few cheese balls, this is a great one to add to the rotation!

Great starter recipe. I only made one cheese ball using cream cheese, shredded cheese, w. sauce, and garlic powder, the rolled in shaved almonds. Made 50 of these for my sister's wedding. It was a hit.

I added a dash of onion powder to the recipe since I like lots of flavor, and it was very tasty. My husband can be a bit picky, and he loved this cheese ball.  Will definitely make this again!
We ate it on both regular crackers and on the Ranch Flavored Wheat Thin crisps.

Very good.  I didn't have the hot pepper sauce so I had to improvise.  Forget what I used.  Cajun seasoning for one.  I didn't have "fresh" parsley....I used dried, think I will go easy on that next time, I might have used to much.  Least that's on the outside!

I am sorry to say that I just did not like this.  There was something wrong with the combination of worcestershire and tabasco that just did not work.  Your first bite was OK but the anything more than that left a nasty aftertaste in your mouth.  I made this for a baby shower and the guests were polite and all had one bite but I will not be making it again.  As a note, I found it much easier to shape this into a log instead of a ball.  Even after spending the night in the fridge, it was still very tacky and hard to shape/roll in pecans.

I am now getting requests for this cheese ball.  I will divide the cheese into 4 ball.  2 go to the fridge and 2 go to the freezer.  I have frozen not longer than 3 weeks because my honey can't resist this any longer than that. You will not be disappointed.

I was just looking up this recipe again after making it about six months ago for a party.  I needed something really good, and this just stuck in my mind because everyone raved about it.  I made this cheese ball and another recipe for a cheese ball that I found on this site (I won't point fingers) and this one far outdid the other.  It has great texture, great flavor, and it is very easy.  I rolled mine in walnuts.

YUM! I took this to a family gathering and the mother-in-law really liked it (which is a great compliment!) I did add a little chopped green onion.

I searched for the perfect cheeseball for my mother's 60th surprise party and this was it.... I have had numerous people inquire as to where I got the recipe from.  I didn't need to add or delete any ingredients it's the best.  Thanks

Great recipe! I left out the parsley, and I mixed the pecans in with the rest. After I shaped and refrigerated it, I sprinkled paprika over it. This gives the cheeseball a great appearance. Tastes and looks great on multigrain or wheat crakers topped with a pecan half.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I substituted low fat cream cheese and low fat cheddar and no one could tell the difference!

I made this for a family gathering.  Everyone loved it including the kids.  It was GREAT!  A couple of days later people were still talking about how good it was.  Downside, It was very difficult to make.  I guess because I used the blender.  The cream cheese although softened was too thick and nothing would move around.  So- I did it a little at a time but it was worth it.

This cheeseball recipe rocks!  I think this is the best cheeseball recipe ever, and I have had many compliments that reflect the same.  This cheeseball is especially good on crisp wheat crackers.  This mixes up quickly in a food processor and is very easy.  Thanks for sharing such an awesome recipe.

Cheese balls are the best - and so easy for a party. You can roll the ball in any type of chopped nuts, or even chopped parsley.

Great cheese ball.  I used 2 packages of cream cheese, 8 oz of cheddar cheese and left the rest of the ingredients the same. The flavors came out wonderful, but it still made so much! I was told to hold onto this recipe by several of my family members at Thanksgiving.

I wish I would have read the review suggesting that you double the seasonings because that may have made this better. I served it at a party and it was hardly touched. I tried it myself and found it to be fairly tasteless.

This was pretty tasty, and I gotta say, having 4 extra cheese balls in my freezer just waiting for the next time I need a hostess gift is convenient. Its not the best cheeseball I've ever had, but I'd put it in the top 10.

This was perfect.  I have made this for my friends as gifts and for parties.  I let it set out for a few minutes before serving so people can easily get their serving.  I also decided against the pecans because of food alergies in some of my guests.

I MADE THIS FOR A HOUSE WARMING PARTY TOMORROW AND TRIED SOME TONITE. IT WAS VERY GOOD. I DID NOT ADD HOT SAUCE BECAUSE I WAS NOT SURE HOW SPICY IT WOULD BE. PLUS I DID NOT FORM INTO CHEESE BALLS, JUST LEFT AS A SPREAD. IT SEEMS LIKE MORE PEOPLE EAT CHEESE BALL RECIPES WHEN I JUST MAKE IT AS A SPREAD..NOT SURE WHY. THIS WAS SO EASY TO MAKE.

Bit hit! I tripled the recipe. I have frozen the cheese logs for future potluck parties by wrapping each log tightly and then placing them in a large freezer bag.

I've never reviewed this, but have made it time and time again.  I reduce the recipe by 1/3 to create 1 cheese ball using only 1 package of cream cheese.  I always like to add my own touches, but made as written, this cheese ball is great!  Some touches I like are: garlic powder, onion powder, a bit of liquid smoke and have used some dry parsley instead of fresh, although fresh is best!  One 1/3 the recipe makes a ball the size of a softball and I feel is enough to server at any gathering.

Loved the idea of shaping like a turkey, but needs for flavor.  Will try to make a Christmas Tree for Christmas.

This was the best cheese ball I have ever had! Everyone raved about it! I used all the cream cheese, doubled the Worcestershire & garlic, used 1 tsp Tabasco sauce and no change to the sharp cheddar cheese. Put it in the refrigerator for an hour, then rolled in crushed pecans and omitted the parsley. I made it into a turkey as on a previous post for Thanksgiving and I think it will become a snowman for Christmas!

I first made this recipe over 30 years ago (having received it from one of the Herman's in college), and it continues to be a favorite every time I serve it.  If you want to avoid a blandness, use Texas Pete's hot sauce and real garlic (smashed and minced!); the fresh grated sharp cheddar is a must (I use extra-sharp and grate it myself, more flavor).  For gifts and presentation, I use only the nuts (unless the parsley is fresh); but for my family, it goes fast bare.

Everyone loved this at our New Years Eve party! I did cut down the hot sauce because I have five children under ten years old. I only used two teaspoons.  It still had a little zip but probably the whole tablespoon would have been fine. Make sure you mix thoroughly, because we didn't and had some plain cream cheese spots in ours. The kids liked that effect but I was embarassed.  More than one person said "what *makes* this is the nuts!" so I wouldn't leave them off or sub walnuts. YMMV, or course!

This was good but needed a little something, maybe some fresh herbs, to blend with/complement the Worchestershire flavor. And I wouldn't recommend substituting walnuts for the pecans, the walnuts didn't add anything whereas the pecans more than likely would have.

This was a great cheeseball.  I made it for Thanksgiving and made it about a week in advance wrapped up in the refrigerator.  Needed to be softened a little before serving but it was very good.  I'll make this again.

Perfect amount for making a wreath in a mold. I lined the mold with plastic wrap and then filled with the cheese blend. Instead of nuts and parsley, I covered with finely chopped parsley and chives and then halved 2 small red cherry tomatoes and two small yellow cherry tomatoes to look like ornaments on the top of the wreath.

This was extremely yummy and everyone at my work food day loved it!! I put probably a splash too much Worcheshire in it, but it was still delicious. Rolling in the pecans and parsley makes for a very attractive presentation. Keeper!

I only needed to make 2 cheese balls, so I used 2 packages of cream cheese, 8 oz. of sharp cheddar cheese, and added the full measurements for the rest of the ingredients. After tasting it, it still seemed a bit on the bland side, and I wish I had some fresh chives on hand, because I really think that would add a nice flavor. The cheese balls are sitting in the freezer right now, and I'm hoping the flavors will marry well and intensify a bit by Thursday (Thanksgiving). I have the pecans and fresh parsley to roll them in. All in all, a pretty good recipe, but I feel the seasonings just need to be bumped up a bit. By the way, I didn't bother getting out the food processor; I just attacked the mixture with my bare hands like  you would a meatloaf.

Excellent cheese ball and will definitely make again.  Made it just as specified but only used 2 blocks of cream cheese.  I did add a little onion powder (why I didn't rate it a 5).  Definitely don't use a food processor - if cream cheese is room temp, it's easy to mix by hand.   I also made it the night before and let it sit in the refrigerator over night - then took it out and rolled it in the nuts.  Will make it again.

This needs a lot of spicing up, otherwise it essentially tastes like cream cheese on a cracker. i added more worcestershire, cream of celery soup, onion soup mix and salt/pepper/garlic salt to get it to be good. I also used almonds, just bc i didn't have pecans. wouldn't make again

This was great! I made one very minor change - instead of minced garlic, I used 1 tsp. Tastefully Simple Garlic Garlic. I divided the recipe into two cheese balls and froze them for 24 hours. I thawed them for an hour or so on the counter in order to make it easier to roll in the nuts and parsley. Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe just as written, but halved it. It was delicious and not at all bland. Everyone loved it, and I had requests for the recipe.

I made 1 cheese ball with just one block of cheese. I did throw in some onion powder for myself. I love that is an easy recipe with not over the top requirements. I would use this again to make a cheese ball. Thanks

I've made this exactly as written and also changed it up by adding a packet of ranch dressing mix.  It's a great basic recipe that is easily customized to your tastes.  I never use a food processor to mix, just do it by hand.  Everyone who has tasted it has loved it.

This is the cutest idea ever for Thanksgiving.  I've made one with the same ingredients and liked it.  I just would like to know what you used for the neck and eyes.   Thanks  good job!

excellent cheese ball!! easy and makes plenty. I tweaked it the second time to suit my own taste. that's what I love most about this site. great recipes that are easily altered for personal preferences.  changes made were that i I only use 2 packages of cream cheese, use one large clove of garlic, only 2 cups finely shredded  sharp cheddar and mix the parsley in the cheese mixture. this makes 2 good size cheese balls. I put one out and keep one for backup as it goes so fast! next time I might add some chopped green onion. thanks!!!

This is the best recipe I have ever made for a cheese ball! I made one year for a Christmas party and every since, I have been asked to bring "My famous" cheese ball. Thank you for sharing!

I followed the recipe and changed the cheddar to gruyere, since we can't find it here in Salvador. After using the blender I thought it was a little runny so I added some chopped nuts, lime and the last cream cheese, it hardened up in the freezer after 1,5 hrs or so... Thumbs up from all guests, especially the americans! :)

My first attempt at a cheese ball - followed directions exactly (except did 1/3rd of recipe) and it turned out beautifully!  Delicious!  Looked gorgeous with the fresh parsley.

Although my husband didn't particularly care for it, I loved it! I made it into four logs and froze three. His family came over one night so I thawed one, and they loved it. All the women wanted the recipe. I wouldn't leave out the hot sauce. It wasn't spicy at all and it really added flavor.
