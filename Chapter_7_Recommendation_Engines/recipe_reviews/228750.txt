Loved it! It brought me back to my favorite little Greek restaurant from back home. Following previous comments, I did add an egg.  I also prepared them as meatballs instead of burgers and put them in a pita wrap. For the side dish, I made the Greek Style Potatoes I got from this site a couple years ago. This is definitely a make again meal.

These burgers have GREAT Greek flavor to them. I used store bought tzatziki sauce. I didn't have any goat cheese, so I only used feta. Also, I added about a tbsp. of the tzatziki sauce to the beef and an egg to bind. In retrospect, I should have added some breadcrumbs. My burgers were on the softer side, so don't expect a firm texture like you get with regular burgers. Hubby loved the flavor, but would have liked a more firm texture. To replicate gyro style, we added a sliced tomato to the bun, beef patty on top, topped with a bit of tzatziki sauce. We don't like onions, but for those that do, an onion slice added to the burger would probably be good too. Yummy change of pace from regular burgers.

I liked the flavor, but these were very fragile due to the amount of feta... and I even cut back on it when I was adding it. I think less cheese or adding an egg might help them stay together more

Awesome recipe! I ground up the burger instead though and turned it into a wrap with tomato, lettuce and kalamata olives. Avocado would be good with it too!

I Have made this burger several times at this point and it never gets old. My son especially loves them. This is one of the few dishes he requests by name, and of course this makes me feel good. Thank you for a great recipe.

The fam wanted burgers, and I wanted Greek. They got their burgers, and I got my Greek. So, I did add egg and bread crumbs to bind ( remember, the fam had regular burgers, so I could split an egg); will likely use tzatziki next time. I had a Greek seasoning mix, so I used that. No goat cheese, so I used more feta. Tomato slice, onion slice, and tzatziki on top, and I was in heaven. And my daughter was wondering why she didn't ask for Greek, too. Juicy and flavorful.

Really liked this recipe - it's a flavor far enough away from what you normally have in hamburgers, so it's a nice change. The Greek gyro taste is definitely there! Agree with LindaT that they were fragile. I took her advice and added an egg, which helped a lot. Would not recommend using a Foreman grill with these.
