I grew up with these! Very yummy! Tip: If you have one my mom always used a meat grinder to grind the spam and cheese. Has a really nice "mix" that way!

Awesome! My dad used to make these when I was growing up. Fond memories of spam-wiches while fishing on the riverbank.

This was our first encounter with SPAM. We used the low-fat SPAM with low-fat mayo and shredded cheddar. The roll was a hoagie bun. My lead reviewer says he would definitely try these again!

My mother used to make these but would grind the Spam, some American cheese, AND some onion and green pepper using one of those old meat grinders you clamp to the table.   The texture is more even and becomes spreadable.   So I went and found an unused, old meat grinder and tonight we're having "Mom's Spamwiches."  I can almost taste them already!

Very SALTY! But tasty. I had a couple left over and ate them cold for lunch the next day.

We thought it was very good but salty. I will try it again with low sodium.

Quick and easy. The only thing I changed was I substituted BBQ sauce for the salad dressing. My husband absolutely loved it!
