An excellent recipie! I made it with katchup instead of tomato sauce, roasted 3 small onions and 3 large cloves of garlic, and no vinegar because I didn't have any. Definately a reccommendation for oriental-tasting roasts or any type of meat.

I might have liked this if it had in any way indicated that it would be more of an "Asian Sauce" than a BBQ sauce.  Because it is not at all what I was expecting, I did not really like this at all.  If you are looking for a traditional barbecue sauce recipe, keep looking.  This is not it.

I was looking for a BBQ sauce that tasted like something my old neighbor used to make, and this is so close. That was the best BBQ sauce ever, but she wouldn't give out her secret recipe.  I left out the hoisin sauce.  Great recipe!
