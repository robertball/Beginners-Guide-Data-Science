I have mixed feelings about this recipe, but as its first reviewer I’m happy to report that in the end it turned out delicious. First, 3 cups of crumbs was way off. I used half that and it worked out well. I also melted the butter, which I think made for easier mixing. The vanilla wafer crust was ok, but not as good as the traditional graham cracker crust. I also baked the crust for about 7 minutes before adding the filling. As for the filling, it’s a fairly standard Key lime pie filling, but with only 1 tsp. of lime zest I knew it would suffer some tartness and flavor, so I upped it to 1 T. and it proved to be just right. Since it is essentially double the typical amount of filling, I think it could have used another 5 minutes in the oven to fully set the filling. As for the glaze - vibrant, fruity flavor, pleasantly sweet and tart, with a vivid, ruby red color.  I was torn between using it as a sauce rather than a glaze atop the whole pie and ultimately the decision was made for me.  For whatever reason, the glaze didn’t gel as it should have, and never really thickened as it cooled. It would have never worked as a glaze. Maybe my fruit pectin was too old. But it was PERFECT as a sauce, and that’s really how I wanted it anyway! So as it turned out I was quite pleased that it “failed.”  This is a beautiful, light, refreshing spring/summer pie.  I broke my own rule by serving guests a recipe I’ve never tried before - and I lucked out.

I didn't make the pie, but I made the sauce for another dessert.   It's has great balance of sweetness and tangy, and just the right consistency (runny enough to put in a squeeze bottle,  but still with some body) to pour over ice cream or whatever you might want!
