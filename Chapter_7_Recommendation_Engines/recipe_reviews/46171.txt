Very interesting. Not much parsley flavor though. Kids loved it on bread though...a bit on the tart side for me. I used powdered pectin instead of liquid and it seems to work fine.

I do like the flexibility of this recipe being able to use all types of delicious herbs from my garden. The only issue that I had after multiple attempts was getting this to jell adequately. I can all the time and usually never had problems but this was a real challenge. I eventually had to use it as more of a sauce as opposed to jelly. Nice flavor but uneven results.
