People! I don't get the constant complaints about this pudding being too dry!  IT IS A DIFFERENT STYLE OF RICE PUDDING - IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE FIRM ENOUGH TO CUT! Get it? If you want a vanilla-pudding-with-rice-in-it type of pudding, USE A DIFFERENT RECIPE! Don't waste everyone's time complaining that this recipe isn't like that. The lady (with all the yes votes) who says the recipe is wrong is totally out to lunch - the changes she suggested would change it to a completely different recipe. That said - this recipe is delicious - I put a little cinnamon in it and nutmeg on top. Good warm or cold - also good with milk or cream poured over. Brings back childhood memories from the South. Thanks.

I think the reason so many people are trying to change this recipe is that there are two styles of rice puuding.    This is the dry, baked style, which is very different from the wet , creamy style.   This is the kind I grew up with, and the kind that is served in old Southern cafeterias.     It is supposed to be baked until dry.   It is a great way to use up leftover rice.   

I made this with 3 cups leftover cooked rice,  followed the recipe exactly , except added cinamon, and increased the raisins.   It was great.   Exactly what I wanted.   Serve warm with a little cream,  or cold.....

Good basic recipe, but you need to:  (1) BAKE it only for 30 minutes [instead of an hour] OR you MUST USE another cup of milk or half-in-half, because it baked up too dry.  (2) I'd also put in 1/4 cup more sugar only because I like it tad sweeter and 3)I'd butter the baking dish, and maybe add a Tablespoon of butter to this recipe.  Good, solid comfort food :=)  !!!

THERE IS A BIG MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT THIS RECIPE!!   There are 2 styles of rice pudding... One style that is generally preferred by African Americans and quite a few southerners.  It is a baked pudding MEANT to be dry and thick enough to cut into squares if you wanted to.  It is a thick baked custard base, most often served warm.  Then there is a pudding the rest of the population prefers that is a type of creamy vanilla pudding base with rice in it, usually served cold.  If the latter is what you seek,... THIS AIN'T IT!!!  Go to a different recipe.  This recipe mirrors what I grew up understanding to be rice pudding, but may not fit the bill for you if you grew up on the other kind.  Probably if you grew up eating one of them, you'll HATE the other.

I decided to try this even after reading some of the bad reviews. This is a great recipe. I only changed it a little bit to make it taste like my great grandmothers who was born and raised in Mississippi and will turn 108 this October. Cooked the rice in milk, butter and 1/2 cup sugar. I used 1/2 evaporated milk and 1/2 cream, 2 tbsp butter, I only had cinnamon and increased the sugar to 1 cup. This is a very southern traditional rice pudding not the soupy/creamy kind they make in northern states. My kids loved it so much they took some to school for their snack. Not for dieters that's for sure. Works well with soy milk for those who are lactose intolerant. I used vanilla flavored.(second try) Oh and don't forget to spray or butter the dish!!! I will certainly be making this for my Big Momma as a birthday gift.

After reading this recipe and reviews,  I immediately determined this is much to much rice and not enough liquid, even if the rice has been pre-cooked.  This would not produce a "creamy" pudding as rice pudding should be.  For 1 cup of uncooked rice there should be atleast 8-10 cups of milk.  Even -2cups of water for cooking rice, there should be at least 6 more cups of milk (not 2) for this quantity of rice.

I made two of these the first one was too dry if you baked it for the total of 1 hr.  The second one came out perfect after stirring well and then just baking an additional 15 mins.  I will be making this one again.

To all of you who thought it wasn't creamy enough - it's a baked pudding.  You're supposed to be able to cut it.  If you want "creamy", look for rice pudding recipes cooked on the stove top.  I thought it was fabulous.  Took me back to my grandmother's kitchen.  Can't wait to try different variations.  Thank you for a great recipe.

I make rice pudding for Christmas every year I will use this recipe as a bases snice I lost my recipe, what I do different is I will add the cinnamon and nutmeg. I also will add a little juice from a fresh squeeze ornage, And I only but the egg yolks in the pudding the whites are saved and used to make a margarine for the top after the pudding bakes. Also I put the dish in a pan of water to bake.

Oh my, was this ever dry.  I added an extra cup of milk, a little extra water when cooking the rice and still it was like eating a bowl of rice. I added a little extra sugar because I like it sweet.  The flavor was good-the texture not good at all.

I have to agree with a previous post about this being a great recipe because it is dry. This is the kind my mom used to make. It was purposely dry. We would pour half and half or cream over it to our desired consistency. This recipe is wonderful. Don't change a thing. If you want a creamy rice pudding you will have to look at other recipes.

I have been looking for this exact version of rice pudding for MONTHS - this recipe is very similar to the one my mother used to make. This is supposed to be a dry baked pudding (NOT creamy stovetop style) and it is fabulous just as the recipe is. For those that find it "dry," in my family we always poured half and half over the pudding to serve it and it was soooo good. The only change was that I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg but that's my taste preference. Perfect, thank you so much for this recipe!

This would be a great rice pudding recipe for Japanese cuisine because it isn't very sweet to begin with, but for the american palate this recipe needs too many tweaks to make it good if you go directly from the recipe.  Cooking the rice beforehand in just water left the rice very bland.  It should be cooked with milk, sugar and cinnamon.  This doesn't have a custard consistency, it is more like a binder for rice.  It isn't sweet at all.  It comes out dry and I didn't leave it in the oven over the time allotted.  The look and smell of the finished product was appealing.  It's easy to make.  It would be good as a breakfast item not a dinner dessert.  I made a hard sauce to go with it after tasting a bite of it before serving it.

This is a perfect baked rice pudding recipe.  The only things i did different  were add more raisins and I used canned milk because i had a can I had to use.  Did everything else exactly as stated.  It is the closest to my Grandma's recipe I have tried.  Nice and firm and not too sweet - it is a real keeper.

This is BAKED rice pudding, just like my mother used to make. It is supposed to be dry, not runny and soupy! I made this and only changed from using nutmeg to using cinnamon. It was FANTASTIC! Just like my mother used to make. Everybody who was worthy of getting a piece of it said this was the old fashioned comfort food type that they remembered their grandmother used to make! It put a smile on everyone's face!

I added about 1/4 cup more milk, omitted the raisins, only because I didn't have any, and baked for 30 mins.  Sprinkled with both nutmeg and cinnamon and baked for an additional 20 mins.  Very Yummy. My husband said just like his grandma used to make

I was looking for a rice pudding recipe to hurriedly feed some overnight houseguests at breakfast.  I tried this recipe doubled.  I had some rice I had already cooked which probably measured close to 2C.  I didn't measure the raisins and probably added twice as many as called for.  I also used skim or 1% milk.  I then baked this for the required time in a large ceramic casserole dish.

I wish I would have quadrupled the recipe for the ten of us.  It was fabulous and gone in mere moments.  Everybody raved (of course, this was rather a late breakfast and starvation never diminishes your cooking skills).

With all of the raisins I added I could have cut back on the sugar.  I also could have used a bit less than 1 t. sea salt.  I would not hesitate to make this recipe again.

I just made this rice pudding today. I also don't understand the negative reviews.  I only changed a couple of things. I used heavy cream instead of milk, used cinnamon 1/4 tsp in addition to nutmeg and added 3 tbsp. of melted butter.  Baked for 45 min instead of 1 hour. This tasted just like the baked rice pudding my mother made for me when I was growing up. My mother was from Richmond, VA. This is a baked rice pudding, maybe why this recipe got negative reviews. This recipe came out so creamy and delicious. Absolutely, DELICIOUS.  Also this is so easy to make and reminded me of my childhood. I will definitely be making this again...

This is the rice pudding I was raised on. The creamy kind is too much like tapioca pudding. I do add about a half cup more of milk than this recipe calls for but other wise it's great. When you want to eat it, you cut a piece out, put it in a bowl and nuke it. Then add about a half a cup of milk to it, and eat. I love it.

This came out perfect following the baking directions. I made mine with leftover coconut rice, and dried cranberries because I didn't have raisins, and also added about a tsp of cinnamon. So incredibly good, with that perfect texture. Can't stop eating it.

I liked this recipe.It's appeal is in the fact that it is a very basic rice pudding recipe. It is good as is, or simple enough to add more to it to make it your very own. It is also easy to scale down or double.Whenever I have leftover cooked rice, I will make this recipe! Thanks for the recipe!

Made this recipe to use up the extra rice from dinner after my husband made way too much of it.  He and the kids all loved it, although he says it should be creamier.  I am not a big fan/expert on rice puddings, but any dish that makes all 4 kids and husband happy is a keeper for me.

Very good recipe.  This is REAL rice pudding with a custard base; the kind I loved growing up.  This far surpasses the more contemporary version of vanilla pudding with rice.

Hi,
I think baked rice pudding is really great when you want a really healthy dessert or snack. I know this because my mother has made it for years and till this day i still love baked rice pudding. I want all cooks to try this and everyone should try this and once you've tried it you don't want to stop eating it. Once i tried it i couldn't stop eating it. I ate it for breakfast and sometimes for lunch. I just couldn't stop eating it. It was so delicious.

I made a few changes, and this turned out great:  Oven @ 300. Add 1/4 c sugar, 3 tbsp melted butter/margarine, 1/2 c half & half, and dash of cinnamon to custard mixture. Omit raisins. Sprinkle with cinnamon instead of nutmeg. Bake 30 minutes, stir well, then bake for an additional 15-20 minutes until knife comes out clean.

This recipe is nearly a carbon copy of my grandmother's recipe that I know and love. It's not your standard rice pudding consistency, but it is far from "dry" as others claim (you must be overcooking it if it's dry!) I know my pudding is "done" after it's thickened and is more of a solid jiggle than a sloshing of liquid when lightly jostled side to side.

This pudding is baked, and as such is able to be sliced and cut into portions after it's cooked. It tastes delicious both warm and cold, and I've been known to eat it for breakfast after cooling in the fridge overnight. I prefer spicing it up with cinnamon over nutmeg. I also don't stir it midway through baking, as I enjoy the almost flan-like custard layer that develops over the rice during baking. Absolutely delicious. Whenever I have the time to devote to baking this one, I'll take it over a stovetop, spoonable version any day. Highly recommend. Give it a shot!

Great SOUTHERN-STYLE rice pudding recipe.  It's not supposed to be wet.  Southern rice pudding is dense and this turned out perfect for me.  Tastes just like grandma used to make!  My whole family loves it.

Cook 2 cups of rice first, instead of 1.Put in 2/3 cup sugar, a pinch of cinnamon along with the nutmeg and put your baking dish into a pan of water to cook both in the oven for an hour. If you put your baking dish in a pan of water, then the pudding stays moist but keeps its form when served.

I enjoyed this recipe! Very nice, yet I also added a Tablespoon of butter to add gloss and density. I also changed the milk quantity by adding 1 cup of milk only and 1 cup of cream. I also chopped up 2 Bananas and added them and reduced the cooking time by 30 in the oven. I seved it straight away with whipped cream and a scoop of caramel ice-cream. Very very nice!

This is the recipe I have been looking for! It is just like my mom's rice pudding. I soaked the raisins in 2 Tablespoons of rum for a few minutes before I added them into the mixture. I reserved the rum, to drizzle over the top of the pudding during the last few minutes of baking. It was a delight! Husband loved it! This will be my go to recipe from now on.

I have tried this recipe and loved it!  It reminds me of what I had as a child.  I love that it is baked firm and it can be cut with a knife; I would not change a thing.  This is how it is done in parts of the south. If you want a wetter looser in texture rice pudding, this recipe is not for you.

My family made the baked, dry rice pudding and not the creamy kind.  We used an encyclopedia set from the 60s.  I don't know what set it was but that is where the original recipe came from.  I have memories of making this recipe as a teenager but the encyclopedias are long gone and I never made it again.  I found this and took out the raisins, added a bit of sugar and milk and it's perfect.  As many others said, there are TWO kinds of rice pudding...baked and drier or creamy.  This is the baked and dry and the kind I wanted.  Thank you.

This is a great rice pudding recipe. Just like my Ukrainian Baba used to make. I love it warm with milk poured over top. If you are looking for a creamy rice pudding you need to make a stove top pudding not baked.

This is a great recipe for rice pudding. Those of you who think it is to dry should know that this is how it is meant to be. this should be served in a bowl and topped with (Warm or cold) milk and some cinnamon and nutmeg (And a little sugar if that is what you like)

This is Perfect!

This is the closest I have come to the type of rice pudding  have been looking for. It has almost a custard consistency instead of creamy.  It is not dry at all and just the right sweetness.  My husband said, forget dessert, this is dinner.  He loved it.

The recipe clearly states to bake UNTIL A KNIFE COMES OUT CLEAN. It's not supposed to be soft or semi-liquid. It's a dry, solid, pudding.  That said: I love this recipe!  It's exactly what I wanted, and it's great either for dessert or for breakfast.  The next time I make it, I'm going to try chopped dried peaches in it instead of raisins, for fun.  (Update: Chopped dried peaches are AWESOME!  They taste a little strong, though, so bake about half-way, then stir the peaches in, then finish baking so they don't overpower the flavor of the pudding.)

From the other reviews, it was obvious that the flavor of this pudding was good, but it was very dry.  I used a lot more milk - and also used a bit more sugar - so wrote the proportions as a customized recipe.  I think even with the extra liquid I added, it still could have been baked probably 15 minutes less.

I am babysitting at my daughter's place and couldn't remember my recipe for this (daughter's favorite dessert :0) )so I thought I would check here. I can't believe this is exactly it. It is not your traditional rice pudding. We never cared for that. We have been eating it this way for years. Sometimes I put more milk and eggs in or use brown sugar or cinnamon instead of nutmeg. Today I am using some cinnamon and dried cherries 'cause we don't have raisins.  I think you can pretty much use whatever you feel like using. Thank you for sharing this recipe so I could find it today. :0 )

I made this recipe for my husband and he really enjoyed it.  I'd never had rice pudding, so I tried a lot of recipes to find one that worked for him.  The dryness of this recipe was what liked the most about it. I made a few minor changes.  I cooked my rice in milk and 1/4 cup sugar instead of water. I also used 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and I topped it w/ cinnamon along with the pinch of nutmeg.

I love this pudding...it's not as good as the recipe I grew up eating (lost, sadly) but still delicious. I think a lot of people are looking for a creamy rice pudding--THIS RECIPE IS NOT MEANT TO BE CREAMY PUDDING!! It's the best when served warm with cold cream or half & half.

This is a P.S. to my last review.  I'm not sure why other reviews said it was dry, however mine was perfect.  I used  Minute Rice and baked it in a 2 1/2 quart baking dish.

I must have done something wrong. I followed the recipe exactly but I ended up with a rice cereal that wasn't custardy or pudding-like. Maybe I used too long of a grain rice. I won't be trying this recipe again.

Before I made this rice pudding recipe I read almost all the reviews. I then decided to only make TWO changes. 1. add more raisins 2. cinnamon. As a child my mother made a very similar recipe, in which it too was dry, served hot,but we add cold milk and a sprinkle of sugar on top. Overall, I loved this recipe, it's just like my mom's

Excellent recipe!  I used instant milk instead of regular milk, and allspice instead of nutmeg. I also added a little more water and used a larger pot because the rice I had was low quality.  Rice pudding turned out wonderfully.  Everyone who had tried it loves it!

I had a taste for rice pudding this morning so I called but unfortunately missed my mom before she left for work, so I couldn't get her recipe. So I logged on and found this one and I must say...Almost perfect!!!!! And the only reason I say almost is because it's not my mama's, but it is close and so delicious! I can't wait for my son to wake up from his nap to give him a taste! It is firm (as I believe rice pudding should be...well at least the kind I like) and lots of flavor. I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the mixing bowl  because that's how my mom does it and the two just do something to my taste buds! Thanks for the delicious recipe! 
SN: if you are looking for the creamy or soupy rice pudding recipe this is NOT it!

I made this but did a few things differently...added a cinnamon stick to the boiling water of the rice, remove when rice is done.  Omitted the 1/2 C. sugar and added a can of sweetened condensed milk in place of it for sweetness, but if you prefer more sweetness just leave the sugar in as well.  I baked it in a water bath but had to bake about 15 min. longer with doing so.
I must tell you...this was about the best rice pudding I have ever had!  It came out to perfection, was not dry at all! The sweetened condensed milk and water bath I believe may have helped the dryness issues that others were experiencing.  And it formed this nice little custard like topping, not sure if the sweetened condensed milk did this but it was so yummy and I can't stop eating it! :D

This is a great easy recipe. I read all the reviews on this being too dry. So I added just a little more milk and an extra egg. My mom made this kind of dry rice pudding when I was little. I do know it is supposed to be dry not creamy, then you put more milk and sugar in your bowl when it is served! yum

Very simple to make. I upped the white sugar from 1/2 c. to 2/3 c. since I like my puddings sweeter, and it was not overly sweet.  I also didn't bake it the full hour in my gas oven; I stirred it at 30 mins. into the cooking and it was getting ready to set, so I let it go another 10 minutes.  I don't like dry rice pudding.  I also substituted light cream for the milk and it was very smooth and had a great mouth-feel, but I would make it next time with whole milk to cut the calories.

I loved this recipe!  I'm glad I read the reviews, so I knew it was going to turn out more solid (southern style rice pudding) than creamy pudding (northern style rice pudding).  I used sushi rice and cooked it in a rice cooker.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins (it's all I had) and cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  It was delicious warm, and just what I wanted.

I made this with a few substitutions. 1 can evaporated milk and 3/4 c skim. 3/4 cup sugar (next time I'll add 1/2 c brown I think) and 1 tsp cinnamon. I also already had brown rice cooked so I used that. It's nearly exactly what my Mom made when I was little; but not as sweet as I would like. Had to bake it longer than said; but probably due to the rice/milk changes. Overall great recipe.

great recipe mine came out nice and moist, but ive cooked rice pud many times. not this recipe but if you dont have really well cooked rice when you add it to the rest it will make it dry. most rice puddings you have to adjust the cooking time to how thick you want it.  oh a trick my mum's use 1 cup evaporated milk  1 cup milk makes it creamy

The subtle flavor of this pudding was perfect however the consistency was a quite dry.  So dry infact, I almost threw it out.  Instead I served it with cold milk and a bit of sugar for breakfast the next morning as another review suggested.  It was still just o.k.

This recipe is awesome.  It was exactly what I wanted and the best use for leftover rice!   I read through the reviews and I am honestly amazed anyone would think this recipe was not sweet enough.  I did happen to use 1/4 cup of dates in place of raisins,  because that is what I had on-hand.  It turned out wonderfully.   Thank you Emtmom for the great recipe!

Very good baked rice pudding recipe. As mentioned by others, this style of rice pudding is supposed to be dry. Like the recipe says, an inserted knife should come out clean when it's done. This recipe firmed up perfectly. Serve it warm with some milk, or light cream, and a sprinkle of cinnamon. (Don't mix cinnamon in the recipe before cooking or it will turn an unappealling muddy colour)

Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.  Having had dental surgery I needed something soft and nutritious to eat.  All I could think about was my grandmother's rice pudding...and here it is!  It is exactly the same and a warm bowlful brought back wonderful memories from over 50 years ago.  How nice is that?!

One of the other people were correct, there are two differenty types of pudding, and this is not the wetter one which is meant to be spooned into a dish, not cut.

I read several reviews to bake this only for 30 minutes.  It says to bake for 30 minutes.  Also, many ppl complained of it being dry.  It was perfect, especially with half n half added when served.  I baked this in a glass baking dish without buttering or using Pam. It did not stick. I always butter my rice when i cook it so that maybe the reason.  It was delicious.  I will definitely make this a regular at my house.  As was stated in several reviews, this is a baked pudding not a creamy pudding.  love this recipe!  The only change i would make is to add more raisins since my husband thinks you can never have too many in any dish.  thanks for submitting a wonderful dish.

This is a great recipe! It was just like the recipe for rice pudding that my grandma used to make. I did make a few changes though... I tripled the custard mixture, doubled the rice and raisins, and sprinkled cinnamon on top also. Thanks for the great rice pudding recipe!

Having read the reviews (and custard), I doubled the egg mixture. Turned out just like Gma used to make. I also used cooked minute rice. :)

I loved this. It is just like the rice pudding my mom used to make. I did add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the mix and added 2 tbsp of melted butter and 1/4 cup additional sugar (as someone else suggested) added the nutmeg in with everything else and then followed the recipe on baking times. Fabulous.

I made this with some changes.  I used two cups of cooked rice I had in the fridge from the night before.  I upped the milk to 2 1/2 cups.  I used 1/4 brown sugar and 1/2 regular.  I also used cinn., nutmeg, and all spice about a tsp of each.  I cooked in water bath for 1 1/2 hours and stirred at each half hour (twice) to distribute the ingredients.

Very good! I added 2 T spiced rum. Except for the rum, I followed the recipe exactly. It turned out moist and had a bit of a custard on top, I loved it. I will add 2-3 more eggs next time with hopes of a bit more of the custard layer. I served this warm with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Dry, more like some kind of a plain rice dish. Not really a traditional rice pudding. Maybe it was too much rice? Not enough liquid? I'll try it again though because I don't think one chance is all it should get.

I really like rice pudding because it is low fat sweet treat that I can eat guilt free.  So I am always on the lookout for a good rice pudding recipe.  This really wasn't it!  It was good but very very dry with out a ton of flavor it was good and I ate it but I am still searching.

The recipe was easy to follow and the flavor was good, however, the pudding is a little drier than I would like. I will try again and make some adjustments to the original recipe.

This was really tasty... really simple... and good for using up leftover rice.  I didn't have any raisins on hand, so I made it without them.  I also love cinnamon and nutmeg, so I used about a teaspoon of cinnamon and doubled up the nutmeg.  Delicious :)

Hmmm...not the best. It doesn't have a fixed consistency; after a day or so of refridgeration it is basically rice with cold custard on the top. I *love* rice pudding, but ended up tossing this stuff before we had finished the batch.

I’ve been eating rice pudding for over 55 years. This is a good one.  I use left over rice from Chinese food. Change all number times 4. Use a large Dutch oven. After one hour stir. After two hours stir again. After a knife comes clean add cinnamon and sugar and sprinkle on top. Cook 20 more min.   I use my raisins soaked in spice rum for 24 hours. Try it.

This got to be the best rice pudding.  I remember my Grandmother making Rice Pudding for me and she lived on the farm.  She used fresh eggs that she got that day.  WOW!  The taste was unforgettable.  Now this recipe is close to the same taste.   Ummmmm Good!

I made this as directed except I used whole grain basmati rice because that is what I had on hand.  I also added two additional egg yolks because I wanted to use them up.  It was delicious.  I will make it again the same way.

These are baked too long and that is what dries it out. I use small ramikens cook it on the stove and then bake for fifteen minutes unti bubbly and golden brown and its wonderful.
I take a half cup of heavy cream beat it till its thickened like whip topping and fold it into my rice pudding before baking....yum.

I never liked rice pudding growing up. I'm from NY and every diner would serve awful cold rice pudding as the dessert with your meal. I now live in the south and have found a new appreciation for rice pudding, both baked and the stove top kind! I'm newly engaged, and my fiance's favorite dessert is rice pudding...so I figured I should learn to make it! lol I have my Nana's recipe for stove top rice pudding, it's fabulous, but it uses a whole gallon of milk! I went searching for a recipe that wouldn't have me heading to the store for a whole gallon of milk when I was craving rice pudding, and I found it! I took the advice of other reviewers, which is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5 and it worked out great! I added an extra 1/2 cup milk. I like baked rice pudding a little more like baked custard, so next time I'll add even more milk or take out some rice. I'm sure it would be way too dry without that extra 1/2 cup milk! I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar and it was just the perfect sweetness. I didn't measure the vanilla, just added a good glug(TBP maybe?), but I love vanilla. I didn't have nutmeg, so I used pumpkin pie spice, and extra cinnamon...ok, a lot of cinnamon! lol I cooked this for an hour and a half in a water bath, stirring twice. No rice bricks here! Loved that I didn't have to slave over a hot stove to make this, especially with the heat down here! Thanks so much for the recipe, it's definitely a keeper!

I'm sure if made as is this would be even better  than five stars.  Due to Weight Watchers status I used Egg Beaters and Splenda. It still is delicious and really reminds me of my late mothers version.

I just made this and added only a 1/4 tsp cinnamon. I also mixed the nutmeg & cinnamon in with cornstarch misture.. it gets mixed around anyways after 30min of baking... very good & thick.. the way grandma use to make it... this is a thick cut & serve kind.. good served warm... not the milky add whip cream & serve in a cold dish kind..

This recipe just needs to be baked in a dish of hot water.  I make it every week it is delicious, especially for my 2 year old daughter who loves it hot or cold, ps. I only use 1/4 cup sugar.

A classic southern-style rice pudding. I made a few personal tweaks but nothing too serious. Works very well and produces what you'd expect. My grandmother told me I could bring her more of that any time!

This is wonderful.  It's NOT A CREAMY VERSION and if that's what you're looking for then don't make this!
If, on the other hand, you're looking for a baked pudding, this is the way to go.
I'm not sure how much rice I used, I'm sure it was a tad over what was called for (had Chinese take out last night lol) My favorite part is the custard so I actually used a 9X9 pan which makes it thicker and more custardy.  I kept an eye on it after 30 minutes until a knife came out clean.  This is exactly like Momma used to make!

Just like my mom's!! I grew up on rice pudding like this. I've read that there are two versions, a drier one like this, and a really creamy one...I've never tried the creamy version before, but this one definitely hits the spot. I took the suggestion of other reviews and added an additional 1/4 c. sugar, and 2 tbsp. butter. I also cooked it for 45 mins total, came out fabulous. Only complaint, it was a tad too much vanilla for my taste, so next time I will just cut back on that a bit. Lovin' this recipe, thanks so much for sharing.

Doubled the recipe and used dried cranberries since I had no raisins.  This was delicious.  I always add a little bit of something extra to recipes anyway so the cinnamon was a natural thing for me to add.  Definitely a nice easy baked pudding recipe.

This is the type of rice pudding my grandmother made. She was a terrible cook with one exception her fabulous rice pudding!

This is supposed to be a drier pudding. We always ate it cold with cream poured over the top. I'm so glad I found this recipe...childhood is calling!

This was pretty good other than I added more egg and milk because it would have been too dry. It tasted good and only lacked texture.  I would make again but would also add about half again as much sugar because it wasn't as sweet as the rice pudding that I'm accustomed to eating.

I've been thinking about rice pudding for days now, but none of the recipes seemed to produce a creamy baked pudding.  Well this one does!  I used jasmine rice and coconut milk just because that is what I had on hand.  I increased the vanilla extract to 1 1/2 tsp, but followed the rest as written.  Thanks for a lovely rice pudding!

this was good, but I like my rice pudding a little creamier....maybe 1/2 a cup more milk and a little less cooking time - but that's just personal preference.  with a little whipping cream on top, this pudding is delish!

Has a more egg taste, and is less creamy than I am used to.  Nonetheless, the pudding is still sweet and irresistable.  I am definately going to make this one again.

I made this for a church pot luck, I did a recipe and a half. I made some alterations.  I used currents instead of raisins, powered milk and cinnimon.  FAT FREE and delish! I'm making it again tonight for another church function, only this time a double recipe.  YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!

This is the kind of rice "pudding" I grew up with and I searched high and low for a recipe to replicate the taste of my childhood and this was it! Thank you so much. I love this recipe and have made it several ways now--with raisins, without, with nuts and without. Delicious.  Personally, I like to add my own milk/cream on top of the finished product. I don't care for "wet" rice pudding, but adding my own milk doesn't change the texture.

I don't know why everyone is saying it's dry. It seemed runny, like there wasn't enough rice. I'm cooking it now, maybe it will thicken up. I'm from England & wanted to try an oven version like we do there. I've been in America for 2 decades & normally do a stove top version. Wish me luck! Lol! :)

I have been having baked rice pudding all my life but we use already cooked rice so there is NEVER a problem with too dry of rice. We also alter the amount of eggs and milk with added vanilla coffee creamer (half and half) and use vanilla and grated nutmeg and then cinnamon on top.  I just made a 13 x 9 x 2 " pan of baked rice pudding and used about 8 eggs and l cup sugar and about a quart milk or it came up to a quart and a quarter with the added sugar and eggs. Poured it over the rice placed in the pan. Placed a few dried cranberries in it and added cinnamon on top. Delicious!!! Use cooked white rice and you can't go wrong with this baked recipe!!! There is no end to the possibilities of flavors with a baked rice pudding, as well.

Great recipe. Reminded me of the rice pudding my grandmother made.  I replaced the milk with almond milk (just a personal preference) and it came out great. The baking time was only 45 minutes for my oven.

I doubled the recipe because I didn't have a pan the size called for in the recipe.  I  also substituted a half tsp of vanilla extract with almond extract and mixed the nutmeg and some cinnamon into mixture, and then sprinkled the top with cinnamon and nutmeg on top for 2nd half of baking.I filled the first pyrex dish and there was too much of the ingredients, so I  used two. There seemed to be too much liquid so I made an additional cup of rice and ended up cooking an extra 10 minutes.  Texture is good, it came out a little eggy and needed more sugar   cinnamon and nutmeg. Over all it was not bad.

This is pretty much the recipe that my grandmother used to make. I agree with what another reviewer said in that this is supposed to be firm and cooked through. In fact, the best parts are the hard, crispy edges. It’s a great dish to make with leftover rice. There are other good variations out there, but this one will always be my favorite.

Proportions and time are right on the mark. Turned out excellent, even with my modifications:
Boiled the rice in unsweetened coconut milk;
Unsweetened coconut milk instead of cow's milk;
Rum flavour instead of vanilla;
Cinnamon and nutmeg;
¼ Cup of honey instead of white sugar;
½ Cup of raisins instead of ?; and,
Used a ceramic pie plate instead of the recommended pan.

I didn't use nutmeg and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon mixed in with ingredients. Makes it just like my mom used to make. For those that say it's too try, we would always add condensed milk or ice cream when served.

Perfect!  My  only issue with it, was that I had to bake it for almost an hour.  Other than that, it was really good. I sprinkled cinnamon ontop, not nutmeg.

I combined 3 recipes to make this. I changed the sugar to 1/4 cup pure cane sugar and 1/4 cup dark brown sugar. 1 cup milk and 1 cup 1/2 & 1/2. I added a splash of Almond and vanilla. I also added pure maple syrup approx 1/8 cup. 
I baked it in a water bath pan stirring every 10 minutes, for the allotted time.  BEST DAMNED RECIPE EVER!!!! So good it'll be slapping your Great Grand Children's tastebuds!!!!

This is a super recipe. But, just to add a little more richness, I have replaced the milk with half n half. I also found the recipe remains superbly moist after baking for 30 minutes.

The receipe was not terrible but it did not have the right consistency of a baked rice pudding. My mother is from the south and has made baked rice pudding for our family for years. The ingredients do need to be increased in quantity to resolve the issue with the over dryness. I believe that it does need more milk and nutmeg in the receipe itself. Adding additional sugar might help as well. This comment is not to offend but to make some suggestions. I am going to try the receipe again but I will be adding to my pudding base.

This is definitely for baked rice pudding.  This is a good base recipe that you can use as is or make additions with nuts or various dried fruits.  The rice I used did not required 2 cups of water.  I used Jasmine rice and followed the directions on the package because I didn't want my rice to completely disintegrate with the added liquid in baking.

Prepared exactly as written....Lovely baked rice pudding reminiscent of my grandmother's. Will definitely make again.  Please note, this IS NOT a chilled/creamy pudding such as Chef John's Classic Rice pudding. (Which is delicious in an entirely different manner.)

With so may eggs, I thought it would be like a custard - which is what I wanted.   It was not dry, but it needed to be cut, not spooned out of the pan like a regular pudding.

This is exactly the consistency baked rice pudding is supposed to be.  Just right.  I deducted one star because I tried two batches and prefer to double the sugar to match my grandmothers version. We just like it sweeter.  Our version called for 3 cups cooked rice - FYI we used success white  rice cooked per the instructions on the box.  A packet of success rice is about 1 cup uncooked and about 2 1/2  cups cooked. The raisins are optional - I prefer without, but with them we soaked them in rum overnight first - definitely changes it.

Nice flavor for after supper.  Sweet enough to cleanse the palate from your savory meal.  It is good warm, and I can see pouring milk or cream over top to moisten it after it cools.  It is dry, and according to all of the reviews I read, oven baked rice pudding comes out dry.  Gramma recommended more raisins.  My only change was to bake this in a 9x13 dish instead of the 10x7.  I'm glad I used the larger dish, since I'm leery of stuff boiling over in the oven.  Also,  I sprayed the dish with Pam.  The school cook once told the moms who helped in the kitchen, "If you cook in it, spray it!"  So I sprayed my dish.

l was looking for a rice pudding recipe that I used to make with my mother-in-law...This is it! It is so velvety and custard-like! Just add a sprinkle of cinnamon and a teaspoon of butter! Thanks for sharing!

It is exactly how I remember my Mom's rice pudding when I was a kid. I'm so glad I found this recipe. It brings back so many memories.

after reading the comments, i decided to just cook it for the first 30 min.   took it out and stirred it, and the little bit of liquid that was on top quickly absorbed.  followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  its perfect!! I'm literally standing here eating it hot because its so good.

Love the thickness and dryness of it. Not the creamy loose style pudding type.  Give it a try just the way the recipe says and don't expect it to be loose.

All those not familiar with southern cooking , stop giving this recipe terrible reviews! As others have said,  this a BAKED rice pudding.  You know nothing about what the consistency should be.  Do not add 6 or eight cups of milk to it. You need a recipe that is made on top of the stove, not baked.  Go back to your scrapple and stop trying to change a good southern recipes.

Easy to make! I followed the recipe for the most part, except used 2 1/4 c. of leftover cooked brown rice, almond milk in place of regular milk, and added a tsp of maple syrup. It took about 1 hour 20 minutes in a 325 oven. I kept a close eye on it thinking it was in too long but that's how long it took to set up to the desired consistency. My husband really liked it and I think it turned out real similar to how my Mom used to make (which is what I was looking for!) Will make this again!!

I made it with 2 small changes and it turned out just like my mom used to make. I added an extra ¼ cup of sugar and ¼ tsp cinnamon. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly, including bake temperature and time.   It turned out exactly as expected. 

This is not the creamy style. It is a dryer recipe but I've always eaten it like cereal, with a little milk.

This recipe is great. I made a double batch and it was eaten up in no time. It is similar in texture to what my Mother used to make when we were kids except that her's always had a beautiful crust on top. I wish she had written down her recipes but they were all in her head. She was a great cook and all of her 10 children appreciated that! This recipe is a keeper for sure. Served warm and with table cream it's delicious.

Made it exactly according to the recipe. It was perfect and wonderful. Nothing not to like. I will make this again and it's going to become my favorite pot-luck contribution. I served it warm with whipped topping :0)
PS: I put it all together before-hand and baked it off when my company arrived - it worked beautifully.

Good, simple and easy! A little sweet for my taste. I think the next time I make it I will drop white sugar from 1/2 c to 1/3 c.

This was great. Increased the sugar to 3/4 cup and the raisins to 1 cup (which was a lot of raisins). Also added 1 tablespoon of cinnamon. Was too good. I ate too much of this.

I made this rice pudding using this recipe. I liked it, but I knew that I wanted my rice pudding to be moist, have a little more flavor and sweetness.  This is what I did to make it what I wanted it to be:

1 cup rice,
3 cup water,
3 cup whole milk,
3 eggs,
1 cup sugar,
1 tablespoon Vanilla extract (to taste),
1-2 tablespoons butter (to taste,
I added the butter when I combined the cooked rice with the other ingredients,
Salt to taste,
nutmeg to taste, then I baked it for about 30 min

Much toooooo dry.  Maybe it should not be baked for 30 minutes on the seconbd baking after adding the nutmeg.  Plus, what's with not using cinnamon?  This spice always goes with rice pudding.  I tried this recipe once and that is it.  No one liked it in my house.

I also made this for our traditional Christmas Eve dinner.  It was so much like my Grandmother's.  My son loved it.  He is in his forties and loves all the old traditions.  We add cream over our portion and this takes it over the top in flavor and moisture.

I searched forever to find a recipe for a proper baked rice pudding. This one is absolutely perfect and is now my favorite comfort dessert recipe. My only changes were in the baking process itself; I lightly buttered the baking dish, and baked it in a water bath.

This was exactly what my husband had been asking me for!!!
Since I have never in my life eaten a rice pudding... I was at a lose when he told me it was baked... not creamy and pudding like but similar to a dressing/bread pudding.
I made this exactly as it was written and he was thrilled, thank you!

I  have read all of the comments on this recipie and even though it calls for uncooked rice, I think 'Minute" rice has to be used, so the liquid amount will be enough and no more modifications need to be done ( with the exception of the sugar amount)

I made this with brown rice, 1/4 cup of splenda, and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. It was really good. I also used a mixture of sugar and cinnamon for the top instead of nutmeg. Mine had to cook a little longer ( I used a toaster oven, don't know if it had anything to do with it taking longer).

This recipe overall tasted good... It seemed like it needed more sugar and butter so I added that and it seemed to help. Make sure to cook the rice ALL the way mine came out a tad crunchy.

Not the rice pudding I was hoping for.  Way too much rice in it.  It was like a sweet rice casserole instead of rice pudding.  My husband seemed to like it though, but I will continue searching.

Not very creamy - it tasted okay but I was looking for a recipe with more custard. It was actually kind of blah - needed something - maybe more eggs & milk (or cream). Probably wouldn't make it again. Still searching for the perfect baked rice pudding.

Great recipe!!! My grandmother always added coconut to her pudding. So I cooked the rice with 1 cup of coconut milk and 1 cup of water. I added leftover shredded coconut, approx 1/2 cup. I also added  1/2 cup of extra milk.

Flavor was good. It came out way to thick for me though. Maybe too much rice, or else just too long of a cooking time.

I wasn't fond of this recipe at all. I agree with the other reader on how this being too eggy. That's just one of my disappointments. I just didn't enjoy it

Tasted OK but was very dry.  I even baked it ten minutes less and it still needed less time.

Too dry for our liking!  Even added more milk while cooking.

I was really disappointed in this recipe.  Been making and eating rice pudding for years and this recipe was so very bland.  It is missing the richness.  I would use half and half and some butter.

This was a little dry and could of been a little bit sweeter, but it could easily be tweaked to fix that. I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg.
