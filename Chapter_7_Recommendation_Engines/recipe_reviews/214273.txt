This is good. A pain to make but worth it- so many bowls....:) used parchment paper instead of foil and it worked out great.   This is rich.  You don't need a big piece.

Changed the servings to 24 and made this in a 9x13 dish. Added leftover whip topping to the top and then drizzled melted chocolate. Next time I make it, I would add more servings, as it didn't fill the dish all the way. It tasted good as I made it, I'm sure it'll be a hit at dinner tomorrow!!

I’m in disbelief that this dessert doesn’t have more reviews!! I’ve made it a handful of times now and it always receives rave reviews!! It’s even requested for friends and family’s birthdays. We’ve renamed it the “Nutter Butter Delight”.
