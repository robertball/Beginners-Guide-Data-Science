I am only giving 1 star, because that is the least I can give. If you decide to make this, don't slice the eggplant too thin, or else it tears when taking it off the baking sheet. Also, the meat filling was very greasy. Just all around not a good combo of ingredients.  I love Moussaka when it is made correctly and this is not the way to make it.

I changed it a little--added some cinnamon, as that is typically Greek, and used ground turkey rather than veal.  I "baked" it in a slow-cooker, since I was going to be out for awhile.  It turned out wonderfully!!  My husband said, "If you promise to make this, I won't wince when I see you buying an eggplant."

It is an amazing dish! I cooked it once and now it became my husband's favorite! Can't believe someone gave it only one star! Eggplant must be cut not thinner than a quarter inch. If the meat filling has an access of grease, I usually would slightly drain it before i put it in the baking dish. All my friends who tried it loved this moussaka and asked for a recipe!

Very good!  Don't leave out the feta - it's what really makes the dish.

Used ground turley instead of veal. Doubled the tomato paste and parsley, and added some more beef broth. excellent! Truly excellent, even though we tried our best to screw it up by accidentally overbaking the eggplant. Came out incredibly!

We loved this recipe.  I used ground goat meat instead of the veal.  I even forgot the cheese.  Even so, it was moist and delicious.   A little splash of hot sauce put it over the top.  Terrific!

I've made this a few times according to the recipe and it is fantastic. Today, my eggplant was bad so I made it with zucchini instead and I think it turned out even better.

Excellent recipe. I substituted venison for the veal, and it was delicious! I will definitely makes this again.

This came out really delicious. I added some Garam Masala for flavor as I like my food spicy. Also, it was a good idea to cut the aubergine not too thin. It cooks quite quickly so medium thickness does well too.

Super good recipe, although I did make some changes.  I used ground lamb instead of ground veal because I love lamb and thought it might be more traditional.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that it is important to remove grease after browning meat, double the tomato paste and use more beef broth to keep meat moist during the simmer time.  Also the Bechamel sauce needs to be seasoned with salt and pepper.  Other than that it is a keeper, my husband loved it and I will make it again.
