This is a great recipe, but I baked the wontons instead of frying them for a healthier alternative.  I brushed them with beaten egg and a little water and baked at them 375 for 15 minutes.   Make sure to seal them really tightly or they might ooze a little...

I was a little hesitant about trying out this recipe b/c of the mixed reviews, but with some tweeking, it turned out really good!  I added some finely chopped green onions and used only half of ONE can crab meat for a stronger cream-cheese taste.  Some people also commented that the filling was too mushy and fell apart in the oil.  You can avoid this by squeezing out all the water in the crabmeat before adding to the cream cheese mixture (also results in less crabby taste).  And when you moisten the wonton wrapper edges with water, you get a tight seal.  None of mine fell apart in the oil...  I tried various different folds and liked the triangular fold the best.  This is pretty darn close to restaurant-quality!

I used this recipe as a base for my crab rangoons.  I thought there was a little too much crab and not enough cream cheese.  I also added some green onions to off set the two.  It turned out really well with those minor alterations.  The added cream cheese (2 1/2 pkgs) made the inner mix a little creamier and not so crumbly.  This was an excellent overall recipe..... it just needed a little tweeking for my taste.  I hope this was helpful.

These are delicious. I rate them better than the restaurants, though in the restaurant version, the wrappers are a little thicker. I omitted the parika and water chestnuts. I also use the imitation crabmeat and like that better than canned.  I add a tablespoon of soy sauce to the mix as well. I made these as an appetizer on Christmas Eve and they were gone in seconds!  I have made them at least 3 times since and my family always requests them.

This is definitely an awesome recipe -- with a little tweaking. I followed the previous suggestion for ignoring the water chestnuts and adding the green onion. To cut down on a >few

This one is THE BEST I've tried! Wow! The only change I made to it was no water chestnuts (hubby doesn't like them) and added about 1 Tbsp of chopped green onion. I also added only one can of crab meat instead of 2 and it was PERFECT! I asked my hubby what he thought and I quote "They're good, no they're awesome!"  Thanks for sharing, this one will definitely be used in this house for a while!

Love this recipe, but for the inexperienced in this item...make them ahead of time and you may need to wet your wrapper if using dry wrappers.  Have a bunch folded before you start frying...or have a helper.  Great great great recipe - tasted just like the chinese restaurant's!

Good recipe.  I didn't fry them - I lined a mini muffin pan with the wontons and added the crab/cream cheese and then twisted the wonton closed.  I baked on 350ish for about 10 minutes.  We loved them. Also used green onions instead of water chestnuts.

I really liked these.  I did add some green onions for color and used the imitation crab meat instead of the canned.  I also added just a splash of soy sauce.  They turned out really well.  I only made these changes after trying the recipe as written first (except for the imitation crab meat).  I didn't think it had enough flavor or color for our liking.  Thanks for the post.

Very good, and adaptable to different preferences. Make these changes for more of a "Chinese takeout" flavor:
- double the cream cheese
- decrease the crab by half
- omit the water chestnuts
- add 2 Tbsp chopped green onions
- add 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce

I omitted the water chestnuts the second time I made these, since it is not traditionally part of crab rangoon, and the crunch threw me off a bit. Try mixing up a batch, then frying one rangoon and adjusting the filling ingredients before you make the rest. You'll be glad you did.

Delicious!  I did not use the canned crab - I got the packaged stuff from the seafood section and adjusted the spices somewhat to taste.  We ate the finished rangoons with a sweet/spicy Thai sauce - Amazing!  Thanks!

I have been making crab rangoon for over 20 years with a recipe similar to this. It is ALWAYS requested. My husband usually is my helper, and we make enough(double) to serve several times over the holidays. I freeze on trays after oil frying (only until light golden), and then transfer to freezer bags. Reheat when needed in oven on cookie sheets until golden.

Very crabby! I would probably only use half the amount of crab and/or increase the cream cheese.  My husband liked to eat the filling by itself - saves the "fried" calories.  Overall good, but don't think "resturante style"

I made these for a New Years Eve Party, 2011-2012.

There wasn't one left over.
 
Modifications: 

2 Packages of Philadelphia Cream Cheese. 
1 Can of fancy crab meat, throughly drained.
3 Diced scallions. 
No water chestnuts. 
Combined mixture with a hand blender.
Baked for approximately 10 minutes, 5 minutes on each side vs. fried. 

This made over 50 crab rangoon's plus extra filling left over. They turned out very creamy, with a subtle hint of crab taste. If you prefer a stronger crab taste, I would use 1 & 1/2 can of fancy crab meat; I plan to do this next time. Some of my wontons oozed slightly while baking. Remember to try and seal the wonton as firmly as possible. This is a great simple recipe that is easily manipulated to your specifications. Just remember that filling & folding wontons is time consuming, so plan accordingly.

I may have done a bad thing by learning how to make this!  

Like most, I altered a few things and it turned our AMAZING.  I left-out the paprika and water chestnuts and replaced it with green onions, a little siracha hot sauce, and more cream cheese because I LOVE creamy Crab Rangoon.  I also used the imitation crab, which I was skeptical about but after using both canned and intimation crab, I found I liked the intimation crab's texture the best.  I also baked them instead of frying.  I lightly brushed both sides with vegetable oil and baked them at 375* for about 18 minutes flipping them once after the bottom side became golden brown.

Then while it was baking, I made this sweet and sour dipping sauce.  This recipe is SO SO SO good my mouth is watering just thinking about it :)

Simple/Easy...they taste best with 3/4 of the crabmeat called for,a few green onions chooped finely, some fresh chives and the cream cheese.Make mixture ahead of time, and allow to sit overnight( best) until you are ready to fry.All ingredients shoudld be cold while preparing.....best flavor if fried using older oil(ie: you fried some wings or french fries the night or two before)When wontons float to the surface, they are done.Do not over-cook.....they get very tough....

I LOVED these!!! :)  I followed the recipe for the crab mixture, but I followed the recommendation of another reviewer to use onion and chive cream cheese, which I think really added to the mixture.  It tasted just like what you find at restaurants. For the wonton wrapping, I watched a You Tube video of how to wrap wontons, and I really got the hang of it.  The trick is to not stuff the wonton wrapper too thick...only use 1tsp per wonton wrapper, then seal it well, and you will not have problems with the insides spewing out.  These were so tasty and a big hit!

I agree with some of the other reviewers. This is a little to "crumbly" or "chunky" for my liking. Next time I will use other's suggestions on using 2 1/2 packages of cream cheese to make it more creamy. Using the original recipe I still had a little bit left over when I ran out of wonton wrappers, so if you plan on adding more cream cheese I suggest you buy 2 packages of the wrappers. My best friend growing up was Asian and we made these a lot.. when we made them we used an egg to seal the wrappers rather than water. I had no problem with them staying together. I cooked mine on the stove top and used a thermometer to check the oil. I started putting them in at about 325 degrees F and there's NO WAY that they could stay in there 3 to 5 minutes, they were lucky if they were in there 3 to 5 seconds and they got charred! I didn't even have time to turn them over! So I turned the heat down to about 200 degrees and they were able to be in there for about 10 seconds, I could flip them over in time without scrambling all over, and they were a nice golden brown! I omitted the water chesnuts because my fiance doesn't like them, and I like just a traditional rangoon anyways. Pretty good recipe, I think it will be better adding the extra cream cheese next time though!

These are great, we make them all the time.  I use onion & chive cream cheese and we serve them with sweet Thai chili sauce.  The spicy sweet combo with the crab and cheese combo is amazing!!!

These were wonderful! I did add green onions & left out the water chestnuts as other reviewers suggested - also added some sugar. I'm not a fan of frying foods at all, but in this case, it's a must. I tried baking them the second time around and they were just not good.

When making crab rangoon, I only use Philidelphia onion and chive cream cheese and immitation crab. It is simple and delicious. Using the flavored cream cheese will allow you to ommit other spices.

I used only one can of crab and it came out like restaurant style.  I also didn't use water chestnuts...never had them with water chestnuts.  My husband liked them.  I used peanut oil for frying and had no issues.  I wet the wrappers on the edges to seal and had no issues with them opening.

Simple is best when it comes to crab rangoons which is why this is one of the best recipes for it on this site. The only thing I did not like is 2 cans of crab is too much. I only used one and I found it to be a perfect balance of crab and cream cheese. I also left out the water chestnuts (don't like em), and added green oinions and probably 1 1/2 teaspoons of soy sauce for a little asian flavor. This recipe yielded me about 20 rangoons and I had to stop myself from eating them all.  This would be a great dish to double and take to a party!

The wonton wrappers that I used made the breading so thin and even more crispy and decadent than ones that I get at my local Chinese joint. I made a few changes, the first change was adding green onion, since I already had some on hand, and it sounded like a great suggestion from past reviewers. The other change I made was doubling the cream cheese. It was an accident, but oddly enough, recommended by past reviewers. They just turned out wonderful! I'm hooked, and they are almost better than restaurant ones.

I did add more crab then called for in the first batch and they tasted much better the second batch when I added more cream cheese to my mixture. I will try the next time without the water chestnuts.

Awesome-bf loves these, and I keep the ingredients pretty much on hand (don't forget you can freeze leftover wonton wrappers). Putting together wontons is a little bit time consuming, but fun. I never include water chestnuts.

Great recipe regardless of what you put in or take out.  The secret to keeping the rangoon together is freeze them the night before.

These were very good, but I do agree the crab was a bit overpowering.  Cut the crab in half and you have a good rangoon!  These can also be baked at about 375.  Flip, and they get nice and brown.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious. I added a half tsp of sugar to make it sweet like the restaurant's and decided to skip the water chestnuts. I really enjoyed them as did several of my friends!

I loved this recipe, it tasted as delicious as I expected! I didnt put the water cheastnuts in, I saved them for a different meal, and I used 1 & 1/2 pkg of cream cheese. I used imitation frozen crab meat rather than the canned. It was so flavorful that my 1 1/2 year old daughter couldnt get ENOUGH! Thank you!!

not bad, but even better with a few small changes.I use 1-8oz.package cream cheese and mix it with 1-container sour cream.I then moisten the edges with 1 beaten egg to seal,and brush a little bit of egg over the outside of the sealed wonton.Then when I go to deep fry them I do so in peanut oil.It really gives them a much better taste.Sometimes I make them with only cream cheese and sour cream,being that some people don't really care for crab meat,and people really seem to like them.

This recipe was quick and easy but was a little too crabby tasting for my husband & my liking.  i think i would use 1/2 the amount of crab called for.  other than that it was great!

Usually I have pretty good luck with recipes, but this one really let me down. I followed the recipe exactly and was grossly disappointed. These did not taste like the super yummy cream cheese wontons/ crab rangoons from my favorite Chinese place; not even close. :( I will continue my search for a better recipe.

Best crab rangoon we've ever had, with the following changes: left the water chestnuts out, and only used about 4 or 5 ounces of crabmeat.  It was the perfect amount of crabmeat to balance out the cream cheese and not give an overwhelming crab texture or flavor.  I fried these in oil that I'd used to fry chicken for the Perfect Sesame Chicken on this site.  So delicious!

This was just ok. My biggest complaint was the canned crab. This was my first and last time using it. If I decide to make this again, I will need to splurge on fresh backfin. I thought they were fairly easy to put together but very time consuming. I did switch out water chestnuts for green onion. I fried them and the consistency was pretty good. I think using fresh crabmeat would have taken this from average to delicious.

Great recipe! I added chopped green onion and omitted the water chestnuts and I couldn't find any wanton wrappers so I used egg roll wrappers and cut them down. My husband LOVES Rangoon and he LOVED this recipe. Bravo!

Nothing against garlic powder but it should not be in this recipe at all!  Two stars because remove the garlic powder and this seems to be a good start to what could be a great recipe.

I used the wonton wrapper recipe on allrecipes to make these, and they turned out nicely.  I omitted the water chestnuts and doubled the cream cheese.  If you're having trouble with the cream cheese leaking out, you've got to make sure you seal the wrapper with a little water along every seam and  pinch them tightly.

skipped the paprika added onion powder since I didnt have any green onions on hand and used imitation crab. OH YUMMMY. This was wonderful. I nevered dreamed I could make rangoons but WOW. I cant wait to make them again. I also plan on making a dessert version using cinnamon and vanilla mixed in the cream cheese and topping them with powdered sugar or baked apples. MMMM cant wait!

Easy to make, impressive and delicious results but...  use less crab, more cream cheese.  Fresh minced garlic over garlic powder.  Add fresh green onion and a dash of Worcestershire sauce.

Great recipe, great taste after I tweaked it. No water chestnuts, added a dash (or two) of soy sauce (that is a muss), practice your wonton assembly techniques. I didn't have it down pat, a few came out great, the others..well, not so much. I used phyllo cups to cook/bake the rest in a 350 degree oven for 15 to 20 mins. And Viola`!  Yummers!!! Someone else suggested to make the mixture the night before - awesome idea. Best suggestion yet - read all of the reviews. Awesome recipe, I will be making my own from now on. Love it!!!

My only issue with this, really had nothing to do with the recipe itself.  I baked the wontons (Didn't have enough oil) And they did not cook uniformly.  The tops were far too crunchy while the pockets were far too chewy.(Side note, I had NO idea wonton wrappers were actually made of tofu).  So my guess is frying is a must. I omitted the water chestnuts, and halved the crab.    The filling itself tasted fine (though next time I think I'll add more cream cheese for a creamier consistency) IF you do try to bake, be sure to grease your cooking sheet.  I had a few stick and tear cause I forgot.

D-E-L-I-S-H! They were done in 2 minutes for us... 3 minutes was a tad bit too long for cooking. I also added green onions and more garlic powder.... YUM YUM YUM! These were restaurant worthy!

Pretty good. Not the same flavor as my favorite restaurant, which is what I was hoping for. I will make again and play with the recipe a bit. Good base though. Serve with sweet & sour sauce.

DELICIOUS!!!  I made these for a party and they were the hit of the party!  While I was cooking them my toddler ate about 7 himself! Changes I made:  I used two packages of cream cheese and imitation crab meat from the butcher.   I had the fire very low to fry them and that kept the filling from escaping.  Also make sure to press the wrappers away from the filling as you close them to remove any trapped air, this will also help to keep filling from escaping during frying.   I served them with sweet and sour dipping sauce. Very easy to make, just a little time consuming.

Our family is in love as our number one recipe!! Absolutely love the base of this recipe but I made a few changes off of reading others' reviews...used a bunch of minced up green onions instead of water chestnuts. Also, added 2 pkgs cream cheese and used imitation crab package---about 9 oz of the package so we still had lots of cream cheese flavor.  The water seals the wonton shell in perfectly w/ a triangle fold.

the trick to keeping these babies closed while frying is to make a paste of flour and water, brush all edges with mixture then close. Ive made my own version of these for years and they never pop open, Happy Eating!!

These were great!  I tried these just as the recipe states and they had WAY too much crab for my taste.  I tried them again with just a little crab and more cream cheese and they were much better.

STOP SEARCHING AND START MAKING THESE! WHAT A WONDERFUL TREAT! WE OMITTED THE WATER CHESTNUTS AS WELL AND IT WAS DELICIOUS! THEY WERE MUCH BETTER THAN CHINESE RESTAURANTS. I AM A BIG FAN OF CRAB RANGOON IN GENERAL, AND AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE TURNOUT. HOPE YOU ENJOY THESE!!

Great recipe.  I used real crab meat and left out the water chesnuts.  If you use all the ingredients it calls for you can make like a million of these things, which is great for a party, but I was cooking for two people so had to throw a ton away.  Next time I will do a tenth of what the recipe calls for.  Also, I used one and a half things of cream cheese.  There is just too much crab meat.  So you might want to cut down on that as well when you make this recipe.  Also, you can use this as a dip if you don't want to use wanton wrappers.  Just heat it in a small pan over medium heat and add it to a cracker.  Great with sweet and sour sauce for a topping or olives.

I also have been making these for years. I use the larger wonton wrappers and treat them like egg rolls when rolling. We like a pinch of crushed red pepper also for some heat.

This is a very good crab rangoon I followed the advice of another review and added more cream cheese (another block) and green onion (fom my own garden!) I also omitted the water chestnuts.  I will never gorge myself at the Chinese buffet again, when I can make these at home! YUM

Needed some tweaks.  Good advice I gathered from other reviews was to press as much liquid from the crabmeat.  I also omitted the water chestnuts and added green onion.  After making few rangoons, I decided to add a touch of soy sauce to the filling for umami flavor.  I also added fresh minced garlic because the powder didn't lend enough flavor alone.  I made a dipping sauce of soy sauce, garlic, ginger, brown sugar, water, rice vinegar and a few drops of sesame oil.  Went very well together.  Will for sure make and tweak again.

These came out delicious!! Like a lot of other people said they did in their reviews, I made a few changes here and there so I could give them a more authentic taste.
To start off, I decreased the amount of crab meat in the recipe and increased the amount of cream cheese. This was mainly because I wanted to make crab rangoon that tasted like they came from a Chinese restaurant. I kept the spices the same amount as shown in the recipe, but you can really just add them to taste. I also omitted the water chestnuts, as I didn't really think the crunchiness would work. In addition, I used imitation crab meat instead of canned crab meat, which has a much milder flavor and wouldn't overpower the cream cheese.

I did not add any green onion, which many reviewers have said really helps the recipe, as I did not have any on hand. But next time I make the recipe, I will definitely be adding some to see if it might further improve the flavor.

Liked quite a bit.  I had egg roll wrappers around so I cut in quarters and folded into squares into triagles after putting filling in. Per my recipe for egg rolls, used a flour and water paste to seal the edges and it worked like a charm.  I did tweek filling a bit.  Added one sliced green onion, few dashes of worcestershire sauce and only 1 can of "fancy" crab.  Yum!

These were amazing! Left out water chestnuts, don't care for them. Blended all ingredients in a food processor, folded wonton wrappers in a triangle after putting in the filling, put water around edges, pressed with fork, to hold in cream filling. Made around 40-50, we ate them all!

This recipe got such good reviews and Ive always wanted to try making these but with adjustments they turned out awful! I used imitation crab meat which just didn't taste right and I also baked them but the texture of the wonton wrapper was not good at all. Overall I think I'll use actual real crab meat and fry them next time

Followed the recipe exactly and it's PERFECT! It made a lot of filling, so be prepared to fill around 20+ little wontons. Don't be greedy when filling either, or else they will ooze when frying/baking. This recipe was perfect, delicious, and exactly like restaurant quality! You don't want to pass this recipe up!

Delicious.  It takes awhile to fold them so I'd do it a little bit in advance and cover with a wet paper towel in the meanwhile.  Also, as far as dipping: sweet and sour dipping sauce was by far the best one I tried, followed by Chinese mustard.

I really excited to try this recipe because of teh great reviews.  I followed some suggestions such as using green onions and using less crab meat.  I made these and they did not meet expectations.  I think it was the crab meat that made it bad...I used canned crab meat.  The cheese with seasonings and green onions I think worked well.  If I make these again I will try using even less crab and try it with imitation crab meat.  I think the canned crab meat tasted like metal.  I also only used about 1/2 a can of crab.

I followed the suggestions of others and went with imitation crab, a green onion and a clove of garlic.  My family loved it, I barely got them out the grease before they were eaten up.  I'm not a big seafood fan so I didn't add as much crab the first time, but with or without it the dish is still delicious.

Good. I tried to bake them to be healthier and wasn't a fan because the wonton wrappers I used seemed very thin. Next time I will deep fry them like the recipe says. I also omitted the water chestnuts and paprika because I like mine with a more simple filling.

I love this recipe! A few suggestions.....Using half pineapple cream cheese and half regular really gives it a nice flavor, only one can of crab, and I don't think it has the right flavor at all if you don't use some kind of onion. I've never used the water chestnuts. I also use an egg/milk mixture to seal the rangoons. I've never had one leak at all.

To be fair, I did modify the recipe by substituting water chestnuts for green onions, because I know thats what my local buffett uses.  Also, I did only use 1 can of the crabmeat per others reviews.  The result was yummy, BUT these are missing a "sweetness" that I'm used to from my buffett!  Next time, I will tinker with that, and then these will be perfect for me!  The hubby liked them as is!

Wow, these are superb!  I've always loved these from restaurants.  This was my first time making them at home.  I followed the recipe except omitted water chestnuts and added green onion.  While they were extremely good, I agree that decreasing crab to 1 can would be plenty.  Recipe would have easily used a whole package of wonton wrappers (we used 1/2 of the filling for 1/2 pkg of wrappers).  I haven't used wonton wrappers before, but it was super easy.  They stayed together without leakage problems.  We did fry them, only because we happened to have our fryer out from making homemade doughnuts the other day.  Whole family loved them!  Just as good as a restaurant, and probably better with less crab.

These were delicious. I made them using imitation crab and fresh minced garlic rather than garlic powder. I didn't have water chestnuts, but I did add some chopped green onion. Those were the only alterations and they tasted just like the ones you get at a restaurant. My family agreed. Thanks for the recipe, La Vaun!

Awesome.. What I did to avoid smooshy cream cheese is pop them in the freezer for about 15-30 minutes before frying.  You don't want the wonton wrappers to get frozen solid, so too much longer would probably be bad, but this quick freeze gives the cream cheese time to begin to freeze, so it doesn't go as liquid in the fryer.  Great recipe!

A long time ago I used to buy a certain brand of crab rangoons, which sadly I can not find anymore.  This recipe was a great starting point!  All I could find at the store was a 16 oz can of crab so I added 1 more package of cream cheese, doubled the garlic and paprika, used 1/3c water chestnuts and sliced green onions.  With those small changes, anyone who may possibly remember the Schwan Sales crab rangoons, they were an exact replica!  Hubby had me save the excess to use as a spread for crackers, he loved it that way.

This is our favorite recipe. We make these often and the real crab tastes so much better than recipes using imitation (too sweet). We don't like water chestnuts so used 3 green onions chopped instead. Also, instead of the paprika I used cayenne pepper for a little kick.

The filling was outstanding. I used half the crab meat and half the water chestnuts. I also threw in some powdered sugar since our fav place while we lived in SC served theres a little sweeter. MUCH better than anything we can find up here in New England.

Okey, I altered this recipe a bit, but it's a good base recipe. Here's what I did: 1/2 can crab meat, 1pkg on low fat cream cheese, eyeball onion, garlic, and paprika to taste, maybe tsp each. Cut up 2 scallions chopped, mixed it all up and put Tbsp into wonton and fry. Awsome sweet and sour sauce dip with it: Duck sauce mixed with about a Tbsp of white vinegar ( don't go crazy, it will be to overpowering) little water, and red pepper flakes mix together and place it into fridge for 1/2 hour. The best dipping sauce ever with these. My husband says their better than takeout, and that's hard, we live in Mass.. some of the best chinese food around.

This is exactly what i was looking for!! I love crab rangoon, I only used 1/4 of canned shredded crab as was mentioned by a reviewer, I also removed all the water from the canned crab...other than that followed the recipe to a tee "Delishwish"!!Thank you for sharing. I am now going to try this in  brie baker with the deep fried wontons to dip into...will let you know if I was successful. Will make this again and again and again...xoxoxox

I assembled these the night before and stored them in the frig. on a parchment lined cookie sheet. The next day I cooked them and they were perfect. All that wonderful Crab Rangoon taste without the fuss. As I fried them I placed them on a cookie sheet in the oven at 200 to keep them warm until they were all done. Perfect! Thanks for a great recipe. (I did only used one can crab and omitted the water chestnuts.)

These were excellent. I will never order from a Chinese restaurant again. I made the filling the night before and refrigerated until ready to use the next day. I omitted the water chestnuts and used packaged crab and added green onions. Huge hit.

Substituted imitation crabmeat for canned, but otherwise followed the recipe as follows; served them for a party and they went quite fast! I however was not overly fond of the cream cheese in there, but everyone else seemed to like them, so they are a keeper recipe.

These came out really good, but like another reviewer said, they take a long time to assemble so in the future I'll probably go back to takeout if I feel like crab rangoons.  I only used one can of lump crabmeat, and replaced the water chestnuts with chopped green onion.  I used garlic salt in place of the powder, and I must say the filling was absolutely delicious!  Thanks for the recipe La Vaun, I'm really glad I tried making these and we enjoyed them.  BTW - GREAT pic, Sinsgirl.

Pretty good, very similar to our local China King. For some reason I can't find wonton wrappers in our supermarket, so we used phyllo. Next time I will try harder to find the wontons.

These are great!  Got many compliments saying they were the best crab wontons they'd ever had!  Just a couple small changes...I used 2 cans of crab meat (1 fancy and 1 white), 2 packages of cream cheese, 1 clove of FRESH chopped garlic, way better than powder! and 2 cloves of shallot.  I feel that sometimes it is hard to get green onions to chop very finely.  Also...OLD BAY SEASONING-- goes good with any kind of seafood dish!  As the other users suggested, use a little water on the wantons to get a good seal!  Will make again and again!!

I have been making these for quite some time - they are time consuming to assemble but well worth it.  I always make a double batch and freeze the leftovers for when I don't feel like putting the time into making them.  If you freeze them in a single layer before puting them in a freezer bag, they don't stick together.  Also, I always use immitation crab meat(better flavor than canned) and add some dried chives and a dash of ginger to my mixture. This is always a crowd favorite and part of almost every Friday night meatless dinner during Lent.

this turned out pretty  accurate!  I took other's advice and used green onions instead of the called for water chestnuts.  also used imitation crab and not much of it but this recipe is so simple it would be really hard to screw up... yet to buy already made ones at the grocery store is just way too pricey! much better to make them at home.  thank you!

Will some changes this recipe came out really good.  I took other's advice and substituted imitation crab, nixed the water chestnuts, and added plenty of green onions.  Next time I will cut the crabmeat as small as possible to make creamier.

This is a very good crab rangoon I followed the advice of another review and added more cream cheese (another block) and green onion (fom my own garden!) I also omitted the water chestnuts.  I will never gorge myself at the Chinese buffet again, when I can make these at home! YUM

This was really good! I changed it to fit my taste but the recipe is good on its own. I prefer a more cream cheese rangoon so I only used 3 ounces of crab meat. I'm not a fan of water chestnuts so I left them out. A restaurant owner told me that imitation crab is better than real crab for this dish because real crab changes the taste too much. I scooped about half a teaspoon for each wrap to ensure they didn't bust open. I'm thrilled to finally be able to make crab rangoon the way I like it. Thanks for the recipe!

There was way to much crab not enough cream cheese and they were really blagh, they need more flavor like green onions and maybe some soy sauce and I am not sure what else but it's definitely missing a few things.

We added chopped green onion and a bit of soy sauce to the mixture for extra flavor. We also pressed the edges of the wonton down with the tines of a fork in order to seal them better. They wer delicious!

It's an awesome recipe! I put in more seasonings though. Without a thermometer, it was pretty tricky getting the oil perfect. I suggest starting lower than medium, then working your way higher. Also, don't overfill the wrappers, when it opens in the oil it'll pop everywhere!

Made this last night.... I added  green onions and  some sweet chilli  sauce  for dipping. I left out the water chesnuts and paprika.... I will be using this recipe many, many more times!                                                       They tasted just like what you get at a chinese restraunt. Very yummy!

I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and omitted the water chestnuts, and doubled the cream cheese and added green onion and what I got was an awesome crab rangoon that was still plenty crabalicious! I did a slightly more than 2x the recipe(2.5 I guess) and I came out with enough to feed 25 people a couple, so if you are wanting enough for a large family, go easy on this one. It makes a TON!

These were so good! I made my own wonton wrappers, and I baked them at 375 for 15min until they just started getting browned.  I sprayed them with olive oil cooking spray before putting in the oven. The filling was so tasty, my son & I really loved these.

Suprisingly really good!  Crab Rangoon is my favorite thing from Chinese food restaurants back home and its hard to find anything comparable where I am now... My boyfriend loved them and he's skeptical of a lot of things I make for the first time - Definately going to make these again.

I used shallots instead of garlic and/or green onion, and I had an epiphany for those of you saying "something is missing".  That sweetness & missing flavor is teryaki sauce!  A tablespoon worked for me.  Fantastic!

I baked instead of frying, but I wouldn't recommend that.. Next time i will deep fry like the instructions. I also omitted the water chestnuts. The filling was ok, but next time I would add about a quarter cup of sugar just to stabilize the flavors. I only used one can of white crab meat and did not notice the "crab taste". Not bad for homemade version

This recipe is good. I personally used 4 oz imitation crab meat, added some green onions, doubled the paprika and the garlic. They were a hit with everyone... not too crabby or runny, but the taste of crab was definately detectable.

We LOVED it!!!!  I substituted water chestnuts for onions but I still think it's a good recipe because it's versatile.  Oh yeah, also I used one beaten egg to seal them.  This help with spillage!!!

The over all concept is great! I did add scallions and more cream cheese than crab. My shells blew up and all my mixtures can out. I think it was because I let it set in the frig for a while after I had prepared before I fried them. I'll try again and cook them right away.

Crabby taste. I've even halved the crab but it was still a bit strong. Adding green onions is a plus. I think next time I will omit the crab and chestnuts.

Very good recipe...followed someone elses instructions on adding 1 tablespoon of soy sauce.  Didnt care for the color but it was really good.  I ended up making a second batch without it and preferred it just as well.  Rated it a 4 only because of my modification.  I only used 1/2 8 oz pkg of imitation crab meat I do know with the amount of crabmeat called for in this recipe it would have been too crabby for me.  I too added chopped green onions aprox 1/2 cup.  I do prefer the cream cheese taste in my rangoons.  Very good recipe.

This was very generic. As others have said, halve the crabmeat for a stronger cream cheese flavor. Next time I make this I will add chopped spring onions and 1t of worcestershire sauce.   Overall, it's not a bad recipe. Just needs some more flavor. Maybe a GREAT sauce can bring this up to 5 stars.

I did what others suggested and cut the amount of crab meat down to 1-6 ounce can, added 1/4 cup chopped green onions instead of water chesnuts and added more sugar and they turned out great.  I kept adding a tsp of sugar to the mix until I got it sweet enough to our liking, which was 7 tsp.  The only criticizism I had was that they were a little oily on the inside even though I let them drain plenty so next time I will try them in the oven.  Also, a lot of the filling was evaporated when I fried them.  Got "Mmmmmm" from the little one that loves them from a restaurant though.

I didn't use water chestnuts, but I added green onions for color and flavor.  The first time I made these, I baked them for a party and they went fast.  Last weekend, my husband wanted to try them fried and they went even faster.  I served these with a sweet chili sauce from a jar.

These were amazing!!  I took the advice of one of the reviews and used the Philadelphia onion/chive cream cheese (2 small containers), used only 1 can of crab and then added the paprika and garlic powder.    I also baked them, and they came out nice and crispy!  My kids can't stop eating them!   I also made the "quick dipping sauce" from this site to dip them in!

I took a lot of the suggestions into account when I made this: I used only 4 oz of imitation crab meat, 2 (8 oz) packages of cream cheese, and left out the water chestnuts. I added in green onions.   I made a tight seal with a mixture of water and flour and pinched it closed. I also put them in the freezer for a few minutes so I wouldn't have problems with the filling oozing.  This made SO much!! I used the whole package of wonton wrappers!! I'm thinking about freezing some to see how they turn out.

These were a big hit at my house!  They were surprisingly easy to put together (even for me, a first time wonton-user and first time fryer!) and tasted great.  I used 12 oz cream cheese and omitted the water chestnuts.  The only thing I will change next time is to half the recipe because this makes so much!

These were just OK.  I really enjoy the "cheesyness" of the rangoons in the restaurant.  These had a little too much seasoning, and didn't have that same taste.  I used imitation crab meat, and left out the water chestnuts.  I also added some green onion.  Still, they just didn't taste cheesy enough.

Wow!  These were absolutely fabulous!  My husband made them, but tweaked just a little.  He added about a teaspoon of splenda because we like ours on the sweet side.  He also made a great dipping sauce that was a mixture of soy sauce, garlic powder, honey, molasses and a very tiny bit of vinegar.  We will be making these again!

I just made these for dinner but I think they really needed some salt.  Next time I make them I will add 1 tsp salt to the mixture before filling.

We baked instead of fried. Also, couldn't find wonton wrappers so settled for philo dough. Next time I may go to a oriental store to see if they have wonton wrappers.  My boyfriend thinks fake crab would be better than real. We forgot to put the spices in! They were kind of pale, spices would add more. These were neat, the baking option was a real plus.

Really good. Has potential for many variations. I baked them as suggested by one review. I also had a bit of mixture left over so I baked two wrappers and spread the mixture on top and I liked the crunch of the wrapper with the room temperature mix even better.
Made a new variation tonight - I toasted English muffins, spread the filling on top and toasted again.  The kids loved them !!

These tasted a lot like the ones I get from my fav Chinese place.  My ONLY complaint was that by the time you fried them most of the filling spilled out or was mush.  I think you may need a higher oil temp to fry them so it doesn't mush the insides.  Otherwise, really tasty recipe.

This recipe is GREAT!  I never made Crab Rangoon before and was very happy with the results!  I followed some of the other reviewers and changed it to 2 blocks of cream cheese and I used the imitation crab as opposed to the real stuff.  I used almost one full 8oz package of that and kept the spices the same, although, I also substituted scallions for the water chestnuts.  I found if you fry them in a deep fryer, there is NO WAY that they need to be in there for 3 minutes.  They fry up really fast and if left in 3 minutes, they will be charred.  The recipe in my package of won ton wrappers was almost the same as this one, although, called for steak sauce???  So instead of that....for some of the very last ones, I added a little worstershire sauce.  BOTH types turned out excellent.  I can't wait until my husband gets home to try them!  Thanks for submitting this recipe!!

These taste exactly like I got them at a restaurant - a really good restaurant!  I used 1 can crabmeat, left out the chestnuts, added green onion.  Make sure you let the oil get hot between batches otherwise the filling would come out.

Very good recipe.  The taste is real close to what you get in the restaurants. However, it was a little too much crab for our liking.  I'm going to make them again using one 6oz. can of crab!  Definitely worth a try!

I used one can of very well drained crab to one package of cream cheese with 1/3 cup mayo. Scallions are a must along with dashes of garlic powder, soy sauce, hot sauce, salt, pepper and worchestire. I like lots of flavor and this made the rangoon way better (followed recipe the first batch). Using a mixer makes filling creamy and pinch edges of wonton hard so they don't leak out. Sprinkle ground sea salt on wonton after frying. Yum!

i love the ones from the chinese resturant, so decided to try it. my husband ended up making them, but they turned out very grainy. not sure if it was the store brand cream cheese, the canned crab, or the way they were mixed, but probably won't be making again.

I should have gone with some of the other suggestions and added some soy sauce and or green onion.  This was okay as is, a little too crabby for me maybe, what can I say, I like the "cheap Chinese food" version that I get down the street...  I don't know what went wrong exactly but my wrappers kept exploding, I think they were close to being too old, next time I will buy fresh, I just fried up strips of wonton and made it like "chips and dip."  Not bad but I would probably find a different recipe next time or modify this one a bit.

I made these for a party and they were a huge hit!  As per reviews, I omitted water chestnuts, cut crab meat down to one can, and included about 1/2 cup green onions.  I folded the corners up into an "X" shape and sealed them tightly, and they came out beautifully.  Absolutely delicious, as good or better than the restaurants!

EASY AND DELICIOUS!  I really loved these.  I did not add water chesnuts but I did add green onion and I thought they were perfect.  I was in a serious time crunch and these made a large amount in a decent amount of time.  WONDERFUL.

I took other's suggestions about using less crab and more cream cheese and the flavor was perfect for my taste.  I baked them at 375* for about 10-15 minutes and they turned out alright (frying of course would be better--I just wanted a healthier method).  They were a little chewy but otherwise the flavor was excellent.  The only problem I had was the bottoms popping open.  I sealed the wontons with egg and even double wrapped them.  Any suggestions on how to avoid this problem?  Thanks!!

I'll add to the list of people changing the recipe and then reviewing it. I used a little more than half a can of crab to 8 oz cream cheese, omitted water chestnuts, added chopped scallions, touch of minced garlic, worchestire, and tsp of soy. They take a little time to assemble but it's half the fun! So glad I decided to make these!

I changed a lot about this so I dont know if I should actually be reviewing this recipe but oh well here it goes. I used 1 8 ounce package artifical crab meat, 2 packages cream cheese, half of a small onion, 2 cloves garlic, 4 green onions for the filling and then used the wonton wrappers recipe found on this site and they were wonderful. I suggest using sesame oil for frying because they taste more authintic compared to vegtable oil.

We thought these were good.  The only thing I did different was I used a container of fresh crabmeat.  It was only 6 oz but I think there was more in it than 2 cans of canned crab.  They were not as creamy as they are from a resaurant, more crabby.  They were the perfect partner to the Orange Teriyaki Beef Noodle Bowl (recipe from The Quality Cook).  I liked the little crunch that the water chestnuts gave them.  They did take a long time to make.  But I would probably do it again.  I did use a deep fryer to fry them in.....there was no problem getting them done right.  Thanks for the great recipe, La Vaun.

These were awesome, took a little time to put together, but we were expecting that!  Only change i will make is next time we will probably use the imitation crab, because we dont' care too much for the canned.  All in all an excellent recipe!

The texture was a bit dry.  I guess I'm just used to restaurant crab rangoon that barely has any crab.  Seems theirs is mostly cream cheese.  Makes a great dip too!

I used imitation crab meat, 2 packs of cream cheese, 1 green onion, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp black pepper and 1/4 tsp paprika.  All of this filled 1 pack of wonton skins.  There was not enough crabby flavor and I more than doubled my imitation crab.  Next time I will try 'real' crab.  They were all eaten though, and I had a lot of people over!

This recipe was pretty good. I baked it instead of frying it like another reviewer suggested. I used only 6 oz. of crab and used 12 oz. of cream cheese and still thought it was too crabby. Next time I will use even less crab.

I thought that this was wonderful!  This has always been a favorite of mine & now I have a great recipe to go along with it.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe at all the first time I made it. I might add some finely chopped green onion next time!!

Very good. Used a little onion in place of the water chestnuts. Don't put to much filling b/c they'll explode in your fryer. I froze 1/2 of these in a single layer(so they don't stick together) so I wouldn't have to cook all of these at once. They tasted just as great frozen,even when a couple of them stuck together.

Best homemade crab rangoons I've made yet!  I did some substitutions - 1/2 can of immitation crab meat with 1 8oz. pkg. of cream cheese and omitted the water chestnuts for scallions.  Came out great!

I love this recipe! it had a very good texture, but this does make a lot, so next time i will decrease the amt of ingredients. i added minced onions instead of paprika and fried in peanut oil...very tasty. i also used Linda's sweet and sour sauce from this site as a dipping sauce and it was a big hit with the family. will try again :)

EXCELLENT!! I prefer lump crabmeat, so I used one can of that (rather than two), and I omitted the water chestnuts. The wontons were a bit fragile in the oil and some of them leaked, but overall they held together pretty well. They tasted awesome, too!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

This is a good basic recipe. I cut the crab down to 1/4 of a can as other reviewers suggested. I left out the water chesnuts and added a tablespoon of soy sauce. Delicious! The wontons are thinner, but I think that allows you to taste the filling more. Thanks!

Very good recipe. I did change a couple of things. I omitted the water chestnuts and added some honey, about 3 tbls to the cream cheese mixture. They are delicious with the honey in them. Thank you for sharing!

Way too much crab.  Definitely needed more cream cheese.  My first batch got too dark so I fried them only 2 to 3 minutes and they were okay.  They didn't taste anything like chinese restaraunts, though.  I didn't like the flavor.  I won't make this recipe again.

WAY TOO MUCH CRAB.  You have to REALLY like crab to enjoy this dish.  But with some modifications it does resenble the crab rangoon you will find in a restaurant.  My verdict is that is is time consuming and messy work and I would rather go to a restaurant and be served crab rangoon.

This was very good. However, I ending up baking them in oil instead of frying them to try and cut down on some fat and calories. I've had better, but I would probably make this again.

I made these without the water chestnuts and used my air fryer. I was able to really stuff these without the oil making them bleed out. These are a great substitute for take out and being air fried makes them healthier. I will make again. Thanks for the recipe!

These were delicious! Even my husband, who doesn't usually care for crab cheese wontons, raved about them. There are a lot of complaints here about the crab/cheese ratio but that's exactly what makes them so good! It seems like there's crab rangoon, then there's crab-cheese wontons. The latter is what I consider to be served by most take-out places (probably because it's cheaper) and many forgo the crab altogether. Sometimes you're lucky if there's a tsp of filling and you're basically eating a fried wonton wrapper. These are more like what you get at PF Chang's. They are flavorful enough that you don't have to keep slathering them in sauce before every bite. ?? I did add some green onion, which I recommend for a little color. Yum. Thanks for the recipe!

I took the advice of other reviewers and halved the crab meat while doubling the cream cheese. I didn’t use water chestnuts because I don’t like them. Also, I forgot green onions at the store and didn’t feel like going back, so I just threw in some onion power. Turned out creamy and everyone loved them!

I didn't care for the taste at all, but I could probably use the recipe as a start for coming up with the taste I like. I don't like the sweet crab rangoon some places serve, but this was way too much garlic and I'm a garlic lover. I agree with some others that it was not enough cream cheese. Other than me not being crazy about the taste it was a super easy recipe - I left out the water chestnuts and added a little green onion and it wasn't crumbly at all. I think next time I'll do one can of crab and 1/2 the called for garlic. Fun to make and my family did like them.

Always a hit when I make these for parties. I don't add the paprika, I substitute the water chestnut for finely chopped green onion. I prefer using packaged imitation crab.

I will never eat crab rangoons from the restaurant again. I took the advise of some of the other reviews and doubled the cream cheese while halving the crab. I also baked the wontons for the first batch. They were good but the wonton wasn't as crispy/crunchy as when fried, so the next batch was fried, not as healthy but way better wrapper. Makes around 50 rangoons I didn't count but the wonton wrapper pack only had 14 left when i was done filling them. I froze the extras but dry the wontons out before doing so, I didn't fully dry some and they stuck together like crazy, but the rangoons that were completely dry before being frozen didn't.

Great, amazing!! Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I tweaked the recipe. With the advice of some othe reviewers I only used 1 can of crab meat and made sure to drain it really good!!  Also make sure to deal the wraps with water really good, otherwise they will explode during the frying process.

I've tried several recipes....made as is, these are good but to me taste a little flat....much like the average ones I get at my local China King.
I added a tablespoon of finely chipped green onions, a dash of cayenne and about 2 tsp of honey the last time.  Oh, and I DO like the water chestnuts for texture.
Still not a 5 even with the tweaks, but getting closer.  The sweetness of the honey really highlights the sweetness of the crab but then I felt like a needed a hint of salt...maybe 1/2 tsp of soy sauce or fish sauce?

These turned out great for a holiday meal. I used imitation crabmeat (surimi) this time instead of canned, which gave it a bit better balance: milder crab flavor and less moisture with the same ratio of meat to cream cheese. No problems with leakage and a restaurant-quality final product. Thanks!

This is a great recipe.  We did not add the water chestnuts and did add some sugar and some pepper.

Loved it adjusted the time and I didn't add the water chestnuts. This is a basic recipe and it works with adding onion powder and using more or less crab.

Good, however time-consuming, and not as sweet as I'd prefer. I may make them again but will have to find some sort of sweetener to add to the mix.

Disappointed. I expected something better because it had the ingredients I was looking for. Won't make again and will just stick with crab dips instead.

Wow, so good! I only used one 6oz. can of crab meat for these because I didn't want them too 'crabby', left out the water chestnuts and added a tsp. of soy sauce. One of my sons (the one I was afraid, would think them too crabby) said they were better than the restaurant ones he's had. When I sealed my wrappers I used about 2Tb spoons of cornstarch dissolved in a little water instead of just plain water to seal the wrapper edges. It does help make a little better seal and the filling pretty much stayed in all but a couple of them.

I am not sure what I did wrong but the wontons were empty by the time I pulled them out of the fryer;(  If we did the triangle form there was a little filling left but not much. We did the two cans since we like it crabby. I wonder if we didn't strain enough water off the cans? Any ideas or comments?

This recipe was OK but does not taste like the real thing so I changed a few things.  I took the suggestions of some other reviewers and added green onions, extra garlic powder and only used 1 can of crabmeat.  It still didn't taste like the crab rangoon that we get from our favorite Chinese restaurant.

We loved this!  I made a couple of changes.  Because I like less crab and a creamier texture, I only used half of one can of crabmeat and added 1 tsp. of sugar.  I had the oil really hot and they only fried for a minute or less but they were perfect.  Didn't even need sweet and sour sauce.

It was almost as good as the ones in the Chinese restaurant, but too crabby. I already halved the crab but was still too crabby, may do a package and a half of cream cheese next time, but still really yummy!

I would not suggest using 2 cans of crabmeat - but other than that - this was great.  Finally got by husband to try chinese, drawback is that i have to make it now.  This recipe will be a keeper.  If you do not have water chestnuts it's ok to omit, but if you have green onion on hand finely dice them up and put them in - they are good as well.

Outstanding! Better than the restaurants because we didn't have to leave our house to get our fix. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Too much crab and has a slightly "off" taste. Not what I usually find at Chinese restaurants

Very easy to make and tasted just as good, if not better than from a restaurant.  The only change I made was not using the water chestnuts because I do not care for them.  Will definitely make again!

These are a great base recipe.  I agree with others, it needs less crab.  I used about 1/2 of what it called for and it's still pretty strong.  I did both baked & fried, and while both are good, the fried are much better!  I added the green onions also.  It's good, but not what I was expecting.  I need something more cheesy I think.  I'll make them again while I'm trying to find the exact ones I get at our local Chinese place.

These crab rangoons have been such a hit with my family and friends! I made three trays worth for our Christmas Eve party and every rangoon was gone!    We did change the recipe a bit though, instead of water chestnuts we used finely chopped green onions and we used 2.5 (8oz) packages of cream cheese. They tasted amazing, I haven't even had one at a restaurant that I've liked better. Highly recommended recipe! Enjoy!

Crab Rangoon tastes just as good, if not better, when the fried treats are completely cooled.  If you leave them to cool in the open air, the wonton will stay crispy while the cream cheese mixture will regain some of its solid composure.  I'm not a big water chestnut fan, so I used a heaping amount of green onions.  I was also generous with the garlic powder.  Magnifique!  This recipe turned out better than most frozen prepared appetizers I've bought.

I rarely ever cook and I made this! My family loved it! I made it exactly as it said to make it and it tasted just like a Chinese restaurant crab rangoon. I was very impressed by this recipe. I will be making this again!

This is a really good recipe!  However!  If you want them to taste more like what you get in the restaurant, you should drastically cut the amount of crab.  I also added a bit of chives and a splash of Worcestshire Sauce

The recipe was much easier than I thought.  I did use less crab as a few others suggested.  I also fried some and baked some to see which had a better texture and crispiness.  My family definitely preferred the fried ones.

Good starter for recipe but it needed some work. First off, that is way too much crab for the amount of cream cheese. I would use a lot less or it will have too much of a fishy taste. Also, I added some sugar (to taste) because of all the rangoon I've ever had I like more of a sweet creamy taste and it tasted awesome. Plus if you wanna make it easier I would throw them in the deep fryer and go about 4 minutes or so.

This is a great recipe!  Anything I can freeze and store for later use it great with two kids! :)  I left out the waterchest nuts since I didn't have any on hand.  But to give it a kick I added chopped jalapenos!  YUMMY!!!  Thank you La Vaun!

I chose to try this recipe because it is simular to another recipe that I created and love. In my recipe, you mix 2 cans crab meat with an 8 oz. package of cream cheese, refridgerate for an hour and pour cocktail sauce over it. Serve with Triscuts. I did not change anything about this recipe except leaving out the water chestnuts. My first review is with cocktail sauce. 5 star! Wonderful, Sweet & Sour Sauce 4 Star, and the final sauce is with Toasted Sesame Soy and Ginger 3 Star. Over all, the dish with no sauce is a 4 Star. Since it does say serve with your choice of sauces this is where it gets a 5 Star!

The filling is amazing. I did what other users described. I tried baking them to save the calories and it didn't work at all! The outside was hard. I guess I have to fry them. (later fried them and they were GREAT)   I made 55 of them and used 2 bricks of low fat cream cheese, one can of crab meat 2 stalks of green onion, and spices.

I used packaged crab instead of canned I also thought this recipe was too crabby.  I added double the cream cheese.  This is a great started recipe.  It depends on your taste buds, but it was too crabby for my family.

My boyfriend absolutely loved these! He had been asking me to make chinese food and crab rangoons for a couple weeks and I finally looked up a recipe.  They weren't too time consuming once I got the hang of it and cooked in no time in a deep fryer.  I didn't think they tasted like the ones from any restaurant but they were good.  I swear my boyfriend ate 20 of them that night and has been telling everyone how great they were.  He won't stop bugging me to make them again!

My friends loved this one!  I served at a "girls night" gathering at my home and these were a big hit.  I did not use water chestnuts because I did not have any and I baked them in my mini cupcake pan (instead of frying)and they were just perfect!  Even my 7 year old daughter ate them up.

I'm glad I read the reviews before making this.  I also used just one can of crab and definitely think two would have been too much.  The soy sauce suggestion was good too.  This was a lot of fun to make and everyone loved it!

After making this a few times I did tweak some things. I only use 1 can of crab meat- 2 would be so overwhelming! Sometimes I use smoked paprika instead of regular paprika- it gives it a nice taste. Of course frying them tastes better but basting them with a little egg and baking them is still really good.

This recipe was really good. The only things I changed was leaving out the water chestnuts and I would recommend using the frozen packaged imitation crab (I used about 1/2 package) instead of the canned stuff.  This will keep them from popping as much while cooking and tastes just as good.

These had a lot more crab than the rangoons I've purchased in the past.  Very good.  Next time I'll use half of the crab because I had a lot of filling. Mine didn't fall apart. Thanks.

These will save me about a million dollars in take-out! I read the other reviews and baked them rather than frying. I made a small batch, since it's just my roommate and me, and used 1/2 can of crab to 1/2 tub of cream cheese. I was liberal with the garlic and green onions as well. Loved these and will make them again! Do not overstuff (I got a bit overzealous), or they will definitely leak.

I tried this and it didnt turn out good at all... I tried someone else's version and baked them and it was not good...you couldn't even taste the mix.  I will try again but deep fry.  I gave 3 stars cause the mixture I tasted was good.  I did try to pan fry some and it didnt come out good at all, some mixture came out.  I will try again!

This was my first time making them.. Had a family chinese night and my job was making these rangoon.I as well did like many other readers did,omit the water chestnuts and added green onions and little more cream cheese.I started folding them like the X as well but found it takes to long to do,so I just folded them in half.Had mix left over so my boyfriend said he will eat it with crackers.Long story short flavor not bad at all,they also heat up nicely if you have leftovers. Still say China Rose In Gray Maine has the best CRAB RANGOONS !!!!

Was VERY disappointed. I changed the recipe some, added 2 tgings of cream cheese and one of 8 oz crab. It looked to crabby. I was right. I added tonys chacheres seasoning, its something from Louisiana that we put on EVERYTHING, this helped by adding a little flavor. I baked them instead of frying since there were so many reviews about the filing oozing out. I put them in the freezer over night so the wrappers would hold better. Will not cook again and have a tray full in freezer left. The filling was okay.

I omitted the crab and water chestnuts, added chopped green onion, and doubled the cream cheese and spices.  This made enough filling for about 24 puffs, which was only half the package of wonton wrappers.  My family loved them including my four year old and they were gone in minutes.  I made the Sweet & Sour Sauce II to go with them but they were just fine plain.  Will be making again.

Delicious. I didn't add the water chestnuts because my roommate doesn't like them.  I added a small amount of green onions and garlic.  They make enough to freeze for the next few times you make chinese food or just want a snack.

These really are really good!  I (like some of the other reviewers) also added some green onion.  I also added a tsp of sugar.  I'm sure they would have been good sticking to the recipe, but I felt the additions were mmmm, mmm, good!!

Very good!  I added chopped scallions to the cream cheese mixture and left out the water chestnuts.  I also used only 1 can of crab meat as some suggested.  We ate these with a delicious store bought plum sauce.  Good!

Yum!  These were great!  I only used 1 can of crab meat and left out the water chestnuts, and it was perfect.  My biggest struggle with this recipe was figuring out how to fold the wrappers!  Served with Cashew Chicken with Water Chestnuts from this site.  Great meal!  We'll be having this again.

I left out the water chestnuts, and added onion powder and parsley flakes. Even though the first couple "test" ones leaked out in the fryer, the rest were pretty darned good. I followed other reviewer's advice, to squeeze all the water out of the crab. I wrapped it in several paper towels and squeezed until no more drips. After the test ones leaked, I added a Tablespoon of cornstarch to the rest of the filling, ahhhh... success. My husband and daughter said they were better than {insert the take out place I usually get them from}. I served them with  turkey and shrimp eggrolls, pork wontons, pork and shrimp Gyoza, fried rice, and stir fried bok choy and carrots. For dipping sauces, I made Gyoza Sauce and Sweet Chili Thai Sauce also from this website.

I decided to try this because I don't eat crab meat and I have not been able to find a restaurant that has only cream cheese. so of course I eliminated the crab and also the chestnuts and I added some scallions. I baked half the batch and then fried half and of course everything is better when it's marinated in grease! so long story short, I will definately make these again.

I used imitation crab instead of canned because it's less mushy. I just used cream cheese, finely chopped green onions, and imitation crab meat and it tasted decent. I added how much of everything to my taste because I prefer more cream cheese in it.

Tasty and super easy to make. I used baby shrimp instead of crab. I keep a big bag of baby frozen shrimp from Costco in my freezer, so I just defrosted a handfull of those, chopped up small and mixed them with the cream cheese.

These are GREAT!!!! I had no water chestnuts and were just fine without. They go perfect with SpringField Cashew Chicken and a bed of fried rice. It makes A LOT! My family loved all three of these recipes together and we made them 2 days in a row we loved them so much and all 3 recipes have been requester on our weekly menu by the teenagers and my husband. LOL! ENJOY!!!

DS loves these!  The default recipe with 15 servings is definitely way too much for the three of us, so I use one can of crab meat and a half a package of cream cheese.  I leave out the water chestnuts.

This was O.K.. I didn't have any water chestnuts but it still came out good. The only problem I had when makin these was that the rangoon kept popping during frying. Maybe I closed them to tightly?

I leave out the water chestnuts because of my picky eaters. Then I have to be careful to get away quickly with all my fingers. The crowds devour them. A yummy addition to an Asian dinner or just as a tasty snack because we don't "DO" boring snacks in our house. Thank you.

If there were a 10 star rating..that is what I'd give. The only changes..since we do not like water chestnuts I added chopped green onion instead. Use the same amt. of green onion as you would water chestnuts. A little time consuming but well worth it!!

These were so good. I took them to a silent auction as an appetizer and they were the first thing to go (and I had even doubled the recipe). Very easy although a little time-consuming filling the wraps but soooo worth it.

The only change I made is I used imitation crabmeat instead of the canned, and I sprayed them with butter spray and baked at 375* for 15 minutes. I served this with Sweet and Sour Sauce II from this site and people seemed to enjoy them. They are rather time consuming to make though; not sure if I'll make these again.

This was absolutely delicious! I cut the recipe in half to try it out for my husband and me before serving at an upcoming party. I omitted the water chestnuts and added green onions. I don't have a deep fryer so I just fried on the stove top in about 3 c of oil, and they turned out great. Thanks!

If I could give 3.5 stars, I would.  These took me a long time to put together and for the amount of work, I wasn't impressed.  I'll just keep buying them from our favorite chinese take out.

This is a wonderful yet simple crowd pleaser. Several members of my family are not big seafood fans, so I simply omitted one can of the crabmeat to tone it down a bit and it worked great!

Absolutely loved this recipe. I substituted the water chestnuts for finely chopped carrots and cabbage, just to keep that crunch. Easy to cook up for unexpected guest.

A great recipe, with the suggestions provided by others on the site. I used only 1 can of crab meat and substituted green onions for the water chestnuts.  The changes provided just the right constency.

Good recipe.  I added a dash of Worchester (sp?) sauce for flavor and only added 1 can of crabmeat.  It was still a little too crabby for me because I was expecting the flavor of crab rangoons from the restaurants.  My fiance thought it had just the right amount of crab. It was great served with the Plum Sauce recipe I also found on allrecipes.

The oil was WAY too hot at 350F.  My wontons cooked in 30 seconds.  If I make this again, I will only heat the oil to 300F. The mixture was good though - just didn't taste very good in burnt wonton wraps.

I used 2 cans of crabmeat, but thought it tasted a little, dry? Seems like I could have added worchestire sauce to add more flavor to it, seemed too bland. Thanks though!

We loved these, used canned crab and mixed a little honey in with them.  We didn't have a problem with them burning, used our deep fat fryer.  Turned out delish.

We used the cream cheese, 1/4 of a 1.5lb. pkg. of imitation crab and the garlic powder.  We were really happy with the taste!  However, we're going to lower the temp of the oil next time, as these seemed to burn too quickly.  We fried enough for this meal, and we will freeze the rest and fry them when we're ready, as this recipe makes a ton! 
Oh! And we couldn't find Wonton wrappers in our grocery store, so we used Egg roll wrappers, cut them in fours and they worked great!

I made this tonight with some of the same tweaks that other people used.  I substituted onion powder for the paprika and used only one can of crab and left out the water chestnuts because we don't like them.  They were delicious.  I used a small cookie dough scoop to fill them, and water to seal the edges and didn't have a problem with them breaking or leaking.

These were great.  I left out the water chestnuts...they just didn't seem right in there.  Other than that, left everything the same (and let hubby fry to avoid more disaster on my part...I always burn myself frying).  Turned out just as we expected.

Disappointing. I halved the posted recipe, and made half without the water chestnuts because Husband wasn't keen on the idea. I preferred the batch without chestnuts, but I didn't find either kind particularly flavorsome; I could barely taste the crab at all. I won't be making these again. Thanks, anyway.

this was a great recipe. the only things i did differently was use imitation crab meat instead of the real stuff, too much of a fishy taste with the real. and for a little bit of a creamier filling i used one and a half to two things of cream cheese.and no water chestnuts

This recipe was pretty good, but I read other reviews and sort of changed it.  I used more cream cheese and less crab meat.  They were quick and easy to make and my son and I loved them.  Thank you.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. I used half the crab that the recipe called for and they still had too much of a funky crab taste. My husband wouldn't go near them and I ended up throwing half of them away. I thought they were ok, but nothing near as good as the crab rangoon in Chinese restaurants.
