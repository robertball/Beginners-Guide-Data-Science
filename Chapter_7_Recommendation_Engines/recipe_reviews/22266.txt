I love Carrot Cake, but hate shredding those carrots. So, when I make a carrot cake, I want it to be GOOD. This one is delicious. I served it after Christmas Dinner and got 2 "THIS IS THE BEST carrot cake I have ever had" responses!!!

I tried this recipe today and it was really delicious.  Very moist and not as heavy as my old recipe.  The buttermilk glaze is easy and tastes great on this cake.  Much lighter than the usual cream cheese frosting. Made it for Super Bowl Sunday and everyone loves it! Thanks

This is the best carrot cake that I have ever tasted. I made it with cream cheese frosting and it was absolutely delicious. My friends were also amazed at how nice it was.

My 19 yr old son requested carrot cake for his birthday. I just made this cake. I made it exactly like the recipe says, even sifted the flour like it said to do. I didn't have crushed pineapple but I had chunked. I drained the pineapple and put it in a blender to "crush" it. The cake was so moist! My family loved it. I used the traditional Betty Crocker recipe for Cream Cheese frosting as he requested the "rich stuff". My sons said I should go into the bakery business. This is a real keeper! Thank you!

To all who are thinking of making this cake....It is topped with a buttermilk glaze. A lot of people prefer a carrot cake with cream cheese icing, but at least try this one with the glaze. The glaze, in my opinion, is what really makes this carrot cake stand out from other carrot cakes. It's absolutely amazing! Every time I make this cake it is a huge hit. I have been asked for my recipe countless times. I also love carrot cake with cream cheese icing and did try it on my cake once. It was good, but not nearly as good as it is with the glaze. Try it and see for yourself.

This is the same recipe I have used for years.  It is excellent as it is. However, my mother or I have made some changes that we think make it even better.  I get raves for my cake so it must have worked.  First I use all dark brown suger.  If your not sure try half white, half brown at first.  Then as so many others have done I reduced the oil in half and added that amount of applesauce  instead. I also use l tsp cinnamon and l tsp pumpkin pie spice.  It sparks it up nicely. In our family it is called the dangerous carrot cake because it is so good it is a danger to all resolve to modration.

This was great! Just the recipe I was looking for. My mother-in-law used to make it but I couldn't find my recipe. I used a 10 oz.bag of shredded carrots and baked in a bundt pan. Everyone that has tried it wants the recipe.

This is very moist and good.  I will use this recipe again.  I used pecans as I did not have walnuts. As I was making this I realized my can of pineapple was 20 oz, so I just used it.  As far as texture, you could not ask for a more "moist" cake.  The changes I will make next time is add some raisins and a little more spice, just as that is a personal preferance.  I did not use the glaze.. we like cream cheese frosting.  I use 1 stick butter, 2 cream cheese, 2 cups of powder sugar, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla for my frosting.  Thanks! UPDATE:: I just took a piece out of fridge this morning.. ok the spice sets in this totally rocks the second day even more!!  I just changed from 4 to 5 stars.

I have to admit I haven't tried the cake part of the this recipe.  I wanted a buttermilk glaze for another carrot cake recipe I use and found this one to be much better than the traditional cream cheese frosting. My husband loves this glaze too.  I will try the cake recipe.

Wonderful!  I baked mine in 2 round cake pans for a round layered cake.  I substituted chopped, toasted pecans for the walnuts and reduced the amount of pineapple to 1 cup or an 8 oz. can.  I used the frosting recipe from the recipe on this site called "Awesome Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting" which is a traditional cream cheese frosting.

This really is the best carrot cake in the world! Thanks so much, heybejay, for sharing it with us. I made a few changes, but I'm sure the recipe is absolutely wonderful with no changes.

I love so many things about this carrot cake: It is lushly moist (but not sticky); you can taste the carrots, pineapple, coconut, and nuts (but none are overpowering); unlike so many other carrot cakes, this one is not dry and it's not oily, either; the tasty glaze is such a welcome change from the typical (and uninspired) cream cheese frosting.

this cake is BOMB! I made only a couple of changes due to what I had on hand. I didn't use any oil, because I never bake with oil. I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce to replace the cup of oil. I also only had an 8oz can of crushed pineapple.  Las change was adding 1/4 tsp of ginger and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg because we like spice cake flavor :) The cake was super moist and very tasty! Thank you!

Awesome, made it as cupcakes with cream cheese frosting for my hubby's birthday and he loved them.  I did add a little ginger and nutmeg because he likes it that way.

I made this for my grown son's birthday because Carrot Cake is his favorite. I have never been fond of it though. I followed the recipe exactly including the glaze. I was torn on that because cream cheese frosting is so traditional. I am so glad I did exactly what the recipe said to do. This cake was SO good. Everyone loved it!  Even me! I will definitely make this again. Thank you for the great recipe!

Very good.  Not as 'greasy' as other carrot cakes I've tried.  I made into cupcakes, 20 minutes or so at 350 was perfect.  

I did tweak slightly by adding 1 tsp of nutmeg and 1/2 cup of raisins.  

Good recipe and I'm very pleased I tried it.

This is the absolute BEST cake I have ever made! This is my new standby for when I need to bring a desert to an event--thanks for a wonderful recipe.
Also, the glaze in this recipe can be used on other cakes--It's delicious on a chocolate cake.

This cake was very good but I found the glaze to make it a bit greasy. Next time I make it I will use an icing instead.

This IS the best carrot cake recipe! I have made it several times and it is always a hit. This is a fantastic recipe! Thanks for sharing it!

I did make two changes. I added walnuts (I didn't have pecans) instead of pecans and I added raisins (like raisins in my carrot cake!)

And instead of using the frosting recipe, I used a cream cheese frosting. (Really like that addition to carrot cake, personally.)

AWESOME cake!! This was my first time making a carrot cake from scratch and I won't be using any other recipe besides this one. The only things I changed was I used 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce (just makes it a little healthier) and I added a touch of salt and 1 tsp baking powder. I like cream cheese icing, so I haven't tried the glaze yet but I might next time.

I made this for my husband's birthday, and it was fabulous. I made the traditional cream cheese frosting for it; it didn't overwhelm the cake's flavor or texture. Moist and overall delicious; this one's a keeper!

I run the kitchen in a convent for nuns and I made this carrot cake into cupcakes for Easter dinner and frosted it with a cinnamon cream cheese butter cream instead of the glaze. It was the best carrot cake I've ever had. The sisters loved it, they said it was comfort food at it's best! Thank You!

This is a great recipe. I have baked for many years and this is the first carrot cake recipe I've tried. I must admit I didn't use the glaze and the cake was still very moist. I made a sour cream icing topped with nuts instead. My family is still talking about it! I will use this recipe again and again!!

Awesome.  Cannot imagine this with cream cheese frosting.  The glaze works because this cake was rich enough.

I used brown sugar in the cake rahte rthan white. I am allergic to pineapple so left that out. I added 1/4 tsp ginger. Maple syrup since I was out of vanilla. I didn't have applesauce but I had apples, so I oven roasted them and blended them and used 1/3c of that and 1/4 c oil. I also threw in blueberry flavored craisins. The glaze we cut 1/4c sugar out, made our own buttermilk, and again used maple syrup instead of vanilla. After all of that, it turned out AMAZING! It was a bit too sweet for my taste, but was still delicious. Next time I will make sure I have vanilla, cut more sugar, and hopefully have some nutmeg or allspice to help balance the sweetness. I was hoping for more of spice cake taste. And my daughter says more carrot than two cups. Still, this recipe is a keeper. Super moist and flavorful.

This was THE BEST carrot cake ever!!  I made it as a birthday cake for work, co-workers said they couldn't stop eating it and asked for the recipe.  I made cream cheese frosting instead of the glaze. I will make this many times again.
12/25/17   since my first review I have made this many, many times & it is still THE BEST!!

I consider myself to be a connoisseur of carrot cake and this is without question the best recipe I have found. I have served this cake to at least 50 people and have been told by all that it is the best carrot cake they have ever eaten. I even had a friends husband propose to me after eating the cake...YIKES!!!

Made this last weekend for my Dad's birthday.  I will be making this again.  The buttermilk glaze is a nice change from typical cream cheese icing.  It made the entire cake so moist.

I made this cake for my husbands birthday. He loves carrot cake and this recipe was up there at the top.  I had a different carrot cake recipe that I really like but I couldn't find it and this recipe is a nice substitute. I'll make it again. Very moist. Only changed  the oil to 3/4s of a cup and left out the raisins, hubby doesn't like them.  He doesn't like coconut either but I don't think he even noticed it. Good Good Good

Wow grandma must need to go on a diet - this is so full of fat and suger!  But it tastes great, I made it exactly as the recipe states except used 1/2 cup dessicated coconut instead of 1 cup flakes as I couldn't find any.  Also it needed about 15 minutes more cooking time.  Got lots of compliments on this.

This recipe is now the official carrot cake for our house.  Made it for a family gathering last weekend and everyone not only loved it but told others about it!  The glaze takes away some of the heaviness that the traditional frosting has.  Cant wait to make it again!

Not my fave. I made it as is. The glaze made the cake greasy. Pouring hot, melted butter over a warm cake.... not a good idea. I tried it because of all the have reviews, but I just don't get it! Now that my curiosity has been satisfied, I'll go back to my usual carrot cake recipe.

This is the best carrot cake I have ever had. That is also the comments I get from others when I share it. I buy a container of cream cheese frosting and combine it with 2 c of thawed frozen whipped topping, for a lighter frosting. People love it!!!!

I have made this cake 3 times and it turns out perfect every time. This past time I made it for Thanksgiving and as usual the rants and raves were there and of course everyone there wants the recipe, I don’t know how many times I have sent this recipe to the guests at the gathering.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly (except for the nuts) and the cake was really good.  The next time I made it I only made 2 changes to the recipe ... first ... no nuts we have a nut allergy in our family so I substituted raisins ... second ... I did half white sugar and half dark brown sugar ... I baked it in a bundt pan it took about 55 minutes. The cake was moist and wonderful. I didn't really like the the glaze and opted to make the traditional cream cheese frosting. Will definitely be making this again.

45 minutes at 325 in my Pyrex pan was perfect for my oven. Pour glaze through a strainer to remove milk solids for a nicer look, tastes delicious either way

I substituted white all purpose flour with unbleached all purpose and whole wheat flour. I had to reduce the time by almost 10 minutes but it came out done with a nice crispy top. The disappointment for me was the sweetness. I definitely should have substituted some of that sugar and will do so next time.

Best carrot cake ever.  I used a gluten free flour and it was wonderful.  Will definitely make this again.  I have never rated a recipe, but this one deserved a rating.

This is one of the BEST and SIMPLE carrot cakes to make.  I used Cake Flour instead of all-purpose flour.  My oven cook time was only 35 minutes instead of the posted time.  Just make sure to check it & don't overcook it.  It could be due to the Cake Flour vs. all-purpose flour.  Very light and moist.  And the Glaze was amazing.  Thanks for this simple to make and delicious to eat cake.

Very good cake, I added one small banana and substituted a few tablespoons of both butter and apple sauce for about half of the oil.

This was too different from the traditional carrot cake I used to make, was not up to par for me.

Although I cut down on the butter in the glaze and used part applesauce for oil in the cake itself, I still found it too oily and not as flavorful as the last Carrot Cake recipe I tried.

Very nice and moist.  It could've used more carrot taste because it tasted like a sweeter version of a spice cake.  My kids helped to measure out the ingredients and they were proud of the yummy results.  I used a cream cheese whipped topping found on another recipe instead of the this one, but next time I will used the suggested topping and compare.

Outstanding. First Carrot Cake I have ever made and it is EXACTLY what I wanted. Has perfect body without being too heavy. A big Sierra Hotel from the old Sarge.

I gave a friend this recipe to make for Easter for dinner at me and my family's home. Sorry for late review all, I couldn't find the recipe. Anyhoo, my friend followed the recipe exactly. I don't eat carrot cake, but everybody that did liked it!!!!! They all gave it 4 stars. My dad finished the leftovers!!!

I baked this cake during the holidays and it was sensational.  I received nothing but praise.  I did use a cream cheese frosting instead of the buttercream, but I followed the cake recipe exactly.  AWESOME! Many thanks for sharing.
