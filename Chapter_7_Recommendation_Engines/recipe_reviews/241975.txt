This was an easy recipe and you can't go wrong with spinach and mushrooms. However I made several modifications and it still could've used more flavor. I added ground turkey and chopped onions, along with garlic. I only added about 1.5 cups of water since my pan was overloaded. Also cooked it on low because the noodles cooked too quickly at medium. Next time I think I'll use chicken or beef stock in place of the water because despite my generous salt addition, it could've used more flavor. Overall, good easy weeknight dinner!
