GREAT recipe that I could slightly bend to my needs and adjust in small ways to not only use what I had on hand but to make a little healthier and a tiny bit less spicy for little mouths. I made this marinade this morning (but I did cook it before hand AND added cornstarch for a little thicker marinade--I just cooled it before I used it) and my house smells amazing and I haven't even tasted it yet. I can already tell it's going to be a winner.

WOW! What a fabulous marinade! I used low sodium soy sauce and only 1 Tbsp. of chili paste because I didn't want it too hot.  I used real minced garlic vs. garlic powder and subbed seasoned rice wine vinegar for the cooking wine.  I opted out of the cilantro and instead added thin sliced green onion.  I cut the chicken into chunks for kabobs and pierced it lightly with a fork to let the marinade soak through.  I put everything into a ziplock bag and let it marinate overnight.  I skewered the chicken along with fresh pinapple and grilled it.  The smell was heavenly and the result oh so delicious!

What an outrageous glaze and marinade this is!  I marinated a pork tenderloin and then made a fresh batch of the recipe and cooked it on top of the stove for a glaze to pour over the top of the pork.  All I can say is "OH MY GOODNESS"!!! I felt like a gourmet cook!  This recipe is a nice touch. I did do a couple of things different.  I used crushed pinapple which went nice with the chunks from the orange marmalade.  I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  I marinated it with fresh ginger slices and used ground ginger when I cooked it on top of the stove.  I even added a sprinkle of chinese 5 spice powder.  I didn't have the chili paste so I used a sprinkle of hot pepper flakes and the other thing I changed was instead of chinese cooking wine (which I could not find) I used white wine.  I just think the crushed pineapple added a nice texture to the glaze.  GREAT RECIPE!!!! 5+ stars!

Finally, a marinade for teriyaki chicken that has a KICK and actually really tastes like something from a restaurant. I used fresh garlic and fresh ginger and used no-sugar added marmalade. I also cut down a bit on the brown sugar. I'll admit that I didn't use *quite* the full amount of garlic-chili paste, but I was close! I doubled the recipe before I even started, based on several reviews. I knew I'd want some to cook down as a glaze after I cooked the chicken. I let three chicken breasts and several pieces of tofu marinate for about 3 hours and then grilled it all. The chicken was tender and delicious and I can't wait to eat leftovers with more of the glaze. We served this with baked crab rangoon and asparagus roasted with lemon/orange pepper. My family ate brown rice with theirs. Everything was wonderful and we'll definitely have this again and again. Thank you for a wonderful recipe...one of my favorites of all I've ever tried on All Recipes!

Oh YUM! This is so good! Don't miss making this easy marinade/glaze, it's also great using it as a stir-fry sauce over veggies. Just simmer it as preparing for the glaze, and pour some over your stir-fry. Heaven!

We absolutely LOVED this marinade on chicken breasts.  It's sweet & spicy, just perfect.  I prepared exactly as written with a couple of small exceptions, used prepared minced garlic instead of powder, sriracha sauce, and white wine vinegar instead of the chinese cooking wine.  What more can I say, a keeper and a definite do-over.  You hit this one out of the ballpark, Rhonda!

As I was preparing this recipe I must admit I was not at all confident that it would taste good, but it was fabulous! My husband loves spicy foods, and this is now one of his favorites! I couldn't find chili paste with garlic, so I just added a little extra garlic powder. Also couldn't find chinese cooking wine, or any cooking wine for that matter (living in England!) so ended up using white wine vinegar, and it was just fine. Also used crushed pineapple as some other reviews suggested. Used half of the recipe as a marinade for chicken and heated the other half for a glaze. To make it less hot, cut the chili paste in half, or to cool it off a bit, reserve some crushed pineapple to top your dish with before serving!

Very Good, I stir-fried this with some onion and bell pepper and had fresh steamed broccoli and rice with it. I marinated the chicken for a day and half and then I boiled down the extra marinade to put over the chicken, veggies and rice.

Very tasty, I had the butcher cut a slab of ribs in three strips to make rib tips and used this marinade on them and cooked them in the crock pot then crisped them up in the oven. I did not use the cooking wine as I could not find it. But was tasty and I will be using this again  makes a lot for an appy

This was delicious, very flavorful. You can really smell the garlic and I was afraid it would be too much, but it wasn't. I thought the chili paste would make it hot, but it wasn't hot enough for me! I love food with a bite so I will add some pepper flakes next time. I used boneless rib pork loins that were $2/pkg and it took no time at all to cut them into bite sized chunks. I marinated them overnight and half the next day. Added cherries, green peppers and onions and made kabobs which came out very flavorful and tender. Company loved them and no one would ever guess how economical it was! We didn't grill them, Hurricane Gustav brought winds too high for that today! But broiled in the oven they came out great.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe I'll use over and over!

This is out of sight with chicken wings! I made two small changes though. I used low sodium soy sauce and roasted garlic. This is fantastic with duck as well if you are roasting it on the spit. If you are a grill or barbecue fan...try this!

This is absolutely the best chicken I have ever had!!!  I substituted the chili paste with hot pepper flakes nd the Chinese cooking wine with rice wine vinegar as were mentioned in some reviews because I did not have the original ingredients.  I am thinking this will be even better with pork!

DELICIOUS! I did use crushed pineapple instead of chunks because I felt that they would distribute better, but other than that I kept the recipe as is. I used 1/2 of it to marinate chicken thighs overnight, and the other 1/2 I cooked down to use as a glaze while they were cooking. Very tasty! I will be using this recipe again, for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

Wonderful flavor. Instead of using it for a marinade, I stir-fried some chicken and veggies and used this for the sauce.

This is really good.  I marinated 6 large chicken breasts in it for almost 48 hours.  I made as is except I only had plain chili paste so I just added a couple cloves of garlic and used mirin for the Chinese wine.  I wished I would of also made some extra for a glaze - next time I will.  This has nice heat so keep that in mind if you aren't into spicy.  I think this would be even better on a couple pork tenderloins...yum.  I didn't get to eat the pineapple as the previous reviewer stated cuz mine was in with the raw chicken but I'm sure it is good and I would actually use slices with the glaze for ease on the bbq when I make this again. Thanks for the great marinade recipe Rhonda!

This is by far the best marinade I have ever used on chicken. I was a bit hesitant at first, seemed like a LOT of sambal (chili garlic) but it wasn't overwhelming at all. The sweetness of the marmalade must balance the heat somehow. I made this twice. Once we marinaded just for a couple hours, and the next time we let it sit for about 12 hours. Trust me, the longer you let it sit, the better!   One note: Do NOT substitute crushed pineapples. The absolute BEST part of the whole meal is eating the barbequed pineapple cubes. I am sure the flavor would be the same on the chicken, but you don't want to miss out on the grilled pineapple. Its to die for!   The only modification I made to the recipe was using Mirin ( Japanese cooking wine) in place of the Chinese cooking wine because that is what I had on hand. Followed everything else to a "T" and it made the perfect amount of marinade for 4 chicken thighs. If you are cooking more than that, I would advise you double the recipe.  Thank you so much, this is our new favorite!

I recently canned some orange marmalade and was looking for ways to use it in my cooking. I am so glad I found this recipe! I made it as directed just a few changes. I had fresh pineapple in the fridge so I used that instead of canned. To make up for the pineapple juice I was lacking, I added some orange juice. I did a quick stir fry with fresh broccoli, water chestnuts and chunks of chicken breast. I put that over brown rice and topped it with this amazing sauce. Even my 16 year old nephew ate this. I can't wait to make it again...have a pork tenderloin in the freezer just waiting!

I only used half the chili paste called for and thought this was still plenty hot, though maybe the variety of chili paste I purchased is hotter than what the recipe submitter uses.  I also used rice wine vinegar in place of the cooking wine.  I admit that I did not use this on pork or chicken, but instead chose to marinate some thinly sliced stir fry steak.  Unfortunately, apparently neither DH nor I are big fans of orange marmalade, so I probably won't try this again on pork or chicken.

Used this marinade for turkey breasts and it was delicious! My fiance likes spicy so this worked well for him. We substituted Thai chili sauce for hot sauce because we already had it.

DELISH!!  I didn't have orange marmalade in the house so I used what I did have - plum jelly.  With the 2 Tbls. of chili paste, it was too spicy.  But I can't wait to try it with the marmalade!!

I marinated 2 pork tenderloins over night in this, My husband grilled them on our rotisserie attached to the outdoor grill (also glazing the pork tenderloin with an extra batch I made).. Served with this site's "Fried rice with cilantro" (the rice is amazing!). The glaze was pretty good, The flavors were pretty muddled together, nothing really popped out, I don't think I'll make it again for pork, maybe chicken.

This is an unbelievably good marinade. If for no other reason than it turned me onto chinese chile sauce with garlic. Sometimes I will do a quick marinade with just the chile sauce & soy.  But try this one if you have the ingredients... and don't skimp on the cilantro.  I've used this marinade on pork and chicken.  Both were great.

I had to change this a little based on ingredients I had.  I don't know how it tastes as stated but my pork loin turned out great.  I omitted the chili paste and pineapple.  I don't like spicy food and my husband doesn't like sweet food.  It was perfect.  I reserved the marinade and poured a little on the pork every 10 min. as it cooked.  It made a nice glaze.

I made one and a half times the recipe, setting aside the extra portion.  I marinated chicken thighs for two hours with the amount stated in the recipe and then poured it off.  To the extra portion I  added one tablespoon of cornstarch, brought it to a boil and then simmered until thickened.  I basted the thighs on each side with the thickened sauce and baked in a 425 oven for one hour, basting every ten minutes and turning half way through. Delicious!!

It was good but the marmalade taste was a little too strong.  Maybe if I tried using a different kind of marmalade

Wonderful flavor, just the right bite.  Not too sweet, salty, or hot.  I used it on pork this time - next time I'll try it on chicken.  Looking forward to it!

Outrageous! I prepared the marinade, using crushed pineapples since that is what I had.  Let me tell you, when I tasted the marinade it tasted pretty nasty and I almost didn't use it.  I let the pork cubes marinade overnite.  I added green peppers, fresh pineapple chunks, onions and cherry tomatoes to the skewers and just basted the skewers while they were cooking.  Let me tell you - this was spicy but we loved it.  This is going on my kabob rotation list.  Thank you submitter.

This was excellent!  We made it as a glaze for boneless skinless chicken breasts and it was so flavorful.  It took a little bit more than 20 minutes to thicken up, about 30 minutes.  This would be great as chinese orange chicken.  Try it!

Very good.  The orange marmalade and cilantro added a nice flavor.  I forgot the pineapples and it was still quite good.  Looked good, too, with all of the specks of green cilantro and bits of orange rind from the marmalade.  Try this at least once, it's a fun way to dress up teriyaki.
