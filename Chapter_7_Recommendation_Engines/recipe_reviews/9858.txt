Great little confection. I made them 3x with lemon, then vanilla, then almond. Almond was the best. The consistency for these when you use your mixer is a thick goo that will litterall stand up when you spoon it on the tray. Generously grease the pan or you'll be screwed. If not stiff enough beat some more and add cream of tartar.

This is what we call in my house, "Empty Tomb Cookies."  We put these in the oven the night before Easter and then we discuss the Resurrection of Christ and eat our cookies which are empty, just as the tomb was on Easter morn.

I actually made this using 75% splenda and 25% real sugar. It turned out great. You can make meringues any flavor. I tried adding cocao powder or cinnamon. they're all very fluffy and filling with melt-in-your-mouth goodness

Forgotten?  I spent a tortured night tossing and turning, hearing muffled voices from the oven whispering "we're ready."  The insides of the middle cookies on the bottom rack were hollow and gooey (and tasty), but it may have been because I only heated the oven to 350.  I made the first sheet with vanilla only and added maple flavor to the rest.  It was heavenly.  I'll try heating to the correct temperature next time and maybe put some bricks in the oven to slow down the cooling time.

My grandmother called these snowdrop cookies because they melt in your mouth like snow.  If you preheat oven to 400 degrees and drop temp to 200 degrees when you put the cookies in, they will be done in two hours.  Remember to make them small as they are very sweet.

I beat the egg whites with the cream of tartar and salt and then add 2/3 cup of sugar gradually until stiff peaks form.  I also hide a Hershey's kiss inside the meringue as I drop it onto the cookie sheets and everyone loves the surprise of getting the chocolate in the cookie.  These are very sweet, but people tend to like them and they are pretty easy.

These were perfect!  I made them once as is and thought they were a little too sweet, so the next time I put a little more than half a cup of sugar.  Everyone in the family loved them!

I halved this recipe so as not to have so many.  I made about 2 dozen bite sized cookies.  These are wonderful-mine tasted like roasted marshmellows!  I set my oven to 400, turned it to 200 when I put the cookies in, and then turned the heat off after an hour.  I pulled them out of the oven about an hour after that and they were perfect.

These cookies were awesome.  The only issue I had was that I could not stop eating them!!  All my cookies had a large air pocket in them, not sure if I did something wrong or if they are suppose to be that way.  I also had  lot more cookies than the recipe states it makes. It is best to cook them on the non stick aluminum foil.

Nice recipie, but mine collapsed in the middle. Not sure what I did wrong, or maybe my oven just didn't stay warm long enough.

Simple and wonderful cookies.  These were easy to make and turned out perfect.  I made my first batch with rum extract and mini chocolate chips.  I think my next batch will be peppermint with chocolate chips.  This recipe is a keeper!

These are really good, and pretty darn easy to make. I was able to double the recipe despite what the notes said, but I do also have a fairly large oven and used a metal cooling rack to help expand the shelf space in there. I made them as stated, and added miniature chocolate chips, which is the way my family has always made these cookies. The beauty of these is how easy the are to make and alter to suit your tastes!

I made these last night at ten and took them out of the oven this morning when I woke up. I have to admit I wasn't expecting much as this was the first time I ever made anything like this. But I was pleasantly surprised. They turned out wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly except I used coconut extract and it was so good. I highly recommend this recipe for someone who wants a sweet treat but not all the calories.

Simple Meranguie cookie. Very yummy and easy to make. Made with my kids who had lots of fun with it (piped them). Make them smaller, bite size because they're really sweet.

Yummy!!!! I whipped my (room temp.) eggwhites with the cream of tartar. I used 1/2 cup of sugar and 1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla. I preheated my oven to 400 degrees and left the "cookies" in overnight. They were a little gooey, so I preheated the oven to 400, turned it off, and put the cookies back in for 2 hours. They came out crunchy and awesome! Store in a airtight container. Will make many times again, and will try other extracts like almond and coconut. Great recipe!

DO NOT ATTEMPT WITHOUT A MIXER!  I beat this for an hour and ended up throwing it out.  So dissapointing!  

* I made these again after buying a mixer and they were so good!  I used almond extract and added red & green striped white chocolate chips to the mixture and colored sugar on top.

These cookies are an old favorite that I hadn't made in years.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I added chocolate chips and almond extract to the cookies.  I could taste the sweet crunchy flavor and texture of the cookies, but they were really too sweet for me.  Next time, I may trying adding sifted cocoa to the recipe to increase the flavor and make it a little less sweet.

Such a great recipe!  So easy (used my stand mixer) and quick!  I used vanilla and then did a batch of strawberry and both came out good.  Easy to put in a bag (a little sticky, but do-able) to pipe out and looks great.  I'm so happy with these.

These have always been my favorite cookies. My mom made them every Christmas. She used peppermint extract and added mini chocolate chips to them. I always add the chips and ocassionally use orange or raspberry extract but love mint the best.

I baked this with mini chips and almond extract. I also tried preheating the oven to 400, putting the meringues in and lowering the temp to 200 for an hour as other reviews suggested. They were done a lot sooner, and no problems with stickiness or gooey-ness that others mentioned.

I make these every Christmas. I got the recipe years ago from my mother-in-law, but she puts 1 cup of semi-sweet chips and 1 cup of finely chopped pecans to the meringue.  Just fold them in gently before dropping small teaspoonfuls of the meringue on a foil-lined cookie sheet.  The next day they easily peel off the foil.

Well you HAVE to put chocolate chips in them!!!  And true, don't make them too big, they are very sweet.  I may try reducing the sugar, never knew they would still work without!  These  are always a hit!

This recipie was VERY sweet and not everyone gave it rave reviews. To the recipie sake, I think I did not follow the fecipies exact. My impatience wouldn't allow me to wait until the eggs were "stiff" so the cookies ended up flat and not "puffed" up, such as pictured. I will try again though.

Easy!!! I was going to make Amy's egg yolk chicken anyway so this was a great time to make these cookies!!! Being a test run I just plopped them on to the cookie sheet- but next time I will pipe them out so they are pretty as well as good! I did add a teaspoon of carmel extract and WOW!! I think the kids ate most of them this morning. This was superduper easy, my mixer doing all the work. Thank you! Will make this to give out with my chistmas baskets!

These are good. I am going to make again and this time I will use my stand mixer, I didn't use it the first time. I used a hand mixer, they came out good, but, I'm sure they will come out very high with a stand mixer. My hand got tired of mixing last night, so I shortened the time some.
Sweet, but not the type that hurts your teeth. Make these at the end of your cooking day-then just forget them and watch TV or something else.

Made these to recipe with the exception of adding raspberry extract and enough red food coloring to make them pink. Came out tasting like cotton candy. These are the perfect thing to make while doing holiday baking when you have another recipe for the egg yolks. CAUTION: these are so light and yummy that you will forget exactly how many you eat LOL.

this is really good. I put chocolate in the center to add a bit of a surprise.

Perfect! Just like  I remember as a kid. The only thing that I would change is to add chocolate chips (I did minis) and use almond extract instead of vanilla.

This is to "LillysMom".  I've made these in a lot of flavors, My favorite is with vanilla and almond together.  Here is my hint.  Try baking them on parchment.  No sticking problems.

The cooking method did not work for my cookies. I followed the directions exactly but apparently my oven cooled off too fast. I will be trying this again following some of the other suggestions on how to cook. I added nuts and spices to my recipe. Some reviews say these are too sweet but I did not find that to be true in this case. The taste was fine but the bottom did not crisp up, it was just gooey.

I made these last night using the method for the quick timing.  I preheated the oven to 400 and then turned down to 200 when I put the cookies in.  Baked 1 hour and then left them in the turned off oven for 1 more hour.  I piped this goodness onto the Pam sprayed cookie sheet, some with a maraschino cherry and others plain.  I prefer the plain ones.  For a NON-FAT recipe, I'll be making this again.  It comes together so quickly and reminds me of cotton candy.  I did use good vanilla but I might try another flavoring some day :)

I didn't think I had gotten the meringue stiff enough, but I was using a hand mixer and got tired, so I dropped them anyway. They turned out perfectly! I used almond extract, which I highly recommend.

I thought these were really disgusting. My mother in law and sister in law loved them, but they like anything! I guess it's your personal preference, you'll either love them or hate them!

I am not a big fan of these, as they are very sugary.  However, they are fun and easy to make and my husband really likes them.  I will be keeping this recipe and making again.
