So like to make it better, I substituted the brie with brie, the walnuts with walnuts, and used cranberries for the cranberries.  I did stick with the puff pastry for the puff pastry.  It was most excellent.  Next time I think I'll use brie instead cause my family loves brie.

And the string thing was epic brilliance.  Great idea and worked superbly.  Definitely a keeper idea.

Crowd pleaser! I did not do the string technique. I put the brie wheel in the freezer for about 20 minutes and was able to cut it in half with a knife with no problems.

I made  for a dinner party and I was  hit! I put it together and put  in the freezer for a while., lowered the temp to 400 and added 5-10 min. I also used a cookie cutter to make a Christmas tree for the top. Very pleased with how it turned out.

What a beautiful  gem to star in my bunco buffet! I used an 8 oz wheel (small enough to just set it on its edge and cut with a large knife), I used sliced almonds (not slivered) to make it less chewy and a bit more elegant and I used plenty of egg wash...it browned beautifully!  I cut off the corners of the pastry prior to wrapping and used them to make flowers and leaves. I had 8 folks partaking and the brie was the one thing  on the buffet that disappeared. My gf is coming over Monday to learn how to make it. Thank you Chef John...this will be a regular for my parties!

I also did not bother with the string bit to slice the Brie in half.  20 minutes in the freezer & it was easy to cut.  I also didn't follow the instructions for the nuts and cranberries.  I put the nuts on the Brie, cranberries on top of the nuts, then placed the other half of the Brie on top of that. No worries about flipping the thing and having some of it fall out. Baked as per instructions and it was very good. While it's best eaten when it's warm and runny, it cools fairly quickly.

Yummy!  Will absolutely make this again.  Everyone at the party raved about it.  Especially loved the video which showed how to make the decorative grapes on the vine w/ the puff pastry and the trick in scoring the cheese and cutting with dental floss.  Not crazy about walnuts so substituted pecans and added a pinch of salt and 1 TBSP of brown sugar mixed into the pecans.  Also used Martha's egg wash > egg yolk & 2 TBSP heavy creme.  Served with sliced apples and persimmons.

Was a big hit at our family's thanksgiving gathering. Used dried cranberries and honey as filling, and excluded nuts since many of my nephews aren't big on gourmet nuts. Had considered using cashews but decided to forego based on input from my 14 year old son. Everyone loved the combo and the pastry shell. We served with water crackers. Planning to make this again and definitely recommend for parties and family gatherings.

This is the easiest and most  delicious dish to serve as a starter! It looks magnificent in it's golden pastry and when you cut into it and the cheese and cranberries start oozing out the guests are so impressed.  Serve with a little extra Rasberry jam.

Pretty good. It was very pretty. However we always cook a recipe the first time exactly as written. This one did not seem hot enough inside when done outside. So it needs a little modification on cooking time.

I couldn't find puff pastry so I substituted crescent roll dough and followed these directions exactly except it took 5 more minutes of baking to get the cheese to ooze.  I layed foil on top during the additional time to prevent the tree from over-browning.  I used a cookie cutter for the Christmas tree
decoration and added some garland and presents under the tree.  I was relieved when it came out delicious and looked beautiful.

Everyone loved it.....it was gone in about 20 minutes.  I didn't have puff pastry so I used a store bought pie crust (the kind that come in a roll) and it turned out fine.  I will definitely make it again!

Delicious, I make this for catering events all the time.  Great reviews from guest..  You can substitute jelly  for cranberries but the cranberries and walnuts are delicious. I also substitute crescent roll dough sometimes for the puff pastry. Both are excellent. Try it, you will be happy!

Yummy. Was a hit at a Xmas party with people asking how to make it. Very easy and even when cools down nice to eat without crackers, just in the pastry.

This was our very first experience with brie so it is hard to evaluate it. We did not expect the salty taste of the brie, but I think the cranberries and walnuts helped counteract that. It isn't something we would have often ( has so much cholesterol), but this has nothing to do with the recipe itself.

Chef John does not disappoint on his humorous videos or delicious recipes. I didn't have to use the string technique as a knife worked well. Of all the items on my buffet table this was the item eaten first with rave reviews. This will be a frequent flyer go to appetizer.

His is 100x easier and I think tastier if you use a crescent dough sheet instead. 

Also and I KNOW this isn’t to recipe but in the same vein, I sauté cranberries, walnuts, yellow onion in a little butter to soften the cranberries, deglaze with a little bourbon and add a little brown sugar, cool, top the room temp Brie with it, wrap in dough and bake. Serve with thin sliced  green apples and your favorite wine.

I didn’t bother to slice the Brie in half. I also spread about a quarter cup of homemade plum jam on the rolled pastry, sprinkled nuts and cranberries over the jam, then placed the Brie on top. Wrapped as described.

I didn't have puff pastry sheets, so I used croissant dough out of a tube. Wrapped it in foil to avoid browning it too much (removed foil in last 5 minutes). It turned out great!

This is soooooo delicious! I followed the preparation directions exactly. Then I forgot to put it in the oven when my guests arrived. I left it in the fridge for a week and then baked it. I didn't know if the pastry dough would still be good. I had not put the egg wash on yet.  No harm, no foul! This is amazing, and clearly it is fine as a make-ahead dish.

Made this for a Christmas party.  It was a huge hit!  Didn't change a thing.  Turned out beautiful.  I should have taken a picture.  Making it again tonight for New Year's.  This time,  added a 1/4 cup fig preserves.  I'll report back with a picture this time.

Totally missed the step to put it in the freezer after putting it together in step four. Opps! Baked it for 12 mins at 400 and cranked it up to 450 for the last 8 to make sure the pastry cooked. Would follow the freezer point next time as I think it would have made the center a bit more melty.  Family loved it for Christmas appie. We all agreed that more cranberries next time would be yummy.

I’m only giving this a four star review. It was missing something. I think a tablespoon or less of brown sugar between the cranberries and nuts what I put it over the top.

I had large pie shaped hunks of cream brie instead of small wheels. Followed recipe but substituted my fresh picked sliced tomatoes that I dried out overnight on paper towels in the fridge, and added my fresh chopped basil. Delicious. I'll review the one I made with cranberry and walnuts once I cook it!

Chef John has done it again!  This recipe is fantastic, and lots of fun to make.  I loved cutting the brie with a string. 

I made a couple of changes: I didn't have dried cranberries, but I had some frozen fresh cranberries in the freezer left over from Thanksgiving.  I chopped them up a bit, then added about a teaspoon of granulated sugar.  After letting them sit with the sugar for about 20 minutes, I squeezed out the water (they were watery from having been in the freezer) and put them in the brie.  I used raw pecans instead of walnuts, because I thought the sweetness of the pecans would compliment the brie and the cranberries better.  Both changes worked out beautifully.  

I bought a whole wheat sourdough baguette and a loaf of sweet battered to go with the brie.  I sliced them about 1/2 inch thick and heated them on a large cake rack (so they wouldn't fall to the bottom of the oven) at 425 degrees for four minutes exactly.  They crisped up nicely.  However, because of the puff pastry, we really didn't need the extra bread.  (I put out some lox, cream cheese and capers, and put that on the crostini instead.)

Thanks, John, for this fun, simple and delicious recipe!

SUPER YUM! Did all exactly as directed. Exactly.  The only bummer is that I'm probably the one that ate most of it. 
I wondered if all the extra dough on top would be too much, but it wasn't. Really like the texture it added and the egg wash.

This turned into a meal and went great with a glass of wine! Used crescent roll dough rather than pie crust because that's all I had available and it turned out very well.  Needed to cover with tin foil about half way through baking time to avoid crust burning.  Cheese was melted perfectly.  Will definitely make again and would be a great appetizer at a party.

This was amazing. It looked beautiful  and much easier than the finished product males it look.  I added a small amount of honey in between the layers. The video was very clear and the dental floss made an even cut as suggested.

I have always wanted to prepare a baked brie and after looking at several recipes, decided on this one.  We really enjoyed it!  I didn't have any puff pastry, so I made some myself.  This was a delightful appetizer to serve on New Year's Day.  I would make this again.

Very easy to make and  the crowd lived it.  It was last minute and store had only small wheels of Brie and they were easy to handle.  I also served with fig preserves available and that complemented the tart cranberries and slightly salty cheese.  Definitely a keeper.

This was delicious! The one change I made was to spread apple cranberry chutney on top of the cranberries before I put the Brie back together and wrapped it in the puff pastry. I’ve made this twice and both times it was a big hit and delicious!

Thank you Chef John for a really lovely and tasty recipe!!  Followed the recipe ingredients / directions exactly.  However, because I had to prepare the dish one day and bake it the next,  I froze the stuffed brie in puff pastry (without the egg wash) overnight.  The next day, I took the frozen pastry, brushed it with egg wash, then baked.  Now, Chef John's notes said "if you make it ahead of time, put it in the oven frozen solid, then lower temp to 400 F and give it an extra 10 minutes or, or until the cheese is runny."  I was so worried that the center of the cheese would still be cold, I followed another recipe which said to bake at 350 F for 45 to 50 minutes.  Next time I will follow Chef John's direction because my pastry could have been darker and the 45 minutes was too long and too much cheese oozed out.  It was still very good, but if I had followed Chef John's notes, it would have been even better.

Hit of Thanksgiving! Followed the recipe to a t. Hardest part was finding unminted dental floss. Also it took several passes to cut the cheese.  Everyone loved it.

These were a big hit at Thanksgiving. My family is fairly "sheltered" so they aren't familiar with a lot of cheeses. I recently introduced them to Gouda as well, but I was worried the Brie might be too strong. Not so - baking this up and then allowing it to cool back down again changed the flavor profile and they loved it!

My local grocer only carried Brie wheels about 4-5", so I bought  two and did two different kinds: the cranberry/walnut combo here, and a ham/walnut combo. In the future I might stick with double ham instead of mixing it with black walnuts, but it was still good. The pastry dough raised nicely, and I added hearts to the top using a cookie cutter which made it incredibly simple to "decorate."

I made this today. I put it all together last night and froze it. Then baked it in the morning for about 40 minutes. I had to travel with it so it wasn’t super hot but still melty and delicious. Served it with Ritz crackers. Everyone loved it.

No changes and used toasted baguette slices.  Tasted the cranberries and walnuts but it just seemed a little bland.  Maybe using a cracker or something else might have helped.  Easy to fix and it looked just like the picture too.

This  was a big hit at my dinner party for six!  Served as an appetizer, it was so well liked that it was entirely consumed. I used cherry flavored dried cranberries and they made a nice contrast to the cheese and walnuts.  For some reason, the cheese did not leak out of the puff pastry—-I wonder if it was because I left it in the freezer a little longer than specified in the freezer?  Will definitely make it again!

Followed the recipe except I froze the Brie for an hour as other reviewers did, turned out great.  The way you add the filling to the two halves allows you to get more filling in so I would recommend doing it as instructed.  I made it with the big brie wheel and it turned out great.  Only additional thing I did was cut the top of the rind off to allow the brie to expand without leaking.

So easy, so impressive looking, and most importantly, so delicious! We took this as an appetizer to a small dinner party and  no one could stop eating it to proceed to dinner!  I will make this again and again. Thanks for the video, too!

This turned out excellent and was easy to do. Looks very elegant with puff pastry cut outs. Will make again!

Made exactly as stated except cut the cheese in  half with a knife. Truly outstanding taste with impressive presentation. Everyone loved it. Will definitely make again. Filling was yummy but could imagine many other filling variations as well.

Everyone seemed to love it. Good Christmas appetizer. I cut with a knife. Make sure your cheese is fresh, it turns out better. I used a pastry roll which was much better than using the cresent rolls, it all fell apart and wasn't molding well. I think a pie crust would work well too. I used fig-apple and cranberry preserves mixed and some walnuts/cranberries. Very yummy.

Big hit for Christmas Eve! This was so easy and elegant. I did use the tooth floss technique to cut my brie in half, it was perfect!  I made it ahead of time and froze it, then just followed Chef John's directions for a cooking it.  I will definitely be making this again.

Did not make any changes. Since I've never done a cheese in puff pastry I  was very pleasantly surprised to find out that it turned out perfectly.  Looked like the picture - nicely browned and oozing cheese, yum.

Didn't quite know how to score it so I cut the top into four sections half way down, folded back the top layers and stuffed in the cranberries and nuts - it was sooooo good.
