This was very interesting. It had a deep orange color and did have an orange like after taste. What I was surprised by, was all of the optional ingredients. I decided to use them all and in the amount suggested. The lemon juice helped give the citrus taste of an orange, the honey gave the sweetness, and the chia seeds work as a thickener. My mango and banana was frozen, so on the water part I had to add an additional 1/2 a cup for half the recipe. I am not sure what mineral water is, but I used cold spring water. I like having a smoothie that incorporates a vegetable or two. ty

I made this as written, other than I used frozen mango and frozen banana.  I had to add more water as well.  My husband and I both thought it was ok, but the flavor of the pepper was overwhelming. My children wouldn't drink it.  It's a good base recipe, so I think I'll try it again, adjusting some of the ingredients.

This has to be the weirdest smoothie I've ever had; it had more of a banana flavor than anything. I used the mini sweet peppers as I only made one serving; I don't know that I like it enough to repeat it though.
