This isn't bad (well, the dough is, but the cookie's pretty good).  It is cakey and I don't care too much for cakey, so it gets a 3 instead of a 4.  I did have to make it a chocolate chip cookie instead of raisin because the kids won't eat raisin cookies, they've eaten half of them already.  Overall it was fun to try

I have tried this cookie recipe and I discovered that I did not like these cookies at all.

Well, I suppose if you submit a recipe this out of the ordinary, you have to be prepared for people not to like it.  That said, I'm sorry, but we are among those people.  I cut the recipe down and used butter and currants instead of golden raisins. While the butter might change the texture, it shouldn't change it to more cake like, which is what these cookies were.  That isn't "bad", in itself, as I know some folks prefer that type, however,  the taste of these is just not to our liking.  We could certainly taste the ketchup, they were very, very sweet, and the nuts, especially, just didn't seem to go.  Or, rather, the ketchup didn't go, but since it's a vital ingredient to the recipe, you can't omit it. :)  It was fun to try, and an interesting addition.  Thank you!

Unlike other reviewers, I liked the cakey texture of these cookies.  I cut the recipe in half and, using my cookie scoop, I got 12 cookies out of it.  They didn't flatten out much, so if I make them again (maybe, maybe not) I'll flatten the balls of dough a little bit before baking.  I omitted the nuts because of a nut allergy in a couple of my taste testers and substituted chocolate chips instead of raisins so my kids would be willing to try them.  Overall, most tasters thought they were worthy of three out of five stars.  The only ones who gave them less than three stars knew before tasting them that the recipe contained ketchup, so I think there was a little bit of a psychological thing going on there.  Thanks for the opportunity to try something unique!  I'm glad I tried them :-)

I mess with every recipe I try before i try it if I think it needs something or sub stuff that I don't have, Subbed white sugar for the brown and a blob of molasses ..(I was out of brown sugar). Added two tablespoons of vanilla(we love vanilla)  And when all was said and done, They still lacked ..Sprinkle them with cinnamon ....OH YA! ...fixed ..
