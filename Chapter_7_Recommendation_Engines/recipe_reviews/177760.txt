We have used 2 variations of this recipe.  1st we used original recipe but added 1-1 1/2 cups of frozen mixed veggies. We used canned breadcrumbs, then put the whole skillet in a 350 oven for about 7 minutes. 2nd- We replaced cream of mushroom with cream of broccoli then added 1-1/2 cups of frozen broccoli. Again using canned bread crumbs with a mix of parmesean cheese, salt, and pepper in them. 350 oven for 7 minutes. You can use cream instead of milk for a thicker dish. All 3 delish!!

Surprisingly good with an extra can of tuna added, otherwise, bland.    Easy to prepare.

This basically a tuna noodle on the stovetop instead of in the oven. My can of chicken broth was expired so I had to use water and bouillon cubes which had great results. Everyone loved it. Would add peas next time!

AWESOME!!!! My husband called me last minute to tell me that he was working a double shift and he needed lunch! Ionly had little in the house and this recipe saved me. I sauted 2 cloves of garlic and half an onion in a sautee pan. cooked the pasta separately and put all the ingredients together with elbow macaroni. i also shredded some munster cheese! you can never have enough cheese!! MAKE IT you wont regret it!

great dish. surprisingly tasty. i made enough servings for 2 or 3 people and i followed the recipe exactly, except i added a can and a half of water with the half can of broth, and i used a little less than half a cup of grated Kraft parmesan cheese instead of shredded cheddar cheese. I also added a pinch of salt and pepper and it turned out great

I had to make a couple changes due to what I had on hand and to make a little more......flavorful? I used all chicken broth, cream of chicken soup, evaporated milk instead of regular milk and I doubled the tuna and cheese. I stirred in sauteed onion, garlic and broccoli, the broccoli to add more "green" to the kids' diet. I made my own seasoned bread crumbs out of stale bread, homemade italian seasoning, and olive oil. This was pretty tasty with my additions. I don't think it would have been as good had I not used all chicken broth or added in the sauteed vegetables and doubled both the tuna and the cheese. My husband didn't much care for it but the kids and I ate it without complaint. That's a feat sometimes with my littlest!

This recipe was enjoyed in my home. Although I did use a larger can of Chicken broth & about three times the cheese. I also added garlic salt. I transfered to a baking dish and Baked on 350" for 9 minutes. Than broiled on high for about 4-5 min to crisp the bread crumbs and cheese. Very good! I will make this again. Next time. I will add fresh onion, garlic and or a pack on onion soup mix. I like just a tad bit more seasoning than probably the norm.

I have never made a tuna caserole before because of negative thoughts about them.  I am happy I made this.  I do not live in a country where they sell condensed soups or chicken stock, so I had to make my own.  Still, it was worth it.  My children really enjoyed it, and I will make it again.

A yummy fast casserole.  I added a bunch of spinach to the pot just as the noodles were almost finished, doubled the amount of cheese and tuna, and baked it in a casserole dish with cheese and bread crumbs on top for 25 minutes.  My husband is Indian so I let him season the casserole as he wants it with curry, turmeric and red cayenne pepper and it gives it more flavor.  I didn't add the cup of milk (didn't think I needed it with the cream of celery soup) and it turned out just fine, just be careful not to burn and keep stirring on the stove.

I made this meal for a friend, and she raved about it! I personally would rather have liked the dish to be more cheesy.  I wonder if cheddar cheese soup, instead of cream of mushroom or broccoli, would have made a difference?

I sauteed 3 stalks of celery and a clove of garlic prior to boiling the soup and the water. I used two cans of tuna. Delish.

Pretty good. We didn't have all the correct ingredients so we substituted a can of chicken gravy for the broth and cream of celery for mushroom. A cup of peas completes the meal. Even our finicky 2 year old liked it. We will definitely make it again.

We added a small onion, stalk of celery, and a clove of garlic, all diced/minced, and about 1C of frozen green beans to homemade chicken broth, then cooked the pasta.  Only other changes were adding 2 cans of tuna and 1C half-and-half. Yum!

I did drain the liquid out, it seemed too much for me, I mixed the cheese in, and added another can of tuna along with some garlic salt, and celery and dried onions sauteed in butter, it seems that I changed a bit, but it was just to my liking, great recipe thank you!

I love tuna casseroles as well as homemade Mac n cheese.  My least favorite recipe so far.  Had a very weird taste.  Could barely bring myself to eat the leftovers.

Surprised at how much I enjoyed this recipe.  Made a few tweaks (second can of tuna) and added some additional seasonings and it was top notch.

This was really good! Based on previous reviews I added 2 cans of tuna and 1 cup of frozen peas. I didn't have any bread crumbs, so I used 1 sleeve of crushed Ritz Crackers. My mom grew up during the era of Tuna Noodle Casserole...she told me she wouldn't eat it then and she refused to even try this one...until my husband told her how good it was. She ate 2 bowls!!!!
