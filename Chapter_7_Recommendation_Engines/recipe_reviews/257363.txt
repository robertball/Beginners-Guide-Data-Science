I liked the ingredients but I would cut down on the olive oil! Way too oily! I think the salsa needs a kick of heat as well. Next time I would add some pepper flakes or some drops of hot sauce.

I made this the other night and found it quite good.  I actually used Tri-Tip, as it is one of my favorite cuts.  My family loved it.  The Salsa is amazing and a great treat to add to really any meat.
