Delicious!  I did make a couple changes though based on what I had on hand.  I did not have any cornflakes and could not get to the store, so I used crushed cheez-it crackers (the cheddar/parmesan duo variety).  Also, I used only half the amount of butter and 1 egg white.  Overall, the chicken was a bit salty, but I think that was because I used the crackers instead of cornflakes.  If I did it the same way again, I would omit the garlic salt and replace it with garlic powder.  I also cooked it on a rack placed on top of a baking sheet so the bottom would not get soggy.  It worked pretty well.  I will definitely make this again.

I used panko bread crumbs instead of cornflakes. I used low fat mayo instead of butter to cut calories.  This was easy and better than fried chicken with less mess.  The cayenne pepper gave it a great kick.  I will be making this often.

I often try to keep to the original recipe as much as possible, as I immensely dislike those who massacre the original ingredients and then give it a horrible rating.  In my case I did not have the cornflakes, so I did the next best that I could do and used Special K cereal instead.  I really am not a fan of too much salt, so I did swap the salt for garlic powder.  When it said creole seasoning, I figured I could used Bayou blast by Emeril.  The only thing I probably missed was on the cheddar, I sprinkled it on top...this was tasty and I can't wait to make it again!    I put a quick meal together by using a fettucini alfredo noodle packet then added in some bayou blast to give it a cajun kick, I served it w/ veggies and garlic bread.  Thanks for sharing!

This was good, quick and easy.  All requirements in my book.  I didn't have corn flakes, so used cracker crumbs.  It came out a little salt, but I suspect that was my fault.  I used 1/2 the butter to dredge the chicken and poured the rest over the chicken before baking.  I also turned chicken 1/2 way through cooking, but didn't find it helped all that much to crisp the other side.  My breasts took about 30 minutes to bake and were perfect.

This recipe is very tasty.  I didn't have any corn flakes so I used bread crumbs and it still turned out great.  I added some crushed red pepper for extra spice.  I cooked it for 15 on one side, then flipped it over, added some more cheddar on the top and cooked for another 15 minuts.  We loved it, I don't understand why noone else has tried this recipe, its worth trying. Thanks Ty.

My husband and I think these are great.  I did make one change however as I didn't have any corn flakes, so I crumbled up Ritz Crackers in place of the corn flakes and it came out so yummy.  The bottom of the chicken (even though I flipped it half way through) was a little mushy but the top stayed crunchy.  I have made these a few times since first trying this.  I may one day try it with the corn flakes, but I was so happy with the Ritz that I may not.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Didn't have corn flakes on hand, so I used panko crumbs, which were a good alternative.  Due to the salt content in the Creole seasoning, cheese and garlic salt, I opted to use straight garlic powder vs garlic salt.  So glad I did, as I think it would have been too much  for those of us who are watching their dietary needs.  Nice change of pace Ty Mote.  Thank you.

These were great. I liked the shredded cheddar added to the mix. I would make these again, but I think I will try panko breadcrumbs!!

Incredibly effortless, yet extremely flavorful. I added a bit more Creole seasoning and cayenne pepper, it had a really nice kick to it, and was very crunchy.

this was great! BUT i had to give it four stars because it needed a salt modification. the creole seasoning i had on hand already has sodium, so the pair of it and the garlic salt was FAR too much. it was great but about three bites in we were all reaching for our waters. next time i will swap garlic salt for garlic powder and still use the toni chachere's creole mix since its what we have on hand. :). good recipe!

This is great! I use bread crumbs instead of corn flakes and added a little more cheese as well. My boyfriend and I love this when we want to indulge a little.

We liked this but didn't quite get the Cheddar Cheese.  I found it just browned on top and didn't end up adding much to the chicken.  I think next time I would leave it out.  I think next time I would double the amount of spices.  I was really expecting more of a zing to this.  Also, I just baked them on a regular baking sheet and boneless, skinless chicken breast halves only take 20-25 minutes (maybe 30 for really large breasts).  I don't see the need to bake them for 40 minutes.  I did find the chicken was really tender and juicy.  I don't know if it was just good timing (not overcooking) or if the butter helped with this.  I would make this again.  I gave it 4 stars on the assumption that this would have more zing by doubling the spices.

I thought this was good, but my fiance said it was 'awesome', so 5 stars it is! The only thing I changed was to use leg quarters instead of breasts. Great flavor and crunch and the meat was very moist. Thanks! :)

Needed more cheddar for a spicier taste.  Oven fry with skin for jucier meat.  Not abd, but not fantastic.

One of our favorites! Delicious every time! Can get a little too salty though, so watch out for the garlic salt / creole seasoning combo - you may need to cut back a bit on those.

Also, sometimes the coating won't stick to the chicken - don't be afraid to pile some on top of the chicken in the dish before cooking - turns out really good!

I will make it again, however,  too salty with the garlic salt and creole seasoning.  Next time I will use garlic powder and make my own creole mix without the salt.

This recipe was Excellent!!!  It is so good, and so easy to prepare!!  My 12yr old daughter loves to cook and has been trying out simple recipes and making dinner for the family.  This was the second dinner that she cooked for us.  She was able to make this chicken without any help from me, and it came out so good!  It was very juicy, with a nice crispy outside from the corn flakes, and had just the right amount of spice... not too spicy, but with a little kick.  My husband and I were both very impressed.  We will definitely be making this again!!

Extremely salty as is. With that said, it had good flavor and I will make it again, but will eliminate the garlic salt and replace with garlic powder. I used half the cajun seasoning, because I knew it would add salt, but still was too salty.

Sick and tired of reading these reviews when the person does NOT follows the recipe. And then, they rant about how it did not turn out. Well DUH! Make the recipe as written, review, then tweak it to your no gluton, low fat, no seaweed, no soy sauce, no flour, no carb, no taste likings...

Instead of using cornflakes I used some Italian flavored bread crumbs instead. I used grated romano cheese instead of parmesan and added just a little shredded mozzerela cheese. I also didn't have Creole seasoning but it came out good anyway. I'd like to buy some and try it again though. My daughter said it's her favorite kind of chicken now, and she usually only likes chicken with some kind of sauce, not coated.

This is excellent!  It was incredibly crunchy and the seasonings gave it the right amount of spice.

I would give this recipe 4 1/2 stars. I liked the way the top of the breasts crunched up, but the bottom was a little mushy, even though I flipped them halfway through. I doubled the amount of creole seasoning I used, which added a nice kick, but next time I will halve the butter and add an equal amount of mayonnaise to the mix before coating. I think that will give it an extra zing. I baked mine on a cookie sheet, and 40 minutes was perfect for juicy boneless, skinless breasts.

This chicken came out great!  I didn't have corn flakes on hand, so I used bread crumbs instead.  I also added extra cheddar cheese for the last 10 minutes of baking to make the chicken extra cheesy.  Yummmm.

This recipe has potential. My kids disliked it being so spicy. I felt it was too salty. I did use garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I would cut  the cayenne  and creole seasoning next time making it for my kids.

We thought this chicken was really, really yumo!!!
I did have to make one substitution,and that was to replace the corn flakes with crushed pork rinds! Not only did this make the chicken crunchy on the outside,and moist  chicken on the inside, just as if I had used the crushed corn flakes. The pork rinds were all I had ,so it made for a  low carb chicken dish (a win,win chicken dinner for me!) 
Also, I didn't use any butter,because the pork rind topping has fat,so no need for any other form of fat. Except for the pork rinds that replaced the corn flakes,and no butter,I kept the rest of the spices and flavor as is.  This will be included in our meal rotation at least once a week.

Out crispy and not too spicy. Will definitely be adding this to the rotation!

Delicious! I used Tilapia instead of chicken and adjusted my temp and cooking time to Fifteen minutes each side at 450 degrees. It was great! Even my daughter, who is very picky, ate it! My son gobbled it up!

Very tasty and juicy chicken.  Probably better to crush the cornflakes yourself in order to get a little more texture on the chicken.

Was lazy so I used Extra Crispy Shake n bake instead of crushing up corn flakes & added garlic spice instead of Cayenne & after placing the coated chicken on the baking sheet sprinkled a bunch more cheese and cooked it for an hour and it's some of the best chicken I've ever had

Trying to watch calories so I did not use butter.  Just patted chicken and used a butter spray.  Then I cook it in my air fryer with another quick spray of butter.

Next time I will dip it in 1% milk first instead of the butter and just use the butter spray on top.  I have been quite successful in substituting milk for a butter under .coating

This was very easy for a weeknight meal and tasted good. I used thin sliced chicken breaststroke and Whole wheat Panko instead of corn flakes because that's what I had on hand. I salted the chicken breasts before dipping in butter--I will not do that again because I thought it was a little too salty for my taste. Served it with fresh corn cakes and fresh green beans. Really moist and tasty way to prepare chicken!

This was excellent but a little too salty. My creole seasoning already had a lot of salt, so next time I would cut way back on the the garlic salt, but I will definitely use it again, as the flavor was amazing!! Also I had salted butter on hand so used that and probably should have used unsalted.

I made this for my family. My only substitution was Panko bread crumbs for the corn flakes. It was simple, fast, and absolutely delicious. Getting ready to make it again, for guests this time.

I followed this recipie with 1 change. instead of Creole seasoning I used a Mrs. dash chicken seasoning. I didnt think my 5 year old would like Creole lol. I was skeptical about the cornflakes and had to search for unfrosted flakes, but it worked great. I put 3 piece in the regular oven and 3 in the convection oven, convection is better and juicier, I used raised racks so the chicken wouldnt get soggy. boyfriend and 5 year old ate all of it :) I will be making it again.

This was delicious! I used fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and I also had to sub bread crumbs for the cereal. I will make it again.

I had to make a few changes based on what I had on hand - used panko instead of corn flakes, and used crushed red pepper instead of the cayenne. My family and I absolutely loved it. My husband loved the crumb mixture so much he practically licked the pan :) The chicken breasts I used were pretty thick so I had to use the full 40 minutes to cook and they came out nice and juicy. I will definitely make this one again.

Easy to make!!! Very Tasty!!! I did NOT add the cayenne pepper, and the kids loved it. After one bite my 6 year old son said "You should make this more often."

This is a GREAT recipe!!  I have made it when company comes over and they always love it.  I have also replaced the cornflakes with crushed Ritz Crackers and replaced the creole seasoning with a packet of Ranch dressing to do a tangy Ranch Cheddar version, and it is good too!

This was very easy preparation, and chicken came out juicy.....but the Creole seasoning along with the cayenne pepper made the coating too spicy for us.  Next time, I will change the seasonings.

This was just okay, seemed to be lacking something in flavor, although the chicken came out very juicy and the dish is super easy to make.  I did as other reviewers suggested and used bread crumbs and put the cheddar cheese on during the last 10 min.  I added more garlic powder, some onion salt and a little poultry seasoning and it was still lacking in flavor.  I only needed to bake the chicken 30 min. and turned the breasts half-way through.
