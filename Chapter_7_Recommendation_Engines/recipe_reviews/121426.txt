I did double the recipe. I used two full red peppers instead of 1/2 of a cup, I added fresh minced garlic and chopped fresh bella mushrooms. I did not use any egg substitute, I just used four whole eggs and 8 egg whites. No idea why it called for cream of tartar, I didn't bother with it. Even doubling it, I did not add the full amount of cheese. A sprinkling of low-fat cheese was more than enough. I'll be honest, I stink at making omelettes so this came out more like veggie scrambled eggs. Next time, I'd like to add spinach.

Great omelet! I used all egg beaters and omitted the water and cream of tartar (didn't see the need for it) added a bit of garlic, some mushrooms and did the whole thing in a non-stick pan on top of the stove making it less complicated. Great with a side of whole grain toast!

This is very good! I omitted the regular egg whites and used about 1/2 cup of egg white substitute.

This was the best omelet I have ever made in my life.  Complicated and takes a while, but totally worth it.  Thanks!

What a novel way to make an omelet. I think I need to bake the meringue longer next time.
