So great...nice blend of honey sweetness and sriracha heat.  Recommend cutting the red pepper flake measurement in half to take the edge off...this was a very spicy sauce

10.13.16  I knew as written this recipe would be too spicy for us (we’re about a 6 or 7 on a scale of 10), and I didn’t want to waste a pound of beautiful, fresh brussels sprouts.  I gave them a sprinkle of hot pepper flakes, a good grind  of fresh peppercorns, and kept the Sriracha® the same (maybe a little more the next time).  (Remember, you can always add more, but you can’t take it out once it’s in there.)  The honey-Srirache drizzle is the perfect match for the spiciness of this side dish.

Leave out the red pepper flakes and you have a 5 star all the way. I made as written but these were just too hot for us and we like hot. The Sriracha is all the heat you need in my opinion. The flakes were overkill and ruined it for us. The sprouts got a perfect roasting on them and were downright delicious. I plan to make this again but without the flakes and using equal parts Sriracha to honey and I am convinced this will be my absolute favorite way to eat Brussels sprouts and my go to recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Great flavors for Brussels Sprouts. I’ll usually also add some soy sauce and balsamic vinegar to kick it up a notch.

These are absolutely delicious. The only thing I would change if you don't like hot foods, is half the sriracha sauce.

They were HOT and sweet. Loved them. The cook time was about 5 minutes too long. I did some with the full spice recipe, and reserved half to do just half the spices called for. My husband loves spicy food, and i like mine more on the mild side. We were both extremely pleased with the end results.

I love this recipe!  I put the sprouts back in the oven for another 5 minutes or so to let the honey carmelize. I will reduce the red pepper by a bit because they were pretty hot.

I put mine in cast iron skillet 2 lbs of the smallet brussel sprouts in the bin with 4 or more garlic cloves.and a couple of Serrano peppers or jalapenos. Trust me. I cook till caramel color with ghee. Add pepper and cilantro.
 I Promise by the time you could come down with bunch of water it down whole thing isn't hot at all but two die for. Pink salt and honey at end.
Ps if you are going to use olive oil do so sparingly and at end. It will Blacken everything fast

I absolutely love spicy food, but I found the amount of red pepper flakes to be too intense. If you like spice, I'd cut the amount of red pepper flakes in half. If you're cooking for people who aren't huge fans of spicy food, maybe just a pinch of red pepper flakes. They give the meal a nice kick, so I wouldn't skip them altogether, but following the recipe as-is will be too intense. I seriously had to drink water after every bite. It was tasty, but I wouldn't make them that way again.

The only change I made outside of the recipe's directions was to add some garlic powder.

I made this as directed except I reduced both the honey and Sriracha as mentioned in the reviews. We liked it a lot and were happy with the level of spiciness. Will definitely use this recipe again.

LOVED this recipe, but used a load more honey.  I probably won't make Brussels sprouts any other way.  The only thing I did different was put them in a shallow baking dish, cooked for 20 minutes, stirred, then cooked for another 20 minutes.  I love spicy and this recipe was perfect.

Instead of putting the sauce on after baking, my son misread the instructions and put it on BEFORE baking. These were still absolutely AMAZING and have become a quick staple side dish in our house! SOOOOOO good!

I used Agave instead of honey and it was really delicious!
Wr also added bits of bacon.
Like everyone else said, the red pepper flakes were too spicy. I think we’ll leave them out next time.

Wonderful flavor!!!  If you want a slight more heat, add more red pepper flake and a touch of the Sriracha!  The honey really cuts down the heat.

Really really good!  I am not a spicy flavor kind of person, but I was in the mood for sweet and spicy and this hit the spot.  I did not add the red pepper flakes because I knew that the Sriracha Sauce was plenty enough for me.

I enjoyed this dish but next time I'll go a little lighter on the siracha and pepper. I like most food hot but this was just a tad too much. I used agave instead of honey and it worked just as well.

Next time I will let the sprouts soak in the olive oil dressing for a bit longer.    We prefer them a little crispier.

Beautifully roasted but way too spicy (and I love hot), recommend to cut the sriracha significantly in the honey dressing.

It was very good!  Wish I would have put red pepper flakes in (or at least 1/2).  I was concerned due to comments and omitted.   I guess the amount all depends on your tolerance for heat.

Fantastic.. My whole family loved them.  If you leave out the red pepper flakes, it is just flavorful but not hot.

Too hot for me and the flavor wasn't that spectacular. I'll look for a different recipe.

I used frozen sprouts and steamed them prior to roasting, which is likely not the best way to do this as it adds more steps but they still turned out great! I roasted them for 30 minutes to get them to the desired crispiness. Thank you for sharing!

Awesomeness in taste and ease of making.Make sure you flip the sprouts half way thru the cooking time.                             Or they will be very burnt!

I made these for Thanksgiving and it was a hit! I did leave out the srirachasauce and red pepper only becasue my husband hates anything spicy but I am betting it is great with those added too. I will be making these many times again!

Love it. I did not use the red pepper flakes and I used more honey to cut done the spicy to a level I could handle. Made as is, it's pretty spicy.
