Great! I used mini Phyllo cups instead of dinner rolls. It was outstanding.

I found this  while looking for Low Carb recipes  I eliminated the dinner rolls and baked the crab mixture in ramekins.  It was delicious and even lower in carbs!

My husband loved this.  The only thing I did different (the second time and thereafter) was to chop up the water chestnuts and sprinkle on the top of each one, so that each bite had some in it.  Very yummy and my husband is fairly picky, especially when it comes to seafood.

A scrumptious appetizer! The water chestnuts added the perfect touch. The green onion made my puffs look a little green, so I sprinkled a little bit of chili powder on top of the chestnuts for color.
