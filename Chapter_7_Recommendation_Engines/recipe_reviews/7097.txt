The filling was good but doesn't quite 
capture the same flavor as restaurant
char siu buns.  But still a hit among
family and friends.

The dough recipe was perfect, albeit very large.  The stuffing however was pretty bad.  I have made quite a few chinese dishes and this had the worst flavor.  It needs to be sweeter and more vibrant.  Next time I will use less oyster sauce and add honey and ginger.

I was really nervous making baos for the first time for my husband who comes from a chinese family, but they all loved them and my husband couldnt get enough of them.  He said that they are better than at the chinese store.

I only made the bun portion of this recipe.  I tried it twice and both times the dough came out crumbly and dry.  The buns turned out so-so, not very moist and kind of dense.  I had much better results with the Chinese Steamed Buns recipe which required more steps.  I will not be using this recipe again.

The taste was wonderful. In the recipe it says finely chopped pork, but the directions say to cut into 1/2 cubes.  I think it would be best if the pork is shredded and a little more than 1 pound for 24, maybe 1 1/2 lb.

These are wonderful. I make them all the time in big batches and freeze the ones that we don't eat for dinner since they freeze really well and can just be microwaved later.

I followed the recipe for the dough, but found it needed an extra 1/2 cup of milk to really get it to the right consistency.

As for the filling, I've always added diced scallions, shallots, and garlic to my cha siu bau.

This is one of the few recipies that accurately calls for baking soda in the dough, though, so I give it 4 stars.

This recipe was very time consuming, but ultimately worth it.  It made large, plump buns that my family adored.  

I did add another 1/4 cup of water to the dough, and I could have used almost twice the meat and sauce filling.  I think I'll make the dough sweeter next time.  I will absolutely try this recipe again.

I loved these on their own, but I fried them on both sides to give a little extra texture... Also, it seems a little easier if you marinate the pork overnight.

Not as good as the buns I made without baking powder, using yeast only. The baking powder adds a chemical taste and makes them much less palatable. Reduce the amount to 1/2 teaspoon IMO.

The dough needs a little tweaking (more water). I kind of eyeball it and add more. I also use a rolling pin to get the balls flatter so they can hold more filling. Overall, this is an excellent recipe and I've made it repeatedly. Also, raw bao freezes well (just steam them a little longer than usual)!

Very yummy and filling.  Way better than just a dinner roll!  found the bread dough to dry.  The second time we made the recipe we added more water to the dough and made the buns 1/2 the size too be more like appitizers than big buns.

no way to make this dough stretchy & pliable unless there is Maybe, a bread machine.  Had to toss about a cup of flour & hoping for the best of the 5 C left.

Made this for the first time. The filling is a little different than what I am used to but it was good. The dough was very tough and hard to work with. I thought it was a little dry but I just added a little more water to the mix and kneaded the best I could. Kitchen Aid was working too hard so I ended up doing it manually. I was worried the dough was too heavy but it turned out great!

The bao dough was fantastic. The dough was a bit dry so I added an bit more water. I wanted to make it similar to the whole wheat edamame at wow boa, so I substituted one cup of AP flour for wheat and then added a tablespoon of agave nectar. The filling included edamame, shrimp, ginger, lemon juice, garlic, and scallions which turned out well.

The first time I made this,  I was disappointed.  The flavor wasn't there to match the ones an Asian friend made.  Then I discovered the error in the ingredients list.  The 1 tsp of soy sauce is supposed to be sweet soy sauce.  I found a recipe tho make my own, then found it in my local Asian market.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE! !  I make these 2 - 3 times a year and freeze them after steaming since I'm the only one who eats them.

I make the dough from this recipe in the bread machine. I had a 1.5 lb bread maker previously, and it would spill over the top. You need a 2 lb bread maker or larger for this dough if you don't want to knead it by hand.

I make the filling with whatever leftover Asian pork leftovers we have laying around. And sometimes other meats. I find the hoisin sauce too heavy in the original recipe. So I use less if I'm going to use the author's spices. 

It's a great basic recipe.

The filling was fantastic and very close to what you get in restaurants however it was very less for the amount of bread so I had to make a second batch again. Although the bread was very good somehow I did not get the same fluffiness that the restaurant bread has. Mine had a skin on it and was yellowish whereas in restaurants it is almost pure white and very fluffy. Nevertheless a great hit.
