I had friends over to help rake leaves today so I made them lunch.  I made the A La King this morning and just reheated at lunch time.  I served it over beds of brown rice (also re-heated) and a crisp salad.  HUGE likes! 
Everyone liked it very much.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  The next time I make it I will throw in another shallot and a clove or two of garlic.  Only because I would prefer it, not because the recipe needs it.  Another Great Chef John recipe!

This was hit when served for Sunday dinner.  My Daughter In-law called this next day for the recipe.  The only change  I made was added frozen peas because my wife said that was how her mother made it.  The peas worked well and the flavor was great.

Ok, so I grew up on Banquet frozen chicken a la king and my husband grew up on his dad's version of turkey a la king.  I was hoping that 1) this would be close to what we grew up on and 2) that it would be phenomenal due to it being one of Chef John's recipes but after all the work to make it (no modifications other than used gluten free AP flour) and the resulting flavor, I am disappointed.  My husband said he would not want me to make it again and really, I don't have any desire to .  I served it over GF biscuits (figured toasted bread, like in childhood, was too plain for a meal that took this long to make).  I really don't know what would make it be five stars.  I guess I'll keep looking.

Made as directed, used a rotisserie chicken I picked up at the grocery store.  Served over egg noodles.  Flavors molded together very nicely.  Agree with not leaving out the sherry. Presents very pretty with it's autumn colors.  Could easily take the place of a turkey for Thanksgiving!

I love Chef John recipes!  This one was excellent.  I did add some carrots and green beans and about 4 oz. of cream cheese as well. I put it over Cauliflower rice.

No changes -  it was just ok flavor wise. I usually make my chicken a la king on top of homemade biscuits. I thought I would try Chef Johns potato suggestion. I found it to be a mushy texture and I did his mash potato recipe as well. I did not think the mushrooms and peppers contributed much to the flavor. I use celery. Sorry to my favorite chef John.

This was the first time I have tried to make Chicken a la King and have to say is a great recipe, a instant family favorite. 
I admit I didn't have any Sherry on hand but had some Sweet Vermouth and the flavors? blended fabulously.

This dish is one of my husband's favorite growing up and this was the first time I made it for him. Thanks, Chef John! The recipe was easy to follow, the ingredients consist of things that you'll likely have in your pantry. 

I used leftover chicken from last night's dinner. Season-wise, the only salt I added was in the beginning with the mushrooms.  I did add a tablespoon or two more of flour to make it thicker. I didn't stray from the recipe too much.  Served it over rice. It was a hit with the husband. He said he was better that what he was used to. Yay!

FYI - The little note in this recipe says that it is 4 small servings or 2 large servings. It seemed to be twice that amount so guess what we're having for lunch tomorrow?

EASY GOOD. I love these one dish meals for Grandchildren day
and off to skating. I followed recipe, but always add some frozen corn and peas to this type of meal. Served over puffed
pastry. Very nice.

Oh my this was fabulous. I followed Chef Johns recommendation and served I’ve mashed potatoes,  another Chef John recipe which is also found on this site. Follow directions to a T it was throwback to when I first learned how to cook for my husband and I. This was my big famous dish back then. This recipe is so much better and I am also a much better cook. The video shows that both red and green bell pepper was used so that’s also what I did. Tasted this over white rice and mashed potatoes for comparison and the potatoes won out and had fewer calories. The gravy is silky, smooth and savory. Try it!

 It was very good.  Served over homemade biscuits.

Love all things Chef John and this was no exception. This was a trip down memory lane as Mom used to often make this dish. In keeping with her memory I added pimento. Not a fan of thyme so I left it out. Served over fresh French bread. Outstanding!!

This was absolutely delicious. I made 1/2 the recipe and served it over riced cauliflower for just my husband and me, but I wish I had made more - it was so good.  Go easy on the cayenne - a little goes a long way.

Haven't made this particular recipe yet, but have made chicken or turkey a la king many times.  This one looks perfect, but I always serve it over patty shells because that's how I have always done it, although the mashed potato approach looks great - love Chef John's videos and his recipes.!

Made as directed in the recipe, added some frozen corn and peas to add some color and bulk. Fresh nutmeg makes a huge difference however pinches can vary, thought 1/8 tspn would suffice but almost added too much heat for this dish. A bit of extra cream brought it back to center. Made over mashed potatoes and it was a nice comfort meal on a chilly evening.

I cut this to one serving for my BF using a leftover fried thigh ( breading removed). The only change I made was using whole milk, because that's what I had. I have made this a few times and it always turns out great. Don't cut back on the simmer times and definitely don't cut out the sherry! Growing up I always had it over egg noodles so why mess with a good thing.

Thyme was overwhelming. Didn't taste creamy as I expected it to. Very bland seasonings. Not the chicken à la king I'm accustomed to.

Yes! I left out the sherry ànd peppers because I didn't have any but it was still yummy over toast.  I àdded some frozen peas for color. Will make again often.

Chef John has shared yet another terrific recipe. This Chicken a la King is now added to my list of options to make for family and friends for a casual evening - or when someone needs a hug and a warm meal. This is Chicken a la King kicked up a notch! It was wonderful on Trader Joe's Brown Rice Medley, but you can't go wrong serving it on pasta or toast.

Chef John is my go to guy....great recipe as usual. I had leftover chicken breasts which I diced and added at end just to heat through. The spices make all the difference..I added a pinch of turmeric too. My Mom’s has a yellow tinge!

Didn't use the bell peppers because I didn't have any, but added a 10oz. bag of frozen mixed vegetables and served over rice.  It was good and will make it again.  I usually find Chef John's recipes are always great.
