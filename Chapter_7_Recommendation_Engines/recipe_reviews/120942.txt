I've been making this for a few years now ever since I found the recipe in a magazine.  It's really good for such an easy recipe to prepare.  (After baking, I top the chicken with sliced black olives, a bit of cheese, and chopped fresh cilantro and pop it back into the oven for a few minutes to be sure the cheese melts.)

I must say I wasn't expecting much out of this. In fact as I was mixing the sauce ingredients together I found the smell a little unappealing but I was looking for something easy for a weeknight dinner and this was it. I prepared it last night and put it in the fridge so all I had to do was pop it in the oven when I got home. This was quite good and pretty flavorful. The chicken was so tender and it went really well over white rice. My family really enjoyed it and it was so simple to throw together. Healthy too. I bet a little bit of shredded cheddar on top would be even better. I will definately make this again.

I mixed store bought salsa with homemade salsa which had a nice kick. I grilled slices of polenta instead of rice.  I made a side dish of frozen stir fried colored peppers and onions which I bought in the freezer section of the grocery store.  I layered it on the plate with a slice of polenta, a cut piece of chicken, a spoonful of peppers, and more sauce from the chicken dish and then a sprinkle of parmesan cheese. It was amazing.

Quick and easy and very tasty!!! I will back off just a little bit on the brown sugar the next time I make it though.

This is an easy, quick meal. Perfect for when I hadn't much time, and needed to grocery shop so I didn't have a lot of ingredients from which to choose.

Well, maybe I was really really hungry, but I was impressed. I served it over white rice, but I added a little extra brown sugar than called for. I liked the sweetness better than the sour of the mustard. Also I used the extra hot chunky salsa, which made it interesting.

My whole family loves this dish, which is always a bonus when all of my kids like the same meal.  It is super easy and quick to make and not like any other meal I prepare.

For what this recipe is it gets 5 stars to be filed under no brainer, ingredients always on hand, recipes.  I tried it knowing my husband who adds picante and brown sugar to the leftover spaghetti would like it.  I did cut back on the sugar just a bit per other reviews and used homemade salsa.  Will make this again.

I made the recipe exactly as written, it was delicious. Chicken was nicely moist and had the best flavor from the picante sauce. I did add some cheddar cheese on top as others suggested, even better. Even my two year old enjoyed! Thanks Karen!

I was a little leery about trying this recipe. I found it odd to mix salsa and mustard in one dish, but they surprisingly complimented each other well!

I thought this was delicious!  Made it just as written except cut it in half because there are just two of us.  I had some fresh cilantro so I added some to the sauce.  Like others, I sprinkled on some cheddar cheese the last few minutes of baking and I also put a dollop of sour cream on top and served over rice.  I definitly will be making this again.

My family loved this recipe, I changed it a little by using splenda brown sugar, and I also topped with cheese.

This is awesome!  So easy and the whole family just inhales it.  I even increase the recipe by half because if there's not enough for seconds, I'll hear about it.

Awesome!
I used a "make it yourself" picante thing that I got from TJ Max. I will be making this again!

I've made this several times and love it! Just had it again tonight. I don't change a thing, other than making extra sauce because we love it so much on our rice. Enjoy!
