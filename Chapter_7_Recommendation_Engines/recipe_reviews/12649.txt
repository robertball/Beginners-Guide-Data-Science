After reading the other reviews, I paid close attention to what I did as I made this pie.  I did not measure with great accuracy - just threw everything in a saucpan before I started to mix it all up.  I let it cook for about a minute after it started to boil, and then baked it per the directions.  If did not spill over, or burn. It came out of the oven hot and bubbling, and semi-firm. It set as it cooled...and was fantastic!!!  Incredibly rich and sweet.

Excellent! If you are having problems with the pie setting, make sure you don't just "bring to a boil" as the recipe states - make sure it is a good boil (as in more than 1 or 2 bubbles!). Make sure you stir constantly and you will notice the mixture thickens to almost a pudding consistency and gets a little darker as it begins to boil. I baked it for 10 mins @ 400 on bottom rack, then moved to top rack at 350 for 20 mins. Other than that, followed recipe to a tee. I love the crispy top! =] Manifique!

This is definitely delicious; I'm sure I will be making it again.  It's fantastic topped with vanilla ice cream--or accompanied by a tall glass of water: it's SO RICH, it almost chokes you.  It's easy to prepare and impressive to guests, but it does take a while to firm once it's out of the oven... after cooling for 20-30 minutes on the stove it was still far too liquid, so I put it in the refrigerator, and it took another half hour even then.  So, go ahead and make this, but bake ahead of time and let it set a good long while.

Someone please tell me what I did wrong.  I followed the recipe exactly, but the pie boiled over in the oven (I had it sitting on a cookie sheet). It was still too liquidy after 30 mins.  The pie crust on the edges burned where the sugar filling got on it.  I would like to try again because the smell and taste are great, but it really made a mess.

Although I could not sample this recipe myself as I am diabetic, I gave some to my friend who is francophone and grew up with this kind of pie, and I brought it to my church choir christmas party and my friend said it was just like she remembered and the choir members loved it... You really should let it boil a little before removing it from the heat, it helps it set better. Also don't fill the pie crust too full, that's when it will bubble over. thanks for submitting this recipe.

I had to do a report in my French class, and use a food example.  I used this pie and everyone loved it.  I am 12 years old.

Unbelievably easy to make. I liked this simple pie, it was like a pecan pie without the pecans, and not as sweet. But still good.

It worked out perfectly! My boyfriend is originally from Quebec and said this recipe was perfect! It was super easy to make, and I just used a prepackaged pastry pie crust that you roll out. Saves so much time! Plus with this recipe it gives it a much more creamier texture since the eggs are not present, so it's not that "pumpkin pie texture"... it's firm enough that it's easy to cut and serve, but creamy enough to melt in your mouth!!! Follow these directions exactly and I promise you will succeed!

This is a great recipe. I would suggest that you mix the flour and the sugar together VERY well before adding it to the sauce pan (this helps it to set). Also, when I made it, I didn't stop stirring until about two minutes after it was boiling. This made for a very smooth texture. One last thing, I added 2 tsp of vanilla instead of just one. Beautiful pie. Thanks!

I have had this in the past, and it is a diabetic's worst nightmare.  Very sweet, yummy, fantastic, but what a rush for the blood sugars!!!  

Just to mention you only need about 1/8th to 1/4 inch deep of the liquid in the pie crust for it to be the right thickness once baked.  Too much of a good thing is not better in this case.  More than 3/8ths and it takes the pie into just too much for a dessert.  

Like someone else said, I can make it for others, but not for myself.  My blood sugars rise just looking at the picture!!!

This was delicious!!  I made it for our Sunday company dinner, and it almost completely disappeared in about 5 minutes.  I did as one reviewer suggested and allowed the filling to simmer until thickened.

I visited Quebec City in July 2008. I bought a slice of Tarte au Sucre in the touristy area of the city and it wasn't as great as I was expecting. This recipe is fabulous!! It's exactly what I've been told Tarte au Sucre should taste like.  I'm not sure if I left it in the oven too long, because the filling had a delicious crust on it and it was like soft toffee! This may or may not have been a happy accident, but I'm glad it came out this way. You're left with bits of Tarte au Sucre in your teeth after finishing your slice, yummy!

Easy and really delicious. I think it serves more like 16 people not 8 because this is really rich and I don't think anyone in their right mind would have 1/8th of the pie. I loved this. It sounds like a good idea to have with vanilla ice cream but would likely be too much sweetness. I might add some pecans next time though to see how it turns out.
Thanks for the recipe. Wonderful.

It came out perfectly the first time! This was great and got lots of rave reviews at dinner. It tastes way better cold than out of the oven warm. I topped it with pecans to give it a butter tart type taste.   The only thing I think I will do differently is try a home made crust. Store bought crusts didn't do it justice!

Absolutely delicious!  This was so easy to make!  I put mine in a graham cracker crust.  It reminds me of a caramel peacan bar, and next time I will probably toast chopped pecans and toss them on the top to add some crunch.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

I had an extra pie crust made so I decided to try this. Based on other reviews, I cut the recipe in half to make one pie and the amount was perfect. When I opened my can of evaporated milk, I found it had gone bad so I used cream. Everything came out perfectly, including the consistency (I left it in the fridge for a while before eating) not too sweet (at least for me) as others had said. I did add pecans on top which was a great addition for a butter tart fan like me. I gave this five stars because not only does it taste good but it was soooo easy as to be virtually idiot-proof.

Interesting recipe, the pie or should I say pies turned out great.  The filling would have been a bit to much for one frozen pie shell so instead of throwing some out I made two out of it.   Sure its sweet but it is also tasty and goes great with whip cream or ice cream.

Although it took a long time to set (left it overnight), it turned out just right.  Had to give it a lower rating though because everyone thought it was just TOO sweet!  After eating an eighth my hands are shaking and my mind is going into hyper-drive!  Could try a little more vanilla, mix in a little maple syrup or walnuts next time.

Very delicious pie. I made this for dessert yesterday and served it with heavy cream. My family and friends loved it. Had an issue with it bubbling over the pan while baking, so next time I'll use a bigger pan and I also want to try some liqueur for a different flavour. Really loved this, so easy and yummy. Thanks.

I made this when I had about 10 people over for dinner.  It was not good at all, I blamed it on trying new recipes on the net.  Everyone tried it and no one wanted to take the extra pie home with them.   Would not recommend this!

Surprisingly delicious. When I want pecan pie but don't have nuts on hand this is a great option, and different from the southern Chess pie. A hit with my family

Substituted one cup of brown sugar for one cup of maple sugar but it didn't set.  Likely should have thrown a little flour into the mix.  Still though; made a good (if messy) treat.

A good recipe, but I am still searching for Belgian style sugar pie, which is less creamy.  Someone please subit one! ;)

A very good pie with a light toffee flavour. Not the kind of sugar pie you can find in the North of France or in Belgium, something different but as good. Ooh, by the way, I ate 1/8 of the pie, and I think I am right in my mind... ;)

Awesome!  I baked it for an extra 15 minutes on the bottom rack as I found the bottom wasn't golden enough and the top wasn't quite set yet.

I modified the recipe. Used 300ml eagle brand andsweetened condensed milk  then a half cup 2% milk and added a teaspoon of maple extract along with the vanilla. I also used pre-made tart shells. Turned out fantastic, sweet, but fantastic

Made this for a weekend getaway entertaining 10 of our friends at our cottage in Quebec - so popular it was requested again the second day! Made with my favourite from-scratch pie crust and served with BOURBON WHIPPED CREAM (substitute 1tbsp bourbon in place of vanilla) = TO DIE FOR!

I've made this recipe 2 years in a row. It's always a huge hit. It's so sweet and creamy, my family always wants more. I use 2 pie shells and allow the mixture to boil for a min or two, to avoid spillage. Today I made it for our thanksgiving dinner tonight, this time I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice. It is so tasty! I highly recommend making this!

This was too sweet and not "congealed" enough.  I am a sweet-a-holic, but it was just too much, even for me or my husband- who also loves his sweets.  I gave it two stars because the flavor was good but done wrong.

This recipe turned out great! Followed instructions and had absolutely no problems. Just make sure to let stove top mixture stay at a ROLLING boil for about 30 seconds while continuously stirring, and the pie filling should set up perfect!
Tried this on my boyfriend and he LOVED this....*very rich*

Had to rate it because it just doesn't have lots of reviews and I think it deserves it - so loved it - easy to make.  Only problem I had is I have to go make another one....

I even used milk because that's all I had.

Freaking delicious. easy too. its realy a giant butter tart, great with whipped cream. Its very sweet, so dont put sugar in the whip. a "boil" may not happen due to the thickness, just stir real well and it will come together nice. GREAT RECIPE

Initially, it came out looking cake-like around the edges and liquid in the center.  After it set, it was better, but still somewhat odd.  The taste was excellent, though, and more than made up for it! I would recommend coating it in caramel or drizzling with raspberry sauce to make it look and taste more delicious.

This is heavenly...absolutely perfect  if you have a big sweet tooth.  It's so sweet that I think I will have to  save it for very speciial occasions, like Christmas.  I had no difficulties making it, and it paired perfectly with a nice big glass  of cold milk and with a hot cup of coffee.  I'll definitely make it again.

Very easy and delicious!! Everyone loved it. I did use an 8 inch tart pan instead of a pie plate and it worked perfectly! Had to strain end mixture before putting it into crust because of flour lumps. . . will leave flour out next time.

We just didn't care for this one. It was simpleto put together, but the end product just was't very tasty. For all the brown sugar in it, it really lacked flavor.

Made this as a suprise for my husband...always loves it when his dad bakes a brown sugar pie.  This one does not even compare to the one that his dad makes.  Guess I should have gotten the recipe from him.  My dogs enjoyed the pie though!

So I made another immediately as my Dad is the one who requested this.

Perfect and is very easy to make.  The only thing I did a bit different was that I added the salt to the mixture of flour and brown sugar and mixed that.  Then I cut in the butter into the mixture until it resembled coarse meal, then added the vanilla to the evaporated milk when I then added to themixture before bringing it to a boil  Next time I just might add raisins.  If you like raisin butter tarts then just add raisins and you will have raisin butter tarts.

Husband from Ottawa says this is the closest recipe to his mother's. Also works well as tartlettes in large muffin pan, which are easier for parties.

this was easy to make and oh, so delicious!! perfect thick consistency. I waited for a really solid rolling boil to get going (stirring constantly) before I removed from heat.

Getting ready to make and I remember my mother making Brown Sugar Pie with Dark Brown Sugar.  Did anyone make using Dark or was it assumed by all to use Light Brown?

Totally AWESOME!! used 1/2 & 1/2  cream because I didn't have any evaporated milk.  Didn't cook the filling,  just mixed all ingredients (except butter) in a bowl, poured it into the pie shell,  added a dash of nutmeg and then dotted with butter.  Brushed the edge of the crust with egg wash, baked @ 450 degrees for 5 min. and lowered to  350 degrees for another 25 min. Best sugar pie EVER! 
thanks for sharing!

Really good, but super rich. Reminded me a bit of the caramel pie at O'Charley's (which is also super rich). Thanks for sharing!

Recipe tasted just like I remembered it while growing up in Quebec.  We added vanilla ice cream to make it absolutely perfect!

I will definitely make this again. I let the sugar mixture boil a couple of minutes while stirring constantly, and the filling set perfectly. If caramel and pecan pie had a love child, this pie is it.

Great!  I made this pie because I have to take a pie to an outdoor pie auction in the summer - and I work that day so I'll be making it on an extended lunch break.  I'm taking an apple but just in case it explodes I wanted to premake another the night before.  Tried this one a few days ahead of time and it is so fantastic!  I'm english Canadian and no one has heard of it but...whatever.  Delicious, easy and came out perfect.

Growing up in Quebec, I've made this with my grandma and have made this several times as an adult! It's always a big hit! I've made it with evaporated milk, cream or milk and it always turns out great! Definitely deserves 5 stars!

I followed the recipe exactly, and chilled for about two hours following. It was absolutely perfect! VERY rich, and not for the casual sweet eater. My diabetic mother had to pass, but everyone else loved it. 

Another reviewer was correct when suggesting vanilla ice cream, it's the perfect compliment.

I made this pie yesterday, and after pouring it boiling into the frozen pie crust, I baked it at 400 degrees for 10 mins, then 325 degrees for 25 mins. It turned out BEAUTIFUL and SO delicious. Wow. LOVE this recipe!
