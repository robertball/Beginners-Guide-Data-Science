I tried this recipe and got granola also, so I looked up some other recipes and then added some more liquid to this recipe.  I added 1/4 cup peanut butter (almond butter would work), 1 egg, and changed the oil to 1/4 cup.  They turned out great!

Thanks to the OP for the submission and getting me rolling on this.  

I also found it to be quite dry so broke down and added 1/2c water when binding since there was an equal portion of (coconut) flour.  In truth, I wish that it had been boiling water and I had added it to the dates soften them in advance.  That being said, I will likely double the date portion as I would have preferred a 'wetter' bar.

This recipe makes some really tasty granola (not a bar, but granola)! I followed the recipe as directed except I used figs and instead of raisins, and used 2 cups pecans and 1 cup of walnuts instead of the other way around. I did add 1/4 cup almond butter before putting it in the oven when I realized that it wouldn't hold together in a bar and was going to be more like granola to see if that would help bind the ingredients together, but it still turned out to be a granola that had to be eaten with a spoon. Did an ingredient get left out, or a quantity get entered wrong? I hope the person that posted this recipe comments, because otherwise I loved it and even the skeptics kept going back for second and third helpings, but I really wanted a bar that would be easy to take along.

After reading the reviews on this, I added two eggs and about a 1/2 cup of water to make the batter more smooth.  It helped a lot but was still a little dry.  Overall the bars tasted very good, but the recipe may need a little more tweaking.

Very good and flavorful! Also substituted...1/4 cup oil, PB fit powder, 1 egg and 1/4 water. Next time will increase water to 1/2 or even 3/4 cup. Slightly drier than I would have liked and ends fell apart but cut into squares pretty well as you can see by pic.

Ok I read the reviews and made a lot of changes and it worked great, so that’s why three stars as in the end was quite a different recipe.  I soaked the dates in boiling water. I puréed them (and the water) with the other dried fruits. I added an egg and peanut butter.  I also added ground flax, almond flour and hemp hearts.  230 deg wasn’t hot enough, so I did 350 as suggested by a different recipe and they are chewy, soft, and very much so retain their shape.  Will make them again!

This recipe makes crumble NOT bars!  I added 1 cup of greek yogurt and it still wouldn't stick together.  The recipe is incomplete or just plain bad.  A total waste of money!

Yep, dry granola. Didn't read the reviews until afterward and wish I had. I will try adding an egg and more coconut oil next time for sure.
