Good stuff! I used just the beginning as my "base" - oatmeal, peanut butter and honey in the amounts listed. Instead of coffee and chocolate I added chia seeds and chopped up dried fruit - pineapple, apricots and dates.  With these substitutions my final energy balls were quite moist, and I think I will play more with proportions.  Probably up the oatmeal and chia and leave everything else the same - I definitely wanted it to be a bigger batch!

It's a great breakfast snack! I have a hard time eating early in the mornings because my stomach just isn't quite awake when I first get up, but it's important for me to eat a little something especially before I work out. This is perfect for that! I'll probably add more coffee to my next batch just because I love coffee, but otherwise it's perfect!

Not bad. I used chocolate chips, since I didn't have big pieces of chocolate to break up. (For anyone else who needs to know,  2 oz of chocolate is just over 1/3 of a cup.) My only complaint about this recipe is that I ended up with little bitter specks of coffee that didn't blend with the other flavors. This is definitely worth making again, but next time I'll try a more finely ground instant coffee. I bet it would be delicious with a presweetened, flavored kind, as another reviewer suggested. All in all, this was a quick, easy recipe that makes a tasty snack for coffee lovers!  

Update: I made the recipe again with instant cappuccino powder, which was good and didn't have that bitter taste. However, I had to add an extra couple tablespoons of it to get a strong enough coffee flavor. I used about half the white chocolate it called for, since the coffee had sugar of its own. Still plenty sweet! I rolled the finished balls in grated coconut, which added a nice flavor as well as made them look pretty.

I have made these several times. I found a peanut butter called Bees Knees with honey already in it so it makes it so much easier. Then I found that the same brand makes another flavor which is cinnamon raisin and used that omitting the honey and I added finely chopped walnuts to the mix. I also sprinkled these with a little cinnamon sugar. Yummy. My next attempt will be with their maple flavored peanut butter just for a change but I have to say both the recipes that I have made have come out great . One other thing I omitted the white chocolate and just added the mini dark choc morsels instead.
 They are a great little pick me up in the early morning. By the way Amazon carries the peanut butter if you can't find it on the shelf at your grocery.

Who would have thought something so simple could be so delicious! I don't even care for peanut butter, chocolate and oats yet I was scarfing these down. Making it again today and throwing in some toffee bits for good measure. You won't regret trying this recipe.
