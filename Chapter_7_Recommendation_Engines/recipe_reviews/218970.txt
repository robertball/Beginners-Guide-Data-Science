This is a geat recipe. I omit the water and use a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes. The tomatoes add a wonderful flavor. When cooking with bag you get plenty of liquid to use with the leftovers for soup.

I made this with skinless, bone-in chicken thighs, and seasoned w/ salt and sage.  Used chicken broth instead of the bouillon/water, and added about a cup of pinot grigio to deglaze after I had browned the chicken.  Added a packet of onion & mushroom soup, and a can of fire roasted tomatoes.  Very tasty -- saving the left over liquid for future use as it is so flavorful.  There's really nothing complicated to the dish -- you can add all sorts of things to suit your tastes.  I bet it would be great with some jalapenos in there to spice it up or try some parsnips in there or rutabaga.

This was a very simple recipe, but, so tasty!   I added some some lemon pepper and rubbed sage to the chicken for additional flavor and used only about 1 cup of liquid.  The chicken was moist and flavorful and the veggies were perfectly tender with a lot of flavor.  Perfect for our Sunday dinner!

I followed the recipe as written. It was very flavorful and the chicken was great. Even my pickiest child, who normally won't eat chicken or potatoes, ate it all up!

The only small change I made to this was using a 3 qt cooker and unsalted vegy broth!  I added  fresh tyme witch really was good.  Since I am only cooking for two I half the recipe  and this recipe was very good.

It was excellent!  Used chicken broth instead of bouillon.  Used thighs instead of whole chicken.

Excellent recipe, very tasty. I did deglaze with Cabernet Sovignon wine after braising, used chicken stock with a little extra chicken bouillon, used multi colored carrots, added 1 parsnip and 1 rutabaga.  This recipe is a keeper!
