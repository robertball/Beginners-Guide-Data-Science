I make a miniature version by placing using biscuits and ramekins so everyone can have the perfect amount of crust (top and bottom!). I peel flaky style Grand's biscuits in half, place 1 half in bottom of each ramekin, bake for 6 minutes, fill with pot pie mixture and top with the other half of the biscuit and bake for 10-12 minutes. This is the perfect pot pie recipe!

Really easy. I prefer celery instead of corn though for the veggies to go with the carrots and peas. Also, I think the gravy is better if you use chicken broth for at least part of the liquid. The puff pastry makes a great topper!

This was extremely tasty.  I used some extras to make sure that there were enough flavors.  I cooked diced potatoes and carrots (I didn't have any frozen) and then used a cup of the cooking water and added a chicken bullion cube.  I substituted that cup of water for a cup of the milk.   I also sauteed an onion with some chopped garlic and added that to the mix.  For the crust I used low fat crescent rolls.   Of course, now I don't know how the original recipe would be without my modifications but this will absolutely become a staple for me!!  Thanks for the idea!

This is a really great recipe.  I did season the chicken a little more and also added potatoes and one can of cream of mushroom soup.  Everything stayed the same and can't wait to eat some more tomorrow!!

This recipe was okay. The filling is a little bland. I used a store bought pie crust instead of the puff pastry for a more traditional pot pie. I will make again but I will take advise and add potatoes and use chicken broth as part of the liquid:)

I enjoyed this pot pie, but that is because (after tasting the filling) I added some MUCH NEEDED touch ups to it.  In addition to the Thyme I also added in some Tarragon, white pepper, onion powder & garlic powder; without such additions it was VERY bland.  I also boiled up 2 potatoes and threw those in there as well.  The use of the puff pastry tasted really good & was a great idea too; loved that part.  All in all, a great concept, but needed alot of tweaking...

This is very tasty. I was looking for a pot pie recipe that was creamy, but didn't use canned soup and this one works.

A LOW FAT VERSION! I took left over chicken and added a ton of veggies.. then sauteed onions and garlic and added a  little  butter and oil and flour..then used condensed skim milk and spices added that to the milk and poured it over the veggie/chicken  mixture.. I topped it with mashed potatoes instead of pastry dough..YUMMY!! THANKS SO MUCH! Great for this rainy cold day!

Good pot pie ! Use pie crust dough it cost less and not googy on the bottom. frozen pastry puff dough cost more and  the bottom of pie gets googy. =D

I was looking for a pot pie recipe that didn't include cream soups or broth, since I had neither. This recipe fit the bill and was absolutely fantastic! It was shockingly delicious. I had to change a few things. Since I didn't have puff pastry I made pie crusts instead. Baked the bottom crust in the pie pan at 350 for 15 mn, then added the filling and covered it with the top crust. I also only had canned veggies. I used green beans, corn and sliced potates (from the can) cut up. I just added the veggies directly from the can to the creamed mixture. My family couldn't get enough!

We did enjoy this pot pie because of the use of the puff pastry as the crust instead of the traditional pie crust.  I did use fresh vegetables instead of frozen (carrots, potatoes and broccoli) and I boiled the chicken because I wanted it to be shredded instead of in chunks. Also, next time I will add more spices (garlic powder or crushed garlic, sage,etc..) because it was a little bland.  I think it is a great starter recipe!!

Thanks for the recipe! I didnt follow exactly because I didnt have everything called for and also just to suit our tastes. I'm rating it a 5 because I'm sure it would taste just as good if followed to the T, and it is also a good idea and a good base recipe if you're picky :) I used frozen peas, fresh carrots and garlic and potatoes and microwaved covered with a little water about 5 minutes to steam all the veggies. Didn't have thyme, used 21 seasoning blend and eyeballed it. had about 1/2 cup leftover turkey gravy which my mom made for thanksgiving, used that, about 1/2 cup vegetable broth and 1 cup milk for the sauce and added flour till thickened. I also used the butter, juices and bits scraped from the pan I used to cook the chicken instead of using the 2tb butter. It was so so good! My husband who isnt crazy about chicken, loved it so much, he ate half of the pie! One more thing, I didnt bother with the cutting and weaving the crust. I just baked it till barely browning on sides and then laid it over the top of the dish with the corners hanging over the sides.  Looked great that way too. Sorry for not rating the original recipe but i will try it that way too, it will be great!

Recipe doesn't specify to prepare puff pastry with butter between the layers, so I didn't do that. It was awful to work with, and there was no way I could create a lattice! I ended up with a pile of layers on top of my chicken/veggie mixture, and drizzled melted butter over all of it to keep the pastry from drying out. It all tasted fine, but I was very disappointed.

Great recipe!!  I was looking for a low sodium recipe and was worried that this one would be too bland, as it did not include cream of soup, or broth.  To my surprise, this was the best pot pie I've ever had!  I didn't have any thyme, but used a few pinches of garlic powder and was great.  I also didn't cook the frozen veggies or crust prior to baking.  I cooked chicken, then melted the butter, added the flour and milk, veggies, and cooked chicken.  Mixed all together, poured into 8x8 pan, and put pie crust over and then baked.  Next time I will add some potatoes, which I would recommend cooking a bit prior.  My husband and 6 yr old daugher are very picky, and they both had seconds!  This will be made weekly in my house. Thank you!!

Eh... I think that the puff pastry gave it a good texture, but the actual filling was a little bland... maybe a little too easy. But it tasted decent, at least we aren't starving! :)

This was definitely simple to make, I just didn't love the crust on top.  I guess I usually like the more traditional biscuit top.

It’s a keeper. I used cream of chicken soup instead of making my own base, so that cut me a step. I also used mixed frozen veggies (any vegetables would do, not just carrots, peas, and corn). On top I rolled out a sheet of refrigerated canned croissant dough instead of frozen puff pastry, because it already had perforation holes, looked pretty, and didn’t require time to thaw, cut and weave, so that cut me yet another step. So, it was easy and the kids ate it. I didn’t care for the amount of thyme though... will either cut down on it or will use rosemary or poultry seasoning next time. Will also think about adding some more “oomph” to it, as overall it was a bit bland. However, this is a great base recipe and really easy to make. Thank you!

I doubled this recipe, making the recommended substitution of half the specified milk for low sodium chicken stock. I also made two pies, one with celery substituted for the peas. The peas offered a much better flavor, of course. I also highly recommend just making the filling and serving this with bread sticks, as I accidentally did. The results were subversive, tasty, and well worth making again.

Time out on the Thyme!  I would have given this 4 stars but 1 tsp. of thyme was way too much.  It overpowered the other flavors in this dish.  I may make it again, but will half the amount.  I added a buillion cube to the milk mixture for added flavor and I used pie crust instead of puff pastry.

I used the filling of this recipe and baked it in a more typical chicken pot pie. It was tasty but could do with some extra flavor. I'd try condensed soup to substitute half the milk next time.

We loved it! I added some Minced Garlic and Italian Seasoning to my Sauteed Chicken. And used Veg.all for the vegetables. All I had was Filo dough and we brushed butter between the layers. it turned out so Good.

Great recipe.  We made it but with quite a few changes:      1.  we used Grands! flaky Biscuits instead of phyllo - cut each biscuit in half horizontally. Place on top of filling.
2. Used 1 cup milk and 1-1/4 cups broth instead of all milk.
3. Decreased thyme to 1/2 t. and added 1/2 t. each season salt and garlic salt.
4. Added sauteed onion (1/2 C) and sauteed sliced mushrooms (approx 6) to filling.
5. Used cooked carrots, peas and broccoli or cauliflower to measure 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 C. Eliminated corn and used 1/2 can potatoes (diced) instead.

Delicious. Added a little more corn to mine for the kids, but my four fussy boys gobbled it down. Great recipe. Thanks to whomever posted it.

Incredibly bland and I'm not picky. I even had pepper on it. I won't make it again and I'm going to have to add garlic powder and tarragon for the leftovers.

I made this recipe because I had a sheet of leftover puff pastry, but did not want to make a dessert.  This was about the only recipe I could find that called for one sheet of puff pastry and was not a dessert.  The recipe was fine, but didn't 
"wow" us.  I would probably not make it again because puff pastry is expensive, and there are other, better chicken pot pie recipes.

Delicious pot pie. The only drawback I have is that we saved the remaining food for leftovers, which wasn't as good as the night before due to the puff pastry loosing it's fresh crispiness. 

So, when I make it again, I'll make just enough for the two of us or make the full recipe for whenever our daughter and her fiance or our son stops by.

The meal was absolutely delicious, I will definitely make it again.

I used this recipe as something to follow.  I absolutely loved the idea of pie crusts being cut into strips something I'll keep in mind in the future. I used leftover turkey instead

Me and my Husband made this today, it was really awesome he couldn't get enough. The only thing different I did was use half and half instead of milk and used the layers biscuits we couldn't find the pastry dough. I am glad we did though it was amazing.
