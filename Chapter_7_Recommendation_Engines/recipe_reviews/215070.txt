I was making the recipe *Freeda's Fabulous Fish" from here and it called for a soy-based steak marinade. Since I wasn't sure what that was, I used this recipe. Woozers, it made a great fish dish! Thanks!

This is OK, but with a few extra ingredients as in Best Steak Marinade in Existence and you will have a superb marinade.

Thought this was great! Made one small change by adding sugar to the mix. It makes it sweeter and more caramelized when grilled.

The flavor of this marinade was really good we didn't even think the steak needed any sauce. I have tried tons of marinades and each one has something different to lend to the steak and this was as good as any other recipe I have tried. The bonus to this recipe is that its something that you usually already have on hand and my 10 year old son who loves to help in the kitchen was able to throw this together for our steaks!!

This really is the greatest steak marinade! Very flavorful. Very quick and easy. I alter it occasionally by adding a little sugar. This is the family's favorite.
