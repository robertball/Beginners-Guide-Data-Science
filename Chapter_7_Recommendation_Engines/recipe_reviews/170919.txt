These were very good--the only thing I did was add about double the strawberries. They are very moist, rose nicely and are just sweet enough. I only made half a batch, which is probably a good thing, because they really do taste best the first day. They get a little gooey the next day and more so the third. I used all regular whole wheat flour, because that's all I had. I will probably try these again.
