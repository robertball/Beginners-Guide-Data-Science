in the 9x13 dish I mixed cream of mushroom and milk. then mixed stuffing mix. I added just enough water so that the stuffing wasn't too thick. then I added a can of diced tomatoes and mixed in the meatballs. put mozzarella cheese on top, enough that it covered everything. then I sprinkled basil and a little garlic. delish! 
absolutely no need to dirty an extra dish by making stuffing first. 1 dosh meal.

Overall this was just okay taste wise. Cooking it was not as easy as the recipe makes it out to be. Prep was easy but cooking took a lot longer. It took 40 minutes. This is likely because I used a 8x8 dish because when I mixed it in the 9x13 dish it didn't fill it. After 40 minutes I gave up and microwaved individual servings.

I've made this recipe so many times over the years. Its from a Kraft's recipe magazine. Every time I make it, it gets raved reviews. I have also used mixed vegetables in this recipe b/c I'm not a huge fan of pea's.  Its a great meal to bring to family's in need of a meal because its something different from beef or chicken meals.

This was very easy and very good.  I do not understand the review that says it didn't cook through and had to be microwaved.  What's to cook?  Everything is pre-cooked and just has to be heated...except the stuffing that is cooked in boiling water at the very beginning.  I did use Muenster cheese instead of cheddar because I prefer white cheese on poultry.
