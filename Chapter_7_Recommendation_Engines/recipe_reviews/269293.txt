Overall, this overnight oat recipe is a good starting point. 1 tbsp of cinnamon, though? That's too much--and takes it from a nice spiciness, to bitter really fast. I only used a teaspoon of it, and that was plenty for a cinnamon-lover like myself (my husband would prefer a 1/2 tsp or less). Also, 1/4 cup milk was not enough liquid to soften 3/4 cup of oats properly (even with the 1/2 cup of yogurt). So I added in an additional 1/4 cup of milk, and let it sit for a few hours longer. With these changes, it came out tasting pretty good, with a nicer texture! Next time I would use brown sugar or maple syrup in place of white sugar, add a few drops of vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt.
