Great soup.  I made mine in the slow cooker.  It was super easy and fast.  I added 2 raw whole chicken breasts, all the ingredients (I didn't even chop the onions or tomatillo's, just added them whole) I put it on low for about 6 hours, then I put everything except the chicken breasts in my blender.  I shredded the chicken, and added the puree back to the pot.  Voila!

I've only recently discovered tomatillos, and was so happy to find this recipe! I used just over a pound of tomatillos but I definitely think I should have used more - the broth was a little too watery for my liking. I added a little bit of cumin, and also a splash of lime juice. The flavor was absolutely outstanding! I will be making this again! Thanks!

Nice Southwestern dish. The recipe is worth five stars when tomatillos are in season, during the summer months.   Best with more tomatillos - I doubled the quantity, pureeing half and coarsely chopping the other half.

This was delicious! Following other reviews, I used more tomatillos (1.5 lbs) to make the soup thicker, and I reduced the (vegetable) broth to 3 cups. It came out slightly thinner than a good pea soup--just right. I made it without chicken and instead topped it with chopped avocado, which was excellent. I had two leftover Jamaican hot peppers, so I threw those in instead of jalapenos, which made the soup plenty hot--I didn't even need to add cayenne or hot sauce (and I love heat).

This soup was excellent! I made this to use up some tomatillos my mother gave me from her garden. I saw that someone thought the soup was too thin, so I cooked a small potato and blended it into the mixture to thicken it. Then I added black beans and orzo to add a little extra to it and served it with a dollup  of sour cream as suggested.  Will definately be making alot more of this one!

I really love this soup, and I make it every time I buy fresh tomatillos. The flavor is wonderful - like a spicy hot and sour soup. I like to use a few more tomatillos than the recipe calls for. To thicken it, I add just a little rice, white or brown, and I add crisp sweet corn for color and sweetness. This is SUCH a wonderful recipe! So tasty and delicious!

Delicious, tangy soup! I added a little garlic salt as well as some ground cumin to add a more mexican flavor. I used cubed chicken rather than shredded and it was still very yummy. Thanks for this recipe!

This has a wonderful, unusual, hot and sour flavor to it. I did follow some of the advice of other reviewers and added a can of black beans and about a cup of frozen corn to give it a little more body. I am not adventurous when it comes to spicy food, but two jalepenos seeded and minced were not too spicy. I even added a little of the hot sauce, although none of the cayenne pepper. I thought the taste was very good. I think if you don't like tomatillos or sour soup, you probably wouldn't like this, but since I like both I was very happy with it.

I was really disappointed after the other rave reviews.  The soups was a very thin broth with hunks of chicken floating in it.  It was not very interesting and I won't make it again.

Excellent Soup! The flavors and spice were great. The only thing I changed is I increased the cilantro to 1/4 cup, I added about a half cup of hominy after I pured the vegies and cooked for about 15 miniutes to get the flavor of the hominy throughout the soup (4 servings) and topped it off with a tablespoon of shredded Monterey Jack per bowl. This is definitely going in my recipe box!

I was a little reluctant, but wow to my surprise. This was a little spicy but full of flavor. I have added this to our household menu.

I grew tomatillos in my garden last summer, and wasn't sure what to do with them until I tried this recipe.  It is an amazing soup.  I slice corn tortillas and bake in oven until crispy,  then add to soup.

This soup was good.  If you like green enchilada sauce, then you may like this as it is like a soup-version of green sauce.  I did add some corn to give it more texture and color, as well as used a tidbit of instant mashed potatoes to thicken up the consistancy

I happened upon a box of tomatillos at the local donation shelter... the ladies there had no idea what they were or what to do with them.  So I took the whole box home and found this recipe, and let me tell you WOW!  The only reason I am not giving it five stars is because the recipe needs tweaking to make it perfect.  Once you make the changes, I would pay $10 for a bowl of this in a restaurant.  I followed the other reviewer's suggestions and used slightly more tomatillos than the recipe calls for, maybe a pound and a half or so.  I also used chicken boullion instead of chicken broth.  After pureeing the base, I added a can of corn and a can of drained rinsed black beans, as well as a tsp of cumin.  The result was fantastic!  Whatever you do, do NOT skip the cilanto (it adds a note of citrus and brightens up the flavor) or the sour cream (it adds a touch more acidity and a bit of creaminess to the texture).  The only thing I would change is to add maybe a splash of fresh lime juice, other than that after making the modifications listed above the recipe is spot on.  I served this to my family with homemade southwest egg rolls, and they couldn't stop eating it.  It was so good, I even made a batch to take down to the donation shelter to share with the workers.

Very tasty.  I added a few extras....kidney beans, char grilled corn, some tomato and jalepenas.  Had to make it go a bit further!  It is a great main course soup.  Next time I might even add a little rice to thicken a bit more, but it is an excellent soup.

I really loved this recipe. I cut the jalapeno down to half which was a good thing because this was a bit spicy with half, but it was excellent. Wonderful soup for a cold day. I also used 4 cups bouillon instead of actual chicken stock. I did not add hot pepper sauce or cayenne pepper as this would have been inedible even for the brave. I eat jalapenos whole and cutting down the jalapenos was perfect for me. All in all, excellent recipe. Love the tomatillos. Gave this four stars only because of the excessive call for spice.

This soup was perfect for a cold night.  I followed the advise from some of the other reviews and added: beans, corn, garlic salt, a little extra buoillion, and cumin.  I could have used a few extra tomatillos!  We served it over brown rice with tortilla chips on the side.

This was my first time trying tomatillo. I loved this soup. I like a little body to my soup so I added 2 cans of drained black beans, one potato and a can of corn. I also used double the amount of tomatillo. Next time I think I will add a little more chicken as well. For a light soup this would be good just as the recipe is written. I did a search to find out how to pick out the best tomatillo and the article said the smaller ones are less sour. I did use mostly the smaller ones and found my soup to have just the right tang. Yummy!!!

This was great soup! Changed the recipe a bit - added a bit of cumin and marjoram and some corn and black beans at the end of the cooking to make it a bit more filling. Also, like another reviewer, I just added all the ingredients (whole) to the crock pot and then after about 5.5 hours on high, took out the chicken and shredded it and blended the rest and then added the chicken back - sooooo good and SO easy!

Excellent recipe and flavorful-reminds me of a base for a good green chili sauce!  I made some minor additions/changes; first I rubbed the tomatillos in olive oil and put under the broiler for about 5 min. to bring out the flavors, and just crushed them after adding to the soup.   Also added some cumin.  Will be making this again, so thanks for the post, Holly.

Great soup, I gave 4 stars because I had to add cumin, black beans to give it real flavor.  It's a good base though.  I used all the stock, but then remove a cup of it before pureeing the veggies and then added some back to the pot to improve the consistency.  I didn't puree all the veggies (only about 75% of them).  I liked the texture this way.  Also needs a lot more tomatillos.

I canned this soup in pint jars.  After calling the canning help line, I placed one Tbsp lemon juice per pint jar and used in a waterbath canner for 15 minutes.  Quarts would require 2 Tbsp and 20 minutes of water bath time.

I absolutely loved it! While making it, I wasn't too sure about it, but once I tasted it I was shocked! Since I have a two yr. old, I did not add the chilies, what I did was chopped jalapenos and put them on the side so that we could add it separately, along with white rice and pinto beans and bolillos.

This is a wonderful soup hot and sour.  I also didn't puree the vegatables.  I added shredded cheddar cheese to the soup.  Will make this soup again.

The flavor is just wonderful. Kind of like a sweet and sour with a bit of a kick to it. I have actually never made anything with tomatillos and found this recipe because a friend gave me a bagful from her garden (she did not know what to do with them either!). I just dumped everything in my crockpot for several hours, took a bit out and pureed it. Then i added a bag of frozen corn. I will totally make this again... yummm!

Put everything in the crockpot the night before except for the chicken. Added 2 large boneless chicken breasts in the am.  Looked weird when I got home - took a stick blender to it.  Shredded the chicken and put it back.  Added hot sauce, cumin, 1 can or rinsed black beans and about a cup of frozen corn.  Was out of cilantro and sour cream, served over crushed fritos and topped with shredded cheese - 12 year old son asked for 2nds! Husband asked for 2nds - glad to have something to do with the tomatillo's.  They were volunteers from last year when I didn't know what to do with them and left them out to rot!

Awesome recipe. It has been a long time that I have been wanting to use tomatillos. Thanks for the post but also thanks to the other reviewers whose advise I took:
1. I do believe the original recipe can be bland and waterry.  So, I added 1 cup less of the chicken stock.  I also added a mexican spice blend, a red pepper, and adoba. I also fried the chicken in chipotole pepper sauce. It was awesome. I could not believe I ate 3 bowls. We added tortillas on top.

I also used the slow cooker, but didn't have any chicken handy so I used some sausages that were handy. My husband doesn't like hot foods so I cut back on the cayenne. I think this would be good with some gabanzo beans. Great way to use us all those tomatillos that got ripe at the same time.

I wish it were a bit thicker. But good flavor. I didn't need to put in cayenne pepper or hot sauce, it was spicy enough! And I like spicy!

I love this soup!!! I will make this again and again, and I never do that. I rarely make the same meal once every 6 months, but I bet I will make this at least twice a month from now on! I did leave the chicken out and subbed a can of rinsed and drained black beans instead. Fantastic!

What a fantastic recipe!  I substituted a roasted poblano for the jalapenos, since I can't take too much spice.  I also added a can of black beans that I had on hand.  The broth was a bit thinner than I expected, but the flavor was so good, it doesn't matter.

This recipe is very versatile.  For a big pot of soup I used about 3lbs of tomatillos and about an equal number of baked potatoes with liberal amounts of the rest of the ingredients and used a stick blender on it. (I got it thicker than it needed to be.)  I served this great tart broth with sides of baked corn tortilla strips, cubed avocado, shredded chicken thighs (from the broth), green onions, cilantro, and sour cream.  I got rave reviews.

This recipe was good!  I thought the recipe was a little bland at first (hence 4 stars instead of ) so I added a few dashes of cumin and a couple of teaspoons of chicken boullion.  I topped each bowl with the suggested fresh leaves of cilantro and sour cream...don't skip the sour cream!  It really added a nice touch to the soup.  I also topped  with some avocado.  So delicious!  Everyone was a fan at dinner.

Loved this! It feels like a wonderful Southwestern dish, and somehow perfect for the summer. I served it with brown rice and cold drinks.   Added a small handful of brown rice to thicken it up per other reviews, as well as a can of sweet corn. It was somehow amazingly delish-- sour, spicy, and fresh... would've been good even without the corn, though the corn does make it look much nicer. I hand-shredded my chicken and it turned out nice and juicy; topped it with mashed avocado instead of sour cream (which wasn't bad!). I liked it with more cilantro, and can't wait to try it with black beans next time!

Very delicious soup, good basic recipe!  Following other suggestions used 1.5 lbs tomatillos. Used leftover shredded spicy pork instead of shredded chicken as well.   Tasted the soup before adding the hot pepper sauce and it was very tangy/vinegar-y. Hot pepper sauce cut the vinegar flavor and did not add much heat. If you don't like the flavor of your soup, adjust the seasonings! I didn't measure the hot pepper sauce, just kept adding drops and retasting until I liked it.  Cilantro is a must, I was skeptical but it really adds to the flavor. Sour cream makes it creamier if you like a more substantial soup.  Served with tortilla chips as well, big hit with all the kids!

After reading the reviews, I decided to add a can of black beans (when I added the tomatillos)to the soup. I also added about 2 teaspoons of cumin and 4 hot peppers instead of 2. The result was a delicious, tangy and (not too)spicy soup!

Very delicious. Better than I expected. Although it would not be the same without the cilantro and sour cream. If anything, make sure you add the cilantro. I will make this again!

Super easy Tomatillo Soup recipe. I used shredded chicken and about 7 tomatillos but would maybe add few more next time. I also didn't purée it for a long time so it was still a little chunky. . When I taste tested it, it was a bit sour so I added some cumin, garlic salt, red pepper flakes, and a little salt and cooked it for another 10 minutes on low.. My husband and I really liked it. I served it with a cheese quesadilla and it was a hit!

I love this soup!!! We grow tomatillos in our garden and we always have a ton of them. This is one of my favorite things to do with them. I do not alter the recipe (other than sometimes stirring in some cooked rice to give it a little more body) but I usually make a quad-batch when I make this... it is addictive!! Thanks for sharing this brilliant recipe!

I've always liked the taste of tomatillos so this recipe appealed to me.  Instead of chopping and saute the onions, garlic, peppers, and tomatillos, I halved them all and put them all on a heavy baking sheet and put them under the broiler for a few minutes to get that roasted taste to them.  I then put that mixture into a food processor and processed for only a minute.  I read the bit about the soup being a bit too thin, so I used the schmaltz from the chicken ( I make my own stock) and made a roux before adding the stock and other ingredients. I added crushed red peppers instead of cayenne and chopped a small bunch of cilantro into the soup as well (I doubled the recipe).  I agree that more tomatillos would be an improvement, so I will adjust that next time.  We like a lot of flavors and spice in our foods, so I think I will add more jalapenos next time as well, perhaps even some poblanos or hatch peppers for more of a chili flavor.  This time, however, I am serving the soup with fresh garnishes of jalapenos, cilantro, avocados, and non-fat plain yogurt.

Delicious! I had only a few tomatillos so unfortunately I had to reduce the quantity of this. I made a few minor changes based on what I had in the kitchen: I used Persian lime infused olive oil to cook the chicken and veggies in, added celery and shallots to the onions and garlic, and had to leave out the sour cream because I'm doing the Whole 30 and had to make this completely paleo. I wish I had an immersion blender because I made a mess, but it was worth it. So yummy!

for me, the flavor of this recipe...It's what I'm always craving and looking for when I go out in search of Mexican Cuisine.

Thank you so much.  This is exactly what I want.  It's amazing.
The only difference for me was, I added one celery stalk and one avocado.  a little more of the flavor and depth that I want in a soup.  Oh and I squeezed some lime juice into the bowl just before serving.  Worked amazingly.  excellent!!!!

First time I've made tomatillo soup. The entire family loved it- 8 year old and 11 year old, included! I added extra tomatillo to make it thicker as others recommended. I made a crockpot chicken and broth for the recipe and it was wonderful. Next time I'll add some water to cut the chicken flavor back. Also, if you want leftovers be sure to double the recipe- this made just enough for our family of four.

This soup was so easy to make.  Even through I modified the recipe's directions, I stuck with the basic ingredients.  I grilled spicy chicken (using a spicy rub that had paprika, ground cayenne, onion and garlic powder, and black pepper) on the George Foreman first.  While it cooled, I started the onions and garlic as the recipe states.  It was my first time cooking with tomatillos and found it easy. I cut up the chicken while the soup simmered then I used an immersion blender to puree it. Lastly, I tossed in the chicken and let it stand for a moment to bring the chicken back up to temperature.
I ate it with a spoonful of sour cream and a few tortilla chips; it was fantastic!  The soup was a bit spicy and had a sour/tangy flavor. I will be making it again.

Though a little bit involved, this soup is absolutely amazing and my favorite soup to make during the cold winter season. I do recommend using a few extra tomatillos so that the soup is thicker and if you like spicy, then some extra seasoning is needed as well (depends on the jalepenos). I also recommend adding extra garlic and some cumin. The most important part of this recipe is the pureeing so don't skip it! extra cilantro is also a nice addition and very necessary for me.

Excellent recipe.  I've made it twice, both times with fresh tomatillos and cilantro from the garden.  First time followed recipe exactly and found it a little too spicy hot.  Second time served for eight friends, only used the chopped jalepenos and black pepper.  Passed a bowl of chopped jalepenos & jar of hot sauce for those who wanted a little more heat.  Next time going to try with pork and black beans.  Expect this to be a frequent soup on our table. I served with a light leaf salad with lots of avacado & cilantro - really a nice pairing with the soup.

I LOVE this soup.  It was very easy to make and it was even better made with fresh tomatillos from my garden.  I probably added more than one pound to the recipe (I did't weigh them) and I didn't add any of the spicy seasonings except for the jalapenos (also out of my garden!).  I didn't think my family would eat anything too spicy but next time I will add more fresh japs instead of cayenne or hot sauce because the japs gave it a great flavor.  thanks for the awesome soup!!

used a few dashes of chili powder instead of cayenne pepper.  Added cord tortillas cut up like noodles. No jalapeno peppers.

My alterations:
2 pounds tomatillos
2 cups chicken broth
I simmered uncovered to reduce and thicken a little.
After pureeing, I stirred in 2 ounces shredded Pepper Jack cheese while it was reheating.
Delicious! Good for something different.

We made this last fall when we had an abundant amount of tomatillo's.  It was fabulous!  My family is begging for it this fall again but this time I am going to make a huge batch and freeze so we can eat it through out winter!

This recipe was just ok.  Neither my husband or daughter liked it, so I will not be making it again.  It just tasted like chicken soup with a twang.

Very disappointing recipe when made as written.  Needed major adjustments after pureed in food processor.  I added to taste: lots more pepper sauce than recipe called for, cumin, chili powder and salt and pepper.  If you like Tex-Mex flavor, beware...you won't get it if you follow the recipe.

This soup was delicious!  I had a bumper crop of tomatillos this year and this was one of the recipes that used up a significant amount.  I made only one change to the recipe.  I added one cup of rice at the end and cooked it in the broth.  I didn't need to add more stock, because my family likes thick soup!  Thank you for the recipe!

Very delicious and flavorful soup, even though I changed/adjusted some of its ingridients to my taste. Following other suggestions used more than the indicated amount of tomatillos and less chicken stock. Tasted the soup before adding some cumin, etc.

Very easy, and soooo flavorful! I eliminated the jalepenos, and added a little extra hot sauce. The spiciness was perfect.

Wonderful soup to serve with grilled chicken.  I like to add an extra jalapeno rather than the hot sauce to make it spicier, but it is good the way the recipe is written.  Great use for tomatillos.

Tried this recipe because I had a tomatillo based Tortilla Soup in Mexico.  It turned out just the same as the Mexican version.  I used pork instead of chicken and a little more of the tomatillo.  Serve with cubed queso fresco, queso oxacca, and powdered cotija (my favorite mexican cheeses) on the side.  Also mexican cream (slightly soured cream), chopped green onions, and tortilla chips.  Everyone loves to add their own stuff to the soup and there is never any left.  People love it.

Each summer I grow tomatillo's.  I have made this soup many times and it just gets better each time. I do use fresh cilantro,fresh lime juice and a hot cayenne pepper from the garden instead of the hot sauce.

I did not want to give this recipe a rating because I do not think it is fair but I was forced. I think maybe it is my personal taste and not the actual recipe itself. I hated this soup. The man who eats everything in this house (and I mean everything!) took two tastes and refused another bite. I followed the recipe to a tee. The only thing I did different was strain the soup off so that it was nothing but the broth. The whole thing tasted like I dumped a bottle of vinegar in it. I realize tomatillos are tangy but ughhh. I do think it might be us and our tastes more than the recipe. Whoever tries this, I strongly recommend making it before trying it on company and when you do make it, make it without being concerned if you have to throw it out.

I added just enough broth to cover all the tomatillos and before I pureed, I strained most of the broth out. I used leek instead of onion (milder) and omitted the peppers. I added lime and cumin like many others as well as a dash of cayenne. I didn't have any cilantro but I think it's fine w/o.  yummy!!!

Delicious! It's like eating enchiladas verdes without the enchilada-making hassle.  We topped it with crushed tortilla chips for added texture; can add lime juice for a little extra tang, if you like that.  Great use of an abundance of garden tomatillos. Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow, I made this recipe last night for dinner, after being given a bunch of fresh tomatillos and chili peppers from my mother-in-law's garden. It was great, much better than expected, and even my small children ate it, and liked it, admittedly with plenty of sour cream. Definitely a recipe I'll make again when I get more tomatillos!

Oh, how I love this soup!!  I agree with the last reviewer, it IS sort of a hot and sour flavor.  I normally don't care for soups in general but this soup is so tasty, so easy to make, I don't mind hauling out the blender to make it.
Also, its kinda fun picking out tomatillos in the supermarket, makes me feel so, gourmet!  Last time I made it I jazzed it up a bit with some orzo pasta. Made it a heartier, main dish. Excellent way to use up my roast chicken leftovers.
thanks for sharing it!, Ms Holly!

This recipe gets major raves every time I make it. My friends eyes light up when I tell them I'm getting ready to make some more Tomatillo soup! It does take over an hour to make, but the results are so worth it, even to a non-cook like myself.

Thanks, Holly!

First time having tomatillos. I loved them! As others suggested, I used more tomatillos. I cut the recipe down to 4 servings and used only 1 jalapeno with most seeds removed and did not add any other spicey ingredients. It was still a little bit bitey for my delicate eaters. Also I recommend using an immersion blender rather than scooping and moving veggies around to blend up. Served with a Caesar salad and chips and fresh guacamole. Yum!

I think the soup turned out beautifully but it isn't a soup that I appreciate the flavor of.  Added a potato, cumin and reduced broth to 3 cups per others' recommendations.

My husband made this tonight - this was the first soup he ever made and it was delicious. If you like hear, add the cayenne and pepper sauce. We didn’t because my son doesn’t like it that hot. We skipped the sour cream and topped this with crushed chips, avocado, tomato, and cheddar cheese.

I made it the first time as the recipe says.  Good but as others have said, no body.  As I was putting it in the frig, I dropped a container on the glass lid and had to throw it away. So I made it again, added the black beans and corn and also some Trader Joe spicy rice that was a leftover. Excellent.  I grew my own tomatillos so have to make somewith them.  I love this recipe with the adds.  Served with cornbread.

LOVED IT! Followed the recipe exactly, added some green habeñero hot sauce (jardenes brand..my fav) also added sliced avocados on top right before serving. It was nice finding this recipe since I love tomatillos.This was AMAZING, thank you for sharing, we will be doing this again VERY soon!

Have made this numerous times over the last few years.  It's about the only reason to grow tomatillos.  I always freeze a bunch and have this all year round.  I follow the ingredients exactly, except that I now get a deli roast chicken and add chicken at the end..  The only thing I do differently is put it all in a blender then put it in a pot to cook.  We like it smooth.  I do sometimes add rice the last 45 minutes of cooking to help it go farther and because the family likes it that way.  Thank you for such a great recipe.

I added extra tomatillo as suggested and 3 small chicken breasts. I cooked it all in slow cooker (minus the oil). when done, removed chicken breasts and chopped them. used immersion blender in the pot. then added back chicken and about 2 cups of fresh corn. honestly, the corn adds a wonderful sweetness that would make it a 5 star if included in original recipe. definitely don't forget the sour cream!

I needed to use up my tomatillos and some pork carnitas so I substituted the pork for the chicken and added some cumin. It was wonderful.

This was great. Only change I made was adding a diced potato to thicken up the broth and it came out perfect. Great comfort meal as the weather starts cooling down.

I'm rating this based on the additions that I made.  I liked the recipe idea because I love tomatillos but when I read the ingredients, it didn't seem flavorful enough (plus other reviewers comments that it lacked substance and flavor).  I added 2 cans of diced tomatos and chilis, a yellow pepper and cooked brown rice.  I also used hot Mexican chili power and chipotle chili powder.  I pureed about half of the tomatillos which I think brought out even more tomatillo flavor.  Yum!

Fantastic soup! My family devoured it. I made this during a severe thunderstorm so I had to make a few adjustments based on what I had avaiable and personal preference. First, I increased the recipe by 50% (bought 1.5 lbs of tomotillos). I used the recommended amount of hot sauce (I don't like spicy food) and left out the cyanne and jalapons. I also used precooked rotissiory chicken which I shredded,  added egg noodles cooked seperatly for more body, and added lime juice at the end as recommended by other reviewers. I was almost worried about a fight breaking out for the last bowl! It's extremely easy to make and while great as written, can easily be added to as noted in the reviews. I'll definitly be making this again.

It was edible.  Tomatillo flavor is very mild - the spice overpowered any other flavors.

It is so important to make use of the comments for this recipe. The base is fine, but it needs so much more to be spectacular. And it is if you add in all the extra. It took me a second trip to the grocery store since I hadn't read the comments the first time around but it was worth it. I added cumin and garlic salt to the broth. I only pureed 75 percent of the broth to keep it thicker. Adding in corn and black beans and fresh tomatoes made a huge difference in color, flavor and texture. I added in extra broth at the very very end to be sure it didn't become too thin. I served with sliced avocado, shredded cheese, lime wedges, and grilled tortilla strips. And it was then five stars. So delish.

This is my new favorite. I've made this 3 times, in as many weeks!
Super easy for lunches!

I also add:
Stewed/diced tomatoes after blending the onion and tomatillo - usually the 28 oz can (I love tomatoes)
For convenience, I buy the pre-marinated taco chicken meat at Northgate Market (So Cali) - adds a little more flavor and "bulk".
I also add some chili powder and paprika - not too much though, I don't want it to taste like chili.

It's a delicious way to use a lot of tomatillos. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs for extra flavor & added ro-tel, corn, & black beans. I also used the crockpot. Once everything was cooked, I used a hand mixer to shred the chicken & veggies in the pot. I topped with Mexican crema' & quesadilla cheese. Next time, I'm searing pork & using it instead of chicken just to see. :)

I consider this a good base for a soup, but some ideas to improve.  Jazz it up using home made broth. Rub the jalapeno and thickly sliced tomatillos with oil, grill for a few minutes hot, using wood chips to smoke (adds flavor), removing skin and seeds of jalapeno afterwards, add 1 goya ancho chile with sauce (they come in a can), skip the hot sauce.  Once all is blended as recipe indicates and returned to pot, add 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp. chile powder. Add 1c brown rice, simmer till almost done.  sprinke Wondra while stirring to thicken broth. Then add 1c frozen corn, 1 can black beans drained, chopped chicken meat, juice of 1/2 lime.  when corn is close to done, add chopped zuccini, 1/2 cup chopped scallion, turn off heat and cover.  stir in 10, serve in another 10. Garnish with more cilantro, lime wedge, scallion, avocado, tortilla chips, etc.

This was a very good soup, easy to make and delicious. Great for cold weather too! I used an extra 1/4 pound of tomatillos because I did not know what else to do with them, and I added some corn.  The puréed tomatllos thickened the broth nicely. Served with cornbread.

I made this recipe in the crock pot as suggested by Erin (put everything in the crock pot and cooked on low for 6 hours).  After blending everything but the chicken (which I shredded), I put all the ingredients back in the crock pot and added a can of corn and pinto beans and heated for another 30 min ~ we served it with chips and fresh avocado.  It was a hit.

Turned out good but thin as others said. I added a Masa Harina paste (1/2 cup Masa Harina mixed with 1/2 cup water) that thickened it up, and also added two ears' worth of grilled corn, and was very happy with the result!

I have never eaten a tomatillo, so this may be because of that...but this was not very tasty to me at all.

I added rice and ommitted the cayenne to tone it down for my toddler.  It was perfect.  We all loved it.

I loved this recipe.  My friend made it for me and added a can of black beans and roasted corn.  I made it at home.  It's easy but takes some time.  The broth is medium thickness and very very yummy!  A must have!

I liked it, but it is not for everyone as it is quite acidic.

I had never tried tomatillos before but a friend gave us a bunch from her garden.  I had very low expecations while cooking - and they were utterly blown away.  The soup was WONDERFUL!  Followed recipe as written - I did add the can of black beans.  It got raves from my husband (and me of course) and from the friend who gave us the tomatillos.  Thanks so much!

This soup is top-notch! Easy to make and tasty. I made a few alterations according to ingredients I had on hand. But will definitely make it again!

I had high hopes for this soup but we were a little disappointed with it.  Sorry.  Not bad but doubt I will make it again.

My husband and I though this soup was very good and my husband usually does not like soup.  We love tomatillo's and this is a great recipe to use them in!  The sour cream is a must.

I love this soup!  It's kind of like a hot and sour soup.  The cilatro and sour cream is a perfect addition.
