This was an unexpected translation of a Russian favorite. It was great!

I followed the recipe I believe accurately. There are a lot of ways to screw this up so I could have screwed it up. My end product had a good flavor, I think i would have liked a little more rum flavor but I don't know if that would change the baking.  The reason I give this only 3 stars is because the texture is too chewy and dense. I would make this again just to see if i could get it less dense and chewy.
