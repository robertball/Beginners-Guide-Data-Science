It’s fantastic! It’s good enough to eat by the spoonful, too. I only had half a container of Cool Whip so I added 1/2 c. sour cream and 2 Tbsp. Powdered sugar to make up for it. I decided I’d add a little bit more of the spices and did 1tsp. apple pie spice, 1/4 tsp. each of ground cloves, ground ginger, and ground nutmeg. (I didn’t have pumpkin pie spice on hand, so I used apple pie spice in its place). Great recipe, and everyone loves it. Set out with ginger cookies, graham crackers or graham sticks, and best of all is to eat with apple wedges! I soaked the apple wedges in a mix of 2 tsp. citric acid (or use juice of one lemon) and 6 c. water for 5 min, drain and pat dry with paper towel to keep them from browning.

Yummy.  Even my husband who is not a huge pumpkin flavor fan liked it.  My daughter reluctantly tried it, and wanted more!  Would recommend making!  I used pumpkin puree I made myself from a real pumpkin!

I was looking for something to make as an appetizer for thanksgiving that my mom would like; she has quite the sweet tooth.  I did a test run with this one today and I think it will do the trick for her.  It makes a lot, so I washed and refilled the whipped topping container with the finished dip and put it in the freezer.  I’m giving the rest to the neighbors, ha!  Thanks for sharing!

This is a very nice dip for Autumn.  My kids loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly and rated accordingly.  I feel,like another reviewer, that there is too much whipped topping.  Maybe half would really keep that pumpkin flavor and a more creamy texture, verses fluffy.  Just my preference.  It tastes great, not too sweet.

Love that it’s not super sweet. You MUST try it with Anna’s Ginger Thins - life changing! LOL It was the first dessert to disappear at the office potluck. Will absolutely make again for fall gatherings.

I will definitely make this again. Great for Halloween parties and thanksgiving. Gives a great autumn vibe. Delicious with graham crackers. The only alteration i made was left the cream cheese be more chunky, as to allow different tastes in the dip.

Made the recipe with no alterations. I made sure to soften the cream cheese and mix thoroughly with the pumpkin. This dip was the hit of our pot luck! Everyone wanted to know what was in it.

I made this recipe exactly except for the spice. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so made do with cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg separately. It turned out wonderfully - very delicious and perfect for the fall season. We've been snacking on it with graham crackers, gingersnaps, and sliced apples. This would be a delightful dip to serve at gatherings.
