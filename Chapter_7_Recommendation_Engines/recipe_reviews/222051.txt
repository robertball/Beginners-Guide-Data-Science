This is so delicious.  I didn't have sausage so I used ground beef.  The only things I added were a little salt and pepper and black beans, garlic powder and onion powder.  I did not use onions or peppers, or my kids would not eat it.   Also to make it kid-friendly, I liquified in my Vitamix the Rotel tomatoes with green chilis along with can of Campbell's French onion soup (used this instead of  the condensed beef broth).  Delicious--definitely will make again!

Made this for a family gathering and I went back for seconds and was robbed. I did use the Rotel Diced Tomatoes with Habanero just because I like things a bit more spicy, it was fine though.

I used Spanish quinoa instead of rice and added black beans and fresh cilantro. My family loved the soup, hardly any left! this recipe is a keeper!

This is a easy fun recipe and can be changed up with ingredients you like. I didn't add as much green pepper and cream cheese and use Italian sausage to spice it up some.

This was an AWESOME recipe. I cook for church food ministry and this was loved by all who tried it while it was cooking in the kitchen!!!  Even loved by one who is not a soup lover like me.  
Great job Marcia.

I made this a few nights back using my crockpot. It didn't turn out well at all. I think it tasted more like a cheese dip then a soup. I wouldn't make it again.

Made it for a rainy day soup, added mushrooms, ground beef and yellow and red peppers. Was a huge hit, will definitely be making this again!!

I didn't have green pepper, so left it out. Otherwise, we liked it.

This was WONDERFUL.  I made it with spicy CHICKEN sausage.  Less greasy/fatty.  Will make this again and again.
