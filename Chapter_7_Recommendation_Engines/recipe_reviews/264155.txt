I liked the recipe alot....though I tweaked it a bit. I used a mango smoothy blend for the marinade and sause. I flattened the chicken to uniform thickness and  marinated it for 24 + hours in a vaccum sealed container.  For the second half of the marinade added a few Tbsp of coconut milk. We then made coconut quinoa instead of the rice.  For the corn salsa I used yellow, orange, and red sweet peppers. I did not have a red onion so we used a quarter cup of a finely chopped yellow sweet onion. I also doubled the marinade so I would have more to pour on top of the completed dish.

Really good for dinner! Left out coconut, and substituted diced& peeled tomato for the pepper. The mango sauce is great,especially after it had "mellowed" for a couple of days. (I made that a day ahead of time to "test" it with shrimp.)I had no chicken - but the sauteed shrimp filled in beautifully!
This is a keeper!

It was really good, I made it as a normal meal for the family and it turned out great. I will definitely try again as a meal prep as it definitely exceeded expectations

this was simply amazing, I left the coconut and red bell pepper out because I didn't have any. I'll definitely make this again. The only thing I changed I used 2 Mangos which gave me a little bit more of the amazing sauce.

This was very tasty. Lots of flavors and freshness. The only thing that wasn’t as great was our chicken tenders. They got a little chewy from the grill, but otherwise a hit!

I made this exactly as directed and the first bite I took I thought to myself, HOLY COW. It is AMAZING! I have made it every week since finding this recipe and give it to all my friends for them to try as well.

Did not add the red onion because I was out at the time. Enjoyed this bowl tremendously. I will add a bit more lime juice and onion nest time around. (First time for this rice, smelled like popcorn cooking, yum!)

This was so delicious. I tweeked the rice a bit, I added some coconut to the rice and it gave it the extra kick I wanted. I also substituted sweet peppers for the bell pepper.

I left out the coconut because I didn't have any. Other than that, I made it exactly as described. My family loved it! I will definitely make this again...with coconut.

I used frozen mango, frozen pepper/onion blend and leftover grilled corn on the cob because that was all I had. Even my toddler liked it. We ate this two days after making.

Made as written for the mango sauce except I doubled the recipe for 3 LBS of chicken tenders. I marinaded for 7 hours. Although excellent, next time, I will sub. vegetable or canola oil for the olive oil as I could taste the olive oil and I think a neutral flavored oil would be better. Also, I feel any type of hot sauce will work for the sriracha. I didn't use red peppers for the corn salsa, I used halved cherry tomatoes. Although good, I think some additional seasoning would benefit the flavor. I boiled corn  on the cob for 3 mins. then cut off to use for the salsa. Canned corn would work too. Not sure if recipe wanted fresh, uncooked corn??? The coconut was neither here nor there, so definitely optional. Overall, as written an excellent recipe that can be tailored to your taste. I did not make this as meal prep, we ate it as a full dinner.

This is a great dish! Thanks for posting it:). I left out the corn and used 1 red pepper in place. Also used 3 small yellow mango that were quite firm and tart, probably a bit lucky there as they made this dish have  a bite I wasn’t expecting. Will add this to a regular rotation since it’s very tasty!

This was quite tasty. I liked the flavor combinations. I will say that the chicken didn’t really take on the flavor of the marinade and the smokiness of grilling the meat overpowered it. Next time I may just marinate the meat overnight. Overall it was very good and I will make it again.

We loved this recipe. I made it a bit on the hot side, next time I may add less curry paste but the flavours were amazing!
