I loved this recipe.  Unfortunately, I didn't have raisins and I didn't have almonds.  I substituted craisins for the raisins and skipped the almonds.  I used frozen pearl onions instead of fresh.  Still wonderful and tasty.  Elegant sidedish to a meat (we had turkey).  I will definitely make this again.

I've been making this recipe for many years.  It's a tradition at Thanksgiving-- my husband's favorite side dish.  The sherry and almonds really add a lot to the taste, so I recommend leaving this recipe alone.  It's fabulous.

Everyone loved this recipe. It took a while to make for a side dish but I used it for a potluck where it was the only thing I had to bring.  Since it was a Christmas dinner I subbed craisins for the raisins but used the almonds.  Delish!

So good!  I subbed cognac for sherry, omitted the almonds, and had to use dried thyme, but this was still delicious.

These were delicious! I did have to modify a bit because I didn't have any raisins so I used dried cranberries. I know I have slivered almonds buried somewhere in the blackhole AKA my freezer but alas I could not find. With those changes it was stil wonderful and so easy to make. This will be on my Thanksgiving table this fall for sure. Thank for sharing Christine L !

I made this unusual recipe for a book club pot luck dinner. We read Tulipomania about the Dutch tulip craze of the 1600s and how some people mistakenly ate valuable tulip bulbs thinking they were onions.  It was a PERFECT recipe to this event and was a hit. I sprinkled some dried parsley and snipped chives on top for a bit of color, and I added a 1/2 t of garlic powder. Maybe next time will add a clove of minced garlic at the start of the simmering.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was awesome!  The smell of the onions cooking had everyone's stomachs growling and I had to fight everyone off with my wooden spoon!

My boyfriend's favorite! We had it as accompaniment to some roasted chicken and rice, and it was so good. I didn't have cherry, and used apple cider vinegar, and it was so good. Very easy to make too!

I made the recipe as written.  It has BOLD flavor that I wasn't prepared for!  I really enjoyed the dish, and so did my husband.  But, as the submitter states, this is definitely more of a relish than a side dish that you eat a pile of.  I think the slivered toasted almonds are the icing on the cake, so don't skip those.  I served these with meatloaf topped with a sweet tomato sauce, and that was a terrible decision.  They do not go well at all with tomato or anything else that is sweet.  Next time, I will definitely be serving these alongside pork chops or ham.  And I might consider subbing half of the sherry wine with beef broth, just to tone down the boldness a little bit.  But overall, what a unique dish.  Never had anything like it, and it was enjoyed very much by us.

I used frozen pearl onions with this dish and couldn't get them to dry out enough to get the caramelization mentioned even with almost double the time, and most certainly didn't need to add any liquid.  It was still good, but  not sure it was as good as it could have been with fresh onions.

This recipe with no changes-oops-yes I always use golden raisins- is simple and delicious. The caramelized onion and the wine flavor make a good relish for baked chicken.

Amazingly delicious! I made this for an extra side dish on Thanksgiving and WOW-what a hit! I will be creating your recipe again and again! Thanks so much for sharing. (this is the first time I ever reviewed a recipe but thought this was worth the effort)
