It was ok, but we've made better just by putting a little of this & that together. Not much for flavor & certainly didn't taste like a teriyaki sauce for us. Won't be making again. It was easy to make & didn't take much time.

I liked this recipe except for the vinegar.  If I make it again I'll cut the vinegar in half.  Just a little too tart for my tastes.

Tastes great with a few modifications. I recommend adding toasted sesame seeds per the main photo. I also added scallions for authenticity.

A lot of the comments mentioned that the teriyaki is so-so. I added 4 tsp of brown sugar and it came out perfect.

Love this healthier version of Teriyaki chicken.  The ginger really does add to this dish.

I just wasn't that I'm pressed. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't fantastic either. I followed the recipe to a tee and can't really complain about anything. Just not for me. Doubt I'll make it again

Great dinner. Added brown sugar to mixture to sweeten it up and decrease soy flavor slightly. Also used caned mushrooms. Delicious

Easy and tasty. I will cut back on the vinegar next time, perhaps add scallions.

I found the chicken to be a bit dry, but the sauce was terrific. I would definitely serve it with rice the next time.
