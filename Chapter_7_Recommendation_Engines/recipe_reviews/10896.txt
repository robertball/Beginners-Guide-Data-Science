This recipe lacked a few specifications so just for information I used 'melted' butter and a 9 'by 13' inch pan which I greased and floured. (None of these things were specified in the recipe).I came out with 20 good squares. Very cookie-like but a bit thicker and very moist because of the pudding. Not too sweet but if you really like sweetness you can do the chocolate frosting. (I didn't). Just sharing for others who don't know what to expect from reading the recipe. It turned out very tasty!

I used two boxes of sugar-free pudding mix and 1/4 cups chocolate chips and 1/4 butterscotch chips. Awesome.

Did not turn out very well. It was very dry.

This recipe was horrible! It tastes like butter and flour desperately needing sugar. I was diasappointed to waste all the ingredients!
