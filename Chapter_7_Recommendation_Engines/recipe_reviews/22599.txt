Great basic recipe. I added portobella's so had to increase the amount of butter - other than that no changes. Thanks!

Pretty good. As the recipe is it was a good fit for my kids. For me it was on the bland side. I love lemon so I added extra lemon and pepper to my portion.

Good base recipe but it never seems to turn out quite how I want it to. I will keep trying to adjust the garlic/butter/oil/onion quantities to perfect it though. Add a little chicken for protein to make it into a good main dish.

This was really good. I cut the amount of butter in half and it was still really hard to eat because it was so slippery. Next time I may try using a different shaped pasta.
