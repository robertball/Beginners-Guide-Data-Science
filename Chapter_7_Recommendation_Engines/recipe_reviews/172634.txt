Delicious & ultra easy! Blenderizing the  (Ghirardelli 70% Cacao) chocolate speckled tiny bits of chocolate throughout, which melt in the mouth. I think that combining maple syrup & vanilla with the classic pairing of chocolate & creme fraiche produces an exquisite flavor ~ everyone loved it. I didn't have enough creme fraiche, so I made this using 1/2 creme fraiche & 1/2 low-fat milk. This still made the ice cream rich & delightful, & with enough fat content that the ice cream was easily scooped immediately upon removal from the freezer (i.e., it wasn't rock hard). We all thought that IF I were to change this recipe, adding coconut would be a good addition. Highly recommended!

I love creme fraiche so I was expecting to really enjoy this recipe, but unfortunately the flavor was too strong for me.  It was too sour for an ice cream.  But it didn't help that I don't have an Ice cream machine (never the less, the flavor wasn't right).

Fantastic! I altered the ingredients somewhat.  I used homemade creme fraiche, which was quite liquid. I also used whole milk instead of a lighter version and doubled the chocoloate because I have a chocolate addiction. Thank you for the recipe.
