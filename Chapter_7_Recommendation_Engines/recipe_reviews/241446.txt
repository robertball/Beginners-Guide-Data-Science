Great recipe. Very healthy granola bar. Everyone loved it. By accident, I let the honey mixture come to a boil, which results in a crunchy granola bar - which my husband quite liked. So depending on whether you want chewy or crunchy, you can modify as you like.

I really wanted something chocolate but wanted a healthier alternative, so I gave this recipe a try. This granola recipe was pretty good. I modified to my own taste by omitting the brown sugar and adding an extra cup of oats without increasing liquid portion of recipe to produce granola clusters (for cereal or yogurt) vs. granola bars. I also threw in a few handfuls of fresh cranberries and they added a nice tartness into the light sweetness of the rest of the granola. Thanks for a great recipe!

I love homemade granola bars. And these were wonderful!  Loved that they were "lighter" than some others. And the choc/coconut combo was great!  Thanks so much for sharing!
