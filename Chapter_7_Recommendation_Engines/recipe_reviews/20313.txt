I made the dip but everyone felt it was too salty.  Made a second batch with no salt, no sugar and just the yogurt, mint and a squeeze of lime juice and it was perfect for our tastes !

WAY TOO MUCH SALT. TERRIBLE! I would say - do not add salt or sugar, and add some lemon or lime juice.

Ugh!!! I wish I had read the reviews first before making this. Yes, WAY TOO SALTY!!!. As directed, it is inedible. I would like to make it without the salt, but I already used all my yogurt!  internet recipes. Oh well. I give it 2 stars because it clearly has potential.

Definitely too sweet/salty. I plan to try this again w/ less of both, b/c it is easy enough to make with ingredients that I usually always have in the house and I think that there is potential here. Thanks for sharing. :)
