We loved it plain on tortilla chips, or used as Nachos topping along with sour cream, etc.  It is quick, easy, and great.  I adjusted the hot pepper level to our family's taste.

This was a little too sweet for our tastes.  That said, it was still a thousand times better than any purchased salsa I have ever tasted.  (And we are in Texas, so we have TUBS to choose from).  I also added a large amount of ready to use minced garlic.  Next time, I'm going to drain the stewed tomatoes and cut back on the sugar.  A dash of lime juice might be nice also.  I did use extra fine sugar so that it would disolve quickly.  It made a huge amount for a small price from ingredients I keep in the pantry.  I  also suspect that this is how Mexican restaurants churn out gallons of salsa every day.  It was that good!  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe.  No more canned salsa for us!!

Meh, this salsa wasn't particularly flavorful at first bite, so I added lime juice, a shake of salt & pepper, some cilantro and a minced garlic clove. A little better, but even so, the celery dominated. Way too much celery! I'm glad that I halved this recipe b/c it yielded a ton! (Btw, 1/2 recipe filled 2 Naturally Fresh salad dressing jars.) If I were to make this recipe again, I would drastically scale back the celery and add way more seasoning, but more than likely, I will be trying a different recipe out instead. Thanks anyhow!

I didn't like the celery in the salsa at all. I though it over powered the dish and 2 cups is way too much. Sorry, I wouldn't recommend this or make again.

made as written but i did add a little lime juice to it and drained the tomatoes. this was easy to make and was good combined with ranch as an extra topping for taco salads normally topped with honey french. thanks!
