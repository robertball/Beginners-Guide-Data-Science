I don't use raisins in this recipe but otherwise these are a great cookie. You have to use the cornflakes though they make the cookie!

If you like a cake type cookie this recipe is ok. I prefer something a little more chewy.

I used chopped dates instead of raisins and it made the cookie sweeter. Nice option for holiday cookies the cherries add nice color to a tin of cookies.

I was delighted to find this recipe! My Grandma who passed away 4 years ago always made these. The recipe has been misplaced since she passed and I couldn't find it anywhere. These cookies tend to be a bit dry but overall they have a nice twist of crunch & chewy with the combination of cornflakes and fruits. I like to add a handful of candied fruits to them (besides the cherries the recipe calls for) to help them not be quite so dry.

It was perfect n crunchy with just cornflakes only. I reduce the sugar to 150gm n increase the crush cornflakes to 100g & skip the milk.
