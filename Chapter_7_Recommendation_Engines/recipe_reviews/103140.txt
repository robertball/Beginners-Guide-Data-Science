This is a wonderful stew.  I have made it with all kinds of seafood mixes and it always turns out delicious.  I usually use clam juice instead of fish stock as I don't have the fish stock readily available.  I have also tried it on occasion without the coconot milk; it is not traditional but it gives it a lighter, almost Mexican flavor and is quite good as well.

I adjusted this recipe just slightly for my husband's taste.  He doesn't like spicy at all so I couldnt really use any peppers.  I altered the recipe with 1 1/2 tsp of dried red pepper instead...so it provided the needed heat but not the major intensity.  I also used Talapia as my fish, and as we are Muslim we always use halal products as well so I used a halal fish stock cubes for my broth.  For the coconut milk, I used the coconut WATER instead!  We had recently opened a coconut & i had saved the water in an ice cube tray for use in curries in lieu of milk-- So we ended up with this really nice tropical style dish with a slight hint of the coconut & peppers--none of it too overwhelming--all of the flavors blended SO well!!!! and yet it was very much unlike anything he had eaten in the past!  He really enjoyed this & has requested I prepare this again in the future!

I made minor changes but the recipe stayed basically the same.  I used crab stock by boiling the left over crab shells from a King Crab Dinner.  I also added scallops and mussels and used 4 times as much stock to make the dish soupier.  I also used 1.5 times as much coconut mild and a little hot currey paste.

I followed recipe exactly except couldn't find fish stock so I just used water instead and the tomatoes aren't in season so I substituted with a can of diced tomatoes.  It was delicious.  The flavors blended perfectly...not too much spice...not too little.  I would make this again.

This is a really easy to follow version of the Brazilian stew. I highly recommend using the dende (palm) oil, it gives the stew a wonderful flavor you won't have with another oil. It is that flavor that makes this stew something different from any other seafood stew. I serve it with coconut milk rice and cilantro....very tasty!

I made this as part of my family Easter Sunday Lunch.  I didn't have an Dende Oil, and I spiced it WAY down so my kids could partake of the meal.  It was so tasty and so flavourful that almost everyone (including my kids) had seconds, AND they ate it alone, almost like a soup/broth.  I will definitely make this again and again!

Not impressed at all! I followed this recipe pretty close and it seriously lacked flavor. The only thing I did differently was used clam juice instead of the fish stock as I could not find it. As I was cooking this dish I just knew it was going to be a hit. It looked good and smelled great. But was a big disappointment. I will not be making his again.

I will definitely make again. Next time with a bit more spice, something other than Tabasco.

Wow! We loved it. I used clam sauce, mussels and tilapia. It's really important to cut the fish into large chunks so they don't fall apart when turning in the pot. It makes a large amount, and would be an easy hosting dish. So full of flavor and so healthy!

I really loved this recipe but did make some adaptations based on previous suggestions and my own taste/availability. I used catfish, shrimp, and clams. I also tripled the liquid. I didn't have fish stock so I used clam juice from the canned clams for half of the liquid and  water for the other half. Of course I increased Tabasco because of the added liquid. I also seasoned a bit more with curry powder (I scaled the recipe to 1 and used 1/2 tsp. so I assume 2 tsp. for full recipe). I also didn't have green onions but substituted with chives. I will definitely make this again!

This is a great recipe - delicious and versatile. I adjusted the serving size to make more servings than people, and was glad I did as it was all eaten. Rather than shrimp and white fish, I used salmon pieces and baby octopus.

This is absolutely delicious! It's one of our favorites. I do make a little more broth sometimes if I want to add rice. I'll make Jasmine rice separately, then add a couple tbps full to each bowl.

This recipe got rave reviews by our guests.  I did make several changes, though, only because I was trying to use what I had on hand.  I had no tomatoes but had a carton of organic cream of tomato soup.  No cilantro but had fresh italian parsley, no shrimp or fish stock but used shrimp boullion instead.  Added green curry paste instead of the peppers.  This is a recipe that leaves a lot of leeway for making changes. More tomato/coconut milk are wonderful as it gives a little extra to put over brown rice!

I make this for special guests.  I skip the white fish and use only shrimp, scallops, and lump crab meat. If you add more coconut milk than recommended, you need to add more salt. We usually steam brown rice on the side and pour the stew on the rice.  Pairs well with sliced mangoes.

Kind of pricey for a somewhat bland meal.
