I didn't have orange marmalade or limes so I used slightly less than 1/4 cup of orange juice with about a tablespoon of honey instead and left out the lime slices. I also took a previous reviewer's suggestion and left out the corn starch and did a reduction instead. It worked out really well and was very yummy.

This glaze rocks ! I've made it several times recently, only changes I've done is use sliced oranges on top of meat instead of limes. And as others who have suggested - this is great on thick cut pork loin (boneless chops) and yes - chicken breasts. I suggest not skipping any ingredient, once you have them at home - this recipe uses such small amounts, you can make it many times.

This recipe was absolutely fabulous.  I followed the recipe except I omitted the ginger (didn't have any).  I would highly recommend using bone-in thick cut chops.  The flavor was so tasty.  My boyfriend loved it and said it was the best pork he had eaten.  

As a note, next time the only thing I will do differently is omit the cut lime from the top as I didnt think it needed it (and Im on a budget!) 

Highly recommended!!!

My room mate made this for us and it was great. He added a side of lemon noodles (spaghetti noodles, olive oil, lemon juice, red peppers, sun dried tomatoes, parmesian) with a little bit of extra glaze drizzled over it.  The side complimented the pork perfectly.

Very, very good! It doesn't have a prevalent "limey" taste so if you're not a big fan don't be afraid of this recipe. I seasoned my chops (I used boneless) w/ Paula Deen's house seasoning (salt, pepper, garlic powder),  & I seared them over med-high heat in a tbp or so of EVOO. Coated them w/ the glaze (adding the drippings in the pan) & baked them right in the skillet I seared them in (it has a heat-proof handle). I covered it w/ foil for the first 30 minutes & uncovered them for teh last 10. I just bought some lime marmalade...I'm eager to try this recipe again using lime marmalade & orange juice & slices. I served it w/ pinot grigio, a salad w/ vidalia onion vinaigrette & Garlic Asparagus w/ Lime (from thsi site) w/ Creamy Lime Sherbet & a brownie for dessert.

I made this with apricot preserves because I didn't have orange. It was great. Super easy and very tasty. Next time, I will add some red pepper to give it a little more zing.

Tasty! Added an extra tablespoon of soy sauce & subbed orange juice for the marmalade, so I added an extra teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken sauce. As they were thick, bone-in chops, I -did- have to cook them for the entire 40 minutes, turning them once during baking.

Will keep this recipe in our rotation.  Changed it up a bit by seasoning chops and letting them sit at room temp for an hour.  Seared them in a hot pan with a bit of olive oil, then tossed them with sauce in same pan and put the whole thing in the oven - love those oven proof skillets!  Used some chopped chives sprinkled over the top of the chops before serving.

Made these pork chops on Sunday and they where a hit!  The family loved them and talked about how moist and juicy the pork chops where.  I marinated my pork chops with salt, black pepper, garlic and onion power, oregano, paprika, and thyme for about 2hours prior to placing in the oven.

I didn't have lime juice or orange marmalade, so I substituted major grey's many chutney and lemon juice.  We loved it, so the recipe is changed permanently for my family!  Also made it with a pork tenderloin... So good!!

I used lemon juice instead of lime, and it was pretty good.  My husband really liked it, I thought it was a bit salty.  I'll use less soy sauce next time -- but it was good!

i used a pork roast, seared it with the garlic and lil EVOO... removed the roast and started to make my glaze.. did not need to use any starch @ all...placed the roast back into the roasting pan. added  a 1/4 water as it was cooking in the oven, basted it every 15 minutes, cooked till juice ran clear and it was Very Moist, the whole roast was gone! Whole family loved it & they dont like anything new!

My husband doesn't eat anything, and he really liked this. I didn't have any marmalade, so I used 1/4 cup of orange pinapple juice and a tablespoon of honey. It came out so well, I plan on using it on some chicken next.

Loved the flavors (perhaps a small clove garlic. Perhaps thickening sauce a little more like a reduction rather than the cornstarch (a little less cornstarch) because sauce seemed a little pasty to me.  My husband LOVED it, I thought it was very good, AND it was easy.  Thanks very yummy meal easy to even do weekdays.  I also liked the side of the "lemon pasta" noted in another review thanks for that too.

Yum! I did change it up a bit though...I eliminated the cornstarch...trimmed the bone off the pork-chop...marinated the pork loin in half of the glaze for approximately 20 minutes...cooked on the bbq grill...when pork chops were done, covered them with remainder of glaze and served...quite yummy. Can't wait to try this with chicken.

Made as written. I'd make it again and use it on chicken too. It smelled wonderful, my husband was drooling. He even thought the lime slices were fancy:)

Best part was the glaze/sauce!! I followed the recipe...didn't need to make adjustments.  I've used the glaze to make orange chicken...and everyone loved it!! No more takeout!!
