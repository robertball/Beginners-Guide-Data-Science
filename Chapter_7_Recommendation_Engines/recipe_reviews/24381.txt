This is one of the best Ginger dressings I have ever tasted.  The only 2 things I do differently are add 2 tablespoons of rice vinegar and use a grinding bowl instead of mincing the ginger.  Grinding it makes it more pasty and juicy.

This is FANTASTIC,  and tastes like the japanese steakhouses! I added 1 T. of rice wine vinegar to cut the oil taste, and  1 t. of white pepper as a substitute for the black pepper, put all but the oil in a blender to puree, then added the  sesame oil for the olive oil and added it in a steady steam to get the same consistency of the original from the restraunts...my friends and family are raving about it and say it is better than chocolate!!!! It is a MUST try !!! Sesame oil has a better flavor and seems lighter in taste than olive oil..

Great recipe! Though at first it came out bitter for me. I didn't give up though! I added a T. of rice wine vinegar like someone suggested and it helped a lot! But I added something else--white sugar! It helped some sweetness come out of it... so I suggest some white sugar if it's too bitter for anyone. I am a huge fan of japanese restaurants and my final outcome was delicious! I ate two salad bowls full!

If I have to give this a star, it can only be 1!  It was horrible!!  I LOVE japanese restaurants and been to a few in my time and NONE of them serve a dressing that even "looks" like this one.  What a waste of good olive oil!  Hate to be so harsh, but this is NOT your typical japanese salad dressing!!  I would say, if you were going to do this, that you could follow the directions for the spice mixture, but mix it with mayo instead of olive oil.  I am half-tempted to try it that way myself, because it tasted fine before the olive oil was added.  Just a thought for those of you who like to experiment!

This ginger dressing is very good, but it isn't what I'm looking for. I would like the one that they serve on salads in restaurants like Benihanas. I wonder if it needs sugared ginger?

Tangy, flavorful and delicous. I made a marinated grilled chicken salad with the Peanut Cilantro dip on this site and this dressing. Add some fresh mango and red pepper strips and cashews. It is now one of my favorite salads.

This is a vinagarette dressing (not a mayonnaise- based dressing as you can tell if you read the ingredients). I followed some of the other reviewers suggestions and added some rice wine vinegar (1TBS) and some white vinegar (1TBS). I also added 1 TBS of white sugar. With these changes it tastes exactly like the ginger dressing served at every Japanese restaurant that I've ever visited. I made the salad with finely chopped carrots, green onions, and julienned cucumber over shredded lettuce, and served it alongside grilled steak. This was exactly what I was looking for. Thanks for a great recipe!

Did not like this dressing.  I normally love Japanese style dressings, but this one was a bit too gingery for me.  I added some Wasabi, but still didn't like it that much.
It has a lot of potential but no follow-through.

This recipe is pretty good, but I made a couple of changes.  I used 3 Tablespoons of honey and only 1 teaspoon of ginger, plus I added sesame oil to taste.  On the salad I added chow mein noodles to use as croutons.

Thanks to all the other reviewers I put together an amazing dressing. Thank you all and Paula, thank you! This is what I did: 1/2 tsp Mongolian Fire Whack Oil, 3/4 c olive oil, 1/4 c sesame oil, 1/4 c fresh lemon juice, 1/3c fresh lime juice, 1 tbsp fresh minced garlic, 2 tbsp fresh minced ginger, 1/2 c fresh minced carrot, 1 tsp Dijon mustard, 1/4 c soy sauce, 1 tbsp honey, 1 tsp sugar. It took a lot longer to prepare because of all the mincing of the carrots and ginger, but it was SO WORTH IT!!!!!! I have already added this recipe to my box of favorites. THANKS TO ALL!!!

I wasn't crazy about this dressing, and I typically love ginger dressing. I'm going to try replacing the olive oil with sesame oil, adding some rice wine vinager and cutting down on the soy sauce a bit, as previous reviewers suggested.

Way too much olive oil, and I could see that from the get-go. I reduced it to 1/2 cup and it was still a bit too much in the end. Maybe just over 1/3 is fine, leaving the rest of the measurements for the ingredients the same. I replaced the honey with 1tsp of Stevia extract / sugar. It would have been perfect if the oil just wasn't too much but it otherwise tasted like the restaurant style ginger dressing.  Thanks for the recipe!

This didn't taste at all like the dressing I eat at Japanese resturants.  Maybe it's in the olive oil.  Just seemed strong to me.

I was looking for the ginger dressing they make in sushi restaurants, and this was not it.  I really tried doctoring it up even though I am by no means a experienced cook. I used sesame oil, but felt it was entirely way to oily, so I added more ginger, honey, and mustard.  I then added some mayonaise to make it a little creamier. What i ended up with was a little too gingery, but closer.

I made this cause I wanted to try something different, and everyone loves it. My mom actually took the rest of the dressing and wouldnt give it back. The only thing I did was add more garlic, since I am a garlic freak.

I gave a small rating for the kids because neither one of my kids tried it...but my husband and I did! We are lovers of Japanese food restaurants and I've always wanted to try a recipe for the ginger dressing and I tried this one because of the previous reviews. First I want to say it was wonderful and my husband loves it as do I! I had always wanted to try to find a ginger dressing. This was the first one. It came out not as thick as the usual and I don't know why but it still tasted really great. I used ground ginger (since I already had it) instead of fresh ginger. I used the same amount of the ground as it said for the fresh. It wasn't as thick as the restaurant style. I DID use olive oil and followed the recipe otherwise. But it was more runny. Will try using fresh ginger the next time. Maybe that will increase the thickness. No matter what though...it was extremely delicious!

I made this dressing and also added rice vinegar to it but the Japanese place I go to their dressing is a little thicker than what this is.  I think I will try the sesame oil next time instead of the olive oil.  It is very good!

I thought this dressing was AWFUL. I couldn't even doctor it up and I really tried. Hated to waste good olive oil like that. Make sure you like this type of dressing before you make it. I didn't know and wanted to try something new.

I agree with other reviewer that a tablespoon of rice vinegar adds to the flavor.

I agree with the other reviews, way less olive oil.  Start out with way less Soy sauce also. If I was going to try to make this recipe again, I would  start out like I was making salad dressing for one and add more ingredients bit by bit. I over-soy sauced right out of the gait and had to throw it all away.

Oh, this was a very nice dressing! I'm not sure if it was exactly like what we have at the japanese restaurant, but it's a very good homemade version. I followed one of the reviewers and added rice wine vinegar and some granulated sugar (about 1 tbsp each). Thanks for the recipe. We'll be making this again and again.

After preparing this, I tasted first, then added a little sugar, an additional tsp of honey, and ran it thru with my immersion (stick) blender. (Wonderful little tool!)
This is a delicious salad dressing! Thank you for sharing~ Next time I will try this with orange juice and a little zest!

I have to try it with fresh ginger next time. With the ground ginger I had on hand, it didn't taste very good.

I was skeptical but it tastes a lot like restaurant ginger dressing! I had to sub some stuff out of necessity (vinegar for lemon juice, Ponzu for soy sauce) but it still turned out great! Now I'm just wondering why restaurant ginger dressing is orange? But really good for how quick and easy it was.

I made a few modifications to this:  I used half the lemon and added rice vinegar to taste instead.  I didn't bother with the pepper (though if I had I think white pepper is more traditional.)  I did use less soy sauce -- probably half as much.  And I used powdered yellow mustard and not prepared mustard.  It makes for a slightly runnier dressing, but it's nothing a little arrowroot couldn't cure if you insist on it being thick.  I used my food processor -- first the ginger and garlic, then I added about 1/4 the olive oil and let it run until the texture was very fine.  The taste came out just like the Japanese restaurant near my house.     For those of you having problems with bitterness -- if you're reduced to buying fresh ginger at a major American grocery store -- find somewhere else.  The stuff in normal grocery stores has sat around for goodness knows how long.  I buy my ginger at an Asian market and it's always very fresh.  Old ginger is tough and bitter.  A store like Whole Foods or Fresh Market would be better if you don't live in an area that has Asian markets.  For those having problems with the olive oil, I used a good quality extra virgin olive oil.  I may use cheaper olive oils for other things, but for salad dressings I don't ever skimp.  If you're using something like Bertolli's Light Olive Oil, that would make it bland and greasy.

Loved this recipe.  I did add a bit more honey than was called for in the recipe.  We used it on arugula as a side to seared Ahi... and it was perfect - the peppery arugula with the tangy and sweet of the dressing. It did not overwhelm the Ahi.  Excellent!

This is a horrible recipe. The olive oil was overwhelming...needs some vinegar to cut the oil. Overall, the taste wasn't good, and didn't taste anything like Japanese dressing.  I tried to save it by adding some other things to it, but did no prevail. I usually like oil-based dressings too.

Mmm I really enjoyed this recipe. I used a combo of sesame and olive oil, based on the reviews. I think next time I will make it a day in advance, which I wasn't able to do this time; the leftovers just get better and better! Also I would like to try grinding up the ginger rather than mincing it, to give it that pasty consistency like Benihana's. All in all a very impressive outcome for not a lot of effort, and makes even a simple salad something special. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this with a little less olive oil and added just a little sesame oil. It tasted AWESOME!!!! After 2 days it became very chunky and weird consistancy, but it still tasted very good. I thought maybe it was because of the oil I left out. I added more but it still stayed sort of "sepaerated" for lack of a better term. It is really thick and when I stir it it stays the same. I don't know why, but I still enjoy the flavor. I also added some rice vinegar to see if it would change the consistancy, but it hasn't. 

*Update* I set the dressing out of the fridge for a little bit, as a reviewer suggested to another, and it went right back to the consistancy it should be. Thanks reviewers!!! :)

Good, but I made a couple changes.  I did half seseme oil and half olive oil.  I double (or even tripled) up on the honey and mustard since the soy sauce took saltiness to the extreme.  To thicken the dressing I added 2 T of mayo and 1T of corn starch.  Before refridgerating I stuck it all in the blender to emulsify better than just whisking... YUM!

I love Japanese food and this dressing is better than I have had at my favorite restaurant!  I have to keep this in my refrigerator to use everyday.  Love it!!   I usually add a little more ginger than the recipe calls for because I love the peppery bite.

Love it, but did add a few changes per other readers. Added rice vinegar and a little sugar. I let it sit overnight. All of my guests raved about it. I had to put out more salad so they could all have seconds,eve the one person that didn't normally use dressings on her salad had more. Will make again!

was too oily for me but with a little tweaking I lowered the calories and upped the flavor.  I added 1 T of the rice wine vinegar, 1 T water, 1 extra T lemon juice and added 1 grated carrot. Oh and most importantly I used sesame oil instead of olive.

This was awful. There must be radically different dressings used in Japanese steakhouses across the country or something, because this isn't what I'm used to. Extremely oily. The ginger was overpowered by the oil and the lemon. It was inedible and wasted a lot of good olive oil.

Perhaps my expectations were too high, but this dressing was very disappointing.  It was extremely garlicy.  I love garlic & it was just too much.  It also had a heavy olive oil taste, which is certainly not a Japanese flavor.  If you're looking for a dressing similar to Benihana's or other Japanese steakhouses, this is certainly not it, keep looking.  After one serving, we did not eat any more.

This recipe works best if you follow the ingredients. I did have to change one thing I didn't have soy sauce, some how it is MIA. I ended up using Tamari witch is the same thing as soy sauce just more consternated. I recommend you to use a little less but I used the same amount as the soy sauce and it was FAB! I also add more ginger because I love the taste. This was real close to the ginger dressing at the local Japanese restaurant in my city. If you love giger you will love this dressing. 

Also in someones review they mentioned  Benihana Recipes was better I checked it out and its the same recipe. Someone had a moment I think.

I was very impressed by this recipe, we eat at a local Japenese restaurant that serves this dressing on the salad and as a dipping sauce and this tastes almost identical to it. I did add the 1 tsp of rice wine vinegar like others did and it makes it more zippy. PERFECT!!!!

Love it! Small changes: 3/4c olive oil, added 1tbsp rice  vinegar, ran out of garlic gloves so I used the equivalent in powder and let it it sit in the fridge for an hour before serving. Made a batch of this dressing and watched my boyfriend devour a huge salad.

This recipe is fantastic! I used a mixture of sesame oil and olive oil and the ginger gave a zing to the whole taste. I left out the mustard though, as I didn't have any. I will use this recipe in future instead of store bought.

This was okay.  I didn't hate it, but I expected it to be much more gingery - the oil seemed to thin it out too much for my taste.

It tasted very much like that which is served in Japanese restaurants. The only thing I would do differently is reduce the amount of oil. Otherwise, fantastic!

Fabulous recipe!  So easy and so good!  Added bonus is the versatility.  This can be used on different salads to accompany different meals...not just with steak.  Pairs beautifully with Asian style pork ribs too.  This one's a keeper!  Thanks!

Easy, simple, yummy.  I made it to go on a green salad aside Sushi Rolls.  Then I served the rest at a small dinner party last night and was asked for the recipe.  Hooray!

This was very good. I gave it 4 stars because I followed the other recommendations and added rice and apple cider vinegar and instead of sugar I added a touch more honey.

Simple.  Made it per the recipe.  Used an immersion blender.  Dressing was thick, tangy and delicious.  I will try sesame oil and some vinegar or water next time.

I LOVE this recipe, and I'd give it 10 stars if possible! The only thing I changed was the amount of olive oil from one cup to 1/4 cup, but that was just because I'm not a fan of a lot of oil. I also grated the garlic and ginger instead of mincing them, but kept the quantities. This is my new go to for salad dressing and marinade, and I will surely tell my friends and family about this great find!!

I cut recipe in half and thought it was bland and bitter and jazzed it up with a TB of tahini and Ts sugar. It made it awesome.

This dressing is really good! I did think it needed more sweetener. I added two tsp Truvia but it still wasn't sweet enough for me so I added about 2 more tsp honey. This made it perfect! I also blended the soy sauce, lemon, etc. in the blender then slowly poured in the oil while it was on med. speed. Once it was done I stirred in about two Tbsp sesame seeds. Yummy!

This recipe did not turn out for me. I'm not sure how it turned out for other folks, but it was inedible for us. We crushed up the ginger in a mortar in pestle after chopping it, but it was tough and bitter (I'm wondering if maybe a food processor/blender is the way to go). And the dressing base had way too much soy. Not what I was looking for at all.

This is NOTHING like the dressings in the restaurants. First of all, those dressings aren't oil based, so this doesn't have the right consistency. Secondly, it has WAY too much soy sauce. I tried cutting it with some sugar, but it's still all I can taste. This might be ok as a marinade, but truly awful as a salad dressing, especially if you were expecting the tangy, orange-y dressing they serve in steakhouses.

I used two teaspoons of Splenda powder instead of the Honey, and added a teaspoon of Balsamic Vinegar.  It was not the same color or consistency of the dressings at our local Japanese steakhouse, but the taste was pretty close.  Overall, a win!

Delicious! I used half olive oil, half sesame oil (like others recommended), and substituted ground ginger since I didn't have any fresh. I added the ginger last, beginning with about 1/8 t and kept adding until it tasted good. I probably used about 1/2 t altogether. I used to live in Japan. This reminds me of my time there. Thanks for sharing!

This is an acceptable dressing, but I found it rather bland for a ginger dressing.  Even after several days in the fridge, you can barely taste the ginger.  If I make this again I would double the ginger at least.

Our family loved this and I will make it over and over again. I did use some toasted sesame oil in it and it turned out fantastic. (And my hubby claims he doesn't like ginger...Loved it.)

I made it as listed/no changes. I was a little afraid to put that much ginger in it....but I did....and it did turn out OK. It is not overpowering IF you really like ginger (which I do). My issue was the olive oil. I only have virgin olive oil around and the olive flavor really came through. For me that was not a good thing....olives don't strike me as an Oriental flavor. So.....I would make this again but I would not use the olive oil/would use either peanut oil (none of us have peanut allergies here) or a lighter salad oil. OK....one small change. I did not wisk it....I used the blender. I had no trouble with this emulifying nicely or having it come out thin/oily as some posters noted. The blender probably took care of that.

After reading the modifications already posted, I remembered that Olive Oil does have a very strong taste so I used 1/2 cup Olive Oil, 1/4 cup Grapeseed oil and 1/4 Almond Oil. Instead of straight soy sauce I used something called Soyaki from Trader joe's.  This was the first time I tried this recipe and with these modifications, not only did I like it a awful lot but my picky spouse decided he liked it too.

I will give this four stars, even though this didn't come out well for me. This recipe calls for too much olive oil, but the other ingredients taste identical to the delicious Japanese steakhouse dressing. Next time I will only use 1/2- 2/3 cup olive oil.

Pretty spot on compared to the dressings served at sushi places near me.  I reduced the olive oil significantly (only used about 1/4 c.) and added 1T sesame oil.  I also omitted the honey and added 2T rice wine vinegar.  I grated the ginger and then threw everything into my blender.  It was great and I'll definitely make it again.

We made this salad dressing to use in the Miso Salmon recipe. Since we were only making 3 servings, we adjusted accordingly and made only enough for the recipe. We substituted Sesame oil for the olive oil so it would go along better with the other recipe, and followed the recipe directly. Unfortunately we needed to use it all for the recipe and had none leftover, as it was delish!! I went out to the store to get replacement ingredients so that i can make a whole batch and use it on salad! this is the ginger dressing i have been looking for.

Fabulous! I loved this salad dressing, it remminds me of my favorite japanese restaurant. I added extra ginger because I like extra spicy. I also added 1 Tbsp of rice wine vinegar as suggested by one of the reviewers.

As this recipe is written, it's slightly better then OK. Here's what I did...I combined all the ingredients in a salad dressing shaker until well blended. I sampled the mixture, and it was a little tart. So I added 1/4 C white sugar, and stirred until mixed. Still needed some more, so I added 1/8 C of sesame oil, and a splash more of soy sauce. Now it tasted better. When I added the olive oil to the shaker, it was less then a cup since I had no more room left. My wife and I both agree that this dressing, with my changes, now is a 5-star dressing and she compared it to some of the store bought sesame-ginger dressing.  For those who like more of a ginger flavor, use powdered ginger. I tried this with 2 T of powder in lieu of the 3 T of fresh, and the ginger flavor was very strong.   I use this (revised) dressing on my salads, I use it to marinate chicken thighs, and I use it as a dressing on sandwiches.

I used my own measurements (to taste) and used another reviewers idea of using mayo in place of the olive oil, used all the other ingredients as listed. It worked really well! We prefer the creaminess and taste (really can't taste the mayo at all) to the strong flavor of the olive oil. The soy gives it a pretty ugly color (if you use mayo), so I added 2 drops of red and 3 drops of yellow coloring to get an orange color close to Thousand Island dressing!

Adored it, all of us. Great on romaine with some nuts - amazing. Very dietetic, since you don't need much of it, it's so strong. I used an immersion blender so skipped all the chopping, and it worked beautifully. Added some rice vinegar as per the recommendations, used regular mustard since I didn't have dijon in the house- it was fantastic, making it again now! Dumped some of it on frozen peas and baked it with a little water - also fantastic.

I loved this recipe! The lemon juice was amazing! The only thing I added/changed was added 4 teaspoons of sugar. Also, I used canola oil instead of olive. I used Tamari instead of soy sauce for richer flavor.

I really enjoyed this recipe!! It had great flavor and it tasted a lot like the Japanese restaurants I've been to! I used the sesame oil (oly about1/4 cup), 2 tblsp  rice vinegar and just 2 garlic cloves and it was wonderful!! It had a more liquid consistancy but it could be due to me not being the most skilled mincer. I used the extra garlic and ginger along with some dijon, honey and rice vinegar and put it on some chicken and cooked it on a hot pan hibachi style and it was the BEST chicken I have ever made!!

As others have stated before, the dressing is very bitter. I would suggest adding the sugar to bring about a more sweet taste..also I added 2 dollops of mayo, this made the dressing more creamier!

Overall, it had the taste of the traditional ginger dressing you would find at the Japanese Houses!!

I've been making this dressing since last year. I made some changes though, such as substituting 50% of the olive oil for sesame oil, plus adding 2x the amount of fresh ginger root in the original recipe. (It is a ginger dressing after all, isn't it?). I also sprinkled some sea salt, not considered in the original recipe. In addition, instead of wasting time mincing the garlic and the ginger, I cut up both of them in middle-size chunks; add the rest of the ingredients EXCEPT THE OIL, and put the whole thing in a food processor. After getting a very smooth mix, I add up the 50-50 oil little by little. The final product has made me get a lot of compliments and this dressing happens to be my wife's favorite !

Very good dressing.   I used grape seed oil instead of olive oil  and a couple teaspoons of sesame oilfor a lighter taste.  also used a blender rather than the whisk.  The only other change was I used rice wine vinegar instead of Lemon  juice.  Will make over and over!   bet it would also be good tossed with grilled or steamed  vegetables.

This "Japanese Ginger Salad Dressing" definitely needed to be strained. The first day I made this I was convinced the recipe must be missing something because it was so oily and inedible (1 star). Based on other reviews, I imagined it would taste better on the second day, so I stashed it in the fridge. On the second day I found it did taste better but was so stringy I wouldn't eat it (2 stars). I did use a ginger grater to grate my ginger. After straining the salad dressing to remove the ginger pulp as a last resort, it did in fact taste quite good (4 stars with adjusted preparation). Thank you Paula for sharing your recipe.

Delicious!!! Exactly what I was looking for.  I used canola oil instead of olive oil to avoid the bitterness.

Three easy changes to make this awesome-
1)I use canola oil instead of olive oil (more neutral flavor)
2)I add a handful of chopped baby carrots (this is traditionally served as a carrot ginger dressing)
3)I do not whisk this- use a food processor and blend until smooth adding the oil a little at a time. You'll have a smooth texture and visually pleasing dressing.

Just made this and tastes just like Kanpai Steak House. A little darker in color, but very close. I used organic ginger and raw honey. Instead of a wisk, my grandmother's antique eggbeater. Kanpai's charges a small fortune for this. Thanks for sharing.

The ingredient list is spot on, but not the quantities.  So experiment until you get those right for your own taste.  For me, it turned out to be 1:1 oil to fresh squeezed lemon juice.  I usually replace the honey with a packet of Stevia since I'm a low carber.  This combination of ingredients is spectacular.  I would have given it 5 stars if the quantities had been better to my liking.  But this is the salad dressing I use more than any other!  I always keep a jar of it in the frig.

I just made this in the food processor with the following tweaks:
- I peeled the ginger root and then threw the entire root in
- I peeled and removed the seeds from the lemon and then threw the lemon in, pulp and all
- followed others' suggestions by doing 1/2 olive oil, 1/2 peanut oil

This gave the dressing a thicker consistency.  Very tasty!  I used to live in Tokyo and this is very close to what I enjoyed there.

This was sooooo good!  The only thing I changed is that I juiced my ginger until I had about 1/4 cup and used that instead of mincing the ginger.  It was amazing! Everyone in the house loved it!

I love this recipe!  I do agree with those who say that the olive oil adds more of an oily taste than a sesame oil might, but I still like it as described.  It's very flavorful and it goes a long way-- also, it's incredibly inexpensive and quick to make.  I've found that it stores very well, too.

I was excited to try this recipe.  I followed the recipe and it is nothing like I had hoped it to be. We did not care for it.  I am using it as a dumpling sauce.  Still in search for a Japanese ginger salad dressing.

4 stars for being a good base recipe.  I used half the soy sauce and half the lemon juice, added 1/2 lime juiced, 1 tbs sesame oil, 2 - 3 tbs rice vinegar, 1/2 tsp splenda, and 3 tbs plain greek style yogurt...  then it was awesome!  Even better after sitting in the frig overnight!

It tastes good but I would reduce the amount of oil next time I make it. It comes out a bit too greasy for my taste.

I used some extra honey, and it came out quite well.

Joy and I absolutely love this style of dressing, I find it best served with a sweetened fried chip as well as a salad. A nice ripe tomato slice helps bring out the flavor. When I made this for Joy, her eyes lit up with excitement, I couldn't have been happier with this kind of flavor in a oriental dressing.

This is the BEST dressing I have tasted in years! Since I discovered it on this website approximately four weeks ago, I have made three batches. I eat it on my daily medley of raw vegetables, and I have recommended it to several of my culinary friends, Thank you, Paula!
