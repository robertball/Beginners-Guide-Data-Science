This is a wonderful dish! Instead of using a marinade, I make my own with olive oil, white vinegar, garlic, and Italian seasoning.  I use two pieces of thin cut chicken breast instead of slicing a regluar breast in half, I double the amount of provolone, keep the same ammount of basil, leave out the tomato, double the amount of bacon, and leave off the parmesan.  I cook it on a rack set over a baking sheet so that the bacon will crisp (instead of cook in the juices).This tastes especially good with "Pasta with Scallops, Zucchini, and Tomatoes", found here on this site. EDIT: I've made more changes to this dish since I first made it.  I now marinade thin cut chicken breast in Italian dressing overnight, drain it, spread basil pesto on the insides of the chicken, lay double the amount of provolone (smoked provolone is best, yum) on one slice of chicken, top it with another slice of chicken, and wrap it in double the amount of bacon (first lengthwise, then widthwise, then lengthwise again to remove the need for toothpicks).  The basil pesto makes a huge difference and really enhances the taste of the dish, and the more fat the bacon has in it, the better.  It seems to soak into the chicken and leave it extra tender.  Everyone LOVES this recipe!

This was absolutely wonderful! The flavors in this dish are amazing! I dont have a broiler pan so I had to cook these on just a plain cookie sheet, which worked out well minus slightly burning the bacon and setting off the smoke alarms lol. I cooked the bacon for a few minutes in the microwave to make sure it got fully cooked in the oven.   also didn't have grated parmesean so I just used mozerella and it was still amazing. My 3 yr old loved it and so did I. I butterflied my chicken and pounded thin before marinading...which I did for about 4 hours before cooking.   highly recommend this dish! **I also used roma tomatoes...just as a personal preference and would recommend those for this dish**

Wow! This chicken was awesome! My boyfriend is extremely picky, and he even liked it! The only suggestion I have is to cook the bacon for a couple of minutes in the microwave first, because parts of the bacon were not fully cooked.

Ok, so I made a few changes--but this chicken was SO good!  I've never written a review before but this one certainly deserves the time.  I didn't wrap it in bacon and I used shredded mozzarella instead. Try it!  You'll love it if you love basil. I can't wait to make it again.

Super! Love the flavors together. I did change things up a bit:I used pesto instead of basil leaves, and I marinated the chicken in Kraft Italian dressing. I made one with bacon, one without (for me, too fattening with bacon). Tried both and both were fantastic. So if you're watching what you eat feel free to omit the bacon and you'll still have a great dish. Served this with whole wheat speghetti in a white wine olive oil sauce. **So the cheese won't spill out while baking, try securing the chicken with toothpicks. Soak the toothpicks in water first.

This recipe came out wonderfully, despite my inexperience as a cook. I changed the marinade slightly due to what ingredients I had available, and instead used lemon juice, olive oil, fresh garlic, salt and pepper. I used parmesan cheese inside the chicken and grilled them on a George Foreman. I didn't wrap the chicken in bacon this time around, but I may just try it next time! I also chose to serve the chicken over tagliatelle and tomato sauce with more parmesan and a basil garnish.

I love the idea of the fresh tomato and basil with the provolone, but in the execution it didn't work for us.  The chicken breast was dry and way overdone.  Though edible, no one wanted seconds.  Thank you for sharing.  I'd like to tweak this a bit and work with it to make it work for us.  I will probably pound the chicken, marinate it, put in the "stuffing" and roll it and try it at a much lower temp for a shorter duration.

We really love this chicken recipe because it is so adaptable.  Any kind of cheese is great and I always add mushrooms to everything.  Try adding garlic, capers, black olives, anything you like, just remember to keep the portions small or the breasts won't close properly.  Thanks for sharing.

This has got to be one of my favorite chicken recipes! The basil really tasted delicious with the other flavors and paired well with the chicken. I used sun-dried tomatoes instead of fresh ones, but the flavor of the tomatoes was completely overshadowed by the basil. I couldn't really taste the provolone either. I think the keys to this dish were the marinade, basil, bacon, and parmesan on top. I made my own marinade with fresh crushed garlic, Italian seasoning, lemon juice, olive oil, white wine and salt & pepper. If I make it again I might just omit the other ingredients that I couldn't taste, and see if it makes a difference. All in all a fabulous recipe!

Good recipe, a blast to use our fresh basil and fresh tomatoes out of the garden. Clean up is kind of a mess, and it is lengthy to prepare but I got good responses from my guests.

Fabulous!!!!  I used a shredded Italian cheese mix, because that's what I had on hand.  After baking I transferred the chicken to a plate and drained the drippings into a small saucepan.  I added about a tablespoon of flour and 1/2 cup of cream and whisked to make a sauce.  I totally forgot about the parmesan at the end.  This turned out excellent and will definitely make again!!

My Dh and I thought this was very tasty.  The few changes I made per other reviewers were:  I cooked in oven at 350 degrees for appx 40 mins., used a whole 12 ounce bottle of herb and garlic marinade because I had already dumped it into the zip lock bag before I read the amount, but I also had 6 chicken breasts, so it worked out fine.  I also marinated for appx 4 hours.  I used prosciutto instead of bacon, which was awesome, and used Roma tomatoes.  Next time, I will use a thicker slice of provolone, more tomato and more fresh basil.

this is definitely something I will do again! I used pepper bacon and smoked mozz instead of the provolone. I do believe it should be marinated more than 30 minutes so next time I will do it over night. And I cooked it at 350F for 40 minutes. And I had the butcher people at Fred Meyer slice the chicken for me. My husband saw it when I took it out to check it and said it was rather gourmet-ish! I served it with mushroom rice pilaf that I found on here! very yummy dinner!

I suggest pounding out the chicken breasts a little.  It was little difficult wrapping them.  Make sure you don't make them so thin that they dry out though.

Oh, I used a bottle of Italian dressing as the marinade instead marinade suggested.  It was yummy.

Yum, yum, yum! I'm in England, and it's no small task to find any cheese other than cheddar here, but I was able to find slices of mozzarella, which I hoped would adhere to the original recipe as closely as possible. We LOVED it! And there was a piece left over, so we cut it up the next day and added it to a chef salad! This is an easy, delicious recipe. And we're on the Atkins, so it was ideal. Thank you!

This was very good however the bacon flavor was too much and overpowering. I will probably use pancetta next time. The provolone also oozed out of the chicken and there was none left inside. So next time I'll flatten the chicken and roll it up instead of using the butterfly method.

Very tasty! I omitted the bacon to reduce the calories, but will try it next time. Definitely need to use toothpicks to hold the breast together while cooking. Delicious!!

This Recipe is my families favorite dish!!!  My husband even loves it and he doesnt like tomatos.  I do prefer it with dried basil rather then fresh, the fresh didnt give enough flavor for me and it stayed chewy, the dried on the other hand gave off tons of flavor.

This was awesome...added extra garlic and a touch of balsamic vinegar. Bacon didn't cook crispy on the bottom so flip it last ten minutes or broil for a couple minutes at the end.

we loved it.  this morning i decided to roast tomatoes in the oven, that had been tossed with basil, s&p & garlic & a little sugar.  it was a good way to warm up the house on a cold day and use blah tomatoes!  i didn't know what to use them with and found this recipe.  after reading reviews, i thought i would try my tomatoes in this recipe.   i marinated the chicken in the juice left over from my tomatoes. i stuffed the chicken with the roasted tomatoes and grated parmesan cheese and a couple of fresh basil leaves.  i topped them with a bit of panko crumbs and baked for the suggested 15 minutes at 500 degrees and they were perfect.  thank you for all the suggestions.  i counted it as 7 points towards my diet and can't wait to make this recipe again.

This is one of my favorites if not my all time favorite recipe! I know it is my husband's favorite. What I like best is that it is great with and without changes. If you don't have the marinade, a quick substitute is your favorite seasonings mixed with olive oil, white vingear, and water (in equal proportions). I like to add extra provolone and Parmesan because cheese and me are good friends. Also, the fresh basil leaves I think helped make this recipe - they are so delicious! Use toothpicks soaked in water to hold together the chicken and bacon at the seams (a recommendation I took from another reviewer that worked great). Enjoy!

This recipe is great but I changed a few things to make it a LOT healthier & low-fat.  I used Cabot 75% fat free cheese, low fat feta (gives that sharp taste) and bacon bits sprinkled inside instead of bacon wrapped around the outside. I also marinaded in Newman's own vinager dressing (light of course).  Overall a great recipe and easily adaptable to your taste/ needs.

This was delicious! I cooked it at 400 degrees, added diced jalapeños, and precooked the bacon. Those are only changes I made. This is a keeper!

What an awesome, no-fuss, weeknight recipe!!  I threw the chicken in a bag of Kraft Country Italian dressing before I left for work in the morning, and when I got home it was ready to go.  I will cut down a little on the basil next time-the 16 leaves makes a pretty stout basil flavor.  I used grated Parmesan instead of the provolone slices, and it came out melty and flavorful!  I will definitely be making this again soon!

A wonderful and flavorful meal! The only thing I did different was stuff one breast with bacon because one of my roommates refuse to eat tomatoes. But good googly moogly! It was delicious!

I made my own herb and garlic marinade with olive oil and a spice blend I swear by then followed the recipe exactly. It was amazing! I will definetly make it again, especially if we are entertaining as it is simple, yet complicated looking and tasting!

This recipe was great and really easy. Instead of wrapping the chicken with bacon strips, I used precooked bacon and sprinkled it on top at the second 15-minute baking. Also, I added sliced mushrooms inside the chicken, and I set my oven to 475 instead of 500.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because it tasted so good. Hubby loved it. My only problem was it fell apart while being served. I will make it again though.

Stuff the breast - no need to roll up!  I cut a 1 inch slit in the side of my breasts and cut as close to the edge of the chicken all the way around the inside.  you can see and feel the knife point and is  so easy to do. I do not buy garlic and herb marinade as probably expensive - I make my own Italian dressing, take a fork and poke the breasts on the one side up and pour the marinade over and let it sit in fridge all day.  then I drain off most of the marinade and  I stuffed mine with basil paste, 2 grape tomatoes cut in half but probably could have fit 3 in and pepper jack cheese.  I cooked one slice of bacon per breast 1/2 way. then cut it in half and laid the two pieces over the breast and fastened with toothpicks.  there is no rolling up and not as much fat/calories from tons of bacon and I have so little seep out of the breast this way.  Cook for the thirty minutes then sprinkle a little parmesan cheese on top.  I have made this twice, second time used mozzarella and added some red pepper flakes.  It is our favorite chicken recipe and by using the grape tomatoes you really get the tomato and basil flavor with each bite.  The pepper jack adds a little heat and even my bland eating husband rates this dish a 10 out of 10 stars.  thanks for the basic recipe yoyo78 - a few modifications on how to prepare and it is a fantastic recipe

Really tasty. It's actually easier than it sounds. You can interchange the stuffing inside. The second time I put in ham and mozzarella cheese. That was a blast too.

The entire family LOVED this recipe!  I par cooked the bacon so the chicken didn't dry out. the fresh tomatoes kept the chicken moist. This recipe was so easy to prepare,  it will be a staple at our house.  The fresh basil gave it great flavor. I even added a couple table spoons of water to the pan drippings and drizzled it over the chicken.  POW POW

This turned out great! Pretty and easy and not too time consuming. My only suggestion would be to keep the cheese in the middle of the chicken so when it melts it doesn't drip off onto the pan.

This was phenominal! I followed ingredients listed but did change how I cooked it. I put it in a baking dish at 375 for about 45 minutes. I found that the bacon would not get crispy because of the chicken resting in the juices so I drained it and it cripsed up fine. Otherwise, could put on a tray of some kind so it's not in the juices

Loved this. Great flavors. Precooked the bacon a little and decreased the oven temp to avoid smoke alarms. Garlic herb marinade used was from this site. Doubled it.

I do not include the bacon or the sprinkle of parmesan at the end.  I also make my own marinade.  The recipe is great without the provolone too!  For me, a marinade, tomatoes, chicken, and basil will suffice. the way I make is Paleo-friendly.

I am purposefully making more than enough just to have left-overs this is so yummy! I use pesto instead of basil since the more garlic the better. Cannot wait to make this again.

These turned out really good. 
I decided to grill them on the bbq instead of baking since I only have use of a bbq for another couple weeks and want to take advantage while I can. 
I had to improvise on the marinade. I sprinkled dried garlic and herb seasoning on them and refrigerated with olive oil overnight. 
I used canned diced tomatoes because I had an open container in the fridge I wanted to use up. They were fine but I'll use fresh tomato slices next time as called for. 
I only used 2 slices of bacon per breast, because that was all I had left. I found that was more than enough.
They are tricky to hold together, but so good

Tasted incredible!  Made a few modifications due to ingredient availablility and loved it...  The hot temp really made it steam/smoke so it made my house very smoky... but aside from that, the dish is delish!

Very delicious although the first time I made it, it looked pretty gross because of semi uncooked looking bacon. Still tasted great. Second time - I tried precooking but then the bacon didn't wrap so nicely and I had to fill the chicken with toothpicks to get it to stay. My presentation was lousy so I just added a bunch of cheese on the top to cover the mistakes. Still tastes amazing.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I think it's a really good middle of the road kind of recipe that would be awesome for company also.  Few changes:  since we don't eat pork, I substituted turkey bacon.  Also, used the Garlic and Herb Marinade that I found on allrecipes to marinate the chicken with.  Cooked in my steam oven on the grill function for 20 minutes total also.

It was very good aside from the tomato inside; I didn't care for it. I would probably spread the inside with pesto, then layer the cheese, close up and wrap with bacon.

Great Recipe!!!! I needed something quick and easy in a hurry b/c my boyfriends parents were coming over.  The only thing I did different is after the chicken was done, I turned the broiler on until the bacon on top was crispy.  Everyone was super impressed and it was a delicious, inexpensive dish.  Very nice, thanks for adding it!!

Love this recipe! I use Italian seasoning mixed with olive oil as my marinade and then just sprinkle the Parm cheese on top of the tomato instead of on the outside. With a gas oven the bacon comes out crispy and the chicken tastes delicious!

I made one important (I believe) change.  I used thinly sliced proscuitto instead of bacon.  I baked it in a 350 degree oven for 40 minutes.  I find bacon too fatty and once your chicken is cooked, the bacon isn't.  The proscuitto browned and crisped beautifully and the chicken wasn't overdone.  My hubby pronounced this recipe "a keeper".  We also used fresh basil and tomatoes out of our garden.

I have to agree with another user about this recipe.  It had everything I liked, it was simple and quick to make but the end result of the dish was just blah.  It lacked serious flavor and was a major disappointment at the dinner table.

I made this for my in laws and they loved it.  I used fresh tomatoes and basil from the garden.  It was a hit.  The only thing I would add is a light sauce on top of the chicken.  I made the cherry tomato and string bean side dish that is on this site and it made a nice sauce that I would consider putting over the chicken.

Hi ...

This is the most wonderful recipe ... I essentially prepared it quite to the recipe minus the bacon ... I can't think of one element of this recipe that went wrong ... I prepared it in a non-stick (Technique) pan so clean up would be easier ... otherwise, I know that it would be impossible to clean the pan otherwise ... it can be easily overdone so stick to 15 minutes per side ... this would be a fun recipe to prepare for guests because it can be made in advance and then baked to perfection ... I think that I will try it with the bacon the next time ... but WOW ... THE CALORIES!!!  I think that this would be a croud pleasing receipe.

This dish is fantastic! Full of flavor and the chicken breast was nice and moist; not dry at all. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great. Of course, you can't go wrong when you wrap bacon strips around just about anything! But seriously, I used "Good Seasons" Garlic & Herb dressing as marinade and I let the chicken sit in it for about 6 hours.
I think next time I make this, I'll try to change it up a bit. It would be good with feta cheese or cream cheese and maybe some spinach...you could add any of your favorite ingredients. My thanks to YOYO78; this one's a keeper!

Oh gosh, this was soooo yummy.  We soaked the chicken in buttermilk (milk/vinegar) for a day first, and it was super tender.  The whole family loved it!  Great flavor!!

WOW! This was incredible :-D I couldn't find the suggested marinade, so I used one that we really like, a lemon-garlic marinade, and it was wonderful.  I was wary of how much filling to use, so I used less of everything (basil- the leaves were huge!, tomato, and provalone), but after making it, I think the suggested amount would have been perfect.  DEFINITELY a keeper. Thanks for the recipe :)

My husband and I LOVED this!!  I didn't use bacon, and I didn't have any garlic marinade, and on my own I didn't use any cheese, but for my husband I did.
I used a little olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic powder in place of the marinade.  It was SOOO easy and SOOO yummy.  My hubby asked for it again the next day!  LOL!!

I didn't have italian dressing so I used olive oil, italian seasoning, lemon juice, and a little balsamic dressing.  I omitted the bacon, and just layered the marinated chicken in the bottom of a lightly oiled pan, topped it with slices of tomato, chopped fresh basil, and layered sliced provolone on top.  Covered with foil and baked.  Drained the juiced a couple of times as it was definitely wet enough!  Made sure the chicken was cooked through, added parmesan and uncovered to cook for a few more minutes.  Served with a side of pasta and minimal sauce - it was delicious!  Had the leftovers minus pasta for lunch the next day.  Super tasty!  Will make again!

I used an Italian dressing to marinade it in, Olive Garden's to be exact. I actually used crushed Basil, and then a Bay leaf in the chicken. Mozzarella was used instead of provolone. and I put mozzarella on top as well. I did not flip it, because I garnished it ahead of time. Basically I put everything on it all at once. Plus, I did take it out at 15 minutes, but only to check if it was sticking, which it wasn't. Oh yes, and I used glass to cook it in. I also tried it like this without the bacon, but it became drier, so if you don't use bacon, cook a little less. Always make sure it is thoroughly cooked though. I definitely will use this again.

I made this with two simple changes: First off, I used pre-cooked bacon.  After 40 minutes at 375, it came out nice and crispy.  Second off, I added sliced avocados on top. It was a nice finishing touch.  I will definitely make this again.

So. Stinkin. Good. So tasty fresh ojt of the oven! Bacon makes it a bit greasy as leftovers but still good. I'm lactose intolerant so I used shredded "mozzarella" with a sprinkle of nutritional yeast to give it more of a cheese flavor. Opted not to cut the breast all the way through, left partially in tact. Simple, so good and impresses easily.

The time and effort was definitely worth it as the resulting meal was to die for.  After reading the reviews of others that have prepared it I made a few changes.  I made my own marinade with fresh herbs, garlic, olive oil, honey and just a splash of balsamic vinegar. I only marinaded the chicken for about 30 minutes but I had reserved a small amount to soak the tomato and basil in for a minute or so.  It was a little more difficult (and messy ) but then after letting the chicken drain a moment I butterflied the breast, placed 2 slices of provolone on one side to cover the bottom of one half and let it overlap onto the other side.  Then I covered the bottom part with the marinaded tomato and chopped fresh basil.  Folded it over letting the tomato get wrapped in provolone and chicken then secured it with toothpicks. I wrapped  the breast with 4 slices of bacon (the breast I used were actually about 12 ounces each).
  I then browned the bacon on each side of the chicken until crispy (starting on the "top"-the side that will be visible when plated, then carefully flipped it and did the " bottom").  I then covered the skillet and baked them in the oven for about 30 minutes at 350 degrees (when the juices ran clear). I uncovered it, grated parmesan over it and returned it to the oven until the cheese was melted. 
The chicken was juicy and tasted like chicken, it was not overpowered by too many flavors but enhanced in layers, from crispy bacon outside to the gooey inside. As I was

Pretty much made it as written with a few tweaks (after reading other comments).   Marinated in Italian dressing for about 3 hours.  Four basil leaves/breast was perfect with 2 slices of Roma tomatoes.  I did use 2 toothpicks each just to make turning easier.  I baked it at 425 for 15 minutes per side.  I put the Provolone cheese on top and baked another few minutes until it melted.  Easier clean up - I put foil on the bottom of the broiler pan and sprayed Pam on the top.   This is a KEEPER!  Loved it!

hubby's comment: This was extraordinary
my comment: superb

. Here are my changes based on what i had on hand for dinner:
i used split chicken breast marinated for 4 hours in a balsamic vinaigrette i threw together, baby spinach leaves and mozzarella cheese.
i cooked these in the oven at 400 F for 30 minutes and then rotated the pan, cooking an additional 10 minutes. i served the chicken over a bed of wilted spinach. i cooked the remaining marinade down into a reduction.

thank you for the inspiration for tonight's dinner!! i will be making this again.

The flavor was awesome.  Due to the thick nature of the breats though, took longer than 30 mins.  Be sure to keep an eye on the  internal temp to make sure this cooks.

Way too much fat, grossly over done and the provolone melted out of the center. That being said the flavor profile has much merit and I will alter the recipe when I make it again.

I used this as a starter recipe. I had Perdue perfect portions, Italian seasoned. But you can easily just use oregano etc etc. The Perdue pieces are very thin. What I ended up doing was put a fresh basil leaf, some fresh grated Manchengo cheese, 2 thin slices tomato and rolled them up. I also put another fresh basil leaf on top and lightly drizzled with olive oil. You can place the rolls in a muffin tin or hold with a tooth pick. The flavor was fresh and the kitchen smells amazing. Pork is never cooked in my home and turkey bacon is too lean to keep moisture in, so I left it off.

Made it for the first time tonight! The chicken was cooked perfectly, and was still moist. :D Unfortunately, I did not have fresh basil, and I finished off my partially used can on tomatoes. It was still very delicious! I cannot wait for summer when I will have fresh Basil and tomatoes from the garden! This meal will be all the better. My husband compared it to a meal from a fancy restaurant. :D Yum!

I tried this receipt without tomatoes because both me and my husband do not like them.  Mine ended up cooking for almost 30 minutes in order to get the internal temperature up to 160 and it still looked a little pink in the middle.  We ate it and it tasted slimy. There was also a good bit on greasy fat at the bottom of the pan.
The next day for leftovers I caramelized some onions and garlic and sliced the meat and browned it.  At the end I added precooked corn.  It was very good with the toasted bacon and the melted cheese. The second day was much better.

With a few of the changes suggested in the comments, this was DELICIOUS. I followed the early steps pretty close, except I also added about 1 tbsp of cream cheese to each chicken's stuffing. I then baked it at 450 for 25 minutes, flipped each chicken, and baked on the other side for another 20 minutes. It was amazing and my guests wolfed it down. Will definitely be making again.

This recipe is now in our regular rotation.  One thing we discovered is that the provolone tends to melt and dribble out of the assembled chicken during cooking. So now we add the slice on top at the end for just a few minutes in the oven; just long enough to melt.  Also we use dried tomatoes ( that we grow our selves and dehydrate before storing in freezer bags) Fresh tomatoes tend to cook down a lot. With dried tomatoes you get more "tomato" in it.

I tried this recipe but added a few other ingredients. Instead of a big tomato I used sliced cheery tomatoes and added small slices of ham and broccoli (small amount) then fold chicken wrap with the bacon. When done added 1tbsp of Alfredo sauce on each chicken and put in oven for that last 2-3 minutes. I enjoyed!!

Next time I may stuff a bit more in the chicken, but that's just me being extra.  It was GREAT as is.  Bacon turned out perfect.

This is a great way to spice up chicken. I used basil from my garden and tossed them on the grill for some hungry boys... they loved it!

This meal was so easy to prepare, and I got to use fresh basil from my garden.  I'll definitely make it again, and I can't wait to try with different cheeses as some other reviewers suggested.

I thought this was very good. My husband liked it as well. I tweaked the recipe just a little bit though. We're trying to eat healthier so I didn't use any bacon and I only sprinkled some grated parm on top (no cheese on the inside). I also used six basil leaves on each chicken breast and I used the store-bought, thin-sliced chicken so I didn't have to bother slicing it. We had a surplus of basil, since we grow it and love it, so that's why I opted to use more than the recipe recommended. I also only cooked it for 15 minutes on each side and didn't bother putting it back in the oven to melt the cheese, because the chicken was thoroughly cooked at that point. I will definitely make this again! Thanks!

They smelt awesome while cooking, however the basil was way over bearing.  It also too longer to cook up the bacon, so ultimately the chichen dried out.  I would suggest pounding the breast prior to stuffing them.  And use way less basil.

This was excellent. I stuck almost completely to what the recipe called for, with a couple minor ecxeptions. I used a cheese & garlic italian dressing marinade and left it to marinate for at least an hour. Also, I added some fresh mushrooms and a little salt and pepper. Delicious!I am somewhat new to cooking and I get most of my ideas from this site. I have tried making quite a few recipes but this is really one of my most favorite. My picky-eater boyfriend loved it too!

Very good for a gathering.  The Provolone was very mild...I might like to try it next time with a Havarti with spices and herbs in it.

Everyone loved this recipe and it was so easy to make. My wife said it was restaurant quality. Definitely a keeper! I didn't have fresh Parmesan cheese so I used grated, which didn't melt as much. Next time I will use fresh Parmesan cheese.

I made this for my friends and they loved it! I might try a little more provolone next time but it was delicious! I had to put many toothpicks in to hold it together but I just placed them quite close to each other in the pan and they stayed together nicely.  I removed the toothpicks before serving them and had no problem with them falling apart.  I also pre-cooked the bacon for a few minutes and I think that really helps the bacon crisp up during cooking.

Well I chose this recipe due to all the good ratings and have to say I was disappointed. It was good, but not great, especially with the work involved and the mess it created.  We ate it, but it won't be a do-over.

So Good! I marinated the chicken overnight in Newmans own herb and garlic marinade. Then, I stuffed the breast with shredded chedder cheese, mushrooms and basil leaves.  I took the advice from previous reviews and cooked the bacon in a pan till almost done before wrapping the chicken, placed chicken on a baking sheet, 15 mins on each side at 475 and Delicious! My Boyfriend asked me when i'll make this again! Thanks!

This was AWESOME. The chicken was so moist and the flavor of the basil just spread through the chicken. The only thing was that even after turning on the broiler in the end for a few minutes, the bacon didnt cook all the way. So maybe id pre-cook the bacon.

Amazing recipe! I didn't change anything and it turned out fantastic. This was my first "real" meal I tried to make and it worked out perfectly. It was pretty simple and relatively quick.

 Here are some quotes from the guys I made it for: "My tastebuds are tingling!" and "This is, like, restaurant quality."

Bacon makes everything tastier, I suppose, but it also makes everything heavier. Even chicken. I might add a tad more basil and tomatoes next time to give it a fresher taste... otherwise, the bacon overwhelms the dish.

Great way to use up that basil in the garden! Used turkey bacon and thought it was a little unneccesary (why add the extra fat?), maybe it's different with regular bacon...Also ran out of parm. cheese for the top--can't wait to try with it on! Great quick meal recipe with simple ingredients on hand, though!

I loved this recipe. I made it for my boyfriend who has a tendency of being picky and he loved it too. He said it was close to restaurant quality! The only thing I changed was that before I wrapped the chicken with the bacon I did a light fry on the bacon in a pan first so it would cook through and become extra crispy. It seemed to work well!

This wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  I think cooking it on 500 degrees for 15 minutes on each side was too long.  My chicken was really dry.  Next time I won't cook it as long and see if this makes a difference.

This recipe was really good, It was my first time ever making anything like this before and my family loved it. I would wait to put the cheese in until the last 10 minutes because it all melted out. I also put a handful of provalone cheese on top of the chicken. It was great

A great recipe - definitely the best I have - pretty simple to make and absolutely delicious. I've made it using a sun-dried tomato dressing as the marinade and I think it came out the better than garlic herb or Italian dressings. Does smoke up the kitchen a little when that dressing burns on the pan though - cook with a window open.

I tried this last night and it was AMAZING! My husband is a total "food snob" and I have very picky little eaters under the age of 6. Everyone LOVED it and my husband even said it was his new favorite!  I used Roma tomatoes - just a personal preference. Next time I think I will slice them a bit thinner. I also set my oven to 475 instead of 500. My brioler pan was a mess, but it was well worth it! All in all - a huge hit at our house!

We love this recipe! I have made some changes though because my poor basil plant died. Instead of fresh basil leaves I spread basil garlic pesto in the chicken. I have also replaced the cheese with fresh mozzarella. I wrap the chicken breasts (once stuffed) with turkey bacon. That's just personal choice. I have also done it with procuitto. I love love love this recipe it makes the house smell so good and i always get tons of compliments. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Holy  this is delicious. The longer you marinate the chicken, the stronger the flavor. I love it to pieces!!!

This was very yummy.  I used light italian dressing to marinate the chicken, and also threw in some spinach leaves that I needed to use up.  Delicious.

This is fantastic!  I cooked the chicken on a rack, sitting in a baking sheet, it cooked faster, and at a lower temp, and the bacon turned out perfectly crispy.

This recipe had good flavor but was difficult to keep together.  Not easy to slice the chicken breasts evenly, the bacon slipped off and burned, and flipping the chicken breast was a nightmare (the insides fell all over).  I used roma tomatoes(great flavor and hold together well) and pesto sauce instead of basil.  Next time I make this I will use more cheese inside and tie the breasts closed with some kitchen twine to make flipping easier.
