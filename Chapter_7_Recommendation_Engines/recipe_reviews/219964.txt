I had a similar old recipe which I love, but then I tried to follow this recipe, just change a little bit of the way to melt the chocolate (I melted it on a steamer, beware of the condensation, and just melted it halfway then continue mix the mixture with spoon until completely melted, so it will not be lumpy). I served it in the ramekins, because the top of my cake was cracked, so I thought it will look cool just like that. And I served it with vanilla ice cream, perfect!! If you love chocolate then you'll love this recipe, I for sure will make it again and again. Picture uploaded :)

This is a great easy recipe. Just a little note. If you are not as strong as John you should definitely use a hand mixer. So that you get the right consistency with your eggs and sugar mix. Mine came out a little flat but I believe that it was because of the consistency of my egg and sugar mixture. It still came out great! Thank you very much John! This turned out to be a great ending to our mother's day dinner.

Wonderfully rich! Warning however!! I tried this recipe to test it before I served it to company and made 4.  With 4, as the recipe called for, it turned out exactly as expected at 18 minutes in my oven.  The next day I adjusted the servings to 12.  Instead of the nice cake-like batter I'd got the day before was more brownie batter-like.  I baked, as called for 18 minutes and couldn't tell if they were done or not.  Of course I can't poke the center with a toothpick, so I was uncertain to know when they were done as they looked OK, but didn't want to bake too long and loose the centers.  So I took them out at 18 minutes and let sit for the 15 minutes.  When I inverted them onto a plate, they were not done, even though I was able to run a toothpick around the edges and have it be clean.  They could have baked 3 or so minutes longer.  I then remembered the day before, when I got great results, the edges were JUST starting to pull away from the sides.  So if you intend to make larger batches and bake them together, remember to bake a bit longer and watch for those edges, or you may end up with chocolate pudding instead, like I did.  Good luck!

oh wow!!!!  This is unbelievable!  My daughter and I were watching MasterChef and they made a chocolate lava cake.  I had to make it,  so I went to my favorite website!  This recipe was so simple and quick.  I was amazed.  I melted 4 oz of tollhouse chocolate chips with the butter because that was all I had.  It tated like the ones I've gotten at a restaurant!  My batter was not thick and I'm sure it is because I used my KitchenAid mixer and didn't attempt to mix it by hand.  I did not put it in a bag (i just didn't see the point), I did not refrigerate and I didn't cook it in a pan of water.  They did none of that on MasterChef :).  Why make more work for yourself.  Everyone's oven is different, but I cooked them for 11 min.  Next time, I will cook it 1 min more.  I will definitely be serving this when I have company over for dinner and to make it easier, I will refrigerate the batter so that all I have to do is pop it in the oven when we are finished eating.

I hate leaving bad reviews, but this just didn't work.  I went over the recipe last night 20+ times.  I did everything as stated.  The batter was so thick, and came out like a brownie.  I even took them out at 14 minutes, just because I like things a little under done when it comes to cakes, and cookies.  They were still hard, no liquid center.

Tried this recipe tonight for dinner.  It was fantastic, just like you would get a restaurant.   I made 4 of them.  My hubby ate 2 right away!  Was very easy, though I didn't use the ziplock bag method.  I didn't have dark baking chocolate at hand, so I tried it with milk chocolate, it was still great.

Followed the recipe exactly and they didn't rise at all.  The batter was really thick which is when I got suspicious.  Basically made brownies.

So easy, yet SO delicious. I made the batter the day before a dinner party, put it in the ramekins and just refrigerated the whole kit and caboodle until dishes were being cleared and coffee was being made at dinner the next night. Took it right from the fridge, put it in the oven and out came an amazing, chocolatey decadence. Oohs and ahhhs from all. It was a a TOTAL success and I will definitely make it again.

My goodness this is delicious! I baked mine for about 15 minutes and got a nice gooey center, not sure if I could get the batter more gooey like lava. I used a 72% dark chocolate and it was very rich, it tastes delicious with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, you can mix some butter and chocolate together and microwave it to drizzle it onto the ice cream for extra flavor. The batter doesn't rise so all the pictures you see are actually what they look like, they somewhat resemble hockey pucks. Will definitely make again.

Fantastic! Not too sweet, and not too rich, just right! Make sure to grease the ramekins well, but otherwise, worked out quite well! Highly recommended :)

Recipe didn't work for me. The result was more like a rather tasteless chocolate cupcake, there was NO molten center.  Pehaps the bake time/temp are wrong or some of the directions are defective.  I will keep looking for a good lava cake recipe, this one isn't it for me.

Wouldn't waste my time with this again.  Doesn't taste any better than the box kind, takes more work, wastes food (what do you do with the 2 leftover whites?), instructions are screwy and incomplete (step 1 puts the ramekins in a casserole dish and step 12 puts them in again). Instructions don't say what temp to melt butter & chocolate (only in video). You don't need to make the mess of putting batter into baggie, less trouble to just spoon it into ramekins.

Very good chocolate taste.....however despite very thorough buttering of ramekins.......removal was quite difficult and ended up in less than perfect cakes.  The consistency was more brownie with a slightly gooey centre....not the wonderful crunchy outside and molten inside I expected.  I followed instructions to the letter.. not going to try again.

Absolutely amazing! They're so delicious my daughter insisted to add milk in the ramekin so not to waste any single bit of the cake. My husband asked why the cake was so small. LOL...

To avoid the center not being runny like some reviewers had experienced, I took the advice to place a piece of chocolate in center of the batter before baking. There are 8 squares of chocolate in a bar. I simply save 2 squares from the bar of chocolate, break each square in half and put in each ramekin. Which means I only melt 6 squares with the butter. The cakes turn out moist and the center is runny. So easy to make and fool-proof.

After 3 attempts, I almost got it right. For some reason this simple recipe has proved quite difficult for me. Still, it is the best tasting molten cake recipe so I keep at it. On the fourth attempt I will bake it a little longer and top it with sugared berries to cut through the richness of the dark chocolate. These last little tweaks should make it just right. Oh a little secret, to make the center flow like lava, I push a 1/2 oz of chocolate (or however much you prefer) down into the batter. Worked like a charm.

I made this for my friend's birthday and it was a HUGE success!  Very easy to make!  She had been telling me how nothing recently had satisfied her chocolate craving so I knew I had to make a decadent chocolate cake!  This made her chocolate dreams come true! Not even huge chocolate fans were licking their plates!

I made this recipe and  it turned out perfect and got rave reviews.  I made the batter and placed it in the ramekins the day before and refrigerated it covered with plastic wrap.  I baked them in the oven just as we sat down for our main course. They baked for about 17 minutes.  They inverted onto the plates very easily and because they were still hot, the lava poured out beautifully.  We served them with vanilla ice cream.  I always make these just prior to eating them otherwise the lava firms up if made too early.  This recipe is the best I've ever tasted!!  I used dark dipping chocolate and used an electric mixer for the eggs.  I followed the instructions exactly and it turned out perfect.  One time I doubled it and it still turned out perfect!!

Mmmmm, it was delicious -- even though I screwed up! In step #12, I poured too much water, a little over half, and when it was time to serve, the center wasn't as creamy as it should've been. Next time, I know this will be perfect! Thank you Chef John for such a great recipe

I tried this recipe for the first time last night for my mom's birthday and it was a great hit.... My boyfriend said the 5.5oz was not big enough so he purchased me the 7oz ramekins and I doubled the recipe and cooked it for the same amount of time is was sooooooo good. My boyfriend told me I could make it for him any time I wanted :-)  thank you Chef for posting the recipe I for sure will make again and again...

Made this with coconut oil instead of butter. It came out delicious. I also used one Tbsp of sugar instead of 3.

Wow turned out as expected. followed the directions to a t...
and my family was impressed. so was I lol. wouldn't change a thing.

The timing when you let them cool is the key, 
baked for 16 minutes,
cool 15 min, exactly, any more rest and the lava
will not flow like it should. 

Thank you chef John ...another great recipe.

So yummy and so easy.  People will think you are brilliant...seems very fancy!! I served it with ice cream and fresh raspberries to cut the richness.  I listened to NW Hairgal and watched for the cake to pull away from the sides of the dish...it was perfect...thanks for the tip!!.

I must have over baked mine because the inside didn't flow out when cut open...it was a soft middle but not like "lava".  The flavor was good though, like a dense chocolate cake.  I do think it loses something without the flow of lava.  I may try it again sometime?

The flavor & texture of this cake made it completely worth the effort of making from scratch!  I let mine cook all the way and just dug into the warm centers a bit & placed a scoop of ice cream right into it.  I would NOT do the plastic bag again... made a mess. I'll just use a spoon next time.

It took a long time to rise, so by the time it did, the center was baked and no longer liquid. It has a rich flavor and our family liked it as a cake, just did not get to experience the lava.

The recipe was super easy to follow. This cake was exactly what I was looking for. One caution, bake for the 15 minutes the recipe says. I overboard my first batch by about 5 minutes. It was still very tasty. Second batch baked for the 15 minutes was perfect.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly.  My tip is to now over mix the mixture. There will be weird air bubbles. Definitely a recipe to keep. Thanks Chef John!

I followed the recipe/video exactly and it turned out perfectly. My stove tends to bake hot, so I cooked 16 minutes on the nose. I used heart shaped ramekins and served with raspberry sauce and whipped cream.  People were licking their plates clean.

I tired this recipe for a Father's day treat. Instead of baking at 425, I lowered the temp to 415 (my oven is a little hot for most recipes) and left it in for only 13 minutes and it was too overdone. It was slightly gooey inside but not at all what I was hoping for/expecting; did not match the picture at all.

I followed the recipe to a T and the cakes came out dense, didn't rise, and had no liquid center. It tasted like a fluffy, dark, rich brownie. It was okay with ice cream.

I am not a big fan of chocolate cakes , so I give this rating in the name of my family, who loved it!!! for me it was way to heavy,I could barely eat one and I felt like I ate an elephant... Anyway, I made mine in paper disposable cups for muffins (do not have ramekins)they rose nicely... easy to make, and will impress for chocolate cake lovers...

A success! Much easier than you'd think they are to make. I baked 6 of them in a muffin tin for about 10 minutes and did everything else exactly.

I just made these and they turned out wonderful! I ran out of white flour and ended up adding wheat flour. Surprisingly the lava cake came out pretty good. I can probably boast of it being a 'healthier' version :)

This was good! It is hard to tell when they are done though... Mine was close. The bottom wasn't as done as the sides but the inside was soft like pudding. Great introduction to molten cake baking. I halved the recipe to make two ramekins...

My favorite lava cake recipe! So rich and decadent! If anyone is complaining they didn't have a gooey center, you over baked it. The key to getting them perfect is making sure the eggs and sugar are beaten very well until thickened and foamy. I used a stand mixer to beat while I got every thing else ready. Also, make sure you refrigerate as the directions state! I just refrigerate batter earlier in the day so it's ready to bake come dessert time! I found mine were perfect when the edges were firm and the center when pressed on was firm enough that your finger didn't go into the center of the cake but when pressed on you could feel that the inside was "jiggly".

I actually just moved and realized I can' t find my ramekins so I used a cupcake tin.  Made adjustments to time in oven (7-8 minutes is perfect, 10 or more and they cook through), otherwise followed exactly and they were perfect.  Also there was no need for the water bath using cupcake tin.  Made 7 instead 4.

These little lava cakes are the perfect chocolate fix. Rich cake on the outside with a fudgy center. I skipped the refrigeration and the piping - neither was necessary.

I've made Chocolate Lava cakes before, but I couldn't find my recipe, so I used this one.  I'm not sure what happened, but they came out rubbery and didn't have a liquid center.  Also, the flavor did not have that great chocolate taste.  I cooked for 18 minutes and I let them cool for the recommended 15 minutes.

This is so easy and so impressive. I used ghirardelli intense dark Cabernet chocolate.  Truly decadent!  I used my stand mixer to beat the eggs and sugar then mixed everything else by hand.  My batter was not thick at all so I did not use a pastry bag. I baked them for 18 minutes and they were perfect.  I plan on making these for company soon!!

Ahh, delicious perfection! These turned out so rich and light on the outside and all gooey chocolate goodness on the inside! I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made them and they were awesome! The second time, I did add a bit more vanilla extract and liked that even better. I have even made these using almond extract for another taste delight. Thanks Chef John for giving us a little bit of chocolaty heaven in a ramekin! :)

I am so sorry to say only one star. I was so excited about this dessert! I followed the directions and the cakes came out flat not to mention they were not sweet enough. We ate them with ice cream and when we were done both my husband and I had eaten all the ice cream around the lava cake and left the cake. It was disappointing.

I'm sorry, but I followed the recipe by the dot and I was really excited because the recipe looked stupendous and I had guests over that day. I ate the cake with some homeade whipped cream, but once I tried the molten lava cake I was extremely dissapointed. I could tell my guests didn't like it as well because they always compliment me when I make other dishes or desserts, but there was just pure silence while everyone ate the inedible lava cake. It was way to heavy.

This is a super easy and tasty recipe. The end product will be as good as the quality of the chocolate you use, so be sure to use a high quality baking chocolate. I don't recommend the water bath as it caused my cakes to bake unevenly (slightly ironic considering the wonders they do for cheesecakes). My first batch, the top half of the cake looked done when the bottom half was still completely runny. If I had baked them for any longer, the top would have been overcooked. The second batch I didn't use the water bath and they came out perfect, no problems releasing the cakes from the ramekins. Even after keeping in the fridge for 2 days, I found that the best time/temperature combo for my oven was 350F for 15 minutes.

The first time I made this, I was not so successful. (Left it in the oven too long). I made it a second time and it was so yummy! When I host a meal at my house, this is the dessert that everyone wants.

I never leave bad reviews but I followed the recipe exactly and they were flat and the lava part wasn't there! If you ask me all I tasted was salt so do even bother putting the salt in! Once again I will say this was a horrible cake.

I also tried this recipe and it turned out like a cookie.  It didn't raise. I don't see a raising ingredient in the recipe so I don't know how it could work. I followed every instruction in the recipe.

This was fantastic! I used the recipe exactly and this was just so wonderful! My nieces and I made them together and they were smitten! I used a hand mixer though because it got hard to mix on it's own. But these were fantastic!!! I would make them again!

I made this recipe for my husband for Father's Day. At 15 minutes, the batter was still runny, which is unusual for my oven. I ended up baking the cakes for another 10 minutes. The cake was wonderful! Nice crumb on the outside and rich, gooey chocolate on the inside.

This recipe worked great.  Remember to taste the mixture.  If too sweet or to bitter it will be the same once baked.  Also use unsalted butter not salted.

Flavor and texture were excellent. Very rich but small and perfect for a little something rich after a healthy meal or dinner party.
I made this for dessert when Samantha and Alphonse came for dinner.
Used green ramekin cups.

Serve with coffee ice cream, cooking for 17 mins was too long, no melting on inside. Got 4 white ramekins out of the recipe, but the cakes do not rise any more than the height of the raw batter. Maybe double the batch to get them taller???

great recipe, really easy to make. I would suggest baking it for a little less than 15 minute, 14 would do he trick if you want a gooey centre. might have just been my oven though. good luck!

I may not be fair on this one but, it wasn't a good cake. When I cooked  the cake was either a brownie or it looked like icing. The flavour was OK. When I fliped the rameking half of the cake would of came out. It was good ,but not delicious. (I did'nt butter the ramekins. I used PAM so it may did interfere the cooking process.)

This was lovely! For those saying the outcome was like a brownie, I have a couple of hints. Don't skimp on beating the eggs. The egg and sugar mixture must be light and thick. After the 15 minute baking, take the ramekins out of the water beefier letting them stand. Mine had a delicate texture with great "lava" and flavor.

I followed all of the instructions but subbed milk chocolate for dark chocolate.  It did not come out as lava cake.  It was just moist cake, not brownies as others have complained about, but it did not ooze chocolate goodness.  I won't be making this one again.

This chocolate lava cake was OK. I baked mine for the amount of time it said to bake it, and when I cut it open, there was no chocolate lava  :( sadly. I guess I overcooked it since it is a lava cake... but I could still taste some moist in it. But when I swallowed it, it wouldn't go down my throat, so I had to chug it down with some milk. The flavor of the cake was good though. Thanks Chef John!

I made this for my  chocolate-loving husband for Valentine's Day, and it was so good.  When we ate the first 2 while they were still warm, it was mostly lava with little cake, but the next day the portions seem about right.  Delicious, either way.

Delicious Valentines treat.  Although I tried the plastic bag trick, I still made a mess of it, possibly  because I doubled it to have the leftovers. They  are very easy to reheat enjoy. Thanks Chef John!

Really good without changing anything. My only suggestion would be to bake it at 13 min or maybe  a touch less not any longer. And serve while still warm.

It turned out FANTASTIC! My only comments are to definitely use an electric mixer for the egg and sugar mixing and the recipe didn’t indicate which flour to use so I thought self rising would best- and it WAS.

This lava cake was a hit at my dinner party! I made the batter earlier in the day and put it in the fridge. I baked it for 20 minutes at 400 degrees as the oven couldn't go any higher. The middle wasn't liquid but it was so soft. With vanilla ice cream it was perfect. I will definitely make this again??

These were amazing! Very easy to make. My family loves the melting cakes you get when your on a Carnival cruise.  These were without a doubt better. Yum!!! I will make them again. But as Chef John mentioned, every oven cooks differently. I watched for that special glaze look on the tops. Mine cooked just a little to long but now I know. Still Great!

I don’t normally write a review but this one wow it’s soooo good! Thank you chef John for the wonderful receipe. I followed exactly with the receipe but as recommended by the chef I covered with aluminum foil, I am using professional convention oven so I reduce the temperature to 210 C and baked only 11 mins. It’s perfect as you see from the photo I attached.  NOw this is one of my favorite desert receipe!

It was delicious!!Although there were a couple set backs.The first of which is I have no ramekins so I used muffin tins.I'm don't think it changed anything crucial it was just a brain strainer at first to come up with something that would work similarly.And it really did work fantastically.Secondly, I have no mixer...and whisking those eggs and sugar together by hand just about did me in.
I did see it through and the effort was well worth it.And lastly, I overcooked it. Like a lot.
We ended up with very decadent chocolate brownies, honestly not the end of the world.
I do wish it would have turned out like I had planned but this just means I get to try again. At the end of the day all that matters is we liked it and it was a fun learning experience.I will definitely make this again.
.. I just gotta get a mixer.
Thanks Chef John.

THIS RECIPE DOES NOT WORK! Avoid at all costs. I made an account specifically to warn others about this recipe. It's a huge pain and resulted in tiny, bitter cakes. No lava to be found.

These were delicious. I thought they weren't cooked but they look the same at 15 minutes as they did at 18. I'd like to find a substitute for all the butter though, soon good but soon bad.

Followed evrything it said except for refrigerating it for 2 hrs. I do not know if this affected it but it came out horrible. It looked nothing like it and solid and dense. It did not taste bad, but it was not a lava cake and looked really bad. I probably messed it up, but I am just sharing my experience.

This recipe is very forgiving. Exact measurements not needed! I've made it twice and it was a hit. For those who like an intense dark chocolate flavour, this recipe should be in your collection.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  The result was slightly gooey but not oozing as I would have expected.  The cake at the bottom of the ramekins which was in the water bath remained gooey, without a firmer exterior.  The taste was fine, I may try without using a waterbath next time.
Taste was very good.

It would have been a delicious brownie if I'd added more salt.  The timing on this is really, really fussy. The temperature is really, really fussy. I've calibrated my oven, but something was clearly off, as my lava cakes cooked all the way through. They were still moist and edible, but totally lacking in the "lava" department.  Maybe the density of my porcelain ramekins was different than the density of the ones Chef John uses? There are a lot of variables here. I'm thinking that next time, I may try a 12-minute bake time and add water only 1/4 of the way up the ramekins. I think more direct heat might have helped.

Made this for an early weekend Valentine's dinner and they are every bit as sinfully delicious as you have heard.  So easy to make and the plates were licked clean.  No changes whatsoever and in my heart shaped ramekins, very pretty to present.  Thanks for the recipe!   Will definitely make again, and again....

Made this exastically to Chef John's receipt and there was No Lava! I was very disappointed as this was made for guests, the only saving grace was that I served it along side with coffee chocolate chip gelato.  I have compared this receipt to the one on Ghiradelli's chocolate baking bar and the two are quite different.  Next time I'll make the later one.

It didn’t turn out molten like lava cake should be. It was more bland, kind of like a dense soufflé. The taste was fine. The recipe needs to use cups instead of ounces for chocolate because it’s easier to use chocolate chips.

I found this site approx 7 years ago. This is my first review. I love this recipe. It takes a little time and a few more steps than a basic cake, but the payoff is so much better. If I ever want to wow people, this does it every time. Also if I am going to eat the calories anyway might as well make it the best.

Well, I hate to say it, but I was very disappointed Chef John. Far too bitter and no trace of sweet.  I  wasted almost the entire bar of chocolate and ended up with no chocolate dessert for my guests...bummer.  I hope, Chef, this will be the only time I am unhappy with your recipes.  I have used other ones and was pleased with the results.  Your videos are charming and enjoyable.  Keep it up.

the recipe was easy to follow, but I cooked it for 5 less minutes than it called for and it was still over done. Not a lava middle AT ALL! :'(

I gave this 5 stars. My kids and husband loved it. The only thing I modified  was the sugar. I used 2tbs instead of 3.  I will be making this dessert again.

Exactly to the recipe. Shared this with neighbors and they (and we) cannot get enough!  Perfect molten centers. Serve with the strawberries to help cut the richness of the chocolate.

I only had semi sweet chocolate  which was good but next time I will use dark.   I would only cook it for about 13 minutes though.   Mine were too done in the center.

I made no changes. The flavor is excellent, but no lava! It looked like a warm brownie (no harm in that!), but no "flow"! Still...a good dessert and I may make it again simply because it was quick and didn't require a whole lot of ingredients.

This was so good!!  I made it as written, but I had 7.5oz ramekins, so it made 3 instead of 4.  Also, instead of scooping it out of the dish & adding icing sugar, I left them in the ramekins & added a scoop of butter pecan ice cream.  Hubby said it was the best Chocolate Lava Cake he ever had!!

I cooked it the first time and I over cooked it. Let me tell you... It taste really bad if you over cook it.  I was really sad about my failure so I decided to make it again. It tasted so much better because I did not over cook it.

Made per directions and it looked undercooked at 15 minutes.  Put it back in for another 3 minutes worried that it might get overcooked.  The top had formed a crust but the bottom and sides were still completely liquid.

We didn't like this at all.  Followed the recipe to a T, but it came out dry and not very chocolatey.  Very disappointing; everyone ate the ice cream but not the cake.

My 11 yr old daughter made this (with my guidance).  We followed the recipe exactly- except after 15 -16 minutes in the oven, it looked like it hadn't cooked at all.  We put it back in for another 2-3 minutes.  That was our mistake!  It would've been helpful if the recipe included what it will look like in the ramekins after baking for 15 minutes, i.e., "that it will look uncooked, but that's what it's supposed to look like".  That would have saved us from overbaking.  It was still tasty!  Just no "lava".

Absolutely love this recipe! I mixed up the egg white and egg yolk for the first try, so the cake come out, its not runny inside and stiff after fridge. So I made sure to use egg yolks and changed to milk chocolate for the second try. Baked for 15 mins, the centre is not that runny but its very tender, just as i liked how it could be! And it tasted more sweeten with the milk chocolate. Just perfect! Making 4 is not enough! need more containers! lol

Yes, I made a couple adjustments to recipe. Doubled the sugar and flour,  added 1/4  tsp. orange zest. Everything else the same as original recipe.
The result was an amazing dessert...! Soooooo deliciously decadent. It has become my favorite dessert.

Mine were perfect. I've never made lava cakes of any sort before, but I substituted three eggs and 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder for the yolks. I thought it was delicious. You could add a little more sugar if you like it less dark. I also used semi-sweet baking chocolate.

I loved the dark chocolate color. I overcooked, so instead of flowing from the middle, it had a pudding-like texture, but the flavor was unbelievable!  I will remake, adjust the temp. and time...I have a Thermador and it runs a little too hot. Will reduce temp to 400° & bake 15 minutes instead of 18...

I made no changes to the recipe. It came out like dense cake rather than lava cake. It was excellent but I was disappointed with the missing lava. Will monitor more closely next time (and there WILL be a next time!)

I made this for the Valentine's Day special dinner for my hubby and my daughter. They both loved it! I reduced 1/4 of sugar and butter but still worked fine. I served them with strawberries, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. I'm sure they will request me to make this again soon!

I love chocolate and so I used a 72% Godiva chocolate bar. I made only 2 of these so I halved the recipe. I prefer a sweeter dessert. This was decadent but not as sweet as I would have liked. Extremely rich. I'm going to try it with semi sweet chocolate chips next time and see how that works instead. I think changing the chocolate would suit me better. Thicker batter than what I expected. Molten center. Probably would have been really good with ice cream to give it a little more sweetness. I will make this again and switch out the chocolate.

Total waste of butter and chocolate. These cakes were hard. I followed the recipe and even baked the cakes a few less minutes.  Very under impressed.

Amazing! My oven doesn't heat properly, so I'm kinda used to cakes/brownies either burning on the edges or not baking all the way to the centre - viola, the perfect recipe for my oven! I don't have any ramekins, so I just made it in a well greased muffin tin (sitting inside a high edged baking sheet with water inside). I did 5 "muffins" instead of 4 ramekins, so I reduced the baking time to just over 10 minutes. I actually forgot to put it in the fridge beforehand and it still turned out great - baked on the outside, but gooey on the inside!

These are really good, but the water bath isn't necessary. I have made Lava cakes dozens of times without it, and they have always turned out perfectly.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Made it to serve 60 but added another 30% to make the servings slightly larger. In my opinion reference should be made in the recipe to when it's done. Had it not been for some of the reviewers, I think I would have had a disaster.  Anyway, I refrigerated the batter overnight, and my, it does thicken up. I used an ice cream scoop to dish it out, which worked really well - forget the baggie.  They rose beautifully, like a souffle. Everyone was very impressed, served dusted with icing sugar, a sliced/fanned strawberry, and a dollop of whipped cream.

These were delicious. I expected them to rise a little (they are cakes, after all) and have a gooey, liquid-y center. Neither happened. However, the flavor was amazing. I used semi-sweet chocolate instead of dark chocolate (it was what I had on hand), and the cake had a nice, sweet, but not too sweet chocolate flavor. I would probably make this again.

My husband made this for us last night and it was wonderful.  It was fairly simple to do and turned out moist and delicious.  He made the recipe exactly as written with two exceptions: using semi sweet chocolate in place of dark, since that is what we had available, and baking it in an oversize muffin tin because we don't own ramekins.

Very good recipe, easy and fast to make and also not too sweet! Unfortunately after 12 min in the oven they were already fully baked :( but still very enjoyable!  I'll have to try those again with less time in the oven...

These turn out fantastic every time! I have NO IDEA what some other reviewers are doing to get brownies(?). Mine always have a liquid center and if I add a tad bit of cocoa powder into the ramekins after they’re buttered, the cakes slip right out without a hitch.

I'll admit I'm not much of a baker but I wanted to make something special for my husband and I and this looked like something fun to try.  These turned out great but I did over cook them a little bit.  They were still very good and stayed very moist so my husband didn't even notice I'd overdone them!  Thank you for adding all the tips into how to prepare, very helpful for a new baker like me.

No Lava!! Tasted ok, but even with taking it out a few minutes early we had no lava center. I think it must have to do with what size/shape of ramekin you bake it in. Mine might be wide and shallow compared to some 5 1/2 oz ramekins. I think the key is that the batter has more depth than width. The flavor was nice, rich, and chocolatey....just no lava which was disappointing.

Great recipe overall! At first I tried it exactly to the instructions and it actually didnt work well for me. The next time I tried it I made a few alterations: i used 400 degree oven, no water bath, and did not refrigerate. Turned out great. only cooked for 14 minutes and it was perfect!

I made these 2 nights ago.  I followed the recipe to a T.  I live in Northern Europe so I had no access to Ghirardelli chocolate, so we got a good quality dark chocolate to make these.  I have to say, our lava cakes made with 79% cacao dark chocolate were a tad too rich for my daughter.  She needed a lot of vanilla ice cream to have hers.  However, to my boyfriend and I these were maná from heaven, dark, rich, and barely sweet; a perfect accompaniment to the ice cream, in our case, Movenpick Vanilla.  So, keep this in mind if you do use very dark chocolate, as the recipe only calls for 3 tbs. of sugar to sweeten it up.  We loved them.

This recipe was amazing & I loved the video. I feel it really helped me get the consistency right (Especially with the egg mixture. Chef John, I do NOT have your arm strength. . . My hubby helped out though!) This was by far the best dessert I have ever made! 

I did put them into only two bigger rammekins so I had to add approx 10 more minutes to the bake time, but it was well worth the extra wait!

2nd attempt. Zero lava. Still really good flavor, but they did seem more like a brownie. I baked this batch for about 22 minutes. It's just really hard to see when they are done. The edges were bubbly. Don't know if it was the butter or if the boiling water (from the bath), but I was trying to wait for those bubbles to disappear.

Frustrated, I googled other recipes for lava cakes. Ingredients are all very similar to this recipe. But no water bath. No refrigerating before baking. In fact,the ones that offered you can refrigerate and bake the next day say to bring them to room temperature before baking. So, I am going to try again without the bath and without refrigerating before-hand.

1st attempt. The flavors were very good! I used Ghirardelli dark chocolate disks and Ghirardelli unsweetened cocoa. The only problem is it was underbaked. I had them in the oven for 19 minutes. The bottoms were all liquid. I will make them again (they're easy enough) and bake them 22 to 25 minutes and see what happens. But the guys still loved it!

Little disappointed.  The batter didn't seem to rise as it baked.  At 15min, the sides didn't seem to be set so I baked for another 5.  Came out like a brownie.  My ramekins were a bit bigger so may double recipe next time or use only two ramekins instead of four.

The first try came out like a professionally prepared dessert!  Can it be prepared ahead of time up to the step of baking I - still want to serve it warm & gooey.    Can it be baked in one large cake pan?

Just made this recipe but with a little twist: I added a hand full of chopped walnuts to the batter, it is absolutely wonderful, very simple to make and perfectly proportioned when you have a little sweet tooth.

Instead of 2 egg yolk I use one. Bake for 10mins n felt it's a little over.  Going to set at 8mins tomorrow.  Going to cut sugar. I forget to dust with icing. Otherwise would be perfect.

I followed this exactly....except I forgot to put in the refrigerator.  But it turned out like it should.  It was a very good recipe and easy to make.  For me I don't like the real strong chocolate taste.  Will it hurt if I only use 2 tsp. of cocoa and use some kind of milk chocolate instead of the dark chocolate?

Flavour was good, but the texture was poor and the cake didn't exhibit the crispy on the outside/pudding on the inside it's supposed to. There is too little batter even for 4 cakes - and they didn't rise at all.

Wonderful. I did not refrigerate the batter and did not cook it in a bath of water. I cooked it at 425 for about 12 minutes. I don't have ramekins so I used my clear pyrex custard cups. I put all four in a square 8X8 clear glass pyrex dish. They were perfect. Next time, I may cook them one or two more minutes. Very easy to make. I turned them over about a minute after I pulled them out.

The flavor was great but mine ended up being cooked all the way through. I guess I kept it in the oven for too long? I had never used a water bath before and it was very difficult for me. It worked for my chocolate fix but I think I'll be looking for a different lava cake recipe.

It was delicious, just wish it was a little more lava-y. I'll definitely make it again.

This was very yummy but it wasn't quite what I was looking for. This turned out more like a baked chocolate pudding. I wanted the middle to ooze out not just be gooey.

Very very good!  I let them cook a little too long, but I already bought the stuff to make them again soon :)

Amazing. Followed the instructions exactly and they came out piping hot and perfect. Sifted a little icing (confectioners) sugar over top and a dollop of vanilla ice cream on the side. A definite new family favorite. Thanks, Chef John!

To die for! These cakes are brain-dead to make and the centre is delicious pudding goodness. I was scared to overcook mine and end up with chocolate cake, and was much too excited to wait patiently, so I took them out a bit to early and the sides collapsed. They didn't look very pretty but tasted AMAZING! I know to be more patient next time. These cakes are well worth the wait!
PS: John is so funny! I can't stop watching his video, which makes me want these cakes all the time now!

Super simple to make and makes you look like a professional.  Don't be scared to take it out early.  I made the mistake the first time and took it out of the oven but left it in the hot water for too long and it cooked through.  This recipe is nice and rich and will satisfy any chocolate craving.  I heated up some more chocolate chips and drizzled it over the finished product.

I was sorta unorthodox with this.  I used Hershey's Dark Kisses.  They were fine.  I also don't see the need for the piping-with-a-baggie step; I just spooned it in.  I'm curious about the need for a water bath, though, and am going to skip it next time.  Some of the other reviews about this being overdone in certain ovens made me extra cautious, so I went with 14 minutes.  Mine were majorly "molten," so I'll stick with the high-end directions of 18 min. next time.  Never the less, everyone devoured them!  This is on the menu for Valentine's Day.

I'm rating this with 4 stars but mine actually burned a little but it might be my fault. I followed everything in the recipe -- the dough tasted awesome, and from my experience, if the dough of a cake tastes good, it means the cake will turn out to be good too. (That's why I'm giving 4 stars) The only thing I couldn't follow was putting the ramekins in a casserole dish&water. They stayed in the oven for exactly 15 minutes (in the heat recipe ordered), and the result was burnt-ish top, and no liquid chocolate inside. I think the heat needs to be lower than 425F in some ovens and/or the casserole dish part was more important than I thought. SO if you decide to bake this, follow EVERY instruction, and keep an eye on the oven so yours won't burn too.
