These are *wonderful* - I will stick with this recipe from now on! I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan, baking for about 35 minutes. I also topped the batter with butterscotch and white chocolate chips for a sweet surprise.

These are FANTASTIC!  Quite possibly the best brownies I've ever made!  I even cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and they were DIVINE.  They are wonderfully gooey, sweet and chocolately.  And MUCH lower in fat and calories than regular brownie recipes, but you'd never know!

Perfect for a late night chocolate craving and an urge to bake as they go into and out of the oven quickly. In my hurry, however, I didn't bother to read any of the reviews before I started and wish I had. I would have learned that other than using oil instead of butter, this is the same recipe as "Best Brownies," also from this site. (I happen to love that recipe!)  In that recipe, however, an 8x8" pan is used.  No wonder these turned out so thin, as others have noted! I used the 9x9" pan this recipe called for and while I was pleased with the brownie itself, which was moist, fudgey, with a bit of a crispy edge, I was disappointed in how thin they turned out. Unfortunately, that was a deal breaker for me as it made for a rather unimpressive looking brownie. Also, I found 18 minutes baking time perfect, so it's no wonder others found these dry if they were baking them for the recommended 20-25 minutes! Good brownie ingredients-wise, but somewhat flawed directions in terms of both pan size and baking time.

Mmmm!! Yes, these are the best brownies ever! I followed the recipe to a "t". I don;t understand why people change up the recipe and then blame the recipe contributor for the problems they end up with. These did make a very small pan, maybe enough for two hungry brownie lovers. I usually just stick to my favorite box from the grocery store that I discovered, but I do prefer these one more. I will be making them in the future. Thank-you for a great recipe!!

This is the recipe I've been using to bake brownies for well over a decade now, even before I attended culinary school!  I notice the latest reviewer complained about the gritty taste of the sugar in the product.  I suggest she try either butter or if she wants to cut out butterfat in her diet, use a 1/4 cup of butter and make the rest vegetable oil, or stick to all vegetable oil, but do the following anyway:  Microwave it for 1-2 minutes or until it melts(or oil is warmed).  Add the sugar to the warm/hot butter/oil, and this melts the sugar.  Better yet, try honey! I've also taken out as much as a half cup of sugar out of the recipe, and it works fine.  Microwaving or heating the oil causes the sugar to melt slightly, and if she uses a wire whisk to mix, it can also help to blend the butter, sugar and eggs together more smoothly.  Don't ever give up on a recipe after one try, because it's not a fair assessment of it.  Anything can cause a recipe to "fail" (the temps outside, the oven too hot/cool, not familiar with the recipe) in the first try.  I urge her to try again, and maybe try some of my tips.

O M G...These are by far the best brownies I have ever had in my short 38 years!!!! I, however, had no 9x9 pan. I used my glass 8x8 baking dish, added 1/4 cup milk chocolate chips mixed into batter, and did use another reviewer's suggestion of melted butter instead of vegetable oil. 
Also, since my pan was 8x8, I knew they would be a little thicker than the 9x9 would produce so I increased the baking time to 30 minutes exactly. OMG, I swear by this recipe and I've tried many homemade ones and ALL boxed versions. If you haven't tried this, do yourself a favor especially now around Valentine's Day....TRY THIS RECIPE!! Thank you thank you thank you to Sarah who gave us this DEELISH homemade brownie recipe! (My 4 yr old thanks you too!)

Everyone in my family loved these. I used the melted butter as suggested. The brownies were nice and fudgey and had a shiney crackled top.
They stayed moist for three days. Will make these again for sure. Can't wait to try different add ins. Thanx for the recipe.

Oh my!  I can't believe these came out as fudgey as they did!  I read the reviews and was a bit leary for fear I would have another cakey brownie on my hands.  I didn't change a thing and they came out so incredibly fudgey.  The only time I can get a brownie to be this fudgey moist is if I use 1 cup of butter...so this is much more economical to make without compromising flavor.  Great, Great recipe!!!  thanks so much.  If one likes an incredibly fudgey moist brownie, this is a great one.  I used a 9x6 ? pan.  I don't see why an 8x8 couldn't be used.  May just have to bake a few more minutes.

These were wonderful! Very very close to being as good as one of the better boxed mixes! I used an 8x8 pan, added 2 tbls of chocolate syrup and a handful of chocolate chips, used melted butter instead of the oil as some of the other reviewers had done. I ended up baking for almost 30 minutes. Do NOT over bake! Be sure to remove these when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with moist crumbs clinging to it, and  NOT getting to the point where the toothpick would come out completely clean. You will have a super fudgy, moist brownie. I wish it was a tad bit more chewy, but wouldn't mess with the recipe because it really is SO good and SUPER easy.  It is nice and chocolatey so I don't think I really needed to add the chocolate chips. Thanks for the recipe! YUM!

I have made these about 5 times in the last month, for different events, and everytime it's a huge hit! The last time I made them  they only lasted 2 hours. I live in South Africa so I don't use nut's (they're pretty expensive). But I do tripple the recipe and they come out as these huge, clumpy, chewy and crunchy and sooooo satisfying brownies. They are so easy to make too, I either add a half a cup extra of cocoa or 2 teaspoons of instant coffee, it gives it a deeper flavour, I also Tried it with coffee and cinnamon and decreased the cocoa a bit, it's a whole new recipe but also mmmmmmmmmm, GOOD!

Don't change anything! They're perfect. I didn't have walnuts, so I added chocolate chips. Best brownies I've ever had.

As a baker now for 6 years, I have used over 20 brownies recipes and this is the best recipe I have found! I will not go back to any other recipe! 
*If you try this recipe and the brownies turn out cake-like, it's because you mixed the eggs for too long...I only mix the eggs for 5 seconds flat. 
I have tried these brownies with PB swirled in the batter, chocolate chips, PB chips and walnuts. They are gone within a day at my house (My fiance eats like 3 in one night!)

I have avoided making brownies because I never made "perfect ones"...until now.  Doubled the recipe for a 9 x 13 pan, used the melted butter, baked for 30 minutes and cut the cooled brownies with a plastic knife.  Ha! I got this!

These were good. I used only 1/2 cup sugar and 1/3 cup oil and we thought they were sweet enough. I can't imagine 1 cup of sugar. Will try making them with butter the next time.

I have been making this recipe for years until last night I baked this at 160 Celcius degree for 25 minutes and it came out moist. Try it. At 170, I personally think it came out too dry.

This is my first review on this site.  I have never before felt a need to add my views.  

These brownies will work if you need a late night pick me up, or a quick baked good, but the flavor is lacking.  

I made this 3 times, once with olive oil(didn't like), once with butter(didn't like), and then I tried adding some mini morsels.  Even after all of that the texture and flavor just was not what I expect from a brownie.  

I used an 8x8 pan and I am very glad I did because they were very thin.  I did not add any additional time.  

They were not gooey, but more cake like.  All 3 times I had allowed my eggs to reach room temperature prior to using them.  

The other problem I had is they are very bland, and lack that rich chocolate flavor.  Even with the help of the chocolate chips I still did not get that gooey moist brownie flavor I love in a brownie.

I am at this point moving on because if I modify this further I might as well write a new recipe myself.

These are spectacular. I am very picky about my brownies and can't stand it when they come out cake-like. This is the first recipe I've found that was actually gooey like from a box. 

I'm keeping this as my standard brownie recipie

Great taste. Used melted butter. Baked in 8x8 pyrex for 27 minutes. Mine turned out light almost cake-ish. Very simple to make. Will use instead of store box. On a side note: Not everyone knows where their recipe originated from. Lighten up and thanks for sharing.

I doubled the recipe for 13x9 pan & baked for about 35 minutes.  They are a fudgy brownie (so not a thick brownie) and even better with chocolate frosting sprinkled with a few chopped pecans.  My husband loved them so it's a keeper.

I had the urge to bake late at night but didn't have the drive to get out of my PJs, bundle up, and go to the store for ingredients! With limited ingredients, I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. I was hesitant to make brownies since so many brownie recipes I have tried turned out cake-like, spongey and light... I wanted a recipe for dense gooey brownies and this is it! I followed the recipe exactly and I LOVE it. I used an 8x8 pan and baked for 27 minutes total. Just as good as any from a mix! I will remember this one for sure!

I always bake my brownies in a muffin pan to avoid having to cut and serve..... it is so easy that way just hem closely as I havent timed it to see exactly how long they take. Just make sure you spray the pan with baking spray and they will come out perfect without even using paper cups.

These are great but sometimes the do not turn out. I don't know what I am doing wrong. I use melted butter rather than oil and sometimes they crust over on top and then do not cook underneath. Any ideas of what I am doing wrong?

My children are lactose intolerant and this is by far the best dairy free brownie - or home made brownie for that matter - that I've come across.  We followed the recipe to a T and it was delicious! Update: We have since found out that we have kids with soy allergies as well, so we switched out the veggie oil for coconut oil and - OH MY GOSH!  The flavor is AMAZING with coconut oil in it.  You MUST try it with coconut oil.

I didn't think anything could be better than Ghirardelli box brownies, but these really are so much better! My boyfriend was impressed. Took the advice of other reviewers and subbed melted butter for the oil and that made them taste extra rich. Also added a handful of choco chips. There's another recipe on here, "Best Brownies", that is identical to this one except it has frosting - based on how these taste, I'd say frosting would be gilding the lily. These brownies come out rich, chocolately, and chewy, and the only thing I would change next time is to make a double batch! Thanks, Sarah, for a great recipe I'll make again and again.

These were good and better the next day.  I added a handful of bittersweet chocolate chips to the mixture and a handful of caramel chips.  I also used melted butter instead of oil and added extra vanilla.  They did turn out a bit thin in the 9x9 pan so if you like your brownies thicker, use a 8x8.  I'll probably make again and either double the recipe for thicker brownies or use the smaller dish as we prefer them a bit thicker and add nuts next time as I had to leave them out of this batch because my husband's son can't eat them.

This recipe just didn't turn out good for me.  I tried it twice thinking that I might have screwed up on something the first time, but I'm sure it's not me!  The brownies has a texture like it just doesn't seem cooked as long as I bake it for.  It's not just moist, it's kind of also gooey.  Maybe I am doing something wrong and someone can help me out.  I must say the brownies were sweet, but there just wasn't enough chocolate taste that I wanted to taste.  A pan of brownies usually goes out in a day in my family, but no one wanted to touch these at all!

I bake a lot and I am always looking for a good brownie recipe from scratch, but this one is not the one I was looking for. This recipe was good for the texture, not good for the amount of chocolate flavor. I still think the boxed kind are fudgier and more flavorful. I think it needs more of a fudgy, chocolate flavor than it has. The texture is five stars however- its rich and chewy. Because of the flavor, however, I'll either try to improve, or move on to a different recipe.

I love these brownies...esp. when I run out of butter and it is 9:30 at night and I can't fight that late night chocolate craving. Perfect chocolate taste...this time extra chocolate chips are going in. YUMMMM!

These were delicious! I did throw in milk chocolate chips. I didn't have an 8x8 pan so I used my Pyrex dish. Baked for 26 minutes, it came out really good. Only problem I had was that it stuck to the dish, but I can't knock down a star because of that :). These went well with ice cream. Yum!

really good when they're fresh from the oven, but they become very dry and crumbly with each hour that they cool.  The second day they're almost impossible to serve in a whole piece, however, crumbled and reheated in the microwave they gain back a lot of flavor.

I made these on the spur of the moment and they were great. Takes no time at all to mix everything together (with ingredients I always have on hand - I left out the nuts), and they are very moist and chocolatey. I used olive oil, so they were healthier than ones made with butter, too.

Pretty darn good and really easy! I used 1/2 cup of cocoa to give it a more chocolaty flavor. I think I'll use a little less next time though. :> I also made these into muffins instead of regular brownies. That way each one get's a nice crispy crust all around.

This is a Great Recipe! The use of only oil in the recipe makes it healthier than your average Buttery Brownies -- but tastes just as Great! You don't even miss it! I used butter to grease the pan, and Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting. Yum Yum!

These are AWESOME!  I agree with the 18 minute recommended baking time for a 9x9 pan; and yes, the brownies will be a bit thin.  But they're great for those of us watching their weight - with the simple substitution of 1/2 cup Egg Beaters in place of the eggs, they come in at under 100 calories each if cut into 16 pieces.  And they're so rich, fudgy, and moist, you'd never know!  MANY thanks!!!

Will never waste money on a box mix again!  So easy and rich and gooey-like a brownie should be-if you want a cake brownie, this is not for you!  I used 1 stick butter and baked in an 8x8 stoneware, took about 22 min to set in middle.  My new go-to brownie recipe!  Can't wait till I can get to penzey's and get some higher fat cocoa to make even richer and maybe add some ghiradelli chips!

I thought that I had tried all of the highly rated brownie recipes on this site, but found that I hadn't yet tried this one.  Made this for a Fourth of July party, topped with brownie frosting and patriotic sprinkles.  Someone described these as happiness in your mouth.  These are fabulous, rich, chocolatey brownies.  Don't overbake, let them set up, refrigerate before cutting for easy removal, and you will have the perfect brownie.

These were very good. I like them a little on the chewy side with that thin dry crackly top. I say they were very good as they only lasted a few hours. I think I got half a piece. In a 9 x 9" pan they are not tall, making them a nice small dessert. Stay close to the oven in the last few minutes as they can quickly become overdone. Using cocoa powder, rather than melted chocolate makes them less expensive to put together without compromising flavour. I'll be making them again soon.

I read a review where someone used Splenda instead of sugar. So I tried it. This is not because we are diabetic, but because I wanted to cut back on sugar. They turned out like eating sponges. I didn't rate this because in the future I will try this recipe again with sugar. I even added chocolate and peanut butter chips to offset the use of Splenda. Not even the chips helped. I would just like to say that if anyone wants to make these, use real sugar. When I try this recipe again, I will rate it and write another review.

Very very good! First time I ever used a recipe for brownies from scratch and I believe I will stick to this one! I used the oil and they came out great! I topped with powdered sugar. I think this recipe could be so versatile too- add walnuts, chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, make it turtle with carmel! Can't wait to try them all!

these are amazing!!! I also substituted apple sauce for the oil to make them more low fat and they were just a yummy as the regular recipe. I dont cook them in an 8x8 or 9x9 but a muffin pan, this makes them the perfect size and thickness! The 3rd time I made them I added in miniature peanut butter cups, they were gone in less than a day!

These are WONDERFUL! I use this recipe from now on. The only thing I change is instead of using a 9x9 pan I used an 8x8 and cooked it for 10 minutes longer. This way they aren't flat, they are thick, moist, and DELICIOUS!

I was so confused as to which brownie recipe to go with when a Buzzer recommended this one (thanks, Baker Bee).   I got so many compliments on them!  They were very moist and fudgy.  I will definitely use this recipe again!  I used the frosting from Best Brownies by Angie, adding instant coffee and cinnamon to make a mocha frosting.  After I cut them, I put them in muffin cups and placed on a plate with parchment separating the two layers of brownies.  I figured it would keep the frosting on the brownies and it worked great.

If there were more stars, I would give it because five stars doeesn't do this recipe justice.  These are the BEST brownies I've eaten.  I've tried other home made recipes but they were just to much work or didn't compare to the box mixes.  But this recipe is easy to make and tastes better than box mixes.  I followed the recipe exactly but I didn't have a 9 by 9 pan so I used an 8 by 8 and just kept my eyes on them to pull them out of the oven when they were done.  These will be the only ones I'll be making from now on.

These are very moist, tasty brownies.  Instead of using oil, I used 1/4 cup of melted butter, and then 1/4 cup of pumpkin puree. No one noticed, because the butter gave the brownies a richer flavor. I skipped the nuts (they were for my little brother's birthday...he requested chocolate brownies with no nuts, just chocolate chips!) and added 1/3 cup of mini chocolate chips instead. The only problem I had with this is that I made it in the specified 9x9" square pan, and they were too thin. I will use an 8x8" pan next time I make these. My brother wanted frosting, so I used half a recipe of Texas Chocolate Frosting (from this site) on these and it was perfect. Thanks for sharing...these are great!!!

I made these and 'MMMMM... Brownies' from this site so I could compare the two - personally, I liked the other ones much better. These were less moist, and not very flavorful. If you like chewy brownies then you will probably like this recipe, but I preferred the moister ones. My dad preferred this recipe so it's worth a shot. I would recommend adding chocolate chips, though, for more chocolatey flavor. :)

My step-daughter made this recipe because she said the one I had had was too rich. The recipe is identical except this one uses oil rather than butter. I thought they were not quite as good, but then again I am a butter fanatic! She thought they tasted like the ones from the box.

It did not turn out at all.  The oil boiled the rest of the indgredients, but it did not cook together.  There was oil on top, oil on the sides, oil inside.

Yummy! I made as stated, with melted butter. Good chocolatey flavor. Mine turned out kind of flat, with tiny holes all over the top? Did not add chips or frosting. Dusted the top with a little powdered sugar. Quick and delicious! Cured my craving.

These brownies are fantastic! I used the melted butter substitution to make them extra rich and moist.  These were by far the most delicious homemade brownies I've ever made.  They also take less than 10 minutes of prep, never using a box mix again! Highly recommended!

Amazing brownies! I am a thirteen year old who loves to bake and this definitely provides a good simple recipe that produces divine brownies! However, I would recommend leaving them in the oven for about 30 min, they are too soft and become crumbly when you take them out of the pan. (This is if you use a larger oven. If you use the toaster oven, 20- 25 minutes is fine.) All in all, good recipe!

I've made these with butter and they are pretty good. I wanted to see if I could try to make a lower calorie version so I used 4tbs of Smart Balance butter and 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce, 1/2 cup of Splenda, 1 whole egg and one egg white, and I added 2 extra tbs of cocoa. Used an 8x8 pan. Not bad. Very moist. Definitely tastes like a low cal brownie but satisfies the chocolate craving if your watching calories.

If you're looking for a rich, chocolatey, melt in your mouth type brownies, these are not it. This recipe is just ok, not fabulous. I'm not quite sure why it has such high reviews. I tried this recipe twice before revewing and folowed it exactly as listed. The first time I used melted butter as recommended, the second time I used the oil in the original recipe. Both times I found the brownies to be more sticky and sweet with a sugary, oily aftertaste rather than rich and chocolately, which is how I prefer them. Brownies aren't very hard to make and there aren't many ingredients so I have a hard time giving a 5 star rating for a simple overly sweet recipe when to me it tasted exactly like something I could have gotten out of a box and spent half the time preparing. I think a recipe with more chocolate and less sugar and one which allows for a thicker, richer, more chocolatey outcome is what I was looking for.

An ok recipe if you have a chocolate craving and minimal ingredients on-hand. You can get your chocolate fix for cheap as most kitchens would have these ingredients without a run to the grocery. Not a chewy, rich chocolatey type of brownie, and it doesn't make much batter so the brownies will be pretty thin. They are cakelike in texture and almost tastes watered-down. I can't imagine the rave reviewers have tried other homemade brownie recipes. I still find the brownie recipe from the Fannie Farmer cookbook to be the best I've ever made.

This was a decent recipe. I didn't have the butter available to substitute like a lot of people recommended, but it still turned out fine. I feel like the butter would have made the difference between a good recipe and a fantastic recipe. I did add chopped chocolate bits, and that was fairly good. In addition, I only had an 8x8 pyrex dish. I simply added 10 minutes and made sure to butter it before putting in the mix.  Great recipe!

I've made homemade brownies with butter many times, but I prefer this recipe made with oil better.  These were great, made no changes.

I followed this recipe exactly and we really loved them, they plumped up were great thick texture and cooked in about 30 minutes at the 350 temperature..
I also added peanut butter to the second batch and they also were delicious.

I am not sure about some of the bad reviews.. perhaps you didn't follow the recipe exactly the way it is spelled out, or perhaps your altitude is different or perhaps you can't bake.. but I loved these brownies

Very good - I've probably made these twenty times and they are crowd-pleasers for sure.  I add 1/8 teaspoon of finely-ground pepper and about 1 teaspoon of instant coffee crystals (rehydrated with a splash of water).  This brings the recipe into spectacular territory.  I also like using peanut oil instead of butter because this spares the brownies from being too rich.

I prefer the Brooke's Best Brownie's recipe, but this recipe is also amazing.  I made these instead because I didn't have any butter.  Nice and fudgy.  I wish they were a little more chocolatey, I will probably up the cocoa to 1/2 cup next time.

This is a great basic brownie recipe, nothing fancy.  Sometimes you just need a pan of brownies in short order, and you don't happen to have any unusual ingredients on hand: this is your recipe!  I stirred 1/2 cup of chocolate chips into the batter because I had them taking up space in my cupboard. I will be making these over and over again!

i had a recipe for brownies when i was still 10 years old which my mom and I had been using. But my mom lost the recipe and I kept on asking her to try to remember the recipe but she can't. So I always search for brownie recipes wherein the ingredients are easy to find and quite affordable. When I came across this recipe, I was eager to try this specially that it called for vegetable oil instead of the commonly used butter or margarine. I tried this last night and tasted the baked brownie a day after. It really tasted good. The top was so fudgy and the taste is just right. Not like the one i tried before where there was too much butter and sugar which resulted in a very strongly flavored brownie. 
THIS RECIPE IS FOR KEEPS & I WILL SURELY USE THIS NEXT TIME.

A new family favorite! My daughter and husband think that these taste like the chocolate ganache at our favorite Italian restaurant. I made these twice with no substitutions.

This recipe was very good:) At first I thought there wasn't enough batter for 9" pan.  However, The brownies rise somewhat.  Next time I will use a 8" baking pan as I prefer my brownies thicker.  Also, I used Hershey's brand of coca powder and added about 1/2 cup of peanut butter baking chips to the mixture! The taste was wonderful.

These brownies are fantastic!  I did make them with melted butter instead of oil because I wanted the extra richness.  That definitely did it!  I have to agree with some other reviewers that said they were too greasy.  I'll probably skip greasing the pan next time.  However, once cooled, I placed a plate on top of the pan and turned the brownies out, upside down.  I then covered the now exposed bottom with 2 paper towels and carefully flipped them back over.  The paper towels soaked upmall the extra grease and then they were TO DIE FOR!  Wonderful!

OMG!!  These are the best brownies!!  Before now, I have thought that the best recipe was from either my "Aunt Betty" or "Uncle Duncan", but these are just as good, and healthier because I recognize all of the ingredients!  Made exactly like the recipe, but with butter and added 1/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (no nuts).  I used very good cocoa.  Out of this world!  Tips:  grease pan VERY well.  DO NOT OVERMIX (just like the ones in the box).  Let cool completely and cut with a plastic knife (works every time).  I cooked them about 22 1/2 minutes--take out when they are a bit crisp around the edges, but not pulling completely away.  (the toothpick test does NOT work on brownies).  They will be perfect!

Super!  I make it 24 serves to fit my pan, and I up cocoa so that its 1/2 the sugar amount...  Quite a sweet brownie but delicious!  25min at 170C and it was perfectly chewy.
I have used 1/4 c melted butter and topped with oil till the right amount and thats worked well too :)

These brownies were average, not the best. It was all to burnt on the sides and a bit to oily. I really did not enjoy them, but because only one of my friends liked them, I'm giving it 2 stars. I would have given it 1 only. Disappointed :(

I doubled the recipe when I made these, and used 3 eggs instead of4 to makee it more chewy. I also changed it up by substituting special dark cocoa, in the place of regular cocoa powder with just a touch more vanilla than the double recipe called for. I MUST SAY, they are to die for. Absolutely amazing! The best I have EVER had!

Finally found a really great brownie!  And all the ingredients I normally have on hand is a bonus.  Two teenagers tried them and rated them a TEN star!  I did use butter not oil.  Only had a 8x8 pan and it took almost 30 minutes to bake.  Will be making these often!  UPDATE:  Added 2 Tablespoons chocolate syrup and sprinkled with 1/3 cup semi-sweet chips and it was wonderful!

I made a half batch last night using oil, omitting walnut and adding a handful or so of chocolate chips. We loved these brownies but I think part of it was I added some chocolate chips to the batter before baking. The brownies were fudgy in the middle and chewy on the edges, just the way my family likes them. They aren't as sweet and chocolatey as box mix so I added the chocolate chips to replicate the box kind my husband loves.  Since they don't have trans fat or dairy in them, I am over the moon about them and will definitely make them again.

These are GREAT brownies!  I used melted butter instead of the vegetable oil and they turned out soooo delicious.  The whole family loved them (and that doesn't happen often in our family of 5!) and they were really simple to make.  Loved them with the added walnuts.  Thanks so much Sarah

These are the best brownies!  I do not like boxed brownie mix as they are too sweet in my opinion.  This had the perfect balance of sweetness.  It has that homemade brownie-cake texture I really like.  I also liked the fact that the recipe was made with ingredients I always have on hand.  I chose to use the butter which was an option for the recipe instead of the oil. Thanks for the go to recipe for brownies!

Just made them now - delicious!  I took others advise and used 1/4 cup butter and the rest Canola oil, used only 1/2 cup sugar and they turned out really good.  Will make them again for sure.

I didn't care for these but hubby did. I used the melted butter suggestion, cut back on sugar by 1/2C . For me, they were too dry. I'll try again using 1/2 the butter and use some applesauce as well to moisten em' up.

Yes, these are the best.  Same recipe as Hershey's "Best Brownies" and I've been making them for years.  I use margarine and be sure not to overbake them so they will be nice and chewy.

Not impressed, I followed this recipe to a T. I even came back and double checked. They bombed, the middle was too gooey, like pudding, it created a chocolate puddle on my dish. I will stick to brownies from a box.

Great recipe. Works perfectly, and the 'optional' walnuts REALLY make it what it is. Easy to make, too. Delicious brownies. I used Olive oil. Very good recipe.

These were just ok.  Much better the next day as someone else stated.  I used butter instead of oil and baked in an 8x8 ban.   Probably wouldn't use recipe again...needs more chocolate or something.

I made these first with oil and then with butter. Definitely liked them better with butter (actually Smart Balance buttery spread)! They turned out nice and chewy! Both times I increased the cocoa to 7T, used all brown sugar and omitted the salt and walnuts.

I followed this recipe to the T and I can say that this is a keeper. I didnt really like it on the first day but wait till u try it the next day and it gets even better. My husband ate it on the 2nd day and he really liked it, my colleagues too. I used olive oil and 1 teaspn baking powder. I posted photo for this recipe. ;)

Went with the suggestion to melt the butter instead of using the oil and added 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips.  YUM!  Chewy, rich brownie!  Have also made with vegetable oil and are just as good!  Cheaper than using butter, too!  So easy!  Forget the boxed brownies!

Perfect.  Flawless.  Superb.  The only change I made was to use 1/2 cup of melted butter instead of vegetable oil.  This recipe is what I imagine when I think of brownies.

These brownies were pretty good. I doubled the recipe & because of all of the butter vs. oil comments, I decided to use half butter & half oil. These were a little too sweet & a little less fudgy than I like. Next time I will use less sugar & add some more cocoa powder. Would definitely make again though.

This is the only recipe I use for brownies. I don't like using butter on my cakes or brownies and love a crispy crust yet a fudge-y center. This does the trick. Never as perfect as the actual butter brownie but very close. The children here LOVES them! I personally add swirls of peanut butter straight out of the jar. I am sure you could mix the peanut butter with some butter so it won't separate your brownie when cooked like you see on my picture but we don't care. Another thing I add is a tsp of instant coffee. - I got that idea from Ina Garten. :D So hands down people, best brownie made with oil recipe! And super easy! :D

Made these the other day and YES, these are mmm-mmm better (BEST) brownies!  It was so easy to make them and they are simply scrumptious.  I did not use a mixer, I simply stirred the ingredients. I used melted butter rather than vegetable oil and did not add nuts. I made them in an 8x8 pan and cut them into small squares.  I wouldn't change anything. Interestingly, this recipe is the same as Absolutely Best Brownies (from this site) if you use regular flour rather than self-rising (as submitter suggests if you want less cake-like brownies). Then today I saw a recipe called Best Brownies (again, AR), also identical recipe.  That one includes directions for frosting. I might use frosting but honestly does not need it. Proof they're truly the best brownies -- everyone everywhere is submitting the recipe and getting 5 stars all over the place.  You won't be disappointed in this recipe!  Thanks for submitting.

Love this recipe. I can't stand when people change a recipe and then rate it but I used butter instead of veg oil because I was out of the oil. I hid in the kitchen and licked the batter bowl clean before the kids found out

I needed a brownie recipe that used oil and cocoa, and this was the one I picked.  Glad I did-they are so moist but don't fall apart too easily.  I made them into mini muffins, using tiny liners to take as a part of a Valentine's Gift for my grandson's teachers at his preschool.  They looked wonderful on the tray with everything else.  You know, you always have to have chocolate on a gift tray!

These were the best brownies I have ever had.  I also think it is a good idea to use the best chocolate you can afford.  I tried this recipe becuase I had found some really excellent dutch unsweetened cocoa powder in a specialty shop and I was looking for a good recipe.  It was easy, fast and delicious!  I loved it and I will never go back to box brownies again.

I feel sad to give one star especially since other people left rave reviews. But mine came out tasting like a chocolate bread. I reread the recipe and it seems I did everything exactly as instructed so I am not sure what went wrong. I did not over cook at all. In fact, if I think of the dish as a big muffin or chocolate bread and add a little butter with each serving, it is pretty good. But a brownie, mine is not. :-( 
Maybe I will try again and moisten the recipe.

Best brownies I have ever had, hands down.  I wouldn't recommend altering the recipe in any way -- I tried a version with half the sugar and the texture was really affected.  Most of the gooeyness was gone, and the taste wasn't nearly as good either.

I made these tonight, and they are delicious.  I had a brownie recipe that I had used for years, and misplaced it and could never find anything close until now.  Made exactly as written.

i added chocolate chips (minis) into this recipe instead of nuts. i think it made them even better and my family agrees, since we all love chocolate. These are easy to make( im 13 and i made these ) and make very few dishes. i really recommemend these brownies.

Great basic recipe. You can add chocolate chips or syrup.  I doubled it and used a 9x13 pan.

Tasty. followed the recipe but used a ceramic baking dish. Made 2 batches. 1 definitely came out better than the other. Overmixed the egg mixture in the first and they came out cake like. The second batch was not mixed as much and it came out more brownie like. they tend to disintegrate a bit. Wish they had been a bit more chewy, gooey and chocolatey. Still very good.

I have to agree that this is a perfect recipe. I also doubled the recipe, used 9x13 pan, used melted butter instead of oil, and added semi-sweet Guittard chips.  Cooked for about 35 mins. Excellent!  I was skeptical. I've tried lots of others. I'm sticking with this one. Thank you for sharing!

Awesome using gluten free flour too!!  Used Tom Sawyer flour (totally gluten free) and followed the recipe otherwise perfectly!  They were awesome!!  Even my husband gobbled them up and said he could hardly tell they were gluten free!

I love this recipe.  The brownie perfectly balances cake and fudge.  The texture is similar to dense chocolate cake.  The brownie is not immediately fudge-like, yet it tastes like buttery fudge.  (Note: this recipe does not turn to fudge like other "brownie" recipes.)  
I make this recipe with melted butter, not oil.  I also add 1 Tablespoon of strong coffee.  Delicious!

Wow... I swapped the oil for butter as recommended and doubled up on everything. Instead of walnuts, I did milk chocolate chips (which I usually don't like in my brownies).... Poured myself a glass of milk and dug in. IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!

I really don't know how this recipe received so many high ratings...extremely bland and not rich and chewy like a brownie should be.  Please if you are going to make these brownies use an 8x8 pan as this batter barely covers a 9x9 pan and use butter instead of oil.

This is almost similar to the recipe of Best Brownies, also found here at Allrecipes. The only difference is that this uses veg oil instead of melted butter. I personally like the melted butter version, but this is also a winner! :)

I have made this recipe twice.  Once with oil and once with 1/2 cup butter.  The ones made with butter were phenomenal.  The ones made with oil were just okay.  Use butter, and you will love your brownies.  I also used an 8x8 pan so that they wouldn't be so flat.

These are delicious!  I'm mad at myself for stumbling upon such an easy recipe for brownies.  Now I can't stop making or eating them!!  I did change 1 thing the second time I made them, I only used 1 egg b/c I wanted a less cake-like brownie and they turned out perfect.  A handful of chocolate chips thrown in also makes them even more delectable.  Thanks for such a wonderful, easy recipe!!

dry (but not overcooked), cakey not chewy at all..and fairly flavorless. Not nearly as chocolatey as a brownie should be.

I added fried bacon bits, fresh of course, to the mix, cooked up 10 pieces of center cut, adding brown sugar while frying. Mixed into the batter as the last step. Big Hit!

I adore brownies - they are my weakness. I love the Betty Crocker Fudge Brownie mix for an easy brownie fix and this recipe looked to me like it would be a similar homemade version. I have also made many versions of homemade brownies, but this recipe has to be the one I liked the very least. No rich, chocolaty flavor. Will not be making again.

Excellent recipe, I had just taken them out of the oven, and set them out to cool, as soon as my family saw them they ate every single one! And they were still piping hot!

I don't eat the brownies (I don't eat chocolate), but I make them for my family. I almost followed the recipe exactly, but I added a couple of ingredients. My husband adored these brownies - he even told me they were better than his mom's, but I actually added milk and semi-sweet chocolate morsels and that gave them the chocolaty flavor that they needed. I also tripled the recipe and baked them in a 9x13 pan for about 40 minutes. Everyone who tasted them loved them.

If using 1/2 C. splenda and 1/2 C. sugar -  only bake in 8 x 8 glass pan for 25 minutes at 350 degrees.  If using 1 C. sugar bake for 30 minutes. I made them for a friend's birthday 'treat' and they turned out fantastic !!  THIS ONE'S A KEEPER FOR SURE !!!

Fabulous recipe!! I substituted butter for oil and used evaporated cane juice rather than white sugar.  I also used unbleached flour to help cut down on the processed ingredients.  I am going to make another batch using vegan butter and adding some ground flax for omega 3's...:)

These brownies are lovely! Best recipe that I have used! I doubled the recipe and omitted walnuts and baked in a 9x13 pan and they are delicious. I have made this recipe about 5 times now and each time they are amazing. No more box brownies around here.

This recipe is a good alternative for people with dairy allergies since it calls for oil instead of butter. However, I prefer brownies made with more cocoa; they were light in color and not as fudgy as the brownies that I'm used to.

I don't want to upset anyone, but, if this recipe didn't turn out....it's on you, not the recipe! I have NEVER been able to get a brownie recipe to turn out. They were either to cakey or a hot pudding mess! I double this recipe, added 1/2 cup of ch. chips and used butter instead of oil (omitted the salt since the butter was salted) and no nuts. Still only cooked for 20 minutes and they were perfect! Crispy top and edges and fudgy middle......lasted half the day! Absolute perfection! Thank you!

Awesome! :) I made these for my hubby for Valentine's Day, and he loved them. Instead of walnuts, I put in Heath bar bits, which turned out really well.

We made these in China (where butter is scarce)! Used two mashed bananas instead of 1/2 c oil and dark brown sugar instead of white. 1/4 c oat and 1/4 c all-purpose flour. Added 150 g chopped dark chocolate. They were delicious!

Honestly, not the best brownies I've ever had. The sugar/chocolate consistency wasn't the best. I followed the directions and didn't seem to find the end product to be what I expected.

Yay! I'm so happy this uses oil instead of butter. My sister and I were having a late night brownie craving so I just halved the recipe and made it in a small loaf pan. I also mixed up some cream cheese with a bit of powdered sugar and milk and swirled that into the top! Soooo good!

I made these brownies right after I got the recipe. They were easy to make and oh so good and scrumptious. Chocolate lovers will love these. They are the best brownies I have made. Excellent!

As the primary photo shows, this recipe results in a flaky thin crust. I had been searching for a recipe that was similar to the box varieties available in grocery store (minus those heart damaging trans fats). This recipe bares a striking resemblance to those recipes, so I can indulge in brownies without the partially hydrogenated oils. ;o) I doubled the patch in a 8'' by 8'' pan, baked for 35 minutes (which is a bit undercooked). The result was about 3'' tall, moist, fudgy, and, most importantly, yummy!

Wow!  These are great!  I made these for thanksgiving dinner and there were no complaints.  They are so rich and chocolatey.  Also they are wonderfully easy.  I'm just a beginning baker and I still made them turn out great.  Before I put them in the oven, I mixed in some unmelted chocolate chips for a chocolate chip brownie.  After they were done I covered them in powdered sugar.  Thank you for a great recipe!

So, I have just recently started baking (you have to be so precise) and decided to try this recipe.  This is the best brownie (aside from my mom's) that I have ever tasted.  I made a double batch, so I used applesauce, whole wheat flour and choc. chips.  I also used grape seed oil, instead of veg oil (I never buy that stuff); mixed all together and put in a 9x13 pan lined with parchment paper and lightly sprayed the bottom; baked for approx 25 min, turned off oven and let sit for another 5-10 minutes.  These surprised me by coming out fantastic, since I don't usually bake (I have a chef's stove and do great at just cooking, you don't have to measure).  I would highly recommend these.

I echo the reviewer below who points out that this is the exact same recipe as "Best Brownies" except that Best Brownies has a frosting recipe that also rocks, and calls for butter instead of oil.  I think I prefer the oil but will add the frosting.

I always wondered what "from-scratch" brownies would taste like, and since making these I've decided there's no reason to go back to boxed mixes! What I love about this recipe is that it is cocoa-powder-based instead of melted-chocolate-based, so if you don't have a huge amount of chocolate chips on hand, you can still throw together some brownies. The recipe turns out great as-is, but I like to make a few small modifications to make it even better. I usually add about 1/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips to the batter, which enhances the dark chocolate flavor - getting little pieces of chocolate in your brownie definitely heightens the YUM factor. I usually substitute light brown sugar for half of the white sugar. I've also added about 1/3 cup walnuts, substituted half of the oil with applesauce, substituted the oil with melted butter, and added instant espresso powder - it always turns out nicely. Give this recipe a try, and you can impress people by claiming that you even make *brownies* from scratch! :)

I did not care for these brownies.  I followed the recipe exactly and the batter looked (and tasted) very promising.  The cooked product was very greasy, thin and brittle and once cool was somewhat hard and crumbly.  The taste was not sweet or chocolatey enough.  I'm not picky about the brownies but I won't eat the rest of these.

Very simple, requiring no mixer or pan.  I follow a suggestion from someone who suggested using 1/2 pumpkin and 1/2 melted butter for the oil, and it was great.  Next time I will try whole wheat flour and maybe 1/2 Splenda.

These brownies just came out of the oven and they are excellent. Way better than boxed. I like to make homeade recipes like this one so I know what ingredients I'm giving my family. I doubled the batch and I even added milled flax seed so that way a sweet treat can also be packed with omega-3. Thanks for this recipe

These are ridiculously good! I ended up making them twice in a week and a half! I had all the ingredients on hand so they were really easy, too. I brought some with to class and everyone loved them. Thanks!

I had my doubts when I read some of the reviews that said it wasn't very chocolatey and that it was cake like...but I don't know what they were talking about because it was awesome! It's so rare to find baking recipes that don't use shortening, butter, or margarine...and oil is soo much cheaper and easier to use! Love it.

These were OHMYGOSH good. I made them in a fit of chocolate dependency, and am not even ashamed to say that I ate the entire pan, by myself, in 2 days. These brownies are moist and have great chocolate flavor, and they're SUPER easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly. Believe me, these are going down in the "tried-and-true-" book in black ink!!!

This recipe was perfect!! I reduced the sugar down to 3/4 C because my family likes brownies not too sweet. I think this will be my default brownie recipe from now on. Thank you so much!

I threw calorie/fat caution to the wind and made these for my family! The only thing I did as some suggested is "double" the recipe. They turned out moist inside with a nice crunchy top... delish! I am saying Goodbye to box mixes after this one!

These turned out great. I used less cocoa than the recipe called for. I used 1/4 c. but I think that was still a little too much so I'm going to use 3 T. next time. I baked these in a foil lined 8" baking pan that had been sprayed with non stick cooking spray. They'd be too thin baked in a 9" pan. I baked them on 375° in a toaster oven for exactly 17 minutes. :-)

These were SO good! I made a batch for a party a couple of days ago. The only things I changed was that I doubled the recipe and added semi-sweet chips instead of walnuts (used vegetable oil from the original recipe). Since it was doubled, I put it in a 9x13 pan and baked for 35 mins like a reviewer suggested. The brownies were devoured within the hour! Everyone kept commenting on how wonderful they were! Thanks Sarah!

This is the best "from scratch" brownie recipe I've ever made. They were perfectly moist, and just the right richness. The only time I've ever been able to get brownies this good is when I make them from a box mix! I'll definitely be using this recipe again and again.

I followed the recipe exactly to give it an appropriate review, as apposed to those who change it then blame the original poster of the recipe.  This is FANTASTIC!  It's got a crunchy top, nice thick cake like bottom and the center is soft and fudge like.  It's really perfect, only thing I would change is upping the coca powder to 1/2 c over 1/3 c for a richer chocolate flavor, and that is just preference, this recipe is perfect as is!  I have already emailed it to friends and family who are chocolate lovers as well.

I had been making another brownie recipe on AR for over 6 months but wasn't completely happy with it even with minor tweaks.  This recipe first go around is excellent.  I followed the recipe with the exclusion of vanilla just because I had run out of it.  I also cooked for 23 minutes at high altitude and they didn't fall either!

Perfect!  I made 40 servings and put it in a 9x13 and they were very cake like and moist.  I baked for 35 min. or so.  Used the Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting recipe from all recipes on top- yum!

I am pretty good at baking. This was a terrible recipe. I did just as the recipe said the only think i changed was using melted butter instead of oil. The whole thing never even solidified in the oven even after thirty minutes. The butter was "frying" allover it the whole time.

I made this recipe as is (with oil, not butter) because the butter substitution makes this recipe THE EXACT SAME as "Best Brownies" (also on here  Needless to say, the oil did NOT make for a "better" brownie.  I'll stick with BEST BROWNIES, from now on.

These brownies turned out delicious! I am a brownie lover, and so far, these are the best brownies I have ever tasted...I will never go back to the boxed version again. This recipe was simple, easy to do, time efficient, and tasted great. Will definitely do again and again! I have done these brownies twice; the first time with melted butter, and the second time with oil. Although they turned out good, I will never make with oil again....the melted butter made it so much more richer and softer.

I am of the opinion that "home-cooked" and "from scratch" baking recipes should be better than anything from a box.  These were good, but just shy of amazing.  In all honesty you can find a better brownie from a Ghiradelli box (which sets a fairly high standard).  Having said that... the texture was nice, they are chocolate, and they are basic enough that they lend themselves to creativity.  In short: Not bad, not bad at all. *edit* I made this again with the melted butter, added semisweet chocolate chips to the mix, and then put a choclate glaze (3 tbsp butter, 3/4th C choco chip, 1 tbsp dark corn syrup, 1/4th tsp vanilla, all melted and mixed together and poured evenly on top) and it was MAGNIFICENT.  The batch I made when I reviewed it the first time (with the the recipe as is) wasnt' good.  With the slight modifications (and the butter made a HUGE difference) they didn't even get a chance to cool before they were gone.  Brother, Dad, and Husband all commented on the tremdous difference there was from the first batch.

I made these just now and they are in the oven as I write, I doubled the recipe and I did lick the spoon:) The spoon taste test tasted like the store bought without the added chemicals that in the box mixes. It was indeed yummy and I know these will be a hit with my family and friends.
I have also added some milk, cut the oil back by half and add a half cup of milk. Yummy. May have to increase flour a tad not sure. But, I do not think I did.

I doubled the recipe, and used applesauce for 1/2 of the oil.  Also I used whole wheat flour for 1/2 white flour.  Dusted powdered sugar over the top.  My family loved them!!  I had to add about 15 minutes to the baking time, checking every 5 minutes.  Wonderful!!

I first made this recipe as written and thought I did something wrong.  Not nearly chocolatey enough and a little greasy.  Still okay though, so the next time I made it, I did with 1/2 a cup cocoa, and 2 TBS strong black coffee.  Baked in 8x8 pan for 25min.  Much better.  Will try to work a little more on it to make it as fudgy as I like, but still good.  And the ease can't be beat.

5 stars for sure! Perfectly fudgy. Cut back a little on the sugar because it was a little too much for me and my health-conscious family! Added about 3/4 cup of sugar instead and it was great. Loved the chewy texture, and they're nice and chocolatey - no need for any topping unless it's ice cream. They are great when they're nice and fresh from the oven. It's now my staple brownie recipe. Thanks a bunch Sarah!

Followed the suggestion to use only one egg and the brownies turned out so much chewier than when I baked them following the recipe.  I also topped my warm brownies with 1/2 cup butterscotch chips and 1/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips.  The chips soften in less than 2 minutes and then they can be spread across.

YUM. these are soooo easy to throw together and turn out great every time. I make them with canola oil. I tried a version w/ splenda and applesauce to replace half the sugar and half the oil. YUCK. this recipe is a keeper just for the sheer simplicity, but the taste is wonderful, too. They turned out nice and fudgy, but held their shape, at 22 minutes in the oven.

These were excellent brownies!  I will never use a box mix again.  Delish and so easy!  Even my in-laws raved about these (and that is saying something).  I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa because I LOVE dark chocolate.  FABULOUS!

I have been making this recipe for at least one and a half years now and I think its great!!  They are more cake like, unless you double the recipe and only use 3 eggs-- then very fudgy!!  My boyfriend loves them.  Will keep on making these forever!

mmm....mmmm....mmmm...these are soooo good! They don't need any icing. I used melted butter instead of oil, and added 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Don't overstir and they won't be too cakey. Definately satisfied my need for chocolate!

I didn't want to give this recipe a low rating, but I just couldn't give it 5 stars.  It came out cakey with hardly chocolate flavor.  I'm going to try the deep-dish brownies now to see what I come up with.

After reading alot of the reviews...I thought these would be great but I was really dissapointed. I added about 1/4 cup of mini chocolate chips to the batter and after they were cooked...even a little longer than suggested....they tasted almost as if they were never cooked at all. Therefore...I am still in search of the ultimate brownie recipe.

I've made these brownies several times now, and everyone, friends and family, love them - rich chocolate flavour and great moist texture.  Some additional chocolate chips go reat, but I think the walnuts are a must too - add greatly to the texture and flavour, not to mention the nutrition.  Very easy and reliable recipe.

These are NOT your typical "cocoa" dry brownie w/ no chocolate taste. These brownies and delicious and very chocolaty. DH and the kids had NO idea they were homemade. I substituted the oil for melted butter and I added about 2 Tablespoons of Hershey's chocolate syrup and pecans. Perfectly moist, chewy and chocolaty!

EXCELLENT! I was out of butter and was craving brownies so I tried this recipe. A very rich, chewy brownie. I used chocolate chips instead of nuts. I've had to make 2 batches of these since yesterday, my family won't leave them alone.

These were no more difficult to make than a boxed mix, and the results were so much better!  They're moist and chewy and VERY chocolatey--two thumbs up in my book!

Omg!!! These brownies are sooooo good!!  I used the 8×8 glass and cooked for 25-30min... Just made sure toothpick came out clean.. I also used the butter instead of oil.  My coco was dark chocolate BC that's just what I had and they were delicious.    Never bake a box again.   Nice chewy inside with crispy outside... Love love love... Thank u for the recipe!!!??

OMG, I made these last week with the oil and this week using the melted butter!  No comparison!  Butter hands down.
This is not my usual recipe but I needed a small pan because my husband is away right now and I know I'd eat the whole pan regardless of the size so found this recipe.  I will use this one from now on if it is just my husband and I.  I may try to double it and use a 9x13 pan in the future.

I like this recipe just the way it is.  Changing ingredients, such as, butter for oil, big mistake. Think about how it affects the blend of the other ingredients. I make these all the time and they are gone as soon as they come out of the oven. »

I have been baking brownies for decades. These were the best brownies, I ever made. I just ate half of the pan. I used chopped pecans as I ran out of walnuts. I usually mixed by hand casually, but this time did it correctly with my stand mixer. Much of my baking gets tossed so I'm delighted for a success. For anyone contemplating substituting apple sauce for oil, ending up with fodder for the garbage can hardly makes wasting ingredients worth it. Stick with well reviewed, tried and true.

These were pretty good. I made them exactly as written, but I omitted the optional walnuts. I have no particular preference for thin/chewy or thick/cakey brownies, but I noted that these came out fairly thin and chewy. Good chocolate flavor, not too mild. I baked them for the full 25 minutes. They were very easy to make, so that's a plus. Hard to compare these to so many other brownie recipes, but I can say that they were worth making, and would be worth making again.

This recipe is perfect as is! I have a "crew" of college age boys (my grandson and his friends) who love it! The only change I have to make is to double the recipe to feed them all. 
Sometimes I add different flavorings to the recipe, a bit of coconut extract or orange oil in addition to the vanilla. Today I made a chocolate-orange ganache for the top. I plan to garnish with freshly grated orange zest. 
But make no mistake, these brownies don't need anything; they are wonderful made exactly as the recipe directs. Thank you, Sarah!

Tripled recipe for thick brownies on 13 x 9 pan. Added 3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips and 1 chopped bar of white chocolate. Very fudge! Made with oil as it retains better moisture than butter.

My first time baking brownies. Went through a lot of recipes, and when I say a lot, I mean A LOT!!! Tried this one out, and the brownies are amazing, just as claimed. A nice crunchy top layer and all moist and fudgey and sooo chocolatey inside! ^_^ Would've taken a picture but everyone's polished it off already. -.- This is officially my go-to recipe. 
And oh! I made it in a BLENDER! (Yes, it's possible!)

I thought these were quite good for such a quick and easy recipe. These come together much quicker than the recipe I usually use. The flavor (I used melted butter) was delicious, and they were fudgy. Will use this recipe again.

Produced great, dense gooey brownies. However, we followed instructions and poured the recipe into a 9x9 square pan but were disappointed to see that there was barely any batter. We added m&ms and made another batch with 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder and mixed with original and tasted great:)

These are very yummy :) I have three hungry little boys and these brownies don't last long! Okay the first time I made them exactly like the recipe except for the walnuts because we don't really like nuts in brownies and they were yummy but they were kind of missing a savory element. The second time I used 1/4 cup margarine 1/4 cup vegetable oil and they were a little bit better but still wanted a little more richness. I just made them tonight for dessert and used all butter and they're delish!! Sweet, fudgy and just enough savory richness, mmmm......so with using butter instead of vegetable oil I give these brownies five stars using oil more like four but still very good!

Wonderful, Delicous "Old Fashion" brownies. I used melted butter and followed recipe to a "t". 
There was nothing grainy about this brownie, so I would suggest that the person that complained about that problem give this another try and mix the sugar well.
I will keep this recipe handy and use it again soon.

I used this recipe to make brownies for a road trip with my dance company. They were a huge hit! I swapped the oil for room temp butter and didn't add the walnuts. Some were rationing out their brownies to save them for as long as they could. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Love these! I don't make brownies often enough, but I recently needed to make a lactose-free dessert for a friend and these are splendid! Super moist ad just sweet enough without being dense-wet like super-sweet store-bought desserts. I also through in a handful of coarsely grounded black sesame powder since I had some on hand (& to go with another dessert I was making) and it took it to another level. It's very subtle, so it's not earth shattering, but it adds fiber & when you bite into it, you go, "Oh, look at that. That's interesting".

I am officially OBSESSED with these brownies. Even though I went with the original recipe and didn't substitute with butter, it is still fudgy and delicious. I will keep making these until the end of time!

Followed the recipe, with the addition of a tsp. of cinnamon (which I add to any baked goods I can. LOL). These are fool proof and delicious! Why use a box when these are so easy and wonderful. Definitely my go-to brownie recipe. Thanks so much!

My girlfriend LOVES this recipe!!!!! However, I find the original recipe a little bland. I add 1/2 a teaspoon of almond extract to accentuate the nuttiness of the walnuts and give it more flavor.

Perfect! Love that I don't have to use store-bought mix and these are quite easy, since I usually have cocoa powder lying around (and not baking chocolate as is often required for brownies). They were rich, moist and chocolatey. I do not need another chocolate brownie recipe with these bad boys!

I read the negative reviews but don't understand why theirs didn't work out... the brownies were perfect.  I almost substituted butter but thought I'd go with the original recipe this time and it was fine.  Moist (cooked through at 22 minutes); ate some before they cooled.  Very nice brownies and a good chocolate flavour.  (I didn't add nuts or chocolate chips.)

i was looking for a cocoa-based brownie made with oil - a pantry recipe.  These are excellent, nicely fudgy and zero fuss.    Used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa powder, sifted the dry ingredients together, and baked in an 8 x 8 pan.  To ensure moist brownies, mix just until the dry ingredients are blended, and bake until just barely done.   This is a keeper!

Easy, amazing. Love the texture. I did cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and honestly could have gone down to 1/2 cup because they are sweet without being overly sweet!

These brownies turned out amazing! I use an 8 x 8 pan instead of the suggested 9 x 9 and they came out with perfect thickness. This was my first time making brownies from scratch, and, with this recipe, it won't be my last.

I love this recipe. It's simple and fast. It goes great with Peanut Butter Frosting. Sometimes I make changes to it like using butter instead of oil.

I never review recipes but I had to review this one. Nothing I have baked since has been able to live up to these. Nothing. They are easy to make, cheap, and my God they taste like heaven. I'm pretty sure I've put on 10 pounds of brownies since I found this recipe.

Easily the best brownies I've ever made. Family loves them. As a previous comment suggests, I doubled the recipe and stuck in a 9 x 13 pan for 35 mins. Melted butter is definitely the way to go. They turn out lovely every single time. I have a family of 4, and the doubled recipe is the perfect amount for us chocolate lovers. Have been making these over and over again! Thank you for this recipe!

I have made this recipe three times now, each time thinking I must be doing some significantly wrong. But each time it comes out the same, just as many other reviewers have said: wet and seemingly unable to fully achieved being cooked through. It seems like way too much oil and I'm thinking that may be the problem. I bake regularly, and this is the only brownie recipe I have such consistent trouble with!

We ate these when they were still hot from the oven and they were perfect! Crispy edges, flaky top, and semi-gooey middle. Chocolatey and chewy :) They were very easy to make, but definitely double the recipe and bake them n  9 x 13 pan bc they go very quickly!!

I had no butter in the house and needed something sweet, quick and delicious to take to a birthday party. These did the trick.  They were simple to make in a pinch. I thought the oil may overpower the taste in the finished product, but no. They were delicious and were an big hit!  I wish I had doubled the recipe as they were gone almost instantly.  I gave 4 stars.. as personally, I would prefer a bit more chocolatey taste.  These had a nice subtle chocolate flavor.  I added a bit more vanilla and did not add walnuts...Also, as a note,  I thought they were going to be a flop when I took them out of the oven as they flattened in the pan.  Shrinking aside, they came out tasty and delicious! I will definitely make again... and again :)

It was snowing and I had a craving for brownies without a box of mix in the house.  I looked for a recipe that was quick and easy and found this. Start to finish, it took a little over half an hour (and most of that was cook time).  A couple brownies later, my husband commented, "I don't think I can go back to brownie mix.  These are so much better."

I doubled the recipe to use a 9x13 pan and increased the baking time to 30 min. I also split the oil to half oil and half melted butter. Came out great- moist and delicious!  I added some left over toffee bits to it- they melted and disappeared as it cooked but YUM

The ingredients themselves taste amazing.. But the pan size is all wrong... They turned out incredibly thin even in the 8x8. Used butter as I always do even with boxed brownies. They tops were perfect and fudgey, but the bottom was like cake.. Even baked for a shorter amount of time.

These are fabulous! They have a great rich chocolate flavor without being overly sugary. The only change i made was to substitute coconut oil for vegetable oil. Thank you for sharing this recipe! I will definitely be making these again and again.

Great recipe.  Made as written besides doubling it for a 9X13 and extending oven time.  Perfectly chewy brownies just like a supermarket mix.  Held together well in squares. Just as delicious next day.  Will make again.  New favorite brownie mix.

This was my first attempt ever at making brownies from scratch. To say the least, the second pan in under one week is about gone. My husband and I absolutely love them! Better than any box mix sold in stores. The recipe really couldn't be any simpler. I have an electric oven and it takes me 35 minutes to bake these brownies, as when I check them at 25-30 minutes the inside is still somewhat runny but the extra ten minutes time added does not burn the top or make the edges crispy. I am happy that I can make these brownies for my man after a long day of work. To see his eyes light up makes me smile :) The only problem is trying not to eat them up while I am home alone all afternoon :(

I chose this recipe for ease & simplicity of ingredients. It's a keeper! I did use melted butter instead of oil, 3/4 cup sugar - I planned to frost them so I opted to reduce sugar in brownie. I also baked them in my mini-brownie pan, baked for about 8-10 minutes. They turned out moist & yummy, especially after they sat for few hours. Next day they were even better (stored in plastic, air-tight container. I used the Brownie Frosting recipe on this site - and although it was too sugar, it did add a nice touch to the brownies. Thanks!

These are the best and easiest brownies!  I have been making these brownies for years and will not try another.  No melting butter!  No melting chocolate!  I like to mix regular cocoa with Dutch-processed cocoa which gives the brownies a little richer chocolatiness and darker color.  Don't waste your time and effort - double the recipe and bake in a 9x13!  To get that exta crackly top layer - beat the eggs and sugar first until pale in color and light and fluffy - about 5 minutes.  Or skip this step and make as directed.  Either way it's a win-win!

These are wonderful! My changes were to double the recipe (except the nuts, I quadrupled those for a total of 2 Cups walnuts, with 1/4 cup reserved for topping just before baking) and to cook for 32 minutes at 350 in a 13x9 glass dish.  It made 12 large, fudgy nutty brownies. They came out perfect!

These are amazing! Instead of canola oil, I decided to try coconut oil in them. Slightly less bad for you...and the hint of coconut put these over the top! I might melt it next time, though...I left at as a solid and my batter was so thick, I had to add a tablespoon of milk. But I recommend trying coconut oil! Soooo good and fudgy.

I've made these brownies 4 times now. I used dark cocoa powder though. Twice I subbed butter for the oil. Whichever way I made them they were delicious every time. Easy peasy.

I never made brownies from scratch and these were awesome.  Next time I will make them a little thicker.  I made a pan with pecan pie topping and this was a perfect recipe for that.

These brownies were great; chocolaty and fudgey, even better with some nuts on top. However, they didn't work AT ALL for what I needed. I was making brownie pops, and the batter was so sticky and thick that it made dense, squishy blobs. After one batch I made mini loaves out of the rest of the batter and switched to quick- and easy brownies. This is a great recipe, but I definitively wouldn't recommend trying to make pops with it. My mistake!

Very easy recipe - probably easier than a box.  I just wanted to make a quick dessert, found the  best brownie recipe ever! Made them in a mini-cupcake pan, only fill 3/4 each, greased and floured each spot. Took the full 20 min - perfection!  Must let cool, then remove. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

Never going back to box brownie mix!  These brownies are incredibly easy and delicious - chewy, chocolatey, everything a brownie should be!  I do use a 9x9 pan, and yes, they do come out somewhat thin.  This is not a problem for me, but it is something to keep in mind if you're looking for big, thick brownies.  I think they're just perfect!

I am not too fond of this recipe as it tasted exactly like a generic box mix, and this is after adding chocolate chips for more richness as suggested by some on this site. It was lacking that chocolate flavor I am used to in brownies and adding the walnuts did nothing for the flavor, which is darn near impossible. I wonder if adding 3/4 cups chocolate and another 1/3 cup sugar may have made a difference? Nevertheless, there is a much richer recipe on this site called Mmmmm... Brownies by Cicada77 that uses just chocolate morsels to create the brownie.

I no longer buy brownie mix, this is an awesome recipe. I double it and reduce sugar by a 1/3 of a cup, I use only 3 eggs and 1/2t salt.  Then I chop the nuts and sprinkle on top before baking the best brownies in the city.

The only changes I make to this recipe is to use 1/2 cup melted unsalted butter in place of the oil and to 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar in place of the 1 cup white sugar. This recipe is quick and easy and makes the most delicious brownies!

I switched out the oil for butter, and doubled the whole recipe.  I also topped with cream cheese mixture (1 8 oz package, 1 egg and 1/3cup sugar and blend till smooth) and baked for 30 minutes in a 13x9pan.  My brownies are about an inch thick and taste great.  They are a little crumbly, but not a big deal.

After having a major chocolate craving one night, I found this recipe and decided to try it. I am SO glad I did. These brownies are amazing. Once I even was short on regular sugar and added in some brown sugar & the result was still unbelievable. One of my family favorites. Thank you!

The brownies is a hit in my house! Doubled the recipe every time, baked it on 9x9 pan. Ingredients are handy and simple, this recipe is just perfect. No tweaks at all. Just stick to the original recipe. I let it cool overnight (my family hate me for this) but the next day, it's completely worth it! NEVER cut it straight even after fifteen minutes, leave it at least 5 hours, trust me!

Doubling this recipe was a gooooood idea! These came together SO fast when I wanted to make a scratch brownie recipe and I didn't have enough butter to do it (...I rarely run out of butter, so of course I'd get a brownie craving...) but this recipe is great! The top wasn't very pretty--it doesn't have the glossy sheen you can get from other brownies, but they make up for it in taste! I used a peanut butter frosting recipe from here (from the brownies with peanut butter frosting recipe) and added some chopped butterfinger, neither of which were necessary except I wanted to jazz them up for work. They didn't cut particularly cleanly, but who cares... they are fudgy and yummy!

So good. I have made this many many times and it is always so good. I use butter instead of oil, and i use hersheys cocoa. I did use another unsweetened cocoa once and they were just not as chocolatie. Will make these again and again.

I wish I could give this recipe even more stars! I've made it twice and will never use another from-scratch recipe again. No more boxed mixes in my house. Ever. Seriously. They are gooey in the extreme (Note: I doubled the recipe both times) but I think an extra egg would help them stay firmer, because I'm using large rather than extra large eggs. No complaints, just a tip. Also, the second time I made this recipe, I doubled it and added about 3/4 cup fresh strawberries, diced and dredged in flour. Next time, trying more (1 - 1.5 cups) of strawberries and/or raspberries. I can't wait to do it again, but my waistline can :)

Very pleasing brownie recipe!  It is so easy to throw together and has ingredients that most everybody has on-hand at any given time.  It's nice to be able to use vegetable oil instead of using up a stick of butter from your fridge and/or waiting for one to soften to room temp.  Check them early at about 18-19 minutes if you're like me and like your brownies on the fudgy side as opposed to cakey.  If they're still runny, just keep checking them every 2-3 minutes thereafter.    Followed the recipe to the letter, except for the vanilla.  I didn't have any, so I put teaspoon-size squirt (judging with my eye) of maple syrup.  I have no idea if that made any difference whatsoever, but it won't hurt anything.  ;-)

So delicious! I followed the recipe to a t except I doubled it and used half a cup of of melted butter and half a cup of vegetable oil as I didn't have a full cup of butter. I then baked it about 35 mins as a previous reviewer who had doubled the recipe had done. Best brownies recipe that I have found.

Personally, I thought this recipe was too thick, the batter didn't fall softly or flow like real brownies should. They need to be light and smooth. I found that this recipe was disgusting.

I made these today and they are wonderful. I used the origanial recipe and added a chopped Guardelli Chocolate bar with almonds. This made it perfect. I did bake in a 8" by 8" pan to make them a bit thicker. Thanks for sharing.

These things are excellent--I doubled the recipe since I have a large family. I used one cup of white sugar and one cup of brown sugar. Gave them a really nice texture and chewiness. I also lowered my oven temp to 325 (since my oven runs hot) and baked them about 30 minutes.

These taste ok but the recipe is all wrong. I looked in on them after 20 minutes and it was just chocolate bubbling in a pan of oil. I had to spoon oil off and put them back in. They still have too much oil. They didn't rise much, I kind of suspected that there wasn't enough baking powder. Probably not enough flour either. This recipe needs serious modification. 1 star for tasting good, but not really brownies.

Definitely a favorite in our house! We always double the recipe and bake in a 9x13 pan. Using melted butter instead of vegetable oil is a must. It makes the brownies ten times better. It's a great recipe to try different things with. We sometimes put white or semisweet chocolate chips in the mix. We have also been known to pour half of the mix in the pan, then pour a layer of melted caramel in the middle, then the rest of the brownie mix. Bake it at the same temperature for the same amount of time. It turns out perfect every time.

I doubled this recipe to fit into a 13X9 pan and subbed in brown sugar for half of the sugar needed. The result was super thick, moist and a little bit maple-y. Totally delicious and totally impressed my in-laws.

these are amazing! i used the butter as suggested and it came out delish. i doubled the recipe and spread half in the bottom of a 9x13 dish and then laid some caramel discs ( like used for caramel apples) on top and then topped with the remaining brownie mixture. they came out heavenly

I was craving chocolate one night and found this recipe. It was very easy and oh so delicious! 

I used 1/2 of butter instead of oil and melted it in the microwave and then added it to the sugar to dissolve it a little. I added mini marshmallows to the mix. I also melted PB and swirled it on the top before I put the pan in the oven. It turned out great because I love PB and chocolate together and the marshmallows gave it a nice gooey texture.
 
The next time I make these, I will swirl raspberry jam instead of PB. Giada De Laurentiis did it on her show on the Food Network and it looked so good. The possibilities are endless!

These brownies are PERFECT!!  And so simple. There is no reason people should be making them from packages.

These are great but I changed the sugar up for a richer taste, half white sugar half dark brown sugar. Amazing.

I thought these were pretty good! I haven't been too impressed with any of the other brownie recipes I've tried, but these were pretty darn good. I cut back on the salt a tiny bit, and I think next time I might try just 1/8 tsp of salt (I use sea salt and it must have a stronger flavor because I'm always finding recipes too salty and I'm not an old lady--I'm 27!)  Also, might try butter next time just to see if that improves the recipe. I threw in about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips too!
Edited 2/11/12- I made these again with melted butter and 1/8 tsp sea salt and that changes my rating to 5 stars! My husband even thought they were from a box mix. This is a keeper!

Perfectly chocolatey and gooey.  I used blood orange olive oil instead of vegetable oil, served them hot and ala mode.  Oh my yes.  Might use a little less sugar next time.

These are okay brownies. I'm surprised by all the raving about them, I have made better brownies from several other recipes, but I just had to try this one because of all the reviews. However, I will stick to others.

These brownies tasted wonderful, but I couldn't get them to set or to not stick to the pan. They seemed oily so I tried to make them with 1/3 instead of 1/2 cup oil but that did not help.  Back to the homemade brownie recipe search ...

I made these last night, followed the advice of other bakers and used butter instead of oil. Unfortunately, the brownies tastes cook but were cake-like rather than fudgy, the way brownies should be. I hand mixed and tried not to over mix, but these still didn't work out for me. My eggs were cold and when mixed with the melted butter, it congealed some; maybe that's to blame??

Not bad.  The texture is nice, and they're pretty moist.  However, the flavor isn't impressive.  I'm glad I added a half cup of Andes baking chips into the mix, otherwise these brownies would be rather dull in flavor.  I would recommend adding some type of baking chips (chocolate, peanut butter, etc.) to the batter.

These were okay but not spectacular. I doubt if I would bake them again because they were not especially rich like I prefer my brownies.

I made these brownies with a stick of butter instead of the vegetable oil and they came out really soft.  I liked these brownies a lot. The only thing that I really didn't like was that they weren't that chocolaty. When I make these again I'm going to increase the cocoa powder and add some chocolate chips.

...I got very good result from this brownie recipe.  350°F 24mins was perfect, and the center was still moist but cooked -- turned out perfect once cooled.  I followed the recipe almost to a T, except using whole wheat pastry flour (it's all I have), then replacing 1/2 of fat with applesauce, and also using rapadura and brown sugar for all the white sugar (I don't have white sugar).   **For changes I will make next time:  less oil/applesauce combo, and definitely less sugar (I find this recipe a bit too sweet).  Otherwise, it's a keeper!  Thank you!!

Wow! Sarah I have to give this 5 stars! This was my first time to bake brownies and it was all I wanted a brownie to be--crunchy on top and moist and chewy on the inside :p plus this is sooo easy to make :) I did 1/4 oil and 1/4 melted butter and without walnuts. I'm so happy with this recipe, so goood! Thanks!!! :)

Wow! These are some amazingly good brownies! I tossed 1/2 cup of chocolate chips in a tsp of cocoa powder and folded them into the batter before baking. An excellent recipe!

Edited 8/18/2012 - I think I just made an even better version!  After mixing, and before adding the choc chips, I reserved 2/3 cup of batter. When the rest of it was in the pan, I mixed 1/2 cup of hazelnut cocoa spread (Nutella or Jiff type) and 2 tbs of very strong coffee. Then, I spooned it over the top of the rest of the batter and swirled it before baking. SO good!

This recipe is exactly what I have been looking for!  All of the other recipes I've tried come out too cakey..even the ones that say they don't.  These turned out just the way brownies are supposed to be, crackling top and all.  They taste great, and I think I can finally do away with box mixes!  I ended up doubling the recipe and cooking in a 9x13 pan, because I needed a larger quantity for an event.  The only problem that I ran into is that they were a little tough to get out of the pan.  Perhaps I will grease it better next time :)

These are the BEST!! I've made a few batches & even made one for my mom for her birthday. I modified that one by adding chocolate chips to the batter & topped it with toffee bits & chocolate syrup before baking. Mom was in chocolate heaven! I highly advise others to try this recipe instead of reaching for the packaged mixes.

great recipe! I have no complaints. I followed the recipe exactly, just doubled it. They taste fantastic. Oil is definitely cheaper than butter, so this recipe is a winner for me! They're very chewy and fudgy!

These were lovely, but I found the cooking time too long and mine burnt a bit. Still, I'm going to remake them and see how they fair with a shorter cook time. I also added an extra dose of cocoa and used almonds for the nuts.

I dont know why I'm surprised these turned out so good but seriously.....DELISH!  I used melted butter instead of oil and an 8x8 dish which took about 30 min. I also added 1 1/2 T. Melted Peanut Butter! I will be making this again and again!

wonderful recipe!  the first time, i followed the recipe exactly except i used 3/4 c sugar and it came out really nice.  i don't care for the mixture of chocolate and vanilla so the second time i omitted the vanilla and added nutmeg and cinnamon instead.  it was quite tasty!

Brownies are my favorite dessert & these did not disappoint!  I doubled the recipe, used 1/2 c. melted butter & 1/2 c. oil (mainly because after I started realized I only had 1/2 c oil), sprinkled handful of choc. chips & toffee chips (not sure they were needed), cooked in 9x13 pan for 30 minutes - YUM!

Wicked recipe. I tried it using butter only, but the brownies came out less chewy than if I were to use vegetable oil only. So, I use a mix of butter and vegetable oil for chewie-ish brownies. Thanks for the recipe!

These are the BEST brownies I have ever come across! They are super delicious and take 5 minutes to make! I always use butter rather than oil.

I don't know what I did wrong with these brownies, but they tasted salty! I did make a change from the original, by substituting baking chocolate for the cocoa (thereby decreasing oil a couple of tablespoons), but the problem was definitely a misalignment of sugar and salt, i think. texture came out so-so...i would not recommend making these with baking chocolate.

I did not care for this recipe. My family has some pretty strong stomachs and mouths and some mouths were burnt and stomachs hurt. These were just some cocoa powder baking powder and eggs.  It needs maybe... Some water?

UPDATE:Used half white sugar and brown sugar, used white wheat flour, added 1 Tbl corn syrup and 1/2 cup choc chips instead of nuts. Left out the baking powder. Baked for 20 min @ 350.  Awesome brownies!

I just made these and followed the recipe exactly (didn't add nuts) and added 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I have been on a brownie rampage to find a good homemade recipe that resembles the box brownies.  I have made 3 different brownie recipes within the last 2 days, and these are exactly what i have looking for!  The taste is just like the boxed version and the cocoa powder doesn't overpower the finished product.  Mine did have to cook longer, closer to 35 minutes on 350 degrees F.  I baked them in a clear 1 1/2 quart baking dish and was able to get 16 pieces.  I think I like my brownies baked with oil.  I noticed when I use butter, they come out more cake-like....?  I am not a big fan of cake-like brownies.  So, these seem to be what I have been looking for in a homemade brownie!  I'm so happy!********Update: I used 1/2 cup melted butter and a packet of Carnation (Breakfast Esstentials) and about 2/3 cup of sugar, next time use 1/2 cup if usinf the carnation packet(instead of 1 cup). Then followed the rest of the ingredients, except nuts.  Used a 9x9, baked at 350F for 20 -25 min and they were very moist, but didn't have the shiny, cracked top.  So, I used half of the Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze By: TUNISIANSWIFE, from this site.  They are so yummy!

These are good out of the oven, but improve over time.  The cocoa flavor deepens.  I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9 X 13 pan.  There wasn't a nice shiny crust on mine--still trying to achieve that with a scratch recipe.

Even though there were a lot of reviews where the recipe was changed, I decided to give the original a shot. It was incredibly easy to make the batter, and using Penzey's cocoa was the way to go for me. I doubled the recipe and baked in a greased and cocoa dusted 13 x 9. I I baked them for exactly 35 minutes at 350 degrees.

THE BEST BROWNIES EVER! At first bite, I thought, "Ok, it tastes like every brownie..good, but nothing special".....When I kept going for more and eventually ate the whole pan (only made a half batch), I concluded that these were in fact the best Ive ever had. They were so moist and delicious. I can't stop thinking about them and in my eyes, that deserves 5 stars. I followed the recipe exactly, except cut it all in half. I might try the butter next time, but really don't see a need to. Perfect as is. I won't even look at another brownie recipe. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!

I have gotten rave reviews over these brownies, but I cut the oil to 1/3 cup, the sugar to 3/4 cup, which makes them less sweet so you can really taste the chocolate.  I also don't cook them quite as long.

surprisingly good. i used olive oil as it's all i had on hand and it turned out fine. i think a smaller pan would definitely suffice as the brownies turned out a bit thin, but there was no sacrifice on taste. will make again.

This recipe is fantastic, exactly the brownies I have been looking for. Thank you! I make them with rapseed oil and whole wheat flour to increase the nutritional value. I haven't risked reducing the sugar because I absolutely love the flavor and texture of these brownies. The amount is perfect, too, just enough for us to pig out on chocolate without *really* overdoing it!

These brownies were amazing. I used butter instead of vegetable oil. And instead of walnuts I used chocolate chips. They are by far the best brownies I have ever tasted!

These brownies were good so I will give them a 4, but really it should be lower, I don't feel as though they lived up to their name.
I followed the directions (including using butter and not oil), but made a couple additions. I added some chocolate chips to the batter and then some more chocolate chips and walnuts to the top. 
Like I said they were good brownies but they were cake like. They were not ooey and gooey and that was a huge disappointment. 
I also must agree with a different reviewer when they said that there was not a lot of chocolate taste to them (reading I thought they were crazy, but they were right). If it wasn't for the chocolate chips there wouldn't have been too much chocolate flavor. 
Not the ooey gooey brownie I was looking for but going to keep the recipe around, who knows when I want a cake like brownie this will be the one I will turn to.

These are good brownies, and are at their peak the next day. They were moist and nicely dense. I did change a few things - I did about 2/3 cup sugar; 1/3 white, and 1/3 brown, and I also left out the baking powder in an attempt to make the brownies more dense. I was glad that I cut the sugar down, because they were sweet enough with 2/3 cup.

Pretty tasty, but they weren't as fluffy as they look in the pictures.  Not sure if I should have left them bake an extra couple minutes or what, but :(.  If I make these again, I might use a better cocoa powder, too, instead of just Hersheys.  Overall, not bad, but not amazing.

Great recipe!  I made it according to the directions with the oil, then filled two mini muffin tins with the batter.  I baked them at 350 degrees for 14 minutes & they turned out perfect!  My children & hubby said they were the best brownies ever!

Quick & easy. Very fudge-y and moist. Used the melted butter suggestion, and left out walnuts. A hit all around. Loved 'em!

I made this exactly as it called (except I used butter instead of veg oil), & added with the walnuts. They came out pretty tasty. I'm a VERY picky brownie lover though, so these aren't the best...but very good for homemade. Maybe the semisweet squares would've been better in this recipe rather than the cocoa powder. My favorite brownies are Betty Crocker's dark chocolate-made from the box.

Extremely good. I made them with spelt flour and they were great. I would, next time, use the 3/4 C sugar already suggested, as I found them a bit too sweet. I used melted/softened butter (the sugar cut up the remaining soft chunks of butter), extra walnuts, and sloshed in a little extra vanilla, as well. Still, I miss the flaky, shiny top that I associate with brownies, so I'm still looking for the 5 star version.

This recipe is virtually the same that is on the cocoa powder box; however, cut in half except for the eggs.  I think that is why it is so much better than the cocoa powder recipe.  I like to do things by scratch rather than box and I think I just found my new brownie recipe.  Delicious!

These were phenomenal. I didn't even prepare them quite right, and they turned out well, though definitely not brownie-like - my own fault. I didn't have all-purpose flour, so I used 1/4c of self-rising, and they didn't turn out one bit cakelike. I didn't add the baking soda or salt, either. Butter was subbed for veg. oil, badly melted, and I mixed the cocoa in before I was supposed to, but that didn't seem to make a difference aside from a little lumps in the batter. No butter spray, used olive oil instead. I don't know if that's what resulted in a bunch of gooey residue on the bottom or what, since i hardly used more than half a teaspoon, but either way, it didn't affect the taste. I underbaked a little, so they were definitely not solid enough to hold, but i made do with a fork. If I were to go back and redo this correctly, I'm sure they'd turn out even better!

These were wonderful! I doubled recipe for 9x9 pan and brownies were nice and thick. Since I doubled it I used 3/4 c melted unsalted butter and 1/4 cup oil. Added a handful of chocolate chips to batter and baked until soft crumbs came off on the toothpick. Awesome recipe!

NO WAY!!! I have had many brownies in my life, as I am a chocoholic. I am also a wonderful baker/cook. These brownies were way too salty. I am thinking that using Butter as recamended, could have caused this major issue. Even at that they are NOT fudgey as others have said here.

i took the suggestion of using butter instead of vegetable oil to make give it more moisture and i too had more of a 8x8 pan so i left it in for a little bit longer, and these brownies came out really good. they were dense, and not cake-like. this is my first time making brownies and even though they werent like the classic tasting brownie i was expecting, they still tasted nice. it tasted a little like chocolate milk so i guess they would go really well with milk. definite 5-stars, it was very easy and simple to make (especially since im not the best of chefs) and still came out tasting wonderfully.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! I just made them tonight after finding this recipe online. For just a few basic ingredients, these brownies came out so delicious. The only thing I had to change was the cooking time. I had to let it bake more like 35 min.  In a nut shell, this recipe is a keeper. ;-)  **UPDATE: I had to come back and change my stars to 5. I just took this same recipe and made White Brownies and they are sinfully good. All I did to tweek the recipe is omit the coco powder and add another 1/3 cup flour instead, added another 1/2 teaspoon vanilla,  2 tablespoons of margarine/butter, 2-3 tablespoons more sugar and I used butter for my dish instead of oil. I can not keep these in the house. So, if you have some non chocolate lovers in the house, this is a great alternative. Yummy!!!!!

This one was ok, but not necessarily one I would make again.  I used butter instead of oil, used a combination of brown and white sugar, and added one more tablespoon of cocoa.  They are good, but nothing I would rave about.

I really enjoyed these but they will not replace my fave brownies. As is they are fine but I made them a few times and prefer them by subbing 1/4 cup butter for 1/4 cup of the oil. I also replaced about 1/3 cup of the sugar wtih brown sugar for a more intense flavor.  I would hightly recommend using the walnuts or some chocolate chips (ii like milk chocolate)

I'm giving these 3 stars, but the recipe is probably worthy of 4 stars.  It was a quick & easy recipe to satisfy the sweet tooth of a self-proclaimed chocolate lover (my husband).  But, my personal preference for a different texture than this recipe produces largely contributed to the rating.  While moist and fudgy inside, the brownies were a little crunchy on the outside.  I prefer a more "cakey" texture.  The flavor is quite good and I mixed a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips into the batter before spreading into the pan to bake, which was a nice addition to the "chocolatyness". Would probably make these again, but they wouldn't be my go-to brownie recipe.

Yummy ummy!   My 10 year old could not wait to try these.  Very easy for a not so good cook like me to make.  I sprinkled about a 1/4 cup of mini choco-chips on top before I cooked and they looked extra good!  Taste like rich goey brownies, not cakie in texture.

Pretty darn good brownies. I didn't add the walnuts; wished I had added mini-chocolate chips though. Was expecting them to be a little higher/thicker.  Will definitely be making again (with butter instead of oil) and adding those mini chips!

These were very good and easy to make.  I did double the recipe and used melted butter as suggested.  With and without the walnuts they were a big hit!

As reviewer  MELLO 57 noticed, these ARE the same as "best brownies" recipe from this site, except that the other one asks for butter instead of oil. I tried it both ways and both are really good. I make it with oil when I feel lazy or in a hurry because it is easier and faster! This is a really delicious chewy and chocolatey brownie made either way. I do recommend adding some chocolate chips to the batter and on top as it makes it so much more decadent and delicious!

mmmm Loved them! Made them as directed (with oil) did a double batch in a 9x13 with 35min cooking time.  I was so happy to find a recipe that uses oil instead of butter because I never have butter! Did not dissapoint at all

These brownies are the best!  I use 1 stick of melted butter in place of the oil (I never use oil in baking...only butter) and a handful of chopped pecans and a handful of chocolate chips

These were cake type brownies and were very similar to what a package mix will give you. This was a really easy recipe to mix up and I had everything on hand. Budget brownies as they use ingredients that are less costly (cocoa powder as compared to chocolate squares, oil rather than butter). We prefer other recipes though so I won't make this one again. Thanks anyway they were fun to make.

These brownies got absolutely rave reviews when i brought them into the office. I used butter instead of vegetable oil as suggested, and godiva hot chocoate and semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the unsweetened cocoa powder. This is my new brownie recipe! AMAZING!

Reliable brownie recipe, made twice and came out great each time. Next time I will double the recipe, as it doesn't make 16 brownies, more like 6. I did make some chances to lower the calories - used 1/4 butter, melted, and mixed in 1/4 cup of plain lowfat yogurt or unsweetened applesauce, and used this combo instead of oil. I also used 18 packets of Splenda instead of the 1 cup of sugar, since I don't like overly sweet brownies. Each time mine came out more cake-y than chewy, but still delicious. Maybe not the best in the world, but pretty good and simple and easy to lighten up by substituting the oil and sugar for low-cal equivalents.

Whoa my gosh, you guys. Best brownie recipe ever! It's a Friday night and my date is these brownies. They are so delicious. Excellent recipe, the best I've tried. I had to bake about 12 mins longer @ high altitude, and came out perfect. I will definitely bake this recipe again, and add even more deliciousness. And such an easy recipe! Do try!

Ran across this recipe when my son wanted something chocolaty...and something that I had all the ingredients in the cupboard.   Easy to make, great taste, and now part of my favorites...having made them 3 times now.  I made them exactly as written and found them to be perfect!

These brownies were fair -- they were too "cakey" for my taste.  I prefer rich/fudgy brownies.  This recipe would have benefited from a cup of dark chocolate chips.  I have several good brownie recipes, so I probably won't make these again.

I just moved to Thailand, and I've already made batches and batches of these for potlucks, etc. They're really easy, and they use oil and cocoa, which are much cheaper and easier to obtain here! Definitely recommend!

If you are looking for a ridiculously fudgey brownie, this is it.  My only strays from the recipe: replaced the oil with butter, and omitted the salt since my butter wasn't unsalted.  Jeez these were good- next time I'll double the recipe since I baked in an 8x8 dish and ended up with about 18 smallish brownies.  Two thumbs up~ thanks Sarah! =)

Every one wanted brownies, no mixes at home, so I found your recipe and decided to give it a try. It was so easy to throw together, and they were absolutely divine. The only problem they said was there wasn't enough of them. They were all gone by the next morning. Midnight raiders attack again lol

Soft and chewy!  These brownies were delicious!  They didn't last one day in our house.  I'm always looking for milk-free recipes as we have allergies.  This one is definately a keeper!  We like our brownies a little thicker, so next time I'll make them in an 8x8 pan instead.
My 11 yr old son likes to make these, but he puts chocolate chips in as well.

Not enough batter for a 9X9 pan. The brownies turned out more cakelike and about 1/2" thick.  Will use an 8X8 pan next time.

no matter where this recipe came from, i'm glad it was posted and featured in a newsletter. holy cow, i'm on my second square hot out of the oven and i can't get over how delicious (and easy to prepare) they are. made as instructed, including walnuts, and added mini choc chips and drizzled with caramel before cooking. used an 8 x 8 pan, forgot it would take 30 minutes, checked them every 5 from 20, took them out at 32. and thanks to the engineering geniuses at kraft, i was able to squirt an ample amount of cool whip in a can onto this delectable treat. fantastic!

Absolutely the best!!! I also used the butter and mixed by hand. I really do think the secret is not to over-bake,they came out perfect. Also, happy I doubled the recipe,hubby said box mix never allowd again.

Wow! Every recipe for brownies i have tried is awful, but this is a really good recipe. The brownies were very moist and chewy. I added 1 tsp. cinnamon and a pinch of cloves and nutmeg. It really brings out the chocolate flavor. I poured the batter into the pan and topped it with chopped pecans, then patted it down lightly with a fork, and baked it for about 15 min. Awesome recipe! Kudos!!!!!

Too cake-like and hardly any chocolate/fudge flavor at all. You can really taste the butter if you used 1/2 cup of butter instead of oil. 1/2 cup of chocolate chips gave it more flavor, in my opinion. These were OK but I don't think I'll make the again.

Very good.  It's a moist, fudgy brownie, a little wet.  I would bake this in a 8x8 pan instead of a 9x9.  I followed the recipe the brownie was too thin.  Next time I'll use the smaller pan for a thicker brownie, but bake time will need to increase by 10 min.

This recipe is great! I used a 9 x 13 pan and used a double portion as recommended by other reviewers. I also used butter instead of vegetable oil. One thing I do recommend is to sift the flour and after mixing the batter for a while, mix it with a hand mixer as well. Also, for a double portion, I added 1/4 cup of milk and a few chopped walnuts and it turned out just perfect!! Adding milk gives it a somewhat different taste that is really really good. Do try that!!

I was very impressed with this recipe.  I followed the submitter's suggestion of substituting melted butter for the vegetable oil.  I also added about 1/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  My only suggestion for improvement would be to increase the cocoa content from 1/3 to 1/2 cup to make them darker and more chocolatey.  I did this for my second batch and liked them even more.

YUUUMMY!!! Do not listen to others who claim these are dry. A dry brownie means it was over cooked.  Not all ovens are the same and an oven thermometer is a great investment to make sure you are always at the right temp. This recipe produced a very moist and chewy brownie for me and even the edges were moist but perfectly baked. I only added a squirt of Hershey's chocolate syrup and 1/3 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips to the mix before baking. The only reason I give this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 is because it did leave a slight after taste.  I'm not sure if it was because of the oil.  Will definitely try again with melted unsalted butter.  DELISH!

It looks like someone may have copied this recipe and re-listed it as the "Absolutely Best Brownies," which also has a rating of nearly 5 stars. Since I saw & tried this recipe first, I'm giving it the 5 stars. These brownies are a tad sweet for me, so I like to cut the sugar by 1/4 cup, but my boyfriend raved about them. I found through experimentation that adding ground golden flaxseed meal during the dry phase or after the batter is mixed (and before the walnuts are added) gives the brownies a slightly different texture and flavor that really compliments them, especially with the walnuts since the meal is itself subtly nutty. I've made this recipe several times now and can say it's results are addictive. Love 'em. I tend to kick up the cocoa content a little more for its antioxidants, but I'm sure that messes with the ratios. Anyway, as my bf says, "these are the best brownies I have ever eaten."

These were dry and not chocolaty enough for me.  I didn't read the reviews before hand, so I used the oil instead of butter and maybe that was my mistake.

Wonderfully delicious, especially straight from the oven. I gave it 4 stars because the next day they were hard as a rock and although in a microwave they did come back to its softness I felt that it should have remained soft with a less than 24 hour window.

These brownies were, as people said, DELICIOUS!  I don't like brownies to be too rich and strong in chocolate flavor, so I slightly cut back on the cocoa powder.  After reading some of the comments, I substituted melted butter instead of oil.  They came out a little too buttery and moist for my taste.  Next time I will make exactly as the recipe calls for.  Everyone should try these, they are not too chocolatey at all, but they are completely moist and delicious!

I used a melted stick of margerine and did a mixture of half brown/half white sugar. I kept everything else the same.
I omitted the nuts because my husband isn't a nutty brownie fan, though I think it would be better with.

This makes a small 8x8 pan of brownies.
It only took me five minutes to throw this together, which was appealing enough on it's own. Enough for a midnight snack for my husband. These turned out really good. Not as good as Brooke's Bombshell Brownies, imo, but my husband liked them. 

Next time, I'd like to try them with peanut butter chips or even with a peanut butter swirl. These would be great for a bake sale. I'd make them again.

Yum.  These aren't the richest/chocolately-est brownies in the world, but they have a GREAT texture.  I made them with the butter and added just a bit of oil as well.

Mmm-Mmm for sure! I cut the recipe in half and baked them in a 6 cup muffin pan.In doing so I had to bake them for 35-40 minutes. I also doubled the vanilla called for.They were moist and perfectly chocolate.

These are very good!  I put milk chocolate chips on top right after it came out of the oven to make frosting and they were perfect!  Will make these again, very easy!

I was looking for a last minute recipe that required only the ingredients I had on hand and did not require butter or milk (allergies).  Followed recipe exactly (no nuts).  Yummy and chewy, but took about 30-35 minutes to cook.  Next time will add some chocolate chips.  Thanks for a great "in a pinch" recipe!

Thought these were quick and easy and tasted very good. I used the butter instead of oil and a little less than a cup of sugar. They were yummy. Just not enough of them!

These were great! I made some tonight and I added some coconut on the top about halfway through. It was pretty amazing lol. It was lightly toasted and added great flavor. I'd suggest trying it sometime. :) Great recipe.

These hit the spot. I had a craving for brownies like you would not even believe and these were just amazingly good. I made mine with melted butter rather than oil because I was out of oil and they turned out fine. These are the gooey kind of brownies, not the cake kind. The only thing I can complain about is the serving size was a bit small since I was feeding four children, my husband, and myself. I will for sure double the recipe next time I make it. Yummmmm!

These brownies are great. I didn't change a thing, except for adding 1 cup of chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup chocolate chips. These are the best from-scratch brownies I have ever made!

This is my favorite brownie recipe I have been using it for the last 5 years! The only changes I made was omitting the walnuts (my husband does not enjoy them) and added about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips.  I also added a tad bit more salt....I always like a little more salt in my baked sweets.

this is my staple brownie recipe! i'm always looking for new recipes to improve on, but this one i've stuck to. it calls for cheap ingredients that can be found in any house. my only recommendation is always doubling the recipe. if you want thicker, taller brownies, double it and bake it in a 8x8 pan. if you want bigger, flatter brownies use a 13x9. both work wonders!

Yummy! These were sooo good! Chewy, chocolatey and delish! I put them in the oven for a bit longer (about 30 min), added about 1/8 of a cup more sugar, because others complained about a bitter aftertaste, and added 1/2 cup of choco chips.  The were great! No bitter aftertaste for me! Really good esp. just out of the oven and topped with vanilla ice cream! Thanks so much. Will definitely make these again.

This recipe was fantastic. It was a dense, chocolatey moist brownie. I added chocolate chips to give more of a chocolate taste. Just to let Mello 57 know, the other difference between "Best Brownies" and This is that this one uses oil, which makes it moister. More like a brownie and less like a cake.

I made these brownies exactly as the recipe specified.  It is a really dense and flat brownie.  Also, mine had a bitter aftertaste, as another reviewer also said.  I wasn't very impressed with this recipe.

Very good considering they aren't loaded with butter.  I even used only about half the oil because I was short, adn they are still chewy, moist and flavorful.

Not bad at all, and super fudgey! These make rather small brownies, like the 2-bite variety, but they're great- my fiancee ate a few and just loved them. I took someone's suggestion and added a half cup of chocolate chips to make them gooey, and that worked out great. Would definitely make them again, although will probably double or even triple the recipe to share with others at a party.

These were my first 'from scratch' brownies. They were sinful. I used melted butter and also sprinkled half the brownies with butterscotch chips before baking. Highly recommended served with ice cream on top. Absolutely delicious and very easy to make. Thank you for the recipe!

These brownies were fantastic!!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and added only 1 egg (as I do not like cake-like brownies).  They were so moist, chewy and fudgy.  They are as good as -if not better than- boxed brownies.

I've have tried at least a half a dozen brownie recipes in the last two weeks.  My students at school are interested in making brownies, but I won't let them use a box mix.  These are definitely a cake consistency, but were tasty.  Not overwhelming with chocolate taste.  I gave them to my classroom after experimenting and they were gone in 30 seconds.  No one raved over them, but at least these were edible and looked that way.  I've made some on this website that I've simply dumped in the trash.  I didn't change the recipe at all, since I wanted to see how they turn out with the original recipe.

I used the oil, and buttered the pan.  I baked it about 1 hour.  They were excellent.  Crispy on the outside and soft and gooey on the inside. Definitely a make again.

Ok, I'm actually going to try to make these again, because I did make changes to this recipe, and I think that's where the problem is.  So, I still gave it four stars because they were fudgey, very cocoa-ey, and not too sweet.  However, mine had a weird taste because I tried to make them without oil and used applesauce instead.  Hey, I tried!  My husband still liked them...he ate most of them the day I made them.  :)

Good brownies, but I've had better...I used butter instead of oil and only one egg.  I added some chocolate syrup and approx. 1/2 c. of chopped up Hershey's chocolate bars.  I put it in an 8X8 pan and cooked it for 28 minutes.

These aren't exactly what I was looking for. I don't know what I did wrong, but they are a little too cake-like for me. They taste good, but not as gooey and chewy as I'd hoped. Maybe next time I'll try butter and baking them less than 20 minutes. Thanks :)

These were very good, but not the best I've ever had. I would also double the recipe to make them because I used an 8x8" pan, and they were only about 1/2 inch thick.

i LOVE these brownies...make them all the time. i add chocolate/butterscotch/peanut buttter/white chocolate chips sometimes, or sometimes nuts, and sometimes just plain. the perfect balance between fudgy and cakey -- awesome!

These were pretty good brownies, but not my favorites since they were not as fudgey as I would like (try Deep Dish Brownies if you like fudgey - they are by far my favorite so far.) Nice flavor, however. I sprinkled dark chocolate chunks on top, which really added to them.

the oil makes the brownies taste weird.  I think these brownies would be really good if you used the butter instead.

I was able to make it compact and fudgy the way I like it by following some of the suggestions in the other reviews: cutting down slightly on the flour, baking powder, and eggs. I also used melted butter like the description suggests. But the taste was funky. Not chocolatey, and slightly off. I'm not sure what exactly caused it. Maybe I should have used more cocoa powder, and I bet some chocolate chips like another reviewer suggested would have been good.

Excellent! I followed the recipe exact using just a little less baking powder. After batter was in the pan, I topped with chocolate chips. Also topped only half with chopped walnuts (for the hubby). I think next time I will double the recipe, use only 3 eggs (for the more fudgey brownie) and bake in a 9x11 baking dish (the more the merrier!). These are cake-like but still soooo yummy!

I just pulled a batch of the brownies out of the oven a little less than an hour ago. They smelled amazing. Although I did alter the recipe a bit. I didn't add any Baking Powder or Salt or Walnuts. I used the 1/3c cocoa plus instead of the full 1.5 cup flour I only addded 1.4c and the oher 1.4 c was cocoa of cup of butter and then mixed it with the cocoa powder before adding it to the eggs, vanilla, and sugar. 
    I am a Certified Chef with a specialty in Pastry that has gone through many years of training and I was most impressed with this recipe. Don't overbake them what so ever. I used a black cocoa powder from Switzerland and the product was exquisite. Also I glazed them with chocolate ganche. The overall product was splended and I will find this a keeper. Thank you to the person that came up with this.

The taste of these brownies is wonderful!  I cooked them for 25 minutes but they were gooey in the middle so you will want to cook them a little longer.  The middle drooped quite a bit and they never seemed to puff up very well.  I covered them a lot of powdered sugar...and they were still delicious!

wow, these brownies are truly decadent!! i used melted butter instead if oil & added a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips along with the nuts. you may want to gently blot the excess butter from the top of the brownies after they're baked.
thank you sarah!

I've tried this recipe twice now and it just didn't turn out for me BOTH times. My family is big on brownies and they just weren't into these. It was really convenient with the vegetable oil, but the brownie taste just wasn't there. It tasted too sweet...like plain sugar and no chocolate taste. They also turned hard after it cooled. Maybe I'll try it one more time with butter and add some chocolate morsels for taste.

The BEST brownies ever!!  I used 1/2 c. melted marg. in place of the oil and it gave a nice buttery flavor.  I omitted the nuts as my kids don't like them.  I topped these brownies with 3 sq. semi sweet choc. and 1/3 c. sour milk melted together then add 1 tbsp. sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla.  Put in fridge to cool and thicken sauce and you have the most to die for brownies you ever tasted, I guarantee it!!!!   Word of caution --  DO NOT OVERBAKE

Pretty good!! I ommitted the baking powder for fear they would end up cakey with it.  I might double the recipe to make one batch next time, though.

My, oh my.... these are the best brownies.  I made this recipe this evening as a surprise for my husband. They were a great combination of everything wonderful about brownies.  Rich chocolate flavor and chewy fudginess! I did use a combination of melted butter and oil because I didn't have enough of either to double the recipe. So, 2/3 butter 1/3 of oil and they were DELICIOUS!  Thanks so much.....

My favorite brownie recipe so far.  Still doesn't beat a mix, but I HATE buying mixes!  I added some chocolate syrup and 1/2 c chocolate chips.  Baked in our convection oven for about 25 minutes.

I didn't care for the texture of these brownies much.  They also didn't have enough of a chocolate taste.  I think next time I would use melted butter instead and add chocolate chips, and maybe some melted chocolate to the batter.

Excellent!!! Per the suggestions of other reviewers, I double all the amounts, used melted butter instead of oil, added half a cup semi-choclate chips, and baked in a 9*13 pan for 35 minutes. Great texture and taste! Enjoyed it every bit!

These brownies were awesome, and so easy to make!  They had a great chocolate flavor and moist fudgy texture.  I added a chocolate glaze made of bittersweet chocolate, milk, corn syrup, butter & vanilla.  I will make these again!

Ok I'm not sure if it's just me but iv'e had better brownies in a Box. I made these on my birthday and I wasn't impressed. The brownie to me wasn't very sweet, and I was expecting more from the recipe. Sorry they were just ok for me.

All I have to say is WOW! These are the best brownies ever! I made them mostly for myself, because my brother nor my fiance like chocolate very much.  I think I only got one, the rest were gone when I woke up in the morning. I added both milk chocolate and simi-sweet chocolate chips. YUMMY!

YUMMY!  This is by far my new favorite brownie recipe!  I followed the butter suggestion, and also added 1/4 cup of miniature chocolate chip morsels that I had on hand.  At one point during the picnic we had to hide them to ensure we'd have some left for AFTER lunch!

Mmm-mmm is right!  My husband and I were having a chocolate craving this afternoon - these did the trick!  I added 1/4 c water to the mix because I like mine a tad bit "cakey".  They are moist and delicious, super-chocolatey, and easy to whip up.  I sprinkled mine with some chocolate chips before baking to give it an extra chocolate punch.   Will definitely make these again.

These were great! Not too sweet, but these packed enough chocolate flavour to make me and my chocoholic roommates very happy! 
My only criticism is with the thickness of the brownies -- I just like them to be higher. I think next time I'll use an 8x8" pan and fiddle with the time/temperature until I get it right. 
Thanks, Sarah!

This is a very good brownie recipe!  This is great for anyone who prefers a fudgy brownie, which I and my family do :)  I didn't have any nuts, but mixed in mm's semisweet baking bits I had in my pantry. They are good, however next time I would really like to try adding some regular milk chocolate chips.  I think mix-ins add a lot! I read that one of the reviewers used a pie plate, so since I didn't have a square 9 inch dish (only an 8 inch) I used my 9 inch pie plate.  I had to add 10 minutes to the cooking time, but the brownies still turned out wonderfully!

All I have to say is Mmm-Mmm!  These are definitely the BEST brownies that I've made.  I did add milk chocolate chips, a request from my chocolate loving family and used butter instead of oil.  They are so moist & soft, the only thing is that they didn't cut very well, they were a bit crumbly.  I recommend these to anyone looking for a wonderful brownie recipe!  Thanks Sarah.

Followed the recipe using the melted butter version.   Moist, fudgy but sweet brownie.  Will make again but cut back on the sugar!  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Cinch to make!! I used 1/2 c. melted butter instead of the oil. I also added Ghiradelli double chocolate chips (bout 1/2 c.) to the mix....and used an 11X7 glass pan....turned out perfect. Very Yummy!

These brownies were absolutley fantastic!!  I only have an 8x8 in. pan so I worried the middle may be too gooey, but they turned out yummy.  I used the melted butter.  I had used a tablespoon of butter for something else so I actually only used 7 tbls. instead of 8.  Only baked for 20 minutes and they set up nicely.

This the best brownie I have ever made! And it's easy and hassle-free, good for a quick snack. I used 100g of butter which I melted. I made them into cupcakes. The batter is sticky and delicious.

Although I made these once and they DIDN'T turn out they were awesome! I made them in an 8x8 which made them not turn out - didn't cook in the middle. However, you should have seen me, my husband and 3 year old sitting on the couch with the pan eating the sides! They really are delicious! Will make again using, of course, a 9x9.

These were perfect, crusty on the outside, fudgy on the inside.  I added chocolate chips, pecans and caramel sauce to mine.  yummy!

These brownies are so delicious. This past weekend I decided to bake brownies using three different recipes, including Dump Bars from this website and another recipe from a different website. I did a taste test with four of my friends and this recipe unanimously won. 

I also tried them in an 8 by 8 pan and found that it works best with the 9 by 9 called for in the recipe. If you follow the directions and don't use a mixer, they turn out wonderfully and even has the appearance of those boxed brownies. One thing though, I took the advice from some of the other reviews and added two tablespoons of chocolate syrup and 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips.

I had to give this one a five!!!!!!!

Thanks Sarah.

These were good, had all ingredients on hand and made them on the spur of the moment late at night.   A little doughy/soft in the center, but had good flavor and smelled wonderful while baking.  Going to try a few others, searching for one similar to the families favorite boxed.

These made really good brownies. I used butter (versus the oil) for the recipe and added white chocolate and semi sweet chocolate chips to the batter. These were a hit with the guys although I personally thought they tasted better the next day.

These were sooooo yummy! I added some chocolate chips, used melted butter like another person suggested, and added about a teaspoon of cinnamon. They were amazing. I'm telling you, you've got to try them with the cinnamon. I've never had success making brownies from scratch - I've always thought the ones from mixes taste better. But these were very chocolatey, not at all pasty or grainy, and I loved them. So did everyone at work!

These are very good....very chewy and moist. I made them for my daughter for her b-day treat at school. I used half butter and half oil. I also added chocolate chips then when it was done I put cut-up snickers, m&m's and drizzled melted Dove promises ontop. yum yum!!!!

a pretty good cakey brownie recipe.  I added choc chips to make it more chocolatey :) I think I prefer the deep dish brownie recipe on this site more  - this recipe is more cakey and light and less chocolatey :)

Wow, this is sinfully goooood!! I doubled the recipe and put it in two 8-inch pie pans coz I don't have square ones. Used butter instead of oil and added chocolate chips in addition to the walnuts. Also threw in some baking M&Ms on one of the pans. The brownies came out moist and the chocolate taste was rich and good. Definitely will make this again!

These were so rich and delicious! I used butter instead of oil and pecans instead of walnuts, and instead of using 1 cup of white sugar, I used 3/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and threw in a few chocolate chips as well. They came out absolutely perfect-- dense, sinfully rich and very chocolatey. Great recipe!

I made these with the oil, against my better judgement, because of all of the good reviews..nothing spectacular.  Just not rich enough for me.  I will try again with the melted butter, cause otherwise, it is an easy recipe.

They were very good! I only make boxed brownies. My 12 year old daughter wanted to make brownies. She found this recipe and we had all the ingredients minus the  walnuts. There wasn't much volume to this recipe. But they doubled in size when baking. She made a second batch and used a smaller pan but it still didn't fill the square 5X5. I would double next time we make these. Flavor was on point, perfect chocolate amount. Not too sweet- Just right

We doubled the recipe (9x13), omitted the nuts (school friendly) and added a can of eagle brand caramel in the Center. Baked for 30 min.  So delicious. Fluffy and moist. No icing needed. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

This is the ONLY recipe I use for brownies. I usually double it and use a 9×13 non-stick pan. My daughter loves them and so do her co-workers!

I did as suggested and used melted butter instead of oil. And used an 8x8 pan. The best brownies I’ve ever made!

I picked this recipe because I didn’t have any butter on hand and all the stores were closed. I’m glad I did! I put the batter in cupcake tins. I didn’t have walnuts but they still tasted really nice. The top had a touch of crunch and the inside was nice and chocolatey. I topped them with vanilla royal icing and crushed candy cane.

I have tried a lot of brownie recipes over the years, and I think this is the best one. They are rich and chocolaty, and I like that I can make them with olive oil, which is the only cooking oil I have used for over 10 years. The brownies go fast, and everyone says they are yummy.

It was flavorful, it was not pretty!  
Is there an adjustment to this recipe if at 7,000 feet?  This was such a disappointment. It rose in the pan at 25 min it all collapsed!

These were very chocolatey and moist.  I omitted nuts this time because I wasn’t sure if the family I was baking for had any allergies.  Next time I will add the walnuts and reduce sugar a bit.   Will make them again soon I’m sure!

These brownies are not very chocolaty. My husband and I both agreed they were bland. I used melted butter instead of oil, and added walnuts. Next time I will try a recipe with actual chocolate instead of coco powder and see if I have better luck. These are easy to make though!

Mmmmmmm, delicious! I used 3/4 c sugar, added 2 extra ripe bananas, mashed up with the egg mixture, used 1/4c melted butter and 1/4c oil, instead of just oil, and added an extra 2 TBS of cocoa powder. No nuts since my daughter doesn't care for them. Dusted the individual servings with powder sugar.  They turned out super moist and fluffy and very chocolatey! Not quite cake-like and not super gooey - just right for us. Soooo good

These were very easy to make I followed the recipe exactly with the walnuts, but made a double batch in a 9x13 pan baked for 35-38 min. Then I added about 2 tbsp of softened butter. I also added marshmallows about 1 cup and frozen Nutella cubes which added wonderful pockets of Nutella ( about 10 tsp of Nutella. Freeze them on wax paper &  chop in half. Put half of the cubes in the batter mix & the other half on top right before they go into the oven.) they basically turned into rocky road brownies.

fabulous! we prefer cake brownies. so I doubled the recipe so it then  called for 1 cup of flour- so then  I used 2 cups of flour  instead . perfect results! moist, still a bit chewy and fat pieces of fudgy-cakey brownie! baked in 9x13 glass pan, greased with butter flavored crisco. baked around 30 minutes. start checking at 25 minutes.  increased the sugar by 1/4 cup, swapped butter flavored crisco for the oil, doubled the vanilla (again) doubled the salt and baking powder (again), covered the top with chopped pecans b4 baking. this will be my go-to recipe!

I had some overripe bananas and wanted to make chocolate banana brownies. I used this recipe and kept everything the same, except reduced sugar to 6 tbsp, added extra cocoa, cinnamon, and 2 medium bananas. Turned out delicious! I enjoyed it served with cool whip with some cinnamon sprinkled on top.

I needed a brownie recipe that did not call for butter, and this one came up.  I used a whole bag of walnuts.  Also, I used an ice cream scoop to fill a muffin pan with the batter and baked 15 minutes.  I love the edges of brownies, and this gave me some "edge" to every brownie!

Simple and delicious! I made exactly as directed and they turned out moist and yummy. the batter was a little thick so I thought I did something wrong but I guess that's how it's supposed to be.

They looked way more like the brownies I'm used too. My husband loved them so much he didn't want to share... and the ladies from my moms group enjoyed them as well.  I'm still looking for some more fudge like goodness but I'm new to this from scratch baking thing so I don't really know what to add or take away to get what I want... but they were yummy...

Love this recipe! I didn't have to spend extra time softening butter and I didn't have to wait an hour for them to bake. I doubled the recipe and baked them in a baking tray for a potluck. Great recipe overall!

I did use melted real butter and I doubled the recipe. I love walnuts but with a double recipe I think a cup is too many. I also recommend the toothpick test for brownies. Time didn't work for me, I had to leave it in longer. When the toothpick comes out without batter its ready to cool. Excellent homemade recipe!

I made these exactly as directed.  I wish I read the reviews first but I didn’t.  They cooked around the edges but the center stayed very wet and took forever to cook.  I would say I actually had to cook them for 40 minutes or so.  They were also very thin.  I’m wondering now if more baking powder would have helped make them a little thicker?  They did taste good (my fiancé ate 1/2 the pan) but I might try a different recipe next time.

Awesome recipe, but mine didn't come out fudgy, they came out cakey. I doubled the recipe and baked for 35 min. I also only used 3/4 cup of sugar and made a frosting from another recipe.

Followed the recipe to a T. They are very cakey, no fudgy-ness to them at all but there is a bit of moisture so it's not totally bone dry at least. I am not overly fond of the taste and would not say this produces better results than a boxed mix (which is what I was looking for). There was not a nice flake on top that you often see and really just looks and tastes like a chocolate cake. The creator does recommend using butter instead of oil for a rich and buttery taste, so perhaps that may amend this. Seems safe to say if you do not want cake-y brownies, try it with butter.

Really good brownies! Great for a late night craving. I had all the ingredients on hand,  which I think the average home baker would. The only changes I made was to add 1/4 teaspoon of instant coffee, and use a mix of cake flour and all purpose flour. I pretty much always add the equivalent of  however much salt the recipe calls for in instant coffee (so 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of instant coffee)  to any chocolate recipe to enhance the chocolate flavor. I didn't have quite a half cup of all purpose flour,  so I added  a couple of tablespoons of cake flour to make the half cup called for. 

This is a fudge type brownie that begs for ice cream on top. Even with the little bit of cake flour added,  these were still fudgy. If you prefer a cake like brownie,  I don't recommend this recipe. 

I agree with another reviewer that said they're kind of thin.  I didn't mind,  it just gave me an excuse to eat more! But just keep that in mind. Probably and 8x8 pan would be better.  Or maybe even a mini muffin pan. These would make awesome brownie bites! Just reduce the baking time. 

All in all, a solid fudge type brownie. Emergency sweet tooth satisfied!

People always ask me to make these.  When I'm out of any of the items, I look for alternatives like butter for oil, or applesauce for something else.  It always turns out amazing. Add a sliver of peanut butter or chocolate chips, or coconut pieces, it's really good. I also always make it with less sugar because the chocolate chips add in their own sweetness.

I made these tonight and followed the recipe to a tee. I used a glass 8x8 pan. They were very delicious but they did sink in the middle and only the sides rose up. Any ideas on why this could be ? They were fully cooked in the middle but it just sank.

(Semi Important Note. I added 1/2 cup of melted butter in place of the oil. It suggests this in the description) 
     This is the best brownie recipe that I have found in my years of baking, period. It is soft, fudgy, and it melts in your mouth wonderfully! One of the greatest parts about it is that it can sit over-night without becoming hard.  A lot of brownies that I have made in the past have done this so I was very pleased when this did not happen to this one. I highly suggest it for casual dinners when you want an easy from scratch desert without going to the trouble of a more advanced recipe. 
     There are two things in the making of this brownie that I suggest you do not do.
     (1) Do not over-bake this! It will become hard and dry if you do. Take it out of the oven when the edges start to pull away from the pan (it says this in the recipe). It will wiggle in the middle and there is a good chance that a toothpick inserted in the center will come out with some batter on it. This is okay, it will solidify while sitting.
     (2) Do not over mix this. If you do than the batter will be filled with air bubbles and it will be more cake-like.

     Overall, this recipe is fantastic and I highly suggest it!

1st time making a brownie and we jus loved it... Perfect texture... Chewy and fudgy. I doubled the recipe as i used a 9x13 dish and increased the timing to 35 mins... I see myself making this more often.

This is my new favorite brownie. I was looking for a recipe that used oil because it's much lower in saturated fat than butter. I followed the directions exactly and put walnuts on top. Moist, chocolaty, and delicious out of the oven. They get a little crunch if there's any remaining the next day or two which I like. I also like that the recipe just uses cocoa and not chocolate chips. It is more economical, yet doesn't impact flavor.

As per suggested I substituted the oil for 1 stick of unsalted butter, melted. This is one of the best brownie recipes ever.  For my mom I added one extra egg because she likes hers more cake like. came out perfect! Thanks Allrecipes

I chose this recipe because I was out of butter and margarine, but I was really craving brownies, so I tried this recipe. It tastes just like any other brownie recipe with butter or margarine, and it’s really good. So there I was, making brownies at 12am listening to Brittney Spears’ Toxic. they’re FERGALICIOUS although I had to put them back in the oven for 5 more minutes after I already put them in for 25 minutes. Perfect. And btw I also sprinkled tiny Reece’s Pieces on top for a little extra somethin

We like things really chocolately, so I increased the cocoa to just a little less than half a cup.  Used a clear glass 8 x 8 pan and the results were delicious.  Oh yea, had to increase cooking time to about 29 minutes.

I will definitely make this again. I needed a recipe that would accommodate my  lactose intolerant friend. And this turned out amazing. I did cut the sugar like one of the reviewer's suggested and I  increased the Coco to a half a cup and I also increased the baking soda to half a teaspoon and it rose really nicely.

No one in my family liked these. I think it’s the oil. Recommend a recipe that uses butter instead.

I added a 1/4 of  a cup of cool coffee to enhance the chocolate taste. I also added an extra egg for moisture, and a chopped up banana (rip) for more flavor.  This is a cheap, easy, and delicious recipe for beginners! I was so impressed. I already had all the ingredients right in my cupboards!

These brownies were amazing.  I made them exactly as the recipe  was written.  Left out the optional nuts cause my brother is allergic to them.  They were moist and chewy.  We all loved them.

Just made these today. I agree with the comment about following directions plus using correct pan size. Of course they r going to be dry and thin if u use a bigger baking dish than what is called for. I like “all recipes” site for help in cooking and baking. I love this recipe for easy brownies that are so delicious. I will use this recipe from now on. Happy baking.

We were heading over to my parents' tonight, and I made a batch of these to bring for a dessert. They were a hit with everyone: the parents, the teens,  and the grandparents. I will make these again. My suggestion is similar to others: make these in a 8x8 pan or double and put in a 9x13 pan. Very tasty.

these are the only brownies I've been making for years. they never fail me. the key is the just mix enough with a spoon  that flour and sugar mix are blended and then cook. if u like crust edges oil the dish well and u get a crunch around the edges. perfect recipe!

This is my go to brownie recipe. I have been using it for a couple of years now. I even used it for school (I'm attending culinary school) and everyone loved them. I use butter instead of oil, and I use real vanilla that I got from the Dominican Republic.

Not fudgy .. . Great taste but cake-like tender crumb and falls apart easily. I’m going to a cocoa based recipe rather than semisweet chips next batch.

This was easy to make and resulted in a brownie with good chocolate taste and good texture. I followed the recipe except I used cacao powder instead of cocoa.  I added chocolate chips but  they weren't really needed.  Next time, however, I might try some dark chocolate chips or chunks.

My recipes are packed away and we were looking for a similar recipe of my mother's that I grew up making...and I have made for over 45 years.  This is VERY close....though I do nto remember any baking powder in hers.   After making them I looked at some of the low star reviews... and feel the need to make a few comments.   Cake like:  skip the baking powder.  Oily/basking in oil:  ???? did not happen to me and never has.  Not rich enough: add a little more cocoa and/or add a pinch of instant coffee granules.   Prefer the box mix: Stick with your processed fast foods.
 Also, for brownies...do not over mix.   I only use a spoon to mix.  Blend oil/sugar/vanilla enough to be incorporated.  Add the eggs and again blend only enough to well incorporate.  Do the same with the dry.  As for cooking times... it will depend on your oven and the type of pan you use.    I did 4 stars only because I feel the baking powder can be skipped.

Canola oil instead of vegetable oil. Omitted nuts. Loved it.

These brownies are absolutely fabulous.  Made the recipe as listed with one small exception -- I used a little bit less sugar.   The brownies came out cakey and moist and absolutely delicious.  Next time I make this recipe I will have to double it as one batch isn't enough.
I did find that I had to bake them longer than 20-25 minutes.  I ended up baking them for 30 minutes and they came out perfectly.

Best brownies ever!! Followed another posters advice and used melted butter instead of oil.  Doubled the recipe and add chocolate chips.  Husband was impressed and asked me to save recipe.

Flavor good. A bit cakey and easily over baked at recommended time, I reduced to 16 minutes and still slightly over baked. I reduced the sugar by half, it was plenty sweet. Added a few tablespoons of hot coffee to ”bloom” the cocoa and bring out the flavor. (Admittedly the additional fluid may have contributed to cakey texture.)  converted 2 T oil to butter. Dark cocoa. 
Will try again with a bit less flour to make them fudgier.

It was ok. The oil rose to the top, so I blotted it off with a paper towel. Very, very thin, cookie like, so the middle was not fudgey at all. Flavor was good. Not sure I’ll try this one again, I’ll keep looking.

This recipe turned out amazing! Last time I tried homemade brownies it was a complete disaster. These ones were so moist and delicious! I added a little homemade chocolate frosting drizzle to the top as well as a pinch of powdered sugar. I had to hide them from my husband because he was going to eat them all!! :)

The only change I made was subbing butter for oil and doubling the recipe. My family ate a double batch in one night so they loved them. I liked the simplicity of the recipe.  I really liked the texture. Not too cakey or too chewy. But I thought they tasted a little salty like they had too much baking powder. Ingredients were measured precisely.... hmmm... i dunno... will probably try them again.

We were going to a party.  I didn't realize I didn't have a box of brownie mix in the house and took a chance on the recipe.  I even substituted gluten free flour. Used chocolate chips instead of walnuts.   Super big hit!  Chocolatey and moist.  Great recipe.  No more box mix for me!

*UPDATE* I  cut the chocolate  when I double this recipe  and they  turned out  perfect!

Great! Just how I like brownies. Fudgy. A little too dark chocolate for my crowd so next time I'll add less cocoa. But I loved them as is.

These brownies came out delicious.  The first round I made came outa little cake like but the second time I added peanut butter and they came out moist.  I made them in small muffin pans and they made for some amazing brownie bites.  They were a hit at work.  I will keep using this one

I used very good olive oil for the half cup of vegetable oil. I also went with ¾ cup of pure cane sugar instead of one cup. I added about 2 extra tablespoons of cocoa. Went with the chopped walnuts. Baked 25 minutes, best brownies ever. My wife also thought they were great.

I added a handful of semisweet chocolate chips instead of walnuts and they were fantastic.  I used an 8x8 glass baking dish and let them stay in for 5 minutes longer.

Made it twice it was simple and excellent. I highly recommend you use high end cocoa powder, Callebaut is worth the cost.  These would make a nice hot fudge brownie dessert.

I love fudgy brownies, and these fit the bill. I did everything according to the recipe, adding pecans instead of walnuts, and also breaking up a holiday peppermint candy bar to add as well. Delicious! They're a few hours old, and 80% of the pan is gone, so this is definitely a keeper!

I’ve made these twice and they’re so easy and yummy! I love that they use cocoa powder & oil instead of melting chocolate chips & butter. I substituted the sugar with Truvia Baking Blend for a less sugar version and they turned out great. I highly recommend doubling this receipt, because otherwise the brownies are super thin and not as moist. I suppose another option would be to use a smaller pan! I will def make this again!

YUM! I made these on a whim because I had all of the ingredients on hand and they are delicious. Based on the reviews, I subbed butter for the oil and added a handful of dark chocolate chips to the batter. Other changes I made were using rice flower instead of wheat flour so they were gluten-free and I melted the sugar in the butter before mixing. They won't last long so go ahead and double the recipe!

Excellent and simple! This is the first from scratch brownies that I have enjoyed. Super simple and using oil is so quick and easy. Just baked and cooled my first batch and delicious and don't need to be iced or powder sugared. This is a keeper!! These will be gone by tonight.

I made it exactly as written.  My husband loved it, and had 2 large slices!   I gave it 4 stars, because, for my new oven, it took 29 minutes.  And I thought it could have used 2 more minutes.  They were chewy, and gooy as promised.  The flavor was good.  I thought it needed a little less sugar.  I might try a 1/4 cup less, next time.  Thanks for the recipe, and I will be making it again.  I'm sure my oven was a little off, since it took so long to cook, and I know cooking times can vary, for different reason. Thanks for the recipe.

I loved it and brought home an empty pan. I doubled the recipie  and used melted butter instead of oil. The next time I make this I will add the cocoa up front with the oil and sugar. I had some difficulty blending the cocoa as the last ingedient to add.  My oven is hot so at 16 minutes I pulled out the 9X13 pan. Iced it with home made cream cheese icing and sprinkled pecan pieces on top.

Be careful if you use extra large eggs. I doubled the recipe and used extra large eggs. They ended up puffy and cake like. The second time I doubled it I used only 3 eggs and cooked 18 min for a 8 by 12 inch pan. Much fudgier and solo good.

Yum...My fav brownie recipe. I've been making these since highschool. Forever ago.
(Betty Crocker recipe). I only use 1 egg. I reduce the flour to 1/4 c. And because I'm a chocoholic I increase the cocoa to 1/2 c. 
Can't ever go wrong with this recipe!

The only change I made was to use butter-flavored Crisco (sticks), because I didn't have any vegetable oil on-hand. Otherwise, I made the brownies as directed & they were fabulous! Definitely keeping this recipe for when I need a quick dessert! Thanks!

Loved this recipe!  I used unsalted butter, instead of vegetable oil, which I whisked with the sugar and vanilla to make sure sugar dissolved. Instead of nuts I added @ 1/3 cup 42% Cacao Chips. Baked in an 8x8 pan for 30 minutes.  Dusted with powdered sugar! Delicious! I will be making these again and again.

This recipe was made last minute before going to a friend's house to watch a football game. I was able to easy throw this together in a couple of minutes and bake. Everyone at the game loved them. There isn't much batter with this recipe so they turned out a little thinner than I expected, but they're so delicious it doesn't matter.

These are the best from scratch brownies I've ever made! I used infused coconut oil for shortening and they are perfectly chewy,  moist, yet a thin crisp layer on top.  I didn't have a 9x9 pan, so I used my favorite ceramic pie pan.   I cooked for 35 minutes and then cut into pie slice portions! Thank you Sarah for recipe!!

I followed the recipe word by word,  but reduced the amount of sugar that it asked for and skipped the walnuts, but I can't deny that the result was pretty impressive! It was moist and fudgy, with a perfect crisp top! Everything that a brownie should be!

I made this recipe with some substitutions. I used coconut sugar instead of white sugar, and used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil . i also used 1/4 cup oat flour and 1/4 of all purpose flour, and added 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips, I usually add in  some avocado but didn't have any on hand. I baked them in a mini muffin tray to make "two bite brownies" and cooked them for 10-12 min

If you make them - the video calls for baking soda and the recipe calls for baking powder. Use the baking POWDER. :) 
I found these while trying to find something easy that my 13yr old and I could make together. They were relatively easy and YUMMY! 
The only reason for the 4 stars is the mix up with the video recipe and the written. Otherwise, great recipe!

I love not only how easy these are to make but how tasty they are. They are, at least for me, the perfect mix of cakey and fudgey, as well as sweet and chocolatey. Of course the addition of a little coffee into the mix heightened the chocolateyness of them. I think the fudgeyness was helped by me using half oil and half melted butter. I think next time I make them and there will be a next time I will use a little less sugar, but other than that these are amazing brownies.

I agree with the majority - great recipe.  I personalized it by adding 1/4 cup sweetened cocoa powder, 1 more tablespoon butter, and 1/4 teaspoon mint flavoring.  And 1 1/4 cup chocolate chips.  It turned out a light but chewy brownie.

I just made these brownies, and am incredibly impressed. I've been craving good brownies for months (while pregnant), and these hit the spot. My favorite part of this recipe is that I had all ingredients on hand. Very easy, and super yummy! Also, I used an 8x8 baking dish and they were perfect.

Good, simple, tasty recipe.  I baked mine in an 8x8¨ pan and they turned out to be a nice size.  My only problem was with the baking time, I use an oven thermometer and it was done before the suggested time.

I have never been disappointed whether I use butter or oil or a combination, always consistent. Failure is usually related to technique, I mix the fat and cocoa first, then add sugar and then one egg at a time, flour, baking powder and salt go last.

This is my go-to brownies recipe. Easy, small batch, and oil based. They work every time.

This is one of the easiest brownies recipes ever. It makes a small pan (8x8) but I have doubled it to good effect. I make it so often that I've memorized the ingredients. Moist and delicious, with or without nuts.  I usually take about a tablespoon's-worth of the sugar out, since I don't like my desserts too sweet.

The only thing I changed was the veggie oil - I melted butter and used that instead. Definitely not too sweet, and they were moist in good way :) Will make again for sure, but a double batch!

My husband and I have almost finished the whole pan in one day! My only change was that I made it with melted butter instead of oil. Truly, these are the best, most fudgy, chocolatey brownies I have EVER tasted! And that includes the  Betty Crocker mix brownies- because those are delicious. I never need to look for another recipe again! These have that delicious top brownie lovers so covet, and a center that is to die for.

Very tasty. Instead of the vegetable oil I used melted butter. It took a little longer than 25 minutes in my oven but they looked and tasted great. The batter is quite thick and does not spread well. I used an 8x8 pan and they are thin. I worry t using a 9x9 as suggested would make the brownies very thin.

I made it as is no changes. I've never swapped oil for butter in brownies and while I'm sure it's good, oil works just as well. This recipe is a great standard brownie recipe.

I doubled the recipe and baked in a brownie pan.  Batter is rather thick.  Spread thinly on pan.  Better after they have cooled down.

Going by a number of reviews, I made changes: doubled it everything but used only 3 eggs, not 4. Used melted butter, not oil.  I ground some sea salt on the batter right before I spread it in the pan. I ended up baking it for about 35 minutes.   It's good, but not as amazing as a recipe I made last year (which I can't find).  Next time I think I'll sub half the sugar with brown sugar, and also might throw in some mini chocolate chips.

I could fry an entire chicken from the oil that came off of these cooked brownies. I should have known something was wrong when the batter slid in one glob into the pan, not leaving a trace of batter in the bowl. I followed the recipe exactly but these were a huge disappointment. They're currently sitting on a paper towel trying to drain some of the oil off, but I don't think they're salvageable. Don't waste your ingredients on this recipe.

If you follow this recipe exactly with  only 2 adjustments, you will have the most delicious, rich, and perfect moist brownies. 1) I switched out white sugar for brown sugar. And 2) This may sound weird, but I swear by it! Add 1 heaping tablespoon of mayo into the batter and mix well. This one step makes all the difference in how moist your cakes and brownies will turn out.

I've made these brownies 3x this week and finally figured out how to get the brownie that I want. 

The changes I made were:

-beat eggs and sugar for a few minutes until pale yellow and thick. Do this first before adding the remaining ingredients. This creates a nice crust on top of brownies.

-Use butter instead of oil for more flavor

-I added 1 tsp of instant coffee granules to give brownies oomp 

-Use 8x8 pan lined with parchment paper and reduced the baking time.

These were just OK. They were much too light and airy for my taste. I like brownies to be dense and fudgy, and these were definitely not. On the positive side, they were super-fast to whip up.
On the whole, not worth it.

Very hard to find a tasteful brownie recipe. These brownies are so yummy! I never added nor did I take any ingredient away. Me and my family love these brownies! The last time I followed a brownie recipe online, turned out to be little cake bites. (yuck) lol
Thank you for sharing your recipe :0) 
I am making another batch tonight!

This is absolutely the BEST brownie recipe I have ever made. They are so moist and delicious, and I covered them with chocolate brownie frosting, which made them even better! Thank you so much for this recipe- it is definitely my go-to from now on!

I doubled the recipe and it came out great, will definitely make again. Seemed a little dry but could be the pan I used, will experiment in the future and probably add fudge.

Substituted melted butter for the oil, and made a "double" batch in a 9-inch pan, which seems about the right amount for a normal sized batch of brownies.  I'm obsessed with these, and so is my whole family.  I've literally made them 3 times since discovering this recipe last week. Pretty sure I'll never need another brownie recipe again.  These are perfect in my book--perfectly chewy, but not too fudgy or cakey, with a slight crackly shine on top.  Yum!

These came out pretty okay. They were nicely goey inside with a good texture. However,  I think due to the amount of sugar and mixed with the oil it made the top brownie layer a little too sugarary crispy. I was looking for more of that shiney top layer that boxed brownies have. Also, these are missing something. There isn't enough of that yummy chocolate flavor that you get with boxed brownies. So it's not a bad recipe but I don't think I would use this one again. Note, I made these exactly as instructed, no substitutions to the recipe. I did use an 8x8 since I didn't have 9x9 and that only made them slightly thicker which i was good with.

I've made these brownies twice now. Both times I used jaggery and the second time I added mint extract and a tea bag full of dried peppermint leaves but left out the salt. So good! I will definitely be making them again. This is so easy and perfect for those times when I am craving brownies. Thank you!

I used butter, increased cocoa  powder (Valhona) to shy 1/2 cup, added 1 generous teaspoon expresso powder and increased vanilla to 2 tsp's. I used 9x9 pan. I prefer a thinner brownie. I buttered pan and parchment paper for easy removal. Baked for 19 minutes. So easy and fast. I was shocked how good these were. More cocoa based on reviews was right decision. I generally add expresso to heighten and expand taste of chocolate anything. Gone before totally cooled. This will be my go to brownie.

I honestly thought that I wasn't gonna like it but I did. If you don't have vegetable oil feel free to use grapeseed oil that's what I used and they turned out fine. :)

These were a hit! I added in vanilla chips. The only problem was there wasn't enough batter for them to be super thick :) So yummy! So may double the recipe next time.

My husband is a brownie freak. He actually told me they were better than his moms.  Umm... Those are from a box, but hey, boxed brownies are awesome.  So needless to say these are way better than premixed brownies. I live in Texas so I'm not sure if this had anything to do with the cook time, i had to bake for an extra 15 minutes. They were still extremely moist and delicious!! I'm actually baking another doubled batch now.

This is far and away the best brownie recipe I've ever made.  My tweak with the recipe was  to use raw cacao powder instead of cocoa.  I added an extra 1/8 tsp vanilla because the batter seemed to need it with the cacao.   I'll definitely make this many times and try some of the changes that other reviewers have made.  I especially like the idea of butterscotch and white chocolate bits.

The last time I had made this I had doubled the mix, but instead of putting 4 eggs I put only 2 and it came out so delicious, And I had made it like 5 other times so this will be the 6, And I honestly think that this is one of the best brownies I have ever made

So I made these with butter instead of oil, tasted the batter and thought they needed more sugar. So I put an additional 1/4 cup sugar. I also threw in some chocolate chips, hence the craters. :) Anywho, this is an awesome recipe. I'll be making it again for sure. Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe!

This is just insanely easy and SO GOOD. Yes, lots of sugar- but it is brownies. I made a batch for my boys exactly this way and tested it - very yummy. So I made a batch with GF flour (I am avoiding because the baby seems to spit up more with dairy and wheat) and they turned out great, too! So, again- so very, very easy and I will use it all the time now for whatever occasion. Thank you!

The perfect go-to brownie recipe. Fudgy and dense with a lovely flakey top. My 14 year old daughter whips these up herself. Quick and easy and more importantly, DELICIOUS! We leave out the nuts and the texture is perfect! Thanks for a great recipe. :)

I thought these were great.  The only changes I made were I doubled it and used a 9x13 pan, and just for the heck of it I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.

I didn't use walnuts as I didn't have any and I substituted half the oil (I used olive oil because it was all I had) for melted butter. Left in the the oven for 25mins because I had a 8x8 dish. Came out great! And so moist. I added sprinkles and dusted powdered sugar on top. Will make this my main brownie recipe.

Incredible. I read another review that suggested doubling and cooking in a 9x13 for 35 minutes, and they turned out perfectly. Fudgey, great flavor, and SO easy to make. Highly recommend.

These were SO good. I'm definitely using this recipe again. I doubled and put in a 9X13 pan. I used 1/2 vegetable oil and 1/2 butter. I baked it for 30 minutes. They aren't too cakey or too fudgy. The texture is perfect for me. Instead of nuts, I added 1 cup of mini Reece's Pieces. I just hate that I only got to try one of these (and some crumbs), because I made them for our local fire department. I'm sure they'll enjoy them.

These were awful, sad to say.  I only used 1/2c sugar and 1 egg.. Mine came out crumbly and dry. I only baked for 15 minutes. My husband loves chocolate and says he likes them but these were not moist or fudgey at all. :-(

food-gasmic sinfulness right here! OMGosh so rich, so chocolatey and such orbital bliss. Just watch how much walnuts you add. Other then that....happy dance with a scoop of Butter Pecan Ice Cream and a drizzle of Caramel Topping and you will find yourself hiding in the corner away from others. Amazing! I put mine in an 8x8 square pan and got 4 nice thick brownies. Will make again.

Ive made this 8 times now, i made them into cupcakes, into a cake. It an easy recipe that i will use for a while. My brother loves them more than anything i usally add a little bit more vanilla extract to give it a kick. I tried to use a substute for the sugar so the rest of my family can enjoy them but it always end up burning.

It was good, not amazing but I'll probably make again because it was easy. I see mixed reviews between it being crispy and gooey. I cut into them right when I pulled them out and they were perfect so I immediately dumped them onto a cold platter because I felt letting them cool in the hot pan would have caused them to over cook and get tough. I would suggest pulling them out early or transferring them to a cool dish immediately after getting them from the oven.

I substituted butter for the oil, like another member suggested and it was wonderful! Another review mentioned that the sugar made the brownies kindof gritty, so, as another member suggested, I melted the butter first and added the sugar to the melted butter until it was a paste like texture and my brownies turned out amazing! Not gritty at all! Far better than any store bought  or box mix brownie that I've ever had!

Surprisingly perfect! I thought brownies needed butter to turn out fudgy and dense, but oil sure does the job. This is the best recipe ever. I followed all the steps and a tip from a reviewer: don't beat the egg too much. I Incorporated the ingredients very slowly. Really economic recipe because in Brazil butter is a little expensive. Thank you so much! I will make this recipe my standard. Everyone should try it!

From first impressions it looked wonderful.All moist and fudgy so I left it to cool anticipating how wonderful it would taste. I cut them into neat little squares. Then I noticed they were getting hard and dry so I tasted ...the texture was horrible.Stiff and very dry. Will not be making these again.

Who knew brownies could be this good and this easy.  This is the first time I've ever made brownies from scratch and they are by far the best brownies I've ever eaten.  I used butter instead of oil like someone else recommended and the chocolate baking powder i used was special dark.  I also doubled the recipe which required an additional 15 min of cook time.  I will never buy boxed brownies again.  They are subpar compared to these.  I've eaten almost the entire double batch in 2 days.  They are so good I actually feel sick I've eaten so much of it.

Doubled it and baked it in a 9x13.  I used melted coconut oil along with grape seed oil. It was a hit - down to the last crumb. I will definitely be coming back to this recipe.

It is the taste that counts. I didn't have any butter, so I found this recipe and decided to try it. It didn't come out looking perfect, but it definitely tasted perfect. The only difference I made was I used a 8'8 in. pan. I would definitely make this recipe again.

I have been experimenting and searching for a few years to find my definition of the perfect brownie using powdered cocoa. This is it. First, I used high quality (read expensive) alkalized/Dutch cocoa. I also used the melted butter option, and stirred  1/4 c. semi sweet chocolate chips into the batter. The brownies are deep-flavored, not too sweet, smooth, and fudgy, with a delicate top.

I tried this recipe. Everything was great! However I baked it in a deep dish because when I cut my brownies I wanted them to be thick. I let them bake for 25 minutes however they came out really crumbly almost like chocolate cake. This was my first time baking from scratch and I am in a rush so I cut them into squares and everything completely fell apart. I don't know if it was because of the deep dish or because I didn't wait for them to cool but now I have brownie cake mix and just gonna try to make them into brownie balls.

The first time making these, I accidentally used twice the recommended amount of butter. They actually came out really fudgy and ended up delicious when chilled.

The second time, I did it right and they came out very firm and cakelike. There was no crumbling.

The recipe is not overwhelmingly chocolatey. I might add more cocoa or even melted chocolate in the future.

I'm not a baker but was craving brownies and had all of the ingredients for this recipe on hand. Made exactly as written except I baked in an 8x8 pan as I couldn't find my 9x9 pan and used Canola oil instead of vegetable oil. Added 5 minutes to the cooking time (30 minutes total) and they came out perfect.  Thanks for submitting this yummy recipe!

I also doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan & bakedfor 35 min. They came out perfect. They're very sweet for my liking, but very delucuous & moist. Next time I may subsitute a little bit of old coffee for some of the oil & bump up the cocoa powder.

these were great! the only thing is the recipe called for 9x9 pan, all I had was 8x8 so I adjusted my cooking time (about 10 minutes longer) and it still came out perfect but my brownies were pretty thin so I can't imagine how they wouldve come out in a 9x9 pan? either way they were delicious and I'll make them again. mine were not the prettiest but who cares!

THESE BROWNIES ARE AMAZING! OhMyGoodness! I made these one night when I was bored, and looking for a brownie recipe that only required two eggs, and they are a huge hit in my family! (the only concern I had was that when I made them, the 20-25 mins of baking did not seem to be satisfactory. I ended up baking them for almost 45 mins >.

Yummy! I have been looking for a brownie recipe that called for cocoa, and this one's a keeper! Chewy center, crunchy edges, and perfectly chocolatey! I doubled the recipe, then baked it in a 9 x 13 pan for 35 minutes. Can't wait to try this recipe with different toppings and baking chips! p.s. my boyfriend just ate his third brownie in less than 5 minutes! ;)

Amazing brownies! My dormmates and team love it! I used Hershy's 100%  special dark cocoa powder to give the depth and richness of dark chocolate. I have also found that the brownies come out pretty thin, so I doubled the recipie and baked it in a 9x9x2 in pan for 35-45 mins or until the batter doesn't jiggle when you shake it. Lastly, I personally think that the walnuts don't add much to the brownies as they become soft and you don't really feel the crunch.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  I only had a 8x8 pan, so I baked for the full 25 minutes. Brownie are very good, not dry, very soft and chocolaty! No frosting is needed.  I will definitely make it again.

They have been put off my other attempts to make healthy cakes, etc so this was a good tempter to get them back into cakes, slices and with less invasive attempts to slip in healthier ingredients later. I cut that down, put a tad more oil, one less egg and some milk. Let's see how it goes this second attempt.

 Also, the recipe should be double what's on the page. I made it according to the amounts here (1/2 cup flour, 2 eggs, etc) and it was way too little for the cake tin or the tummies.  Second time round, I'm doubling it all.

I doubled the recipe and the batter was very thick and not smooth. The top of the brownies looked pretty bad. I added a cup of chocolate chips, which helped boost the taste. I was expecting fudgy brownies and these turned out cake-like. They were okay, but not awesome.

I made no changes and it was perfect! Lined the pan with foil, which kept the bottom and insides moist, while the top was crusty and crisp. I would make it many more times, but I think that would ruin my new year's resolutions. :)

Made exactly as directed with the help of my 8 year old grandaughter and they were amazing! We gave her one with icecream, whip cream and sprinkles. Amazing recipe and a great time for us!

I used melted butter and they were wonderful! I did have a bit of trouble with the cook time but I think that was mostly oven and climate issues. Big hit with the fella!

I've made these brownies ever since I found this. I really don't know how many times I've made them, but everytime I do they're gone that day. I can't save even one. I recently got a new phone and all the recipes I saved on my old one are gone but today I'm making brownies and the only recipe I want is this one.

This is my go to brownie recipe and I've made it probably 50 times or more.  It is always a huge hit and they do not last long.  The rich chocolatey taste from using cocoa is divine.  After having these, even the yummy Ghiradelli brownies in a box don't compare. Must note, the only thing I do different is I use real dairy butter instead of oil.  I believe that makes a huge difference in flavor also.  When I first made it I did use the oil so my rating is for the recipe as written as well as my butter adjustment.

Love these, I do wonder if it is possible to add extra baking powder to rise them a little more. I always add a little peanut butter which makes them even better!

I substituted generic Splenda for the sugar and butter for the oil, and put them in a pie tin as I don't have a 9×9 and they were delicious!  I used the beaters pretty seriously and the consistency was more like a Texas cake but I'll do it again!

This was the first time I'd made brownies from scratch and wow, were these good. I followed the recipe exactly, although I did bake it for a little more time than suggested because for some reason, they weren't completely done by the 25 minute mark. Perhaps it had something to do with my oven being electric. They were were soft and chocolaty beneath a crunchy top layer. I didn't mind the amount of batter I ended up with, since I prefer smaller batch recipes. I would make this again.

I have made these at least eight times now!!! My family LOVES them. I always double the recipe and swap butter for the oil to accommodate my family of five. It yields a thicker brownie as well.

just doubled it and and added 1/2 almond extract because I like the taste with chocolate.  I like that I can make this without butter which I don't always have, but I always have oil.

I've made these lot's of times & as any cook can imagine I've had to use what was on hand more than once.  Pecans;  I'll stick with them, they're  a preference and I have a tree.  Oil;  I have several to choose from generally but for this recipe I always go for almond oil - I like nut oils for lots of reasons and almond oil fills the bill with chocolate. MMMM  MMM Good is right! As an aside on the "thinness of these baked in a 9 X 9 inch pan,"  I say this is the correct size for a variety of applications other than simply wolfing them down-not that I haven't been guilty of that myself.

Perfect. I doubled the recipe and cooked for 35 minutes in 9x12 pan. I also followed a previous reviewer's advice to heat oil and add sugar to it.

I tried this recipe without modifications and ended up with a 'soupy' result.than that.  I'd recommend increasing the flour to 1 cup.  Optionally increase to three eggs as well.  Finally, I'd add 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda for a little more leavening.

Yummy! I had a brownie recipe I've been making for years but I needed to make one with vegetable oil so I could use a home-made infused oil. I searched for it and this one came up with tons of great reviews. I actually compared it to my recipe I had and it was close to identical, except for melted butter/vegetable oil and self-rising flour/all-purpose flour+baking powder. So I just substituted the homemade oil and used my self-rising flour I had and it came out great.

These turned out great.  I used the melted butter in place of the oil.  I also like the fact that the recipe calls for cocoa powder rather than bar chocolate, since I always have that on hand.  Yum!

Um... I might have had 5 of these in the first sitting.  I thought they were heaven.  My husband thought they were 'good.'  (What?!)  Made them just as directed.  Baked 20 minutes.  Perfection.

Did not enjoy this recipe at all; it was super bland and very cake like. Also does not call for enough cocoa.

Really Great!  I did not use walnuts, instead, when the brownies where ready I put some chocolate chips on the top.

I made this with the 1/4 cup melted butter I had and used hazelnut oil for the rest and mixed half the batter with chopped, toasted walnuts. It came out gooey and fudgey. My friends loved them and went back for more and the 9 of us finished it all. Even in a 8x8" pan it was rather thin so next time I will use 1.5 times the recipe for a thicker brownie and perhaps use all butter to see if it's better. My top had little air bubbles from the baking powder but the next day it looked better with a bit of a shiny crackled top.

I used butter and reduced the temperature to 160 (but I have a combi oven) to make them gooier. I also added about 1/2 tablespoons of nutella to the mix and scattered frozen raspberries over the top. Best brownies I've ever had

Wow! Making these was the first time I've ever baked anything from scratch.. like seriously ever. And I thought I was totally going to screw it up. But this recipe was perfect! They came out totally chewy and delicious! If even I could do it without screwing it up, you know yours will turn out amazing! Five stars!

Put in a little extra flour and baked 5 min longer.  But would follow as directed next time, for more moisture.  Wanted a flavorful recipe w/o milk or butter.

I don't usually do recipe reviews, and had to join site to write this.

Wow!  I made these on the fly one evening before my husband came home from work, and I couldn't keep his hand out of them.  Thank you Sarah for the awesome recipe.  

I doubled the recipe, used butter as suggested, added a cup of chocolate chips, and cooked 15-20 minutes longer.

Perfect, easy, fast... and Oh So Good~

This is a really awesome recipe !!!! I would highly recommend it for everyone. It's really simple to make and all the ingredients were lying around my house.  And the baking time is not even long.  What's even better is that it tastes great!!!! I love when the brownie has a flaky crust on top and this recipe has it.  Plus, it's nice and moist and chewy.  I also add some of cashew nuts and it's soo good !!!!

I've made these brownies alot.  It is a classic recipe and everybody always loves them. Over the years I have sometimes varied the recipe.  Sometimes I substitute almonds for the walnuts and then use almond extract instead of vanilla. This variation is also a big hit.  In fact, we have a street party every year and my neighbors demand that I make them this way.  My kids however prefer the original recipe but without the walnuts.  They like me to put M&M's on top. My husband loves Terry's Chocolate Orange.  One year for his birthday I used orange extract and instead of nuts put pieces of Terry's Chocolate Orange on the top.  He loved it! Regardless of how I do it, they always disappear fast.

My family and I love this recipe! The brownie  is perfectly chewy yets it's very moist. The batter is a really odd consistency and I was kind of worried they would come out all funky. But they were great and we'll definetly be making the again!

These brownies are the best I've ever had! I wanted brownies and had cocoa powder so I searched and came across this recipe. I added a little bit of melted peanut butter to the batter before baking and they were so good! I have some in the oven now! :) go now and make these brownies!!

Mmmm Mmmm Better Brownies turned out very moist and dense when I baked them for the first time on my boat this evening.  They attracted a buddy from across the dock who stayed for a nice long friendly chat.  I added chopped pecans and decorated the top of the pan with halves.  The brownies turned out super dark as I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa.  Adding chocolate chips would have been overkill as the brownies are almost molten, almost a lava cake coming hot out of the oven.

The flavor was good. I added 1/4 cup semi sweet mini chocolate chips. Baked in a 8x8 glass Pyrex greased with butter. Used 1/4 cup of oil and 1/4 softened butter. Baked for 28 min and center was completely gooey. I know I used a different size pan but these would have been flat pancakes in 9x9. Probably won't be making these again

I halved the recipe because I only had 1 egg and a small amount of oil but they still turned out good! I also used a loaf pan instead of a 8x8 because I didn't want super thin brownies with the smaller batter. It took almost 2x as long to bake because of the small pan but they were moist and chocolate-y just as I had wanted. My only compliant was a lack of depth....it's a very simple, fudge-y chocolate brownie. Next time I'll add chocolate chips and maybe some coffee!

I love this so much but the only thing that I would change is add about 4 tablespoons of milk. It makes the brownies taste so much better. And be sure not to over cook them or they just taste horrible. But other than that I make them all the time it's so easy and so good.

For years I've been making melted-chocolate chip brownies to get that fudge texture and that deep chocolate flavor.   Now?  This is my go-to recipe for brownies.  They are absolutely delicious and perfectly moist and fudgey.  I especially recommend adding the walnuts — so good!!

These were the perfect solution to our late night baked good craving. I made these with 100% whole spelt flour, used grass-fed butter instead of oil and used a muffin tin to make 12 separate muffin-brownies. 25 minutes was the perfect baking time and they turned out really great, not overly sweet, with a crispy top and a soft fudgy interior. Will definitely be one of my go-to brownie recipes from now on. Perhaps next time will add in some chocolate chips or maybe make a frosting. Yum!

Fabulous! So simple as well. I used butter, as I always do. I think shortening is disgusting. I think some of the people that review these recipes don't know how to cook. I read that one person forgot the baking powder but "didn't think that would have made enough difference to not make them turn out well"  (DUH)

It was an okay recipe. Somehow, even though I only added a pinch of salt, they came out very salty. They were delicious still. Perfect with a glass of milk. I didn't have a square pan so I made them in a round cake pan. They still came out pretty good. Brownie cake anyone? I had some cream cheese, and I used a very simple recipe to make some frosting. I didn't add it directly to the brownies because my brother is allergic to cream cheese, but it was delicious.

It tasted great! I mixed up the recipe tho. Instead of vegetable oil I replaced it with extra virgin olive oil. Also, instead of 1 cup or sugar, I did 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 of cup of crushed almonds. I did not add any salt of vanilla extract.

Took this to a friends house who was recently told she couldn't have dairy.  Both her and her husband loved them!  I personally think they are better than the story bought version. More fudgey and moist!  I did the brownies exactly as stated and they were a little "thin" I guess but so rich that it didn't matter.

Um... YUM!!!  Why do I ever bother with box mixes?  This is so yummy and easy.  Going to make up a couple of individual batches in canning jars and keep them in the pantry so I can just grab and add the wet ingredients next time.  I used melted butter instead of the oil and omitted nuts, due to personal taste.

This is one of the easiest brownies to make and the taste is so delicious! I didn't have white sugar so I used brown. Also, I used canola oil instead of the vegetable one since I didn't have the latter. All in all, it was so good. Thank you for sharing the recipe! :)

So... What the heck? I made these brownies hoping to use them to make brownies sundaes for my family, and they turned out with the texture of gum and wouldn't chew into smaller pieces no matter how long you worked on it. I used butter instead of vegetable oil to make the brownies rich and buttery like the recipe said, but along with being WAY too chewy and inedible, butter was leaking out of them when I took them out of the pan and even after pouring extra oil out of the pan while they  were baking, butter still boiled on top of them while cooking. I could literally mold the brownies into shapes. After making them I realized that I did forget eggs, but I CANNOT imagine that just forgetting eggs would make them like that.

Fantastic! I used a mix of softened butter and oil and added walnuts and these turned out as the perfect fudgy brownie. I made these for my husband's birthday while at my in-laws and they all agreed this is our new go to brownie recipe.

Just made these and just tasted them- AMAZING!!  I did add the 1/2 cup of chopped nuts per the recipe and I also added 1/3 cups of chocolate-this last part was likely unnecessary as it made the brownies *slightly* gooier than I really wanted (and I like my brownies gooey)-  and I subbed 1/2 cup of butter for the oil per the suggestions in the comments.  I baked in an 8x8 pan for 30 minutes.  I was skeptical but after a small bite, I'm a believer.

AMAZING recipe! these brownies were delicious, used frylight sunflower oil and brown sugar instead of vegetable oil and white sugar- DELICIOUS. added marshmallows to the batch a couple of minutes before taking them out and served with vanilla ice cream. perfect- had a craving for chocolate and these were quick, simple and in and out of the oven. FAB.

I was looking for a recipe for a late night chocolate fix, and my go to recipes for brownies is usually Brooke's Bombshell Brownies and Best Brownies, both from this site, and both are excellent, but both require butter which I was out of. I used the ingredient search feature to find a brownie recipe that used oil instead of butter, and this gem of a recipe popped up! It really is a gem! Quick, cheap, tasty, easy, and uses ingredients I always have on hand. I made them exactly as written, with the addition of a teaspoon of instant mocha coffee powder and about a half cup of chocolate chips(instead of nuts)...I was REALLY craving chocolate! lol I served them warm out of the oven, topped with coffee ice cream. Yum! I always made brownies on special occasions only, because butter has really become an expensive ingredient(almost $5 a pound at walmart!). Now I can have brownies anytime I want! Thank you so much for my new go-to brownie recipe! :)

I LOVED these brownies. They were the perfect fudgy and didn't seem uncooked, but not a cake consistency. I have been in desperate hope to find THE recipe I wanted since one of the boxed recipes changed. These are by far the best brownies I have ever had.  right now i would not change a thing about the recipe, but this was my first time making them.

t's my "go to" brownie recipe!  Also good with butter, but I prefer to use oil...

Cutting down the sugar is perfectly fine  (3/4 c).  I love to 'add stuff,' too! Like a lot of other people have already mentioned... 
One thing I LOVE to do, when the brownies are cooled down, is to met some chocolate and drizzle over the top, for decoration, and then to add whatever sprinkles on top, for a special occasion, like a birthday... Easter... etc. I often make them and give them away as a 'present' to my students, who LOVE brownies!
These are very fudgey, which I prefer over cakey!

I AM IN LOVE! These were by FAR the best brownies i have ever made. I used butter and the brownies were melt in your mouth delicious. My pan was really wide and the batter only filled up 2/3 of the pan when i poured it in so i was really nervous,  but then when I took them out, they had filled the entire pan ann were perfect. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe and i will now always use this

Best alternative to brownies with dairy in them! Being allergic to dairy, I can no longer eat box-made brownies. I dare say these taste better than the box brand!

This recipe was great. Very yummy. I used self rising flour because I didn't have all purpose but they turned out wonderful anyway. I would make these again. Also used an 8x8 pan and they were not thin at all.

Delicious!  I made them with 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup oil as suggested by the author.  I also added 1/2 cup chocolate chips at the end... my family ate them in one sitting, and wanted more.  Definitely a keeper.

These are really GOOD!!! Don't get me wrong, this is a really good recipe. The brownies were really chewy and very chocolatey. This is my first time using this recipe and they were a complete success!! My family loved them. I usually use a different recipe that requires chocolate chips, but I didn't have any at that time, so I looked for a substitute and these are great! This recipe is definitely a keeper. When I don't have chocolate chips, I'll make these, when I do I'll stick to my recipe. If you're looking for a recipe that doesn't include making a mess by melting chocolate, then this is the recipe you're looking for. I suggest that people use the melted butter instead of oil,really good, also I didn't add the baking powder because I wanted the brownies to be chewy and fudgey, and it worked. So if you don't like dry cakey brownies I suggest leaving the baking powder out. I topped these with "creamy chocolate frosting" and melted the butter instead so the frosting would be fudgey and shiny, it worked out great!!! I will make these again, i think everyone should try this recipe.

I love this recipe it is a big hit at parties and at home. If you want your brownie gooeyer take it out a little early. For coffee lovers try putting 2 tablespoons of instant coffee mix in it. I just made it like that today and my mom loved it,

After dinner craving + cocoa powder= grateful I found this recipe.  20 min was perfect when using a 9x9 pan.  They came out thin, but dense and fudgy.  They were so easy to put together!  I whipped them up by hand- no mixer required!  Take the time to really whip the oil, eggs and sugar; and then fold in the dry ingredients. The only flaw was on my part, I added a bit too much vanilla and it overwhelmed the cocoa taste. I lined my pan with parchment and they were a since to take out of the pan.  My days of making bad brownies is over!

I thought this Recipe was simple & easy... The brownies came out of the pan and were very moist and delicious... I added to the batter some mini chocolate morsels instead of Walnuts because I didn't have any Walnuts on hand...

The kids loved these brownies, I didn't care for them much, in my opinion the box brownies are far more delicious. I doubled the recipe and baked in 9x13 pan for 40 mins they looked very good and since the kids loved them i gave them 4 stars for me it would be 2 stars tho! (yes i used melted butter instead of oil)

These were delicious- moist, rich, fudgey, with the classic slightly flaky top. I followed some other reviewers' suggestions: I used 1/4 C oil and 1/4C melted butter. I heated the oil, and with the hot melted butter, the sugar dissolved perfectly (no gritty texture). I also added a little more than 1/4C semi-sweet chocolate chips before transferring to the pan. The only reason I'm not rating 5 starts is that they do come out thin… under one inch. Maybe this would be better with an 8X8 pan?

Simply irresistible!! And VERY easy to make. The alterations I made, instead of 1c. white sugar, I used 3/4 c. And 1/2 c. semi-sweet morsels rather than walnuts. It's a KEEPER!

They came out bitter and dry. So much cocoa powder -- the same amount is called for in recipes with twice as many eggs, flour, etc. When I poured the batter into the pan it seemed excessively thick.

I'm surprised at all the good reviews! What kind of a recipe for brownies doesn't take any butter? Happy for those who liked these, but won't be using this recipe again.

These might be the best brownies I have ever made!!! Had to do a dairy-free dessert for a friend and now this will be my go-to brownie!!! So moist, such great chocolate flavor, just PERFECT! I doubled it and baked in a 9 x 13 which I would definitely recommend. 
(They were a nice height - not too flat, but not too tall- perfect brownie size) Baked for about 23 or 24 min. Spectacular!

Doubled the recipe & put in larger pan. Followed directions on recipe & had to leave in 13 minutes longer & they still were not done. I will not be making these again.

These are not the best brownies i have ever tasted, but they aren't half bad... They have a nice tang to them and not to cakey. although they aren't very fudgey either. but they are simple and easy- i'm only 13 and i made them myself.

Easy and delicious!  I used the ingredients specified in the recipe but changed the pan size to 8x8 as recommended by other reviewers. I also sifted some powdered sugar over the cooled brownies. The result was a delicious brownie that was tender and fudgey.

My daughter received the Nostalgia Bakery Bites Express for Christmas.  We didn't have any brownie mix so we Googled brownie recipes and found this one.  It was perfect!  I had all the ingredients on hand and it was easy to whip up.  The recipe perfectly makes 2 batches in our Bakery Bites Express machine.  We've made the recipe every day for the past 3 days and even took a batch to a Christmas day gathering --- kids love these! The brownies come out so delicious and moist!

My favorite brownie recipe!! I love love love these! I usually double the recipe and put it in a larger pan... 8x11 or 9x13, each time they've turned out great (just takes a little longer to bake.) thank you for sharing! I'm baking them again right now! :)

I've tried these twice, doubled both times and baked in a 9x13. These just aren't it for me.  I want a brownie that is chewy and fudgy, but mine was cake-like the first time, then way too dense the second time (I tried reducing the eggs).  Oh well, I'll keep looking!

I decided to make brownies for a good friend of mine, and this recipe surely did not disappoint. It had the right balance of sweetness,and had a good texture. I'll probably try to double the recipe next time to get more brownies. It was SO good my friend thought it was store-bought. This will be my go-to recipe from now on. Will definitely make this one again. :)

I give this recipe 4.5 stars, only because they seem to be a little more cake-like, not as gooey as we'd like them.  On that note, I made one batch & they were a little thin, but still really good. I then tripled the batch, and used 9x13 pan, baked for 35 minutes (until a toothpick inserted 2" from the edge came out clean). This yielded thicker brownies, and more of them, which equals more happy people in my house!

I substituted 3/8c greek yogurt for the oil, used 3/4c sugar, and a little extra vanilla. They're pretty cakey so maybe I'd use one less egg next time but my boyfriend loves them so they get a thumbs up!

I did 1/4 walnut oil and 1/4 cup soy milk. I also did egg whites instead of eggs. A little crumbly so I'm going to add applesauce next time.

I read the comments to see how people iron out the recipe, so I did the butter substitution by 1/4 butter and 1/4 oil. I also did it twice, once with a half of 1/4 of a cup of hershey syrup and then the second time with 1/4 of a cup of melted small semisweet baking chips. I've never wanted to lick the bowl before, but man I did here! It was sooooooo good! Both variations tasted similar without too much noticable difference, but man these things are just awesome!

These were sooooo good! I didn't have a 9x9 pan, so instead i used a mini cupcake tin and made about 16 of them. I accidentaly overbaked them and they were still quite fudgy inside which goes to show how good they were

Really tasty! I will defiantly be trying this recipe with melted butter and maybe a little cream cheese swirled on top. So simple and so good.

Super easy, with ingredients easily found at hand. I use whole wheat flour and it's still delicious.

I love the recipe but it's not the biggest, I suggest that if you want them to be healthy add applesauce instead of the butter or oil, if you want them to be more moist, add sour cream instead. They're pretty good.

Fantastic! I doubled the recipe to make a 9 x 13 pan, and my family has already devoured half the pan! Sprinkled some chocolate chips on the top just before baking.  These came out chewy and delicious. Not cake-like, but not too dense either.  The perfect brownie!

I have made these twice so far. The flavor is very chocolaty and the texture is moist. The taste is very good, but I do have a hard time cooking them the whole way through without the edges getting too hard. My fiance, who I am usually cooking and baking for, does not like his brownies too gooey and therefore isn't a huge fan. Usually when I make him a pan of brownies, they are gone within a day but these took him 5 days with help from me!

These brownies were very tasty! But if you're looking for fudgey brownies, go elsewhere. These are more cakey than fudgey. Still very good though.

I was looking for a GOOD brownie recipe and I FOUND IT!!! Like many of the others, I used butter instead of oil. I also used a mixture of Hershey's Cocoa and Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa. The brownies were so good I ate half the pan when they were done and baked another pan the next day. No complaints here~DELICIOUS!! I wish I could rate this with 10 stars!!

I double this recipe and made it for my family and friends. They LOVED it! This was my first time making brownies from scratch, so I was shocked by how much BETTER they tasted than those made from a mix! 

This will definitely be my go to brownie recipe and based from now on!

These are the best brownies I've ever had.  I swirl caramel in them and then top with caramel and chocolate chips.  My friends love these.  I make them at least twice a week and sometimes more.

Absolutely disgusting. I pulled them out soaking wet with vegetable oil. 1/2 a cup is apparently way too much. I drained out about 1/4 a cup of oil off them.

Perfect brownies for sundaes ... I made a cream cheese topping and made them even 100 percent more amazing.  I believe that we call that extra awesome on the side! Try it especially with a scoop of homemade Spumoni Ice Cream

I love these! I used 1/4 cup melted butter and 1/4 cup oil and sprinkled a few chocolate chips on top. I love that they don't have the oily taste that boxed brownies have. I used a 9 x 7 pan and that was perfect. It seems like they might be too thin in a 9 x 9 pan.

Great Easy Recipe!  I used an 8 x 8 pan and the depth of the brownies were perfect. I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil since that is all I had.

Great brownie consistency: chewy but not too dense. I do agree that they weren't quite sweet enough for my taste but that can be tweaked. I wish I had seen the butter in lieu of oil suggestions beforehand. Perhaps that would have made them richer which could compensate for the lack of sweetness. Next time! All in all pretty good recipe!

I was skeptical because I've made brownies from a box all my life (thank you Betty Crocker!) but I didn't have a box mix and I needed a quick dessert.  Cookies just weren't in the picture.  So I decided to try this recipe.  Followed it for the most part but added about a teaspoon or so of finely ground coffee beans and about a quarter cup of Ghiradelli 60% coco chocolate chips.  Buttered the pan (8x8 glass pan), poured the batter in, and baked for about 27 minutes - still a little gooey in the middle, but pretty set up.  They look puffy when you first take them out of the oven, but then they settle to a pretty flat brownie - Not super cakey and not overly fudgy (my husband interprets that as undercooked).  I cut the pan into 12 brownies and my husband went back for seconds....twice.  Thus, I know this is a hit.  I thought they were plenty sweet and plenty chocolaty, but I suppose the chocolate chips might have helped that.  I will definitely make this again.

These were good, but too cakey for my family. I made them with 1/2 butter and 1/2 canola oil.  The second time around, I adjusted the recipe as follows:
5tbsp butter, 3 tbsp canola oil, ADD a square (1 oz) of Baker's unsweet chocolate
I just heated those up and stirred until the chocolate melted into the butter/oil mixture (microwave).  I then added the sugar and stirred for a bit, then set it aside.  I mixed up the dry ingredients, then set that aside.  I went back to the slightly cooled sugar mixture and quickly beat in the eggs and vanilla, then quickly added the dry ingredients, then quickly poured it into the pan and baked it until a knife inserted about halfway between the middle and the edge came out with only a couple of crumbs.
The result was much more to our liking--fudgy with a bit of chew, especially around the edges.  Perfect.

I don't usually rate a recipe unless it is outstanding, and this brownie recipe is awesome! It is easy to make and is as good if not better than other name brand fudge brownies. This recipe results in a chocolatey chewy brownie. I made it for the first time and doubled the batch and left it in the oven about 10 minutes longer than what the recipe called for. I used a 13" x 9" shiny baking pan and my double batch yielded 30 squares (about a two bite size slice). Your oven may require a different bake time, so I may have lucked out on my first try. Regardless, this recipe is a keeper, and I may never go back to brownie mixes again because these are that delectable!

I dont have 9x9 pan either, so I too used 8x8.  I added chocolate chips.  My brownies were dry and tasteless.  Like the other reviewer, lovelymarbear I definitely was searching for a SWEET TREAT and these did not fit my craving.  Even using an 8x8 rather than a 9x9 pan, these brownies were still thin and flat vs. light texture, chewy, thick and sweet!!   My apologies for the unfavorable review to the inventor of this recipe.

These turned out perfect! Took 35 min in my oven but I think its my oven (older model). I don't think they are too thin, some people said they were but this is the perfect thickness IMO.

I just made these and they were great! Exactly what we were craving. Goey, chocolaty, and delicious . I followed the recipe and added a few chocolate chips.

I doubled the recipe using the "adjust recipe" feature.  Brilliant idea!  
I would leave out the baking powder next time.  I also sprinkled semisweet chocolate chips on the top.  It was pretty darn good!

I tried this recipe today and OMG! It turned out so perfect. Plus I used the peanut butter frosting to go on top. Let's just say there is barely any left. I will use this recipe for now on. I always wanted to make homemade brownies but was scared that it would not turn out right. I am glad that I tried it. Also I used butter instead of oil, it made so rich and butter, just the way brownies should be.

Ok. I am a pretty good cook and a very good baker. These brownies were not that good. They were very cakey (I even used smaller eggs) and not a strong chocolate flavor. Made a second time and added a little extra cocoa, decreased the sugar, used butter and added chips. It helped, but just not what I was looking for.

Made a huge x4 batch, and used 1 cup oil and 1 cup butter, with the addition of marshmallows, chocolate chips, and Oreo chunks.  Greatest thing in the world.

Sooooo goood..... was trying to find a way to use some of the unsweetened cocoa powder I accidentally bought.. this recipe was perfect.. used 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c vegetable oil, and incorporated some semi-sweet chocolate chips (jumbo) into the batter... yummmmm.. so fudgey.. hey! i had to check the batter to make sure it was up to standard ;) .. baked for 18 minutes like another reviewer because I was afraid they would get dry.. soo moist and good.. will definitely use this recipe again and will have fun experimenting with add ons..

Lovely brownie!!!
Update 5/11/2013 Today I started making this brownie recipe again, only to realize that I only had 1 egg left.  Remembering hearing somewhere that a heaping tbsp of sour cream can replace an egg, I added that instead.  Baked for 25 minutes, and got the fudgiest, richest, most decadent brownie I've ever tasted.  I think i just might do that always, it was soooooo good.

Hands down, the best brownie I have ever tried/made. My entire family loved them.  I used pecans instead of walnuts. Wish I had doubled the recipe...this tray of brownies was gone before the day was over!

Mmm so good! Usually I use icing but this recipe was better! I used the butter idea and it was super! Though however, I could not find a 9x9 pan but a 8x8 used just fine! Great recipe!

I chose this recipe as it used oil, since I was out of butter. I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly. I did add about a half a bag of chocolate chips I wanted to use up. I baked in a 13 x 11 pan for 35 minutes.  I frosted with a peanut butter, cream cheese frosting.  The brownies were moist, chewy and came out about an inch or so thick.  They also had a nice crackly, shiny top that made me think twice about frosting them! Wonderful flavor that says BROWNIES!!!!! Gonna have some happy kids after school today! Will be making this recipe again.  (on a side note - I think the recipe is not going to work well, as written, using a small pan.  There is just not enough batter and the 25 minutes bake time would be too long.)

I can't give more than one star simply because the amounts of ingredients listed do not combine to fill a 9x9 tin. The brownies are gone into the oven in a tin of this size but the mixture only covers about half of the tin. Disappointed.

I made these for my brother and me for breakfast (i know im fat:0) and they turned out GREAT!!! I used a stick of melted butter instead of the vegtable oil and sifted a light coat of confectioners sugar over the top and it was very very good. they were quick and easy. I will definatntly be making these again soon!

This recipe is delicious! Some helpful hints to get a chewy, fudgy brownie is to bake it for the 25 min. And cool it completely. Also to make it a little denser, I added an extra tablespoon of flour, and got amazing results! Definitely making these again!

These are so simple and so awesome! I'm not big on too-sweet sweets, so this was just about perfect. They were just the right amount of chocolatey and chewy! Definitely going to be making these again, but will lubricate my pan more (I almost had to pry the brownies off the bottom, but they were so good, I didn't much mind).

This has become my go to brownie recipe. I'm a lazy baker so it says something that I would rather make these from scratch than buy a box. That's how good this recipe is. I also add chocolate chips before baking, but no other changes.

These are NOT FUDGY BROWNIES so if that's what you want, don't make these!!! They were extremely cakelike and not very moist or chocolatey (I even added chocolate chips!). I was severely disappointed.

Very easy-I was out of butter and shortening but wanted brownies, so I searched for a recipe using veggie oil. They are nice and chewy, stood up well to freezing, and my boyfriend devoured them! I'm making another batch tonight! I think I'll try greasing and flouring the pan (I used a mini muffin tin), as they did stick just a bit with cooking spray. Definitely a keeper!

These were amazing, have made them so many times already! I do usually substitute butter for the vegetable oil and I reduce the cooking time to about 15minutes for the brownies to have a more fudge-y texture. Highly recommended!

I just made these this afternoon and I substituted the granulated sugar for honey.  It made a wonderful chocolate cake consistency rather than a brownie, but I still really like them!!

Yummers!  I like to make this recipe when I am wanting a late night simple brownie snack.  Perfect recipe and very yummy to eat.  No changes, like it just the way it is.

The taste was wonderful, better than a box. However, I followed the recipe exactly how it is and the brownies came out a flat gooey mess. At first it looked like were nice and thick but then they went flat as they cooled! I took the brownies out 23 mins and let them cool. I wanna try this again but I'm afraid it wont end up thick.

I followed this recipe exactly. Brownies baked on center rack for 22 minutes in a gas oven. The edges were just barely starting to pull away from the pan. Perfect! The crust looked more or less uniform. My taste testers say " Were those from a box?" No, of course. "They are better than box brownies!" "Those were awesome, make more", from my straightforward and  more demanding tester. OF course I'll make more, but after a few weeks. Very yummy and addicting. I used no nuts. Thank you very much. It looks like I will double next time.

Great recipe. My brownies looked cakey, but tasted moist and chewy once you took a bite. I added walnuts, and I think this recipe is open to all kinds of additions (other nuts, chocolate chips, etc.).

These were fantastic! I used dark chocolate cocoa powder and baked them into "brownie cupcakes" and they were a hit. Definitely making these again!

Yummy! My mom said they were the best shes ever had. I used canola oil because it was all I had and I could have let them bake for 35 min. It would have been over the top with some vanilla ice cream.  Thanks for the recipe!

These brownies have a smooth chocolatey flavor that his deep and satisfying.  I added lots of spices to the chocolate as it was melting, such as cayenne and turmeric.  Chocolate lends itself as a backdrop to many other flavors!

I just made these brownies and they are delicious!!!  I made them in a 8x8 pan, so I cooked them for exactly 30 minutes.  I wouldn't change one thing about this recipe!  I will be using this recipe from now on!!!

Flavor really delish, changed a few things, used 1/2 cup splenda/sugar mix, butter and added chocolate chips and a 1/2 tsp coffee. 8x8 pan for 30 min. which I think was to long baking, they aren't as moist as I wish they could have been. I will make them again and double the recipe so they are thicker.

I'm no brownie expert but I'm not in love with this recipe. It had good flavour, not too sweet, but I found the edges too hard, and the whole pan too thin for my liking. I must have missed something because so many other reviews say "gooey" and "soft" and "chewy". I'll try it again but with a smaller pan and maybe a few other changes. I bet it would be great with ice cream though.

MMMMM.... these are definitely the BEST brownies ever. Moist, Chocolatey, and the perfect mix between fudgey and too cake-like.The recipe is also very simple to make. I love that it uses oil, as oil is always available in our house. I used Canola. I made these brownies once in a 8x8 pan, and once in my cupcake maker as brownie bites. They were divine both times. My new favourite :)

I liked this recipe, except instead of vegetable oil I used butter and mixed the cocoa with the butter-fat carries flavor. Then, before they cooled, I put Hershey bars on top to melt, then refrigerate to make a nice frosting :) perfect!

Wonderful! Soft & chewy. Just delicious! I doubled the recipe, not the eggs I just used 2. I used grapeseed oil (good for you oil) 1 3/4 c sugar, I added half & half (about 1 TBS). A MUST try! I will save the recipe & use again & again.

Tried these with butter like recommended and they were fabulous! The butter made them very fudgy. I also threw in a few extra chocolate chips I had lying around just for kicks. I did have to bake them for almost fifteen minutes longer than the recipe stated.

These brownies are amazing - I am finishing my last bite as I type. I used unsalted butter instead of oil, and added about 1/8 cup of International Delight York Peppermint Patty, as I think peppermint and chocolate are fabulous together around the holidays. My family loved them!

Really good cocoa brownie recipe!  I followed it as written (but doubled it and used an 11x14 pan).  I would have liked a fudgier brownie (which I've found is harder to achieve with cocoa powder) so next time I'll use butter instead of oil as suggested by others.

I really loved this recipe! instead of baking them in a pan together i made them into brownie muffins. They only needed about 17 minutes in the oven. It made about 10 muffin brownies (standard size). Simply what i needed today! Thanks for sharing

This is really good! In between of fudgy and a bit cakey, but definitely very chewy... It has chewy edges, and a bit flaky top. I love this so much.. it even beat my own recipe... The only problem here, I would make it again in 8x8" pan, it's too thin for me... But overall, love it so much!

These are absolutely delightful! I just made these and made a whipped butter, coco powder, powdered sugar, and vanilla frosting, and they were sinfully good! The brownies came out soft, and oh so chewy. Best brownie recipe out there... And so easy!

I prefer the "Best Brownie" recipe using butter and altering the pan size to get a thicker brownie. As others have noted, doubling the recipe and baking in a 9 x 13 pan does the trick, still baking at 20 minutes to keep them chewy. I added butterscotch chips to the walnuts and it makes a good combination.

These were delicious chocolatey brownies. I added peppermint extract to make them peppermint brownies and topped them with mint icing and chocolate chips.

I have never, and I mean NEVER, been able to make brownies from scratch that tasted good.  Holy cow, these are so easy and so AMAZING!!!  I really feel stupid for using a boxed mix for so long.  I used 1/4c melted butter, 1/4c veg oil and then added choc chips instead of the walnuts.  These are so freakin' good.

These brownies are amazing.  I used dark cocoa powder and butter which made the flavor incredible.  I also doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan.  This is a permanent fixture in my recipe box.

These brownies were amazing!!! I used a 1/2 cup butter instead of the oil and I let my vanilla overflow while pouring. I also had half a bag of semi sweet chocolate chips that I threw in there. The result was a soft, melty, chocolate goodness.

This is a 5-star brownie for how easy it is and how I always have the ingredients in my pantry. They fill that chocolate craving, are easy and so quick to throw together, and do not require a special trip to the grocery store. That's 5-star worthy in my book.
They are moist and even better with semi-sweet chocolate chips sprinkled on top. I did use an 8x8 pan and kept true to the temperature and baking time as stated in the recipe. I've made these three times already!

Amazing! Especially when they are hot. I once put a brownie in the microwave for about 15 seconds, then
mixed it around in my ice cream. Then I put chocolate
syrup on it. The BEST!!!

These brownies lived up to the reviews!  I didn't have any oil so I used a good quality olive oil.  I loved them and will use olive oil again. I also sprinkled walnuts on top.  I am thinking these would travel well and maybe ship ok, too!  Thanks for a keeper!

Wow!  I made these tonight, to satisfy a brownie craving I'd been having, and let me tell you, these were just wonderful--quite frankly, the best brownie recipe I've tried yet (and I've tried a few, both on this site and elsewhere).  I made them with melted butter, as suggested, and added a half package of peanut butter/milk chocolate chips (the bag had a blending of both) to the batter, and it was positively delicious.  Gooey, fudgy, and not at all thin and skimpy like others have claimed.  The only thing that differed for me was I ended up adding about five extra minutes to the bake time (probably an issue with my oven).  If you're looking for "Mmm-Mmm" brownies, this recipe is it!

Great recipe, these brownies didn't last long here! I used a Gluten Free flour blend in place of the all purpose flour + 1/2 tsp of Xantham Gum and they turned out beautifully! In fact, you couldn't even tell they were gluten free! I would highly recommend baking on parchment paper.

This is the best and easiest brownie recipe. I made these for a cbristmas party at work but I added pecans, chocolate chunks, and carmel pieces. They were gone so fast and everyone wanted to know where I got them. They could not believe I made them. Now every year when Christmas comes around they make sure I am bringing those brownis.

Yum!! This recipe doubled and baked in a 9X13 inch pan is what I've baked for years.  None better!  Delicious dusted with powdered sugar or topped with frosting of 1/2 cup peanut butter melted with 3/4 cup choc. chips and then refrigerated for 1/2 hour to set.  
The best thing is the top doesn't crack off and  you can cut these into bars nicely without the knife getting all gummed up and crumbling your squares.

There are really good. To make them even better I cooked them in an 8x8 pan because in a 9x9 they would be a little too thin. Defiantly use melted butter instead of oil. Cook for 25 minutes in an 8x8 pan for a nice fudgy brownie.

I don't understand how this recipe has gotten rave reviews???? The batter did not taste good at all so I added peanut butter chips. These baked up strangely and tasted like cardboard!  I'll be going back to my bakers chocolate recipe, I think possibly, it was the coco powder that threw these off.

Perfection in an 8x8 pan! These are truly delicious and ridiculously easy! I chose to substitute butter for the oil as well, and these turned out chewy on the edges and fudgy on the inside. Very rich and chocolatey!

These brownies have the perfect consistency. My only problem is that they dont taste chocolatey. I used ghirardelli unsweetened cocoa powder so im not sure if maybe my cocoa powder is the problem or if there is something missing in this recipe.

Wow these were amazing brownies! I've tried many recipes and by far this one is my favorite. The night I made them I only had a vanilla bean and one egg and still came out delicious!

They taste really good! I only had 1/4 cup of oil left, so I added some orange juice. I also didn't have a 9x9 pan, so I used a normal cake pan and added 10 minutes to the baking time. I'll bake these again in the future!

I had no idea brownies could be so soft and fudgy without melting chocolate.  It's a wonderfully simple and delicious recipe as written.

Awesome brownies!  I've made them a few times now but tonight I made the mistake of putting the sugar in the dry ingredients instead of the wet.  What a disaster, they were oily and the consistency was all wrong.  After cooking they were rock hard!  Make sure you follow directions exactly.

These brownies were def mmm-mmm!!  I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the nuts b/c the hubs won't eat them!  The flavor was sooo good!!  I also loved the "shiney" top when these came out of the oven!  The only reason why I didn't give these 5 stars is mine were kinda flat and a bit crumbly so you couldn't cut out a nice square it was more like just grab a forkful lol!  I'm thinking maybe my baking powder was old so I will def put these on the to try again!  Thanks Sarah!!

These brownies are pretty good.  I needed a recipe with oil (since I was out or butter and the hubby was craving chocolate) and I used 3/4 cup of brown suger instead of white (I really need to go to the store).  I dusted them with powdered sugar but they seemed to need something so I made a chocolate glaze to pour over them .....the family loved them

These are great brownies! I will never buy a box mix again! I was a little heavy handed on the vanilla and I will be sure to use a little extra next time too. I will also bump up the cocoa a little bit, or reduce the sugar some. I used cake flour as it was all I had on hand and these had great texture, cake like. Will make with AP flour next time for that dense texture though!

This is a good recipe except for the exclusive use of vegetable oil. I made according to recipe and it tasted like oily chocolate. It is much better substituting butter and shortening. I love these crumbled into ice cream!

My daughter made these brownies for the first time today and they turned out extremely well! They are very moist and chocolatey and since they're made with cocoa powder only they are extremely simple to prepare. Will definitely add them to our family favorites!

Great. The only problem was the pan that I chose made then too thin. Next time I will double this to make the brownies to the thickness I want.

I doubled the batch and used butter!  I had to bake them a little longer because they weren't quite done in the middle, but they were to die for!  My husband ate 3/4 of the pan in two days and then he asked me to make some more!  I think this time I will mix it up and try oil!

Not a fan. Doubled the recipe using 1/2 oil AND 1/2 butter. put it in a 9 x 13 pan. Directions say 20 - 25 minutes, so I figured with a doubled recipe I'd set my timer for 25 minutes, too late already dry. They were tasteless. Tried to salvage them by drizzling chocolate on them  but it didn't help. I would have given less stars but I'm am being generous as if they weren't overcooked they might have tasted better.

I have been looking for a good fudge brownie recipe for a while and this is it! It's simple and tastes great! My friends were shocked that I was able to make this on my own. Try switching out some of the flour for a serving of protein powder, it still tastes great!

Everyone that tried my brownies said they were "darn good" and "ten out of ten!" I actually mixed Skor bar chips (Toffee) into the batter before baking, and topped them with it (and chocolate fudge icing). Everyone loved them! Definitely my go-to brownies now :)

This is a great brownie recipe, and I had the most wonderful thing happen to me while I was putting them together! I only had a third of a cup of cocoa powder on hand, so I substituted the the other third with half of a Toblerone candy bar. THEY TURNED OUT AWESOME!

The batter was heavenly!

The brownie, eh, not so much. The batter turned out small and was poured into a smaller pan than 9x9 and it was still thin. The smell of it was delicious, but when I ate it (cooked at 17 mins) it was already really dry. It tastes fine, but the boxed brownie mix tastes better.

Delicious, definitely a hit in my household. I doubled the recipe and placed it in a 9 x 13 pan which gave me nice thick brownies. I did however have a few members of the family say they'd like to see some chocolate or caramel chunks in the brownies next time. Definitely saving this recipe!

Very good!  I cant have dairy at the moment, so this was perfect.  I made a couple changes/additions.  I used egg whites and added 1/4 cup of coconut flakes, 1/4 cup choc chips and a 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.  Soooo good!!!

Very easy and relatively low cost recipe.  I doubled to make enough to fill a 9x13 pan, and subbed butter for the vegetable oil.  Moist, crispy on top, and rich! Hit all around.

Really tasty brownies. They were gone right away. I do think they were a little chocolately though.

I had almost given up on finding a quick, easy, and delicious homemade brownie.  So glad I didn't! These are fantastic. Sweet, fudgy, but not too strong on the chocolate. I agree that these need to be made in an 8 x 8 pan.  They are thin even in this.

PERFECT!!!!!!!  I have tried so many brownie recipes, but this is THE ONE.  The only thing I did differently from the recipe is add 1/4 tsp of butter extract just for a little added butter flavor.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!  This is my new "standard brownie" recipe from this day forward.

Definately taste better after a few hours when they are cool. I added some mini chocolate chips in the batter and small white chocolate chunks. Very good. I did have to cook about 10mins longer I used a 8x8 pan.

These brownies have a good flavor, but when I baked them the edges started to burn, while the middle was still soft and almost batter-like.

Simple & Yummy! I made mine in a 8inch round cake pan because I couldn't find my 9x9inch baking pan. I do wish I would have used less oil, that will probably take some trial & error.. Overall great recipe!

These brownies were divine! SO cakey, fudgey, and just as a brownie should be! I used an 8x8 pan, just cook a few minutes longer. I also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon...just adds a hint of something extra ;) Will make agian very soon!

So quick and tasty! I substitute ground oats for the flour and no one is the wiser. Plus, I add chocolate chunks once in a while. These brownies don't last long. mm mm good.

Just made these and they are so delicious. So easy to make. I did mine in a 8x8 for 27 mins. I lined the pan with wax paper to make it easier to take out. No walnuts. I'm making these again :)

I followed this recipe exactly and it produced a sponge-like cake. Not having enough time to try again, I frosted it with cream cheese. It was still a crowd-pleaser, but not a brownie.

These brownies are the perfect mix of sweet and chocolately without being overly sweet. I used unbleached flower and it came out great. Turned up the heat to 450 at the end of baking to create a crispy edge. Great brownies that are super simple to make.

Great, easy from-scratch brownies! I used Ghirardelli cocoa powder (yes, makes a big difference) and superfood-healthy coconut oil instead of processed vegetable oil; the coconut taste is extremely subtle and delicious.

After years of brownie recipes that sucked, I was just about to give up hope on making them from scratch.. This recipe was phenominal!! I followed the recipe almost exactly, the only difference was the baking time; mine were in the oven for 35 min.   I topped them with a homemade chocolate butter-cream frosting.   They came out of the oven around 3 hours ago, and the pan is half gone :p   Thank you.

If you're like me...box brownies are the best.  I can never find a recipe that matches up, but these are the closest I've found.  YUM!  Just missing that chewiness that the box ones have.

I make these whenever I want a warm, decadently-delicious dessert.  The type of cocoa used makes a big difference. To me, Ghirardelli is the best, and Hershey's is a close runner up.

Hey guys this recipe looks great. I tried it with a couple substitutions. I used whole wheat flour and splenda. It came out with a weird texture. I'm not a baker so I'm not sure what I can tweak. Maybe the wheat flour changes things so I should use less or more or add something else.

These brownies were great - very moist. I followed the recipe exactly, only I doubled and made 2 9X13 pans. Also I added some chocolate chips and pecans, which added some needed sweetness.

So good. Found this in the dairy free collection on this site-perhaps that accounts for the similarity with the recipe that specifically uses butter. I wasn't a brownie lover-til now! 20 minutes in a 1 1/2 qt square pan ( maybe 9x4?) was nondairy chocolate heaven.

Yummmmmmm!!!!!  These are really really good!  I added more cocoa, at least a heaping tablespoon more...and glad I did it was perfect for me and my husband!  I will try butter next time just to see what the difference is, I think the butter will make them even better!  One tiny complaint is the thickness, I really wish they were a little thicker.  Very good recipe, I will no longer need to buy a brownie mix! (I bake EVERYTHING from scratch but never found a brownie recipe I really liked, but these are IT!)

Not as good as every review states. I bake often and am very good at it. I found the batter to be almost bland - something is lacking; maybe it's the finer things but I can't quite put my tongue on it. It isn't awful, but I would not make it again to these exact dimensions. I would call this brownie a "box brownie"... I have had much better and will continue searching for a tastier, more fulfilling recipe. Yours Truly.

Great texture!  I made them exactly as written.  I thought they needed just a touch more chocolate flavor, so next time I'll increase the cocoa and/or add some chopped chocolate.

These were a huge hit with hubby & his friends! Easy even for me. A little crisp on the outside & very moist & chewy on the outside. Use good cocoa powder & you can't go wrong! This one's a keeper.

This is the recipe I have been looking for!   I really like boxed mixes but hate spending the money on them.   I think the oil in the recipe is what I have been looking for.  I have made this several times now and we also really enjoy substituting 1/2 cup applesauce for half of the oil.   This makes the brownies a little cakier.  Thank you so much for sharing!

Great recipe - I modified it slightly - added a 1/4 tsp espresso powder and increased the amount of cocoa powder to a 1/2 cup - to give it a deeper, richer chocolate flavor. I also added choclate chips!

These are great non-dairy brownies.  I cooked them in a 9x5 pan so they would be thicker.  I did 325 degrees in the toaster oven for 25 minutes and let them sit in the oven for 30 mins after the oven was turned off. Butter brownies are more decadent, but these seemed less sinful. Chewy, not cakey as I expected.

this is a GREAT recipe... I don't know how many I've had to made since I first tried it, people just can't get enough. I have to admit that I do add 100 gr. (one tablet) dark chocolate chips to the recipe just to get the extra chocolate flavor.. mmmm!

I didnt have enough oil so I used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup melted margarine. I also undercooked these and used a pan that was too large and even though they were very thin, they still were delicious!!! Pretty hard to botch this recipe. Thanks!

This is my new favorite brownie recipe!  They were excellent.  I did use butter instead of vegetable oil.  I also added 1/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips.

I love this recipe.  I wanted to teach my 8 year old that brownies could be made without a box mix.  She loved them and so did all the neighborhood kids.  She now thinks her mom is the smartest mom in the world because I can make great brownies and don't have to have a box.

I love the recipe. It was the one I started with when I wanted to learn how to bake brownies. The only thing I changed was I put in semi-sweet chocolate chips.

Im eating some right now. VERY GOOD. I had a 9x13 pan and it only took 11, a bit too moist/undercooked say my mither, but I think they're great! I added a bit more baking bowder and I put sweetened cocoa powder instead. SENSATIONAL!!

My family and I LOVE this recipe!  I just made my second batch in one night because we ate all of the first one.  I used a stick of margarine instead of the oil.  This recipe is so quick and easy, and I really like that it calls for ingredients I always have on hand.  I will definitely make this again and again!

This was a great recipe..the first time I made it, it was a bit dry..the second time I doubled the recipe and put it in 2 round pans and it was much richer and fudgy but hard to cut in nice squares...the next time I make it, i will double it and put it in one large rectangle pan.  my son is allergic to dairy so this was perfect for him and he loved it!
My 3rd attempt at perfecting these brownies was a huge success; I doubled the recipe (did not use nuts..son is allergic) and put in one large pan..they are sooooo good and came out perfectly..I am making it the second time this way for the holidays..A+

Yuuummm.  We made these using only 4 ramekins, so they were more like little chocolate cakes.  They were really good warm with vanilla ice cream on top.

i printed this recipe out over 5 years ago and felt obligated to finally write a review.  these are simple, but AMAZING brownies.  so moist and fudgy.  i usually leave out the walnuts and always make with melted butter instead of oil.  these keep well for days.  i usually line the pan with lightly oiled foil to easily remove the brownies from the pan.  when the edges just start to pull away from the sides i take it out of the oven.  that way the edges crisp up a little, but don't get too hard.  these brownies are so easy and delicious.

It's fine for a quick and easy brownie - better than a mix but no comparison to something made with butter and chocolate

So easy!  How can I ever go back to using a boxed brownie with all the garbage they include in the mix??  Thanks for a great recipe and also one with dairy (my son is allergic).  I doubled the recipe and had to play with the cooking time, but they came out great.  Baked them on parchment paper in my pan so they come out perfectly when cut.  No more brownie mix for us!  Thanks!

A HIT!  We did use melted butter instead of vegetable oil.  It was great.  Perfect!  Not too mushy, not too cakey.  We used chocolate chips instead of nuts.  Not everyone in my family likes nuts.  WONDERFUL!

I've also tried my fair share of homemade brownies, and I've never found one that was all that much better than a good box mix.  That is, until this recipe.  I've made it twice - following the recipe exactly, and adding walnuts and chocolate chips.  Doesn't matter how I make it, these are amazing and easy!

These brownies were moist and delicious.  We could easily eat the entire pan in one sitting.  I put the brownies in an 8x8 pan since I didn't have a 9x9 and cooked it for the required 25 minutes and they turned out perfect - just the right thickness.  I did not sift the flour at all - just dumped it in with the other dry ingredients.  This is going to replace boxed brownie mixes in our home.  Fantastic!!

Very good brownies!!! They were gone in 2 days. The only thing i did differently was add chocolate chips to the batter which made them really decadent!

Delicious!  I used butter instead of oil, and they came out decedent!  Only thing wrong with the recipe is that it needs to bake for longer than is written.  But other than that, amazing brownies that are just as great the second day, if they last that long!

I agree, these are the best brownies. I don't like box mixes... So I will make those from now on. Easy to make, delicious to eat. Great with Ice cream, and other additions. My 2 nephews ate 3/4 of it in like 15 min.! I scaled the recipe for 24 servings and used 9x13 pan, but I wish I would doubled it because I like it a little thicker. Thanks for the recipe!

I love these brownies! I needed a dairy-free brownie recipe and this one is perfect. I only gave it 4 instead of a 5 because I always have to bake it at least an extra 5 minutes or they are totally raw instead. These are a little TOO easy to make!!!

The first time I tried this recipe, my brownies stayed soft and raw WAY past the baking time. Finally I turned off the oven and let it dry. Then it got too hard. However, others liked its taste. I think I know the problem. HINT: if you sift the flour too much before measuring then you won't have enough flour and the ratio of liquid to solid will mess up and your brownies will take forever to bake. Instead, pack the flour when measuring, then sift it into the bowl. I measured the flour right the second time and that time my brownies were PERFECT! Fudgy, soft, and rich in taste. Will make again!

Delicious! Better than the boxed variety and like one of the others said before, less calories!  Even better than the lower calories is the fact that there are no artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives.  A keeper for sure.

My teenage son loved these brownies. Doubled the recipe and there weren't any left. He and his buddies made little work of this pan and I was asked to whip up some more. Guess they were a big hit.

These are really good brownies.  I used the butter instead of the oil.  Moist and delicious.  I will double the recipe next time.  Thank You!

I thought these brownies tasted wonderful.  The only thing I was disappointed with was how thin then turned out.  I like my brownies thick and cake like.  However, these were a hit with my husband...he loved them because the fudgy type brownie is what he likes best.  He gives them 5 stars.  I will definately be using this recipe from now on.  Next time I am going to double the recipe and try a smaller pan...I am through with store bought mixes!!

Look no further.  These are simply "the best" and I've tried many brownie recipes.  Be careful to get the right doneness.  Mine took 34 minutes in an 8x8 pan.  I cut them while warm.  Just delicious.

These were good and pretty much the same as "Best Brownies" on this site, which is my usual stand-by. The butter does provide a much richer flavor. The texture is chewey without being too cakey or fudgy. If you're looking for cake-like or fudgy this isn't your recipe. I will probably make these again.

these were good.  I made them with butter instead of vegetable oil, and skipped the walnuts.  They were rich and moist, nothing really wrong with them, but they just weren't as good as my usual recipe.  (which has brown sugar in it, I'm thinking that a switch to brown sugar would make this one better...)

The best!  I doubled the recipe also, used 1/2 C oil & 1/2 C applesauce, baked in a 9 x 13 for about 40 minutes, frosted them with a can of chocolate frosting & these tasted just like what you buy from bakeries!!  Rich, fudgy, moist--this is the only recipe for brownies I'll use from now on.  Thanks OP!!

I doubled the recipe and left out the walnuts. I also added more cocoa powder and less sugar to make it more chocolatey. I realized after I put it in the oven that I forgot the baking powder. It still turned out delicious. It reminded me of a flourless chocolate cake. YUMMY

I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 butter, 1/2 oil.  I also used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa.  The doubled recipe was perfect for the 8x8 pan.  These brownies tasted really good, but had too much fat.  I will bake these again, doubling the recipe but only using 1/2 cup butter.  I love a rich, moist brownie but not one that is oozing oil.

This was my first take at homemade brownies and I'm now convinced! I used the vegetable oil, doubled the recipe, and put them in a 9x13 pan lined with parchment paper. These were so yummy and moist. I took them to a party and they were gone in no time. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

The whole family loved these brownies and they were very easy to make. Adding chocolate sauce on them makes it even better. I will try using 1/4c of melted butter with 1/4c oil next time I make it as other suggested.

I did not enjoy these brownies. I followed the recipe exactly, but the brownies came out tasting way too sugary. I couldn't enjoy the chocolatey-ness which I look forward to enjoying when I bite into a brownie. The only reason I put 2 stars instead of 1 is that the texture did come out quite nice: nice and crispy on top but gooey at the bottom. I wouldn't make this again unless I had to, and even then I wouldn't put so much sugar in it.

These are pretty good. I prefer a box mix for fudgier brownies, but these will do in a pinch. They're very quick and easy to throw together with ingredients I always have on hand. This will be my go to recipe when I'm out of the box mix.

Brilliant recipe!!  Simple and forgiving.  I only had 1/4c cocoa on hand so added more choc chips and it was excellent.  Fast to whip together and bakes up with the fudgey texture.  Thanks!!

I increased the cocoa powder to 1/2 cup and added 1/3 cup chocolate chips.  Then I just whipped up a quick icing with powdered sugar, cocoa powder, butter, vanilla, and a little milk.  Really moist and fudgy, these were excellent!

I make these several times a month, using Smart Balance butter instead of oil, dark cocoa, and sea salt!  I don't like sharing these, can eat the whole 8x8 pan in 2 days.  Absolutely delicious, forget boxed brownies
Added note: I've been making these now with virgin coconut oil, ABsOLUTELY delicious I can't make fast enough

Wow!!! I just made these 2nite.  My good friend came over for drinks and i thought i would try it.  It did not disapoint us.  I mixed in some semisweet chips and put cashews on the top. Delish with a great  consistancy. Oh... i used an 8x8 dish and increased cooking time by 10 min.  Perfect.  Thanks.

LOVE IT! I doubled it, and added chocolate chips and marshamallows to make it "rocky road" style, and it was divinely rich and fantastic. I also used only 1/4 cup of butter and 3/4 cup of applesauce, and cut the sugar to one cup instead of 2. Thank you for this great recipe!

I prepared this recipe in under 10 minutes. I doubled the ingredients and baked in a 9X13 pan. I added choc chips and pecans to the batter. Absolutely delicious! Thank you for sharing. I'll never use box mix again.

Great and easy brownie recipe.  I followed the recipe, but used just a bit (3/4-7/8 cup) of sugar instead of one full cup.  I also added andies candies (mint chocolate) to the batter.  It was a hit.

Deliciousness! Instead of the optional walnuts, I used 1/4 cup each of raw cashews, shredded unsweetened coconut flakes, and vegan chocolate chips. I used an 8X8 pan and baked for 25 minutes. This is an easy recipe.

They are really chewy and fudy brownies! The thing I like best is that you don't need chocolate chips(I always run out when I feel like baking brownies =D)! Another thing is that all my experiences with brownie making have never turned out very well(some were too cakey some would bake they stayed watery, and some were just plain gross) but when i made this recipe, my whole family ate them right up and some of them don't like anything chocolatey but they really enjoyey this recipe! The reason I gave it 4 stars is that it needed a little kick of something... I don't really know what but I'm going to try it with some chocolate chips. You don't really get 16 pieces of the brownie and it fits in a 8x8 pan. Overall these brownies are great1 I am definatly going to use this recipe again!

The best brownies I've ever had! I tried the 1 c white and 1 c brown sugar just to cut down a bit. I also added 3/4 c of walnuts and 1/2 c white chocolate chips. Next time I might go for the full 3 c of sugar cause I'll know they will be killer!. Thanks!

I used a whole stick of melted butter in place of oil, as suggested.  So. Friggin. Good. My husband, 3 year old son and I polished off the pan in less than a day.

These were really good and super moist!  The only changes I made was using wheat instead of white flour, grapeseed instead of vegetable oil and I added a splash of Kahlua to the batter.  Fantastic!

the flavor was great on these, but I was disappointed that they came out so "flat" they didnt seem to fluff up. The texture was more cake like than brownie but delicious. Thank you for sharing.

I faithfully followed the recipe for these brownies except that I used an 8x8" pan because I don't have a larger one. The flavor and texture is great. I rated this a bit lower only because they turned out very thin despite using a smaller pan. Other than that minor disappointment, these turned out really well. I will bake them again but will double the recipe.

These are the best brownies ever.  I always add some chocolate chips to my boxed brownies, so I did the same on this one, just 1/4 bag of semi-sweet choc chips.  The rest of the recipe was made exactly like it said.  What I loved about these, is the top was a little crisp & the choc chips had settled on the bottom so the bottom was VERY moist.  These were so amazing that I can't make them too often, I want to eat the whole pan & so do my kids & their friends!  The only other thing I did, was double the recipe as others had said & placed it in a 9X13 pan & cooked for about 35 minutes on same degree!  YUMM!

I increased the recipe by 50% and thought the butter content was a tad much. Right! Like there could be to much butter? Very nice, rich so use big chunks of walnuts to break it up.

These brownies are absolutely sinful they are so good! I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 inch glass pan for 25 minutes. I also used butter flavored crisco instead of the butter and dark chocolate cocoa. They came out fudge like and delicious! The only problem with these is that everyone loves them so they never last for more than an hour or so after they come out of the oven. I frosted them and got rave reviews from everybody. This is now "the" brownie recipe at our house. Oh, don't bake these if you are dieting, they are irresistable and I usually have excellent will power. You can't eat just one of these!

This recipe was fine but not quite what I was expecting.  The initial taste was fine, but the brownies left a not so pleasant aftertaste. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used butter. I will try the recipe one more time using the oil and see if that makes a difference.

Incredible. This is my new brownie recipe. I added some chocolate chips,  and the short baking time makes the chocolate chips stay together and I am eating one now and I shouldn't go get another one buuut I probably will.

OMG!! It is AWESOME!! I had such a craving for brownies and found this recipe and I will never buy a box mix again! I had to add hot fudge and ice cream with it and it was just great! Thanks for sharing!

Yummy...made these today and my two boys - 4 & 6 helped (make and eat that is)!  I only had an 8x8 pan, left out the walnuts (don't really care for them) and used only half the oil as I replaced with 1/3c unsw applesauce.  I also reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and increased the cocoa to 1/2 cup and they cooked perfectly in 20 mins.  Nice and moist and chocolately.  I personally found them to have a cake like consistency compared to fudgey like, and I will try a couple other recipes as I am looking for something more 'dense', but these were defintitely great!

These brownies were very good for "homemade". I used the butter instead of the oil and omitted the nuts. They were extremely rich and gooey. But in my opinion still weren't as flavorful as some boxed brand brownies.

I'm usually really liberal with my ratings, this is the lowest I've ever given out. I followed the recipe to the letter, didn't over-cook it; the brownies turned out unremarkable and not chewy at all. Pretty disappointing since I used my precious butter to make them, it's really expensive here.

This was a fantastic recipe.  The brownies turned out moist, yet they were still fluffy.  I used all-purpose flour and left out the baking soda.  I also used broken pieces of Dove dark chocolate and sprinkled it on top.  This adds an extra chocolatey taste!  I didn't use any nuts because I did not have any.  I will make this for all holidays, since all the kids LOVE brownies.

Taste was good, but did not cook evenly.  They were very greasy after cooking for the suggested time.  Cooking longer would lead to crispy edges.

These were really good, and really convenient, since all of the ingredients are "on hand" ingredients. I made the recipe exactly. These are cake-like brownies. Very tasty. I did have to cook them 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for before they were done in the middle.

Delicious! My room mate and I just made these tonight. We used chopped nuts of indeterminate origin, cut the sugar by a quarter, and added a quarter cup of chocolate chips. They seemed slightly dry but still wonderful. We both had to fight the urge to just eat the batter.

This is the only brownie recipe I use now.  I usually top it with melted semi-sweet chocolate chips thinned with a little butter.  Topped with chopped pecans, this is the perfect brownie.

First bit that went in my mouth which was a small piece that got stuck to the pan was gross and didn't understand why people gave such good reviews, but then I tried a whole piece and it was a nice texture and chocolatey flavour, slightly greasy and would definitely try putting nuts and dried fruit in it next time because I was too lazy to try and find some in the cupboard this time. Not the absolute best brownie I've ever had but it's up there.

These are delicious.  My only complaint is that they have a bit of a salty/bitter aftertaste.  Maybe I'll added a little more sugar next time.  They are much better than the butter variety of homemade brownies.

These were delicious!  I threw in some mini chocolate chips and they came out extremely moist.  We used them to make brownie sundaes when we had family over for dinner and the brownies especially were a big hit.

These are chewy and very easy to make. I made them in a 8 x 8 glass pan and cooked for 25 minutes. Gave them a 4 because they need a topping.

I'm wanting to bake something and happen to have all the ingredients for this...
a few changes made for me, I used self raising flour, no baking powder for me, used 40g cocoa powder and 120g sugar [my family doesn't like sweet stuff] and added chocolate chips and raisins!
Baked for only around 15 - 20 mins in a 9x9 inch pan.
It's tasty, very chocolaty and nice~ Easy to bake for a novice like me!
*double thumbs up*

I really wanted brownies and I happened to have all the ingredients for these in my kitchen.  I used just one egg like some other reviewers suggested, and threw in some extra cocoa (to finish off the box).  I baked them in an 8x8 pan and they were nice and thick and fudgy.  But I think I just prefer brownies made with chocolate squares, because the flavor was just okay.  I think I will keep looking.

Unfortunately,we did not love this recipe. Followed it to a "T" (using butter) and as other reviewers had stated, they were more like little brownie bites...very small,thin and in my opinion not that tasty. Think we'll try another recipe next time.

I used this as a base for another recipe I created. It worked well, but if I was to want just a brownie, it'd be too cake-like.

I like fudgy brownies, and these were not. They were very cake like. I used butter instead of oil and they were good, but nothing special. I prefer the box mix.

This recipe was PERFECT just the way it was listed, all the other things that people added sounded GREAT too... but I needed to see what it was like before I started adding. Can I just say, I made them the day before I guests arrived and they have been here a week now and I have made them every other day!!!! Thank YOU!!!!!

These brownies did not work.  I followed the recipe exactly and they ended up a big mess in the pan.  This wouldn't have been too big a deal if the taste were good enough to compensate for the consistancy, but it wasn't.

These brownies were just ok. We ate them but I don't think I'll make them again. Just not what I was looking for.

these are only okay, absolutely nothing spectacular about them. if you use butter instead of oil, be aware that you will really taste the butter. not nearly chocolately enough for chocolate brownies. plus, this recipe is the same as several other recipes, and i was looking for something more unique. i'll stick to my own.

I always use the butter in these -- and people are always asking for the recipe.  Good texture, not overly sweet.

These are pretty good brownies.  They were a little too greasy, but I think if I knock down some of the veggie oil next time that'll fix it.  I only used one egg, hoping to make a fudgy brownie, not cake-like, and it worked!  I will be making these again.

I dont know.....Maybe I'm just so used to boxed brownies...(Betty Crocker in the red box is the best by far)......I've been trying to find a good "homemade" brownie recipe.  In this one, I used the butter option and I didnt put the baking powder in.  They came out about a millimeter thin...and fudgy....but theres something I've found in making brownies from scratch....they taste like either the flour or the cocoa powder is stale or something.  Maybe thats just the taste of not enough of the chocolate taste I crave.  Sorry folks, but I think I'll just stick to the box version.
