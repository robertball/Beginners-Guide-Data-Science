Thought it was good. The bad thing is that there will always be someone saying this isn't a "proper" one... who cares? If it's good, it's good.

No sugar syrup, no egg white, no cherry garnish - this is not a proper amaretto sour!

Sorry, this is terrible! Nothing like an Amaretto sour, I hate that I wasted Lemon juice and Amarreto on this! Definitely need to use real sour mix for this cocktail.

Delicious and simple. Just what I needed.
