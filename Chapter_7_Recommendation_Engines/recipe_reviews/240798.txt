If I could I would get this 4 1/2 stars - If using cooked shrimp add them at the very last moment.  Also, I would cook the pasta and toss it with the sauce so that the delicious sauce covers every bite.  
I cooked raw shrimp in butter and garlic, removed and then continued on with the recipe.  Add the shrimp and pasta in at the end.  Delicious.  
A few added pepper flakes to step this up a notch.  A solid recipe - thank you.
