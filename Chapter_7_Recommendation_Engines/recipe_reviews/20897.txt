This is a wonderful recipe, however, I used canned peas and made it just a couple of hours ahead of time. It keeps well for a few days. Also great with fritos.

This is a great recipe but trust me on this.... add 1 or 2 tablespoons of sugar.  Makes all the difference.

Simple and great. What more could you ask from a recipe? Used as a snack and got raves from all my houseguests Christmas Eve!

Good dip. I made it with canned black-eyed peas, and cut back a little on the onion (used red and yellow onion). I think a little fresh cilantro would be a great addition too. Thanks, Gabrielle!

This recipe in general was good, but it was INCREDIBLY too much onion.  One pound of peas was so overpowered by 1 1/2 cups of onion that it was all you could taste...and taste...and taste!  I've made similiar recipes before and they were a big hit.  This one would have been perfect with about 1/3 of the onion.
