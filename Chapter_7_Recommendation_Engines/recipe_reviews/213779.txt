Delicious! And, not to mention very hearty on a snowy day! I don't think this breakfast dish missed a thing - I used baby portabella mushrooms, red and green peppers, added some vidallia onion and a bit of garlic. I beat the eggs with milk and they came out nice and fluffy. This was perfect with a side of whole grain toast and orange juice!

YUM! I made my own turkey breakfast sausage mix, baby bella mushrooms, a mixture of organic red, orange and yellow peppers and organic eggs. My boys inhaled this. I served it with homemade salsa and whole wheat biscuits. Husband asked next time I make a recipe and a half of this.

We were looking for something different for a weekend breakfast and dh stumbled upon this recipe.  We had most of the ingredients so we got cooking.  Made a hearty breakfast that was full of flavor.  Used hot Italian sausage which provided heat, and we cut up waffle fries instead of hash browns.  Will certainly make again.
