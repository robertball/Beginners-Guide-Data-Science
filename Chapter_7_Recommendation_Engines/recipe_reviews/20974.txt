The best way to make grilled veggies just POP with flavor is to toss them in a good Italian dressing! I recommend expand your veggie horizons: add cherry tomatoes, zucchini, pineapple chunks (oh especially pineapple chinks), asparagus, sweet red onion... threaded on the kabob and grilled alongside your favorite flavored chicken. I do  veggies all year long, even when I just have to toss them on a baking sheet in the oven.

First time making kabobs.  Was very easy to prepare and the flavor was perfect.  I would recommend cutting the chicken larger than the veggies to insure proper cooking on the grill.

This was my first time making kabobs, and it turned out excellent!  I used green, yellow, & orange bell peppers, mushrooms & pineapple.  I didn't use the onions.  Then I brushed a honey teriyaki glaze on them while on the grill.  Very easy to prepare!  This is a perfect dinner for a BBQ during the summer.

This is a regular recipe for me and my husband. Simple and tastes great! In the colder months, I make this without skewers and bake it in the oven at 350 degrees for 1 hour.

Don't get me wrong, I love kabobs, but somehow I didn't care for the barbeque sauce on my veggies.  It hid the taste too much.

My daughter and I made this for dinner but added pineapple chuncks to it.  It was terrific.  It was easy for a teenager to make and for mom or dad to grill it.

This is one of the easiest ways to do chicken kabobs.  I always separate the chicken from the veggies because they don't cook at the same rate, plus I don't care for BBQ sauce on my veggies.  All you need is a side of rice and you have a great meal.

Quick, fun, and tasty.  No need to marinate, just brush BBQ Sauce repeatedly.  Good with Pita Bread.

Made this one for lunch and grilled it on my george foreman grill. I added the pineapple like the other reviewers did, but it still seemed alittle lacking in flavor. It was super easy to make, filling and healthy so I gave it 4 stars.

Very good. I cut my partially frozen chicken breasts with kitchen shears into squares. For the BBQ sauce I used Bubba's Best BBQ sauce recipe.  We grilled the chicken and veggies first, then coated with the sauce.

Yum! As long as you use a barbeque sauce that your family likes, you really can't go wrong with this. We prefer Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar. I've made this many times and I like to use less meat and more veggies - I like to add zucchini chunks, cherry tomatoes, and mushrooms in addition to the peppers and onion. Super tasty and simple. Thanks :)

This recipe is so amazingly easy. I made the following changes/additions after reading other reviews: I used a pack of chicken tenderloins (they're easier to work with than breasts, to me), and added chunk pineapple and yellow bell pepper to add more color.  I marinated the chicken and veggies in Italian salad dressing for around 4-5 hours, threaded them on the skewers and put them on the grill.  I used a food thermometer, and when the temp began to approach 160 (temp for poultry), I brushed a little bbq sauce on all sides and finished cooking. This recipe was fun to prepare with my husband.  This will definitely be on the menu again REALLY soon!

It ended up raining last night so we cooked them in the oven.  I used the broiler and cooked them for 20 minutes.  I used red onions, red and green peppers, pinapple, cherry tomatoes, chicken cubes, and zuchinni.  They were excellent.  All the extra ingredients we put into a baking dish and cooked them for about 30 minutes, they were great as well!

We sparked the grill up for game day ! I cut up boneless skinless chicken tenderloins marinated them over night, and soaked the skewers in water before threading them.  I also made fried squash with onions, and fried some fresh green beans in e.v.o.o

I haven't made this yet. I definately will, but if you haven't noticed this is a recipe from a restaurant called GIO. I had it as an appetizer at the restaurant. It is delicious. Based on the ratings it looks and sounds pretty good. This isn't an original recipe though, but since I loved it when I first tried it I give it a five satr rating.

Great to make and flavorful considering that is so easy to make, however, I consider this one a kabob 101 lesson, I like more variety of veggies and to try new sauces all the time :)

Made these with homemade sugar-free barbecue sauce. They were the bomb! Second time making these: PHENOMENAL! This time I didn't have barbecue sauce so I used salsa with some vinegar, mustard, and a few spices. Yum!

I used Kraft Hickory Smoke BBQ sauce and put in NuWave for 8 minutes then turned over for another 7 minutes. FABULOUS!  High ratings from my husband too who has diabetes. "Like it. Not dry at all, and is just right." So thanks for that!  Thanks to Dave Sarah for sharing!

Made way more than I planned, but the leftovers were great too.  Made wild rice and cut small baby red potatoes instead of bell pepper (I don't like) and it was still good, especially with the pineapple.

I haven't made this so it's not a review but if you want to reduce the calories, sugar, and fat use honey mustard in place of the barbecue sauce. It tastes great!

My wife an I enjoyed this a lot.  Only thing I did differently was cook the veggies separately because of different cooking times.  Very simple and delicious.

I made these chicken veggie kabobs for my family and they absolutely loved it! Normally, they don't eat bell peppers but this was an amazing dish that got them to try it since it's so healthy and they loved it! I would definitely recommend this for a family meal.

I didn't add BBQ sauce directly on the 'bobs, but left it on the side for dipping. i didn't have red bell pepper, but added mini cucumbers. I used the following ingredients: marinated chix breast pieces (marinaded in black pepper, hot paprika, and a little garlic salt overnight), peppered bacon, pineapple, gr pepper, both red & white onions & cherry tomatoes. The pineapple was awesome with the spiciness of the meat. Yet cooling with tomatoes & cukes. I sprayed the bobs with nonstick cooking spray, and grilled on low for 20 min. The best part about this recipe is that you can personalize ingredients to whatever you like. This was my first time making. Will do it again. Had garlic bread for an easy side. Thanks for posting this!

This was my first time making kabobs. I used zesty Italian dressing instead of barbecue sauce.  The whole family liked them. Will definitely have again.
