I can't say anything more that hasn't been said about how good this recipe is.  I tried this last year for christmas as a newbie canner. (I still am a newbie canner).  I searched the reviews and wished someone had quickly explained the "canning" process, but sadly found none.  So I wanted to put my 2 cents in and try to feed some info for those like me who are scared to try.  ( I may make some canners cringe, so please feel free to correct me!)  This recipe makes 4 12 oz jars or 6 8 oz.  I used 2 medium red peppers and 5-6 med-large jalapenos.  I washed the jars and lids in hot soapy water and put the jars in a very large pot and covered with water. I put it on high heat until the water simmered (about 180 degrees) and turned the flame down to keep it at a simmer.  Then I started cooking the jelly.  When it was almost ready, I use a pair of large tongs to take out the jars and poured in the jelly, leaving 1/4 inch space on top. I then plopped on the lid and screwed the screw top on and stood it back in the pot and boiled for 5 minutes and removed.  I then did the mentioned flip trick -- flipping four times, once a half hour, to ensure evenly distrubuted peppers.  I made four batches for this christmas.  It's a great last minute gift when you forgot someone and great when visiting.  Thank you for the great recipe!

I've learned several things after making 5 batches of the jelly over the past four days (two batches failed;  don't use canned jalepenos and don't do a double batch)!  After LOTS of trial and error, I am very happy with my finished product.  Here are a few tips.  
1. use 1/2 cup finely chooped fresh jalepenos with the seeds from 2 (or more!)of the peppers 
2. use 1 cup bell pepper and process both peppers in a food processor (I didn't drain mine) 
3. add about 1 T crushed red pepper and 5-8 shakes of cayenne pepper while you are cooking the jelly (it doesn't make it too hot, just gives it a nice kick)
4.  Don't alter the sugar/vinegar amounts or you may end up with botulism (or just ungelled jelly!)
I used 1 1/2 packages of sure jell with my jelly.  I don't usually like hot food, but I love the jelly on wheat thins with cream cheese.  My husband thought this sounded AWFUL, but is now a devotee!  I am giving it as a gift with another jelly along with recipes (look on this site for some pepper jelly recipe ideas).  Good luck!

This is a  wonderful recipe. I have made it at least 10 times. The secret to looking like the photo(my picture) is to cut the peppers up in very very tiny pieces. I also put all the viens and seeds in a metal teaball and put it in the pot I am cooking the peppers in. Gives it a little extra zing. I put it in a hot water bath (5min) and turn it up and down every 1/2 hr for 2 hrs....evenly distributed. A real winner!!!

This is beautiful and very flavorful. I think it has just the right amount of heat. Other reviewers mentioned some questions/problems they had with theirs. One wanted to know how to keep it from boiling over and almost starting a fire. The answer to that one is a BIG pot and stir constantly during the boiling time! Another wondered why their double batch wasn't setting. Most canning guides recommend that you make two separate batches rather than try to double the ingredients in one batch. Just one of the mysteries of jelly making. I wouldn't fool around with the proportions of ingredients (sugar and vinegar) you could run into food safety issues, they are what preserve the jelly safely.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly.  When finished, I tasted a hint of jalapeno, a lot of sweet, and it had the strong smell/taste of cider vinegar.
Not to give up easily, thinking this should have more of a savory taste, even though it is jelly, I made the following adjustments.
I used white wine vinegar.  I sweated a coarsely chopped white onion and 6 cloves of garlic until they were sweet and translucent. I added a seasoning bag containing 1 tsp mustard seed, 1 tsp crushed red pepper, 1 tbsp pickling spice, and 1 tbsp whole peppercorns and the vinegar, being careful to make exactly 2 cups.  I added 1 cup of water.  I added the red and green pepper, and jalapeno (leaving some of the seeds for heat) and simmered for 30 minutes until the peppers were "cooked".  At this point I removed the spice bag.  I added the sugar and continued to simmer mixture until all the sugar was dissolved.  I brought the mixture to a rolling boil for one full minute, added the pectin, and stirred until all the pectin was dissolved, another 2-3 minutes.  I shut off the heat, let sit for 2-3 minutes, then filled my sterilized jars.  I processed the filled jars in a hot water bath for 30 minutes to remove any remaining air from the jars.  Upon removing the jars from the simmering water, they promptly sealed themselves within 30 minutes.  On tasting this further revised recpie with the savory additions, the added texture is a real winner.  Try it; you'll like it!!

This is a wonderful recipe -- especially for a novice like me -- this is my first time to make jelly!  Three important things I learned, though: 1.  For heat, I used the seeds of four of the 12 jalapenos.  2.  Definitely, squeeze out as much water from the chopped peppers as possible (I used paper towels).  The first time mine didn't set well and I think that was the reason.  3.  WASH HANDS or wear gloves when working with the peppers.  I accidently rubbed my nose -- ouch!!  Finally, this recipe really comes together when put on cream cheese.  The colors contrast beautifully against the white cream cheese and the spicy against the sweet is just wonderful!

I made this recipe with both red and green peppers and it looks wonderful on my Christmas treat table. We served it on crackers with a bit of cream cheese. Make sure you keep the fan going while you cook the recipe as the vapor from the peppers can burn your eyes. Thanks for the recipe!!!

If there were more stars available I would rate this jelly higher! I followed the recipe exactly and licked the pot before I washed it! I got 5-8oz jars and I made it to give away but I may have to make another batch so I can keep some too.

Absolutely fabulous recipe.  My father-in-law accepts it as payment for plowing the driveway in the winter!  Make sure to chop peppers very finely and flip the jars to evenly distribute the peppers.  This is truly a great recipe, even people who wrinkled their noses at the idea of pepper jelly loved it when they tried it!

This jelly is fantastic.  The taste is out of this world.  Just delicious.  I am giving the recipe 4 stars rather than 5, though, because my jelly did not set up even though I followed the instructions exactly.  Upon reading some of the other reviews, I realized what might have gone wrong.  The recipe never instructs you to cook to a certain temp, rather it just uses time.  I un-jarred all my jelly and re-cooked it, this time using a candy thermometer and boiling until the temperature reached 220, which is the jel or set point.  I filled the jars and re-processed, and the jelly set up perfectly.  To ensure good results, use a candy thermometer and cook the mixture (after adding the pectin) to 220-225 before turning off the heat.

I would give this 6 stars if I could.  It was comparable to the stuff the gourmet shop sells for $7 a jar.  I doubled the jalepenos and reduced the pectin.  Serve it over Cream Cheese and enjoy with wheat crackers.  I will be giving this out to everyone at christmas time!

This recipe deserves the rave reviews it has received.  I have made at least 10 batches over the last 3 years. My friends literally beg for a jar when I make it.  Up until this year, I had never had the problem with the peppers floating to the top.  Last month I made 2 batches over 2 days, and one of the batches had the peppers beautifully dispersed but with the other, the peppers floated to the top.  I kept thinking about what I had done differently to the two batches.  The only difference that I could come up with was that the peppers had been refrigerated over night before I made the second batch.  So.....I tested the theory and made two more batches.  (Much to the delight of my friends and family!) Mystery solved.....cold peppers rose to the top, room temperature peppers dispersed beautifully throughout. Coincidence?  Hope not.  But if the peppers do float to the top, turn the jars upside down for a while until they look beautiful and then set them upright again.  Not long afterwards, they will still "pop".

Also....using different brands of pectin products makes a huge difference in the final outcome of this jelly.  I use the Certo 85 ml package with about an extra 1/8 cup added.  It is perfect if you like your jelly a little on the "wet" side.  Use both packages if you like it firmly set (like j-ello). 

Enjoy the jelly.  It won't last for long!!

1. I used a mix of hot peppers and left in all of the seeds - I didn't think it would be hot enough for my liking without them. The heat on the sample I tried was perfect, so I'm glad I went that way (might choose differently if using habaneros or the like, but my jalapenos were not very hot). 2. I read one of the notes from someone who said not to make a double batch at one time. I'm glad I followed this advice - the mixture foams like all heck when it boils, and it DEFINITELY would have boiled out of the pan I used and made a big huge dangerous boiling sugar and hot pepper mess, had I tried to make a double batch. 3. One batch made almost exactly 12, 1/2 cup jars for me, with the jelly just the tiniest bit shy in the final one (if it doesn't seal, stick it in the fridge to eat fresh). 4. I left 1/4" of headspace on the jars and all sealed (including 4, 1-cup jars I did in the second batch). 5. I processed all of the jars, both sizes, for 5 minutes in a regular boiling water bath (vs. with a pressure cooker). 6. The finished color truly is beautiful - I look forward to giving these away as Christmas gifts! I would make this recipe again, gladly. Relatively easy, inexpensive ingredients, great results.

This is a wonderful recipe. I had extra Jalapeno pepper after making salsa and wanted to find a creative way to use them.  I did make some changes to the recipe since I wanted to use powder pectin. I found that 1/2 cup jalapeno peppers was close to 4 peppers (add the seeds and veins of two or you will get VERY little heat) and 1 cup of red bell pepper was one good size pepper. I followed steps  1 and 2 as written. For step 3 I mixed 1 1/4 cup cold water and 7 tablespoons of bulk pectin (about 1 and 3/4 boxes, there are 4 tlb. in a box) I mixed and boiled this mixture for 1 min. Then I followed step 3.  After step 3 I put the mixture back on the stove to boil for 3 min (this will also disolve the skin that forms on the top of the mixture during cooling).  I then put the mixture into jars and processed in a hot water bath for 10 min. to ensure a good seal.  I made three batches and they all jelled up and taste wonderful. My first batch I did not add the veins and seeds of two peppers the the heat is VERY mild. It was much better when I added some pep!! I got a little over 6 - 8 ounce jars with each batch.  Hope that this helps you!

Ok, I made this yesterday and followed the recipe almost exactly.  I use about 1 cup of Jalapeno peppers and 1 cup of the Red Bell pepper.  I left the seeds and veins in one of my 4 very large chilies.  I timed each step perfectly. It never set up.  So tonight I researched on how to fix unset jelly.  I tried the easiest method which is to reboil no more than 4 cups at a time to 220 degrees.  It was so thick as I poured it back into the cleaned jars and new lids I think this will set up.  Only BIG problem is that my 6 half pint jars went down to 4 half pint jars when I was finished.  How come so many people had no problem?  It does taste fantastic though.  I will try another batch this weekend but will boil after the pectin.

Yes, a very good pepper jelly. But, as written: the heat not very hot, the color not very red, and the smell/taste a little heavy on cider vinegar.
Try this:
FOR MORE HEAT:Use all ribs and a few of the seeds. Whirr 'til almost liquid.
FOR NATURAL DEEP COLOR: Toss thick sliced fresh BEETS into the boil, to be fished out before decanting into the jars.
FOR CLEANER PEPPER TASTE: Go 1/2 Cider 1/2 White Vinegar - Better.
USE ONLY LIQUID PECTIN!!! Or suffer.
Thanks for the recipe, very nice.

I made this for the first time one week ago. Easy recipe but was a tad too sweet. I decided to try it again yesterday. This time I used 5 jalapenos, one large red pepper and 3 shakes of crushed red pepper. Much better this time. The sweetness was gone but it was not so hot that you couldn't eat it. I plan to make a 3rd batch and will add yet another jalapeno. Quick and easy recipe. Makes great gift for give-aways during the holidays. Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful taste and looks great too.  This was my first time to make Jelly.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY, but it did not "set".  After researching I found that after you ad the pectin the mixture needs to be returned to a hard boil which was left out of that step.  I "fixed" what I had.  With that aside nothing compares to the flavor.  I still give this 5 stars.

I'm not sure why other reviewers are having trouble with the peppers staying suspended in the jelly.  I diced my peppers in a food processor and then placed two layers of paper towels in a colander and let it absorb some of the water.  Also if your jelly doesn't set be sure that you use TWO packets of Sure Jell because the recipe calls for six ounces. One packet is only three ounces.

I made two batches of this today and they both turned out perfect.  I used red, orange and yellow for my bell peppers and also added a habanero to the jalapenos for each batch.  I plan on making more of this, and soon!  Very tasty and very easy recipe.  I'm hooked.

I was scared to try canning, but this was easy. I made sure to wear gloves and a scarf to keep from burning my hands, nose, or lungs. I'm going to make some more batches, some spicier to give as gifts. I used the Ball canning guide to help with the particulars of canning. The guide came in the box of Pectin.

Very good.  I used the no-sugar needed dry pectin and used 4 cups of Splenda and 1 cup sugar to about 8 jalapenos and 1/2 a green pepper.  Very good over cream cheese with crackers.  Gave as a gift for Christmas and it was a hit!

I just made this today. FIRST WEAR GLOVES!!!!! I cannot stress enough, you HAVE to wear gloves. Maybe I got a really crazy batch of jalapenos, but my hands have burned for HOURS. Second, watch carefully and use a BIG pot. I only used a 4qt, and it boiled over. It is not easy to clean up syrup on a ceramic stovetop. Other than that, I followed to a T. Turned out great, looks fantastic with the specks of red and green. If you do happen to not use gloves, I found scrubbing your hands with a nail brush SUPER well, and with rather hot water for rinsing. After that, rub those owie fingers on stainless steel. YES, your sink, you spoons, your pots. It DOES work, at least for me...

This pepper jelly tasted wonderful and set up perfectly (solid, not wet, but not jello-y, and it spreads easily)!  I just made this yesterday and tried it out this morning on crackers with cream cheese.  Divine!  My 10 year old daughter asked for a toasted bagel with cream cheese and pepper jelly for breakfast! :) I used the ingredient list and quantities from this recipe, but followed the instructions from the box of Ball brand pectin (Boil peppers, vinegar, and sugar for 10 minutes.  Add 6 oz liquid pectin all at once and boil an additional minute.  Pour into jars and process.).  Then I turned the jars 4 times, every 30 minutes while it was setting up, to evenly distribute the pepper bits.  Oh, I added the seeds and ribs of 2 jalapenos and it was perfect!  Just enough heat to know that there's some jalapenos in there, but not so much that the kids and people who don't like things too spicy will complain.  Great recipe!

I used banana peppers and one green bell pepper and then fresh jalapenoes.  Also added 3x the cayenne and used white vinegar.   No food coloring...  EXCELLENT!!!  Oh MY!

I have used this recipe for over 3 years. The only thing I do differently is I add more peppers than what is called for and I leave the veins & seeds in. I have also started adding some serrano peppers and a habanero or 2. Great flavor. Just finished making a batch for Christmas presents at work.

I've been buying this for years from an upscale store for store for $12 a jar and i made this whole batch of 6, 8oz jars for less than $10. I just did a little "taste test" and at half a jar. YUM! Its really really good. I did just as stated, only adding a little red pepper flakes, and it turned out PERFECT! This was my first time canning and it was super easy. I thought i needed to buy that expensive canning pot, but read on a website just to put a towel down in the bottom of the stock pot to keep them from breaking. Worked like a charm! Some people said something about a "waterbath". I don't know what that means. I kept the jars in the boiling water until i was ready to pour. I heard them pop closed after about 15 minutes. Worked like a charm! FABULOUS RECIPIE!

This turned out excellent despite being a novice jelly maker. My big mistake was using too small a pot and too high a temperature which caused the mix to boil over making one heck of a mess. I substituted lemon drop chili peppers (home grown) and sweet yellow pepper because I needed to find something to make with the excess of chili peppers my plants are producing. I served the jelly with cream cheese and crackers and it was awesome. I may leave the seeds and ribs in next time to see if that gives an extra little kick.

sooo sooo good.  The only change I made was to increase the amount of jalapeno and decrease (slightly) the amount of bell because I have a high tolerance and wanted it spicy.  Not only did my husband love it as well, but guests who had it begged for the jars I had left and said I should mass produce and sell at farmers markets.  I think that means it was a hit!

This is even better than the "Pepper Relish" sold by a major retailer.  I used one large red bell pepper (to equal one cup), two medium jalapenos with ribs and seeds, plus one additional jalapeno without the ribs and seeds (total of 3 jalapenos to equal 1/2 cup).  I followed the recipe, as written with one exception... I added 1-1/2 TBSP of minced garlic jarred in olive oil. My batch is deliciously spicy and perfectly savory. I read somewhere that adding a touch of oil reduces the foaming (which is why I chose jarred minced garlic, rather than fresh garlic). I cannot say for sure if this is true or not. Though, I did not have any problems with over-foaming, and I did not need to skim any foam off the boiled mixture. My batch filled 5 8oz jars exactly.   FYI on pepper burns.  I read other's reviews and did not believe the peppers would burn my skin since I am not super sensitive. However, after dicing 3 jalapenos, my hands burned horribly the first day.  I soaked them in cold milk for 15 minutes, then spread olive oil onto my hands. The olive oil helped.   It does soak in fairly well after 10-20 minutes. Everytime I washed my hands, I had to reapply olive oil since I could feel the burn come back.

I am a first time jelly maker.  This was fabulous!!!  Addicting with cream cheese and wheat thins.  Everyone loved it!!!  This was amazing.  I read the reviews and tweeked it a little.  I used 1 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, 4 1/2 cups sugar, 12 jalapenos (four with seeds)making 3/4 cups, 3/4 cups red bell pepper.  Boiled for 5 min while stirring the whole time, cooled off for 2 min while stirring, added liquid pectin, poured into jars, topped with lids, boiled jars for 5 min. to seal lids...turned every half hour for 2 1/2 hours...set perfectly by the last 1/2 hour.  Added red food coloring, next time I will try without, but was the best jelly ever!!!  So easy and yummy!!  Thanks so much for the recipe, can't say enough about it.

I had never made jelly...yet I wanted a shelf stable item to give out during the holidays.  Everyone who received one compliments me and asks for more.  Even a year or more after I gave it to them.

As another reviewers experience, I also thought this to be was too vinegary.  I'm glad that I tried it first before I gave some away as gifts. It could be that I'm not use to taste of apple cider vinegar.   I will stick to my other recipe but did like your idea and the pictures submitted do look pretty neat.

If I could give this 10 stars I would!!!  I printed the recipe 3 years ago...I better finally review it.  I followed the recipe exactly except instead of green pepper I used red, yellow and orange all mixed together.  I left in half of the jalapeno seeds for some heat too.  I also add red food coloring to make it more festive.

My daughter and I made this today....easy to do We doubled the recipe without a problem. Had to watch the boiling because of the amount but otherwise everything went well. Used liquid pectin as stated. The recipe filled 12 1 cup or 250ml jars. I used 3 lg red peppers and 5 jalapeno peppers Left in half of the seeds for a little more heat. Drained the red peppers for about 20 min. So thank you Marbalet for a wonderful Xmas recipe we will be making for years to come

I used a cup and a half of jalapeno, omitting the red pepper. I removed all seeds and ribs - next time I will leave the ribs to add some heat as this was very mild. Good jelly and I received numerous compliments. I'll definitely make more. WEAR GLOVES!!! I didn't even think about it as I have chopped jalapenos before with no issue, but not in this large amount. It came on very gradually but my fingers were on fire all afternoon and night. This was after washing them repeatedly, applying aloe, soaking in milk, cleaning with alcohol then Goop, applying A&D ointment (don't do this), pressing lemon/juice onto them and finally resting in sour cream. Not a joke folks.

Phenomenal recipe. I made it with the exact quantities given in the recipe, but made some changes based on the reviews.  I wrung out as much liquid as I could from the peppers so the finished product would have some clarity, added some cayenne for an additional kick, and turned the jars occasionally to distribute the flakes.  The flavor was perfect for gifts, however, I'd fire it up some more the next time I make it.

Just put up my second batch of this jelly. Wow! Followed instructions exactly in batch one: Very yummy, suitable for everyone! For batch 2: Added 1 small habenaro pepper, as well many of the seeds from the jalapenos ~ holy smokes! Super nice kick, hubby said it's the best he's ever tasted! This recipe is a keeper! Thanks!

This is just delicious.  I made two batches in two days for Christmas gifts and they both turned out perfectly. I always try to follow the recipe the same way it was written and the only thing I changed was that I used frozen red and green peppers instead of spending all the time chopping. I just put them in a fine strainer and let them strain for about 5 minutes in case they were extra juicy. Other than that I used the exact amounts and cooking times and I was only 20 minutes from start to finish. They look beautiful in their bottles and are ready for a pretty topper and into their gift bags.

Very good recipe; but I made a few alterations to it as my family didn't care for the acidity of the apple cider vinegar.  This is my alteration:
3/4 cup of white vinegar; 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar, & 1/8 cup minced garlic.  YUM YUM!  I hope you like it!

This is a great recipe.  I use jalapeno peppers as well as cayenne peppers which I grow in my garden.  Serve this over a block of cream cheese with crackers for an easy appetizer.

I cut this recipe in half because I only had 2 1/2 cups of sugar on hand. I also left about half of the jalapeno seeds IN the mixture, because I prefer spicy food ... and WOW is all I can say! It was absolutely PERFECT!!! I was able to make three 8 ounce jars and I will be making many more for Christmas gifts this year!

This jelly is super good.  We had it on Ritz with whipped cream cheese and it was delicious! We made 2 batches and got exactly 6 half pint jars from each batch.  We used up the jalapenos that were left on our plants which had turned red - I think we used about 8 pretty small japalenos to get a 1/2 cup.  Since the jalapenos were red, I used a green bell pepper. This was the first time I've made jelly or done any canning and the jars sealed up perfectly.  Will be giving these out for Christmas.  If everyone likes them, it'll be added to our annual Christmas baskets.  Thanks!

This was my first time to can anything and it went great! The taste of the jelly was delicous on crackers with cream cheese. The only problem I had was not using a big enough pot when boiling the jelly. Also, I only sterilized 4 jelly jars but the original recipe surely would have fit into 5 jelly jars.

LOVE THE TASTE!!!!!!  Made 2 batches and gave them out as Christmas gifts.  WILL definitely do this again next year.  I chopped the peppers using a food processor which made it much easier.  The second batch I took others advice and left the jalapeno seeds in to give it more heat.  I ended up giving two types of pepper jelly away-Sweet Pepper Jelly and Spicey Pepper Jelly.  Many thanks for a great posting!

This is my favorite new Christmas recipe for 2007 ~ I am certain to make it throughout the year! The flavor is clean with a sweet spiciness and looks very "Christmasy" in the jars. Do wear gloves when processing the jalapenos! While other reviewer recommended turning/flipping the jars, I only did it with my first batch and WILL NOT do it again as it caused the jelly to become cloudy. My second batch, I followed the directions exactly as written and every jar came out picture perfect with the peppers evenly distributed throughout the crystal clear jelly. To remove excess pepper liquid after the food processor, I pressed the peppers with the back of a spoon in a wire colander. If you've never made jelly, give this recipe a try and you'll be pleased with the results!

Outstanding flavor and color.  People do really like receiving it as a Christmas gift.  I had better success in having the jelly jell when I drained off the majority of the liquid from the processed peppers.  I just left enough in to have a soft texture, not so much that the pieces were "floating."  It made a BIG difference.  You may also use canned/jarred jalepenos if you want to avoid the unpleasantness of processing those pesky hot peppers.  Otherwise, make sure you have LOTS of ventilation, or you will regret it.  When thinned down, this jelly also makes an excellent cooking sauce for chicken.

I tried a jalapeno jelly at a friends house and it was great. Someone had made it for them so they didn't have the recipe. I found this one and it turned out exactly like the one I tried. The only thing I did is used 3/4 cup of jalapenos as we like it with a little more bite. Excellent recipe.

This was deeelicious!  I followed the recipe exactly down to the minute, and it worked perfectly.  I followed someone else's suggestion about doing one batch at a time.  The one thing I would change for next time is use more jalapeno seeds because I love the spice.  This tastes wonderful as a sweet pepper jelly.  This is going to be a wonderful gift to my friends!  (Note: Don't be afraid of the apple cider vinegar.  I was hesitant that it would taste like vinegar, and it didn't.)

Oh my gosh........one of the best things I have made from this site!  It is amazing in the addicting kinda way.  Definitely more than a 5 star rating.    I did leave some of the seeds and the membranes in the jalapeños as I wanted the heat.  I took a jar to school to share and a block of cream cheese - they loved it also.  The color is such a beautiful orangy-red and will make a nice gift at Christmas.  I plan on adding a block of cream cheese and a box of crackers to go with it.  We also enjoyed this on the Golden Cheddar Muffins from this site.  Getting the ingredients for another batch this weekend.  Thanks MARBALET for this MOST delicious recipe.

I made this for the first time a week ago...the taste is amazing, on a bagel with cream cheese it tastes just like poppers!! I used about 30 small bird chillies and 3 large jalapeños, didnt remove seeds from any of them, so it has a kick!! Only problem is that its consistency is more like honey?!!! I am planning on giving it another go tomorrow, any suggestions?? Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly, but added seeds and veins with the jalapenos. I made 2 separate batches, one red, and one green, and also added a few drops of food coloring in each to brighten the color. It made exactly 6 (8 ounce) jars. I was a little concerned when it did not "set up" before going to bed, but they were all perfect this morning, set and all sealed. Great recipe!

I was going to give this 4 stars at first because of the strong cider vinegar taste when I first tried it.  Then it's like the flavors blended better after the first 24 hours.  When I found myself eating it straight out of the jar, I changed my rating.  LOL  Make sure to mince the peppers finely so you don't have large chunks of pepper skins stuck in your teeth.  I used 1 large red bell pepper and 4 good sized jalapenos with seeds from 2 peppers.  Just the right amount of heat.  Yield was 2-1/2 pint-size jars.  The half jar didn't last long, and my mother already took one of the two jars!  Got to make more!

Excellent!!!!!! although I did change it a bit. I used 4 chile peppers and half of a habenero (sp?).  It also seemed not to need as much pectin.  It tasted wonderful and my husband raved over it.

I have now made 2 batches of this recipe and everyone who has tasted it loved it.  I was going to use some green food coloring, but it turned out more red than green, so maybe next time I'll use red food coloring.  On my first batch I only had limited success with getting the vacuum to form, so on the second batch I processed them in a 5 minute water bath and they were perfect!

I was kind of skeptical of this recipe because of the vinegar... that and I don't like spicy and I'm not a big jelly fan.  But this turned out great.  It had just the right amount of sweetness with a subtle hint of spiciness.  Since I was skeptical I halved the recipe.  The jelly came out quite gel'd.  Had to heat up in microwave before serving.  I will definitely make the full batch the next time, but I still might not add the full of pectin.

3 ¾ c. bell peppers, finely cut (food processor works well)
¼ c. jalapenos* including seeds and membranes, finely cut (again food processor works well)
1 c. apple cider vinegar
2/3 c. dutch jell
•	Mix these in a pan.  Bring to a rolling boil. 

5 c. sugar
•	After the jelly mixture boils, add the sugar and keep on the heat.  Stir constantly until it reaches a rolling boil.  Boil for 1-2 minutes.  (Skim foam if you want, but it’s only for looks.)  

•	Immediately ladle jelly into jars and put on lids and rings.  Turn upside down for 5 minutes, then turn right side up and let them cool.

*1/2 c. jalapenos makes a medium heat jelly (on the hot side of medium) 
Usually makes 7 half pints.

WOW! I follwed the recipe as it was. It was easy and delish! It is amazing heated and used as a dip. Cream cheese wontons are a must for this. I also drizzled it on my fried rice, and wow!

Excellent!  We make batches of this along with our salsa (since we already have peppers, jalapenos, vinegar and sugar out).  It's ALWAYS a hit, and won me the Best Dish at a family reunion!

This jelly is FANTASTIC! I have never made or eaten jalapeno jelly before, so with the wonderful crop of jalapenos that I got this year I thought I'd give it a go, and was glad I did! I made it exactly as written, aside from chopping the peppers by hand ( I was afraid that they would get too mushy) and
adding none of the seeds from the red pepper, but all of the seeds (and veins) from the jalapenos. This came together in a snap and set up beautifully (I did decide to process the jars for 10 mins. just to ensure that they would seal properly). I had no issue with the peppers setteling to the bottom, they were nice and distributed throughout. We are loving the sweet/heat combination. I was able to get almost 6 1/2 pint jars out of this recipe. This will definately be a yearly canning staple in our house! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used this recipe as the basis for making cayenne jelly spread (I grow my own cayenne).  I added a little more bell peppers, one jalapenos, and about 4 fresh cayenne peppers. I lightly processed them so it wasn't like a paste.....more like salsa. I also used one package of powder pectin.  I would maybe add another half pack if you want a it to be more gel-like.  Mine, with one package, was like syrup, but great over a bagel and cream cheese or in a chicken sandwich.

This is fantastic jalapeno jelly. Everyone who tries it wants his or her own jar. I've made 6 batches, and I don't know if I'll have enough left for Christmas presents! I like things spicy, so I'm generous with the jalapenos, and I don't worry about seeding them. The jelly is beautiful to look at and delicious to eat.

Oh my gosh! This was my first experience canning and this recipe was not only easy but quite tasty. I LOVE it. I am making several jars for Christmas gifts this year. I was delighted to hear each one pop as it sealed. Thanks for a great recipe. I made 2 batches and used a bit more jalapeno for the second batch. It was just the right amount of spicy for me. Saving the milder for friends whose palates are a bit different than mine.

This jelly recipe isn't bad for a straightforward pepper jelly introduction, but there aren't enough hot peppers in the recipe to make it even a little bit spicy.

Very good. I saved the seeds and the white veins from the peppers and put them in a piece of cheese cloth to boil along with the peppers to add a little more heat. After the peppers were cooked I just took it out. It worked perfectly. During the final stages of cooking I added a little food coloring a suggested by other reviewers. Looks very pretty. I also flipped the jars as suggested to evenly distribute the peppers throughout the jelly. I also wanted to use a variety of bell peppers and couldn't find them fresh so I used frozen. I thawed them, used a processor to chop them into smaller pieces and then squeezed out excess liquid.

This was my first attempt at making jelly, and it came out great. I used red, yellow and orange bell peppers (it looked more like autumn than Christmas) and changed the ratio to half bell peppers and half jalapenos. I made this twice and the first time all my jars didn't seal, so the next batch I did not let the mixture cool. After boiling for 3 minutes I took it off the heat, stirred in the pectin and filled the jars. They all sealed perfectly and set up just right. I will be making many more batches for gift giving.

Fantastic!!!  Loved the sweet/hot flavor.  Tried on crackers with cream cheese...will try as a glaze next.  My first experience making any kind of jelly turned out perfect.  It set just right.  Made 6 jars and sent to some pepper loving friends...they loved it too!  My next batch will be changed just the slightest bit....to add 1/4 C. more jalapeno and 1/4 C. less red bell pepper. Thank you!

This is the best jelly I have ever had.  It's great for parties with crackers and cream cheese.  My fiance finished off two jars in just a few days and he wasn't happy when I took one to work to share!

It's so pretty!  My first time canning anything and all my jars sealed!  I love that "pop"!  Admittedly, I haven't opened one of the jars yet, but a "finger-through-the-remnants-in-the-pan" test tasted great.  I got 12 4-oz jars from this recipe.

After reading the reviews and doing a lot of research online, I did the following:

* Followed exact quantities per the recipe.  Per one of the reviews, I had the peppers at room temperture.  Not sure that helped with the disbursement of the peppers, but the peppers are suspended beautifully without having to do the flip tip mentioned in some reviews.  Another tip I followed was to put the veins and seeds of a few of the jalepeno peppers (maybe 4) in a tea ball and put in the jelly while cooking.  You get the heat but can easily remove the seeds and veins from the final product so your jelly looks beautiful. 
* After buying the wrong kind of pectin...TWICE...I finally found liquid pectin at my local grocery.  Research online said not to substitute the power for the liquid.  The jelly was setting up before I got all the jars filled. I'm in NC so didn't have to make any altitude adjustments. The liquid pectin kept the jelly crystal clear.  I understand that powder pectin may have caused the jelly to be cloudy.
* After filling all the jars, I processed them in a boiling water bath for 5 minutes.

The jelly looks to have set in the cooled jars.  The jelly is a beautiful clear amber color with red and green peppers suspended throughtout.

For those who have mentioned that your hands burned. Take a large bowl and put some ice in it, then put another bowl on top of the ice, pour in straight apple cider vinegar and put your hands in the vinegar until the burning subsides. Im allergic to them and that works very well. Its also what poison control will tell you to do for jalapeno burns.

I made half a batch, using the addtional pepper flakes and cayenne recommended by jennyava.  I have canning directions that say to put the filled jars in a canning rack and boil in a large pot for ten minutes.  Maybe that isn't neccessary with this recipe but I did it anyway. This was my first time canning & I was very pleased with the results.  Very tasty!

This is awesome! I made 70 or so little jars for friends and family for the holidays. The only things I did differently is I added some crushed dried peppers with the seeds (i think the seeds look pretty in the jelly when its done) and I turned my jars over every 10-15min or so and that distributes the peppers throughout the jelly until it cools otherwise they settle at the top. I have been asked for this recipe numerous times and come out looking like a rock star, so thank you!

Love this jelly and so pretty!! And, it tastes great! I, like other readers, left some of the seeds and membranes in the jalapenos and the heat is perfect for us (we don't like things too spicy). Other than that change I followed the recipe exactly as written. I tried it on a biscuit because I don't have any cream cheese in the house, but I'm heading to the store tomorrow to get some and try on onion crackers. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great recipe! I was weary of the strong vinegar smell while it was canning but when it's done and chilled, it tastes almost like a corn relish, very tasty! NOTE: I used 4 oz jelly jars and it made 11 jars. I also used 2 med red bell peppers and 4 med-lg jalapenos, all of which I completely seeded. Also a food processor would be useful, I chopped all the peppers with a hand chopper and it took forever.

I keep pepper jelly on hand because it's great with most every dish. I made a batch using your recipe this AM. What I wouldn't give for you to see it. It is perfect in every way. I didn't use a food processor but kept the peppers cut in large chunks so they could be easily scooped out and the jelly would be clear. I used green food coloring and made no other changes. No muss, no fuss; just great pepper jelly in a jiffy! Thank you for sharing!!

Just made my first batch.  I did not have enough cider vinegar, so I used half cider, half white and it turned out great. I did a boiling water bath and the peppers stayed dispersed, I did not have to turn the jars at all.  I had enough left to enjoy already. THank You for such a great recipe.  I am sure I will be making more of this.

I have never made jelly before, so this was a bit of an adventure. My yield was a bit lower than others' -- 4 x 8 oz jars. I canned and processed for 20 minutes, and used the ribs and seeds of 2 peppers as others had suggested. I also added 6 drops of red food coloring. The result is a beautiful and absolutely delicious jelly! Just the right amount of sweet and spicy, so yummy with crackers and cream cheese. I bought too many peppers and was trying to figure out what to do with the leftovers, but I think I'll just go ahead and make more of this amazing jelly. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This is so good and so easy to make. You can use it for so many things. Glaze chicken or ham, add to marinades or stir fries. We also mix a little catsup with it and it makes wonderful sweet-sour sauce for egg rolls. It is also good just as is on a buttered English muffin!

Excellent. Gave this as christmas gifts and everyone just loved it. It's great on crackers with cream cheese or used as a glaze on chicken (just mix it with dijon mustard and some honey).

Looks and tastes great!  Next time I will use 1 1/2 packs of pectin because it is not as firm as I would have liked. Otherwise it is wonderful! Thank you.

This recipe was really pretty and delightful to give as a gift.  The first batch I made was not hot at all so I would recommend putting in all the jalepeno seeds the first time and scaling down from there unless yo want not-hot pepper jelly.  I tried the turning trick but it was only partly successful as the jelly set up really fast.  The most time consuming aspect of this recipe is preparing the peppers, which I had to do by hand (no food processer for me!).  I will definately be making this again.

2 HUGE tips.  Chop the peppers and then use your hand held blender to puree the peppers to a finer consistency.  Second tip is to add red food coloring.  I use the gel food coloring.  Very pretty.

Very pretty and very easy. I took up the suggestion to boil the seeds from the jalapenos in a tea ball with the rest of the peppers. The jelly has a great zing. I also did the turning thing while the jars were cooling. I used both Certo packets from the 6 oz. box. I wasn't sure if I should use both, but the jelly turned out fine.

Different from the recipe: I put the jars in a hot water bath for five minutes (like most jelly recipes).

I was expecting something spicier when I made this.  It is very sweet and not very hot.  I think next time I'll try to make it with less sugar and more jalapenos to see if that corrects the problem.  Someone mentioned that altering the recipe might change the balance that keeps it safe when canned, I don't know if that will but we'll see.

I have tried many jalapeno jelly recipes and none of them are as pretty as this one.  I left out the food color and it has a real clear red tint.  I give jelly for Christmas presents and this recipe is perfect!  I have also had trouble getting the jelly to get firm and this recipe was firm by the time I took it out of the water bath.  Great recipe!

Very good, but I would like it hotter. I adjusted the red pepper to 3/4 cup and the jalapeno to 3/4 cup. Should I leave the jalapeno seeds in? Also it tasted a little vinegary. Although this was because I ran out of jars and had some left over and just put it in a bowl and tasted it a couple hours later. Maybe it needs to meld more?

This is really good. A friend sells jalapeno jelly at craft shows and wouldn't share the recipe. This is really close. I cut back on the pectin as I wanted this a little runny. Wonderful to spoon over cream cheese and serve with crackers. Beautiful in the jar!

I made it last year and ppl raved so, I'm attempting it again this year. I found the recipe now having a year of canning experience under my belt. My advic - follow the directions inside the pectin box but, follow the other measurements of ingredients from the Allrecipes one AND WRITE DOWN WHAT YOU DID SO YOU CAN REPRODUCE IT IF IT WORKS.

This recipe is just the right amount of sweet and heat.  I followed the ingredients exactly.  The only thing I did differently was to put the peppers and vinegar in the food process and blend to a puree.  The rest I followed exactly.  By making the puree 1st, it suspended evenly through out the jelly for the perfect taste combination.  Thank you Marbalet for this great recipe!

My daughter and I tried this recipe for the first time following recipe. But instead of measuring the peppers we used 6 jalapeño (reserving one for garnish) and one large red bell pepper. We only cleaned seeds and ribs from the bell pepper and one jalapeno pepper for garniah...but left the seeds and ribs in the other five jalapeños and minced in a food processor. Also since we were giving as gifts, after we filled the jars, we put jars in a water bath for ten minutes just to insure the seal. Also before putting on the lids, garnish each jar of jam with some diced jalapeño. The vinegar gives the jam a nice yellow and the green and red peppers make it very Christmasy. You dont taste the vinegar at all. Everyone who tried it loves it. Well except for my husband. We're still laughing heartily over the faces he made trying to get the cracker, cream cheese, and jam past his tongue. Our daughter had to give him the jug of milk to drink....really, unless you put the jam alone on your tongue, its not as hot as he portrayed it to be....he just likes plain old boring food. LOL.  The seeds give it a nice after bite. Caution! When prepping the peppers for the food processor, wear two pairs of food prep gloves or your hands will be stinging for quite a while. Make sure you read the ounces on the liquid pectin pouch or you'll get too little or too much. Six ounces is perfect. Sets almost  immediately.

For my first time this jelly was very easy to make.  I was excited to use things that I had in my garden.  Also a first for me.  I have made this recipe twice and the only thing I did differently the second time was I used 1 cup white wine vinegar.  The first time around I used 1 cup white wine vinegar and 1/2 cup cider vinegar.  In my opinion the cider vinegar is too bitter.  Also I used 12 jalapenos both times.  The second batch I left the seeds.  Perfect taste for my family.  Enjoy with cream cheese and crackers.  I got 12 4 oz jars and 1 nearly full 8 oz for the batch I made.  Thanks for the recipes.  I can't wait to share these for the holidays.

I cut the recipe in half and used 3/4 c. of assorted diced hot peppers. I used Thai Bird's Eye peppers, one jalapeno and a habanero. The jelly came out hot and delicious. My jelly had a lot of unattractive tiny air bubbles in it though. I've had numerous jelly failures but never that one so I don't know what I did wrong. One pectin for half a batch was more than enough. It set up well and very quickly. It might have set up so quickly because the peppers I used were very dry. I think that had something to do with getting tiny bubbles? (The jelly started setting up before I got it in the jar.) It's not the recipe's fault so I still have to give it 5 stars for taste. But I probably won't make it again until I figure out why the jelly is so bubbly.

This really is very, very good and easy.  Made 4 batches this week.  Made red, then green versions and added food coloring.  Used 1 1/2 pkgs of SureJell.  Bumped up the jalapenos to probably 2/3 cup in the last two batches.  Hope it's not too hot.  Just wanted a little more kick.  Wonderful on Laughing Cow lite cheese with crackers.  Yum-O!!!!

This was FANTASTIC....everyone loved it and have asked for the recipe. I put some in jelly jars with crackers and cheeses etc for Christmas gifts.  We not only use this on crackers, but also on chicken, steak and pork when we BarBQue. It's great !!! Next time I will add more Jalapeno peppers( as we like hot spicy foods) and some red flaked peppers.

This is so easy and delish.  Make sure you use a large pot or you have a good chance of a huge mess and a fire hazard.  I strain out the peppers, just like mine smooth. I do wish I could get it a little spicier, must be my peppers.

Very dissapointed in this recipe given its 4 1/2 star average.  I am rating this recipe based on how it was written.  I don't want to have to read 100 reviews to see the tweaks everyone did.  WAY to thick (too much pectin) and no hot jalapeno kick which I realize is personal preference.  I will not use this recipe again.

It was too sweet.  My peppers weren't very hot, perhaps a hotter pepper would have cut the sweet.  I will try again.  It set up very firm, not sure what I did wrong.  It did look beautiful, though.  I did not have any trouble with the peppers floating to the top.

This is delicious and very pretty.  I gave some as gifts.  We've eaten it with cream cheese and Wheat Thins and even the kids loved it.  I also added it to bbq sauce and used it on ribs. Fantastic recipe!  Thanks!

This tastes great. Everyone loves it. We pour it over cream cheese and use crackers to scoop it up. Was a little to thick though , I cut the pectin in half.

This recipe is so easy and wonderful! I've never made jelly before, but have made this jelly four times over the past several days.... and it turns out perfectly every time. The first batch was good, but not enough heat for me. For my subsequent batches I've upped the jalapeno peppers to 3 (for a little heat) and 4 for more heat. I left the seeds and ribs in.  All the peppers get a whirl in my mini processor... and no straining is necessary. No turning of the jars is necessary either. It sets up wonderfully.

Excellent!! I used 5 Jalapeno peppers and 1 1/2 red peppers and minced in my food processor and added some of the seeds from the peppers. Giving as gifts for Christmas in baskets I made that will included a wine jelly recipe from this site and a cherry-strawberry jam. I cant elaborate enough how AWESOME this Jalapeno jelly is on crackers with cream cheese-SO good!

Add me to the list!  This recipe is perfect. It isn't "hot", just sweet and yummy. If you want to save the step of spreading cream cheese on crackers, simply spread your jelly over a brick of softened cream cheese and leave a spreading knife for your guests. Alas, I do canning so infrequently I forget the steps - so big thanks for the notes by TERI MC from Jan 07.  Perfect!

The flavour of this is INCREDIBLE! It tastes a million times better than what I expected. I used 1/2 cup of green pepper, 1/2 cup red pepper, 1/4 cup of mild yellow cayennes, 1/4 cup of hot red chilli. So good. I had to use three 50g pkts of dry pectin. Also, I have a lot of beautiful cider vinegar bottles that I need to do something with, and I think I'll make a sweet chilli sauce from this mix because I'll use less pectin. It would taste fabulous as a sweet chilli sauce!!! Cheap to make as well....Thankyou so much...

I am so  excited!  I never made jelly before..and was very pestimistic on how the results would come out; especially because I didn't do any of the bathing or whatever y'all do with the jars...  I just followed the recipe as is...and it worked.  I have to say though, that I couldn't find liquid pectin so I just added the granulated powdered kind (a sml box) and it still turned out GREAT!!!

I had a ton mini red-hot chili peppers that I grew in my garden and had no idea what to do with them.... so I decided to do this!!!  I used red chili peppers and red bell peppers!  OMG!  Soooo good..  Can't wait to make more and save them for holiday gifts!!!!

WOW! If i could give this recipe 100 stars I would. This was first attempt at canning and I must this was very easy! I followed the recipe exactly, but due to the fact that I was giving these as a gift, I wanted to ensure a good seal, so I gave them a 5 minute hot water bath. It turned out perfect..every jar sealed, jelled perfectly, and it looks awesome! From one recipe I got 6 8oz jelly jars..I will surely be making this again. Thank's for giving confidence to a newbie canner!!!

I thought it was too vinegary. I was disapointed because I was really looking forward to giving these as gifts. Mine sealed just fine. I used my mother-in-law's trick which works every time (after filling jars place lids on snug and flip jars upside down, after they seal flip them upright again)

This is a fantastic recipe just the way it is.  I love the flavor and the cooking time is perfect.  I had to use the powdered pectin which worked great.  I also added red food coloring which made a beautiful pepper jelly for Christmas.  Thanks for sharing!

My garden went crazy with red chile peppers this year, so I tried this recipe with a green bell pepper instead of the red, and red chile peppers instead of the jalapenos.  The jelly still has the red and green flecks in it and it tastes wonderful!  I will add more chiles and less bell peppers in the next batch, though, because my husband and I do like more heat.

I just finished my 2nd batch of this jelly - EXCELLENT.  My first batch was a little "cloudy" red but delicious.  For my 2nd batch, I drained the red pepper juice off first (was only a little)  before putting in kettle.  This batch is not only delicious but absolutely beautiful.  I plan on giving this in lots of stockings this Christmas.  Thank you Holly for a great recipe!

WOW!!  This is fantastic.  I've used many recipes from AllRecipes, but I have never felt the need to "rate/review". But this recipe is that kinda good. When you make it don't change anything...it's perfect!

I would give this 10 stars if I could!!  This is hands down the best pepper jelly I have had.  I made this for holiday gifts for my neighbors, and it makes for a really pretty gift presentation if you tie red and green ribbon around the jar lid.  Love it!!

This is my first time to actually write a review. It was so good and am excited to give as gifts. After reading the reviews, I used 2 red peppers, 5 jalapeños, leaving the seeds in 2. (I’m not that adventurous with spicy and it was perfect for us.) Diced in processor and let drain in colander. When I added the liquid pectin, I put back on heat, stirring constantly. I used a thermometer til it hit 220 degrees. (The second batch, I broke it so had to eyeball it.) I read the canning process and had jars simmering in water until ready to go. When done, I put back in water for 10 minutes. I heard the lids pop after about 15 min sitting on counter. I did not need to flip, peppers stayed distributed.

Don't know what I did wrong, but it didn't gel.  Followed the recipe exactly. Disappointed, but will use as a glaze for meatballs and pork chops.

Taste great and excellent Christmas gift. I used suggestions and brought temp to 220 degrees before the liquid pectin and then after the pectin. Since I like it hotter, my next batch to keep for myself will have 1/2 red bell pepper and a full cup of jalapenos plus some seeds. Im glad I found this recipe its a keeper.

Mine tasted good, but the texture was quite sticky....
It maybe because I am at such a high altitude.  Not bad though.  We replaced the cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving & ate ours with turkey breast.  Very tasty!  Once it was heated, the texture softened, it was fine.

First time canning... Loved this!  It made perfect Christmas gifts for my neighbors and friends.  Cut back on the pectin if you want a less firm jelly.

I just finished 5 batches perfectly, beautiful color with red and green specks throughout and every jar set up. The recipe makes 5 8oz jars with a little to pour into a bowl. I did this so I could see that it set up properly then just covered and placed in the fridge for myself.

Here's what I did differently. I followed the ingredients pretty much exactly except that I used 3/4 cup of Jalapeno instead of 1/2 cup and left half the seeds and placenta in so I would have more heat. I used a 2 cup Kitchenaid chopper to mince the peppers. I brought the mixture to a rolling boil while still stirring for 1 minute following the directions on the pectin sheet for pepper relish (pretty close to pepper jelly). Removed from heat and added ONE packet of liquid pectin (also per Ball pectin direction sheet included in the box of 2 packets) returned to a full rolling boil for exactly one minute...set a timer. I then removed from heat and poured into sterilized jars and did a water bath for 5 mins. I did 5 batches, 25 8oz jars all sealed, beautiful amber color (did not add food coloring but you can) and ready to enjoy. I did turn them to evenly distribute the flecks.

This is the best ever!  I did not change anything. I am running out of the 12 jars I made.  I use it on almost everything. Tastes amazing on pork, chicken and even beef.  Don't let it just go on crackers and cream cheese ( or Brie, or Goat Cheese)  Huge hit!  Will definitely be making this MANY time and keeping in my book !

Made this several times and it's always a hit, even with people who don't like spicy food! There is just enough heat, it's not overkill. I've substituted the red peppers with green peppers or cubanelle peppers, whatever we have extra of from the garden. The finished product is always as beautiful as it is tasty. There have been times where the jelly sets with the peppers suspended perfectly, and times I've needed to invert several times every half hour to make sure they are dispersed evenly. I can't quite figure out why it does that, but it's an easy fix. For extra kick, add an extra jalapeno, or leave in all the jalapeno seeds and ribs. Oh, and use gloves when chopping the jalapenos. Just in case you rub your eye later in the day and haven't quite gotten all of the oil off of your hands after washing. Ouch!

Wow followed the recipe to the letter as I always do when canning. I loved it took it to a Christmas party served with cream cheese and crackers and people praised it. I did however wish it said what size jar I bought the smaller jelly jars so it made 12 jars.

Love this recipe. Looks very colorful poured over cream cheese block.  I do the same recipe with half of the apple cider and cut out 1 cup of sugar. Added blackberries (2 cups) and it turned out great. I also only used 3 oz of pectin so it wasn't too thick.

This is the best Jalapeño jelly I've ever tasted and I've had many  (Mine is dark in color and not clear like the photo). I had to make another batch because everyone went crazy over it.  They ate it with cream cheese on Ritz crackers.  I personally can't eat crackers, bread or chips, but I still get my fix by smearing it all over my roasted chicken or slices of turkey.  My dad loves it on a peanut butter/Jalapeño jelly sandwich!  Any way you eat it, it's great!!!

This is a great recipe!  I have made it several times.  I used the hint about tying up some of the seeds and ribs from the hot peppers in a spice bag.  This adds a little more heat.  You can also tinker with the hot pepper varieties.  Adding some Serrano peppers added a nice bit of extra heat.  Delicious on hot biscuits!

I remember the first time I tried this jelly (six years ago in middle school) and I was skeptical at first but my teacher talked me into trying it and from then on I was hooked. I've actually been searching for this recipe and am so glad to have found it. THANKS!!!

This jelly had a nice flavor.  A little tangy and sweet.  I added extra cerrano and manzano chili for some spice and to my dismay it was very mild.  No kick at all, not what I was looking for.  On a plus side, it was very pretty and tasty poured over cream cheese served with crackers.

Very good.  Mine didn't set quite as firmly as I would have liked, but the peppers stayed suspended- no turning required.  The color was also very deep so I didn't bother with the food coloring.  My husband and I ate some last night with cream cheese and crackers and it was tasty- a little too sweet and not enough hot, but I think I can tweak it next time.

Can't say enough good things about this recipe. I am the newest of newbie canners and I followed the instructions from a previous review. I have only one additional tip for people handling jalapenos. When you are getting out the seeds and veins from the jalapeno be sure to use gloves (or I use ziploc baggies if I don't have gloves). I then cut the japs in half and peel out the stuff with my fingernails...much easier this way, but if you don't have gloves on you may have hot stuff infused in your hands for 2 days.

I made this last year and was so proud of myself--homemade jelly! It was super easy, very pretty, and mighty tasty, too. I used two jalepenos, two habeneros, and two cherry peppers. I scooped out the skins and seeds, and ground them up in the food processor but used only half the mixture. As a result, it wasn't hot enough this year (last year it was perfect!). I'm glad I read the advice about watching the vinegar too--i set the burner on medium high until it boiled and then I turned it down to medium. Thanks for this great recipe!

This is a great recipe for pepper jelly. I would have preferred a bit more heat, but that is very dependant upon the peppers used. I took the advice of other reviewers and added about 1/2 tsp red food coloring...it looks very pretty in the jars. I made six 1/2 pint jelly jars. Great for gifts around the holidays.

I think next time..and that will be very soon..I'm going to add more peppers to the mix, cause I did'nt think it was hot enough. I too, did the turn trick..and what a beautiful result! I give this a 5! Very easy and oh so yummy.

This was my very first time make jelly. My hubby was pepper crazy this year when we planted our garden. Anyway, had a TON of different kinds of peppers and have been searching for new things to make. This was a real winner! I did it exactly as the recipe said except added the jar turning advice. It seemed so easy and quick. The jelly is very pretty and it tastes great. The consistency is perfect. Believe it or not, I've been eating it on my toast in the morning! I'm looking forward to trying more jelly making. This is a great one for first timers!! Thanks!

This was the first jelly recipe I ever tried.  Extremely easy to do!  I even tried it with splenda.  It made 3 jars instead of 8 and was much hotter. I have requests for this jelly all the time now!!!!  It was excellent!!!

This recipe sounded like it had a lot of promise based on the reviews but I found it to be much too sweet! (even for jelly) I probably would have liked it more if I had left more of the seeds in because it wasn't spicy enough for my taste.

This is really easy to make but was not spicy enough and really vinegary. Next time I will increase jalapenos and decrease vinegar.

I made this as Christmas gifts and hadn't tried it until we had company over for dinner. So my company turned out to be the "taste testers" and we all loved it! I suggested trying it on crackers with cream cheese and they just wanted it on the crackers by itself. I will definately be making this again!

This was my first experience in jelly making. It set well and was great. Although the vinegar smell and taste is overwhelming. I might try white vinegar next time.

Yummy.  I was totally not expecting that flavor.  Actually I didn't know what to expect.  I serve this with cream cheese and tortillas instead of crackers.  I had my whole batch accounted for the same day I made this.  It went really fast.  Thanks for a great recipe to use up my jalapenos I grew in the garden as well as my sweet peppers.

I made a batch of this to give as gifts at Christmas, and it was a huge hit!  I ended up making a second batch and giving out the recipe to several people.  This tastes just like the gourmet jalapeno pepper jelly they sell at specialty shops.

Good jelly -- not spicey enough for us, but I think if you add a habanero, you'd be set.  Not sure on set time, never worked w/ liquid pectin before, but hoping it will set quickly.  Does taste just like I remember it though!

This recipe was very easy to make and took very little time.  I was wary of making it since I had never done any canning before but it was simple - I did put the filled jars in a pot of boiling water for 5 minutes at the end though.  I ended up buying 12 125ml Bernardin jars which are the perfect gift-giving size and it doubles the amount you can distribute.  The jelly looked really good in the jar and tasted just like any other pepper jelly I've had before - it wasn't that hot (more sweet) so for all of you who like a bit of a bite just increase the jalapeno peppers and reduce the red pepper.  Overall a fantastic recipe - will be making again very soon.

Rating on taste: 5 
Instructions get: 2  for lacking critical parts
Great finished product but... the instructions are lacking. It is 2 3oz packets of liquid pectin. After which it needs to be placed back on the heat and boil for 1 min. Otherwise it will probably not set. Luckily I read a number of the reviews that mentioned these steps were left out. Great tasting hot jelly though when done correctly!

I made this yesterday. This recipe is excellent and so easy to make. I don't mind the heat so I left most of the seeds from the jalapeno peppers in. The peppers dispersed evenly in the jelly and set up quickly. My friends and I enjoyed some last night on crackers. Yummy. I will definitely be making this again but may try leaving all the seeds or taking another reviewer's suggestion of adding crushed red pepper flakes.

I was so excited to make something different and fun (and delicious) with all the jalapeño and Fresno peppers from my garden! Thanks to all the reviews that helped me do things right - my first batch turned out perfect! I scraped the pot with a spatula and ate it - didn’t want to waste any!! I only used 1 bell pepper from my garden (it was yellow) and then all the rest (over a cup) were jalapeño and Fresno peppers. Thank you to 1cookieangel for your suggestion about using the tea ball for the veins & seeds - it worked so well - it really has a great zing to it! Also thank you to oyerb for your suggestion to use the candy thermometer and boil to 220 after adding the Certo - it set up perfectly! This turned out great, it was pretty easy and it’s going to be so fun to give as Christmas gifts!! Yay!

Deeelicious!!! I've made this before, but couldn't find my recipe last year. This sweet and hot  jelly is the perfect compliment to the cool creaminess of the cream cheese - yum!! (Technically, the cracker is the merely the vehicle to get this delightful treat into your mouth ;) )

I've failed making pepper jelly before when it didn't jell, but this recipe turned out wonderfully for me.  It's also very pretty looking, and I like that you don't add any artificial food coloring.  I turned the jars upside down and right side up every 30 minutes for 2 hours and the peppers were evenly distributed throughout the jelly.  Do NOT do it longer than that though because the jelly will have start to set.

Great for the holidays.  Everyone loves this served with cream cheese.  
I wrap a brick of cream cheese in a crescent roll, bake and then put the pepper jelly over top.  Serve with crackers.  Nothing left over.

Great but I added an additional cup of sugar. That worked better for me.

I doubled the batch which made 26 four ounce jars for Christmas gifts. 
The proportions I used were 3 medium sized red peppers, 4 jalapenos, 4 pouches of liquid pectin, 10 cups sugar, and 3 cups apple cider vinegar.
I seeded the red peppers but only cut off the stem of the jalapeno and the heat was good for us.
I changed the method slightly as I can a lot and have never taken the pot off the heat prior to adding the pectin.
I brought the pot to a boil, added the pectin, boiled for 3 minutes, turned off the heat and skimmed the foam from the pot. 
I filled the hot jars and placed the snap lids on, I processed them for 5 minutes in a hot water bath, all my jars sealed and set even though I doubled the recipe.
I used my largest stock pot which was perfect.
Do not add onions or garlic, it throws off the acidity of the recipe which can lead to botulism, with canning you need to follow the ingredients to make sure you have the corect ph to kill any bacteria.

Wow! Awesome recipe! My 1st time to make jelly and I read all the "most helpful" reviews before I attempted it. It was awesome! Easy!! I did not use enough  jalapeno seeds, so it was not hot at all, but it is still delicious! I plan on making more tomorrow and I will add more seeds to give it a little more heat. Several mentioned that it was too "vinegary", and it smells very much like vinegar when it's cooking and when the jar is opened the 1st time, but don't let that dissuade you! The flavor doesn't taste like vinegar! It was easy and I'm excited to have this recipe in my collection. Love it!

This turned out great. Easy to make quick and will be nice little additions to Christmas. (I like the red and green pepper mix.) It jelled up quickly and easily. I did water bath the jars for five minutes because are used half pints which cool rather quickly and I was concerned about the seal.

A little thin, but I live at high altitude.  I would try it again and instead of just timing it, I would use a thermometer and boil until it reaches jelly stage.  It looks so beautiful.  Can't wait to taste it.

I made it according to the recipe and it was too sweet for our Texas preference for hot pepper flavors.  If you like a sweet jelly jelly, this is it.  You definitely need the cream cheese to offset the sweetness.  

I made it a second time, with a Texas twist, and was very pleased and gave as Christmas gifts to my neighbors and family.  The cooking method was followed exactly.  Ingredient changes  were:  
1.  1 whole red pepper (didn't measure after chopping)
2.   5 medium/large jalapeños with the veins (and gathered the seeds up and used them too) and didn't measure after chopping.  
3.  1 cup white vinegar and 1/2 cup of apple cider to total the same as original
4.  1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper (which also provided a very faint coloring instead of the clear)
5.  1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes

I love it. I used 1 average red pepper (1 c) and 2 big jalapeno (1/2 c). I left half of the seeds in jalapeno. I followed the advice of Teri MC and processed in hot water bath and boiled the filled jars for 5 minutes. I also flipped the jars every 30 minutes for about 2 hours. I have hunted for a good pepper jelly for a long time, and this one is perfect; not too hot but with a little zing and lots of flavor.

Wow!   Got the recipe from our daughter in law when I mentioned about all the peppers in our garden last summer.  Made it as directed now several times and it has come out great every time.  All family members love it.  Folks at work have insisted I accept money in return for more.   Just got through making several batches for the holidays.

I made several batches, of this recipe, for christmas gifts, last year. I wanted more heat, so I used jalapeños for all the peppers ( I had red and green jalapenos.) I washed the jalapenos, carefully sliced off the tops, and chopped them in my mini chopper. Very yummy with cream cheese and crackers.

Absolutely delicious. I have made 3 batches. Each batch yielded twelve 125ml jars, and about 1/4 cup extra that went into the fridge for immediate use. I made a couple of changes. I added half a small red onion to the food processor when chopping the peppers. I used 7-8 jalapenos and 3 long sweet red peppers for each batch. Perfect heat. For the first 2 batches I used applecider vinegar, but ran out and sub'd white wine vinegar for the 3rd batch. Didn't make much difference in flavor.

1. drain the chopped peppers over a couple paper towels in a colander after processing to get rid of excess liquid,  and 2. add more ribs and seeds for a little more heat. .this jelly tastes FANTASTIC. thanks for sharing :))

I made two batches.  Both came out totally awesome!  Used 1/2 cider and 1/2 white vinegar.  Used a mix of peppers, about 1/3 hot to 2/3 sweet.  Chopped them very very fine, by hand.  Made one batch with Ball liquid pectin, the other with Certo.  I believe I preferred the Certo ... the fruit did not float, and the jelly is more clear and sparkling.  Water bathed for 5 minutes.  Yielded 6 half-pints each batch.  Will give half away for Christmas gifts, the rest for me and hubby.  Seriously yummy!

For me it was very vinegary. I used apple cider vinegar and must have made a mistake with the sugar because it never set. I poured it back in a pot, cooked it again with 3 extra cups sugar and 2 pouches liquid pectin and it has set really good now but still tastes too tart for me. Will try another recipe next time.

This recipe is wonderful. I get rave reviews and it is easy to change the heat.  I use about a cup of red pepper chopped in a food processor, if the juice separates,  I don't add it but I also don't use paper towels to get the liquid out.  I use about 5 large jalapeños, with the seeds of 2 of them.  Comes out wonderful. I use 1 and a half packages of liquid pectin per batch, and have done a double batch this way with success.  I also put the jars in a hot water bath for 5 minutes because I was having problems with the jars sealing properly. If doing a double batch,  I extend the cooling time after removing from heat to about 10 minutes, not sure if that makes a difference or not.

Wow ! Just became my favorite jelly for gift giving ! I made 2 batches. The first batch I followed exactly and it turned out beautiful. The second batch I wanted to have more of a kick so I actually left some of the seeds in (couldn't find my cheesecloth or teaball).It turned out with the kick I wanted and, truly, the seeds don't take away from it. Thanks for sharing

Delicious! But it didn't work for me the first time. I followed directions exactly but jelly didn't set. Put jelly back in the pot and boiled another 5 min, made sure temp rose above 220 degrees, added more certo pectin, and poured into re-sterilized jars. Second time was a charm, I have nice firm set jelly that tastes amazing.

We made a batch last night, it smells like vinager this morning.  Not sure what to think... If the vinager odor does not go away (dont think it will) we shall start over.

I decided to make this as close to the original recipe for my first go around with the only exception of adding veins and seeds. (in a tea ball so I could remove it.)  I'm not sure why others had trouble setting as mine was stiff as could be.  Like a really hard jello from the hospital. The peppers were perfectly dispersed without any need to flip jars upside down. It was also very sweet and didn't taste like peppers at all.  I decided to try again using half as much pectin and sub the bell pepper for jalepenos. It was still too stiff for my taste but the spiciness was there.

Yummy!  I substituted one Jalokia pepper ('cause that's what I grew)  seeded for all the jalapenos.  Just right heat/ sweetness balance.

Excellent recipe, I would sggest to squeeze some of the juice out of the peppers. I had a problem with it gelling sometimes and this helped.

I have never made jelly before, and this was sooo easy.  It turned out a little orange, so before putting it in jars I added some red food coloring.  And, next time I think I will add more jalapenos.  This time I even left seeds in, but I could stand a little more heat.  But, everyone has loved it and asked for the recipe.

Never made jelly before but this wasn't very difficult at all and the results are fabulous.  Chopping the peppers up super fine was a little labor intensive but well worth it in the end.  I yielded 7- 250ml jars and used the flip trick...all of my jars sealed and look FANTABULOUS!  Can't wait to taste it tomorrow!  I will be making another batch so I have lots to give away this holiday season=)

I really enjoyed making this recipe with a friend and the end result is delicious!!  I like things a little hotter so I added more jalapenos to my second batch.  Does anyone know how to stop the mixture from boiling over and almost starting a fire?

This is a great recipe.  I made a double batch and it isnt setting up very well though.  Is that the problem because I doubled it or did I do something else wrong?
