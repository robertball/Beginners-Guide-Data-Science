Excellent starter recipe!  I used chicken thighs instead of breasts for a heartier poultry to match the robustness of the sausage.  I also allowed the liquid to reduce by half to create a chili-like dish.  Canned beans can be used to speed up the recipe but don't skimp on simmering time to allow the sage and bay leaves to do their jobs.

This was really tasty over rice, as the author suggested.

I found that the addition of a little hot sauce was just
the perfect touch.  This one is definitely a favorite around my house!

It is a great recipe for a rainy day. The taste is great. We also added 1 tsp. salt and 2 tsp. granulated garlic which enhanced the flavor.

Overall very good. I did add salt and increased the spices. Topped with lime fresca (lime zest and sour cream).

this is a very easy recipe but lacks flavor and spice. 

I used canned black beans to save time with soaking overnight.

This was an okay recipe.  I ended up adding alot of spices because I found it bland.  I think I'll hang with my old recipe for black bean soup.

I used canned black beans and Andouille sausage  as that's what I had on hand. It's pretty good made as written but I threw in a good pinch of Adobo seasoning and also some fresh cilantro for extra flavor. Next time I'll add a fresh jalapeno or two. Thanks, Judi!

This is a great recipe. Tweak it to your family particular taste and you won’t be sorry! I cook it in the crock pot and add cayenne powder, smoked paprika, can of green chilies, and kielbasa instead of sausage. Blend a couple cups of the beans and liquid if it’s not thick enough.

Good recipe! I sauteed the onion and fresh garlic with some carrots first, then added a carton of beef stock and 4 cups of water instead. Used 2 cans of beans (or one can of beans and one can of lentils) and added some baby bow tie pasta. Also added the tomato paste at the same time as everything else and just let it boil for about 20 mins. You could even use canned diced potatoes instead of pasta or rice and/or add some spinach for extra fiber and calcium. Great quick,healthy, hearty and easy meal especially in the fall/winter!

This is such a great recipe! It was a HUGE hit with my dad and brothers. I did not do both sausage and chicken, just chicken, and it was fabulous! Will definitely make this again:)

This was fairly bland on it's own- I added chili powder, garlic, onion powder, and cayenne and it turned out fairly decent.
