This was so nice to be able to make in the bread macine! This is a great base recipe and is going to be a really great crust to use for calzones with different fillings (the sky is the limit with this crust) and for pizza (it would make a great pizza crust). I added a tsp of garlic powder and a tsp of italian seasonings to the dry ingredients before putting in the machine. I used what I had on hand for the filling this time - canadian bacon which I cut up and browned a bit, Easy Pizza Sauce III from this site (terrific!), and part-skim mozarella.  I also brushed a bit of olive oil on before baking and then 10 minutes before I took it out I brushed a little melted butter on and sprinkled with grated parm for a nice finish. The dough was a bit sticky to get out of the machine but with floured hands and a little patience it came out and I absolutely did not need to add any more flour - didn't want it to get tough!! (just keep those hands floured and it'll be fine). I do think I'll let the dough rest a bit before rolling/pressing it out next time - it was pretty elastic and it took some time to get it pushed and stretched to the shape I needed. The braiding is going to take some practice but it still looked cool even with some of my stray strands here and there. Thanks for the recipe Kevin - my bread machine is going to see the light of day a lot more now! :)

Delicious, and surprisingly easy.  The braiding is a little tricky, as the directions are somewhat vague.  Basically, after heaping the mixture in a line down the center, use a sharp knife to cut downward diagonally angled "flaps".    Like this:                                   (right side) ////////                                    (middle) -----                                (left side) \\\\\\\\                          Then overlap each side, and tuck in the ends.   At least that is how I went about it and it turned out nicely.  I subbed 1 tablespoon of actual milk for the powdered; didn't throw off the recipe, despite the extra liquid.  I also added another teaspoon of sugar.

This was wonderful and so easy to make. I rolled out the dough on a piece of wax paper then added the filling and wrapped the dough. It was then easy to lift the calzone into the pan. When it was cooked, the wax paper peeled off easily for a super-easy clean up. I added green pepper, onion and pepperoni to the filling. Just delicious!

Wanted to try this as a possibilty for hubby's flytying get-together. This has amazing presentation with the braiding going on.The dough part has great texture and taste, gets crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on inside. I was a little disappointed in the filling (not enough and not much variety) But that can be geared toward your own personal taste. I made a ricotta/mozzarella mixture with a little homemade pizza sauce,then added pepperoni, onion, black olive slices and some mushroom slices. Used remainder of pizza sauce for pouring over the individual servings. Great recipe and beeauutiful product Kevin. My dh assures me that his buds will love this.Thanks.

This is super easy -- but looks impressive.  I always experiment with the fillings and haven't been disappointed yet!  Use extra cheese.  After brushing the top with melted butter, sprinkle with parmesean cheese and oregano for a "professional" finish.

Excellent!  I added a pinch of Italian seasoning and about 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese to the dough.  This dough rolls out very nice on a floured board.  Thanks for a great recipe!  You can teach an old dog new tricks!

I made this tonight.  I only used the calzone dough and it reminded me of the calzones I used to eat in NY.  It was great.  I also made individual calzones, and I let the dough rest when it came out of the bread machine and then let it rise for about 15-20 minutes after the calzones were done.  Since everyone wanted their own filling, I "glued" a piece of the filling (pepperoni, broccoli, etc.) to the outside so everyone would know what was inside each one.

WOW!  I just got a bread maker and tried out this recipe and was shocked at how delicious my first calzone attempt came out.  I carmelized onions and then grilled them along with mushrooms, tomatoes, chicken, spaghetti sauce and brown sugar.  I tossed all of that into the dough with some mozarella cheese and it was delicious!  The dough came out perfectly crisp on the outside and soft in the inside.  Even tasted better the next day!!!  Thanks Kevin!

Excellent! We dressed up with a bit of herbs in the dough. We also simplified the wrap by dividing into 5 balls of dough, rolled out, filled, folded over and cut slits. Turned out great.

These calzones were excellent. My husband said it is the best thing I have ever made(and I cook a lot).  The dough tasted exactly like Pizza Hut's pan pizza.  I do not have a bread machine so after proofing the yeast(mixing the yeast w/sugar and warm water for 10 minutes), I added the other ingredients and kneaded it for about 6-8 minutes.  After that, I let the dough rise in a covered bowl in my oven on the lowest setting.  Rolling the dough out was a breeze and the recipe is really quite simple with delicious results. Highly recommend.

Dough was very elastic when taken out of the bread machine. FYI, some nice person advised me that it should rest for a few minutes before using. Also, recipe did not say to let rise after forming the calzone, but I made individual ones and the ones I did first (that had some time to rise) weren't as tough, so I would allow for some rising time also. Although pretty good, the filling was pretty basic. And leaked out anywhere I did not seal perfectly. Now that I know a little more about making these, I WILL try again, allowing extra time for the above and being much fussier about sealing the dough.

Very easy and excellent - even better the day after. I would suggest making sure the pizza sauce and Italian Sausage you are using are good quality.

10 STARS! I have made this too many times to count over the past year.  I use milk in place of the water and powdered milk, and add garlic powder and oregano to the dough. Terrific recipe for customizing with your favorite meat and veggies inside. We like this served with a zesty Italian sauce on the side and no pizza sauce inside.  For a double batch, I like to make a cheese filling with 15 oz ricotta cheese, 16 oz shredded mozzarella cheese, 1 egg, black pepper and oregano.  Over top of this, we layer: sauteed onions, garlic, peppers, mushrooms, diced tomatoes, rosemary, oregano, and cooked meat or pineapple and ham. The braiding makes a beautiful calzone and is easy to do. About five minutes before it is done baking, I brush it very lightly with butter and a touch of Parmesan cheese. If you make a double batch, make sure you help the bread machine get started with the mixing as it is a lot of flour, but it works in my Hitachi bread maker. Better than what you can get in a restaurant! Thank you Kevin K.!

Made this for the first time to satisfy finicky 1st trimester craving.  Added Italian seasoning and parmesan to the ingredients ( came out like Ciabatta type texture)  My bread machine took a hour and half to prepare the dough, so it was about 2 hrs to make.  I tipped the dough into a olive oiled bowl and with a few minutes rest rolled out nicely.  Modified jar spagetti sauce and tossed in Costco meatballs, onions and bell peppers.  I made individual pies, and this made 4 good sized ones.  Came out pale, so will use egg instead of butter to brown.  Next time will have more sauce and cheese and seal it better. Keeper.

I liked this. I only followed the recipe for the bread. It came out of the oven crunchy outside, soft inside, and I was pretty happy with it. The whole criss-crossing thing didn't work very well though. I was a little confused by the directions. Mine ended up looking like some sort of deformed canoe! Tasty yes, but not very attractive. :)  

Since all of the calzones I've ever had served the sauce on the side for dipping, I did that instead of putting some inside. I stuffed my calzone with spinach, ricotta, fresh mushrooms, diced ham, and mozzarella cheese. All in all it was pretty good and I will probably make this again. I just won't do the criss cross thing next time. I think just folding it over and crimping it will suffice. Thanks!

This bread recipe was perfect. We all loved the taste and texture. To avoid having to seal the edges strecth the ends of the dough over the top and bottom, then just crisscross the cut edges starting from the top and working down. The edges will be tucked inside the bread making it seemless and so purdy. Will have this again for sure!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was a hit with everyone, and if it's not good they'll let me know!
the only thing I added was pizza sauce, shredded mozarella cheese and pepperonis., then roll up the sides because I couldn't do the braiding thing, and then brush the top and sides with olive oil, sprinke on basil, parmesan cheese and salt.
Everything was very flavorful, and I'll make it again! Thanks for sharing.

I made this TODAY, and it was a hit!  I used all-purpose flour (in Canada you can instead of bread flour because our flour is higher quality - my info source, my bread machine cookbook), as I do with all my breads, and it was GREAT!  Not a bread you'd eat alone, but as a wrapping, perfect.  What a good simple recipe.  The dough is elasticy, but not like a pizza dough.  It is easier to work with.  It was a bit sticky, so I just patted the outside with flour, and then it was totally easy to handle.  I made it with the Italian sausage but added bell pepper, and some onion.  You can tell, with the way it turns out, you could really put anything inside this that belongs on a pizza.  Or even a white cream chicken sauce with some spinnach ... you probably could put apples, with sugar, and raisins inside, and sprinkle the top with sugar.  Great possiblities.  My husband wanted me to suggest spliting the dough in 2 or 3 so that you could cut each one in half when done, and just hold it to eat (he got an end piece, holding it like a sandwich, and felt "sorry" for the rest of us.  lol  What a nut!).  My daughter was even able to help a bit with "painting" the bread with the melted butter, which is good cause she gotta help with EVERYTHING nowadays (she's almost 3).  lol  The bread is VERY filling.  The whole family is stuffed, with leftovers for my hubby for work!  WOW!  Thanks so much!

This came out, I'm sure, exactly as it should have. But I didn't make the criss-cross loaf thing. I made 4 fold-over circles. This dough was sticky to work with so add a little flour on your work surface. Also beware, the dough is frustratingly stretchy while trying to shape the sheet or circles. It insists on shrinking back into its former size. It baked up well but I need to tinker with perfecting my oven timing and temperature. I never made Calzones before. Quite a production. Don't even think about making this at the last minute. There is quite a lot of preperation what with the dough and the fillings and the assembly and all. I did make mine ahead in the day and laid them out on a tray, covered with plastic wrap and stored them in the fridge until baking time. They were good but I may stick to homemade pizza. That's enough work as it is.

We use this all the time and love it!  A trick my friend showed me is to save a little dough and have each person make their initial to put on top. Brush it with a little butter so it will stick. Then, everyone can tell their's apart.

In the end, this was delicious.  The crust ended
up being just how I like it - crispy on the
outside and fluffy inside.  However, when the
dough first came out of the bread machine, it was
way too gooey to work with.  I had to add lots
more flour to get it to the right consistency.
Next time I will use 4 cups of flour instead of 3.
I also brushed a lightly beaten egg over the
calzone instead of melted butter.  I can't wait
to make this again!

Used Exquisite Pizza Sauce from AR.com. Used 2/3 cup wheat flour because ran out of white. Cut dough into four and made rounds, filled, folded in half. Brushed w/EVOO, garlic powder and salt. Baked only 30 min. Sprinkled w/Parmesan 5 min before finished cooking. Let sit after filling if time and dough will keep rising.

I did not use a bread machine for this recipe.  Here is what I did.... I added the yeast and sugar to very warm water to my Kitchen Aid mixer bowl and l let the mixture sit for 10 minutes (until bubbly).  Then, I added the flour, salt and milk.  I mixed in the mixer for 5 minutes with the dough hook. Then, I  covered the bowl and let it sit in a warm spot for 1 hour, punched the dough down, rolled out on a cornmeal covered pan, filled and baked.  AWESOME!!!  I doubled the recipe, filled 1 with ham and cheese and the other calzone with sauteed onion, garlic, spinach and feta cheese.  The dough was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  I will definitely be making these again.  Super easy, too!!
Thank you, Kevin K. for sharing this recipe.

I made this recipe last night.  I added mushrooms.  The ingredients did not spill out onto my cookie sheet which was great.  I would have increased the sauce, calzone was a little dry. Making just one made it seem to bready.  When I make it again, and I will, I will make two smaller one instead.  Very good, very easy

We just made this tonight! Huge success. Ive never made bread before, even in a bread machine so I was nervous!  It was wonderful and the whole family got in on making the calzones.  We did change the insides to our own personal pizza tastes but oh man were they good!

This recipe is fantastic! I have to add about an extra half cup of flour to the dough mix, but otherwise it is perfect! I cook some breakfast sausage, get some mushrooms and some sweet peppers and mozz., cheese in it and it is So delicious! Thank you for the recipe! :)

This was really good!  I used a recipe that came with my bread machine for the dough but it's essentially the same as the one written here but without the powdered milk.  I also added grated parmesan and italian seasonings to the mix.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!  My whole family loved it!

Not only was this excellent, it was loved by my entire family.  I made one with pepperoni and a mozzarella/provolone mixture that all the kids fought over for the seconds.  For the adults (who are all trying to eat a little healthier these days) I used ham, green and red pepper, onion, and Swiss cheese.  We absolutely loved it.  One changed I made was to give the calzone an egg white wash instead of butter which work perfectly without added fat.  Thanks for the great recipe

Very good - I liked this recipe better than the other calzone recipe I tried.  Like others, I used milk in place of water and powdered milk.  I think this is what helped produce such a nice soft dough/crust.  I only used the recipe for the dough, adding garlic powder and oregano for added flavor.  I did have to bake mine slightly longer than stated, and still was able to avoid a tough/hard crust.  Great recipe; thank you for sharing!

This recipe was great. I made the dough in my bread maker and added a little basil, oregano, and a sun dried tomato/Parmesan dry mixture. For the inside I used homemade tomato sauce, mozzarella, sauteed broccoli/red/green peppers/garlic. I topped the calzones with butter and parmesean before I threw it in the oven. It was AMAZING. The outside breading was so good I could have eaten it plain as breadsticks. The only thing that was a little hard was dealing with the dough because it was very sticky. It was worth it and I will definitely be making this recipe often.

Fantabulous!!!  I made individual sized calzones and the family couldn't wait for the second batch to come out of the oven.  I added some Ital. seasoning and some Parmesan cheese to the dough but that was the only change I made.  I will be making this again real soon.

This is very good I did not want to spend 12 dollars on powdered milk, so used 1 teaspoon milk,  THis dough is the best I have had. Thanks
I also used pepperoni instead of sausage.  Will make again and all the kids loved  :)

The bread came out great. In fact, better overnight when reheated in the toaster oven. I didn't have powdered milk and put in a tablespooon of butter instead. Definitely add some garlic powder to the sausage when cooking. It is also good to add some herbs on top and brush it with olive oil as others have recommended. Lastly, the filling is not quite enough. I think I will use a cup next time.

What a great recipe!  I prepared the dough as directed, but boy did I load up on the fillings.  I added cooked shredded sandwich steaks, sliced mushrooms, sliced sweet peppers, and sliced onions.  My husband said I can make this for him once a week!

This Calzone was awsome. I think it would be better if it was several individiual calzones instead of one giant one. Mine was as big as the state of Texas. I put in some bell peppers too. Those were a nice addition. I think it would also be good with ham and pineapple.

Serve with pasta?  This was huge, and plenty of food on its own.  I added ricotta cheese to the mix (probably should have mixed that with an egg first) to make it more like a pizzeria calzone.  Great.

An excellent recipe, is certainly breadier than pizza, but when I served it for the first time, almost everybody went for seconds. 
You don't need a bread machine either, just put everything in a mixer equipped with a dough hook.

This recipe was great.  I made it was the easy pizza sauce and a homeade meatball recipe that I have.  It was so easy,(because of the bread machine).  My husband loved it.  Definitely a keeper.

I also took my bread machine out of retirement for this recipe, and it was well worth the effort!  I was worried I wouldn't be able to braid the dough and keep the filling inside, but I followed the directions and it was SO simple.  I loved this recipe and will make it again soon.  We used extra pizza sauce for dipping.

This calzone was awesome! My family devoured it - as well as our neighbors whom we shared with.  It's definitely a keeper!  

The only (personal preference) changes/additions I made:  added some dry herbs to the flour, brushed a buttery egg coating on the crust towards the end. Lastly, grated some parmesan on the crust for the last minute in the oven - yum!

We used authentic Italian sausage and pepperoni from an Italian market and it adds to the over all flavor.

Wonderful! We made each half with different filling and both were tasty.
I have yet to use the powdered milk as I haven't had it on hand when I made this.

This was  a good recipe; I didn't have powdered milk so I used 1 cup milk in place of it and the rest water. I added garlic, onion, and Italian seasonings to the dough to add flavor. I did my own filling of breakfast sausage, bacon, pepperoni and salami with various cheeses and my pizza sauce. Was good, and I'll make again, but the dough was too wet, so I had to work with amounts of flour a bit. I had scaled for 8 servings, and had to add about 10 tbs flour, and ended up with 6 large calzones from it.

I used this recipe pretty much to make calzone dough in the bread machine, and I like the taste/flavor of the dough. The fillings change each time we make them. Very good for the dough!

OK...Let's start!! Easy!! The bread machine does all the real work...It even proofed it. I used milk instead of water because I did not have powder milk on hand. I also added teaspoon extra sugar, and a teaspoon extra yeast. I like mine with a little more yeasty sweet flavor. Also I would put this in a 350 degree oven and after 15 minutes turn it down to about 300 to 325 degrees depending on your oven, that is if you like a less dark crust. Plus I used spinach, cheeses,sausage, pepperoni, peppers, onions and drained olives, so needed the extra cooking time,  for the inside to cook and the outside not be over cooked, I just turned the oven down. this recipe would make great Breadsticks...just add some herbs and garlic and onion to the mixing bowl...Very Tasty and Thanks for submitting it!!

I can really only speak for the dough and cook time, because that's all I use this recipe for. When I make calzones, I cut the dough into four equal sections and fill them with cheese, veggies, and meat (but never sauce, that gets served on the side), and then cook as directed.  So easy and customizable for everyone in the house!

This recipe was so good and so easy! I modified a bit since I did not have bread flour or powdered milk. I used all purpose flour and a tsp of skim milk in place of those items. I had to double this recipe, so I ended making the other loaf with my stand mixer with the dough hook and it worked just as well :)  We also added a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese to the top of the crust ..

This made a great calzone or pizza bread.  I added basil, minced garlic, and oregeno for a more flavorful crust.  Its a great basic crust and there is really a lot you can do with it. I think I will add sun dried tomatoes in addition to herbs as well.

Very easy!  I just rolled it out to a 10"x16" rectangle, put the filling inside, and sealed it up.  I made half of it vegetarian (ricotta, red and green bell peppers, onions, sliced black olives, mushrooms and mozzarella) and the other half with pepperoni.  I chose to dip the calzone in marinara instead of adding to it.  I may put the sauce in next time.    I think the dough would make a nice loaf of bread too.

I made this tonight and everyone loved it.  Used the easy pizza sauce III recipe from this site and some ground mild italian sausage.  Added a little more cheese inside, brushed the outside with egg beaters and sprinkled on some parmesan and italian seasoning.  Will definitely make it again!

This was a great recipe! I substituted Canadian bacon for the sausage to reduce the fat content and it was delicious. One thing that the recipe doesn't mention is the time it takes to make the dough. Our machine takes 2 hours to make the dough so we ended up putting the dough in the refrigerator and making the calzones the next evening. We'll make this again and again! Thanks for the recipe.

I made mini calzones for 6 little girls at my daughters 7 year old birthday party.  I asked each girl what filling they wanted i.e. cheese, pepperoni, black olive, mushroom....all 6 girls inhaled their calzone and said it was the best.  I have since then made the dough into "cheese" sticks like we get at our italian restaurant - the family likes this bread better.  Excellent!

This always turns out perfect.  I have found that by scaling the recipe to 6 servings the amount fits in my bread machine and I end up with 2 very large calzone which is enough to serve my family.  For the filling I used a mixture of ground beef and ground italian sausage.  I cooked the meat and added 2 cloves of garlic.  I also added some parmesan with the mozzarella.  The flavor of the bread is wonderful.  It is easy to put together once the dough is ready.  It is good with a variety of different fillings.

Made this last night for dinner. The dough when it came out of my machine was extremely sticky. I bet I almost added an extra cup of flour. I'm going to make this again today to see if it was just user error. That being said this was DELICIOUS!!! I made four individual calzones with pepperoni, sausage and onion along with "exquisite pizza sauce" from this site and everybody just kept saying this is SO good. Will definitely make again and again and again. Saved some of the pizza sauce for dipping and it was great.

Very easy and has a wonderful texture. No hassles with using the bread machine. I added some garlic and herbs to the dough as I was mixing it to add some more flavor.

These were great. Made two big calzones filled with pepperoni, sauce, cheese, and spinach that was sauteed with garlic. Yum

This was really good. It was so easy to pop it in the bread machine.  I used the "exquisite pizza sauce" recipe found on this very website for the innerds of the calzone.

This is awesome!  But I did change the ingredients inside.  I used alfredo sauce, cooked, sliced ham, cooked and cubed chicken and mozza cheese.  YUMMY!!  This calzone bread machine dough is exactly what I was looking for!

This is a great recipe!  I read some of the other reviews and I agree it is better to add more than recommended on the fillings.  I used pepperoni, sausage, black olives, and green peppers and it was great.  This is a keeper!

Wonderful recipe when you have no time to cook!
We changed this by making individual pies and made some ricotta stuffing to go with it.  Take ricotta and season to taste with sugar, salt, dried basil, dried oregano, dried thyme, 2 hard boiled eggs riced, and the liquid from sauting crimini mushrooms.  We added dried basil, dried organo, dried thyme, rosemary, black & white pepper, granulated garlic, granulated onion, and pecorino romano cheese.  Let's the kids be creative on what they would like to stuff them with.   Add a Lindemann Shiraz for the adults and extra sauce for the top and you are set.  Had to come back and re-evaluate our rating.  Changed it from a 4 top a 5.  Definitely a keeper and has been showing up in our household in various combinations.  Simply delicious!

A tasty and easy recipe. The strips were a lot of work that I don't think are necessary - it made it thin on the bottom and dough heavy on the top. Just fold over the dough and crimp the edges to create a pizza pocket. I will make this again and try different ways of working the dough.

Great basic recipe.   Made twice now.   First time I followed directions exactly.  My only problem was transferring the calzone to the baking sheet after I had rolled and stuffed it.  Grandkids loved it.  

The second time I made it, followed directions for dough and then split it in half and rolled out two rectangles.  Also rolled out on parchment paper and then just picked up the calzone parchment paper and all and put on baking sheet.  

By making two, I was able to change up the filling.   This is a big hit with all my family.

Great recipe that can be used as a base to include your fave toppings or innards. Works great at high elevation with a few tweaks. Decrease yeast by just a smidge. Increase water by a very small amount. I usually just don't measure the ingredients for a full cup or tsp and pour a tbs extra of water.

This has become a staple dish in our house! We've used all different kinds of fillings: ricotta (a must for us!), meatballs, pepperoni, fresh spinach & feta, mushrooms...anything works and it's perfect every time.  The only changes I've made is that I swap the powdered milk (simply because I don't keep that in my pantry) for regular milk and decrease the water by the same amount.

Loved this recipe for the ease and the variance of a pizza type meal. The bread seemed to overtake the filling flavor. Will try again but  make two smaller/thinner calzones. Anxious to try Alfredo sauce with shrimp, crab,cheese, and onion.

Delicious. I used 1/2 lb pork sausage, 1/2 lb beef, and pepperoni. I cooked the meats, then tossed them and the cheese with some Italian dressing/marinade. I did not worry about braiding, just folded it all up into one calzone. Brushed with some butter. SO GOOD! Did not use any sauce on the inside of this, but served with ranch and marinara for dipping.

Excellent! The bread was superb! Slightly sweet, light and tender with a nice crunchy crust. I did not use the powdered milk instead I just substituted the water with milk as suggested by other reviewers. For the filling I also added sauteed yellow peppers and onions. I made the exquisite pizza sauce from this site and served it on the side rather than putting it in the calzone.  I've made calzones and stromboli several times before and this one was definitely the best! I will look not further, but will continue to use this recipe. The braiding also worked better than the traditional rolling.

I originally made this recipe (sans sausage, used pepperoni slices) a few years ago but forgot to review it.  The dough is easy to work with and shapes up beautifully.  I just made the dough only again for bread bowls (for dip and for soup).  Wonderfully easy.  (Of note, I used 1 T. LESS water and the dough was still sticky but workable.  I also used 1 T. bread machine yeast for the bread bowls but 2 t. bread machine yeast for the calzone.  I do not brush the dough with melted butter.)

The dough was great. I don't know what I did different but it made 2 huge calzones. I filled mine with ricotta, mozzarella and ham. So good. Next time I will add some seasoning to the ricotta.

being a professional baker, I do not own a bread machine. I do however own a Kitchen Aid Mixer. I made 1 1/2 times the recipes as some other reader's have done and I mixed it on the mixer. I allowed the dough to rise until double, about an hour.  This dough was so yummy, we all made pigs out of our selves! It made delicious Calzones and we where each able to make our own, with our favorite fillings. I loved mine with Spinach, Mushrooms, Onions, ham and Mozzarella cheese. My husband suggested that next time, I leave some dough unused, and fry dough balls as some Italian restaurants do, and make zepoles for dessert. (small fried pizza dough balls, rolled in powdered sugar after frying)

We loved this!  All four of my children ate their dinner and then we argued over who would take the leftovers for the next days lunch.  I am about to make another one to put in the freezer, for a day when I am in a pinch, to save me from having to splurge and pay for delivery pizza. Thanks for this recipe.

My family absolutely loves this dish, we make it into individual calzones and add whatever toppings that one wants, the kids love to help make dinner!  The only down side it I cant seem to get the dough thin enough, it always seems too thick and tough, if anyone has any tips, let me know please!  Other than that this is a great recipe!

2 Thumbs UP! Made this exactly as recipe stated (except used meatballs instead of sausage). I can see this becoming a "staple" in our house. Especially when I have a houseful of growing kids and all their friends.  So many possibilities and options - a great recipe to "tweek".  Easy way to use up leftovers!  Thanks

My whole family loved this. It was easy and absolutely delicious. I added italian seasoning and garlic powder to the dough and used ground beef as my filling (that was all I had). I mixed oregano with the ground beef, and sprinkled oregano over the toppings once I had added them to the calzone. I also sprinkled garlic powder over the melted butter after sealing the calzone. Delicious!!

This one is a winner. Great crust, and you can fill it with whatever appeals to you. I may never make pizza again; this is easier and IMHO equally tasty.

We added chicken apple sausage, mushrooms, and olives. It tasted pretty good. We didn't use the receipe for the bread, just the calzone. We used a bread recipe from our bread machine book.

Had this for dinner last night and the family really enjoyed it.  I have made something similar with a slightly different crust recipe but we unanimously agreed that this crust was lighter and tastier than my other one.  I did add garlic powder, basil and oregano to the dry ingredients and sprinkled parmesan on the top of the loaf as it baked.  This recipe was good for 2 adults and 2 hungry children.  Looking forward to trying other stuffings.

I'm giving this 5 stars because it has so much potential. And I'm putting it on my All time favorite list. I used a pkg of Quick rise yeast and used my Kitchen aid mixer and let the dough rise for 30 to 45 minutes. I sprinkled the top with garlic salt over butter. It would be better with other stuff and maybe with cheese on top.

I have been making these for a couple of years and have never submitted a review till now.  We love these.  The dough is great.  The reviewer who was having problems with the dough should have let it just sit a couple of minutes.  Sometimes you just can't rush things along.  Especially bread dough.

Awesome bread!  We change what we put inside each time but the recipe for the bread is unbeatable.  I recommend always brushing the top with butter or egg otherwise your calzones won't brown properly.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this for my entire family and everyone loved it.  The kids are finicky, so I told them it was inside out pizza and that went over great!  I used ground Jimmy Dean sausage and pepperoni (a stick cut & chopped is less expensive).  I also made the bread machine recipe and the pizza crust from a tube.  My husband said the bread machine was better but it would be fine to use the pizza crust and avoid "all that work".  (I didn't fill him in on how easy it was.)  I did make one seemingly important addition -I sprinkled seasoning on the bread before baking, I used a parmesan blend, tasty!

This is a great recipe! We made two, one as suggested in the braid and one that looked like a traditional calzone pocket.  Add whatever you like as filling, serve with pizza or marinara sauce on the side.  Crust was so tastey, chewy but not heavy -- although my crust never got golden brown, stayed pretty pale even though it was done.

This is the first thing I made with my bread machine & the family loved it! I added a little pepperoni to it as well. It is a nice change from pizza and if you have the time, this is definitely worth it.

I made this without a bread machine, but it still came out delicious. Actually, a male friend of mine (with no experience kneading or cooking anything) made this with me, and even with his tomfoolerly, it tastes authentic. It's a very versatile recipe. I recommend it.

This was yummy!  Everyone gobbled it up, and it was a hit with the kids.  My store was out of pizza sauce, so I used spaghetti sauce instead (Prego) and the flavor was still really nice.  I added 1 clove of crushed garlic to the bread machine for a little more flavor, and will definately do so again when I make it next.  It really only added a hint of garlic to the bread, but it was tasty.

You definitely want to add a little more flour than the recipe calls for. We made individual Calzones and they all turned out great! The kids had fun making their own. Just make sure not to overcook. We added some green peppers, onion, mushrooms, italian sausage, pepperoni, and my husband even added jalapenos. You can put in what ever you want. Next time I'm trying chicken and broccoli.

This was aboslutely wonderful.  My husband and kids love when I make this for them.  I just roll the crust out into a big rectangle, cut in half then fill one side with all out goodies, then fold the other side over.  Doing it this way I make 2 big calzones, and everyone gets what they like inside.  Yummmmmmy

We all enjoyed this very much.  My dough was a little sticky, so I was generous with the flour when I rolled it out, and it came out great.  I made four individual calzones instead of one big one.  Also, I used my own filling and topped with sauce at the table.  We were all very pleased, even the picky 5 yr old.  Thanks!

This is fantastic, simple Calzone recipe!  Works well with any of your favorite fillings (spinach too!). I so thrilled that I can have the same Calzone that I love without driving a couple hours to a place that makes them this good.  Besides, I was only able to do that a few times a year now I can have my Calzone anytime!

Mmmmm!  I am going to definitely make this crowd-pleaser again!  Simple and delicious!  Next time I would try a ham and pineapple filling or a barbecue/chicken filling.  If you want to impress your guests, this is the recipe!  Fed four adults perfectly.

This is by far the easiest and best receipe ever!  My husband couldn't believe the size of it when he saw it in the oven.  I used canned pizza sauce, pepperoni and mushrooms in ours and it was delicious.  I've emailed this recipe to all my friends!

I have to say that I didn't enjoy this at all; however, it was probably my fault for altering the recipe.  I made four individual calzones instead of the one long braided one and the crust was VERY tough. I shall keep on looking for that perfect calzone dough!!

I have to tell you that this recipe makes a very tough dough. I personally did not like it. It was very chewy. I split the dough into 4 rectangles to make personal calzones. I have done this before using the Pillsbury Frenchbread in a tube and it makes for an easy and very tasteful calzone. Just unroll and roll out to a decent size rectangle. Cut into 4's and add your choice of toppings and bake at 400 degrees for 12-15min. Top w/ your favorite pizza sauce and there you have a very simple calzone. This dough was just too tough to work w/.

I decided that it was about time I try and make homemade calzones, so when I found this recipe, I was excited to try it out.  The dough was great, very soft and tasty.  I added a bit of garlic to the mix for flavor, which was great.  I had a hard time folding the strips though.  I think this recipe needs an illustration!  Or maybe I need to be more artistic, oh well.  The 2nd time I tried this recipe, I just rolled the calzone in a circle, then folded it, then crimped the edge.  The result was a lot better looking.

I made this recipe using the suggested filling and it was great! The next time I made it used a more "adult" filling . Instead of what this recipe calls for I used tomato sauce, proscuito, goat's cheese, black olive slices and finely diced anchovies.  It was a huge success !!

The bread on this calzone turns out wonderfully.  Especially great when you brush the top with 
egg before baking it.  It then comes out golden brown.

This turned out quite good, however be sure you are ready to feed a tribe of people. When it was all said and done I came out with one 14 inch and two 8 inch Calzones. Also, you need to be sure to roll these very thin otherwise they will be too bread heavy. Additionally, bump up the temp to 400 - most calzones are hit with very high temperatures to achieve proper crusting. Finally, be sure to have plenty of flour on hand for the rollout - the dough was very sticky and needed more flour. The only reason I’m not giving this 5 stars is due to the portion size and that traditionally sauce is served on the side, not within the calzone itself as it would make the bread soggy. Overall, great recipe and will definitely be making it again - good for a dinner party where everyone gets to make their own 6 inch, etc.

My wife braided this like a boss!  I know I messed up something since I was the man with the roller...  dough on top got to be too thick :( .  We have only eaten the ends (a lot of bread because of how we made ours) and one slice from the "middle" area.  I put the kitchen sink in my side, fresh mushrooms, deli sliced sandwich pepperoni, bacon crumbles, crumbled beef (all pre cooked meats), canadian bacon cut in quarters and black olives.  We added sliced mozzarella and sliced Monterrey Jack cheese.  We used Bertolli spaghetti sauce. 

Things we are going to try next time
1. more stuff - more cheese and more layers of meat.  (her side with pepperoni was only maybe 1 1/2 pieces of pepperoni per slice when all was said and done and it is too much bread for the meager amount of pep and cheese we put in.)   We will layer meat, cheese maybe 4 times over next time.
2. more sauce - not a lot more... I really appreciate Kevin giving us a starting quantity but I think maybe being in contact with the dough pulled some sauce out.  It was a good amount when we started but after baking, it seemed to have gone in to the ether.  I think next time, base of sandwich pepperoni and then a layer of cheese and then sauce should work well for our tastes.
3. Bread a bit less bready.  Everything worked out great but the bread we use for our pepperoni rolls may be better as it seems to not bake up as thick.
4. Egg wash is pretty awesome on here - we use one egg with one tablespoon water mixed and brus

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I am staying with a friend who had a bread machine and used theirs, though I think it would turn out okay with some hands work too.  The dough turned out great!  I used hot Italian sausage and it was a perfect sweet/spicy.  The only thing I could have done was use a better pizza sauce. (I didn't have any tomato paste to make my own and didn't end up having time to pick up some pizza sauce.  I improvised and the sauce I made turned out a bit too salty, but everyone liked it and I will be looking forward to making this again!

I made it and added tons of pepperoni, mushrooms, sausage and lots of cheese. It was awesome.

This a great base recipe that can be utilized to make whatever you want. I made one following the recipe, and then I made one using alfredo, baby spinach, mushrooms, onions, black olives, mozz, and some Italian sausage. I egg washed for color and also brushed the outside with garlic butter and parm to finish. I had some left over dough that made some decent breadsticks.  The dough was a bit wet, so I'll probably back off of the water a bit next time.  I will probably also stick to using a stand mixer for better control of the dough. But, not bad.

This is a great recipe for making with a kid helper.  We filled with just a little sauce, lots of mozzarella cheese and pepperoni... Leaving the rest of the sauce for dipping.

This was very good and very easy. However, I found that 1 1/4 cups of water was too much for the 3 cups of flour. I made it a second time today with only 1 cup and 3 Tbs of water and the dough looks much better in the machine. Flour moisture content can vary so I would suggest starting with a lower amount of water and checking the dough after s few minutes of kneading.

This makes a great and easy dinner.  I make it frequently and usually just put cheese and olives inside (and red onions in part for myself).  I think it's more of a Stromboli than a calzone though.  I brush the top with butter and sprinkle garlic salt on top when it has about 5 mins left of baking.

When I took the dough out of the machine it was so sticky and impossible to roll.  I must of added at least another cup of flour to it.  The taste was good.

The dough came out hard and chewy, but the inside was wonderful.  Maybe I just over rolled the dough.

This is easy and very attractive!  My family loves it!  I do add a bit more cheese. I also make sure I seal the ends to prevent any leakage of sauce. Also, as it bakes it rises so make sure it fits the pan you bake it on. MMA

My husband actually made this for us and it turned out GREAT.  He followed the recipe exactly, just adding a few more seasonings. We agree with a few other reviewers, though, it could use more fillings for the amount of dough.  But a five star recipe for SURE.  Thanks!

These are the best calzones.  Everyone who has been lucky enough to try them has loved them.  I have made them with leftover holiday ham.

I used my bread machine to make the dough while at work and when I got home all I had to do was roll it, fill it, and bake it.  It was that easy.  My family thought this was delicious.  I made the one long rectangle calzone and braided the top.  My son suggested I make little individual pockets next time.  I thought this was a good idea because then I could add green peppers and onions to mine.

this tasted very good, but my bread machine took 2 hours to make the dough.
I also would have been better off not to bother doing the "braiding" thing and
 just folding it over; it was hard to do.
My family was starving by the time it was ready, and asked why we didn't just 
order out.

The only time I have made calzone's was using the frozen bread dough.  They were well liked, but difficult to roll out.  These were terrific and easy to make.  They also make a great pizza dough. The only problem is, I have to make three to feed my family and it takes 30 min. for each dough to process.

I made this recipe for supper last night and it's another winner. The dough was perfect and I didn't have to let it rest long to roll it out into a rectangle. It was picture perfect coming out of the oven and was as delicious as it looked. This is another winner. Thanks, Kevin, for sharing this wonderful recipe.
