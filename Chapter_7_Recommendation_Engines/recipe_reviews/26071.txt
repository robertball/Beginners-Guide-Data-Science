Yummy! I baked the burritos in the oven using a fat-free cooking spray and they tasted better than any deep-fried chimichanga we've ever had!

I couldn't find Ortega burrito seasoning mix, so I used another brand.  I found it too salty.  The recipe is very easy to make, so I may try it again if I can find the Ortega brand seasoning. (Or better yet, come up with my own seasoning.)

Overall very good.  I'll definitely make this again, but will use less of the packet of mexican seasoning. (A bit salty).

These were fine but nothing to write home about.  I suspect we're just not big fans of the burrito so our opinion is slanted.

These were really good burritos. I used lean turkey meat instead and I accidentally used taco seasoning instead of burrito seasoning, but they came out beautifully. I have started a newer healthier lifestyle and I have lost 21 pounds since the end of February and I have eaten these all throughout the past two months so they are also really healthy! Don't let the good taste fool you!

This is a really yummy recipe.  We have "meatless" nights sometimes, and I like to make these without the chicken by simply adding the spice packet and water to the beans while they're heating.  Delicious and vegetarian, too.  :)

This was fast and easy to make.  Make sure to use a name brand seasoning packet, it makes a big difference!!  I also fried the burrito and that was really tasty--but fattening!!

I made this last night, and we loved it.  I added sour cream and salsa on top.

An easy and delicious dish.  When the bean and chicken mixture was ready, I stuffed the burrito tortillas, poured enchilada sauce on top along with cheese, and then baked them for about 10 minutes.  A Mexican meal of restaurant quality!
