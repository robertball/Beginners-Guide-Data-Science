This turned out perfectly. The only change I made was to exclude the Worcestershire and mustard powder (my kids can detect even small traces of these) and increase the flour to tablespoons instead of teaspoons.

The taste was above average but  a second serving was definitely not happening. I'm positive the reason my rating is low is because of the processed cheese. Yes, it was gooey and the texture was AMAZING, but because of all the processed cheese, my body didn't want to digest any more. Also, when I went to fetch some more the next morning, it was almost frozen even though it was in the fridge and not the freezer. The ingredients tense up when put under cold. It heated up fine -- however, some butter separated from the rest of the ingredients. I recommend eating it all in one night (which I don't think is possible unless you have a lot of people because of your body rejecting the processed cheese).

Couldn't ask for a better mac and cheese recipe.  Delicious!  I made it for my Grandson who was coming for a visit but I couldn't help sampling it myself :)   I used 3 slices of American cheese,  cheddar and some Gruyere because that is what I had.   I will always use that combo as it was perfect in my opinion.

Very good. I added 1 tsp of cayenne for a little kick. I also changed to tsps of flour to tablespoons. That seemed to thicken it up nicely.

Made it almost exactly as the recipe stated but doubled it since I was making it for a large crowd.  I made it the night before, refrigerated it and then baked it for a few minutes to heat it up the next day.  I did add some panko breadcrumbs on top since I knew I'd be baking it the next day.  Turned out well...nice and creamy.  The next time I might add a bit of cream to it before baking to keep it more moist.

Love it!  Halved the recipe and it worked just fine. Used Cotija cheese in place of Parmesan and cheddar and Mexican blend shred instead of processed cheese (it’s what I had on hand). Great flavor combo. Only used the teaspoon of flour, and it worked fine. Keeping this one!

Very good! We had some for lunch (it was a bit on the thinner side) and the rest I put into a casserole dish and reheated in the oven for dinner, which thickened it up nicely, so I would probably do that again. The family enjoyed loved this, so it's a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

As in cooking for my class, I brought this recipe to my high school and I made it for our class "Family Lunch" (basically a family lunch is a class with your whole class period). This was a really easy recipe but we were required hard recipes (I Lied and said it was a hard recipe for me to complete lol, I later told my teacher I was lying and made her favorite dish for her lunch and a sorry. hehe). My whole class and family enjoyed it and I definetly  would make it again. Since we got an extended lunch I got PLENTY of time to cook it!

Wow! Too much garlic!!! Too much half and half! I kept having to add cheese to thinken the sauce. Glad I don’t have to talk to anybody (except my hubby - poor thing) anytime soon with all the garlic. So glad I didn’t make this for company I had last weekend. So disappointed!

This was a winner. I doubled the recipe for a large crowd. The only change was two tablespoons of additional butter.  The adults as well as children liked it equally. I won’t discuss the calories.

Made exactly as written; was quite soupy and very strong garlic flavor.  We like garlic so not a big deal for us, but I could see that being an issue for some.  I have a solid baked macaroni and cheese recipe and have been looking for a good stand alone recipe (that doesn't need to be baked).  I think baking this recipe could help thicken it up maybe, but since that is not how it is written my rating reflects that.

Way too much garlic. I want my Mac and cheese to taste like cheese. This one is so full of garlic that it overwhelms the cheese. Maybe if the cheeses used were not so mild, it would be ok, but I would cut way back on the spice. It was also pretty runny. It got better once I let it sit and reheated it, but all in all, there are better Mac and cheese recipes out there.

This was so good! Every one at church wanted some homemade Mac and cheese and this was a hit.
Some people said they never eat it and raved at how good it was. I didn’t have all the ingredients so a quick run to the store took away time to bake it. I omitted the eggs and heated the cheeses and milk mix on the stove. If I had more time I would have sautéed some
Sausage and onion and browned some
Bacon on top for extra kick. It was so creamy yet it had good texture. This will definitely be my go to recipe for homemade Mac and cheese. Thanks for sharing!

Very good!  I just made a few changes as I didn't wanted to use so much half & half.  I used a half pint of heavy cream and used 2 cups of non-fat milk.  I also used 3 Tbls of flour and also used 1/2 block of pepper jack cheese instead of the parmesan.  Alittle cayanne pepper too.  My husband who normally is my biggest fan...was shocked on how good it was.

I'm all for natural, but nothing melts like velveeta.  I liked the way this recipe combined different types of cheeses to try and achieve great flavor with a smooth creamy texture.  For us the texture was a win, but flavor fell short.  I wished I had used an extra sharp cheddar to really push that flavor to the forefront along with some extra garlic.

I agonized over macaroni and cheese recipes for so long before finally choosing to make this one. I wanted something relatively easy, but with a little extra something, something to make as a side for ribs. This was perfect! I changed nothing, it was easy, it came out creamy and delicious. I ended up with a TON leftover, it’s so rich that you get pretty full from just a little bit (especially when you eat it with ribs haha)! So I brought the leftovers to work and now everyone thinks I’m a really good cook. Delicious!

This turned out very well. The cheese sauce tasted amazing. I wish the final product was a tad creamier. Next time I make this, I will slightly reduce the amount of noodles. Great recipe.
