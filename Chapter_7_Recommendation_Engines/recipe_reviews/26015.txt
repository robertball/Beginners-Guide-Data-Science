Delicious with a very nice texture.  One slight addition which perks up the flavor:  add 1/2 teaspoon mace (also known as pound cake spice).  This adds a little "oomph". :)

I'd like to give this 10 stars, it's that good.  I substituted almond extract for the vanilla, and used all butter instead of shortening and margarine.  It took an extra 15 minutes to cook but came out a beautiful golden color and the texture was unbelieveable. Thank you, Etta!

I am totally not a cook nor a baker.  I just never learned and never wanted to learn.  However, this past Thanksgiving my family commissioned me to make a dessert, and I found this one online.  Let me tell you, it's the BEST CAKE!  My family went crazy over it.  At first no one wanted to try it because I baked it and they didn't trust my skills, but after their first taste, that cake disappeared!  They even begged me to bake it again for Christmas.  If you're a coffee drinker, this cake dunks well in a cup of coffee...yummy!!!!

This is a good base recipe for a pound cake if you add some spices/zest/etc.,   I added some Mace as another reviewer mentioned and was VERY glad I did; this would be a very plain cake if you didn't add something to give the cake some "character".  Note, I also reduced the amount of sugar by 1/4 c. and may try to use even less the next time; the cake is not overly sweet but if you serve it with berries or a dessert sauce I don't think 3 cups of sugar is necessary.

Make it 5 star if you use butter.  Lovely taste and texture. I cook all my pound cakes from a cold oven, useful when you live in a tropical climate, the oven is'nt on so long
GREAT CAKE

This is a great recipe I took half a cup of sugar away and it is still very sweet but thats good because I have a sweet tooth.In this recipe you could put in beries,any zest or what ever you like! Instead of margrine and shorting you could se butter. I took cream chesee frosting and melted it in the microwave and drizzeld it on top. This is great will make again!

I made this for our Easter dessert yesterday. This is a nice simple recipe with simple ingredients that I had on hand. I did add a splash of lemon extract to give it a little more flavor. I made a simple cream cheese frosting and drizzled it over the top and sliced up some strawberries. It was loved by all :)

My goodness, what a treat!  This was super easy to make, it's delicious and very sweet.  The batter was creamy, came together very well and resembled liquid silk.  If that makes sense.  One of the prettiest & simplest desserts I have ever made.  Thanks Etta, I'm more than pleased with this recipe.  It's now my go-to recipe for a guaranteed tasty pound cake.

Hubby & I are really enjoying this cake.  It was quick and easy to prepare and so much better than a mix.  I did reduce the sugar to 2 1/2 cups and was glad I did.  We do not care for a too sweet anything dessert and it would have been too sweet for us with 3 cups.  Just a matter of personal preference.  Thanks for a keeper Etta.

Really great pound cake! I used 1 1/2 cups margarine, because I never have shortening on hand, don't know how shortening would make this cake any better...it's pretty perfect the way it was! It filled up my large bundt pan perfectly, and with about the last 2 or 3 cups of batter left, I added some cocoa powder(I didn't measure), and swirled it into the batter in the bundt pan, for a marble effect. Took this pound cake over the top! I served it strawberry shortcake style for dessert, had it the next morning toasted with some homemade strawberry jam. After snacking on it all week long, it kept nice and moist for the 2 of us about a week in an airtight cake carrier. With the few slices left starting to dry out, I made pound cake french toast with homemade strawberry syrup(it's strawberry season here! lol).  Thank you Etta for my new go-to recipe for pound cake!

This is a slimmed-down version of an old Southern pound cake I have been baking for decades. I got it back then from a retired-after-30-years HomeEc teacher, and passed it along to a 5-star New Orleans chef who serves it to this day.
Her changes are: a whole cup of Crisco, 3 1/2 cups of cake flour, 5 eggs, 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp of baking powder, and a tsp each of vanilla, lemon and almond extracts. Be sure to mix and sift the dry ingredients togetner before measuring the flour. She called this a "tender" recipe, so DO NOT over-mix. The added shortning and eggs will eliminate the dry condition some reviewers note, and the medley of flavorings stand out without being muddy and really add to the taste; no ganache needed.
I took this to a company pot-luck party once. It killed the snooty cafeteria manager to ask for the recipe, but ask he did!

Amazing! I can't believe how simple the ingredients were and how amaxing the cake turned out. I had to chose between this recipe and another pound cake recipe that took 5 eggs, I am glad i chose this one. The only thing i did different was cut the sugar down to 2 1/2 cups after reading the other suggestions, and i used 2 whole tsps of vanilla flavouring. Also i didn't have the correct pan for the recipe, so i used a bread loaf pan and a small glass dish.  Sooo good! and great in the morning with your cup of coffee. Definitely a keeper, thanks so much Etta for sharing!

This is the "grandma style" cake I have been searching for for years! For a yummy twist, bring 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. FRESH lemon juice to a boil in a saucepan and cook for 2 minutes. When your cake comes out of the oven, poke deep holes all over with a thin wooden skewer, then brush generously with the glaze. This tastes great and keeps the cake fresh! Works with orange juice, too, but only fresh-squeezed juices will do.

I made this for a friend and her family, and one of her little girls asked me to make it again for her.  I love the flavor of almond extract, so I used that instead of vanilla.  I need to make it again and bring for work anniversary.  It's perfect!

Sooo sweet! The texture was nice and mois but the flavor was not what I'm used to in a pound cake. I will make it again with a few tweaks, less sugar and maybe lemon zest along with more vanilla.

I've never been able to make a decent pound cake until this one.  It was WONDERFUL!!  I've made it twice but used lemon extract and zest in the second one.  The were both fantastic.  My husband took the lemon one to work and they scarfed it up immediately.

This recipe tastes good, although it doesn't taste like a pound cake to me.  However, I used the correct size pan and it bubbled over twice all over the bottom of the oven.  The pan was not big enough.

Superb, wonderful cake with a beautiful texture inside and out, just what I was looking for!  I did make a few changes after reading other posts:  butter for the margine, reduced the sugar to 2-1/2 c. using 2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar (I like brown sugar and may try it with all brown sugar next time just to see how it does), increased vanilla to 1 T., and added 1/2 t. salt.  In my oven it baked for 1 hour 40 minutes.  One commentor had rated it poorly as being "floury tasting."  I had baked the cake in the evening for use the next day and after it had cooled completely I had a sample slice and will admit I also thought it tasted floury.  However, a sample of it the next morning was completely different, the flavor excellent, so am guessing it just needs to "cure" overnight or for 12 hours or so, and would recommend making it the day or night before it is to be served.  This cake needs absolutely nothing else to complete it, just wonderful, and seems to improve with each passing day.  We did have it the first day with fresh mixed berries and whipped cream, a la strawberry shortcake, super good.  Otherwise it has been eaten slice by slice just as is with an involuntary "ummm" by all, and sure to be finished down to the last crumb, rare for our family of three.  Highly recommend!

4 stars as written, made it again,using 4 eggs, 1 tsp. salt and a tbs. of vanilla extract.  We really liked it with the changes. Since then I have made this with coconut extract, lemon extract. The possibilities are endless.

I made this to design a friend's birthday cake. I thought the batter tasted chalky while I was making it, but thought perhaps just me worrying about the cake.

Nope - the cake tasted terrible to me. People at the birthday said the cake was good, but my husband confided to me that if I hadn't slathered the cake in dark chocolate ganache, it was indeed dry and bland.

Not sure how I could improve the recipe, but I am never making this again. Sorry.

i gave this cake 2 stars and thats only because my dad and husband liked the mace flavoring. i didnt like this cake at all. I followed the instructions exactly and the cake batter was very thick. All i could taste was flour and spice. I dont think i will make this one again.

Extremely sweet.  I would love to lessen the sugar the next time I make it.

This was too simple to pass up.  ...Here's what I did.  Put 1 T of vinegar in the cup of milk and let it sit for a buttermilk effect.  Then scanted the sugar on each cup. Used 3/4 t of almond and 3/4 t of vanilla extracts.. and of course used butter.  On the glaze I used the juice of one lemon 2.5 cups of powdered sugar with 2T of milk with vanilla.  The first peice was divine and must go to Bible class tomorrow or I will gain 5 lbs!

This cake comes out perfect everytime.  However, I added a tablespoon of lemon extract to give the cake a lemony taste.  It takes like the pound cakes my grandmother used to make.  This is a great recipe!  I look forward to passing this one along to my daughter.

I cut down the sugar by 3/4 cup and the sweetness is just right for me. If you prefer it sweeter, add icing/ frosting.
This pound cake recipe creates a nice, dense texture.

This was wonderful, with a couple of changes.  I used all butter, left out 1/2 cup of sugar, and 1/4 of flour (but I think it would have been fine with the extra flour).  I also added caraway seeds, but thats a personal thing! It came out moist, dense but not heavy and flavorful, just the way pound cake should be. It tasted my my grandmother's lost recipe.  This is the best pound cake I have ever made.

This pound cake was FABULOUS! I'm not the most experianced cook in the house but it tastes delicious!!! My mother said it tasted like the pound cakes that her relatives from the south used to make when she was a child. My siblings commented that it was too dense and moist, but quite honestly, I have no problem with the consistancy! I will most definitly make this cake again!!!

I tried this recipe for a function at my Church. It was s hit! Love the way the top cooks up with a little crunch to it. This time I put almond flavor mixed with vanilla. Awesome! It deserves more than 5 stars!  Thanks

I tweaked the original recipe a bit to compliment what I had on hand, but it is absolutely to die for!  First, I used butter in place of margarine and shortening, and I also used evaporated milk and a half-teaspoon of nutmeg ( I didn't have Mace :( ) for some, as SKYEYES put it, "Oomph!" The texture is absolutely amazing. The top is a little crunchy ( which I really like ) and its moist, rich, and doesn't crumb. The flavor is absolutely perfect. Its like a slice of heaven in itself, and I can't wait to try it with some Banana Whipped Cream :))) Kudos!

I made this for a valentine party I went to. It was wonderful. The cake was moist and dense. Sweet but not too sweet. I made it like the recipe said but it would be good with just about any flavoring added. The cold oven start was a a new one for me too.  I did make one small change I added three drops red food coloring. It came out pink to boot!

Great basic pound cake recipe, but I like to use all butter and add 2 tablespoons of vanilla, butter, nut flavoring (I think McCormicks makes it.)  It's Fantastic!--never had a complaint.

Great as Lemon cake. I refuse to use shortening so I creamed 2 sticks butter with sugar then added 1/4c oil which keeps cake  moist. Zest of 1 lemon and juice of 1 lemon, which cuts the sweetness a lot. A few drops of lemon oil- really bumps up lemon flavor try if you have never used-and substituted sour cream for milk- a nice twang!

This came out really good... I added more vanilla than recommended (kinda free handed) but other than that I followed the recipe to the word... Im glad I didn't take the word of everyone who made adjustments, because this cake was amazing just the way it is! (I would recommend making it at least 12-24 hours before serving, just to give it time to settle pound cake usually taste better as days go on)

I use all butter in this and like to add a little mace.  But this is hand down my mom and son's favorite cake.  If made in a tube pan, it makes a gorgeous crunchy crust. My mother got this recipe at work many years ago and made it all through my childhood. I have a picky little Papillion pup who isn't a foodie at all, she doesn't even like most dog treats.  But when she smells this cake she always wants a bit of it.   I do find that I need to bake it about 10 minutes longer than the time in this recipe.

I absolutely love this pound cake! I have been searching for a great pound cake recipe for a very long time, the first time I made it, it came out perfect. I tried to readjust the sugar the second time and it was so great. The orginal recipe is great, minus the shortening. ( I didn't use it because I didn't have) and it still came out great.

I loved it!!!! It was very sweet, but I didn't mind that at all. The no preheating and low temperature keeps the cake from cooking too fast, so it comes out a beautiful even golden brown all over, and the texture is simply wonderful.  I did use butter instead of marjarine. Next time I will try adding melted chocolate to some of the batter and make a marble pound cake.

I have to say that my "Cold Oven Pound Cake" came out so well.I made this cake for Thanksgiving. I took the advice of other reviews and reduce the sugar to 2 1/2 cups and add 1/4 teaspoons of mace. The mace gave it so much flavor. My Fiance love it! I will be again, definitely!

This is a GREAT recipe for pound cake. it comes out perfect every time! I've made it like 10 times already and am always asked for the recipe! The only thing I did differently was baked at 325 degrees F for 90 minutes instead of 300. Great recipe!

This cake for me had a little too much sugar but it could have to do with the sauce I put on the top, otherwise this is a great pound cake. Excellent with coffee.

I made this for dessert tonight and it was really good.  I added a few tablespoons of natural peanut butter as a slight modification and that turned out great.  Good recipe.

I also used 1 1/2 cups butter and it was really good.  My husband said this pound cake tasted like his Grandmas recipe.
