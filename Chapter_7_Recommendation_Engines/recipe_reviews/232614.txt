My husband loved this pizza. It is very spicy though, the crust was delicious Great recipe and so easy to make. I used a recipe for a non rise dough though and it seemed to work really well.

I made this recipe tonight for my husband. He loved it and said it is a keeper!  We did not have honey for the crust so put the sesame seeds on top but will try the honey that next time. The sweet and spicy was a perfect combination and reminded us of the Jamaican Jerk Chicken pizza from California Pizza Kitchen.

We made it on the grill. And I had to make  the ginger plum sauce sauce from scratch...couldn't find any at the store. The whole family loved it!
