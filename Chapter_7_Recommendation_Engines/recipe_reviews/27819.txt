It's too bad somebody messed up their rating for this recipe because it's got a really terrific flavor. My only changes were to cut the recipe down to 2 servings but I still used a whole habanero (3x the listed amount) and I left in the seeds and veins. I used half the suggested amount of cilantro dried instead of fresh and broiled the chicken for 20 minutes instead of grilling. With the extra unseeded pepper this was extremely hot but still irresistable! Next time and there will be a next time I'll probably remove about half the pepper seeds and use a little less cinnamon and will definitely serve this with applesauce or something else to help cut the heat. If you aren't familiar with habaneros they're one of the hottest peppers you can get but they have a unique sweet taste that goes fantastic with chicken (and IMHO they freeze really well) so don't substitute if you can avoid it.

This recipe is AWESOME... When I found it I wanted to make it right away so I only marinated it for about 3 hrs with the chicken cut up in chunks for skewers on the grill... it tasted great with the grilled veggies. I also used jalapeno in it instead of habanero next time I will go with the habanero. My boyfriend raved about it he can't wait till we make it again. I made coconut black bean rice from this site to go with it and it paired really well.:0)

I started to prepare this and overlooked the "overnight" part. I didn't have time to marinade for even half the amount of time and it still came out great! To get a milder spicy result I subbed jalapeno for habanero and didn't allow too many seeds in the mix. Combo of ingredients is so unique in the end you should taste everything the cloves cinnamon brown sugar mmmmmmm can't wait to make again! Thanks Janis!

I've been in jamaica many times and pretty much found this recipe to be quite boring. I thought the habenero's would kick it up but not really. Will look for something with more taste and will toss this one.

I thought this was fantastic. I wasn't too sure of it by the smell when I was marinating it but once I put it on the grill it started smelling wonderful. My fiance ate FIVE pieces of it. The only change I made was using a jalepeno instead of a habenero. I didn't want the heat to take away from the flavor. Also make sure you marinate it for atleast 8 hours. Thanks for the recipe!

This marinade recipe is fantastic and so versatile! I decided to try it because I my boyfriend and I recently went to jamaica and he loved the jerk chicken. Although this is not as spicy made as it still excellent and you can make it spicy to taste. It is slightly a pain to make but has superb flavor that everyone raved about. I made a huge batch to keep some on hand so it is worth the hassle. It can even be used to make a quick and tasty pasta sauce with some added milk or cream. Thank you for the favorable recipe!

I thought I'd hate it since it called for cilantro but it was good and we had no leftovers which is high praise from my family. If you like cilantro than you'll love this. If you're not a fan the flavor is not overpowering. The spice combination did not overpower the meat so I wouldn't decrease the spices. And the brown sugar made a nice carmelized browning since the breasts I used were skinless. This would be good with turkey too. I found it made alot of marinade. I did up 6 breasts and I had lots leftover so I froze it. Hopefully it will keep well that way.

This takes a little effort to mix up in the food processer ( I hate to clean it) but it was well worth it. I had to use garlic powder ground ginger and jalapenos from a jar but it was yummy.I used fresh cilantro from the garden and it gave it a great flavor. I marinated it all day then grilled it and had leftovers the next day for a grilled chicken salad for lunch. I look forward to using this recipe again! Thank you so much.

Made this last night for my husband and company. I 1.5 the recipe and used about 12 breasts and there was plenty of marinade - I even saved some to brush on during cooking. I used 2 seeded jalepeno peppers instead of habanero becasue i was afraid it would be too hot. Turns out it could have been hotter. Next time I will use 4 jalepeno peppers. This was great and everyone raved - I will for sure make again.

This is my favorite chicken dish now. It has such a unique flavor but it is so tasty. I first found it when my daughter needed a recipe for a project on jamaica and figured oh what the heck we will try it! The one thing I substitute is the habanero I think they are a little to spicy so I use anahiem and they are REALLY good. I Make this all of the time now and I am addicted to it. My Family loves it too! Thank you so much for introducing this to me!

Fantastic flavor! I doubled the sauce and used it to make chicken wings for a Caribbean-themed party - they were awesome and got rave reviews! I did tweak the recipe slightly by adding lime juice and a bit of coconut milk. To make wings: Bake wings according to directions on bag then baste with sauce and bake 10-15 minutes longer on each side (baste again after turning over). Put them in a crock pot and add the leftover sauce. Keep warm.

My husband and I love this recipe; it really reminds us of Jamaica! You can add or not add anything and it'll still turn out great. I make a double recipe and use 1/2 to marinate the chicken and then cook the other 1/2 in a sauce pan on the grill to pour on top of the cooked chicken so it's extra saucy!

I am in love with this marinade in general. For my family's sake I omitted the habanero and substituted three seeded jalapenos. I seared the chicken over hot coals then cooked it indirectly on the grill. Boil your marinade and pack it on the meat while it's cooking the chicken is juicy and superbly flavored! This is definitely going into our regular rotation!

This recipe makes a ton of marinade. It was way too sweet for me. Only thing I left out was nutmeg because I did not have any. Threw out the leftovers. Will not make again.

This stuff is fantastic! Made it with chicken tenders on skewers. I put this together and took it with us camping last weekend. It was a big hit and I'm making it again this weekend.

The kids and hubby enjoyed this so it's a keeper. I didn't use pepper sugar or cilantro so it was not spicy but still was flavorful.

I was surprised at how little of this marinade actually permiated the chicken. It was acceptable but will have to be tweaked I think.

I didn't even make it to the eat part. I followed everything exactly and tried the marinade before I even put the chicken in it. It was um just gross. Definitely not for me which is weird because I love all the ingredients that go in it. Something is just off in this recipe. The balance of spiciness saltiness sourness and sweetness must be considered not only in each dish but also between the six or more dishes shared per sitting and this recipe fails miserably. For those who want to try this recipe I recommend reducing the spices. It overpowers the marinade. I am disappointed. Oh well.... not all recipes are for everyone.

This was good and something unusual. The habanero gives it just the right heat but it was a little oniony for my families taste. Maybe with a couple tweaks it would be something we would make again.

Cinnamon and nutmeg are a little overpowering I would recommend decreasing these spices.

I took a big risk with this recipe by making it for a party of over 30 people without testing it first and was made very nervous by the smell of the marinade (which before cooking isn't very pleasant) and the smoke when cooking it on the stovetop (it set off the fire alarm 3 times before I was done cooking and filled the house with smoke!) but ultimately it did not disappoint! Everyone loved it even one of my friends who is from the Virgin Islands. I adjusted the recipe for 25 servings and rather than using the 4 habanero peppers I just used one jalepeno pepper without seeds and it still came out great but not too spicy.
