I made this for the weekend and it came out very tasty. Mango and cilantro is a very good combination and the coconut milk gave the dish a creamy touch. I did leave all the sugar out, but added another mango.

I thought this was very tasty. Everyone liked it. I used quinoa instead of rice, and I only had some shredded chicken. I omitted the 1 cup of sugar, and instead used some sweet chili sauce and a dash of fish sauce. I blended the mango into the sauce.
 Really quick and easy to throw together. I would make this again and add more mango, some red/ orange bell pepper chunks and some red pepper flakes.

I'm giving it 4 stars because I made changes (in part based on other users' reviews), and think if I'd followed to recipe it'd have been too sweet/salty.   But I'd give it a 5 star as I made it, and am making again now just a few days later it was so good:
- Left out ALL sugar
- Left out the soy sauce
- Used chicken breasts marinated in the chile sauce 
- Added Thai red chili paste (both to the sauce and with water for cooking chicken)
- Added peas and diced potatoes

I used only 1/4 cup sugar. It would have been way too sweet with a whole cup. I did not have any mango so I left it out. Added about 1 tsp red pepper flakes. Delicious!!!

Very good.  Although I didn't have all the ingredients that they called for and had to make some changes.  I didn't have any mango.  So I used fresh pineapple with juice instead.  It was very good, next time I will try it with the mango.  I also didn't have cashews so I chopped up some pecans, also good.  Everything else was the same. I also used way less sugar, about 1/4 cup. I also found that the soy sauce was very strong.  I would probably use less and more water,  perhaps add a little sugar to it as well so it's not so sour.

Argh.. I didn't like this.  The chicken was too salty from the soy sauce.  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar.  The mango made it really really sweet.  I do not think the mango or the sugar is necessary.

Excellent template.  Very easy to follow.  This recipe is definitely true to its name "Sweet".  Maybe too sweet for some.  I cut back on the sugar by half and it could have been cut back even more.  We loved it!
