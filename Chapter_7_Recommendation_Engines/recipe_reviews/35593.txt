This recipe tasted OK.  Oddly enough, following the ingredients to a T there wasn't enough blueberry flavor, even with blueberrys and blueberry yogurt.

this was a wonderful recipie that he whole family loved. We used mixed berry yogurt instead of blueberry yogurt and our blueberries were dried. I found that I liked these more without topping of any kind than I did with topping. Although I enjoyed putting coolwhip on them. Even the fussy 3 year old managed a meal with us instead of at random snack times. I said it before I will say it again, this recipie is AMAZING!

These were very good. I used whole wheat flour and added some flax seed. My boys seemed to like these better than other blueberry waffles we've tried.

The batter was wonderful, but the blueberries stuck to my waffle iron, so they had to be peeled off. :(

Flavor was odd. Had to add a few things to make it better.

It was a pain to make and it had way to much flour. The dough was thick and the blueberries stuck to the waffle iron. I was very excited to make it and it disappointed me.

They were edible...but for some reason all I tasted was the egg?  I switched half of the flour for whole wheat flour and added 2 Tblsp of flaxseed meal(soaked in 2Tblsp of water) which should have added more flavor and even a tsp of cinnamon...I just can't figure it out...I did make the mistake of not thawing my blueberries...this made a mess in my iron...oops.
I think they just weren't my families cup of tea!
