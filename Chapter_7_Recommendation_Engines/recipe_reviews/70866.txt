I've looked awhile for a good raspberry
vinaigrette and this is delicious. It has so much flavor for only 3 ingredients. I use it on a spring mix salad with pecans, crumbled blue cheese,
slices of apple and dried cranberries.
It's heavenly and a keeper!!

Delicious!  I used sugar-free jam to cut the calorie count.  Great on baby spinach leaves with walnuts, low-fat feta cheese, mandarin orange slices, and dried cranberries.

Quick, easy and delicious! I love it when a few ingredients come together for something so tasty. It really doesn't get much simpler than this. It's perfect over mixed greens with feta cheese, dried cranberries and toasted walnuts - YUM!

Gorgeous dressing!  The seasoned rice vinegar adds just the right amount of interest!  I made 1/4 recipe, which I calculated to be:  1 Tbsp. olive oil, 1/4 cup vinegar, and about 3.5 Tbsp. jam.  It was divine served over a spinach salad with hard cooked egg, strawberries and blueberries!  I would have added some almonds too, if I had some.

I served this dressing with the salad Linda suggested, minus the bacon, and it was delicious.  The dressing is SO easy, and is better than anything store bought.  I made a salad for 2, so I cut the recipe to 1/4, and that worked perfectly.  Thanks Linda!

Raspberry Vinaigrette is much better if made with fresh raspberries: Just mix a handful of fresh raspberries with a couple of teaspoons of dijon mustard and a good dash of white wine vinegar. No need for oil or sugar. I did not fancy this recipe, too artifical and not at all tasting as a raspberry vinaigrette should.

This is by far the best Raspberry Vinaigrette dressing!  My husband, who hates this dressing, loved it.  I will never buy pre-made salad dressing again

I loved the fact that this recipe called for raspberry jam because it made it so easy to put together. Ten ounces of jam seemed like an awful lot to me and so did the one cup of vinegar so I played around with the amounts until it looked and tasted right. Used apple cider vinegar which worked out beautifully. Everyone at my party raved over this dressing. Thanks Linda!

My grocery store has been out of my favorite raspberry hazelnut vinaigrette for 1 month now, and I was going through withdrawls! So...I found this recipe after trying a more complex recipe involving oregano, dijon mustard, etc. and this hit the spot better than that! 5 Stars for simplicity, and great flavor! Thank you!

Yum!!! I just made this. I used seedless raspberry jam which made the blender not necessary. I just mixed by hand then put it in a container and shook it. It all blended together quickly and easily. I did use the raspberry vinegar which I think added to the raspberry flavor. I can't wait to put it on my spinach salad tonight. Thanks for the easy delicious recipe!

I followed this EXACTLY - no changes - and it was not to my liking.  I can't imagine what I could possibly have done wrong, but it was inedible.  In a pinch, I bought Kraft light raspberry viniagrette with poppy seeds and it was a million times better.

I kept to the amounts stated and tried them using sunflower oil and apple cider vinegar.  It was great.  I even tried other flavors of jam at different times for a little variety (strawberry, orange, apricot) and the recipe was versatile and delicious.  I like raspberry the best, though.  Thank you so much for this one!

This is very thick and sweet.  Next time I'll use a little less jam to thin it out and a stronger vinegar to balance out the sweetness and see if that helps.

I halved this recipe, using Smuckers Simply Fruit seedless raspberry jam.  I just whisked all the ingredients rather than using a blender and it worked fine. By itself, the dressing was rather tart, but on my salad greens with strawberries, mandarin oranges, and Feta, it was perfect.  A very little bit carried lots of flavor.

I gave this 4 stars because I altered it slightly. A great quick dressing for a salad containing fruit. I used 1/2 cup oil, regular rice vinegar, and used seeded raspberry jam. I didn't use the blender, instead whisked the ingredients together in a bowl and spooned it over mixed greens topped with fresh raspberries, blueberries, crumbled feta cheese and sliced almonds. Hubby's comment was Mmmmmmmmm! :o)

As others have stated, this is fabulous.  I've tried others that were okay, but this one will stop me from looking.  I have found the perfect raspberry dressing.  I am going to try it w/ blueberry jam also.

This is easy and it does taste good but way too much vinegar. Next time I will 1/2 the vinegar or add more raspberry jam. I also used jam with the seeds in because it's all I could find at the time. I ended up blending it all in a blender and then straining the seeds out. It's good but needs a bit more sweet to balance the strong vinegar flavor.

great!  i would recommend beginning with 1/2 cup of the rice vinegar, blending, and tasting. add more to taste.  1 cup made the dressing too tart for my taste and i had to add more water to balance it out.

This was very good, but I did cut back on the oil. I only used 2 tablespoons, as I don't care for my dressings to be swimming in oil, and I found the 2 tablespoons seemed like the right amount. Also, I didn't use olive oil, but rather a vegetable oil, which worked well. After serving this once, and having another cup of the dressing leftover, I took davebouy's suggestion and added 1-1/2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard, and sprinkled in a bit of black pepper. It did cut back on the tart "vinegary"taste of the seasoned rice vinegar, which I liked, but my husband said he much prefered the dressing without the Dijon mustard.  But he also said the Dijon tasted ok in it as well.  Even though this is a good tasting vinaigrette dressing, it's also a dressing I will probably only make once in a great while, as it is a bit rich in taste. Perhaps a mild tasting vinegar would be best to use, but that's just my opinion. Linda, thank you for posting this recipe, it definitely is a keeper!!

Excellent!  I made this for a family dinner and got rave reviews.  The salad was spinach, feta, candied pecans, dried cherries and green apple.  I used red wine vinegar. The dressing kept very well in the fridge. I made it again in reduced quantity (estimating the amounts) for a smaller dinner with the same wonderful results. So easy!

I cut the recipe in half as that made plenty. It was wAY to sweet. I added salt n pepper, and a tablespoon n a half of dijon, and got raves for the dressing. It went from 3 stars to 4.

This was sooo delish! I added more oil and jam because it was a bit vinegary at first, but then it turned out great.  I made it for Valentines day and served it with steak salad with feta

Made this twice. First time followed the recipe but used apple cider vinegar. Delicious! Stores well in the fridge. Second time added a bit of crushed dried oregano, garlic powder and onion power. Double delish! Great recipe.

I had to tweak this a bit because I thought there was WAY too much vinegar.  I added a bit of sugar and a bit of salt as well as more oil to even it out.  I used an all-fruit spread too.  I thought it was great and would try it with strawberry all-fruit too.

I thought this was fairly descent. My main complaint, is it was a bit sweet compared to other raspberry vinegrettes I have tried. I think most use raspberry vinegar. I made 4 servings with the adjust button, instead of 16, and did get 1/2 cup which was plenty. I used 4 Tblsp of raspberry preserves for that amount. I tried the serving suggestions and didn't care too much for that salad though.

Nice vinaigrette dressing.  I was looking to finish off a half jar of raspberry jam.  The taste is very good and DH loves it.  I think the texture is a little thick for a vinaigrette.  I might try adding a little more vinegar.  This added a lot of flavor to mixed greens with feta cheese.  I also used this dressing in 'Strawberry Broco-Flower Salad'.

This worked really great with a salad of greens, cheese, & sliced green apples. I am only giving it 4 stars because I ended up getting sick of it because of its strong flavor and threw about half of it away. Great for company, but the flavor, for me, just wouldn't work for a frequent option.

Tasted GREAT!  Didn't have seedless jam, so used the regular seeded raspberry and after mixed, strained it.  Sometimes chopped seeds will change the flavor, but this time it didn't seem to have an impact.

I didn't have seasoned rice vinegar so I used a combination of vinegars i had on hand - regular rice vinegar, lemon-fennel vinegar, apple cider vinegar, balsamic vinegar and the taste came out superb. i love that it is so easy to put together - i also used grapeseed oil.

Used this on "Spring Strawberry Salad with Chicken" and it was a hit with everyone.  The only drawback is this makes a lot of dressing.  Next time I will only make a 1/4 of the recipe.  I used a fruit spread rather than a jam to avoid the high fructose corn syrup and a lower sugar content.

Perfect substitute for raspberry vinegar.  I would recommend using sugar-free jam, or omitting some sugar from the recipe calling for the raspberry vinegar.

I really enjoyed the flavor of this dressing after I doctored it up a bit!  As other reviewers stated, it was a bit heavy on the vinegar taste.  To help balance the taste I started adding some spices (I didn't measure though):  dried basil, ground mustard, onion and garlic powder, salt and pepper.  I also used my own homemade freezer jam.  It was fresh and delicious!

Very simple, very tasty. Thanks for the recipe, I appreciated how easy it was & that it used up some of that seasoned rice vinegar I bought by accident thinking it was plain :)

This is delicious! Based on the reviews, I thought it would be good, but I didn't expect it to be nearly as good as it is. I measured out 1/8 cup of olive oil and 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar into a 1 3/4 cup container and roughly filled the rest with berry jam. It's sweeter than most vinaigrettes are and would be perfect for a salad that has fruit in it. I used it on a mixed veggie salad and still liked it a lot, though. I tried to get away with just stirring it, but you do have to use the blender as called for. (Sometime I'm going to try it with a homeade fruit puree and honey in place of the jam to make it a bit healthier/more natural, but I know I'm just being picky!) Thanks for sharing!

excellent recipe - just right and not complicated!  I live overseas and have to make my own dressing with limited ingredients, so the simpler the better.  I used apple cider vinegar instead because we don't have rice vinegar here.  Worked great!

Never been a fan of raspberry dressing but this is the first one I really like to my own surprise. A bit tart though , what is the best way to reduce tartness ?  add water or add honey or simply reduce the vinegar ?

I'll give it a solid 4.5   I love the fact it is a relatively simple dish with limited, common ingredients.  I used a President's Choice (store brand) double fruit raspberry jam and I think next time I'll need to try a different one as it didn't carry a real raspberry flavour.  Threw in some fresh ones to try to rescue it.
Love the balance with a tart kick!

Too much vinegar. I use the 3 to 1 ratio for vinaigrette. 3 parts oil to 1 part acid. That's a vinaigrette.

I have made this recipe many times and always love it. I use whatever mild vinegar that I have  on hand and blend and store using my Magic Bullet. I use the dressing on a salad consisting of Bibb and or leaf lettuce, sugared walnuts, blueberries, and goat cheese. It's an easy salad to prepare for parties.

5 stars for delicious salad dressing. 
Simplicity works!

****Ok it's now a few days later. 
This stuff should be illegal.  Every night it's a party in my mouth.
****OMG - misplaced recipe & had to view again = major watering mouth just thinking about this vinaigrette!

I needed a good raspberry vinaigrette for my dinner party, and was pretty sure I had a jar of seedless raspberry jam. When it came time, I found out I was wrong. However, I did have a jar of apricot jam, so I used that. I got numerous compliments on this dressing, it really was easy and fabulous. Keeper!

While I did make a two serving version of this, there is just too much raspberry jam and not enough oil and vinegar.  So the concoction is overly sweet and rather thick.  It is, however, quite a good base and, if one ups the oil and vinegar a bit, the dressing would be quite superb.  I was very surprised to see that many thought the vinegar taste was too strong.  I did use the flavored rice vinegar as called for in the recipe - and am wondering if those who had the strong taste either used apple cider or balsamic vinegar.

This is awesome!!  It is much better than any dressing I have bought. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe and loved it.  The next time I added 1 tsp of gourmet mustard and it added a whole new depth to it.  Either way is fantastic.

This is so easy and tasty! I always prefer homemade dressings and this is a good one! I used it on the recipe "Apple Almond Crunch Salad" on this site and it was fabulous! Next time I will start with half the vinegar and add according to my taste.

This was good. I think ill add a twist of lime next time. I also added a bit more vinegar because it was way too sweet without it. Maybe the jam I used though.. I also subbed the rice for cider.

This was so much better than store bought.  I had to add a few teaspoons of sugar (I got the sugar free raspberry jar by mistake)

A simple and delicious dressing. We'll be making this frequently because it uses ingredients we always have on hand.
