I used NY strips cause that is what I had still turned out great the sauce was a little on the balsamic side, I would suggest cutting back a little.

I reduced the balsamic as suggested to 1/8 cup, used shallots in place of onions and I added 3 tablespoons of beef broth to the mushrooms and white wine. Otherwise, I followed the recipe...it was fabulous. It had a nice sweet tangy flavor that went well with the filet mignon.

Basically a very good recipe but I think it called for too much balsamic vinegar.  I would cut this down to 1/8 cup. I added about 1/4 cup of chopped onions and browned them in the butter.  Then I added the mushrooms followed by the wine with 1 teaspoon of Maggi Sauce.  As directed I added the balsamic vinegar and reduced the liquid.  I added just a bit more wine with some salt and pepper to taste and then a little cornstarch with water to thicken the sauce.  My husband loved it and with less vinegar I think this will be a winner!

Excellent recipe - the mushroom Marsala sauce was so delicious with the steak. I did have to add more liquid as the mushrooms soaked up the sauce. Everyone at my dinner party loved it. Will absolutely make it again & again.

This is a great recipe, I have been making it for years. But you only need about 2-tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and the Marsala Wine needs to be about a 1 1/2 cups and 1/2 cup of beef broth and the mushrooms most definitely needs to be Portabella to make this taste like a real marsala sauce.

I think there should be a bit less balsamic - the taste of cooked balsamic overpowers the wine and mushrooms.  Still - it was a great meal.

I just made this for my husband and he LOVED it. (I dont eat red meat ever so I didnt taste it) He said it was restaurant quality. I reduced the balsamic vinegar a bit based on the reviews but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I didnt have a pan that is oven proof so after searing it in the skillet, I placed it in a glass dish to bake in  the oven. (i just sprayed the dish w/ a bit of pam cooking spray) To be honnest, I do not like to cook....its stressful and not enjoyable for me. But even for me it was soooo easy and my somewhat particular husband LOVED it! Thanks!!!

I used top round sirloin and canned mushrooms and did cut the balsamic vinegar down as others suggested.  This was wonderful.  Steaks were cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious!

Wow, this really is foolproof.  I'm not a strong cook, but this turned out excellent!  I didn't have Marsala wine, so I used sherry.  I also took the advice to reduce the balsamic vinegar, but I took it further and only put in 1 Tbsp.  I don't have a skillet that can go into the oven, so after searing the steaks for a couple minutes on each side, I broiled them the rest of the way, 4 minutes one side and 3 min. on the other.  They were just a tad overdone (more medium than medium rare) but still good!

Very easy to make and very delicous to eat. The only thing I changed was to add in freshed garlic cloves to both the steak while in the oven and also crushed into the sauce. Turned out very good. Thank you for sharing.

This turned out better than I anticipated. I used sirloin steaks (yea filet mignon was a lil too pricey for my liking), adjusted to 1/8 c of balsamic like the others suggested and added a teaspoon of flour for a thickener (I like my marsala sauce on the thicker side). PERFECT!!

Wow! This was fantastic. I cooked one really nice ribeye for my hubby and I to split and cut the sauce recipe in half and it was definitely rave worthy! I followed the recipe as stated but added a little bacon to the mushroom sauce and only cooked the steak 9 minutes and it was WONDERFUL!! So easy, so good!!

Well, the filet was cooked perfectly and I really liked the sauce but as others have said it is a bit vinegary. That said, while I liked this sauce, I also served this to my teenage son and his friend and I did not get any positive feedback (not unusual); but really I think it was a little to much to serve to teens or children and would save this to serve to adults.

This was excellent.  I made it for myself (half of the recipe) and took under consideration all of the comments.  I used only 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar.  It was perfect although I think I reduced the sauce too much.  There was barely any left.  I will make this again for family and friends as is.

Less vinegar...only added two tablespoons because I only had two steaks. Marsala added a slight sweet flavor to the mushrooms. Really great flavor. Will make again.

We had a pleasantly warm day a couple of weeks ago so I decided to have Hubs grill this.  I made the mushroom sauce early in the afternoon.  When the mushrooms were nicely browned I removed them from the pan and proceeded with the sauce.  After the long simmering process I added the mushrooms back to the sauce.  This was easily reheated while the steaks were grilling.  Rather than adding the green onions to the sauce I used them as a garnish when plating.

Very good. Although I will use about half of the balsamic next time.

I made this recipe for the sauce, not the steak.  I love marsala sauces in restaurants and wanted to make my own.  This one had good flavor but was too heavy on the mushroom and not enough "sauce".  I really love mushrooms so all was not lost, but this basically made marsala flavored mushrooms, not a marsala sauce with mushrooms.  Next time I would cut back on the mushrooms and double the marsala bit.  I added the balsamic slowly as people said it was too strong and it only took a little before I started really tasting the vinegar, so 1/4 c would be way too much.  Not sure why it's necessary at all and will leave it out entirely next time.  The sauce really lacked body, so I would add cornstarch or something to thicken it next time.  Good flavor, but not what I wanted.

A definite keeper.  It was wonderful.  I did omit (much to my chagrin) the mushrooms, since the family doesn't like them.  I also used a black cherry balsamic because that is what I had. I expect this recipe varies a lot depending on the balsamic you use so get one you really like or cut back on it and rely on the Marsala. The steaks were perfectly done. Mine were almost 3 inches thick so I went 14 minutes and that cooked them to an internal 140 degrees. (Thus I did nor tent them in tinfoil to rest but, rather, served immediately. Thank you for sharing!

Quick and delicious. I just used butter, garlic, onions and tabasco with my mushrooms. Served with angel hair pasta and salad for the fastest and best meal.

Have to agree with Grifo, the vinegar was very pronounced and THERE, but otherwise very delicious. The filet was sooo tender, I didn't have Marsala wine so I used Merlot (lol I AM crazy) but couldn't taste the alcohol, mushrooms were tender, onions gave wonderful flavor to everything. 13 minutes in the oven AFTER browning the filet was spot on, my fiancé loved everything. Next time will put slightly less vinegar.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe. If you cook the meat right, the sauce sends it over the top. I made it as written and everyone thought it was great. The next time I added a small clove of garlic and wow- it was amazing. The hubs asks me to make this all the time!
