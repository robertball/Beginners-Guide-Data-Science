Very tasty! Made as recipe directed. Next time I will dry my zucchini with paper towels before mixing them with the other ingredients. make sure the pan is hot before you drop you patties into the oil. The teenagers who don't like veggies ate this!

Think I might prefer soda crackers. will try that next. I added about 1/4 c chopped mushrooms to the leftover batter next day. That was good also. A great way to use up that wonderful zucchini and to experiment to your own taste.

The only thing I added was dash of cayenne pepper and some shredded Parmesan cheese along with the shredded pre made 4 cheese  Mecican package.  Used my food processor to shred the zucchini and onion    Served with sour cream once and apple sauce once, good with both.  Leftovers are good reheated the next day

I used gold zucchini & Oaxaca cheese instead of cheddar.  I am sure these would be great with cheddar, I just didn't have any. I used the food processor for the zucchini, onion and to crush the crackers.   One tip, they are rather difficult to flip if you make them large.  Rather than 8 large pancakes I did 16 smaller ones and they were much easier to turn.  Also, I would wait to add the egg and salt until just before you cook them.  As the batter sits it gets a little runny.  Mixing it up just before cooking solved that.  Thanks for a nice way to use up a ton of zucchini.

These are delicious! I scaled it down to 3 servings (uses 1 egg). In place of the onion, I used onion powder. I used grated parmesan cheese in place of the cheddar (about half the amount) and added garlic powder. They browned very quickly, in about 2 min each side on med heat. Like I do with potato pancakes, I topped with a little granulated white sugar, and they were so good!  Thanks Beth.....very good recipe!

It turned out excellent.  I used sharp cheddar.  I also added some match stock carrots I had in the fridge.  Will definitely make them again

I didn't have all the right ingredients and this still came out tasting great. I used multi grain crackers and a Mexican cheese blend because that's what I had on hand. The pancakes were a huge hit with my family. I think next time I will add some grated carrot and chop the onion a little finer. This is definitely a keeper.
