Was a little puzzled about seasoned salt in this recipe, but I added it, and there really was no reason for concern, it was good.  At this time of year, I always have a fridge full of fresh fruit, but the fridge was just a little too full right now, so I decided to mix up a big fruit salad.  This dressing really brought some life to the perfectly-ripe fruit, a little tang from the vinegar, and some extra sweetness from the honey...good balance.  I did end up adding more poppy seeds simply because we like them.  Thanks, charles coello, we enjoyed your recipe.***UPDATE 7.19.14***  Just an FYI.  I had some of the fruit salad left where I'd used this dressing, so I threw it in the blender, added some vanilla Greek yogurt, crushed ice, and it made a delicious breakfast smoothie.

This is a good dressing; quick and easy to put together.
***Use a GOOD quality extra virgin olive oil instead of canola which is highly processed and loaded with GMOs***
