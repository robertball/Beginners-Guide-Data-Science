Delicious! I used sweet onion in place of the red and added in a bit of green pepper that I had to use up. The beauty of this recipe is that you can put anything in it! I'm a cheeseburger lover, and this rated right up there with the traditional one. Next time, the family wants me to add bacon. This is a definite keeper...YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
