Wow, this is super good and super easy to make. I used pecans in place of the hazelnuts and left out the currants because I don't care for any fruit in my fudge. Will make again.

Super easy and delicious fudge! I did omit the currants, who knew they would be so hard to find but I did use hazelnuts. The Baileys is the perfect addition to the fudge too, not sure I would want to add the dried fruit at all.

Super easy and foolproof! It was a last minute decision, so I used a combination of milk chocolate, semisweet, and white chocolate chips which is what I had on hand. It still turned out great! Also omitted the nuts and currants. The Baileys was perfect flavouring and the sea salt on top was a nice added touch. Will be adding this to my regular Christmas goodies list.

What an ingenious way to use Baileys!  And easy and yummy too.  I couldn't find hazelnuts anywhere, so I substituted toasted almond slivers.  I also couldn't find currants but my husband isn't a fan, so I omitted them.  This fudge was quick, easy, delicious and ends up looking like fudge you'd buy in a store.

this was ok. i didn't add the hazelnuts or currants. the 1st time i made it i used dark chocolate chips as the recipe calls for. i didn't care for it. dark chocolate was overpowering. the 2nd time i made it, i used semi sweet chocolate chips and again didn't add the hazelnuts or currants. it was much smoother. not sure if i'd make it again tho

This was my second try in many years at making fudge. My first try was microwave fudge, which gets A+s for ease. This recipe, while not hard is definitely more work intensive than the microwave method. However, IMO, this fudge has a better texture. As another microwave fudge cooker wrote, this recipe gets thick, pretty much too thick to stir. I agree this one is a solid upper body workout, however, instead of discarding the recipe, I recommend adding a generous splash (about 1/2-3/4 C of evaporated milk) while stirring. This really helped the texture issue. Next, I added 1/2 C of Bailey's. I still did not find the Bailey's flavor strong enough, so next time I shall add 1/2 C evaporated milk while stirring and 1 C of Bailey's afterwards. Methinks that shall be perfect.

Very thick, hard to cut, and I like my quicky microwave fudge (dark cocoa, butter, powdered sugar, milk and vanilla) recipe much better. I couldn't even taste the Baileys, so a waste of good  Irish Cream! Sorry, Rachel.

Simple fudge recipe that proves to be very versatile! Loved the chocolate & Baileys Irish Cream flavor combo. We substituted walnuts and raisins for this recipe since currants were hard to find and didn't have hazelnuts on hand. Giving this as a holiday gift this year, its so good! Making another batch using pecans and pomegranate infused craisins.
