This was excellent! We didn't have any crescent rolls, so we used canned biscuits instead. I also added more cheese than what it calls for just to use up the little I would have had left over. It ended up tasting a lot like cheesy garlic bread, just with zuchinnis mixed in. I added the photo since there wasn't one originally, so I don't know if that's what the original recipe is supposed to look like, but I followed it closely otherwise and it was great!

I have a very similiar recipe and its fabulous.  I love to make it as often as I can.  Only thing is that I use dijon mustard instead but its well worth trying with yellow mustard.

I made this as a last minute dish for a dinner we were having. The only thing I didn't have in stock was mozzarella cheese, so I substituted Colby jack cheese and a small amount of Asiago cheese. I also used half zucchini and yellow squash. I didn't have an 8 X 12 sized casserole but a 7 X 11 was perfect. A very quick and easy dish to make and tasted great. Our guest couldn't stop raving about it and they are pretty picky eaters. Baked up nice in 20 minutes and had a nice texture to it that held together very well when served.

This is a recipe I go to again and again. It's fabulous! I make it with crust or without, and have used egg beaters and reduced fat cheese. It's always good! Dont leave out the mustard! It sounds a little odd but it gives it a great flavor. I am now asked to bring this to every family get together and people raved about it at a baby shower I brought it to. Great healthy veggie dish! Enjoy!

Turned out great! Used a 9 x 13 cake pan and baked for 20 mins and it was perfect. Used a zucchini and fresh basil from the garden :) Also used the dijon instead . Loved it!

I just made this for the first time, and it's delicious!! I got it from my first issue of the Allrecipes magazine (yay!) and followed the recipe with the suggested changes/instructions given by the magazine. For example, cook spices with onion and zucchini for better flavor instead of waiting until they are cooked to add spices. Another example: cool zucchini mixture 5 minutes before adding to egg mixture to avoid scrambling. This dish is wonderful. I am always looking for zucchini or yellow squash recipes that don't end up too runny; this was perfect, and super tasty too.

I made this after I was asked to bring a dish to an pot luck.  I used the basic recipe.  Used honey mustard salad dressing instead of regular mustard.  I added cream cheese along with the mozzarella cheese. I also threw in a left over sweet potato with the zucchini when sauteing.   I also topped the entire pie with crispy bacon after it was out of the oven.  Huge hit...but anything with crescent rolls, cheese and bacon is gonna be great.  I used all of the required items but added stuff that I just had on hand.  Delicious...

This is a keeper! I used half zucchini and half yellow squash, and baked in a deep glass pie plate. Instead of basil and oregano, I used 1 tsp Italian seasonings (Penzey's Tuscan Sunset) and a little marjoram. I used whole grain mustard on the crust, enough to lightly coat the whole crust. Although some of the dough triangles were misshapen, I pinched all the seams together and it worked great. Don't make your crust extend too far above the dish, or else, like in the photo, the outermost edges will brown before the middle is set. A double recipe would be great for a potluck!

I have a similar recipe with no spices in it.  It was very bland.  This recipe is the best!  I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 in baking dish.  It was awesome!

this was good. I followed recipe except baked it in an 8x8  Pyrex.  took about 8 minutes longer.  Maybe drain the zucchini after sauteing. It was a little watery.

Oh my gosh this is good!  Even the non-squash eating kids loved it.  I forgot to buy mozzarella cheese and had to sub in Monterey jack.  It was still fantastic!  Thanks for a super yummy recipe, Kate B :)

It was really good.  I would say be sure to cook off your zucchini long enough to get some of the water out -- you don't want it to be soggy when done.  You can really play with the ingredients listed; it is a unique side item most folks will really enjoy.

I made this for an appetizer party recently.  It was a huge hit!  I made a few little changes - used 1 minced clove of garlic in place of the garlic powder and added it to the zucchini and onion as they were being sautéed.  I left out the mustard - it just did not appeal to me.  Had lots of requests for the recipe.

I found this recipe years ago in an old cookbook. I mainly make it when we are serving a brunch. I follow the recipe as given, except I make it in a pie pan. I often prepare this dish the night before I am going to serve it. I will put the prepared crust in a large ziploc bag and refrigerate. I will also prepare the filling and put it in a covered bowl and refrigerate. In the morning, I fill the pie crust and bake. Because everything is cold, it needs longer to cook. Even my carnivore guests love it and go for seconds. We never have leftovers.

I have been making this since the Allrecipes Magazine came out with the recipe in it. I have made it many times exactly as written and everyone loves it.  Today, I made it, adding some diced carrots because I had some that needed to be used.  I have found that I like dijon mustard better.  Other than that, it is a great recipe that can easily be modified depending on the kind of squash you have and other vegetables can be added and it is always good.

This recipe is incredible. The original recipe was a Pillsbury recipe contest winner back in the 1980s sometime and I have been making it ever since.  That original recipe called for the Crescent rolls to be spread in a 10" glass pie dish. I have found that you can also freeze it after it is put together but BEFORE baking.  Just carefully put it on a shelf in the freezer.  After it freezes cover it tightly with foil.  Defrost in the refrigerator and bake according to directions.  This recipe will "Wow" your family too.

This is a wonderful dish to freeze. I added ground beef but sausage would be great as well. I used large pop open biscuts, if you let them set for a few minutes two of them will spread nicely in the bottom and up the sides of an 8-9 in pie tin, this receipe makes three pies, I now have 6 in the freezer. The family loves the flavor.

I've been making this for years..it's a winner. I Caramelize the onions and use country Dijon. I've tried various cheeses  too.. They are all good.. Guess my favs are a mix of muenster and Colby Jack.

I made this recipe for the first time tonight, and it was such a hit. I was concerned because I used zucchini from our garden that had been blanched and frozen. No worries there, I just drained the water out, and sauteed the zucchini with the onion. Also, instead of crescent rolls, I used a ready made pie crust, the kind that comes rolled up in a box. I added all spices mentioned, and mozzeralla cheese. I was concerned about the yellow mustard  but it gave the dish extra flavor.This dish with a salad makes for a perfect meal.  I'll be making this dish again THANKS!

I was skeptical of this recipe because of the mustard.  BUT, i followed the recipe and used real garlic(not sure why you shouldn't)  I added a little pecorino Romano  cheese to the top with some sliced tomatoes because i had some to use up.  
THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS AND EASY!!!
HUSBAND really loved it as well!!!

First zuchinni (or squash) casserole my husband liked.  I made it for large dinner party, and it was a hit.  Followed recipe exactly but added some cheddar cheese on top.  Did follow advice to let zuchinni mixture cool before adding to eggs.  Can't wait to try with bacon!

I added about shredded roaster chicken and 8oz of sharp cheddar cheese for added flavor.  What a great dinner.  Loved it!  PS, thanks All recipes for sending me a magazine.  I would not have found this if it were not for that.

This is such an easy, yummy recipe.  It is served cool, so perfect to make ahead of time and put out as a nibbly appetizer or as a side at dinner.  I used an 8 x 11 baking dish and it came out just right.

I followed the recipe exactly.  After it cooked for 20 mins, I broiled it for 5 mins to get the top brown.  This was really easy to make and very taste.  I think next time I might add a little lemon juice, it just seemed like it needed some citrus,  but that’s just my taste buds

I loved the flavor of this dish but personally I would have preferred it without the biscuits.  Next time I will layer the veges and cheese in a pie dish, bake and serve hot.

A big hit with everyone. No leftovers! I have also made it without the drought for a delicious gluten free side dish.

I added venison sausage to it but I did not like the combination of mozzarella and zucchini. I think I would prefer cheddar instead. I really disliked the soggy bottom. I almost feel like the crust should have been parbaked because the taste of the almost raw dough was unappetizing.

I make this at least 3 times a month during zucchini season.. my husband LOVES this! The only changes I make are to add about 1/3 cup grated Parmesan, top it with thin slices of garden tomatoes, and use a pie dish instead of the casserole pan. Delish!

I've made this a few times as a different way to use the bountiful zucchini in my garden.  My sons didn't like the strong taste of the yellow mustard, so I tried it with Miracle Whip instead, and they ate it enthusiastically.  My husband said it was better with the Miracle Whip.  We aren't huge fans of onions, so we often don't make it with the onions, either, and it tastes great without them.  I've also used frozen sliced zucchini, so this is a way to save fresh zucchini and use it later.

I had puffed pastry dough, so used that. Not sure it was best. Have always thought anything would work in puff pastry :). 
Very tasty, though.
