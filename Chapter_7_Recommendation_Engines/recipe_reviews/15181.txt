This was good, however, my family liked my own recipe better. I do the opposite; I dredge chicken in flour first and then the egg and fry until golden.  I also make a lemon sauce by melting one stick of butter in a sauce pan adding chicken (depending on how much chicken I have) and the juice of several lemons (to taste) Once it comes to a boil I stir in a water/cornstarch mixture to thicken.  I then pour sauce over chicken and bake for about 40 mins. at 350.

I think this recipe has tremendous potential, but will need some tweaking.  My coating stayed on PERFECTLY!... I dipped in flour first, then egg (and left it to marinade for about 20 mins), then flour again, then egg and then finally coated in flour and tossed in the pan.  I heated the pan first, then the butter, then put the chicken in and it browned quickly.  I also pounded it pretty thin.  The coating was perfectly crisp and it even stayed pretty decent with the broth, but next time I think I will keep the broth separate and instead pour everything over linguini.

I'm going to give this recipe a second try.  On my first attempt I should have
realized not to follow the instructions so closely and use a little more common 
sense, because when I poured the chicken stock/lemon juice mixture over the 
sauted chicked breasts and simmered it caused the coating to undo itself from
the chicken.  It would have been better to have kept the chicken separate and
prepare the chicken stock/lemon juice mixture separately and pour over the 
chicken at the last minute.  Also I found thickening the stock/juice slightly with
a flour and water mixture improved it (clings to the chicken better) and also I 
added a little bit of lemon zest to both the egg batter and the stock/juice.  
The presentation of my first attempt was not attractive, but the taste was 
superb so I'll have to thank Paula for this recipe.  My second attempt will most
definitely be c'est magnifique!  ____________________________________ Joe Marx

Absolutely TA DIE FOR!! Seriously, out of dozens of recipes I've tried on allrecipes, this is by far one of THE BEST. I took the recipe a little further. I marinated the chicken breast in lemon juice & lemon pepper spices first for about 15-20 min. at room temp. I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the skillet before throwing the chicken in. And I added more paprika on the chicken after putting it in the skillet. After the chicken was cooked, I took it out and put in on a plate, then wrapped it in foil to keep it hot.  Then I made a sort of gravy/sauce out of the leftover chicken broth, etc in the pan. I just mixed in corn starch, milk and a little chicken stock. To serve, I put cooked egg noodles on the plate first, then the sauce, and then topped it with the chicken. Served with sweet corn & it was an amazing meal. It would also have been really good if I cut the cooked chicken up and mixed the sauce, egg noodles and chicken all together. Oh, & I did have to make extra sauce - the egg noodles soak it up. Finally, I did not put the sauce/gravy over the chicken. It didn't need it - it was incredible without it! The author's description of the chicken said, "Heaven" & it's really true, this meal was HEAVEN on a plate. My fiance kept saying over and over, "THIS IS AWESOME!" He couldn't eat it fast enough & kept asking for seconds. His friend, who was a Caterer for the stars also LOVED it! THANKS!!!!

I made these last night for my housewarming party, and my Aunt came in and helped me.  The trick to keeping the mixture on the chicken is very easy.  First you heat the pan, then heat the oil.  Make sure the oil is hot, then  flour, egg your chicken then add to pan.  The trick is, you can only flip your chicken once, after the shell has formed on the chicken and is golden brown.

Very delicious!! I omitted the garlic powder and paprika.  Will definitely add next time as well as white wine.

My result was "magnifique" but I added more seasonings and I dredged my (paper-towel dried) chicken in flour then eggs then flour again. I simmered the chicken in the sauce until it reduced to the point where I wanted it to be. We thought this was outstanding, but I can see how the original instructions would yield a somewhat bland product with potentially no crust sticking to it, so that's why not 5 stars. But if you add additional herbs (I used 1/4 tsp. Mrs. Dash, 1/4 tsp. paprika, 1/4 tsp. pepper and 1/8 tsp. salt) and dredge flour-eggs-flour, I think everyone would come up with the same fantastic result. Too bad it isn't written that way -- this is a hidden gem which lacks only a little seasoning "to taste" to make it outstanding. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent. I add white wine to the chicken broth and thicken with cornstarch. Pour it over the chicken after it has browned and bake before dinner for about 30 minutes. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese and serve with spaghetti. A friend who gets this at every restaurant gave  it rave reviews.

We loved the recipe - very good.   To the question of how to keep the meat from losing its coating - just turn once.  I tried it with the second batch an it worked perfectly.  We will be adding this to our regular menus.

This was indeed the best! I used most of the other suggestions in the other comments - from pounding and sauteing the chicken to adding cornstarch to the liquid. The chicken was so tender and moist and the overall flavor was fabulous!

This recipe is practically a twin to Chicken Piccata II. Try adding more paprika and garlic powder to flour, up to 1/2 tsp of each. Use 1/3 cup of lemon juice to intensify the flavor. The coating sticks much better if you first coat the chicken in the flour mixture, then dip in the egg mixture, then coat in the flour mixture again. Combine 2 Tbs butter and 2 Tbs olive oil in a medium hot skillet. Hot frying oil prevents greasy coatings. When chicken is browned on both sides, add half of the lemon juice and broth, cover and lower heat to a simmer (medium-low) for 20 minutes. Turn breasts after 10 minutes. Near end of cooking time, add rest of broth and lemon juice for a wonderful sauce. Remove chicken, and sprinkle capers into skillet to liven the sauce further. Turn heat to high and stir until liquid begins to boil. Pour sauce on serving platter and place chicken with lemon slices atop.

My husband and I both thought this was a bit bland, even though I added a touch of white wine.  The sauce was very watery, should have added a bit of cornstarch.  Like a previous reviewer's experience, a lot of my coating was left in the pan.  It was alright, but won't make it again.

Tasted good, but does anyone know why the breading came loose in the fry pan?  When I added the liquid, it came even more loose to the point that I had to strain the sauce because it looked unappetizing.  Flavor was good, though.

This recipe was very good, however terribly plain!! I'm from New York, where chicken francaise is a catering necessity at large social gatherings. First, I did what another reviewer suggested and let the chicken breasts marinate in lemon juice and some lemon pepper spice. Poke holes in the breasts with a fork before doing so, that way, the extra flavor sinks into the meat. I added a lot of paprika to the flour, to the point where it was a light brick color. Then with the sauce, garlic was a MUST! I was so surprised it was not included in this recipe. Nor was there any butter in it! I melted a stick of butter in with about 2 cloves of minced garlic. Once that was thoroughly heated, I added the broth and squeezed the lemon juice into it. Once that heated, I added a little bit of flour mixed with some water to thicken the sauce. I kept the sauce separate from the chicken also, for fear the coating would come off. I threw linguine on our plates, topped with chicken, then sauce. Fabulous!

I made this last week, and the normally pickiest eater (meat & potatoes only please) had 3 servings!  I agree with the other reviews about preparing the sauce in a separate skillet and adding at the last minute.  Also make sure you pound the chicken really thin before breading.  I also fried the chicken in MUCH more butter then it recommended (a whole stick!) and it was really delicious.  I also recommend saving a little of the breading mixture (mixed with water or broth) to thicken the sauce before serving, a little more like a gravy.  Enjoy!

Believe it or not but I used Flounder instead of chicken because I could not find no other recipe I really like and this one did it for me. I cannot tell you how D-Lish this was. My husband and I wished we had a pound of fish after we ate it.
I listened to the readers who advised the double dip method-flour,egg and then flour again. I sauteed it in butter and olive oil and it cooked up quick, golden and wonderful-restaurant quailty. Try it and you will NOT be disssapointed

Wonderful flavor...everyone at dinner party enjoyed & left nary a morsel on their plates.  I rated it a 3 only b/c I used cornstarch in lieu of flour.  It sticks better & crisps up nicer....like fried shrimp or mar far chicken in Chinese restaurants.  I also thickened the sauce & served it puddled underneath the pounded & fried chicken.    It was beautiful garnished with thin slices of fresh lemon, a sprinkle of parsley & a dash of paprika.  Served over angel hair pasta cooked in chicken broth.  Will definitely make again.  Thank YOU!

Not too shabby! Needed to tweak a bit, but overall not too bad. I did bake in the oven after browning on the stovetop. Also added sliced garlic and it DEFINITELY needs salt which isn't mentioned on the ingredients list. I also dipped in the flour and then the egg and had absolutely NO problem with the coating falling off. I served it with rice and green beans. It was a hit, but there's lots to clean up now, better run!

Good. Might try to add more of the seasonings into the flour. For the sauce: 1/2 c. white wine, 1/2 c. chicken broth, and a bit of corn starch.

I made this recipe last week for my family, and we all loved it.  Even my picky 4 yr old said she liked it and wanted me to make it again.  I have had this in restaurants before, and I think this version is just as good or even better.  I just added one more ingredient, and that was a splash of white wine to the sauce.  This is a keeper that I will definitely make again!

I gave this 4 stars as is because it is a really good base recipe. I added some extra spices to the flour before I dredged the chicken, just for some flavor. I also added wine to the sauce, around one cup to every 2 cups of broth. With these changes it was absolutely delicious and I made it in no time.

5 stars only when using all the other suggestions and changes- I pounded the chicken thin, dipped in flour and THEN egg, after browning, i put it in oven for about 30 min at 425 with the sauce (which i mixed up seperatly- not with the chicken) and added a little more lemon juice and white wine.  Enjoyed!

De'solee, but there is no way this is French without wine sauce. This recipe is more like chicken franglais. MUST add some good quality white wine to the sauce. I like Pinot grigio myself. Anything dry will do, but you'll enjoy even more if you select a wine you'll drink with the meal. Also definitely throw in a bit of cornstarch. Now we're talkin.

Chicken Francaise is my all time favorite restaurant dinner. I'm surpised to see how few restaurants offer it. I usually have to ask if the chef will make it for me. Most know how to. Actually I prefer it as a shrimp dish. Since pounded chicken and jumbro shrimp cook at about the same time and temp, the recipe works for both. But the recipe I have used at home includes finely grated romano cheese in the flour dredging mix which I highly recommend.

Wow! This was awesome!!  I pounded out the chicken as suggested in other reviews and sliced some of the thicker breasts in half.  I had to cook a bit longer than the recipe said to get the browning I wanted, so I had to add more butter.  When I added the broth/lemon mixture, I was afraid it was going to be way too runny.  I let it simmer on medium low longer than suggested, and voila!  It thickened up quite nicely!  Just give it time and leave the lid off.  Man, good stuff!  Will be fixing again soon for the family!  Also, I added more than a pinch of garlic powder to the flour, probably four or five dashes of the bottle.

This was excellent!  My husband loved it!  So easy to make too.  I added about 1 tsp of each garlic powder and paprika to the flour.  Also a couple cloves of grated garlic to the chicken broth.  Absolutely delicious!

This was an excellent dish.  My husband is already asking me to make it again.  I think the next time I make it however I will soak the chicken in the lemon sauce prior to making the dish.  I think the taste could be a little stronger.

This is a tasty dish and is not too difficult to make. I cooked it last week with the salad on this website, "Arugula, Fennel and Orange Salad".  It was definitely a dish I will make again!  I also thickened the sauce with cornstarch (my preference).  I will also try adding white wine next time.

I read the many reviews before attempting it.  So I made the modifications that most suggested. This came out wonderfully with a few modifications.  I made the coating thicker by using flour, egg, then flour again. I also made the sauce separately in a pot, adding white whine, a flour or cornstarch mix with a whisk, and added it on top of the chicken just before serving.  An excellent recipe that is family approved.  And relatively easy to make.

This was great!!!  I added capers and thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch and served it with pasta.   Reminded me of chicken piccata.  I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  This would be great with veal too.  Pound the chicken breasts and sear them over hot heat really quick on each side to keep the chicken moist and tender.

For those of you who's chicken breasts were too thick...buy yourself a mallet ($10) and pound out the chicken breast between two pieces of saran wrap.  Place a piece on a large cutting board, place the chicken (1 at a time) add the second piece of saran wrap and pound til thin.  A hammer works too.  You will also get alot more for your buck when pounding chicken out.  This was a great, simple recipe...but I added a little water to the egg wash and really seasoned the flour with kosher salt, white pepper and herbs du province.  Be creative!

I did as other suggested and dipped it in the flour then egg....and the outer layer stayed on perfect. also as others suggested, you can only flip the chicken one time on each side.  I had very thick chicken breast so i cut them in half and made several thiner pieces. Served with pasta that i boiled in chicken broth. it was great.

Great recipe that I didn't have to leave the house to make (no food shopping). Taste was excellent, with a few additions such as fresh garlic in the lemon/stock mix. I also added an egg and pounded flour to breast  to ensure a breading that would withstand simmering in stock. A little extra butter so cutlets wouldn't burn, and it was a perfect meal.. -Kenny g-

Gave this recipe a try and made a few wonderful changes to it.  I read the other review about the sauce being too runny and problems with the order of frying the chicken.  

Here's what I tried: sauteed some garlic and onions first, then coated the chicken with egg and flour mixture (either order works.)  Cooked the chicken with the sauteed onions and garlic, turning them until they were a nice golden brown.  Then, I mixed the broth, lemon juice and parsley with 1 tbsp of corn starch to thicken and added it to the chicken in the pan.  Let this cook for a few minutes and finally added lemon slices, chopped tomatoes and shredded cheddar cheese to the mixture (on simmering chicken and in the broth too.)  All together, I believe we cooked it for maybe 10 minutes and then served on linguine (or for the more Italian method - mix the sauce mixture with the pasta and serve in one giant container so as to get the pasta to absorb the sauce before serving.)

It's a great recipe that could be made just a little better by adding in the cheese and other veggies and as one reviewer wrote "just using a little common sense."

One of the easiest and best francaise recipes I've ever tried.  The whole family loved it.  Light and refreshing taste.  The proportions of lemon and egg were perfect.  Will make again and again.  Thanks.

This was so good.  I fried chicken strips in 2T olive oil and 1T butter with 1T fresh minced garlic, omitting the powder.  When browned, I added another tablespoon of butter & then the broth mixture.  After simmering I drained & beated in 1T sour cream into liquid to thicken, then poured back over chicken.  I wish I read the comments about adding white wine prior to making, sounds like that would add a nice touch :)

This was easy to make and tasted good.  I followed two different cooks’ suggestions.  I made extra lemon sauce with 1 cube of butter, chicken broth, salt, and lemon juice, to taste, then thickened it with corn starch and water.  I liked the taste, but as this was my first time preparing a lemon sauce, I will add garlic to the next one and see how that tastes.  I dipped my chicken in the flour first, then the egg with lemon juice, and left the chicken in the egg/lemon juice to marinate for 20 min.  Then I floured and egged it again, browned the chicken in the butter with a little olive oil, placed the chicken in a baking dish poured some of the lemon sauce over it and baked it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes.  I served the chicken over linguini, each person add as much sauce as they desired and with green beans on the side.

I have been making my own recipe for yrs but always felt like it had too much of a lemon bite.  So I gave this recipe a whir and I am so happy I did!!! I followed the recipe to a "T". The only change I made was keeping my chicken in skillet and pouring the broth mixture over it.  If you do this it will reduce and soak up in the chicken. I served it with Trader Joe's Lemon Pepper Wide Pasta (which I just tossed after cooking it with a splash of olive oil and added some fresh baby spinach - salt to taste. My husband said it looked and tasted of fine dining quality. I thought so to!!!

This was excellent! Like many other reviewers, I dredged the chicken in some of the flour mixture first, then the egg, then the flour again. Ialso added plenty of garlic because I love it. The one thing I did a little differently because I take no chances with chicken was, as I seared each piece of chicken, I added them to a baking dish then baked the chicken a for 10 additional minutes in a 350 degree oven with the sauce. It did not affect the flavors or burn the chicken at all. Very good!!

This recipe was great!  Chicken Francaise is my favorite, and I have been looking for a good recipe for a long time.  I pounded the chicken thin, and I dredged it in the flour and then the egg.  I did this twice.  I also added more than a pinch of garlic powder and paprika to the flour mixture for more flavor, and I added some grated parmesan cheese to the egg mixture.  After the chicken was brown, I kept it warm in the oven while I made the sauce.  I added a bit of melted butter and white wine to the sauce.  After it boiled, I added a small amount of cornstarch/water mixture to thicken it up.  I think that the lemon flavor of the sauce was a bit strong, so I would reduce the amount of lemon juice in the sauce next time.  Overall, it was delicious!

In the end this was very good. After coating the chicken, I refrigerated it for about 30 mins. This helps to ensure the coating with stick once you fry it. I put the chicken in the oven to finish cooking  while making the sauce. The sauce seemed a bit bland so I added some sugar as well as some cornstarch to thicken. I added the chicken to the pan only for a few minutes before serving. Any longer and the coating is likely to flake off. Next time I will try using half white wine and half chicken broth as well as some sautéed garlic and ginger for the sauce.

This is so good!! But I rarely follow recipes exactly and this was no exception. So I sauteed chopped onions, mushrooms, garlic, and asparagus (all fresh) in butter. Added more lemon to eggs and broth. Added more paprika, garlic powder and seasoned pepper to flour. Double dipped the chicken in egg & flour. Pushed veggies to side of pan added more butter and browned the chicken. Added 2 tsp. of cornstarch to broth and added to pan. Served over hot mini penne pasta. The only thing that would have made it better is a little grated parmesan cheese. Thanks!!

Excellent.  I continue to make this recipe time and again and always get rave reviews.  I am a big fan of francaise and this is better than dining out.  Add a few dashes (or more :) ) of white wine  during the simmering process for an added gourmet flavor.   If your not too sure about how lemony you want it-  you can always cut back a little in that department-    I love it just the way it is..!!!  Thanks !

This was outstanding! I took other cooks' advice and made a few changes, but I loved the sauce so much that I made just the sauce again and used it over pasta with vegetables and chicken. Awesome!

My son and husband really enjoyed this dish.  I altered it a little.  I saw that the so-called sause was kind of thin.  My husband being a chef at a local restraunt, I asked him for some help as I really wasn't satisfied with the end result.  He told me to chop up some garlic and add some milk and cornstarch to thicken the sauce a little.  It turned out great!  I served it with gravy over steamed rice and a green vegetable.  Yummm!!

I followed the recipe and had the same problem with the coating becoming soggy and lifting off the chicken. The other problem I had was that once the chicken was browned, simmering it longer in the sauce made it tough. If I were to make this again, I would use thinner cuts of chicken, make the sauce separately, and pour it over just before serving.

I couldn't wait to make this recipe after reading all the reviews.  What a disappointment.  It was just breaded chicken on spaghetti with a lemon sauce.

This is such a nice base recipe.  I adjusted it to make just one breast, for me, but only cut the broth amount in half and used half a lemon in the broth.  Came out perfectly lemony and lovely.  The chicken (which I pounded) is moist and tender.  I agree with other reviewers there are a ton of things you can do with this to give it a personal spin, but I really liked it as is, found it perfectly flavorful (but again, I used plenty of lemon juice so that was taste was very present).  Add capers if you want it to be more like picatta.

This is a pretty simple and straight forward recipe, however there are a couple of flaws in it that can easily be fixed.  Dredge the chicken FIRST in the flour mixture and SECOND in the egg - this will help the coated stay adhered to the meat as it cooks.  Second, after browning the chicken on both sides (about 4 minutes) remove them and put them on a warm plate and cover it with aluminum foil, then proceed to make the sauce and reduce it down.  Pour the sauce over the plated chicken.  Also don't be afraid to add salt and pepper to the flour mixture, and if you are getting runny sauce add a touch of flour or corn starch to it (but make sure to cook it for at least 60 seconds so the flour will not taste mealy).

This was good and relatively easy.  I did mess with the proportions since I was cooking for 2.  I used 4 chicken tenderloins which I pounded, double dipped ( I also used much more garlic powder and paprika) then browned in a butter/olive oil mixture in a non-stick pan.  I kept the chicken warm in the oven while I sauteed sliced mushrooms and then made the sauce.  I used the proportions for the sauce from the regular recipe for 6 and also added about a 1/2 cup of chardonnay. (we like sauce).  I also thickened it with flour which I had mixed with some of the reserved chicken broth. I added the chicken back to the sauce a couple of minutes before serving.  This was very tasty with whole wheat linguine and steamed asparugus.

This was a very nice, fairly quick chicken dish. Changes I made included using LOTS and LOTS more garlic powder than a pinch & tossing in several sprinkles of herbes de Provence.  I also dredged the chicken in flour/egg/flour again.  I subbed 1/2c of chardonnay for 1/2c of the chicken broth per an old Cooking Light Chicken Francaise recipe I've used for years.  Served with Rice with Herbes de Provence (from this website) and buttery steamed broccoli.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with us, Paula!

I thought this was very tasty.  I saw the comments stating that they thought it was a little bland.  So I doubled up on the lemon, added 1/2 cup white wine and 1 tbsp of corn starch.   It came out awesome!  I served it over white rice everyone loved it!

This is a wonderful dish.  You must flour the chicken before the egg for better results.  Try serving with a angel hair pasta with a little olive oil, and sprinkle with small bacon pieces and sun dried tomatoes!!!!!!!!  Delish!!!

I really like this recipe. Like others I double dipped for a better coating on the chicken, used a little more butter, a little more lemon and white pepper for seasoning. Once the chicken was golden I removed and cooked down the sauce a tad, then replaced it in the pan for the last couple of minutes so it was all good and hot. If the sauce wasn't the consistency I desired, I would add a scant amount of cornstarch or wine and stir some more, with wine just marrying flavor- not becoming a dominant one.

I keep the ingredients for this recipe stocked, as my husband and I crave it!  Fabulous francaise recipe, but here is what I have come up with to make it just a little bit better:  I pound the chicken very thin between two pieces of plastic wrap.  (you can store them like this in the fridge, making prep time quicker).  I double-flour the breasts and brown them in 4 tablespoons of salted butter.  The extra flour will help to keep the coating on the chicken and will also thicken the sauce just a little bit.  (Real chicken francaise sauce is not thick)  I also toss in some sauteed mushrooms at simmer time.  Sometimes I will throw in some capers if I feel like it.  It always comes out perfect and is extremely easy to make!  It's perfect with some jasmine or basmati rice and a salad.

I was really looking forward to a good francaise...and this wasn't it.  The sauce had a nice lemony kick to it, but it was watery and boring, even with the addition of white wine and cornstarch.  The coating on the chicken was VERY BLAND...very.  My boyfriend said that it was "nothing special" and he also rated it a 2 out of 5.  My search for a good francaise continues...

This was great, though I did thicken the sauce separately from the chicken.  I think it tastes better than the restaurant kind, and I used lemon juice from a bottle!

This is to die for.  I made this with corn flake cereal since I didn't have any bread crumbs just put them in the food processor to get that bread crumb consistancy. The only other change I would make next time is not put them in egg. The batter was to thick I'm used to just putting the batter with the wetness of the chicken or can also dip them in half n half or melted butter and the coating will not be as thick.  Just a little suggested,

This was a very good dish. It was quick and easy to make, and tasted very good. I did add some sherry at the very end of cooking time because I can't imagine it not being in this dish. My only complaint was the sauce - it did not thicken, not a bit. It needs some cornstarch desperately. Served over pasta.

We thought this was DELICIOUS! I added extra garlic powder and seasoned salt to the flour mixture. I browned my chicken on both sides and then put it on a cookie sheet in the oven 10-15 mins. until it was cooked through, while I made the sauce in the same pan. I did thicken it a bit w/ a cornstarch slurry b/c it seemed thin to me. Also, I pounded my chicken so it would be thinner and I'm glad I did that. I will def be making this again and again! Thank for sharing. :)

This was pretty good but it needed more flavor! I added about 1 tsp. of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp. paprika + 1 tsp. of kosher salt(it truly needs salt) to the flour mixture. I cut my chicken breasts thin so they would cook evenly and quickly. The sauce is very liquidy, so I'll probably thicken it next time! But other than that it was very good!

This was pretty good, but I'm not sure I'll make it again. I ended up thickening the sauce, because that was so good, and the recipe doesn't say to serve with it at all. I also had some difficulty with the coating staying on, but not as bad as some. I think that this recipe would have worked much better with flattened breasts or cutlets instead of regular boneless/skinless. Being able to make sure the chicken was cooked all the way, while not flipping, and not getting soggy was hard. Thanks for the tasty, if slightly akward dinner.

I've made chicken francaise a couple of times based on recipes I found but is different then this one. I dip the chicken in flour first then egg as it suppose to have a batter effect. When golden brown, I remove and make the sauce with butter, broth, lemon juice and white wine, finish with parsley.

YUM! One breast I did egg-flour-egg-flour and the other I did flour-egg-flour and I think the first one held up the best. I also made the sauce separately and poured over noodles and the chicken when served mainly because my husband doesn't care for sauces on things.

This became one of my favorite recipes. The chicken comes out so tender and tasty - none of my guests could ever have enough of it! I only changed the way of marinating the chicken - dip it in the flour first, egg mixture, and do it again - it comes out crispy and tasteful.

I usually serve it with Penne Rigate or Spaghetti, cooked with some whipping cream, lemon juice, Italian herbs and some salt & pepper.

I would give this 3 1/2 stars if I could...I dregded in flour, egg mixture, then flour...I fried til golden crisp on both sides....I removed then made the sauce. Individually, the chicken and sauce werre very good, but the sauce didn't seem to adhere to the chicken as it does in restaurants...My husband (a huge chicken francaise fan) enjoyed it...Needs some tweaking, but a keeper nonetheless... (If you have fussy kids, keep their chicken out of the sauce, and suggest it to them as a dip...)

Delicious and easy! My favorite chicken recipe ever! I baked in oven after removing from pan and making sauce in same saute pan, using Sly510's suggestion (below - thank you!) and adding extra garlic and a dash each of paprika and tumeric. Best ever!!

This was very tasty.  I thickened the sauce up with cornstarch, but I think I added too much.  It is missing something though, instead of ckn broth I'll try it with white wine next time.  Quick & Easy.

Great Recipe very easy.  I have been making it for years with a few more herbs and no sauce.  I just squeeze lemon on the chicken right before I remove it from heat.  I also use oranges or limes for different flavor.  This is a very easy quick recipe that results in a lot of flavor!

This was pretty good.  Only thing I really changed was to dip in flour, then egg, then flour again after reading several reviews.  The lemon flavor was just perfect.  Will make again.

GOOD!! I would start by double battering the breasts. Use margerine instead of butter cause it needs more cooking time than said and the butter to keep it from burning can get excessive. flip every 4 to 5 min. sprinkle with dried parsley for color

Made this last night and was really dissapointed because it looked and sounded good.  Rated only 1 star because it was way too lemony.  Also, recipe required so many adjustments to make it flavorful.

Very nice recipe........only thing I added was a little fresh garlic.....I just like garlic. Not too lemonly just a nice flavor my kids loved this......key to keeping your breading to stay on is not to mess with them too much flip once I used a fork .....my breading stayed on perfect ....I did take all the cutlets out then make the sauce and gently place the cutlets back in the sauce to simmer. Delicious!

The one thing this recipe does do is instruct you to pound the chicken until it is thin.  This makes it much more flavorful!  Having read many of the other reviews, I must say that usually you can use spices to taste so if you think it is bland add more!

We loved this!  The teenagers and preschoolers all liked it.  The chicken was very moist.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The only thing I would maybe change is to thicken the sauce a little as previous reviewers suggested.  The coating won't fall off if you pour the broth mixture around the chicken rather than on top.

I made the following changes.  Removed the chicken after sautéing, then made a roux of one tablespoon butter and one tablespoon flour, then added ½ chicken 
broth and ½ white wine as others have suggested.  The lemon was way too strong for me, but my husband loved it.  Maybe add more garlic and just ½ lemon to the sauce.  But it was very good.  Served with Rice with Herbes de Provence which someone else suggested.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Great flavor, My only changes were to use a non stick skillet with spray and brown the sides then bake in the oven to make a little healthier.

Like previous reviewers I also double dipped the chicken.  I added a bit of dry bread crumbs to the flour, the coating held up well.  Delicious sauce, served over white rice. Yum!

Recipe was bland like others said, it took me a bit but I think I found the answer the saute' sauce needs about 2 tbsp of marg/butter, after heated.  I agree definately use cornstarch for body and white wine for a kick.  Also to stop coating from coming off, Flour-egg-and flour again.  If you egg wash first the chicken becomes too slippery.

Better than some restaurants, especially served over angel hair or linguine. I did add a few dashes of white wine, (ok, maybe a bit more than that,:) during simmering and I thickened it with a bit of cornstarch. My husband was very impressed. I served it with a green salad and a nice white wine. So good! Thanks Paula!

This recipe comes as close as you can get to my favorite restaurant that serves Chicken Francaise.  It is an excellent recipe.  My kids loved it and my husband thinks I am an excellent chef!  Thanks Paula for the recipe.

From the first bite and about every 30 seconds thereafter my husband came saying MMMMM this GOOD!  Over and over.  He's so picky that that is an unbelievable compliment.  He's already asking when I'm going to make it again.  It's so easy too.  The only alteration was that I added a bit of flour to the chicken broth/lemon juice before adding it to the pan so make the broth thicker.  This one's a keeper.

This recipe was great!  I had been searching for a recipe of this for awhile and until I found this website.  This was definitely easy and much tastier than any other one I have tried.  I did add a little more wine but that was due to my own taste.  I will definitely make this again!

My husband said to give this 5 stars, and the flavor was fantastic.  I'm going with 4 though for two reasons-  After letting simmer for 8 mins the sauce reduced so much that there wasn't any to spoon over the chicken and bed of pasta when serving.  Also, I let the coated chicken sit for a while before placing it in the pan so it held beautifully when browning. But when I added the lemon mix to the pan and simmered, the coating didn't hold as well on the bottom of the chicken.  Just a couple of tweaks-  I added white wine to the lemon mixture; and as I had seen on other recipes I dredged the chicken in the flour first, then the egg, then let it sit for 20 mins.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, it was easy and tasty, and we really enjoyed it!

This hit the spot. The sauce was a little thin, I added a little butter and some flour. Also reversed the dredging order, chicken in flour then egg, then into the skillet until golden.

Agree with another reviewer that this needs chicken cutlets instead of breast halves.  This had a good flavor, the lemon flavor was very subtle.  Chicken was tender, but I had to finish in the oven because my 12 inch skillet was not large enough.  I took Baker Bee's suggestion and put the flour mixture in a plastic bag.  That saved a little mess.  Other than that, I followed the recipe pretty closely.  Agree with others that the remaining cooking liquid needs to be addressed somehow in the recipe.

This was wonderful.  Chicken was amazingly tender and tasty.  Served with sauteed zuchini and yellow summer squash and poured a bit of the cooking sauce over that.  Really yummy.  Will make again.

Very good bold lemon flavor. I spice up the coating with cayenne and more garlic. Use a good food mallet to pound out the chicken into thinner pieces.

Loved it but I changed it a little. Cut up chicken breast to 1 inch cubes. Put 1/2 cup flour, garlic powder and paprika in zip lock bag.  Tossed chicken in bag. Then added to egg and lemon juice. Coat quickly and placed in pan with melted butter and olive oil. Separated and cooked til golden brown. Added minced onions 1 Cup Chicken broth and 1/2 cup lemon juice. Simmered for 10 minutes and placed over rice. Great!!!!

This recipe is easy to follow and so delish! Love the lemony taste it really does brighten up the flavors. Just make sure it is not overripe because it will overpower the dish. We usually eat dinner with rice and this one goes well with it. I also substituted garlic salt for the garlic powder just to satisfy my family's "salty" palate. Thanks for sharing!

LOVED this!! I don't know why others had so much trouble keeping the breading on the chicken, but I will jot down some notes on my recipe card w/suggestions on how to keep it altogether in case next time it does not. I was very careful to make sure the flour was a pretty heavy coating (not missing any spots), so maybe that was it? Mine was delicious and I used lf marg substitute. I loved pouring the sauce over the chicken and it reduced to a perfect consistency. I am the only one in my house that would eat this, and I'm glad for that this time! I wll definitely make this again and again and would highly recommend! I served over spaghetti because I didn't have linguine, but would use just about anything!

This was really good, my family enjoyed it. I am going to reduce the lemon juice in the mixture that is poured over since I had to cook my chicken longer since they were thick.

I did use the juices to make a chicken gravy (mixed it with a gravy packet since I was out of bullion) and it was fantastic. I will definitely be making this again.

I made this last night. I'm always hesitant with cooking with chicken breast. This meal was soooo good. This is definitely going on my rotation of food. I made this over rice, I think next time I'll make it over egg noodles.

Like other reviewers suggested, I put the flour before the egg mixture.  I didn't have paprika, so I didn't use any.  Instead of powder garlic, I used fresh garlic.

I made this for my b/f on fathers day. To much of a lemon taste for the kids and I, but my bf enjoyed it. He said it taste almost exactly how it's supposed to taste. He has been asking me to make it for him. I served it on spaghetti.

This chicken was very good; I took the suggestions to coat in flour, then egg, then flour again, and also to add some corn starch to the sauce. Rich and delicious, and very moist chicken.

Very good. Definitely pound out chicken. I rinsed the chicken, floured, egg washed and floured again, then fried in olive oil. Simmered in sauce and breading did not fall off - I think you have to try not move the chicken while it's simmering. Served with buttered and lemoned spaghetti. Husband really liked it too. Also very easy & quick.

I loved this recipe but after reading some reviews, I made a few changes before trying the original version. I used more paprika and garlic powder. I added lemon pepper seasoning and used a little less lemon juice. I have finally found a recipe that totally makes chicken exciting and my husband did not say, "Chicken, again?" but "Can you make this chicken again!?"

I just made this dish tonight and to be quite honest it did not turn out to be the chick fran that I have always loved. It was OK. My husband liked it but I found several changes that could have made it better. First.. you need to butterfly and pound your chicken breast. second.. you need to dip the chick in the flour then the egg then the flour again, then the egg again to get any type of good flakey crust. Third. The sauce was not francaise. It was a buttery mess with no substance or flavor. I will make this again with the above alterations, but as is..It is a no from me.

This recipe is AWESOME!  Thank you so much for posting it.  I didn't have any garlic powder so I just added a scant amount of minced garlic (jarred).  It was so yummy having a more intense garlic flavor to go with the lemon sauce.  Very good.

My boyfriend and I enjoyed this recipe, however I made a few changes to it...Instead of pouring the broth mix over the chicken, I prepared and heated it separately (as a previous reviewer noted) and thickened it with water and flour. I also added more lemon juice and instead of egg-flour, I did flour-egg.  This recipe was pretty good, but could use some further tweaking.

Loved this recipe. I used bottled lemon juice which worked fine. I also added about 3/4 cup of white wine.  I found it a bit over powering and will use less next time.  I added a lot of minced garlic to the sauce and some cream. The flour egg flour dipping method worked great. Kept the chicken in the oven until the sauce and linguini were done then put it back in the sauce for a few minutes.The breading did not fall off. I also added A LOT of paprika, onion and garlic powder to the flour because I find the flour can be overwhelming.

A total no brainer when time is limited. Took me all of 40 mins to prepare, cook, and clean up. Definitely add white wine and allow the sauce to thicken a bit.

This was fabulous!  Great balance of flavors, great texture (I did add a couple teaspoons of flour to the simmering broth and let it go for an additional five minutes to really thicken it), my whole family loved it!  I served it over fettucine and with my asiago asparagus and carrots as a side.  A keeper, for sure.  Thanks for sharing it!

This is not what I expected.  Cooking the flour coated chicken breast in lemon-chicken broth made them soggy.  Flavor was boring.  I will be looking for another recipe for this.

I really liked this but I did make the same changes that everyone else made.  I floured first, then egged, then floured a second time before putting it in the pan.  I also added more lemon juice where ever it called for juice.  I also added white wine to the finishing sauce and left the chicken and sauce seperate until it was time to serve.  Very much like Chicken piccata

i dont know if i did something wrong?  the chicken turned out ok, but got "mushy" after i added the sauce.  i might try it again, and maybe keep the sauce seperate, and add more lemon.  over all i thought this was just OK.

This was really good and simple!  I used a few shakes of garlicSALT, rather then just a pinch of powder.  Make sure the chicken is fairly thin, and be generous with the flour coating.

This recipe is great and very easy.  I added 1/2 juice of lemon to the broth and it tasted great (in addition to the 1 lemon juiced).  I also added capers and 1 small can of sautéed mushrooms but the next time I make this recipe I'll skip the capers because it was too salty for this recipe.  Just be aware that you are going to use a lot of butter when sautéing the chicken because otherwise the flour on the chicken will stick to the pan.  The chicken was soft like butter and you don't even need a knife to cut it.  My fiancé said this was the best meal he has had in a long time.  A++

Tasted fantastic, sauce was a little too watery for my taste, will definately add the white wine for flavor and cornstarch to thicken. Looking foward to trying again.

Add some of the seasoned flour into the olive oil and butter sauce before adding the broth and lemon juice.  Then simmer and serve over angel hair pasta.  Yum.  Next time I'll double the sauce amount.

Delicious! The only changes I made were to add lemon juice (not just real lemon) and garlic cloves.  I had the chicken and sauce over linguini and I think it came out great.  I might try others' suggestion of cornstarch next time to thicken it, and possibly artichoke hearts and/or capers!

Good basic starter.  I added more butter and 1/2 cup of white wine to finish off the sauce.  Served over rice.

The sauce is amazing! I added white wine as other reviewers suggested as well as some extra garlic salt, and lemon pepper. I also added the left over lemon-egg mixture to the broth (I hate to waste that much stuff. It doesn't look fantastic but the taste makes up for that).

This was a great recipe.  Turned out so yummy! First time I tried making chicken francaise.  I did put a little more than a pinch of garlic powder to the flour to add a little  more flavor.  I also dipped the chicken in flour first then egg and then flour again.  It makes for a better coating.  I did not have fresh parsley but dried worked great when I added it to the broth. I also removed the chicken from the pan and then continued to make a rue for the chicken broth with butter and flour.  I then plated the chicken and poured the gravy over it. It was yummy!!!

This is really a tasty dish. I followed the directions exactly except I seasoned my chicken and flour with salt and pepper in addition to the garlic and paprika called for.  Amazingly I did not lose my coating when I poured the broth mixture over it all. If I had read the reviews I may have done it differently but in this case ignorance was bliss.  The only problem I have is that the sauce is so thin. Next time I will thicken it with cornstarch or flour. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.

We make this all the time, at least once a month.  I used this recipe instead of my old one, fresh paprika adds to the dish and using fresh lemon as well.

part of my Mother's Day menu and tasted great! I didn't brown the chicken enough so it looked a little light, but was well cooked very tasty...i thought the broth was good but not thick enough...took leftovers & added more broth & thickening, now got gravy for leftovers...oh yeah, used chicken tenders too instead of split breasts.  Yummo!

I usually pound breasts thin and dredge in flour then egg to fry. Also I use butter and lemon vs broth. Lemmony and buttery.

This was pretty good. It was rather easy to make to. I only had 1lb or 3 chicken breasts, so I halved the rest of the ingredients. That made it very easy, because I could fit it all in one pan. For the flour mixture I just put it in a 1 gal. twist tie bag, making clean-up easy to. I like how it had flavor, but it wasn't swimming in butter or cream. That made it seem much more healthy to me. The only change, I might make the next time is to flatten the chicken breasts out some. Mine were pretty thick and it took 8 minutes to cook each side on medium as suggested. Plus, the coating will cover more surface area. I did strain the sauce before plating it. It made it thinner, but it didn't have the flour bits in it. ty

I was pleasantly surprised by how flavourful this dish is. The lemon in the egg and the chicken broth gave this dish a delightful taste. The only changes I made to this recipe is using chicken tenderloins and rice flour instead. The rice flour seemed to stick to the chicken much better than the all-purpose flour. Definitely a keeper.

Tried this for the first time tonight, rave reviews.  I used a little more butter than it called for to cook the chicken in and used boneless, skinless chicken Thighs instead of breasts.  They were easier to fry and moister than the breasts.  A keeper for sure...

I thought it was very good.  My boyfriend wants it rated "excellent".  I pounded the chicken breasts, added more butter to fry the breasts used less chicken broth than called for and added some white wine.  It was very, very good.  We will be enjoying this recipe again.

Awesome!  My husband works nights and was sleeping while I was cooking this...he wasn't sleeping for long!!  Added spices to the flour and also thickened the gravy before adding to the chicken.  The bottom crust did seperate from the chicken, but was still very good!  Will definetly make this again!

Tasted great!  My method was different but kept the ingredients the same.  Maybe add a little more lemon juice to taste.  Also very good if u deglaze the pan after cooking chicken with white wine.

This was surprisingly bland, and tasted more like a poached chicken. Some salt helped. If I make this again, I will cook the chicken separately until done, and cook down the broth and lemon juice in a sauce pan until it becomes thick, then spoon it over the chicken when ready to serve.

I added WAY more paprika and garlic, a teaspoon each, and still find this bland, and a touch too lemony. I served over pasta cooked in chicken broth. Sure looks nice!

Yumm! This turned out really well, and I served it with fine egg noodles & fresh steamed French (but of course!) green beans. The sauce was good with all of it. Thanks!

Decent.  I definitely recommend dredging in flour, then the egg mixture, then the flour again.

The recipe is really good and simple besides getting your fingers messy! I coat the chicken in flour mizture, then egg, then back to flour. I needed a little more butter to cook the chicken in then what it called for. After finishing the recipe I had some sauce still left on the bottom which I added some white wine and more flour, whisked over high heat and poured over the chicken.

Yummy!!  I used chicken tenders, which I put in a ziploc bag with the flour mixture, then coated in the egg mixture and panfried.  When golden, I kept them warm in the oven and made the sauce in the same frying pan.  My children loved the chicken as it was (no extra sauce). My husband and I had the chicken and sauce over linguine.  Very tender and tasty.  Fabulous!

Very yummy, easy recipe. I followed the advice of other users and put the chicken in the breadcrumbs before the egg. The sauce was too thin for my taste; I will thicken more next time. I also added more lemon.

This recipe is exactly like they serve in the Italian place in my town.  I make sure to highly season my flour mixture, tasting as I go.  As listed, it can be a little bland.  I use thin & fancy cut chicken breasts.  I add some zest to the broth/lemon mixture, and when I simmer it all together add three or so lemon slices then.  This makes it so lemony and good.  The "soggy" coating is so delicious.  We serve over thick spaghetti and enjoy it every time!  So good I can't believe I'm making it at home.

This is my fiance's favorite dish at a restaurant, so he has been begging me to make it. We both made it together and found that this dish is definitely not an easy dish to make. I am rating it 3 because I think you have to do some changes in order for it to be good. We took the advice of other reviews and did the flour-egg-flour-egg. We pounded it very very thin because that is how you get it at a restaurant. There was not enough sauce for the chicken and the angel hair so next time I would probably triple the sauce amount. The dish is suppose to be somewhat soggy so we did simmer the chicken in the sauce mixture for 8 minutes. I also added lots of garlic. I will definitely make again and just continue to tweak it.

I'm not sure what I think about this....it was kinda weird.  You cannot eat too much of it because it is very rich.  It makes a lot, that's okay it just didn't get ate at our house as leftovers.  I think it just didn't suit our tastes.  Seemed like a waste of chicken.

THE FLAVORS OF THIS RECIPE ARE NOT THE BEST, BUT YOU CAN MAKE IT BETTER IF YOU ADD A FEW OTHER THINGS. I ADD POWDER GARLIC, PEPPER, AND ADOBO TO THE FLOUR BEFORE COATING CHICKEN---THEN I FRY THE CHICKEN IN OLIVE OIL. IN THE SAME PAN I USE THE BROTH TO REMOVE THE BITS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN, ADD BUTTER LEMON JUICE. AND THE THICKENER IS FLOUR TO MAKE IT A FLAVORFULL AND THICK SAUCE. ALSO I USE LOTS OF LEMON SLICES IN THE SAUCE AND COOK IT FOR 2 MIN, NOT LONGER BECAUSE IT CAN MAKE THE LEMON TASTE BITTER. ENJOY!

This was very good.  I seasoned the chicken with a little lemon pepper, then the flour/egg/flour.  Didn't cook mine in the sauce as I wanted the breading crispy.  Added some half and half to the sauce to make it creamier.  Served over bow-tie pasta.  Will make again.

My family loved this recipe. The chicken had just enough lemon but the sauce had a little too much so next time I will only put in half as much. I also added a bit more garlic and paprika. To make sure the chicken doesn't become soggy remove it from the pan and keep warm then make the sauce separately, also you can thicken the sauce by taking a tsp of flour or cornstarch and mix it in a little spare broth then poor into sauce let it simmer for about 5 minutes or until thick. Oh yeah and to make sure the chicken coating stays on while cooking double dip it.

Pretty good, didn't have garlic powder so I added 1 clove minced garlic when I added the broth (w/ a little flour added for thickness). I wish I would have added more garlic as this was a little bland. Nonethless, good. Thank you.

I made this tonight with several substitutions (only because I didn't have some ingredients on hand!) I used lime juice instead of lemon, and olive oil in place of butter. I also followed other reviewers and added white wine to the broth and a little more garlic. YUMMY! WIll make again for sure!

This recipe offers a good base but I needed a little more zest and so I added more lemon juice and minced garlic about 5 minutes prior to it being completly cooked.. I also like a thicker sauce.

Perfect!  This was, by far, the best recipe I've found in a while.  I pounded chicken first then coated w/flour, egg dipped, then floured again, coating stayed on just fine.  (the first time I made this I forgot to put the lemon juice in w/the egg, but it didn't matter) Very tasty.  My husband loved this also.  He will eat pretty much anything I make, but when he compliments me, I know it must be good.  Will and have made again.

This was the easiest dish I probably have ever prepared.  From start to finish you can have dinner within 45 minutes.  My family is picky and I finally found something that everyone likes.  
If you want to dress it up a bit add steam broccoli topped with thin sliced ham cut into stirps and mozzerella cheese!

Really good! Added some sherry cooking wine (1/4 cup) and also some lime juice (1/4 of one fruit for 2 chicken breasts) and cooked for about 15 minutes due to meat thickness.

Made this a couple weeks ago for dinner. It was ok, not quite what I was looking for. The breading seemed a little wierd once it was fully cooked. Kids seemed to like it though and didn't complain.

Excellent!  I was afraid the lemon would be too tart, but it was very subtle and nice.  Followed the recipe exactly, except sprinkled a little poultry seasoning over the chicken as it was frying and added a little olive oil to the butter.  Probably let it simmer a little longer than called for, just to be sure the chicken was done.  Sauce thickened up nicely and all was delicious.

I took the advice of some reviewers and dipped the chicken in flour, then egg, then flour again.  I only used 1/2 cup chicken broth and I added 1/2 cup white wine and thickened the mixture with cornstarch.  I also used bottled lemon juice because I didn't have fresh lemons.  Because other reviewers said the chicken was soggy, I only let it simmer for a couple of minutes -- just enough to heat the lemon sauce.  This turned out great and I will be making it again.

The chicken was fantastic, a big hit with everyone. The sauce was vile and luckily I made it seperate from the chicken so I threw it away and it spoil the rest of the meal. Dont know what I did wrong but it was so bad!

I made this recipe for my family and did not have a drop left.  I used the thin cut chicken breasts, which I think work better though.  My kids were very disappointed that I didn't have any leftovers, so this is definitely a 'keeper'

First I make only two servings, I also egg flour egg dip, but I use egg beaters, and olive oil to sautee and I then add more lemon juice to the pan and I use a butter substitute, and I search with non sauced pasta..  I use this same recipe for veal pounded just as thin between two pieces of plastic wrap, as I pound the chicken with.  I use one breast and cut four thin cutlets and pound for chicken.

I do not mix in separate bowl, and I do not use chicken broth, I put the lemon juice right in the pan I've browned in and throw in a couple capers and some pinch of kind of butter substitute and plop the cutletes right back in the pan.

This, pasta, some steamed asparagus and you've got a meal you find in the finest restaurants and it's healhty to boot.   As a diabetic, I have to adjust everything, but it's worth the effort on this one.

This was awesome!!!  My fiance thought it would be too lemony, but everything balances out just right.  I've never had Chicken Francais before, so don't have anything to compare this to, but it is definately something I will be making again.  The only thing I might do differently next time is what other reviewers did and thicken the sauce.  Thanks for sharing this delicious easy recipe!!!

I don't know what I did, but this didn't turn out how I expected.  Not much taste and the chicken didn't hold any of the lemon flavor or wine that I added.  I tend to think I did something different, but I doubt I will try it again, although it was very easy

Good overall --  I added white wine and cornstarch to the sauce and it was still a little watery.  Served this over linguine with roasted cherry tomatoes.  Nice weekday meal.

This was delicious.  Restaurant quality in easy steps at home.  I added white wine to the broth/lemon juice mixture, and a little flour to thicken the sauce. I added a little of this to the butter while cooking the breasts, and then added all the breasts at the end with the remaining liquid.  Spooned over pasta, and garnished with the fresh parsley...a winner!

Paula this recipe was the best!!
just a suggestion-- out of the chicken broth should a light gravy be made to drizzle over the finished francaise. My picky husband and kids loved it. Definatly a KEEPER!!!

I did not have canned chicken broth, so I used boullion and water. Also, I thickened the sauce by adding a little corn starch to the broth/boullion mixture before adding it to the chicken. Served over Lemon Pepper Angel Hair pasta it was delicious! It was a hit with my husband and my teenagers.  I made extra and the leftovers tasted great also.

Great recipe!  I pounded the chicken breasts down for extra tenderness and then added capers to the sauce.  I thickened the sauce but I don't think that I will do that the next time.  Very easy recipe and great served with pasta.

Easy to make since I had all the ingredients on hand. I like extra lemon flavor on everything, so I first let the chicken soak in lemon juice for about 20 minutes in the fridge while I prepped the rest of dinner. Added some extra salt and pepper into the dry mix (since reviews stated this being bland). Followed advice to only flip the chicken once so the breading wouldn't come off and it was a success! Thought the flavor turned out well. Served with some butter linguini and green beans. Got the thumbs up from the husband and the "its o-k" from the kids....Can't win them all! haha

Really good. My modification was doubling the lemon juice in both the egg wash and the finishing sauce. I also doubled the coating mix but wound up with extra. I added more than a pinch of garlic powder, about 1/2 tsp, and a pinch of onion powder. Flavor was excellent, chicken was tender.

This dish came out great!  The only thing I did differently was accidentally added too much paprika to the flour and made the sauce separate and poured it on top the chicken before serving.  For the sauce (roux) I used 3 tbsp flour ( with a dash of garlic powder & paprika) into 3 tbsp of melted butter over medium heat and whisked in the chicken broth with lemon juice (as recipe suggested) after one minute and simmered until thickened- whisking constantly.

The proportions for this recipe we’re WAY off. I needed to use two pans to fit my “6 boneless skinless chicken breast halves” and almost a whole pound of butter (much more than the 2 TBSP the recipe claims). The end of the recipe has you simmering your chicken broth/lemon juice mixture with the chicken in the pan but it doesn’t all fit. And I have an extra large pan. I made it work, by whipping out another pan, but I don’t recommend this recipe of chicken francaise if you’re just starting out. I also had to add more seasonings and lemon to taste. It was bland without me doing so.

The breading for once stayed on the chicken which meant success.  However, I should have added more spices like some reviewers suggested.  I liked it, but my husband is not big on lemon flavor so he didn’t care for it that much.

Followed directions, but made additional sauce with roux, drippings, chic stock, lemon and touch of wine. Also added a bit of garlic salt. Excellent.

I made the recipe exactly as written, and it was too lemony for my family's taste. The sauce was thin and bland. Had really high hopes for this recipe based on the reviews, but was pretty disappointed... if I attempted it again, I would salt, pepper and garlic powder the cutlets before dredging, and instead of simmering the cutlets in the broth I would plate them and simmer the sauce with flour left over from dredging to thicken it up. Maybe add some white wine. Then add the cutlets back to the sauce for a few  minutes to warm them up. Thanks anyway!

Delicious.  I love French cooking.  Simple, but elegant ingredients with good execution = one heck of a dinner.  I served with a green salad.  The trick to this recipe is finding chicken breast halves that are small enough to cook through in the 8 minutes.

EXCELLENT. Easy enough for week nights but nice enough for company.  Served mine with a side of Angel hair pasta with mushrooms and artichoke hearts, and a light spinach salad.

I really liked this recipe and so did my kids. Like others suggested i may let the chicken soak a while in the egg and lemon mixture and add cornstarch to the broth to thicken. I served with broccoli and pasta. it was delicious.

Wonderful recipe.  Easy too.  The only change I made was to add some lemon zest to the sauce.  (Why let a good lemon peel go to waste!)
I served this with brown rice (to soak up the "gravy")  Delicious.

This is now a family favorite.  I've made it twice and the second time was better.  As others have said, this recipe works best if you dip in flour first, then egg, then flour again.  I took 10 minutes and put the chicken in the freezer to ensure the breading did not come off.  I also put a whole lemon in the egg mixture but I love lemony chicken!  Awesome, very easy recipe!  Thank you!

I've made this twice now.  Both times it took much longer to cook because the chicken breasts I used were so thick I suppose, but was definitely worth the wait - it's a new favorite.

I made some alterations based on quantity and tasting. 1 egg was no way near enough for 5 large boneless breasts. 2 eggs did it with no room to spare. Same for the flour, easily 2 cups. 
I used a lot more than a “pinch” of garlic powder, paprika and black pepper (I’d guess a tablespoon of GP and paprika, 10 twists of black pepper.
After tasting the sauce, I added 2 capfuls of lemon juice. As thin as the sauce was, I mixed in a can of cream of mushroom soup. 
It was served with pasta and was a huge hit! 
Great base recipe, but tweeks were definitely a necessity.

I found this to be a very easy to make rendition of one of my favorites. I have never made this with the egg and lemon being mixed together and I think that alone makes this better than most recipes I have tried. You really get lemon on multiple levels and it adds to the depth of flavor. I tried flour-egg-flour and did not notice any significant difference in those pieces versus the pieces that just went into the egg and then flour. It could have something to do with the heat or amount of butter in pan or something...I usually dredge in flour first myself, but I wanted to follow the recipe so I split it up. I also found that I had ample sauce to pour over my pasta and chicken when plated which is usually an issue with a lot of recipes.

I've made this dish different ways over the years and never loved any of them. This came closer but still not perfect. I followed advice and used more garlic powder and paprika but still could have used a little more. I also used capers and felt they added something also. I also thickened sauce at end with a little cornstarch. All in all I liked it a lot and will definitely make again.(Oh yeah I also went flour, egg, flour and it browned nicely and stayed on the chicken!)

This was great! Followed recipe, and made sure to let sauce reduce. It looks too watery when you first start the simmer, but I let it reduce for a little more than 8 minutes and it was great.  Concentrated down to a creamy sauce. Definitely going into our chicken rotation!

I made this tonight for myself and my husband who prefers only dark meat chicken.  I did min just the opposite - dipped paper-towel-dried chicken breasts in egg, then seasoned flour (granulated garlic, paprika and Himalayan pink salt), then egg again.  I fried them in avocado oil with a little ghee added for extra flavor.  Cooked 4 minutes each side on medium-high heat, turning only once.  They browned perfectly -  just enough so I knew they were ready. 
I transferred them to a Corning Ware  baking dish and popped them, covered, into a warm (350°) oven while I made the sauce.  I used Better than Bouillon chicken flavor, added lemon juice and simmered it a few minutes to let it reduce, then poured it over the chicken and returned to the oven for a few minutes, covered, while I prepared the rest of the meal.  I served it over a bed of steamed organic spinach and it was a hit.  My husband even had seconds.

I tried to make it exactly as written so that when I review it, it's based on the actual recipe provided. I'm not sure if my chicken breasts were just way huger than what the recipe intended because I could only fit 3 in my skillet. Also, I had to cook the chicken for at least 20 minutes longer. It turned out tasty, but if I make it again, I will follow the recommendations of the other reviewers and add more seasonings (or at least much more of the seasonings listed) and use smaller and thinner pieces of chicken. It was pretty bland, but enjoyable enough.

i would definitely use  again. The more you make it the easier it is to follow it.  I also like that you can add herbs to your liking-at least I did.
I addr a little more lemon to the sauce-because I love it more tart and added turmeric to the flour mixture to give it more color and to incorporate it.

As others have noted, francaise is traditionally dredged in flour and then dipped into the egg. Also, it is a much better end result if you cook the chicken first, and then keep it warm in the oven while making the sauce, so that the chicken remains crisp. Lastly, you are going to need a thickening agent for the sauce, otherwise you are just going to have a pan full of lemon chicken broth. My advice is to doctor this recipe, or find another to try.

I love chicken Fran  but do yourself a favor and don't follow this. Skip the egg as it just makes for a sloppy dish. Instead pound out the chicken and put it into a bowl with 2 lemons that have been juiced. Let sit for 5 min, dredge in seasoned flour and brown. Deglaze the pan when chicken is done with 6oz chicken broth and the lemon juice. Make a rue with butter and flour and thicken sauce. Return chicken and simmer on low for 5 mins. This is how I was taught in the restaurants, these folks have their own way which is  poor at best.

I followed others advice by dipping in flour then egg then flower and also heating pan prior to adding butter.  The coating was fine until I added the liquid, then it came off a bit, all and all the flavor was bland, missing something.

I gave it four stars, because like other posters said I had to tweak the recipe. I did what another poster said and dipped in the flour, then egg, then flour again. Also I took the chicken out of the pan before adding the soup and lemon. It came out awesome!  I love this site, I have found so many amazing  recipes

I will definitely make this again.  I read several reviews before I prepared it, so I did marinate the chicken first in garlic, lemon juice, a splash of white wine and oil.  I also did the flour-dip-flour again method.  I will brown and bake the next time .. .then serve with the sauce .  I added some lemon zest and fresh parsley to the sauce before serving.   I served it with egg noodles, which was good, but I think it would be perfect over a bed of fettuccine .

I will definitely make this again, we all loved it. I did add capers, but other than that followed recipe exactly.  Next time, I am going to try to bake the cutlets in the oven, then add the sauce on top to see if that will work for a crowd.  (hard to fry 5 lbs of chicken cutlets!)  Also, will add some thickener to the lemon and broth mixture.

This was beautiful! Quick and easy, I made it during my last break of the work day. I didn't have chicken broth so I substituted Heinz Turkey gravy. Added some lemon juice and butter to it. Also used two eggs instead of 1 for a thicker bread coating. I could definitely serve this for a formal dinner and will be making it again! I started with 8 chicken tenders but it went so fast I was only able to photographer 2.

I didn't have lemon juice so I substituted pineapple juice which worked just fine!  I also added a little extra cayenne and a little bit of other seasoning  which was just perfect. Served over Jasmin Rice and also a Greek salad.  Perfecto.  So yummy!

I made this tonight....the taste was good but the chicken was not tender. I felt like I should have pounded it. The cutlets were thin. I used a very large juicy lemon for the sauce (called for the juice of one whole lemon)...I felt it was way too lemony and maybe 1/2 the lemon would have been better. I also put the chicken into a ceramic pan and put it into the oven for 30 min. at 350 degrees which is what I do with all the chicken and pork I make...that usually tenderizes it. It didn't work this time. Idk if I would make this again.

I will definitely make this again!  I made a couple of minor changes to this recipe. Everybody I shared it with, wants me to make it again soon. I've been looking for this recipe forever,  but couldn't remember the name of the chicken dish I ate out of state, many years ago.  Thank you very much for Sharing  this recipe.

I made this for the  first time last night and loved it.  The only change I made was to thicken the broth/lemon mix by adding 2 TBS of melted butter and 2 TBS of flour.  I let it simmer longer than the time suggested, and the sauce thickened beautifully.  I will definitely make this again.

'Going along with most reviews:  Bland, but good - eventhough I upped spice in the flour.  As for the sauce, maybe I just like lemon-butter sauce as compared to a chicken broth-based sauce for this.  I added a lemon & a half of juice to it & it still wasn't all that obvious.  I wouldn't like it to scream "lemon," but it was more like chicken gravy (thickened with cornstarch).  The flour then egg than flour tip is a great one.  I'll have to remember that.  :)

Just made it for the first time. Excellent. I did not have any problem with the cooked chicken holding it's floured skin, after adding the broth. I think maybe the success with that came from a previous reviewer. She stated she let the dredged chicken set for a good 20 minutes plus before cooking. I had a beautiful crust that the broth could not penetrate. I did not double dredge. No need. I did add a bit more seasonings to our taste. Very, very good!

I was nervous about my really thick chicken breasts cooking all the way through, but they came out great! The sauce was very thin, and I do love sauce, so I might try adding some flour to thicken it up a tad next time. But good! I'll be making this again.

Loved this.  I read some other reviews so I added a little more paprika and garlic and some shredded parmesan.  Then I dipped the chicken in egg/flour/egg/flour.  When I was done cooking all the chicken, I cleaned the pan with a paper towel, put fresh butter in, added some broth and put the chicken on top and let it simmer for 5 minutes.  Then I spooned a little broth over the top of the chicken and let it finish simmering.  I made this with penne pasta and just added some of the broth to the penne. Very yummy.

I followed the recipe to the letter in spices and it needed a little more for my taste the lemon flavor was a bit too delicate but not bland at all. My family love it. I also floured the chicken first and then egg and then flour again. After reading many reviews I opted to keep the gravy separate. But overall I think its a great recipe. Especially since I'm a ok cook. It was easy and yummy.

This recipe was OK at best. I took the suggestions of some of the other reviews and did the flour first then the egg and took the chicken out, then made the sauce, added a splash of wine and added flour to thicken it. I also put some parmesan cheese in the egg mixture and added adobo for added flavor. I will make this again but will tweak a little more to suit my tastes.

Lemony and melts in mouth.  I did as directed, and the coating did not come off.  Cooked two breasts at a time, then added all, layered and just squeezed the other half of lemon, and an 8 oz. of chicken broth, covered and let simmer on low for 8 mts.  WONDERFUL.

We love this dish and make it all the time. Quick, easy and we often just use bottled lemon juice instead of fresh, although I do prefer the latter. Try it tonight, you won't be disappointed!

Was a 5 star dish after I followed some of the hints.  I did not cook in the sauce, but topped it with the thickened sauce when I plated it.  Will definitely make again...and again...and again...DELICIOUS!!

I have made this twice and haven't changed a thing either time.  We really like it but I can't give it a 5.  The breading comes off when you add the liquid and continue cooking.  This might not happen if you removed the meat once done cooking then cook the sauce in the pan separtely.  I may try that next time.  We love the lemon in the egg wash.

I add a little white wine and the juice of an additional; lemon to this recipe to add even more lemon flavor, as well increase the volume of the sauce. This sometimes means I have to add a little more flour to thicken the sauce a bit. It is wonderful served with spaghetti noodles.

Its a good base. However I've ALWAYS dipped it in the flour before the egg. I've used this with recipe with shrimp & fish. But I'll use white cooking wine instead of broth. Tasty.

I altered it similarly to how some others did on this page (I marinated in lemon, I served w/angel hair pasta and i did a sauce of 1/2 broth, 1/2 white wine) in addition I added honey because I like it to be a little sweet. It came out very good, but my husband said it was too lemony. I gave it a 5 star because had i not marinated it in lemon, it would not have been so lemony

I loved this recipe. My dad was on a perpetual quest to find a really good Francaise recipe, and I think I just found it right here.  Delicious.  I poured the reduced broth/lemon out of the pan into a gravy boat before arranging the chicken on the serving plate and then lightly drizzled some over it before serving.  I sprinkled a little salt before serving, as well.  Very, very tasty.

My first time attempting to ever make Chicken Francaise.  This was a very good and very easy receipe to follow.
I didn't have paprika but will use it next time for a little more flavor.  I also sliced the lemon and let it simmer with the chicken, came out very good!  I'll make it again, but will try the flour-egg instead of egg-flour next time too. Thanks for sharing, I will definitly make it again and again!

We were very happy with this recipe, even though I left out the chicken broth.  I compensated for it by adding a light sprinkling of salt.  Made a nice, light meal.

I found it boring.  I double coated the chicken (and included lemon pepper seasoning), sauteed it up, put it in a 9x13 and finished off by baking.  Made the sauce, let it reduce, poured it over the chicken and baked a little longer.  Not enough flavor for me.  I will try to tweak it!

Very bland.  Noone really liked it, the left overs were fine for another dish.

Sorry, didn't care for it.  It wasn't *bad* but for the effort involved not worth it.  My husband, who likes almost everything, thought it was pretty good but not great.  None of the kids liked it.  One liked the chicken without sauce.  I should note none of us have ever had Chicken Francaise before so perhaps we  simply don't care for the dish in general.

Very good interplay of flavors!  Like the reviewer before me, after cooking the chicken, I put it on a plate and finished the sauce separately, and like LadyJayPee, I added subbed in part white wine, which added a nice note of sophistication.  Thank you LadyJayPee for the hint!

After cooking the chicken I removed it from skillet to keep warm in the oven whilst I made the sauce (didn't want chicken to go soggy)  I added a little cream to the reduced  sauce just prior to serving.  Husband& I loved it, fussy daughter didn't.  Will make again.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I thought the taste of the chicken was very good.  However, I only gave it 4 stars because the breading didn't stick as well as I had hoped.

I made this for a family home dinner. Everyone loves lemon and my husband even asked me to make it 'extra lemoney' It sounded as if there was already plenty of lemon so I didn't make adjust the lemon at all. I did add a bit of seasoning salt to the flour for breading the chicken. I doubled the lemon and chicken broth 'sauce' and after cooking, then thickened it with a bit of cornstarch in water. It made a lovely gravy that was absolutely delicious both on the chicken and on the side rice dish I made to go with it.
A big hit!

Without some wine, this just doesn't taste like Francaise to me.  So I added some and it was pretty good.

Recipe as is is pretty good, but defnitely missing something. I used less chicken broth and added a little bit of sugar to the flour, decided that a sweet-tangy citrus sauce or glaze would really give this chicken what it needs.

This was just okay. Sounds better than it actually tastes. Mine turned out just fine in terms of not messy and holding the flour/egg mixture but the taste was just not that impressive. If I try this one again, I will add some spices for some more kick.

This was our first time making chicken like this, and it came off without a hitch!  Next time, we'll fillet the breasts to make it even more delectable.

A pinch of garlic and paprika -- I like more spice than that.  Plus, where's the salt and pepper?!?  This recipe is good, if you juice it up a little.  Follow the other reccomendations and this recipe is great!

My family and I loved this recipe, and it was very easy and quick to make.  I followed some suggestions from others; I added about 1/4 cup white wine and about 1 tbsp cornstarch to the sauce.  Also, I egg-flour-egg dipped my chicken.  I started using chicken tenders and they were perfect sizes for my children (plus, they're a little cheaper).  I will definitely make this dish over and over! Great recipe!

This was a very simple recipe that tastes really good, I took a little bit of the flour left over and mixed it with water to make the sauce a little thicker.  My chicken also wasn't cooked all the way, but I micro. it for 1 min. and it was fine.

It wasn't bad...but wasn't great.  It tasted more like chicken in chicken broth...needs more lemon or other juices to give it more taste.

We thought this was very good. Loved the lemon flavor. Added a little white wine. Also added 1 tbsp capers (we love them). One of the better francaise recipes.
