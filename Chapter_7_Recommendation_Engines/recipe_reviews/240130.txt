A little spicy but very good.  I halved the recipe because I'm the only one in the house that will eat salmon and I love it.  Needed some tartar sauce to tame the spiciness.  I'll be reducing the black pepper and Old Bay next time because I like my salmon patties a little milder.  Nice recipe though and will most likely make again.  Thanks Judiebug!

I followed this recipe exactly and it was perfect, so delicious!  I've made salmon cakes from several recipes over the years, but this was by far the best.  Thanks for presenting it.  Why do people such as Leah rate a recipe she has never tried?  Ridiculous!  She should just have presented a new recipe. I like to read reviews before I try a new recipe, but not from someone who has never tried it.  Waste of time.

This is an old family favorite. My mom used crushed soda crackers in place of the panko, but both ways are yummy.

Found these today and decided to make them for lunch.  These were delicious and I will definitely make again, but add butter to the olive oil for a little crisper cake.  We do like a little crunch!  Great flavor though.  Thank you judiebug

Awesome recipe, just as written.
 * For the lady who can't use eggs, try some vegetable oil to replaces moisture and a bit of cornstarch or flour to replace the glue of the egg.
*  For a yummy dip I simply mix some Mayo with some curry powder, adjust to suit your own personal taste, we like lots. Can be made ahead and left to marry, which increases the flavour and you don't need too much curry powder, (use more if eating without ripening)

I've been making different variations of this for years! My husband and I both love them. I often add a little butter to the skillet, and sub coconut oil for the evo.

For those who are looking for a sauce to go with the salmon cakes, type in salmon cakes with sauce. There are a variety of different sauces like dill and lemon listed on AllRecipes. Hope it helps!

I saw this recipe and thought "this is too much stuff for salmon cakes"!!! My normal recipe just doesn't have this combo, but I decided to try it anyway.  We had this tonight for dinner and I didn't tell my husband it was a new recipe...as soon as my husband tasted them he said it was so good and could tell it had something different too it!!! This is such a nice change than the basic recipe I cook and will definitely fix this again.  Using the panko bread crumbs made them hold form better while frying.

Great recipe. Baked instead of frying. 375 degrees-- 18 mins on one side then another 8 mins once flipped. Used what I had..white onion instead of green...it still worked.

I have not tried this but would like to know the recipe for the dipping sauce.  If you submit a recipe please include all items in photo. Except for the lemon and parsley of course.  But I will definitely try it.

Scrumptious Salmon Cakes Haiku: "Close as I could get, had to make some little swaps, still they were quite good." Subbed a couple tsp. of dry parsley for fresh, and lite Duke's mayonnaise for Miracle Whip, otherwise, did every other ingredient as directed. I found that there were too many unnecessary ingredients competing w/ one another in the salmon patties, and that sometimes less is more. That's not to say that these didn't taste good, but I actually was less thrilled w/ the texture - very poofy and squishy on the inside, but well-browned and crispy on the exterior, making me think that I should've made 10 or even 12 smaller patties instead of 8 large. I think if I made this recipe again, I'd do just that, along w/ using plain panko instead of Italian-seasoned, and drop the dijon mustard and/or parmesan - Old Bay is flavorful enough. Thanks Judiebug - salmon patties w/ mac n'cheese on the side is one of our favorite Spring comfort meals!

Excellent recipe~sub'd panko with saltines
dipping sauce appears to be basic tartar sauce, which I used along with basic lemon and parsley.  Of course there are other seafood dipping sauces on this site

The ratings for this recipe did not disappoint. I substituted red onions for green onions and it turned out just fine. I also cooked the cakes in coconut oil rather than olive oil. Probably the best salmon cakes I have ever eaten.

This is a very good recipe.  I made it just as written, only I halved the recipe.  It made 6 good size patties which is 2 meals for my husband and me.  It seemed a bit too salty so I will add less Old Bay next time.  Thank you for this recipe. I will be using it a lot. I might try it with albacore tuna instead of salmon.

I'm trying this tonight because the recipe just improves on the one my Mom always used.  Growing up, Salmon Patties and Creamed Peas was the "comfort food" of choice (right up there with Macaroni & Cheese).

I made these tonight with salmon we caught in Alaska, which I baked first for 20 minutes and then cooled and flaked. Can't speak to using canned salmon. Everything else I followed to a tee. These were superb! Spices were just right for us. Fresh parsley (flat Italian parsley, NOT curly parsley!) contributes to a lot of the flavor, so don't use dried parsley. We will be having these often. I don't see why these can't be broiled instead of sauteeing.

These salmon cakes were delicious and very easy to make. I did roll the cakes in Panko crumbs before cooking them in the olive oil, this made a nice crust on the salmon cakes.

I love salmon so even the simple salmon cakes we had growing up were delicious to me.  Since we couldn't eat meat on Fridays, we had them every so often.  They were just made with crushed saltine crackers, eggs and salt & pepper.  This recipe knocked that one out of the park!  Made as directed except for halving the recipe since it was just for my husband & me.  Didn't have Old Bay Seasoning on hand so looked up a recipe for it and used that.  Loved the Panko instead of crackers or bread crumbs.  This is my official salmon cake recipe from now on.  Fast and super delicious.

Haven't tried this yet but intend to do so soon! For an eggless recipe, try the usual gluten free egg substitute used in many recipes which is 1 T. flax (or chia seed) meal mixed with 3 T hot water. Let this sit until it looks gluey and is cool. I will use my usual substitute for bread crumbs or panko: crushed rice krispy or chex cereal with crispy corn chex. I add dried Italian herbs and "shaker style" parmesan cheese to the crushed cereal and have some ready at all times to coat chicken, pork or fish before frying or baking. If you want to bake with it, coat meat with dry mixture then drizzle with some olive or avocado oil to make a crispy coat. Otherwise, coat meat with dry mixture and then fry in oil.
I'm looking forward to tasting these salmon cakes already!

I made this exactly as written.  The flavor of the salmon was overwhelmed by the excessive amounts of Worcester sauce and Dijon mustard.  If I make this again, I will cut those ingredients by half or more.

Real good patties. I thought there was going to be to much onion in them and  I like onion but it was the perfect amount. I served it with tarter sauce on the side. I will be making these again.

Everyone loved these salmon cakes and I would definitely make again.  I thought they were just a little peppery, so next time I would use less pepper, but my family thought they were great as is.  I followed the recipe to a t.   My husband said these are better then the one I used to make.  I do think that it is very important to let the mixture sit for 20 minutes  in the frig b4 frying or baking.  I did bake some and fry some everyone preferred the fried.

I love recipes where I already have most of the ingredients. These were absolutely easy to prepare and my boyfriend says it tastes better than his mom's! Just make sure u have a great nonstick pan, even with the olive oil

I cut this recipe out of the Allrecipes magazine, and when I came here, I realized that the proportions of ingredients are a little different online. I'm reviewing the online recipe because I thought the one from the magazine needed more spices. As written online, the recipe is delicious- and I'm not even a fan of canned salmon. This might be the first time I've eaten it. I made it for my husband but I really enjoyed it as well. This recipe is easy to cut in half. The cakes were easy to work with and fried up beautifully. I will make these again.

I made this recipe and I doubt I will ever use another recipe again.  I did make some revisions due to the fact that I did not have a few items.  I used  homemade bread crumbs, I left out the cheese, and I used regular yellow mustard. Again I didn't have the items called for in the recipe.  It still produced great results.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made these last night, and they were wonderful!! Didn't change a thing. I made 4 patties since I halved the recipe, which means we get the other 2 tonight!! Thanks for this recipe. I followed another reviewers advice, and used a lemon sauce with them- the recipe is from this site- "Lemon Sauce for Salmon Patties".

I made this for lunch yesterday-killer!  I loved it! So moist and so so good.  My 3 year old had one and my husband (who doesn't even eat seafood ) liked it. I will always use this recipe.  Amazing!

I make this with any type of fish that is left over. I use ground oats instead of panko. They are great. We even used them as filling for taco night. Ole!

Leftovers tasted great. Used non-Italian panko, .5 t Old Bay, .5 t. black pepper, 2 t. Worcestershire sauce, 3 T grated parmesan cheese, .25 c mayo, 2 T lemon juice (in mix). Fry 7 - 8 minutes total. Good with lemon squeezed over top and with vegetables for a side.

These salmon cakes are very good. I have also made these using tuna in place of the salmon and they are just as good. I accidently grabbed the soy sauce instead of the Worcestershire and they were just as yummy. Thank you Judiebug, for sharing your recipe.

Excellent salmon patties. I halved the recipe and mine didn't hold together very well, but I used Sams Club canned salmon that has no bones or skin. I also used shredded Parmesan cheese which probably was the reason for the fragile patties, but they were worth the effort... delicious.

These are tasty, but if you are new to canned salmon, don't expect something like albacore!  It is REALLY gross--there's a footnote on the can assuring you that it's OK to eat the bones (vertebrae) and skin and whatever else you're shocked to find in there, like that grayish stuff I meticulously remove from my grilled salmon.  Not planning to buy canned salmon again (this was Chicken of the Sea)!

Yes! These have just the right amount of kick to them. And they are moist. I've been looking for a good recipe for years. My dad was the only person I knew that could make them perfect. He would be proud of these.

Made the recipe exactly as author written it.  Best salmon cakes we ever had!  Like the fact of using panko instead of crackers, not so dry. Served with a horseradish dill sauce found on this site.  Outstanding recipe, will be making again and again!  Thanks for sharing!

Wow!! Look, I'm an amateur cook...I mean really a beginner. But I tried these salmon cakes tonight for dinner and they were fantastic! The seasonings were just right (I added a few squirts of lime juice to the recipe) and they turned out, well, "scrumptious"! Just like the title says! First time I ever made these and this recipe is a Keeper! You guys did it again!! THANK YOU! :-)

Baked at 350*F for 7mins., turned and put under broiler for 7 additional minutes... crisped up nice, and did ‘t need to use any olive oil......

Delicious! We couldn’t believe canned salmon could turn out to make such great salmon cakes! This recipe rocks!
We didn’t measure anything; just eyeballed it. Also, patted them in more panko before frying them up in our cast iron skillet, with an inch or so of canola oil. Super easy! Made a Cajun aioli and lemon tarragon aioli with it. Yum!

This is by far the best salmon patty recipe I have made!  I loved the old bay seasoning and I think that’s the secret. My picky teenage boys even loved them!!  I didn’t have green onions or parsley and I only had the foil packets of salmon instead of the cans. Because of that, I kind of guessed on the amounts of the remaining ingredients because the amount of salmon was different than the recipe requires. But they turned out delicious!!!  Thank you SO much for providing the best recipe!!

Fantastic! I made 2 substitutions due to what I had available: I used traditional bread crumbs and added a few dashes of Italian Seasoning, and secondly, I used 1/8 cup parsley flakes instead of fresh parsley. Husband and I both loved them (he with a dash of hot sauce, and I with a dash of lemon juice), and will be making them again!

A very good way to use up leftover salmon. I followed recipe basic ingredients and proportions, but substituted as needed for what I had on hand.  I did put extra bread crumbs on top and bottom when I placed the cakes into the pan, and I also used a mix of butter and olive oil for cooking them, to achieve a better crunch. Served with Creamed Peas from this site, and salad. It was a nice meal - better than I expected given the dry leftover salmon! BTW, I appreciate a recipe that stands up to substitutions, and this one does.

I followed the recipe just as it was written.  The flavor and consistency were good.  However, they were a little too salty for my liking.  I will certainly make them again; but I will cut down on the Old Bay and Worchester sauce as to not have so much of a salty flavor.  This is the only reason I rated this recipe four stars.

Fabulous recipe.  I like it spicy!  I always buy extra salmon fresh and cook it all.  We eat it blackened and then I use the left over salmon for these cakes.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe except sometimes I use a half of a white or yellow onion instead of green onion.

These were so so compared to the way I usually make salmon cakes. These did have more flavor so will make again, but cut the pepper more than I did.  I also used regular Panko crumbs because our store never had the Italian seasoned ones but today I noticed they finally have now so picked up a can. We'll make this again with a few minor adjustments though probably instead of my old way since it does have more flavor which we like.

My husband was skeptical at first because I was using the salmon pouches. I was then skeptical because as I was forming the patties, I thought they would fall apart while cooking.  To both of our delight, they came out fantastic and my husband, who almost never eats leftovers, ate these again the next night!  Great recipe and I'll be making these on a regular basis!

My husband loved them, but I thought it was way too heavy on the Worcestershire sauce; it dwarfed the taste of the salmon.  Next time I'll try it with 2 T. instead of 3 T.  We subbed yellow onion for the green onion.

I cut back on the pepper used and used fresh made salmon instead of canned salmon (it's what I had on hand). They turned out so good my gf and I were fighting over the rest of them! We wondered if freezing them was an option, so we could break some out on a night we didn't want to cook. 10/10 will cook again.

OMG!  My mother's recipe.  Over the years I have forgotten a few of the ingredients and am thrilled to be able to refresh my memory.  The soda crackers are the better ingredient.  It is still the easiest, quickest and most tasty of all of the recipes I have tried over the years.  Serve with boiled potatoes and butter and canned peas.  If you have a nice dill sauce that it enhances it even more.  Nothing better.  Still my absolute favorite!

My husband has fond memories of his grandma making salmon patties.  I am usually hesitant to make anything his mom or grandma made well, but he declared these patties better than the recipe he uses!   Wow!  That never happens!!  I did not have old bay seasoning so substituted a half teaspoon of creole seasoning (my kids do not like spicy foods) and omitted the black pepper (again, because of the kids).  I'd love to try it with old bay next time. I used plain panko crumbs and added a teaspoon of Italian seasoning to the crumbs to make them seasoned.  I must have made small patties because my batch produced 16-18 patties.
I served the salmon with a sour cream-mayo-dill sauce and a large side salad.  The kids (4 children ages 9 and under) were not impressed, but whenever canned salmon goes on sale I will definitely work this recipe into the rotation.  Thank you for sharing!!

This is near the same as the loaf recipe I got from my husband's mother back in the '90s.  That recipe went into a bread loaf pan and baked at 350* for 1/2 hour.  Then sliced like any 'meat' loaf.  Thanks for sharing.

My family loved these. Followed recipe exactly except smaller patty so I had 10 patties instead of 8. Served with House of Autry bold and zesty dipping sauce. Delicious!

I halved the recipe for 2 people and added all ingredients. The flavor was good, but even tho' I had a nice golden char on the outside, the inside was way too soft.  In the past I have used left over baked salmon added to canned salmon and I like the texture much better.

Made this tonight with some leftover salmon filet and also a can to add more to it. Followed the directions exactly aside from not having Italian panko, and using just original. They were delicious! A definite keeper for salmon leftovers this summer. Thanks for the share!
I mixed up a dip made of 1/4 cup sour cream, a squirt of lemon juice and a handful of fresh dill weed. It complimented the spices in the salmon well.

This was delicious. I didn't have panko bread crumbs so I used regular bread crumbs and I only used 1/2 cup. I substituted mayonnaise for the dressing. Otherwise, everything was the same. I made the patties smaller. Nice recipe and I'll definitely make these again!

"FABULOUS" per my husband! I served the cakes with a lemon-dill aioli sauce. Other than adjusting the recipe for two servings, I made as directed and will continue to use this recipe for salmon cakes. Why mess with perfection?!

My husband and I love baked salmon, but I've never made salmon cakes... that is until today. Now I wish I had tried them sooner. They were delicious. I followed the recipe cutting back only on the Old Bay seasoning to one teaspoon, because neither of us like overly spicy food.  Instead of a can of salmon, I used two packages of Chicken of the Sea salmon. There were no bones or skin to deal with and while it might have been a bit more expensive, the convenience was worth it. My husband and I really enjoyed the salmon cakes and they will join my favorites from AR. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I did not have green onions so I substituted a half onion. My panko was unseasoned and I added one T. salt free Italian seasoning along with the parsley.

It was delicious.

Really good. Halved the recipe. Added 3 strips of cooked and cut bacon. Replaced seafood seasoning with chili powder. Also no parsley, added basil and oregano since I used plain bread crumbs.

Magnificent! My Grandmother-in-law (who came over on the Lusitania) just called them "fish cakes" Since she never wrote down her recipes, I've been searching for one that comes close. This IS it! I WILL be making these again. No changes needed.

The only thing I would change is to use half the amount of Old Bay seasoning. As another reviewer noted, this is overly spicy and for me also overly salty—both no doubt to Old Bay. I don’t shy from very spicy food but in this case it totally overpowers the flavor of the salmon—there could be anything in there—I want to taste salmon.

Didn't expect canned salmon to yield flavorful succulent cakes. I halved the recipe and followed closely. I mixed the ingredients in the morning and refrigerated till close to dinner time. I shaped into 8 small cakes and pan fried  in 2 batches. I made tartar sauce from this site to top the cakes with, and served with some oven fries and a salad.

Fantastic recipe! I did make a few changes, I used white onion minced finely instead of the green onion, and dried parsley in place of fresh I also substituted nonfat Greek yogurt in place of the mayo/miracle whip. They were delicious on brioche buns with a bit of tartar sauce!

This was great; I could not stop eating it.  I left out green pepper, would have added red pepper had I had one.  Added about 1/2 a cop of Parmesan cheese to recipe.  I am always looking for cheaper  fish dishes, and while canned salmon has increased in price, it's still a good deal.  My husband  calls it, "the only endangered species in a can."

Great recipe and it has become one of my go-to recipes when I didn't know what to cook! Would have gave 5 stars except the Prep time was way more than 15 minutes, more like 30. I did not have green onions so I substituted shallots instead a few times. Also I add a few shakes of Tabasco sauce and have  substituted Asagio cheese when I did not have Parmesan. Nix on the creamy salad dressing as did not see the point of it. All in all, my family loves this recipe. I serve it with Blackeye peas and rice and whatever veggies I have on hand or a salad and of o course, homemade tartar sauce.

These were delicious. I added an extra teaspoon of Old Bay, as we love it. After cooking, I squeezed half a lemon over them . Will definitely make again .

Used leftover halibut that had been marinated and cooked the day before. Best fish cakes we’ve had. They didn’t fall apart and were so easy to make.

I made these as listed but they just lacked something. Maybe some celery, or a lemon sauce to perk up the flavor. I made the full recipe for 2 of us and I'm hoping they are tastier for lunch leftovers. I will find a nice lemon sauce and try these again.

I go back to this salmon cake recipe all of the time. Its got great flavor. It works with canned salmon, but is even better if you have fresh.  Seasoning is perfect.

Very good.  I adjusted quantities to two servings but got 3 good size cakes out of it.  I followed the recipe as written with just one slight reduction in the pepper quantity and I didnt use canned salmon - I had salmon steak left over from the day before that I used.  Ièll make this again soon.  Served with sauteed chopped asparagus and small zucchini, fresh sliced tomato and brown rice.

The salmon cakes were tasty but a bit too juicy. I made a few just like the recipe but noticed I should've fried them with flour. Once I did That they were good

We really liked the salmon cakes and they weren't too spicy.  We felt a light sauce would have been nice on top - but have no idea what kind of sauce...

I am not a fan of salmon cakes,  but made it to use up canned salmon. I of course didn't have all of the ingredients, so I used  Spike instead of Old Bay, a combination of crushed saltines and bread crumbs instead of Panko, left out the Parmesan,  used spicy brown mustard instead of Dijon,  diced onions instead of green, and followed as listed for the rest. I fried them in the olive oil plus some butter. They were a real hit! And I even thought they were good....

Family enjoyed this dish. I have always made my patties with potatoes and I like this better, it's  nice and light and tasty. I halvedecipe and used  smoked salmon dip as an alternative to the seafood seasoning and just a teaspoon of mayonnaise. It was "scrumptious" will make again. Thank
you.

If I can get my finicky son to eat these, they're a winner.  Easily adaptable if you don't have all ingredients.  As long as you have the "bones" of the recipe (no pun intended), they are perfect.  Add what you have that makes sense.  Now in rotation at my house.  TIP:  it is, as others may have said, a bit easier to handle these if you make ahead, even a little, and refrigerate the patties.

I made this last night and we really liked it.  It did have a lot more ingredients than I usually put in or than I like to use but I thought I'd give it a try anyway.  I'm glad I did.  I will certainly be using this recipe again.

I don't like salmon, but we are trying to eat healthier so I decided to try this recipe.  They were delicious and simple!  I followed the recipe except I didn't have green onion, so I subbed some dehydrated onion.  Will definitely make this one again!

I left out the Dijon and the old bay. I liked the texture but I felt like there were a lot of ingredients that didn’t really change the overall result from what mine used to taste like. I felt like these were good but not over the top delicious.

Excellent. I had left over salmon that had been marinaded in soy, ginger, sherry etc. mixture. I don't know how much difference that made to the flavor. Served it over a bed of lettuce with cranberry orange dressing from Kroger.

This is a wonderful recipe! My family and I couldn't get enough of it!  This was my first time using canned salmon and I was not aware that it is packed still boned. Removing the bones was very time consuming and aggravating. But it was worth it in the end, because the cakes were quite good!  I served it with a roasted garlic aioli!

Very good recipe.  I'll think I'll add a little more spice to it next time.

I substituted to fresh salmon filets with I baked at 400 15 min with the seasoning and a little Pam spray.  Also subbed finely chopped red onion because I didn’t have green onion. Turned out great!

This is my "go to" recipe for salmon cakes.  This only thing I change is to use mayo instead of Miracle Whip (taste preference) and maybe a touch more garlic.  Serve on top of slightly wilted spinach and top with sour cream.  Great as leftovers too!

Decreased spices for my hubby's preference, although he didn't like them much anyway (not a salmon fan). Added a bit of butter to the olive oil and they crisped up nicely. My son loved them. I thought they were ok, but would probably be much better with fresh or frozen salmon cooked and flaked as opposed to canned. May try with tuna.

This would be a 5 star if you use fresh salmon which I did by first baking the salmon and then flaking it. I didn't have the panko so I used crushed saltine crackers. Made a sauce using mayo, garlic, thyme and cayenne pepper to top it. Definitely will be making this again.

I had made a salmon loaf before with pink salmon and didn't  love it but with the seasoning in these patties, it was delicious.
My husband said they were excellent, didn't find it overly spicy at all. I only made 5 since they were a bit bigger but great flavours!

Super good and easy! No fresh parsley...dang...so used dried. Had some fresh frozen Washington salmon and some smoked as well so blended them and the patties were so good! Will make again for sure!! Even my DH gave this 5 stars! Made a nice dill sauce to serve with them.

This was the most interesting of the salmon cake/pattie recipes I've followed, and turned out very well. The parmesan and worcestire add a lot and I I substituted regular italian breadcrumbs - what I had on hand - for panko. I used basil instead of parsley. Great flavor, can't wait to make it again!

This recipe used quite a few more ingredients that my traditional salmon patties, so, I thought I would give it a try for a change.  We thought it had good flavor, but, was too salty from the old bay.   They developed a nice crust that we liked.  I made exactly as the recipe stated except I subbed one of the cans of salmon with fresh because I had a leftover piece I needed to use up.

Fabulous ! Only changed panko crumbs to crushed ritz crackers and added addl  Ital seas,(nixed) the Old bay b/c I don't like it) added, dill, onion pwdr, lemon crystals, crushed red pepped flakes and added a little butter to evoo for frying. Oh and less than 2T worchestershire. Tastes like a $30 plate in the OBX only better.
Served it with an Italian pasta salad and dill sauce. 
Scrumptious for sure! Thank you so much!

Made this pretty much exactly like the recipe, except for the salad dressing.  Used leftover marinated grilled salmon for this recipe and it turned out great.  I'm a new fish eater, so this was a big thumbs up!  No changes other than no salad dressing since the fish was marinated with oil before grilling.  Other than that, I used a chipotle asiago dressing at serving.  Will do this again!

Loved it - I made it with fresh salmon and plain breadcrumbs. I ground the salmon using an extension with my kitchenaid. I loved and will definitely make them again.

These were excellent! I did'nt have the old bay spice so I just used what I had at home, Italian,garlic/onion powder etc. They worked out fabulously. Definitely a keeper, my kids even had seconds. That's a big deal!

Good and easy. I halved the recipe and served only one patty each. Plenty of food with a side dish or two. Warmed the other two for lunch the next day.

Love this recipe! Made it almost exactly as written. The only change I made was to add 3 or 4 hand crushed saltine crackers as I didn't have enough Panko. I used Miracle Whip as suggested. Cooked this in a cast iron skillet in olive oil and a little butter. Absolutely delicious.

Made 1/2 recipe and it made 4 nice size patties. I used mayonnaise and added  lemon juice. My husband was hesitant to try these since my old recipe for salmon patties were very dry.These were the moistest salmon patties we ever had.Made the lemon sauce as recommended by some people. Definitely  will make again.

Changes: Keebler multigrain crackers crumbled instead of Panko, Reduced Old Bay and garlic powder by 1/2 tsp. Didn't add parmesan cheese  and used regular yellow mustard. Added 1 tsp of horseradish cream.

Delish!

VERY salty...which could be because I cook with little to no salt as you can always add, but not take away as easily.

Other than that, the flavor seemed great! I'll tweak it a little more and I'm sure it'll come out better for the tastebuds in this household :)

Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

Great job on this one! Nice consistency/texture, no greasiness, and low fat. I made a stone ground mustard and molasses dipping sauce with mine, which was a nice accompiament.
Will definitely make again :)

I needed to try another recipe and this seemed liked a challenge, and for me it was but well worth it. I made two batches my first batch, I made my patties too large and they fell apart when flipping them. So my next batch I went off  the path, I added a whole cup of panko and cut back to 1 tsp of old bay seasoning and cut the Worcestershire sauce back to two tbsp. I also I added 1 habanero and 1 jalapeño. I also learned from my first run at this, so I made my patties much smaller and they held together nicely. I will definitely make this recipe again yummy!!!!

I didn't have dijon mustard so I just used regular.  I had never used such a range of ingredients in my salmon patties, but this was outstanding!  Will make these again...and again.

I made this as written and was disappointed. My family thought it was bland and not worth making again. I think our tastes just run a little different from others that rated this higher. Thanks for sharing the recipe though.

I thought, why not give this receipe a try in a Forman grill?.  So I prepared it (after adjusting to 4 servings) I preheated the grill first( four minutes).   I sprayed my grill with olive oil spray.  I decided to use just a sprinkling of O bay in the mix   I didn't have Dijon mustard so I used yellow. Didn't have fresh parsley so I used 1/8 dried.  .  I made 4 patties and cooked them on the preheated Forman for six minutes.  They came out great!

There weren't any leftovers!   Even without the Old Bay Seasoning and the parmasean cheese, these were delicious. I will definitely be making these again, and often.

Was trying to find something east to make at the last minute because of my busy schedule and also I have a picky eater. This was a big hit! I only had a pinch of Old Bay but I added a dash of cayenne and paprika and dill. Didn't have Panko so I used Italian bread crumbs. My picky eater loved it so much! Thanks for sharing!

Omitted scallions, used plain Panko bread crumbs, plain mayo, and added lemon juice to the mixture. Those were the only (very minor) changes. My only complaint was that 8 patties (2 batches) took close to 40 mins. to cook. They just did not want to cook, and I was afraid if I turned the heat up they would burn on the outside and not cook in the middle. I  used plenty of oil (and butter), but they stuck to the pan slightly after being in the pan for so long. I put a lid on the second batch which cut down on the cook time. Luckily,  they were worth the wait; hubby and I both loved them. I made a tartar sauce to go with, and he put his on a hamburger bun. Next time, I think I will make smaller patties  (3 batches), with just a few larger ones for my husband to put on buns.

I reduced the amount of Worcestershire sauce thinking it may make the mixture a little too salty, other wise changed nothing else. Very tasty and enjoyed by all, will definitely make them again

Used fresh salmon that I pulsed in the food processor then mixed with the ingredients. Chilled the salmon cakes for 20 minutes and placed in an oiled cast iron skillet and baked at 375 degrees for 10 minutes per side. Excellent.

I use this as my base recipe for canned or leftover salmon. DONT USE EGGS. Add more moisture/mayo-base and breadcrumbs if needed until it feels okay and sticks. Using a filling that does not use raw eggs means you just need to brown them and they are ready to eat! You no longer need to worry about any *albeit small* danger of raw eggs but it totally resolves any second thoughts so you focus on browning more than internal temp

The BEST salmon cakes I have ever eaten/cooked! My ONLY complaint is that these were a little salty. I'm assuming from the Old Bay seasoning. Next time, I would scale back to just 1 teaspoon. Besides that, these were excellent! I followed this recipe to a T except for having to sub bread crumbs for the panko. I topped these with a creamy dill sauce. I'll definitely be making these again! Thank you!

This was excellent.  I suggest cutting back on the Old Bay seasoning.  It seemed too salty.  Also sub regular onion and one or two minced garlic cloves (saute first in some olive oil) for the green onion and garlic powder.  Otherwise, very good.

Simple, quick, and delicious!! I'm extremely impressed! I was hesitant in the beginning since I've never made salmon cakes before and I didn't know what to expect. Followed exact recipe with all ingredients listed and ended up making mini bite size cakes. Will definitely make again. Thank you so much Judiebug!!

I didn't have Italian spiced Panko so I threw in a bit of Italian seasoning. Also, I couldn't find Old Bay seasoning so I went online and found the simplest recipe I could find for making my own. I used canned Sockeye salmon. It turned out great - a very nice blend of spices and the cakes held together well. I would definitely make this recipe again.

This was great .  I added chopped up celery and red pepper to add texture.  As I enjoy Louisiana zesty taste I added Louisiana hot sauce to taste as well as replaced Old Bay with Tony Chachere's Creole spice.  This will be my go to for salmon cakes.

I'm glad I came across this recipe, and I had everything on hand except green onion.  I substituted 1/2 small white onion instead.  This was very good, and my hb (who doesn't like salmon) ate two servings.  I added 1TBSP butter to the olive oil as another reviewer suggested and liked the result.  I will definitely be adding this to my quick dinner rotation.  Thank you for sharing!

Really well seasoned. I'm not a huge fish: seafood eater and I really enjoyed it. My husband loved it! The only thing I did was to halve the recipe other than that I followed the recipe exactly. The only change I'll make is buying deboned salmon next time

It wasn't bad, it simply wasn't to my taste. I found it to be too heavily spiced. I think the Dijon mustard especially overwhelmed the taste of the fish. I must  also mention that I didn't have the Old Bay seasoning on hand, which can also be very strong. I can only imagine I wouldn't have tasted any fish at all if I'd had it. I think I will be looking for a more basic, traditional recipe will satisfy me more. Fewer ingredients, more salmon flavor.

This was a little different from my usual salmon patties but did not disappoint. There are only 2 of us so I did cut the recipe in half, didn't have a green onion so swapped it out with a shallot and could not find seafood seasoning so just left it out. It was still a great recipe, held their shape and had a nice crunch from the panko bread crumbs. Served with a salad made a nice light supper for a hot summer night.

I loved these and they were a snap to make.  I topped them with Sriracha Aioli and wow - of course, obviously I like spices.  My daughter thought them a bit spicy, which I actually figured she would.  She prefers less intensity.  The Italian crumbs did have a fairly large salt dosage, so might change that the next time around....which will be soon!  Still doesn't change how good this recipe is.  Thank you!

This is a great recipe and I think it's better than almost all crab cake recipes, (except for a great find in a little town on the Maryland Eastern shore).  Short of grilling and using my own salmon,  Costco's Kirtland brand in 7 oz. cans is really good.  Never found a bone yet.  Mild but delicious salmon.   Haven't tried the Old Bay because I just hadn't found any, but now did get some and will use it next time.  Will cook these when my wife, daughter, and daughters-in-law have a girl time at our cabin.  I am invited only to be the cook.  Otherwise make myself scarce.

I love, love these  salmon cakes! I am not a big fish fan, but will eat salmon.  Most salmon cakes  I have to drench in sauce so I like them, but these I didn't I could eat them plain! So flavorful and didn't have any fishy taste. And it's a super easy recipe to double or triple!

Very good. Used 2 tins (7oz) and made 4 patties. Served with sautéed mushrooms, fresh tomatoes and cucumbers. Didn't have Panko so just used fine bread crumbs.

Left out the Old Bay Seasoning cause the children aren't fans of spicy foods.  Had to sub dried parsley cause I didn't want to run to the grocery store.  Used a higher end salmon and they turned out fantastic!  Will definitely make again.  Kids gave it 2 thumbs up!!

I added a few extras including fresh minced garlic and Mediterranean spice, 1 extra egg and poured salmon juice into mix to help with dryness. The cakes turned out perfect. Better than expected cause usually I've struggle with dryness of the salmon. Very good taste!

These were perfect.  I used fresh leftover  salmon baked in dill and lemon juice but have also made them with tinned.  The seasoning is just right.  No panko so I used gluten-free breadcrumbs I made on the spot   No Miracle whip so I used real mayo.   They were absolutely delicious.  Served them with home made tartar sauce and lemon wedges.  Big hit with my husband, great way to get more fatty fish nutrients.

I did not have fresh parsley and I think the freshness would have been nice.  It has a good flavor.
Overall it was nice and moist, with good flavor.  
Because of my diebitis I did sub half the breadcrumbs for oatmeal.

I will make it again, it worked well for me.

I dislike salmon, I know its good for you but every way I've ever tried it, I do not like it.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!  I COULD NOT STOP EATING THEM!  It was so flavorful and not fishy at all.  My family (even my picky kids) all really liked it too!  I served it with a caper & lemon yogurt sauce and a side of mac-n-cheese.  We will definitely make this a regular part of our dinner rotation.  DELICIOUS!!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I only had plain breadcrumbs, so added some Italian seasoning to fix that.  I coated the patties in flour to help bind them and brown them.  My patties were quite large, so I might halve the recipe next time or freeze half of them after frying, or just make smaller patties and also freeze or halve the recipe.  Otherwise, these are delicious.

Fabulous!  I used two 7-oz cans of wild salmon from Costco and adjusted other ingredients accordingly.  Only did a dash of Worcestershire sauce and a little Dijon.  Didn't want to overpower the taste.  So, so, so delicious!!  Will definitely make again.

Made this according to the recipe, it was a big hit! Only thing I did different was that I made them into balls and cooked them on the stove top in my aebleschiver cast iron pan. Recipe made 10 balls.

I followed the recipe closely but cut in half.  I didn't have the Italian crumbs - just plain, and didn't have the parsley.  I doubled the onion and the cheese (using shredded, not grated.)  These were quite good.   I made them smaller, getting 7 instead of 4 out of the recipe.  We liked them and at the same time think that we would add another onion next time and up the spices a bit.  The suggestion of using a small bit of butter in the skillet along with the oil is one I wish I would have taken.  Good recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Made it! Flavorful with good weight and easy to form the patties.   Very minor adjustments were based on need, such as: Plain Panko breadcrumbs on hand, no parsley on hand, so I added red peppers, and I had honey mustard instead of dijon...

Made these tonight along with Sally's Spinach mashed potatoes which is 5 stars.  Both recipes are perfect.  My husband told me that he would pay for this meal.  Very nice compliment for these recipes.

Because many of the reviews said they were too spicy, I left out the worcescire sauce, old bay and onion.
Everything else I used 1/2 the amount.  This made 8 medium size patties.  (As an app I'd make them even smaller next time) They were Excellent!
The next time I will include a small amount of onion.  :)

Pretty good - I used leftover salmon from the night before, so this is  not specifically a review of this recipe, but what I made was based on this recipe.

First, my wife had made 2 lbs of cooked salmon the night before.  She cooked fresh salmon in the oven (18 minutes  at 425oF), seasoned with Old Bay (we both were born and raised in Bawlmer, so of course!), butter and fresh squeezed lemon.  We are new almost empty nesters, so we cook as if there is still a house full of hungry teenage boys.

I used the 1 lbs of leftover salmon, and pretty much made to recipe with the exception of mayo instead of salad dressing/Miracle Whip.  Instead of pan frying, I broiled the cakes 7 minutes a side (I made 6 big cakes although I could have made 8 smaller ones).

The only change we will make next time is backing off on the  Worcestershire sauce as it was a little salty, most likely due to the fact we used Old Bay the night before.

Made some homemade tartar and cocktail sauce for the side...overall, this is one we will make again - thanks!

I've never made salmon cakes before in my life.  My husband loved them so much that he even took one to his mother!  She loved them as well and she makes salmon cakes all the time.  I'm glad they were a hit.  My husband ate them with ketchup. I ate them plain, but I could see how you might want to add a sauce.  Since they have the mother-in-law seal of approval, I will make them more often.

I just made these and they turned out even better than I imagined. I'm not a huge fan of salmon, but I could eat it like this anytime. I love a lot of seasonings and this hit the mark on flavor. Paired it with Spaghetti Aglio Olio (another favorite on Allrecipes) and it had my house smelling like food heaven. Im definitely adding this to my list of favorites. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved these salmon cakes and will definitely make them again! They do have a lot of spice and I'll cut down a little more on the pepper than I did the first time. I also substituted Dukes mayonnaise for the Miracle Whip, and additionally made a mayo/lemon juice/dill weed sauce for the cakes.

I will definitely be making this again, we loved it!  The only changes I made was using Penzies  Spices - Northwoods Seasoning for the fish seasoning and ranch dressing for the creamy dressing.  Served it with a homemade tartar sauce.

I loved these.  If you like salmon you will love these. I will admit I didn't have the Dijon mustard so used half as much with regular mustard. These are so much better than basic salmon patties and I would be proud to serve them to company

My husband doesn't really like most fish..only deep fried battered cod, which isn't exactly healthy.  He tolerates salmon steaks or filets, but they sure aren't his favorite.  THIS recipe had him saying he would eat it once a week!  I make a yogurt/chopped cucumbers sauce tO go with it, and he gobbles it up!  Hooray for a great recipe!

Didn't make any changes.  This was good but I def think I'd add more spices to it, not as much of a kick in flavor like i thought. I'd also add lemon to kick up the salmon flavor. Other than that I'd make it again just some adjustments.

Followed directions except made my own bread crumbs from gluten free bread and coated cakes lightly in fine corn meal.  They were very good, froze well and have been added to my regular rotation.  Even made them for lunch with some friends.  They were a hit.

This is a Fantastic recipe.  I've always disliked canned salmon but love canned tuna and fresh fish.  Both are expensive and sometimes fresh fish is not easy for me to get because of my disabilities.  For years I've been wishing I could find a recipe that contained canned salmon that I could enjoy.  FINALLY!!!!!!!!! Thank you SO much for this recipe.  I followed the ingredients and instructions to the letter.  These cakes are great hot, room temperature and cold.  I'll make a full recipe at a time and use the left overs for a quick snack right out of the frig.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I live alone, so I halved it, making 2 meals for me.   One does not need to pick out the bones, etc.  I usually remove the large center bone only (not necessary, though).  All the "stuff" blends in and cannot be detected once cooked.  It's silly to spend time picking out the small bones and cartilage.  It's actually good for you.  Leftovers from fresh salmon is delicious! Thanks for the nice recipe.

My stepdaughter, who loves crab cakes, but does not like fish, loved this recipe. It's a winner and very easy to make. I browned them for 6 minutes each side and they came out perfect. I used regular yellow mustard in place of dijon  mustard and it was fine. This will be made again and again.

Super yummy! I didn't have seafood seasoning so I used more garlic, onion powder, hot mustard powder and it tasted just fine.

These were very good.  Only thing I did different was omitted the parsley, as I didn't have it on hand.  I too will half the recipe next time as there are just two of us.  They made good size patties.  Will make again! DH also thought they were good!

I haven't tried this yet. An interesting egg alternative (though veg oil would work fine as suggested)I found is something called a "Flax Egg". I might try that for grins. 1 Tbsp Flax Meal and 2.5 Tbsp water. Oil would probably be better, but I like to try new things...until I find they're scrap.

Very good recipe but, due to "user error," was a bit salty, as I'd used leftover salmon. I used crushed UNSALTED soda crackers (maybe 1 c. total, as I had a fair amount of salmon),  1 tsp.  Old Bay, replaced the black pepper with only about 1/2 tsp. of white pepper,  and added onion powder (my daughter is suspicious of anything with the texture of chopped onions).  These were really moist and flavorful and held together perfectly; I made & shaped them then stuck them in the fridge for about 30 minutes.  I'll happily make this recipe again, being mindful of the salt level on my salmon and adjusting accordingly.

This is the best salmon patty recipe I've tried. I followed another reviewers advice and halved the Bay seasoning. I made 4 larger patties instead of 8.  I wish I had taken a picture  because it is a pretty combination  of colors.

These was very tasty. I didn't have old bay so omitted, added a little dill, and a little tumeric, but stuck to the recipe otherwise. Served on a bed of kale drizzled with lemon vinaigrette and toppled with dollop of lemon aioli---both of those recipes also from this site! Will definitely make again but omit the salt as the salt from the worchestershire and the Dijon was more than enough.

This was very good. Lots of flavor! I am from Maryland and we like to broil our crab cakes so that's what I did with these. Broil on low keep an eye not to burn the top of the salmon cakes... 10-15 minutes should do it. No need to turn them. Also finishing them with lemon before eating takes some of the edge off the strong spice flavors in this recipe. Next time I will cut back on some of the spices that are salty such as old bay, worstershire sauce and Dijon mustard.

I didn't care for this recipe. The seasoning from the breadcrumbs seemed to diffuse the great seasoning of the mustard, worcestershire sauce. I'll give them another try without the Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, or maybe plain breadcrumbs.

Excellent! Just made this for a cold winter's day lunch. The spice I used was Potlatch from Williams and Sonoma. I omitted the black pepper because I have a very sensitive mouth due to radiation treatment. I also omitted the mustard as it just didn't sound alike an ingredient that would blend well with the others. The result was delicious! I like the addition of the Worchestershire sauce.

I gave this recipe only 3 stars because the preparation was a nightmare!  I spent 1 miserable hour picking out skin, bones, & vertebra from the canned salmon. I never used canned salmon before so I had no idea there would be that many bones.  Some friends say you can eat those bones but that is unappealing to me.  To the more experienced cooks out there..is there a canned salmon without the bones? can I use fresh salmon? 
In the end, I would have given a 5 star rating on taste because everybody enjoyed the delicious salmon patties.   
Bottom line: I would make them again if the preparation wasn't so laborious.

I make these, a variation of them, all the time using tuna fish.   Also good.   I don't particularly like mustard in mine but the rest is very similar.

I loved this recipe and made it exactly exept for the salmon....I don't care for the bones.  I used albacore tuna and it was wonderful!!!   Thanks for posting such a wonderful recipe.
