I've made this many, many times and I never get sick of it. I only make a few minor changes: first, I saute chicken tenders (instead of whole breasts) and slice them into bite sized pieces. Next, I double the sauce to serve over pasta, and usually add a little extra cajun seasoning to the sauce as well (I like it spicy!) And lastly, I usually add a can of cajun veg-all to the sauce. Delicious and simple!

Very good. To add for simple convenience, I just add a can of rotel w/ tomatoes, green chillies and lime juice. (drain most of the juice) makes it quicker and easier!

Wow-what a wonderful twist on chicken! Chicken with a little kick! Definitely let the sauce set just a little bit after boiling to thicken somewhat-quick and easy.  I loved it!

We did not like this.  The flavor was just not there - I even doubled everything.  If I make it again, I will try adding some seasoning salt or "house seasoning" to the chicken, and then the creole/cajun seasoning, as well as combining the sauce in a separate saucepan instead of adding it to the skillet with the chicken & adding some additional salt/pepper to the sauce.

This was good but not "wow" and I give this recipe 3.5 start.  It was quick and easy though so that's a definite plus for busy nights!  The dish was more bland than I thought it would be and if I made it again, I would add extra seasoning, sea salt, and at least, another teaspoon of lime juice.  The one tsp. of lime juice was barely evident.  I think chipotle peppers (pureed or finely chopped) would make a good subtsitute for the green chilies, especially if you like it spicy.

I love this recipe.  I have made it several times, and each time I do, I question why I waited so long between making it.  I do it just as it says.  The chicken being cooked completely is the only thing you really need to watch for.  I personally don't make the rice because I am trying to not eat as many carbs.  Oh, and I used an entire 7 oz. can of chillies to spice it up a bit.

Tried this on a whim because I had everything on hand and wanted something quick - I'm so glad I did. It was so good. This will definitely be made often at my house! Only thing I did different was to use lemon instead of lime.

We loved this dish!  Its simple and very tasty.  Substituted jalepenos for the chilies (because that's all I had!) and added extra Cajun season (because we like it hot!).  Very pleased with this one!

This was tasty, but I think the flavor was much improved by the fact that I used some of that new garlic and herb flavored sour cream. That stuff is really yummy. It wouldn't of had as much flavor if I didn't put that in instead of regular sour cream. (I tasted the sauce before putting it in) Other than that, it was an easy quick meal. I served it over angel hair pasta instead of rice, because I was out! :P

4.5 stars.  I cooked on stovetop, but ended up slicing the chicken breasts so they would cook through sooner.  My husband's family has a recipe called Chicken Continental, which this is just like but with a Southwestern flair.

i actually give this recipe 4.5 stars...simple and tasty!  my only complaint is that we didnt have any rice in the house so i didnt make any....boo!  That would have been tasty in all that yummy sauce.  i thought the sauce was great even before i added the sour cream...in fact, i think next time i will cut the sour cream in half :)  i also think a little extra lime couldn't hurt...but i like that zingy lime taste :)  So many recipes with cream of "chick, mush, celery, etc" are too heavy and that soup flavor dominates the dish, so im usually leery of such recipes...however with all the positive comment, i just had to give it a try.  Thank you...this will definitely go into the meal rotation!

Very good! Chicken with a little kick. I served with rice and the whole family cubed the chicken and mixed it with rice. Little spicy for little ones but i will definitely still make again.

This is really tasty and is very quick and easy to prepare.  The last time I made this, I cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces before browning, added 1 tablespoon lime juice and substituted skim milk for the water.

Very good. My husband & I LOVED it!  I also used the leftovers to make chicken enchilatas the next day. I didn't have quite enought chicken left over but plenty of sauce so I just added a can of (drained) chicken. I mixed salsa with the left over rice & added that in along with refried beans. I rolled up the enchilatas poured remaining salsa over added shredded Mexican Cheese & baked until warmed through (about 30 to 45 minutes @ 350). I love recipes that build on each other like this. Thanks for sharing!

I liked how easy this was to make. I will say though that this just tastes like thick green chili sauce over chicken. Not very spicy at all. I did use a fresh anaheim pepper instead of canned chilis but I might add something more next time for more of a punch.

It seems like the heat replaced flavor in this recipe.  More and different seasonings are in order for the sauce, too.

I made this a couple weeks ago and it was really good, the only thing that i would have done differently would have been to add more of the seasoning on the chicken, but the Chiles were me and my boyfriends favorite part, They gave the perfect amount of tanginess! :)

This was absolutely delicious!  My boyfriend requested something spicy, chicken, and rice, so I used this.  To ensure it to be flavorful, I made a few modifications: seasoned the chicken with crushed black pepper, a bit of cilantro, and a dash of togarashi.  I only cooked 2 chicken breasts but kept the amounts for the cream sauce with half a can of HOT rotell.  I'm soo excited to use the extra sauce with pasta as suggested by someone earlier.

Wow this was surprisingly good. I usually don't like things with cream of soups, but this worked. I did feel like it was missing something, maybe some onions, but will definately make again.

This meal is quite delicious and very easy and quick to make! Highly recommend it. It wasn't too spicy yet had just the kick I was looking for. I'd never made anything with cajun seasoning before and was happy to make a meal as delicious as this for my first!

This recipe was easy enough to make and didn't require a lot of ingredients, but it seemed like it was missing a dimension of flavor.  It was not a hit in my household.

My boyfriend never loves any recipe. But this is the closest he has come to loving something. We followed recipe as is. Something that we will continue to make for a long time. Great flavor.

Very good. I doubled the sauce and served over angel hair pasta. Also, I didn't have lime juice so I used lemon which worked fine.

Made this recipe last night and my family loved it!! I added a little more creole seasoning because we like spicy foods. It has awesome flavor for such a simple and quick dish.  If you are concerned about the amount of heat to add to the dish, just wait and add the seasonings after you have mixed in the soup, water, chiles and lime, then taste the sauce to determine how much seasonings you will add.  I will definitely add this recipe to our family's weeknight meals.

Fantastic! Great flavors and very easy to put together. It was definitely easier to cut the chicken into strips that cooked more evenly. I used Emeril's Bayou Blast Creole seasoning and thoroughly coated the strips before cooking. Don't be afraid to use fat free sour cream. The sauce is thick and flavorful enough to make that substitution. Also, I chose diced jalapeños from a jar over the chilies and was thrilled with the results. I served the chicken and sauce with a side of mixed vegetables and NO rice. It was perfect.

This was pretty good but not WOW!  The sauce was tasty, but it was missing something.  Maybe some Rotel tomatoes?  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, except that I doubled the sauce.  I liked it, but not sure if I'll make it again.

A very simple dinner.  I used Cajun seasoning on the chicken and even added some to the sauce.  It was a little spicy, but not overly so.

Loved this recipe and tweaked it minorly by using Kitchen Bouquet Lea Perrins and jalepenos for the spice and then added a can of mushrooms to the sauce. The sauce was darker than what is pictured here but would lighten w/more sour cream.  I also steamed broccoli for over the rice.  Fabulous!

Excellent!!  I added a little extra Cajun Seasoning, because we like our foot Spicy.  I didn't add the lime, because I didn't have any.  It turned out amazing!  I served it over Egg Noodles instead of Rice, and everyone Loved it! I will definitely make this again.

A good, not too spicy meal. Doesn't have quite the kick I am used to with cajun foood, so I made a few changes, like adding zested lime to the sauce and using greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Also used a LOT more cajun seasoning on the chicken, made it much better. All in all, an excellent way to introduce my kids to some cajun flavors.

The recipe was easy to follow, however, I felt the dish lacked flavor. I'd recommend going a little heavy handed with the cajun seasoning.

The whole family enjoys this. So simple to make. I do encourage everyone to double the sauce. Doubling really makes too much but the sauce amount as made per recipe isn't quite enough for my family. We are rather obsessed with sauces in our family though.

I found a cajun seasoning recipe on here and used that. I also used pam spray instead of olive oil. I doubled the sauce since we like lots of sauce on the rice but I had more than enough left over. It was really good....had a mexican taste to it.

It was mediocre at best.  I used a 7 oz can of chiles, and used a combination of Emeril's original essence, southwest spice, and bayou blast (total 4 teaspoons).  I cut the chicken into cubes and coated in seasonings and let sit for about 30 minutes before cooking.  It still needed extra spices.  I served over brown rice.  It definitely rates for being easy, about one of the easiest things I've ever made and clean up was simple.  It just needing something, ocra or other veggie, and I don't know what else.  It just wasn't good enough to mess with figuring out how to doctor it up.  There are too many other good recipes out there.  BTW, I used 1.6 lbs of chicken and there was more than plenty of sauce.

This was very fast and easy to make. It had just the right amount of spice for me. The only change I made was cutting the chicken into bite sized pieces and mixing the cooked rice with the whole mixture. I will make this again!

I make it a bit hotter then normal (tried it once as is written here) I add some Serrano peppers to add some heat to it.

I made this recipe the other night, it was great! Instead of using green chiles, I used a can of hot rotel, or any rotel would do, but it made it extra spicy and good. I also made this using salmon instead of chicken and with cream of mushroom, and I used rotel again and it was great! Thanks

This was fantastic & so easy! I threw it all in the crock pot and went to work.  It cooked for 8 hours and was absolutely delicious.  My 9 year old critic/daughter really liked it too...she agrees that it's a "keeper."  I seasoned the chicken with the Creole seasoning, placed it in the bottom of the crock pot.  Then mixed all remaining ingredients except sour cream together and poured over the chicken.  When I got home tonight, I mixed in the sour cream to heat while the rice cooked.  Very tasty all the way around.  Will be making this again!  Thanks for a super easy and tasty recipe!!

Delicious!  I can definitely see this becoming a regular meal.  I used a can of Rotel with lime instead of just the chilis and topped it with a little cilantro.  I served it over rice and black beans!  YUM!

This was very tasty.  I thought the sauce was a little too thin, so I'll make this with less water or maybe I'll try making it with milk instead.  I'll probably also salt the chicken just a bit.

I sliced up the chicken breasts and added extra cajun seasoning.  It was good, quick and easy but it needed salt.  Will definately make again.

This was okay, but mainly because I happen to like the taste of cream of chicken soup. It doesn't really taste like much besides mildly spicy cream of chicken soup, and maybe I should have been able to predict that based on the recipe, but I was still a bit disappointed in how little other flavor there was.  I used a fresh Hungarian wax pepper instead of the canned chilies, I used more Cajun seasoning, and I skipped the rice and served this on sauteed green and red pepper slices (low carb and all that)...but otherwise I didn't change anything. I really think this would actually be a lot better without the cream of chicken soup; maybe just mix some more sour cream in to get a little bit of a creamy coating.

Good for what it is, quick and easy. I would recommend making sure the chicken is cooked thoroughly before adding the cream of chicken and other items. I wish it would have been hotter (spicy) but that is just my preference.

I used chicken broth instead of water and since I didn’t have lime juice I used lemon. Served over rice pilaf...very delicious.

I cubed the chicken and added more Cajun, lime juice, sour cream than recipe calls for, and served over noodles.  It kind of reminds me of a spicy chicken stroganoff.

I've made this several times and the whole family loves it.  I do cube up the chicken and get that cooked through with garlic salt and pepper and I usually add a bit more cajun spice and lime juice than called for to our liking and typically serve over egg noodles.  Plan on making again tonight!

I liked it ALOT.  Really easy, and IF you follow the recipe then it will turn out just fine.  I used "slap yo mama" cajun seasoning, and only added some red pepper flakes, we like it spicy!  Will definitely make again.

I love this easy and delicious recipe. I prefer to grill the chicken. I ran out of creole seasoning the last time I made it and just seasoned the chicken with what I had on hand. It was just as good to me.

My family didn't care much for this, but my main complaint is: Being from the NOLA area, this is NOT in any way "Creole". Cajun and Creole are two different things, and this is neither. Just because you sprinkle some Cajun seasoning on some food doesn't make it Cajun, and it certainly doesn't make it Creole. Just because I put a slice of tomato on top of my apple Struedel doesn't mean I should call it Tiramisu.

Pretty tasty.  I couldn't see any way to "stir in" the sour cream with the chicken being in the sauce, so I stirred it into the fettuccine that I used instead of rice.  That worked pretty well.  I served this with collard greens and corn bread and it was very well received.

Used one less breast since I don't think the writer took the monster chickens wal-mart is producing these days. 

The sauce came out good but will probably add onions next time and use rotel instead of just green chilis. 

Definitely let it sit for about 5 mins after its done to let the sauce thicken.

This is a very thick sauce, so I used a can of rotel and added milk instead of water to the consistency we like. I also added garlic powder, season salt and extra lime juice. After the additions it was awesome! Good kick to it! I also doubled the sauce recipe.

I made this today. i read the other reviews and i doubled the soup, i added diced jalapeños and lots of sour cream. The sour cream is what really makes this dish taste really good. also, i added canned mushrooms. i originally tried it with angel haired pasta, it was good but i felt like something was missing, so i added a lil more sour cream  and decided to eat it with rice instead of the pasta and it was soo good...ill be making this again

This was good, although I was somewhat skeptical at the first bite. I'm a huge green chile fan, but they just seemed strange in this dish. Husband and children absolutely loved it, though, so I rated 4 stars.

I loved this and didn't even use the full 2 teaspoons of creole seasonings or the chiles because of the kids. I did add some chopped pepperoncini to mine once it was on the plate. This was outstanding, though I'll have to make it next time without the flour because I'm gluten-intolerent and threw caution to the wind. Not the best move on my part. Hoping it's just as delicious when I make it with a flour substitute.
