I couldn't get this recipe to come out well--it seemed to need more flour (as much as a cup more).  Without the flour, the dough puddled into a gooey mess and spread out to the side of the baking sheeet.

Delicious cookies.. they do need more flour. Add the flour and let the dough sit a little. The chocolate does absorb quite a bit of it.  I was lazy and made these into bars.. baked for about 20-25 minutes..
