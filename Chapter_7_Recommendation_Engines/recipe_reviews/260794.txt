I just wanted to point out that mutton is NOT goat but sheep! We don't eat goat in my house so I won't be making this. One star for calling goat mutton!

Very delicate, complex and appealing flavors. 
I did not have access to the curry leaves but after some research decided on substituting it with a combination of fresh Basil leaves and the zest of a lime. Not knowing the original taste it still works fine for me.
