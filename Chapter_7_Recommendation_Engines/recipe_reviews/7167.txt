I love these!  The first time I followed the recipe exactly, the second time I added about 3/4 cup of walnuts and substituted applesauce for half the oil.  Very moist either way!  One of my favorite "zucchini bread" recipes.

These were great!  I used a cup of apple sauce instead of the oil and cut the sugar in half to make them a little healthier.

I changed it a bit, since I didn't have cardamom on hand~ doubled the cinnamon instead.  I also did half brown/half white sugar and it still turned out great.

My children loved these muffins.  I did make one change.  There was too much oil for my taste, so I used 1/2 cup oil plus 2 mashed ripe bananas.  Very moist and nicely spiced muffins.

Delicious!  My family didn't even know there was zucchini in it.  They were very moist.  I did not add the spices, because I personally don't like spices mixed with chocolate.  The muffins tasted great without them.

These were pretty good. I made a lot of changes to the recipe, though, so I'm not sure how the original recipe tasted. I substituted 1 cup sugar for 1 cup splenda, 1/2 cup flax meal for 1/2 cup flour, and 1/4 cup olive oil for 1/4 cup vegetable oil. I also added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and 1/2 cup chopped chocolate. The ending result was a great tasting and moist muffin. The only thing I wish a hadn't done was use the olive oil, because it gave the muffins a funny taste.

These were a big thumbs up.  Yummy!  I didn't have enough cocoa so I added a few chocolate chips to the batter and sprinkled a few on top before baking.

The muffins were okay, but nothing special.  The chocolate taste was barely noticeable, in fact.  A bit on the dry side as well, though that was partially my fault for reducing the amount of oil (1 cup just seemed like a LOT!).
If I make this recipe again, I'll double the cocoa, and sub applesauce for part of the oil to keep them moist.

A little dry, nothing spectacular.  A good use of excess zucchini but not my first choice of zucchini bread.  
The kids did eat it and request more - always a good sign!  I will make it again with the following modifications:  reduce flour by 1/3 cup, increase spices, sub applesauce for all or part of the oil.

I made a few changes in the recipe.  I used applesauce instead of oil, and 1/2 cup honey instead of sugar.  I also soaked my flour and cocoa in the applesauce and shredded zucchini overnight.  The next day I whipped the eggs and honey until fluffy before adding the remaining ingredients.  I added the baking soda and powder last and let it sit until it was thick. Again with this recipe I ended up making only 18 muffins instead of 24.  I like my muffins big and fluffy I guess.  The muffins were super moist and so good. I hope to get more zucchini this summer so I can make this recipe many more times. Thanks.

Wow, these are some of the best muffins I've ever made.  I'm confused by the negative reviews!  They were sooo delicious, my whole family devoured them.  I did make many changes.  I used all whole wheat pastry flour instead of white flour, I replaced half the oil with mashed bananas, I replaced one of the eggs with zucchini liquid (I had frozen grated zuvvhini, which when thawed has a liquid), I used melted palm oil instead of vegetable oil, I increased the cocoa powder by just a bit, I used sucanat instead of white sugar and cut the amount down to 1.5 C, I used a combination of grated carrot and zucchini since I didn't have enough zucchini, I doubled the cinnamon since I didn't have cardamom, and I added about 2/3C of raw sunflower seeds (I was unsure about this but it proved to be a great addition!).  They were moist and flavorful.  Also, many reviewers mentioned that there was a lot of oil, I have two comments about that.  #1 - This is a recipe for 24 muffins, so the numbers do look a little higher; #2 - there is no liquid in this recipe.  Most muffin recipes call for milk or juice, so I think you could replace some of the oil (or eggs, as I did...btw 1/4C liquid = 1 egg) with milk.  Thanks for the great recipe!  We'll be making this a lot.

Excellent treat that I feel good about feeding my kids. I wanted to point and laugh at my kids while they were wolfing these down for being foolish enough to be tricked into eating zucchini! I only had 2 zucchini (not enough for a full batch) so I made a 1/2 batch using 2 eggs. Also used half white/half brown sugar and half oil/half unsweetened applesauce for taste and calorie reduction. Used apple pie spice in place of the spice combo listed. These came out so moist and delicious and did not need anything on top (although these would make great frosted cupcakes!)

Good :)  I am a huge fan of sweet and chocolate muffins, so it is quite a change... but I liked it! Just need to get use to it! Like others, I used applesauce instead of oil and add a little bit of chocolate chips. It taste just like a zucchini bread but in little muffin cups.

This is my 1st time using zucchini, and while I spent the whole time asking myself if I was doing it right..(was it ripe yet, how big should the grate be, do I press out the juice or keep it.., oh  there's seeds inside) once that joy was over I got to the fun part. I made two subs cuz I couldn't wait to go to the store. I used 1/2cp olive oil, 1/2 cp applesauce. I don't own cardamom/cloves, so I upped the cinnamon/nutmeg and added a bit of ginger. I knew these would be eaten around breakfast time so I opted to cut sugar down a bit: 3/4cp white sugar & 1/2cp brown sugar. I threw in some mini choc. chips & sprinkled a few on top. A few had mentioned dryness being an issue or not enough cocoa flavor so I used dutch process cocoa but same qty as recipe called for. The added mini chips (very little bit) added to the flavor. These were flavorful, very moist and chocolatey. Can't wait to make them again. Shared with neighbor across hall who gave me the zucchini. She came over an hour later with Paula Dean's zucchini bread! I'm in carb heaven :)

I rarely review things and certainly NEVER after modifying but I thought this was soooo worth it! I used dark chocolate cocoa powder, 3/4 C. oil, 1/4 C. applesauce (HUGE, healthy change, eh?) and then added chocolate chunks and walnuts. I also skipped the nutmet through cardamom based on personal preference. Oh how I LOVED these!!! I have zucchini running out my ears and am SICK to death of fried zucchini, gratins, and quick breads. I pretty much destroyed any nutritional value these had but what a fantastic snack. Next time, I'm going to skip the cinnamon all together and add 2 TBSP of espresso powder to enchance the chocolate flavor. This is going in "my favorite bones" section of of my favorite recipe's binder.

I love this recipe and have made it many times.  The first time it was a little dry and not chocolatey enough, so now I always add chocolate chips to the batter and it comes out perfect.  I never use the cardamom because I don't have any on hand, but it doesn't need it.  I also use whole wheat flour.

Yummy chocolate muffins, kids didn't even notice zucchini :). Increased cocoa to 1/2c, baking powder to 1tsp and added 1c choco chips.  Less spice next time for kiddos.

These were fabulous.  To make a little healthier, I substituted 1 cup of unsweetened apple sauce instead of oil and used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of Splenda brown sugar.  They were awesome.  Unless you made them, you would NEVER know they were made with vegetables.  I also used large muffin tins and spray rather than paper liners. Made 12 large muffins.

I have looked for a good chocolate muffin that isn't bland or dry for a while now. This one is it!! LOVE IT! I did take a few suggestions from other reviews. The only things that I changed was used 1/2 c. cocoa powder, 1 tsp baking powder& added 1 c. chocolate chips. 
They are amazing!

These are quite good and they were moist. Didn't have cardamon, instead I used "all spice". For the next time, I'm going to add a little more of "spices" maybe 1/4 tsp ginger and I'm going to make sure I have the cardamon.

Yum! What a great way to get veggies into my kids! Just tweaked it a little to try & make it a bit more healthy: 1-1/2c. whole wheat flour, 1-1/2 c. white, applesauce instead of oil.  Also 1c. white, 1 c. brown sugar, 1/2 c. cocoa powder, & doubled the spices. Delish!  Thank you!

The only changes I made to the recipe were to add only one cup of sugar, 1/2 cup of cocoa, and I probably added around 3 cups of zucchini.  Either my zucchini's were dry or I should of used less flour, but the dough was extremely tricky to mix.  I was mixing it by hand, so I would imagine that I wouldn't have that problem if I had a good kitchen aid mixer (which I don't).  I added a bit of milk to the batter to properly mix it.  Once the dough became exposed to heat, the batter melted perfectly and the muffins turned out moist and delicious.  The end product was great, it's just the dough was a little tricky.

Not sure if I did something wrong -- although I followed the recipe to the letter -- but I would never make these again. Really mediocre. Dry, stunted looking, so-so flavour. Not a keeper, sorry!

Excellent recipe!  I substituted half the oil with applesauce and added a little extra zucchini.  Did 1/4 cup cocoa powder and 6 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate chips.   No cloves or cardamon, but did added a little extra cinnamon.  Sprinkled a mixture of oats, brown sugar and butter on top.   I had to bake them for 25 minutes and leave them in the pan for another 30 minutes but they turned out perfect!

"Deadly" was what my family said about these.  I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, I used half white and half whole wheat flour, and I added chopped walnuts and a couple of handfuls of chocolate chips.  I'll make these again for sure!

These were a hit, though I thought it was a little dry. I also didn't tell people there was zucchini in them, just so they would give them a try. Everyone liked it.

Good. I did feel that these were a bit overspiced, however. I expected the spices to compliment the chocolate flavor, but instead they overwhelmed it. I'd make these again, but cut down a bit on the nutmeg, cloves, and cardamom. Thanks :)

I didn't like this very much. It was my first time making them. I made a first batch of 12 and thought they needed more chocolate, so I threw a bunch of chocolate chips to the mixture. They were OK but I don't think I'd make them again.

My family loves these! I do 1 of the cups of flour as wheat & the oil is melted coconut oil since we don't use vegetable. So good! 
I bake 1 tray of 12 muffins & freeze the other tray of 12 (unbaked). Whenever we want muffins, we just put them in the oven still frozen- takes about the same amount of time to bake :)

Absolutely delicious!!  Made a half batch as I wasn't sure how my veggie averse son would take to them.....had no clue there was even zucchini in them!!  Mine turned out pretty dense, and I substituted 1 cup of applesauce for the oil.  Used 2 eggs and added Choco chips to the mix.  Used cinnamon as the only spice as I just didn't have the others.  And I didn't measure it, just dumped some in.  Will definitely make again, thank you!!!

Chocolate Zucchini Muffin Haiku: "Oh so tasty good! I took submitter's ideas, and changed a few things." I didn't feel guilty about altering/adding, as the submitter of the recipe gave some nice suggestions in his description, so I ended up doing half brown/half white sugar, added chocolate chips on top, as well as halving the oil and including apple sauce. These were incredibly moist and wonderful right from the oven, and just as great the next day lightly-toasted w/ butter. My daughter, a rabid despiser of zucchini, devoured these enthusiastically.

Nice zucchini muffins.  I cut the recipe in half to yield 12 muffins, and then used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce to reduce the fat.  Next time, I would keep the cocoa powder in the original amount as these weren't as chocolatey as we were hoping for. I also omitted the cardamom, as I don't have that spice.  This is a great way to use up zucchini and "hide" it from your kids.

Very good!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The muffins were moist and tasty.  I could not really taste the spices... would not have known spices were in it, if I were not the one who made them.  Also didn't really taste the zucchini. I might try doubling the spices next time and maybe using walnut oil for the oil.  Another tasty addition might be a little dry instant expresso/ coffee.

We made these last night with our Zucchini from our garden and they were yummy. We did a double batch and used wheat flour for 1/3 of the flour. Double batch made 24 muffins and two loaves. We are taking the muffins to an event tonight so we sprinkled some chocolate chips on the top of the muffins and they came out really cute. And I didn't have ground cloves or cardamon on hand, but I had pumpkin spice which had those in it plus nutmeg and it was good.

I didn't tell my children there was zucchini in them.  After having a muffin they told me that it was "The Best" muffin I had ever made for them.  And "when was I making them again?"  It is now in my rotation.  I did reduce the sugar and oil by half and added a cup of regular applesauce (sweetened) and 1/4 cup of chocolate chips.  May try to add a banana next time just to play with different flavors.

I literally JUST pulled these out of the oven.  I bought some Muffin Top liners today and made about 30.  I did swap out 1/2 the oil with 2 mashed bananas. reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup and added a bit more of the spices. So So yummy.

These muffins are delicious and an excellent treat in the school lunchbox. I like the fact they have a vegetable in them.  I have made some modifications to the recipe.  Instead of all the different spices, I just use All Spice and Mixed Spice...to total the same quantity as the 4 individual spices listed.  Additionally I add Saltanas or Raisins.  This recipe works really well and if baking in Mini Muffin Tins only bake for about 10-12 Minutes.  If baking in regular muffin tins, I find 20 minutes is enough.  Poke with a skewer and if it comes out clean, they are done.  Definately a highly recommended recipe.

Thought they tasted great.  I baked mine in a mini muffin pan and they turned out a little dry and flat-topped, probably cooked them a little too long.  Will try again and hope for better results.

This recipe was pretty good. But I felt there was something missing. So, after baking my first set of mini muffins I decided to double the cocoa and add half a cup of sour cream. They were much better this way.

We love these muffins and have shared this recipe with many people!  I didn't have cardamon so I added allspice instead and increased the cinnamon to a full teaspoon.  I also added one 10-12 oz. bag of vanilla chips and 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips.  This recipe makes a big batch and our friends, neighbors and relatives all love it when we make and share.  This recipe works equally as well with 2 cups of pumpkin or 2-3 ripe bananas.

Great muffins...very moist. I did not add the cloves or cardamom as I did not have any. The only thing I would change next time is to add a bit more cinnamon and nutmeg. Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good, but needs a topping or frosting.  I added extra cocoa and used applesauce with the oil.  I also decided to throw in a packet of breakfast nutrition shake mix (1 servings worth).  Don't know if that makes for extra nutrition or what.

Made just a few minor changes - I cut the oil to 3/4 cup and doubled the cinnamon because I didn't have cardamom.  Very good.  This is the second time I've made these and I have a request for more.  Tasty way to use up some of that zucchini.

These are very tasty.  I used half the sugar and added some ground flax seed and a little almond meal to make up some of the difference in solid ingredients.  I also used a melted stick of 50/50 butter/ canola oil in place of the oil to reduce calories.  I used whole wheat pastry flour for added fiber.  And finally, I doubled the spices, and it could have used even more!

I loved these!  I made them today.  I used organic coconut oil instead of vegetable oil to make them a little more healthier.  I also did not have cardamom and did like someone else did, and doubled up on the cinnamon.  I also doubled up on the other spices - sort of by accident!  They were delicious.  I will make these over and over!

Very tasty!  I did not have cardamom so just left that out.  I had closer to 3 cups of zucchini so I added an extra cup of flour but left everything else the same.  I'll be making these again!

Really good! I changed it up a bit, based on the ingredients I had on hand. Used shredded carrot instead of Zuch, and more than doubled the cocoa. I think if you don't, the muffins really wouldn't have any chocolate taste. Left the rest of the recipe the same, didn't add any extra liquid, found it just thick enough. Might try it without the spices next time, but really good with also! A keeper for my recipe box-thanks!

Great muffin. Dense, chewy texture.  Not dry whatsoever.  I didn't have the cardamom or cloves, but that would have made them even better. The cinnamon with the chocolate is incredibly good.  I subbed coconut oil and butter for the veggie oil and they turned out amazing.  I'll make these again for sure.

I added chocolate chips, otherwise I followed rec. I called them hockey pucks because they didn't rise at all and seemed a little dense, but wow they were great.

These were wonderful. I made half a batch, used 1/2 c sugar and 2 c  grated squash. I had to add a little milk because the batter was thick. I also added 1 cup chocolate chips. Wow. They tasted almost like cake they were so light and fluffy. I would recommend this recipe.

These were okay for me, but hubs refused to take more than one bite. I chose this recipe thinking it was a good way to hide veggies from the hubs. Trust me, this recipe hides nothing. You can see the zucchini, and smell the zucchini. It didn't fool anyone (you should have seen the "look" I got) even after trying to cover the evidence with chocolate frosting. Now if you're a  zucchini muffin/chocolate lover, this is your recipe to try.

These muffins were pretty good.  The whole family enjoyed them.  I only gave it 4 stars because they were a little on the bland side, - kind of like cake without the icing.

Yum! These were all gone by the morning after I made them.  I didn't change anything about the recipe, it was great.  I think I will try adding chocolate chips next time though, we love chocolate.

I never rate recipes but had to on this one because it is so boring. I have eaten and love choc/zucchini baking all of my life and this is a waste of ingredients. I made them to share at my son's soccer camp tomorrow. Keep looking!!

I thought this recipe was fabulous.  I made with Baking Splenda and used half of the oil and half applesauce.  I also cut the recipe in half to make 12 nice, plump muffins.  I think I may try adding choc. chips next time, but they were great...Kudo's to Larry.

When asked how many starts should we rate this recipe, my daughter replied "Lots!"  I concur.  We added the chocolate chips suggested, as well as half oil - half applesauce, and used pumpkin pie spice for the various individual spices listed.  Added a bit more flour because it looked too thin.  Only problem is that it's going to be a few more days until the next batch of zucchini ripen in the garden to make more muffins.  )-:

This turned out great! Super moist and tasty! I melted Scharffenberger semi-sweet chocolate (4 oz), and subbed 1/8 cup of stevia for sugar, 1 cup applesauce for oil, and about 2.5 cups equal parts white rice flour and spelt flour. I left out the cardamom. I baked it as a loaf for 40 mins instead of muffins. Next time, I will double the grated zucchini. My pickiest eater loved it!  Really delicious!

I would add chocolate chips and walnuts and cut the sugar in half next time. My kids loved it however. Just a little too sweet and not chocolate enough for me. I will try again with these changes.

Wow, I made these and they were just AMAZINGLY good. I made some adjustments - I used whole wheat flour instead and reduced the amount by about 1/4 cup than what the recipe called for. Instead of sugar, I used honey, about 1 3/4 cup. I also lessened the oil by half, which probably made up for the liquid honey that was used instead of sugar. Then, I doubled all the spice amounts and added one more teaspoon of cocoa. I wanted it rich and spicy. So good! Highly recommend.

The spices with the zucchini and chocolate just didn't work well together.  Maybe too many contrasting tastes going on?  I would leave out the spices if I was to make it again.

This is an amazing recipe. chocolaty and moist.I did tweak it just a bit. For the flour I used 1 cup flax seed meal, and a 1/2c each of almond flour, white flour, wheat flour, and oatmeal. I also used a 1/2 c cocoa based on other reviews and omitted the spices (personal preference). I have a batch in the oven right now that has coconut flakes in it. Can't wait for them to be done! :)

I made these today to help use up some of the zucchini that our neighbors keep gifting us (I love Summer!) I subbed half the oil for applesauce (I might try subbing all of it next time) and allspice for the cloves and cardamom (I didn't have any on hand).  It turned out really delicious and my two little boys (4 and 2) are currently being tricked into eating zucchini for breakfast :)  I think a little bit of chocolate chips in the mix might make it a little bit sweeter, and I also meant to add some walnuts, but I forgot.  I think it would add a nice texture (and some good protein!) to these muffins.

This was a great recipe.  I was really impressed by how moist the muffins came out.  I also got exactly 24 muffins like the recipe said it yielded.  The only things that I changed were I substituted a half cup of unsweetened applesauce for half cup of the oil.  I used a canola oil blend which made them a bit healthier.  Since I didn't have cardamom I used allspice.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and added a few chocolate chips to the top of each muffin.  They turned out yummy!  I can't wait to have some for breakfast this week!

Followed recipe as written except I put chocolate chips in the 2nd batch of 12 muffins. I found all the muffins rather dry with not a lot of flavor.  I didn't like adding a whole cup of oil but did it anyway. I thought about not making these again but I think I will try one more time substituting apple sauce for part of the oil and heaping the amounts of the spices to get more flavor.  Maybe adding choc. chips again. If after that they aren't good, then I will definitely move on.

Delicious muffins!  I substituted 1/2 oil for applesauce.  I put in 1/2 white flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour plus 2Tbsp. Omega Hearts(hulled hemp seeds).  I just used cinnamon but put in 1 tsp.  also I substituted almond flavoring for vanilla.  Be sure and try almond flavoring sometime as it is a lovely combination with chocolate.

This was a very good muffin that I made gluten free. I added 1 1/4 tsp xanthan gum and substituted applesauce for the oil. I also used the sugar/stevia baking blend (1 cup) and added about 1/3 c flaxseed (ground) to make it more nutritious. I baked in silicone muffin cups since these work better for GF flours, and they turned out yummy and beautiful! I gave four stars simply because this recipe can be made a lot healthier with these simple substitutions. Perfect chocolate amount.

Trying to use up the bounty of zucchini and this one is a winner. I didn't have all the spices, so I increased the cinnamon and added a handful of cherry tomatoes with the eggs and oil and cut out about 1/4 cup of oil...shhhhh, don't tell! Hubby thinks they are super yummy!!!

Since there are only two of us, I cut the recipe in half but pretty much followed it and made zucchini bread instead of muffins so I had to adjust the cooking time. It turned out moist and delicious.  The only thing I would change is to add some pecans next time.

This is a wonderful treat. My husband loves chocolate and is very picky about it. He ate 3 muffins immediatly after they came out of the oven. I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the muffin instead of on top.

I made these, but with brown sugar instead of white & non-bleached flour & no cardamom (I don't think I've ever had that in my cupboards...) and I put ...CRANBERRIES! in them - very delicious!

Good moist muffin. Not very chocolatey. I would probably add another tblspn of cocoa. 

Used 3x baking powder as we had no baking soda. Turned out fine.

Delicious. Cut the amount of oil in half (I used overgrown zucchini, which have more moisture) and skipped most of the spices except the cinnamon. Also added chocolate chips on top of each muffin.

This is a great base recipe - easy to play around with.  Like a lot of other reviewers, I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 regular flour.  I cut the sugar by 1/4 cup and substituted 1/2 of the oil with applesauce.  I also added milk chocolate chips.  These are yummy, and the house smells wonderful while they are baking.

I love this recipe.  As a mum of a very fussy eater, I am constantly trying to find ways of sneaking veg and fruit into any kind of cake or bread. I used whole wheat flour and left out all the spices.  I also halved the quantity as trial first and honestly thought it would not work, but they came out beautifully!!!  I'll definitely make more of these and try exchanging some of the oil for applesauce next time.

Nice, subtle chocolate taste and not too sweet.  However, I used 1/2c oil and 2 mashed bananas (no applesauce on hand), half the sugar, and 1/2 t cinnamon since I had no cardamon.

My kids loved these muffins!  I added chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, and a streussel topping and they were great.  Nice and moist.  Even my husband liked them and he won't eat any other zucchini bread.

The spices did not over power the chocolate in this recipe (which was a concern of mine).  It enhanced it nicely.  My son and husband enjoyed these very much.  I used frozen zucchini that I put up last fall.  I was concerned because when I defrosted my zucchini there was a lot of liquid in the bag but I added it to the mix anyway and the muffins were delicious.    This is one of the first recipes that I did not make ANY changes to after baking the first time.

Substantial muffin is filling as breakfast or as a snack.  I left out the nutmeg and added about a 1/3 cup mini chocolate chips.  After filling the muffin tins, I sprinkled additional chocolate chips on top before baking.  Muffins were just a bit dry, but still quite tasty. At first, the kids were put off knowing they had zucchini but once tasted, enjoyed them entirely.  I will make these again.

Really good zucchini recipe.  I used all applesauce(unsweetened)and used half Splenda for the sugar and used allspice for the spices except the cinnamon.  I also added chopped walnuts and a few chocolate chips.  YUMMY!

Very good. I added mini chocolate chips to the batter and the tops of the muffins. My tops were pretty flat, but that's fairly typical for me so I wouldn't blame it on the recipe. I used a little cinnamon and left out the rest of the spices. Thanks for the recipe!

these get 4 stars because I did not really follow the recipe exactly.  I may have loved it if I had - but I just can't find it in myself to use a whole cup of oil in my baking.  I followed the recommendation to sub 2 bananas for 1/2 cup of the oil.  They were still very moist and I could definitely taste the banana in the muffin.

Fantastic!  I added some chocolate chips and my kids couldn't get enough of them.  I have two picky eaters when it comes to breakfast and I didn't mention the zucchini part - they never knew the difference and they asked for more.

Great recipe. I did not have the nutmeg, cloves or cardamom but they were still great!  As a matter of fact, I took these camping and the muffins that were left from the day before were stolen overnight (by animal or by another camper I do not know)!!!

I loved these, didn't change a thing and they came out perfect!  Only one person didn't care for them, but she does not like Cardamom nor Cinnamon so her loss!  What a great way to help use all of that zucchini out in the garden!

A little bland. Next time I am going to add some chocolate chips for a little extra sweetness and flavor.

Yummy!  These muffins are perfect.  They are moist, soft, rich, and full of flavor.  I sprinkled a couple of chocolate chips on top of each muffin.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

It didn't taste like chocolate.  The cocoa powder didn't have enough kick to it.   It was on the dry side.

A yummy recipe with a chocolate pudding kind of flavour. 

My son has an egg allergy so we made 'flax eggs'  and the recipe still worked perfectly. 

For a flax egg just mix ground flax seeds with water and wait 5 or so minutes until it's got some gel-like egg consistency. 

I made them into mini muffins with no liners. Worked great. Baked at 350 for 18 min. I made them and gave my son two. I went in my office to do some work and came back and he had snuck and ate SIX MORE! He said he couldn't resist because they were so good. Needless to say...belly ache :)

These were a big hit at home and work. Will definitely make this again. I did substitute 1/2 cup of applesauce for 1/2 cup of sugar. Also I had no cardamom so i used a dash of coriander. Everyone liked these.

Good base! I made the following changes in my second batch: 
half the sugar (1c)
double the cocoa powder (2/3c)
half the oil (1/2c)
add 1/2c vanilla Greek yogurt
omit vanilla (by mistake but turned out great!). My 2 zucchini was a little bit more than 2 cups but I used it all. Maybe 1/4c extra. 
1 TBS cinnamon and 1/2 TBS pumpkin pie seasoning in lieu of all the other spices.

Turned out PERFECT! Next time I may add dark chocolate chips but no other changes. My 6 kids gobbled them up!

I found these to be very dry, with very little flavour.  My kids didn't like them either.  I see some people used apple sauce,  maybe that would have helped with the dryness.  I won't be making these again.

Turned out great! The only changes I made was omitting the spices, increasing the cocoa to 1/2 Cup, and added 1 Cup of chocolate chips.  I would not advise  reducing the amount of oil as that is a pretty standard amount for this size recipe and would tend to make the muffins a little dry.

These muffins are delicious and a welcome change from standard zucchini bread. I left out cardamom because I don't have it and didn't feel it necessary.  I've made them twice now.

Used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown, not as much nutmeg and no cardamom , filled muffin cups and a small loaf. Next time definitely double recipe to make a nice large loaf as well as muffins, and will maybe add mini chocolate chips!
September 5/16 made three dozen today, this time put in a pinch of cardamom and will freeze some and see how they taste after frozen and thawed

I have made this muffin recipe for years.   Realized I never gave a review!   Fantastic for freezing.  I have done it with and without the chocolate.   I have added two bananas when I needed to use them.  I have doubled the recipe and made 2 dozen regular muffins and 6 jumbos. I have a convection oven now and I cook all 24 muffins together at 350, they usually take 5 mins less.  Love this recipe bc you dont have to set out butter to soften and I get rid of at least one zucchini!

I loved it. I have a little one who's an extreme picky eater and he devours these cupcakes. For a more chocolaty flavor I duplicate the chocolate and vanilla measurements.

I'm not sure if you can take my star rating because I altered this recipe quite a bit! First, I adjusted the servings to make 8 servings because I was going to test a few ingredient swaps.
I used 1 egg, 10 pitted dates (in place of sugar), and 1/3 cup apple sauce (in place of oil).  I blended those in my Vitamin until fairly smooth. I then added 2/3 cup shredded zucchini, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, and 2 TBSP dark cocoa powder. Mix those up well. 
Then, I added 1/4 cup almond flour and a scant 1/2 cup white flour. I added 1/4 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1/4 tsp salt, and kept the rest of the spices the same (all 1/4 tsp each). Instead of adding chocolate chips to the batter, I added 3 TBSP of a chopped Toblerone bar I had laying around. 
I baked as directed in a muffin tin greased with a small amount of coconut oil. 

These were excellent! Not too sweet and they ended up making 9 muffins + 1 small one at 90 calories each! A great treat and one that I feel good about indulging in- thank you for this recipe!

I have made these muffins a bunch of times. This is a recipe that really stands up to people like me who are incapable of making a recipe exactly as is. I NEVER use the amount of sugar called for, nor the amount of oil. I've always used at least 3/4 cup of white sugar, and up to 1/2 cup of agave or honey, and I usually use 1/2 applesauce or pumpkin, and 1/2 oil. I've never had cardamom, but I do add the other spices. These are my favourite muffins to make, and I always get 24 mini muffins and 12 full size muffins. They always rise nicely.

This is really good.  I used whole wheat flour and only 1 cup of sugar.  I made a double batch and added 1/2 cup chocolate chips to one batch, and 1/2 cup walnut pieces to the other.  Great snack.

Our whole family really liked these including the kids. We didn't have the cardamon but everything else. They are especially good as mini muffins, we found.

I got a great muffin riffing off this recipe. 
I halved the sugar, substituted coconut oil for veg oil, and used 1.5 cups almond floud + 1.5 cups whole wheat flour. Yummy!

I decreased the sugar to just over a cup.  used applesauce instead of oil.  half a cup of cocoa instead of chocolate.  I also added a third cup of sour cream because I had some I needed to use.  this recipe made 24 muffins and baked for 30 minutes.

These came out very well and is a good use of the zucchini in your garden.  I added some chocolate chips and walnuts just as a personal preference.

I didn't know if I'd like the combination of spices but they're delicious. I didn't have any zucchini so I used 1c shredded carrot and 1c shredded coconut. I made them healthier by using some whole wheat flour and applesauce instead of the oil. I made mini muffins and they were ready in only 12 mins. I added some dark chocolate chips on top prior to baking. Wow these turned out uh-mazing! My 3yr old loves them and so does my husband.

I was short on zucchini, so I used a shredded apple, and like many people I cut the oil with 1/2 applesauce and left out the spices (except cinnamon) to appeal to my kids. It worked well! They were very moist an this is the first zucchini bread anything that my kids will eat. The adults liked them too.

Always check the reviews for great advice.  I added a mashed banana and only 1/2 the oil to minimize the fat but still keep the moistness; 3/4 c brown & 3/4 c white sugar instead of 2c white sugar only. Omitted the ground clove and added 1/4 c mini chocolate chips and 1/4 c chopped pecans. The almond meal I have, needed to be used so I substituted one cup of the flour with that. Mini muffins were baked for 15 minutes - I made half regular, half mini for variety.  The football print muffin liners were so cute that it just kicks it up a notch.

Great, versatile recipe. I found the original recipe a little too sweet and oily for my taste, but on second try I discovered you can half the sugar, reduce oil/add zucchini, add chocolate chips, and sub 1 c almond flour for all purpose if you like. The spices are a nice blend -- love the cardamom!

These are okay. Think I would add chiocolate chip. I did substitute bananas for some of the oil, and used 1 cup whole wheat flour, one cup cake flour and one cup white flour. They are nice an fluffy and moist. Just a bit bland for me.

Super recipe!  I substitute half the sugar with brown sugar, half the flour with whole wheat pastry flour, and add a tsp. each of cinnamon, allspice, cardamom and nutmeg to give it a little zing.  VERY flavorful and moist results!  This is a most requested recipe in my house and at work.

A big hit at our pre-school co-op.
Here were my substitutions: 
* For 1 egg, I subbed 1 T chia seeds and 3 T water. (I soaked the chia seeds in the water briefly before adding.)  The bread recipe I used yesterday worked w/ 1 egg and 2 "chia eggs;" this probably would too.  
* For the oil, I subbed 1/2 C applesauce (unsweetened) and 1/2 C oil
* I reduced the sugar to about 1 1/4 C. 
* I did not add any of the toppings suggested.  

Bake time was 20 mn for the smaller ones in the metal tin, and 25 for the larger silicone ones.

I took the advice of a couple of reviewers, but even tried to make this recipe a little healthier. To that end, I substituted half the oil with applesauce, added two tablespoons of ground flax seed, 3/4 c chopped walnuts, and used white whole wheat flour, and brown sugar. These muffins are still quite moist and delicious, even with these adjustments!

For those missing the chocolate, add about 2 TBSP of cold brewed COFFEE... Enhances chocolate, doesn't taste like coffee, I promise. (if you're not a coffee drinker, keep a can of instant in your freezer for recipes). I used 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice in place of the four spices, but only to save steps. This is a KEEPER recipe, thanks for sharing!!

This recipe is great!  Perfect as is and freezes well.  I have also made it and baked in a bread pan for about 45 minutes.  My kids love it and don't even notice the zucchini.

I thought these were great.  I used half whole wheat pastry flour and I used half  "pear" sauce (same as applesauce except I made it from pears) and half oil. Next time I will try to use even more of the whole wheat and more of the apple/pear sauce to see if I can't get it healthier.  Definately a keeper for me!

Pretty tasty!  My two year old ate 3 in one sitting :)  Here's the changes I recommend:  applesauce instead of oil, molasses instead of sugar, and 1/2 cup flax meal substituted for 1/2 cup flour.  I dropped chocolate chips on top and baked around 30 minutes.  Yum!

I added two cups of carrots, subbed the oil out for butter, added slightly less than 2 cups of sugar, and half of the flour is whole wheat.  I think I will add 1/2 cup of yogurt next time because maybe the carrots took some moisture out.  Oh and I added five dark chocolate chips to each one.  My kids love them!

My rating is based on the recipe itself and not with substitutions, which then would give it a 4/5, I think. These were really good after I followed many other reviewers' suggestions. I doubled the spices and cocoa, and doubled the baking powder/soda as well. Even so, the muffins are fairly dense, don't rise much, and the batter really could use a little thinning out. I was tempted to add a little milk, but didn't. Maybe next time. The flavour with the spices doubled is excellent. I might add even another cup of zucchini next time.  I also used half white and half brown sugar. And for those that think a cup of oil is a lot, don't forget the recipe is for 24 muffins, and that really is a negligible amount *per muffin.*  Because I was nearly out, I used half vegetable oil, and half light olive oil. I am not sure if this mix would differ from one cup of veg, but I found the muffins quite dry even with a cup of oil. As I expected, storing them in an airtight container and letting them mellow together did help moisten them up somewhat. Good base recipe, just needed some tweaking to up the rating.  My kids loved them.

I made a double batch with only 3 cups sugar instead of 4,added chopped walnuts and used whole wheat flour and I also added semisweet and milk chocolate chips to the top before baking. These were awesome, not too sweet, moist and had a wonderful spicey flavor!!! Shared with neighbors and friends, next time I will freeze some :)

My toddler loves them!  I used 2/3 whole wheat pastry flour and could have gotten away with all.  So good!

These came out dry and to "clove" tasting for us. My kids really liked them though, so that's a plus!
