I was looking for a recipe with edamame when I found this one. I made this salad and served it with scoop chips like a chunky salsa idea. I skipped the starch and went all veggies with some pickled beets and I used an Asian ginger dressing. Everyone loved it. This is my first quinoa salad and it the recipe was a great outline with lots of possibilities. Thank you!

Oops. Hit the done button by accident. As for the dressing, my husband can't digest the onion and garlic so I blended them into the dressing ingredients and then strained it. I also subbed in feta cheese for goat as that was what was on hand.
