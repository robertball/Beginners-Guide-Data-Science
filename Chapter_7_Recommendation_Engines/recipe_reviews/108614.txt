I grew up with these in Puerto Rico, we call them Platanutres (Pla-tah-noo-trays). The thinner you can slice the plantain, the better; I have used a mandolin-type slicer in the thinnest setting possible. You can do it with a sharp knife, but it takes forever and can be tricky.  We also sometimes let them stand in salty water for 10-15 min and drain them well before frying but if you do that you have to dry them off or you could have hot oil splatter everywhere. Make sure you fry them until crisp without overbrowning. If the plantain has started to turn (rippen), the flavor will be sweeter. If it feels soft, it is too ripe for this recipe - you can fry it, but it will be a different texture and flavor.

my green plantain crisped nicer and was easier to cut uniformly, while the yellow plantain was softer, sweeter and cooked a darker brown and remained chewy.  although these differences occured both are still fantastic to eat!

These things are popular in Honduran cuisine. We call them tajadas. A great way to eat them, is by serving a seasoned ground beef mixture  (diced potatoes, bell peppers, etc) over them with sprinkled white cheese and a nice salsa, and pickled red onion.

Excellent.  Just returned from Cuba and we enjoyed them at the beach side restaurant.  I am thrilled to make them at home.  I followed the recipe to the tee and they were just like in Cuba.

Just made these tonight 8/25/10 and they are actually really good. I heard ppl say that plantains were not good at all and I wouldn't like them. So I am glad that I at least tried them. As a chip they are great and less fat/cals then reg potatoe chips. Thanks for the listed recipe!

These are pretty good.  I have no idea if I did them correctly or not.  This is the first time I've made anything with plantains, and for some reason I was thinking they'd be just like potato chips.  Well, if they are supposed to be I cooked them wrong, because mine were still a bit soft and chewy on the inside but crispy on the outside.  I thought they were good.  I'm not a big fan of frying, though, so I wonder if they could be baked.  Perhaps I'll experiment with that next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome!! I prefer to use garlic salt though. AND, do NOT let them get brown. Golden and crunchy is perfect. Once they start changing color the flavor changes as well and they aren't as good. Sometimes I serve these with mayoketchup (1:1 mayonnaise to ketchup ratio or to taste) with garlic OR cilantro chimichurri (cilantro leaves, olive oil, garlic, onion, salt and pepper all blended in or processed until smooth)

Yummmm! After having a friend's homemade chips I HAD to make them myself. They came out just as delicious, and it was really easy! Next time I am at the market I will be buying more plantains to make this again!

Love these little guys!  We call them 'Chifles' in Ecuador.  At the store they even sell them in various flavors, but home made is always sooo much better!
