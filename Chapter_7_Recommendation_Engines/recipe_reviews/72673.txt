Love this recipe, but with the 1st batch I found it is VERY difficult to spread the peanut butter chip mixture over the marshmallow layer!  With the 2nd batch, I combined the peanuts and cereal in a bowl and spread that over the marshmallow layer then melted the peanut butter chips, butter and corn syrup, removed from heat, stirred in vanilla and carefully drizzled that over the nut/cereal layer.  MUCH easier and they still taste great!

This was very easy and very tasty.  I prepared for my family, ages 8 to 80, and they loved it.  Forget your diet with this one!!

I made this recipe for a dinner party that was going to involve small children, so I decided to use the multi-colored rice cereal and the multi-colored small marshmallows. Very tasty and colorful too!

I was looking for a bar cookie recipe that didn't have chocolate.  This certainly fit the bill.  I had trouble spreading the batter for the crust as it was very thick, but otherwise the cookie bars were very quick and easy to make.  I did use 1/3 cup of honey as I ran out of corn syrup.  Everyone loved them and I will definately be making these again.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Just made these this morning and not hard to make at all. The preperation and directions for all the ingredients worked out just fine.  My husband and son love peanut butter and chocolate so I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips by sprinkling them onto the cereal mixture after I spread it onto the marshmallows.  YUM!!!!

Love it!  I do not think it is too sweet, what so ever.   Next time I make it, I will add a graham cracker crust and chocolate.

I have been making and eating this recipe for years, a family favorite.  These are the perfect combination of gooey marshmallow with the crunchy peanut butter topping.  Love these!

Very good!  It is very easy except for the cutting into squares.  It is a little hard on old hands.  But the taste makes up for it!

Our family loves these! They are very rich, one pan full makes a ton so they are great to share! I add a cup of melted milk chocolate chips to the top, for extra chocolatey deliciousness.
