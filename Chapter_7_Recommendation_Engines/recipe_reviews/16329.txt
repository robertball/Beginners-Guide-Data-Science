Delicious and easy to prepare.  My wife and dinner guests raved about how good this dish was, and my wife made em promise to prepare it more often.  I felt the original recipe was a bit on the bland side, so I suggest using 3 tablespoons of brown sugar, 4 to 6 tablespoons of red wine vinegar (depending on taste), 2 tablepsoons of Worcesteshire, and 2 bay leaves.  The results are wonderful.  Make sure to serve the meat au jaus, as the broth is where most of the flavor resides.

I put the round steak in my crock pot, mixed all the ingredients and poured it over the meat.  It turned out very tender.

Awesome recipe! Everyone in my family loved it.  It is as close as you can get to Sauerbraten without using some kind of premade seasing package and having to soak the meat for 2-3 days.  This saves a lot of time.  One note however, I used my crockpot. The meat ended up being super tender!

Have used this recipe for years successfully.  A few hints:  use 2 T. dry minced onion instead of onion powder;  increase ginger to 1 tsp. (or use fresh grated ginger for more bite); add button mushrooms.  My family loves this served over buttered broad noodles.

This has been a family favorite for several years.  I saute fresh onions for more flavor.  I  also use balsamic or cider vinegar for extra tartness.  This recipe can be used with chicken tenders and boneless pork chops as well.  Serve this dish with scalloped potatoes and red cabbage for a fun German theme meal. Nice to see this recipe is still around!

This is cooking as I type and I snuck a taste. Braised this in 1/2 red wine 1/2 water when I put in the gravy packet. Skipped the bay leaf, eyeballed the rest of the ingredients...it was GOOD!!!! Definitely add the wine, I think that was what was lacking in some reviewers complaints, plus I really loaded up on the cracked pepper - not too much salt though. The house smells heavenly. Serving with fresh green beans and egg noodles - hope they like it!!!! EDIT...ok this is done and it is ever so tender --- remember to cut it AGAINST the grain, that is key to tender steak...and the 1/2 wine 1/2 water was spot on for taste!!!! YUMMY!!!

I followed the suggestion of a few other people & put the whole thing in the crock pot. YUM! The meat came out so tender & it had just the right amount of tang to it. I will definitely be keeping this recipe in my recipe box, thanks!

This was very good!  I did a few things differently though.  I added one medium size onion to the beef when browning it as I didn't have onion powder.   I  added a bit extra W. sauce.  I used 1/4 c. red wine and a 1 tsp. of white vinegar instead of  red wine vinegar.  The brown sugar and the red wine gave it a really nice flavor.  I also added 1 cup of mushrooms near the end of cooking.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Easy dinner and so glad to have had all the ingredients on hand!  Will add some Sherry next time for a unique flavor addition.  Used shallots, a little garlic and fresh ginger to make it "mine" and the whole fam loved!  Will definitely double it next time!

What an easy and delicious recipe.  I didn't have any red wine vinegar, so I used regular red wine and vinegar.  I doubled the amount of these. I also added a bit more sugar.  I let the mixture marinade for a couple of hours before cooking it.  I used a crockpot, and it was very convenient.  I will certainly make this again.

This meat turned out so tasty and fork tender.  I have a big family so I doubled the recipe and used the suggestion to use 3 tablespoons of brown sugar and 4 to 6 T of red wine vinegar and 2 T of Worchest.  I doubled all this and the gravy and baked it at 350 degrees for 1.5 hours.  It was excellent!

Excellent recipe!  Made this in the crock pot, set on low for 6 hours.  As others suggested, I upped the vinegar to 6 TBSPs, the brown sugar to 3 TBSPs, 2 TBSPs of Worchestershire and 2 bay leaves.  Served with Mashed potatoes and green beans...A big hit with the family.

My whole family enjoyed this meal.  The meat was very tender and the gravy was tasty.  Some reviewers comment they thought it was bland, but I didn't find it bland at all and I prefer dishes with lots of flavour.  I prepared the recipe in my electric fry pan and actually cooked it for about 2 hours.  I also had on hand a Lipton's Sidekicks package of Instant Mashed Potatoes with Beef Gravy mix, so I used the packet of gravy mix in the meat recipe and prepared the mashed potatoes as the side dish.

I did add more ginger as suggested, plus about 1/2 diced onion.  I really wish I would have taken the advice to double the sauce, because there really wasn't enough there for the noodles.  The sauce does need to be thickened at the end as well

Having never had Sauerbraten before, I really didn't know what to expect from this recipe.   I tried it simply because the recipe looked interesting.   I followed exactly as written and was happy with the taste.   If I make it again, the only change I would make would be to simmer uncovered, at least part of the time, so that the gravy would thicken up a bit more than it did covered.

Wonderful recipe!  I omitted the onion powder and ground ginger, and seasoned with onion salt.  I have two finicky toddlers (2 & 4) who loved this too!  We had a great family meal with the whole family.  My 4 year old loved this and she is still learning to eat meat.  Great recipe for family dinners!  Served with a side of peas and buttered noodles.

EXCELLENT RECIPE!! Very quick and easy to prepare. Changes made: fresh chopped onion instead of powder, and I didn't have a brown gravy mix on hand but I did have pork gravy mix and that actually might have been a bit better. Cooked covered in a sautuesse pan on the stovetop on a low simmer for about 1 1/2 hours. It fell apart. Delicious, will make again.

My husband loved it. I enjoyed it also.  I doubled the brown sugar and vinegar and used 1 TBSP of worcester since I kept reading the work "bland".  I didn't have onion powder so I used a tablespoon of onion flakes.  My husband just ate the leftovers..it's all gone.  It was a nice change of flavor.  PS.  I browned the meat and threw everything into the crock pot on low for about 8 hours and thickened the gravy, served over buttered noodles.

So good!  I doubled the sauce and instead of 4 cups water I used 3-1/2 cups and 1/2 cup red wine.  Other than that, I made exactly as is.  It cooked a little longer just because I had to wait for my mother-in-law to arrive.  Served it with Spaetzle.  Everyone was licking their plates!  Literally!

easy prep- great taste- simmered on stove top for 2 hours & meat was still tough- obviously not the recipes fault :) - would make again w/different cut or tenderize the living heck out the the meat.

this was quite good. I also threw everything into the slow cooker along with the meat and sautee`d onions. I didn`t have enough brown gravy mix or onion powder so I added some onion soup mix to compensate. I also used red wine and cider vinegar, which you could really taste. I served this with smashed potatoes, but it was best as leftovers sopped up with rye bread.

"Holy cow, that's good" - my husband.  I made it almost exactly as written, with the addition of some sliced onion while browning the meat, and sour cream at the end.  I did brown on the stovetop, and then finish it in the oven, just for convenience.  Will definitely make this again!

This is great. I browned it and then put it all in the crock pot. My goodness it was tender! One person in my family actually added cream cheese to his meat and loved it (not really sauerbraten but oh well).  Great recipe.

I too put it in a crock pot.  Cooked meat first then threw it all in the crock for four hours.  It was sooo good!  I related the taste to the taste of beef jerky.  We ate it over rice.  Very good!  Thanks!!!

My whole family loved this.  I doubled the recipe but tripled the sauce and thickened it a little bit when it was finished cooking. I don't like bay leaves so I left it out. I just browned the meat then set it aside, made the sauce then added the meat back in and stuck it in the oven for 90 minutes. I made homemade noodles to go with it. This is a definite keeper for us.

This is great, as directed! I served it with steamed carrots over rice and it was excellent. I see that others added onion and other additions, which I can see as being a great addition. I generally liked this dish and will make it again.

Fantastic!  The only changes I made were to double the gravy ingredients and use 1/2 a diced onion instead of the onion powder.  I also put all the ingredients in the crockpot on low for 5 hours instead of cooking on the stovetop or baking.  Everyone loved it and I will be making it again and again.

Perfect in the crockpot, I did add a splash of balsamic vinegar and extra worcestershire sauce, full tsp. of ginger per some of the prior reviews.  Didn't bother browning the meat before putting in crockpot and it was still wonderful.  Now on my favorite recipes list!

Originally made this because I just so happened to have all the ingredients on hand and expected this to be a one time meal. Everyone really liked it and the leftovers even were eaten today. This recipe has been added to the "do-again" recipes.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good and easy to make.  Was a big hit with my dinner party guest.  I thought it was going to be too sweet, but it turned out delicious over buttered noodles.

This was pretty easy to make and tasted wonderful.  I did use another 1/2 pack of gravy mix, teaspoon of ginger, 4 tbs red wine vinegar.

I browned the meat first and then through everything in my crock pot on low and cooked it all day.  I thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch and served it with wheat noodles and a side of corn. This was really good!

I had to double the brown sugar and vinegar and would have preferred regular white vinegar for my own taste plus next time I will use a whole diced onion not the powdered onion which almost ruined it in my opinion but the end result was very tasty.  I used a blade steak which I browned on the top of the stove and then put it with the sauce in my cast iron casserole dish on 250 for the whole afternoon, it smelled great and the steak was soo tender, served with mashed potato and veg and it hubby thought it was like Sunday dinner on a weekday with very little effort, thanks for sharing your recipe.

I made this based on the reviews. Really didnt think the kids would like it but they actually did a lot. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer of using 3 tablespoons of brown sugar, 4 to 6 tablespoons of red wine vinegar (depending on taste), 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire, and 2 bay leaves. I served it with mashed potatoes It was a little sweet for me but the husband and kids said they would love it again.

Another great alternative to making swiss steak (which is what I usually do with round steak).  Totally different flavor then the typical steak with beef flavored gravy.  Very good.

Very good. Changed it up and cooked in my slow cooker for 4 hours on low.  Used half red wine and half water instead of all water.  Aldo didn't have brown gravy mix, so made my own substitute with beef boullion, corn starch and spices.  Sauebraten without waiting days!

This is very good!  I used the cider vinegar because I prefer the taste.  I also flavored with beef base and thickened with flour before serving instead of the gravy mix. The flour or gravy mix tends to stick while cooking.  This is even better in the crock pot.

This was darn close to the real thing, my husband goes to Germany all the time and he should know. I followed the recipe to a "T", but you were right I should have made a double batch we finished it off and then we were looking for more! The kids loved it too! If I were to make it again I would probably put it in the oven to bake just to soften the meat a bit and to make the process easier. Thanks for a great addition to my recipe box!

We increased the Ginger to 1 teaspoon and increased the Black Pepper. We loved the light sweet taste. This has tenderness you can use a fork to cut it with! We will add this to our list of dinner choices!

The gravy was a bit thin. Will use less water next time. There will definitely be a next time, though. The flavor was excellent. Four diners, a double batch and no leftovers. It was a hit here.

This was a delicious, quick sauerbraten. I carmelized fresh onions before I browned the meat. I also used 2 gravy packets. Added carrots to the meat just for ease of preparation. Served over red potato mashed potatoes. Because the gravy was a little thick on the meat, I used some of the potato water to thin it down. Delish! House smelled divine!

All three of us in our family thought it was great. I would go along with Dannianne and place this in a crock pot. I have any ginger, so I used Emeril's Essence and Knorr Aromat Seasoning instead.

An easy to put together main dish. I subbed diced onion for the onion powder and made my own gravy, preferring that over a mix. Even with those changes, preparation was fast. The meat turned out fall apart tender and was delicious over buttered noodles. I also think this would make a wonderful open-faced sandwich served over toasted sourdough bread.

This dish was good and it was easy. It would never be confused with sauerbraten though. I did as some others suggested: I quickly browned the meat on the grill, then put it in the slow cooker and covered it with all of the other ingredients. I increased the brown sugar, ginger, and used dried onion and onion powder. You definitely do need to thicken the sauce at the end. Again, a nice, easy way to use up some round steak using ingredients already laying around. I will make again.

This is really good! I didn't have dry gravy mix so I did as a previous reviewer suggested and used an envelope of dry onion soup mix but everything else I added as the recipe was written. Just delicious. I didn't try to thicken up the gravy, and it was kind of runny but it was good over egg noodles. Definitely cook it for the hour that's suggested. The meat is "done" really after you brown it, but it only tenderizes after the hour that it simmers in the broth. Great recipe!

This was just going to be something I could throw together and then set the oven for a future cook time. I had no idea it was going to be sooooo yummy! I did the steak the same, but I had to do a few substitutions. I used A1 instead of worcesteshire, lemon juice instead of red wine vinegar and a packet of onion soup mix instead of the gravy packet. Husband and kids (not picky, but like basic stuff) had thirds!!!! No leftovers tonight!

I upped the brown sugar to 3 T and vinegar to 6 T. I changed the onion powder to 1 lg diced onion,  2 bay leaves, 3 pcts brown gravy, up to 1 T worchetershire. It was an ok basic recipe, just too bland for my family without the adjustments. I might change the wine vinegar to cider vinegar for more pop!

I've made this twice in 2 weeks. The family loves it.  I used a full real onion and real grated ginger.  Also didn't have gravy sauce mix so I used beef oxo and cornstarch mixed with the 2 c of water.  I also added kale and mushrooms for the last 25 mins - just to get some more nutrition.  served over rice noodles with steamed veggies.  Great combination of flavours!

Everyone liked it, husband refused the sauce at first becuase he doesn't like brown sauces and he liked  this one.   I started with a round steak that had been mechanically tenderized (like cube steak) so it wasn't quite the same but it was still good.

I followed the recipe exactly. I thought maybe 1 Tbs. of onion powder sounded like a lot but I did use that much and it was fine. For some reason the meat was a little dry but the flavor of the dish was good.

I am so sorry to vent on this recipe, but I am SICK of EVERY meat recipe being rated as 4-5 stars and "tender".  My meat came out DRY AS A BONE.  Am I just missing some elementary understanding where cooking meat is concerned?  I hope to figure the out before I am thrown out of the kitchen for good.

I loved this recipe! It was easy to whip up and to serve. My husband loved it and asked when would be the next time I would make it again! I need use fresh onion instead of onion powder since I didn't have any on hand. I think next time I'm going to add fresh mushrooms to the mix. Thanks so much for sharing!

My family LOVES this recipe! I have three picky eaters and they all ask for seconds and beg me to make this meal. I took the advice of some other reviewers and add some fresh mushrooms and sour cream to the "sauce." Delicious! I also add more vinegar than recommended, but I eyeball it so it's never the same twice. This is now added to our regular meal menu! Thank you!

Very rarely do I ad-lib to recipes the 1st time I make them, but I did this time...and I'm glad I did, because it turned out to be a keeper of a recipe.  Used 1 lb of meat, 4 T of brown sugar, heaping 1/4 t of ginger, 2 bay leaves, peppercorns instead of ground, added garlic, whole cloves, whole allspice, & raisens, even DH loved it!!

my wife gave it 3, I gave it 5 so we split the difference.  This was good as-is, and we will make it again.  I added water near the end and then ended up thickening it.  There would be plenty for a family of four.  Next time we're going to mix in some broccoli.

This is my steak recipe! My husband actually found it and made it for me and it was SO flavorful. I just love it. Its tricky though cause we tried doubling the sauce and it just came too watery. So you gotta be careful when doubling sauce. But otherwise LOVE it! :)

We enjoyed this.   I did doubled the liquids/spices and did thicken the final gravy just a little with 1T cornstarch.  I may add an add'l Tbl. of wine vinegar next time but, really quite good.

Excellent.  We let it simmer for 1.5 hours. For a side we had a sweet and sour cabbage recipe but substituted shredded kohlrabi for cabbage.  We served it with an Indiana red rasberry table wine. Great meal!

I made this for last nights supper. Followed the recipe & used a small fresh cut onion when browning the meat.  Doubled the sauce. Once gravy was made I put it a in a crock pot on low for 4 hours or so. Will make this again & again! Served it with red cabbage, Spaetzle (German egg noodles) & Brotchen. (German Bread) Will add mushrooms to left overs for tonight!

We really liked this - put ours in the crock pot and it of course came out tender.  Added a little more brown sugar and Worcestershire than it called for.

Quite good, but the meat was not as tender as it would have been had it marinated properly. I made it once and haven't made it since, so it didn't make much of in impression on me.

The meat was super tender, I used as many fresh items as I had on hand rather than dried, but did not change any ingredient.  I used Tofutti dairy free sour cream to finish it off with.  I served with rice to make it gluten free also!

Delicious and easy! My husband and teenager loved it! I used all the ingredients the recipe called for but I didn't have onion powder on hand so I used dried minced onions.  My family isn't a fan of ginger but I still kept it in the recipe and they loved it. I cooked it in my Dutch oven for just over an hour and it came out tender.  I made extra sauce as many reviewers recommended it.  I'm so glad I did.  I can't wait to make this again. Thanks Kathy!

This was really good.  I made it as stated, but would make some changes for next time.  I would consider making more sauce since I served it over noodles.  I'd leave out the salt since it was a little too salty for me.  I'd put in about a teaspoon of ginger and an additional tablespoon of brown sugar.  By doing that I think it would be just about perfect!

Absolutely a 5!  Was a little skeptical about the meat not marinating, but the flavor was wonderful.   I found Flat Iron Steak on sale at about the same price as Round Steak and prepared it in the oven as suggested along with baked potatoes.

I tried this for a change of pace with my round steak, and wow!  My husband couldn't stop raving about the sauce and what a great flavor it had.  I served it over rice with honey-butter green beans on the side which made a very pretty meal as well as a well liked meal. I will definitely make this again!

Great way to use round steak....so tender and juicy.  just made this again tonight and served it with braised broccoli to make it south beach diet worthy.  Totally awesome.  I always put everything in the crock pot and just let it go for several hours until the round steak just falls apart.

Very Tasty, without the basil (I almost forgot) it wasn't the same.  Great with rice or some mashed red potatoes.  Next time I'll get really authentic!

I tried this on a whim since I had round steak to use up. I increased sugar, vinegar and Worc-sauce per suggestions, it smelled great and looked great, but it was too sweet/tangy. I ended up adding hot pepper sauce and black pepper to tone down the sweetness, so we could eat it.

A wonderful taste that doesn't have to marinate for a long time. I used the crock pot and added 1 cup  beef broth , 30 minutes before it was done I added a little corn starch to make a thick gravey.Cooked 7 hours on low, served with baked potatos. The family loved it.

I was very disappointed and will not be making this dish again.  I read the reviews before preparing the recipe and increased the vinegar and brown sugar as many of the reviewers had suggested.  It smelled absolutely wonderful while it was cooking in the crock pot but we did not find it very flavorful at all.

I used round tip steak and took others' recommendations of using 3 TBS. brown sugar, 5 TBS. of vinegar and 2 TBS. of worcestershire sauce.  I also added mushrooms to the gravy and put everything in the crock pot to cook.

This was kind of "ho hum" for my family. We all ate it over rice and the males even went back for seconds (they are always hungry). I doubled the recipe and added a little more brown sugar, vinegar and worchestershire sauce, but I found it to be uninteresting. Thanks anyway

Great recipe for round steak!  Simmering for 1 hour was perfect..the meat was very tender. We served it over egg noodles, with a side of braised red cabbage..everyone loved it.  Great americanized version of German food.

This was awesome!  I found some $4.00 round steak and was looking for some way to cook it.  I'm not a big egg noodle fan, so I didnt want a stroganoff... I'm glad I found this recipe!  I stuck it in the crock pot (dont remember if it was supposed to be, but I did)  Browned beef slices coated in flour then in oil, then transfered to the gravy, etc. combo in the crock pot.  This was a cpl days ago, so I dont remember exactly.  It was SOOO tender.  I think I only kept it in about 3 hrs.  Served over rice (which I screwed up.. crunchy cuz I opened it too soon)  But it was still great!  Thanks for the post.  OH, I did add mushrooms too at the end.

This dish was full of flavor and fork tender! I made it in the crock pot on high for about 4-5hrs. I used 1 c water and 1 c red wine, a garlic flavored brown gravy packet, and a few slices of fresh onion. Delish!

Easy and tasty recipe for round steak!  I cooked the browned meat in my slow cooker for over 8 hours on low, increasing the seasoning amounts for more flavor.  When the meat is done and tender enough, remove, and thicken the gravy by your chosen method.  Serve with buttered pasta shapes of your choice.  Very nice!

This recipe is so good and so easy. I also added a bit more vinegar and brown sugar to the recipe, except I used brown sugar twin so the diabetics in the family could also enjoy the meal. It turned out wonderfully! I also transferred it to the crockpot, and let it cook in there all day instead of on the stove. I serve it with buttered and peppered noodles, and sweet & sour red cabbage. Es schmecht gut!!

I have had this recipe in my box for two years and can't wait for each autumn so I can make it again. It is outstanding. It even passed my German in-law test. The meat is tender and juicy and it fills my house with amazing aroma.

I followed the directions, cooking it in the oven.  My husband really liked this...the kids didn't.
I served it with salad and crusty bread. (Could have used more gravy).

This was awesome!  My husband loved it and even the finicky kids (7 & 2). The things that I did differently.  I sauteed real ginger an onions with the the steak.  And, I used the baking method.  I used sirloin.  The meat came out so tender.  Not quite sure if it was because of the baking or the quality of meat (from OMAHASTEAKS.com)  One thing i would do differently this time is add some flour to make the sauce thicker.  Oh, and I also doubled the sauce ingredients to make lots (and it did!)

This is the exact same recipe that my mother has made for years!  Fantastic taste, quick and easy, great over egg noodles.  The only difference is that my recipe calls for a tablespoon of chopped onion, otherwise, exactlyt the same.  My husband loves it...

This is a wonderful, flavorful dish for a cool winter night. I can't believe how easily it went together and the smell while it cooks is devine! I think next time I will double the recipe for more leftovers. I'm sure this is the type of dish that will taste even better the second day. Thanks Kathy!

This was very good. Now I didn't have onion powder so I used half of a medium onion, diced it up and cooked it with the meat. My Grandmother (she is German) told me this was not Sauerbraten, when I told her that I was making it for supper. I told her I know that- this is suppose to be a quick fix. And it was! It impressed her! We served with red cabbage,and potato balls. Very nice. Thank you for sharing. It even passed the 4 year old, picky eater test! So thanks!

The family really enjoyed this one, and it was a breeze.  I used white wine vinegar.  Only change I made was to add a little fresh onion while it was simmering.  I simmered for 1 1/2 hours.

My picky husband loves this one!  So easy and affordable. I slice the meat before cooking and serve over rice with a veggie and bread!

This turned out very tender and delicious. Easy to make. I doubled the recipe for 6 of us and it was just right. Did the recipe as given. Browned the meat in a Dutch oven on top of stove and completed the instructions and then put the lid on in oven at 350 for an hour and lid off at 300 for another half hour. Next time may just leave lid on entire time at lower temp. Great one for entertaining.

I set up an account on here just to give this review. I've probably used 25+ recipes from this site and just now have come across the best. It is so savory and sweet. It's the perfect balance. I didn't have ginger and it was still amazing! The steak came out perfectly, the sauce was insanely good. We served simple sides of broccoli & macaroni. I used a couple slices of buttered bread to sop up the remaining sauce. It was that good! Kids had seconds! This will become a staple in my house. It's so simple! Slice up the steak, brown it, make the sauce, and simmer for an hour while you make your sides. What an awesome recipe! THANKS!

Good flavor but needed more sauce (and I even doubled the sauce based on other comments.) The wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal; my 86 year old father hated it on principle before he even tasted it (he has developed an attitude regarding new foods.) 

I will definitely make this again, although I suppose I'll be making a separate meal for Dad at the time.

My husband really liked this.  I loved how easy it was.  I took the casserole dish and bake option...I made it in the morning, put tin foil on, refrigerated, and my husband put it in the oven later in the day so it was ready when I got home!  Love that!

I only wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars, it's that good! EXTREMELY easy to make, which is right up my alley. I know some people have said there isn't enough sauce, but I'm only cooking for 2, so it was enough for us. I didn't change a thing, and loved it as printed!  Thanks to Kathy MacDonald for taking the time to share this one with us!

This went over so well, I made it twice in the last week!  I doubled the recipe for the meat (you could even triple it).  I used about 3/4 bag of egg noodles and mixed the finished product together before serving.

I made this recipe as it is written. It was fantastic! We had a guest over for dinner and everyone enjoyed it. We paired it with whole wheat noodles and grilled asparagus. There were no left overs.  My wife told me that this will be a regular item on the dinner menu for now on.

Good but if you know this dish like I do and she the meat at a minimum of a week this won't be close. More like a better spin on stroganoff. Not the same.

Liked it a lot!  It may not be exactly like German sauerbraten, but then you don't have to marinate it for three days either, and it's very tasty and an easy, uncomplicated recipe.  Will certainly make again.

I loved it, I didn't add brown sugar, I dont like the gravy to be sweet and this way it is healthier. I guess adding a little bit of thin french fries and cream/white sauce makes it similar to beef stroganoff

Very enjoyable. I added sliced onions and garlic while cooking meat and eyeballed the rest of the ingredients. Didn't have Worcestershire sauce, so used some HP sauce instead and cut back on the sugar. I cooked it about an hour with very thinly sliced beef and it was good. I think cooking longer or using crock pot would give an even better result, as it would give the meat more time to get tender. Family loved this. We'll make it again. :)

Delicious .. I like many of the other cooks, prepared this in my crock pot. I sliced the steak and dumped everything into the pot. The only changes I made, using a packet of Au ju instead of brown gravy mix and some balsamic vinegar. Cooked on high for 4 hours . Steak was tender and gravy thick enough to serve over buttered egg noodles

Halved the recipe for my mom and stepfather to try, and they ate every bite of it, lol.  I did use some garlic & herb Mrs Dash sprinkled over the meat while it browned, since my stepfather is on a low sodium diet.  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

I made this today and it came out excellent! I was nervous at first because this cut of meat does run tough. I also used a saucer as opposed to a crockpot. How ever, I did make a few changes. I used a low sodium packet the dry beef gravy (0.87oz).... 1/2 teaspoon of fresh minced ginger and 1/4 teaspoon of ground black pepper. I also had to simmer for two hours to get the meat tender- stirring occasionally. 
I do recommend doubling up on the sauce mixture because as the meat is cooking, it does dry out. 
I paired this with multigrain egg noodles, sprinkled the top with grated Parmesan  and it came out great! Full of flavor and very tender! Highly recommended!

Huge hit!  I used beef broth instead of just water, added some cloves and garlic too.  Cooked it in the slow cooker for 8 hours on high and added noodles the last 30 minutes.  Delicious.

I will make this again. I used a dutch oven, used real onions,  real ginger, and chicken broth. Served with carrots with honey and some brown sugar and noodles. 
I really liked this recipe and it smells delish as it cooks :)

This was pretty good.  I added 3 tbsp brown sugar as other reviewers suggested.  I did not brown meat, I mixed gravy up in crockpot and added sliced top sirloin to it.  Cooked it on low 8 hours and added a little cornstarch with water to thicken gravy.

So easy to make and delicious! Thanks for all the extra suggestions that have been made. I added thinly sliced onions for more flavor and made a gravy with homemade beef bouillon.

Sauce was very runny.  Needed to remove meat and add Corn Starch to thicken sauce before serving.  But, this is a good recipe which I will make again.  Family recipe - not for company yet.

This was REALLY GOOD! I did not have Worcestershire sauce, so I substituted for A-1, It came out so yummy! I did everything else the same. I cooked it in the skillet and then put the skillet and all in the oven(my new cool pots). My husband and I agree we could just drink the juices the flavor was soooo good!

This was good.  The only thing I changed was to use fresh onion rather than the powder, which may have been a mistake, as it seemed like the flavor was lacking something.  Added some mushrooms at the end.  We liked it, but the smell was actually better than the taste in the end.  Thanks for sharing.

Added extra brown sugar and w. sauce. It was good. Let the sauce stay thin. I think it is meant to be that way.

I have been purchasing the cheaper thin sliced steaks and they were always tuff,no matter how long marinated. I tried this last night and it was awesome! Next time I add more onions and lots of mushrooms! I added some onions while it was cooking and a little bit more dry gravey mix to make it thicker. I cannot tell you enough how awesome everyone loved it!! Thank you.

This was really good, although I did make a few changes:  I used my own stock and arrowroot as a thickener for the gravy mix (who knows what chemicals are in gravy mix), chopped onion, 3 tbsp ea red wine and vinegar, 2 tsp of worcestshire and 1 tsp ginger.  I also added 3 tbsp of brown sugar, but will cut that back to 1 tbsp of xylitol/molasses as it was a bit too sweet for our liking.

Didn't really care for this at all. As my husband said "you make other dishes similar to this that are much better". Just didn't have much flavor to it IMO, and I had to thicken the gravy. Won't be making again.

No, it's not really sauerbraten, but it gets the texture right.  Not my favorite, but a quick and hearty meal on a weekday.  I served it with hash browns and brussels sprouts.  I used the dried onions rather than the onion powder.

My husband raved about this and it was so easy!  I didn't have an envelope of gravy mix, so I found an online recipe for the mix, threw all of the ingredients in the crock pot and let it go. Wonderful and comforting. Mashed potatoes were a perfect side dish.

I was thought this would be better than it was.  I think it was missing something, maybe some wine.  I made the recipe as it was written, but next time I will try adding some other things to suit our tastes.

This is really good.  I don't like onion powder, though, so I just sliced half an onion & added it to the meat.  I cooked it in the oven covered for a couple hours at 350 degrees & it was very tender.  Served over egg noodles.  Yum.  Super easy, too.

This was so tender for a tough cut of meat.  I only had Au Jus Gravy mix and it added a lot of flavor.  I also added 3 cloves of garlic and upped the red wine vinegar and brown sugar.  My husband and I are on South Beach diet so we served it over braised broccoli.  This is a keeper!

Deliciuosly tender, and the sauce was amazing on garlic mashed potatoes. We didn't have onion powder, so we substitued garlic powder and minced onions. It would probably be even better with the onion powder. I didn't use the vinegar, instead I used dry red wine. Beautiful!

cooked on the stove top, meat was not very tender.  sauce was a little bland and thin, added a little more vinegar and brown sugar.  Next time I will add some thickener.

We don't even know what sauerbraten is, but this was great. We skipped the ginger because we don't like it and we subbed crushed red pepper. Thanks Kathy!

Very quick to make and economical too. It is a standby during the week but you could probably serve it to company. The gravy is delicious. We like it with mashed potatoes or egg noodles.

Great recipe.  I didn't have a gravy mix so I made my own gravy.  I served the dish over egg noodles and the family loved it, even my 2 year old!

I made this last night for my BF. His response was "that was one of the best meals I have ever eaten." I served it over noodles with green beans and fresh rolls. I did adjust to 6 TBS Red Wine Vinegar, 3 TBS of Worces. 3 TBS Brown Sugar and 2 bay leaves. I cooked it in a slow cooker with two small onions and some mushrooms for 2 hours. It was FABULOUS!!!!

This recipe is fabulous!  I sauted an onion and added that, only added extra vinegar and sugar, and worchestershire like others suggested, then thickened later with flour.  Mmmmmmmmmm, will definately make again!

Great recipe.  Double the recipe even if you don't think you will need that much meat. It was gone in a flash with my family. I increased the vinegar, brown sugar and ginger like many other reviewers, and baked it about 2 hours in the oven. We aren't big fans of brown gravy mix, but this doesn't taste at all like the powdered stuff.

This was okay. I don't necessarily want to say that this wasn't flavorful, because it did have flavor, but it seemed to be missing something. Also, the meat wasn't very tender, but that probably had more to do the the cook(me) than the recipe. Will probably use this as a base recipe to play around with in the future.

WOW! My family raved about this! My husband actually called his parents and told them I had cooked sauerbraten and it tasted just like we get at our favorite German restuarant! I left out the ginger since I didn't have any and served with roast potatoes, corn on the cobb and  Dilly rolls (recipe on here). Super recipe. It takes time but is not hard!

I went against my better judgement and made this in spite of the bad reviews and I have to agree with everyone else.  I gave it one star instead of zero because it was edible.  I got it down, I just didn't enjoy it.

This recipe sounded really good.  I really wanted to like it b/c of the recipe & the ease of making it.  And we did like it.  But just okay.  DH said he wouldn't miss it if I never made it again but would eat it if I did.

Disappointing.  I am not sure if my vinegar was too strong or my tastes just off but it was way to tangy for us.  Tasted more like vingegar then anything.  Also the recipe made a vary small amount.

I followed some other reviewers & cooked meat with fresh onion first. Also tossed meat in flour so that the sauce would thicken up. We all loved it, even the 3 & 5 year olds.

This is very good.  I had to use sirloin tip steak, added a small thinly sliced onion during the last part of meat browning.  Covered & baked at 350 and later turned it down to 300 and it was still simmering plenty.  Took less than 1.5 hours and  meat was very tender.   Served over noodles, but rice or potatoes would also be good. Thank you, Kathy from Susie

Place all of the ingredients for the gravy in a blender or food processor.  Blend well then add 20-25 gingersnaps to the blender and blend well.  Add to the neat along with a handful of golden raisins.

I had no idea what to expect, and when I tasted the sauce before adding the meat I got a little scared.  But an hour on the stovetop turned this into a pretty tasty dinner!  Served with boiled red potatoes and corn (I didn't think my husband would like the gravy on rice, noodles or mashed potatoes).

This recipe is excellent.  I baked the meat instead after browing it and the meat was so tender and juicy.  I could not stop eating it!!

Well, if I measure my daughters reaction, I'd have to say this is a big winner.  At 10, she's my worst food critic.  In this case, she said "Dad, I hate to tell you this . . . but this is actually good."  :-)

I had to make a few substitutions based on what I had on hand: added 1 tbsp of beef bouillion and 1 tbsp cornstarch to the water as I had no gravy mix, used onion flakes instead of onion powder.  Also marinated round steak strips in olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt, pepper and garlic powder for 3 hours before browning.  Then placed in crockpot with remaining ingredients (including more vinegar).  This was a great way to make an inexpensive steak very tender.  The sauce was not thick (as I didn't have the gravy mix), but still tasted good over brown rice.  Next time I would try more vinegar for a more tangy flavor and also use the brown gravy mix to see if it adds more flavor.  Overall, an easy different way to cook steak.

This was a very good recipe!  I doubled the recipe for our family of 4 to make sure I had leftovers.  The only thing I did different was to cook in my stovetop pressure cooker with regulator rocking slowly for 20 minutes....instead of simmer in a pan for 2 hours.  My whole family thought this was an excellent meal.  I baked fresh biscuits and served it over them with green beans on the side.  The sauce had an excellent flavor and the meat was very tender.  I will definitely be making this recipe again in the very near future!

This was delicious and so easy. My family loved it. I doubled the recipe for my family of 5 and there was almost none left over. I will definitely make this again.

My very picky DH dislikes any kind of seasoning on anything, but he really enjoyed this. So did my 3 year old, meat-eater daughter! I will try this again.

I thought the flavor was delicious.  I did add a little extra brown sugar.  I will make this again.

Easy to make..but the family commented that it didn't have much flavor.  I doubt we will try it again.
