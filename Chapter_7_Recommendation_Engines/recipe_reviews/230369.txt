Very good, although I used 2 cans of chipotle peppers and it was almost too spicy (and I love spicy).

Who knew one tiny can could pack so much punch!! This is spicy!! And I only did one can of chipotle peppers but it is good! Clearing up my sinuses also I added about a tablespoon of garlic to the onion! And my sweet potatoes were white on the inside!

Even my foodie friends agree this is great soup with just the right amount of heat.

3 3 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/230369/spicy-chipotle-sweet-potato-soup/ ... I'm a nice person.  I just don't do nice things.  Kidding, kinda.  Changes!  ... I'm good with some sweet & spicy combinations, but sweet potatoes & spicy don't grab me.  That's change number one:  subbed with corn.  (Yeah, I did change it majorly with that; but I'm pleased with the results sooooo ... forgiven?!?) Okay, okayyyy, I'll stop yakkin' & start my review!  Again, I halved ... Sauteed 3/4c onion then added 1T dried cilantro & 2T chipotle puree (one more would've been fine, I think).  I stirred that around to bring out the flavors by heating.  Added 3c homemade chicken broth.  Brought to a boil then added 1/2# frozen corn.  Brought to a boil again & simmered 15; added 1/4c heavy cream & 1t lime juice.  I had a cup of (canned) diced tomatoes hanging around so added them then;  good addition.  A li'l 411, homemade chicken stock will separate when it's cold so don't whack when it layers into corn, stock & the dreamy-ish top layers.  It reheats fine.  This is a nice warm-up soup - not snowing type, but cold & breezy.  :)  A red or pinto, maybe black, bean wouldn't hurt things.  :D  ... Note4Me: Spicy Chipotle Corn Chowder.
