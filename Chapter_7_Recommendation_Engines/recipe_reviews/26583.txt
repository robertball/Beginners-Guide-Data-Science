I've used this recipe for more than a year now, and my husband suggested that I write this review.  I read many of the previous reviews and came up with additional suggestions.  I add potatoes, carrots and onions.  To give this recipe more spice, I rinse off the roast and sprinkle McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning on all sides of the roast before putting it into the slow cooker.  I mix together 1/2 of the can of mushroom soup, 1/2 of the dry onion soup mix and 1 cup water.  I pour this mixture over everything and sprinkle the rest of the onion soup mix on top of the roast.  I put several slices of the onion on top of the roast also.  I have used this recipe many, many times and it comes out perfect every time!  My husband loves it!!!

THIS WAS AWSOME!!! I took a reviewers advice and doubled the receipe and added 2 packages of onion soup mix and I didn't have beef broth so I used 3 bullion cubes in 2 cups of hot water I couldn't believe how incredible this tasted. I don't even like cream of mushroom soup so I was scared at first but this was awsome and it made PLENTY of gravy to pour over our mashed potatoes and the roast. We all loved it and it is now going to be a regular meal at our house! I've been looking for over 5 yrs now for a great crock pot receipe for roasts and now I found it! ***UPDATE... I now make this all the time and I don't even use the mushroom soup anymore... One bag of onion soup, 2 bullion cubes and 1 cup of water w/ any roast you buy in the crock pot for 6 hr on high. I even strain the broth for the onions and make a gravy out of it to go over the roast and mashed potatoes. It's WONDERFUL both ways!

I will preface this by saying I couldn't cook a roast in the oven if my life depended on it :) BUT, my husband loves roast, so I got a crock pot for Christmas!  I used two cans of mushroom soup, and one can of beef broth.  I rubbed the roast with onion salt (he HATES onions, otherwise, he's perfect), then poked holes in it and inserted whole cloves of garlic.  I added carrots and cabbage (I usually do the potatoes separately). I used about a 5 # roast, so it took 10 hours on low...and....well...it was AWESOME...fell APART in the pan...it was the most delicious thing I've ever tasted! Thanks for all the helpful hints..I'm off to slaughter a cow!

Just okay.  What the recipes doesn't say is you should mix the broth and soup in a separate bowl and then pour over the beef.

My husband and I loved this!  My actual cook time was about 11 hours because I got home late-this roast was so tender, it was falling off the fork as I tried to take it out of the crockpot!  This recipe is a definite keeper and great for the working woman.

I have never been able to cook a roast that my family has called "excellent", but this recipe was a huge success!  I sprinkled an envelope of onion soup mix on top of the roast, but followed the rest of the recipe, adding potatoes and carrots at the bottom of the crock pot.  I cooked for 4 hours on high and everything was great.  Will definitely make again.

This is definitely an easy option for those busy days! Per other reviews, I added a pkg of onion soup mix, canned mushrooms, carrots & celery. I seasoned the roast & browned it quickly in a skillet before putting it in the crock pot. I also added a chopped clove of garlic, 1 bay leaf, 1/2 tsp each of thyme, parsley, & peppercorns. So delicious & easy!

First time I made it, I deviated more from the original recipe.  I did the onion soup packet thing.  I did the can of mushrooms thing.  I used golden mushroom soup instead of the cream of mushroom (that's what I had on hand).  Then added the veggies. People really liked it, but didn't go crazy over it.  

Second time around, I seemed to stick more to the recipe.  Seasoned with Montreal Steak Seasoning, garlic salt, and pepper.  Threw in two cans of cream of mushroom soup and half a box of beef broth.  Added carrots and onions.  A couple hours later added potatoes.  A half hour before serving, I measured out a 1/2 cup of the gravy broth and whisked in a couple tbsp. of flour, then stirred that back into the crock pot.  THIS TIME, my husband went nuts.  He had three servings.   He looked at me with sheer joy and worship in his eyes.  Isn't that what every spouse wants?   And it wasn't even hard to make!!!!

This is so easy and delicious!  It's so nice to come home from work and smell dinner cooking!  I added a Lipton Onion Soup Mix, as well as red potatoes, onion, carrots and mushrooms. Made an excellent gravy.  Great comfort food!

The usual taste of crock pot roast beef. I added an envelope of onion soup mix, some vegetables and some barley to perk it up.

I also doubled the mushroom soup (I used the 99% fat free) and used vegetable broth and onion soup mix.  There were no leftovers!

This really was a tasty and quick recipe. While I use my crockpot, I have become a pressure cooker afficionado. I was able to make this recipe in thirty minutes, using my Cook's Essentials Programmable Pressure Cooker. I used a 3 lb. cross rib roast. I did use low-sodium beef broth and 2 cans cream of mushroom soup. After browning the meat quickly, I used unpeeled red potatoes (more nutritious) and I used a garlic clove as well. I poured the combine soups plus 1/2 pack of onion soup mix and cooked the meat on HIGH pressure for 30 minutes. The gravy was more than plentiful and very tasty. An easy meal to enjoy. If you have never tried a pressure cooker, they are easy to use and aren't the kind that "explodes" like in the old I Love Lucy episodes... frankly, it's easier than a crockpot and much faster. Definitely a "keeper" recipe.

I loved this recipe and so did my kids!  I made it exactly as written except I seasoned my meat with onion powder, garlic powder and pepper and I mixed the cream of mushroom soup and beef broth up in a bowl before pouring it over the roast.  This was the best roast I have ever made!  It was very moist, tender and flavorful!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is very similar to a recipe of mine that uses  beef stew meat,2 cans of mushroom soup, 1 pkg. onion soup mix, 1 cup of wine and some water. I actually like that better -- I serve over noodles. This wasn't bad at all, I just think I like the convenience of the cut meat.

Use Campbell's BEEFY MUSHROOM soup instead of creamy mushroom and beef broth.  It is incredibly good!  For some reason, it is hard to find in the stores, so when you find it, buy a good supply of Beefy Mushroom soup.

Super easy. I seasoned the meat with Grill mates montreal steak seasoning. If gravy too thin remove meat and stir in a mixture of 1/4 cup cold water and 1/4 cup cornstarch into slow cooker cook on high for 15 minutes.

I liked how this came out! I seasoned the meat with a little garlic powder (poked the meat and moistened it a bit). I halved some red potatoes and placed them in the pot with some baby carrots and added a little onion soup mix to the sauce to pour over the roast, as others suggested. I had some sliced baby bellas that I wanted to use up so I added them in about halfway through before flipping the roast at that time, and for those of you who are mushroom lovers, I definitely suggest adding more mushrooms! I shredded the leftover meat for sandwiches for the week, as well as the vegetables for snacking, and took another reviewer's advice and boiled the remaining liquid with flour to produce an awesome gravy. What a great and easy meal that lasts for days! This was my first crock pot beef roast and my boyfriend and I were both thrilled with it, thank you!

Made this for dinner last night and it was great!  Made the hubby's tummy happy after a long day working in the cold.  I didn't add the onion soup mix, but seasoned the roast with onion powder and garlic & pepper.  Mixed the soup with 3 beef bullion cubes and 2 cups water.  30 to 45 minutes before serving I added celery, carrots and an onion (quartered) to the pot.  After taking out the roast I thickened up the gravy with some of the broth mixed with some cornstarch.  Served with mashed potatoes and a broccoli, corn and red pepper blend.  Yummy and very appealing to the eye.

This was unbelievable tasting and easy.  I used other people's suggestions by using a can of golden mushroom soup, cream of mushroom soup, can of beef broth and an onion soup packet.  I also lined the bottom with carrots, onions and mushrooms.  Mixed all the liquids first then topped over the beef.  At the end, I strained the veggies and served them as a side dish along with mashed potatoes and made a gravy out of the what was left in the pot.  Total time in the crock pot was 9 hours for 3.5 pounds.  Leftovers were eaten up in a flash the next day too!  Delicious and easy!

Good recipe, but needs a little more flavor. I brown the roast on the stove to sear in the juices prior to putting in crock pot. Instead of the beef stock, I add 1/2-1 package of dried onion soup mix (depending on size of roast) with one cup water to the cream of musroom soup, whisk all together, then pour over roast. You can also use golden mushroom soup instead of the cream soup and add sliced fresh onions and mushrooms.

This recipe even works great in the oven.   I roasted it at 275 degrees for 5 hours and the meat was tender and tasted wonderful!  I used an arm beef roast that weighted 3.96 pounds.

I liked this though I did take some reviewers suggestions which may have altered it a smidgen.  I did the two cans of cream of mushroom soup and sauteed onions and mushrooms before cooking.  We loved the gravy, thickened with cornstarch.  This is a keeper!

I could settle w/ just a one word review, and without a doubt that review would be: AMAZING! Like some that reviewed this before me, I too used 1 can of golden mushroom soup, 1 can of regular soup, and the powdered onion soup mix. I did however stray slightly and used a can of beef broth as well, so that I could have a good gravy. I added in potatoes, carrots, crushed garlic, and sliced onions when I put the roast on to slow cook. I put it in the crockpot, on low for 10 hours, and about 8 hours into the cooking I added two capfuls of "Gravy Master" to darken the gravy and flavor it up slightly. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and sourdough bread and it was WONDERFUL. I made it on a Sunday, and my Wednesday they were asking me to make it again. Definitely FIVE STARS!

This turned out perfectly for us, highly recommended for busy people!  Per other reviews, we added a 16 oz canned of drained mushrooms, and a 1 oz packet of dry onion soup mix.  I mixed the soups, broth and mushrooms the night before, which made for a 2-minute setup the next morning;  cooked on low for almost 11 hours, and it was incredibly tender.  We carefully trimmed the meat, so the "gravy" wasn't as greasy as I'd thought it might be.  I tried to thicken it -- it's still a little to thin to use over potatoes, but tasted great over the meat.

I inserted several cloves of garlic (slivered) into the meat prior to cooking.  The gravy was somewhat thin and required thickening.  The gravy was a bit saltly, therefore, low sodium beef broth might be considered.  Also, the cooking time was more than indicated.  I'll be making it again with the above changes.  It was very good.

I've made this roast several times but add only the cream of mushroom soup, a sliced medium size onion, baby carrots and a sliced potato for each person.  The flavor of the broth is delicious in the vegetables and served over the meat.   Your whole meal is in one pot. After it has cooked on low for about 8 hours while I was at work I would turn the roast over to be sure the top part is as moist as the bottom and cook it for about another hour.  Delish!   It is one of our favorite meals any time of the year.

Love this and will make it again.  As per other review is rubbed the roast in McCormicks Montreal Steak seasoning and added two cans of cream of mushroom soup.  Very easy and equally tasty.

For some reason I had to cook this about 11 hrs for it to get really tender but it was worth the wait.

Quite a good base recipe, the flavours can be a bit flat so I made some additions. First added salt, pepper, garlic powder and a splash of red wine to my roast and left it in the fridge overnight/ I used one cup of home made cream of onion soup and 2 cans of mushroom soup. I cut some onions and potatoes and arranged them at the bottom of the pot (the potatoes helped to suck up some of the fat from the meat). The roast was about 3.5lbs and it cooked on low for 8 1/2 hrs, I added a bay leaf during the last hour of cooking, to make it a bit more savory since I found the creaminess of the soups a bit odd for my taste when paired with red meat Everybody loved it, no complains and no leftovers. worth the long wait.

I used this recipie a little over a year ago and since then it has been a favorite in my family since. We like to have extra gravy so I usually double the cream of mushroom and the beef broth and pour in an envelope of onion soup mix.  It seems to add a little more taste.

I used this recipe as a base to make my first pot roast while using the slow cooker for the first time. It was great! Very simple. Because of other suggestions, I used regular liquid beef broth and roasted garlic cream of mushroom. I added a few seasonings and some splashes of worcestire sauce and brandy. I also cut up a whole onion and threw it in at the beginning, then added potatoes and carrots about 2 hours in. Next time I will probably add celery and mushrooms. I poked the roast with a cooking fork to absorb the flavor and served with crusty bread. Quick and easy, just the way I like!

Judging by some of the comments I think cooking time depends on type of slowcooker. I added 1 tablespoon garlic, half pkg of dry onion soup mix, and tossed in the potatoes, carrots and rutabagas at start time. My cooker took 10 hours and I had a very wonderful bottom round roast beef dinner! Thanks for sharing, Dawn.

I've made this recipe twice now.  The first time used a rump roast, which turned out a little dry, and added veggies and 1/2 cup red wine.  Good flavour but too much like my "usual" pot roast recipe.  

Second attempt gave such a great roast hubby and I both loved it, and can't wait to make again!  This was so tender and delicious that we both wished I had used a larger roast.

Here is what I did:

Used 2-1/2 lb boneless inside blade roast, 1 can low-sodium Cream of Mushroom Soup, 1 can Golden Mushroom Soup, 1 cup low-sodium Beef Broth, 2 tsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp onion soup mix, 1/2 Lb sliced mushrooms.  Mixed soups, broth, garlic powder and onion soup mix in crockpot, whisking until smooth.  Added roast, spooning some of liquid over roast.  Cooked on low for 9 1/2 hours, turning roast and adding mushrooms halfway through cooking time.

Based on my 2nd attempt, I would give this 5 stars, and will definitely make again and again, using a 3-4 lb boneless blade roast.  Wonderful!

Great base recipe. Thanks so much.

This recipe is as good as it gets!  Plus it's so simple.  I added a couple of cut onions, a few slices of green pepper and one spear of cut celery for more flavor. Also added five whole carrots and five cut red potatoes.  The mushroom broth made a great gravy substitute. An awesome meal!  Five stars all the way.

LOVE IT! I always follow the recipe exact the first time and if I need to change it, I will. I made this once with potatoes, carrots etc and the veggies took away the flavor from the meat. I use the broth for gravy on my mashed potatoes and it is awesome.

Excellent!  I followed the recipe as written, with one modification: I rubbed the roast (upper round) with Montreal steak seasoning before searing it and putting it into the slow cooker.  I did not add any veggies - just the soup and broth.  I expected it to taste like pot roast, but it ended up a bit closer to roast beef than I had anticipated, but I think this depends entirely on the cut of meat used.  The gravy, by the way, is super - just put it on the stovetop and add some corn starch mixed with cold water, and bring it to a boil.  Perfect for mashed potatoes, and for hot roast beef sandwiches the next day.

Awesome!!!I made a few changes as well.  I always put the veggies at he bottom, otherwise  the beef cooks faster than he veggies. I only sliced two onions and three stalks of celery. I used cream of celery instead, and chopped 6oz. of fresh mushrooms added 1 pkg.of beefy onion mix, 3/4 c. red wine. I seasoned the beef with garlic pepper and pierced the beef(salt tends to dry it out).  Placed the beef on top of onions and celery, poured mixture on top of beef.  Made mashed potatoes and steamed carrots as side.  Wonderful meal!!

I thought I would give it a try with all the great reviews. And it turned out great.I added minced garlic and other seasonings to the roast, seared on both sides before putting it in the slow cooker. I also added 1/2 cup of water to the beef broth so it wouldnt be to salty, and added 1/2 cup of cooking wine. I added red potatoes, carrots,celery, and onions mid way thru cooking and mushrooms about 2 hours before it was done.With every recipe seasoning is everything. I would never make a recipe with out adding my own touch of seasoning. This is definitley a keeper.

Good simple and easy pot roast recipe.  I seasoned the meat with salt, pepper and garlic powder before browning and putting in the crock pot.  Then added sliced onions and the can of soup.  I used 1 cup water and 1 bulion cube to deglaze the pan before adding to the pot.  The meat turned out tender and flavorful.  The gravy was perfect, not too runny or thick.  I added carrots and celery about 4 hours prior to serving.

I added 2 Tbsp of Minced Onion and a Tbsp of chopped garlic and fresh ground pepper to balance the spices (broth and soup add lots of sodium - and although I like salt it needs to be in conjunction with other flavorings). If you are not a fan of salt just make sure you add a few potatoes - absorbs the salt taste *and* you get a side dish. This was terribly easy and the meat falls apart with a fork! Great for a cold work day!

I'll never make a roast in the crock pot ANY other way.  When dinner is ready, instead of a crock of greasy water you have a savory "au jus" to serve with the pot roast.  Like others, I'll add seasonings t taste and also onion at the start of cooking...and then 2 hours before the beef is done, potatoes and carrots.  It truly is awesome.

I liked this recipe because it did not include onion soup mix.  My hubby can't tolerate it.  Very easy and if you want added flavor season the roast with a rub before placing it in the crock.

For the time and effort that goes into this recipe, which is pretty minimal, the results are great.  I dredge the roast in flour liberally seasoned with black pepper, garlic powder and paprika.  Then I brown the roast on all sides.  I mix the mushroom soup with the beef broth to remove the lumps, pour over the roast, then top the roast with 1/2 pkg of onion soup mix.  I cook mine on low for 8-9 hours and we always enjoy it.

Every one loved this!  I used a bottom round rump roast.  I used Beef Consume instead of broth and Cream of Onion soup.  Used one whole sliced onion on the bottom of the crockpot.  I added Kitchen Boquet to darken the gravy. Thickened the gravy with 3T cornstarch and 1/3 C cold water.   Served with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Mouthwatering!

Wonderful and full of flavor.  I marinated the roast in McCormick's Meat Marinate overnite.  The next morning I put carrots, potatoes, mushrooms and the roast in my crock pot.  I added one can each of Cream of Mushroom soup, Garlic Cream of Mushroom soup, Beef Broth and an envelope of Liptons Onion Soup and 1/4 to 1/2 a cup of Merlot wine.  Then I sprinkled with garlic powder.  Cooked for 8 hours.  Everyone loved it.  The only thing I would do different next time is to prick the meat with a cooking fork so more juices/flavor would penetrate the meat.  Great reviews by my guests.

This was pretty awesome.  Now I did read comments as I always do. I did coat my hunk of beef with Montreal seasoning and pan seared it.  put baby carrots and onions on bottom and threw beef in  crock pot. Used 2 cans soup 15 oz beef broth 1 pkg onion soup mixed together 1st and it  took 11 hrs but it was super yummy this was a super tough piece of meat and it just melted and tastes good over time threw in some frozen peas and served over egg noodles. . Yum!
I know people get upset when we rate a recipe but alter it also. If I do change things I will take a point off. I personally search for recipes by rating and quantity of rates.i do search through comments cause hey trial and error is always good. That being said I'm rating this a 5 anyway alterations were not grand and it's good it should show up with high ratings and good comments.

Made today for dinner. Super easy. I did make some small changes. I spiced the meat w/ montreal steak seasoning (per other suggestions) poked the meat and rubbed in garlic. Mixed the can of cream of mushroom and beef broth. Put red potatos, celery, and carrots under and around the meat. Came out AMAZING! Everyone loved it and went back for seconds. No leftovers!! This is so easy. A keeper for sure.

This roast is so easy and flavorful.  I use one can of cream of shroom soup, one can of golden mushroom and 1 packet of onion soup mix. My family loves it.  I make mashed potatoes or noodles and there is barely any leftovers.  Very easy and very good!

Very delicious! I added an extra can of mushroom soup, onion soup mix, and sprinkled the meat with Montreal Steak Seasoning as well. Adding the extra can of mushroom soup makes enough juices so you have enough to use as gravy. Very tasty! Smelled wonderful cooking! I cooked it on high for 4 hours, but I recommend cooking it on low for 8, the meat was a little tough.

I've made this roast beef many times. My husband and I love it! I also add carrots, potatoes, and onions that way I don't have to make anything when I get home from work. I don't even brown the meat b4 putting it in the crock pot and it still comes out great! It is easy and tasty!

This is a great recipe for roast.  I have also added 1 small bottle of A-1 steak sauce.  It gives it a whole other flavor and the gravy is very yummy.

This was VERY good. I took the advice of previous reviewers where I could. I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of beef broth and 1 can of cream of mushroom with garlic soup since my store didn't carry the golden mushroom some suggested. I also added a packet of onion soup mix and a capful of Gravy Master. I would omit the Gravy Master next time as it made it a little saltier than I like. I mixed everything together in the crockpot, put the roast on and basted it with sauce. Then I left it on low for about 7 hours. When I came home from work, I didn't even have to thicken the sauce, it was perfect. I sliced the meat and served it with the gravy and some mashed potatoes. A big hit with the whole family. Thanks for submitting.

OH MY GOSH...this was unbelievable..everyone couldn't say enough good things about this Roast Beef..and I had company over when I made it.  Risky...yes.  But I'm glad to say this recipe is a keeper!!!  Though I did first brown the beef in a skillet.  Then I put it in the slow cooker, I added garlic, carrots, celery, onions, peppers and mushrooms.  I also used the Roasted Garlic Mushroom soup. I set it on the low temperature.    Then mid-way, I cut up the roast beef and switched to the high temperature.. it took six hours to cook. Then for the gravy, I took out some of it, put it in a saucepan and added cornstarch and water and added some of my special seasoning and it was   scrumptious :>)  This is a great recipe and thanks sooo much for sharing :>)

The name says it all!!!  Used 1 can of regular beef broth instead of condensed and also added the pack of onion soup mix.  Used a cross rib roast and took it out a couple of hours before it was to be done and sliced it up then put it back in.  After I took the roast out I added some flour/water into the crockpot and made a delicious gravy.  Definately a keeper.

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner, and it was wonderful! The roast beef was so tender that I didn't have to slice it up for the guests. They were coming out of the slow cooker in serving sizes already.  I poured the gravy into a gravy boat and served it all with mashed potatoes. Our small dinner party loved it! This is most definitely a keeper.

My parents came to visit my husband and I this weekend, and saw our new house for the first time.  I wanted to do something really easy and delicious, so I picked this recipe.  IT WAS A HIT!  It came out perfect and my picky father went for seconds!  I do think that next time I will use 2 cans of mushroom soup, just to make the gravy thicker, but it really was Awesome.  Thanks for sharing it.

I'm not that fond of dry Lipton Onion Soup flavor, but I added some sherry and mushrooms, served it over egg noodles and my husband was thrilled.  I'll make it again for him...and it was easy.

Love this recipe.  I think one of the best parts was the gravy that it left over, we made mashed potatoes with it, and there really wasn't that much fat in it

I love this recipe just as written.  We've used it for almost a year now.  I have added vegetables.  It's good.  We've cut it up and put it on top of baked potatoes.  It's good.  We've cut it up and put it in noodles (with the gravy, of course).  It's a delicious, simple recipe, perfect for hectic schedules.  It's one of the recipes that made me an Allrecipes addict.

I made this for my family, and my kids were sad that it was all gone. My kids are very picky eaters. I did make a few changes to the recipie. I used a large can of mushroom soup and beef broth. I also cut and diced an onion and mushrooms and sauted them and put them in the crockpot. (I have to make them small so my kids dint know they are in there) I also browned the roast on all sides before i put it in the crockpot. When it was all done i put the sauce in a sauce pan and boiled it and added a rue to make a thick gravy. It was awsome. I served this dish with mashed potatoes and veggies.  My hubby said this recipe was a keeper. I have made this dish twice now. We love it.  A couple nights later i took the left over gravy and add a couple packages of gravy mix and poured it over hamburger pattys and made hamburger steak. It was wonderful.

I made a couple of changes. I added 1 Tablespoon of Worstishire sauce, and coated all sides of the beef with grill mates Montreal Steak seasoning. This was so good! I served it with a side of Lemon Basil carrots and mashed potatoes. MMMMM so good.

I made this exactly as the original poster suggested ... it was awesome!  My Hubby is really picky about his roast beef and he generally doesn't like mashed potatoes ... but for him, the combination of mashed potatoes, roast beef, and gravy made it perfect for him.    It is so nice to have a SIMPLE recipe with ingredients easily kept on hand ... THANK YOU!

I made this recipe today.  To be honest, I was a little unsure at first, but it turned out awesome.  I altered the recipe a little by cutting up some new potatoes and added them in.  I also took the advice of others and washed the roast and covered it with Montreal Steak Spice.  I used the whole tin of mushroom soup, as well as the beef broth.  I also included about half of a package of Lipton onion soup mix.  After cooking for 9 hours on low heat, I took the drippings and put some in a frying pan.  In a seperate dish I mixed two tablespoons of cornstarch with 1/4 cup of water.  I added a little bit of this mixture to the drippings in the pan.  With the element on medium high heat, I wisked the drippings, adding just enough of the cornstarch mixture to make gravy.  It was awesome!

I thought my mom made an awesome roast beef... but this one is even better than hers (shhh, don't tell her I said that!) I made this for the kids, hubbie and in-laws and everyone loved it, even the picky two-year-old. After reading reviews I added a pkg of dry onion soup mix and 1/2 cup of water, and also onions, potatoes and carrots to the crock pot and left it on low for about seven hours. The sauce turned into a nice gravy. I used an eye of round roast, and the meat came out so tender and moist, I will DEFINITELY be making this one again.

I had a two pound tip sirloin roast. I added 1 pkg dry onion soup mix, a cup of fresh sliced mushrooms, 2 mushroom soup cans, 1 can of beef broth, fresh sliced onions.. It turned out just perfect. The roast does not slice like a traditional roast by any means as it came out so tender. Total cook time for my 2 lb = 7.5 hours on low. The gravy is EXCELLENT & goes great with mashed potatoes & yorkies! I will definitely keep this recipe, thank you for sharing =)

So so so so good.  I took some guidance from the previous reviews and used 1 can of cream of mushroom, 1 can of golden mushroom, about 1 c. of beef stock and an envelope of dried onion soup mix.  After the roast was done (about 9 hours or so) I skimmed the fat from the drippings, added a couple of TB of cornstarch and let that simmer on high for about 15 minutes.  Delicious!  My husband was practically incoherent with joy.  A keeper for sure!

Easy and delicious. I made it twice this week and both times it got gobbled up. I added potatoes and carrots about 4 hours into the cooking time.

Very good!!! I used eye of the round roast, mixed regular beef broth with 1 can of garlic cream of mushroom soup, and added a splash of Lee and Perrins. Over carrots and potatoes, it turned out great.

This made wonderful gravy!  I have always used dry onion soup mix in my gravy but figured that would be too much sodium so I took a large whole onion, pureed it in the food processor and added it to the soup mixture.  The onion pretty much disolves over the 8 hours of cooking and gives the gravy nice flavour.  I also thickened the gravy by mixing in 3 tbsp. of cornstarch the last 2 hours of cooking and added a few drops of Gravy Browner to darken it up.

This was REALLY good.  This was our first time using our crock pot.  The meat was just perfect!  

I did as many other suggested a can of beef broth. Added carrots and potatoes. Also did 6 hours on high.

To those who think it lacks flavor, try adding your favorite spices.  I added basil, garlic, and cracked black pepper as well as red potatoes and carrots (my fiancee won't eat roast without them) and it was incredible tasting.  The meat was so tender and we used the leftovers for au jus for homestyle biscuits.  Definitely got an A+ at my house!

The beef was a little bit dry for me, but I'm adding an extra star because of how easy it was to make! I love garlic and onion so I sprinkled this with garlic and onion salt before cooking. I added some baby carrots, onion, and potatoes at the bottom. It was really good, and I'll make it again. Maybe next time, I'll try searing the roast before putting it into the pot.

Surprisingly good for how simple it is. I browned the beef in the pan after a rubbing just a bit of spices on it. And I dubbled the soup and broth in the crockpot. When I pulled it out I mixed some flour and milk together then added it to the gravy which thickened immediately and tasted fantastic. Thank you!

Great recipe and easy to prepare in the morning prior to leaving for work.  I add baby red potatoes (peeling the middle section of each potato) and baby carrots along with a vidalia onion that I slice and put on the bottom of the cooker with the roast on top.  I used the cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic and we all liked the more intense flavor it gave.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was very good, even though I used a frozen roast beef. I forgot to thaw the roast but after reading the reviews, I wanted to try it. I only had about 2.5 pounds of meat and so I added only one can of mushroom soup. I used a whole packet of onion soup mix and also added some garlic powder and about a tablespoon of beef bouillon granules. Instead of using just a bit of water, I covered the whole roast with very hot water. (because it was frozen) The cooking time was about 6.5 hrs on the low setting. I will definitely make this again and I won't need to worry if my beef is frozen or not. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for Christmas dinner. It was delicious. I cooked a 3 1/2 lb. roast in a large crockpot. I used soup and beef broth and added a couple cloves of fresh garlic and an onion. The roast was done in 6 hours and was delicious, but made way too much gravy. I will cook this again.

This roast is so simple to make and the flavor is great.  I cooked it for about ten hours.  The sauce makes a great gravy for mashed potatoes.  My husband is not too fond of cream of mushroom soup but he loved this recipe.

Absolutely wonderful! I added an extra can of mushroom soup along with some garlic salt, thyme, basil, oregano and italian seasonings for extra seasonings and served the meat with baked potatoes smothered in the gravy.  Definitely recommend this recipe!

Great taste and couldn't be easier.  I used Campbell's Beefy Mushroom soup.  Made a lot of au jus-type gravy.  We had roast beef entree twice, beef and gravy sandwiches once, and I used the rest of the liquid as a base for soup (adding wild rice, diced carrots and mushrooms.)

The roast absolutely fell apart and was SO tender!  I did add a little bit of garlic, a bay leaf, a can of mushrooms and mixed a package of Lipton onion soup with a cup of cooking wine.  I also transferred the "gravy" to a skillet, adding some flour and beef bouillon.  It made a wonderful gravy.

This was so wonderful!  I did add a huge onion sliced very thinly, but that's the only thing I did different.  I wanted the onions to put on sandwiches and to make french onion soup from the leftover broth.

My husband loved this one but I changed it a little.  Instead of the broth I put in one packet of onion soup mix and one can of water. When the roast was done I thickened the juice with corn starch to make gravy.  Thanks for the recipe!

I make this with a cheaper cut like Chuck.  It is pot roast recipe so using a pot roast seems prudent.  The mushroom soup adds to the taste of the gravy very nicely.  I brown the roast first thing in the morning and fry up an onion.  A good yorksire pudding is also a must for us.  I have put together my own never fail recipe for yorkshire pudding, heating the muffin pans with 1/6 full of olive oil at 425 before pouring in batter which has been refrigerated for 1/2 hour.  The batter I make is 1 cup milk, 3 eggs, 1 cup flour, 1/2 tsp salt.  I then bake them like a pie..  425 for 15 minutes, 375 for 20.  They will puff up very nicely and the entire ensemble makes a wonderful, very tasty meal with a veggie on the side and mashed potatoes.

This is a Pot roast recipe that can be done in many ways. To the person looking for other suggestions to Cream of Mushroom soup-try Cream of Onion or Cream of Celery. Another twist would be to just use the dry onion soup mix with enough water to just cover the beef and cook the recommended time. Remove the meat and add sour cream with a little horshradish sauce to the remaining liquid to make a creamy gravy with a kick.

I have used this recipe for years. It never fails. You can also use 1 can of Golden Mushroom soup along with the 1 can of Cream of Mushroom soup and use 1/2 c. to 3/4 c. of water if you don't have beef broth on hand. If you don't have a slow cooker, you can also bake a 4-5 pound roast in a 325 degree oven for approx. 4 hours  It's a wonderful recipe!!! Thanks for sharing!

Instead of cream of mushroom, I used golden mushroom soup.  Based on other's feedback, I doubled the soup and broth, and added a packet of dry onion soup mix.  I threw in some chopped potatoes and carrots for a stew - it was AWESOME!  I'm making this again next week for a camping trip, guaranteed to please tired, hungry hikers :) :) :)

I just made this for tonight and it was a big hit with my husband.  I only gave it 4 stars since I altered the recipe based on a few reviews:  I added baby carrots and onions to the bottom of the slow cooker.  I rubbed McCormicks Steak seasoning over the whole roast (2lb.,which was partially frozen).  For the gravy, I mixed 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, half package of Lipton onion soup mix, and 1.5 cups of Swansons beef broth.  On top of the roast I put the rest of the onion soup mix, two Christopher Ranch Seasoned Roasted garlic cloves, and couple slices of onion.  I cooked it for 6 hours and it came out perfectly seasoned.

'Awesome' is right! This recipe needs absolutely NO changes! I do typically tenderize my roast with mustard and season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, and it worked fine with this recipe. Very tender! You've GOT to have mashed potatoes on hand to go with the delicious gravy! This is now my go-to recipe for Roast Beef. Ladies, make this for your boyfriend and he will propose!

Very very good!  I too used the montreal steak seasoning as suggested by another user, but I still think it would be awesome even without.  Also, the onion soup mix that is suggested in the other reviews is a MUST!  It is very tender and has so much flavor!  I cooked it by alternating the 'keep warm'  and 'low' settings on my crock pot because it always cooks things so fast on low.  My company and my family LOVED it!   This one we will make again and again!



EDITED 2/1/08:  This has become a family favorite.  We make this all the time!  It is even BETTER the next day.  Re-heat it slowly on top of the stove on medium low heat.  Pull it apart while it heats up.  Serve it on open faced bread and you have the BEST open faced sandwich in the WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Fantastic Recipe! I changed a few things... salt and peppered the beef, floured then seared it on all sides. Added chopped onions to the bottom with a dash of dried garlic flakes. Then, I put the meat in the slow cook fatty side down and added baby carrots and scrubbed new potatoes. I poured a simmered through mix of 1/2 can mush soup, two kinds dried onion soup, water and 1/2 a cup of good wine. Used the wine for dinner later, too! 9 hours for 6 lb cut. The sauce should be a little more than three quarters covering the cut. Allow the meat to sit in the juices after you take it out! It absorbs even more liquid that way. don't forget to add garlic cloves inside the meat! 4-5 will do:)

This is a good base for a crock pot roast. I cooked the roast from 8am until 6pm and the meat was done to perfection. I used the condensed mushroom soup with garlic, and condensed beef broth. At 3pm, I added a bag of baby carrots and a lot of mushroom caps (raised the temp on the crock pot). The fresh veggies and the juice from the roast definitely toned down the salt from the condensed soups. It was not salty at all. This is the first time my 6 yr old stepson would eat carrots! I served it with mashed potatoes to which I added 1tsp of minced garlic when mashing. Good recipe!

Love Roast Beef in a Crock Pot! I added a pack of Lipton Onion Soup Mix, and some carrots and celery. Made mashed potatoes and put the "gravy" made during the cooking time over them. Will make many more times, we loved it!!!!

This was so easy I had time to throw everything in before leaving for work in the morning. My whole family had seconds. I added some sliced onion and a bay leaf to mine, and it was delicious. I made mashed potatoes and used the sauce for a make-shift gravy, the kids loved it!

This recipe was very simple and easy to make. I added some potatoes, carrots, and onions to the bottom of the pot. Next time, I think I will omit the veggies from the roast as I thought they took away some of the flavor.

I used an almost 7lb roast, 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, 1 1/2 cans beef broth and 1 packet of onion soup mix.  It turned out really good!  I think a lot of it depends on the quality and cut of the roast.

After I took the roast out, what was left in the crock pot was a large amount of juice.  It really wasn't thick at all.  I just added cornstarch and wisked it right there in the pot.  It made excellent gravy

Thanks for a delicious and hearty recipe Dawn. The gravy is wonderful, just what pot roast needs.  I used beef broth, and a can of cream of mushroom plus a can of golden mushroom soup, good tasty balance, with chopped potato, carrots, celery and turnip in the bottom of the pot, cooked on low 8 hrs. lucious, couldn't be easier.

Oh so good!  This is my boyfriend's favorite.  I used bottom round in place of rump roast, after 8 hours it was soo juicy and tender.  I added portabella mushrooms about the last 2 hours. Very simple recipe - no stress, extremely yummy!!

Pretty good. To reduce the saltiness I read about in the reviews I didnt use condensed beef broth, just good ol' regular beef broth, also I added a package of onion soup mix. Was more like a pot roast than roast beef, but that was ok, we liked it. Made a kickin' gravy out of the drippins. Everyone seemed to enjoy. Next time I'd season the meat with a bit of pepper. Was very tender and fell apart on the fork which was nice.

This was good, I do like it better with 2 cut up potatoes and 4 carrots and I always sprinkle dry onion soup mix on top. I sometimes add a bit of crushed garlic if I have it. Also, when I've been out of condensed beef broth, I've substituted chicken broth, cream of chicken soup or a bullion cube disolved in hot water with excellent results.

Hubby and I both liked this recipe. I read that many other reviewers recommended adding some sort of onion flavoring, so I put some onion in with it while it cooked. I also used two cans of beef broth. Came out very good and tender.

This was so good.  I added carrots and doubled up on all the liquids.  I added 2 packages of liptons dry onion soup (we like lots of gravey) I made mashed potatos.  This is the only way I will make roast beef again. YUMMY!!

I liked the idea to add dry onion soup mix.  Included veggies on the bottom also.  I tried cooking for 6 hrs but it really needed the full 8 hr in the crockpot. Using any leftovers in a sandwich makes it a 2 meal effort.  After having the sliced roast beef, I added a can of golden mushroom soup plus sliced onions, peppers and more mushrooms to the extra meat in slow cooker. We'll eat it another night served on rolls.

This roast turned out moist and flavorful. I did add chopped celery, whole baby carrots, and chopped red potatoes. My only complaint is that I had to cook it on high for longer than directed so maybe next time I'll buy a better cut of meat. My husband even liked it and he doesn't normally eat pot roast. Will make again!

My whole family of seriously picky eaters could not get enough of this.  It is my permenant roast beef to go recipe.  I did sprinkle on the top garlic powder and a generousl amount of Montreal Steak Spice...the sauce was delish and meat so tasty.  Highly recommend!

This is a good base recipe. I also added the McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning on the meat and then I added a can of mushrooms toward the end and thickened the gravy with cornstarch. It was very good.

Followed the directions to the T and it didn't turn out well at all. The gravy was too watery and the taste was not good. We were able to salvage the roast thankfully by rinsing it off. Will never make this again.

This was amazingly good. I added potatoes, baby carrots, and celery to the bottom of the crockpot and set the roast on top after salt and peppering it. When it was done cooking, I added a little cornstarch to the juices to thicken, then chunked up the roast and put it back in. This was one of the best roasts I have ever had. I will definitely be making this again!

It was really good.  Used a bottom round roast from mb but would be even better with a roast from fiores.  added can of mush, beef broth and some red wine.  Made mashed potatoes.  Jim loved it and kids liked it well enough.

So good and couldn't be easier! At the end, I took out the meat, added a cornstarch/water mixture and stirred it till thickened, then put the meat back in - great gravy. Shredded the leftovers with the gravy and made killer sandwiches. The 1 year old loved the meat too! Will definitely make again, thanks!!

This is my new favorite way to make roast beef! As written, I give it 4 stars because I like the gravy mixture better with the Lipton onion soup mix added. With that added, I would rate it 5 stars. I cooked for about 10 hours since I was at work & it was absolutely perfect.

Great recipe. I jazzed it up a bit with a couple teaspoons of crushed garlic, a few splashes of steak sauce, chopped yellow onion and salt and pepper. I also threw in carrots and mushrooms. Yum!

This was very good. I added potatoes, carrots, onions and a couple of stalks of celery. I added onion soup mix with a cup of burgandy wine. It was delicious!  I made pot pies with the leftovers.

I've been making this roast for years and it is wonderful.  The house smells great and makes everyone ansy to eat!  I also put the roast together and cook it in the oven for 3 hours, (an hour per pound) and it is ready for a wonderful Sunday lunch. This is a great pot roast.

I absolutely LOVED this recipe.  I took other people's advice and also added the McCormicks Steak spice (gave it a great kick!), potatoes, carrots and mushrooms.  I also added 1 package of onion soup mix.  I cook on low for 9 hours and when I came home from work, it was SUPER moist and had amazing flavor!

I have mixed feelings about this recipe. I wouldn't say it was awesome, but okay. A simple recipe when I don't want to think to hard. I have to say everyone in my family liked the meat. My picky 3yo even ate it. Which he never eats meat. The broth/gravy is really thin. I would have like to have it thicker so I could use with the potatoes. I probably won't make again.

Taste was okay, but meat was pretty dry.  Tasted very typical of a slow cooker roast.  I wouldn't make again.

No...you don't understand...this is the BEST roast beef I've EVER eaten. I rubbed the beef with Montreal Steak Seasoning, and added a packet of onion soup mix. After about 2 hours I added potatoes, carrots, and onions.
Cooked just like the recipe said.
Amazing...perfect for sandwiches the next day too.
TRY IT!

This really was awesome! I cubed potateos and carrots on the bottom.  Sprinkled steak spice on all sides of the roast as another review sugggested with some onion power and minced garlic on top.  Layered sliced onions and mushroom around the roast.  Mixed one can mushroom soup with one can beef broth and poured over everything.  cooked on high for 6 hours and it was amazing.

My family would have to give this 5 stars. It got best dinner of the week award.  I did add an envelope of onion soup and some extra beef broth (we're gravy folks)and a package of steak cut mushrooms.  But wow, with no effort, it was a yummy Sunday dinner on Wednesday night!  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

I've made this several times and each time it's great.  I added a package of onion soup mix and about 3/4 cup of red wine.  After removing the meat from the cooker, I added cornstarch and water to the gravy to thicken it up.  Delicious over the meat and mashed potatoes.

I followed the recipe, but also seasoned the meat the night before using montreal steak seasoning, season salt, and onion the night before. Added beef broth and mushroom soup the next morning and slow cooked for 9 hours. Roast came out really good. My nephew raved about the gravy! It may have been a little salty (i can never tell), but I also used regular cream of mushroom soup instead of the low sodium healthy choice kind i usually use. Next time I will definitely use a lower sodium soup and ease up on the seasoning on the meat. This was my first roast cooking experience and it came out very good. thanks for a good recipe.

This roast beef was DELICIOUS! So easy to prepare it's just sinful. And it just falls apart on the fork.

For a REALLY awesome gravy for this, take a few ladlefuls of the liquid out of the slowcooker and put it in a pot, add a few teaspoons of flour and whisk well on high. Heat it to a boil and it's done.

I will be making this frequently.

This was good, but a bit bland.  It was easy to make...reason for the star rating.  I do think I will use again and add some spices to make it have more flavor.  Thanks for the post.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  It tastes just like the pot roast I make on the stove top, but was more convenient because I put it together in the morning and then didn't have to think about it until dinner time.  I added carrots and potatoes about an hour after I added the meat, and they came out perfectly cooked, not mushy at all.  The gravy was a little thin, so I poured it in a sauce pan and thickened it on the stove top with a little cornstarch and water.  There were no left-overs in this house!

This was a really simple way to prepare roast beef, however it seemd to be lacking in the flavor department.  Yes, the meat was moist and tender (just fell apart), but I think next time I will do my usual rub with garlic, spices, onions in the pot, tomato suace thing.  Thanks for the idea though!

Awesome is right! I added 1 pkg onion soup mix. This roast was a hit with my kids, who usually aren't big meat eaters.

I added a package of Lipton's Spicy Onion soup mix to the broth. It gave the beef and the vegetables a nifty little kick. Great results, really easy to make.

This was great! I only had a 1.5lb roast but I left the stock and soup amounts the same. I also added carrots. It was so easy too, I just threw it all in on my lunch hour and by the time I got home I had time to make some mashed potatoes. The drippings made GREAT gravy for the potatoes and my husband had a huge second helping. We had just enough left over meat to make sandwiches for lunch today. We both can't wait to have this again. Next time, I might add some mushrooms just 'cause I like them, but it was great as is too.

Love this recipe -- it's quick & easy to throw together in the morning. We love mushrooms, so I also add one can of sliced mushrooms (including the juice). When the meat is done, I thicken the liquid into a gravy... serve with mashed potatoes & it's a hit every time!

This is great!  I am newly married and inexperienced with cooking.  There was basically no way I could have screwed it up and my husband loved it!  Because there is only two of us, I thought we'd never finish the leftovers, but I heated up the meat and put it in buns with a little mayo, and he (a very picky eater) just couldn't get enough!  Thanks Dawn!

Excellent flavor!  This couldn't have been easier to make.  I used low sodium broth and light cream of mushroom soup.  I didn't have time for the crock pot and put it in the oven. . .perfect!  Will make this again.

This is a wonderful recipe. I have altered it some to suit our tastes by adding extra onion diced, carrots, potatoes and in the last hour of cooking I will add cabbage cut up into wedges. I am notorious for never making a recipe the same way twice and have experimented with various spices. Pepper, marjoram, bay leaves, chili powder all work well and if you want a bit of kick add a few splashes of hot pepper sauce, I recommend habanero instead of jalapeno.

Tried this with a 3 1/4 lb. sirloin tip.  I did brown and seasoned with salt & pepper.  Also thickened with cornstarch for delicious gravy.  The roast was overcooked but still very good.  Can't get much easier than this.  Served with mashed potatoes & green peas.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This pot roast turned out well, I added a few potatoes as suggested.  I cooked it on HIGH rather than the LOW setting, because I tried a similiar recipe in the past and the roast never did get tender on LOW.  Overall, I think I will try this again.

I made this last night as written except for just one thing which was I browned the roast on the stove on all sides prior to putting it in the crockpot. I just think it comes out better when you do the extra step. Other then that, I made it as written. I also added my potato quarters and carrot chunks before putting the roast on top and put the rest of the short list of ingredients on top of everything. Came out really well and will  definitely make it again. Husband loved it.

I used a 4lb rump roast. I cut a slit in the bottom and inserted a small clove of garlic. Then I dumped out 1 packet of onion soup mix on a cutting board and rolled the roast around in the powder (then put in crock pot). In a bowl, I mixed 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup, 2 cans of beef broth, and another packet of soup onion mix. Stirred/mixed really well, then I poured it over the roast. I let the roast cook on low for about 6 and 1/2 hours, then I added cut up red potatoes to let them cook for the next 1 and 1/2 hours. Turns out perfect! Served over rice.

I am new to Crockpot roasts and have tried 3 others in the last month. This was the best and the simplest. My only alteration was to use 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and a 32 ounce container of beef broth ~because I was using a larger Crockpot. I put the soup and broth in 1st and blended with a mixing stick for a few seconds.  I still couldn't get all the needed veggies for the 7 people eating, so 30 minutes before our meal I scooped out several cups of liquid~ added them to a large shallow pan with lid~ added a number of cabbage slices, and cooked for about 15 minutes.  Everything was delicious.
Note- scooping out the liquid & making dumplings on the side is another I do with some Crockpot recipes.  The simple recipe is on every box of Bisquick ~ dumplings take about 20 minutes. 
I have read a number of the  other reviews of this recipe.   Most seem to want to substitute onion soup, but  I wonder If Cream of Celery Soup wouldn't work great too.

A delicious easy to make pot roast. I seasoned it  with the Montreal Steak Seasoning overnight.  I used one cream of mushroom and one Knorr's beef broth. Added carrots, celery, and onions. Cooked on low for 8 hours. Removed the meat and veggies and added cornstarch and water; cooked on high for ten minutes to make a delicious gravy. Simple yet tasty. A definite keeper.

Fantastic - one of the best roasts we've eaten. Just fell apart!  Seasoned the roast with mesquite steak seasoning.  Used 1 can cream of mush soup, 1 can mushroom gravy and about 12 oz beef broth (what I had on hand.  Mixed it together and poured it over the roast. Included a small, sliced sweet onion.  Added sliced mushrooms, baby carrots and quartered potatoes about half way through!  Delish

I make this all the time. I have taken the advice of other reviewers and mix in a packet of dry onion soup mix with the cream of mushroom before pouring over the beef. Sometimes I don't even add the beef broth (like if I am out). It's always good and easy to modify. If I cook with vegetables, I put the potatoes and carrots on the bottom so that the flavor from the beef drips down over them.

Could not be easier!  Seriously, this was the best roast I ever had. I added a little bit of corn starch to thicken the gravy while in the crockpot......other than that it's a winner.  Serve with rustic mashed potatoes and biscuits and you will have the most amazing comfort food meal of the year.

So easy and great to mix with leftover rice or pasta for a great casserole type meal later in the week.

Great recipe but I never use beef broth. Just a family size can of mushroom soup. The meat just falls apart and is great for making beef stroganoff too.

I always thought the best way to get a tender, moist roast was by baking in the oven at a super low temp. This recipe blew that theory.  I even used a boneless rump roast, which made me even more nervous as I thought it would turn out dry and tough.  The end result was fantastic.  Tender, moist and no bone = more meat and perfect for sandwiches.  Added to my favorites.  Thanks!

I would like to start off by saying that when it comes to "awesome roast beef" most recipes that I've tried never hold up. However, this recipe actually is "AWESOME"! I did switch out 1 ingredient only because I didn't have beef broth. So I used what I did have on hand...Campbell's French Onion Soup. I whisked the 2 together and put the meat in. I did scoop up some of the soup mixture to put on top of the meat. I set my crock pot on HIGH for 5 hours. And let me tell you it not only smelled delicious. It was delicious! So much so that my husband even drank all of the au jus. Wow! Now that's good!

Excellent.  I also sear the roast before putting in crockpot but not sure that really makes any difference. In addition I also put veggies in with a few cloves of garlic.  Best roast I've ever tasted.

Great recipe, i cooked it on low for 7 hours and it fell apart wonderfully well. I added lots of veggies to add more flavour to the resulting gravy.

Definitely a keeper - it was very moist and flavorful!  I sprinkled a package of onion soup mix on the roast but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

This was great!  I added potatoes, carrots, and onions.  They were so tender.  I also added a couple cubes of beef bouillon.  For the last 30 minutes, I took off the cover and added a little flour/water mixture to thicken the gravy.  It worked perfectly.  Great recipe!

This was easy and delicious.  Great way to cook less tender cuts of meat.  Both my husband and I prefer beef on the rare side but this was still really good.  The meat was very tender.  I added a little cold water mixed with a tablespoonful of corn starch to make a thicker gravy.  Will definately make this again.

A great recipe for less tender cuts of beef. I used a 3 pound sirloin tip roast, which I find can be quite dry, when cooked conventionally in the oven.  I did add a 1/2 package of dry onion soup mix and lightly seasoned the roast with Montreal steak spice. I removed the roast after 7 and a half hours, it was well done and will try 7 hours next time.  We prefer our beef medium, never the less it was tender and flavorful. Thank you for the recipe ELLICAY!

Nothing fancy, just good stuff.  I used an eye of round roast since it's what I had.  I added potatoes and carrots to it as well.  Next time, I may make mashed potatoes and add some flour to the juices to make a good thick gravy.  Easy and delicious!

Good recipe. Even though I rubbed the roast with salt, pepper, and greek oregano, I really think adding the envelope of onion soup mix would have made it a lot better.  Also, mine was overdone when I cooked it for 9 hours (I fell asleep!) -- I think it may have been perfect around 7 hours.  I also added potatoes, carrots, pearl onions, and whole mushrooms and thickened the sauce into a nice gravy.  Honestly, I think the gravy makes it.  Still a wonderful smelling recipe!

Hands down - this is the BEST roast beef recipe I've ever tasted.  5 more stars for simlicity of the recipe as well. I did as others suggested and added one can of mushroom soup, onion soup mix and a cup of water.  I don't think there's a way to improve upon this recipe.  This has become a family favorite and there are never any left-overs.  ALFANNO2 might consider adding the dry onion soup mix again before writing this recipe off. I believe this is what adds richness and flavor to the taste.

Great recipe, always a hit at our house. When I make it I use one can of cream of chicken soup, one can of chicken broth and sprinkle a package of dry onion soup over the roast as well (instead of the beef broth and mushroom soup).  The gravy made from this is simply amazing!!

The title says it all!  This recipe IS awesome!!  There are 3 in my family, so just a 1 lb roast was plenty - no leftovers though, so maybe next time I'll go bigger :-)  I put big slices of onion in the crockpot first, seasoned the meat with season all, used half a can of beef broth, and half a can of cream of mushroom soup.  No water.  I also sprinkled about half a pouch of dry onion soup mixture on top.  It was so good! My husband and son both loved it too (nice when everyone is in agreement!)  I served it right on top of white rice.  It made lots of sauce to pour over the rice too.  I will definitely make this again!

I make this roast often and found its even better if 1 pkg of lipton onion soup is put on top of the roast and then the mushroom soup. I have also used a can of coke instead of beef broth. Make the roast real tender and tastes great.

I never found it neccessary to add any licquid other than the mushroom soup. The juices from the meat and vegetables create enough licquid, potential gravy for the potatoes.  I add the carrots with about 3 hours of cooking time remaining.  I prefer them el'dente not mushy.

This was the most tender roast I've ever had. It was so nice not having to make gravy since the broth and soup do it for you. I added 2 cans soup and cut up 1 package fresh mushrooms. I also added in 1 sliced onion which I'll leave out next time. The onion soup mix was enough. This is the only way I'll make roast now!

I served this dish for our yearly Christmas party and everyone raved on how good it was.  I doubled the recipe so I can freeze the the leftover but nothing was left.  I followed the recipe and the only thing I didn't do is add the cream of mushroom because my two year old is allergic to dairy, and it still came out very good.  I also seared the meat before putting them in the oven.  Thank you for sharing this recipe to all of us.  This will definetly stay in my recipe box.

Beef very tender!  I added some potatoes, carrots, and mushrooms.  My only issue was that the beef itself wasn't very flavorful.  I rubbed with garlic salt as another reviewer suggested but it was not enough. Next time, I'll add more salt & some pepper, but otherwise a good, easy recipe.

This was great.  Cooked it on low for about 12 hours and it fell apart & the flavor was delicious.  Threw some baby carrots and cabbage in with it, had NO left-overs.  But...that's always a good sign.

Awesome recipe! I put garlic cloves into slits in the beef for more flavor. I also took another reviewers advice with 2 packages of onion soup mix, potatoes, and I added broccoli. It was so good, me and my boyfriend ate the whole thing in one sitting!

Absolutely the best! My new favorite!!!This was a definite keeper at my house. The only things I did diffrent is seasoned the meat with lots of Montreal steak seasoning and then browned it very good on all sides first. Also added a cup of sliced fresh mushrooms a couple of hours before it was done. The seasoning made the meat very flavorful. What an easy and yummy dinner.

This was good, I added sliced mushrooms and they were great.  I recommend cooking this for atleast 12 hours so the roast is more tender.

It may have been what I did, but my pot roast came out tough and flavorless.  We are on a low carb kick, so I did not cook any potatoes with the roast, which I will never do again.  Pot Roast and potatoes go hand in hand.  I will also add minced garlic and some other spices next time to give it more flavor.  In all, a good recipe, but needs spice.

I tried it because of the great reviews, but unfortunately none of us liked this recipe. The condensed beef broth was way too strong, and the meat was somehow mushy yet stringy at the same time. Won't be trying this one again.

Can't get any easier than this.  I took suggestions and added regular uncondensed beef broth, carrots, celery, potatoes.  Great on a cold winter's night.

Great recipe.  One envelope of Lipton Onion Soup Mix was the key!  My family enjoyed it fully.  I added carrots and red potatoes in the beginning.  I put the vegetables in first, cans of soup and then the roast.  I used a pot roast instead of a rump roast and it turned out fine.

Well, I used this as a springboard.  I had a chuck roast, Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic soup and a can of Beefy Mushroom soup,an envelope of Onion soup mix and about a 1/4 cup of marsala cooking wine.  I combined all of the ingredients, put the slow cooker on Low and went to work.  When I got home (10 hours later) I removed the meat, turned the slow cooker on high (with the lid on) and combined some cold water with corn starch to add to the juices after they'd heated up.  This was the tastiest gravy!  10 hours was a little too long for my small roast, but it was all still delicious.  Saved the leftovers (plus gravy!) for a Shepherd's Pie, a lot like mom used to make!  Delicious.

delicious with or without the cream of mush soup. I wouldn't add more salt- it was fine between the broth and the mushroom soup.

Great recipe to begin with!  I did add potatoes, carrots, red and green peppers about 4 hours into the meat cooking!  The mixture of the cream of mushroom soup and the beef broth was wonderful!  The meat was so tender, I suggest a bottom round roast.  Will definitely make this again on a cold winter weekend!

Tasted more like a pot roast, but still very tasty.  I added two cans of cream of mushroom soup, one can beef broth, a splash of red wine, baby carrots, red potatoes, mushrooms, onion soup mix, and minced garlic.  With crock pot recipes like this, it is always fun to add a new ingredient or two to spice it all up!

I'm newly married and have never cooked a roast before.  Boy did I feel like a good wife when I looked up and seen my husbands face after his first bite!!  I cut up all my veggies the night before, so in the morning before work I was able to put everything in the crock pot and off to work, coming home to a WONDERFUL dinner.

This is a great roast recipe. The left over roast is even better!  I cut the roast up in chunks and added the left over gravy the roast had cooked in, potatoes, onions, carrots, celery, can of diced tomatoes (3 dried red peppers - my preferece), a can +/- of water and salt and pepper to taste.  Serve this on toast or whatever you like.  It is delicious.

This was very easy but I did not find it as tender as I thought. This could definitally have been my fault because the meat was not completly defrosted - the gravy was just so-so though. I DO suggest everyone try it though because it is easy.

I did not like this at all.  Probably due to the fact that I forgot to trim the fat from the beef.  It was too greasy and lacked flavor.  I am giving my dog the leftovers.  She seems to like it.

Made this as a special Sunday dinner and it rocked!  Served it with mashed potatoes and a Greek salad and it was a hit with our dinner guests.  Leftovers made for a great lunch at work on Monday!

This was Yummy!!! We came home after work and there it was DONE!!!  All we had to do was slice the roast beef. I had my husband do the honor and he didn't slice it he cut it up in chunks. Let's just say we had a good laugh. For the left overs we had it on a bed of rice since now it looks like stew!!! I will definitely make this again but I think the next time I will cut the meat and try the Onion Mix just for a different flavor. Thank you for sharing this

First roast that I have made that turned out so good. I didn't have beef broth so actually also used onion soup mix, beef stock, two beef bullion cubes and added about 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce. My 2.25 lb roast took approximately 6 hts to cook in the slow cooker. Then with 2 tablespoons of corn starch, added about 1 cup lukewarm water then combined with 2cups of the pan juices to reduce down at a boil to a gravy that was so yummy.

This is the fourth time making this recipe and it has been a huge hit with both family and friends! I follow the recipe provided and have have taken the suggestions to thicken the gravy with some cornstarch right before serving which makes it just perfect on the plate.  I have also added potatoes and carrots but my guests and family seem to appreciate having them cooked separately.

Very good, and tender. I did not have Mushroom soup or broth, so I just made it with the onion soup mix and water. I also oiled and coated my roast on both side with steak spice and then braised my roast on both sides in a frying pan for 1min. I added water to my frying pan to clean off the bits  and added this to the slow cooker. Like other reviews I added the carrots and potatoes to the bottom of the cooker put the roast on top and cooked it for 4 hours on high. I was delicious. I thickened the juices with a rue of butter and flour. Defiantly a keeper.

This was excellent!  Very moist; didn't need a sharp knife.  I used onion soup mix and 10 oz of water since I didn't have a can of beef broth.  I also added fresh mushroom slices and fresh onion slices.

So good.  Made this for my son's birthday dinner.  It was a huge hit.  I seasoned the roast with Montreal steak seasoning before putting it in the slow cooker.   I added mushrooms halfway through the cooking time.   My granddaughter had 3 helpings, and I was afraid the picky eaters wouldn't like it.  LOL!!!

I cut my 3+ lb roast in 1/2 and made it  two ways.  According to the recipe and an adaption after reading the review suggestions using  the Grill Mates  Montreal Seasoning and dry onion soup mix and beef bullion w/water.  Used carrots and onions in both.  Cooked them each on high (without the vegetables) for 2 hours and then added the veggies on the bottom and turned down to low for the next 5 hours.  Both recipes came out really AWESOME.  Great recipe, thanks for posting.

Toddler approved!! Made with a family size can of cream of mushroom soup, 1 can beef broth and 1 packet beefy onion soup mix. Low for 6 hours (only had. 2.5# roast). Melt in your mouth. Next time I'll add 2 packets of mix since it wasn't super flavorful but the gravy was fantastic! Can't wait for leftovers!

Added about 1/2 tbsp of minced garlic and 1 tbsp of onion powder. Also used 2 cups of water and 4 beef bulliion cubes instead of beef broth. The taste reminded me of what my grandma used to make.

I add potatoes, carrots and onions. To give this recipe more spice, I rinse off the roast and sprinkle McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning on all sides of the roast before putting it into the slow cooker. I mix together 1/2 of the can of mushroom soup, 1/2 of the dry onion soup mix and 1 cup water. I pour this mixture over everything and sprinkle the rest of the onion soup mix on top of the roast. I put several slices of the onion on top of the roast also.

My husband and I really enjoyed this with a few minor additions. I added potatoes to the bottom of the crock pot, then seasoned the meat with a garlic steak seasoning blend and set it on top. I mixed the mushroom soup and beef broth then poured them over the meat and potatoes. I also added some freshly ground pepper when the roast was finished cooking. It makes a nice gravy with plenty for the meat and potatoes and to dip some crusty bread in too. This will be in regular rotation at our house!

Loved the recipe and did as suggested: 2 can mushroom soup (low sodium), 1cam beef broth, 2 packages dry onion soup mix and here is my addition - 1 package Good Seasons Italian dressing mix- Sounds weird but is excellent. Does not taste "Italian". Just adds another layer  of flavour... Oh, and mushrooms and a splash of dry sherry when reducing the liquid

I followed others using onion soup mix along with beef broth and cream of mushroom. I also thickened the gravy at the end with cornstarch slurry. Has to skim quite a bit of fat off first. I will try this again with a cheaper cut of roast as I think the nice rump roast I used was better than needed for this method

I'm giving all five stars because I've never had roast this good!  I'll admit I did add a packet of onion soup mix, but really, it's the slow cooking that's the biggest key here. SO tender, falling apart good!  The juices make a great gravy too. ;)

very good. I added the onion soup packet per suggestions. I also added onion and mushrooms (fresh). I reduced the au jus with some corn starch to make a gravy to go over the potatoes I cooked with it. No leftovers on this one. The bf loved it.

what a wonderful recipe! i took advice from a few and added the veggies and covered it with a montreal steak rub before putting it into the slow cooker. I cooked it on low for 7 hrs.  If you want to know how much i enjoyed this dish...i only had one bite...put down my fork and came to write this! Thank you so much for this delicious recipe!

This was awesome!!!! So quick, easy & delicious!!! My only complaint was that it didn't taste like traditional roast beef like I had expected, it was more like pot roast but it was still really good. I sprinkled the roast with McCormick steak seasoning then mixed the cream of mushroom soup with a packet of onion soup mix, 4 cloves of crushed garlic & a large can of beef broth, enough to come about 1/2 way up the roast. I cooked on low & turned the roast 1/2 way through cooking it so that both sides got some time to cook & soak in the gravy. Next time though I will cook it for less time as my hubby & I like our roast beef a little more rare & it was a teeny bit dry, but still soo yummy & tender the meat was falling apart. I served this with mashed potatoes & balsamic glazed carrots from this site for an absolutely delicious dinner, I will definatley be making this again!!!

This recipe is the best one that I have found for roast beef in the slow cooker (and the slow cooker is the best way to cook a roast!). I always add chopped onions, celery and carrots to the pot. Sometimes I will also add chopped potatoes- have to be careful though, chances are the roast will be ready before the potatoes.

So easy and a nice moist result.  Served with mashed potatoes and used the au jus left in the crock pot as gravy.  Might try to thicken that into a regular gravy next time.    I also coated the rump roast with Montreal steak seasoning as other reviewers suggested and added half a packet of Lipton onion soup mix to the broth & cream of mushroom soup mixture and then sprinkled the remaining half of the packet over the rump roast in the crock pot.  Definitely a good work day recipe b/c it's virtually no effort at all!

I am rating this 4 stars only because I marinate my roast in a zesty italian dressing before cooking.  It gives it such a delicious flavor!  I also add gravy master to help give the gravy a nice brown color.  An absolute must as far as I am concerned, I have been doing that with my gravy for 26 years now and the gravy is a beautiful brown!  This roast was delicious.  Cooking it in the crock pot saves me so much time when I work.  You can't go wrong!

I accidently skimmed the ingredients and thought it said 1 cup of beef broth. It still tasted great but next time I'll try adding homemade cream of mushroom and homemade beef broth. Also, I added potatoes, onion, and carrots.

In a word...fabulous!  Seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic and a bit of flour, seared for a couple minutes on each side.  Mixed together can of cream of chicken, can of golden mushroom, couple soup cans of chicken broth. (Used these because that's what was in the pantry.)  Carrots on the bottom of the crock pot, the roast and then the soup mixture.  Almost 11 hours later when we got home from the office....I walked in and knew from the wonderful smell....whipped up some mashed potatoes....ta-da!!!  Honestly, have never been a huge pot roast type of gal....thank you so much for an exceptional meal!!!

I've made this recipe using beef rump roast and it was a hit so I thought I'd try it with a venison rump roast. I did rub the venison roast with an onion soup mix first then followed the rest of the directions. When done I strained the liquid and thickened it a bit for gravy, but probably didn't have to strain it. Delicious and a big hit. I've used the leftovers to make 1) potpie 2) beef with veggies and dumplings/biscuits. Basically I just saute an onion in butter add the leftover gravy, add water if needed to thin, bring to boil.  Add a bag of frozen mixed vegetables, thawed or clean your fridge and add the leftover meat, chopped.  Serve over biscuits or add dumplings on top (or don't thin too much and pour into a large piepan lined with piecrust and top with second piecrust) - always nice to get a second easy meal. From now on I will make SURE I use a large enough roast to have leftovers!

It was definitely delicious, but condensed beef broth is not easy to find! My supermarket didn't have it so I used regular and the sauce came out a bit runny. Slightly bland but very tender.

Wonderful option to the "standard" roast and potatoes meal.  I had more beef broth than called for in the recipe so we added an additional can of soup and it thickened up perfect.  We all enjoyed it and will definitely make again.

To the person who claims this was dry.I dont know how you can get a dry roast out of slow cooking,I cant see it being possible.You must of done something wrong.Next time try adding a little xtra liquid and make sure you put it on low.By the way the recipe was very good.

My wife groaned when she heard I was making another roast, but when she tried this, she was amazed at how good it was (I did add a packet of dry onion soup mix). I could eat this every week, it is that good.

Delicious comfort food! So easy. My kids loved it. I added the onion soup mix, as some had mentioned. A splash of worcestershire and a glug of red wine, just because..........so tender and the house smelled so good. I had never made pot roast before, as my husband does not like it. Can you tell he was out of town?! YUM

I have attempted pot roast many times and actually gave up until I cam across this recipe! Everyone loved it and I will for sure make it again. The only thing I did different was I didn't use the cream of mushroom soup, just because I didn't have any. I added a can of the beef broth and 2 packets of the onion soup mix. I also added potatoes and carrots on the bottom. Next time I will try it with the soup.

Very good!  I had a half can of tomato sauce leftover, so I added it to the crockpot--basically for color and slight flavor (it's only 4 oz).  I also added potatoes, onions and carrots to the cooker.  I used the liquid leftover to make a gravy.  EXCELLENT!  I would try browning/carmelizing the roast prior to putting in crockpot next time.  I think it adds more color and holds my juices.

We loved this!  I didn't have 8 hours to let it cook, so I put it in an oven bag and cooked the roast, with potatoes, carrots & onions & sauce for 4 hrs on 325 degrees.  I will make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly, and took the suggestion of another reviewer of adding McCormick's Montreal Steak Spice to the roast...it turned out perfect! This is by far the best slow cooker roast I have ever made. It literally only took 5 mins to put together and there were no leftovers :) Thanks again for a fantastic recipe.

Great easy recipe! I added the onion soup mix and used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic instead of just cream of mushroom and it was so tasty!

I made this for a special family get together and was so worried about the funny smell. Throughout the day I was opening the lid and taking a sniff. It is the worst smelling meal I`ve made out of my slow cooker. 
 However it tastes sooooo goood. Everyone loved it and my Mothers Boyfriend who used to be a Chef asked to take some leftovers home for sandwiches the next day.

We tried this recipe once before and I found it a bit bland.  Second time around I took some advice and dredged and seared the roast with flour, garlic salt, and fresh ground pepper.  I also added a packet of dry onion soup mix, chopped carrots, and red potatoes.  I didn't have beef broth, so I used chicken broth instead.  IT WAS FANTASTIC!  Both my kids and I had seconds.

I had bought a chuck roast one evening and I thought I would make it the next and I wanted to use my slower cooker because I was going to be at my kids school for most of the day. I put in about 7:30 that morning and by the time I got home the house smelled out of this world. The roast fell apart it was so tender. My oldest is 16 and he couldn't stop eating it hence the age! My husband said that this had to be the best roast I ever made. I actually bought a 5 pounder and there was only enough meat for my husband sandwich the next. I also froze about 2c of gravy.

I've tried dozens of recipes for beef roast in the slow cooker before and none of them left the meat juicy enough.  I've gotten recipes from family and friends and just anywhere I could find them and finally I have found one to stick with.  It was awesome!  My boyfriend loved it (he's a real meat and potatoes kind of guy).  I added carrots, onion, and mushrooms at the beginning then when the roast was almost done I made a side of garlic mashed potatoes.  We can't wait to eat the leftovers tonight!

I followed the instructions, plus I added Montreal Steak Seasoning as suggested. Also the juice was turned into gravy with a little corn starch. Problem was it got over done in 6 hours cooking on low. It registered 210 degrees on the meat thermometer! Though the meat was dry, it was very tender. At least there was lots of good gravy. Next time I will start checking the roast in 4 hours. I would try it again.

I also didn't have a can of beef broth so i used 3 packets of beef bouillon and also added a packet of dry onion mushroom soup with two cups of hot water as suggested previously.  I also rubbed the beef with spicy montreal seasoning.  The gravy was delicious.  I only allowed this to cook for 5 hours so this was not as tender as i expected it to be.  I probably would have rated this a 5 if i had let it cook longer.

Okay on the first try, but on the 2nd try I added an onion and baby carrots, and substituted another can of beef broth for the cream of mushroom soup. This suited my family better, and made a delicious broth base for the gravy.

This turned out wonderful. I used Cream of Onion soup instead of mushroom (guests are not a fan of mushrooms) and rubbed the roast in McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning before putting it in the slow cooker. I also added carrots and new potatoes. Again, everyone wanted seconds. It was perfect!

I followed the recipe... I ended up cooking the roast on low 10 hours and it was not as tender as I thought it would be. The meat did not have a lot of flavor but the gravy was pretty good. I really should have went with the reviews and should have added onion soup mix, carrots, potatoes and onions. I think the package of onion soup mix would have helped it a lot. On the recipe as is...I would not make it again.

I thought this was just ok, it depends on the cut of roast that you buy.  I definitely have learned that you need a better cut, in order for it to come out moist and falling apart.  The cut I got recently came out dry, but my husband loved it anyway.  I just thought it was ok.

I make this all the time and we love it! It is easy, inexpensive and tastes great. My picky eater husband loves it too. I throw carrots and onions in with it and then serve it over mashed potatos. It's a crowd pleaser everytime.

I think seasoning the roast then searing it before putting in the slow cooker would add more flavor to this recipe, also use French Onion Soup instead of beef broth if you don't have Dry Onion soup or just want a bit different taste.

I followed the recipe as written except that I added potatoes, carrots, and onion to the crock pot about 2 hours into cooking. I thought it was okay. I had to cook it almost 12 hours to get it to "fall apart," and then I was a little disappointed in the flavor (was bland to me). I think it needed something else, maybe even just salt. Overall, it was okay. I probably will make it again but add some more seasoning.

I fixed this roast for the first time while my son,daughter and grandson were here for Sunday dinner. It was absolutely delicious. I prepared it exactly the way the recipe called for only I put baby carrots in the bottom of the crockpot before cooking. I also mixed the soups together before adding. There wasn't any leftover at all! Everyone loved it.

I added a can of garlic mushroom soup as well as the broth and the regular cream of mushroom soup.  It ended up more like a stew, and the meat was melt in your mouth.  It was absolutely delicious and quickly became the favorite dinner in my house.

My husband had only two words to describe this roast, "oooh baby"!  It's tender, moist and so delicious!!  I put a shot of brandy in the gravy at the start of cooking to enhance the gravy flavor.  Enjoy this easy roast!

Put this in the crockpot yesterday before I left for work.  Very simple to make.  I had gotten a top round roast during a great sale and used that.  Flavor was excellent but the meat was kind of dry.  I may try a different cut of beef next time.

delicious and the meat was sooooo tender!  the only downside is that it needed salt.  I did add veggies at the start and think it would have been quite boring without them

I didn't really care for this that much.  The 3 pound rump roast was not that tender.  I cooked on low for 8 hours, I think that was too long.  Next time I will check with a meat thermometer.  Also, I thought the condensed beef broth was overpowering. To help with that I used 1/4 cup sherry and that was very tasty.  Next time I'm going to use regular beef broth though and still add the sherry.

Absolutely delicious! Very traditional, very easy. Do use the Yukon Gold potatoes. Anything else just won't taste as good.

This was the best pot roast I've ever made in my life! I will be using this method from now on. No more boring watery, or plain Roast for this family! Using the mushroom and onion soup gave the meal a saucy twist and a mouth watering treat to boot!

This was good, but it really needed more kick.  I would add some Lipton Onion Soup mix next time.  Definitely was more like Pot Roast.  I bought my meat from my normal butcher but it just didn't fall apart.  One last thing...my potatoes didn't cook through all the way as the liquid didn't cover them throughout.  Thanks a lot for posting.  It was good, but I would probably change a bit.

I'll give this a 3 star ONLY becasue its a very good recipe, but can be done by simply searing the meat & then slow cooking for 5 hours in Lipton onion & either golden or creamed mushroom soups + water

I have never been able to make a moist, tender rump roast until I tried this recipe.  My family, including my in-laws, all said they love it too!  Thank you so much for this recipe, I will never have a tough rump roast again.

Recipe was good, although the gravy was runny.  Maybe using less broth?  I also added onion soup which made it really good.

Wow, simple and delicious.  I was hesitant to add 2 cans of soup (thought it would be too salty) but it was perfect.  I braised the roast first and added one chopped up raw onion and 2 cloves of garlic. Cooked on low on in my slow cooker for 8 hours.  Gravy was runny so I mixed 3 tsps of flour in some water to thicken it up.  Next time I'll try adding veggies.

This roast tasted great.  The gravy I made with the juices was wonderful too.  The only problem that I had with it was it was very dry.  Next time I will make this with a better cut of beef.

This roast beef was very good. It was a little tough so next time I will try cooking it for an extra hour. I substituted water and a boullion cube for the beef broth.

This was so moist and delicious.  I added Lipton Beefy Onion soup mix which gave it a great flavor. I also added carrots and the juices leftover made a great gravy after adding some corn starch and salt and pepper. Couldn't ask for an easier dinner. Great recipe; we'll use this again!

I have been making something similar to this for years. I use round steak cut into serving size pieces and cooked with sauted onion and cream of mushroom soup in a slow oven. Never thought to use a roast. I will make this again. My family loved it.

Unbelievable roast beef!  I cooked this for me and my roommate and it was perfect.  Since we both work and attend college full-time, it's hard for us to find time to actually cook.  So a crock pot is the easiest thing for us to use.  I dropped it in on my lunch break, went back to work, then to school and by the time I got home at 10pm we had a perfect roast beef waiting for us.  I whipped up a quick batch of instant potatoes and that, combined with putting the meat on a hoagie roll, made a filling meal.  The leftovers became lunch the next day at work too! :D

My only deviation from the printed recipe was that I added an additional can of soup - the gravy was delicious, but the meat was like shoe leather. I will NEVER try this again.

This recipe did not turn out as I had hoped.  I found the gravy to be very salty and the carrots I added at the beginning were still crunchy after 9 hours of cooking.  On top of this, my beef was not at all tender even though I used the recommended cut of roast.  I was disappointed.

EXCELLENT!  I've always had a hard time making a tender roast in the crock pot, but this was a snap.  My family loved it, and it was easy to make a whole meal by throwing in some veggies to cook with the roast.  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was almost too easy!  Meat was tender, just as described.  I served it for Easter dinner as an alternative to the usual turkey or ham.  I made enough for about 16 people.  We had 6 adults and 1 child, and they all had second helpings.  I had no leftovers!

The "gravy" had great flavor. I used a packet of Lipton Savory Herb with Garlic Recipe Soup and Dip Mix, instead of the onion soup and it was very good. However, the broth didn't cover all the meat or the carrots and potatoes so I added a can of uncondensed beef broth about halfway and I should have done it at the start. The meat was pretty tender but the potaoes and carrots weren't really done. I suggest turning it up to High the last hour to hour 1/2. I will try this again hopefully next time I'll have all the kinks worked out. :)

The roast turned out perfectly.  I made this for our New Year's Eve dinner and went over great!  I added 1 packet of dry onion soup mix and inserted 2 whole garlic cloves in the center of the roast.  Will make this again.

Super Easy; I used sliced roast beef.
Super Fast; 5 minutes.
Super Good; 4 kids and no left overs.

I used it in sandwiches with some horseradish and wow was it good!

I've made this type of roast before and it has always been good.  However, I use a can of golden mushroom soup and a can of french onion soup, then bake in the oven at 375 for about 2 1/2 hours.  The gravy is delicous!

The roast is so tender it just melts in your mouth...I had to substitute cream of potato soup for mushroom, because my husband is allergic, but it worked well. My family loved this recipe.

I have made crock pot roasts before, but this is the best.  The simple ingredients in this recipe deliver a juicy and flavorful roast.  Left-overs perfect for roast beef sandwiches.  I thickened the juices for gravy with a little bit of cornstarch.  My family loves this and it couldn't be easier!  Five stars!

This dish was very easy and turned out moist like promised.  It didn't seem to be absolutely bursting with flavors (maybe the addition of some onion would help?) but it was very easy.  We had leftovers that made great sandwiches.

Maybe it was my particular rump roast, but it was very dry.  We get our beef from our farmer neighbor. His pasture-fed beef is always extremely good. But, for some reason, this turned out dry. Probably because I cooked it too fast. I was in a hurry so I cooked it on high for about 5 hours instead of on low for 8 hours.

My husband loved this recipe. He said I had “really upped my gravy game.”  I used some of the other reviewers modifications so I would have plenty of gravy. I didn’t have beef broth so used 2 cups bouillon. I dissolved 1/2 pack of Lipton beefy onion soup mix in it and sprinkled the rest on the meat as well as salt pepper and garlic. I also used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup. I cooked it on low in the slow cooker for about 8 hours. I served it as pictured with mashed potatoes and green beans. The meat was incredibly tender and apparently this was the best “gravy” I’ve ever made. And so easy

I forgot to read the reviews where they say to mix the soup and broth first.   I added garlic powder, pepper and turmeric to mine.  Turned out delicious either way.  I don't know why I didn't think of the onion soup mix.

I think a few things needed to be added but a good starting point. The roast should be floured and seasoned with pepper, browned on all sides . While browning the roast use 1 ca cream of mushroom soup,   1, 1/4  cup  beef  broth mixed well in the crockpot, and add one packet of beefy onion dry soup mix and mix well.  Put roast in crockpot and turn on low for 8 hrs. I use raw baby carrots and i onion sliced medium. I used a 4 lb chuck roast and at 7 hrs checked for doneness and removed to a corningware dish 
as we  like it cooked medium.   this makes an awesome gravey Let the carrots contine to cook until tender. Serve with mashed potatoes and choice vegetables

Terrific!! My 6 and 10 yr old granddaughters ( 6 yr old is PICKY) had seconds! The only change was i used Beefy Mushroom Soup and the Beef Broth and I also put 1 pkt of dry onion soup in. Plenty of cut up red potatos, carrots and qtrd onion. Will make this again and again!

Used 2.5 lb roast, the cream of mushroom, 1 pkg dry onion soup mix and 3 beef bullion mixed into 2c hot water. Poured it over roast in crock pot, cooked 8hrs on low. I  made mashed  potatoes as I do not like everything to taste the same. Made wonderful gravy with juices- 1/4c butter melted, added 1/4 flour til mixed well, then about 1 1/2c of pan juices and 1c of warmed milk. There are 5 of us and all went back for 2nds. Just happy there is enough left for me to take for lunch tomorrow.. I will never make a pot roast any other way again!

Loved this! Had a 5lb rump roast.  Added soup, a little extra garlic, and placed on a bed of mushrooms.  Cooked on low for 5 hours.  OUTSTANDING!

I am a crock pot fanatic and this is just about as easy as it gets. I put the roast and soup in the crock pot on low before I leave for work. When I get home I have a juicy, delicious roast ready for dinner. Prep time was literally under five minutes. I like to serve it with mashed potatoes and peas or cut up potatoes and carrots and put them in the crock pot with the roast in the morning. Save the drippings for gravy or as soup broth!

VERY tender meat.  We had a 1 1/2 lb. roast that we used and added extra veggies in the crock pot - no changes necessary (??maybe onion soup mix?? next time).  Thanks for the great EASY recipe!!

This recipe, without changes, is pretty good.  It's lacking some pizazz, but I think that could be overcome with some seasoning.  I'll use a different cut of meat next time, too.  Rump roast is often dry and tough.

I followed the recipe as written with the exception of addin g 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup as some of the others have done & browning the beef to seal in the juices. I was disappointed because the gravy was too watery. What my family liked most was the taste of the potatoes done in this recipe.  I wouldn't make this recipe again.

This was pretty good. Because I changed so many things from the original recipe, I can't give it more stars. However, the gravy from this was delish!

Great, could not be easier.  I mixed the two cans of soup in the crock pot, then just lowered the roast on top, left it on low for approximately 10 hours.  The meat turned out fall-apart tender.  The au jus was very think, but had a great flavor, I ladeled it over the meat and some mashed potatoes.  Next time I will add a little combined flour or cornstarch and water to make a thicker gravy.

Not so awesome.  Why the almost 5 stars??  I put in carrots and potatos and after 8 hours they still weren't cooked enough and tasted bad.  The "gravy" is just not good.

I'm a vegetarian, but I cook this for potlucks and at home for the family.  Modify the recipe to incude 1 package of onion soup mix and some garlic powder, salt & pepper & it is divine.  NEVER any leftovers and is always the first to go at the potlucks!

This recipe is outstanding!  Made again for Father's Day today and was a hit.  served with Mashed potatoes and wide egg noodles.  I coat the meat with McCormick's Montreal Steak Seasoning as another review suggested.  Also, I add a touch of Gravy Master Browning Sauce to darken the gravy a bit and also thicken it with a little flour and water.  Made this many times and it's a family favorite.

Eh, nothing special but thats obvious when all it requires is a can of mushroom soup and beef broth. Gravy needs to be thickened up before serving. Flavor was just ok. Will look for other roast beef recipes.

I sprinkled with the roast with salt and pepper and  browned the roast first in olive oil. I loved it. I cooked on high for 4 hours because of time crunch. I added bread flour to gravy and cooked into thicken gravy. The thin gravy made the potatoes too mushy. I thought the thicker gravy would sit on top of the potatoes. I'll see tonight when we have leftovers.

Just OK! Basically you are making beef stew in a slow cooker.  Followed the recipe and added onions and garlic cloves - still very "average joe".  Even my husband was not a fan and he is not the biggest critic!! The only recipe I have made so far that did not meet my expectation!!

My family thought this lacked a lot of flavor. The cut of meat is too expensive to come out just so-so. If I make it again, I'll experiment and add from the cabinet.

I found this when I was looking for an easy, tasty Roast Beef dish - and this was perfect! Extremely easy, and very tasty!  This is my husband's favorite meal,once he came home and was hovering over the slow cooker exclaiming that he wished this smell came in a cologne! I add an extra can of cream of mushroom just to get extra gravy for our mashed potatoes! So Good!

We loved this recipe!! Very simple yet tasty!  It is super easy to throw together and then you just let the crockpot do the work :o)  The roast was very moist and the juice made a great gravy for potatoes.  The only thing I added to the roast was garlic powder, onion powder, salt & pepper.

My first roast and it was GREAT.  I never cook, I am the microwave queen. I bought a 3 lb roast on sale and went looking for a recipe.  This recipe seemed to good to be true.  I read the other reviews before cooking.  I used the can of soup, but I didn't have any beef broth so I SOOOOOO tender.  The gravy was PERFECT.  I don't know why I didn't learn to cook earlier.

I browned roast in some butter on all sides-mixed soup and one envelope of dry onion soup mix-1 cup of water-some garlic-worchester sauce and some steak sauce to taste.  Let this sit to fully mix flavors.  Sprinkled roast with fresh ground pepper and poured soup mix over. Cooked 10 hours let cool sliced and served with sauce thicked with a mix of flour and water.  As written is 4 star-this made it better for me.

Wow! this was the best and easiest Roast I ever made. I added an envelop of onion soup mix and a little pepper to the recipe and it was great. I also used the broth to make my gravy for the mash potatoes I served along side of it. Great recipe. Thanks. Mrs.Bailey, Elk Grove,CA.

The beef was very tender and the broth was quite tasty. Overall this recipe wasn't as good as I thought it would be from reading the other reviews. I probably wouldn't make it again.

I hate roast, i have my whole life, but my husband and my daughter like it, so i have been trying different ways to make it to where we all like it, and this is definitely the best! This is from this point on the only roast i will make for my family. Thank you so much for sharing it with us.

My roommate loved it! I took other people's suggestions and rubbed the roast w/ a pack o lipton onion soup mix. Added potatoes, onion, and baby carrots as well. Cooked on high for 6 hours and came out a bit more like pot roast than roast beef, but I wasn't complaining! Parsley on top when served to add a bit of color. Served on top of white rice.

Good old fashioned pot roast, that is both easy and flavorful. Thanks for this recipe. It is a must have for busy moms. Note: I added a clove of garlic, some green onions, black pepper, cayenne pepper, salt,parsely, and chopped celery. I love to add additional seasonings and herbs to my recipe. No matter, I think this recipe would have been good w/o my additions.

This was so good!! I rubbed the roast in garlic salt and added potato cubes and carrots. I used about 2 cans of the mushroom and beef broth.  I also added about half a packet of dry onion soup mix.  It was really tasty.  My husband hates mushrooms and when he saw the can he thought he wasn't going to like it, boy was he wrong.  He LOVED it.

I just got done eating this roast and it was delicious!!! It was oozing with flavor and so easy to make. I'm going to use the same recipe for pork tenderloin too. I did make one change and that was to add onion soup mix halfway through cooking. Yum!!!

This recipe was ok. It wasn't anything special other than you can cook it in the crock pot and leave it for the day.  My husband said my roast that I cook in the oven was better tasting than this one. Won't be making it again.

I was a little leery of this since I haven't had good luck with either roast recipes or slow cooker recipes, but I was pleasantly surprised. I used the "cream of mushroom with roasted garlic" and doubled the soup and broth portions for a 3 lb. roast. Following other suggestions I rubbed the roast with montreal steak seasoning. I wound up getting home late and it cooked for nearly 10 hours; turned out very tender and tasty. A solid and very easy main course for a busy day.

Very yummy, and I love how easy it was.  I did take someone else's ideas, and rubbed my roast with steak seasoning, which gives the gravy an even yummier flavor.  I added baby carrots and sliced onions.  Great!

This was a simple, quick and easy to throw in the crock pot.  I used cream of celery soup in place of mushroom.  I also added 3/4 cup of water and reduced some of the beef broth.  I also added some sliced onion, diced potatoes and baby carrots. Unfortunately, my cut of beef did not come out as tender as I would have liked.  The gravy was good!!

I used a smaller roast (2 lbs.) so I made the recommended amount of gravy, which turned out to be plenty.  I added a half packet of onion soup mix, three chopped potatoes, two chopped carrots and about three tablespoons of minced garlic.  It was good, although I think I'll try a different recipe the next time I make roast.

I did just what the recipe said and although I would love to rate it higher, I really didn't get the rave reviews that others have.  It was OK but bland.  Thanks for the recipe just the same, it seems lots of others really enjoy it!

This was great. Although, I didn't use cream of mushroom(because of my husband), I put it in the beef broth and it was really good. I usually just season my roast and cover with water but from now on, I will cook all my roast in beef broth. I also added potatoes. Tirned out to be a GREAT dinner.

Very quick and easy.  My husband loves this and I love that it's done when I get home from work.  It makes it's own gravy and is great with a crunchy loaf of bread.

I used a 5 pound sirloin roast cooked on low for 8 1/2 hours.  It turned out tender and juicy, but it didn't have a lot of flavor.  Next time I'll try adding a few things.  I can't complain it took no time to prep and cooked while I was at work for a very good dinner.

Very easy.  My parents were coming over for dinner and I had to work all day. I put the roast in the crock pot with red potatoes and carrots and onion.  I made it exactly how the reviewer tryittonight made it and it was excellent.  The house smelled great and everyone loved it.  Will make again.

Loved the flavor of this recipe.  At first I was concerned because I did not feel there was enough liquid to make it juicy, but that was not the case at all.  I skipped the potatoes and celery as I made mashed potatoes with the roast.  I will definitely be making this again, probably in the next month.

My grocery store was out of condensed beef broth, so I substituted beef consome instead.  It was rich and delicious.  I cooked for 8 hours on low, but probably could have done longer or on high for awhile.  It didn't fall apart like I expected it to.  Could have been the roast itself....very tasty and sooo simple!

Fabulous! I used two cups of water and three teaspoons (cubes) of bouillion with two cans of mushroom soup and two envelopes of mushroom onion soup mix. It was absolutely delicious with noodles. Will try turning the leftovers into soup/stew tomorrow evening. Thanks much ~ it was reminiscent of my mum's roast.

I'm surprised this has such a high rating.  Maybe with additions others stated in the reviews it would be okay but stated and the roast was terribly bland.  I hope I can find a recipe to salvage the flavourless leftover beef, there is a lot of it.

Everything had such a good taste.  I put veggies in the slow cooker first, then the roast salt and peppered and with bay leaf.  I also thickened the sauce a little afterwards with a roue, as we like our gravies a little thicker.

This was pretty good! I added some red wine for more flavour; in the end it definitely needed a little more flavour, but nothing salt and pepper couldn't fix. I'll definitely make this again.

Tasty! I added baby carrots, 1/2 sliced onion, and sliced mushroom to my 1.5 lb. roast. I figured, it I cut the meat in half, I would cut the time in half. I was wrong. It took about 6 hrs. to cook this to the "falling apart" stage. Was a little bland and not salty enough, but could be because I added veggies which absorbs salt. I sprinkled a little dry onion soup mix over it and increased the salt, however with all the additions, I'd give the recipe a 5. Great start though, thanks!

I've made this recipe many times during the past few years. The meat is very tender..I cut it into serving pieces and return it to the cooker. I also add potatoes, carrots and frozen green beans at the start so it's a one pot meal. Serve with bread and that's dinner!!!

This was a very easy recipe.  I included carrots onions and potatoes.  Even though the meat was extremely tender, it was also extremely dry.  Nice flavor, though.

Pretty good, I thought, but not awesome. I added onion, peas, and mushroom to the slow cooker when there was about half an hour left on the cook time. After taking the roast beef out of the slow cooker, I added a little guar powder (it's like cornstarch) to thicken the juices and ladled the gravy on top of the meat. I'll be having leftovers tonight for dinner.

This is a great recipe!  It's easy to throw together and it taste wonderful!  I'm not a big roast eater but I really liked this.  The broth and soup really make the meat tender.  I thew in carrots and cubed potatos to cook along with the roast.

The first time my husband ever told me he liked my cooking was when I made this roast. Moreso, it was my very first time cooking a roast! He said he was amazed... LOL! This recipe could make anyone with no talent look like a professional.

Made this for dinner tonight and we loved it (served with mashed potatoes and veggies)!  Looking forward to using the leftovers for sandwiches tomorrow.  Couldn't be simpler--definitely a keeper.  Although next time I will try it with the onion soup as well just to see what it does to the flavor.
