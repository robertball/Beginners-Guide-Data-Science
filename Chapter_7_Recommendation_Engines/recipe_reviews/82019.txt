Two words:  absolutely fabulous!  I forgot to buy fresh tarragon so I used  1 tbs. of dried (I know - shame on me!) but it was STILL yummy.  Can't wait to make it again with fresh tarragon.  I also seared the scallops over medium HIGH heat so they'd brown slightly in the oil and butter.  Heated the oil/butter 'til it started to brown and what a fabulous flavor.  Managed to cook the scallops to perfection which took about 4 minutes/side for medium-lg. sea scallops (not overcooked).  Scallops are a favorite of hubby, as well as tarragon, so I knew he'd love this and sure enough he did!  Thanks so much for the recipe which I am going to file in my "favorites" right now!

This dish was amazing!  I didn't wipe the pan out after searing the scallops, so I had yummy browned bits in the sauce.  Served with a wild rice pilaf and fresh greens.  I was so proud of this dish, I took pictures and showed all my friends. They made me promise I would make it for them!

this was lovely.... served it with orzo to soak up the sauce.  next time, i would use little to no olive oil in the pan so it would not be so oily.  Lovely!

I made this dish for my first! ever! dinner party, and it was wonderful. Super simple, but delicious and worthy of company. I was very nervous about the evening but this recipe gave me no reason to be ashamed.

This recipe is wonderful! So simple, quick to prepare, and incredibly delicious!!! I took a hint from another and instead of wiping out the pan after cooking the scallops, I merely loosened the browned bits in the pan and incorporated it into the sauce...to a spectacular result. Goes wonderfully served on top of a bed of baby arugula with a bit of long grain & wild rice on the side. This one's staying in the recipe box for sure!!!

Great Recipe. Easy and very quick to make! I added some garlic to the sauce. Grab some fresh bread to soak up some of the sauce... excellent.

Very high rating from my dinner party guests.
I've prepared this as an appetizer, two sea scallops per person.  The difference I made was I served them on a bed of creamed spinach. My creamed spinach is simply Stouffers Spinach Souffle with a bit of cream cheese and cream. Luscious!
Before I added the scallops to the pan I sauteed a few scallions first in the pan, then added the scallops. I did not wipe out the pan either when the scallops were removed, that's where all the flavor is. 
Word of Caution: Scallops cook very quickly.

This dish was scrumptious. At the end I added some bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese and placed it under the broiler for 1 minute. Wow!

I am not sure what I am doing wrong but I don't understand part of this recipe.  It calls for 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.  I am not sure if these go on the scallops as indicated in the recipe (season the scallops) or if the salt is added to the sauce at the end of the recipe.  I added it to the sauce at the end of the recipe and the sauce was too salty so I made the recipe again and added it to the scallops as a seasoning but then they were way to salty (almost ruined).

It's always hard for me to find scallop recipes I like. This is a good one. I don't care for wine so didn't use it, but didn't miss it. I did not have the lemon for zest and don't feel that lemon juice would've worked in its place, so did without. Used sea scallops, cut in half (they were huge!) and really enjoyed the browning achieved, although I used less butter and oil than recommended. Nice touch and possibly what other recipes were missing. Served with the mushroom orzo recipe on this site. Thanks Stompy!

Great flavor, easy to put together. I used little bay scallops, and cooked them only about a minute on each side; they mostly sauteed, didn't brown, but good enough. Steamed fresh spinach in the sauce, served all over rice.

Very Good. I love Tarragon but it was just a bit overpowering. Easy to make though.

This was awesome - I made it following 1 serving - hard to guess on lemon zest - added too much - did not wipe out pan - cooked 4 scallops - used dried tarragon leaves - would like to try with fresh to compare - 9 pts WW

Great recipe, but don't use too much oil and/or butter if you want to brown the scallops.

We loved this, had to use dried tarragon but it was delicious. Made some angel hair, made extra sauce with minced shallots and garlic, poured it all over pasta and sprinkled it all with fresh grated parmasan.

Fantastic flavor, the recipe was easy to make and the results were delicious. As another user suggested, we didn't wipe the pan in order to keep the brown butter/olive oil taste. We served it with saffron risotto. I highly recommend this recipe for dinner parties or a weeknight dinner, the prep and cooking time was fast (15 minutes start to finish).

absolute decadence!  much easier than expected and delicious!  next time i make it, though, i'm going to try cutting out some of the butter - incredibly rich and amazing, but a bit over the top for the average weeknight dinner. :)

These were simple to make, and they sent my taste buds to heaven.  I didn't change a thing.  The tarragon sauce was light, and perfect for the delicate taste of the scallops.

This was delicious. I added some cream to make a light pasta sauce. I also added some coriander greens to complement the flavour of the tarragon. The wine kind of over powerded the taste of the scallops - therefore onlx four stars.

I'm a new fan of tarragon.  I never tried it fresh before.  This dish was delicious and easy. Oh,  and I didn't  alter the recipe for a change.  It was great as is!

I sauteed the scallops in olive oil only.  I added the water (instead of wine) and scraped up the bits on bottom of pan, and then added the butter.  Made a wonderful tarragon butter sauce.  Added scallops back into pan right before serving to serve warm.

I thought this was awesome!  I will keep this one and make it again and again. It was so easy to make. I did however use less than half the butter and it was still flavorful.

I have made this several times, following the recipe precisely. Last night, I followed the suggestions of not using too much butter and olive oil, and not wiping out the pan. It was absoutely amazing! We poured some of the sauce over Rice-A-Roni and my family loved it!

this was SOOOOO easy & good. i also used dry tarragon, but the flavor was 5 star. the ONLY reason i gave 4 stars was b/c i don't have a ton of experience w/scallops & the size really matters when cook times are given. mine didn't take nearly as long.

I wilted in some baby spinach when making the sauce, quite good.  Next time I'm going to try a bit of cream in there as well.

This was easy and delicious!  I used to stay away from tarragon but no more.  I also used all the pan drippings for a yummy sauce / didn't wipe out the pan.

Great recipe! One change though. I found using 1 tsp of salt was a bit much. The scallops came out way too salty. I used 1/2 tsp instead and it turned out great. Quite a bit of butter but other than that, wonderful!

Really delicious and simple recipe that brings out the scallops.  I used dried tarragon and it was still yummy.  Once I left out the wine and it was still delicious.  I make them this way all the time now

Made this a couple times and it's a hit. Used dried tarragon instead of fresh, and a little less salt, but they were still good! Served over brown rice.

This was one of our favorites.  We sear scallops often and my husband said this was the best scallops recipe ever.  I didn't have fresh terragon o so I used 1 tsp dried terragon and I had a lime instead of a lemon and worked out well.  I did not wipe the pan clean. Like others recommended, I scraped it into the cause and also added some garlic like another reviewer recommended.

Very nice  recipe.  I did find the sauce a little to tart so I added a teaspoon of sugar to take the edge off.  I served this with buttered carrots, baked potatoes and a salad.  My wife and I will be having this again!

It was really awesome and sooo easy!  Started cooking at 4 and we were finished eating at 5:10.  I agree with taking advantage of the browned yummies for the sauce. Also used dried tarragon and it was perfect. Served with a rice pilaf.  I will make again and again!

This was excellent! I didn't have white wine, so used vermouth instead. Really enjoyed it and so did my hubby, the birthday boy.  Made for a smashing birthday dinner. If you do use vermouth, watch it closely as it cooks down much faster.

I used this as a base but substituted lime for lemon at my wife's request, and I used the olive oil, a little white wine and a little tarragon as a marinade before grill ing the scallops,  Its now her favorite appetizer.
