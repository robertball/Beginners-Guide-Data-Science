I don't like very sweet cookies so I gave these a try.  Unfortunately, they were very heavy, unflavorful, and even my diabetic mother wouldn't eat them!

This cookie is tasty, I might try it with unsweetened chocolate instead of cocoa next time to see if there is a difference.  Also, should add sweetners with dry ingredients not with eggs like regular sugar.

recipe calls for 1 cup egg, I used 1 egg. Used artificial sweetner to = 1/3 cup sugar, used sweetened applesauce (by mistake), cookies are not sweet to the taste at all. Sorry, didn't like

I loved this recipe once I tweaked to suit me.  I made two batches: one as written and one in which I substituted 1/3 St. Joseph's Maltitol Sweetner and reduced the water to about a Tablespoon or two.  In comparing the two, the one with the St. Joseph's was sweeter and I thought, a better tasting cookie.  The original recipie produced a cookie that was more bitter in taste.

This is an excellent recipe- very versatile.  I have many food allergies so I used amaranth flour, flax (instead of an egg), potato milk and honey (instead of granular sweetener).  They still turned out wonderful.  Also, if you bake them for less time they stay chewy in the middle and taste like brownies!

I used honey instead of artificial sweetener and about half the amount of water called for. They turned out great, very cakey and spongy. These would make great whoopie pies!

there isnt anything delicious about this recipe. They looked good but did not taste good at all. They need flavor added.

These are easy to make . . . like a cake . . .I added walnuts and vanilla and more cinnamon yet perhaps I should have added more cocoa. . . anyway I would bake them again as something nice to give to a neighbor and it is low sugar content to me that is good

The first tray of these were so tasteless I felt compelled to try to do something to the rest of the recipe. I added more sweetening and a couple of handfuls of roasted cashew pieces. The rest of the batch was much better.

This is not a review on the Applesauce Cocoa Cookies, this is a comment on one of the review that was sent. My suggesting is that if you would had stick to the original recipe maybe you would had liked it, who would add 1 cup of eggs to the recipe when it calls for only 1 egg. SORRY.

These are pretty good chocolate cookies. Mine turned out brown from the cocoa powder, unlike the picture. I substituted more applesauce for the shortening and used whole wheat flour to make them healthier.  They had a good texture.
