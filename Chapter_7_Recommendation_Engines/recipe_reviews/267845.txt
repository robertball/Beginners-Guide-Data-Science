This recipe worked out much better for me than another I used last year.  The difference being the right amount of egg, sugar and butter and the correct baking time. Although your oven times might vary.  I left mine in about 20 min.

Delicious:). I made these twice.  The first time, I mixed the nuts in the mixture before filling.  They overflowed while cooking.  They tasted great but looked horrible.  The second time, I added the nuts dry into the openings and then filled with the mixture. They didn't overflow while cooking and looked and tasted wonderful. I will definitely be making these again.

These were cute and easy to make. I used store bought pie crust and they were just as good.  Please do not fill to the top like I did, huge mess in my oven.
