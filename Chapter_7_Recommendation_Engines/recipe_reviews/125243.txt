Excellent cornbread that didn't fall apart!  We also don't like dry cornbread so I modified a couple of things.  I used 1 1/4 cups flour, 3/4 cup cornmeal.  I also increased the sugar to 1/3 cup and used buttermilk in place of regular milk.  I also substituted butter for the shortening.  Just really followed the advice of others who have reviewed this recipe.  You can also add a bit of mashed sweet potatoes to give it a little bit more nutritional omph!

Out of the ingredients for our favorite corn bread and not wanting to make a trip to the store, I used this recipe.  Was good enough that I decided to make it again with a few minor adjustments... I cut the salt to 1/4 teaspoon as I used butter in place of the shortening.  Also I increased the milk by 1/4 of a cup and let the milk soak with the corn meal for about 10 minutes which made for a very moist bread.  I'll definitely be making this again.

Very quick and easy to prepare. I made this recipe twice because the first time I made it, I personally found the recipe to be a little on the dry side and not quite sweet enough for corn bread. So, the second time I made the recipe I added 2 additional tablespoons of sugar to the dry ingredients and a a couple of tablespoons of honey to the wet ingredients......excellent results.

Sweet and crumbly but not brittle!

This was excellent corn bread!  Just a good bodied bread that holds up to chili and soups!  I served it with my homemade chili, put the corn bread in the bottom of the bowl and scooped the chili on top, Mmmm good!  Thanks for the recipe, it is a keeper and is in my recipe box.

For those who felt that they'd like a sweeter bread, I suggest using evaporated milk instead of regular whole milk. Remember to use half evaporated milk and half water to equal the regular milk measurement. Whether you use whole fat or low fat evaporated milk, the sweetness remains and imparts flavor. For added richness, you can omit the addition of water.

I used whole wheat white flour, lowfat buttermilk instead of regular milk and melted butter in place of the shortening. This turned out well, though a little on the dry side. That could be because I used whole wheat white flour, but I see that other reviewers had the same issue. It's good, but not our favorite.

I thought this was fantastic! I did use melted butter instead of shortening and whisked it into the wet ingredients. Moist, tender...mmm. It is a sweet cornbread, so if that's not your thing, just be aware. For a variation, I cut the milk back to 1/2 cup and then added a small can of green chilies and half a small can of creamed corn. Even yummier!

Buttermilk for the milk and butter for the shortening are simply musts for this recipe if you want a crispy brown crust and moist cornbread.  These proportions and ingredients make the very best cornbread.  I have tried hundreds of different recipes over the past 40 yrs. of baking and after finding this recipe (on another site) a few years ago I've looked no further for the perfect balance of ingredients.

I experimented with this recipe before Thanksgiving, and was not crazy about it - I prefer a sweeter corn bread.  For Thanksgiving, I used this recipe as a base, but doubled the sugar, substituted butter flavored shortening for the regular shortening, decreased the milk slightly, and added almost 1/2 a can of cream corn.  That gave the bread a wonderful, moist consistency.  I also made another batch but boiled craisins in a little sugar water for about 5 minutes (just until they were moist).  I then added those to the batter before baking.  Both types were a hit on Thanksgiving - especially the batch with the craisins!

This is a very good recipe & my whole family loves it.  The only thing I do differently is omit one of the eggs...it makes a denser bread, less cake-like & I also add a little extra liquid (about 1/8 c) to make up for using only 1 egg.

Used 1.25 c cornmeal which I soaked in 1.25 c milk first and then used 3/4 c flour instead of full cup.  Used oil instead of butter/shortening and upped sugar to 1/3 c.  Thought it was great - won't last 24 hours I am sure.

This corn bread was excellent. I usually just go with the Better Homes recipe, but it has always left a bit to be desired, so I thought I'd try this. Chickie's review was VERY helpful, and I followed her modifications: "I used 1 1/4 cups flour, 3/4 cup cornmeal. I also increased the sugar to 1/3 cup and used buttermilk in place of regular milk. I also substituted butter for the shortening." It was a major improvement on the Better Homes recipe, however next time I think I'll add a can of drained corn to add even more moisture. By the way, like most corn breads, this is best eaten the day you make it. The next day it is a bit dry, however my husband eats the leftovers for breakfast with milk on top, like cereal. Lol. I'm just glad he finds use for the day old bread!

Used splenda instead of sugar and butter instead of shortening and it came out just fine.  I've had better cornbread recipes from this site though. Leftovers were used for breakfast with strawberry jam.

This made the best cornbread ever.  Some recipes are too sweet, more like a corn cake, but this was perfect.  It was very moist, with a great flavor. I followed the directions exactly the first time, and have tried it once with whole corn kernels as others have suggested. Both versions are great! This is definitely a keeper-Thanks!

Where I live this is closer to cake.  Reduce sugar to 1 tsp, everything else is GOOD. Pour into HOT skillet then into 425 degree oven.

Great cornbread; not overly sweet, but I wouldn't say it was savory, either.  I made as directed with the exception of substituting the same amount of buttermilk for the milk.  Delicious and I will be putting this in my recipe box to make over and over.  Thank you Carol!

I made this with butter substituted for shortening and turbinado sugar (1/4 cup +1 tablespoon). The flavor was excellent, and the bread held together well. This is a great go-to cornbread recipe, though it could benefit from the addition of corn kernels.

This recipe is ok. It is simple to make, but the ingredients are all wrong. Any recipe that uses "all purpose flour" makes me think the author doesn't know much about baking.

An Shortening? Hello! That is hydrogenated vegetable oil, also known as trans-fat and isnt' exactly good for you.

Technically, this recipe only deserves one star, and there is no way it should qualify as top 20 anything. But the proportions are right, and it did help me out when I wanted to make corn bread.

With a little attention to wholesome ingredients and nutrition, you could be a great cook Carol! Keep trying, I'm sure you'll get there...

To fix this recipe use: Whole Wheat Pastry Flour, Dark Brown Sugar, Butter Milk, and Butter.

Hi I like the recipe but my dad is from the south and grew up very poor he  doesn't like his cornbread too sweet so I use about half the sugar and he likes more cornmeal 1 1/4 cups to 3/4 flour. He finally said this is IT!!!!
Thanks adding two eggs helped also.

I made this tonight to use for my stuffing for my turkey.  Some reviews were good others were complaining of it being dry.  I thought it was great...just right.  I don't know what happened to the others, but mine was great.  Perfect amount of sugar and other ingredients.  I doubled the recipe for my dressing.

This sounds like the corn bread mix my mother made, but using her traditions, I leave out the sugar and instead of shortening I use bacon grease which I put in the 8x8 pan and stick in the preheated over until it's melted and crackling then pour into the batter. Mix the grease in, pour the batter in the pan, and bake as usual.

Very good, easy, good texture, just a little sweet for my liking, I prefer a dryer, less sweet cornbread, but this was good.  It was not as sweet as Jiffy, which is way too sweet for me.  I would make it again based on the texture and use less sugar.

I loved it! Hubby loved it! I was so proud it wasn't from a box. My mother-in-law makes the jiffy boxed kind and it was better than this! Served it with old fashioned potato soup from this site. Great cold weather dinner. Thanks!!!

This was so good!! I've never made cornbread from scratch until now.  I've always used the blue box kind; didn't have one on hand to go with my New Year's blackeyed peas.  I've had corn meal sealed in a Food Saver bag for eons, so I thought I'd give this a shot.  I'm so glad I did too!  I didn't have shortning so I replaced it with an off brand veg. oil.  I also mixed 1/2 c. skim milk w/half and half (had to save the rest of my half & half for tomorrow morn. coffee :D ) because I didn't have whole milk which I try to use when making a new recipe.  The next time I'll try full skim milk to see what difference it makes. Per another review I soaked the corn meal for approx. 10 min. Anyway, this  turned out moist and sweet, just wonderful.  When I pulled it out of the oven after 20 min. the center was a bit taller then the edges and I thought 'uh oh", thinking the edges would be dry~it wasn't  Don't know why it came out that way, possibly because my baking soda is at least a yr. old?  Whatever.  Like I said this was really good~try it!

Great cornbread! This was my first time making cornbread and my family loved it! I did however add 1/2cup of flour more. I also added a little more milk, and instead of 1/3 of sugar, I added 1/2cup. Also added 1 tablesppon of honey to the mix. Came out moist and sweet! Prepared it three times already.

GREAT!!!! It was gone half way thru the first quarter of the Texas vs Bama game! The only thing is that I used buttermilk instead of regular milk like someone else suggested. Used butter instead of shortening and added honey to it. Sooo soo good!!!

I'm eating this hot out of the oven right now and it's pretty good.  I took the suggestion of other reviewers and cut the flour to 3/4 and upped the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I also used canola oil in place of shortening.  The result is a light and moist cornbread that I'm hoping will go well with the stew we are having for dinner.

Very Yummy and super easy to make.
I made mine in a muffin tray which cut down the cook time and makes portion control a little easier.  I also used Margarine instead of shortening and halfed the sugar and added white corn syrup instead to help keep them moist.  Very delicious and not too sweet.

I was in a rush to my cousins babrbecue and wanted to take something along. I then decided on corn bread. I quickly came online to see if i could find a quick recipe with ingredients that i already had in the house and i found this one. All i changed was instead of ¼ cup sugar i use ½ cup and i doubled the the recipe and added 1 tin of cream corn. OH MY GOODNESS it was such a success that i dont even want to hear anything about any other recipes. The measurements are perfect, its whipped up in no time and bakes in record time. ******* This is a keeper forever.. Thanks

This cornbread is awesome!  I baked in muffin tins instead of a 9x9" pan and they took 10 minutes at 400 degrees (convection bake)  I probably could have taken them out at 9 min.  They were not dry at all - overcooking would make them dry so keep an eye on them.  
They were also plenty sweet.  Personally I would not add sugar to these.  Thanks for the recipe, I will definitely make it again!

Great recipe - very simple. Knowing my family likes a sweeter corn bread, I doubled the sugar and added probably 1/4 cup honey (I didn't measure - just poured). Also, my oven runs hot, so my cornbread was done in 18 minutes. I lined the pan with parchment, and the bread squares popped right out! Delish! Thanks for the recipe - I will use it again!

This cornbread was so simple and easy, I'll never use a Jiffy mix again! I only had fine cornmeal at hand, so actually used all cornmeal and no flour. Also, I didn't have any butter, so used olive oil instead. I'm sure the recipe is perfect as-is, as even w/ my tweaking it turned out perfect.

This is an awesome recipe for cornbread. If you like a sweeter cornbread it could use a little more sugar. Otherwise moist and yummy.

I am a novice corn bread maker, I added more sugar since most reviews said to. I don't think it was necessary came out sweeter than expected. I think this recipe is fine by itself or a good base to add corn,chiles, or whatever you want to it.

This was PERFECT cornbread and so very easy! I folded in 1/2 cup of drained canned kernel corn and 3 Tbs. finely chopped fresh red peppers after batter was made. Otherwise, I made no alterations to this recipe. Absolutely delicious with chile. Thank you!

Unlike other reviews, I did not find this to be dry or crumbly. It's exactly the way it should be. I ran out of sugar so I added a couple tablespoons of honey and used canola oil in place of shortening. It's a convenient recipe as well, ingredients usually on hand. Thanks!

This recipe is Awesome!  The corn bread turnded out just perfect!  Nice and moist, but not too moist and very tasty.  The only thing that I changed, like everyone else, is I mix 3/4 cups of sugar instead of the 1/2.

This bread was fantastic.  It had the perfect amount of sweetness that corn bread should have and it crumbled magically.  I wouldn't change a thing about it!  My family loved it too.  It goes great with dinner, or served warm with butter and jam for breakfast.  You can't get better than this!!!

Mild and delicious. A basic recipe for homemade cornbread. I added corn kernels, red pepper flakes and sundried tomatoes to spice it up. Really good flavor and easy to make, especially when you're in a pinch.

I have made this exact recipe for years.... its a wonderful cornbread recipe. Add 2 tsp of dried italian seasoning and 1 tsp onion powder to the batter and bake in muffin tins for a wonderful side for chili or soups.

An excellent recipe!!  I added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar, plus I added a can of cream-style corn, which added extra moistness.  I also drizzled some honey on the top before baking...my husband loves this cornbread!!  I make him a care package whenever he goes up north working out of town, and his camp buddies and co-workers are always jealous!!

We use this recipe every time and it's delicious! Use oil instead of shortening, only 1 egg,  and bake at 400 degrees.

I used this basic recipe to make cornbread for stuffing at thanksgiving and again to serve with chili.....this is not a super sweet recipe...but that's what my family likes. Its not as sweet as Jiffy mix (perfect for dressing!).  I did the butter instead of shortening substitution and decreased the salt as a previous reviewer suggested. perfect every time.

This was very good, my family devoured it in no time.  I followed the advice of someone here and used butter instead of shortening and I think next time I'll try the suggestion of increasing the flour and decreasing the cornmeal, just as a personal preference....it's not necessary as the recipe stands very well on it's own.

Good, but not quite as good as the "Golden Sweet Cornbread" recipe.  WE followed some tweaks that others made, but still my family liked other recipes a bit better.  This is very quick to make.

I thought this corn bread recipe was delicious! I used butter instead of shortening, and it turned out great. The only things I would have wanted to change were to use less salt and a bit more sugar, but I like cornbread sweet. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

Great! I doubled the recipe but only used 1 egg (because that's all I had) and added an extra teaspoon of baking powder to compensate. Used canola oil instead of shortening. And used brown sugar instead of white.

I'm giving this five stars because it didn't exactly require adjustments, but I found a few to be pretty helpful! Here are the changes I made: add 2 tbsp honey to the wet mix, use 1 tsp salt, substitute butter for shortening. That was it! This rose beautifully and has a nice golden color, as well as a crispy crust and tender crumb. We love it with our chili!

Great recipe!  I didn't add all the sugar, just 2 tablespoons and it turned out great.  Also, melted the shortening to facilitate mixing.  My hubby says to save the recipe.

I've made this cornbread three different times and the last time was the best. The first time it came out too dry... the second time I added a can of creamed corn and it was too moist... the third time I added the can of creamed corn and an extra half cup each of flour and cornmeal. I also increased the cooking time to 40 minutes and it came out perfect!

Great basic recipe. I used vegetable oil instead of shortening because that's what I had. I've made this lots...  add corn, cheese, green chilies, and onion for a different flare!

Very easy to make! I thought they turned out pretty good but they seemed a little bland. Perhaps use buttermilk or some other ingredient to add some flavor.

Used this recipe to make cornbread dressing. Because cornbread dressing should not contain a sweet cornbread, I omitted the sugar in this receipe and it was perfect!

Loved it! I had never made corn bread before and was apprehensive it would turn out dry and not good. ( I am my own worst critic) I was surprised at how easy and yummy it was. As recommended by other reviewers I added honey to the mix. I also put a few tabs of butter on the top of the cornbread before baking. Much better than any store bought mix. WIll be making again.

I made this, but I added some honey to the batter before baking for a touch of extra sweetness, it was great! It came out very crusty on the outside, but tender on the inside. My boyfriend ate it with margarine and more honey, and loved it!

This cornbread is absolutely fabulous. We cooked it for 32 minutes instead of the recommended 20 to 25 minutes, since using a cast iron pan instead of square pan. Repeat absolutely delicious. This recipe will be made in our household for years to come.

I thought it was delicious, but my husband thought that it was a little too dry.

I made this with some home made chili for the guys on game night. They loved it! Just the right texture for corn bread.(Okay, the British guy who never had cornbread before didn't expect it to be so dry, but he doesn't count :P) Like some other reviewers, I added a little more sugar to make it sweeter.

Nothing special. It tasted like cornbread and was fine but I don't think that I'll try this one a second time.

This is a great recipe. I doubled the recipe and added kernels from 3 ears of corn and baked in a 9x13 pan. Very moist.

Very good. I used freshly milled corn and whole wheat and it was soooooo good.  I added a tiny bit more sugar today I'm trying it with honey instead to see if it's better.  I love honey!  Anyway, great recipe and a keeper for sure.

I made this recipe, as is, with cornmeal fresh from the mill. I also used canola as the "shortening." It was rated "heavenly" by the family and my daughter, who's a great cook from TN, said it was the best she ever ate and tasted morelike a desert cake.  Yummmmmmmm!!!

Good basic recipe though its not quite sweet enough. I used 1/4 cup honey instead of sugar & will try 1/3 cup next time.
I also used butter instead of shorting cause it's what I had laying around.
Last I added some defrosted frozen corn. Came out well but like I said, it needs more sweetner.

An easy, basic recipe that's delicious. I used 1/4 of canola oil rather than shortening because that's what was on hand. Very tasty.

I picked this recipe because we were running low on butter. Made it exactly according to the recipe. It tastes wonderful, but is definitely a tad dry and crumbly.

This corn bread is very good. I followed some other reviews and added 2 more tablespoons of sugar to the dry mix and one tablespoon of honey to the wet mix. It goes very well with Chili!!!

Very good indeed. Didn't have milk, so I used half & half, and added slightly more than a cup for a smooth batter. Also used plain, old melted lard for the shortening and cut the sugar down to one tablespoon and it tasted great.

I never made cornbread before, so I tried out this one with no modifications. It turned out more like corn cake, but I blame it all on my mixing methods. Definitely came out great still, and tasted wonderful with some homemade soup. Definitely great for these cold winter nights.

This is so simple and quick to make. The taste is lovely, given the minimal effort required. I went scant on the flour and cornmeal measurements and a little heavy on the sugar,  to allow for the advice from the other commentors.

Cooking for one sucks most of the time because you have so much left over and all recipes do not lend well to halfing. This one did.

I made it for 5 servings, used egg replacer and added more butter. I baked it in a loaf pan for about 20 minutes, then put more butter on top for browning. It was AWESOME!

I made this gluten free and it came out great. I used 1 cup of Bob's Red Mill brand gluten free all purpose flour instead of AP flour from wheat. Normally you should add Xanthan Gum, about 3/4 tsp for this recipe, but I forgot and it turned out just fine.

I used 1/2 cup of Sucanat because I didn't have white sugar on hand and added 1/4 cup of local honey (wildflower). I find using a liquid sweetener helps moisten the batter when using gluten free flours.

I also soaked the cornmeal with the milk like another reviewer suggested. Not sure if it did anything but it didn't hurt. I just had it soaking while I prepped the rest of the recipe.

The other thing I did was use butter instead of shortening. I know many swear by shortening but I always use butter in lieu of it and it seems fine to me. I used cold butter and sliced it into thin pieces. I added it to the dry ingredients and mixed it with my hands.

I also cooked it in my cast iron skillet. It took about 15 minutes at 425 degrees. We ate it with a little honey butter spread on top of it and chili.

My kids, ages 5 and 7, and my husband all enjoyed it. We've just started to try and not have so much wheat in our diet - no Celiac in our family but I have been reading so much about the unhealthy aspects of wheat that we're trying to not eat so much of it.

Good Base recipe. Used a white whole wheat flour. subbed butter for shortning. and cooked it in a cast iron skillet. I feel it could be a tad bit sweeter and more moist, so next time i'm going to try using evaporated milk, and maybe some creamed corn. It was good, and I and the hubs were very pleased.

This is by far the best cornbread I've ever made. Plus I think it is the healthiest! I did add a 1/4 cup of flour and only 3/4 cup of cornmeal. I also added a tablespoon of vinegar to my milk and used margarine instead of shortening. The result was a moist and mildly-sweet cornbread that no one could stop eating!! Will make many more times, that's for sure.

I gave this recipe a bad rating because my corn bread tastes REALLY bad. I can't tell whats throwing off the taste. I followed the recipe 100%...I do like sweet cornbread but this is not just unsweet (I saw some others said that they added more sugar), it actually is leaving a bad after taste (at first its yummy, its the aftertaste that I'm not caring for)...  When I try out new recipes they generally taste good....But I'm not afraid to admit that this could be the result of a "user error"

I always love cornbread and this was a good recipe for it.  I used butter instead of shortening and added a little extra sugar.

I am non-dairy and low-gluten, so I substituted white spelt for the all-purpose flour, rice milk instead of cows milk, and a non-hydrogenated spread for the shortening.  I mixed it all together, put it in the oven, then held my breath.   It was excellent, a really nice surprise!   I will definitely make it again.

Used Margarine instead of shortening, not sweet enough for me, but easy to make.

This was great. I am positive the recipe did not need tweaking, but because I like what I like.......I added 1/4 c of sour cream to the milk (whisked), used 1/3 c sugar (ah, sweet on the 'dogs) and used melted/cooled butter instead of shortening. I used it to make baked corn dogs using Omaha Steaks gourmet franks. Simply delish! Thanks Carol.

Very easy and delicious recipe for corn bread.  I cut down on the sugar since I was serving it with a bean soup and didn't want the sweetness.  I also substituted curdled milk (vinegar) for the buttermilk.  I will definitely make this again, although I will try another reviewer's suggestion and "soak" the corn meal in the milk for awhile before mixing in remaining ingredients.  I am hoping that will make the bread a bit less mealy and more tender.

I made this today but made small changes. I added a bit more milk and sugar and used butter instead. I thought it was OK but not great.I think I would have liked it more if it was a little sweeter.

I followed a previous review and used 1 1/4 cups gluten free flour blend, 3/4 cups cornmeal and 1/3 cups flour.  Excellent, moist corn bread!  I will definitely use this recipe again!

We have RAVE reviews at our table.  This recipe will be the "only" cornbread that I ever use again.  The only change I made was to do 1 1/2 cups cornmeal and 1/2 cup flour.  Not a bite was wasted!

I followed one of the earlier listed suggestions and added a (long) squirt of honey.  It was still a tad dry; next time I'll use buttermilk instead of skim.  This was a winner with both kids and adults at the table.

wondeful basic recipe. used butter instead of shortening, added a can of corn like someone recommended, and added a bit of vinegar to the milk to make it buttermilk. i don't like sweet corn bread, so didn't change anything else. this was moist and perfect. Is definately a favorite recipe.

I did make a few changes, as I wanted to bake in a 12 inch skillet: I doubled complete recipe; 3 eggs, brown sugar instead of white; corn oil instead of butter.  Will use 12 inch cast iron skillet. Follow-up, it needed the extra egg, as it was just a little crumbly, but otherwise very good.  I do enjoy baking in the cast iron skillet.  Really love this recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

This was the best cornbread we ever had!  Moist, flavorful, not at all crumbly!  I did replace the shortening with an equal amount of butter, because that's what I had on hand.  I also added 1/4C of honey to the batter.  Fantastic!  Thank you!

Made this to use in the cornbread dressing for Christmas dinner. It turned out perfect. Moist, delicious, not too sweet. I took some of the recommendations and used less flour and a little less sugar.

The flavor was great but the bread was soooo dry.  I timed it perfectly and followed the recipe exactly so I'll look around for a more moist one.  Thanks though.

This cornbread was excellent! We actually used this recipe to spread it on top of a chille for "tamale pie." The cornbread was perfect! Crispy on the outside, soft and sweet in the middle. I didn't have cornmeal so used polenta instead.

This is the best cornbread ever! I added a couple tablespoons of honey and Oh my gosh! My son said it was awesome and I will make this recipe from now on. I did have to bake it a bit longer than recipe stated but no big deal. It was perfect. I may add some cream corn to it next time and see how that works but it's perfect the way it is. Thank you so much for this recipe!!

I used white cornmeal because that's all I had.  I don't usually like corn bread and I made it just to please my husband, but I thought it was very good.  My husband recommended adding honey next time, as did previous reviewers so I will try that in the future.

This is really good. I used fine cornmeal and butter instead of shortening. I added 1T honey like other ppl suggested but I think I'll add another 1/2-1T of honey to make it sweeter. I'll definitely make this again.

I thought this recipe was unexciting. The cornbread was fairly dry, and I probably won't make again.

This is a good recipe. I heeded the advice of one reviewer and used fat free plain yogurt instead of milk to cut some of the dryness. I used 1/3 C. of a half and half mixture of splenda and sugar as well. I also added in 3/4 can of corn kernals. I only gave it an average rating as I made changes to the original recipe.

This is a really nice recipe. I made muffins instead of traditional corn bread, baking time was just under 20 minutes. I followed the recipe exactly, except for the addition of a can of sweet, whole corn kernels. Not too dry, not too moist - just perfect!

I just about doubled the sugar and it was very good.  Next time I will add whole pieces of corn.  This one is a keeper.

I used butter for the fat & used a glass pan w/non-stick spray.  it baked up with a nice crispy crust - good stuff!  I'll add a little extra sugar next time, but otherwise the taste & consistency was just what I was looking for.

Really good!  Just the right taste and consistency, and really easy to make.   The only change I made was using butter instead of shortening.  Next time I might use canola oil... and there will definitely be a next time!

This recipe was soooo good! I actually forgot to add the shortening (was going to have to substitute margarine anyway) and it still came out tender and held together, as opposed to crumbling on me when I tried to serve it. I will be saving this one!

Good recipe...it wasn't dry, very moist. I would make a few changes next time.  I only used 1/4 tsp of salt, and it was still a tad too salty, so I am going to omit the salt all together next time, and increase the sugar.  Other than that, it was a good recipe.

This recipe was delicious! I basically kept to it, and added a few things. I know some people say this makes it a different recipe, but the things I did were minor. I sifted the flour to make it airy, added 1/8 cup brown and 1/8 cup white sugar, reduced the shortening by half, and added applesauce. (It cuts down on calories and also makes it super duper moist). Then I added like a 1/2 cup of grated cheddar cheese and a cup of corn kernels. I made this with Coleen's Jambalaya recipe and it made the perfect side dish! Thank you for submitting! I can't wait to make it again!

This recipes is pretty good...I did change a few things. Upon the suggestions of other reviews I increased the sugar to 1/2 cup, and also made my own buttermilk (1 cup 1%milk minus 2 tbsp, and added 2 tbsp lemon juice. I also baked it in a 8inch square pan for 20 minutes on 400 degrees. The results were a bit too sweet, maybe the original amount of sugar would have been fine. I am also partial to a more crumbly cornbread, so due to the sweetness and cakey texture, It gets 3.5 stars in my books.

I was out of butter for my regular recipe so I tried this one out instead.  It was okay.  Texture was good, but flavor was a bit bland to me.  Still searching for THE cornbread recipe.

I always come back to this recipe for cornbread.  I made one substitution and one addition: masa harina instead of cornmeal, and stir a can of creamed corn into the batter.  Delicious!

I personally LOVED this cornbread even though my husband prefers the "Buttery Cornbread" recipe from this site.  I added 2 tbsp honey, used 1 tsp of salt and butter instead of shortening since that's what I had on hand.  I used this to make Cornbread Dressing for Thanksgiving and it was fantastic!  I will definitely keep making this!

Very good and moist.  Not too sweet, which I like.  I added cheese and chopped chives/jalapenos.  Good basic cornbread recipe.  I served it with white chili.

This is my go-to cornbread recipe.  Since we are Yankees I double the sugar and I substitute vegetable oil for shortening for convenience.  I have found this recipe turns out just as tasty with whole wheat or spelt substituted for the flour.  I always make it with skim milk.  It works well for muffins too.

Pretty good traditional cornbread, I would have liked it a little sweeter. I did double the sugar, but I think I should have added honey or brown sugar.

Personally, this recipe was not my favorite. I substituted the 2 eggs for 3 egg whites, and the shortening for applesauce. It might have been these changes that could have altered the taste. The bread was spongy and put together nicely, but the taste was ok.

FANTASTIC!  I added fresh cooked corn kernels to the batter (about half a cup) and butter to the completed bread.

I whisked the eggs, milk and 1/4 cup of olive oil (my favorite shortening) together before adding to the dry ingredients.  The corn bread was moist and tender, "the best" and our "favorite".  Not a crumb remains.

Measurements were perfect, my husband loved it. The only thing I did differently was cooked it in an 8x8 pan.
Serve warm with a bit of melted butter.......MMmmmmm
I'll be making this again! Thanks

I loved this recipe. It reminded me of my mom's cornbread that I have never been able to duplicate. I will be making this again often.

Simple, yet impressive.  I especially love that I can make this delicious bread from kitchen staples and don't have to go out to buy specialty ingredients.  They can be made in short order - great for occasions involving unexpected dinner guests.

A good, basic recipe for cornbread.  Not too sweet, not too dry.  Very easy to make.  I used melted butter instead of shortening - yummy!

The cornbread is really good!!! While it isn't as good as some cornbread I've had before, it is much better than many. Thanks for the very enjoyable cornbread!
