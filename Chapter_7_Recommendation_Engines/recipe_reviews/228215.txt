A tasty, quick fresh summer salad. I substituted Balsamic Vinaigrette Salad Dressing & left out the parmesan cheese. A quick and refreshing side dish.

Very quick, easy and tasty.  I used garden fresh tomatoes and cucumbers from a local growers vegetable stand.  I'm sure the quality of the veggies made a difference but this is a definite keeper.

I like the garden fresh ingredients to this salad, but, it was just a little bland to us.  I used a good quality dressing with it, but, I think I would prefer a homeade vinaigrette with a nice tang from vinegar.

I  usually make this with vinegar instead of Italian dressing, and a little bit of sugar.  My grandkids call this Bob & Larry salad (Veggie tales).  I don't use cheese.

Haven't tried the recipe, but my family has been making this for years.  We add blue cheese crumbles to the salad, gives the salad a bold taste.

This was a very good recipe! I left out the onions since my hubby & I don't really like raw onion. Couldn't stop eating it!

I made it for my husband.  He enjoyed it a lot, but since he suffers from "This isn't my recipe syndrome," it wasn't fabulous!  It will grow on him.

Great easy summer salad! My husband doesn't really care for tomatoes and he loved it. I substituted the parmesan for shredded mozzarella cheese. To get it chilled quickly I stuck it in the freezer for 5 minutes then the fridge for another 10. Perfect!

I agree with other raters: This is a 4-star recipe, which can easily be elevated to a 5-star recipe depending on choice of ingredients and preparation. It is very simple and quick. I prefer to substitute 1 small finely chooped Vidalia or Peru sweet onion (1/2 cup up to 3/4 cup) and to substitute balsamic vinaigrette for Italian salad dressing. Be sure to drain as much water as possible from the vegetables/fruits before tossing with vinaigrette and cheese. After thoroughly tossing salad, let salad stand 10 minutes then drain excess liquid before serving or storing in refrigerator.

It's ok, but I prefer tomatoes, cucumbers, and plain old lemon pepper-let it sit for about twenty minutes, drain and mmmmm yummy, definatly not bland.
