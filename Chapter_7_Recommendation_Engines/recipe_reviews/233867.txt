I really liked the bison pepperoni...just full of flavor and made this a tasty salad! This is quick and easy and a great dinner for a hot summer night! TIP:If you cannot find leeks or do not care for them, I subbed celery. I will make this again, thanks for the recipe!

Family didn't care for fennel or basil in this recipe, but that is a personal choice. I thought the sausage was pretty good, maybe a little more spice would make it super tasty. Beautiful looking salad.

In order to accommodate dietary restrictions, I made a few changes.  I used a mix of spring greens and spinach in place of romaine, omitted the mozzarella chunks, replaced the sour cream with low fat yogurt and used low fat mayo and milk for the dressing.  Everyone loved this salad and I will be making it many more times, as soon as I locate a source for the bison pepperoni.  Thank you so much!

Very good salad, the dressing made it.  Creamy and the basil flavor stands out just enough without being overpowering.  I did use partially dried basil instead of fresh because that is what I had on hand, but the flavor still stood out plenty.  Also I could not find bison pepperoni anywhere, so subbed with an Italian Dry Sausage.  It was good, but wish I could find the bison pepperoni somewhere to try it out!

My husband said this was the best salad he had ever eaten- and I would say it is in my top three.  Our store did not have Bison pepperoni, but I substituted a Caprese-flavored chicken sausage that was very good.  The fresh mozzarella, fennel, and basil make this a memorable delight indeed.  It would make an excellent light supper by itself with some crusty bread dipped in seasoned olive oil.
