Well, I may be a Northerner but I know a good cheese spread when I come across one...and I can see why this is a Southern staple. This definitely is creamy, cheesy with just the right amount of kick! What's great about this is it's relatively cheap to make and doesn't require a lot of ingredients or effort. I definitely recommend getting a block of good cheese and grating it yourself. I didn't have Velveeta on hand so I subbed 3 oz. of cream cheese and the rest extra sharp Cheddar. I cut back on the mayo only using enough to get it nice and creamy. I used green onion finely chopped and 1/4 tsp. of Worcestershire. I also left out the red chile pepper and pecans (personal preference as we were serving this to guests).  This was great on an assortment of crackers and veggies. And I can definitely see this as a burger or hot dog topping - or as they do in the South...in a sandwich all by itself!

This is without doubt the very best pimento cheese I've ever had. It's always requested of me during football season for tailgating.  Great on a sandwich or with crackers and chips.

I had such high hopes for this recipe.  I love Pimento Cheese and am on a quest for the perfect recipe.  Unfortunately, this is just not it for me.  I think it was the Velveeta;  seems I just apparentlly don't like it any more, and the whole batch was inedible because of it.  Thanks for the post, and the opportunity to try the recipe.  And don't be put off by my review...if you like Velveeta, you will probably love this one as the other reviews gave high marks.

Similar to a recipe I usually make.  Instead of Velveeta, use 4 oz cream cheese and increase the sharp cheddar.  Double the amount of pimentos and finely grate your onion.  I like tobasco instead of red chile pepper.

This was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!! I have never made/eaten pimento cheese before, but it seemed like something that I would enjoy, so I gave it a go...YUMMY!!! I made this exactly as written and would not change a thing. I was literally eating this with a spoon...it's addictive, lol. I will definately be making this very often! Thanks for sharing. :)
