I LOVE this recipe!! I’ve tried several and this is it for me. I divide the icing into small bowls, then add coloring, then add small amounts of water to get the right consistency. Also..if I needed stiffer icing, to use for piping or to decorate, I just added small amounts of powered sugar. it’s a VERY easy recipe to work with and it’s not touchy at all. 
So happy!!!!

This is an excellent recipe. Best royal icing I’ve ever made. Has a nice shine to it and perfect consistency. I reduced the vanilla and added 1/4 tsp of almond extract. Delicious.

This was the best! I've tried a lot of icings, but this was the easiest to work with, dried so that cookies could be stacked but it did not get too crunchy to eat, and it flowed beautifully. Don't be afraid to add extra water if you are flooding. I also added 1/2 tsp almond extract for a touch more flavor.

keep adding water for the right consistency. I also added lemon flavor to my gingerbread icing. Terrific!!!
