This was a simple and tasty dish. My 17 y/o insisted it go in the dinner rotation. I had a couple of minor changes. I substituted cream of chicken/with herbs soup for the cream of celery and added some garlic powder. Will definitely  make again soon.

I tried this recipe last night for my roommate and myself and followed the recipe exactly.  We both really enjoyed it and will definitely make it again and pass this recipe on.  I didn't use instant rice but rather jasmine rice which I think has better flavor.  But I guess you can't go wrong cooking with cheese!

Easy and quick to make. I used skinless chicken thighs. The kids really liked it, but I found it kinda bland.

This was excellent.  A hot and hearty meal.  Since I had shredded cheddar cheese and used that instead.  Since I had the cheese out, I made cheddar biscuits to go with it.

This was okay... I have tried cream of celery and cream of chiken and didn't find anything exciting. Kind of bland, but an okay dinner when pressed for time. Next time I will season the actual chicken and cut down on the amount of coup used.

Needed something more.  Tastes too much like just soup on chicken.  Really needs some more flavor added.

Wow this was so good. My family gobbled it up. I loved the cheddar and mozzerella cheese mixture. It was so gooey. I used a garlic herb shake and bake mixture. I will keep this in my dinner rotation. Also next time i will try it with mash potatoes.

I cooked this for supper. I was so good. I didn't have the cream of celery but I did have cream of mushroom so I used that. Thank you for this delish recipe.
