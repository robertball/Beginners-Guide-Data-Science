This is a great base recipe and can be "fussed up" to each households tastes. I made the following modifications to this recipe and LOVED IT!  After browning the pork in the skillet I added the following; 2 t cumin, 1 t garlic, 3 T fresh cilantro, half of one small onion sliced and 3 t lime juice. After simmering to meld the flavors I added 1 small can corn and 1 small can black beans. Topped with cheese, green onions, sour cream and homemade salsa on a fresh warmed tortilla. Next time I will have avocado sliced as well...yum! With these few additions, this recipe went from Good to Awesome!! Thanks for the post!

Wow!  It was great!  I took the advise and cooked it with some cumin and red pepper and it really gave it a great kick.  Would add corn, black beans, and rice if I had more time.  Definatly an amazing recipe!

This is a Great Recipe, however we found for our family that we needed to add a little more to the burrito, rice and corn along with the sour cream and pork, made this an excellent dinner combination

This was great, not exactly gourmet but sooo fast and easy, and very tasty too!
I scaled the recipe down to four servings, but found that it didn't make very much - there wasn't a lot of filling for each burrito.  I thought we'd have leftovers but my husband and I ate all four servings for dinner.
I think next time I'll add a bit of cumin to give it a bit more zip.  Thanks!

Hey, this recipe was awesome.  I did as an experiment and my folk loved it.  My variation was less formal using sour cream and green onion for garnish.  I also coated the burrito with dry shredded cheddar which eventually made a second coat for the burrito.  Delicioso

Wow! I loved these. I sometimes forget that a good recipe doesn't have to have tons of ingredients and steps. I did add some chopped jalapeno just because I like spicy. Thanks for the recipe.

Quick, easy and very tasty!  I also added jalapeno for some extra kick.  This makes enough for about 4-6 servings, certainly not 10.

Okay, I am going to go ahead and rate this even though I did change this by adding more spices.  If I had little ones, I might leave it as written, but I was pressed for time and didnt want to search anymore so decided I too would add my own spices.  5 pork steaks was a lot to fry up in my pan which was fairly large, but once finished in stages, I combined them all back together and seasoned up once more.  I kept my sauted onions & peppers on the side, as well as the picante, cheese, sour cream and refried beans.  I did add some green onion for a splash of pretty color.  It came together in a decent time frame and everyone enjoyed it.  Will I make it again?  I am not sure.  I like beef but this might be good for pork night when I forget to marinate the roast again.  However it was a nice little recipe that didnt take too long or too complicated.  Thank you for sharing.

Thank you! I had defrosted some cubed pork steaks (like cubed beef steaks) and wanted to try something fast. I saw this and thought it was simple enough and sounded delicious. I am glad I tried it.  It will be a regular when I have pork steak (cubed or not).

So flipin easy you have to make this once a week.  My husband loved this.  To bad I did not make more for left overs.  The only thing I would change is to make it hotter.  But we love hot. Thanks

YUMMIE!! My husband and I LOVED these burritos!! We also thought there would be leftovers, but we ate them all! LoL.. The only thing I would recommend is using Medium or Hot salsa if you like your food spicy, I also added 1 tsp. of chili powder for a little extra spice. Such an easy delicious recipe! We will make this again soon!

I have to give this 5 stars because both kids cleaned their plates and that doesn't happen very often.  Very simple recipe.  I wish I would have found earlier.  Thanks!

I could not find the pork steaks at the store so I substituted with thin pork chops which turned out very good.

A good recipe, but only 3 stars as is because we had to add more spices to give it flavor. Cooking the pork with just bottled salsa was bland. As others suggested we added cumin, and a little red pepper and chili powder to the pork as it cooked in the skillet. Also, the meat was a bit chewy and not as tender as we would have liked. Maybe next time we'll try pounding/tenderizing it?

Good! I did feel the need to add quite a few spices, but this is a good base. Served with guacamole, shredded cheese, sour cream, tomatoes, black olives, etc. Thanks!

I usually barbecue pork steaks, but it is much too cold for that, so I tried this for dinner last night. I did add rice, black beans, and corn. We really enjoyed it.

I made this last night and was actually surprized at how good it was! I did season the pork with salt, pepper and cumin. My pork steaks had a lot of fat on them and were pretty thick so after they were done cooking I cut them into cubes and took off all the fat. I also added shredded cheese and fresh tomato, avacado, green onion, and jalapeno. Soooooo good!! Thanks for the recipe, I will use it often!

We loved this recipe. The only thing we did different is I baked the burritos for a little while. My hisband thought they then tasted a bit more like chimichangas, but we will definitely make this again!

Great recipe. We doused the pork with taco seasoning during cooking and served it like soft tacos, with small four tortillas, home made salsa, lettuce, sour cream, and cheese. Dinner was literally on the table in 20 minutes and everyone loved it. We'll make this one again!

This is just a wonderful,simple and very tasteful dish. Cooked up in no time at all and oh my goodness just great. I used stirfry pork instead of pork steak and added just white onion in with the steak when cooking and used my own homemade salsa. Just wonderful. Highly recommended for the busy house hold.

YUMMY! How could something so simple taste so good? I put the sour cream and green onions in the burritoes. You can heat all tortillas at one time if you leave them in the bag and warm in microwave.
