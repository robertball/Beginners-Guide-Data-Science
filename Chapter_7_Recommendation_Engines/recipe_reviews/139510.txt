I authored this recipe but since it was written and 2 years later published I've made a few changes.  I add about 1 cup of cream and about 3 tablespoons of fresh chopped basil at the end.  This is so good for a quick and easy meal for company or just a quick and easy meal for your family!  Update 12/5/09 - This originally called for 12 oz of angel hair pasta but AR changed it to 16 oz of linguine.  Not sure why but you may want to change the amount of pasta to only 12oz.

This is an amazing recipe! I used a 28 oz can of petite diced tomatoes with the juice; I just had to cook it down slightly more; I also added 1/2 of an onion, chopped with the garlic and a few extra dashes of the cajun seasoning at the end. Served with fresh grated parmesan cheese - this recipe is amazingly yummy!!! Made it for my mother in law's birthday - whole family loved it!

This was such a terrific tasting recipe. I wanted to make it a bit heartier so I added red and green peppers and some mushrooms. I cooked the veggies and shrimp separately and added some red pepper flakes then just added it to the tomatoes when they thickened. The tomatoes, wine and butter made such a tasty sauce. A keeper recipe! Thank you!

If only I could give extra stars for being so easy and so tasty! For the tomatoes I used 2 cans of petite diced and one can of crushed with a tsp. of sugar (I also added in a tsp. of the cajun seasoning to the sauce).  Following the advice of the recipe  submitter, I added basil and also added the cup of cream that she suggests.  I served this with a good coating of fresh parmesan on top.  DELISH!  Thanks for sharing a fabulous recipe, Cindy!!

This recipe was good but I agree with everybody that it needs more flavor... that is why I gave it 3 stars and not 4 or 5. If I make it again I will add fresh basil or cilantro on the top. Also you need to double the amount of sauce if you have more than 3 people. My sauce was not sweet like other people said, it was perfect in flavor, I think it was too sweet for other people because of the wine they used. My sauce was too watery so next time I will add some thickener to it. The best part of this recipe was the shrimp.

I would give this more stars if I could!!! Absolutely love this recipe. I used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, which I pulsed in my food processor a bit. Used about 4 cloves of garlic and omitted the wine (since I didn't have any.)Perfect!!! I am sure if you follow the directions exactly that it will still be perfect. I am not sure if this is an Italian or Cajun recipe but it reminds me so much of meals I had while living on the Northern coast of Italy. Thank you for sharing.

For some reason we simmered the tomatoes at least twice the recommended time and the sauce consistency never happened.  We also found it to be slightly bitter, adding a scant teaspoon of splenda cured that.  Hubby is Italian and makes his own sauces which simmer for at least 4 days, we were looking for a quick and easy dish to take to a potluck.  This worked wonderful for that.  Others mentioned this being on the sweet side, since we followed the recipe am sure wondering where we went wrong.  Do appreciate the easy recipe.

Very good!  I upped the garlic and cajun seasoning to make it taste more spicy than sweet.  Next time I may add a few more tomatoes to make a little more sauce.

Great recipe idea, but I did change it up, so I felt I could only gave it 4 stars as written. First, I used only a half lb of  cooked large shrimp because there were only 2 of us, and this sounded like it would be best served fresh, not left over.   What I did was saute the garlic, added 2 cups of halved grape tomatoes, the butter, and the wine.  I didn't want a thick marinara-type sauce, so I only simmered about 10 min.  In the meantime, I tossed the shrimp with the cajun spices (made my own with onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, cayenne, red pepper flakes and paprika).  I added the seasoned shrimp to the "sauce", simmered it until heated through, and served it on orzo.  Topped with fresh basil and parmesan cheese.  Delicious.

Mwood COMPLETELY changed the recipe and then gave her own recipe 5 stars.  Just make the recipe as people submmit them and rate that recipe.  Or else submit your own recipe.  I just don't get this and I see it so often on this site.  This recipe as is was very good.

This is easy and good. I make it frequently. The suggestion of fresh basil and cream makes quite a difference.

This is such a solid recipe. I have made as is and I have used the "sauce" portion, added 1 c. of cream per original author's instructions and replaced the shrimp with Italian sausage.

Excellent. Perfect. Delicious! Followed Cindy's review/update and didn't change a thing except tossed the shrimp with the Cajun Seasoning & S/P before starting recipe and let it hang out until time to saute it. The entire family is very happy this evening - they all loved this. This is the perfect recipe to use your tomatoes and basil from the garden. So fresh tasting and the flavors just come together with each ingredient standing on it's own. This will be prepared and enjoyed again very soon. Thanks for sharing, Cindy!

My husband and I lived in northern Italy and thought the tomato sauce tasted just like the sauce we had there.  We used less Cajun spice because our kids would complain if it were too hot.  We all liked this a lot!

FIVE STARS!!  Hubs and I were very happy with this DELICIOUS recipe!  I made it as written, and included Cindy in Pensacola’s revisions, adding the heavy cream and fresh basil.  Excellent!!  I used angel hair pasta rather than linguine, but I think almost any pasta would work with this.  This one’s a keeper and will be repeated in this house again and again!!  Thank you Cindy!!!

This was a very yummy dinner. I added bell peppers, mushrooms, and half an onion as another reviewer suggested. I also substituted chicken for shrimp since my fiancee doesn't like store bought shrimp. I will definitely make this again.

Overall, a good recipe for all those fresh tomatoes I picked up at the farmers market. I found this to be QUITE watery, so next time I'd either cook it down a bit more and let the juices evaporate, or I'd seed some of the tomatoes. I took the suggestion and added fresh basil, which I would highly recommend! I tend to lean toward healthy cooking and cutting fat where I can, but I found the butter in the sauce really adds a richness that I surely would've missed! I loved the cajun seasoning on the shrimp, giving the dish a bit of extra flavor and just enough zing. Served over whole wheat linguini.

What an awesome pasta/sauce recipe.  Want to note: I didn't use the entire recipe, so I cannot really give a full review of it in its entirety.  However, I needed to make a side-dish last night, so I made the pasta and sauce.  It was fabulous!  The only changes I made (very insignificant, but customized to our family's taste) were: I added a bit more garlic (isn't it supposed to be one of the healthiest foods in the world??), 1 small can of artichoke hearts (to give the sauce a lemony flavor) and 1/2 tbsp of brown sugar to cut the acid.  I also added about another 3/4 cup wine (Chardonnay) and about 1-1 1/2 cups of water because, to make the flavor more intense (and because I'm a bit lazy), I decided to cook my pasta in the sauce.  When it was done, I added a bit of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce, and threw some Parmesan on top (doesn't everything need cheese on it? lol) and that was it!  My family ooooohed and aaaaaaahed about how awesome it was--and, begrudgingly, I had to finally admit it wasn't something I just ingeniously whipped up myself! lol

This was delishous!! I made a creamy tomato sauce instead of what the recipe called for. Next time I make it, I'm going to go exactly by the recipe (which I should have done to begin with) oh well, I think it would be good either way :)

This was fabulous just the way it is!  Next time I may double the sauce because I like my pasta with more sauce than this recipe makes.

DH enjoyed it more than I did.  He liked that the sauce was different than most red sauces we have.  Me on the other hand, I think it would have been WAY better if I just used a jar of Francesco Rinaldi.  Maybe I should have spent a little more money on the wine?   Either way, Im giving 4 stars for my husband.  He was soo excited to taste it after smelling it for so long! LOL

This was pretty good.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used canned, but the shrimp seemed to overpower this flavor in my opinion.  I think I will use chicken next time I make it.  My husband LOVED it, though, so I will definitely make it again and use fresh tomatoes next time.

This was very good! I used 1/2 pound of angel hair pasta instead of linguine.  I added some dried italian seasoning to the tomato sauce, and I think fresh basil would be a great addition.  Great way to use up some ripe tomatoes!

This was OUTSTANDING! I made a few alterations and additions, I always do however. I added: 1/3 red pepper, 1/3 c diced mushrooms, red pepper flakes, 1/2 t italian seasoning, 2 shallots, 1/2 t sugar. Fresh parm and 1T parsley. 3 chopped green onions in both the sauce at the end and the shrimp at the end. I left all 3 (shrimp, sauce, and pasta) seperate. Served the pasta, then sauce on top and shrimp on the side.  I used red wine (Shiraz) instead of white because I like it better and usually add red to my marinara, plus it's what I drink and I had a bottle opened.  I used some roma and hot house tomatoes- 3 cups and also 3/4 large can of crushed tomatoes.  I did add the heavy cream and used thin spaghetti.   This was so good, everyone loved it! Will make again for dinner parties and just us. :-) Thanks for posting!!

This is a Shrimp Scampi recipe and it's great, just add lemon juice to the shrimp (if no cajun seasoning) and serve on a bed of spinach.  It's elegant, quick and easy and delish!

This was excellent - although the cajun seasoning I used was a little too potent for me, but that's no fault of this recipe.  I halved this recipe and the only changes were to add about 3/4 tsp of dried oregano, and I cooked the shrimp in with the sauce.  Actually, the sauce had cooked down pretty well, so I pushed it off to the side, seared the shrimp slightly in the empty half of the pan, then mixed it all together.  The butter really finished the sauce nicely! I'll definitely make this again, but with a cajun seasoning blend that is better suited to my tastes! ;)

Another fantastic recipe by Cindy!  Made as written including the 1 cup of cream and fresh basil which Cindy recommends.  Quick, easy, plus I think it is even better the next day if you have any leftovers.  Bonus - there is still lots of wine in the bottle to enjoy while you make this dish.  Thanks for the recipe, Cindy!!

I doubled this for a family gathering of 13 adults, & a handful of children and it was fantastic.  I like to make things as early as possilbe so I can relax prior to dinner, so a few tips.    When doubling, you can start the sauce 2 hours ahead to time, no problem (then the only last minute thing is the shrimp).  I used canned, diced tomatoes which have a lot of liquid, so I also added a sm. can of tomato paste in spurts to thicken.  I did add cream the last 1/2 hour to give it that creamy sauce, that ppl always seem to enjoy.  Used "Noilly Prat" vermouth for the wine, and this made a huge difference in the taste - it was excellent!  I did cut back to (2) 12-oz packages of linguine, as others recommended - totally agree, more pasta & the sauce would be too thin.   If doubling, remember that boiling a huge pot of water takes a lot of time (for pasta) - start in advance again.  Even if the pasta sits for a little bit after boiled (30 minutes+/-), it will be fine once you mix it with the sauce - the sauce will break it apart (or you can mix a little olive oil in the pasta while it sits, to keep it seperated).   This is simple & you'll get great reviews!

I absolutely loved this recipe. I followed this almost exactly as written except I added about 1 tbsp. Italian seasoning and 1 tbsp onion powder.  It is also wonderful without the shrimp for a quick marinara sauce. I will def use this often!

This was excellent! The only changes I made were to add a jalapeno from my garden to the sauce in the last 5 minutes of cooking, and used cayenne pepper in place of the cajun seasoning using only 1/2 the called for amount since I had added the jalapeno to the sauce. Served with homemade linguine. A great way to use tomatoes from the garden!

This recipe was delicious.  I stuck to the recipe pretty much but, altered the preparation method since I was short on time. After putting the pasta water on to heat,  I sauted garlic (8 cloves-family loves it) in oil, added 15 oz can of petite diced tomatoes to the garlic, and simmered until the tomatoes became frothy. Added seasoned shrimp to tomatoes and cooked until no longer pink. I  ommitted the butter and wine. I did take Cindy's suggestion and added 1/2 pint-1pint of cream and fresh basil to taste. Meanwhile, cooked pasta (used 16oz. thin spaghetti) until el-dente and then combined everything.  Served with shredded asiago cheese, Greek salad with lemon dressing, and a very cold Chardonnay.

Really liked this a lot! Had to make a few changes based on the ingredients I had on hand. I had no tomatoes, so I substituted 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies instead, and no white wine so I used Red Vintage cooking wine.

Great recipe for using garden tomatoes.  We used roma tomatoes that were peeled and seeded.  Added some red pepper flakes to the sauce and also used the AR Cajun spice mix for the shrimp.  Did not mix the cooked shrimp into the sauce to avoid over cooking and served them over the pasta with sauce.  Definitely a keeper!

I used two pounds of shrimp (20-25 ct) instead of one, because I love my shrimp.  I also used Farfalle pasta instead of the Linguine because I had it in the house, and it was actually kind of fun because it's more like the size of the shrimp.  This was delicious and super easy for a beginner cook - will definitely be made again.

We used recipe as written except used 2 cans of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano and then sauteed the shrimp in the same skillet after we had poured the sauce over the pasta.  Was delicious and used only the pasta pot and the skillet.

I must have let my sauce cook down too much. I only used half the amount of suggested pasta and it still wasn't saucy enough. I added red pepper flakes and fresh parsley.  I didn't have cajun seasoning, so I used Creole, which I think is pretty much the same thing. Quick and simple to throw together but nothing over-the-top.

The taste is amazing. I used diced canned tomatoes and it worked fine and a cheap white wine (that I ended up getting drunk off of later in the evening). I kept thinking this could be a $30 plate of food at a fancy restaurant. Will definitely make this again to impress dinner guests.

Made this tonight...It was very good. Husband, adult son and kids loved it. Used large can of diced tomatoes, 3 tablespoons butter, more like 3 tablespoons olive oil, 5-6 cloves of garlic, 2 lbs of shrimp...28-30 large shrimp. Would have like more sauce as it was terrific....used availble wine cabernet sauvignon. Cooked it for about 20 min...then to cook the shrimp I covered the shrimp in cajun seasoning (2 teaspoons at least) and then when I sauteed the shrimp I added 4 chopped scallion onions (green and white part)...very pretty.... served with garlic bread.....Delicious!

Made this the other night for dinner and can't say we liked it much. Added a lot more garlic and little more wine and all we could taste was tomatoes.

I loved this recipe, with a couple of changes/additions.  I used 2 14 oz cans of fire roasted tomatoes, and added a small carton of heavy cream towards the end.  I also did not saute the shrimp before hand but put them into the simmering tomatoes right before I added the cream.  This gave the sauce an excellent shrimp flavor.  Will definately make again!!

Followed this recipe as is, except I seasoned shrimp with Zataran's cajun seasoning instead of red pepper or hot sauce, absolutely delicious.  Also made with spaghetti squash, very good, also. 5 stars

I used half the ingredients to make dinner for two.  I used fresh tomatoes from my garden.  Too bad I ran out of dry white wine.  So I have to cook without.  This dish is absolutely delightful even without the dry white wine.  So light without the taste of heavy sauce, the aroma from the tomato, shrimp along with the cajun seasoning is an excellent combo.  Parmesan cheese was added before eating.

Came home today with tomatoes from a roadside stand & found this recipe waiting in my inbox. Didn't have shrimp in the freezer but used leftover cooked / chopped chicken breast. Followed the recipe as is & all I can say is "MMM! This is a keeper!"

You know, my family enjoyed it maybe a little more than I did.  Definitely a good dish, and I'll most likely make it again...but was expecting just a little more.  My husband loved it.  I have to agree with others that it could use more punch in the overall flavor.  At first I thought I had accidentally made too many noodles, cause the sauce just kind of disappeared after combining the two.  But I had followed everything perfectly.  This one is a good Recipe for me...not great.

I give it 5 stars!  I added a little onion and fresh spinach (pluse spices: basil & oregano).  I didn't have any wine so I used a little tomato sauce.  But everything else was fresh ingredients.  Wonderful, flavorful dish.

Oh my gosh! This recipe is so good. I only changed two things. I added a small can of tomato paste as the sauce was not reducing; and used garlic salt instead of plain salt when seasoning the shrimp. This one goes right into the recipe binder as a top fave.

wonderful recipe, i used fresh very ripe homegrown tomatoes,  i also added some italian seasoning to the sauce.  i think the wine is important to this recipe too.  i asked a cook that is familiar with wine to recommend a dry white wine.  so good went well with texas toast.

This is the perfect summer-time pasta!  I did sub butter for olive oil and used hot pepper flakes instead of the cajun to make it a little more Italian.  This with bread and a simple salad is all you need!

This recipe is 'summer in  pasta bowl'.  I made it as written but would sub chicken broth and a dash of fresh lemon juice for white wine, when feeding diners whose diet doesn't permit alcohol.  For me, no thicken is necessary.  Thank you Cindy for a ten-star recipe!

Made this tonight and followed the recipe.  Didn't have cajun seasoning on hand, so substituted zesty montreal seasoning and added a little cumin.  Added the cream, parmesan cheese and fresh basil, as the author suggested and it was fabulous. I cut the recipe from 6 to 3, although only 2 were eating and next time, I will make more sauce.

I thought this was pretty good!  Had to sub chicken broth because my husband forget to buy the wine so I will definitely try again with the wine.  We also grilled the shrimp and then just tossed them into the pasta.

This was very tasty with Cindy's modifications.  It's got great flavor from the basil and the Cajun seasoning, but it's not too hot, even for the kiddos.  I don't cook with wine because I don't care for the taste, so I subbed chicken broth instead.  Oh, and I also added onion and green pepper.  Mr CP loved this so much!

All I can say is WOW!  This recipe is incredible!!  I used whole wheat spaghetti because I didn't have linguini and Cindy mentioned in her review that she originally wrote the recipe for angel hair anyway.  I added the fresh basil and about a cup of half and half at the end.  I'll definitely make this again and again!!  Wonderful job, Cindy!  Thanks for sharing :-)

Yum! Everyone in my family loved this dish. We used 12 oz of angel hair based on the original poster's comments (and we love angel hair). For those who say this is bland, I would say it's more light than bland. It's not a heavy, overpowering sauce. I did use triple the garlic because we love it, and I used double the tomatoes. I also added a chopped onion that I sauteed with the garlic. Used a nice chardonnay and let it simmer the full 30 minutes. The wine taste was subtle and not at all overpowering. I can see using this recipe in a variety of ways -- adding spinach, using chicken or scallops instead of shrimp, adding cream and serving over cheese ravioli. Great recipe!

I made this last night for my husband and son (the picky eater). He had 3 bowls. My husband loved it too. I added the cream and fresh basil at the end as Cindy suggested. It was fabulous. This is definitely going to be one of my go to recipes. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Instead of adding the Cajun spices, I used lemon pepper.  Made a lovely dinner with Caesar salad.

We really enjoyed this.  I made my own sauce, and also used homemade fresh linguine.  I took Cindy's advice, and added some cream (my sauce had fresh basil already).  It was delicious!  Hubs wanted a little more "kick", so next time I will add a little red pepper flakes while I'm sauteing the shrimp.  Thanks Cindy!

I made this recipe as written with the exception of simply cooking the shrimp in the sauce, which worked out just fine.  (I also added a little red pepper flakes & Parmesan to the top when it was done for some extra kick.)  The fresh tomatoes are really what makes this special -- it's an easy, affordable recipe that takes relatively little time to make, but tastes like it came from my local Italian restaurant.  Brava!

This was really good and the family loved it. The only differences I made was I used a can of tomatoes instead of fresh and added andoullie sausage with the shrimp. Fantastic!

This recipe was easy and tasted awesome. I made this meal for some friends and they both agreed that the sauce was restaraunt quality. I did what Cindy said and added 1 cup of cream. I also added mushrooms. I had cajun seasoning, but used garlic pepper seasoning instead.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand so I used three cans of diced tomatoes with the italian spices. It took almost two hours to boil it down, which I knew beforehand from making sauce from canned tomatoes. Next time I make this I'll use fresh roma tomatoes. My husband begged me to make this recipe again so I've added it permanently to my own recipe box at home.

Very good tomato sauce. I made some modifications based on what I had in the kitchen. I added some crushed herbs and parmesan cheese after it was finished. Yum!

Cindy, thank you so much. I followed your recipe exactly because it looked so delicious. It was excellent. I urge folks to try it just as you have it here, they won't be disappointed. We couldn't resist and had it to evening in a row. Kind of you to share Cindy.

we loved this recipe, I didn't season the shrimp with cajun seasoning because my daughter is breast feeding, but I did add artificial crab meat, it was a nice light summer dish, we had a spinach salad and Italian bread with it.

This was REALLY good and easy.  Instead of just diced tomatoes, I used the ones with basil, garlic and oregano.  It was yummy!

I made the recipe with hot diced tomatoes 28oz can instead of tomatoes, and I did pulse it as one review said, it was delicious but for 1lb of pasta it just wasn't enough, so i had a can of Hunt's Bold & Spicy sphagetti sauce and I added about 1 cup to the sauce with some accent, it came out good, next time I will double my sauce recipe-it was spicy but it was good!!

This was okay. I really like wine in dishes, but I might try this recipe again without it. The cajun seasoning is a nice way to spice things up though. Thanks for the recipe.

We all really enjoyed this.  I sauted a little minced onion with the garlic.  I used a whole pint of sweet grape tomatoes and let them simmer 30-40 min in the wine and some chicken broth until they burst and cooked down into a sauce with the onion and garlic.  Smelled awesome!  I too added fresh basil before serving.  Thank you Cindy!

Absolutely delicious.  I did not have cajun seasoning so I combined the following (cumin, parsley, S&P, garlic, Old Bay, crushed red pepper, paprika and oregano) and tossed the shrimp in the spices.  I also added fresh basil to the finished product and fresh parmesan.  It was a party in my mouth, everything tasted gourmet and fresh and the hubby loved it.  I also used thin spaghetti.  Definitely will make this again!!

Awesome recipe! I had a feeling that this was going to turn out like regular spaghetti with shrimp instead of beef but I was totally wrong! I added onions just because I loved them and also dried thyme. I also added a small amount of heavy cream as the author later updated which is great! It takes the bitterness from the tomatoes. I thought to add mushrooms and green peppers but I think it takes the elegance from the meal... (not trying to make shrimp spaghetti!) Served with Parmesan cheese and ciabatta rolls with a glass of wine and hubby loved it! Thanks for the recipe Cindy!

Loved this! I didn't have cajun spice, so I looked up a substitution for it online and used those ingredients (cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, thyme, pepper & paprika).  I also added fresh basil and fresh grated parm/romano cheese.  Excellent flavor! The sauce was a little watery (I used a cane of diced tomatoes with onion and pepper), but I was in a rush so I probably didn't cook it enough. I'll definitely make this again, even my kids loved it!!!

I followed this recipe exactly as directed.  The only difference was I used grape tomatoes cut in half (not diced). This meal was easy to make and fresh but a bit too acidic for me and certainly not worth five stars.

This is heavenly.  I cheated and used a 32oz can of diced tomatoes, 1 cup chicken broth instead of white wine and cooked, frozen shrimp (added to the sauce in the last 5-8 min of cooking).  I also added about 1/2 cup skim milk to the sauce.  Served with parmesan cheese.  This was a huge hit at my house!

We love this recipe!!!  I followed this recipe exactly how it was written and it is really good.  I'm giving it 4 ½ stars only because my sauce didn't thicken up.  Next time, I will follow the suggestion to add a splash of cream or cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  Also, using a good white wine is a must.  Use white wine you can drink.  The wine can make or break the recipe.  I used a good bottle of Chardonnay, which we drank while eating the pasta.  Also, add fresh basil at the end.  The basil added a depth of flavor to the dish.  Can’t wait to cook this dish again.  Next time, I will add diced mushrooms and zucchini and will use different pasta, maybe a fusilli or gemelli, or any ridged pasta so it can hold the sauce. YUM!

cindy, this was excellent. living on the coast, with access to some really fresh shrimp i try to find recipes that do not overpower them with flavor. this recipe really hit the spot. the fresh tomatoes and wine really made this dish pop. i would suggest to anyone who makes this, do not sub the wine for stock. i think the wine adds a really light and refreshing taste to this dish. thanks for sharing cindy.

OMG!!!!! This recipe is AMAZINGLY wonderful!!! Anyone and Everyone who enjoys shrimp, this is recommended! I did do mine a little different though. First of all I used vegetable oil since I didn't have any olive oil. Also, instead of using dry white wine (since I NEVER use wine) I used a mixture of chicken broth and lemon juice. I even had to make my own Cajun seasoning since I ran out of it...But I followed the directions except that I added some of the Cajun seasoning to my tomatoes while they were cooking...And as a final note, I cooked my tomatoes WAY WAY WAY longer than instructed since I don't like that flavor of undercooked tomatoes...But NO DOUBT i definitely ? this recipe!!!

This is stellar!  I usually don't go for tomato sauces with shrimp, or any seafood for that matter, but decided to give this one a try because of the reviews.  LOVED IT! I could not stop eating it!  I used a cup of sherry in place of the white wine and used a recipe on this website for the cajun seasoning since I didn't have any. I did end up using a little more of that seasoning on the shrimp than the recipe called for, but other than that followed the recipe to a T. I wish there were leftovers so I could eat it again today. Thanks for the recipe!

This is really good! I used leftover shrimp cocktail and just mixed it with the olive oil and cajun seasoning until it was warmed. I may have added a little extra wine to it also. Thanks Cindy! I will be making this again.

My husband and I really liked the flavor in this dish and it was quick and simple to prepare.  The only reason we gave it a 4 was b/c we would have liked the sauce to have been thicker.

I really liked this and my kids did too.  I substituted wine for 1/2 grape/peach juice 1/2 water with a bit of vinegar.  Was on the sweet side, but very good.  Fast & easy.

I’ve used this recipe every time I have a dinner party and it’s always a winner. The ingredients and directions are simple and your guests will give you the best compliments and leave happy! I highly recommend this to anyone and if you want to leave out the wine it is still a delicious dish to serve.

I used this recipe as my go to easy spaghetti sauce. In the summer I use it as a base for veggies over linguini. With the shrimp I add the cream. For chicken marsala I use Marsala wine with the cream served over rice.Thanks Cindy the shrimp followed exactly is the best and my favorite. No changes were made and it is perfect.

I used Penne pasta, sprinkled old bay on my shrimp before cooking, and added 1/4 pound of crab meat, delicious!

I used fresh Roma tomatoes and because of that, had to use more wine for simmering.  I didn't have Cajun so used Creole seasoning. Very yummy! We will definitely make this again, for company as well! I'm gonna try the updated version with adding basil....

Just made this. Turned out pretty good. Pretty easy and quick to make. I added some portobello mushrooms and shallots I had on hand. And plenty of dried basil (didn't have fresh) to the sauce as well.

Made this last night and it was flavorful. Had to use Penne pasta, Creole seasoning and did not have as many fresh tomatoes to use but it turned out very nice. I do agree that maybe a little fresh cream or maybe extra Cajun or Creole seasoning.  This is a keeper and others enjoyed this very much.

Made this with a few additions which truthfully probably make this recipe a lot different than the original, but this recipe is still really great! I added red pepper flakes, more garlic, and used canned tomatoes since that is what I had on hand. One reviewer described how they dressed their dish up with heavy cream and some capers... Well I had a little of both so I added that as well!
The cajun seasoning and the red pepper flakes made a delicious heat, but we like heat so season according to your tastes!
I will totally be making this again. Leftovers were gone the very next day (usually our leftovers hang out for a little while first!)

Using a 28 oz can of petite diced tomatoes makes this recipe very simple.  I double everything (so I use 2 cans of tomatoes)except the pasta.  As the author states in her review, add lots of fresh basil.  I have tried it with and without the cream she suggests.  I like it both ways, but it's so good without the cream, I don't bother with it anymore.  I am a spice wimp, so the Cajun seasoning made me nervous.  But it really makes the recipe, so if you're a spice wimp, don't leave it out.  I use about 3/4ths of what the recipe calls for.

This was amazing!!!! I used a chili infused oil in the tomato sauce to give it a little kick and a basil infused oil with the shrimp. You will not be disappointed. The oils came from Queen Creek Olive Mill in case you were wondering.

My husband bragged it was better than Olive Garden just a boost to my ego! I will definitely keep this around. It's fast easy and tastes great!!!!!!!!!

OMG...this recipe was absolutely fantastic!  I followed it right to the letter, as I normally do with a new recipe and then assess what I would alter if I were to make it again.  Well there is very little that I would change and I most certainly will be making this recipe again.  I had an abundance of garden tomatoes to use up, so I did use fresh but did not peel them which resulted in a bit of an undesirable texture.  My only change going forward would be to peel my tomatoes if using fresh. My husband says that this is the best new recipes I've made in a long time so you can bet it will be on our table again soon.  It would be perfect for company as well...simple, fast and very very tasty!
I am now reviewing for the second time after trying this recipe again with the addition of cream and basil at the end, as suggested by another reviewer.  Very tasty!...but what can I do next time to prevent the curdling? :-( 
Didn't look very nice so only put in maybe a quarter cup of the cream when I saw what was happening.

I had to adjust some of the ingredients to fit what I had on hand.  I used leeks, garlic powder and instead of shrimp, went with chicken.  I also subbed 1/2 cup of chicken broth for 1/2 cup of the wine because Grumpy is not a huge fan of wine (but I am!).  I loved the sauce!  Would make this again for certain :)

This recipe contains way too much wine for me, and simmering it for 30 minutes did not eliminate nor even get rid of much of the alcohol. I am not a drinker but I have been cooking with wine. I would either cut down the wine by half a cup and sub something else like chicken broth or look for a different recipe altogether. I've had dishes that tasted similar without the strong alcoholic taste. The flavor also lacked depth.

EXCELLENT....with a couple of minor tweeks. I followed the authors changes and added a cup of cream (I used half and half bc that's what was on hand) and the fresh basil at the end.  I also used 5 cloves of garlic instead of the 3.  The last change I made was that I added some of the cajun seasoning to the sauce as well as the shrimp to give it a little more kick.  Everyone loved and raved...FABULOUS!

My husband said this recipe is even better than our favorite local restaurant dish. It was easy. I add an additional cup of chicken stock and used 1 1/2 t. of Cajun seasoning mix I found on this same website. Will definitely make again especially when entertaining.

Lovely.   I added garden-fresh peas, broccoli, and roasted corn to (canned) diced tomatoes.   Used about 1/4 cup of wine.   I should have drained the tomatoes and will next time.

The husband and I both loved the dish, even using half fresh tomatoes and half canned.  Next time I'll lay off the cajun seasoning-- overall it was a bit salty, but with excellent potential after a little tweaking.

Very tasty dish. Had to add a little more garlic, butter, salt and pepper as I found the sauce a little fresh but other wise really nice.

I made this the other day - halved the recipe to feed a family of 2 adults and 2 small kids - using canned diced tomatoes and cooking sherry (since we don't have white wine in the house). I actually added a bit of white sugar to cut the acidity and sharpness of the tomatoes. Anyhow, I started the sauce a couple of hours before supper time and it reduced right down to a thick sauce . When tossed with the linguine, it was a barely there sauce with those beautiful chunks of tomatoe peaking through. I thought it was wonderful and actually quite authentic italian and if it were to be served with homemade pasta, this would be over the top! I just quickly sauteed the shrimp in olive oil with some fresh ground salt and pepper.

This was absolutely one of the best pasta dishes I have ever made.  I used fresh tomatoes and lemon basil from our garden.  I also added half a spanish onion, a cup of cream and about a cup of shredded fresh Parmesan cheese.  Absolutely one of my top ten of all time!

The flavor is marvelous and everyone in my family simply loved it.    the only variations that I had is that I used imitation crab as well as shrimp.  Marinated in cajun seasoning for 1/2 hour.  I wasn't planning ahead or I would have marinated the seafood longer.  I added green/red pepper and onion, and it was the best ever....

I loved this recipe.  The only changes I made were to substitute vegegable both for the wine and I added 2t corn starched that I had mixed with a spash of sherry.  I happened to have a jar of roasted red peppers so I choped those up and added them as well.  This is a wonderful, quick fix meal that is good enough to serve to company.

This was delicious!  The whole family loved it.  I added the cream and basil just like the author later said.  I also added about 2 chicken breast that were already seasoned and cooked from the night before.  And some mushrooms.  Will definitely make this again.

This recipe is amazing! It tastes like it is from an expensive Italian restaurant. I used the recipe as listed and it was so good. The only thing I could think of doing differently next time is using more diced tomatoes just because I generally like a lot of sauce.

This was the first dinner I made in my new apartment. Simple and delicous! Next time, I think I'll add about 1 cup of cream and about 3 tablespoons of fresh chopped basil at the end as you suggested. Thanks Cindy!

Excellent!  I cut this in half.  Browned a sliced habanero sausage with the olive oil, tossed-in the shrimp until pink, then removed sausage and shrimp to a bowl.  Added wine and a can of chopped tomatoes with basil and oregano to the pan.  Reduced this while pasta was cooking.  Just before pasta was finished I tossed-in the shrimp/sausage and butter.  Oh wow.  I was going to save half for tomorrown night but couldn't stop.  Thanks!

One of my top 5 dishes.  I have made the original, as well as variations including adding a dollop of sour cream at the end of cooking, adding sausage meat, and addign chili flakes.  Love it!

If I could give this 10 stars I would.!!!  My boyfriend is a VERY picky eater and when I saw this I figured "Why not?"  Well, he is still talking about how great this is and I made it 2 days ago!!  The only thing I did differently is that I added a couple tsp of tomato paste to thicken the sauce. DEFINATELY A DO OVER!!!!!

Simple to make. I used canned tomotoes and did cook longer to thicken. Stirring often is the key to getting the sauce thicker. I used frozen shrimp and let them sit out to dry and used Old Bay on them instead of cajun. Everyone loved it though. This definitely a recipe I will use time and time again. Excellent recipe.

Restaurant-quality.  Seriously delicious.  Rich flavor profile - not something that tastes like a thrown-together sauce at all.  It's not just good for being homemade - it's good, period.  I took the author's advice, and added the fresh basil and heavy cream at the end.  I also threw in some crushed red pepper flakes to turn up the spice volume a little bit - it was PERFECT.

Made this tonight.  It seemed too simple to be so good! I followed the recipe pretty much but didn't cook the shrimp separate - I added it to the heated up sauce when the noodles were almost done. I also added a lot of parm cheese.

This was great. I did use 2 cans of diced tomatoes and red wine instead of white. Great flavor and by cooking the shrimp seperately then adding it, those that don't like shrimp just eat around it and they don't have to worry about a strong shrimp taste. I loved this and I loved the shrimp!! This is a keeper...

Really good.  I added a little less tomatoes and a lot more garlic and it turned out outstanding.  This time of year when you can get fresh tomatoes really makes a difference.  Spinach could be added to make a complete meal

There are many ways to season the sauce. Italian, Mediterranean, Asian. I went the Creole route and was very pleased. The Italian seasoning blend is also a very good option. I personally like more shrimp and I’ve added scallops before.... my favorite.

I made something similar to this, but I sautéed onions and peppers and used a small can of tomato sauce. I sprinkled Parmesan cheese right before serving. It was so flavorful and delicious.

I agree with the reviewers who said it needed something more. Because cajun cooking often includes "the trinity," which is onion, celery and green pepper chopped fine and sauteed, I added that to the leftovers. My husband and I agreed that it completed the dish.

this recipe was delicious.  When I followed her ingredients it seemed like it was missing something, so I put my own spin on it.  I used red and green peppers, mushrooms 1/2 onion, 1 cup on heavy cream, and a little sugar since it tasted a little bitter. on the shrimp I added garlic powder along with the cajun seasoning.   I topped the dish with basil and parmesan cheese.  My husband cleaned his plate.  Will definitely make again

Thought it was really good.  Will have again.  Made as posted and then put a bottle of hot sauce on the table for those wanting more kick.  I used a can of diced tomatoes in tomato sauce, though, as in a time crunch.

This is great if I unexpectedly need a nice quick dinner. I keep a bag of frozen large shrimp, cooked or uncooked, in the freezer. I always have the the other things in the kitchen anyway - pasta, canned tomatoes, etc.  I usually have some fresh tomatoes around. For more flavor I add basil -  fresh if I plan ahead, but dried is fine - and a dash of cayenne pepper. Delicious.

We loved this dish. I followed recipe exactly. Our comments are that we would add more seasoning, we like a little more spicy taste. It took much more time to prepare and cook so this is not a quick dinner preparation.  But worth it!  And great left overs!

This was delicious. I used Brandywine tomatoes and white vinegar with lemon juice sense I had no white wine and it turned out perfect. My new go-to tomato sauce! I made my own cajan spice for the shrimp 
and used spaghetti. Will make again.

This is very good.  Even kids like it.  I follow the recipe , closely, but not exactly, incorporating the changes made by the author (see her 7/12/09 review).    I use large or extra large shrimp (depends on what is on sale),  two 14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes (if fresh is not available) and 12oz of linguine or angel hair pasta (16 oz is too much).  Add whipping cream and fresh basil leaves.

The sauce tasted great as directed, but I thought it was too loose/soupy, so I added tomato paste.  I had to re-season and add more wine afterwards, so I would not recommend this.

I have to say this has become my go-to dish on many occasions. Simple, minimal ingredients, but oh so tasty! I’d highly recommend getting uncooked shrimp, otherwise they could get mushy in the process. Making it tonight and when hubby saw me pulling out shrimp to thaw, his face lit up. Yup, that’s a keeper!

Very delicious! I followed the recipe except I added onion and green pepper. Not bland at all. I don’t think it needs the cream. It’s good as it is. It tastes like a gourmet dish and very easy to make. Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely yummy, easy and reasonably healthy (especially when you omit the salt, the butter and some  of the olive oil).  I used vermouth because we didn't have any dry white wine, and used probably 1.5 to 2 times amount of seasoning (Creole).  Halved grape tomatoes, because that's what I had. So good we didn't even need (or have) pasta!  Thank you, Cindy!

While this was very tasty, I thought it was a little bland. My husband liked it so I'm giving it 4 stars.
I did add some cream like the submitter said and I added some red bell pepper. Other then that everything was the same. Next time, and I will make it again, I'll add some red pepper flakes and some basil.

Really enjoyed this recipe! I did make a few additions to the sauce at the end: added red pepper flakes (a few), a bit of basil and a bit of oregano and included chopped onion at the beginning with the garlic. Whole family chowed down! It's definitely a keeper!

Really good. Prep time took me a little longer but worth it.  Simmered it a little longer just to dry it out a little more.

This was very tasty, but I wanted it a little more saucy so I added some prepared pasta sauce to it.  The shrimp turned out great.  I would definitely make it again.

This recipe was delicious. I did make a few changes, and it turned out amazing! Per the author, I used 12 oz .of angel hair. Make sure you take it out of water while it's still al dente because it will continue cooking when you mix it with the sauce. I added half of a chopped yellow onion with the garlic.  I used 2 undrained  14oz cans of diced tomatoes (the ones with basil, garlic, and a few other spices in the can, cut garlic down to 2 cloves in the recipe since the canned tomatoes had garlic in them),  2 diced fresh roma tomatoes (about 1 cup, don't forget to peel the skin), and 1/2 cup of canned crushed tomatoes. I also added a tsp of cajun seasoning to the sauce. I simmered this for a little longer, about half an hour more than recipe calls for. I used a tasty chardonnay, which was great to sip on while cooking as well! I also added a 1/2 cup low fat milk at the end, before stirring in the pasta.  I wanted a little creaminess, but didn't want the extra fat and calories of the cream. The milk worked great! I forgot the fresh basil,  so I added some dried basil. Topped with fresh parmesan a paired with a lovely salad, and it made for an amazing meal. Thanks for the recipe Cindy!

I followed the author's updated suggestions of 1 cup cream in the sauce, and added fresh basil and a tiny amount of dried basil as well at the end. I seasoned my sauce with salt, pepper, a small amount of garlic powder, smoked tomato blend, lemon pepper, and cayenne pepper for a kick. Also, only using 12 oz. of linguine is plenty, 16 oz. would absorb too much of the sauce. I  also used fresh tomatoes.
This is definitely going to be a go-to recipe for shrimp!

As with any recipe that  I try for the first time, I followed the recipe. It was above average, but next time, more garlic and I will add some onions and a bit of red pepper.  Nothing wrong,  just not quite right.

We loved this recipe so much more than we thought we would!  We used all the ripe tomatoes in our garden (about 4 cups) and added about 1/2 tablespoon of dried basil when I added the tomatoes.  When I was cooking the garlic I added 1/2 a yellow onion as well (I always like to add onion when sauteeing garlick and vice versa).  As I was pouring out the cooking wine we only had about 1/2 cup, so I topped it off with another 1/2 cup of Chardonnay.  We did not add the cream, but the sauce thickened up quite nicely all on its own and was delicious.  We added some freshly grated parmesan and some garlic bread. It was a little pasta heavy as Cindy in Pensacola had mentioned, so you don't need the whole pound of pasta.

Loved this dish with a few minor changes.. I used canned diced tomatoes, and to add some flavor I used the garlic, basil and oregano diced tomatoes and then just used 2 cloves of minced garlic instead of the suggested 3. If you use plain canned tomatoes or fresh tomatoes I would suggest seasoning it up a bit. We like things spicy in my house so I added crushed red pepper while cooking. Did not add butter to sauce as the recipe says to. Would also make less than 1 lb of pasta with the amount of sauce that the recipe made, or would just double the sauce next time I cook this.

We really liked this recipe. I omitted the white wine, since I did not have any, and used cavatappi pasta. I added some fresh chopped basil at the end, along with about 1/2 tsp. of crushed red pepper flakes. Delicious, and even better the next day! Will make again.

I loved it. The taste and flavor were delicious. Like a lot of people it needed 3 times the sauce with 16 oz of linguine. The sauce was very tasty I  just needed more of it. I will absolutely cook this over and over again until I get it right. (My shrimp was slightly under cooked and I blame the cook ):>)

Girlfriend made this last night and it was really good. Only thing that needs to be addressed is, it needs a little bit more sauce for the amount of pasta. Flavor wise it was spot on. Will definitely have this again.

I ended up making this for Valentines's day.  Great recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I've had bad experiences cooking with wine in the past.  I ended up using an unoaked Chardonnay and was not disappointed.  The flavor of the sauce was wonderful.  I'm not exactly sure what people were saying about the lack of flavor.  I'm guessing it has to do with the fact that this sauce is not very heavy; making it hard to cover the noodles.  I really think adding cream as the author suggested later would probably be a good change.

This was great! I used canned tomatoes and frozen shrimp. The dish had a great, light and fresh flavor.  I will definitely make it again, but will use 12 oz of pasta instead of 16 oz to better match pasta and sauce amounts.

Absolutely amazing! Love this recipe soooo much!
However, I wish the recipe should've told me to thicken to sauce a little bit. Anyway, great pasta sauce from scratch! Definitely recommend to pasta and shrimp lovers. Hmmmm~~~ yummy!

I had tried this recipe for dinner tonight as I wasn't sure what to make with my shrimps. 

I probably added a tad less white wine but also added a tablespoon and a half of chilli powder to give the sauce a little kick.

I made it with fresh spaghetti as this was the only pasta I had in, but it still worked well and I will be making it again soon!

We loved this! The entire family ate every bite on their plates. I did add extra spices to the sauce while cooking, oregano, basil and Italian seasoning. I used alpine touch instead of salt and 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper because I did not have cajun seasoning.  I also used spaghetti because I did not have linguini. I also added two large mushrooms and chopped spinach and followed another suggestion to add 1 cup of cream. 

When I make it again, I will keep the extra spices, add a third mushroom and double the shrimp, as we are all shrimp hounds.

I used chicken broth instead of wine,garlic powder instead of fresh. I also made my own Cajun spice from allrecipes.com. It turned out very nicely, lots of flavour.I also added fresh green onions at the end.

I loved this recipe with a few tweaks to our taste.  I used roasted garlic, a little truffle oil, and some sliced mushrooms.  Oh I can't forget I added in some lobster to make this a Shrimp and Lobster Linguine!  Out of this world!!!

A fabulous dish, but it needs more flavor, and to be thicker. Made as is, it is watery. I subbed the dry white wine with hot chicken broth. Add 2 Tbsps. flour to the hot broth and then into the sauce halfway through simmering.  Also, do not be afraid to add more cajun seasoning to the shrimp, coat it well before cooking. As other reviewers said, add a few Tbsps. of fresh chopped basil at the end.  Yum! Fresh, delicious Italian cuisine :)

This was so so good! I sautéed a half of an onion with the garlic, and I used a half cup of sweet red wine instead of dry white wine. I also used a mixture of fresh cherry tomatoes and canned organic fire roasted tomatoes. I simmered my sauce for more than hour, before I added the shrimp.  I think the butter, onion, and sweet red wine really made this dish. It really was restaurant  quality.

Will definitely be making this again!! We had lots of modifications because of what was in our pantry at the time, but followed the recipe as much as possible. Used shallots and garlic, only had a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes, went a little heavy on the wine, and used penne. Can't wait to make this again soon! ...but I'll follow the recipe closer. :-)

We really enjoyed this recipe.  As with most recipes that call for a tomato sauce we increased it by one-half and also doubled the garlic just because we love garlic.  The next day leftovers (cold) were just as good.

I didn't have Cajun seasoning so I simply seasoned the shrimp with garlic salt, pepper and cayenne pepper. I sautéed the garlic and shrimp together with olive oil and butter then removed the shrimp when no longer translucent then proceeded to add the tomatoes. I likewise didn't have white wine so I boiled the shrimp shells together with one onion and enough water to cover the shells for about 20 minutes and added a little of the broth at a time. This made the sauce so flavorful!!! Added the basil as suggested but didn't add the cream anymore because the sauce was very tasty already. Then the cooked shrimp last. Will definitely make this again.

Great shrimp pasta recipe. I came across this recipe looking for a fresh veggie-heavy sauce with white wine for some shrimp and produce I picked up on special. I had about 7 cups chopped tomatoes, zucchini and mushrooms so I doubled the wine and butter and used my full 2lbs shrimp. I still used just a pound of pasta and would not have wanted it drier: definitely halve the pasta amount. I added about a half cup of the pasta cooking liquid with the butter which helped thicken the sauce. Lastly I can't bring myself to dirty a pan just to cook the shrimp that will end up in the saucepan anyways. I added mine to the sauce after stirring in the butter with the seasoning (I used extra cayenne not cajun mix) and it cooked up fine. I had no issues with the sauce being sweet, I agree with comments you should make sure to use a good dry white wine. Thanks so much for submitting this recipe, the rich wine and butter with fresh produce was very satisfying :)

I was searching for pasta and shrimp recipes (the two things I happened to have in the house) and came across this one and tried it tonight - it was terrific!  I used half a cup of dry white wine instead of a full cup and added a half a cup of heavy cream near the end.  I also followed the advice of others and added some red pepper flakes at the beginning.
The finished dish had great flavor and a nice kick - will definitely make this again!

This was a great recipe. I added one cup of heavy cream and a big handful of basil at the end. I also used a homemade Cajun seasoning recipe from Allrecipes and tripled the amount I put into the dish - those who like it spicy will enjoy the extra kick. Topped with a bit of grated parmesan cheese and more basil. Terrific!

My two girls complimented it without being asked, which warrants a good review.

I used penne pasta, combining with the shrimp and tomatoes to simmer together; added the garlic sautéed in olive oil and butter later.  I didn't have wine or cajun seasonings to use but added salt, oregano,  paprika, and a bit of cayenne. I poured all into a dish, added a parmesan, mozerella, Italian bread crumb mixture to the top and baked 30 minutes. Good stuff!

Delicious!   & oh, so easy..  My husband, after the first mouthful, said restaurant good.  I didn't have the Cajun seasoning so just used a little cayenne pepper.   Definitely a keeper!!

Shrimp was too salty but the tomato sauce was excellent. I will cut down on the salt next time.

I also had to add the heavy cream. I also added celery into the mix, fresh rosemary, and cilantro. After some simmering time I tasted the sauce and it was VERY bland. I do not like to use salt in my food and will avoid it if necessary but I had to add it plus some celery seed, more rosemary, more garlic, pepper, and added a little cajun seasoning into it. With all of those add ins it was not half bad. I will most likely be searching for a different receipt for this meal.  I would love to say 4 stars but with all things that I had to tweak I just can not.

This was so incredibly delicious. My husband made it for me one night, with one minor tweek, he added some heavy whipping cream to make it creamier. I'm not usually one for leftovers. especially pasta, but this tasted just as good the next day. I can't wait til he makes this one again.

Great recipe.  I used fresh tomatoes from the garden, which made the sauce light and very favorable.  A keeper for sure.  Thanks for sharing, Cindy.

Great recipe!  I didn't have all of the ingredients, so I made a few changes.  I used Seafood Magic instead of Cajun seasoning, and I used two 14 oz. cans of whole tomatoes instead of 4 cups of diced tomatoes.  I mashed the whole tomatoes with a potato masher in the pan while cooking.  I also added a dash of Tabasco sauce.  Wonderful!

I have made this 3 times in the last month.  It is wonderful.  Before I gave my review I wanted to try it a few different ways.  It is well worth the time to make.  Here are my changes.  When I sauteed the garlic I added some crushed red pepper.  Your choice as to how much.  I added 1 tsp. - we like the heat. I used one can of diced tomatoes with the juice and added about 1/2 pint of grape tomates.  I also use chicken broth in place of the wne.  Half way thru cooking I mashed the tomatoes with a potato masher.  Also when cooking the sauce I add 1 TBLS tomato paste.  At the end I add 2 TBLS sour cream.   Be sure to use medium shrimp. That way you get plenty of shrimp with each serving.

For someone who can't cook, this recipe made me feel like a chef! My 11 year old daughter who is the pickiest eater of them all was my guinea pig, and shockingly LOVED this! She even had seconds!!! We both felt like we were eating an expensive meal out...The true test will be tonight when I make this dish for my husband who IS a chef!

This is really tasty!  I actually followed the recipe exactly.  I've never put butter in tomato sauce before, but I guess that's how restaurants get it to taste so rich?  The only modification I will make nest time is to up the amount of Cajun seasoning to make it a bit spicier.  Very easy and delicious!

VERY good! I used one can rotel and one can diced tomatoes...along with adding some onions in...we also mixed some scallops with the shrimp. My dad thought it was too spicy (he HATES spice tho) but my mom and I loved it! I like that it is a broth like sauce...we served it with some buttered rolls...will definitely make again!

Delicious! I made this per the instructions plus the additional instructions made in the comments by the original author (adding cream and basil). The only thing I would do differently is use a lighter cream (I don't know what possessed me to use heavy whipping cream, but I did), and maybe less of it. I think I also simmered it a bit longer to get it to reduce a little more...maybe 45 minutes.

This was very good. I made and used a Cajun Seasoning from a recipe on AR. The only changes were to add some dry basil (had no fresh) and heavy cream as suggested on a post by the creator of the recipe. Good stuff!! I'm sure this will be asked for often. Thanks for the recipe!

I'd give it 4 and a half. It was easy to make but a lot of adjustments to the amounts. I added the basil with the garlic and one large tomato was 2 cups. I didn't saute the shrimp separately (why dirty another pan?) just added it to the sauce. I used cornstarch to thicken it. The sweetness does depend on the wine, I needed extra seasoning to balance it. Also included fresh mushrooms and green pepper.

We just got done eating this for dinner and I have to say it came out great. I have never made Shrimp Scampie before and I liked. I made Penne pasta and put the sauce over it and topped it with lots of cheese and put under the brioler for a few min and it was great. Thanks

I'm going to be keeping this one in the regular rotation. Couldn't be easier to make, with ingredients I always have on hand, and the whole family loved it. The only thing I added was a little diced onion at the beginning, and some fresh basil at the end. Thanks for posting this, we love it!

This was super delicious! I added two can of diced tomatoes, one Italian style and the other Basil and Garlic. I added onions and a jalapeno pepper to make it extra spicy. I omitted the cajun seasoning. I topped it out with parmesan cheese. So good!
