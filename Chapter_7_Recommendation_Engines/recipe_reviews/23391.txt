The only thing I did differently was use the slow cooker. I did not add any water, it was superb....Note...You do not have to add liquids to a slow cooker.  I make baked potatoes that I cook all day in the cooker and never add a drop of liquid.  They are the best baked potatoes ever..Back to this recipe...I love all that garlice.  This was all I hoped it would be.

This was full of flavor and VERY EASY to make.  However, we found it to be too salty.  In the future I think I would add beef broth (I would pick low sodium) like another reviewer did, in order to cut down the concentration of the dry soup mix.  Or, you can cut back on the amount of dry soup mix you put in.  Either way, I certainly will be making this again!  I just need to tweak it a little to my taste.

This was certainly a tasty recipe, however, I think next time I would use a less tender cut of meat such as rump or chuck.  Indeed the sirloin roast fell apart, but I am not fond of the stringy texture it had.  I like to slice my pot roast, not peel it!  This would be better for a cheaper cut of meat.  I also browned my roast first and  added small potatoes, onion, and some whole fresh mushrooms to the baking bag.

I didn't trim the fat because there was not that much plus the fat adds flavor, used 2 cans of soup because knew from experience it would be too salty.  If using one can of soup only use 1/2 of the dry soup mix.  Loved the strong garlic flavor!

Really good garlic flavor.  We loved that part.  I'll probably use my usual herb rub next time with garlic stuffed in it.  The gravy was too salty.  I should have listened to others and used less onion soup mix.  We ate it though.

I put the roast in the crock pot all day instead of the oven. The family liked it, but felt there was too much garlic. Next time I will only use half of the called for garlic.

We love this roast! I've cooked it in the crock and in the oven. It always comes out delicious. I throw carrots and potatoes into the pot. The gravy is perfect and the meat falls apart!!

Wow this recipe is wonderful and filling, my husband was in awe.
I used a 1 1/2 lb chuck roast and only 4 garlic cloves sliced in half and slow cooked for 8 hours.

Wow, it is very rare that I come across a recipe that my husband, myself and all three kids love but this is one!  I cooked it on low in the crockpot all day while at work.  It makes a delicious gravy!

This was just your average roast.  My boyfriend and I enjoyed it, but it just wasn't anything special.  I added a can of water and made it in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours.  It was definitely easy to make, though, and that may bring me to bring it again.

The flavor from the soup and onion mix leaves much to be desired... we did not care for this recipe at all.  However, this was the most delicious cut of meat that we've had in a crockpot.  Tender and juicy!

So easy to prepare and wonderfully delicious!  The meat literally falls apart when it is done cooking and the bag is full of gravy - it's amazing!

I've made this for years w/ only a little dry onion soup mix.  Try leaving out the dry onion soup mix or cut back if it's to salty.

WAY WAY TOO MUCH SALT.  I am glad I tasted it before I served it.  Now trying to think of a way to salvage a chuck roast.

I love roast and in nine years of marriage I have never had any luck with them. They always turned out dry and tough no matter wich recipe I followed, but this recipe changed that! This recipe was so easy and delicious and the roast was so tender it fell apart! The only change I made was using chuck roast instead.Even my picky 4 year old loved it!

I followed some advice and also made this in the slow cooker - low for about 9 hours.  I did use a larger cut of meat, so I added a can of beef broth as well.  Very yummy!  Thank you!

This was so flavorful!! I used my slow cooker instead and cooked potatoes, carrots, onion and celery with it. It was sooo good and the smell as it was cooking was mmm,mmm good too! :)
