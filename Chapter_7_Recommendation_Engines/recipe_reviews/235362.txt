Very easy pulled pork recipe!   Instead of the slow cooker I cooked my 6 lb. roast in a covered dutch oven for 4 hours at 300 degrees until it was easy to shred. I also put a rub on the pork of paprika, garlic powder, cayenne, salt, & onion powder before braising.   The pork was fall apart tender.  I personally prefer to make my own bbq sauce, but, the addition of the vinegar to the bottled sauce gave the sauce a nice tang and was a big hit with my husband.   Thanks for the recipe!

"Pulled" it after 7 hours, removed 1/2 the liquid as directed, added brown sugar and BBQ sauce, then gave it another hour. Excellent flavor for such an easy recipe.

This is first time I cooked pork this way.   It was absolutely delicious, so much so that when the family sampled it before I  added the sauce they decided to have it without.   We had roast potatoes & veg along with it.  I did add the BBQ sauce to the leftovers the next day &  had it along with homemade rolls & it went down a treat .  Won't be looking for any other recipes for pulled pork.  This is a keeper.  Thanks so much for this delicious recipe.

We love this! It is so simple.  I serve with Hawaiian rolls so I don't use much brown sugar.

Very easy to prepare  and walk away for a few hours while the crock pot does it's magic. It turned out wonderful. I served the pulled pork as sliders on King's Hawaiian Rolls, but it would be equally great on sourdough bread or ciobatta rolls. Your kids will love this!!

i added some dr. pepper soda to it, so all together i cooked on high for 4 hrs, took it out and with 2 forks pulled it apart, which was easy. let it cook for about an hour to blend all juices through meat. turned out great.

Made it as per the recipe; as described- small number of ingredients, easy prep and great results. My family loved that it was both sweet and a little tangy from the vinegar. Will certainly prepare again

My husband loves pulled pork sandwiches, so I made this recipe to the exact specifications. He loved it! He will be taking pork sandwiches to work this week, as our family of five barely made a dent.

I always make pulled pork in the slow cooker for summer holiday events. Everyone liked this recipe. The onion and the brown sugar were good additions to the traditional. I used a bone in pork butt from Sams. The fat gives it a good flavor but you have to remove the fat when you shred it. The only thing I’m not sure about is the cider vinegar. You definitely taste it.  I usually use root beer. This recipe is a good one. I’m sure I will use it again.

I've tried three other pulled pork recipes, all with varied and intriguing ingredients. This simple recipe got the "BEST pulled pork I've ever had!" from my husband.  I pitched the previous three recipes.

Also, I believe it is CRUCIAL to use BONE IN pork ONLY.

this was so good, and so easy.  I placed it in my crockpot to go on 'low' overnight.  was taking it to a function the next day, so this made it very convenient.  Although I did add other seasonings, the vinegar/H20/brown sugar ratio I kept the same.  I love the tang and the sweet contrast.  it was so tender.  Everyone at the function loved this barbecue.  Couldn't ask for an easier method.  thanks for the recipe.

I really liked this recipe. My husband and kids loved it! I used an already smoked smoked pork butt  that my husband had made. I shredded the meat, put in the crock pot with the other ingredients. I don't like my BBQ to be swimming in sauce, and I like the tartness of the vinegar. I omitted the water and decreased the brown sugar to 1 tablespoon. It was still bit sweet so will decrease the sugar again just a little. I made little pork sliders with Hawaiian rolls. None were left!  I sat out the bottle of BBQ sauce in case anyone wanted any, but nobody did. I'm making it for the second time today!

I didn't make any changes. The pulled pork was delicious and very easy to make.
