This was pretty similar to the mincemeat cookie recipe on my package of mincemeat. I omitted the walnuts and put in Rice Krispies instead and subbed half the flour for whole wheat flour. The cookies came out with a delicious strong spicy flavor. I frosted half of them and kept the others bare and I think they were equally good.

Super-fast and easy these were delicious. They took a little longer than the 8 to 10 minutes called for. I actually cooked them for about 13 minutes I didn't add the nuts (my wife isn't partial to them) but that is the only change I made. Will definitely make these again.

If you eat these cookies just cooled from the oven they are marvelous. I am not able to devour a bach or half batch that quickly. These do not hold up well and do not freeze well. The taste of the freshly baked cookie is a surprise treat but enjoy while you may!

These cookies surprised me. They were pretty good. A little sweet but a nice flavor. I do not care for mincemeat pie and made a quick fruitcake recently with mincemeat pie filling and did not like it that way either. I wanted to use what was leftover of it. It appears though it works well in cookies. When mixed into the batter the apples and raisins separate and can actually be tasted individually and the spice is really mild. They go great with the walnuts too. The base of this cookie reminds me somewhat of a chocolate chip cookie so it pares well. Only change I made was using butter instead of shortening. I also made 1/2 recipe and with a cookie scoop it yielded 42 cookies. I baked them on a parchment lined sheet and they took 12 minutes. Mine were a little flat after cooling so an extra minute may have been even better. ty

I replaced 1/2 the flour with oat flour and butter instead of shortening. The result was a cakey cookie - very delicious.
