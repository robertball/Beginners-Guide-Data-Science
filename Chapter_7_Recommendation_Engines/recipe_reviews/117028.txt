This is a good solid recipe. I made it even better by adding 1/2 tsp cumin to the sauce, chopped cilantro, diced celery and chopped olive and 1 tsp lemon juice. I added these things and took it to a party--it was gobbled down and four people asked me for the recipe.

This is such a great salad for summer. The first time I made it exactly like the recipe. It was the perfect side dish for our Taco Night when we wanted something a little different. Then the next time, I changed some things. I left out the avocado and added 2 extra tomatoes and an extra can of mexicorn. Instead of the hot sauce I added chili powder and cumin. Then topped it off with a bit of cilantro. It was awesome to start with and awesome with changes so I definitely recommend. This is one of my family's new favorite salads. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was yummy! I only added one can of black beans, I think two cans would be way too many beans. If you love black beans then add two cans. My son and husband didn't like this very much. I ended up having to eat the entire bowl myself over a weeks time. I will make this again even if it's just for me. Very tasty! Thanks for sharing.

I thought this was delicious! What an easy, tasty summer salad. I added some cilantro and cumin too based on other reviews.  Very flexible - you can throw in another can of beans, or corn, or chopped up veggies. I had some whole corn on the cob to use up so I cooked it and added it in.  Definitely a keeper!

I make this salad ALL the time. I use less oil and more hot sauce. I cannot find Mexicorn so I just use regular kernel corn.

I changed the recipe a lot: I skipped the hot pepper sauce and substituted more tomatoes and avocado for the corn.  I made it ahead of time to give to someone and forgot that avocados go brown after a few hours, just FYI if you want to make it ahead of time and chill it, you should probably add the avocados at the end.    I'm still looking for a good summer bean salad and will probably keep looking, but this one wasn't bad.

I had low expectations because it's mostly just black beans and corn but I really liked this.  I thought 1/2c oil sounded like a bit much so I used 1/4c.  I was concerned this would cause it to be dry but found that it still made plenty of dressing.  I used a previous review suggestion and added chopped black olives, 1t lime juice and 1/2t cumin.  Yum!

I made this just to try and shared it with my co-workers.  Everyone LOVED it!!  It's especially good after sitting overnight so definitely make it the day before.   I've been asked to bring it to a birthday celebration we are having next week.

I was searching through my daughter's place (she's 20) and found a can of black beans. Having limited resources-this one hit it on the head! I substituted fresh corn (boiled briefly), shallots for onions, and balsamic for red wine vinger but it still turned out great. Very easy to make. Also, I had no avocados-but it was still good (better with I think!)

I thought this was delicious but made a few changes.  I felt like a really fresh salad so I substituted the vinegar with the juice of a whole lemon (I probably would have used lime had I had any) and decreased the oil by a HUGE amount.  I just drizzled a bit over the salad.  I would say no more than 1/4 of a cup.  Also, instead of canned corn, I boiled a couple cobs of corn for 4 minutes and cut the kernels off (it is August - perfect corn season!).  We ate it as salad but the salad remaining was snacked on all afternoon with tortilla chips which was a great way to eat this salad.... almost better as a dip!!

A great recipe!   I don't like avocado so I did not include any.    That's just me.   For everyone I say - make this recipe in advance and let it chill in the frig for several hours.   This recipe tastes better when chilled.

This salad was a big hit at our mother's day bbq!  I added 1 large roasted red bell pepper, 1 large roasted poblano, peeled and diced both of them into the salad, and sprinkled some chopped cilantro.  In retrospect, because of the added ingredients I should have increased the ingredients for the dressing because it could have used a tiny bit more acidity, but overall it was a splash of fresh, tasty goodness and like my daughter said, "I like how the colors just pop!"

This is one of my favorite apps. I definitely recommend cutting the oil in half, but other than that, it's fantastic as is!

Yum! Used half a can of Rotel in place of tomato (liquid drained) and olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Used regular canned corn.

Quite good.  I made this almost exactly as written, but I only put in about half the dressing.  Definitely let it chill for a while before serving.  Next time I will add some shredded cheese.  Yum!  Thanks!

A really good recipe.  I made as directed this time around, with just a little less oil.  Next time I would double the tomato and avocado and leave everything else the same.  And there will be a next time :-). We served this as a side to the easy mashed potato and roasted vegetable enchiladas (also from this site).  It will make nice leftovers for lunch tomorrow, too.
