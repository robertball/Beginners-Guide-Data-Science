Just finished making this recipe.   I followed recipe to the T.   Chicken was moist but needs a bit more flavor.  Next time, I will add 3 teaspoons of salt instead of 2 and less flour.  For 10 pieces of chicken, this was way too much flour. I will try 2 cups flour.

I used this as a baseline.  My alteration had no sage or paprika (I have non).  I used an egg with the buttermilk and did not get to soak overnight.  I did find the sugar a nice touch.  I used garlic powder, baking powder, sea salt (a lot in the buttermilk and the dry ingredients).  I added curry powder and chicken soup base for flavor, great idea!  I also used Louisiana seasoning, Cavenger's seasoning, oat flour, and fresh ground pepper.  It was very juicy and moist.  you can taste the sweetness of the brown sugar, makes you nibble at the crusty skin!

This definately has lots of flavor.  My family loved it.  I wish I knew what the secret to keeping the crusty skin from falling off.  Some of the pieces lost their coating.  Love it and will make it again.

My family enjoyed this!  I have always been nervous about making fried chicken, mostly because of the mess with splattered grease.  I did not have that problem because the chicken was not fried for very long.  Next time I will cut the amount of garlic powder in half.

Really liked the flavor from the buttermilk soak and the seasonings in the breading.  No offense to Mamaw, but there was no way I was going to waste 2Q of Buttermilk.  I used about 2-2.5 cups, not reducing the hot pepper sauce or garlic, and it was fine.  Also cut the flour to 2C (not changing the seasoning amounts) and still had flour left over (which we used in biscuits and gravy).  These pieces wanted to brown very quickly and only took about 3-3.5 minutes per side, then all went in the oven for 45 minutes (my chicken pieces were on the small side).  Had no problems with breading falling off or chicken not cooked through.  Tasted good cold too and reheated nicely in the oven.

very good! in the buttermilk i put a couple chipotle peppers in adobo. i used 2C of flour (and still had a lot left) but the whole amounts of the seasonings to make it more flavorful. i also added a TB of thyme and onion powder. i dredged them then put back in buttermilk and redredged to get a thick crust.  i used boneless breasts and i think next time I will halve them along the thickness to make them thinner and just cook completely in the oil and place in a warm oven only until serving.

This was really good.  There was flavor with each bite.  My husband said it was amazing and this was a keeper.  I did change somethings.  I used large chicken breast that I cut up.  I marinated in 2 cups of buttermilk.  When I had decided to make this it was the night before so I did not marinate it till 6:30am before work.  My husband didnt tell me we ran out of hot sauce so I just did buttermilk and garlic powdered (i didnt have fresh garlic).  After work I bought hot sauce and added it in for about 30 min then i cooked everything.  The otherthing is i didnt have sage so i subsitituted it for Thyme instead.  Otherwise it was great.

i don't think I'll bake these next time.  I was careful to drain on paper towels and suck out as much of the grease from frying before putting in the oven but they still ended up sitting in a little grease once fully cooked and the bottom was a little mushy.

I thought the flavor was great however the second process of keeping it in the oven for an hour kind of made it soggy . Next time I try this recipe ill fry it a minute or two longer and serve it right away.
