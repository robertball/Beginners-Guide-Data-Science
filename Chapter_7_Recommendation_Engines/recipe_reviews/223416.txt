Yummy!  Yum!  I changed a few things just because I didn't have some things on hand! Added Half & Half to make it more of a chowder type of meal.  My kids and everyone else LOVED it!

This soup is so delicious! The bacon adds a really nice flavor to the seafood. We had a frozen halibut filet, so we just put the whole filet into the chowder 1 hour (as it says in the recipe) and then just used a fork to separate it. VERY GOOD!

I swapped out the halibut with a standard COD steak filet because I didn't want to pay $19.99 per pound. It was very watery so I needed to add a roux made of butter, flour, and the broth. Overall it was good but  I feel it was more related to a soup than a chowder.

Fantastic flavour and is now a family favourite. I added a tablespoon of Old Bay Seasoning the second time I made the dish and it really kicked the flavour up a notch with a little extra heat as well. Great addition if you like foods on the spicy side.

Used sweet potato as well as coconut milk rather than cream to make it super healthy and delicious.

Sooooo good! I did maybe a fourth of the potatoes as I'm trying to cut out starches, no corn, but lots of seafood. Added some Old Bay Seasoning like another person suggested--wow. Awesome flavor. And it's got bacon! :)

A good and easy chowder. I used at least double the celery. I also substituted a pound of canned ham for the bacon. I didn't have any bacon. I used only a pinch of black pepper and red pepper. I wanted something smooth and mild. This was a good choice for dinner after a long day. I put the vegetables in the crock pot the night before. The kids added the broth and corn when they got home from school. I added the milk, ham and seafood when I got home. It took all of two seconds, so I had an hour to rest after work instead of cooking.  I look forward to making this again.

Made this tonight and it was a hit, even with our 5 year old. Used bay scallops, cod and doubled the shrimp since I had extra on hand. Did end up thickening a bit with corn starch. Perfect dinner for a cold winter night.

Pros: easy to make; makes enough for a small army
Cons: expensive ingredients; very overpowering taste of seafood; thin broth; bland seasoning

I made the recipe as written.The taste of the chowder doesn't justify the expense of the ingredients. Even with seasoning, all my family could taste was the overwhelming pungency of fish. The excessive amount of stock called for makes this a thin soup. I like my chowders thick. This wasn't worth it.

This was delicious! And, since the fish don't go in until the end, the house doesn't end up smelling like fish all day. =)

Made this for a girl friend from out of town and my husband and they just kept raving about it. I made a rue with butter/flour before adding the white wine/chicken broth etc. I did add some sliced Andouille Sausage from Costco and some small steamer clams (after cleaned with corn meal) Instead of canned milk used a little cream instead.  Served it with multi-grain Artisan bread  and white wine out on the our deck. Was like being at a 5 star restaurant  for everyone. Thanks, I will do again this summer for others.

Yes its ok..I thought it would be really something...I found it very liquidy(and even added some minute rice at the very end). It needs some good spices added, besides just the garlic and pepper.

Super easy! Used 8 oz fish, 10 oz bag of shrimp, and 12 oz bag of scallops. Reheated for lunch at work and  co-workers said it smelled delicious... and I was expecting them to say other words due to the seafood.

Very good seafood chowder. My kids enjoyed it so it is now a great way to serve my kids seafood. Like other reviewers, I added some Old Bay Seasoning and some cornstarch to thicken the broth. If I had the time, I would have mashed or pureed some of the potatoes to thicken the broth. I plan to add an extra potato next time I make this. Thank you for the recipe.

I'm giving the original 3 stars. We felt it was missing a layer of flavor, and the original ingredients are too expensive to make this practical for our family. Taking some of the suggestions into account by adding Old Bay, and by changing the type of fish to cod we enjoyed the recipe. With changes - we give this 4 of 5 stars. This recipe can be changed to match your taste and budget preferences.

It is cooking right now, and I'm working to keep my team from sampling before it is done. Two pounds of fresh haddock in lieu of scallops, etc, as some people (my MIL)are particular about their chowdas. Smells delicious.  I did forget the evaporated milk. Suggestions?? Please.  TYVM  Woody

This was pretty tasty. I substituted lactose-free milk for the evaporated milk, which made it come out more like a soup than a chowder.

We loved it but I did tweak it a little to our liking and based on other’s suggestions. Added half a left over smoked sausage used in another dish to the bacon. Added 1/2 tsp Old Bay seasoning and subbed half and half for the evaporated milk.  Agreed with one reviewer still more like a soup but we felt it was plenty rich with the half and half, bacon and smoked sausage. Great way to use up seafood that has been in the freezer a while!  It was not too expensive for us as my husband had either caught the fish himself or we bought it cheap while in Florida and brought it back home in the cooler. It does make a lot and could feed a crowd. Ate it with a crusty French bread perfect for dipping into soup.

This is pretty close to perfect as is. We sometimes use a frozen seafood medley for  convenience. Everyone loves this. DON'T cut out the bacon even if you're not a bacon lover... it's adds a smokey-smoothness that really makes the flavor tremendous.

One word of advice.. unless our cooker isn't as warm as it should be or the seal isn't great (probable)... the potatoes aren't ready after 4 hours... we use 5 as a guideline.

I  only used tilapia for the seafood as that was all I had on hand. I also used half and half instead of evaporated milk. Otherwise I followed the recipe very close. I did add some Old Bay seasoning as well. The flavor was great although as some of the reviews said it was a little on the runny side and not as thick as I wanted it. I added a little cornstarch mixture as well to thicken it up. My suggestion would just be to make a rue with the onions and garlic before the stock was added and that would help to thicken it. Overall the taste was great and we ate it with some french bread. Just what I was looking for!

Excellent basic recipe.  I made it with all the listed ingredients except for the evaporated milk.  As others have done I substituted half and half for it.  I also deglazed the sauté pan with a little of the chicken stock and added that to the pot along with about 2 teaspoons of thyme.  Everyone had seconds.

It was good.  Not too heavy but very filling.  I used a seafood chowder mix instead of just the fix they listed.  Great for using up left over seafood.

This was really good!  If you like more of a soup, then follow the recipe as is.  I was generous with the red pepper flakes and the black pepper and it was only a little spicy, but certainly had more flavor.  If you like spice then add twice or three times the red pepper.  Perhaps a diced jalapeno or two.  I like the idea of old bay and may use that next time.
If you want more of a thick stew or chowder then either add pureed potatoes back into the stock after cooking or perhaps less stock to begin with.

Excellent seafood chowder. I kicked it up a notch with Old Bay and skipped the carrots. I also used half and half instead of condensed milk. It goes great with oyster crackers and bread.

Great weeknight dinner!  I used only shrimp as my fish and it was still very tasty.

REALLY good- My husband hates soups and stews, but he asked me to make this one again. We chopped everything finer and used shrimp and scallops. Try it-you'll love it!

This is a delicious recipe. Perfect for the fall. 

Made a few of the changes other reviewers suggested, but they were small. In an attempt to balance between healthy and creamy, we added some half & half/heavy cream, but kept it mostly evaporated milk. It's definitely more liquid than chowder, but worth it for the reduced calories, in my opinion.

We also went heavy on the Old Bay. It definitely helps the flavor along... and there's a lot of it. It's the kind of soup you use up your french bread on and STILL tip the rest of the broth into your mouth at the end of it. Highly recommend.

I used the recipe and made it on the stove rather than in a slow cooker.  I liked it a lot as did my husband.  I used some frozen yellowtail I had instead halibut.  I also had to thicken it a lot by adding heavy cream and cornstarch.  It was still not ultra thick like most chowders.  I would make it again.

So very Yummy! I used Cod instead, and it turned out great!  I'm going to add crab meat next time.  I'll be making this soon.

This has become one of our family's favorite dishes! I think I make it every 2-3 weeks :)
