This is a great tasting punch and everyone always enjoys it.  However, I gave this recipe 3 stars because of the rainbow sherbet.  I would not use rainbow because of the color it will make the punch.  It will become a pukey green-brown color.  We have always used lime or raspberry/strawberry sherbet.  Just an FYI...

I've used a recipe similar to this but with the addition of 1 can of frozen lemonade (plain not pink) and using sprite.  The coloured sherbet--red and green--was fabulous for my son's birthday party just before Christmas...we called it Santa juice and they loved it.

It tasted fine but it turned brown right away.  5 for taste, 0 for presentation.  Someone let me know if there is a way to fix this.  I didn't do a lot of stirring and it was brown anyway.

I used cranberry jello and cut the sugar by 1 cup.  It received wonderful reviews and was a great color for a Valentine's Day party. It needed a good 4 hours to thaw and get nice and slushy!  Delicious!!!

you will definitely want to make sure you have at least two flavors of sherbet. I started out with just lime as some other reviews stated and it was too much. Once I added an additional flavor of sherbet it was delicious!

I have had this before as a child and looked for it constantly on this site.  It is absolutely awesome.  All kids are sure to love it.  Especially at adult gatherings.  It makes them feel like they can have a "special" drink too.

Excellent recipe and so easy too! I opted for making it with Sprite and a single flavor sherbet for my sons birthday party. First I used raspberry sherbet, though it was extremely good it was super sweet. Next I tried Lime sherbet, it was out of this world. Both the kids and the adults loved both versions, just personally I favored the Lime sherbet for this. The reviews for this first talked of the color of the punch using rainbow sherbet and also trying lemon lime soda instead of ginger ale. I may give the original recipe a go for a very small get together to try it out. But the altered variations of this were wonderful!

Very sweet for any diabetics so you might use diet if you like it less sweet!

I have been using this recipe for years, however, I have actually never made this with the rainbow sherbert, my family has always used lime sherbert and it is fantastic but I am sure that the rainbow sherbert would be just as good. It is always a huge hit at our parties. We usually have to make about 3 or 4 batches of it cause it goes so quick.

I made this for my sister in law's baby shower.  I used Raspberry Ginger Ale and Edy's Rainbow Sherbet (berries and orange).  Everyone loved it.  Thankfully I had bought extra because it was gone really quickly and I had to make an extra batch.

This is a GREAT punch, I have used it and eaten it since I was like 5. Although, I myself don't care for ginger ale. Trust me when I say this; lemon-lime pop is a much better choice. To this day, in the summer I drink nothing else but sierra mist and rasberry sherbet YUM!

This stuff is soOo easy to make, but I always use Orange Sherbet. Also if you have adults only, we sometimes put vodka in ours.

This was great, easy and fast.  I haven't had this in decades.  I even used the given recipe from a change in servings (1 serving) using diet 7up and fat-free orange sherbet...delicious!

I made this for a party with kids. My 6 yo DS didn't like it, it was too sweet. However, the punch disappeared so somebody was drinking it.

I tried this punch for my daughter's first birthday party.  It was tasty, but I think it may be better with sprite or 7-up instead of the ginger ale.  Also, it turns almost a peachy-brown color when mixed, due to the lime sherbert that is part of the rainbow sherbert.  I expected it to be better :-(

Used this punch today for a party at my home.  Didn't have much time, so this was the easiest punch recipe I found. I used Dreyer's Berry Rainbow sherbert and it was great!  Everyone loved it and I had almost none left at the end of the party.

All the comments we're PERFECT!!  I was looking for a simple kids drink for a JUNGLE THEMED PARTY and we wanted to call it JUNGLE JUICE...with all the comments that said it tasted great and that the color ended up a "pukey green brown color" that confirmed it was JUST THE TICKET FOR JUNGLE JUICE!!  Thanks!

I was extremely skeptical of the reviews - the punch sounded too sweet.  But I had a 2L bottle of Sierra Mist and a tub of raspberry/lemon/orange sherbert.  Threw it together last minute and all of the kids (age 11) at the party LOVED it!  Will definitely make again, but will get enough for more batches!
