Oh my, this definitely is "Chocolate Bliss"! These cookies are chocolatey, chewy on this inside and crispy on the outside - just perfect! I followed the recipe exactly and used an 11.5 oz bag of Nestle's chocolate chunk morsels (sorry Baker's) and that was plenty of chocolate. Not that you can ever have too much chocolate....  I baked these at 375 for 12 minutes and while they don't spread much, they did flatten out just a bit. So, when you drop these onto your cookie sheet (I always line mine with parchment paper) be sure to flatten out the dough a little and you should get perfectly shaped cookies. Be sure to have a tall glass of ice cold milk handy as you're gonna want to eat a bunch of these warm from the oven!

I have tried several of the chocolate chip cookie recipes on this site and in my opinion this one is the best. The cookies turned out chewy and delicious and didn't go flat. I also made a batch using butterscotch chips instead of chocolate and they were excellent.

This is an edited review- I first gave these cookies 4 stars, however now that I think about it, they deserve a 5 (I'm just indecisive I guess lol). They do not spread, however they are also chewy- you usually don't get both of these qualities in one cookie. Mine only needed 8 minutes at 370 degrees, and the next time I make these I probably will use just a little less baking soda, but otherwise these are wonderful.

****I have made these cookies many many times since this review, and the BEST way to make them is with high quality white chocolate chunks, then rolls the cookies in vanilla bean sugar before baking. It will be the best cookie you ever eat.****

Absolute chocolate chip perfection. I baked these at 350* for 8 minutes and my cookies came out soft and perfect and just........incredible. For me, this will be my new chocolate chip cookie recipe. NOTE: I did use one bag chunk chips and one bag semi-sweet chips because that was all I had. It's pretty much the same thing as the chunks are semi-sweet anyway. It's just a different shape.

YUM, I made these at 9.30 at night for the footy tomorrow, word of advice let them cool down the choc does burn the tounge, they turned out lovely.  I had no baking soda so trippled the baking powder, and no choc chips so smashed a block of cooking choc I had in the cupboard.  Recommend and thankyou.

These were good but extremely buttery and, I'm not sure if it was my mistake, but they came out totally flat. I added about a fourth of the amount of chocolate suggested since it seemed a bit grotesque to add that much, and added a bit of flour as well.
The second time around I froze the dough on the baking sheets before putting them in the oven and they turned out much better

I wasn't that impressed with this recipe, the cookies okay but were very crispy even when cooked a short time & not as plump as the photo. Also, this is the ONLY cookie recipe that I have every made where the dough didn't taste that great. I thought that was particularly weird!

Oh...my...goodness. These really are the best! I saw the picture and just had to try the recipe. It's awesome! I made 3 subtle changes: 1. only used 1/2 a teaspoon baking powder; 2. used 12 oz. semisweet chocolate chips; 3. added 4 oz. toffee chips. Sooo yummi!!!

These were great! I had gotten in a rut with my 'old' cookie recipe and this one was perfect! I used semi sweet chips but only because that is what I had on hand. I would definitely recommend these!

They tasted good but mine didn't turn out very chewy or anything like the photo.  Mine spread and were a lot flatter and somewhat crispy.  Mine were brown at 9 minutes, so definitely watch the time.

I thought these were fantastic!!! I only used about half of the chocolate chips recommended due to $, but they would be even more divine with double the chocolate.  Thank you for the great recipe!

I thought this recipe was good. I used margerine instead of butter and they came out kind of flat. If I made these again I would definately use butter! Other than that they had great taste and were a definate make again!!!!

Loved these cookies! They turned out perfect - slightly crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle.  I used 1/2 tsp baking soda, and baked at 350 degrees for aobut 10 minutes.  Outstanding!

I was tired of using the recipe I had for Chocolate Chip Cookies - they were good, but I have had better.  I tried this recipe...this is my new "keeper".  Excellent!!  Beautiful and delicious.

I thought these were only okay.  I followed the recipe exactly except used mini m&m's instead of chocolate chips.  My dough was kind of runny and the cookies spread a lot when baked.  The flavor is good, they just aren't that "chewy" chocolate chip cookie that I was looking for.  Oh, mine were also done around 9 minutes at the 375 degree suggested.  I lowered the temp to 360 and baked for 12 minutes and the second batch was less crispy.

I was hoping these weren't "cakey" cookies and they were - they were soft but I prefer chewy type cookies. The dough was also bland, the chocolate was the only thing that gave them any flavor.

These are very good.  I used white chocolate in place of semi-sweet and they were a huge hit.

Very dissapointed with this Baker's recipe.  Even with following the directions exactly, I ended up with greasy cookies that had the wrong consistancy and didn't really resemble normal chocolate chip cookies.  I won't use this recipe again.

They were the hit of the party, everyone loved them and I had to give out the recipe!  SO yummy, perfect texture, nice and "fluffy".  The peanut butter added just the right amount of extra flavor, love them!!!

I made these cookies exactly how the recipe said. I used unsalted butter instead of margarine so that the cookies would hold their shape and not spread too much. They looked great, but the taste was all chocolate and not enough cookie. I think that there was too much chocolate for the amount of dough in this recipe. And, to boot, the dough didn't have much of a flavor. Perhaps I would add less chocolate and add more salt, or do a margarine/unsalted butter combo.

This was one of the best chocolate chip cookie recipes I've tried.  Though I could only work 10 oz of the chocolate chunks into my cookie dough.  My cookies didn't spread very much at all.  I think those whose cookies spread a lot maybe didn't cream the sugar and butter together long enough or didn't use room temperature butter; both are very important.

These are good.  They are chewy.  I only put in 8 ounces of chocolate and that was plenty.  In fact, I think that there was more chocolate than dough which is why I gave this only 3 stars.  I will likely make these again but will double the dough and use 8 ounces of chocolate.

A soft cookie.  GREAT!!!  The dough does not go flat nor hard and crispy by the time the cookie is baked.  It you see this recipe, you must give it a try.  You will not be disappointed.

This is a good recipe. My husband loved them. I added another 1/4 c flour, added an extra egg white and omitted the salt since baking soda already has what you need for flavor. The first batch in the oven I cooked at 375 for 11 min...it was to long so I turned the temp down to 370 and time down to 9 min. The longer the dough sat out the better it cooked!

Good cookies overall. Mine did come out a tiny bit cakey. Maybe I used a tiny bit too much baking soda?? Still very good and will definitely bake again.

We had mixed reviews on these.  I personally did not like them at all.  My husband and co-workers thought they were good, but not great.  They seemed to be missing flavor.  Usually I love the dough, but didn't even like that.

This is my family's favorite chocolate chunk cookie(and the neighbor's too!).  They are AWESOME!  I follow the directions but instead of chopping my own chocolate, I use 2 cups of chocolate chunks.  Soft, chewy, and chocolatey.  What more could you ask for?

These cookies are fantastic! I followed the recipe as is and added walnuts and they were awesome! Baked about 11 minutes and came out soft and chewy just as I like my cookies! Definitely a keeper! I think I've found my new Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe!

These cookies are awesome! However I only cooked them for 8 minutes at 375 and they were hard when they cooled so I can't imagine cooking them for 12-13 minutes!

Not only the best TASTING cookies I've ever made, but also the best LOOKING cookies I've ever made. So much so that they're now banned in my house due to my own weaknesses. I split up the semi-sweet chips with equal portions of milk and semi sweet chips and a small handful of caramel baking bits. I also used a mixture of butter and Smart Blanace brand buttery stuff and it came out DELISH. Looooved these.

I agree with the poster who said there might be too much chocolate in these.  I had trouble mixing it all in.  I also had a bit of trouble getting them off the cookie sheet as the amount of chocolate made them very gooey.  Next time I'd use less chocolate-- but the taste was very good.

Very good cookie. Dough took minutes to make, and the end result was a soft, chewy cookie that the whole family loved.  I used mini Hershey Kisses instead of the chopped chocolate.

I enjoyed this recipe very much! It's your standard chocolate chip cookie recipe.  I added some walnuts and a little more vanilla extract (just because I really like the vanilla flavor). Sometimes I even mix half wheat flour with AP flour and you can't tell a difference. I also drizzled some melted white chocolate on top but with or without these cookies are great. This is my go-to cookie recipe!

Best Cocolate chip cookie recipe I have found on the net so far (and trust me we have tried many.....). I substituted 1&1/2 teaspoons of Almond extract for the vanilla and used semisweet chips for the choco-chunks. Based on previous cookie baking experiences  I also chose to reduce the heat to 325 and cooked for aprox. 10-12 mins. or untill just starting to turn brown.       The result.....a fantastic melt-in-your-mouth cookie that is slightly crispy on the outside and soft and chewy in the middle. :) None of the cookies from our first batch lasted long enough to cool completely. :) Kudos on a great recipe!! I Highly recommend.

This is by far my FAVORITE cookie recipe! I make them all the time, and everyone loves them. This cookie dough is perfect for all different kinds of cookies. Today I made this dough, and instead of using chocolate chunks, I mixed in white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts...they were to die for!

These were really awesome, I cooked the the full amount of time and they were a little crunchy, the left over dough I'm going to take some suggestions and cook only about 8 minutes.  It was a great way to use up the frozen leftover advent calendar chocolates from Christmas!

Exactly the "chewyness" I was looking for!  I made half of the batch regular chocolate chip, and the other half I threw in chocolate chips and butterscotch chips.  FABULOUS!!

Thank you so much!! I have been looking for a Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe for a long time and this is the best I have ever come across. The first time I made them I used regular sized chocolate chips and they came out a little flatter and not as sweet, then used Jumbo sized Chocolate Chips or chopped up chocolate bar and they were more like the photo.. These are amazing cookies!!! Thanks again for sharing this master piece!

This was a delicious cookie. Soft and chewy but it spread way more than I anticipated. Since it tasted good I want to try these again - but will drop smaller rounds of dough on the cookie sheet or maybe even try chilling the dough a bit first. I really wanted them to look more like the picture and not break in half when you pick them up because of the thinness and softness of the cookie. When I make again, I will update my review/star rating accordingly. Thanks for sharing!

I didn't use the chocolate called for, but rather 1 1/2 cups of peanut m&ms.  So, the cookies are quite lumpy because of the big m&m's, but they taste awesome!  This is one of the BEST cookie doughs to eat raw (if you're like me)!  I cannot think of a better tasting recipe for dough.  My cookies went a little flat after baking, but probably a result of my m&m's.  I only baked 9 minutes and 10 minutes for my two loads.  SO DELICIOUS!  Oh, and I used smart balance omega-3 sticks instead of butter.

Great cookies! My 2 year old and husband (and husband is a bonus since he doesn't like cookies that much) really like them. I think I might use less chocolate next time. Just me and my husband's own preference!

Amazing dough!  Amazing cookie!  I JUST made these for my family, and college niece, and we've had a hard time not eating them all before the rest of the family gets home from school!  The dough was probably the best I've ever had...kind of a caramel-y taste.  I should say here I did only half cup of white sugar, and 1 and a half cups of brown. (I love the taste of brown sugar) I was also a little more generous with my pure vanilla. With all the butter and brown sugar, it made a delightful flavor.  I also used milk chocolate chips, pecans, and M&Ms.  YUM!  They were not quite as full as the photo (but not flat either.)  I got impatient and took them out too soon, and they were still slightly doughy, but still delicious.

Very good! Simple, fast and tasty. I used 1/8th of a tsp less soda, as someone suggested to use a bit less and I found these to be crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside and just wonderful. A definite keeper.

For me, this was the best chocolate chip cookie I have ever made at home.  Mine looked exactly like the picture, didn't spread, and were nice and soft.  I wouldn't call them chewy, but they had a perfect consisitency.  I followed the direction exactly, and my husband raved about them.  However, I only got 20 cookies out of this recipe, instead of the 30 I thought I might get.  GREAT RECIPE!

This is an excellent recipe!  I added a bit more butter, a touch less baking soda, and some cinnamon because I wanted to make sure that they were not a cakey cookie.  They are so delicious!  The dough did taste really floury, which was odd, but the end result was perfect.

These cookies are fabulous! I used semisweet chips and added a little bit of cinnamon to give it a little extra. It is definitely one of the best that i have made.

I made these cookies and brought them to work... they did not last more than 5 minutes! Everyone loved them! Definitely a hit! If you want them chunky... just add more dough. Thanks to whoever put the recipe out!

My family and I have gone crazy over these cookies. I've been very loyal to the Mrs. Field's recipe for many years. This recipe was much easier, both in mixing and in spooning the cookies out onto the sheets. While this dough looked completely incapable of being handled, it didn't need any shaping or flattening to turn out perfect cookies. All in all, this recipe cut the total prep/bake time in half and was easily half the effort. The only alterations I made was to use my Tollhouse chocolate chips instead of baking chocolate and I increased the salt to 1/2 tsp. I baked them at 360 degrees for about 9 minutes each, removing from the oven early to get slightly underdone cookies. They did brown a bit more out of the oven, more so than my old recipe, so I was sure to pull them out while they were still pretty light.

OUTSTANDING COOKIE RECIPE!! I did not have the chocolate required so I used milk chocolate chips. Great soft chewy cookie and universal chip option.

These cookies are amazing!  They're really chewy, but not in a gooey or fluffy way, which is nice.  The only thing I would change is maybe putting in a little less backing soda (there was a bit of an after taste), but other than that, these cookies are perfect!

I thought they were very good. They almost taste like s'mores without the marshmellow. A helpful hint is you don't need to spread them 2" apart because they don't spread out they fare up almost like a cake. I used margerin and they might taste better with butter. They weren't as chewy as I thought but they were pretty yummy!

Maybe I did something wrong. I followed the recipe but they still spread too much. They tasted like every other chocolate chip cookie.

These cookies were wonderful. They stay soft and are easy to make. Will use this recipe from now on! One note- mine only took about 9 minutes to cook, so keep an eye on them.
