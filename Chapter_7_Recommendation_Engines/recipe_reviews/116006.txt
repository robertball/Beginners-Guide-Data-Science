This was excellent. I'm not a big fish eater but it came out great. Changes: more honey, marinate longer than 20 min!, reserved the marinade boiled it and served it as a sauce.
Would definitely make again.

This was by far the best salmon I’ve ever tasted.  I made the marinade exactly as instructed but my ginger looked old so I substituted ground ginger.  I love the taste of fresh ginger and can’t wait to try it in this recipe the next time I cook it.  I had to heat up the oven for another dish I was making so rather than grill this; I cooked it in the oven on 450.

We have access to tons of great salmon, so we're always looking for the next best thing.  This is a really nice marinade/glaze because it lets the salmon flavor come through.  I was worried it would taste like teriyaki, but it did not.  Very subtle.  Fresh ginger tip: freeze your fresh ginger in a baggie and grate it frozen, peel and all.  The peel comes off on the front side of the peeler and doesn't get into your dish.  You also don't need to bother with putting it in the tinfoil boat to marinade.  We did it in a baggie.  Tonight we're going to plank it after marinading instead of cooking it in the sauce.

Loved this! Did not use honey (had none) and used a generic teriyaki sauce in place of soy sauce.  Put the salmon filet in foil pouch and grilled it for approx. 5 minutes each side.  Added a touch of butter after fish was plated and the taste was incredible.  Served it with asparagas and corn on the cob.  My husband, definitely NOT a fan of fish, asked for it again!  Will positively share this with friends.
Thanks!

This is the best marinade for salmon I have ever used. I marinated it for 2 hours. It doesn't overpower the fish. The only thing I did different was grill it on a soaked cedar plank. I roasted fingerling potatoes and asparagus on the grill with it and served it with a Oregon Pinot Noir. Truly a restaurant quality meal.  Thanks for the recipe. I will use this over and over again.

In the past my husband would only eat fresh fish he caught.  Well, I bought some salmon and made this recipe and he loved it.  The only change is that I did not add the giner root - did not have it on hand but will probably not use it in the future either as it was great the way I made it.

I agree it does need to be marinated longer.  I marinated as directed in the recipe and found this salmon to lack flavor.  The ingredients are pretty basic to many salmon marinades however they usually call for a longer marinating time.  That would be my only suggestion.

This was the best tasting and easiest salmon recipe I have ever made.  I only used 2 salmon filets, but made the full marinade for grilling.  It was fantastic and is taking over in my recipe book as my #1 salmon recipe.  I paired with thai noodles and a nice fresh salad.  Yum!

This was fabulous! The flavors just pop! The foil "pan" worked great on the grill, and served to hold the marinade nicely. And no fishy grill to clean. I made a few changes based on taste and what I had: used salmon steaks; lime juice rather than lemon; minced PA Sweet onion, not green onion; added one clove garlic, crushed, and a drizzle of toasted sesame oil. Served with homemade fresh peach salsa and couscous. Incredible blend of flavors, and better than most restaurants. Thanks, Esmee!

Excellent! The salmon had great flavor. I did marinate for probably 45 minutes while I prepped the rest of the meal. I skipped the shallots and added black pepper, but otherwise followed the recipe. Not too sweet and great flavor from the basil. Thanks! :)

We liked this very much but do think it needs to marinate 45 minutes to an hour for more flavor.  We really like our salmon sweet so I am going to try adding a bit of brown sugar as well as a bit of molasses when I make this again, also think a pinch of salt would bring out the flavors more.

My new favorite grilled salmon recipe!  I did not not have fresh ginger or basil, so I used ground ginger and dried basil.  I marinated for about an hour before grilling.  Whole family loved it!

Wow!  What an outstanding recipe.  I got rave reviews - even from my picky wife who said this was the BEST salmon she had ever ate!  I did marinate for longer than the 20 minutes (about two hours) due to family scheduling, but everything else was just as called for in the recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing - it is FABULOUS!

This was delicious.  Everyone liked it.  There weren't any leftovers.  I left out the Worterschire sauce due to wheat allergies.  Still very good.  This will become a regular in our home.

Really don't like fish but this was a hit. I marinated it for a few hours not the 20 mins as suggested. I really liked the fresh taste and not to sweet.

This was enjoyed by my family.  Next time I will double the marinade (or half the fish ) and marinade for the day.  I think that will make it a 5 star for us.

Used the marinade ingredients, but not the method of cooking. Just marinated it and put it on the grill. My family ate it, but nobody said anything, and I'm sick of asking at every meal if everyone likes their food. Thanks for a good recipe!

I used rainbow trout and lime instead of salmon and lemon, because that's what I had on hand. Came out really delicious and so easy. I did marinate a couple hours like others have suggested. I also baked in the oven at 450 degrees. Yumm! Thanks for this fabulous recipe!

Salmon has great natural flavor but I prefer a little more kick.  Also, I would marinade the salmon longer and add more marinade per salmon amount.  It was super easy so that is a plus.  We used a grill pan instead of individual wrapping each one.  This may have caused undesired results.

This was delicious!  My husband loves salmon, but it's not my favorite...until I tried this!  I'm mom to 5 and evenings are usually chaotic - tonight was no exception!  But, even with a couple of prolonged interruptions, this was an easy recipe and tasted so good!  I served it along with the Brown Rice recipe from this website...we'll be doing this again, and soon!!  Thank you!

I participated in another RE'ers game involving first names and selecting something to make out of our recipe boxes that most closely resembled our names. This was mine and it didn't disappoint. Very easy to prepare with readily available ingredients. I did have to sub dried basil for the fresh however and in the end, I am sure it made a difference, but I think it may have been slight. Because of weather, I did as some others have and baked it in a 350 oven for approx. 15 min. and finished under the broiler. I'll be making this again.

This is a fantastic recipe and the marinade can't be beat for salmon! I actually use this recipe on the charcoal grill - it's easy, quick and delicious. Putting the salmon skin-side down on the foil makes for the easiest cleanup ever! Highly recommended!

I am not a fish-eater by any means but this recipe looked too good to pass up. I used orange roughy instead of salmon and took the advice of another reviewer and turned the leftover marinade into a glaze. It turned out excellent- the entire family enjoyed it! Thanks, Esmee!

Great recipe! Easy and tasty. I didn't have any shallots, so I used 1T chopped green onions. I also made the marinade for 3 pounds but had only 1 1/2 pounds salmon. Very moist. My husband liked it alot. Will make it again. Thanks!

My boyfriend made this recipe last night and it was great.  We did not have any ginger root on hand, so we used ginger powder.  He grilled the salmon and a side of asparagus.  We also had couscous as a side.  Delicious!

We lived in Seattle for 11 years and are picky about our salmon.  When I noticed this recipe was used there for an annual event I had to try it.   Great tasting marinade that did not overpower the salmon, but enhanced it.  Like other reviewers I might marinade a bit longer next time.  Our son poured some of the extra over pecans and said it was delicious with those too.  Will add this to my make again folder.

Fixed this tonight, and though it took me a little while to prepare (I wasn't properly prepared), it turned out very well!  Very tasty!  I will definitely prepare this again.  I had planned on grilling the salmon, but my grill ran out of gas during the pre-heat, so I broiled instead in the foil that the fillets were already in.  The skin side seemed a little soggy, so next time I would flip them, peel the skin off and then broil for a few more minutes.  I didn't use any shallots in the marinade, and I used about 1/2 of the basil.  I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, teriyaki sauce since I didn't have any soy sauce, less worstershire sauce and more honey.  I marinated for probably 25 minutes (my wife was hungry), but would probably do more.  Rob

Excellent!  I only used 1 Tbsp honey and realized at the last mint I had no basil so I substituted about a teaspoon of dried tarragon - definitely a different flavor, but it worked!  I love that the marinade adds flavor, but does not overwhelm the fish as I love the flavor of salmon.  Can't wait to make this again!

Best salmon I have ever made! So moist and had a lot of flavor! Stuck it on the grill, closed it, set my timer for 20 minutes and forgot about it!  Plus the skin stuck right to the foil and peeled away. Not only delicious, cleaned up in 30 seconds! My kids gave it a ten! My new fave salmon recipe

I've been looking for the perfect sockeye salmon recipe and this one gets pretty close.  There's been really good quality salmon recently so I gave this recipe a shot.  I didn't have any honey so I substituted brown sugar and it worked like a charm.  Fish was cooked perfectly and everyone loved it.

This was amazing! I had bought a skinned salmon filet, so before grilling I sprayed my tin foil with grape seed oil. I preheated my 4 burner grill to high. I then placed the tin foil over the middle two burners, which I had turned to low, while turning the two outer burners to medium. This eliminates charring. I flipped it after 5 minutes and cooked 5 more minutes. I might use a tad less lemon next time, but truly loved the taste! I will be making this again!

This was tasty!  It would have been better if I had cooked the fish longer- ours was a little fleshy rather than flaky on the inside!  (Good thing we are sushi eaters so it didn't bother us too much to eat it anyways.)  I also think longer cooking would have baked the glaze on a little more.  The marinade was a bit soupy on the fish for my taste but it was quite delicious.

I will make it again with a longer cooking time next time.

Amazing taste. Used this recipe on the BBQ with cedar plank. Did not use basil but added Tarimd Sauce. Had Steelhead trout instead of salmon. Cooked one side only 15 mins. The most moist fish. Everyone at the party loved it.

Ok, so I hit send too fast after thanking Anne for the inspirational recipe...Here's how I used her wonderful recipe as a base with modifications. I added a tablespoon of brown sugar, a teaspoon of red pepper flakes. I used minced Vidalia onions and ginger paste because that's what I had. I marinated for one hour and grilled on cedar planks. We were in heaven, so yum! Thanks, Anne!!

This really was tasty...my boyfriend said I need to keep this recipe and make it again.  So I will.  I did have to make a substitution because I didn't have any lemons.  So, I added one tablespoon of Apple Cider Vinegar for the citrus brightness and, so it  wouldn't taste like vinegar, I added some white wine (I used Chardonnay) until it was a thick,but pour-able,  consistency.  Also, didn't have shallots but did have freeze-dried red onions so used those as well as freeze-dried basil (Litehouse brand makes them & they're very good).  As I started to rate this recipe again, I discovered I had already made it twice before...so it works!  Try it, you'll like it:)

I used skinless filets and marinaded in a ziploc. Didn't have any shallots, used thinly sliced yellow onions, worked wonderfully, even kept them on the salmon as I cooked it. Nice touch if you like onions. Great simple recipe. Will use again and again.

Have made this several times; I'm the Salmon King now; its saved on my phone so it's always with me in case I'm somewhere and it's needed fast to help in an emergency.   I increase the liquid ingredients a bit to make more marinade and keep it moist while cooking. Once the meat thermometer hits 140 I take it off the grill and it ends up perfect and moist.

I wasn't sure how these flavors would meld but I have to say this was spot on.  Served with asparagus and broccoli.  My only complaint is you don't get a crispy skin when cooked this way but I don't know that I would trade the crispy skin for any loss of flavor.  I didn't have shallots so used green onion and garlic.  Looking forward to using shallots next time.  This an Asian taste for sure.  Rice would be a nice additional side.

I made this recipe a couple of times since finding it.  It was a hit and my girlfriend said it was the best salmon she had ever eaten. Since i have some marinade made ahead. I have company from out of town coming and I am ready to make it again.  It is easy and delicious.

This was an excellent dish. I happened to make more of the sauce than I needed and noticed it was just cooking on the grill. I poked holes in the foil and when the juice hit the charcoal it made a very good smoke flavor to the salmon

This was pretty darn good! I kicked it up a notch, because when I tasted the marinade, I felt it needed a bit more flavor. I would definetly marinade it longer next time, but over all, my family really liked it. Thank you for sharing this, I'll be making it again!

We loved it.  Placing it in my go to recipe binder.  Had no ginger root but used 1/2 teaspoon ginger powder.  I marinated it for two hours in refrigerator and then took it out to warm for about 20 minutes before placing it on grill.  So easy to take off the grill.  Skin stays on the foil and grill is still clean.

Great!  I made the recipe using the ingredients as listed, as well as using the tin foil "pan".  The only thing I changed was letting the salmon marinade for 1 hour before grilling.  I have never used fresh basil with salmon; it was really nice.  My 8-month-old even ate several pieces.

Everyone loved this recipe! Even my mom who claims she doesn't like salmon! My brother in-law commented that he recently paid $60.00 for salmon that was comparable to mine! I'll take that as a thumbs up! Definitely will make again!

Just made this tonight with salmon caught and frozen in Alaska by a guy who comes to our farmers market.  Marinated about 40 min. which gave it nice flavor.   Didn't have fresh basil, so used 1 Tbsp of dried basil, and no shallots, so used 1/2 Tbsp of dried minced onion.  
Used a  Thermapen to take it off the grill at just over 120 F, which was perfect.  Sockeye can get tough if cooked too long.

Used 2 layers of heavy foil for the "pan" and that meant it was cooking in the marinade.  Thus, the skin did not stick to the foil, but was easy to slip off on the plate (tho less appetizing, of course).  

Added to my favorites to make again.

came out pretty good. Basil works well to counter fish taste. Cooking it all on the foil, makes it more of a poach than a grill. May try longer marinade and plae directly over the grill next time.

I made this the other night.  It was fabulous.   Used 2 wild salmon steaks and baked them in the oven.  Didn't change the recipe except for using dry basil (didn't have fresh) and green onions because no shallots.  This is now my salmon (and probably other fish) marinade for good.  Thank you Esmee

This was AMAZING!  I made a pound of fish, but left the marinade measurements the same.  I did marinate longer, as others recommended, probably about an hour or so.  I used dried basil, rather than fresh (forgot to pick it up when I did the shopping), maybe two tablespoons.  I also juiced only half the lemon, and sliced the rest and laid the slices over the fish as it grilled.  Use thick foil to make the little boat, or double up the foil under the fish - my foil tore as I was putting it on the grill, and leaked some of the marinade out over the coals.  We had this with grilled asparagus, and arborio rice pilaf - my husband was in rapture.  Great recipe!

Fantastic recipe - I made as indicated but since it's winter in Nova Scotia, cooked the salmon fillet indoors. I marinated the salmon as other reviewers suggested, for 2 hours (saving some for a serving sauce), baked the fillet for 10 minutes in a 450 degree F oven, and then broiled for an additional 10 minutes. The salmon separated from the skin easily, the flavour was awesome and I served the saved marinade for a table sauce. Delicious.
