Changed it up a little. Used Aidells chicken and apple sausages instead. I warmed and slightly seared the sliced sausage in a skillet.And I caramelized the walnuts with some butter and brown sugar in a frying pan. My husband, myself and our four kids loved it. Even the 3 yr. old and 4 yr. old ate every last bite.

Yum!  I grilled the Chicken Apple Sausage (a brand I bought at Aldis)  and let it cool while I assembled the salad.  Otherwise I made everything as written, and it was great!  A very light, flavorful, healthy dinner on a Summer Evening.
