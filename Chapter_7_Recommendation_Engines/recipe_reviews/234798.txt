This salad is fabulous!  I loved all the flavors together.   Instead of tossing the squash in with the mushrooms I just roasted butternut squash cubes with olive oil, salt & pepper at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes.   I also used a blend of spinach and arugula.  I used cranberry and orange goat cheese and it gave a great sweetness to the salad.   I think this would be great with dried cranberries added also.   I served with a light dijon vinaigrette sweetened with a touch of honey.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will be making this over and over again.

I've made this several times - it always gets rave reviews. I didn't use mushrooms or pine nuts because I don't like them, and I've used spinach in place of or combined with the arugula.
I've taken it to pot luck type dinners and it's very easy to assemble on site. I can even cook the butternut squash and bacon a couple days before, then zap it in the microwave and top the greens as directed when you're ready to serve.

This mean was fantastic!!  I'm on a diet and so I substituted  nitrate-free turkey bacon for the regular bacon and omitted the crumbled goat cheese and added some red onions to the recipe and served it with a balsamic dressing.  My husband and I thought this salad was soooooo good -- good enough for company or even on our Thanksgiving table!
