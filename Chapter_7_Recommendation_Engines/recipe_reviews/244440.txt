Very pleased.  Ghirardelli chips are the best with good quality lemon drops.

Delicious! I sprinkled some additional lemon candies on top before setting, just so it would look prettier. This would be a great springtime treat. Thanks for sharing. :)

I use Merken's or Ghiardelli white chocolate melts. ( Melt them low and slow in the microwave, stirring every few minutes.  They are much easier to melt than white chocolate chips.  I use Lemonheads (crushed of course).  I've had several people tell me how much they enjoyed the Lemon Bark in the Christmas packages that they have received. EASY!!!!

Taste was delicious but breaking the lemon drops (Brach's) was very difficult, and ended with powder in between chunks. Started with a rolling pin, went to a mallet and finally used a hammer. Note to try Lemonheads if we decided to make again.

I made several different barks for office gifts last year and everyone  who got this one loved it.  I divided the batch into quarter-pound servings; one recipient ate his entire portion in one sitting!  Last week a co-worker hopefully asked me if I would be making it again this year, so it was definitely memorable.

My only issue with it (and the reason for the lost star) is that I found it very , VERY difficult to crush the lemon drops.   I had to have my husband whack them with a mallet and even he had trouble getting them to break apart; and the double-layer of plastic freezer bags wasn't enough to keep the shards from tearing through.  Had to be very careful to not get plastic shreds in the bark.
