These are absolutely delicious!!  I lived in Portugal for a little over a year and ate them in about 1000 different cafes, and this recipe is so authentic!  Just FYI, they are supposed to fall a bit in the middle - that is what makes them so perfect for different toppings.    They are best on the day made, so you probably want to avoid making them in advance for anything.

I just can't understand the negative reviews for these. I used a nonstick muffin pan to make them and had no problems with sticking. I also tried almond extract instead of vanilla. I can't stop eating them...delicious!!

I was out of sugar at home so I used the new Splenda blend baking sugar (1 cup) instead of 2 cup of sugar, fat free milk and added about 1/2 tsp of lime juice.  It turned out awsome, very crispy on the outside and custard texture on the inside.

All I can say is WOW! what an easy recipe with little clean-up!  I brought these to work without even trying them first, I had fresh strawberries in the fridge and also carmel sauce on hand, I did, half and half and can't tell you which one I liked better!  I'm not sure if it will work but I'm going to try using my smaller muffin tins for more of a bite-sized treat!  One things for sure, be generous when greasy the tins!

OH MY GOD. I love these. Whenever Scotty makes em for us here at the office, I just can't help myself... I like mine served warm with fresh sliced strwberries on top. Seriously deeeeelicious! 
Note: Be careful not to overcook em.

WARNING: These are not really "cakes"... more like a crispy shelled baked custard.

Excellent.  I've tried a much more difficult version of queijadas and it came out awful.

This one is super super easy and is absolutely delicious.  I used 1% milk and it was yummy.  I also decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup and didn't miss it.

Added some shredded coconut and voila...a quick dessert for any night of the week.

These 'lil things are pretty good.  I made them with peaches...I don't think I would have liked it too well without the fruit.  They taste much like a custard.  I like them better cold than hot, but it's good either way.

My son had to make a Portuguese dish for school and, of course, he didn't tell me until the last minute. We found this recipe with ingredients we already had and they turned out great. Used less sugar as other reviewers suggested and sprinkled coconut on before baking. That was last night and I just made them again for breakfast.  Kids loved them.

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it.

My two year old LOVES these... they were extremely easy to make and very tasty. I used 1 1/2 cups sugar after reading the reviews and will likely use only 1 cup the next time I make them (but there will be a next time). Went very well with frozen blueberries on top. 

For the few who said these were too plain to present I disagree. I used a square muffin tin, and served on a small (4" X 4")... with some whipped cream and berry spilling over this dish is beautiful!

In both, the middle was silky vanilla WOWness!  Thanks for the recipe.  I also make chocolate, caramel and raspberry sauces on the side to serve with them.

When I took them out of the oven they were  golden brown, however the sides and bottom were not cooked. I didn't want to burn them so I went ahead and took them out, they were okay, but it was a disappointment that they didn't turn out like the pictures. Also, I had lots of batter left over...

I found this recipe by pure fluke and put it aside, making a mental note to make these for a friend's birthday. He grew up eating these and gets them very rarely now that no one in his family remembers how to make them. I brought them to his birthday party and he and his family were thrilled! His sister insisted I send her the recipe and his dad was so happy and said they tasted just like the ones he ate while growing up in Portugal. Thank-you for such a wonderful, authentic recipe!

These were really good.  I made two small batches.  One batch was made as written, and was fabulous.  The second batch I decreased the sugar by 1/2 and found that I still loved them.  So in the future I'll make these with 1/2 the sugar (read: so I don't fill so bad filling them with goodies!).  I've already got it in my head to make these with some grated lemon rind, then fill them with lemon curd (yum).  Thanks for a quick, easy, and delicious idea.

These were lovely.  They didn't stick at all.  I made 1/2 as written, and the remaining 1/2 with coconut and coconut essence.  The standard one's were a lot better.  The texture is remarkable. They were a little sweet, but not sickly, so next time will cut down the sugar.  Oh, and there will be a next time!  Many thanks to submitter.

These are so good! I used almond milk and reduced sugar by half a cup. The only problem I had was that It was very difficult to get them out of the muffin tin in one piece as they were very delicate and stuck to the bottom. I served them with vanilla frozen yogurt and a sauce of frozen fruit I heated on the stove sweetened with overripe frozen bananas from my freezer. Displayed well and went over great! Would be a 5 star except for the sticking. Thanks!

this recipe is so easy to make.  It is also very tasty.  They really do not last very long because you can't eat just one!  Make sure to use whole milk not skim because they just don't come out the same. I made mine with lemon zest added to batter and lemon extract. Also be sure to have a well greased muffin pan.

This was a hit for us with taste and ease of preparation. I used mini-muffin tins to have smaller bites for a large crowd and added sliced strawberries on top after baking. A great first Portuguese recipe for an American living in Portugal!

These were a fun little treat.  I was curious about the recipe, so I decided to make it.  It is like a little custard surrounded by a chewy crust.  They're pretty yummy, but I'm not crazy about them.  I topped with Lemon Sauce from this site.  I used a mix of whole and 1% milk and cut back on the sugar by 1/2 cup.

We really liked this one.  I am not sure what it's supposed to taste like, and since I baked it for an extra 5 minutes, the center was not exactly custard-like.  BUT, it reminded me of the Chinese sweet rice cakes that are battered and fried (crusty on the outside, gooey on the inside).  Very unexpected, but just in time for Chinese New Year!

Definitely tastes better fresh out of the oven.  I cut the recipe in 1/3 and made six at a time.

Perfect, I have been looking for the right recipe for Queijadinhas (as I knew them in Brazil) for ages and accidentally stumbled on this one.  This is the best recipe for these I have found, just like I remember.  For the naysayers...they are supposed to fall down in the middle, more of a custard tart than a cake.  They do stick, but not if you use plenty of Pam and let them cool before removing.  If you get hockey pucks, try filling the cups more...you should get only 18 from this recipe, if you get more, you are not filling your pan enough.  Put the zest of 1 lemon in, or try some coconut instead, I've never had these plain like the recipe says, lemon or coconut make perfect compliments.  I guess these are not for everyone, but anyone who doesn't like this recipe must not have any clue how these are supposed to be, these are just right.

If you cook these properly, these are magical.
They are very sweet.  
The prep is very quick. 

These are easier to make with whole milk.  With 2% they don't seem to get as golden brown or have the same texture.  The time these were all mushy on the inside I blame on the 1% milk.   

If you make these and they turn brown before the 30 minute mark your oven was too hot and they will not be cooked inside. 
Greased your muffin pans well and they should not stick.  If they do stick, try to slide a butter knife around the edge.  If that does not help you may need to cut them in half and get them out one half at a time.

These are great! Someone in my office brought these in warm from the oven, and they were gone within minutes. For people unfamiliar with this delicacy, queijadas are cakey on the outer edges and soft in the middle.

Loved it, they were sooo yummy. I made them for a school fair and there were so good that someone actually snuck in at lunch and ate half the tray. they're really good if you want to make them in mass.

This was amazing!  They had a sort of chewy crispy crust that tasted a little like carmelized sugar and a custard center.  Yum!  Be sure to grease the pan well. :)

I made these last year for Christmas dinner for my Portugase Family and they absolutely loved them so much!  They were so amazed they have asked me will I make them again this year.  During Thanksgiving, they were hoping and were disappointed when I hit the door without them.  they are so sweet and smooth and the most amazing desert I have ever tasted.  With different flavors they are also amazing.  With fruit on top, with any kind of topping, they are amazing!  And really easy to make.   You wont be sorry!   Even if you over cook a batch, they are amazing!

I don't understand all the bad reviews!!! I am a horrible cook and I managed to get these right. I just greased the pan before pouring the mixture in. They came out beautifully and tasted great!!! Try drizzling a little chocolate over it for an even sweeter taste!

Extremely easy to make and absolutely delicious! I put some sliced strawberries on top and my friends raved about them for weeks!

these were wonderful but got four stars because they were a little too sweet for my taste. I would say unless you're eating them with tart fruit decrease sugar to 1 1/4. And I read in here someone said they don't keep to well overnight. This is true. They got pretty rubbery. Next time I think I will make a half batch so there won't be leftovers. very creamy though :)

I absolutely LOVED these!  We had company over for dinner on the weekend and when I was browsing on allrecipes the week before to decide on a dessert, I came across these.  I just had to try them as we were having friends over and the husband is Portugese!  Needless to say they both thought they were incredible and pretty authentic too!  I also gave a couple to the daycare that my boys go to as the owner is also Portugese - another hit according to her!  So, I will definitely make these again, I did opt to reduce the sugar after reading a couple of other reviews, used 1 1/2 cups.  Everything else remained, just didn't find they needed the full baking time and I did spray my tins very well and they came out nicely.  Awesome, thanks so much!!

Bon dia,
I love this recipe! I lived in the Acores for 6 years, 2-3 yr tours, and these bring back wonderful memories for my whole family and the friends we left behind on Terceira

Delightful.  My grandaughter who is 7, along with the help of her other grandmother who is Portuguese, created these for her school project.  We were all impressed!!!  Lemon flavoring was used with ours, topped with fresh strawberries and sprinkled with confectioner's sugar.

These were really good.  I made them this morning and brought them into work when they were still hot.  I took the advice of other reviewers and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 c.  I have a super sweet tooth and it was still plenty sweet.  I also sprayed the muffin cups VERY well and then sprinkled some cinnamon sugar in the bottom.  They slid right out of the cups.  My UPS guy came in and ate four of them.  Very, very good!

I love these. You can do all sorts of things with them. As is, they're wonderful. I've also tried them with shredded unsweetened coconut with coconut milk instead of milk, and they were awesome. One of my favourites was to soak dried dates in the warmed milk and then puree it, making them with brown sugar to make a sticky-toffee-pudding like taste. I've also subbed the flour with 1/2 the amount in cornstarch with good results, and once I made them with whole wheat flour by accident and you couldn't tell texture-wise. Awesome dessert.

this is very easy to make.  i didn't have any problems removing the 'cakes'.  i did a quick wipe with shortening inside the muffin tins.  tried 3 with cupcake liners; don't recommend using those!  i followed the suggestion of cutting down the sugar by 1/2, and they were still sweet enough for me, and i have a crazy sweet tooth.  topped some with coconut as recipe suggested: YUM!  sprinkled one with cinnamon: pretty good.

Followed recipe to a T, but filled pan 4/5, instead of 3/4. Bad idea, don't over fill! I also followed advice of others and greased muffin tins. Didn't work. They were crispy on outside & creamy on inside, but were firmly stuck to pan. Put in fridge and that helped. Also much nicer cold.

I really liked this recipe. It was very easy to make and all the ingredients were on hand. I don't know why others didn't like it. I actually didn't even know what these were or how they are suppose to look when they come out. But it was tasty and not burnt. They are like little patties. They have a cake type texture outside but creamy inside, like a custurd. I did take the advice of another reviewer and sprayed the pan with nonstick spray, also I added a little orange zest to the blender. Everything tasted great!

First time I've ever rated a recipe but felt I had to because this is so awesome. I've made it twice and it turned out perfrct both times! My family wants it every day! Used whole milk eventhough I would like to use less fat milk. I'm just afraid it won't turn out as outrageously good these are by following the recipe exactly.

These are sweet, quick and easy!  If you cook them exactly to the recipe, they will come out great!! My family can't get enough of them, I even used 1% milk and I cooked them a little bit longer so they will be nicely golden brown, they look and taste just like you would get a Portuguese Bakery!

I made these hoping that my kids would love them. They WERE quick and easy to make but the final result was AWFUL!!  The texture was gross and the taste was not too appealing either. I'll skip these from now on.

I followed the recipe as written and was very pleased with the result. Granted, I have not had them before so don't know how authentic they are, but they were crisp on the outside, creamy inside, sweet and delicious.  I dropped fresh raspberries in the little indentations and dusted with powdered sugar. I sprayed the cupcake pans liberally with Pam, let them cool for about 10 minutes or so and they popped right out. Thanks for the post.

The taste & texture are very close to the Original things! Soft and custard-like in the center and a solid pastry-like on the outside. My husband is Portuguese and he was VERY impressed by them. Will make again because they are so good and EASY to make! I did spray my pan with Bakers Joy prior to cooking just in case. Kept recipe as is...Wonderful!

I loved this recipe and so did everyone else in my house.  I did not have vanilla extract but I had a mixture of light brown sugar, icing sugar and cinnamon which I added instead.  Between 1/3 to 1/2 way through cooking I added 2 teaspoons of strawberry jam to each cupcake and finished cooking.
This is an easy recipe using ingredients you would normally have in your kitchen.  I would recommend this as a quick and easy dessert that can be made with your little ones.  ENJOY!

This is a great recipe.  My mother made these all the time, she adds the zest of a lemon and no vanilla.  Either way they are very nice, just a great memory from childhood.  We would have them with a sprinkle of cinnamon or powdered sugar.

The insides were still a bit gel-like, but I think they were supposed to be like that, like custard??  The batter was quite runny. I guess if thats how its supposed to turn out, then they were pretty good. I did cut the sugar down to only 1.5 cups, was just about the right sweetness.  And I used almond extract.

My goodness these are extremely addictive.  Honestly, one cup of sugar is all you need.  Also..I greased the muffin pans with butter then sprayed with a non-stick cooking spray. Absolutely no problems with them sticking. They came out perfectly.  I was a little freaked out when I first took them out of the oven because they were a litle jiggly....but no worries at all.  It made 18 perfect shells... I just gave a 6 to my neighbor who let me borrow two muffin tins and between me and my daughter we have only 3 left. So easy to make.  My daughter wants this to be part of a Sunday morning breakfast ritual.  Yum Yum Yum!

Super easy recipe and I love that I don't have to make a crust for the queijada...so does my mom!! I half the sugar though because I like to sprinkle mine with powdered sugar later with my coffee. I also double the vanilla and add lemon zest...mom does this to everything!!!

I've tried several queijada recipes and this one is pretty good.  My family likes coconut.  I substituted the vanilla for coconut extract.  I had a tough time getting them out of the cupcake pans so next time I'll spray them really good.  I put a dab of marshmallow creme in the center then topped with a lot of toasted coconut.  They were scrumptious!  Older Portuguese ladies even loved them.  Oh, one thing.  I did strain the mixture before I poured them into the pan.  Good luck.

My family loves this... I've been asked to make it NUMEROUS times!

One addition that is delicious is to add a shot of Bailey's Irish cream, some cool whip, and top with Hershey's chocolate and a carmel sauce.... delicious!

They don't look very fancy but they are a great.  I'd describe them as a combination between a custard and a cheesecake. I prefer them plain and warm just out of the oven.

These were fabulous! I had no clue what to expect, but since I had all the ingredients on hand, I decided to try them.I reduced the sugar by a little, and I sprayed the pan TONS before baking, so I didn't have any trouble removing them. They are a little chewy on the inside, and  a delicious egg custard on the inside. So delicious! And so easy! I will definitely be making these again, very soon. My mom said "These are the best things I've ever tasted!" Yum.

I disagree with decreasing the sugar. And i have found that if you serve them cold and add a whipped topping and fruit or vannilla pudding they are incredibly good. I got rave reviews from all my dinner guests and they all asked me for the recipe.

I would like to give this a better rating but to us they tasted a little bland.   As for the authenticity I would say that it was not what I was expecting.  Maybe different areas of Brazil may have a different variation of this dish, after all it is a very large country.  Overall it was good.  It just needs a little tweeking to make it better.

Deelish!! I made these for a semi-formal dinner party a friend was throwing, and they were the first dessert gone. Not bad for some picky teenage eaters. 

I took the advice of previous Bakers and cut down the sugar by about 1/2 C, and had the good sense to spray the pans a LOT; even then they put up a minor fight to stay in the tins. I also used Almond Extract, and was complimented on that particular taste. 

I used mini-muffin tins to make these as well, and had them bake for about 25min instead. They really are great finger-foods. Add a few chopped strawberries to the top when they're ready to serve- it taste great with the almond.

This were delightful little snacks.  I followed the recipe exactly and took the advice of some other posters and I sprayed my nonstick muffin pan just to make sure they didn't stick.  Those little Queijadas came out beautifully.  The whole family liked them.  Next time, I will try them with a little lemon zest or cinnamon. Thanks for a different and good recipe!

Going by what everyone else said these were supposed to be like, mine turned out just like they were supposed to. They had a sweet custard-like middle and a chewy/sticks to your teeth crust on the outside. Once these cooled they actually tasted really TOO sweet, so I think I'd cut down the sugar by at least a half cup next time. Most of mine looked sort of mangled once I managed to cut them out of the pan, so I wouldn't suggest making them for company until you've managed to perfect the art of queijada-extraction.

This recipe is perfect. these are just as I remember them--well, perhaps more of a custard than I remember, but amazing tasting. I tried using 'cardboard' muffin cups(waterproof ones- cheap and easy to find in Japan. Not sure elsewhere). they were perfect, as I was able to rip the queijadas right out after cooling. Also recommend adding lemon rind--be generous! Will reduce the sugar next time, as I nearly killed my japanese dinner guests!

Way too sweet.  Will cut back to 
1 1/4 or 1 1/2c. sugar next time.  Used lemon extract and a pinch of lemon peel.  The boys ate them up in no time.

Absolutely delicious! I ate four of these before I could stop myself. I used margarine instead of butter and it didn't seem to hurt it; next time I'll try 1% milk, too - and maybe some lemon extract. These are a very sweet, baked custard - cakey on the outside, creamy in the middle. To get mine out of the pan I let them cool completely, then used a butter knife around the edges and almost peeled them out of the cups. I will definitely make these again!

These are so great -- it's like magic happens in the oven!  I like experimenting with them -- I've had great results using melted butter and whipping the egg white (then folding it in to the rest) rather than just mixing them all together.  My favorite is vanilla extract with lemon zest added in.

I first found this recipe here a few years ago, and have been asked for the recipe almost every time I serve them.  They taste great, and are the ideal last-minute dessert for any season, being so simple to make, with no out-of-the-ordinary ingredients.  I almost always make them using non-fat skim milk.  They even taste good using soy milk, although this does change the texture and flavour a bit.

These are so delicate and delicious. The texture on the outside is flaky and just melts in your mouth. The inside is creamy and sweet. I put whipped cream and frozen blueberries on mine. It added a nice sweetness. I also reduced the amount of sugar in the recipe to a cup and 1/2. I'd never made anything like this before, so when I saw how thin the batter was I got nervous. But it baked beautifully! It took over an hour to bake these, but the outcome was well worth waiting for. :)

If you don't have a nonstick muffin pan, place muffin cups inside and it's like buying them in a bakery. My Vãvo made these all the time, she'd be happy to know I'm making them myself.

These were seriously good and seriously easy to make. I needed them to be gluten free, so I just used Namaste gluten free flour instead of regular flour. They reminded us of German pancakes.  I made some mini ones and regular sized ones. The mini ones took about 10 or 15 minutes less to bake. 

My husband actually lived in Portugal for two years. I was trying to surprise him with a dessert from there and chose this one since it was easy. He had never heard of them, but he still liked them and appreciated the thought. :)  My little kids all loved them, too.

Great recipe! I added the zest of one orange (you can also do lemon zest) as it is a very traditional flavor for queijadas.  They came out great! Obrigada Scotty!

I used the foil type baking cups and they came out great with no clean up! Also cut down some sugar but was still more than sweet enough.  Such an easy, quick, delicious recipe, tastes good hot or cold. Thank you so much for sharing!

The Queijadas recipe was authentic and tasted delicious.  I always use pure vanilla extract in my recipe.

These were really yummy and easy, but maybe just a little too sweet.  I used lemon extract and they had a great flavor.  They were custardy in the middle, and a little chewy on the outside.  I sprayed the cupcake tin with Pam beforehand, and they all came out easily except for one.

This is fantastic.  Has anyone else had a difficult time getting the little cakes out of the muffin tin?  Any suggestions as to how to get them out more easily?  I sprayed the muffin pan before adding the batter, but still had to cut around each one.  Is this normal?  These are so good.  I'll make them again even if I have to spend the extra time to coax them out of the tins.

Made 1/3 of the batch (6 servings) and wish I'd made more since they were pretty easy and I'd already dirtied the blender and they were pretty tasty. I had the Splenda baking sugar so I used that (50% of the recommended amt of normal sugar). I thought these were pretty sweet but I don't know if it's cause I subbed in Splenda sugar or because it called for too much sugar for my tastes?

This recipe is delicious it really is BUT and this is a big BUT, DO NOT pour the batter into cupcake paper cups because they stick. You really need to put lots of PAM or butter or Crisco in the muffin pans before baking. After you remove them from the pans, you can put the queijadas into the paper cups for looks. I gave it four stars only because this was not made clear in the instructions.

This was wonderful. I followed the directions except after reading reviews, I used half of the sugar and it's the perfect amount. Served with strawberries but awesome alone as well.

I have been wanting to try making queijadas for a while and decided to try this simple recipe.  They turned out pretty good although they aren't the same as queijadas I have purchased in Portuguese bakeries. I think these were too sweet for my taste and I will cut back the sugar if I make them again. Also, had to bake for an additional 10 mins to achieve the correct color/consistency. I will have to say this is a really easy recipe and they are pretty good!

My parents are from the Azores or islands of Portugal and my Godmother makes these. These are not exactly like the orignal, however they were a hit at my dinner party. I did add a potsticker lining for the cupcake and it added a bit mor texture and some crunch after sinking your teeth into the yummy custard.

Grease the pans!  Mine turned out to a gooey lumps of custard after I dug them out of the pans.

I love these little things! They're super-easy and use ingredients I always have. When they're hot, the center is almost liquid and they taste like cream puffs. Once they cool down, they taste more like custard. Either way, I think they're delicious. Definitely grease the muffin pan well (they'll stick otherwise), and they're not flashy enough for a fancy dessert, but as an everyday dessert, they're awesome.

The taste was alright, but the consistency was rubbery, and they stuck to the pan.  Will not make again.

I cut the recipe to make 12.  Used skim milk, half sugar, half Spenda  and added Almond essence. We ate them with vanilla pudding and raspberries, really good.  I let them cool a while before attempting to remove from the cake tins.  Will try with  lemon next time.

My husband loved these.  Nice and chewy on the outside with a smooth, creamy center.  They were a pain to get out of the pan so next time I'll be sure to do a better job greasing the muffin cups.  Otherwise, they are a simple, delicious dessert.

These were a huge hit!  I made them for my 4 year old's snack at school.  We had to bring in a snack that started with Q.  Not many choices for 4 year olds.  These were PERFECT!!  I tried them out on my family first and they all raved about them.  My BIL even asked for the recipe.

Very interesting! Super easy to make and the batter looks like it would never turn into a real cake. End result is crispy / spongy on the outside and creamy and sweet on the inside. Different, yummy and easy! Thanks!

Followed directions and was upset to find that I was unable to get them out of the tray.  I sprayed non-stick spray before pouring batter.  Didnt' work apparently.  They looked excellent cooked and in the tray. Not served.  Tasted excellent.  Too bad such a tiny dessert has to have so many colories.

These were so not worth the effort.  They took a lot of time and most of it stuck to the pan.  I made the mistake of making it for the first time for company.  I ended up hiding it under a bunch of ice cream.

Burnt on the outside, soupy in the middle. Ugh.
