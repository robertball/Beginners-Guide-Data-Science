Very straight-forward to make. I didn't end up using whipped topping mix because I also couldn't find it, but the cookies ended up being sweet enough.  
Definitely an interesting texture. They stay soft and chewy regardless to air exposure it seems, and have light spongey quality to them that is more substantial than angel food, but definitely more airy than, say, a chewy chocolate chip. 
I took these to a cookie exchange. Got a prize for most original, and a lot of positive comments. I was told that they tasted like real lemon, not artificial, and a lot of positive comments about the texture.

I made these for a cookie exchange because I wanted something different - they were wonderful! They taste just like a lemon bar, but in cookie form. They were a hit! I followed the recipe except for the whipped topping mix - I substituted about a quarter cup of powdered sugar. Also, I froze them raw in balls and baked later - still wonderful and perfect.

These cookies came out wonderfully, even though I used a toaster oven (I turned the temperature down 25 degrees since the oven tends to burn things).  I also omitted the whipped topping mix (the store didn't have it) and instead threw in a little bit of powdered sugar, although I'm not sure I needed to substitute anything.  The cookies have a nice crackled top and a cakey texture on the inside. My husband even thought they were really good, and he usually requires his desserts to be chocolate!

I've never made a cookie with such interesting ingredients!  These cookies are great - I made them at Christmas time, but they would be great in the summertime.  They're super light and refreshing!  Don't be afraid to try these because of all the crazy non-traditional ingredients!  They are awesome!

These cookies are fantastic!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and they are definitely the best lemon cookie I've ever tasted.  (Actually, they could be the best cookie in general!)  They are very moist and stay that way for a long time.  I made these for my parents and my boyfriend and his roommates and EVERDAY they ask when I'm going to make more.

These were good but the texture wasn't what I expected.  They were somewhat spongey.  still pretty good though.  I liked having the fresh zest and juice in the recipe.

Wow, these were terrific!  Lemony, tender, lightly chewy, HUGE.  The lime seemed unnecessary, so will try it without. Next time I'll make them much smaller than the recipe, maybe dropped by teaspoons instead of tablespoons, for a more normal size cookie.

Love these!!! The dough might scare one into thinking they won't turn out right as it is very gooey and jello-like. However, once the tablespoonfuls hit the powdered sugar, they are easily rolled into a ball. They are cake-like but still more of a cookie. Superb recipe!

What a hit these little numbers were.  I made them at Christmas and I've been getting requests from friends and family to make more of them.  They are far from an ordinary cookie and more of a dessert.  A big hit all-around.

These cookies are amazingly light, and the coconut gives them a slight chewy texture.  I brought these in to work, and everyone loved them.

well if you like lemon cake you will like these.  too cakey and not enough cook-y for me but tasted good.  dough is sticky and anything rolling in powdered sugar is messy.

Fantastic! I made these for my annual Christmas cookie assortment tins and they were such a big hit that I ended up baking them again for a cookie exchange party. They are the perfect combination of cookie and cake.  I did double the amount of lime zest and definitely had to cook for 12 minutes to get that crusty edge.  I will make these every year from now on!

Oh My... I'm eating one right now and it is so delicious. The slight crispy edges with the melt in your mouth center.  However I did not have any lemons but had a basket full of blood oranges so I grated the peel of those and used the juice.  I also added a bit of ground cloves which gave them an added wonderful spice effect. The look of them is quite impressive, I used tablespoon drops of dough rather than teaspoons and glad that I did.   I will be making these often... Thanks for Sharing~

These were good but not my favourite. I guess I prefer a firmer cookie and this is just like eating cake. Flavour was pretty good though.

Loved these!  Made them according to directions (except whipped topping mix) use some powdered milk and powdered sugar to replace that.

BEWARE!!!! YOU CANNOT EAT JUST ONE OF THESE COOKIES.....YUM YUM YUM.. Oh my, these cookies are really good.

I followed the exact recipe but doubled as I always do.  Next time I make these, I will try without the lime peel (even though the lime is an interesting flavor) I just want to try without.

My husband, 7 year old and 12 year old sons LOVED these cookies.  I like that they are different and they just MELT IN YOUR MOUTH!!

Thanks for a DIFFERENT cookie recipe.  MERRY CHRISTMAS & HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!

I made these exactly as the recipe reads and they were amazing! A big hit at work. So soft and flavorful. The dough was really sticky and impossible to get into a ball shape before putting into the powdered sugar. You just kind of have to glop them in and roll it around until it's covered. They cook into perfect circles regardless. Thanks for the great recipe!

Not very impressed at all. I wasn't a fan of the texture. They tasted really good, but I would have liked them better if they were more of a cookie texture. I probably won't make them again.

YUMMM!  Made as directed minus the topping mix.  Baked for about 12 min.  To keep the time consistent I used a 1in scooper.  Worked great!  Made about 18-20 cookies.  Hard to say since I kept eating them!!

These cookies are great but the batter/dough is so very sticky and tacky it is difficult to work with.  These are such a wonderful change from chocolate chip and peanut butter and all the "usual" cookies.  They are light and refreshing and if you are making a cookie basket, they really add a lot of color and lightness to all the other favorites.

Yummy. I did not use the whip cream mix and next time I will cut the coconut. I do not feel it added enough flavor for the texture. It is a lovely cakey, fluffy cookie. For those who felt the dough was hard to work with, refrigerate over night or pop in the freezer for a bit. These are similar to the chocolate crinkle cookies, but lemon instead.

I made this for my parents and brother and we all loved it.  These cookies are very good and I didn't change anything in the recipe.  They are so good that I can even bribe my bus driver into taking me home first by saying (and making) him them.  I highly recommend making this recipe.  Thanks for posting it!

These are the most delicious lemon cookies you could ever put into your mouth!  I take them to work and also send them where my son-in-law works and everyone begs for more.  I have never seen 4 dozen cookies disappear in the wink of an eye!  Must try these.

These cookies were very disappointing.  There wasn't much flavor and I followed the recipe exactly.  I give it one star as they did look pretty!

superbeeeee! I found the whipped topping at local grocery store. I didn't buy enough, only had one cup's worth, but no fear, still delicious.  Thank you for sharing!

Very good cookie.  I just made 120 for my work cookie exchange.  The only thing that was different than expected was the yield, the recipe says 18 and I got about double per batch...which worked for me!

This is probably the first recipe I've ever tried from here and made it exactly as the recipe is written.  These cookies turned out really good.  My only complaint is recipe said makes 18 cookies, so I doubled the recipe, and I ended up with 7 dozen cookies!  For this to make 18 cookies, they would be some BIG cookies! Oh well, more to enjoy!

Oh my word! These are AMAZING! I made a batch on Sunday. However I used a tbls. to meassure out the "dough" next time I'll make them a little smaller. It was hard to wait until they cooled down to eat. My kitchen smelled wonderful.
