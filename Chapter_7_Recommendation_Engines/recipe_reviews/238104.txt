I cut the recipe in half, cutting the ingredients down to a fourth would be better. The popcorn was very sticky and the heat was not what I was expecting.

I used a 3 oz bag of popcorn and smoked paprika. As a heat lover this turned out perfect. For those that are not into the heat factor I highly recommend cutting back on the cayenne pepper.

I accidentally added the sauce to the popcorn and tried to make the honey melt and the popcorn pop and I stunk up the whole kitchen. I have been banned from cooking, but the popcorn was awesome!
