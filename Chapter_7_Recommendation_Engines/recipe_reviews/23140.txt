My mother-in-law wanted yams for Easter dinner, so I made this recipe.  I didn't get syrupy and thick in the pan, I cooked it for about 45 mins. and the yams were done but there was no syrup - just water and seasonings.  So - I put it in a corning ware dish and popped it in the oven with all the liquid.  I let it cook at 400 degress for about 40 mins. and it turned out great!!  Everyone loved it and said they hope I make it for Thanksgiving!  I added a small amount of nutmeg, cinnamon and swirled some molasses on top while it was cooking!  It was a true success !!

The flavor was alright, not the best I've had, and there was too much liquid.  It wasn't a "syrup" as it never thickened.  The yams were just floating in loads of liquid.  I won't make this again.

I cooked the potatoes on the stove first. Then I put them in the oven with the sugars and butter. I too used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar. That is the only thing that I changed about this recipe. It was a hit with my family!

This is momma’s recipe!  If you want the candied yams to be more syrupy, decease the water to 1/4 cup, you really don’t need as much as the recipe states.

These always come out great. I leave the pieces of sweet potato bigger than what I'd consider a "cube" because otherwise they disintegrate.

These were quite delicious! I followed some of the other reviewers advice and only used enough water to coat the bottom of the pan, used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar instead of 2 cups white, and added 2 teaspoons cinnamon and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.   After the 40 minutes on the stove, I took out all the potatoes and simmered the syrup for about 10 - 15 more minutes to thicken it. After that I poured the syrup onto the potatoes, covered them up, and brought them over for Thanksgiving!  I thought they were good and the family gave positive reviews!

These were outstanding. I must have used four really big yams, because it looked like there was hardly any water in the saucepan, so I added more and ended up with a lot of the syrupy stuff at the end, but thats was alright....I just added some more cubed yams and cooked them again.  I also used half brown sugar and half white sugar and mixed the yams at the end with a hand mixture for a smoother consistency.  Maybe I am just partial to butter and sugar...but these were terrific and easy to make.  Thanks!!

The recipe was awesome. I cooked it on the stove until it was tender. Then I threw it in the oven with some marshmellows and let it bake for a few more minutes. It was awesome.

To many adjustments were needed for my taste. The potatos' were boiled for 15-20 minutes and cut into a baking dish.  I cooked on the stove top 1/2 stick of butter 2 teaspoons of vanilla, used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and a tablespoon of molasses. This warm sauce was poured over the potatos' and placed in the oven for 30 minutes at 375. The recipe I tried as written and was very bland. That maybe just to me!

I used canned sweet potatos to save on time.  However , next time I will just make the syrup part on its own . Then add the canned potatos towards the end. I added everthing at once / potatos were too mushy . My fault.

Thank you so much for this recipe. I have never made candied yams or eaten candied yams not even from a can. But my hubby loves  them and I was making them for him for the very first time the other night. This recipe was a great help. I did made some modifications. I didn't add any water, only the butter, I added the sugar, some vanilla, nutmeg and cinamon. It was great. My family and friends were literally asking for more, but I didn't have enough for so many repeats!

Nice recipe; I used orange juice instead of water. and added chopped pecans. I parboiled the yams and then put them in the oven covered, then took the foil off for 15 minutes. Tender and delicious!

Voted the best dish on the plate last night!  This is the first time that I made this dish and it was a hit!  I read several reviews and reduced the water to a minimum...next time I will not add the water at all.  I also placed the yams in a baking dish, added mini-marshmellows and baked it until the marshmellows were golden brown.  EVERYONE raved about the yams!!!

This was great...I was in a hurry so I parboiled the potatoes for about five minutes while I prepared the syrup mixture...I decreased the water, added a splash of orange juice and about 2t of cinnamon to the syrup and, while the syrup was a little watery (probably because mine only cooked for 15 minutes), the potatoes were delicious!

These were great and so simple to make. I loved the part about not stirring it. That left my time free to prepare other dishes for our holiday meal. This was a wonderful side dish with our ham. Thanks!

These are great.  I halved the sugar and added an equal amount of brown sugar.  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg and cooked it with the butter and sugar on the stove top just to melt the butter.  I then poured the mixure over the yams in a casserole dish and baked them at 400 for 40 minutes.  I cut the yam pieces fairly big and they don't fall apart and have a great texure.

This is the closest to my Mom's old fashioned candied yams that I have found.  I doubled the amount of sweet potatoes, halved first crosswise, then cut in quarters. I added a cup of sugar because of the extra sweet potatoes, but no extra butter.  I used my iron Dutch oven and lid.  In 40 minutes the potatoes were tender, held their shape as desired, (not mushy). However the syrup was too thin, so I spooned the potatoes into a casserole dish, and cooked the syrup a little longer until thicker, then spooned it over the potatoes.  Next time I'll omit the water altogether.  If you want old fashioned real candied yams and not a sweet potato casserole, try this recipe, but omit the water.

Hint,slice potatoes lengthwise, do not use any more than a tablespoon of water. The potatoes will make their own water; otherwise the potatoes will not thicken as they cook. For those of you who said you would never make this again try using less water. I also add a few drops of vanilla flavoring.

My husband wanted sweet potatoes without the marshmallows and pecans, etc.  A very plain kind of guy.  This recipe was the best I've ever used and so easy.  This will be the dish I use for every holiday meal.

These are so delicious; I will never used canned yams again...added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg; also, left potatoes in bigger chunks as another reviewer recommended.  A real winner.  Thanks!

These were a hit with my family this past thanksgiving.  There wasn't any left.  I like other reviewers use 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white.  I also added a little orange juice as well.  My hubby was a huge fan!!

I don't like sweet potatoes, can't stand them actually. But I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, and OMG!! Everyone loved it. I actually ate a little of it. I guess I can't say I don't eat Sweet Potatoes anymore. LOL!

Loved it!!! Me and sweet potatoe have never had a good relationship, but this recipe turned out great.  I did reduce the water and placed it in the oven (with marshmallows) for a few minutes just to brown the marshmallows.

Even though I cooked the yams separately before I put them in the oven with the butter and sugars, they were gasping for air and swimming in a pool of syrup when I checked them. Adding the vanilla and cinnamon gave them the taste of Cinnabon's, a smell that I avoid when I am at the mall. Much too sweet for human consumption. A noble effort, but I had to rate them 2 stars.

I changed it to 1/4 of water since it makes so much water, add a small amount of maple syrup, and 4 tablespoons of butter rather than a full cup.  Sprinkled with cinnamon, these really taste great!

I modified this dish to make it a little healthier, I love the basic taste of sweet potatoes and a touch of sugar.  I sprinkled as much sugar as needed to lightly dust the sweet potatoes in the pan and then only added a dab of butter.  My potatoes were done in 20 minutes.  Great snack on its own.

Delicious!  Even my somewhat picky kids ate it up. I think I actually like Yams, now that I've made this recipe.  Will share it with my mother-in-law! And will definitely be making this again!

I made this today for extended family Thanksgiving dinner.  I had 6 large yams, which almost filled a Dutch oven when cubed, so i estimated a doubled recipe.  Rather than a number of potatoes a pounds or cups quantity would be much easier to get the right amount, because 4 can be anything from a pound to 5 pounds..  I mostly followed the recipe, but other than the pre-measured butter I just estimated amounts.  Recipe changes include boiling the yams a few minutes, then draining virtually all the water, but as many others have said, I should have gotten rid of ALL of the water to avoid watery sauce.  There was no danger of scorching the yams.  I also added a tablespoon of cinnamon, about 1/2 tsp of cloves, nutmeg and allspice and a little less sugar, and added about 2 cups of dark brown sugar.  When the yams looked done I removed them with a slotted spoon and tried to reduce the syrup to make it thick.  I finally added 1 tsp of corn starch to help, and finally thickened it by letting the sauce cool some.  Then I added it to the yams in a baking dish, where it was just thick enough.  I added mini Kraft marshmallows (I’ve used generic marshmallows before, but they didn’t taste like Kraft!).  I put the dish in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes until the marshmallows got golden.  The family loved them, and ate almost all of them!  It was really more of a dessert than a side dish, so if you don’t want it that sweet use the recipe amount of sugar.

I made them today for x-mas and was kind of worried cause there was no cinnamon, nutmeg etc... But I followed the direction just like you said and these are the best candid yams I've tasted in a long time. I told my children, they might not get a lot...lol. :-)

I think I will use less liquid next time. I ended up having to cook then longer because it wasn't syrupy enought. I also did half/half white and brown sugar and added some vanilla and cinnamon.

This is a good base! I followed a couple other reviews and made the following changes: I added a cup of brown sugar and a few dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg (blended them with the white sugar). Instead of cooking them on the stove I put them in the over on 400 for 40 minutes. They were awesome! SN: I was also making a sweet potato soufflé at the same time and accidentally mashed the yams after boiling them - because of that I decided to give it slight stir after sprinkling the sugar blend on top. Everyone loved it!

I altered the recipe significantly after making it as written. I used six medium sweet potatoes, cubed. I melted one stick of butter in a pan, added the potatoes, and sprinkled on ONE cup of sugar and some cinnamon. When it started to boil I covered and turned heat down to low. It was done after 30 minutes. After making these adjustments it was great. Two cups of sugar is way too sweet and a whole cup of butter makes too much syrup. It definitely doesn't need water.

I made a smaller portion as a trial run gearing up for Thanksgiving. I went with the option of not using water and added the brown sugar, vanilla, and nutmeg to the recipe.

It turned out PERFECT!!! I'm ready for Thanksgiving.

I'm only giving this 4 stars because it is a good start, but it needs 1 tsp cinnamon, pinch of nutmeg, and a pinch of grnd cloves. And you can add more/less to taste. This recipe also has way too much water; the potatoes will be swimming in water. You do NOT need to add any water if you don't want to. (Try it without the water.)  I also melted my butter along with the sugars (1 cup brown/1 cup white) and the spices and poured that over top of my sweet potatoes. I cooked it on high to get it hot and then turned it down to a simmer to cook covered 45 minutes. I stirred it after the 45 minutes and left it uncovered to thicken. It thickens a bit as it cools.

This was really good.  I kind of estimated everything.  I used what to me looked like 3 big yams and cooked them per recipe, with just a bit of change.  As some of the other reviewers suggested, I added in a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg and a splash of vanilla, used half sugar and half brown sugar.  I also used almost a cup of water, as the sweet potatoes looked big to me, and it worked out very well.  I had syrupy sweet sauce on the bottom of the pan, not too watery and bland, and after I mashed the potatoes, it was like sweet potato casserole.  If anything, it was too sweet, even after I cut out half  the white sugar.  Otherwise, it was very good.

Very good recipe.  I did take the advice of others and use only 1/4 of water.  There was still a lot of water at the end so maybe next time I won't use any.  And I did add 1 tsp of cinnamon and it made the taste even better!

First time I tried this recipe and I loved it. I used to boil my yams and then bake them in the oven with butter and sugar and now I have a way to do it right on the stove. The aroma is intoxicating. I substituted 1/2 c. orange juice for the water and used 1 c. of brown sugar as well as butter, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a light drizzle of maple syrup. Yum!

Almost good as Granny's! Altered some:   I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of dark brown sugar. Added 2 teaspoons of vanilla flavoring and a few sprinkles of cinammon.!  Perfect!

I wish I would have read all the other comments.  Like everyone else, it was all liquid and no syrup.  I threw in three marshmellows at the end, did not help.  Next time, I'll try what the others did and leave out the water.

These were absolutely delicious. I did not add any water, I used only 1 cup sugar then added about 1/2 cup Splenda brown sugar. I also substituted Country Crock spread for butter. I also added cinnamon nutmeg and a little lemon extract. Soooo yummy!

Not bad!  it was actually pretty good,however, a tad too sweet and syrupy.  I guess next time I won't add so much water and maybe use a little less sugar :)  overall, very good.

The directions were great - my mother-in-law scoffed at me for cooking them on a stove and not in the oven, but everyone agreed that they turn out great.  I followed the recipe that SOUTHPAWCOOK posted in their review (adding brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg) and they were very soupy, so I just strained out the yams with a spoon, put them in a corning ware cooking dish, put the mini marshmallows on top, and them put them in the oven until the marshmallows were golden brown.  They turned out great that way!

This is a great base recipe but you will probably have to experiment with the size of the cubes to get them to the consistency you like. I like it better with half the butter and sugar and then mashed to a hot buttery sticky sweet pulp. Then I eat it in a bowl all by itself.

These were pretty good. I sliced the potatoes and at the end, I dumped a bit of the butter sauce out.. layered the potatoes in a casserole dish, sprinkled some mini marshmallows over the top.. and broiled until the marshmallows turned golden brown. 
That is what made them 5 stars for me! (and my kids ate them too!) Next time I will add a little less butter and sugar. Thanks for the recipe

Over the holidays I had a get together at my house. I made this dish for the kids as I know how hard it is to get them to eat vegtables. The problem was the adults couldn't keep out of it. I had to share the recipe with everyone.

This was a wonderful dish at Thanksgiving. My family loved it.  Very traditional.
