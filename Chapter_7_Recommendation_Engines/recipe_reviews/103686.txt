I wish I could say that my chicken was fabulous like the other reviewer (Chad), but it wasn't.  In the other review, it was stated that cooking spray was used instead of oil and the butter was reduced.  I did the same thing, and I had almost NO flavor.  That was obviously not the recipe submitter's fault, and so my rating is not based on that.  The part of the problem, for me, that caused the three star rating is that I think the breading process is missing the flour step.  I did the best I could to get the chicken coated, but the egg didn't want to cling to the chicken, and therefore, the breadcrumbs didn't cling either.  As a result, I only used about half the breadcrumbs. Since that's where the spices were, only half the spices actually got used, which is probably another reason why my chicken was bland.  I also had parts where the egg did stick, but the breadcrumbs fell off, leaving cooked egg on the outside of the chicken.  So, I wound up with a thin, somewhat patchy crust and not much in the way of flavor.  The recipe submitter says you can tailor the spices to suit your individual tastes, and I guess that's really what should be done here.  Also, if I do try this one again, I'll definitely coat the chicken with flour before it goes into the egg.

Though it is easy to make there are flaws in the breading makeing the chicken bland. After making several changes I was able to spruce it up.  I would recommend dipping in lemon juice fallowed buy flower then egg before the breading. As a result the breading and spices stick better and the lemon juice makes a much needed flavor improvement as well using powered parm instead of shredded.

Juicy and very very good. I used a lemon rosemary breadcrumb mix because that's what I had, and upped it a bit.  I also used 2 tsp of lemon juice that I mixed with the egg.   To make it healthier, I used Pam instead of oil and I used less butter, about 2 tsp.  I used chicken tenderloins, so it needed about 5-10 more minutes of cooking time, but the result was fabulous!

i made a few modifications that made this dish come out very well!

first, i marinated the b/s chicken breasts in freshly squeezed lemon juice for a few hours in the fridge.

i used plain breadcrumbs, but simply added in italian seasoning.  

i also dipped the chicken breasts in flour first, then egg, then the breadcrumb mix.

then i quickly pan fried them in some vegetable oil first for a few minutes and then finished them off in the oven, without the butter.

it was really flavorful and moist and juicy!!!!

Yum, this is a wonderful recipe. I used lemon pepper seasoning (without salt in it) and also added some red pepper flakes. Did as others suggested and dipped the chicken in flour then egg then breading and got a nice thick crispy crust on the chicken. Thanks so much for the quick, easy and delicious recipe:)

I thought this recipe was wonderful.  I actually did not have lemon herb seasoning in my pantry, so I ended up adding lemon zest to the breading mixture, and it turned out just great.  My husband gave it two thumbs up.

It wasn't bad, but I don't know that I would call it lemon pepper chicken. It tasted more like plain chicken permesan.

I love this site, I use it all the time. I would only use the "high" rating recipes. Much less post my thoughts about recipes. This recipe is fabulous!!!!  I dredge the chicken in plain flour before the milk to make the egg stick better. Melted the butter and sauteed onion to carefully spoon on the chicken. Thank you so much for this recipe.

I really liked this recipe. I did make one little change though. I marinated the chicken in 3 tablespoons of lemon and 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar...it turned out moist and fantastic!

I thought this was excellent. I did as others suggested and dipped the chicken in flower before the egg. I got a very nice crisp on the outside.
