Wish I could give this one six stars! I made one at Thanksgiving '06, since not everyone likes regular pies. My family adored it, and has since requested it several times. It has also made a great dish to take to any gathering with a lot of people, because the regular recipe makes a LOT of servings (like we measure the servings! Just plenty of dessert here!). I've not had anything but positive comments on it. One note - I made it once with a yellow butter cake mix - that made it so rich, it was almost too much. I'd stick with a regular yellow cake mix whenever possible. Easy, tasty and looks fantastic. Thank you so much for sharing this one - it is now a family favorite! (And I am making it again tomorrow for a birthday party! Most requested dessert I've ever had, besides my pecan pie!) Yummy just doesn't cut it for this one! You simply have to try it. If you like pumpkin pie at all in any way, you'll love this one. (And I didn't adjust the recipe at all - most need tweaking - this one is just wonderful as Patty P. wrote it up!) My family thanks you too!  :  )

This was a family hit!  Everyone told me to add this to my list of requested dishes for all family functions.  Too my delight my daughter with no interest in cooking actually dove in and put this together.  If you like pumpkin pie can't go wrong.  I did make an adjustment to recover from my error. I had this recipe confused with another and had melted the butter for the topping.  Just drizzled over the dry topping ingredients and it turned out, also added pecans to please my family.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent!  I love the taste of pumkin but find pumpkin pie boring.  This, however, is excellent!  The filling was perfect, the crunchy topping was a perfect companion to the filling and the crust was great.  I served it warm with real whipped cream that I sweetened only slightly.  Thank you!

I had this recipe once and let someone borrow the original..never got it back!!  Thank you for sharing. I have looked for a long time to find this Pumpkin Pie Cake with the botttom crust and crumbly topping. Being a Southern gal, I also use sweet potato in place of pumpkin. Delicious!

This is the most amazing stuff....when I made it I burned my mouth because I just couldn't wait for it to cool! I ate three pieces and was disappointed that I didn't have room for more...this one is a keeper!!

I read alot of reviews b4 making this recipe. i can't believe it got so many good reviews. For a 29 oz can of pumpkin, 1/2 cup of sugar was no way sweet enough for the filling..I had to add 1 cup of sugar and 13 cup of Stevia to get it sweet enough. There was also not enough evaporated milk for the ammt of pumpkin..I added the whole 12 oz can. I also had to add 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice to make the flavor better. The crust, after taking out 1 cup for the topping had way too much butter in it. I would have used 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup and it would have been plenty. The topping was a nice addition to the recipe. I added coconut and almonds to it and it was really good. It turned out great with my tweeks..but the recipe as written wasn't good.

This was fantastic!  I added pecans to the topping- about 3/4 C. That was the only change I made.  We had it with cinnamon ice cream while it was still warm--yummy!! Some said it was the best dessert they ever had!Definitely easy too!

A woman at my church made this last week for a potluck, and oh my stars . . . my friend and I could not stop raving about it!  She emailed me the link to the recipe in an email that stated "this should be called Pumpkin Heaven!"  So true!  This is a rich and yummy dessert -- autumn on a plate!  Can't wait to make it myself!

I was looking for a good recipe using pumpkin and this is what I found.  My husband and son loved it.  We took some right out of the oven over to the neighbors house. They also loved it.  The middle has the consistancy of pumpkin pie, and the crust is like a slightly crunchy cake. I added some chopped walnuts to the top. I may add nuts to the crust too next time for added crunch. I also added some nutmeg and ginger to the filling.  I used butter instead of margarine. I cut back on both sugars and it was still plenty sweet enough. We had it with vanilla ice cream...it took some of the sting out of losing to the Yankee's last night...

This was fantastic.  The only change I will make next time is to use 2 eggs instead of 3.  I could taste the eggs, which I didn't like.  It was a huge hit.

I was overall disappointed with this recipe.  I felt the brown sugar overwhelmed every other flavor, including the pumpkin.  This was good for a non-chocolate dessert choice, but won't be a requested family favorite.

Was ok...nothing to write home about.  I did add some walnuts on the top, and put 1/2 t. pumpkin pie spice in the filling.  Was hoping for a little more pizazz out of it.  Will keep looking

Very good.  Used whipped topping with it as suggested in the comments, but it's so sweet it wasn't necessary.  Definitely doesn't have a cake texture, but tastes so much like pumpkin pie!  Little soggy the next day, but otherwise delicious!

This was awesome!  I only added a couple of shakes of nutmeg and cloves, but it would've been fine without additional spices.  I will look forward to this every Thanksgiving from now on!

I had this recipe for the first time when a friend brought it to our home for Thanksgiving.  I made this recipe for the first time for Christmas with my brother's family.  The whole family really liked it and wanted 2nds.  The one problem I had was knowing when it was done.  I baked it 10 minutes longer than the recipe said.  This is a different type of recipe so would have helped to have something to give a visual clue to when it is done baking.

This is a delicious dessert!  I had to make it gluten free for my family, so I used a gf cake mix but all of the rest of the ingredients were ok to use as the recipe was written.    Yes, I will make this again.

This recipe has been in our family for years. I was glad to see it on here. My boys are not too keen on pie crust, so they love it when I make this for Thanksgiving because all there is usually for desserts is pie. We like it warm with whipped cream. Yummy!
