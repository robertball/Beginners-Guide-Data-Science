Since I had a sirloin tip roast that certainly wouldn't need 22 hours in the slow cooker, I only cooked it about 7-1/2 hours and it was done perfectly. I set the roast on a bed of cremini mushrooms, used beefy onion soup mix, since that's what I had in the pantry, only 2 T. of soy sauce to avoid this being too salty, a bay leaf, and just a mere cup of water. The house smelled wonderful and the roast was delicious and flavorful with a rich au jus. We're looking forward to having the leftovers as French Dip sandwiches!

This was really good.  I made a few changes though.  I used low sodium soy sauce and dry onion mushroom soup mix and it was not salty at all.  The beef does not need to be in the slow cook for 22 hours.  That is way too long.  I put mine on high in the slow cooker and it was done in about 4-5 hours and was really tender and juicy.

My husband made this, so you know it is darn easy!  Cooked on low 8 hours the first day, put in the fridge overnight, lifted off the fat in the morning (my trick!) and then put it back on low for 8 more hours with quartered red potatoes, carrots and onions added in.  Very juicy and flavorful.  We always use low sodium soy.

Put a 3lb roast in at 7am, put in carrots and potatoes at 1pm, and ate at 6pm. It was perfect! Used low sodium soy. Will do this often.

Thanks so much for this recipe, Tracy!  I had my in-laws over for this the first time I made it.  It was the best roast we've ever had.  What "made" the roast was the juice it simmers in and it makes the absolute BEST gravy for hot roast beef sandwiches the next day. I used about 4 large tbsp. of corn strach mixed with water to give the juice it's gravy consistency before serving. You can't find better tasting rost beef gravy than this at any restaurant!!  I will make this time and time again.  Very impressive.  Who would know it is SOOOO easy?

This did not take 22 hours, it took about 8 on low. It was very tender.  I used low sodium soy sauce and a can of low sodium beef broth with a cup of water.  I added a bay leaf and fresh portabella mushrooms.  It smelled great and tasted even better. Very simple!

Fantastic! The beef was sooo soft and delicious! It just took 12 hours in my Rival oval slow cooker. 

I will definitely try this recipe again but with modifications. My roast was way too salty for me, so I'm going to try to cut back on the onion soup mix and soy sauce. 

I added 1 1/2 to 2 cups more water to make the juice less salty. To thicken it, I added instant mashed potatoes.

This was great. So simple to prepare. I added some freshly crushed garlic and used low sodium soy sauce. I served this to a family of picky eaters and there were no leftovers! It was falling apart tender and had perfect texture, not mushy at all. Like others, I didn't cook this on low for the full 22 hours. I cooked it on high for 6 hours then turned it to low for the last 2. Thanks! This was a hit.

This was one of the best pot roasts I have ever eaten.  The salt content is perfect, it is juicy, flavorful, and tender.  I added some cornstarch to thicken the remaining juices for gravy and it was a perfect dinner.  There is nothing better than a fix it and forget it dinner and this qualifies.  Only change I would make is next time I will add some carrots and potatoes in the morning before going to work.

22 hours is unnecessarily long - 8 hours on low is plenty. I used a 4.5lb eye round roast (which is the leanest cut of beef) and added 1 (1lb) bag of baby carrots and 2 (16oz) cans of white potatoes at the beginning. After 8 hours I removed everything form the crockpot except the liquid, mixed about 1/3 cup cornstarch with a cold water in a side bowl and added it to the cooking liquid for an incredible gravy. I then returned all the ingredients to the crockpot and set it to warm until we were ready to eat. It turned out to be one of the best stews I've ever had.

I thought this roast turned out delicious!  My husband said it was the best I've ever made.  I only cooked it for about 16 hours.  I also added potatoes, onions, and carrots for the last 8 hours.  Tasted great and made great gravy!

I recommend a cup of red wine in place of the soy sauce, for a variation.  I also recommend a good bock beer or a stout to drink with it, and red cabbage as a side.

Very tender and juicy! I would definitely put it in the fridge overnight and take out the solidified sat in the morning. There is a lot to remove! Put mushrooms, onions and carrots in the crockpot. Made mashed potatoes, too. I left it for 4 hours on high and 2 hours on low for a 2.5 pound roast.

This roast beef was exceptional!  I did the full 22 hours and it turned out perfect.  My husband, who is not a fan of roast even commented on how good it was.  I will definitely make it again.

I can just see someone ruining a perfectly good roast and turning it into beef jerky by following this recipe and the 22 hours in the slow cooker.

Wow the meat was sooooooo tender.  Wake up in the morning and have this wonderful beef smell through out the house.  My family loved it.  While the receipe calls for 22 hours to cook, mine was done in 14 hours.  Cathy Helms

I cook this roast approximately once a month with potatoes and carrots. The only reason I'm giving once star is that it only takes 6 hours on low.

Best slow cooker roast I've ever made.  Like others, used Tamari soy sauce, so it wasn't too salty.  Make sure you use a CHEAP cut of meat, if you use a good cut, it will definitely turn out dry.  The gravy is excellent as well.  My husband and guests just loved it.

Wow!  I was amazed at how easy this was!  
I did not leave it in the crock pot for 22 hours.  Rather, I took the advice from another reviewer and started the roast at 7 or 8 am, add some carrots and potatoes at 1pm, and it was perfect to eat by 6pm!  It was absolutely delicious!  I used beefy onion soup mix and regular soy sauce.  I didn't have any low sodium as others have suggested, but we didn't find it too salty.  I also forgot to add the pepper (oops).  Great recipe!!!

Instead of soy sauce I use a can of cream of mushroom, makes a tasty thick gravy without so much sodium.

My husband could not get enough of this!  It really is wonderful.  I was concerned about the long cook time, but everything turned out perfect; moist and tender and melt in your mouth.  Since it just the 2 of us, we had plenty of leftovers and it made lunches/dinners super easy the next couple of days.  I saved the liquid and froze it in reusable containers.  I thaw it and use it to make quick French dip sandwiches, heating up deli roast beef slices and a sliced onion until everything is tender and hot, then serve it on a crusty baguette. The cooking liquid is delicious for dipping.

Can't go wrong with this one, just don't cook it for 22 hours! Mine was in for 8 hours on low but I think it was probably ready after 6 hours. I followed the recipe but added oregano, bay leaves, potatoes, carrots, and a splash of red wine. Was very tasty and tender! If you can make enough to have leftovers, I think I even prefer this meal the next day! So delicious.... I'm eating some now ;) Thanks for such an EASY beef recipe.

Made this precisely as is, even though I had my doubts about the 22 hours like most people say. I can't stand it when people write a review for something they haven't even tried...anyway...

This was OK as is, a bit too dry, of course because of the cooking time but nothing the resulting gravy mix could not fix (made with 2tsp cornstarch in water - was great).

Here is what I will do different next time, now that I have tried the baseline recipe:
1. Cook for 10 hours max
2. Add in a bit of red wine in addition to the water and the soy sauce (easy, since you just need to leave the last 1/2 inch of the roast uncovered)
3. If I have time, will sear the sides before putting it in the crock pot
4. Will pepper all sides before putting in the roast (wasn't enough to just put it on the top)

This had a great taste, fell apart (no cutting this baby) and I guess these changes will make it a 5.

This was very good.  My family loved it. the juice was perfect for gravy.  I made this a second time but after cooking it, I removed the meat from the juice, shredded I (put juice in container & froze for gravy/soup base later use). I returned to crock pot and added the Bourbon Wiskey BBQ Sause (recipe from this site) for BBQ beef sandwiches served with fries. Everyone thought it was great. My husband & son both had four sandwiches each.  Big hit.

I followed the recipe using Lo Sodium Soy but did NOT cook it for 22 hours. I cannot even imagine what the texture would have been if I had let it cook that long. 8 hours and it was fork tender. The rating is 4 becuase I am afraid of what it would be like if the 22 hours was followed.

I put this in yesterday at 10am and it was all falling apart about after 9 hours.  I put it in the fridge and then tonight I broke off all the fat and put the meat and the juice in a pan and heated it for about 20 minutes and it made great French Dip sandwiches.  The juice was a little salty but very good tasting.  The reason for only 4 stars, 22 hours would be WAY too long.  Be aware!

I seared the meat prior to placing it in the slow cooker and I added 3 cloves of pressed garlic to the broth.  It was fork tender in about 7 hours.  I used the juices to make a gravy and the family loved it.  It was as simple as could be and I didn't find it too salty at all.  this one is definitely going in my recipe box for those days when I don't want to mess around in the kitchen.

Oh my word - the BEST pot roast ever! I didn't have a package of dry onion soup but used a box of beef broth and some spices I had on hand, but the HUGE secret to making this a success is definitely the Soy Sauce.  It was delicious!

I was skeptical but made it for my family of picky eaters today.  I read the reviews and added a clove of crushed garlic and extra water.  I started it about 6:15 am and we ate about 6:15 pm.  It was delicious!  I've never had a pot roast as good as this.  I just added flour to make gravy, but think next time I will add a little red wine after I've removed the beef.  My daughter, who hates almost everything, even loved this!  I may never use another pot roast recipe again!!!

Excellent recipe! Definitely be sure you know the power and cooking capability of your slow-cooker, however. I left mine in for 7 hours, and it was very tender, falling apart on the fork, but still just a bit overdone and dry inside. Will probably be fine at 5.5 hours the next time I make it. I added a dash of Zinfandel wine and used low sodium soy sauce. DELICIOUS!

MMMMMMMM! this is delicious! I added two cloves of minced garlic a bit more pepper. I used 1 onion soup packet and half cup of soy sauce. Later i added corn starch to thicken it up and make gravy.

i would only state that this doesn't need 22 hours. 8-10 worked fine. I have cooked it that long, and you need to leave 1/2" exposed so it doesn't turn into mush. But otherwise, a fantastic meal.

This was AMAZING...I used 6 lbs of meat, (and used reduced sodium soy sauce) doubled everything else, and used a 12 oz beer instead of water. I put the roast on at midnight, and at 11 a.m. I added carrots, an onion, 2 parsnips, and some chopped potatoes. Everyone LOVED it!!!! I turned the meat off about 4 p.m., but I think it could have been done a little bit earlier. And I'd defintely put more veggies in next time. They added a perfect touch! This is one of the best slow cooker recipes I have ever found on here...try it!

This is a great keeper recipe.  Did not go an entire 22 hours, more lilke 12-14.  The soy sauce cuts the onion soup-y  taste and tenderizes too.

Fabulous!  So quick and easy, so delicious!  I agree with the others, cooking time is way off.  I cooked my 3lb roast for 7 hours on low.  My kids don't do leftovers...except for this one.  They were asking for more the next night.  Yummy with egg noodles.  Thanks!

This was recipe was out of this world. I didnt need to keep it in the crock pot all the suggested hours. I did it for about 10 and it was delicious. There was nothing left! My family loved it! I loved it so much i gave the recipe to a friend of mine and her husband went and bought another for her to make the next day!!!

I made this recipe and we ate on it for 3 meals then I had just a little of the juice and meat leftover. I threw the leftovers in a pot, added onions, celery, beef broth, basil, oregano, and some pepper and let simmer. I then added carrots, corn, peas, and some diced yellow squash and let it all coook down. Added in my beef and some noodles and voila! I had some vegetable beef soup!

Not terrible, not great. I didn't cook for 22 hours, only 10...made as directed and it wasn't too salty. It was moist, just kind of flavorless. Have had better roasts. Will say that it was terribly easy to make..but I had a ton of leftovers, and I usually have no leftovers when I make a roast...so probably won't make it again.

This was great. We only had a 2 LB. chuck roast but it still worked out. It only took 8 hours for the size we had. We also added worshtersire(not spelled correctly)sauce as well as the soy sauce, 1/4 of the onion soup mix package.I served it with noodles and made gravy out of the juice. Everyone loved it except for or 20 month old. Next time I will serve it with mashed potatoes. The reviews were really helpful in helping me decide on this recipe.

I was worried about the long cooking time, however this turned out perfect. I will always allow that long cook time in the future. Everyone loved this. I made all kind of changes though so Im not really reviewing recipe so much as cooking method. Fabulous if you have the time. Must try!!!

Fabulous! I used a more tender roast, and cooked it on low for about 5 hours, then on high for another 3. Came out wonderfully tender. I had carrots, onions, and potatoes in with the roast as well, and added about 1/2 a cup of beef broth. At supper time all I had to do was carve and serve (and thicken the gravy, which was wonderful and plentiful). Will make again!

I chose this over the Awesome slow cooker roast beef (which I made many times) because I didn't have the required cream of mushroom soup. I am glad I did end up trying this as I much prefer it to the other recipe. I cooked it all day, let it cool overnight to skim the fat and cooked the entire next day and it was delicious, not too salty and the juices made a gorgeous gravy. Instead of filling the cooker with water I filled it with 1 box of beef broth and the rest water.

Hands down, the tenderest pot roast I have EVER had!

It was literally falling apart as I cut it (with a butter knife!)

In addition - the au jus (which could easily be thickened into a LOT of gravy) was amazing as well...  I will DEFINITELY be making this one again :):)

How can anything this simple be so good?  Served it for a family meal with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli with cheese sauce, even the kids came back for seconds on the meat.  This will be my new "go to" recipe for roast beef from now on.  Thanks!

I made this recipe as written. It was slightly salty for my taste. I will reduce the amount of soy next time I make it. I cooked it on low for 12 hours. This was plenty of time. The roast beef was exceptional and I served it to my mother-in-law who was my guest. She loved it! And so did my husband and I. I can't wait to make this again! Thanks.

Very good.  The meat was so tender it just melted in your mouth.  I used a 2.75lb roast and cooked it for 10 hrs on low and added potatoes for the last 2 hrs so they would still have a runch to them.  It was very, very good and it made excellent sandwiches the next day on a crusty bread w/ swiss cheese.

I have made this recipe 3 times in the last month.  On each occasion, I was entertaining a different catagory of folks....ladies..teenagers...and couples. Everyone has raved about the taste and tenderness of this very easy recipe.  I think 20 hours was probably the perfect timing.

I enjoyed this meal and will definitely make it again.  I had 2 unexpected dinner guests who requested seconds and thirds!  I added mushrooms, carrots and potatoes about 2 hours before serving and some flour to thicken the gravy just before serving.

Unlike most reviewers, I actually made this recipe. I used the exact ingredients and followed the directions and it was perfect. One of the best roast I have ever tasted. It needs to cook for 22 hours to really balance and mellow the flavors. I took a taste test at about 8 hours of cooking and it was too salty, but after the full cooking time it wasn't. Do yourself a favor and try this roast.

I skipped the 1/3 c of soy sauce and used 1/2 c of merlot, added 2 cans of stewed tomatoes and a small onion (sliced) keeping everything else the same.  My family LOVED it!! I will make again.

I finally tried this recipe. I was very leary of making it because of all the comments posted. I have to say that the 22 hour cook time threw me off too. I'm new to slow cooker meals, although I love to cook. I mostly use my crock pot for dips. I always make a new recipe exactly as the recipe states, you can always add your own spin the next time. With that said, I fell into the "change it" category, thinking all of these people can't be wrong. I used low sodium soy sauce & added potatoes, carrots, garlic, ect. I also changed the cook time to 8 hours on low (guess my slow cooker isn't that slow).
With all that said, I wish I had followed the original recipe.. I happen to like saltier food & I think the veggies may have changed the outcome of the recipe. I would still change the cooking time. It did turn out really good, but shame on me for falling into that "change everything category". If you make it, make it the way it is written, is my advice.

I made this yesterday & it was a hit! My husband said it was in his top 3 favorite meals this year. I made it as is...but cooked it on low for 10 hours. Served it shredded on small hoagie rolls with mozzarella cheese on them. Placed them in the broiler for a minute. They were delish!

I made this for our Christmas dinner.  It was delicious. Wonderful roast,  excellent gravy and even enough juice to put away for another time.  I added 3 cloves of garlic.  My family loved it. Saving this recipe

Wouldn't change a thing.  I've never cooked a roast that I didn't brown first...but this was fantastic.  Reminded me of a good brisket.  I used the leftovers for enchiladas.  Fantastic!  Thanks!!!

Delicious!! And, you can't get any simpler than this for dinner! The 22 hours must be a typo; I'd never cook my meat that long. I had a 3 1/4 lb chuck roast and let it go on LOW for a little over 8 hours. It was soooo tender and moist. It also made loads and loads of gravy, with the help of some corn starch. I'm going to try and shred some tomorrow for lunch and put it on a Kaiser roll. I doubt I could go wrong with this one!

I cooked it for 12 hours on low.  It fell apart.  Didn't need any longer.  I bought a pot roast.  I used 1/3 cup soy and then filled the 1/3 cup half way with worcheshire sauce.  It was very good.

This was the first time I made a slow cooked meal. It was awesome. My husband loved it and so did I and we usually have exteremly different tastes. I did change it a little, I used the same amount of soy sauce but added 1/2 cup of red wine. I put the roast on at 7:30a and added potaotes,carrots, mushrooms, and onions at 1:00p then a little onion pwder, garlic salt , and seasoning salt at 4:30 and ate at 6:00p. Didn't have to cook 22 hrs. and it still fell apart with the cheap roast I bought. We will be keeping this reciepe for sure. Thanks for such a great recipe and I hope everyone enjoys just like we did.

DELICIOUS!  22 hours was too long, it was done in about 14 hours.  My guests were raving about the delicious beef sandwiches. My friends begged to help eat the leftover's the next day (rather than go out to a restaurant), so I  added about 1 cup of  water to the left over's, and cooked a bag of homemade egg noodles....poured the beef and juice over the noodles, and topped with sour cream, stirred it up and .. that made a tasty beef  strogonoff... again, delicious. Both meals I served a corn and bean pickled salad, and hard rolls. YUMM, A Definite KEEPER!! THANKS!  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would give it a 10!!

It turned out awesome - but I knew I wanted veges in it too, so I didn't need to make a side dish to go with it.  I had to sneak a bite for lunch, and I think 12+ hours would have been enough time, but I still let it cook for the full 22 hours (although it seemed no more or less tender with additional cooking, but still very tender).  I added a 1lb onion, about 7 cloves garlic slivered, about 3/4lb baby carrots, 1/2lb snow peas, and about 1-1/2lb of cubed potatoes.  I put the meat in so that it lined the bottom of the crock pot and piled the everything else in on the top (the veges were not in any of the juice at first since they were on top of of the meat, as intended -- I didn't them overcook and allowed me to prepare everything at once).  In the morning, when I had plenty of juice, I stirred it up and let it veges cook in the juice with the meat for the rest of the time.  Perfect.  I suggest adding some vegetables (though I haven't cooked it by the recipe to say that its better without).

This was one of the worse recipes I have ever made.  It was over done - I tried making sandwiches with it the next day and no matter how much mayo and other condiments I put on it could not cover up the dryness of the meat.  It smelled great and easy to make, but it was awful.

This was delicious! Followed the recipe exactly except changed the cooking time. I cooked it on high which requires less cooking time. There was a lot of juice so I added corn starch to it and made a gravy out of it and put it back with the meat. My kids couldn't get enough of it. They finished it up the next day also. It is great with mashed potatoes so you can use the gravy for the potatoes also. This is my go to recipe for roast from now on :)

I have yet to be brave enough to try and cook the beef as long as in the recipe.  10 hours on low has always been perfect and the long line of guests this has been prepared for agree!  Excellent recipe that is cheap and easy to boot!

This turned out sooo tasty!  My husband and I ate it as roast one night, then made french dip sandwiches with the leftovers the next.  Growing up, I never liked roast, but this recipe changed my mind!  It is very flavorful, juicy, & tender.  It's a keeper!

Hate when people rate a recipe even though they changed everything about it. Made exactly as directed and was awesome. Do you need to cook a roast for 22 hours? obviously not. Can you give it a chance? Yup. Was not dry, was incredibly excellent and worked out perfect b/c I wanted something i could start in advance.

Absolutely wonderful! I will definitely make this again. I cooked the roast for 10 hrs on LOW, added carrots half way through & it was perfect. I used 6 TBSP of corn starch mixed with cold water to make the gravy. That was the best gravy I've had in a long time. I served the roast/carrots with mashed potatoes, green beans & corn and fed 6 people, plus had 1 plate leftover for a guest to take home. Thank you for this recipe!

I have been cooking pot roasts for years just about every way imaginable with all different kinds of ingredients.  I almost didn't try this because it's SO EASY...how could one ingredient (has to be the soy sauce...I've done pot roast with soup mix before) make such a difference?  Well all, this was the most flavorful, the most delicious pot roast I've made in a long, long time and I doubt I'll ever make it any other way again.  This satisfied all my requirements -- easy, delicious and melt in your mouth tender.  I used a 3+ pound chuck roast.  I followed the recipe exactly (except for the cooking time).  I mixed the soy sauce and 1 package of Beefy Onion soup mix together in the measuring cup (easier than doing it in the slow cooker) and poured it in.  Then placed the roast on top of it and added fresh ground pepper on top.  Then poured in some water until just the top of the roast was uncovered.  Set it for 6 hours on high and went and ran some errands.  When I came back about 4 hours later, I turned it to low and let it go for about another 2 hours and the last hour turned it to high again.  So, it was a total of close to 8 hours I believe.  I don't know if the "22 hours" was a typo...maybe 12 hours?...there is no way it has to be even close to 22 hours.   All I know is that the 8 hours I had it cooking was perfect.  Was fall apart tender.  I let it sit for about 20 min. before cutting and serving.  Was so, so, SO good!!!!  We didn't find it salty in the least.

Wow this had great flavor.  Next time I make this I will only use 1 tsp pepper as it was a bit peppery for the kids.  I cooked for 7 hours the 1st day, put the crock in the fridge overnight, spooned the fat out in the morning and added carrots and cooked another 7 hours.  So easy and delicious. For some reason the carrots were outstanding- maybe a bit salty but still great.  If I had low sodium soy sauce I would use that next time but wouldn't buy it specifically for this- regular is fine.

I used a 3 lb. chuck roast (a rather tough cut of meat) for this recipe. I used gluten free low sodium soy sauce and followed the rest of the recipe. I slow cooked it for 8 hours. The meat was so tender it practically fell off the bone!

This is a great roast recipe. Though rather than using a slow cooker I used an oven and cooked it at 250 for nine hours. It came out perfect.

This was just OK. I didn't need to cook it for 22 hours -- I think it would have been soup if I had! It was very, very salty, and I like salt.

I followed the suggestion of some other commenters and used beefy onion soup mix and only 2 T low sodium soy sauce. It was not too salty at all. I also added carrots, onions, and red potatoes. Cooked on low for about 7 hours.

This was a very tasty dish!  I did alter it just a tad.  I only used 1/4 cup of soy sauce and instead of adding water I used beef broth!  I cooked on low for 10 hours with carrots, potatoes, and celery.  The last 1/2 hour I thickened the liquid with cornstarch!

I've made this several times now and love it.  I take my roast out about 30 minutes before serving and let it rest while I add about 1 tbsp of cornstarch dissolved in the juice.  After about 10 minutes, I slice up or tear up the meat and put it back in.  20 minutes later, it's perfect.  I mix it all with some egg noodles and serve.  AWESOME!

At first I was a little leary about this recipe. I thought soya sauce and onion soup mix and thats it?? Then the cooking time also. But I took the plunge anyways. My husband is having a potluck lunch at his work today so I decided to make this. I have not been feeling to well this past few days so this was nice and easy. Put it on yesterday morning at about 10am, and took it out this morning at 7am and shredded it. 
Well OMG this is like pure heaven!!!! I told my hubby to come here and gave him a bit and he was salvitating over it lol. He LOVED it. We even tried a small piece last night and our 2 year old boy...who is VERY picky by the way wanted a bite and he loved it. He got mad when he couldn't have more lol. So I am sure he will be happy when he sees mama saved him a little bit :D
This was definately added under my favorites section and as soon as I get my printer fixed I will be printing it off and putting it in with my absolute favorite recipes.
I doubled the meat so I also doubled the onion soup mix and soya sauce.
Thanks so much for the awesome recipe, and this will definately be made again here!! Can't wait to see what my hubbys co-workers think of it!!

I would give this 5 stars but as written it is just too salty. Made with just 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and the onion soup mix it is much less salty. It only took 8-9 hours on low (overnight) to cook so I think 22 hours is too much. I made one roast for my Dad and he was still talking about it a week later. Cut back the salt at least by half and check it half way thru cooking. I was afraid to let it keep cooking after it was falling apart after 8hours. I didn't want to waste money if it got overdone.

Really good.  I used the red wine instead of soy sauce but think I will try with half the soy sauce instead next time.  Also, I cooked a 2 lb roast for about 10 hours and that was a little too long. Edit - I just changed from 4 to 5 stars the second time I made this.  I used a 3 lb roast and cooked for 8 hours used both 1/3 cup soy sauce and 1/3 cup wine.  Outstanding!

How can something so easy be soooo good?!!  I only needed to cook it for 10 hours.  It was so tender that I couldn't slice it.  It just fell apart.  The next day I took the leftover roast and gravy and mixed it with cooked No yolks noodles and it made another great meal!  No more dry boring roasts in this house!  Thanks

Okay if I knew it was this easy to make a roast that came out this tender.......I would've never done it the old way!!! Two thumbs up! Mine wasn't too salty at all. I used Tamari soy sauce. Will make it again!

I was very impressed with the taste of this beef.  The soy sauce gave the roast an unbelievable taste and it was just a great dish.  However, next time, I think I will go little easier on the soy sauce though.

Great dish!

This recipe is really excellent.  I started it one evening after our supper and the next day I didn't have to worry about getting supper ready.  It was already cooking away.  I added a cup of beef broth to the ingredients.  About an hour before it was finished I added some cornstarch to thicken.  I had so much broth left, which was absolutely delicious, the next day I heated it and added whatever vegetables I had on hand along with a little bit of the meat and made a beef barley vegetable soup. Yum!!!  This is definitely a keeper.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe.  I thought 22 hours was a little odd, however, it just kept getting more tender and juicy.  It was ready in about 8 hours, but it was even better at 22 hours.

Have made this a few times now and it is amazing! I'll even shred it up after cooking and make French dip sandwiches with it. I only cooked it for 9 hours on low though.

not sure about this one, seems like it is a slow boil recipe with all that water. Cooked meat (top round roast) for 15 hours on slow before i pulled it. Sort  of tender, but mostly dry and flaky. It also reduced down in half from 54 ounces to 27 and i only left a half inch fat cap on top when it went in. Broth might have potential for gravy or beef soup.

I was afraid with the soy sauce and soup mix the roast might be too salty but it wasn't.  The kids thought this was the best roast they've had.

This was delicious.  I used low sodium soy sauce and half what the recipe required.  I also added 2/3 cup water.  Cooked it on low for 11 hours, turned out delicious.  We ate it with mashed potatoes and broccoli.   We will definitely make this one again.

I made this recipe exactly as printed, except I only had it in the crockpot for 10 hours and it was extremely tender.  We liked it, but thought it was lacking flavor.  I used regular soy sauce and thought it actually needed more salt.  Next time, I would season the meat before putting it in the crock pot.  Still, a delicious easy meal.

So simple yet so good!  My roast was only about 2 pounds, so I cooked for about 4 1/2 hours on low.  I used reduced-sodium soy sauce and found it to be perfect, not too salty at all!  We sort of shredded/chunked up the beef and served on soft kaiser rolls with horseradish sauce and provolone.

if too salty for you also check the sodium content in the onion soup mix.  Soy sauce may not be the only culprit!

I loved this recipe!  It was so easy to prep and I just cooked it on low for about 11.5 hours and it was delicious!  The meat fell apart and the sauce tasted like au jus so I used flour to make a different batch for the gravy.  Thank you for sharing!

I really wanted to love this, but I can only give it 3 stars because, personally, I found it too salty — I used low-sodium soy sauce and I even like my salt, so I was surprised at how salty this tasted to me. Because it was so easy to make, I will definitely try it again, but I'll probably cut the soy sauce down (and add some beef broth).

This was delicious! I did a smaller roast though, so I should've toned down some of the spices more than I did, but over all delicious! I did 1.25 pound roast and cooked it for a little over 10 hours and it was perfect. It just fell apart when slicing it. :)

Simple and delicious!  When I went to make this at the last minute before leaving for the day, I realized I did not have soy sauce, so I subbed worcestershire sauce and it was still very tasty.  I put my roast in frozen and cooked on low for 10 hours and it was perfect.  I thickened the juice to make gravy and it was very good.

The first time I made this, I thought 22 hours was way too long.  I ended up having to work a 16 hour shift, therefore I had to let it set for 22 hours.  I am so glad I did, because this recipe was fall apart, juicy, and too die for.  Thank you for a great recipe, just what I was looking for!

Quick, easy, good. I only cooked 8 hours on low with onions, carrots, celery and potatoes and it turned out great. There was way too much fat, though, so if I made it again I might try what the one reviewer did; cook the meat and refrigerate and remove the fat the next day before adding veggies.

This was good.  It did not need anywhere near 22 hours - ours only needed about 8.  A nice quick recipe that you can throw together in the morning when you don't have a lot of time.  No chopping or prep work.

I used the recommendations of others and used 1/2 package of onion soup mix,  low-sodium soy sauce and cooked it for only 6 hours.  It was excellent. I will make this again.

I added just a little bit of Worcestershire sauce since I had a little less soy sauce then the recipe called for.  I also cooked it on high and cut the cook time to between 6-7 hours.  When the meat started flaking apart I added quartered red potatoes.  Not only did my boyfriend and I love it, it made the house smell wonderful and my Grandmother also ate every bit that I took her!

I would have given this a 5, but as written cooking time is too long. I actually tried it after 8 hours and it was perfect, I left in for longer and it made it kind of dry. It was still good at that point, but I think it was best after 8 hours. Also I took peoples advice on the soy sauce and split it with worchestshire sauce, that was good. It was super easy, cooking it less time than prescribed makes it a 5!

Looked for an alternative to using cream of mushroom sauce and this one was a hit!  I had a 2.5 lb roast and put it in the crockpot for 5 1/2 hours on high.  It was so incredible tender and the sauce made such fabulous gravy when thickened.  No need to make pot roast any other way.  Thanks!!!

This was the best roast I've ever made!  I followed the recipe except halfed the soy sauce so that it wouldn't be too salty then replaced that half with worcestershire sauce.  So basically instead of 1/3 cup of soy sauce, 1/6th soy sauce and 1/6th worcestershire.  Like other reviewers mention, it doesn't take the whole 22 hours.  I put it in the slow cooker at 7:30am and it was done by the time I got home from work at 5:30pm.  So 10 hours was fine for 3-3.5 lbs of meat.  Thanks so much. I will use this recipe every time as my family loved it... not to mention so incredibly easy.

This was my first attempt at a beef roast and it couldn't have been easier. I've always been afraid of making a roast because my mother used to dry them out, but this was moist and tender. My fiancee came home and saw the roast, the gravy, and the mashed potatoes I'd made and said "Wow....real dinner!" I guess from the original meat and potatoes man, it's the highest compliment he can give.

This was WAY too salty. Meat was tender, but the combination of soy sauce AND dry onion soup mix should be a red flag to anyone. Use low salt soy sauce and onion soup mix if you use this recipe.

while the meat was amazingly tender it was also very salty.  Verging on inediblly salty.  I think next time I will sub low sodium soy sauce and perhaps dried onion with low salt boullion.  It definitely has potential

This is the perfect roast beef recipe.  Easy as can be - fix it the night before and forget about it till you're ready to eat the next day!  Everyone I've ever made this for loves it, and DH wants this once a week.  The only thing I do differently from the recipe is sear the beef on all sides before putting it in the crock pot for a nice color.  While the beef is resting I strain the juice and make a gravy that is just perfect for the meat.  This is my standby roast beef recipe and a staple in our house.

This was absolutely the best roast beef that I have ever made.  It is so tender, and the gravy is wonderful.  My husband, who does not like roast much, loved it too.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe.

This was great.  I started it last night and woke up this morning to find the smell of yummy roast filling the kitchen.  It didn't take 22 hours for me, more like 12.  Perhaps my slow cooker isn't so slow.

I have made lots of roast beast in the slow cooker over the yrs. First, I would never cook anything that requires 22 hours, Secondly , unless ur cooking roadkill beef dried out in the desert. again it wouldn't take 22 hrs even on low. Lastly, I'm not big on soy sauce; as a reviewer said above, it'll be saltier  than the Dead Sea....
   Therefore,  I figger this must be a typo.  As another reviewer said ..7 and a half hrs tops....so try again, I don't think we're wanting to tan leather here. Have ed. review this one, needs to  be changed in several ways : time and ingredients...God Bless....

Overall very tasty dish and simple to make.  I am subtracting a star because of the confusion over cook time: 8 hours on high turned my meat into a brick.  My husband still loved it and the flavors were good, so I think I'll try this again with a way shorter cook time.  I think the ease and potential still makes this recipe a winner.

Great recipe but I added 1 cup of beef broth and  1 tablespoon of Worcestershire along with some garlic powder and complete seasoning. I also added 3 red potatoes, mushrooms, and half of an onion. The flavor was awesome. Added a roll and some provolone cheese and  made sandwiches with it the next day. 22 hours would have been way too long.  Cooked it on high for two hours and then left it on low for another four hours and it was perfect!

So easy.  Low sodium soy sauce is the trick.   Use Chip and Dip seasoning (Penzy) in place of onion soup to avoid MSG.  Making gravy wth corn sauce and drippings is super easy and delish.  Start at 10 a.m., put on low in slow cooker, done at 6:00 p.m.  Great for weekend when you are out having fun all day and come home starving but too exhausted to cook.  Microwave some peas, butter some bread and dig into the roast.  The perfect ending to a great day out.

This was awesome! I changed it, JUST slightly:
Still added in the onion soup mix, soy sauce and pepper. Also added a can of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom w/Roasted Garlic soup as well as some slices of dried garlic. Instead of water, I used beef broth - this was done easily in 11 hours, probably before then but I wasn't home to check! Will make this again and again - juice is perfect for making gravy with. 
I make gravy by taking the juice and adding it to a HOT saucepan, and bringing to a gentle boil. I then mix 3/4 warm water with 6 tablespoons of flour, and pour about 1/2 of that mix into the juice after it boils, mixing completely. I add more of the water/flour mix if it tastes like it needs it. Totally awesome!!

6 hours on high and it turned out perfect. I transferred the drippings to a saucepan, added about 1.5 cups water and some flour for a yummy gravy.  Easy and delicious, Thanks!

This is a great basic recipe, with some modifications. First of all, it does not need 22 hours to cook. Second of all, you don't need all that soy sauce. I actually used 1/4 cup of soy sauce and worstershire sauce (because I did't have enough soy sauce). I also used mushroom onion soup mix instead. I set it on low at 8 AM, honey came home at 2 PM and added mushrooms, carrots and potatoes. We were eating by 4 PM. My family enjoyed it immensely. It was delicious!

Those who said 7 hours are enough are right! Trust these reviews! We're Jewish and observant and Friday night dinner is the week's highlight. AND we don't cook ANYTHING after sundown, so everything has to be done before. To have a bunch of steak eaters rave and do back flips over something that be set up the night before and turned on in the morning and be done EXACTLY at dinner time ... THANKS for this one! (PS add veggies and maybe a dash of Worcestershire sauce ...)

I was a little weary about this recipe, as I do not usually use packages such as soup mixes in my meals. Also my boyfriend assured me that he doesn't like the flavour of onion soup. Well, I couldn't get him away from the leftovers after dinner! He was trying to have 3rds! I had to shoo him away so I could save some for dinner tomorrow! It was really yummy! Used a 2lb lean cut, cooked on high for 6-7 hours, was perfect! I used low-sodium soy sauce. Took a portion of the juices to make a gravy in a pan with some corn starch and froze the rest of the liquid to use as a broth in a future recipe. We had garlic mashed potatoes and corn as sides. Can't wait for left overs! Thanks for sharing! :)

After dinner last night my boyfriend called this "The best roast beef" while talking to his buddy. Then he kept stealing my leftovers while I was trying to eat them this morning for breakfast. We'll definitely be having this again.
I did use a rump roast instead of chuck, and low sodium soy sauce. I cooked it on low for about 10 hours and it was deliciously fall-apart tender. We didn't find it too salty at all, probably because of the low sodium soy.
The au jus this made was phenomenal and made gravy that was just as good.

Loved it!  Everyone gobbled it up and I served it with mash potatoes and a veggie side.  I would use low sodium soy sauce next time, it was just a tad too salty for me!

This recipe works well for venison or wild game roasts as well, since slow-cooking helps to keep them from drying out. We did find the soy sauce addition to be too salty for use in gravy. Topping with Montreal steak seasoning added even more flavor. A big hit for family dinner. MominLaw

Good and easy. Followed other reviewers suggestion to use lite soy. Cooked it for only 10 hrs and it fell apart.

Very good, but 22 hours is a typo. 12 hours on low would be more than enough time for this recipe. Also, use low sodium soy sauce and it won't come out too salty.

I've been using this technique for pork or beef roasts for over 30 years. It is always delicious. You can't go wrong doing this. I use very little water, add more at the end if needed. If you don't have a crock pot, you can do it in half the time in a slow oven.

Really loved this as a meal, although I thought the amount of au jus was excessive and not really thick enough for gravy. We added some mushrooms when we saw there was a lot of liquid to let the flavor soak into the veggie--it was an excellent veggie side!

Good roast. The gravy was heavy on the salt because of the soy and soup mix so I would suggest adding some beef stock or water to thin it out a little.

Easy, very tasty, I would make again. Put on low at 6am, threw the carrots & potatoes in with it at that time, ate at 6pm. The meat was very tender & the veggies were perfect. My husband grabbed some BBQ sauce to dip it in (I thought he was crazy, it was great left alone), but then I tried a bite...YUMMY!

Pretty salty for my taste, but a quick, easy recipe when you're out of ingredients.  I added onions to the slow cooker to bump up the flavor.

Are you kidding me, this meat was soooo moist, literally melted in my mouth.  We had a busy night at our house, the boys ate it after 12 hours, then kept it on low, and the girls ate after 15 hours.  Wonderful!  Will make again and again.

My first attempt at making a roast and the flavor was wonderful!  the suggested cooking time was way too long though. I cooked my roast for about 8 hrs on low in the crock pot and it was a little dry.  I will check the temp at about 6 hrs. Thanks for the great recipe!

I put this on last night before I went to bed. This morning I tasted a piece and let it cook till lunch hoping that it would get better. I made the recipe as stated and added potatos and carrots this morning. Though the meat did fall apart, it failed to deliver any kind of taste other than blah. Had I got it from a buffet I would not have eaten it past the first bite. It was not salty as other reviewers experienced. I will try leftovers tomorrow and make gravy this time. Hopefully it will be better after sitting in the fridge. Otherwise a bottle of BBQ sauce will cover so I don't waste the meat.

This was delicious!  I read the other reviews and only cooked it on low for about 13 hours.  It turned out perfectly. Next time I will add mushrooms, potatoes, onions, and carrots about half-way through!

"This is the BEST!" That's what my husband said - and he was right! Definitely didn't need 22 hours though - we cooked it for about 11 or 12 in the crock pot. Absolutely fantastic. If you somehow managed to have leftovers, it would make a great sandwich.

Really easy, take the beef and cut in half, put in a 6 quart crock pot. I didnt have soy sauce, I had mushroom flavored soy sauce...but I used it. Covered it to withine 1 inch with water, I didnt have onion soup, I had beef onion soup...It was fine! This recipe is so forgiving. I thougth for sure cooking this for 22 hours would be horrible, it wasnt. I put the roast in the night before, when I woke up I added 4 potatoes, peeled and quartered, some carrots. When I got home from work I had the most amazing roast with aus ju sauce. Everyone was so impressed.

VERY GOOD. I USED A HIGH QUALITY BEEF BASE FOR FLAVOR. ALSO INCREASED ALL THE VEGGIES. I USED A RUMP ROAST. RUBBED OLIVE OIL OVER BEEF AND PATTED WITH MCORMIC ROAST RUB.

This beef was very good, though the broth was very salty (and I love salty!).  I put the beef on about 9pm and we ate it around 1:30pm the following day.  It was perfectly tender.  I diluted part of the broth and used it in a cream gravy over mashed potatoes.  I will definitely use this recipe again, but will probably reduce either the soy sauce or seasoning to avoid the saltiness.

I would rate it higher but WOW it was really salty!!  I enjoyed the flavor but not the salt.  Even my husband the salt lover agreed!  If I ever try this again, I will have to use the low sodium soy sauce.

Really easy and really good!  I cooked on high for 4 hrs and then low for 4 hrs and the meat just fell apart.  Next time I will use less pepper though.  Family loved it!

THIS IS IT.  You can stop looking for that fabulous roast recipe.  I cooked it exactly as the recipe called for except that I just cooked it all day.  I forgot to put the pepper on.  I also made a little gravy out of all the extra liquid.  It was fantastic.  The soy sauce is critical.  Kikkoman, of course.  My husband could not stop eating this roast.  Thanks for great recipe.

This turned out very tender!  My roast was frozen and only needed to cook for about 6 hours on high.  It made wonderful french dip sandwiches as left overs.

great flavor, I did add some water a couple of times because it was drying up, a total of 3/4 cup Just do that from the beginning, I also always use low sodium soy,  gravy was excellent over the mashed potatoes. The soy and the french onion soup was a very nice combination==highly recommend!

I am so glad I finally tried this recipe after being leary of using the soy sauce.  I only had 1/4 cup of soy sauce (low sodium) to use, so I poured that in with 1/4 cup of worcestershire sauce.  I used 2 1/2 cups water and let it cook on low for about 9 hours and then added carrots and potatoes and let cook another 3 hours.    It was perfectly seasoned and needed no adjustments.  Super great comfort good on a COLD winter evening.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, I will use this again and again (can't wait for the leftovers at lunch today)!!

The best roast beef I have ever had I served mine over egg noodles. I had to thinken the gravy with a little cornstarch and water. I also used beef broth and water. I will be making this again. Thanks for sharing.

Very easy and very tasty!  Based on other reviews I used low-sodium soy sauce and also added some worcester sauce.  I placed it in the slow cooker on low for 10 hours and the meat was falling off the bone when done.  I also added onion, carrots, and red potatoes with 4 hours to go and thickened the left over juices to make gravy.  I will definitely make this again!

This is great. There was a lot of sauce left so I didn't need all of it.  I just throw away what I don't need.  Then I thicken up the rest w/ cornstartch to make a nice gravy.  I put this in the slow cooker for 5 hours on high and it was moist and delicious.  Thanks!

SCRUMPTIOUS! This was my first time making beef roast. I had a 5 pound one and made it for Christmas. I adjusted the cooking time and ingredients accordingly. It only took about 10-11 hours for it cook. It was so TASTY, TENDER and wonderful, so easy everyone loved it. There was so much broth leftover I used it with the little bit of leftover roast and made a wonderful beef vegetable soup. Thanks

Took other's suggestions and used half the amount of soy and replaced the other half with worcestershire sauce.  Cooked a little over ten hours on low -- EXCELLENT.  Meat fell off the bone -- was a surprisingly good texture (worried if it would be mushy) Was afraid it would taste salty but did not. Definitely a keeper -- good easy way to make a roast.  Thanks!

My husband and I love this non-cream of mushroom soup based slow cooker roast! I buy 4lbs of roast and trim the fat and silver between the muscles (which the meat ends up being about 3lbs). I cover the roast with low sodium beef broth instead of water and used the onion/mushroom dry soup mix. After 8 hrs, I put in 1lb of cut up red potatoes, half a package of baby carrots, 1 8oz package of rinsed baby mushrooms, 1 large cut up onion, 1/2lb cut up parsnips. In 4 more hrs, the meat is tender and the veggies have soaked up the delicious broth. Thanks for the base of a wonderful, yet easy meal!

I've made this at least 4 times in the last two months and every time I make it, it comes out perfect. I follow the recipe exactly except for cooking time. I usually cook it 8-10 hours on low, but one time I forgot to get it started in the morning and ended up only cooking it for 3 hours on high and it was just as fork tender and delicious as all the others. I always use a flat (not more than 2 inches thick) well marbled chuck roast around 2-2.5 pounds. Lots of thanks to Tracey for submitting this recipe.

This was the easiest recipe I have ever made.  I cooked it for 10 hours and 2 hours warming.  Halfway through cooking I added sliced mushrooms and one yellow onion cut in fours.  I added some cornstarch in the end to thicken the sauce.  Very tasty!

This recipe was absolutely WONDERFUL!!  I cooked it exactly as said & my family LOVED it.  Personally, I am not a big salt fan and this was a little on the salty side.  Next time I would use a low sodium soy or less soy & little more water but as is, this recipe is SUPER easy & got SUPER ratings from the family!!  Thank you so much!!

This was fantastic.  I cooked a frozen roast for 22 hours.  Used worestershire sauce instead of soy sauce.  After 12 hours I checked the gravey and thought it a little bland; added 2 tablespoons of A-1 sauce and a can of cream of mushroom soup.  The end result was extremely tender, moist meat and an excellent gravey.  Will make again using the soy sauce.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe!  I did substitute worcestershire sauce for the soy sauce and I cooked it for about 18 hours.  Makes LOTS of yummy gravy and the meat is very tender.  Thanks so much for posting!

Great, easy recipe and I have adopted it to our venison roasts as well. Makes even the cheapest cut extremely tender. Have to watch our salt intake so the soy sauce is replaced with just water or low sodium beef broth. I have even found you can use a cooking bag in the crockpot which helps with cleanup and makes everything super moist. Open the door after a hard day at work and the aroma is wonderful! The king of the manor loves it. Makes a middle of the week dinner easy and Sunday special....

I had a 3 pound roast and was looking for a good recipe that was easy and still had enough juices left after cooking to make gravy.  This was awesome.  The roast was a cheap cut, but very tender after being cooked for about 20 hours.  I decided to add about half a can of beer (just because I was curious) and it added some nice flavour.  The gravy was really good too-I cooked some new potatoes and baby carrots and onions in a casserole in the oven and used about a cup on the juices from the roast to pour over the veggies while they baked.  In the end I decided to make the Quick and easy Yorkshirs pudding recipe as well because I had so much gravy.  I don't do roasts well typically, but this was easy and so good.  And my husband was more than impressed with my culinary talents.

This made a very good roast and it was very easy to make gravy with the sauce.  I cooked my roast on high for approx 8 hours I planned on using the roast for two dinners but it was all eaten on the first night!  Thanks for the recipe

We loved this roast!  I didn't have onion soup mix, so I searched for a substitution and came up with this:  4 beef bouillon cubes, 1/4 c. dehydrated minced onion and 1/2 teaspoon onion powder.  I dissolved the bouillon in a cup of hot water, then added it and the other seasonings to the pot along with the soy sauce.  I think next time I'll use less pepper and just mix it in with the rest of the ingredients before adding the roast.  By sprinkling it on top we had some bites without pepper and some with too much, which the kids didn't like.  I put my roast (a cheap cut) in the crock pot on low before I went to bed and it was ready 12 hours later!  Falling apart tender -- yum!  I pulled it out and added some quartered potatoes to the liquid and cooked them for about 4 hours.  This is a recipe I will definitely use again & again!

This was nothing special.  I took the suggestion of others and added veggies (onions, carrots, potatoes, mushrooms) which helped alot.  I will not be making it again.

This was great!  After letting it cook for about 10 hours overnight, I went to flip the roast over.  When I attempted to lift the roast with a fork, pieces of roast beef went flying everywhere because it was already so tender!  By the time it was done I had to pull the roast out in many small, tender pieces.  Also, I was out of onion soup mix, so I used beefy onion instead -- the roast was fine, but the gravy was VERY beefy tasting.  Next time I'll make sure I have the onion soup on hand!

Tasty recipe but hubby wasn't crazy about it. Only cooked about 12 hours on low and was really surprised that it was on the dry side and a bit bland! (maybe b/c I used low soidium soy sauce?). However I do plan to try again and just doctor it up. (BUT- I saved all the juice and leftover meat and it made an awesome beef barley soup!!)

Everyone loved this! The best roast I've ever made and so easy.  I did add dried parsley and added chopped garlic. Also I only used 1 teaspoon of ground pepper. This one is a keeper!

This recipe is really easy and tastes great.  I'm pleased with how tender the meat turned out, it was a breeze to pull apart for sandwiches.  I cooked the meat on low in the crockpot for 14 hours and that seemed to do the trick.

It snowed so I started this beef in the morning. The whole house smelled so good. By dinner time the roast was ready! So easy and full of flavor. The beef was so tender. It broke apart at the touch of a fork. This recipe is a keeper

An unbelievably great pot roast. I know it says roast beef but it is really a pot roast and the best one I have ever made. Taking the juices in the slow cooker and adding some flour and reducing them for a few minutes gave me the best gravy I have had. Use low sodium soy sauce and there is no over powering salt taste to the dish. Pair with garlic string beans and mash potatoes and you have an amazing meal!

Tasted great! Seasoned and floured 3 lb pot roast and cooked on stove top. Cooked on low 4 hours. Added carrots, potato, onions and mushrooms last 30 minutes.  Used low  sodium soy sauce and beefy onion soup mix. Because I floured the roast before searing it so it made into a creamy gravy as it cooked. Was  absolutely delicious . Not salty at all.

Fantastic, fall apart roast. Potatoes and carrots could be added for a classic pot roast. I cooked this for 6 hours on high in my crock pot and the roast was tender and fell apart. Lots of juices leftover, so I made gravy. I used low sodium soy sauce to decrease the saltiness. Great recipe.

This is by far the best roast beef recipe I've tried and tasted. Stuck to the recipe and it was not too salty to me at all. Be sure to use chuck roast though. And as like many others have stated no way would I cook it for more than 7 hours. My crockpot does tend to get really hot, never had that problem with my old school one, but still learning my way around digital one. I set mine to low and let it cook for 7 hours, liked it so much ate it 3 days in a row......And no I shouldn't have!!!

Excellent recipe. Easy to prep and cleanup. I didn't cook mine for 22 hrs though. I cooked it initially on a high setting then lowered it after it was warmed. A 2.5 pound roast took me 5 hours and was perfect.

My husband asked if we could have this more often because it was so tender and the gravy was awesome! He is not usually fond of the cheaper cuts of meat, so that says a lot! I used the ingredients as listed but only cooked on low for 8 hours. Thickened the gravy with cornstarch and my immersible blender wand.

Lovely  and easy recipe! These slow cooker recipes are not just for cold, frosty days, but for a break from grilled meals all summer long and you don't even heat up the kitchen. What do they say? "Set it and forget it!"

No changes. I have already made this a second time.  You can use the cheaper cuts of meat and it will turn out fork tender, and the broth turns out to be a fantastic gravy.

Skip the sodium in the onion soup and soy sauce. just use dehydrated onion flakes. Used to use the onion soup, one of my standards. Use some of the leftovers or intentional portioning if you live alone or small family for wonderful base for beef barley soup.

This is quite literally the BEST roast I have ever tasted. I used to always make roast on top of potatoes and carrots, and then we'd eat those as a side dish. This roast, however, just cooks by itself for 22 hours and it is so incredibly amazing. Now I make mashed potatoes, and I turn the juices into seriously the most amazing gravy on the planet! Try this at least once! But yes, 22 hours is key. You will not regret it, nor will you ever make any other roast recipe again!

22 hrs is ridiculous! I make this often, but use 1 can cream of mushroom soup mixed with 1 pkg onion soup mix and 2 cups of unsalted beef broth. No soy sauce as the onion soup mix is salty enough, and I sprinkle the roast with pepper and garlic powder. Cook on low for 8 hrs for a 3-4 lb roast. I remove the roast to a plate and cover with foil, then add some cornstarch mixed with a little water to the liquid to thicken it up for gravy to serve on mashed potatoes. Always comes out very tender and delicious! Not sure why 22 hrs is the cooking time, but that it way too long.

Although I do have a crock pot, I wanted to play. Made it in a black cast iron pot with lid, lined with a crock pot liner. Half red wine, half low sodium soy sauce, chopped onions, carrots, celery, and various spices. Put the whole pot in an oven bag and placed it in the hot Florida sun all day. I was tempted to refrigerate it overnight to skim the fat but was impatiently hungry.

Easy, quick, and good! I pulled the roast straight from the freezer to the slow cooker and cooked for 10 hours. I would have liked it just a little more tender, but I think if I had time to thaw it it would have been. I added an onion, chopped carrots, and baby potatoes on top while it cooked and had the entire meal ready when we got home from work! The veggies had a great flavor also.

What? 22 hours? That's not a slow cooker; that's a reluctant cooker. Anyway, I made it using just half the onion soup with low salt soy sauce and cooked my 3.38 lb roast in 7:25.  It was good.

Excellent. Follow recipe to a tee and it was great. Never cooked it take long before and I think that was the problem. It needs all those hours for a tear apart roast !

Will make over and over.  I added a few things so the beef juice was suitable for dipping (aka...beef dip).  I added in 1/2 cup red wine, some worchestershire sauce and also a bay leaf as well as covered the roast with garlic powder and black pepper.  Roasted for about 15 hours. As long as the beef is submerged in the liquid it seems to stay moist.  Cooked from a frozen roast which really great!

Loved it! I made it exactly by the recipe but only cooked it for 8 hours on high. It is fantastic . I now add diced onions and fresh mushrooms. It is great no matter what you add.

This was so easy, and was devoured so quickly.  I have not cooked with beef much, so I didn't know what to expect. I  can tell you one thing, it certainly makes the house smell good when you come home to this recipe.  This is a keeper!

I didn't use a slow cooker on this because I prefer my Dutch oven to a crock pot any day.  Things get done faster and I don't have to use electricity for hours and hours.  The taste was great.  I used a cup of wine and added beef stock for the rest of the liquids.  I also included celery and tossed in potatoes near the end.  IMHO, this recipe calls for too much liquid.  The meat was swimming in it.  It's not stew when it's like that, but soup.  Will freeze the liquid to use for later, but will never make it with so much liquid in the future.

This is amazing.  I did modify it somewhat, which is annoying, I know.  I added the onion soup mix, maybe 1/4 c soy sauce, and 1/4 c red wine.  I didn't use water, but instead used the liquid I'd frozen from the last pot roast I made, but I think broth would work just as well.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours, then low for another 3.  I added carrots in the last couple of hours.  It turned out fantastic.  I thickened the juice and made gravy for mashed potatoes.  Easy and delicious. It was not too salty at all.

It can be eaten after 8 hours. I tasted it after 8 hours and it was good. I cooked it for the full 22 hours before I served it to my family. It fell apart (almost crumbled) after the 22 hours. My husband and son loved it and said they would like for me to make it again. It's a keeper.

I substituted worcestershire sauce for the soy sauce because it sounded salty. Used fresh onions instead of onion soup. Cooked in about 8-9 hours.. threw some carrots, parsnips and potatoes in at about hour 5. I think 22 hours would have given me mush. But yum!

I make a delicious and VERY easy slow cooker beef roast using just a 3 to 4 lb. boneless rump roast with a packet of au jus mix, a packet of Italian dressing mix (both put in dry) and a 12-oz can of beer. It is so simple and cooks in 6 to 8 hrs. and pulls apart with a fork. Great for sandwiches or over rice, noodles or pasta.

I have made this recipe several times now and enjoyed it every time. I don't find that it's too salty because I use low sodium soy sauce. As others have mentioned, mine usually cooks for about 8 hours and it's done, but I do check the temperature to make sure. This one is a favorite in my house!

This was very good. I read lots of reviews before making this, so I made the following changes:

1) Cooked for 10-11 hours on low. 22 is unnecessary.
2) Substituted some of the water with low-sodium beef broth.
3) Substituted beefy onion soup for regular onion.
4) Used 1/4 c. instead of 1/3 c. soy sauce.


I also took the roast out and mixed in a cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce. Took some of the fat off the beef and put it back in. I wish I had left this in at least another half hour, as it wasn't quite as thick as we wanted until after we were done.

My roast was shy of 3 lbs. and I do wish I had gotten a bigger one, as it cooked down a LOT. It barely fed 3 people in my house. With the changes above, I would absolutely make this again. Great recipe!

It was so good, we ate it all before I got a picture.  I added carrots, onion, and celery to the soup mix.  I had a 2.5 lb roast, and added 2 cups of water.  I cooked on high for 6 hours.  I served it with mashed potatoes.  I also took out some of the juice at the end and simmered it with corn starch to make a thicker gravy.  My kids loved it, as did Dad and I.

This my favorite slow cooker recipe! Everyone loves when I made this. It is so easy and the au jus is great for french dips. I salso use low sodium soy sauce instead and cook around 9 or 10 hours.

I needed a quick crock pot recipe before work one morning. I put a 3lb boneless beef bottom roast in at 7 am, frozen.  At about 5:00 I thickened the gravy and served over mashed potatoes.  The roast fell apart.  It was fantastic!  My husband and 4 kids (6-12 yrs) could not get enough.  There were no leftovers!  Thank you!

I Love this recipe! Great meal for the fall and winter months. I also used low sodium soy sauce. I have cooked for 22 hrs and 8-10 hrs. It is very versatile that way. Add some carrots, potatoes and peas for a great meal. Leftovers make wonderful tacos, burritos! Best gravy ever!

Added 2 cups water mixed with 2 tsp beef base. Trimmed fat off roast before putting in crock pot. Replaced Lipton onion soup mix with a sprinkle of onion powder, dried minced onion, paprika, oregano, Tastefully Simple's garlic garlic and salt due to MSG. Cooked 3.5 lb. Roast on low for 10 hours then shredded. Added a few Tbsp corn starch with a little cold water to create thick gravy. Best roast I've ever had! Really good served over thick garlic Texas toast

A very good roast, but a tad on the salty side with the soy sauce and the onion soup mix.  The roast did slice nicely and was tasty served alongside of ‘Caramelized Onion and Horseradish Smashed Potatoes’ another AR recipe.

I put it in the crockpot at 9 p.m. last night and actually woke up in the middle of the night because I smelled the food and thought for a minute someone was cooking!  I ate it tonight about 7 and loved the taste.  I was surprised it didn't scorch or make the meat too dry.

This is the best roast beef I've ever had and definitely my go-to recipe from now on. The best cut of meat I've used for this recipe is a 7-bone pot roast, aka chuck roast. Best if the cut has bones in it, to impart more flavor. Do not be afraid of the amount of soy sauce called for, it will not make the roast too salty, trust me. Also, instead of adding a bunch of water, just substitute a can of condensed French onion soup instead of the onion soup mix + water. There is no need to add that much liquid because the roast will let out its own juices. A nice touch to add is to put a package of halved button mushrooms into the crock pot during the last hour of cooking - best mushrooms ever! You can even save the juice to cook more mushrooms in later. I'm not sure why this roast would need 22 hours to cook. I cooked mine on low for about 8 hours and it was already fall-apart tender. Enjoy!

I shall have to agree that this was too salty for my taste so I tried it again with a few mods: omitted the soy sauce, kept the rest of the recipe, added 1 tbs of Hickory liquid smoke and 2 tbs of Worcestershire sauce. My 2nd roast was done and fork tender in 5 hours.

I used low-sodium soy sauce and I just didn't like that flavor in the broth.  I cooked it in the slow cooker on high for about 6 hours, then low  for 3 or 4 more hours.  Meat was tender and fell apart, but I just wasn't crazy about the soy sauce after taste.  Meh.

Good taste. Great gravy. 5 lb roast took 8 hrs on low. Unsure how it could have gone 22 hrs. Maybe my crock pot is hotter. Used 1/2 pkg of onion soup mix after reading reviews. Threw in carrots, small onions and potatoes.

I really liked this recipe :-).  Easy as!  The beef turned out really tender after 5 hours on high and 2 on low.  After reading the reviews I used reduced salt soy sauce and added some Oregano and Garlic then thickened the gravy at the end.  There is potential to make the gravy even more yummy.  I didn't find this recipe salty - maybe it is the New Zealand soup mix and soy sauce.  Really easy and tasty.

I used a 2lb. sirloin roast instead of the chuck roast.  I could easily use a larger roast, as it was a bit salty. I made a thickening for a great gravy and we had it with mashed potatoes (and just didn't add salt to those.)  We all really liked it!  Leftovers will made good sandwiches!

Put this in the slow cooker (on low) at 7:30am and returned home at 5:00pm. It smelled pretty good, but tasted way too salty, and a bit overcooked. I can't imagine leaving it in for 22 hours. That has to be a mistake! Next time I would make this with low sodium broth or V8, then add the soup mix but NO soy sauce. Would also not cook it for more than 5 or 6 hours.

Very quick to prepare and so delicious.  Before bed, I turned the crock pot to warm for the night, and in the morning, I put it back to Low, and added diced potatoes and threw in the little carrots from a bag in the refrigerator section of the grocery store.  So quick, easy, tasty.  Will certainly make this again and again.

A definite hit!  So easy and so good!  However, 9 hours on slow was all it needed.  Perfect with mashed potatoes.  I will make this one again and again!

Very good, the time is truly a typo.  I cooked for 10 hours and the meat was falling apart and very tender.  I like overwhelming taste and this fell a bit short for me but everyone else at my dinner party loved it and raved.  I may of spiced it up a bit more.

This recipe is amazing!  I almost always cook pot roast on Sundays, and I experiment with different recipes.  But it usually ends up tasting the same.  I was beginning to get bored of it, and then I tried this recipe.  It provides so much unique flavor to the meat, and it is so juicy and tender.  My husband (who doesn't really care for pot roast) even loved it!  And my small children ate it all too!  Thank you for this delicious recipe glasswomn9!

Wow 22 hours, I didn't ever dare!!! so I did what a lot of people  recommended here, 7-8 hrs in high, the meat came so soft that I could not cut it straight.  I agree with one of the comments that the meat should be "seared" first, but at 7 am going to work, I do not have time to sear anything. The meat came very good, good taste, I used beer instead of water (as someone suggested), I put the potatoes & carrots from the beginning and came out very good, not soggy. At the end, this is a good recipe that I would do again, the only thing I will change is the meat, I would like to cook this recipe with a different cut of meat, beef chuck roast has a kind of boring taste for me.

This was so easy and so good. I followed the instructions and mixed the soy sauce and onion soup mix added the roast and water. I made this Saturday afternoon and let it cook about six hours and put it in the fridge. In the morning I removed the fat on top and put it back on. I added all the veggies and a little water. When I came home from church I used the liquid and made gravy. It was very tasty and tender. I will make again.

I used Lite soy sauce and dry onion soup mix and it was way too salty for us, and I don't think it needs to cook anywhere near 22 hrs.  I tried as written though, and would probably try again only using less soy sauce with a little more water, and veggies.

Obviously this does not need 22 hours to cook! I put mine on high for 5-6 hours, then turned it down to low once it was nice and tender. My son who just started eating beef this year said he wishes he could have it every night. I'm so glad to finally have a slow cooker beef recipe that has some flavor! The soy sauce and onion soup cannot be beat. If I'm not feeling lazy at the end I thicken up the liquid with flour or corn starch.

Meat was nice and tender. I made french dip sandwiches by putting some of the roast on a sub roll with mozzarella cheese. I broiled the sandwich for 2 minutes and served with a side of au jus. It was so yummy. I didn't want to finish it.

I just did this for dinner tonight and its amazing!  I used a tip eye roast instead and I did it on high for 6 hours and it was falling apart and super juicy!  I will never search for another roast recipe again!  We plan on doing open faced beef and gravy sandwhiches with the leftovers (if there are any).

Excellent!  My husband claims not to like roast beef and loved this.  It was tender and the juice made FANTASTIC gravy. The left overs made a REALLY good sandwich!  Does not need 22 hrs. in slow cooker.  I cooked mine for 11 hrs on low and it was perfect.

I was skeptical about this because there isn't a lot of seasoning in this recipe. I cooked it on low for 9 hours and it was exceptional. VERY flavorful and tender......I will most definitely make this again.

OMG! This dish was amazing. Instead of cooking it in the slow cooker for 22 hours on low I cooked it for 8 hours on high. It was juicy, tenders, and down right amazing. My bf and his friends really enjoyed it and the best part is that it was just as good if not better the next day.  Great! Great! Great!

Delicious! Next time I too will shorten the cooking time; meat got a little dry, but the wonderful gravy (thicken the liquid with cornstarch) saved it.  Served with/over "Fried Cabbage and Egg Noodles" from this site.

I have made roast beef in the past and have always had left overs.  I decided to try something new and when I used this recipe there was not a shred of beef left on the plate; the family was asking for more.  Next time I will have to double the recipe!  Thank you :)

I used 2 tbls. soy and 2 tbls. worch. The soy from the chinese resturants seem to not be as salty as store bought so I used that. Also 22 hours is way too long. Mine was done after 7 hours on low. A great alternative to pot roast. If your feeling like mashed potatoes instead of it all combined. Sauce makes the perfect gravy.

Used organic beef broth instead of water and did not use soy sauce to cut down on sodium.  Cooked this 10 hours.  8 would be fine!  We added potatoes and yams!  They were awesome!

Ridiculously easy!  Followed the advice of the reviews and made a few mods.  Used 1/2 soy sauce and 1/2 worctershire, and only cooked 8 hrs on low.  Came out med-well, but very moist & tender, and not too salty.  Flipped it 1/2 way through cooking so top wouldn't dry out too.  Will make again, but cook it fewer hours.  Also will try to add different seasonings to "kick the flavor up a notch".  Great tip to add cornstartch to the jus for a tasty gravy - served with mashed potatoes.

I would give this recipe 5 stars if only the cooking time wasn't so "off". It took 6 hours on LOW for my roast to be cooked perfectly. I left it in though, thinking I should listen to the recipe, but after about 8 hours it was starting to get tough, so I took it out! Flavour was delicious though (not too salty), and for ease, this recipe just can't be beat!

Made just as directed, but cook time was only 20 hours.  Was just too salty.  We did eat it and will eat the leftovers and the tenderness was excellent.  I was worried about the cook time, but it came out with great texture and moistness.  i loved being able to put it on the night before and the smell my house had all day was excellent.  We just weren't crazy about the saltiness.  Thank you for the recipe!!

I had never made pot roast before and then found this recipe. Now I make it all the time! I do split soy sauce and W. sauce and I usually only cook it 8 hours on low, but my entire family (and my boyfriend) loves it! Thank you!

A hit in my house, and very easy on the cook. Used less soy sauce, and removed some liquid when it was done and thickened with cornstarch for gravy. Thanks for the great recipe!

A triumph! My "slow" cooker actually cooks quite fast, so I only cooked it for 10 hours on low, but when I served it, the meat just crumbled to my delight!
I just served it with the broth it simmered in, even my picky-eater-8 year old daughter loved it! I roasted potatoes for the side, I was afraid to add them to the crock pot for fear of overflowing!

I have made roast beef before and it does not take 22 hours to cook the most it takes to cook is 8 hours tops who ever said it takes 22 hours. I don't know i had to definetly redo this recipe to a 8 hour recipe.

Made this past weekend.  I do not use the soy sauce (too salty), I use either water with the onion soup mix or a can of cream of mushroom soup and a sliced onion (instead of both the soy and onion soup mix).  If you have an electric roaster, try putting the roast in that for 20-24 hours at 200-225.  I find it overcooks in my slow cooker thanks to how hot they cook these days.

This was actually the first roast I've ever cooked and it was fantastic - and better than the ones my mom made when I was growing up! (I won't tell her that though.) This recipe was so simple but turned out just great and my wife loved it as much as I did.

This is delicious! I was shocked to see 22 hours for cooking time though. My roast was frozen and it was done in six hours on high. This is very tasty and the roast is perfectly moist! Thanks! :)

Good base, and I would use it again, I just would add some bay leaves and salt and cut the soy sauce with Worcestershire sauce. You really do get tender roast with this one.

This turned out a very nice tasting tender, flavorful roast. This was a great meal to come home to after a long day at work. I served this with brown gravy over toasted bread for an open faced hot brown sandwich. I used an mushroom-onion soup mix, no other changes. We got several meals out of this roast. Thanks for sharing this. It was nice to try something new.

Very easy to make and it did taste good.  Very tender and tasty.  I did not cut back on the soy like some had suggested.  I did cut back on the cooking time.  I cooked mine for about 16 hours and it was perfect.  I kept the juice like it was and served it.  I will make it again.

I made this for a group of 12. I doubled the recipe to accommodate for everyone. 
I cooked the beef on low (in the slow cooker) for about 16 hours, and then kept it on warm for another 2. 
This was a hit meal to say the least. People could not believe how simple it was when I told them about how it was made. 
I will make it again!

Will make this one again. I used low-sodium soy sauce and regular onion soup mix. We thought the seasoning was very good. Shredded some for sandwiches as well.

Excellent.  I cooked for 11 1/2 hours.  At around hour 6 1/2 i added baby carrots, red potatoes and celery and enough water to almost cover all the ingredients.  It was really wonderful and very easy.  I wish I had added an onion or two, and will try that next time.

I love finding recipes like this one on allrecipes.com -- simple and delicious!!  My family LOVED it.  My youngest son went for thirds!!  The roast was fork tender and done in 8 hours, absolutely no need to cook for the suggested 22 hours.  If you don't like salty food, you will want to go 'low sodium' with your ingredients but we personally like meat seasoned well and this was perfect.  Definitely makes it into our rotation of recipes!

Very good.  I prepared the roast as the recipe stated except for the timing.  Twelve hours was sufficient.  I strained the liquid after and thickened with cornstarch.

By far the best roast I've ever had and it was incredibly easy to make.  We've had this at our home a couple of times now and I've replaced the soy sauce with reduced sodium soy because that reduced the salt content.  About 15-20 minutes before we're ready to eat I add fresh asapagus and broccoli to the crock pot.  The veggies cook in the broth and they take on the great flavor too.

WOW...This was fantastic!  I took previous advice and subbed Red Wine for the Soy Sauce and only cooked on low for 10hrs.  Very tender and tasty.  Also made a great leftover!!

This was fantastic - so soft and flavorful. I added 1/4 flour to the sauce, and 1/2 cup red wine along with the water, both great additions. I cooked it for 13 hours and even that was too long - it doesn't need any more than 11.

Well I started cooking this last night at midnight, at 2:30 this afternoon it was beyond done and all the juices soaked up.  So I added more, and just let it stay warm until dinner.  It definitely does not need to be cooked that long if it is fresh meat, and the flavor was a little bland.  Its a good base, but it needs a little doctoring up.  My husband said he loved it, but I'm not sure if he was just trying to make me feel better considering it's the first meal I've cooked in our new home.  My 2 year old didn't really care for it either.

Wonderful roast, and really, really easy!! The only complaint that I have about this recipe is that it came out a little salty. I never even salt my food, so I may just be overly sensitive to it. I added veggies for the last couple hours of cooking, and that made it a meal.The roast fell apart as I was taking it out (just they way I like it!). My husband woke up at 2am wanting dinner right then, the house smelled so good! I passed this recipe on to my mom the next day, and she made it using red wine instead of soy sauce, and she loved it. I'm going to try it her way next time just for another option. Thanks for the great, easy recipe!

I like being able to start this at night before I go to bed instead of in the morning when I am more pressed for time.  Was quite good.  I did use a can of defatted beef broth and a large sliced onion  instead of the dry onion soup mix which I don't care for and just added less water.

The best roast I've ever made.  (Though, admittedly, I had no idea what I was doing before and never added enough water.)  I made this for neighbors who just had a baby but needed to "sample" it before packing it up.  It was so good and tender I was sad to see it go.  I went out and bought another roast so my husband and I will have our own to enjoy later this week.  Looking forward to it!

This was great.  I also did it with a moose roast and it was the juicest thing I have ever had.  It also tamed down the gamey taste of the moose so the kids loved it as well.

Very tender meat and simple recipe, I will certainly use a little less pepper next time however.  Possibly add 2 tblsp. of worcestershire.

Got to love this recipe add the ingredients and walk away! I used a moose roast and it turned out perfect (we had been having problems with these roasts as they were very dry) Not anymore! My 5 yr old and 3yr old even asked for seconds! The hardest part was falling asleep the night before to delicious aroma!

I thought the soy sauce was a bit strong.  But the meat came out very tender.  If I make this recipe again I think I will just omit the soy altogether.  It was also nice to not heat up my kitchen for several hours cooking it in the oven.

YUM!  My kids LOVE this!  I do sometimes add some beer around 4 hours before its done for more flavor, but it certainly doesn't NEED more flavor, it's perfect as it is!  The best part, I can start it after dinner one night and it's done in time for dinner the next.  Thanks Tracey!

Amazing!!!  The beef is so tender that you don't even need a knife.  I've made this several times now, and I can truthfully say this is the best roast beef recipe I have ever encountered!

This recipe is extremely good, very tender! Mine took about 16 hours in total. As suggested, I added vegetables about 6 1/2 hours before we ate. During this time I also added 1/4 a cup of dark molasses and my own seasons. The juice had a great taste. I served the first half as it was, and made a thicker gravy out of the second half by blending it with 1/3 cup of instant potatoes & a can of cream of mushroom and heating. The whole family loved it.

This was quick, yummy and easy. Next time I'll probably add a lot more pepper, and try to improve the gravy- but it was great with some potatoes added to the liquid when it was almost done. Very nice and moist!

I used a can of French onion soup instead of the dried soup. I cooked it for 17 hours, but will cook a little less because it was on the dry side. I had plenty for leftovers to be made into sandwiches!

i used liptons beefy onion soup.  this was fabulous, the beef was moist and hubby loved it.  Made a lot of gravy that i thickened up with flour and water.  I froze the gravy and used it with pork chops the following week without complaints.

Made this for my boyfriend and my parents and it turned out GREAT.  I used more meat than the recipe called for (I used 5 pounds) so I needed extra gravy.  I used a can of low-sodium Beef Broth along with low-sodium soy sauce, and WOW what flavor!!!  This one is a keeper for sure!

This was wonderful!  I used low sodium soy sauce and had to add a little salt before the end.  It fell apart, was very tasty, and love by all.  I also used a different cut of roast--a top round roast.  I had to add a lot of water to get 1/2 inch from the top of the roast so maybe that is why I had to add salt.

I have to admit, I was skeptical about the soy sauce but this was THE BEST ROAST BEEF IN THE HISTORY OF ROAST BEEF. My family went nuts over it. I made it exactly as written, aside from cooking time (10 hours on low), and will continue to do so. Throw all of your other roast beef recipes away, you won't be needing them.  

Gravy: I took the roast out after 10 hours and let it rest for about 30 mins. I mixed cornstarch and water, adding it to the juice in the crockpot. I think I ultimately added about 3 tablespoons before it hit the perfect consistency. Best gravy I have ever had. Not kidding.

I was very happy with the results of this recipe.  In another recipe  onions and a pound of sliced mushrooms were added at the beginning  so I added those as well.  I only cooked it for 12 hours and will cook even less the next time.  I am looking forward to serving it on brioche buns to those pesky kids who like to drop in Sunday evening!  I used low sodium soy sauce and thought it could use a little more salt so I do not know what that sardine  guy was talking about.

This roast beef was very good & easy to make! I was hesitant after reading the reviews  about it didn’t take that long (as the original recipe stated) to cook the roast; however, I decided to still slow cook my roast for 20 hours and I’m so glad it did because it was excellent! The next time,  I think I will either add veggies to cut down on the salt content or use low-sodium soy sauce, but it was still a great roast  because we like well-seasoned food. I will make this again.

This was delicious! First: 22 hours is absolutely too long . 8 hours on low was more than sufficient. It was falling apart and so tender.  I also used the regular soy sauce but added a few potatoes and they pulled the salt. Make sure not to eat them because they are really salty. Next time I'll use low sodium soy.  Also I added a tablespoon of minced garlic.

I made this because of the long cook time. I work long hours and this way after a 14hr day I was still able to have a home cooked meal. That being said I started this about 8pm the night before and when I went to go to work at 5am I decided to turn it down to warm. I had my roommate add some cut up carrots and celery at about 2pm. I got home around six and the kitchen smelled wonderful. I cooked up some mashed potatoes and the meal was great. I should have made some gravy. I think because I turned it down the beef seemed a little dry. I will definitely try again!

I cooked it on low in smaller slow cooker for 11 hours.  Try 10 next time.   I served with mashed potatoes and carrots, which I cooked separately.

I used it 1st with a beef sirloin roast which was great. This time I used a Boston butt pork roast and it came out fantastic. It was cooked on low for 13 hours and was already falling off the bone passed the family taste test. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

When I reviewed the feedback from some of the other people that made this, I saw that they felt the dish was too salty.  To adjust, I added some sliced onions to the slow cooker.  I really enjoyed the results and would make it again.

Tasty! Did a bit less than the amount of soy sauce , used low sodium. Beefy onion soup mix, cooked from frozen on high for about 6 hours, then low for 2 more- came out great. Added some frozen carrots about half way through and made gravy with some of the liquid by adding corn starch and cold water. I'll definitely make this again, but can't imagine 22 hours cook time- seems way too long.

It was only in the slow cooker for about 6 hours  (the first hour on high) and my thermometer showed it finished. My husband and I thought it had great flavor and was very tender, however, a bit salty. I had made a double chuck roast at the time, so I would have leftovers for the rest of my family. I reheated it on the stove with some of the broth and a small amount of additional water. It still had great flavor (however less salty) and was even more tender. My son and his wife loved it. I'm planning to make it for Christmas dinner. I will make it a day or 2 ahead of time and then slice it and put it back in the crock pot with some broth to reheat. I've been looking for ways to cut down on my time in the kitchen during special occasion meals. Hope this will be a successful and flavorful way to do that.

After reading the reviews I reduced the soy sauce to 2 tablespoons cooked it for 8 hours and it came out tender & delicious. I have made it several times. This is the only recipe I use when making roast beef with mashed potatoes  & gravy.

So delicious and super easy! I added a box of unsalted beef stock and 3 whole cloves of garlic. Cooked on low for 12 hours for a 3-1/2 pound rump roast. Tender tender tender. Added quartered potatoes last couple of hours. The juice made a yummy au jus.

The meat was very tender and tasty.  I added potatoes, carrots and an onion in with the meat while it was cooking.  I cooked it for about 4 hours on high and an hour on low.  I then dumped the sauce into a pan and thickened it.  I did use low sodium soy sauce but even with that the gravy was way too salty.  Everything else was good, so I might make it again and just get rid of the sauce and make different gravy.  I was really disappointed because the gravy looked so good.

This was AMAZING. So simple. I used liquid aminos instead of soy sauce (tastes the same but no gluten), added a couple Tbsp of Worchestire sauce (a family fave flavor) and a bit more water to almost cover and thin out the salt everyone mentions. Then I cooked it in the Instant Pot for a few long cycles for meat, altogether a couple of hours. It fell apart it was so tender, and it may be one of the best meat dishes I've ever made, and I cook like a champ. Try it shredded in sandwiches and use the leftover juice for dipping. SERIOUSLY DIVINE.

It did taste over cooked after 22 hours. Next time I will reduce time and use lower sodium soy sauce too.  Still good with broccoli and rice.

I cooked this for 7.5 hrs. and added potatoes with 1.5 hrs. remaining.  I also only use 1 tsp. of pepper.  It turned out way too salty.  Next time I plan on skipping on the soy sauce.

This is my go to recipe for roast. No way do you need to cook it for 22 hours. I would have given it five stars othewise. If you want to cut down on the saltiness, use low sodium soy sauce. I have gone from frozen to done in 8.  I get all the raves and no one believes it is so easy!

Melt in your mouth tender beef. I made this actually overnight, planning on having it for dinner the next evening. As the recipe calls for 22 hours on low in the crockpot, my roast was done the next morning at about 14 hours. The flavor is excellent, but I need to say here... do not add any salt as with the soy sauce and onion soup mix, there is enough salt in it for me not to add any during cooking or grabbing the salt shaker at dinner. Overall, a great recipe  which is easy, with ingredients that I already have on hand.

With out a doubt my favorite roast. I use the juice to make gravy with, everyone loves this meal in my house. We cook as big of a roast as I can so we can use the leftover meat for meal prep. My favorite thing is to use this meat in a street taco, add a little pico, cilantro, and squeeze of lime. Without a doubt the best thing to do with this meat!

It came out beautifully. I did make a couple slight changes because I love my New England pot roast so I Tossed in some Redskin potatoes and then some chopped onions and I’ll take those out as soon as I go to serve it turn the juices  into a thicker gravy. On a whole the recipe is just tasty

This is my family's favorite and it is so easy! Leftovers are always used as hot roast beef sandwiches. I use 1 tsp pepper and cook it 10-12 hours (not 22 hours). I believe that is a typO.

This turned out great. I kept the recipe exactly the same except for the cooking time. The meat was 3 pounds and I cooked it on low for 10 hours. Juicy, fall apart result!
Only giving it four stars for the 22 hours...seems it would turn out rubbery at that duration.

I cooked it for about 10 hours and it was too bubbly so I turned it off. Wishing I had refrigerated before reheating so I could remove the grease, other than it being way too greasy,  it was very tasty, 8-10 hours would be plenty. I'm not sure what it would have been like slowly cooked for 22 hours.

4 stars only because I didn't make the recipe as is but I did use it as a guide. I used a 2.5 pound chuck roast and coated it in flour on all sides. I then seared it in a pan before putting it in the slow cooker to lock in the juices. I added some red wine and garlic to the soy/water combination. I cooked on low for 2.5 hours and then added a package of mushrooms. Cooked on low for 3.5 more hours and then turned it up to high for the last 2.5 hours. Total about 8.5 hours.

This doesn't need 22 hours of cooking! That is cray-cray! Anyway, as most other reviewers, I use low sodium soy. It is just OK! After 9 hours of cooking, it pulled apart, did not slice. It made tons of gravy which I poured off most of it and thickened the rest with flour. Had mashed potatoes and fresh steamed broccoli. A good dinner but not a 5 star dinner. Doubt I will make it again.....other slow cooker recipes are more flavorful!

I made this but I used fresh grilled onion and used a slow cooker on 8 hours. The family loved it over mashed potatoes. It was a big hit!

This roast came out delicious but in no way would take 20 hours. I cooked it on low for 10 hours and it was tender and juicy. I thickened the broth with corn starch.  I used low sodium soy sauce and wasn't too salty. Definitely would cook again

Didn't make it, don't need to. This sounds crazy salty and there is no cut of any protein that needs 22 hours to cook. I guess there are a fair amount of people out there with little time or experience in the kitchen. Throw in the obvious, carrots, celery, onion, garlic and potatoes and a beef or even veggie stock (low sodium). S&P to your taste. Cook for 1/4 of the time listed here and you are set. The next time branch out with some other veggies and experiment with herbs you like.  Cooking involves love, creativity and freedom; take advantage of it.

Two things: 1. Use low-sodium soy sauce to reduce the salt.
                          2. If you use an electric pressure cooker to cook the roast, it only needs to cook for about 45 - 60 minutes de-
 pending on how many pounds the roast is.

My roast was a bit smaller and did not need 6 hours but more like 4 especially if you prefer medium to rare beef.  I also added more seasonings.

Delicious meal! I used low sodium soy sauce and used a little less than the 1/3 cup. Also threw in a couple cloves of fresh chopped garlic, 1/2 of red onion (large chopped) and a bay leaf for extra flavor. Let it sit for 10 hours on low and put some carrots and cut up red potatoes in about 2 hours before we ate. My young sons (3 & 5) liked the flavor of the meat and potatoes and my husband was pleased with the flavor and tenderness!! Mama loved it too! (Especially the ease!) Will certainly make again! Yum!

I added carrots and potatoes after 3 hours...the roast and veggies were perfect after 7 hours.  The leftover broth makes an incredible French dip for any leftover roast.

I made this to the recipe with no changes to the ingredients. I slow cooked it for 8 hours. I didn't find the meat to be too salty at all. The sauce was very salty, but that doesn't seep into the meat much. The meat was very tender and juicy.  The sauce made a wonderful gravy, but may be a bit salty for some tastes.

The easiest recipe and ingredients ever and it tasted AMAZING. Even better than other recipes that had way more ingredients. My slow cooker automatically shut off after 12 hours and it was more than enough time. I had a little less than 3 lbs too. I used Kikkoman brand say sauce (regular) and the Lipton Brand onion soup.

This was excellent! Beef was very tender. More like a pot roast. Took the advice of other reviews and put mushrooms on the bottom of the slow cooker before adding the beef. Added vegetables (carrots, celery and potatoes) about 4 hours into the cooking time. Overall, it took about 8 hours. Thickened the gravy with water/cornstarch mixture (also recommended by other reviews). Served with a fresh green salad for an easy one-pot meal

I made this as directed. I guess I hoped the soy would mellow as it does so often in grill marinades, but I think the flavor just got too concentrated in this case. I served this over brown rice.

I love this recipe! The first time I made it, I followed the instructions exactly and it came out fantastic! I didn't think it was too salty, but felt a little more flavor would make it even better. The next time I made this, I rubbed the roast with salt, pepper & cumin. I made 5 slits on the roast, and stuffed garlic cloves in each of the slits. Next, I patted the roast with flour and seared it on a skillet, before transferring to the slow cooker. It cooked in half cup of water with the soy sauce & soup onion mix. 
I used the same skillet I seared the roast in, to caramelize a sliced onion and set aside. Cooked roast for 6 hours on low. Once done, I topped the roast with the caramelized onions. SO GOOD! Give this a try, you won't regret it. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

We really enjoyed this meal.  I don't have a slow cooker, but used the oven at 250F. for about 8 or 9 hrs. in two parts, as some suggested, refrigerating overnight and scraping off the fat before continuing in the morning.  A bit salty, but so good that we can overlook that.  We had it sliced with mashed potatoes and fresh veggies, shredded with rice and plantains, and finally in a sandwich.  Thanks for what will now be a staple at our home.

I added 1/2 cup of red wine and only cooked for 8-9 hours on low.  It was more than done.  I used the roast for sandwiches and used the broth/gravy as a base for making swiss steak a few days later.  Added a can of tomatoes, carrots, minced garlic, and celery.  It worked great!  Great flavor!

I substituted regular soy sauce with Kikkoman roasted garlic teriyaki sauce.  I also cooked this in the slow cooker on high for 5 hours instead of on low for 22 hours.  It turned out great and  was melt in your mouth delicious.

I made this as described using the same size roast and cooked it for 10 hours and still without gravy it would have been dry.  My complaint was the amount of pepper. The flavor here is overwhelmingly  peppery!

Tried my hand with this recipe, not great but good.  My wife's recipe is much better.  Big comment here is I had 4 lb cross rib roast and it was done in 8 hours on slow cooker on low.  Any longer and it would have too dry.  I imagine a 3 lb roast as called for would be done in 4-6 hours.

This is an excellent recipe! There are people complaining too salty. The soy sauce is used to tenderize the meat. And is an excellent base for the gravy at the end!
My mom would make this all the time and this recipe is exactly like her's. 
It's the best served with mashed potatoes but as leftovers, put some warmed up beef and gravy on a hamburger bun!
I would give this recipe more stars if I could!
Also you can slow cook it on high for 4-5 hours so you do not have to wait all day! Start it at 1pm and it will be done in time for dinner!

I used low sodium soy sauce, as suggested by some of the other reviewers and thought it turned out great!  I used a 2.6 lb roast, which took about 9 hours to cook on low.  I will definitely make this again!

The best pot roast I've ever made. My new recipe. I didn't change a thing except using gluten free soy. I cooked it for seven and a half hours on low, it just fell apart. Thank you for sharing!

At 18 hours I pulled my 4 pound roast out of the slow cooker, since it was falling apart. I was a bit afraid it would be too salty, since I don't use a lot of salt, but it wasn't at all. I did add a pound of mushrooms under the roast, so they may have taken some of the saltiness away from the roast. I like celery with my roast, so next time I think I'll add some celery salt. After pulling the roast out I put into the liquid 3 large potatoes, cut into 2 inch slices, and a quartered onion, which I had fried in butter and celery seed until just turning brown. No room left in the gravy for anything else. I cooked the potatoes and onions while I went to an appointment. 1 1/2 hours later I put all back together and it was delicious.

This recipe has been adjusted to make it 4 stars:
Only cook on low for 7-8 hours...
I use beef  broth instead of water.  Gravy comes out excellent!

Came out very bland despite additions to the recipe.  Family ate it but I felt it needed barbecue sauce or something.  I had a bottom round roast and rubbed with garlic powder and brown sugar before browning in olive oil.  Cooked on low for 8 hours in crock pot using only a quarter cup of soy sauce instead of a third cup, plus the onion soup and water, and 3 large cloves of garlic and 2 bay leaves.  Ladled some of the broth into a saucepan plus cornstarch to make a gravy after cooking.  Meat was fork tender like smoked brisket.  But overall it was just a bit bland.  Meatloaf tastes better and is less work.

Best roast beef I've made! As per other suggestions this is how I made it: 4 cups water, 2 beef bouillon cubes (I used McCormicks) and 1/3 cup soy sauce. Put it on low in the slow cooker for 8-9 hrs and it was falling apart and delicious! Put some of the leftover jus on the stove mixed with some corn starch and the gravy was perfect! Will absolutely make again and again and again!

I followed the directions for all the ingredients, but due to running errands, it cooked for about 45 minute linger.  The meat was pretty dry and VERY salty.  I might consider cutting the amount of soup mix in half and making sure to use low sodium soy sauce.  The flavor was really good, but I couldn't get over the saltiness.

So yummy! I would not recommend cooking this over night. The delicious aroma kept me awake! I used a prime cut bottom round roast. I would not leave a good cut in for 22 hrs unless you would like roast pudding! So yummy and easy! I followed other recommendations and added veggies a few hrs before serving.

The only thing I did differently was use low sodium soy sauce and about 1 1/2 teas of pepper instead of 2 teas. I'm not a pepper fan so I thought the top of the beef covered in pepper would be strong. But it wasn't.. This tasted Fantastic!! There is another beef recipe on this site that uses the onion soup mix but the beef needs the gravy for taste. This meat was great even without the gravy. I cooked it in a slow cooker on high for 7 hours and it was falling apart. VERY Yummy! Thanks!

2 tbsp is enough and adding onion soup mix makes it more salty. Try adding mushroom condensed soup from Campbell's to make your sauce thicker and concentrated.

Like most who went before me said, "22 hours is way too long"! I thought I'd put it in for 8 hours and check on it around 6. My mistake.....it was already well done. Lesson learned. Check on it often and assume it will cook MUCH faster then you think. Having said that, I will try it again sometime soon.

Gotta say - this is the best and easiest pot roast I've ever made! I have to admit I was a bit skeptical but the meat was so tender and flavorful. The gravy was excellent! 8 hours made my 5 lb chuck roast perfectly. Everyone raved about it. This one is a keeper! Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

I made this for dinner and it was AWESOME! I followed others and did the low sodium soy sauce. It was prefect. Not to salty and full of flavor. l am going to use the juice in a soup. It was easy to prepare and I will do this recipe again.

I try to make recipes as written before I mess with them too much, so I DID cook this sucker for 22 hours. It was ghastly. The meat was bone dry and tasted kind of like liver, and the sauce was so reduced that it was nearly too salty to eat. I could tell there was a change in the smell from delicious to livery at about 10 hours, so I think others' estimates of 8 hours sounds reasonable. I may try this again in the future with the much less ludicrous cooking time.

I have tried for years to find the perfect roast recipe that isn't too dry or dull. This one is it! Don't cook it for less time and I used low-sodium soy to make it less salty.

This was wonderful! It'd be 5 stars but I did not follow this recipe to the T. 22 hours!? Usually my pot roast is done in 7-8! I also only put 2 tablespoons of soy sauce. LOVE that the soy sauce gives it a nice flavor.

Not bad, a little on the bland side had to add seasonings at the end.  Definitely did not cook for 22 hrs, but meat was very tender!!

I made this not too long ago...it was a bit salty, and while I'm not a huge fan of salt, I still enjoyed it.  Next time I think I will cut down on the soy sauce a little (maybe half soy and half beef stock or water?) since it's not one of my favorite flavors.  I think I threw some A1 in there, as well.  I think I cooked it for the whole 22 hours (against user recommendations) since I didn't take into account the fact I had to work...heh...but it still came out tender and juicy.  Was a great and quick leftover homecooked meal to pack up and take up north for the weekend.

Although I said I enjoyed this meal, I don't think I will make it again as is due to the sodium content and cooking time.  This recipe isn't really so complex that you can't find something else on this site to compare therefore, "it was OK"...

Loved it.  It turned out tender & flavorful with lots of gravy.  I cooked it for about 12 hours. I also wasn't sure how the soy sauce would be, so I mixed it half & half with worchestershire sauce.  I will definitely use this one again.

The meat was SO tender!!! I made a few changes based off of what I had.  I had a 3.5lb roast, I used the recipe on this site for and Alternative to Dry Onion Soup Mix, (instead of using dried onions I finely chopped 1 large onion). I did brown the meat first and then put it on the slow cooker on high for 5 hours.  sooo tender.  the flavor was so so, hence the 4 stars.

It was good, but I found it to be very salty. Perhaps my roast was too small? Not sure. It was super easy and after thickening the juices into gravy, it made for yummy hot roast beef sandwiches the next day.

Made this today...smelled awesome, and tastes great.  I modified slightly by adding a can of cream of mushroom soup and leaving out the pepper.  Cooked a 2.5 lb. roast on high for about 4.5-5 hours.

I reduced the amount of soy sauce and it was still overwhelmingly salty. My husband liked it, but it definitely needed low-sodium ingredients.

Amazing!!  The roast cooked to tender perfection in my slow cooker for about 20 hours. I also added carrots,celery, and onion. I thickened the sauce with some cornstarch and served  the roast and veges over garlic mashed potatoes. Comfort food at it's best!

DELICIOUS!   Very, Very tasty. A really good meal for company. Did not cook for 22 hours, instead cooked on slow for 8-9 hours and then refrigerated overnight. Removed fat in morning and then cooked for another 2 to 3 hours and served on open face hoagy buns. A real keeper.

I would make this again but it wasn't mind blowing. I used only a 1/4 cup of soy sauce because of the saltiness issue. I figured we could always add table salt if need be. The gravy was delicious but no different than what you can get at the store if you ask me. Meat pulled apart nicely but it wasn't ad juicy as i was hoping. Cooked on low for 10 hours and served with a side of mashed sweet potatoes as well as the gravy.

My family loved this.  The meat was so soft it shredded.  I only cooked it for 12 hours though (and it was done), but I will try 22 next time, I just have to prepare in advance.  Thanks GLASSWOMN9.

This is really delicious, but I think 22 hours is way too long.  I'm thinking 10-12 hours, and the meat is falling apart at that!

I slow cooked the roast my normal 8-10 hours but other than that I followed the recipe.  I typically add potatoes and carrots.  The meat and potatoes had a good flavor but I did not like the carrots.  The overall flavor was good but wasn't a whole lot different  in taste from what I normally do with no soy sauce.

the soy sauce gave this a weird taste, and the cook time is far too long, but the boys ate it.

WONDERFUL!!!  but i did change a few things...lol.  i used a 2 lb rump roast, added cream of mushroom, one onion, bellpepper and stuffed the roast and seasoned it in addition to the directions. I cooked 14 hours and it completely fell apart.  i got wonderful raves from family and friends who thought it was fantastic.  I'd make this again in a heartbeat even though i didn't stick to original recipe exactly.  No need to add salt, it came out just right with the soy sauce and pepper that i used. :)  ENJOY!

I followed this recipe exactly as written, and although it wasn't anything to shout about, I gave it four stars because it turned out pretty good given the short ingrediant list.  I would make again as-is if I had the three items on hand.
