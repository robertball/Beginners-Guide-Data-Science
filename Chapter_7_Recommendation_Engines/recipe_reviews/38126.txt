My husband and 3 year old LOVED this. I think I would like it more with shredded cheddar vs. velveta. I did uncover towards the end and sprinkled with mexican blend cheese.

I was very disappointed with this recipe it was way way too cheesy. My 14 year old twins who love mac and cheese and don't get it very often could barly even eat it. We did however like the flavor and I am going to try it again but with just plain noodles to begin with not making the mac and cheese and cutting the velveeta in 1/2.

I fixed this for my two year old and it went over very well. He liked it and it was a nice way to sneak some vegetables into his diet. Easy and quick too!
