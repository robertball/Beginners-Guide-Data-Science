Easiest fish recipe, great for a quick weeknight dinner.
Though I will admit that my "pan fried" version was actually baked...
Delicious and healthy result.

No changes, I agree this is super just the way it is! No need to change a thing. Will be my favorite way to have fish now!

I made this tonight with a few modifications... I used coconut oil and granulated garlic. Topped with homemade salsa and paired with a pasta salad. Delish!

FWIW, we beat a couple eggs together with a little soy sauce, garlic, pepper, and lemon.  We dunked the tilapia in the sauce mixture, then breaded both sides.  It helps the breading stick better, just like fried chicken.  Very easy and tasty.  It took about 30 minutes for 5 fillets.

Very good. I wasn't sure about the salsa at first, but my wife and I were pleasantly surprised. Will definitely make again. I added about 1 tsp of Montreal Steak Spice to the bread crumbs, and pan-fried them in an olive oil/butter mix.

This is the best Tilapia recipe I've tried. The only change I made was to dip the fish in egg, & Panko instead of Italian bread crumbs (which I will try next time), only because Panko is a family favorite.  The Panko was plain so I seasoned it with a pinch of salt & lemon pepper,  garlic & onion powders, & a little shredded parmesan cheese.  I served the salsa on the side. 
Our kind of meal! Thank you!

Fast and east! Hubby enjoyed even thought he's not much of a fish eater. Followed directions except we heated the salsa separately and added it at the table, and hubby added salt. Will be making again!

Great idea!!  I top fish with all kinds of spices, but never thought to pour warmed salsa over.   The small crunch with salsa was delish!!  I'll make this for a quick lunch often.

Delicious! I thought 4 minutes each side was a little much. I cooked them only 2 minutes on each side. It turned out perfect! I substituted salsa for a little cheddar cheese. Amazing!!
