Good chocolatey cookie, but next time I'll use melted butter instead of the oil.  I used a premium quality chocolate and it deserved the rich, buttery taste rather than the flatness of the oil. The dough could have also benefited with the addition of a little salt to heighten flavor, maybe a quarter teaspoon.  I didn't roll them in powdered sugar as I wanted a greater contrast between the cookie and the candy kisses.  Very pretty!

Tasty and festive! They rolled into balls easily after being chilled, unlike some cookies which turn into goo in your hands. I couldn't find the white striped kisses, so I used the ones filled with caramel. They still looked good, and I ended up with exactly 48 cookies. I would definitely make these again!

This is a great party treat. For new years iused this recipe, but for a little zing I melted vanilla wafers and made them funky colores with food coloring. Then I drizzled them on top. It tasted awesome!

WOW!! These were SO good! I used regular milk chocolate hershey kisses, and they complimented the chocolate taste in the cookie so well. Everyone loved them! The BEST cookie I have ever tasted. Crowd pleaser, easy to make.. it goes without saying that I will definitely be making these again!

I used peppermint kisses with these and they turned out so cute and delicious!  I loved the combination of the peppermint with chocolate and they looked great on my Christmas plates.

These cookies were fantastic! The dough was well balanced and not overly sweet. My two substitutions were whole wheat flour and a butter alternative (Promise brand). I also did not roll them in confectioner's sugar. Delicious!

I would call it average. I would suggest using butter instead of veg oil and adding 1/4 teaspoon salt like naples34201 said, plus 1/8 teaspoon instant coffee granules for better flavor. I didn't like the texture, it was more cake-like than cookie-like. The taste was chocolately, but plain. Wouldn't make it again.

Delicious!! And very easy to make! These are very festive and look great on a holiday tray. The only thing that I changed is I left the powdered sugar off because I wanted my cookies to look like the picture. :)

I just made these I only switched the oil for butter. I used an almond bark chocolate so they came out very light, which was fine since I made them into s'mores by putting 1\2 a marshmallow and a kiss on top.

These are my kids' most requested holiday cookie (they are 23 and 17 now and still get excited about these!). I now make them with Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 gluten free flour and they turn out just as perfectly. The best thing is that they are a cinch to make - you can literally whip up a batch or two while doing other things (like watching favourite Christmas specials on TV!), because they have to chill for 2 hours before baking. And don't skip the icing sugar! That's what makes them so pretty, along with the striped red and white hershey's hugs. Enjoy!

I've made this recipe several times. After the first time, I switched to melted butter for the oil. Makes a huge difference!!! I've also used different kisses and chocolate rosettes. They're also great on their own.
