These are delicious! I had to make a substitution as I've never even seen dry buttermilk powder in my area. I used the standard vinegar and milk mixture in place of the powdered milk and water. My muffins were done in 23 minutes and were a hit! I will make these again.

I made three small changes. Instead of plain water, I used a half cup brewed unsweetened honey vanilla white chai and I added about a half teaspoon of dried lemon peel and a half teaspoon nutmeg. I did soak my raisins in the hot chai for about twenty minutes to plump them up. These took 20 minutes at 350* and wow, do they smell amazing! I will be making these again for sure, but when I do, I'll use my changes and either add double the raisins or add in a cup or so of Hershey's cinnamon chips. I'd add a little more liquid next time, too or bake a minute or two less. They were just a touch dry. The flavor? Amazing. Great recipe easily bendable for small personal changes. NOTE: I did use almost all organic ingredients. I think that helped the quality of the muffin immensely.

After reading reviews, I went ahead and doubled the spices and added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. With those changes, these muffins had really good flavor. I love the healthy aspect of them, but the whole wheat flour gave them a feeling of dryness.  I think next time I'll try adding a banana or some pumpkin.  I did sub chocolate chips instead of raisins because my kids don't care for raisins.  The chocolate was very good in these.

These are fantastic! My husband has eaten nearly half the tray already and I only pulled them out of the oven 30 minutes ago! I used 1/4 c white and 1/4 c brown sugar, added 1/4 tsp. of allspice and about 1/8 c more molasses because we love it, and used 1/2 c real buttermilk in place of the water and buttermilk powder.

This recipe got my attention because we love anything with molasses and spice, unfortunately I ended up having to make a few changes.   First I did not use wheat flour (only in bread) and then used regular buttermilk.   For us the end result was perfect (p.s. there is no really good substitute for regular buttermilk).    That is my opinion of course!!!!

These are fantastic and very easy to make.  I doubled the amount of spice (just because I love spicy)  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of cloves.  Yum.  I was just under the 1/2 cup mark for the molasses and completely forgot the baking soda (oops) but they were still great.  I added 1 cup of chocolate chips.  Perfect!

Good muffins. The kids really liked them. I didn't have powdered buttermilk so I used coffeemate creamer :) It seemed to be fine.

My husband liked this, but I thought they needed something more. Perhaps some dried cranberries.

All five of us, including 3 picky kids who aren't usually big muffin eaters, thought these were great.  I will absolutely make these again!  I subbed canola oil for the butter and they were still a teensy bit on the drier side, but I expected that because of the whole wheat flour.  I added more cinnamon and ginger, maybe not quite double the amount included in the recipe, which was perfect for us in terms of spice.  I also added about 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips to half of the batter for the kids and they all had seconds.  Easy to make, I had all of the ingredients, and everyone liked them...that's worth five stars to me!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I followed the recipe but made 1/2 cup buttermilk instead of powdered. These were a bit too "holiday" tasting for me... a bit like gingerbread. Also not sure if all that molasses sat well with me! The texture was good though.

Used only whole wheat flour, substituted the sugar for Splenda and used unsweetened applesauce instead of butter.  Very nice muffins :)

very good!  An excellent whole wheat recipe.  The strong flavors of molasses and spice really stand up to the whole wheat.  I omitted dry buttermilk and raisins.

This made a light, not too dense muffin. Sadly, fresh from the oven the flavor of the molasses and spices were not very noticeable. The flavor may improve as they cool. I will make this recipe again, although I may alter it to include more spices or molasses for a more pronounced flavor. Still a good recipe!

My picky taste testers loved the muffins.  I used applesauce instead of butter (and cut back on the sugar a little), blackstrap molasses, and extra spices (including nutmeg).  I also used ground flax instead of one egg.  
Delicious.

2 7 13 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/76380/molasses-spice-muffins/ ... Almost followed this recipe!  :D  Rarely happens.  Only thing I did was use plain lowfat plain yogurt for the buttermilk sub, doubled spices & no raisins.  In molasses cookies, I only add cinnamon; but went with this & added the ginger, too.  'Didn't alternate the yogurt, just added it to the wet ingredients last.  I liked these.  The top is a little crispy.  The flavor kind of reminds me of Russell Stover molasses chew candy.  Department of the Obvious, but that's a good taste.  :D  I really could't detect the cinnamon or the ginger (ginger especially, I can usually pick out) so doubling, in this girl's book, wasn't a bad choice.  'Gonna make these again.  'Think Laur would like 'em!  ... 3 6 17 ... 4.5 stars:  http://allrecipes.com/personal-recipe/62860660/ginger-molasses-muffins/ ... aka ... http://www.food.com/recipe/ginger-molasses-muffins-462216 (except for adding 1/2c wheat germ) .... Plain breadcrumbs on top before baking for both of these, please.  :)  Review isn't showing for Cheerios'.  Basically, try less sugar 2/3c or even 1/2c like this one.  E thumbupped with bite number one.  :D

My husband loves these muffins. They are simply and use ingredients we already have around. They are flavorful without being overpowering like molasses can get.

I also added vanilla, and more spices(allspice, cloves, extra ginger, and extra cinnamon). I did sub milk for buttermilk, but I did add a splash of white vinegar and put more like half a cup of milk rather than a quarter. They turned out amazing!!!

These were very moist and delicious. I didn’t have powdered milk so I substituted the water with half cup evaporated milk.

These were remarkably...um...dull.  I made them as written except to leave out raisins in my half of the batter and double the spices throughout.  And tho they smell wonderful baking, they taste of virtually nothing at all!  I'm hoping a drizzle of cream cheese frosting will liven them up somewhat.  I can't say that I'd go out of my way to make them again.  Sorry!
