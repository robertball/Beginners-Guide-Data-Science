Since writing this recipe I have changed to a skillet.  Brown chicken breasts on both sides in olive oil.  Squeeze 1/2 of a lemon over all.  Cover with lid over medium heat.  Cook til done.
Turning a few more times.  If you want it more lemony add a teaspoon of lemon zest.
I have also added 1 more cup of mushrooms to the sauce.   Thanks for the reviews.

This recipe would be perfect if it called for some, ANY kind of seasoning!  Salt and pepper isn't even mentioned.  However, last night I made "Chicken Seasoning Blend," also from this site, and I was looking for a chicken recipe to use it on - and this one seemed perfect to rescue, especially since a number of reviewers remarked that this chicken was "blah" or "boring."  These two were MADE for each other!  The submitter (in her review) and I were obviously on the same page, as I preferred to prepare this in a skillet  rather than in the oven.  I dredged the chicken in flour, seasoned it with the "Chicken Seasoning Blend," then browned it in the skillet. When making the sauce, the flour is unnecessary.  Once the chicken was done I removed it from the skillet and kept it warm.  I sauteed the mushrooms with fresh minced garlic (and salt and pepper of course), added a good dousing of chicken broth, lemon juice and white wine (Pinot Grigio to be exact), reduced that somewhat, then swirled in some butter at the end to thicken the sauce and to make it rich and velvety smooth.  (measuring these ingredients is really unnecessary - just cook with "a little of this and a little of that" and enjoy yourself!)  Served this with pasta and sauteed patty pan squash with dill.  This  dinner, this chicken, was right up my alley.

This was very good - although it absolutely needs garlic. I marinated the chicken breasts in the olive oil and lemon juice (with additional spices like poultry spice, italian seasoning, thyme, salt and pepper) for about 3 hours, which made the deeply infused them with lemon. I baked them but also found they didn't brown, and so put them in the broiler for about 5 minutes right at the end to get that nice browned top. I also used 2 whole lemons in the entire process (and had scaled the recipe down to 2 servings) so it was quite lemony, but I like to really taste things. A nice change of pace.

Made this last night.  It was simple enough, but I highly recommend doubling the sauce for your recipe.  In my case, rather than using 6 breasts for the 4 serving size, I used 3 breasts and left the sauce amount as is.  There was barely enough for my reduced serving.  Anyway, the chicken came out beautifully.  As other reviewers mentioned it could have used more flavor.  I'll make sure to salt and pepper the breasts in the future.  In addition, the sauce could have used more flavor.  I used half broth and half wine for my version.  I also added garlic powder, but it needed something more.  Perhaps a bit of rosemary??  All in all I enjoyed the textures of everything, just need to spice it up a bit in the future.  My accompaniments were brown rice and asparagus.

This was very good.  I took the suggestion and instead of putting it in the oven, I just cooked it in a skillet.  Also didn't have lemons, so I just used lemon juice and also sprinkled Lemon Pepper seasoning. I used a whole can of Chicken Broth, so I could have more gravy. Turned out great-- my whole family enjoyed this recipe.  Thanks sooo much for sharing :>)

EXCELLENT!!  I am going to recommend this recipe to people.  I put some asparagus in with the chicken while it baked, and it soaked up the lemon flavor and tasted really good!  I added some white wine with a cube of chicken boulion instead of chicken broth.  It came out great and it was quite simple and is pretty fool proof.  Great recipe!

My 14 yr. old daughter was recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and trying to find recipies with low carbs that everyone likes can sometimes be difficult... what pleases one turns another off, but this recipie was a HIT! Everybody loved the scent that the lemon put in the air while the chicken was baking and more importantly for my family... they all LOVED the mushroom sauce.  I did however use 2 4oz. cans of sliced mushrooms and upped the chicken broth to 1 cup.  The only difference was the cooking time for the sauce but it was only a matter of 2-3 minutes... Bravo Joyce for such a wonderful recipie.

I marinated the chicken in lemon juice and olive oil for about an hour before cooking in the skillet as suggested by other reviewers. It turned out wonderful. I also added 1 whole cup of chicken broth which yielded a nice amount of sauce for the chicken. I'm sure a quarter cup as stated in the recipe would have been too little.

Very good recipe!  I used a skillet as suggested, then after chicken was done I put it in the oven to keep it warm.  For the sauce I used 1 whole can of chicken broth, and added splashes of white wine and heavy cream.  My fiancee loved it and asked me to make it for his parents (future mother in law asked for the recipe by the way!).  Thanks for a new favorite!

I made as listed but probably should have trusted my instinct to tweak a bit.  We all thought this was missing something.  The chicken did turn out nice and moist with a pleasant lemon taste but if I were to make this again, I'd definitely add minced garlic and perhaps marinate the chicken ahead of time so that it picks up a bit more flavor.

I know it's frowned upon to review a recipe that I made adjustments to but I just have to, so take it for what it's worth.  I used 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts and squeezed the juice of one lemon over them.  I love flavor so I seasoned both sides of the chicken with garlic powder, salt, pepper, lemon pepper, and rosemary.  I sliced a 2nd lemon and laid those slices on top of the chicken.  For the mushroom sauce I used 1 full can (14.5 oz) of chicken broth, 16 oz. mushrooms, 1/4 c. white cooking wine, 1/4 c. heavy whipping cream, and adjusted flour/corn starch accordingly.  I also added minced garlic, salt, and lemon pepper to the sauce.  For an impressive presentation, serve the sauce over wild rice and place the chicken on top and garnish with fresh parsley.  I served cooked fresh broccoli on the side.  This was the best meal I've made in quite some time! Enjoy!

This was a big hit at my house!

I loved the lemony taste of the chicken, and the mushroom sauce was great.  I used two cups of chicken broth in mine.

I did make the entire batch of sauce for just two chicken breasts.  I'm like everyone else.  You just can't have two much of this mushroom sauce, and I would double it if I was making more than two chicken breasts.

I'm probably going to this sauce for other things, as well.

This was fabulous, I added 2 cloves minced garlic and salt and pepper, of course,to butter in sauce before adding mushroom.  I also used portabella and white mushrooms.  Next time I am going to try white wine instead of chicken broth.  Definitely a keeper!!!!!!!

Wow, this is great with a few changes (most as previously suggested).  I marinated the chicken (I used tenders, 2 lbs) in a T olive oil, the juice of 1 lemon, 1t italian seasoning, and 1/2 t old bay (or poultry) seasoning for 2 hours, flipping over at one hour.  Then I sprayed a bit of olive oil spray in my skillet and poured the chicken and juice into the pan to brown on each side and then I covered with a lid and cooked each side 7 minutes until no longer pink on medium heat.  I took the chicken out of the pan to keep warm in a 200 degree oven while I used the same skillet for the gravy.  I cut the butter down to 2 T and added a chopped shallot along with salt and pepper with the mushrooms (used a 10 oz. container of sliced mushrooms).  After adding the flour I added the chicken broth a little at a time until I had the right consistency to call it gravy.  It was darn yummy. Thanks

This chicken was amazing! My boyfriend & I raved about it, even while eating it. The only thing is we didn't have any lemons so we used lemon juice & it was still perfect. Also, from reading over reviews I seasoned the chicken before baking with a little bit of salt, fresh ground black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder & chicken seasoning. Will definitely be making again.

Key is: BASIL and a little garlic. I also added a touch of milk to mushroom sauce to make it more creamy. Perfect!

Very GOOD! I made for 2- and doubled the sauce. You really need more of the mushroom, butter sauce. I used 2 cups broth and 1/2 cup white wine with the 2tbs of flour. Came out just dandy!  Will make again.

Good so long as you douse the chicken in Italian seasoning before you put the lemons on top.

Made it twice.  The first time was OK.  Took too long and it was kinda blah...needed some seasoning.  The second time I made it I sprinkled salt and pepper on the chicken breast, coat it in flour and browned it on a skillet with olive oil.  I added some garlic to the the pan also.  Added a can of chicken broth and some dried tymes.  Put the slices of lemon on each chicken, brought it to a boil and reduce the heat to simmer and covered it for 20 mins.  Took the chicken pieces out and reduced the broth to a saucy consistency, about 10 mins on med. heat...end result= yummmm!

Not as much lemon as I would have expected, but thats okay. Made some homemade french fries and a carrot/broccoli veggie mix to go with it. I only made two chicken breasts, so the amount of mushroom gravy was great. I rubbed the chicken with lemon pepper, thyme, basil, oregano and olive oil and then let it bake from there. I cooked the mushrooms with some onion and garlic in a skillet, and had to use a lot more chicken broth to keep it a medium thickness of a gravy. But overall, I really enjoyed this recipe! Thank you!

This is so good! I did change it up a little, but it would have been good the way it was written. So, still 5 stars! I sprinkled the chicken with lemon zest, sqeezed on lemon juice, added a sprig of rosemary then topped with a lemon slice. I also topped with sliced onion and green pepper. For the sauce, I added some pressed garlic, lemon zest, very little lemon juice and salt and pepper. I also added some white wine and reduced it a little. I used boulion instead of broth (sodium free), added 1 1/2 T flour to thicken then added 1 cup of milk to make a creamy sauce. My family loved this! My husband does not like chicken breast and he loved this. The chicken was so juicy and flavorful. I served this with pasta. Rice would have been good too. I will definatly make this again! Next time I am going to try marinating the chicken in lemon juice, rosemary and EVOO.

The lemon is a very light taste, but perfect and the chicken came out very tender, which is difficult for me in the oven.  I only had beef broth, but the mushroom sauce still came out wonderful and my 2-year old helped gobble everything up!  This goes on my "make often" list :)

This recipe is unbelievably good!  The sauce is amazing!  I made it pretty much like this recipe, but I added a little white wine to the sauce and extra lemon.  Also, I used orgainic lemons, which are stronger, have more juice, and are all around just way better.  I love lemon, so the extra lemon was great.  My husband isn't so fond of lemon.  Using the exact amount is better if you aren't that into lemon flavor, otherwise go crazy!

A fabulous and simple recipe that I was happy to make on a normal weeknight but would have been delicious enough to serve to company!  I cut the chicken and mushrooms down since there are only 2 of us and kept the sauce the same so we would have extra for our rice.  If I was making the full recipe I think I would increase the sauce significantly.  Also, I ended up using quite a bit more chicken broth than the recipe stated.

Guest Dinner Good with light changes!  My kids whined when I told them what was for dinner.  I almost had to argue with them to try it.  The first words out of my daughters mouth once she tried it was, "Wow!  This is REALLY good. I mean, REALLY, REALLY GOOD!" Score!

I did take other reviewers advice and season the chicken.  I seasoned them with a very light sprinkle on each side of the chicken breasts with poultry seasoning, season salt, and garlic powder.  I lightly browned each piece on the stove top. I also squeezed one whole extra lemon over them all, before baking them in a 9x13 pan with a foil cover for 35 minutes.   Served over a bed of rice.....most excellent dinner!
Update:  I made this for a dinner party with the same seasonings as I did last time.  They don't like mushrooms, so I put the gravy on the side for each to add to their own.  One of my dinner guests, who usually eats minimally, scarfed her meal and raved over it the rest of the meal! Then the next morning she called again thanking me for such a wonderful meal, and said she couldn't stop thinking about the chicken and wanted the recipe!  It's AWESOME! Must try!

As the recipe stands, I wouldn't give it more than 3 stars. With some modification it's certainly a 4 or 5 star recipe. I added garlic, salt and pepper to mine. As the original author noted in her comments, I floured my chicken breasts and then pan seared, then finished cooking at a low temperature in the oven. The sauce was really flavorful.

I wanted to make this as I haven't had lemon chicken in years.  First I marinated the chicken in lemon juice and olive oil.  Then I browned the chicken breasts in a skillet before baking them.  I used the juice of two lemons...I thought it was too lemony and tart for just 2 pieces of chicken but my husband loved it and said, "Make it again exactly the same!"  I put egg noodles on the plate, chicken breast on top and then spooned the mushroom sauce over it.  It was a good chicken recipe and gave us something different to do with chicken.  Thank you!

While this recipe shows promise and is good, conceptually, I had to add a lot of seasoning to it, to make it good. I found it to be lacking in flavor.

Pretty basic recipe.  I marinated the chicken for about 5 minutes in olive oil, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and a dash of cayenne pepper.  Gives it a lot of flavor.  Browned the chicken in a skillet first.  Removed the chicken and made the sauce in the same pan to get all the flavor from the chicken.  To make the sauce, I added a splash of white wine (about 1/4 cup) initially and did everything else the same.  I had to use about twice as much chicken broth as the recipe called for. I'll cut down on the amount of flour next time.

Very easy recipe. I substituted a gluten-free flour for the sauce and was pleased with the results. I loved the taste immediately and I will be making this recipe again.

This is one of the best chicken recipes I have ever made or eaten.  So good.  You can really taste the lemon in the chicken and the mushroom sauce is delicious.  I don't think any other spices are necessary to add if you really want to taste the lemony chicken.  I do recommend doubling the mushroom sauce though.  It seemed to run out quickly. Other than that, this was perfect!

Very easy but VERY bland. Chicken should be browned first. Didn't taste the lemon.  Disappointed.

Me and my boyfriend loved this recipe! I added sage, thyme and rosemary to the oil (I also used a little more oil) before coating the chicken and added red wine to the sauce (we were out of white wine) and it was great!

Was a wonderful dish!!!  I prepared it exactly as directed except I added garlic and pepper to the chicken breast before baking.  Also after after cooking the mushrooms down I added a small bottle capers which went really well with the lemon flavor!!  All in all an awesome recipe!!

Good! I love the lemon and mushroom flavor! I cooked the chicken on the stove instead bake in the oven. Added extra lemon zest for a more intense lemon flavor.

This was excellent. I marinated in oil/lemon, salt & pepper with garlic in the a.m. and made it when I got home from work. Easy & delicious. Added lemon zest at the end.

Delicious, simple and looks like a lot of effort went into this meal.  I did double the Mushroom Sauce portion so we could pour on our rice too. I especially liked this because this recipe has what I refer to as "normal" ingredients (the basics) so not a lot of time hunting for rarely used spices.  That is the main reason I like this site. Average people sharing their families favorites, for the most part, that are easy to follow.

First of all, read other reviews and be sure to add some seasoning! I went ahead and baked this since it worked out to do that with the side dish I was making. It did not brown, but it gets covered with sauce and my bf and i agreed it was still yummy. Here are my changes:
1. Seasoned chicken with Salt, Pepper and Garlic Pepper
2. Added 1 clove of minced garlic and Salt & Pepper to mushrooms while sauteing. 
3. Added Salt and a lot of pepper to sauce right after adding broth. 
Definitely easily seasoned to taste, but we thoroughly enjoyed and will make again!

Yummy. I did as others suggested and browned my chicken first. I also seasoned it before coating with lemon juice. I put a little more juice on than called for and topped with the whole sliced lemon. I also baked covered in foil. It came out very moist and wonderful flavor after 40 mins. I will be making this again. It was so fast and easy and with baby #2 on the way that's exactly what I need in my life ;)

I am giving this 4 stars based on the recipe as it is.  I followed the advice of many of the other reviewers and added more seasoning (it needs it!).  I also cooked the chicken in a skillet as suggested.  This dish was delicious.  My husband and son gobbled it up.

I made this chicken exactly as it says to.  I thought it was flavorless, and didn't look very good either.  Without the Mushroom sauce, it would have been awful.

The only good thing about this recipe is the moistness of the meat. I had pounded the chicken breasts to tenderize it before adding the olive oil and lemon. The mushroom sauce adds very little flavor. I will most likely season the chicken next time and hold the mushroom sauce. It wasn't a good combination. I'm thinking of a light lemon sauce with asparagus and wild rice.

delicious, made for dinner last night and came out wonderful. I baked the chicken since i thinnk it comes out juicer but you need to adjust the time because i feel it was a little dry. I sprinkled lemon pepper and garlic powder over chicken before baking and added it to the sauce. Very tasty dish.

A winner in our home!  I brushed the chicken legs and thighs with EVOO, lemon, and herbs, and followed the rest of the recipe.   The mushrooms didn't yeild a very much sauce, and I threw in some peas and bacon. Still a keeper :)

I doubled the sauce and it turned out to be the perfect amount. I used veggie broth instead of chicken broth and it was delicious. I took advice from other reviews and salt/peppered the chicken then cut it into 2" pieces and cooked in a skillet. YUM!

I've made this numerous times and I love it. If it weren't for my mushroom loathing husband and sons, this would be come a staple. The problem is, I LOVE mushrooms and would cook it as is and wouldn't hear the end of the complaints. Great recipe!

Mmm! My husband and I loved this stuff! I only made 3 chicken breasts but I followed the other reviews and used 1/2 cu. butter, added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the butter, added 1 extra cu. of mushrooms and used an entire can of chicken broth and it was the perfect amount!  I also used Wondra sauce/gravy flour (a must-have for gravy lovers!!) instead of the all-purpose flour and the texture was perfect! The chicken was super moist.  I served w/ steamed asparagus and white rice that I squeezed some lemon juice over as well.  This was one stays for sure!!!

This recipe turned out great for me and my husband.  I listened to other reviewers who suggested marinating the chicken with the lemon and oil (added minced garlic as well) for about 30-45min before baking.  Also, I flavored up the simple mushroom gravy by adding about 1-2tbsp. of Dried Thyme which gave it just the perfect amount of seasoning.  It tasted so good with the lemon chicken flavor.  Rosemary would also be pretty nice I think with the lemon flavor; I'll try that next time I guess. I will definitely make this again though.

The sauce was great. I baked the chicken instead of using a skillet and I still thought it was excellent, although it took longer to cook than listed. I added extra chicken broth to the sauce and kept it on a low simmer- came out great! I think the sauce is what makes the dish- so plan to make extra sauce.

This was excellent! I took the others' advice about searing my chicken breast on a pan first (it looks better when served and also makes the chicken crisp on the outside and juicy in the inside) before baking it. I also added white wine to the sauce and it was divine. My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. I served  it with roasted potatoes and steamed green beans.

This was so delicious I have passed it on to others.  I did add a lot more lemon and broth and did not use butter but used olive oil & some margarine.  Not as much as it was called for.  Also cooked it on top of stove and it worked out just fine.  Innes

The fresh parsley is key on this one.  I followed it to the 'T'.  It was easy, tasted even better than I'd hoped, and got a rave review from a very honest (when it comes to my cooking) boyfriend.  Next time, I'll double the sauce and serve it over pasta.

I've tried this recipe BOTH ways. It's delicious either way, but the skillet method is MUCH better, both for looks (browned) & taste (much more developed)!
It's just a total PAIN!!! Trying to follow a recipe, written for the oven style, with only vague footnotes & reviews for the skillet style is INSANE!
The original poster really should post her skillet method as an entirely NEW recipe! 
If she won't I will!
BTW... I'm making it again, right now (Yes... it's THAT GOOD!), hence my present frustration.

I love lemon, so I really enjoyed this recipe. I kept the sauce the same but cooked only two breasts and used a skillet.  Really good, but I will add seasoning next time.  Quick and easy, can't beat that!  Thanks for sharing!

Simple recipe and easy to make, very yummy! I did splash on quite a bit more lemon to make the chicken really juicy. I also through on some salt, pepper, and cajun seasoning, on both sides, so that the chicken could have a bit more flavor. My husband really loves this dish!

I gave the basic recipe 3 stars because I had to follow other reviewers ideas for doctoring this up. Added garlic, salt and pepper, and Italian seasoning to the chicken before cooking. I also had to add quite a bit of flavor to the sauce. Doubling the sauce was also needed. Good basic idea but as is it would have been very bland and skimpy on the sauce.

Several folks suggest cooking in a skillet, however I thought it came out absolutely perfect baked uncovered for 30 minutes. Only thing I changed was using montreal chicken seasoning w/ EVOO before baking and to the sauce adding minced garlic, chopped red onion and capers. It was AMAZING on bed of linguine!

Absolutely delicious! I put some Parmesan cheese on top of the chicken 5 minutes before taking it out of the oven and, even without the sauce, it didn't need any salt! Five stars!

Good Recipe! Just needed to add some seasoning.  I used what I like...garlic salt, salt, pepper, and lemon pepper seasoning.  Also, I added a little garlic to the butter and mushrooms.

I made this last night. The only changes I made was to season the chicken with garlic salt & pepper. And I added green onions to the gravy mixture along with seasoning salt & pepper to taste. It was delicious. Our 9 year old daughter raved. It's a keeper!

We love the mushroom sauce, but it felt a little out of place on chicken.  we made this with Porkchops and it was much better!

My family loved this whole recipe.  I only added garlic salt to the chicken and very lightly and used chicken broth when making my white rice and everything was just perfect.  I was proud of myself or making such a fine dish.  I sauted green beans for are side veggie.  I am very, very happy with this one.  Thank you Joyce for sharing this wonderful recipe.

The chicken was terrific. Super easy and really good. I did have to add milk to the gravy because it was REALLY thick, but after the addition of the milk everyone in my family loved the result. Thank you for sharing this one!

although , as another reviewer suggested,i dredged my breasts in flour, then pan seared them, then put them in the oven after i had used basil, garlic, lemon, this was a lackluster serving.  the mushroom sauce was ok - i also added garlic and onions to that and used WAY more chicken broth than called for in the recipe or it would have been too thick and not really a cream sauce.  as the recipe is written, i have to think this recipe would have been seriously bland.  after dinner, my husband spontaneously spoke up and said that we had a nice dinner.  he didn't go overboard though and he just loves to see a big ole slab o meat on that plate.  trying to serve veggie several nights a wk:)

Make-for-company-good! Followed advice of others to add some garlic to chicken and brown it before baking, although I'm not sure it was necessary.  I found the sauce needed MUCH more than the 1/4 cup of broth the recipe called for. I at least doubled it. Husband could have done without the mushroom sauce, but I thought it all went together really well. Served over a bed of thin spaghetti. Will definitely make again.

The good thing about this recipe is that is can work for adults and kids. I seasoned the chicken with Mrs. Dash and a little bit of garlic powder and proceeded to follow the recipe as called for. The good thing was I left off the mushroom sauce for my picky 8 year old and the lemon chicken by itself was tender and flavorful for her. (She ate every bite of her chicken breast) The rest of us added the sauce on top of our chicken and were able to enjoy a more complex dish. I will make this again.

Really Great with the changes I made. HUBBY LOVED IT!!!  I too cooked in a skillet.  The comments about being bland got me, so I spinkled the chicken with paprika, salt & pepper before cooking - I used lemon juice from a squeezable lemon.  I only did 2 breasts but made the amount of gravy called for in recipe and there was plenty.  I added chopped onions to sautee just before chicken was done.  When Chicken was done I removed it and made gravy according to recipe with the exception of the added onions, I also added 1 good tsp. majoram, 1/2 tsp creole seasoning and I used 3/4 cup beef broth instead of chicken broth, 1/4 cup dry vermouth (better to cook with than wine),  when thickened I returned chick to skillet and gently simmered about 10 min. waiting for the steamed asparagus to get ready.  OH-LA-LA!!!!!!!

This was really good, I did make some changes though. I cut up my chicken breast in pieces & browned in olive oil in saucepan, while the chicken was browning, in another saucepan & sauteed 2 clove crushed garlic, sliced button mushrooms & about 1/2 red onion, covered on low, when the chicken was browned on both sides I added about 3/4c fat free chicken broth, about 1/2 c white wine & about 1/2 of a fresh squeezed lemon, salt/pepper to taste, some fresh broccoli florets, & some fresh cut up asparagus(thats what i had on hand) simmered till veggies were tender, added my mushroom/onion saute & then thickened my sauce w/ a little flour...& served over egg noodles...yeah, it was good! hubby really liked it too!

This is a great recipe!  I made a few changes:  The chicken breast I split to make them thinner then added them to a ziploc bag with the juice of one lemon, 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt, pepper and dried parsley.  Marinated about l hour then baked as directed.  The mushrooms used were baby portas...sauteed but also added a bit of white wine when the moisture cooked out,  then the flour and broth... I served this with rapini sauteed in a bit of butter and olive oil...delicious!

Made this last night and it was tasty!!  I followed the other reviewers suggestions.  I browned the chic breasts in olive oil, butter, onion and garlic first.  I actually trippled the gravy mixture, but only used three chic breasts.  I didn't have a fresh lemon, so I used bottled and it tasted just fine.  I also added plenty of salt and pepper as well as some Rosemary Powder and Shallot Salt.  I will definitely make it again.

I doubled the butter,flour and stock to have more sauce. I made the recipe as called for but next time needs more lemon flavor in sauce and I cut the breasts in half and cooked in  a lot less time. Would make this again

For a healthier choice, I baked my chicken as in the recipe but I added potatoes so they baked together. I also sprinkled garlic powder on the chicken breasts and lemon pepper all over. I also added some white wine and half a can of cream of chicken soup to the sauce and more garlic powder and lemon pepper.

This chicken was excellent! I think it retained a lot more lemon flavor by being baked (have made similar recipes on the stove top that do not come out this lemon-y). I would rate this 5 stars except that I think it is in need of a bit more flavor. I sprinkled a bit of coarse garlic salt over the chicken before baking. I also added about 2 tsp. of minced garlic, salt and pepper (to taste) to the mushrooms. This recipe is amazing, I can't wait to make it again!

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was good, but I think the mushrooms need a little more oomph.  Next time, I may try adding some Worchestshire sauce and/or garlic to the mushrooms as they cook.  Overall, a good meal.

My family and husband didn't care for it. I thought it needed more seasoning and could be a 3 or 4 star. The lemon flavor came through but that was the only evident flavor. I will try maybe again using some of the many recommended variations.

An excellent recipe, but only if you add some sort of seasoning to taste.  My DH added lemon pepper to his portion and I added a garlic wine seasoning.  It was wonderful, with seasoning but too bland alone.

This is really good, but with a few minor changes. I add half a sliced onion when I saute the mushrooms and I used half chicken broth, half dry white wine. Using a good chicken broth and a decent drinking wine, your outcome will be much improved. If you like more sauce like we do, you might want to double it. It goes excellent over rice. My husband ate three helpings of the chicken last time I made it!

I think the chicken and the sauce need to be rated separately.  1.  The chicken needed to be seasoned before baking because I wanted to make sure I had some dimension and it was more than just a "lemon" flavor.  I give the chicken 3 stars because I ended up having to broil it afterwards to have it brown and season it extra.  2. The mushrooms just needed some salt and pepper and this was FANTASTIC!!  My fiance eat it up.  The only thing I would say is to make more of the sauce!!  (I made a rue ~ cooked flour and COLD butter~ in a separate pan and added more stock and salt and pepper than added to the pan.)  I give the sauce 5 Stars.  If you wanted to make this more of a marsala type of dish before the flour you could reduce some red wine for awhile and then add the flour.  Great base for a cream sauce.  Next time...I'll add some broccoli or asparagus in the mix. :) :)

Actally, it's the sauce that gets 5 stars.  The chicken was in desparate need of seasonings.  The sauce is delicious although a little milk or cream added will make it creamier and stretch it further since there isn't much of it for six cutlets.

Wonderful combination of flavors.  I only gave this recipe four stars just b/c as written I don't think it is at its max potential.  I followed another reviewers suggestion to marinate the chicken and I am so glad I did!  Marinated the chix for 3 hours in olive oil, 1 lemons juice, lemon zest, minced garlic, salt and pepper.  For the sauce I only used 1.5 cups mushrooms, added 1/4 of an onion, only used 1 TBSP flour, added more lemon juice and a bit more chix broth than it called for.  I only baked two chix breast and the sauce was just enough for those two.  So if you were to make the recipe for six I would suggest increasing the sauce!  Served this over brown rice.  DELISH!  Will definitely make again!

This tasted pretty good, but I had to make some changes.  I added garlic, for one.  Also, the half cup of chicken broth turned to paste immediately - i added another half cup broth, but it was still very thick.  The sauce just has an unappealing greyish appearance.  It tasted alright, but then I squeezed another half lemon over the chicken/mushroom sauce, and that made it quite good after all.

Definitely a keeper! I did add some seasonings to the chicken and a little salt to the mushroom mixture. This is restaurant quality and a very easy recipe to follow. I would recommend everyone give this recipe a try

I was super skeptical about this recipe and it's lack of seasoning listed! I added some fresh garlic, salt, and pepper. Also salt and pepper and white wine in the sauce. I found the sauce to be pretty bland, so I tried adding some lemon juice to it and it made ALL the difference.

I used split-chicken breasts for this dish. Topped each piece of chicken with salt and pepper and minced garlic in melted butter before baking. Thought I had plenty of chicken (expected left overs), but there was none left after dinner. My mushroom sauce was on the thick side so I added a little more chicken broth to thin it out. Served with linguine noodles in garlic butter (we love garlic) and steamed broccoli, cauliflower and carrots. I will be making this again.

I seasoned the chicken with Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, lemon pepper, garlic, and a whole lot of lemon juice. I poured olive oil over all of it and let it marinade as one commenter said. I omitted mushrooms from the sauce and added asparagus. This was the first time making lemon chickrn and it was AMAZING! My bf ate it all up and has been asking me to make it ever since. I panicked because I couldn't find this exact lemon chicken recipe until just now. I will be recipe boxing this for sure :)

Easy and delicious. I marinated the chicken in olive oil, lemon, and rubbed garlic before baking. The mushroom sauce was great...I added more bouillon than recipe called for, only to have lots of sauce.

As with many recipes, the ratio of ingredients just aren't right.  With that said, I'm rating this based on the flavor alone.  There is no way that the sauce as written will yield enough for six chicken breast halves. I had two large boneless breast halves that I ended up slicing in thick medallions.  Departing from the suggested cooking method, I browned them in the olive oil. Then I added the butter, juice from a Meyer lemon, some of the chicken broth, and the mushrooms. I sauteed them for about five minutes, then added the flour and more broth to thicken. It made a very nice sauce, but I had to more than double the broth to have enough for two plates. My hubby and I both enjoyed the savory flavor and tenderness of the chicken.

This recipe was great with a few little additions. Along with the lemon, I sprinkled garlic salt, basil, and onion powder over the chicken before baking. I also sauteed garlic in with the mushrooms while making the sauce. Very good!

I made this the other night.  It was pretty good.  I added additional spices as others had said it was bland.  I am glad I did cause I think it would have been boring without it.  I served it with chicken risoto with spinach, asparagus and cheese.  Yummy!

This dish ends up tasting good, but the recipe needs some tweaking.  As others have noted, it does need seasoning (something as simple as salt and pepper).  And I found that the mushroom sauce needs a LOT more than 1/2 cup of broth; just adding 1/2 cup resulted in a paste.  I had to almost triple the amount called for to get something resembling a sauce.

Very tasty, especially with the lemon. I like the idea of the mushroom sauce. As we are trying to cut down on fats, I used olive oil instead of butter. That does take away a lot of the flavour of the sauce, but it was still good and I'm sure with butter, it would be even better!

Very easy and tasty.  I needed to add another 1/4 cup of chicken stock to the pasty mushroom mixture.  That did it.  Perfect.  We like lemon so next time I make this I will add another lemon.  Excellent dish.

Fan-tas-tic!  Rubbed chicken with olive oil, then salt-peppered-herbed each breast, then poured a generous amount of lemon juice around them and baked at 400 for about 25 minutes.  Then I changed the oven to 450 and allowed the breasts to crispen and brown a bit.  (Maybe 10 minutes.) 

Sauteed mushrooms in a little olive oil and a couple of splahes of water to bring out the juices.  After adding the flour, I added a few tbsp. of lemon juice along with the stock to bring out more lemon flavor in the dish.  The gravy was great. 

Served with asparagus on the side.  Yum, and kids liked it too.

Great Recipe! I seasoned the chicken with some kosher salt, black pepper, granulated garlic and dried parsley.  Also, I used Dandy Meyer Lemons instead of regular lemons and this is what made the dish perfect!!  I doubled up the mushroom sauce too. This meal will be a regular at our dinner table

This is a good recipe, but I gave it only four stars because I had to alter it a bit.  As other reviewers suggested, it definitely needs seasoning.  I seasoned the chicken with lemon pepper seasoning and garlic powder before browning in the skillet.  Then finished off in the oven for 30 minutes.  I made the sauce and seasoned it too.  I used 1/4 c flour and the entire can of broth.  This made enough sauce for the 4 servings I made.  Served over brown rice.  Very tasty!

The recipe is a 10, but the way I cooked it was a 7.  I used way too much flour so my sauce was gravy-like, however it was very tasty.  I didnt season the chicken so it was plain looking. I served it with brown rice and fresh green beans.  Nice healthy meal after a gym workout. I like the pics of serving it in pasta! I will try that next time.

put the chicken on skillet until brown and cooked. Meanwhile on another pan, make the mushroom sauce using 2 cups of mushroom and 1/2 cup of chicken broth.

Not a terrible recipe, but it is VERY mushroom-y. So if you like to feel like you're devouring a giant pack of mushrooms, dig in. I think I turned into a fungus after eating this.

Awesome recipe.  I made some slight changes such as cutting the butter with olive oil for the mushroom sauce and adding salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste.  With no fresh parsley, I added dried parsley to the sauce in the broth stage.  I also used half the amount of chicken breasts.  The meat to sauce ratio was perfect.  The chicken could be drier inside but make sure to spoon some of the liquid onto the chicken before serving.  I also cut slits along the chicken breast to help with moisture.  The sauce is definitely what makes the dish here.

This was really delicious.  I cut the chicken down to 4 breasts cut in half, increased the flour to 1/4 C. and the broth to 1 can.  We had rice with it and like to have sauce over our rice.  I also added a sprinkle of rosemary to the sauce as it was cooking.  I cooked the chicken in the electric fry pan.  It browned up beautifully and made a nice rich sauce.  I will make this again.

Delicious recipe Joyce. Thanks! I used a full can of broth for extra sauce. I marinated the chicken in lemon juice and lots of garlic for a few hours. After reading other reviews, I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, salt and pepper. I blackened the chicken first, in a cast iron skillet, then laid a lemon slice on each and poured the marinade over them before putting the skillet in a 350 degree oven for about 18 minutes. The sauce is very good. This will become a regular in our house.

Wonderful! My husband and I love this dish. I top the chicken with extra lemon juice and zest before putting it into the oven, and I sometimes use a turkey baster while it cooks to redistribute the juices on/around the chicken. This gives the chicken an extra moist and lemony flavor.

Really good!  Using Naples 34102 suggestions, I rubbed the chicken breasts in the "Chicken Seasoning Blend" from this site.  I then seared them in olive oil on the stovetop, transferred to baking pan, poured the lemon juice over (with the lemon slices) and let it finish cooking in the oven while I made the sauce.  The pan had all of the flavorful brown bits from the chicken and seasoning which I cooked the mushrooms in, along with the butter.  Then I added the chicken broth with a tsp. of cornstarch, let it thicken up, and served it all over a bed of rice.  This recipe is a great starting point to add your own twist and be creative!

This sauce is pretty good even after I changed the recipe a little. I added a little bit of lemon juice because I love the taste of lemons. I also substituted flour for cornstarch. The sauce is pretty rich from all the butter, but tasty. I put it over pasta and it was really good!

Delicious and nearly foolproof! Added garlic when I sautéd the mushrooms, and I was sure to salt and pepper the chicken breasts thoroughly before baking. I used half chicken broth and half Cream of Chicken soup for the sauce (rather than add flour). Served over wide egg noodles, this was an amazingly simple, flavorful meal!

Very good - with some modifications.  I added a sprinkle of Italian seasoning, a pinch of thyme, salt, and pepper to the chicken.  I used the olive oil from the chicken with some butter and minced garlic to saute the mushrooms.  I also increased the juice - I used a 1/2 c of chicken broth and 1/3 c white wine.  Very flavorful way to prepare chicken!

I tried this one night when I felt like eating something really good... and this did not disappoint. I was rather surprised with the combination of the lemony chicken and savory mushroom sauce. When it was fresh out off the stove, it tasted as if it had been delivered from a restaurant. Did make some changes, basically the same as previous suggestions; added some garlic to the mushrooms, marinated the chicken in lemon and olive oil for a bit, and also seasoned the chicken with some Italian seasoning and Mrs. Dash. Lovely, but the amount of sauce should definitely be increased. Will make again.

This has the potential to be one of the best chicken dishes you'll make.  We just loved it.  Modifications: I put olive oil and 1/2 lemon, salt and pepper on the chicken breasts along with a little bit of thyme and parsley.  Next cut breasts in half or large pieces.  Sautee the chicken instead of baking -  with chopped shallot and a bit of onion in pan, as it cooks use a little bit of chicken broth later in the cooking to keep moist, keep from burning, but maintain the brown.  Used a combo of crimini mushrooms and white - about double what recipe calls for.  Used white wine (chardonnay), clove of garlic, other  1/2 lemon, salt, pepper, increased chicken broth in the mushrooms for the sauce.  Extra sauce makes the difference.  Served over rice with spinach. It's absolutely fabulous.

There was just something missing - can't figure it out. The chicken was tasty enough and moist but the sauce was gummy even after adding add'l broth and I had to add quite a few ingredients to make it have a decent flavor.

fantastic and very simple, i would suggest using at most half of the flour, the sauce was far too thick. the second time i made it i used only 2 teaspoons of flour and added some grated parmesean cheese to the sauce, turned out much better. oh and i minced the mushrooms, just a personal prefrence though.

This wasn't bad, but like many others, I need to tweak it.  Others complained it was too bland, but that was certainly not the case for us!  Hubby has an aversion to lemon, and so I tried to tone it down, but it was still waaaay too lemony for his liking, and even for mine (and I usually LOVE lemon).  Next time I am going to cut the lemon juice in half (or even less).  The mushroom sauce was good, but I need to tone it down too.  It had a very "robust" mushroom flavor and was almost too heavy a sauce for the dish.  (Would be awesome on a steak!!)  More chicken broth I think - it just needed some "diluting."  It was seasoned nicely though; I tossed in some salt, pepper, and a few dashes of lemon pepper and it was a good combo of seasonings.  I know what I need to do to make this the way we like it, but I wish it had turned out a little better the first time around.  Overall, not bad, but not nearly as impressive as I had hoped.

I did not follow the recipe as written, but reading the current reviews, it needed a lot of flavor profiles for enhancement.  I choose to follow those reviews and simplify the recipe for me.  I used 3 single chicken breasts, seared them for one minute in a skillet on each side, sprayed a nonstick cooking oil in a glass baking dish, then proceeded with cooking the sauce part in the pan.  I used about 1/4 of white wine to scrape the left-over chicken, added the butter, after that I added the mushrooms, added chicken broth as needed and then thickened with flour.  I ended up using 2 cups of chicken broth, 2 tbls of flour and 3/4 of a lemon. I poured the sauce over the chicken (to the sauce I added white pepper, lemon-pepper seasoning, basil, house seasoning, poultry seasoning, etc.) and baked at 400 for 25 mins or so.  I turned the broiler on high, added the parsley and put parmesan cheese on each chicken breast, broiled for 5 mins and it was great!

Pretty good. I cooked the chicken in a skillet and put it in the oven to keep it warm while I made the sauce. The changes I made are: Put salt, pepper, italian seasonings and garlic powder on the chicken before cooking it. Added minced garlic and white wine to the sauce.

My entire family loved this!  I didn't use the oil - but used parchment paper on a cookie sheet instead.  I used two lemons - 3/4 of one to squeeze over the chicken then cut the rest in thicker slices for each breast. The sauce I used 4 cups of sliced mushrooms fried in 1/4 cup butter, 1.5 cups water with 1 tbsp dry chicken stock, and 3 tbsp flour. Excellent! Our new favorite!

Very tasty! I did make the following changes - i added lemon pepper seasoning to the chicken which gave it that little extra splash of flavor.  I also added garlic to the mushroom sauce and used a full can of chicken broth to make more sauce. Turned out very well and was very simple - will make again

This recipe came out looking great. Contrary to some of the other reviewers my chicken did brown - and I did add more lemon like some of the others said too - the chicken came out really lemony and the combination with the mushroom sauce was superb - The mushroom sauce was excellent! I served it over rice and will definately make it again. The reason why I gave this recipe 4 stars was because the chicken could use a bit more pizzaz - maybe someone could come up with something - perhaps honey and mustard?

Wow, this was soooo good that my teenage son who doesn't like chicken ate 2 pieces!  I doubled the gravy, even for 4 pieces of chicken...glad I did because it was awesome.  Tasted great on potatoes also.  I added seasoning to the chicken along with the lemon juice and olive and cooked it in a George Foreman type grill for 10 minutes instead of baking. It cut the time down a bit and it was so incredibly moist. This is a definite keeper recipe, thumbs up from this family! Thank you Joyce! :)

I made this the other night and it was sooo good and easy, I was really impressed.  It definately tasted like a restaurant quality dish.  I only made it with 2 chicken breasts since it's just my husband and I, but I still made the same amount of sauce and it worked out great.  I would agree with the others to make more sauce if you use that much chicken, it is much too yummy to only have a little.

This was great! I had bought some chicken breast that were on sale this week, some asparagus and baby portabella mushrooms and was hoping to find a really good recipe where I could use everything I had bought. woolah The meal was a success, Thank you P.S. I did a simple lemon butter for the asparagus.

Thank you Joyce - We all loved this dish.  The lemon on the chicken works so well and that sauce - I don't just use it on chicken.  A wonderful family meal that is also fit for company.

Made this for my daughters new boyfriend who is a picky eater, (I wanted to impress, as his mother is an excellent cook!) It was very impressive and very delicious.  It was ready a bit early so I poured on the sauce and left in a warm oven, the chicken was very tender.  Next time I will try breading the chicken and browning before putting in the oven.

I used this recipe for friends who only eat chicken. I prepared the chicken ahead of time, and made the sauce while we were all together, including three small children. It was a big hit. Looks much more involved than it is. I decided to serve the mushroom sauce on the side.

My family (3 young adults and hubby)  found it 'boring' and only the mushroom gravy saved it. Cooking to 165 is too high and one ends up with dry, tough chicken. I pulled it at 155 to rest and it was still too dry. The next night I poured white wine over it to reheat and served it again to others. They saw the dryness but felt it was fine, they enjoyed the added flavor of the wine. I also had to add some wine to the gravy to thin it down. I am going to have to dig out my mom's old Lemon Chicken recipe from Sunset Magazine in the 1950s-60s. It had much more lemon character. BTW, the wine brought out the lemon character too. 
I made it with 12 breasts in an 11x17 glass baking dish. I used nearly 8+ cups of sliced mushrooms and extra broth for the gravy. I did enlarge the recipe on the site so everything should have been in proportion. I'd advise adding garlic if you like it.

I could not believe how amazing this turned out! I am an awful cook and this tasted like it was from a restaurant. I did salt and pepper the chicken before cooking it and also added garlic. Definitely going to make this again!

Changed a few things and made it so easy!  I used my cast iron pot, put the oil in turned the chicken once, added Mrs. Dash, garlic powder, salt and pepper, the juice of the lemon, half an onion sliced, and sliced fresh mushrooms.  Put on medium low on the stove for 30 minutes and it was very tasty and very moist and very low in calories!  Serve onto plates right from the pot and you have a gourmet meal!

Today I made the Baked Lemon Chicken with Mushroom Sauce.  I give it  a 5 star for taste, easy to make, not too many ingredients, easy to follow directions and how the dish looked after it cooked and I served. My family gave thumbs up and want it made again.  I promise the next time I will take a picture.   I followed the ingredients except I used vegetable broth because I didn't have chicken broth.

This is a great recipe with the right modifications. I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper. Then  I added 1 TBSP of minced garlic, and 1/2 TSP each of basil and oregano to the olive oil. I also added 1/4 TSP each of pepper and granulated garlic to the sauce itself. However, I only used 2 cups of mushrooms instead of 3 but it still seemed plentiful!!! 

If you follow the directions as given, THERE IS NO EXCUSE for too little sauce!!! I under-measured and still had extra sauce.  If you insist its the recipe and not you, please contact me for help!!

Mushrooms and chicken go really well together, and the sauce is fabulous.  Used shimeji mushrooms because that's what I had.  Took the advice of others and made extra sauce but added cooking sake (didn't have white wine) to the chicken stock.  Also seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  Tasty!  Will probably make again :)

This is a great recipe. Very easy to make. I cooked the chicken in a skillet instead of the oven. The sauce is delicious! My husband requests it almost every week.

This was a very quick and easy dinner that tasted high class with the mushroom sauce. Spices definitely need to be added, but it is delicious and went over well with my family of 6.

Loved it with the following modifications.
Kathy Green I made a few adjustments. Added apsaregus, shallots, garlic, oregano,salt and pepper. Left out the flour. Used chicken thighs that I cooked in the frying pan then popped under the broiler to brown them. This was very tasty. Served it with steamed buttered brocoli and a glass of wine. I told my 4 yr old it was lemonade chicken, she ate two servings.

Wonderfully easy.  I'm a terrible cook and this recipe was easy, quick and tasted great.   We eat it once a week and I make extra sauce to put over other things.  I stuck to the recipe and love it just the way it is.  I do keep any unused chicken broth handy until the meal is served because the mushroom sauce does thicken up pretty quickly.  Add chicken broth to thin out if needed.

Based on  other reviews, I seasoned the chicken first with salt, pepper, and onion powder. I added basil flakes, white wine and a couple of chopped up garlic cloves to the sauce. The chicken itself has a nice lemony flavor, but the sauce took it to another level. I brought this dish as my contribution to a group meal with 7 others and I got many compliments. It was easily the best dish on the table.

I think this is the best dish I've made yet! :) My fiance LOVED it. I made 4 chicken breasts, used 2 cups of broth, 3tbsp of butter, garlic, and sprinkled flour in to adjust the consistency of the sauce. I marinated the chicken 1 hour before, squeezing a whole lemon and using olive oil. I used another 1/2 lemon on the chicken in the pan and cut up slices to lay on top. DELICIOUS!!

The mushroom sauce was really good on its own, ,but overall could barely eat it. I was amazed at all the good reviews, the lemon and mushroom flavors really dont blend well at all.  This is the first highly rated recipe ive made so far on allrecipes that was bad.

I prepared this in a skillet, as described in Naples' review. I used chicken tornadoes (chicken processed into a round wrapped in bacon) that I dredged in seasoned flour (used CC's all purpose seasoning blend recipe) then lightly browned in the skillet. I then added the juice of a whole lemon (this was a tad too much- would use the amount in the recipe next time and add lemon zest as suggested in the recipe submitter's review), tossed in the the used lemon (cut into sections) then lowered the temperature, covered with a lid and cooked 10 minutes per side. Chicken was juicy, bacon portion was cooked (not crispy) but not chewy and the aroma was lovely. For the sauce I added the mushrooms into the skillet (removed the chicken and set aside to keep warm) with a dab of butter then let it cook down. Added the garlic and let cook until fragrant. Instead of chicken broth I used watered down Ouzo as a sub for white wine which would have been excellent in this. I let it reduce then added butter to thicken. I did need to use a little flour (maybe 2 tsps.) to get it to the right consistency. Very good! Served this with "Barley Mushroom Risotto" from AR.

Chicken was very good! I think it could have had more flavor though. I did add garlic powder and salt/pepper, but next time I may add some paprika too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

It was good, but not as flavorful as I would of liked. Maybe searing prior would of tasted better. Not a bad meal with noodles and vegetables.

This is a great base - but it needed a little more flavor - I used a chicken seasoning and additional garlic. Nice dinner servied with rice and roasted brussel sprouts.

Nice recipe.  I did add garlic to the mushrooms (2 small cloves minced).  Other than that I followed the recipe.  My wife thought it was excellent - so did I.

Absolutely outstanding...my husband hasn't stopped talking about this great dish for 2 days.  I used fresh basil instead of parsley...since that's what I had on hand...loved it.  Would probably double the recipe for the sauce next time.

Was really good! I cooked the chicken on the stove and doubled the sauce which I did add some onions, garlic, salt and pepper to it. Served with rice, and turned out great! Thanks!

I made a vegetarian version of this :) Using "Gardein" (Garden Protein) "Chick'n Scallopini" (frozen vegetable section of the grocery store) I followed the recipe exactly, except for the oven time which is just about perfect at 10 minutes. It actually took longer to make the creamy sauce than it took to have the "chick'n" out of the oven. Next time I will add more lemon juice. Served it up with asparagus risotto and steamed cauliflower = Happy Family of Men

solid 4. Very good, but nothing amazing. I did season my chicken a little but other than that stayed true. Sauce was a little too buttery for my taste.

This recipe was so delicious.  I did season my chicken with salt and pepper along with the other ingredients and the zest.  I think the zest gives the chicken a more lemony flavor.   I also seared the chicken before finishing it up in the oven. I definitely will be making this again.

I was looking for a recipe for some boneless chicken breasts I had and found this one.  Seemed simple enough with simple ingredients.  Well, OMG, this was really delicious!!  My husband said it tasted like something you would get at a restaurant!  I did cook the chicken in a skillet, added some garlic power to the chicken and the sauce.  I used a whole can of chicken broth and added another tablespoon of  flour.  I was really skeptical my family would like it, but it was a hit!!

We loved this dish!  I made it with only three chicken breasts but didn't drecrease the sauce.  Chicken broth is generally high in sodium so I lightly salted & peppered the chicken as other reviewers suggested.  I also sprinkled a little garlic powder.  My husband says it's a keeper!  I'll be passing it along to my son (25) who loves to cook.

Excellent recipe when tweaked a little.   Here's what I did: Browned 3 boneless chicken breast in skillet, making sure to add some seasonings (Garlic powder, salt, and pepper).  When browned I added about 3/4 cup lemon juice, covered, and simmered until juices ran clear and liquid was absorbed completely.  This made a nice glaze over the chicken; it was sooo good! When making the sauce, I used 1 cup of chicken broth, and found that I needed more than a sprinkle of flour to thicken, but I had plenty of sauce.  Also, I added more garlic powder to sauce, we love garlic in my house.  Instead of using the sauce over chicken, I added it to egg noodles and placed chicken on top.  Turned out wonderful.

this is a goody. I stuck to the recipe except I threw in about 3 tbsp pinot grigio to the mushrooms( all the wine left in the bottle) . I also covered it and left it on the stovetop about 15 min instead of the oven. I used chicken thighs and it was delicious. My 5 year old and hubber loved it. Served it with fresh asparagus and capellini

Wow!  This dish was wonderful.  Of course, with some modifications...  It's very easy to make it your own though.  I used 2 chicken breasts and made the same amount of sauce.  (I wish I had made more.  Next time I will!)  Drizzled olive oil over the breasts, then seasoned them with lemon pepper, salt, and italian seasoning; then squeezed half a lemon over the top, and let them sit in it for about 30 minutes.  I put them in the skillet and browned both sides and squeezed another half lemon over the top and spinkled more seasoning, before covering to finish (just as the original poster suggested).  I made the sauce exactly as suggested except I also threw in minced garlic with the mushrooms, and used rosemary instead of parsley.  I also subbed chicken stock for broth.  The sauce was divine!  My husband lovvvvved it.  Will be making for years to come.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

This makes an excellent transition to the grill!  What I did: I pounded 4 large chicken breasts to about 1/2 inch, sprinkled both sides with garlic powder, seasoned salt, and pepper.  Next I "layered" the marinade- drizzle of olive oil followed by chicken breast, squeezed half a lemon over, another drizzle of olive oil, next chicken breast, etc.  I marinaded the chicken for about an hour in that fashion.  For the sauce I used 16 oz, sliced mushrooms, 1/4 c. butter, more garlic powder and seasoned salt, bit of pepper and a sprinkle of parsley.  I used about 3 Tbs. flour, added a whole can of chicken broth and splashed in some white wine- about 1/2 c.  I grilled the chicken breasts (they smelled AWESOME on the grill!) then placed them on the sauce.  I topped each chicken piece with several thin slices of lemon and let the whole thing simmer for about 15 minutes.  The chicken was amazing in flavor and tenderness.  I will definitely use this "marinade" for grilled chicken again- even without the mushroom sauce!

I modified this recipe a lot- but all for the better! No need to marinate chicks- just throw them in a skillet with about a 1/4 cup butter/margerine, a 1/4 cup EVOO and half a lemon squeezed, then cut into slices and laid over/under chicken. Cover each piece of chicken with a couple shakes of onion powder, garlic salt, oregano and thyme and a generous round of course ground pepper. Splash in a 1/2 cup dry white wine. Cook chicken until juices are clear-aka-cooked thru, and remove chicks from the pan. Add a grocery store bunch of asparagus cut into two inch pieces and begin browning them in the sauce...you may need to add another splash of white wine, and a couple tblspoons of butter if the sauce is low. Add mushrooms and cover until juices start flowing from the shrooms. Sprinkle the flour, stir it up, add the chick broth and simmer for a few. Stir in the parsley (italian is best) And...you're done! I served this up with a nice and cheap mushroom risotto- Also saved the rest of the bunch of Italian parsley, mixed it up with some mixed greens squeezed a bit of lemon, olive oil and salt and pepper, a few kalamata olives and a bit of feta for a refreshing starter salad! Enjoy!

This could be a 5 star recipe with the following changes.  First the lemon is completely lost in this dish so if you are looking for a strong lemon flavor this one wont take you there.  Next time I will brown the chicken with salt, pepper and herbs.  The sauce was good, but very bland.  I added salt and pepper.  If your using a cheapo chicken stock that has a lot of salt in it you may not need the salt, but I used a good organic stock.  I served this over spelt and it was good.  I will make this again with changes thanks for sharing Joyce.

Loved loved loved it! You will need another lemon to be sliced. Also, definitely start with the 1/2 cup of chicken broth, but I think you'll end up needing more. I used almost a full can. I also lightly seasoned the chicken with kosher salt and coarse black pepper before putting the lemon slices on. A restaurant quality dish that was superb!!! Will definitely make again. Oh, and I served it with brown rice and roasted asparagus. Delish!!!!

love the recipe for the chicken, i did add garlic, salt and pepper. the mushroom sauce was very bland and too thick. i will try using white wine next time and using less flour.

Wonderful! Followed suggestion to marinate in a bag with olive oil, lemon juice, poultry spice, italian seasoning, thyme, salt, pepper, garlic powder. Left 24 hrs in fridge. Baked them for 40 min with a couple of min. on Broil after to brown them.  Only thing I might do next time is to score the breasts with a knife to soak up the marinade better.

This dish is delicious, flavorful, and  a crowd pleaser.  The lemon gives the dish a nice added flavor.  I used thinly sliced chicken breasts so that the cooking time is slightly reduced.  This has become a family favorite.

I thought the chicken itself was very bland and even with the lemon, lacking flavor. The only redeeming part of this recipe was the mushroom sauce, which I thought was quite good.

Loved this recipe, but made a few changes.  1)  Pan browned the chicken in olive oil.  2) I found the sauce a little bland, so I added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and dried rosemary to taste (I'm a freak for rosemary).  It was perfect.  My husband raved. 3) Once the chicken browned, I squeezed 1/2 of a large lemon over it and covered it with slices cut from the other half.  I tossed in some fresh asparagus, sprinkled a little kosher salt over it, covered it and steamed the asparagus.   Lip smacking good!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was awesome after adding some spices, i followed the directions of others and added minced garlic to each breast and seasoning salt, and little bit of italian seasoning as well. As for the sauce i added a dash of seasoning salt to the shrooms as well. Perfect.

Very flavorful. I cut the amount of chicken used in half, but increased the other ingredients. I used an entire lemon's worth of juice, and let it marinate for almost 2 hours, then sliced up another lemon to put on top of the chicken chunks while they baked. It turned out extremely juicy and with a STRONG lemon flavor, so beware if you're not a big lemon fan. Also, I doubled the amount of sauce (and added garlic, white wine, and some crushed red pepper) and it still wasn't quite enough sauce. But the sauce tasted EXCELLENT.

We all really enjoyed this dish. The first time I made it I followed the recipe almost exactly except I used 1 whole cut up chicken. It was good but needed more spices. The next time I made it I used 2 lemons, garlic, salt & freshly ground pepper, poultry seasoning, and topped the chicken pieces with either coconut oil or a slice of butter (sometimes both). The mushroom sauce needs no tweaking and it's simply delicious with the chicken!

I made this exactly as is but I didn't use any parsley.  The dish is great but is a bit bland.  I think it's a great base, and I will make it again with a few changes next time to add more flavor.

The was really good, glad I read the reviews and doubled the sauce.  However I still found the chicken broth needed to be doubled again! I used a skillet instead, turned out really well.

Hmmm, I don't know. Sauce consistency was kind of slimy (and I added more broth). I had to add quite a bit more seasoning and lemon juice to the sauce before the flavor was anything but bland. Not my favorite meal by a long shot. If you want a basic lemon chicken dish this will do. But, it will take quite a bit of substitution.

This was a really great recipe! I also added white cooking wine. I seasoned the chicken with lemon ck seasoning and Thyme. I also added a bit of lemon to the actual sauce and fresh cilantro. The cilantro makes a big difference and adds an extra tangy kick. Excellent!

Very tasty, very easy to make.  I made it before my husband left for work and we had enough time to eat together.  Like another reviewer, I'd double or at least increase the sauce--I made mine with four boneless breasts instead of six and it was just enough.  Very good flavor and as I said, very easy to make.  I used low sodium chicken broth since I find refular to be way too salty.

I just use the sauce. It's great. I use another recipe that has a lemon marinade and grill the chicken. We love to grill and this sauce is a great topping to grilled lemon chicken breasts.

I used Lemon Curd instead of lemon juice and added diced garlic. Really lemony with a nice thick sauce.
I also used boneless chicken breasts , pounded them flat and then layer them in a baking dish with the sauce on bottom, in between and on top. Garnished with chopped green onion, stalk included.

This was good.  I spiced it up a bit and added garlic like the other reviews suggested.  Added the juice from the chicken to the sauce.  Will probably brown the chicken next time.  Will make it again.

The taste of lemony chicken and mushrooms was wonderful to taste.  This dish is simple and delicious.  It was fast to prepare and cook, to boot!

i followed reviewers advice and went easy on the lemon.  Unfortunately, I think that was a mistake because it was very bland.  It tasted like I baked the chicken with a can of mushroom soup. Wouldn't make again....

Pretty unspectacular recipe. I did sear the chicken breasts and finished them in the oven which kept them nice and juicy. Used wine/broth mixture instead of just broth. If I use recipe again I will certainly add some herbs -- probably rosemary. This really didn't have much flavor.

Very good recipe. I used half chicken broth/half wine. I doubled the sauce and put it over fettucine.

Very good!  I cooked the chicken in a skillet before baking as suggested by other reviewers. This brought my baking time down to about 18-20mins.  Mushroom sauce was excellent! Also doubled sauce as suggested. Will definitely make again.

In order to let the chicken soak up more lemon flavor, we cut it into smaller pieces before putting it in a caserole pan with a little olive oil on the bottom (we also coated the chicken pieces with the oil).  We then squeezed a whole lemon's juice over the chicken, so that the juice was about 1/2 inch deep in the dish, and left the squeezed lemon slices in the casserole to bake with the chicken.  We had green onions, so we chopped those up and sprinkled them on too.  Finally, we covered the dish with foil while baking.  It turned out pretty nice, and the lemon flavor was pleasantly strong.

I added a little cream in at the end to make the sauce even creamier and it was great.  Just the right amount of balance with the sour of the lemon and the creaminess of the sauce.

I can never be bothered to bake chicken as it takes too long, so I cut the chicken into bite-size pieces and browned them in olive oil. Then I added the mushrooms (I used chestnut mushrooms for the extra flavor), and when they were soft added the broth. I thought the sauce was a little bland so I seasoned it with lemon pepper. Finally, I had some half-and-half that needed using up, so I mixed it with the cornstarch to thicken. Served it over angel hair pasta. Superb recipe. Really delicious! Thanks, Joyce!

I got this recipe from the new cookbook.  I wish I would have read the suggestions before trying it.  My husband asked that I not make it again and he usually likes to try new dishes.  It was very bland.  I may try it again adding garlic (lots) and increasing the lemon and parsley.  It has potential - but as written it did not have enough flavor for our family.

This was easy. I rated it a 4 because I think the recipe has potential. I increased broth to 1 cup, added 1/2 cup white wine and 4 garlic cloves. It was good but I felt it lacked flavor. I am going to keep playing around with it.

Very good and elegant meal! The chicken never "browned" like I would have hoped (it looked as if I boiled it instead of baking it) and I needed a little more liquid to get the mushroom "sauce" to the right consistency (at which time I added some white wine) but overall, the taste was excellent!  I only used 5 chicken breasts with just barely enough sauce so I may go with only 4 breasts next time or double the sauce should I make 6. Still, thank you Joyce for the great meal!

This recipe is SO good that I am going to write another review.  I make this all of the time with very few changes.  One thing that I do do is when the chicken comes out of the oven, I pour the juices from the chicken into the mushroom gravy.  This gives the gravy the lemony taste from the chicken which is excellent.  I serve this with couscous and it is wonderful.  My husband and 4 year old daughter love this recipe - so do I!

This is one of my favorite dishes. The chicken comes out so nice and lemony and the mushroom sauce really gives a complimenting taste.  Very nice.  Although, I still haven't figured out how to get the mushroom sauce not so lumpy.  That was the only challenge for me.

This was a good dish.  My husband liked it, too.  I used half the chicken but still made a whole sauce recipe, which I think was a good move--we really like sauce.  I served it over basmati rice with peas and roasted cumin seeds that was left over from something my husband made, and I served sauteed cabbage on the side.  It made an excellent meal.

This recipe is fantastic.  I've made it twice -- once using white cooking wine and once with chicken stock.  The chicken stock version rocks!  It's so easy to make -- thanks for a great recipe.

Great recipe, just made a few small tweaks to better suit my family's tastes. Before baking, I seasoned oiled chicken breasts with a citrus lemon herb blend I make myself as well as a good bit of black pepper and some salt for more flavour. I used double the mushrooms, as well as salt, pepper, and a tsp of lemon juice in the sauce. I also used more broth than stated, as we like a very "saucy" sauce. So easy to make, and my boyfriend raved about how great it was the whole meal, thanks! ??

This chicken recipe is perfect as is.  The chicken has a true lemon taste and the mushroom sauce compliments it perfectly.

Amazing!!   I seasoned the chicken with garlic salt, pepper, onion powder, red pepper and marinated it for an hour in olive oil and lemon juice.  I seasoned the flour with lemon pepper, seasoned salt, and garlic powder.  I browned the chicken and baked in the oven for approx 30 minutes.  While it was baking. I added a while can of chicken broth and squeezed a lemon to deglaze the pan, added the mushrooms and a pat of butter.  I took out the chicken and let it soak in the yummy sauce to thicken it up and moisten the breasts.  I added capers near the end and served with garlic linguini.  Yummy!

I made this for my family last night and they loved it! As I do with every recipe, I did tweak this a tad. I added some fresh garlic, onion, tarragon, marjoram and white wine to the mushroom sauce, and I threw some pepper and garlic salt on the chicken after coating it with the oil.

I  will definitely be making this again!!!

I used lemon juice- no lemons- also coated the chicken with garlic infused olive oil, sprinkled with garlic powder, salt, pepper, dill weed and lemon pepper. Baked 40 minutes, added salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the mushroom sauce (doubled the sauce) and dried parsley. Served over jasmine rice cooked in chicken stock and lemon juice, pepper and peas. Served alongside a spinach salad. Delicious!

I made it a little different than the recipe. I added poultry rub and salt to the chicken breast, than added the lemon juice and lemon slices and baked it. For the sauce I added chopped onion and garlic, than I added the mushrooms and flour sautéed it a bit than I added a half cup of white wine and a cup of chicken broth. When chicken was done I poured the sauce over it and served it over linguine. It was Delicious!

This was yummy, baking the chicken keeps it tender and moist. I did follow some of the added seasoning, and all above ingredients as listed for sauce, can accommodate 2 large or 4 small chicken breasts, extra sauce is good. I did deglaze the mushrooms with a 3/4 C of white wine...Delish! a keeper.

Very easy to make and healthy.  I pounded the chicken breast halves and used sliced baby portobello mushrooms instead of regular ones.  The chicken came out super tender.  We loved it!

this was a little lemony for my taste buds. But and excellent choice if you love lemon : ) flavored chicken. I tasted very pure and fresh. I made the recipe exactly as stated but added olive oil and ms dash per the other recommendations.

I seasoned the chicken and even put garlic in the mushroom sauce yet it was still pretty bland. If I were to make it again I think I would put more lemon on the chicken. I also don't think the sauce really needs all that flour. It was way to thick and I put in a lot of chicken broth!

Came out great! The sauce for me came out a little more gel like than creamy though. Maybe a little less flour needed to be used. Either way super yummy and a new favorite!

This was great, the gravy was really delicious.  Added a little seasoning to the chicken and cooked it in the skillet before making the gravy, which I added a little green onion and garlic to.  Superb, thanks for sharing!

This was a really good recipe. The only change that I made was that I added a little salt and pepper and browned it in a skillet before placing it in the oven with the remaining ingredients.  Very tasty and not overpowering with lemon.

This recipe was good. I had to tweak the it some because my family doesn't really like the lemon flavor.  I cooked the chicken in white wine and the extra chicken stock I didn't need for the mushroom sauce. The chicken was very flavorful and juicy. I will be making this again.

A big hit! Just a couple of recommendations......could not fit 6 chicken breasts into an 8 x 8 pan, did a quick browning step in a frying pan first with some garlic and a little spice, used the same pan with the brown 'bits' to fry the mushrooms and make the sauce, squeezed extra lemon juice over the chicken before putting in the oven and squeezed more into the mushroom sauce for a bit more tang. If sauce gets too thick add a bit more chicken broth/stock. Delicious and very moist & tender!

I followed directions and didn't tweak at all. It was ok but very bland. I think you could adjust the recipe to add a lemon pepper marinade and lots of garlic then grill instead of bake.

This was really good!  Read a few reviews first and added poultry seasoning and salt and pepper and prepared on the stovetop...  Didn't have any mushrooms so used onions.  Omitted parsley since I didn't have any.  Served with sauteed kale and rice.  Super easy, fast, yummy dinner with ingredients I always have on hand!

This was absolutely fabulous! I added a minced shallot and 1/3 cup of dry white wine, a smidge of salt and pepper and a couple sprigs of fresh thyme instead of parsley.  Over a bed of steamed spinach with some squeezed lemon, it was heavenly. Thank you Joyce!

So tasty and moist when I marinaded it overnight with  Chicken Seasoning Blend. I also cooked it in a skillet and it was very moist, served it with dense bread to soak up the gravy. Very good recipe, thanks for sharing!

This is simply delicious!  I did change things up a bit: I marinated the chicken in lemon juice, poultry seasoning, garlic, and basil.  Then I cooked the chicken in a skillet in olive oil (I like my chicken brown!); removed cooked chicken to a pyrex dish where I squeezed lemon juice over each breast.  Then saute the mushrooms in butter in the same skillet; add flour, chicken broth and a splash of white wine.  Pour over the chicken breasts and keep covered until ready to serve.  I sprinkled with fresh parsley at the last minute.  I made this for ten people (had never made it before) and everyone raved about it!

One of my favorite recipes, with extra seasoning that is. I bake it as directed or sometimes I cook it on top of the stove. I usually cut the breasts into large, thin, medallions, shake them in a plastic bag with seasoned flour. I cook quickly in 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil. Then add the mushrooms and saute for a few minutes. Then I add lemon and about 1 cup of chicken broth. The flour I shook the chicken in thickens it all to make a nice sauce and I usually serve it with rice. Yum!

Made this about a week ago. Obviously, I HAD to salt, pepper and garlic powder the chicken breasts.  I added a little wine to the mushrooms,  increase the amount of mushrooms and sauce.  Pounded the chicken to 1/4 in. Spread mushrooms on check breasts, rolled,  baked until done,  when completed I poured the mushroom/wine sauce over chicken breasts, and it was fabulous.  My husband liked it much better than my chicken cordon blu.  I did too!!  This is how I cook.  Get ideas from you guys, modify to our tastes and voila!!!  Tip is to have lots of staples and spices.  Doesn't help that I have a Spice and Cheese Import deli!!!

I liked it, but it needed fixing up,  I cooked in a skillet too and used seasoning.  I had girolles which I cooked with a little garlic, put in a little flour and chicken broth and white wine.  I like lemon things, but I put in some thick sour cream at the end.  In other words I more or less changed the whole thing.

I've made this a couple of times thinking that I was going to like it each time and am just really disappointed by it every time.  There is a really bitter taste to the sauce and the only part of the chicken that has any lemon flavor is the part that was in direct contact with the lemon while cooking.

Both my husband and myself really enjoyed this, although we did use a recommendation from a fellow review; use the Chicken Seasoning Blend recipe from this web-site too.  Overall it was good and we will be making it again!

Was very good. I used GF flour in the mushroom sauce, tasted like it wasn't GF! THough next time I'll make sure to use organic chicken (used chicken wings and not the regular kind - because of the antibiotic taste which almost ruined it for me.

Maybe it was me but I did not care for this....  I marinated the chicken like I was advised in the comments.... I thought it lacked flavor and spunk....  I actually grilled half of the chicken to see if  the pan was the issue and that turned out worse...  It is always a possibility that though I followed directions to a T I still did it wrong but I honestly don't think that's the case...  No offense to the recipe maker of this one but I just did not care for it.

The recipe is a 5 star if you just tweak the recipe a little. The chicken breast must be seasoned I used salt and pepper and a little extra poultry seasoning. I cooked the chicken in a sauté pan so it could brown and I also used some fresh rosemary in the pan and squeezed some lemon juice on top.  The mushroom were easy just use the same pan the chicken cooked in, and the butter and salt and pepper. Once they brown I added a splash of white wine and some more lemon juice. And the end throw in some fresh parsley. It came out amazing. I served with roasted brussel sprouts and glazed rainbow carrots. Everyone loved it!

So disappointed!  I am shocked at the ratings this dish received.  It was very bland and boring.  I ended up adding garlic salt, pepper, rosemary, and more lemon juice too!  I had to do this so that the dish wasn't wasted!

This is a really good recipe. I thought I would be adventurous for dinner and found this wasn't very hard at all and was a great tasting meal. The lemon was a really nice acidic counter to the mushrooms! I chose green beans and chef salad -meat for sides. Can't wait for the "Death By Chocolate" desert that I'm working on now!

Great recipe!  I try to modify when a lot of recipes to GF so I used 2 tsp of potato starch as a thickener instead of flour.  I also used a whole lemon when I baked the chicken and threw in some lemon rind to kick the citrus up a notch.  I also used 1 tsp of the rind in the mushroom sauce to complement everything - it went in with the chicken stock.  To add, I used about 1 Tbsp of butter and 1 Tbsp of olive oil vs the 1/4 cup butter - looking for it to be a little lighter.  Complemented the dish with a side of asparagus steamed with the rind and atop couscous - delicious!!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

I used a cast iron skillet to brown the chicken and cut the cooking time in the oven in half. I also added salt and pepper and a touch of garlic powder to the breasts. I like the flavors but the breasts were still a bit dry. I think next time I'll use bone-in chicken breasts or even chicken thighs, taking a tip from the Chinese.

I enjoyed the mushroom sauce but did not taste any lemon after it baked.  The sauce was bland so I added some salt, wine and more chicken stock because the sauce became too thick after adding the flour.

I marinated the 2 chicken breasts in one juiced lemon and sauteed them, cut horizontally in half in butter, with the juice.  Added some flat champagne and cooked everything down with a little butter.  Used Lime Pepper to season. Cooked the mushrooms in the remaining sauce and poured over the chicken with the zest from the lemon.  Was very easy and a nice meal.  Will use it again

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars! I recently started cooking for my boyfriend and I stumbled upon this recipe. It's super easy to make, considering I'm new to the cooking thing, and super tasty! He really enjoyed it because it was really good. I made mashed red potatoes and fresh cut green beans as a side. DELICIOUS!  The only thing I would change would be to double the sauce. I changed the portions to two and I needed to add a lot of chicken broth to make it saucy instead of a gravy... Nonetheless, it was great!

I just used this recipe as a sort of stencil:  I marinated the chicken for an hour in about half the juice of a lemon, a teaspoon of thyme, one large clove of garlic and a few tablespoons of olive oil and some lemon rind.  I cooked the chicken the same way.  I made the sauce with four cups of mushrooms and a half stick of butter.  I then added about a half cup of chicken broth, the juice of one lemon, about half a teaspoon of thyme and a clove of garlic.  I brought it to a boil and then simmered and reduced it.  Even my brother who hates chicken really liked. I'll definitely make this again!

The lemon flavor in the chicken was excellent! However the mushroom sauce ruined the dish in my opinion. I would leave the sauce out and just have he mushrooms sauteed. I also the like the chicken in the pan better than in the stove. The chicken gets 5 stars but the mushroom sauce brought it down to three.

I did not like it with the lemon cooked on top of the chicken. It was too much lemon. I also added a can of cream of mushroom soup to the chicken about ten minutes before it was done. It gave it a little more flavor other than the lemon.

This was soo simple and had a nice flavor. My husband wasn't thrilled about the lemon taste, but he liked the mushroom sauce very much and it was a great combo.  I did sprinkle the chicken with some season-all before cooking. We all agreed we would eat this dish again. I served this with AR lemon dill rice and a green salad. This is fancy enough to serve to guests but really no work at all. Thanks for the nice dinner recipe. We enjoyed this.

Great dish! I used the modified version found under custom versions by the chef. Only thing I added was garlic, garlic salt and pepper. AND I used salmon instead of chicken and it still came out great.  It was delish. Def using this in the future :)

this is a good recipe! I added some fresh ground black pepper to the chicken before putting in the oven. The chicken was moist and had good flavor. The best part about this recipe is the mushroom sauce!!! I will use this recipe again. When I make this again, I will broil the chicken or saute it first to brown it up as I like my chicken browned.

Needed a recipe to use up some thawed chik breast & low and behold this was the recipe posted on the main page yesterday.  I gave it four stars only because I had to add seasoning as I felt the recipe was somewhat bland.  I also (like some others) cooked everything in a skillet vs. using the oven.  I would definitely make this again!  Hubby loved it as well! :)

Cut chicken breast into cubes and marinated in lemon juice, olive oil, parsley, poultry seasoning, lemon pepper, garlic, onion powder.  Didn't want to use the oven when its 90 degrees outside!  Pan fried in olive oil.  Removed.  Sauteed mushrooms, garlic, onions in EVOO and white wine.  Added broth, lemon juice, 1/2 lemon rinds (thought all of the zest would be overpowering), noodles.  After cooking completion, threw in chicken, cooked broccoli, and a shot of 1/2 and 1/2.  Would definitely make again.  Very nice.  Would probably use some grated lemon zest next time.

5 stars because it was simple, easy and delicious.  Not overly seasoned - pure flavor.  I only substituted dried parsley.  My advice is to cook the sauce about 10 minutes before serving.  It cooks fast and it will get a film on top, but it is a disolveable film which is nice.... I served it with chicken flavored rice and asparagus.

MeH..the chicken didn't really have any taste to it if it weren't for the mushroom sauce. maybe next time, i'll marinade the chicken in the lemon juice and then bake it. MAYBE..not too excited about it to make again.

In addition to the original recipe, I used portabello mushrooms, onions, one full cup of chicken broth and a dash of white wine to make the sauce. My husband absolutely loved it!! It was a great dish!  Another note, the more lemon the merrier!

This was a quick and tasty dish. Both my daughter and I liked it; my husband, not so much. The sauce was a tad bland. White wine would have been the perfect addition but, since I didn't have any, I added some lemon juice instead. I would definitely make this again.

I made this for my girlfriends and I because we are trying to create healthier meals when we hang out. We loved it. We needed more sauce but there was just enough lemon taste and the chicken was moist. I prefer my chicken to have a crispy crust so next time I probably will cook it all in the skillet. Great meal though.

Excellent! We loved this dish. As others suggested, I seasoned the chicken using lemon juice, lemon pepper and garlic salt. Then I browned it for a few minutes on each side in a skillet. Then transferred it to the oven to cook at 350 for 35 mins. I just used the same skillet to saute the mushrooms and a few onions (added) and it was great!

Great dish for anyone who loves mushrooms! Like other reviews I read, I used a skillet instead of the oven. I didn't have any lemons on hand so I ended up using 3 Tablespoons of Lemon Juice, which I added after the chicken had browned a bit. I put a lid on the skillet and let the chicken cook on med/low heat until my mushroom sauce was done! Sauce came out great!

YUMMMMMMMMM!!!!! This is very good. I just took a little taste and I can tell we are gonna enjoy our dinner today. Chicken very very moist so much that it squirted out at me when I sliced the chicken breast. I did however seasoned the breast with pepper, salt and garlic after i had tossed them in oil and at the end added the lemon juice. I also sauteed a shallot and a small whole garlic clove with the mushrooms and added just a 1/2tsp of salt. I cant waith until my hubby gets here from work so we can have dinner. Smells great!!!

It was a very good recipe - however, I doubled the gravy. The original recipe just wasn't enough. Also - I wished there was more of a lemon flavor to the original chicken. But, all in all, a very good recipe!

I LOVE this recipe. I started making it last year and it is so easy for a college student to make! I found the chicken did not get enough flavor so I let it sit in lemon juice with garlic and other herbs for a while (once about a day when i was busy) that with the added fresh lemon on top while it is baking. I took the advice of others and used white wine along with chicken broth. I have also used the mushroom sauce for multiple other dishes. I have added various veggies to it and eaten it with pasta and it takes amazing. This is one of my college diet staples.

The sauce was out of this world!!  Without the sauce, the chicken had little to no flavor even though I used double the lemon juice plus zest.

Delicious!  I just used a saute pan.  Added a fair amount of white wine, garlic, basil, oregano, rosemary and thyme to the mix.  Also added 1/2 an onion.  Will absolutely make again!

After reading the reviews I used the pan method instead of the oven. But I think for me, the for me the oven may have been better. I think the mushroom sauce was good, but did need something. I am thinking maybe some cream or something. I liked it and so did my husband...he did not care for the lemon part so much, so I might cut back on the lemon. But over all, it was good. I will tweek it a bit and see what I can make of it.

The flavor of this was delicious, and the mushroom sauce was really easy to make and adjust thickness. However, I overcooked the chicken using this recipe. Next time I might lower the temperature.

Awesome! I cooked in the skillet like the author resubmitted in a recent comment. I used lime instead of lemon and doubled or tripled the mushroom sauce. I also seasoned both the chicken and the mushroom sauce with salt, pepper and rosemary. I should have used more lime because when I squeezed some on the cooked chicken breast before adding the mushroom mixture it was amazing! Sometimes I use lemon like the recipe calls for, sprinkle the breasts lavishly with organic seasoning, use garbanzo bean flour instead of regular white flour and plenty of White Zinfandel. This is an amazingly delicious recipe.

I marinated the chicken in the olive oil and lemon in addition to thyme for an hour prior to cooking.  I prepared the chicken (3 breasts) in the skillet as other suggested to brown the chicken.  I added a little chicken stock to the bottom to keep the chicken moist.  For the sauce I doubled it as others suggested, however for 3 breasts it was too much, for 6 it would have been fine.  I used 2 toes of garlic, probably could have used 4.  I also added thyme and white wine to the sauce which made it a little more tasty.  Overall, easy to prepare and yummy.

I liked this pretty well.  I found it to be a little on the boring side and so did my husband. Although, it is a fairly healthy dish (I cut down on the butter some). Next time, I will add a lot more lemon juice (I'll add it to the mushroom gravy as well).  Capers would be nice too.  I was missing some tang.  Worth a try though.

Had a good flavor.  I added garlic powder, salt and pepper to the chicken before I baked it and I think that helped.

This was not my favorite.  It was okay but not what I expected.  It is a more bland dish and my huband and I thought it could use a lot more flavor.

This was really very tasty.  I think the taste was too sophisticated for my 9 year old, but my husband and I, and my toddler, loved it.  I am looking forward to having this in my regular rotation.

I made this recipe, but added 3TBS of flour instead of 2. Then I added about 3/4-1cup of Pinot Grigio to the sauce. It was fabulous!

Had a refusal to eat from DH on this one, he said he didn't like it at all. I thought the sauce was great (served it with rice) but the chicken just didn't work for me. The lemon flavor was there just enough to seem odd tasting but not enough to think "yum, lemon".

I found this recipe about two years ago, and we absolutely love it! (Even the next day as left overs!)  I always double the sauce, and sometimes double the lemon.  I also have tried it with and with-out the white wine.  Both ways are excellent, so if I have some, I add it, if not that's ok too.  As a side note, we've found that asparagus is a PERFECT side dish, and tastes awesome with the sauce.

Delicious!  I took the advice of others and mixed a little chicken stock with white wine for the sauce.  Used Wondra to thicken it up.  I also browned in a little EVOO and then stuck it in the oven for about 20-25 min...came out so good!

Takes a little bit of time and precision to correctly cook, but its pretty  easy if you know what youre doing. I am a relatively new cook, and I have cooked this successfully three or  four times. Very tasty too, and good for leftovers.

This was delicious! The chicken came out great and the mushroom sauce was very tasty. I did what some other reviewers suggested and added some chopped garlic I also added some chopped green onions. This was a very good recipe.

A nice change for chicken. Very flavorful and juicy. It was so tender-fork tender, as well. My grandma doesn't usually like chicken that isn't fried, but she loved this. She even had seconds! Even my beef-only husband mentioned it was "pretty good". That means a lot coming from him! I made more of the mushroom sauce to serve over potatoes, and it went over very well also. A new favorite. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was so delicious and so easy.  I used 3 chicken breasts, but didn't reduce anything else, so I had lots of yummy sauce.  I used 2 whole pints of mushrooms (we just love mushrooms) and added some garlic to the sauce.  I also added lemon pepper and  a bit of onion to the chicken, which I cooked in a skillet.  Had just the right amount of lemon flavor.  Will definitely make again!

i loved this recipe.  my mother, who is not a fan of chicken breast (she thinks it is always too dry) raved about this.  i did, however, add a bit more butter to the sauce, as well as some sea salt.  i also marinated the chicken breast in a lemon juice and olive oil mixture.  excellent recipe!

It was easy to make but I didn't really care for it much.  I couldn't taste the lemon at all.  Need to add more lemon and make the sauce creamier next time.  My family liked it, they said it turned out tender and some flavor to it.  I will try again with other seasonings.

I was glad to see Joyce switched to skillet, as I also did the same because I like to work with cutlets for speed of cooking, portion control and ease of monitoring progress stovetop. I found this recipe to be a great healthy option to my breaded lemon-pepper chicken standard. I served it over angel hair it went off to work as well as reheatable leftovers. Thanks Joyce.

This is a delicious meal that doesn't take a lot of effort.  We used 3 chicken breasts but doubled the sauce. A few changes we made were: seasoning the chicken with Tony Chachere's cajun seasoning, putting a sprig of rosemary on each breast with the lemon slice on top and adding some rosemary, thyme, lemon juice and white wine to the sauce for added flavor.  The chicken came out flavorful and juicy and the sauce was very tasty over rice.

Very good & super easy.  I used twice as much lemon juice and added some poultry seasoning and Cajun seasoning too - let breasts marinate in this about an hour before I baked them.  Sauted 3 cloves garlic with mushrooms, and added the whole can of chicken broth, plus some red pepper flakes, 1/4 c lemon juice and a splash of white wine.  After it thickened, I put the baked chicken in the sauce to warm and simmer for about 10 min.  Served all over white rice.  Nice change from the norm.

This recipe was quite easy to make.  I tweaked it just a little: I sprinkled the chicken with about 2 teaspoons of dried oregano before adding the lemon juice and I crushed four cloves of garlic into the melted butter before sauteing the mushrooms. (This was for an adjusted recipe for 6 servings.) Served it with rice, spinach and garlic bread. My family loved it!  Next time, I'm going to make more of the mushroom sauce, though, because they couldn't get enough of it.

Very good recipe!  I doubled the sauce as suggested to put on top of egg noodles and it made plenty for leftovers.  I also added a touch of white wine but that was the only change.  I thought the lemon flavor was just right as written.  My husband loved it because of the strong mushroom flavor.  Very simple to make and will be something I make again.  Thanks!

This chicken was fantastic! The lemon flavor was just right. I did add the juice of 1/2 lemon to the sauce, but it just enhanced the lemon flavor. It turned out to be one of my husband's favorite chicken recipes. This is a keeper.

The chicken was good, but the mushroom gravy was HEAVENLY! I think I'll be making just the mushroom sauce sometime to use with something else. The contrast of the lemon and the mushroom is a good idea.

This was easy enough to make, although a little bland for our taste.  I agree with the reviewer who said that adding garlic might be a good idea, or maybe a little lemon-pepper.  The sauce thickened up really nicely -- it would help to use double the sauce, especially if you're serving this with rice or couscous, as we did.  All in all, a very attractive, easy, healthy dish with minimal cleanup needed (always a plus)!

I really love the lemon chicken.  I made the mushroom sause once but was not that impressed.  The chicken has a very refreshing flavor tho.  Goes great with any side dish.

This was absolutely delicious! I have always wanted to learn how to make good mushroom gravy. I will probably use the gravy for a lot of other things. The gravy would make great Mushroom Burgers! I wondered how the lemon chicken with the sauce on top would taste and it was yummy! I will probably make this recipe many many more times!

I used white wine instead of chicken broth.  Wow is all I can say.  This is a company meal.  I used more lemon than was called for, and salt and peppered the chicken.

Made this dish for my Swedish friends who are fabulous cooks themselves. Served with Smothered Green Beans, homeade rolls, and cheesecake, it made a very impressive dinner and everyone loved it. Doubling or even tripling the delicious sauce is a must!

the mushroom sauce came out amazing, i used more chicken broth than the recipe called for though betause i didnt feel like there was enough sauce for all those mushrooms.. the chicken itself came out fine, nothing great. i doubled the lemon juice because i like lemony chicken but sadly the chicken is still pretty blacd without the addition of the mushroom sauce.

ok so I read other reviews and here's what I did. I bought bone in thighs and marinated them in lemon olive oil, thyme, oregano, and italian seasoning for about 3 hours. then fried them in a pan until browned. Took them out, then sauteed garlic, added sliced mushrooms, chicken stock and flour. added sliced lemon and chicken and let it simmer about 20 minutes. Served with sautéed broccoli. Delicious

This was good but not great. I found it to be lacking in flavor. I would use more herbs next time. Also, the sauce was a coagulated mess. I would suggest using half the flour and increasing the chicken stock.

Good but not great.  The juice of half a lemon per chicken breast was too much - say half a lemon per two breasts.

Gave this 5 stars with the changes made. I marinated the chicken during the day in a little olive oil and a spice I got from spice shop - Salsa di Parma is a combination of garlic, onion, sea salt, red pepper flakes and other herbs. So good. Browned the chicken in cast iron skillet then baked for a short time in oven with lemon slices. Served with cauliflower mashed potatoes (whole head of cauliflower cut into pieces, 2 small yukon gold potatoes and 3 cloves of garlic. Boiled until fork tender then used immersion blender and added salt, pepper and a little butter.)

We are on low salt diet so I used no salt butter and organic chicken broth. I did add fresh garlic In with mushrooms and used extra lemon juice on the chicken. I put it over wheat pasta and put a little parmesan cheese on top. My family loved it

Marinated chicken tenders with juice of 1 1/2 lemons and zest, olive oil, salt, pepper, rosemary, italian seasoning and some Old Bay. Then sauteed chicken  with marinade on stovetop for about 9 minutes per side and kept warm while cooking up mushrooms and added asparagus as well! Used 1 cup of chicken broth with the remaining lemon juice and zest and it was delicious over rice! Also added some capers. Thanks for a great recipe!

Awesome!! Roux was so easy to make and thickened the ? of a cup of chicken stock perfectly! I took others advice and when I added the chicken stock I also seasoned it with garlic Mrs. Dash, salt and a little bit more oregano and garlic powder. I’m out of rice so I mashed some potatoes instead.

I used the "Chicken Seasoning Blend" recipe from this sight, as another reviewer suggested and added garlic, salt, and pepper, to the mushroom sauce. It was delicious, but the cayenne pepper in the seasoning was a little too spicy. A little lemon juice drizzled over the chicken fixed that, though. I would also double the mushroom sauce and add extra chicken broth and flour to make it more saucy. I'm giving this four stars because without the extra spices it would have been pretty bland.

I would have salt and peppered the chicken before baking it and added more lemon, as my family and I thought that the chicken was bland and didn't have much lemon flavor. My mushroom sauce came out good, and I did use half white wine and half white wine.

I added salt to the chicken and garlic. I also added salt to the sauce. I thought it was crazy that a recipe wouldn't have salt! With that said, this recipe was such a hit! Made it for a few friends and received all the compliments. I will definitely be adding this as a go to. My husband who isn't a big mushroom fan said this is his favorite meal i've ever made!

Made this and it was great! Started in oven then realized I had forgotten update of skillet so browned a bit at the end. Added a bit of salt & pepper and green onion I had already chopped. Great left overs too! Husband said he wants again! Thanks!

As written, it would come out too bland for my taste, but I liked the idea so I made some changes to make it a more flavorful recipe.  You really have to season the chicken before baking.  I added salt, pepper, parsley, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and thyme.  After baking, I ran it under the broiler for a couple of minutes to brown up the lemon slices.  When making the sauce, I added salt to the mushrooms as they were cooking.  Then I added a whole can of chicken broth, some white wine, and a little pepper and let it cook down.  Then I sprinkled in parsley at the end.  With all of these changes, my whole family loved it including the picky eaters and asked me to make it again.  But you really need to season the chicken or else it will taste rather bland.

I made it ! I made wild rice and placed the chicken on top, I did it exactly the same way except I noticed the mushroom sauce needed a tiny bit of salt because it was bland. Also instead of adding chicken broth to the mushrooms I waited until the chicken was done in the own and took the drippings from the pan and poured it into the mushroom sauce , it added the lemon/chicken flavor ! It was wonderful. My mother and fiancé devoured it!  I also had steamed baby carrots on the side for the veggie.

Great dish for company! And quite easy.
I used more mushrooms, good thing as my company lives them too.  Also a little more liberal with the lemon juice. And I added salt and pepper to the meat before adding the lemon slices..
Turned out great. Will definitely make this again.
I use Costco boneless chicken breasts which are large,; so, I cut them in half.  We love leftovers.  Will also freeze some.

Made it pretty much as the recipes states. I did, however, season the chicken with salt, pepper, thyme, and garlic powder.   I cooked the chicken in the pan rather than the oven. Towards the end of the cook, I added lemon juice and cooked a few minutes more. Removed the chicken to a plate, then sauteed the mushrooms with some fresh minced garlic,  added the flour and cooked for a few minutes, then added the brown. Once that reduced, I returned chicken to the pan and warmed.  Will definitely make again!

I will make this again! I did make changes by using the Chicken Seasoning Blend found on this site as recommended by many reviewers. I had this with pasta and broccoli. My husband really liked it.

I made it exactly as written and was not impressed. It was very easy but the chicken took much longer to cook than indicated. The mushroom sauce was too thick, and didn't seem to go with the lemon flavor of the chicken. Definitely not good enough for company. I wouldn't make it again.

Lemon chicken is a favorite of mine when going out to eat. I am thrilled that I can make this at home now! Very easy recipe to follow, and the mushroom sauce is delicious -- I will use that on other recipes for sure!

I SEASONED the chicken before I browned it in the skillet and it finished in the oven while I made the mushroom gravy.  It would have been terribly bland without salt and pepper.  Served it with garlic-butter green beans and garlic bread.  Fiance and I both loved it and have enough for leftovers.

Made a double batch of sauce for only four chicken breast. Also added pepper and didn't use parsley. Very tasty and easy to make. Next time will use more mushrooms.

Seeing as how my wife is sensitive to lemon,   I used orange slices and a bit of the orange juice on the chicken.  The chicken  was delicious with the hint of orange flavor.  However, the first time I made this I didn't use enough broth and the mushrooms were OK but a bit dry or sticky.  On my second go at this recipe, I corrected my mistake, used the right amount of broth and the whole meal was a hit.

The sauce was a bit thick despite adding more chicken broth.  I will cut back on the flour next time and add yet more mushrooms and broth.

I recommend fresh ingredients. We couldn't get fresh lemons or fresh parsley. It was delicious but i believe the fresh stuff would have made all the difference.  I also put  some lemon pepper on it, just for a little spice kick.

This was a great recipe and a keeper.
I too did this in a skillet.
I marinated the chicken with lots of lemon juice and some oil for the afternoon (4 hrs) and prepared the meal for dinner. I sauteed some onions in the pan before adding the mushrooms and it turned out great - Thanks

Good as written but even better with the suggestions of other reviewers (dredge chicken in flour and seasoning and add garlic and wine to mushrooms). Outstanding served over spaghetti squash! Will make this often.

This was a good, easy recipe. I made it in a skillet on the stove and it came out delicious. One skillet cooking, very little clean-up. Just remove chicken after cooking and make the sauce in the same pan and add the chicken back in. I used chicken breast tenders because that's what I had on hand. I did season my chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder before frying. I made extra sauce because we like a lot of extra sauce and spooned it over egg noodles. Yum! This is a very easy and quick recipe that anyone can make and also tweak to personal taste. Definitely will make again.

I thought this was pretty good. I did salt and pepper the chicken once i coated it in olive oil. For the mushrooms I reduced the butter, added a little olive oil and also S&P. I also used veggie broth as I didn't have any chicken...still worked out well. Served with a baked potato.

We enjoyed this chicken and I'll make it again, I just won't use such a juicy lemon next time.  We are chicken thigh fans and that's the only change to this recipe.The mushroom sauce compliments the tender chicken perfectly and I served it with mashed potatoes and a green salad. Easy and light.

I followed the recipe, however, the chicken was bland.  Your recipe called for olive oil and 1 lemon only for baking the chicken.   I added garlic salt to the mushrooms for some taste.

I made this recipe as shown, except I used lime juice instead of lemon, simply because I prefer the flavour of lime.  We really enjoyed the taste  of this chicken dish and I will certainly make it again.  I think I will use this recipe next time we have special dinner guests - it was that good.  Thanks for sharing.

It was okay.  Not great.   Weak lemon flavor.   Probably will go back to my chicken picata.

Turned out ok. I thinki the chicken needs additional spices for flavour.  I don't think I'll bother with this recipe again.

I never fully follow recipes exactly, but inasmuch as I could follow it: it was fabulous! I seared the breasts, then put lemon slices on them and  pan braised them in the oven with lemon juice, chicken broth, chopped garlic, salt, and pepper.  Once they were cooked, I took them out of the pan to rest and added the mushrooms and some flour to the pan.  I cooked the mushrooms as I reduced the sauce and served it over the chicken and rice.

Replaced breasts with the thin kind.  But it was still dry (juicy but dry). Didn't know if the recipe wanted the aluminum foil under or over the chicken. The mushrooms and the sauce were a good topping for that chicken. Had it with a side of small red potatoes and it was tasty.

I used chicken tenderloins and cooked them in the skillet  with fresh garlic. Next time I will season them with the chicken seasoning blend mentioned in one of the reviews. I did add more chicken broth and white wine with lemon juice. It needed the amount of liquid ,but definitely needs more seasoning. Will definitely make again.

The basic recipe is okay, but I added some garlic powder, Italian seasoning, adobo seasoning and salt and pepper to the chicken before baking.  Also, it seemed the ingredients for the mushroom sauce were spars.  I quadrupled the ingredients in order to make enough sauce to serve not only over the chicken, but rice as well.  I also added a bit of lemon juice and garlic to the chicken stock and mushrooms, which enhanced the lemon flavor of the chicken.  The family loved it!

The original recipe looked like it would need tweaking, so i did this: coated chicken in basil, garlic powder, salt and pepper, then marinated the chicken for an hour in the lemon juice. It gave the chicken a bit more flavor and paired with the mushroom sauce it was delicious! I served it with buckwheat because that always goes well with mushroom sauce.

I added lemon pepper seasoning and some real lemon juice to my baked chicken. Great recipe with the additions!  If you want this recipe to be more healthy, steam your mushrooms to cut out the butter.  After you steam them add the mushrooms to the chicken broth and garlic. Simmer for about  3 minutes, then add the parsley.

I used less butter, arrowroot instead of flour, cilantro instead of parsley( half cup) which I cooked a little, chopped scallions to the sauce and 4 cloves of garlic to the chicken as it baked.

I thought this was a great recipe. I am on a low carb diet right now I was looking for a flavorful dinner idea. This suited my need. I skillet browned the chicken before I put in the baking pan. I also added veggies on the bottom (for me, I used mini cucumber slices with dill seasoning). The chicken was great, but the mushroom sauce is AMAZING. I put a cup & a half of broth in to make it thicker and stretch it further.

The sauce was not very flavorful and ended up taking almost a cup of chicken stock.  I added a good squeeze of lemon juice, a little wine that I was drinking and more pepper. Also poured in the juice from cooking the chicken. My husband ate it all. He doesn't usually like boneless, skinless breasts, but they were moist and tasty and the sauce was very good. Will keep it in my repertoire for sure.

Easy and yummy. Made in a skillet - though the lemon juice burned. Might try browning in the skillet and finishing in the oven next time. Doubled the sauce as well.

As written, it is missing salt and pepper.  Also, some tips include: using foil while baking for easy clean up; warming broth before adding it to mushrooms or add cold broth a bit at a time.  I used dried parsley just fine.

Great! As others suggested I added garlic, basil and rosemary. Forgot to leave the lemon slices on, tossed them after squeezing. I had 4 unusually big chicken breasts, and 16 oz of mushrooms was actually 4 cups, but I could still have made more sauce. Used the broth from the chicken baking to make the sauce with, and it did need extra broth to come out right.

I didn't bake it in the oven. I did it on the stove...added fresh chopped garlic to pan with a little olive oil. Then added chicken...lemon juice and topped with lemon slices. With the mushrooms I added some white wine and a little chicken broth.

So easy and delicious! Made it Friday night because it matched the ingredients I had on hand. I added a little spice to the mushroom sauce.  I will try the browning method next time.

The chicken was good, nothing special. It needed more seasoning than just the lemon. But the mushroom sauce was mouth watering!! So easy to make, too. Will  definately be making this quick, easy meal for my family again. I'll just add some more flavor to the chicken.

Very yummy. After making I see the author added notes on improvements More mushrooms and pan fry instead of bake with more lemon/lemon zest. Both sound like good changes. Mushroom sauce while basic is delicious with this dish. I made with mashed potatoes and broccoli.

The only thing it's missing is seasoning, which you should do to your liking. The method is good, and listen to everyone else and make double the mushroom sauce--it's delicious.

This recipe is great! Super easy to make and goes with just about anything. The only things I changed was adding spices to the chicken and tripled the amount of lemon I added. I seasoned the chicken with lemon pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. One of my family members is a vegetarian so I used veggie chicken and veggie broth and it came out just as good! I paired it with a mushroom rice pilaf and steamed broccoli. The extra lemon gave everything a nice zest and went well with the broccoli. I also used what was left of the lemon slices once they were cooked and sautéed them with the mushrooms. I will certainly make this again!

Definitely needs seasoning.  I am so glad that I realized this before putting my chicken in the oven.  I seasoned it with garlic salt and pepper  then put the lemon slices on top.  I also covered the chicken for 25 minutes so that it wouldn't dry out.  It came out very moist, juicy, and tastier than it would have if I didn't use seasoning.  I would recommend this recipe to a friend with tweaks.

Changed up the cooking order a little and added a little lemon pepper to punch up the flavor, but all in all a great recipe.  Delicious gravy!  Picky husband loved it and that says a lot!  A Keeper, thanks for the post.

I did not care for this recipe as written. The sauce was so bland. I added garlic and celery salt, herbes de provence, additional lemon juice, a pinch of cayenne, fresh ground pepper, anything I could think of to throw in the pot to make a palatable gravy. The finished product was pretty good especially with the addition of fresh steamed veggies: zucchini, yellow squash, red and yellow peppers, carrots, onions, broccoli, fresh parsley. Colorful and healthy.

Baked this way my chicken came out rubbery. The sauce was good, but if I made it again, I would halve the flour. It was so thick it couldn't really be called sauce. I added at least 1 cup of chicken broth to get something that resembled sauce.

Loved this recipe! I tried what another person said to do,  and added white wine to the sauce. Didn't know what type of white wine so I used a white zinfadel by sutter- pretty tasty! Then I baked my asparagus with the chicken. Really did soak up the flavors; though next time I might add the asparagus later,  mainly because I like my asparagus kinda crunchy/ hard still.

This recipe is delicious!  I seasoned the chicken before baking with fresh rosemary, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.  I love mushrooms so I doubled the sauce recipe.  I made some changes to the sauce recipe and added the following: white wine, garlic powder, thyme, salt and pepper. -Lsimp33

I really like this recipe! Like other reviewers, I revised it a bit, adding salt and pepper and minced Garlic to the chicken breast before baking. What I like so much about it us that it is really easy and quick to prepare, and the rest is just baking time, If you use thin sliced chicken breasts, you can cut the bake time down to 30 minutes. Very tasty and the Famiy LOVED IT.

This was OK. It was very bland even with the addition of salt, pepper and marinating in lemon juice. If we have again, I will add shallots and garlic o the lemon juice and evoo before baking. Then add both to the mushroom gravy which was very bland.

Was great, used the recommendation to use the Chicken Seasoning Blend and browned in a skillet. Could add additional items to sauce as you desire.

This was SUPER bland. I made mashed potatoes and it tasted fine with that. The mushrooms definitely need to be doubled. I'd make again, but probably with a different mushroom sauce recipe (with soy sauce) and I'd add spices to the chicken.

I really wanted to like this dish. The chicken itself came out pretty good but I thought the sauce would have more flavor. It was a little bland.

I made this tonight for dinner for my husband and I. I followed the directions exactly and I have to say it was very good. Although it didn't have that "WOW" factor, it was still very tasty. I will be making again for sure!

Very tasty and also quite easy to prepare.   I did put some ground pepper on the chicken breasts before putting the olive oil and lemon on.    This recipe would be good enough for company.   Thanks, will use it again!

It was OK!  the sauce was excellent but the chicken itself came out a little bland without it.  I'd make it again.

This was simple and quick to do... I used thighs instead of breasts. The lemons infused into the chicken just perfect. I doubled the sauce recipe and added onions for a bit more flavor and used the broth the chicken made. Gave the sauce some lemon flavor for more kick. My family loved it. Will definitely make again!

I've not made this recipe yet but I think I'd add a few spices. Maybe some salt & pepper to taste, granulated or fresh minced garlic and either oregano or Italian spice. I also like the idea from A7HENA to bake asparagus with the chicken.
Only 4 stars though because of the lack of spices.

A very good chicken dish.  I made it on the stovetop as suggested by others.  Didn't have lemon so I used lemon pepper and a couple of splashes of bottled lemon juice instead.  I'm not a fan of lemon pepper...too salty.  I think I'll throw that spice away...now while I'm thinking of it! I would possibly make this again as it was tasty and a quick meal to throw together on a weeknight.

This is really disappointing, among the blandest, least flavorful recipes I've ever made. The lemon is imperceptible even with 50 percent more juice than the recipe called for, and by the time the chicken browned in the oven, it was badly overcooked and dried out. The "sauce" was a glutinous mass--I thinned it by using 12 ounces of chicken broth instead of the prescribed half-cup, then squeezed another half a lemon into that to try to bring up the flavor. The only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one is that technically I COULD eat it. But I didn't enjoy it.

I loved this chicken. I read a lot of the reviews and decided that seasoning the chicken and pan-frying it was a great option - but I decided to just brown it and then throw it in the oven for 30 minutes. I used a variety of seasoning, as well as flour - parsley, basil, cayenne, paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper, thyme etc - dipped the chicken in and then fried it with some fresh lemon juice squeezed over. I made the sauce but used more chicken broth and put a lot of garlic in it. I didn't have white wine, but I thought that would be delicious. My sauce turned out quite lemony... I actually poured it over the chicken and baked for an additional five minutes to let the flavours blend. I served the dish atop basmati rice, alongside roasted potatoes (had some I needed to use up - don't usually like two starches), and broccoli. It was a nice and refreshing dish that I will definitely make again. Thank you!

I followed some of the other reviewers advice and added poultry seasoning, fresh garlic, and salt/pepper/garlic powder blend.  I cooked the chicken in the skillet first then added the rest of the ingredients. Also I used corn starch instead of flour to thicken the sauce at the end. My family really enjoyed it and it was easy!

It's a plain and simple recipe.  Worth redoing on a Tuesday or Wednesday night.  I served it with a can of peas.  I'd double the mushroom recipe if I made it again.

I made this for two so only cooked two chicken breasts but made the same amount of sauce.  I think if I was making it for 4 I would double the sauce.  Also added 2 TBSP of soya sauce and some thyme to the sauce.  Served it with rice ... it was very good ... thanx Joyce

The mushroom sauce was amazing, but the chicken was a little dry and the flavor was a bit on the light side, IMO. My boyfriend absolutely loved this though.

This was a great dish to make - I followed the recipe and the advice of reviewers, and added more lemon and seasoning. I used a skillet, three lemons and another one for garnish and extra flavor, and added seasoning as I cooked. The chicken came out great - tender, and well-flavored, and healthy. It didn't even need the mushroom sauce, but the sauce complemented well. (I also really like mushrooms). Definitely a great recipe, simple and (without the sauce), very lean.

My husband and I loved this dish!  However, I made some changes based on the reviews, and I feel that those changes are necessary to make this a five star recipe.  The most important change is that the sauce MUST be increased, especially if you're serving this with rice as suggested.  I doubled the sauce (except for the butter) and we still wanted more.  Next time I will increase the sauce even more.  Also, I recommend adding spices to this dish.  I added garlic, thyme, italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and lemon zest to the chicken and some garlic to the mushroom sauce.  I do like my food well-seasoned, so some people may not like to add as much as I did, but I do recommend adding at least a little spice.  I also turned the broiler on for the last few minutes of baking the chicken so it would brown.  I will definitely make this again!

This turned out great!!!! The only thing is I can't seem to follow a recipe. It's in my genes to change something or add to it!!! I actually added red bell pepper (julienned), garlic, diced yellow onion, crushed red pepper flakes, and a little frozen corn. Also, I only had beef broth opened. It worked just as well!

The flavors are great!  I'd never made my own mushroom sauce, and found it surprisingly easy.  Once I'd finished the whole dish and plated it, I realized it needed a starch element.  I think next time I'll serve with pasta, or rice.

Really tasty, but I added extra lemon and seasoned the chicken with rosemary and garlic.

This was awesome!  I make everything into a vegetarian recipe, so I pan fried some tofu breaded with flour, breadcrumbs and seasonings (salt, pepper, oregano, garlic salt, etc), squeezed the lemon over them in the pan and put them in the oven with the slice of lemon while I made the sauce.  Used veggie broth in the sauce and made about double... everything came out GREAT!  Served it with green beans sautéed with a bit of lemon juice, butter and oil and some mashed potatoes.  Awesome recipe! :)

Not so great. Too dry. The sauce tasted too flour-y. I didn't like the lemon-mushroom flavor.

I really don't understand why everyone likes this recipe so much.  Everyone in my family found it very bland and the chicken didn't brown since there was a lemon slice over it all.  I make my own lemon chicken that we will be sticking with...Sorry!

Most excellent!  I served this with garden rotini pasta (the tricolor spiral pasta) and steamed asparagus and it was a hit!  Even my toddler loved the mushroom sauce and pasta!!!  Other variations:  Since I didn't have a whole lemon on hand I used half lemon and a whole lime and it was delish!  I also added  1 to 1 1/2 cup of broth for more sauce.
This is now on our family favorite recipes list!  Thanks for sharing this simple, healthy and delicious recipe!

I thought that it was great, but I did doctor it up quite a bit with garlic and spices.   Also, I marinated the chicken  with lots of lemon, garlic, and white wine, which really helped that flavor to sink in.

This did not turn out as good as I thought it would. The chicken did not hold lemon flavor and the mushroom sauce was rather bland. I do not see myself making this again.

This was okay.  My kids did not like it but my husband thought it was pretty good.  I just did not think it was very lemony even with adding extra lemon.  Probably would not make again.

This was okay. The chicken really didn't hold the lemon flavor, even though I used extra juice and put the lemon slices on top. The mushroom sauce was good, might be more flavorful if we add more spices next time. Husband liked it, which is always a plus. Will probably make again with some experimentation.

This was so good!  The mushroom sauce was unbelievable!  We used it as a sauce for rice as well as the chicken and it was wonderful.  The sauce would be great on beef as well.  The chicken was a little too lemony for me, so next time I will use the sauce on seasoned baked chicken instead.

This recipe was not as good as it sounded. I served it over egg noodles, and I thought the lemon flavor in the chicken was good, but the mushroom sauce was bland. It might be better with the addition of onions and/or garlic. As the recipe is now, I probably would not make it again.

A great recipe.  I gave it only 4 stars because I thought it was just ok leftover.  The margarine in the sauce tended to separate and become just a little oily when reheated.  This reminds me a little bit of a stroganoff-type sauce but without the dairy (sour cream etc).  I would recommend adding a little bit of salt, maybe 1/2 to 1 tsp.  I used chicken bullion in water in place of the "chicken broth."  I also put this over wide egg noodles as opposed to rice and it was great.  I will make this again, keeping in mind that I don't want any leftovers.  Oh, and I only used 3 chicken breasts, but still used the whole lemon, and I would recommend if doing 6 breasts, you used 2 lemons for more flavor.

Yummm!!!!  I thought this recipe was so quick and easy but looked like something much more complicated and it was delicious.  I did add more lemon juice to the chicken while it was cooking (I waited until the chicken browned to place the lemon slices on top) and followed another reviewers advice by putting some of the drippings from the chicken into the mushroom sauce.  I also added a clove of garlic to the mushrooms while they were sauteeing as well as a few quick squeezes of lemon.  The sauce was fabulous!  I put it over plain white rice and served with fresh green beans.  I will absolutely be adding this to my "chicken rotation".

My husband and I liked it, but it was a bit bland.  We added salt and pepper, but will probably add lemon pepper next time.  The mushroom sauce is very versatile, we may try it with pork chops another time.

Superb mushroom sauce- key is tons of mushrooms. I thought the plain chicken with just lemon would be bland, but it tasted wonderful with the sauce. I will definitely make this again.

pretty bland in taste overall and not a good affect on subsequent digestion!

This was one of the best main dishes I have ever made. All the ingredients it contains are some of my favorites and it presented itself beautifully. If you like chicken with a lemon accent and mushrooms, you will love this dish. Extremely easy to make, but it is time consuming as the mushroom sauce takes a little attention.

This was FANTASTIC!! I made it for my inlaws and they were very impressed. I have made that yummy mushroom sauce several times since then too.
