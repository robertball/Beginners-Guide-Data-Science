Props for ease of preparation!  I left the sauce on the side since we like different levels of 'sauciness'.  I added some onion and some garlic, just because I had them.  Kids enjoyed it and even the meat loving hubby had seconds!

The receipe calls for 1 tablespoon (is way too much Pepper). We only added 1 tsp and even that was too much. Next time; we'll reduce to 1/4 tsp. Also next time we'll try and add some pre-cooked chicken or even salmon. Thanks for the receipe.

It's good & easy.
I did everything the same except
The broccoli I used was a steamer that had cheese with it, I added a lot of different cheeses in my fridge, olive oil, bacon, a little fiesta corn with bell peppers, garlic salt, a pinch of minced garlic, pepper, fresh mushrooms, and milk.

Very quick and easy, which is what I was looking for, so for that I give it 5 stars. As written it could be a bit more flavorful, so don't be afraid to add to di your own magic with seasoning. I also added grilled chicken breast strips

Fast, easy, kid friendly dish. I added garlic, red peppers and saut√©ed chicken too. It was a hit and was ready in under 30 mins :):)
