These are delicious upcakes with just the right amount of orange flavor. I zested my peel, I did not grate. Also for those new to zesting, make sure you zest just the colored part of the skin. If you start removing any of the white pith it will make things taste bitter. I should have bought two limes because I needed extra juice for the frosting because it was to thick for me and needed additional juice. I had to use lemon because I ran out of lime juice. I also added a little more vanilla extract and just a bit of canned evaporated milk to get the frosting to the consistency I like. Add very small amounts until you get the consistency you like. I then added some orange gel coloring to the frosting and they looked beautiful!

I converted this recipe to gluten free with GF flour blend and xantham gum. My only gripe is the frosting. I added milk (a tablespoon at a time) instead of extra juice to get a spreadable consistency. The amount of frosting made was not enough to pipe or even frost to look like AR's photo above.  The frosting is good but I would double the recipe if I were to make it again.  Overall it is a pretty tasty cake and my family enjoyed it.
