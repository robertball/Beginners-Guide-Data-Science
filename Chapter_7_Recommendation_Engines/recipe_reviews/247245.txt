OMG! This is amazing! Those of  you who like sangria will love it for being the perfect summetime drink - light and refreshing. For those who are not fans of sangria, this very well could be the beverage that will change your mind. My daughter and I  tried this last night and are mixing up another batch tonight! Delicious!

I made this for a family birthday party and it was a huge hit! I will definitely make it again. One of my sisters-in-law wants the recipe.

We served it to friends and everyone asked for refills.  I will make it again, but I did find that the amount of fruit was excessive in comparison to the amount of liquid.  Next time I will use about half the amount  of fruit.
