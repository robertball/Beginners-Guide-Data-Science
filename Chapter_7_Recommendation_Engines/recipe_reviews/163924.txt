This is hands down the best tuna melt on the planet. The flavors are spectacular!  Husband is a bit leery of tuna, but this one rocked his world!  Mine, too.

Prepared exactly as written.

WOW! I could eat the tuna all by itself. Amazing flavors! I also substituted the olive oil for the vegetable, and used "Smart Balance" instead of butter, but otherwise kept everything the same. Excellent!

This was the best tuna melt I have ever had. I loved the spicy flavors.  The only thing I changed was to put it on chibatta bread and toast it on a panni pan.  I couldn't stop eating the tuna fish cold. My husband and I just loved it.

I was looking for something new, cheap, and easy, (haha) This was it! My husband and I had never had a Tuna Melt hot tuna never appealed to us. This was AWESOME!!! We both LOVED it! Only thing I did I did different was I used canned salmon that my husband canned last fall. Because the can of salmon was bigger than tuna I had to add more of the other ingredients as well. We have had this three times since I found the recipe and it will be a keeper for a long time to come! Thanks for sharing!

Good, but not as spicy as I thought it would be. Also diced up some red bell pepper to add to the tuna.

I love that this recipe is not loaded with mayo which my husband hates. He can't even taste it in this recipe! I use olive oil or mediterranean blend oil bc that is what I cook with. Sometimes I use tuna with water, dijon or reg mustard, and use what cheese I have on hand which is usually cheddar jack or swiss. Doesn't matter what bread you use either. It is delicious and full of flavor!

This recipe is absolutely delicious! This is one of those recipes that you don't have to add anything else that the recipe doesn't call for.  This is now one of my families favorites!

Perfect tuna melt! I used ciabatta bread otherwise followed instructions exactly and wouldn't change a thing! I didn't find them overly spicy but wonderfully flavorful, we will be having these a lot this summer! Thank you for the recipe!

This was simple, I had all the ingredients already. A+ turnout. My modification: Sriracha instead of the hot sauce. Next time I wanna find some really nice bread to put it on. Like an asiago loaf? Mmm

Served this up as a panini on ciabatta buns.  It was okay.  Could have used more tuna and a bit more kick.  Will play around with this next time I make it.  But it pretty good as directed.
