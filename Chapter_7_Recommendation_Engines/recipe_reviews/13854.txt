I think this is a cute idea, but it was hard to figure out how to put the turkey together, so I found a picture on line which was helpful.

I love the idea, but I and all the people I have shown this recipe to are a little confused on the assembly.  It would be SO HELPFUL if you could post a picture of the finished product or  give more explicit instructions...

Needs better directions.  Stack the caramel candy on bottom as the body.  Place flat side of candy corn next with white end sticking out to make the beak.  The round caramel candy is the head and is on top.  Stick together with frosting.  Add cookie behind these for the feathers.  Cut two candy corns in half.  Push the piece with the white end sticking out into the round candy to make the eyes of turkey.

I've seen this idea before, but I'm not seeing how this resembles a turkey. He looks a little like he's been stepped on! : (  My mother has made these before with Oreos, malted milk balls, candy corn and cinnamon Red Hots- they're very cute! I'll give her a call and post the "recipe" if anyone is interested.

My family makes these every year, but instead of the carmel candy, we use chocolate-covered cherries.  Put the cherry on it's side, though, with the flat part facing the striped cookie.

i made mine a little different. i nuked the caramel for about 10 seconds and it made it soft enough to attach the feet (a start chocolate) and the cookie, and lastly the candy corn beek. i did NOT use any frosting.

These instructions are somewhat lacking.  The candy corn beak should protrude from between the two other candies (or icing-glued onto them); pipe icing eyes onto the candy above the beak.

This is one of the easiest and best ideas to do with your children, nieces or nephews.  My niece and nephew did this and gave to 24 people at their Thanksgiving Dinner.  They were so proud of the response.  Basically no cleanup needed.  Using the prepared frosting is great.

My mom makes these every year but she uses a chocolate covered cherry for the turkey instead of the caramel. It looks a lot better with the chocolate cherry!
