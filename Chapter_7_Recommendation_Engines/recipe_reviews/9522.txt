I made two batches of Spiced Nuts. On the second batch, I used half of all the ingredients except the nuts.  On both batches, I baked them in a 
250 degree oven for 1 hour, stirring every 
15 minutes.  The nuts recieved rave reviews from my family.  It was a very quick and easy recipe.

I made these for a Thanksgiving snack before the big meal. WOW! I couldn't stop eating them. Next time I will use a little less butter. I am sure they won't taste as good but I will feel less guilty eating most of the batch. ;) Great & easy recipe! Ingredients surprisingly mixed very well!

Found that the pecans stay too soft and there is a lot of butter left in the bowl.  Followed the recipe to the "t".  Needs less butter and a way to crisp up the nuts!!

I love spicy pecans.  The proportions I use are 1/2 stick butter, 1 TBS Tony's Creole seasoning and 1 TB. sugar. Melt butter, add seasoning and mix well, pour over pecans and stir well; pour on cookie sheet and bake at 350 for 30-45 minutes, stirring often.

I know several people with diabetes who cannot eat sweets and love nuts. This was a wonderful substitute at Christmas for all those taboo goodies. Everyone loved the nuts and they were the easiest holiday treat I've ever made.

I've been searching for a good snack nut mix for gifts and I believe I've found it.  Thank you. -   I did make the following changes based on my families tastes.  I reduced the cloves by half (1/8 tsp), and used regular butter and mixed nuts because it's what I had.  Near the end of cooking I sprinkled just a smattering of sugar over the top and tossed it in.   I made this on the stove top in a wok because I don't have a microwave dish big enuf and my test batch seemed - "chewy".    Here's how I finally dried off the oilyness from the butter and it seemed to work OK.  After cooking stove top a few minutes I finished them off in the oven at 325 for 5 - 10 minutes.  I then put a flat  cooling rack  on the bottom of a jelly roll pan and covered it with a piece of paper bag covered with  paper towels.  Then I put them back in the over at 250 for ~10 minutes, stirring as necessary until they were mostly dry.   Let cool on racks.    I hope that helps someone.  If you have any better ideas for drying off the nuts I look forward to learning it.  Enjoy.

Good enough. I agree that there is too much butter. I almost doubled the nuts in order to spread the butter thinner. It did require an hour baked at 250. Tasty, not spicy.

Loved this recipe; however, I knew to roast the nuts beforehand!  The savory taste of these nuts cannot be beat!

Wow, this was pretty bad. Bland, greasy, and nuts came out way too soft. I'm usually forgiving when it comes to recipes on this site but this was ridiculous.

Da Bomb! Delish. After seeing other reviews & they thought these nuts were greasy I drained mine on a paper towel. Also halved the recipe since pecans & butter are not cheap. Now I wish I had gone for the whole shebang! They are so good. All microwaves differ & mine is one of the hotter ones & these cooked up wonderfully following your directions even though I had half the recipe. I have made several batches of spicier chex & pretzel type mixes & was ready for a change. I love this combo of spices. Thanks!

This recipe didn't work for me.  The nuts stayed greasy from the butter even after I tried baking them in the oven and blotting them with paper towels.  Taste is OK.

very good. I thought the measurements were perfect  
I did add a little kick to them with a sprinkle of cayenne powder. I would definitely make it again.

I really enjoyed the flavour of these nuts, however, I was actually looking for something a little more "spicy".  I think next time I will add about 1/8th of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  Yum!

Totally underwhelmed.  Was looking for something not sweet, and while these are not sweet I didn't find a whole lot of taste and they were very greasy.

I took these to a party last night.  Everyone wanted the recipe and couldn't believe I had made then in only 10 minutes.  I did cook them for 9 minutes total.  Quick and tasty!

I made these for a party and they were a big hit. I reduced the amount of butter by 25% after trying it as per the recipe and finding the nuts much too wet.  I also baked them in the oven at 350 for 10 minutes. Oh, and I did a mix of half pecans and half cashews, which was great.

I changed this up a bit by omitting the soy sauce and garlic powder, using half the worcestershire sauce and adding maple syrup and dried cranberries.  I baked mine at 350 degrees stirring every 30 minutes. I agree it would probably be better with half the butter.
