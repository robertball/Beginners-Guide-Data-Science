this is my first one star.  I usually can see what is coming down the pike by looking over ingredients etc... but this one blind sided me. I would do a major revamp so much that you might as well call it a new recipe.  I guess couldn't eat it is a bit harsh.  But didn't enjoy eating it was accurate.

Very good, I also baked it in the oven to be a little healthier.
