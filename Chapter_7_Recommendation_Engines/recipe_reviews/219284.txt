The flavor of this was great but it did turn out a little dry. Next time I'd add a little melted butter and maybe a teaspoon of vanilla. It's a shame--it turns out such a pretty product.

This had too much apple butter for our tastes; I’d cut that back to 1-1/2 cups (maybe even 1 cup) in the future.  We didn’t find this dry as mentioned by the previous reviewer, the apple butter provided moisture.  But the texture was denser than I really like in a coffee cake (the baking mix, I assume).  This is a fairly good coffee cake, but I can’t say that I’d make it again.  My husband commented that he really prefers coffee cakes with pieces of apple in it.

Good recipe. Made it pretty much as is the first time. Family suggested next time I swirl the apple butter with the batter and I agree. Would even things out and make it pretty. Made it again and used more butter in the batter, a crumb top with oatmeal, and peach preserves. I have a jar of pumpkin butter in mind for next time.
