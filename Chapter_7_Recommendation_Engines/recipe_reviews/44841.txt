These won tons are great! The only problem I found was for first time won ton makers (like myself) it would have been VERY helpful to know that you cannot stack the precooked won tons together. I had no idea that when I was ready to cook them I would have a HUGE ball of sticky dough that could not be pulled apart! Out of the 100 I had made I had to throw out quite a big pile of useless goo. Please make sure when you make this recipe to lay your won tons side by side and keep covered so they don't dry out. Also, the recipe makes 10 servings - I tripled it and made about 150 won tons for a party.

Instead of frying the wontons, which would have taken forever. . .I formed and baked them in mini muffin tins. Then I was able to place them in a ziploc bag. Finally, at the party we just filled up the won ton cups with the filling I stored in a bowl and nuked them for about a minute. Delicious!!

I was skeptical after reading the ingredients, but decided to trust the reviewers! These were great. Easy to make. Brought them to a small gathering for a "test run". They were a hit - everybody liked them (of course I didn't tell them the ingredients until after they tried them). I really minced/ground up the filling for a nice even consistency (I put the cubed spam & water chestnuts in my cuisinart) & added an extra Tbsp of the oyster sauce b/c mixture seemed a little dry. Also, I used SCRAMBLED eggs instead of hard boiled (it was quicker). I used regular spam & did NOT find it to be too salty. I made the wontons ahead of time, covered w/ plastic wrap and kept in the fridge for a couple of hours. Brought them to my friends' and fried them up there (it just takes a few minutes) This made about 50 DELICIOUS wontons. Served these with a bottled sweet & sour sauce for dipping- although they were also good without the sauce. Will definitely make a double batch for an upcoming luau. Thanks for the recipe.

These wonton were great.  I made them for a Christmas party for work that had Hawaiian theme and they may of lasted 5 mins.  Even at home, my family couldn't leave them alone.  I deep fried mine in a deep fryer and they came out nice and crispy.  I did change the ingredients around a bit, instead of egg I used  mango (canned or fresh works great) and I used about an 8 oz can of crushed pineapple as well.  Also, if you have problems working with the wonton skins use egg roll skins instead.  They are much larger and easier to stuff and handle.    Awesome recipe once again.  Thanks a million.

I LOVED this, but my daughter and hubby were less than thrilled, I won't put the oyster sauce in next time, and use sweet and sour sauce or pineapple juice instead.

Okay, the filling makes WAY more than what you could possibly stuff in 14 oz. of won ton wrappers(I had at least half leftover) but it was really good and I highly recommend. This was only the second time I had tasted SPAM and the first time I had actually bought it. These were really good with some dipping sauce. I watched a video on Youtube for fancy folding but other than that, I stuck to the recipe.

Wow, this recipe's a keeper!  I made these for a Hawaiian-themed party last night and everyone loved them!  I had a hard time using the regular sized won-ton wrappers, so I used the larger sized wrappers, and I rolled them up like egg rolls.  They were a LOT easier to work with.  To save time, I scrambled the eggs like another reviewer suggested. I added some chinese hot mustard alongside the sweet and sour sauce, like they do in Chinese restaurants.  That worked well with this recipe.

I HATE SPAM, but mysteriously 3 cans of it were in my pantry. Not one to waste with a family of 5, I decided I would try this recipe. It was Ono, which is what we have named this dish at our house. I had Low Sodium and Turkey varities of Spam. I will make this again, thanks Elizabeth.

I made these for an annual luau potluck, and they were a complete hit!  Everyone loved them, especially the people who said they probably wouldn't have even tried them had they known there was Spam involved!  I couldn't get anything but small round wrappers at the time, so this recipe made about twice as much filling as I could fit in the smaller wrappers.  I took the suggestion of using reduced-sodium Spam and was pleased.  I will certainly make these again!

As a former "spam hater", I was skeptical of this recipe.  I made a couple test won tons, fried them, and taste tested.  These are amazing ...  I couldn't believe something with spam and hard boiled eggs as main ingredients could be this good.  I took them to a luau this evening ... served them with a sweet/sour dipping sauce and garnished them with mini skewers alternating pineapple chunks and maraschino cherries.  They were a hit ... no leftovers.

I grew up on SPAM and its cousin deviled ham. This recipe is great, but, adding chopped pineapple set it apart from others that I have tried.

Per reviews, I -1- minced the ham & chestnuts in my food processor -2- used SCRAMBLED eggs -3- rolled to wrap. I used LEFTOVER HAM instead of spam.  Made these hours ahead, put in pan lined with wax paper, wax paper between each layer.  I thought these were just ok.  People at the party had nice things to say & none were left.

Maybe my expectations were a little too high on this recipe.  I thought it was good, but I don't know if I'll make it again.  Maybe I would have enjoyed them more if I didn't know that Spam was in them.  My roommate seemed to really like them a lot.

I concur!  This recipe is always a hit at parties, and I don't tell them it contains Spam 'til AFTER they've had a taste and declared how delicious it is.  It's definitely easy, but it's not something you can whip up in 15 minutes, since it takes time to chop the ingredients, fill the won ton wrappers, and then fry them.  (Plan for an hour-and-a-half.)  They're definitely worth the time, and the smell of deep fried food that lasts in the house for a day or two!

Tip #1:  The original recipe indicates that it serves 10.  My personal experience, though, is that it serves five, so if you're serving 10, you'd better double it!!

Not really sure what all the hub-bub is about. I really wasn't thrilled with this recipe. Needed something...cream cheese maybe. Probably won't try again. I did use my food processor so that cut down on the prep time.

These were surprisingly good..I was nervous in putting water chestnuts and oyster sauce with spam but it went well together..you couldn't taste the chestnuts and the oyster sauce was not overpowering.. I gave it a four cause the spam wontons tasted so much better with sweet and sour or with soy sauce to dip them in..instead of eating them by themselves.

I wish I'd copied the previous reviewer and used egg roll wrappers - half a can of spam made about 25 won tons, and it was so tedious folding them up in their little envelopes. I personally don't think they were worth the effort; I had a couple, and got tired of them fast. Husband, however, enthusiastically munched his way though them, and declared them a 'solid four.' Thanks, Elizabeth!

The recipe turned out good. I’m curious how other people are transporting fried food to an event without it turning out like leftover fried foods tend to do - soggy or at least less than crunchy. I tried baking the shells as another person commented but could not get the filling in them once baked. A stuffed batch is being baked now - we’ll see how that turns out.

I made the recipe as is for a Luau themed party. I made them in advance and froze them, so all I had to do was pop them in the fryer. They were a huge hit and were devoured as fast as I could fry  a batch!

My guests did like these, but for me they lacked panache.  They turned out beautiful to look at but they need more flavor.  Maybe it's the Spam, maybe trying ground pork would have the zing I was looking for.  One thing for sure.... you absolutely must have a dipping sauce with them (something sweet).  We used Duck Sauce.  This recipe did spark me to want to try different things with won ton wrappers but next time I think I'll use a recipe off the won ton skin package insert.  I'm very sorry, Rozewski :(

I've had a similar recipe for over 25 years.   No egg or oyster sauce!  Grate the spam, grate the water chestnuts  and add a little ginger, along with the chopped green onion.  Grating the spam makes it easy to form into ball, and stuff the wonton wrapper.   Since I like Spam I do a taste test of the filling to see if I added enough ginger.  I grew up in Hawaii so spam was a regular on our table. The only hard part is grating the water chestnut, this is tedious, but worth not having chunks of water chestnuts, which I really don't care for.

These were delicious! I probably would not have minded the oyster sauce, but I was taking these to work and I know a lot of people might be picky; therefore, I took someone's suggestion on the reviews and used pineapple juice, same amount. Made the rest of the recipe as is. These were a hit!
