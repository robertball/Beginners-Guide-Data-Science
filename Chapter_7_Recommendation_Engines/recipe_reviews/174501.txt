5 stars for an easy, cheap, fairly healthy meal that the kids even liked!  I did make a few slight changes: 1) added in some thawed chopped spinach to the sauce to increase the veggie intake 2) used a whole can of pumpkin puree 3) used 25 ounces of ravioli 4) used a whole 20 oz package of hot turkey sausage.  Very easy to assemble & dinner was ready to go in an hour.  I like that it's a really good way to "sneak" in veggies by using the pumpkin and of course the marinara sauce.  THANKS FOR SHARING!  :)

Very tasty.  I recommend using about twice the amount of ravioli - this makes a ton of sauce. :)  My husband loves this.
