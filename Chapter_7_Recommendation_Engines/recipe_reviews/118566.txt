Very easy and quick, with a good flavor.  I recommend baking these at a lower oven temperature for a longer period of time to guarantee a nice, crunchy texture - but keep a close eye on them as they brown quickly.

I've been making these croutons for years. It's just as good with wheat bread and even more so with homemade bread. I use homemade dry italian dressing mix OR ranch dressing mix. Insane on homemade potato soup and in overnight breakfast casseroles. Try it for yourself. TIP: You can use EVOO or low fat cooking spray in place of the butter/margerine to cut calories/fat.

Irresistable is definitely the word to describe these! I'll NEVER ever go back to store bought again! I had some Italian bread that was going stale and this recipe was just what I was looking for.... I melted the butter in the microwave and added a little EVOO along with the garlic powder and Italian seasoning. I watched them carefully so they didn't burn. I turned them once during cooking. I think you can mix up just about any combination of herbs, spices, and add in some grated cheese and these will turn out great! Fabulous in salads, but I can definitely see a lot of uses for these...

Very good.  I didn't use butter--used olive oil, and I cooked them a bit longer, as I like my croutons very crunchy, but still good.  I think this is a very good base recipe that you can easily play with.    Thanks!

I like Italian or French breads, made with little or no fat.  But if it doesn’t get eaten pretty darned quickly it dries out fast.  Making crumbs of the hard or dried out bread is one option – these croutons are another.  Commercial croutons taste stale and lifeless and homemade bakery croutons, while convenient and just as good, are expensive.  These are so easy to make and wonderful to have on hand for soups and salads.  I used Italian bread and olive oil, and went very light on the seasoning.

I never knew making croutons was so simple! There is a lot of flavor in this. I used olive oil and added a pinch of salt to this. Will be using this recipe often.

Great recipe, although I agree with others that it should be baked at a lower temp, for a bit longer. I will try again.

Used half butter/half olive oil (followed the rest of the recipe exactly) & the croutons turned out awesome!  The kids ate the leftovers for a snack the next day.

I love homemade croutons. I had some Hawaiian Sweet Rolls leftover so I thought I'd give them a try. Turned out GREAT!  Use butter not margarine though.

Followed recipe exactly and these were delicious! Will not look for any other crouton recipe! I have made it multiple times with Italian/french bread, but I just tried it with homemade wheat bread and liked them even more!

Just what I was looking for. I subbed olive oil for butter and used fresh garlic and some dried out hogie rolls. I am so glad I didn't throw those away. I did have to toss in a little extra olive oil to coat all the bread, I think because the bread was drier than fresh bread it soaked up a little more. Now I just have to quit tasting them before dinner time! I am using them for a salad, but they would be excellent on soup like the author recommended.

These are great! And this is a good base to start experimenting with. I increased the cooking time so they would be crunchy. Also, I added onion powder and garlic salt (1/2 tsp each) the second time around which I thought made them better. But as is, really good croutons.

These came out great!  I decided to make them on a whim since I was craving croutons on my salad, but ran out of store-bought.  I scaled the recipe down quite a bit since I only wanted enough for about 4 salads.  I used 2 large pieces of sour dough bread, 2 Tbsp. low-fat margarine, 1/2 tsp. Italian season, 1/8 tsp. garlic powder and a pinch of salt.  I found that they did have to bake longer than stated and they were even crunchier the next day.

Very good!  I used leftover rolls from the recipe "Burger or hot dog buns".  I first tried using a zero calorie butter spray but it made them too dry.  I used a combination of both butter and margarine and went heavy on sprinkling the Italian seasoning.  I also used onion powder.

These are sooo good! Had some leftover, homemade sourdough bread that I was going to throw out. Then I thought of making croutons. Found this recipe, added some parm and kosher salt, and whammo! Hubby and I are eating them as a snack. Don't know if I will have any left for salads.

If you look at the recipe Outrageous Ceasar Salad it has a crouton recipe that is to die for.  Anyway, it says to cook for 275 for 30 mins.  I noticed when I did this Italian Crouton recipe the croutons were not evenly cooked.  I thought the seasoning was pretty good though.

I didn't have Italian seasoning so I just threw Italian herbs together. Very good though, my husband and I couldn't stop munching on them. They never even made it to a salad.

Excellent! Easy! Didn't change a thing. Definitely recommend if you're looking for something preservative free w/o MSG, unlike the store bought ones. I'm getting ready to make more now.

Perfect!! :) Easy and delicious - I used Hawaiian honey whole wheat rolls and otherwise followed ingredients/instructions (though I didn't use a bowl to toss these in, I drizzled the butter mixture over the bread cubes directly on the cookie tray!) :)

I made these croutons with some beer bread that was made with a mix from Tastefully Simple and they were absolutely delicious. I nibbled on them before I even got them into a salad. very tasty.

Very easy and delicious! Great on salad or as a snack. Be careful when combining the liquid with the bread or some pieces will get saturated while other pieces are dry. Thanks!

Great!!!  We added some garlic salt and other spices, and gave our salad a long-needed kick.

These are very tasty! I had some leftover homemade bread on hand and thought I would give these a go...I'm glad I did! They had great flavor and complimented my salad perfectly. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 extra virgin olive oil. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of shallot salt and some fresh cracked pepper. I will definately be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used this with wheat bread.  I don't have an oven, so I cooked them on my George Foreman.  They didn't get very crispy, which was fine bc my bf and I don't like them super crunchy.  Plus I was using them for a tomato bread salad.  The flavor was exquisite!!

This is a delicious recipe.  Our family loved it.  I think next time I might use some minced onion and some thyme or marjoram to add more flavor.

I was out of croutons, did not feel like going to the store, so I found this easy and quick recipe.  They were delicious and my husband ate quite a few of them prior to them making it to the salad, and then the leftovers later! Highly recommended.  I added a little extra seasoning.  They were delicious.

Tried a lower oven temp, for longer time, but it took TOO long! Turned it up to 325 and they were perfect in 20 minutes.

I really liked the flavor of these, but I was hoping the texture would be crispier all the way through. The edges were done, but the middles were still a little soft. Also, I used a slightly sweet sandwich bread which I would not recommend. It tasted odd with the seasonings. I would suggest an italian bread or sourdough.

Everyone loved these! i used an Italian bread instead of just plain white bread, Everything else i did according to the recipe, i served them on a salad of romaine lettuce with sauteed chicken, shredded Parmesan cheese, and a homemade vinaigrette.

These are delicious. I like to use storebought French bread loaves for better texture. Sliced bread is too flimsy, to me, and difficult to cut.  You can adjust the fats & seasonings to suit your taste buds and lifestyle; this is a great base. Personally, butter & olive oil taste best; but I use Butter Flavored Pam now for calorie reduction. When I'm making them for company though, you can't beat the butter/olive oil combo! EDIT 1/28/10: I usually salt mine, but today I tried sprinkling them with Molly McButter after spraying them with cooking spray (& Italian seasoning & garlic powder of course). The fake butter adds salt plus a nice buttery flavor. Give it a shot if you have some lying around.

Made it with sour dough bread, real butter and "McCormick Italian Herb Seasoning" (the grinder) it was perfect! 325 for 25 minutes but my bread cubes were larger than 1 inch. Chewy on the inside, crunchy and flavorful outside!

Who knew homemade croutons were so easy and delicious?  I used sourdough bread that was getting stale and cut the pieces fairly large, just tossed in a bowl with Italian seasoning and EVOO to coat (I just eyeballed it) then baked at 350 and flipped them over about halfway through.  Crunchy outside, slightly soft inside, very good!

Not bad. It was much easier to spray with butter flavored Pam, although doing this makes the seasonings fly around.

All reviews are "true" I use all old bread this way. I sort the bred, (sometimes) by type but it is my basic recipe for breadcurmbs... I am making a game of 'cheap' cooking..to me it is only expensive if it is WAISTED..!! I like variety so I buy lots of bread(s). It is either this or bread pudding...now there is something to make but I eat too much of that to keep in the house! Sometimes I slice a specialty bread, and serve like a cracker, or large croutons in a basket, like breadsticks.

I made these croutons last month with discount, store-brand white bread...they were fantastic!  We used them all up last night, so I'm making them tonight with left-over, stale rye bread & a small loaf of sourdough bread.  Otherwise, I'll be following the recipe exactly & I'm confident the croutons will be superb.

I use the italian seasoning from "italian dressing mix" for this recipe and it is great!  It is so awesome being able to make these for less than half the price of store-bought ones.  They taste fantastic.

Yum! These were FANTASTIC! Preparation couldn't have been any easier and the flavor was WOW! Rather than use plain 'ol sandwich bread, I cut up a loaf of Panera asiago focaccia I purchased over the weekend (it would have gone super stale otherwise). I was careful to cut only surface pieces with the yummy cheese on them to add another level of flavor to my croutons. I also used up the last bit of my garlic infused EVOO instead of melting butter as directed. I baked my croutons for 20 minutes, but they would have been fine at the 15 minute mark. NOTE: I used my croutons to top MARBALET's rich & creamy tomato basil soup. Next time, I'll be sure to use a sturdier bread (i.e. French, Italian, etc.) because my delicate focaccia croutons dissolved almost instantly. :( Overall, I was very pleased with this recipe and would make these again - if even just for a snack! Thanks for sharing Ellen! :-)

I used some left over artisan bread slices instead of cubing the bread, and served with Jaime's Minestrone. Mmmm, good stuff!

I followed the recipe except I didn't  have Italian seasoning so used "Salad Supreme" seasoning.  It drives me crazy when recipes say to use five "medium" __________ (potatoes, apples, etc.) instead of a more precise measurement such as cups or weight.  Same with this recipe which says to use five slices of bread.  I had a lot of leftover pieces of bread of various sizes in the freezer.  I decided to use all of it so had to guess at how much that might be in "slices" and increase the other ingredients accordingly.  Simple to make.  I will likely make again and use Italian seasoning.

Not only  does this make good croutons, I put the mix on French bread and toasted - mmm great garlic bread!  Less than 15 minutes was better.

I made these for a Party to go with a Caesar salad and everyone loved them! I used a Fresh loaf of French bread and it came out amazing.
