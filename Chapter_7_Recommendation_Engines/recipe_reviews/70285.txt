I made this recipe as a side dish for a spicy beer can chicken, thinking it would be a nice combo of zip (taste) and cool (by serving it chilled). While I thought it would be an okay accompaniment, I had no idea it would be the hit that it was. Everyone who tried it ended up getting seconds. My husband voted it "a keeper"; he just asked that I saute' the onions a little longer next time as he's not a big fan of crunchy onions, preferring them softer.

I only made one change to this recipe and that was to use frozen corn, which I "nuked" to thaw out before adding it to the other ingredients waiting in the skillet. The only reason was that it's not "corn season" yet, and I was too impatient to wait that long to give it a try.

Absolutely wonderful.  I used what I had on hand:  frozen corn (about 3 cups), a little yellow onion, and a regular tomato.  I sauted the corn, onion, and garlic in 2 T butter and then added the tomato, jalepeno, cilantro (about a 1/4 bunch), chopped green onion, and lemon pepper and salt.  Yummy!

Great salad!  I had some left over roasted corn so I used that vs. microwaving.  I also left out the melted butter and did a dressing made of olive oil, lime juice and a bit of sugar whisked together with a few dashes of salt and pepper.  I poured that over top and let the salad chill for a couple hours before serving. I would definitely make this again.

A great light side dish! Perfect served chilled. I grilled the ears of corn, added avocado and black-eyed peas, and took out the peppers and it was very good.

I added a little lime juice, cut way back on the butter, left out the jalepeno (kids were eating this) and added diced red peppers. I also pickeled the red onions in rice wine vinegar over night, then added them to the salad. AWESOME!!!!!

Delicious salad.  I sauted the corn (after boiling the ears of corn and cutting off cob), red bell pepper, and red onion in the butter for about 5 minutes.  I didn't use the garlic.  Then after this mix chilled... I added the cilantro and tomato and spices.  I served it in the center of a bed of leaf lettuce salad.  The presentation was pretty and it was a hit at a dinner party.

LOVE this.  I only used about 2 T. butter, and 1/2 a jalapeno.  I also added about 3/4 cups cooked black beans-- perfecto!  This also makes a fantastic salsa type dip for tortilla chips.  Mmmmmmmm.

This is a fantastic recipe for using up left over grilled corn. I also love it because it uses ingredients I always have on hand. I usually make it with olive oil instead of butter, and, if I have it, a splash of fresh lime juice adds some great extra flavor. Quick, easy and inexpensive, not to mention really tasty. Thanks!

What a fab little salad. The garlic adds a pleasantly mild zippiness. I made it exactly as stated except I didn't have the lemon herb seasoning. Next time I will double the quantity and also try a spritz of lemon juice, enough to taste but not so much as to make the salad wet. Delicious!

Delicious! I made tacos and Spanish rice for a dinner party, and this is the recipe everyone asked about! I sauteed the onions and garlic in the butter, then added the jalapenos,. I added two bags of frozen corn to the pan with the tomatoes and cilantro and kept it over low heat until dinner was served.

This was a really good dish and we all really enjoyed it, but next time I will make one change.  I made this up in the morning so that the flavors would have all day to meld, because I wanted to serve it cold.  The ingredients worked really well together, but the melted butter was odd for a cold dish.  Of course, as the dish chilled the butter did also.  It left a funny looking coating on the corn and tomatoes.  If I was serving this warm, I think the butter would have worked.  The next time I will sub olive oil in place of the butter.  I am still giving this dish 5-stars because everyone liked it and said “yes” to me making it again.  This will be really good when the fresh summer corn and tomatoes are in season in Indiana.  Thank you Ds. R for sharing .

I used one regular tomato (baseball sized), frozen corn that I had cut off from fresh last summer, and a small amount of lemon pepper instead of the Mrs. Dash.  I couldn't imagine butter in a salad so I used olive oil instead.  Refreshing hot weather salad.

Five stars because it was so flavourful and so simple. It took 10 minutes to get this together, although I cheated and used canned corn. No worries as long as it has enough time in the fridge to chill and allow the flavours to blend. Nice side dish recipe. Very simple.

I think this tasted good, but when I chilled it, the butter hardened and I had to reheat it.

Nice salad. I put this on top of lettuce and ened up putting some black olives in it. I did use cherry tomatoes and green onions instead of the roma and red onion.

YUM!  What a wonderful summer side dish.  I made mine with 1 Tbsp. EVOO to reduce the fat content from the butter.  Also used about 2 Tbsp. of lime juice as suggested and threw in some red pepper that I had from the garden and black beans that were left over from a previous recipe.  Very light and simple but full of flavor!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

That corn+tomato+(black bean)+cilantro combination always have a very fresh flavor and is a perfect compliment to any Mexican style dinner. I used 1 1/2 bags frozen corn (thawed by running under water), olive oil instead of butter, added black beans... I usually don't measure out quantities in a salad like this but just eyeball ingredients together. Cilantro has a strong flavor, so I would think half a bunch is too much, as others remarked. This is a reliable staple and even better as leftovers!

We enjoyed this very much.  I served it warm, added spices to give it some heat...cayenne pepper and cumin (one of my favorite spices).  A nice accompaniment to our 4th of July meal.  Used frozen corn and it was great!

I'm not quite sure if this is a 4 star, but it wasn't a 3 star either. Somewhere in between. The mix of veggies was definitely a hit. The butter sorta laid a thickness on it that just wasn't what I was hoping for. I wanted something lighter. I'm not sure what I'd do to it, to make it pleasing to me and my family but I'm not giving up on it. I'll keep trying and keep y'all posted!!

Delicious and fresh! I used olive oil instead of butter. And i didn't have any lemon-herb seasoning, so i just grated some fresh lemon zest and it was very tasty:)

This is similar to a corn salad that I make except I use frozen corn straight from the freezer and I add diced seeded cucumber and use green bell pepper in place of jalapeno, and I add Ranch dressing. My kids eat it while the corn is still frozen, they love it so much. Either way, it's still a great salad!

This is tasty either as a side dish or as a garnish for other meat or seafood. I don't know that the butter is particularly necessary. Yes, it may add a slight richness to the flavor, but it also adds calories too. I will probably leave the butter out or reduce it next time. I used fresh tomatoes, corn, and jalapeno peppers, which really jacked up the freshness factor of this recipe. It's refreshing and delicious.

Oh yum! I just happened to have a bunch of fresh cilantro and a couple of tomatoes that were needing to be used when I stumbled upon this recipe. I saute the onion & garlic in 2 T. olive oil as I want to eat this chilled (if it lasts that long) and reading other reviews,  it sounds like the butter doesn't quite work well on the chilled salad. The I added 3 cups thawed corn, a can of black beans (rinsed), and since I was out of lemon pepper seasoning, I just added lemon juice and pepper. Took everything off the heat and added the cilantro,  tomatoes, a diced green onion, and some salt. Then since it seemed to still be missing some flavor, I added a little (a couple taps maybe?) bit of lime juice. Very good. Light and guilt free!

This is the first time I've ever reviewed a recipe although I use this site all the time.  This is really yummy.  I left out the tomato and used finely chopped fresh red pepper for color.  Used green onions instead of red onions.  Added a big squeeze of both lime and lemon juice & nch of cumin.  
So many veggies could be added to this delicious and easy salad.  I'm serving it with the Refried Beans Without the Refry & Sour Cream Chicken (but I use beef) Enchiladas --both from this site.  Much better than any Mexican restaurant.

I just took a couple cans of corn and threw it all together. I left the jalapeno out because I'm not too fond of hot foods and I may have added a little too much cilantro but it's good for you so I can't really complain. Overall it is very tasty and makes a really good side dish for taco night!

Corn and tomatoes are in season here so I was looking for something to take advance of this.  I thought this would just be a little side dish, nothing special but OK.  I was wrong. We had this last night, and it was great!  Simple, super delicious, would definitely make again, maybe even tonight.

I also added the juice of half a lime and will likely add more cilantro...I cooked my corn, but have eaten a salad similar to this with uncooked corn, simply cut right off a raw cob.

Delicious as a dip with tortilla chips as well.  This didn't even make it to the dinner table as a salad - the guys started eating it with chips and next thing I knew it was gone.

Very nummy!  I used sweet white corn (and 4 ears instead of 3) to tone down the onion.  I brought this to a 4th of July bbq, and brought home an empty bowl!  Everyone wanted the recipe.

It was a good base but not amazing. I felt like there was too much butter but that may just be my personal taste. I also added lemon juice. I will make it again but alter it a bit...but I think that is the point. I ended up mixing it into the pasta and zucchini that I had made and it was really good like that. It's a great start for a fun side dish that can be altered as needed.

This was good, but not our favorite. I served this chilled, but it didn't look too appetizing because the butter solidified and clumped up a bit. Tasted fine, but not very exciting. Thanks for sharing! :)

wonderful recipe, tried it as a side dish with our enchiladas and found it was a great topping for them. Cilantro is strong and would add a little less next time. Great way to use up summer veggies from the garden. I also added some black beans.

I've made this twice now. the first time with fresh corn and the second with frozen corn,thawed. both were very good. excellent fresh flavor and crisp texture. I warmed the chilled salad a few seconds in the microwave to melt the butter but it's not really necessary.  I cook the fresh corn on the cob by stripping the husk and silk and then wrapping  each ear in a piece of wax paper and microwave a few minutes depending on size and number of ears. very easy with no pot or mess.

This is my go to during corn season.  The recipe is great and is a favorite.  Using the Microwave with the husks works perfectly too.  This is one to have fun with and add your favorite stuff because the base of the recipe is excellent.

I used frozen corn instead of cobbed and I didn't roast it.  I used olive oil instead of butter because I thought butter would get really weird in a salad when it was chilled.  And I cut way back on the lemon because my husband isn't a fan.  Still....I feel as though I followed the recipe closely enough to submit a positive review. This is GOOD.  It is easy and inexpensive, too.

Made as written except with frozen corn, without the jalapeno and cut back on the cilantro.  Will make again but using the suggestions of less butter and adding red pepper.  Also sauteed the red onion.

Oh is this good!  I added about 1-2 T of fresh squeezed lemon juice and used The Space Hunter All Purposed Chef's Shake -- maybe 3-4 pinches.  Since corn season gone in Chicago, I used Green Giant a little less than 2 cans of Steam Crisp White Corn.  Steam Crisp lives up to it's name for tasting fresh and crisp -- hard to believe coming from a can.

I was curious as to how it would be cold having butter in it but I liked it, even though not like oil based cold salads.  Cold suggested in recipe and I love cold salads.  Ate a lot of it right away after chilled.  
And this morning, I was curious about heating it, and WOW, loved it just as much.

I was very pleased w/recipe.

Really good and simple salad! Used a canned corn instead of husked for a shortcut and sauteed the corn in some cilantro butter I had in the freezer.  Wish I had made some rice and put this on top with some guac and cheese....it tastes just like chipotle! Quick 20 minute meal.

8 14 15 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/70285/cilantro-tomato-corn-salad/ ... I halved the recipe & cheated.  I thawed 1 1/2c frozen corn; added remaining ingredients - 1c cilantro leaves, chopped.  Put everything in a bowl in the order listed (so the butter would warm the onion, garlic & cilantro especially).  Quite good, but so buttery.  'Think less butter & perhaps subbing with half olive oil - especially if it's being served chilled.

I tweeked it a little because I was making this for a crowd, using 9 ears of corn which I boiled for 5 minutes instead of nuking. I also had no cilantro so that was left out. I received RAVE reviews and will definetly serve again. Thanks for sharing!

This side dish is a winner and once I had my first bite I knew that this would be going onto my favorites list.  The sweetness of the corn with the butter, the little bit of heat from the pepper and the crisp flavor of the cilantro are a great combination for goodness.

I used a bag of Trader Joe's fire roasted corn witch added even more flavor.  I cut the butter down to two tablespoons, putting the butter and the corn in a bowl and microwaving it for three minutes.  I substituted a Serrano chili for the Jalapeno and it gave it some very nice heat.

I will be making this one throughout the summer.  Enjoy.

I scaled this down to two ears of corn. Not wanting raw onion, I sauteed it with the jalapeno for ~ 8 min in butter. I then added the corn, tomato and cilantro and cooked for a few min and added salt and pepper. I tossed it with a dressing of olive oil, lime juice and a bit of sugar. I forgot to add the garlic and added it after the fact. To be honest, it tasted better without it. Very nice blend of different flavors. Thanks Ds R!

Everyone loves this recipe, there is nothing like fresh corn. The only change I made was to put  the onions in a microwaveable bowl and put the butter on top then melted it. It cooked and softens the onions a bit.  This is a great alternative to corn on the cob or a great way to use leftover corn on the cob.

I loved this.  Didn't think I would because I don't like cilantro very much.  I also only used half a jalapeno because I wanted my kids to eat it.  :)  Great flavor all around.  I will make it again.

Oh goodness.  I'm very literal.  Please add "sauté the onion to the instructions.  This one had so much potential but my 1/2 raw onion made this one fit for dragon consumption.

Made it twice in the last week... great way to use a bumper crop of cherry tomatoes!  (I just substituted olive oil for the butter despite the reviews raving about the butter... didn't want to risk the congealed look at a picnic.)  Second time I tossed in some leftover quinoa for a lunch salad... yum.

Great Salad. I also used frozen corn that I cooked before hand and added a touch of white wine vinegar to give it a little more of a tangy taste. It tastes best served cold and with BBQ chicken. I will be adding this to my summer salad box of recipes.

This was soooo incredibly good! The flavours complimented each other perfectly! I did make one change - and only because I am cutting calories. I omitted the melted butter and replaced it with 1 tbsp of lime juice. I don't think it could have worked better! Thanks so much for the recipe.

A great last-minute side dish! I was looking for something quick and easy, and this was perfect. I was worried there would be too much onion, but it was very tasty and not too strong with all the other flavors. Don't skip the butter, it blends the flavors together very well.

Delicious and easy! I followed the recipe exactly. The only change I made was just before serving I dressed the salad with a TINY bit of ranch dressing (just about a tbs). It was fantastic. This salad can be served warm but I enjoyed it chilled to accompany my grilled steaks. EXCELLENT!!!!!

Just made this for dinner and it was amazing! I added some lime juice as well as some salsa seasoning I had. Next time I would cut down on the butter and add more peppers just to make it healthier and with a bit more zip. All in all it is a keeper!

Like other reviewers, I found the addition of butter to be odd for this recipe. Taking their advice, I skipped the butter. Instead, I added rinsed black beans and lime juice. The result was amazing!

Delicious!!  I used 5 ears of corn. Added garlic powder and season salt.  I like cilantro so to me it was not too much.  This was the first to go at the cookout.  In my rotation of recipes!

I used 3 fresh ears of corn & a container of cherry tomatoes diced in half.  Used 2 red peppers. Did 1/2 cup lime juice 1/4 cup olive oil. Loved it! Thanks!

Great summer salad! I did cut down on the butter and added a pinch of cumin (and some black beans) but I did taste test it before I added those.  Very light and fresh tasting, love the zip of the jalepenos.  Thank you!!

This was a great recipe, I cooked 4 slices of bacon and crumbled into the salad, very good....I also left out the cilantro not a fan of that.

This was good but be careful w/ the cilantro.  I used 1/5 of a bunch and I should have used even less.  Cilantro is an  awesome herb but powerful in taste.

This recipe is fantastic! Made it for an outdoor summer birthday party in South Texas. It was a huge success! I added some black beans to it and also some italian dressing to bind it all together! Definitely will make again!

This is the perfect side dish for Tex/Mex! I made mine with frozen Soycotash from Trader Joe's (shelled edamame, corn and red peppers). I didn't have any lemon Mrs. Dash, so I just used some lemon juice and served it luke-warm. Yummy!

I made this to top salad greens.  Used oil instead of butter, which was a mistake.  I would like to try again with butter and serve warm as noted in the instructions.

Very yummy salad!  Flavors blend better overnight.  Stays nice in the frig for a few days.  I added a can of black beans, rinsed, and increased the seasonings/liquid by about 1/3.

This was a big hit with my Mexican meal.  I did saute the corn, onions, garlic and pepper in the butter. Great side dish!

My family loved this recipe. It is a lot like a salsa. We all agreed it is much better served at room temperature rather then cold if there happens to be any leftovers. I have made this a couple of times already.

So tasty! I used less cilantro than called for, about 1/4th of the bunch. Other than that change, I followed the recipe as written.

What a surprise! It was very delicious and a nice side to our grilled chicken. I didn't use the lemon (dash) seasoning and it was fine. Everyone liked it.
