This is wonderful! Everyone in my family loved it including my very picky son. I used ingredients I already had. Frozen beans instead of fresh, onion soup mix instead of vegtable and then added a generous tablespoon of Herbes De Provence. Delicious!

Overall very good. Used a leftover spiral ham cut into chunks. Could use a bit more flavor.  Will make again.

A mixture of green and yellow wax beans is always pretty, esp w/the flecks of color the soup adds.  Also, I leave out the ham hock if there are vegetarians in the crowd.  Still tastes great!

I made this exactly as written including the 1 Tablespoon of black pepper.  I believe that might be a typo because it was extremely hot.  I am surprised no one else mentioned the pepper.  The dry soup gave it a great flavor and I will make it again but with MUCH less pepper.

Very good.  I make this type of recipe a lot in the summer time.  It is a favorite of my husband and son.  First time I've made it adding the vegetable soup packet and sugar.  It was very good, but not sure why the sugar is needed.  I served this with 'Greek Veggie Salad' from AR and garlic bread with sliced tomatoes, popped under the broiler.
