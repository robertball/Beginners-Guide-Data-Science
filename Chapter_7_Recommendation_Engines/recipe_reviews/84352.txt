This was so different.  I think it was 5 stars easy.  Wife gave it 4.  Didn't change anything.  But as a sauce lover, the 16 oz of pasta spread the sauce thin.  Cook 12 oz of pasta or more sauce.  EXCELLENT!

This recipe was very good, although I made several changes to make it easier and to use what I had on hand...I used minced garlic in olive oil with the red pepper and onions. Didn't have pancetta, so I substituted 2-2.5oz pkgs of real bacon bits, and 2-14oz cans of Italian diced tomatoes for the plum tomatoes, then cooked as directed with the wine, which gave it a wonderful flavor.  In addition, I added 1 cup shredded motzarella along with the Romano cheese and mixed it all together...It was a tad salty, so next time I won't add salt, but my husband loved it and it was really easy.

This recipe was very good and I'll definitely make it again.  I did make a couple of changes to the recipe.  I didn't peel the tomatoes and I didn't mince the garlic.  I smashed the garlic with my knife which made it easier to remove once cooked.  I also added on extra clove of garlic.

This recipe is Great! It is sooo quick too. I used a little less red peper flakes b/c I can't handle any spice, but this was delicious. I added some freshly grated parm. after I put it in individual bowls. Very tasty...thanks for the recipe!

I loved this! You can do most of the prep the night before, so when you get in from work, it's done in minutes! My husband said it tasted even better than it looked.

I sauteed the garlic and red peppers together, then just added everything into there...yum!
