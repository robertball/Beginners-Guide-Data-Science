Let me start by saying that I did not make the chicken wing part of this recipe, but have been on the hunt for the best peanut sauce recipe and this one is spot-on!  The only small changes I made was to add more garlic and red pepper flakes for some kick.  The sauce was perfect with sautéed chicken thigh pieces. I can’t wait to try the chicken wings next time.  Thank you for this great recipe!

I loved this recipe.  Next time I will probably add hot chili oil or red pepper as I prefer it with a little kick.  As written, the sauce is slightly bland.  I did double the honey to balance the flavors better.  I will definitely make it again.

I made this tonight but used cut up chicken breast instead.  I coaster the pieces and put them on a baking rack over a cookie sheet.  My husband LOVED the sauce and stated it is his new favorite.  We used the sauce for the chicken and for potstickers.

Fantastic. My family has a habit of chicken wings once a week because my hubby loves chicken wings a lot. I am always trying to find different recipes for the wings, and this one really hit the spot. 
My husband grilled it instead of us broiling it. His day off, he loves to grill, and I wasn't going to deny him that. Next time I will probably broil it, but it was really good grilled.
I couldn't find the ginger, and the cilantro was only grounded, but it still tasted really great without them anyhow. My husband said they were fantastic and so did my daughter. This will probably be a recipe we start using more often. My husband said it was great but next time he'd add a little sriracha to his. (He likes things hotter.)

Mine needed additional cooking time (about 15 minutes total), and once they were cooked through I sprinkled on the sesame seeds, some chopped honey roasted peanuts and toasted those under the broiler for another few minutes. Sprinkled some lightly dried parsley on - and these made a beautiful and delicious meal!

Great recipe. The incorporation of Reynolds wrap makes it  so much easier to slop on the peanut sauce with abandon. My chicken had a great texture and a hearty taste.

I would add two things to this.   If it is too close to the broiler on high it will burn quickly.   The second would be to place the chicken on a rack so that they are not sitting in the grease.  Other than that the flavor of the dish was excellent.  I will be making this one again.
