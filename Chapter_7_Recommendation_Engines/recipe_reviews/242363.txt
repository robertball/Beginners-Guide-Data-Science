So hearty and satisfying for a meatless recipe, and so yummy and good for you. Love the idea of the vinaigrette on top. I take it one further: Chop up some celery heart (the sweet-tasting, yellow-colored stalks at the core of your celery bunch, along with the leaves) and sprinkle on top of each bowl before adding the vinaigrette. It's like a little salad on top, and it adds a little crunch.

I will make again.  I would add more balsamic vinegar and a touch of Worcestershire sauce.

Very lovely blend of flavors.  I didn't use the optional vinaigrette and used dried thyme instead of a sprig. Used consume granules instead of chicken or vegetable.  Very nice lentil soup with no tweaking needed.

Being fond of garlic, I added a bit extra.

I've never liked lentil soup, but this one is outstanding!!! It is not earthy tasting like most others. I used dried thyme instead of fresh, and forgot to do the vinaigrette when it was done, But this soup was amazing. It'll be on my repeat list!

The soup was very good. The vinaigrette proved to be too much for my family, but we'll make the soup again!

Delicious! I have been making lentil soup for years, trying many different recipes and I think I found the ONE. It's delicious and the garlic vinaigrette drizzle is excellent. If I would add/change anything, it would be to add more garlic to the vinaigrette (one more clove), and add some shaved Parmesan to each bowl of soup. Serve it up with some crusty French bread, and a full-bodied red wine and you have a gourmet meal! (I also added some chicken sausage which made the soup even heartier.)

I was surprised at how good this was since it was so easy to make!  I added extra balsamic (probably triple the amount) to the soup itself by accident but turned out to be a good mistake ;)  Didn't use thyme (not a fan) but otherwise followed recipe exactly and was really good.  Will make again.

I have made this several times. My family loves it. The vinaigrette really makes it!  I increased the garlic--my family loves garlic! It gets better a day or so later.

Thyme made it taste musty.  The vinegar was too much.

Excellent lentil soup for vegetarians and meat eaters alike.   It was easy to make and very satisfying.  I brought to work for my lunch with a crusty piece of bread.  I would not change the recipe at all......it was simple but delicious.--Nansmeister
