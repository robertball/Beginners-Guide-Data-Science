Betheny's Frito Pie Haiku: "Very, very dry. Gotta use a good chili. Shouldn't have baked it." Would've been much happier if we'd get heated the chili and layered it in a bowl w/ cheese and the Fritos, rather than baking, b/c the whole thing just turned way too dry. I used a previously-frozen homemade chili, and since it's the "starring" ingredient, I'm glad that I used it as this recipe really is only as good as one's chili. The combo of chili, cheese, onions, and Fritos is fantastic (cilantro on top for me too!); we just weren't thrilled w/ the results from it having gone into the oven.

They have been making Frito chili Pie in Texas for as long as my husband (who was born here) can remember. Open a small bag of Fritos - down the long side, add heated Texas chili, cheese, and onion (optional), eat, and enjoy.

I have never heard of a baked Frito pie, I always just put Fritos in a bowl and cover with chili, cheese and onions, often adding jalapenos, diced tomatoes a dollop of sour cream.

I have made it for years. I just crush my fritos and add my heated chili and cheese. I also love chopped tomatoes on top.

This is nuts.  Everybody knows that a Frito Pie is served IN the bag of Fritos - use the individual sized bags.  I make mine with my world-famous (OK, household-famous) vegetarian chili.  Must be topped with extra cheese, raw onion, sour cream, and jalapeno slices.

I have been eating this for 72 years.  It was even served in our school cafeteria in El Paso, Tx.  It is a favorite of ours.  We do add some liquid that we rinse out from the can of chile.   By the way, I like the fritos soft in my casserole.

My mother made this as far back as I can remember.  She called it Mock Enchilada Casserole.  I make it every time I have left over home made chili.  One tip:  take the Fritos out by hand, don't dump...that cuts back on the salt.  Bake just until cheese is fully melted.

I have been making Frito Pie for three generations.  The only thing I never do is use chile that contains beans.  Also, I sort of crush the corn chips for the bottom layer before baking.  This makes the bottom layer absorb the chile flavor a bit better. This is a real Kids Favorite.  Kids of any age! Oh, yeah. Use lots of napkins. :-)

My grandmother would chop up some iceberg lettuce, cut up some tomatoes, add Fritos and shredded cheddar, and pour Hormel chili over it - she called it Mexican Salad, and its halfway healthy! I've loved it for 50+ years!

I defrosted some chili that was in the freezer, and it was very thick.  I think this would have  been better had my chili had a little more liquid, allowing the bottom layer of fritos to soften a bit.  Also, oven temperatures vary, so I’ll start checking mine at 10 minutes the next time as mine dried out a little.  Nice to have a new way to serve leftover chili, and it was enjoyed today for lunch.  This is really pretty good and soooo easy.  Would make again!

I loved it, just like when I was a kid.  I skipped the cheddar cheese, because I didn't have any, and used sour cream, instead, putting dollops  around the top of the casserole.  I also, added several, very thinly slices of jalapeno pepper . It was so delicious that I wanted seconds.  I fought hard with myself and was a good girl.  I couldn't wait to eat more the next day.   I'm rating it five smiling stars.

Best made with home made chili. Now I layer chili, corn chips, onions, cheese and layer once again in a baking dish ending with grated cheese....this is a very forgiving recipe and have made it a zillion times for my cowboys! Have fun with it and create your own dish....After removing from the oven, serve with big dollops of sour cream and a sprig of cilantro. YeeHA

This turned out really good with my homemade chili! I had this during the football game. Good stuff and super simple! Next time I will add some sliced black olives to enhance it. Thanks for sharing Bethany!

"about as Texan as you can get." Boy howdy isn't that the truth.  I first tasted "Frito Pie" in the BX at Sheppard Air Force Base in Texas in 1966. In the 50 years since, I've introduced it to scores of people, each of whom eventually added their own twist to the recipe.  The one I remember from the BX was simple, elegant and cheap. Served in a paper french fry boat, a bed of corn chips was slathered with about a cup of spicy chili with beans and mounded with shredded cheddar cheese.  The whole thing then was baked just long enough to melt the cheese, then sprinkled liberally with chopped onion just before serving.  I've also had the chili in a bag of corn chips which was ok, but kind of messy.

I thought I had some homemade chilli frozen,  and so I thawed  it out to make this dish.   Unfortunately, it was not chilli but spaghetti sauce. LOL  It had lots of hamburger, tomato and mushrooms.  I added some homemade beans and went ahead and made it.  I'm sure it would have been better with chili, but I enjoyed it just the same.

If it isn't served in the Frito bag, it isn't Frito Pie! Brings back memories of college in West Texas, carhops, A&W Rootbeer in a frosty mug and Frito Pie!  Best midnight meal ever!

This recipe is good for when you're serving a group. The original frito pie as I recall it, you just open up a single serving bag of fritos along the center seam and pour some hot prepared chili, with or without beans, over the fritos. Diced onions and shredded cheddar or mexican blend cheese are nice additions. If the chili is hot , it should melt the cheese without resorting to baking in the oven unless you add too much cheese. My experience with baking in the oven is the chips tend to get a bit soggy. I like mine still mostly crispy. Thanks for sharing this recipe so others who have never heard of it can experience this delicious simple easy meal.

I use Wolf Brand Chili without beans (personal preference).  And I add green, yellow and red bell peppers in addition to the onions (total quantity = onions) prior to baking.  I also use finely shredded sharp cheddar cheese or a Mexican blend.  After dishing it up, I top with sour cream and jalapenos before devouring.  This I give 4.5 stars.

Great stuff!!! Just make sure your chili has some soup to it. Otherwise it may come out drier than you would like. Really good taste and so quick and easy. Makes a great busy day supper.

Delicious with adding onions! I’ve always had this “staple snack” but never thought to add anything. I added also a few jalapeños for a special kick.

I made it exactly to the recipe. Next time I'm going to add some green onions, diced tomatoes, and some chili seasonings. It needed a little oomph.

I've made this for many years served in individual bowls with home  made chili.  Chili made with pinto beans, Bueno red chili and chili meat.  Top with shredded Colby cheese, sour cream, guacamole and salsa!  Baking it would be too dry.

Up here in Central NYState we call it Chili pie, and we only heat the chili before placing it over the Frito's. Also use melted Velveeta and a little shredded cheddar. That make the cheese ooze down thru the chili and chips! And you can add what ever your heart desires- salsa,sour cream,jalapenos etc...

This was a terrible recipe.  Totally awful ingredients.  Not at all like recipes I find on allrecipes.  I would never serve this to my family.

Very similar to a recipe I have for Frito Pie but mine has added ground beef more cheese and lots more spices. The serving size of this is way to skimpy. If we didn't have company over this as written would be enough for the 2 of us.

Very easy to just cook in microwave using saran wrap. I add a can of Rotel tomatoes,green chilies with lime, to my chili for more flavor and moisture.
