Just like the honey butter my great aunt Bessie from Louisiana used to serve with her corn fritters.  A pat of this is great on warm cinnamon rolls or corn bread.  Yum!!  On a side note, if you want honey butter that is squeezable use the squeezable margarine instead of the butter in this recipe.

The flavor is excellent.  The only negative is that the mixture separated while the butter was on the table during dinner.  It doesn't look very appetizing when it separates.  I recommend preparing the butter well in advance so it has several hours to set up in the fridge; maybe then it will make it through the meal without getting too soft and separating.

Delicious! I have been mixing butter and honey for years and knew something was missing. The sweetened condensed milk does the trick. I didn't have problems mixing like the others, I started with spreadable butter. Perfect.

Oh my goodness,if I could rate this more than 5 stars,I would! I was looking for a good honey butter recipe and came across this one.As soon as I saw sweetened condensed milk,I knew I would love it.I ran out of canned condensed milk so I had to make my own and it still worked perfectly.I doubled the recipe so I have plenty of this delicious butter on hand and I also used my hand mixer on high and it came out to a nice creamy whipped texture.Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

This was very light and fluffy and creamy. I used a mixer and my deep bowl so it didn't splatter all over. It took about 4 minutes to get the right color and texture. This started out very wet and liquid-y but it did whip up into a whipped cream type stuff.

For me, this didn't have enough honey. I ended up using over half the honey in one of those 'honeybear' bottles. About 7 oz. of honey. I was trying  to recreate the honey butter from back in the day (jr. high and high school, they used to have bottles of it at every table for the dinner rolls!). This didn't do it for me. Too much butter-not enough honey.

Absolutely delicious! I tripled the recipe since honey butter is a favorite throughout this household.  If you're thinking about mixing this in a blender, have fun! I started out with the blender because i already had it out, but ended up switching over to the food processor because it was so thick and the blades were getting stuck on high.

This was my first time making honey butter and it was excellent!  It was smooth and creamy and the perfect sweetness for our cornbread.  The only thing I would add is if you use a stick of butter that you cut it into chunks when putting it in the food processor.  We will be adding this to our menu when ever we have cornbread.  We can't wait to try it on biscuits.  Thank you for sharing.

Simply amazing! Using half-melted butter, my visiting niece whipped the butter and condensed milk with a fork, adding honey to taste. It ended up being a very sweet batch of butter and tasted delicious on extremely dense bread when toasted or straight from the loafpan. 
After about half of a day or so after making it, we jarred the rest and stuck it in the fridge. Nevertheless, it was quickly taken out and demolished, along with the bread, before my niece left.

Wonderful taste.  Never thought to add sweetened condensed milk to honey butter but it added a nice creaminess.  I also added some cinnamon.

I loved this!  Adding the sweetened condensed milk was a great addition to the normal way.  I was looking for a recipe that added marshmallow sauce, but this was a nice find instead!

Made the recipe exactly as is, except doubled it. Amazing! My husband doesn't eat buns very often but had at least 3 or 4 during dinner because he loved the butter so much. My parents also loved it (so much so that they made me leave most of it behind for them). I will be making this more often, especially to bring to family dinners. :)

Have made honey butter many times over the years.  Never tried it quite like this recipe though.  It whipped up to a creamy consistency that did not tend to separate when warm.  Will definitely use again.

It was perfect, made it to go with cornbread.  Doubled the recipe.  I don't have a food processor or mixer, so I had to use my blender... hard to clean up, but it worked.  Plan on using it for the kids on pancakes, waffles, toast.

I made this specifically to go with the cornbread recipe I found on this site. I followed the recipe exactly and it was a big hit at our workplace chili cook-off.  I will definitely make again.
