4 stars because the flavor was really good - only change to the ingredients was that I used about half the ginger, personal preference. Please please please do not cook this for 30-40 minutes under the broiler! The chicken will turn to jerky and the butter and onions will definitely burn! I used 6 ounce boneless breasts, about 1" thick and they were done at 10-11 minutes. Add a minute or two if your chicken is a little bit thicker.  Even the biggest chicken breast you can find wouldn't take 30 minutes. The drippings were tasty drizzled over rice!
