I made this stroganoff several times and it has now become a staple fancy dish! My boyfriend (now husband 7/2006) claims this is his all time favorite dish that I make. Over time I made a few modifications to this recipe:
(1) Marinate the meat in red or white wine for 1-2 hrs in the fridge prior to cooking. This adds a really nice flavor to the beef and tenderizes the meat, and you can skip the addition of the wine at the end as this can thin out the sauce.
(2)  Use 1 medium yellow onion (sliced or chopped) and use the green onions for garnish instead.
(3)  Garlic is a must (be liberal unless you are on a date)!
(4)  Corn starch works just as well as flour or you can also use 2 tbsp of each. I found it easier to dissolve them in a few tbsp of beef broth before adding it to the skillet otherwise it's really difficult to dissolve flour/corn starch in the sauce.
(5)  Add 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce along with the prepared mustard.
(6)  Add two cans (4 oz each) of sliced mushrooms and simmer with the beef instead of at the end of cook time. Fresh sliced mushrooms (8 oz) work well also.
(7)  Add 1/3 cup cream cheese and 1/3 cup sour cream that the end--trust me this is key!!
TIP: found it VERY difficult to push aside the browned meat and then cook the onions and add the flour to the skillet the first few times I made this. Instead, I now remove the browned meat to a plate, cook the onion by itself, and then return the meat back to the pan and add broth with dissolved flour/starch.

This was the best beef stroganoff I've ever had!  I did marinate the beef in red wine.  I also used yellow onions instead of the green onions. I did also add 1 TBSP. minced garlic. I added 2 TBSP of cornstarch to the beef broth before adding it to the pan and cut the flour to 2 TBSP.  I found it easier to take the meat and onions out while thickening the sauce and then adding them back to the pan.  I let this simmer for about an hour and a half and the meat was really tender.  I think you could put it in a crock pot too and that would be delicious.  At the end I added 1/3 c. cream cheese and 1/3 c. sour cream and omitted the white wine since I marinated in red. The cream cheese was a great addition which I saw from another reviewer. It was absolutely delicious!!!  My 17 month old daughter loved it.  This will be a staple in our home.

"I'm speechless.  I'm actionless.  All i can do is sit here and revel in how good this is!"  Direct quote from husband.  We did follow the suggestions of other reviewers:  omitted butter (used non-stick frying pan) for healthier meal; used sirloin instead of beef chuck; added 1 Tbs. Worchestershire sauce;  added two garlic cloves; used 1 diced yellow onion instead of green onions; and used fresh mushrooms.

Perfect without any changes as far as I am concerned. I don't rate recipes a 5 if they need changing to be right.

As for the food snob that thinks if a home cook can make it it only deserves 3 stars....get a life! Some of us have other things to do other than wreck a simple recipe by fooling around all day trying to be a "chef". Simple is often better.

This is delicious and doesn't taste like a "simple" recipe. Don't be put off by the snobs!

This is fantastic!!! I’ve used this recipe for Stroganoff several times with only minor changes … used fresh (sautéed) mushrooms and eliminated the white wine (because it thinned the sauce too much) and my family has always enjoyed it.  But, after reading some of the reviews, I decided to try marinating the beef (sirloin) in red wine for a couple of hours and added a chopped clove of garlic (at the same time the green onions were added).  These two changes along with using the fresh mushrooms have made this an absolute family favorite.

This is some of the best beef stroganoff ever!  I used sirloin instead of chuck roast and let that marinate in red wine, garlic, and Worcestershire for two hours before cooking.  I cooked that then plated it.  I used a combination of green onions and vidalia, fresh mushrooms instead of canned, 1 Tbsp. of Worcestershire, white wine and minced garlic.  After I added the meat back in I reserved a bit of the broth to mix with 2 Tbsp. of corn starch.  I added that to thicken then added the sour cream and a bit of cream cheese. This was fabulous served over egg noodles - YUM!

Mercy!  This one offers up a most incredible flavor, a unique combination of down-home and exotic.  The recipe as written is no doubt wonderful, but I improvised a bit based on experience, instinct and what I had available.  I followed suggestion of marinating the beef in red wine.  Then, because the wine permeated the dish all through, because of the beef marinade, I didn't add the white wine in at the end.  I also added 1/3 cup of cream cheese as recommended by other reviewers.  That part was fine, but I'm not so sure the extra calories are worth it.  I didn't detect a significant difference in the flavor pre cream cheese to post cream cheese.  I used real mushrooms, not canned.  That is highly recommended. I sauteed the mushrooms with the green onions and removed them from the skillet to the same bowl where I rested the beef.  Too, I used light sour cream. Hey, there is enough richness in the recipe, using light sour cream will not make one iota of difference.  I served the recipe on packaged noodles.  I'll try rice next time.  Even my picky wife, who shuns flavors that depart from basic meat and potatoes--especially dishes involving wine--said she "loved it."

Absolutely Wonderful! As suggested by previous cooks, I marinated the beef in a white wine for a few hours and then didn't add any wine at the end (used a little extra broth instead). I used a whole yellow onion instead of the green. It seemed like a lot of onion and I was nervous at first, but after an hour of simmering, they practically diappeared. Just before the hour of simmering, I added 2 cloves of finely chopped garlic, 1/2 tsp of worcheschire sauce, and 1/2 tsp of Jack Daniels mustard. It was sooo good! It was slightly difficult mixing it all in one pan, but it all turned out great! It made just enough for 2 large helpings, and an extra bowl for leftovers tomorrow!

GREAT recipe! I have made stroganoff over and over before trying this recipe and never gotten it right. This time, for the first time, it worked. I did use sherry instead of wine, *fresh* mushrooms, and beef bouillion, not stock. But is was YUMMY! Great recipe even for a klutz like me!

I had a chuck roast I didn't know what to do with..I didn't even know stroganoff could be made with this cut of beef! It was SUPERB, and loved by my family and neighbors who we share cooking duties with! 2 husbands and 3 teenaged young men proclaim this to be the best! The secret is long slow cooking! The green onions were different and perfect since I had some I needed to use up! Great recipe! I served with noodles... BTW..Taking the all fat off the meat and cutting it up took almost an hour!!!

This recipe is okay. There is a beef stroganoff recipe on the back of the Campbells beef broth can that is so much better (and easier!). The mustard gives it great flavor, but to me the butter is overkill. It's just too much. I cut the amount of butter down and you were still able to taste it. I used top sirloin instead of chuck roast, added 1T of worcestshire sauce, and it turned out better. I didn't have green onions, so I didn't add those. Also, I skipped simmering it for an hour. I just brown the meat, then do the rest immediately. It turned out fine! Also, to avoid the flour clumping situation, don't add it directly to the skillet. I mixed it with the beef broth in a bowl, then added the mixture to the skillet. Overall, it's an okay recipe, but I think I'll stick to the Campbells one.

This was absolutely amazing.  I admit that I am not a huge stroganoff fan, but my husband loves the stuff.  So, I figured for a treat I would make it for him...now I loved this dish.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, only thing done differently was to add a bit of garlic to the meat while browning.  It gave wonderful flavor.  Cooked wonderfuly...a must try.

BRILLIANT! Didn't have green onions (sub: 1 normal onion), condensed broth (sub: normal broth), or canned mushrooms (sub: fresh mushrooms). Turned out spectacular! Was great with a side of mashed potatoes. 

EDIT: Found all the correct ingredients, and it was still perfect. Though I kept the fresh muchrooms insread of canned.

I hate it when people do this...but I changed this recipe quite a bit.  Browned beef and onions with the addition of 2 cloves of minced garlic.  Why in the world would anyone who enjoys food use canned mushrooms??  I added an 8 ou. package of sliced baby bellas sauteed in 1 tbls of butter and added at the end.  Do yourself a favor and mix the flour in with the broth and "wisk" with a fork otherwise there are giant flour clumps in your future.  Added a tsp of worcesteshire  sauce to the browning beef.  Increased the sour cream to 1/2 cup light sour cream.  I used a tender piece of meat however, if you're using a tougher piece you may want to include the wine earlier as this not only enhances flavor...the acid helps to break down tough meat cuts and makes them tender.  I chose dijon mustard as my prepared mustard because of it's wine content.  Also I used a TBL of butter to saute the meat and one to saute the mushrooms.  4 ounces would be waaayyy to much!  This is a solid three star recipe made as is...its a five star with the changes I have made.

Great recipe, used a few tips and tricks from other reviewers (thank you JJH), as well as a few of my own. Here's what I did:

- Used a large yellow onion, I feel you get more/better flavor from it as opposed to a green onion.
- I also used a healthy amount of garlic (2 cloves if you're trying to be conservative, more if you're like me). Add it after your onions are nice and soft; garlic burns quickly!
- I hate canned mushrooms; way too slimy! I bought some regular ol' button mushrooms, sliced 'em, and added them to the pan with the onions. This method worked well!
- Marinating the beef in the red wine is also key (for no more than a couple of hours)! You get some amazing flavor from it! Don't forget to omit the white wine at the end.
- Instead of adding the flour in separately, do yourself a favor...before you brown your beef, dredge it with some flour. Just enough to give each piece a light coating. You're going to get better flavor and its a sure fire way to ensure your sauce doesn't end up lumpy. Also, you're going to end up with some bonus pan drippings, that you'll deglaze with the beef broth!
- I strongly suggest, please for the love of god, use a couple splashes of worcestershire when you add the mustard. I promise you won't regret the amount of rich flavor you're adding!
- I used half sour cream and half cream cheese at the end. The cream cheese brings the really nice creamy velvety texture, and the sour cream brings flavor to the party!

Hope this is helpful!

I just love it when we find the recipe we've been searching for!  After a few Stroganoff mishaps during my search, my husband was not looking forward to dinner tonight.  Three helpings later; we've found our family Stroganoff!  This is EXACTLY like my grandmother's!  I can NOT believe how tender the chuck roast came out.  We're flavor-hounds; so I added some crushed dried herbs (oregano, tarragon, chives)to the meat, sauteed fresh sliced button mushrooms with the onions (I also used some green of the onions), and added a touch more wine and used 5 ounces of sour cream.  Over buttered egg noodles sprinkled with chopped fresh parsley? Heaven.  Thanks so much for a GREAT recipe.

Delicious dinner. And you don't have to use chuck roast either. I think I used sirloin strips last time and it was really good. I also omit the wine, and it still tastes fine! Great recipe!

Added Parsley and Sour Cream Just Before Serving. Use 96/4 Ground Beef. Modified it for Crock Pot by adding all ingredients other than parsley and Sour Cream at the beginning (white wine was added at the beginning to the crock pot with other ingredients.) Cook on low 4-5 hours.

Crockpot version: chop 1 medium onion and 2 cloves of garlic. Place in crockpot with browned beef and add beef broth, mustard and 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce. Cook on low 6-8 hrs. I added cornstarch (dissolved in cool water) about an hour before done to thicken. Add 1/3 c each sour cream and cream cheese about 1/2 hour before done. Salt & pepper for taste. Amazing!!

Loved this! I hated, hated, hated Stroganoff growing up!(sorry mom, who is a great cook by the way) I made this for my husband who likes Stroganoff & what a surprise! This was really good! The only thing I changed was that I used fresh mushrooms, which I added about 45 minutes into cooking.(meant to add garlic but forgot)The meat was so tender & cooked perfectly. The wine really adds to this recipe. Might make alittle extra gravy next time, since it's so good on the rice and/or noodles. Great recipe, Thanks!

OMGosh! This is wonderful! I use chuck roast for a lot of things (including stir fry's, fajiata's, and ect), it's a wonderful cut of meat and I learned it's very economical while raising my 3 kids that were in sports and ate like 6 kids instead of 3
That's why I chose this recipe to try. It was great the first time.. I wouldn't complain a bit. The 2nd time I made it I used beef consumme' instead of broth. 1 small vidalia onion and half the green onions... and I doubled the mushrooms, because I love them! This recipe is terrific all by itself... but it's also a great adaptable recipe for your own taste. Add parsley, rosemary, thyme? It's up to you.. it's a terrific recipe! I serve it over homemade or kluski noodles. And I love extra black pepper so it's always on the table. 
Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Great as is, BUT it can be made even more delicious w/ a few changes. Double the broth, I use 2 cans and it makes it so much better. I then also double the sour cream. The roast is fine, but to cut down on prep time I use stew beef and it is perfectly tender after the 1 hr. simmer time. Lastly I use 2 tsp spicy brown mustard instead of one tsp. yellow. Word to the wise... temper the sour cream by whisking in about 1/4 c. of the simmering sauce before adding it to the pan. It prevents those white lumps/bits. This is THE stroganoff recipe for me and I have been asked for it often! Yummy!!!

I used a large yellow onion instead of green onions (that's what I had on hand) and fresh baby bella mushrooms instead of canned. I didn't add the extra salt and I threw in a teaspoon each of dried basil and dried oregano. I didn't realize until after I'd cleaned up after dinner that I'd spaced the mustard--we didn't miss it. I served this over buttered thick egg noodles. Out of the whole pan full, a small bowl remains. We loved it. NOTE: The beef broth I used was a full can of Campbell's condensed beef broth.

This recipe is very, very good! I followed by advises of previous postings: instead of green, I put one yellow onion; not 1/3 cup of sour cream, but 1/2 and 1 oz of cream cheese to it; 1 tbsp of Worchestershire sauce. Very tasty! Very reach!
     Couple years ago I tried beef stroganoff with a little of mustard seeds. I liked combination of reach, creamy sauce and crunchiness of “little suckers”:-). Next time I definitely put mustard seeds maybe 10 min before cooked time.
    I try to watch my weight, so I put reduced fat both sour cream and cream cheese. It came out great! You would never tell!

It would be a 5 but b/c I also marinated the beef strips in white wine, I had to give it a 4.  WONDERFUL & BEST stroganoff recipe I've ever made.  For 46 years I've made Betty Crocker's Simple Beef Stroganoff for Two & now I'm switching to Donna's Beef Stroganoff III recipe.  Thank you!!!

This is our favorite recipe for beef stroganoff.  What I did: To reduce cooking time and make it a nicer meal use cubed Rib Eye beef steak and maranateed the steak for 2 hours in a mixture of 1/2-1 cup of beef broth, 1/4-1/2 cup of Red Wine, and a teaspoon of mustard. Then I sauteed the beef in butter but only used 1/2 stick of butter and 2 cloves of garlic, and a tiny bit of Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Once the meat was almost brown I put a 1/2 cup of red wine into the pan and increased the heat to med. high. I waited about 2 minutes for the alcohol to burn off (when it's smoking and smells less like alcohol and more like flavor) and added the onions and beef broth and 2 teaspoons of corn starch. It's easier to mix the corn starch and 1/4th cup of beef broth in a separate mixture. I also added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and omitted the mushrooms since we don't like the texture of mushrooms but enjoy the flavor. I added the rest of the beef broth, about 1 and 1/2 cup until it was the consistency I liked. I also spiced to my liking (thyme, sage, pepper, salt, cumin, a shake of nutmeg) and the teaspoon of mustard. I needed to add a tiny bit of milk because it was still a bit goopy and thick and I didn't want it to burn on the bottom of the pan. Then I covered it and simmered for about 20 minutes while I boiled the water and prepared the egg noodles. I checked the pan every 7 minutes or so to ensure that it was simmering on low and that it wasn't sticking/burning to the bottom.

Thanks for sharing this, Donna! I just made it for the first time, and it will be replacing my previous favorite stroganoff recipe of many years. I used the popular suggestions of adding a couple splashes of worcestshire, as well as 1 tbsp. of minced garlic (from a jar - milder than fresh).  I did encounter a small problem.  The sauce was extremely thick and there wasn't much of it, and it constantly threatened to burn on the bottom during the hour-long simmer. This was avoided by stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot every 5-10 minutes, and adding a little water each time to replace what was lost by lifting the lid.  After that, I added the wine (a white zinfandel) and 12 oz. of fresh sliced mushrooms (I love mushrooms, and the canned type are *not* allowed in my kitchen! :) I continued simmering until the mushrooms were tender, and the juices they produced helped to extend and thin the sauce, which was much needed in my opinion.  I then removed from heat and stirred in the sour cream.  Simply incredible, packed with flavor, and the beef was so tender!  Though next time, I will try adding extra liquid at the beginning in an attempt to make it better behaved - I felt like I was flirting with disaster making this; had I not been attentive, it could have easily burned beyond rescue.  A bit more sour cream would also be welcomed by my palette, although another popular suggestion to add 1/3 cup softened cream cheese sounds quite delicious also.

A great stroganoff recipe with a little zip.  I didn't think it was a lot of work at all.  Once the meat is cut and trimmed of fat, it's smooth sailling.  I used yellow onions instead of green and fresh mushrooms in place of canned.  I'll add garlic next time around.  The flavor was phenomenal and the meat was tender.  My family gobbled up every morsel.  I'll make this again.

I made this tonight even though my husband said he did not like stroganoff.  He ate every bite and went back for more!  I did add garlic and I cooked it in the pressure cooker to cut the cooking time down and allow me to use a cheap cut of meat.  I will make more sauce next time to make it go a little farther.  Will make again and again!

This is by far the best beef stroganoff recipe I have ever tried. I used fresh mushrooms, which I thickly sliced, instead of canned. Canned mushrooms, in my opinion, are nasty. I sauteed them with the onions. 1.5 pounds of sirloin (there's only 2 of us). Don't forget to cut it across the grain or it'll be tough. I marinated it with 1/3 cup of Merlot (no cooking wine please!), a clove of minced garlic and about 2 tbs. of  Worcestershire sauce for an hour. Added just a little more splash of Merlot then simmered for an hour (wine has to be cooked down). The meat was so tender and sauce was phenomenal. Served it over buttered egg noodles. Definitely a keeper!

The best stroganoff I have ever had.  I couldn't believe I made beef so delicious.  I will make this again and again. Perfect as is, but I can see it being easily adaptable as well.

This was fast and easy to make. I used a sirloin steak cut up into strips. I also used fresh mushrooms rather than canned. Since the meat was fairly tender to begin with, I skipped the 'simmer for one hour' step. My dish was ready in about 30 minutes. I served it over hot egg noodles.

I refuse to use a can of cream of mushroom in this dish and usually cook on the fly. What's most important when executing this recipe is 1.how you slice the meat to get it tender.2. stir/mix gently, not quickly 3. ensure there's lots of sauce and leftovers b/c it always taste better the next day.  Here's my modified recipe. 1.cut 2 lbs sirloin into strips 1/2 x 2"; Cut against the grain. Marinate meat in 1 cup red wine for 1 hour. 2.Place marinated meat in large bowl. Season meat with 1/2 t salt and pepper. On a side plate, add 8T flour. Add beef to plate, cover beef lightly with flour. 3.Heat large pot over med/high heat. Melt 2T margarine in pot.  Add 1/2 diced onion to pot, cook until onions translucent, 3-5 minutes. Place on side in large bowl. 4.Melt 2T margarine in pot; Add sliced mushrooms and sautee. If using fresh garlic, add garlic. Cook for appx 5 minutes. Place mushrooms on side in large bowl with onions. 5.Melt 2T butter in pot and brown the beef strips.  Just brown outside of beef, then place on side in large bowl with mushrooms and onions. 6. Melt 2T of margarine in pot. Pour about 1 cup of red wine in pan over med-high heat, for appx 3 minutes.  Add in 2 cans beef broth, stir and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and stir in 6T worcestershire sauce.  Add beef, onion, mushrooms. If not using fresh garlic, add in garlic powder.  Cover and simmer for 15 minutes. 7. Add 1/4c sour cream, mix thoroughly. Adjust according to preference. Serve over cooked egg noodles.

I guess my wife and I are food snobs because this stroganoff tastes like it came out of the Campbell's soup recipe book!  For all the work it takes to make this dish, we were expecting something much richer, much more elegant, and something with a "wow" factor.  We will not be making this one again.

I made this in the spur of the moment so I improvised some.  I used ground beef, browned and drained it first, then added the butter and continued on.  I also had to change up the green onions for one whole large onion, finely chopped in a food processor.  Since I used the ground beef, I didn't have to wait an hour for it simmer.  I added all the ingredients in order as specified.  Once the mushrooms were ready, it was ready to eat.  Very tasty.

Wow! Thank you for this recipe! It was fantastic and easy. I made a few changes: The night before I had made a beef roast for dinner and cooked it to rare, so I used the left over from that as the beef. I was a bit nervous that the beef would be too tough so I only simmered it for about a half-hour and you could still cut it with a fork. Also, I didn't have canned mushrooms on hand so I used fresh mushrooms and sliced them and threw them in with the green onion. FANTASTIC! Anyone who loves beef stroganoff should definately try this recipe :)

My friend was asking for Beef Stroganoff. We tried this recipe tonight. I followed the recipe almost to the "T".Only difference was I used top sirloin,and added fresh mushrooms when beef was almost done. Absolutly Wonderful!!Even our guest(who does not like mushrooms)loved this meal. This is definitly a keeper in my recipe box.

This is a really good stroganoff.  My usual stroganoff is "Daria's Slow Cooker Beef Stroganoff" found on this site and it's just as delicious.  I didn't have a roast, so I used beef stew meat and browned it in a little butter and oil.  I didn't use the green onions or flour.  Instead, I chopped up a regular onion and like another reviewer, dumped it in a slow cooker along with the beef broth and a can of mushroom soup (since I didn't have the fresh mushrooms).  I added some garlic powder and used red wine instead of white.  After about 6 hours I couldn't stir this stuff without my meat falling apart...it was that tender!!  Soooo good.  Thanks Donna.

I made this recipe last night. I read all the reviews and thanks for the many great tips. I marinated the meat for 2 hours in red wine as recommended. I substituted a small whole sweet chopped onion for the green onions and used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. I also added 1 T Worcestershire sauce and 1 T garlic as others recommended. I accidentally added 1T of Emeril's dijon mustard instead of 1 tsp (misread the review) and it still turned out great. The smell was divine. The taste even better. 

Next time I think I want to try and make this in the crockpot. I did use sirloin tip roast instead of chuck and it was a little tough. Maybe I got the meat pieces cut too big? but the flavor of the sauce was so good that I'm going to try a crockpot version next time. 

For those of you who aren't big wine cooking fans you can't taste the red wine when you are eating so don't hesitate to marinate in the wine. I did not add extra white wine at the end as someone else reviewed it and said it diluted the sauce too much. Great tip for the non-wine cooking fans! This is definitely a keeper and will be trying this recipe again. Oh and with all the prep time involved this is better saved to make on the weekend.

Really good. I recommend adding fresh mushrooms at the start, omit the white wine, add 1/3rd cup cream cheese. Double the sauce if you plan on having leftovers. Mix in the egg noodles before putting the in the fridge. Great midnight snack, lunch or dinner the next day.

I was not thrilled with this recipe.  For some reason, this had little flavor.  I am not exactly what I would blame it on other than there just was not the right combination of flavors here.

I thought this tasted more like a beef stew. I had left overs that I added carrots & peas to. Not a bad recipe, just not a real stroganoff (in my opinion)

Loving it...  I changed it a bit to save a trip to the store, but so good just the same.  I used serloin steak cut in strips, regular yellow onions, fresh mushrooms (about 2 cps) only 2 tbsp butter and 2 tbsp flour,  low fat sour cream and merlot wine.  All over egg noodles.  sooo good:)

This was a wonderful dish-- I love beef stroganoff!  I substituted a package of frozen pearl onions for the green onions.  I also added a few cloves of garlic which I sauteed with a pound of fresh mushrooms and butter.  Finally, I added a tablespoon of tomato paste to the sauce.  My husband loved it, and he's not particularly easy to please in the meal department!  Thanks, Donna.

Pros: excellent flavor, the sour cream doesn't overpower, and the consistency is perfect. Cons: dumping flour straight into the pan clots the flour, calls for waaaaaay too much butter, cooking it one pan is an unnecessary disaster. Recommended Recipe Alterations: 1. Cut the butter by half to 1/4c 2. Put the flour in a separate bowl and added some of the pan drippings. Mix the two together in the extra bowl until a paste develops and then add back into the sauce. 3. Remove meat before adding the flour paste to make the sauce and avoid sloshing it all over the stovetop. Add meat back in after flour is fully incorporated. 4. Substitute white onion for green onion. Half a small onion is plenty. 5. I would never, ever use canned mushrooms. I used two packages of fresh sliced mushrooms and sautéed them with the onion in a SEPARATE pan and added them both to the sauce after the flour is incorporated.

This is, as others have said, a great base recipe. I made the following changes and this has become my go-to perfect beef stroganoff recipe!

a) Don't use canned mushrooms. Get fresh, slice, saute in butter/wine instead.

b) Use a nice dry pinot grigio for your wine

c) Use Coleman's English Mustard (already prepared). This makes for a very elegant sauce (if a hint spicy)

d) Remove beef strips before sauteing green onions. First thicken sauce up with the flour, stock, and mustard the add your beef strips back in for the 1 hour braise.

e) Adjust seasoning (salt, pepper, add'l mustard)

It was very delicious and rich.  I used ground beef instead of the steak.  I also used others suggestions and added 1/3 cup cream cheese and some Worcestershire sauce.

Super duper!  Added a pound more meat ... marinated the sliced roast in red wine (about a cup) for an hour.  Used dijon mustard instead of yellow and made it a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon.  Lastly added a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce and 1/3 cup cream cheese towards the end.

Really pretty amazing!  I grew up on "hamburger stroganoff" and always loved it.  Have not even thought about it until recently.  I was tempted to add some "stuff" cause it sounded kind of bland... NOT!  No need at all - followed it to a "T" and it was YUM, YUM, YUMMY!   Thanks for a real keeper!

An excellent stroganoff recipe with good flavor and consistency! We are Southerners so we like it over rice instead of noodles :-)  The only things I change are adding a dash of Worchestershire and omitting the mushrooms b/c my family does not like them. You can use any type of beef you have on hand for this recipe - I've used beef tips and even stew beef in a pinch, both with excellent results.

Excellent!  Wait until you try the left-overs.  I used fresh mushrooms cooked in butter for a substitute and added a little more milk.  I also added a pinch of fresh rosemary.  Make sure you give it that 1 hour to soften the meat.

Update - I've made this now many times, and it's always a hit.  Recently, a friend who hunts gave us a bunch of Venison. Tonight I tried this recipe using sliced Venison Sirloin Steak.  I was out of white wine (horrors!), so I substituted a nice red Shiraz.  It was awesome!  So tender!  Everyone raved! 

We loved this!  I used stewing beef & sliced sweet onions because that's what I had on hand.  I was out of fresh or canned mushrooms so I didn't use them, but can't wait to make it again WITH them.  I used low fat sour cream to lighten it up, and you'd never know the difference.  As other reviewers suggested, I added a little (low fat neufchatel) cream cheese too, for richer texture.  I LOVE Worcestershire, so a generous dash of that went in. Served over egg noodles w/ sauteed garlic green beans.  Outstanding...very tender beef, and sauce with body and depth.  Excellent.

This recipe is AMAZING! I've made it before, but this time I tenderized and then marinaded the meat to make it softer, used the 1 tbsp of garlic when browning the meat, substituted yellow instead of green onions,  added the cream cheese and Worcestershire sauce as suggested, all of which I now STRONGLY recommend!  Thought it came out a lil too thick when I did the 2 tbsp cornstarch 2 tbsp flour, but it was a good thing because it got thinner later.  I use white zinfandel every time I make this recipe, which works out perfectly, although I use more than recommended for the marinade and then ended up adding about 1/4 cup (or so) halfway through the simmer, along with the mushrooms.  I also used bouillon instead of broth this time but it was a good thing because it came out less salty.  A FABULOUS recipe, your family will LOVE IT!

YUM! YUM! I made a few changes according to what I had on hand and as suggested by other reviewers. I used 3 lbs of round steak cut into strips,rather than the chuck roast,1 diced yellow onion rather than the green onions, Added 2 cloves minced garlic and 1 lb fresh mushrooms (I hate canned mushrooms!)which I added and cooked along with the onions. I also doubled the  sour cream (I love the stuff!) and added a few dashes of worchestichire sauce. I thickened it a little more with flour and water before adding the wine and sour cream so it would not be runny once they were added. We loved this dish! Definately a keeper!

This was excellent! Thank you for this recipe! I marinated the sirloin strips in white wine, worchestershire and garlic for an hour first. And once put all together, let it simmer for an hour and 15minutes. I've never had beef so tender! 
I also removed the beef, then cooked the onion and mushrooms and garlic before adding the beef broth. Then added the beef strips back in before simmering. Turned out excellent!
I'm saving this one!! 
Thanks again!

Deeeeelish!  Been making this for a while with some other mentioned modifications.  I marinate the steak in red wine for an hour or so and leave out the wine at the end.  I, too, use yellow onion instead of green, but I use fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Also add a bit of worcestershire.  Very modifiable to your tastes.  Such great flavor and if you simmer for a while, you can really use any inexpensive cut of meat and end up with tender results.

This is a great recipe.  It was pretty easy to make (the hardest part was cutting up the chuck roast), delicious, and my wife loved it.  The only changes I made were to use a 14.5 oz can of beef broth (instead of a 10.5 oz can), and to use 8 oz of fresh sliced mushrooms, sauteed in butter, in lieu of canned sliced mushrooms.  Definitely a keeper!

I made a much lower fat version, and it was still really good. Notes for people trying to cut calories:

1. I halved the butter (used 2oz)
2. Would slice the beef to 1/2 the width next time so we have "more" beef tips while not eating as much
3. Used non-fat sour cream

I also added the flour into the beef broth (and stir well) instead of directly into the sauce. This avoids clumping.

Very tasty! HOWEVER.....you can make the exact same think with about 1/10th the effort by putting a roast in the crackpot with a large can of cream of mushroom soup and a packet of dry onion soup mix. Cook on low 8 hours or so, add in a can of mushroom and some sour cream. I promise you that the flavor is exactly the same.

Oh my god was this ever good! I took the advice of other reviewers and I made a few changes. I cut up the beef as directed and then marinated it in about a cup of cabernet. When I browned the beef, I reserved the wine marinade and stirred the flour (I used a bit more than 4 T.) into the wine. I removed the beef to sautee a whole chopped yellow onion (in place of green onions) and added a container of fresh sliced mushrooms with the onions. I then returned the beef to the pan, added the wine/flour mixture and the beef broth. This alone was delicious!! I let it simmer for 1-2 hours and then added the 1/3 c. cream cheese and 1/3 c. sour cream. Served over whole wheat egg noodles- this was fantastic! And I can't stand mushrooms- I didn't even notice they were there. My boyfriend loved it. I loved it. This is a fantastic recipe with the adjustments!

Excellent recipe!  I used a splash of apple juice rather than the wine, and olive oil to replace the butter.  To make things easier, I simply bought the "stir fry" sliced beef from the butcher.  Delicious!

Oh wow, this turned out fantastic!  I followed fellow reviewer, BEEZLYS, suggestions:  marinating the meat in red wine, adding garlic and Worcestershire sauce, etc. I then served over egg noodles with fresh green beans on the side.  My sister said it was the best meal I ever made!

This is tasty & soooo easy!  Great comfort food.  
I used white onions instead of green onions, and fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  Used Chablis (all I had on hand), and low fat s. cream.  Also added worschire & garlic (as others had suggested).  Served over noodles.  Really great!  I would suggest tenderizing the meat, or simmering longer so it is tender.  I may try this with ground beef next time.  Regardless~ this is a super-easy, fool-proof way to make a great comfort meal!  Thanks for sharing!

Wow, I would give this 10 stars if I could! Absolutely delicious. I omitted the onions, added 2 cloves of garlic. I also sauteed a pound of sliced, fresh mushrooms in a little butter and added those about 10 minutes before serving. I didn't have any white wine, so I just used 14 oz of beef broth instead of the 10.5 called for. Served over no-yolk egg noodles. This is probably the best beef stroganoff I've ever had, thank you!

I accidentally bought pork instead of beef....but I have to say it was wonderul. Next time I will try beef since it is beef stroganoff. Great recipe, thanks! Update, how amazing it is with beef...hahaha. Nice to know you can use whatever meat you have on hand though. :) I would recommend using the wine with the sour cream instead of cream cheese & just sour cream(it needs the wine) for sure!!!

Delicious!!! Followed all of Beezlys suggestions (sort reviews by "most helpful") and substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream, per Natalie's suggestion. Had to substitue veggie bullion for beef broth and used white grape juice instead of wine. The flavor was amazing and, as others suggested, I will probably use the sauce as a gravy in the future. Served over linguini, which was a little too heavy. Will definitely try egg noodles next time. Cut the recipe in half, but only got three servings out of it instead of the four I was expecting, so no leftovers for hubby & me :(

Very good. I had leftover meat from a roast and used that.  It saved some time and worked fine.
I used egg noodles.  
I always use unflavored yogurt instead of sour cream.  It cuts a few calories and tastes the same to me.

My grandson loves to cook and this was his first year in "Foods" for 4-H.  He decided to make this for the "Foods Review". As a kid that likes to challenge himself, he decided to try this with rabbit (as his great uncle raises meat rabbits).  The only thing we "changed" was using 1/2 can of beef broth and 1/2 can of chicken broth.  (I find beef broth can be too salty and a bit "heavy" for such a mild flavored meat as rabbit. Also since they raise their own shiitake mushrooms, he used those and sauteed them in butter first and added them at the end. The rabbit Stroganoff was OUTSTANDING! Our 4-H here prints out the recipes that the kids submit and everyone that was there and(that got to taste it)gave it rave reviews!!  Even the judge was really impressed and thrilled to get the recipe! Served over his own HOME MADE egg noodles this recipe turned out wonderful (as his "Super Star" rating at food reviews attests).  I told him anyone can use soup to make their sauce for stoganoff so learning how to make your sauce from a roux and making a "scratch" recipe is a way to learn good cooking habits.  Everyone came up to him afterwards and were asking him about the recipe (and we can't wait to make this with venison, wild turkey, even turtle!  This recipe is definitely a "keeper"!! I "supervised" but let him do ALL the preparation and cooking and was there to answer questions.  I don't believe in "doing it for them", it's the kid's project and pass or fail, the kid does it!

A good 4 as is. The second time I made it I altered it a bit for our tastes and brought it to what my family judges a 5. Loose the canned broth and use 15 ounces of homemade stock. Use porchini or morels for more of a mushroom flavor or save some cash and stick to the regular but add a ts of wild mushroom powder. Use red wine instead of white and brown a few shallots with the meat.

This recipe was very good.  I altered by doubling the wine, beef broth and mushrooms.  This was easy to make, but not the easiest recipe for beef stroganoff I have made, but is definitely the best tasting.  Will serve this one again.

Made this last night for the family. This is what I did..used sirloin, sliced thin, a white onion and baby bellas. Grilled them in my cast iron skillet, each individually, in butter, then made the sauce from all the goodies in the skillet, also did some garlic with the onions. Then mixed in the meat, onions and mushrooms with the sauce. Right before serving (over Amish noodles) stirred in the cream cheese and sour cream. Salt and pepper to taste. I didn't have any wine so that didn't go in, that is why it was kind of bland. Shouldn't have been bland but it kind of was. Boo hoo!! The family thought it was wonderful. My son brought a friend home and they had some and his friend loved it.  I will make it again, perhaps using some red wine to marinate the beef for a few hours then proceed. I really thought it would have more punch to it. It is good so please DON'T let me discourage any one from making it. I will make it another time, I promise!

This was delicious! I did change it up and followed a few of the recommendations of BEEZLYS, I used yellow onions, cornstarch instead of flour, and added Worcestershire sauce. Also I used fresh mushrooms since I had some that needed to be used. Thanks for the recipe.

In the past I always used cream of "chemical" soup to make beef stroganoof.  After searching and searching for a more natural recipe I found this one.  My husband and picky daughter both enjoyed this recipe.  It's not super flavorful, and I had to add more sauce ingredients for our taste.  But having said that, it was good enough that I'll definitely make it again.

I used Ground beef and 1 medium onion instead of the green onions. I also added 3/4 tsp of nutmeg which is a "secret" ingredient that I add to all stroganoff recipes.

The sauce didn't reduce down much at the end, and the canned mushrooms tasted too canned. I would definitely make it with more sour cream and real mushrooms next time.

This is a great recipe, and I still think chuck roast is the best. The trick to thickening this even more is to add tomato paste. It gives it a much rounder flavor and tangs it up a bit.

I like the flavor of this, though I did add a bit more mustard and used fresh mushrooms instead.  I was a little disappointed with the sauce, it was very very thin.  I think this is worth trying again, and maybe using the suggestion that others have made about using cream cheese.

This recipe was great; I used blade steaks and added a little extra wine and mustard.  I accidentally added low-fat sour cream and it curdled immediately.  Regular sour cream saved the dish, and  I won't make that mistake again.  Served over buttered egg noodles.  Even better as leftovers.

Outstanding!!!!! I can't believe how good that this is! I used 2 lbs. of beef stew meat. I used more flour, salt and pepper to coat than the recipe called for. I browned the meat and then plated it and then used 1 yellow onion, sliced and quartered instead of the green onion and added minced garlic. I really wish that I had sauteed the onion with the meat. I then added the beef broth, mustard, worcestershire sauce (a couple of good shakes). Simmered this. Meanwhile I boiled egg noodles in water, salt and a bouillion cube. Then I added white wine and finally sour cream. This was out of this world! You must have bread to sop the gravy up! Mmmmmm!!!! Thank you!

NO: canned mushroom, canned beef stock, cooking directions.  YES: all fresh (make beef liquid using the beef) plus garlic, Worcester, yellow onion, ( chopped parsley at the end.)  Beef, onion and mushroom deserve to be perfectly sautéed then the sauce created to taste/consistency before adding them together to simmer.

My whole family loved it!! Even my daughter's friend who is a bit picky loved it and ate it all!  It is simple and delicious!!  I did add the cream cheese like suggested.  I also marinated my beef in wine salt and pepper before I made it and used regular onion instead of green onion.  I will make it again for sure!!!

This is good. I did the process a bit differently, but the same recipe. I first browned the meat, then transferred it to a slow cooker. Same thing with the rest of the process - skillet first, then to the slow cooker. That allowed me to slow cook the meat for several hours to get it nice and tender.

This was great. Based on the recommendations of others, I marinated the meat in red wine, used a yellow onion, added some garlic while it simmered, did not add extra wine, and added 3 ounces of cream cheese at the same time as the sour cream. The flavors were great and the meat was really tender!

Before I made this dish for the first time I was worried that it wouldn't be as good as my mom's. Now that I've tried it, I'm worried that my mom's version might not be as good as this.

I had some leftover steaks that were pretty tough, so I popped them into the pressure cooker with 1/2 a small diced red onion I had in the fridge, 3 cloves of minced garlic, and 1/2 cup of homemade vegetable stock for about 7 minutes.

 While it was cooking, I mixed 1/3c light sour cream, 1/3 c cream cheese, 1/3 c of champagne I had open in lieu of wine, 1 tbsp. of paprika and 1 tbsp. of ground mustard together in a separate bowl. 

I also added my 4tsp of flour to 2c of beef broth in a separate bowl.

When the beef was finished cooking, I added a package of fresh diced mushrooms and 4 tsp of flour/beef broth mix to the pot and stirred. 

I then "tempered" the cream/wine mixture by adding a little of the hot liquid from the pot to the bowl of cream/wine mix and stirring, add then stir, add then stir. Do this until you've added about a cup of the hot liquid with the bowl of cream. This way the cream doesn't curdle when you put it into the pot of hot liquid (to me this is VERY important). 

I simmered the liquid uncovered for about 20 minutes while I made some flat egg noodles to serve it over. This was quick, easy, and delicious. Next time I'll add some diced tomatoes from the garden for color.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE...with a couple changes. I used a package of beef stew meat instead of having to go through and cut all the meat, etc. I substituted the green onions for one medium yellow onion (Vidalia in the Summer). I used fresh mushrooms (8oz. container). Lastly, I used RED wine (Pinot Noir) instead of white. FABULOUS!!! I even use fat free sour cream! No one can tell because the flavor is all there already! YUMMMM!

Just tried this recipe tonight; it was great. The beef was very tender and the sauce had amazing flavor. I doubled the recipe, added 2 ounces of vegetable oil to the butter, used 1/2 finely chopped yellow onion instead of green onions, used two packages of fresh mushrooms (sliced them and added them right after onions), added a cup of water and two Knorr Beef Boullion cubes, which meant I eliminated the beef broth. I also used a couple tablespoons of corn starch to thicken instead of flour. I would definitely make this again.

I had leftover steak from the night before that I used. I cut it up into bite size pieces and followed the recipe as written. I didn't have white wine, so I used red. This recipe was fantastic! I will make this again with leftovers or not :)

This was a home run!  Made two changes.  I used fresh mushrooms and stew meat.   Next time, I will up the sour cream by a couple of tbsps and slow cook it for 2 hours to make the meat more tender.

I gave this two stars because I thought it was rather bland. BUT, I did make some substitutions, though I didn't anticipate though I didn't really feel like they were enough to truly impact the overall flavor. (I substituted elk steak for the beef, fresh mushrooms for canned and red wine for white and Greek yogurt for the sour cream. I also left out the green onions as I didn't have any.) Once we added some Worcestershire sauce and salt at tableside, it was better. But it needed a LOT of salt.

Yummy comfort food.  My husband raved over this!  I prepared this with one pound ground beef, since that is what I had on hand, but used the sauce quantities as published, since we like lots of sauce over our noodles.  I just browned the beef with onions until almost browned through, just some pink, then added the sauce ingredients as published with out the one hour cooking time.  I also added a splash of worchestershire sauce, too.  Served over buttered & parsley kluski noodles.  Liked that this did not have an overpowering sour cream taste, just enough.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Donna, it's a keeper!

This is the best stroganoff recipe I have ever made.  I followed other reviewers' advice and marinated the meat in red wine 2 hours before cooking.  I browned the meat in a butter/olive oil mixture and removed the meat from the pan.  I cooked the onions with some fresh garlic, then added the flour to coat the mixture.  I blended in beef broth and the sauce was very thick.  I added a touch extra of beef broth instead of wine.  I added the meat back  in and simmered for a little bit.  I used sirloin steak this time.  Next time, I will simmer for awhile longer to make the meat more tender.

This is a keeper- it was so delightfully tasty.  I used some tenderloin tips that I had in the freezer, but will try a cheaper cut next time to see if it's as good.  I RARELY follow a recipe in its' entirty, but this one I did (with the exception of not having quite 2# of meat)
I would, however, take note of the serving am't - I think more like 4 than 8!
Thanks for the grand recipe - I will be making it again - maybe for company - it is that good !

followed recipe exactly (except cooking directions, went ahead and cooked beef and onions together) and it turned out perfect. still tastes like your run of the mill stroganoff minus the soupy taste you get from using canned soups.

Thought this was extremely tasty.  We used stew meat which we browned and then pressure cooked for 20 minutes.  Next time we will cut down on the butter drastically to reduce calories.

My budget doesn't allow for expensive cuts of meat, so I use a skirt steak (buy one get one free twice a month at local supermarket $.60/lb).  To make the meat more tender, I marinated it in wine and garlic for 2 hours before cooking (wine was omitted later).  I reduced the butter by 1/2 (still seemed like a lot), substituted 1/2 white onion for green onions, and used 2 beef bullion cubes dissolved into 10 ounces of water instead of broth.  The recipe worked well and fit my budget a lot better than it did as written.

YumYum! I used beef stew meat which I let simmer for 90 minutes but this was really tasty! I added the white wine while it was simmering and will try a red wine next time.

Great Recipe, thanks for sharing. I did use 1/3 c sour cream and 1/3 c cream cheese at end. Didn't use wine as I didn't have any open. But, really good without it. A Keeper!!

I used cabernet sauvignon and it turned out quite delicious!  I recently started cooking with wine and it makes the dish far richer and flavorful.  Even my kids liked it.

I have made this several times and it is one of my favorite go-to meals, both because it is delicious and my boyfriend loves it! The reason for the 4 star is I made several changes: For one, I have 5 roommates so I double the ingredients. Also, I use 3 lbs of hamburger that I brown (then drain) in a separate pan. I also cook 1 bag of egg noodles. (I keep the noodles and the meat to the side until it's nearly the end). I don't use green onion, but I do dice 1/2 small onion and 4 cloves of garlic (or 1 onion and 4 cloves if doubled)  that I cook with the butter until it's tranlucent. I use 2 tb of flour and 2 tb of corn starch (well, 4 and 4 since I double it...) After I make the paste with the butter, onion, flour and corn starch I add the beef broth and I use 1 tb of Worcestershire sauce. (2 if you're me). As for the other things: I don't use prepared mustard, white wine or mushrooms (one of my roommates doesn't like them otherwise I totally would.) I use 1/2 a block of cream cheese (well 1 full block since I double it), and I also use 1/4 cup soup cream (½ if doubled) added at the same time as the softened cream cheese. After the cream cheese and sour cream are melted I mix in the cooked egg noodles and browned hamburger. If it's too thick I add some milk, whatever I have on hand (skim or whole). Heat through and yummy!

I made a vegan version of this with a textured soy "beef skewer," soy sour cream and a veggie stock... totally delicious and super easy.  A good recipe, in my opinion, is one that can be suited to meet the needs of any diet, and this one definitely makes the cut!

Delicious!!  Rave reviews from all 12 hungry guests!  I marinated the stew meat in merlot overnight. THIS MAKES SUCH A DIFFERENCE IN FLAVOR AND TENDERIZING! Browned the meat as instructed and threw it in the crockpot for 7 hours on low.  Used fresh sauted mushrooms and added them about 40 minutes before serving.  For the creamy part, I added 1/2 cream cheese and 1/2 sour cream mixed with a bit of country dijon mustard.  Amazing and delicious!  Thank you so much for the recipe Donna, and thank you to the raters that read many,many reviews and came up with the inspiring tips!

Love this recipe! Did make some changes that made it easier for me.  I marinated the beef in red wine (about 2 cups of wine) as others have mentioned but I did this in the crock pot on high (mine has high 4hr and high 6 hr.  - did 6hr high temp) and cooked in the wine for about 3 hours or so. Also, backing up a bit, I used sirloin tips  -not a roast. Anyway, then in pan on stove cut butter in 1/2 so 1/2 stick, dehydrated onions and 1tbsp (heaping) of garlic  in butter for few minutes. Used 2Tbsp flour and 2Tbsp corn starch as others mentinoed as well and added to butter on stove. Then took wine/beef juices out of crock via turkey baster and measured out about 8oz of this (dumped rest) and added water to make the 10.5 ounces which is how much beef broth you're supposed to add.  I added some minors beef paste to this wine/juice mixture and added to butter/onion/garlic on stove. After boiling this for several minutes (it bubbled for a few minutes) I poured all of this into the crock pot. Now on low in crock a few minutes before you serve, add cream cheese and sour cream (1/3c each) and heat through.  AMAZING and most of the cooking is in crock pot. The marinating of the beef in wine (crock pot or not) does make it so very tender with rich flavor of the wine. So very good!

Excellent base recipe, with excellent flavor. I used thin-cut steak for this, and it ended up a bit more done than I would have liked, even though it still tasted delicious. I also used baby portabellas and morels instead of canned mushrooms (which, honestly, are pretty disgusting). I served it next to a mixed greens salad with berry tomatoes, golden raspberries (fantastic), and a great champagne vinaigrette. 

In the future, I think I would probably take the beef completely out of the pan after browning it for the juices, and then put it back after the sauce had simmered for ~20 minutes and let it all simmer together for another 10, since I prefer my steak to be pink in the middle. I'm also going to try adding some garlic, as I've heard that garlic makes a superb addition to stroganoff. Though, honestly, this recipe is simply delicious as-is.

This was great! My only changes:  yellow onion instead of green onions; fresh mushrooms instead of canned, marinated the beef in red wine and omitted from additional wine to recipe, and added 1/3 c of cream cheese.  Everyone loved it! Thanks, Donna!

This recipe is a 5er just the way it is.  If you are in a rush or you find out your beef has freezer burn as I did, and you have ground beef on hand, you can use that and it cooks up real quick ... no need for the hour long simmering.  Great recipe Donna!

This was delicious - used beef consomme only because it's what I had on hand.  Came out good.  Although in our house it only served 4!!!

Great base recipe but I adjusted it quite a bit with other raters suggestions.  Used half a sweet onion, one crushed garlic clove, added sherry cooking wine after browning these and the beef.  Used one can condensed beef stock (with one can water), added Worcestershire sauce, used fresh mushrooms and made it a one pot recipe by adding the egg noodles to the sauce and simmering until done.  Great flavor, quick and easy - I will definitely make again!

Good recipe.  I was looking for something to use my left over roast from the Italian pulled beef sandwiches and this fit the bill.  Used the egg noodles and followed the advice of yellow onion and cream cheese.  Didn't need the wine since the beef had already been slow cooked in Lipton onion soup mix and Italian seasonings.   This is a good way to get more than one meal out of a large roast (especially when they go on sale).

This is a very simple, yet very flavorful dish.  I used sirloin strips rather than chuck roast.  Sliced up sweet onions, fresh mushrooms and garlic.  After I browned the beef, I went ahead and added the broth, wine and flour to the pan.  Stirred it together, then added the mustard, basil, salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce.  I brought the mixture to a boil and then tossed in the onions, mushrooms and garlic.  I kept a close eye on the steak to keep it from over cooking.  I allowed it to simmer for about 20 mins and then I added about 3 tablespoons of sour cream.  Delicious!

A very simple, delicious stroganoff! Added onion and mushroom soup mix to simmering beef (chuck roast) and broth, plus 1/4 cup red wine. Found the sauce thickened more than I liked and I needed to add water (and more salt and pepper) toward the end of cooking. Otherwise, flavor was magnificent! Served mixed with egg noodles.

Super recipe!  I have been looking for a good stroganoff recipe and I have now found it!  The only changes I made was to use sherry instead of white wine (thats what I had on hand), and I did not have enough onions this time but used extra onion powder and it came out great.  Served it over the recipe i found on this site "Grandma's Butter Noodles" what a perfect dinner!

This was wonderful. I'd give 5 stars, but per JJH's review I marinated in red wine and added 1/3c cream cheese & 1/3c sour cream and no wine at the end. I'll be making this again!!!

Very good.  I marinated the beef in a 1/2 cup white wine for a couple of hours before hand.  I melted 2 ounces butter and then added the beef and wine.  I browned the beef and then plated it; cooked down the wine/butter to about 1/2.  While the wine sauce was cooking down, I whisked 4 tbls of flour into the beef broth. I added onions to the cooked down wine sauce until soft then I stirred in the broth/flour mixture and mustard as directed.  After the sauce had thickened, I added the beef back to the pan and the mushrooms and let simmer for at least 1 hour, stirring occasionally.  I think adding the mushrooms gives extra depth to the sauce.  When ready to serve, I added in the sour cream.  I added a spoonful at a time until I liked the flavor.    Definite keeper.

Wonderful recipe. I'll add my 2-cents worth of comments to the already 800+ and hope it might be helpful to someone. I followed the recipe with the exception of 2 things: (1) I had no wine on hand so trusted others that it would still come out great, and it did, and (2) I used fresh mushrooms as recommended by others.  I was amazed that chuck roast could be used like this. It reminded me of round steak. Because I had trimmed so much fat from the meat, when I fried it I didn't have much in the way of juices to which to add 4 TBL of flour to make a roux. I ended up using additional beef broth (not much, maybe 1/4 cup) in order to make a gravy. As the meat simmered in the gravy for the next 2 hours (that's how long it took for the meat to become tender), I had to add a bit more broth to the pan to keep it from drying out. This did not in any way make the gravy runny, however, and by the end, when I added the sour cream, everything came out just perfect. We loved it. I believe a very similar result could be achieved using left over chuck roast and gravy (cooked the old-fashion way for one meal) by adding mustard, onions, mushrooms, wine, and sour cream to the leftover meat and gravy. This could even be a freezer dish to which you simply add the sour cream before serving (I wouldn't add sour cream to the sauce, then freeze). Very versatile. Thanks for sharing.

So easy and so delish.  At lunch I prepped my veggies and marinated my meat in red wine as suggested.  Then when it was supper time I just had to cook the meat and make the sauce.  Lets just say the meal was made so quickly, we were waiting on the noodles to cook!  I left out the beef broth and just added 1/2 C 2% milk that had 2 tbsp of flour added to it. Left out the white wine (cause I don't drink white). Also added almost 2 TBSP of worchestershire sauce and no mustard. Lastly, only used about 1 tbsp butter and it was great!

This turned out pretty good. Hard to store in fridge as lost much of it's moisture. Have to add water to reheat later on.

This is a GREAT recipe!  I changed it up a bit as I didn't have some ingredients and just wanted to try something different.  But this will be a staple in my home from now on. It is WONDERFUL!!  I used 1 pound Ground beef as that is what I had defrosted.  and I used Stone ground mustard in place of the dry mustard. Used all other ingredient amounts but changes some.  I used the green onions, white wine, and flour. I browned the beef in the butter, (will be cutting that back to 1/4 cup), added the green onions, broth, wine, mustard and flour.  Let simmer until it thickened a bit.  then removed from heat, and added the sour cream.  and served it over egg noodles, and topped with some of the green onion tops.   Thanks for sharing your recipe with us!!

This was the best stroganoff I have ever made and I used ground beef instead of chuck roast. I imagine it would have been even better without that substitution. Otherwise made it exactly as written and served over egg noodles. Both myself and my boyfriend (who doesn't like stroganoff) loved this. Thanks Donna! :)

This was just eh.  Not the "WOW" I was expecting after reading all the reviews.  I followed the recipe and even took the advice of other reviewers, but still this dish lacked something.  I added the Worcestershire Sauce, used top sirloin instead of chuck roast, put the mushroom in with the meat, added the cream cheese and still.....eh.  Will not be making this again.

I don't rate five stars unless I LOVE it!!! My husband LOVED this and couldn't put his fork down to breathe!! I was very happy!! I did however had on hand left over Christmas prime rib and had enough for two people. I cut it into strips and cooked it with the onions and followed the rest of recipe exact. I didn't have any white wine but I assure you it tasted FANTASTIC without it!! I will try the wine next time, I was wanting to add it to this recipe but had none to use. But this recipe is my replacement for my other recipe with the ground beef and cream of mushroom soup base. No more!! This recipe has changed my direction on how to do it right!!! Thank you!!!!

This recipe was great. My husband asked when I was going to make this again as he was eating his first bowl. Needless to say, there were no leftovers for dinner the next day, as my husband helped himself to a midnight snack of this. I did make a couple of small changes, but I don't think they affected the result much. I used a Vidalia onion and beef bouilion as I didn't have the green onions or beef broth.

I was looking for a recipe that didn't use cream soups and this is the recipe I've been looking for!  However, I substituted sirloin and fresh mushrooms.  I think I'll leave out the mustard too next time.  Just a personal preferance.

I can only give this 4 stars because I made a few changes, so I don't really know how the original comes out.  I sauteed yellow onions and fresh mushrooms in the butter, then sauteed the beef with the veggies.  Then added the flour and then the beef broth with 2T Worstchestshire.   Simmered as noted and then added red wine instead of white with a little addtl sour cream.  It was truly superb!  Thanks for the recipe!!

Fabulous! This is absolutely the best stroganoff recipe I have ever used. The whole family loved it. I followed the directions exact except I omitted the mushrooms.

Awesome !!!  My wife, who follows a different recipe, loved this one more.  And my kids, who don't like mushrooms, ate and enjoyed all of it.

Definitely take "BEEZLYS" advice on adding garlic, Worcestershire sauce and cream cheese, which makes all the difference. Additionally, as she stated, corn starch is much easier to use as a thickener than flour, unless you make a rue first.

The only liberties I took with the recipe was to use fresh instead of canned mushrooms, and I didn't bother to measure amounts, just "eye-balled" them instead.

BIG WIN AT MY HOUSE!!! I have a very picky eater at the house (my BF) and he LOVED it! He even went back for seconds which was a first! I did change a couple things...I omitted the green onions and substituted them for chopped sweet onions. I used another reviewer's suggestion and marinated the meat in white wine for an hour in the frig to tenderize the meat. Score! And I left out the white wine at the end because I wanted to keep my sauce thick. It was absolutely mouthwateringly amazing!! I just wish I had leftovers for tomorrow. Ah I guess that is the price you pay for making a great dish. :) I'm definitely keeping this recipe in the catalog! #winning

I served this over garlic mashed potatoes for a change of staples and my husband battled over getting a second serving even though he knew he shouldn't. He liked it so much, he changed his mind about getting lunch out at work and brought leftovers for lunch today. This was a hit with my whole family. Thanks for sharing!

This is very good, and I did make changes that were advised by other cook, i.e.,garlic, worchesteshire,mix the flour w/some broth prior to adding, and adding dark red wine at the end, just b/f mushrooms and sour cream.  I didn't add sour cream, I used cream cheese and cream fraiche.  This works so well if you are trying to "hold" this dish until guests arrive (in my case, husband!) I will provide a very easy recipe for cream fraiche that will keep for a month in the fridge.  !/2 pint half'n'half, 1/2/pint whipping cream, 2T. buttermilk.  Pour all together in jar and set out on counter 24hrs.  It will thicken, then refrigerate and use as you would sour cream. It is excellent to use as a base for other sauces.

Wonderful! We doubled this recipe for 8 people. Nothing left! Be sure to add fresh mushrooms. Very good with Light sour cream and an additional 1/4 cup cream cheese.  I used a leaner cut of roast and used meat tenderizer before cooking it. After cooking meat and onions on the stove for an hour, I place it in refrigerator overnight. Next day, simmered on low in crockpot for 4 hours. Perfectly tender.

My husband says he has never really had REAL stroganoff, so he doesn't know how it should taste ... but this tasted really good! (I served it over egg noodles, but rice would be good too.) It's a bit of a long, involved process, but quite well worth it in the end! I followed the suggestions of the most helpful reviewer, and it was great! (Marinate, mushrooms @ 2/3 mark & 1/3 C cream cheese with sour cream!) It was great & has been put into the "Repeater File" after only one serving!

This was sooooooo good.  Used regular onions instead of green, fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and red wine instead of white.  It was so creamy and delicious, can't wait to have it again.  A new permanent addition to my recipe book - thanks!

Quick & easy.  I made this with and without the mustard and didn't notice much difference (I'll just leave it out next time). I added 1 tsp of garlic and used sirlion sliced thin (took much less time to cook, cooked in minutes vs. 1 hour). I used 1/4 of a large white onion (instead of the green) and about 2-1/2 tsp of bouillon with 1-1/4 cups water (instead of the broth concentrate, you can skip the salt if you use the bouillon).

WOnderful recipe! The only changes I made were to use fresh mushrooms and served it over mashed cauliflower...true low carb. I found it easier to transfer the sauted beef (my local grocery store now carries chuck strips as well as sirloin) to a bowl while I cooked the onions and mushrooms. The result was a tender and flavorful delight. Patience is the key in getting the sauce to thicken. My husband loved it.

The taste of this dish was great! I did a few things different: I used 1 pound of lean ground beef and instead of browning it separate from the onions (used yellow insted of green), I combined the two ingredients, also adding garlic (about 1 Tbs).  I did not add any butter (I didn’t want the extra calories and fat) and it worked out fine.  The juice from the meat was plenty to sauté the onions.  Then, instead of mixing the 4 Tbs. of flour with only the juices, I mixed it in with the whole mixture and it had the same effect, it was just easier.  Since I used ground meat, I only simmered it for about 15 minutes, and then I added the remaining ingredients (used fresh mushrooms instead of canned) and simmered another 5 minutes.  The only thing I will do different next time is put a bit less wine.  I do like the taste of white wine, but since it is being added to a thick sauce, it doesn't have much time to cook out, so the flavor is stronger than I prefer.  I cooked egg noodles and mixed it all together. I'll definitely make this again! (from start to finish, it only took me about 30 minutes!)

A good solid Stroganoff to begin with, but I added 3 oz cream cheese to push it over the top.  I also added some pepper flakes to give it a bit of heat.

This is so delicious! I marinated the beef strips in wine, olive oil and garlic for a few hours and this reduced the cooking time. Also, I used fresh mushrooms which I added after browning the beef.  Incredible dish! Loved it!

I confess that I altered this recipe a bit...but, it was still WONDERFUL!  Believe it or not, I turned it into a 30 minute meal by using ground beef instead of chuck roast.  It was so easy.  I also used yellow onion, since it was what I had on hand.  Other than that I followed the recipe.   I browned the beef, added the onion and saute'd till tender then added the flour and beef broth.  I add the remaining ingredients and the sauce came together in minutes.  I served it over noodles and my whole family loved it.  They even asked me to put the recipe in our 'Family Favorites' recipe box.  Oh, and I didn't add salt at all.  The saltiness of the beef broth was perfect.  Try this tonight and you'll have dinner on the table in half an hour.

SO GOOD!!  We changed it up a little bit by using fresh baby bella mushrooms which we sauteed in butter before adding to the dish.  We also added one whole onion (in addition to the green onions).  Finally, we added some Worcestershire to the beef in addition to the salt and pepper to add more flavor.  Served with egg noodles.  We'll definitely be making this recipe for years to come!

This recipe was AWESOME.  I made it for my two brothers who each went back for 3rd's!  I marinated the beef in a cabernet for about 1/2 hour before cooking and didn't add any wine at the end.  Added a little bit of garlic salt and used 1/3 cup each sour cream and cream cheese at the end and it was devoured!!!  Thanks!

Once I figured out the right kind of meat to buy (I am kind of a novice as far as knowing my meats), I found this recipe to be FABULOUS!!! I also misread it my first time and used 4 TB butter instead of 4 oz. You definitely need 4 oz. It is so good. We have it quite often. Don't change anything. Don't 1/2 it even if you think you need to because the leftovers are just as good!

EXCELLENT! I used sirloin in place of chuck roast & was happy with the better cut of meat. I still can't get over 4oz butter (1 stick) - that's a lot of butter to brown the beef in. There was so much liquid with this amount of butter that it's impossible to follow the directions at this point: stir flour into juices on empty side of pan! There is no empty space! It's full of liquid! Anyway, since there was so much, I skipped adding the beef broth and threw in 2 cubes of beef boullion and maybe 1c water. This was easy to make and exceptionally tasty! I did add a few splashes of worstecshire (sp?) sauce and 1t minced garlic along with the mustard (used honey-mustard). I also chopped 4oz fresh mushrooms instead of using canned. We LOVED it! Very classy! Thanks for the post! A new favorite!

My favorite beef stroganoff EVER!!!  I do add more of everything (more onion, mustard, sour cream, wine, even beef broth sometimes).  I also like to add fresh dill at the end.  Don't think that red wine would go better just because it is a beef dish - the white wine and sour cream work perfectly together.  I have made this many times, and it is better with a better cut of meat - sirloin works great and isn't too expensive ( I usually use less meat than the two lbs the recipe calls for, making it a cheaper meal, plus the sauce is the best part!)

Easy, and EVERYONE (kids, adults) enjoyed it.  I used sirloin tip cut-up, gave kids extra dollop of sour cream when served at their request.  I used 2-cans beef consume and 3 pounds meat.  A keeper!  thanks!

This recipe was everything everyone claimed it to be; absolutely delicious! I used a little oil instead of butter to brown my meat, which was just plain old stew meat and some leftover london broil. I didn't have any mushrooms on hand so I  threw in a can of Golden Mushroom soup, used red wine instead of white and cooked everything in my slow cooker. The sauce was trememdous Donna and my whole family loved it!!!!

AWESOME!AWESOME!AWESOME!AWESOME!AWESOME!AWESOME!
My husband is from Sao Paulo, Brazil, were Stroganoff is very common.  My idea of Stroganoff was Hamburger Helper!  My hubby was horrified!  So I found this recipe and gave it a try.  My husband took one bite and declared that I was the perfect wife!  I guess a way to a man's heart really is through his stomach! :)  In the end of cooking time, I added another can of Beef Broth to make it a bigger dish.  I then added some Corn Starch to thicken it up and it did not compromise the taste at all.  This is the ULTIMATE Stroganoff dish.  Make a double batch if you want to allow people to have second and third helpings!

Simple, fast and delicious.  The sauce is fantastic even without the wine.  I don't always add the 'shrooms, either.  It's one of the first dishes cleaned off the table!  A little salty, I would even cut back on the salt some, but still tasty.

The finished product was wonderful; however, I had to double the sauce ingredients.  I doubled the beef broth, onions, mushrooms, mustard, flour.

My family (usually VERY picky) loved this recipe, mostly because they can't get enough gravy, ever! A couple of changes: I added a fresh sprig of thyme (left over from another recipe), used red wine and added it along with the beef broth,(later omitting the white wine), and added 2 cloves of garlic through my press.  Delicious and a definite keeper!

I tried this recipe today, with some changes. I used fresh mushrooms. I added two onions to it (we like onions a lot). I used corn starch to thicken rather than flour (corn or potato starch thicken as well or better than flour, and do not have that floury taste).  I used more sour cream than the writer, about double, I'd guess (I'm not much of one for measuring, I'm more of a "how does it taste" sort of gal).  I used about double the wine and cooked the alcohol off.  I also added garlic. I also did not trim the fat - that contains a lot of flavor, and we Americans should not be so scared of natural fats - the issue is excess, not the fat itself. 

In cooking, first I sauteed the onions, added the mushrooms, salted and peppered, set aside. I would have done some garlic then, but it was a bit of an afterthought. Then I cooked the meat, which I had seasoned (salt and pepper - again would have used garlic in this part, too, but afterthought), and tossed it in the starch. After it was cooked to desired doneness, set the meat aside, made the sauce, put the mushroom/onion mix back in, then the beef, then the sour cream, served over rice. It was pretty tasty.

In future, I think I would also use red wine rather than white. Red wine gives a more robust flavor. All in all, I think this recipe was an excellent guideline and a huge improvement over the family recipe I had.

Took advice from past reviewers and mixed flour with some beef stock before adding to pan.  Dash of worcestershire and cayenne to round it out.  Excellent flavor.  Used ground beef as I did not have ground chuck.  Delicious!

This was really, really good.  But of course I altered it some.  Ok, maybe quite a bit.  I used elk instead of beef (my husband's a hunter), vidalia instead of green onion, added a tbs of Worcestershire and a  ton of garlic (or something like 6 cloves).  I also didn't have any mushrooms and it was fine without them.
I think that the mustard is really the secret ingredient in this recipe, as I've made stroganoffs many times and none have been as tasty as this.  I'll be making this one again!!

Made this last night with chuck roast.  Omitted the white wine and did add some cream cheese, but I don't think I will use it next time as I don't think it probably added any flavor.  Used about 2 Tbsp of butter and 2 Tbsp of olive oil to brown the meat.  Worked just fine to leave the meat in the pan while cooking the onions.  I did mix 2 Tbsp of corn starch into the beef broth (used consomme) and added after adding broth to the pan, instead of the flour.  Turned out great with awesome flavor.  Most of the work is cutting up the meat and onions, so don't be intimidated by the amount of time.  Most of the time is just simmering.  Great recipe!

Made this for my husband last night.  Didn't change anything except I used fresh baby portabellas and a petite sirloin roast and also double the amount of everything except the beef so we would have more sauce and veggies.  It was delicious!  This is most definitely a keeper recipe!  Thank you Donna!

This recipe turned out great.  Instead of using canned mushrooms I sautéed fresh mushrooms right after cooking the meat then added in the green onion.  I also used sirloin tip roast.  Delish!

I've made this dish a few times now and have had success each time.  I really like the flavor. I've made a few minor modifications that work well for our family:  (1) I use spelt flour instead of A/P white flour, (2) I add a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce at the [add] broth stage, (3) I omit the white white and instead use a healthy squeeze of lemon/lime to add acid for balance, and (4) I always always use fresh organic mushrooms that I add mid-way through the hour simmer.  I think it's vital for freshness and to give the dish extra liquid since I'm not adding the white wine.  Also, a nice stock really gives it depth.  I use Heston Blumenthal's pre-made refrigerated beef stock and it works nicely. Top with chopped spring onions just before serving over a bed of fettuccine (or egg) noodles and you've got a winning dinner. Enjoy!

Made this according to the recipe except for using top sirloin beef or filet (no need to simmer until tender). I also cooked sliced fresh mushrooms instead of using canned.  Be sure to not get the sour cream to hot (it can curdle).  I stirred in the white wine, waited a minute to cook the alcohol out, added the mushrooms,  turned off the heat and then stirred in the sour cream.  The second time I made this, I added the fresh mushrooms after I added the beef broth and so there was no need to cook them in advance.  I used baby portobellas; delicious.

Oh my goodness!!!! This is the BEST Beef Stroganoff recipe.  Either I have never made it properly or this is just REALLY, REALLY good.  The only tweaks I made were that I used sweet yellow onions cut thick and quartered, added fresh mushrooms and used BETTER THAN BULLION beef bullion instead of condensed beef broth.  I will definitely be making this again!

When it goes in your mouth, it makes you go, "mmmm!" Made this today and it is absolutely delicious! We used leftover filet mignon, so the meat was melt in your mouth tender. Another substitution we used was Freixenet Champagne for the white wine. I sautéed each stage separately and then put them together at the end so I could have room in my pan for a good golden browning on the mushrooms and scallions. I also used fresh mushrooms. Because I am gluten free, I used gluten free all-purpose flour to thicken the sauce with a pinch of Xanthum Gum. Serving for my husband over big fat egg noodles.

This recipe plus comments is a huge favorite in my house! I use sirloin tip every time and don't bother marinating. I saute in the butter and add the wine once meat is mostly browned, then I add yellow onions until translucent and then fresh sliced shrooms. let this simmer before adding the mustard (key ingredient!). I then use one can of beef consume and one can of golden mushroom condensed soup. I allow this to simmer for 10-20 minutes (depending on my patience) before adding half a brick of cream cheese and a couple scoops of sour cream. I usually dont need much else to spice it up, it has so much flavor! I serve over mashed potatoes. YUM!!

I tried this recipe last night and it was a hit. I made a few changes, but then again, I always do. I used tip sirloin instead of chuck. I used yellow onion instead of green onion. My family is not big into mushrooms, so at the end I added Worcestershire Sauce, Cream of Mushroom, and the sour cream. I didn't get a chance to try the garlic cloves yet. And I intended on forming my own super small meatballs, but didn't get around to it. I will definitely toss those in next time. I will be cooking this again as per my family's request.

We eat this way too often! You can make it with pretty much any beef, you can slice it as the recipe states, or if you're in a rush the pre-cut stuff for stir-fry works just as well. You can even use ground beef, though really cut back on the butter if you do. Very tasty and easy to make.

I made this yesterday it was very good, but I did  make a few changes to the recipe, 1st. I added 2 sm.cloves of garlic crushed and chopped fine to the onions, as they cooked and then I added about a Tab. more or less of cream cheese to the sauce along with the sour cream. Also I used 1/2 tsp. powered mustard instead of prepared. I am not a fan of prepared mustard when cooking. Then I added a Tab. or so of Worchester sauce. Served this to my brother and received the highest complement ever. "This taste just like moms!"

The recipe was simple and the results were delicious. I used beef chuck cut into cubes and prepared everything in my trusty pressure cooker. In less than 30 mins(thanks to my pressure cooker) dinner was served. All that was heard at the table was the clicking sounds of forks hitting the plates and humming as my husband and daughters were eating.SUCCESS!!!

Loved it! I added a Tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce which gives it a great tangy flavor.  I didn't have the wine, so just added more broth.

Like others, I made a few changes. Marinated the steak pieces in red wine (old vine Zin) for 6 hours. Prior to pan frying in butter (YUM!) I dipped the steak pieces in a combination of flour, pepper, and salt. Then fried in batches so as not to crowd the pan. I still added white wine, beef stock,sour cream and a little flour to the sauce. This is one of my all time FAVORITE dinners! Thanks for a great base recipe :)

This was scrumptious!  In the last hour of cooking, I was called away from home, so I threw it into a crockpot.  Put it on high for about 2 hours.  Meat was very tender and the flavors were fantastic.  I actually used venison, instead of beef because that's what I had in the freezer.    Did not add mushrooms, as the family doesn't like them and did not add the white wine.  Used regular yellow onions.....it's what I had in stock.  Took the suggestion of marinating the meat in red wine just about an hour before cooking.  Highly recommend this recipe even though I tweaked it a bit.  That's what I normally do with recipes, but I still give it 5 stars because it gave me an excellent original recipe to tweak!

This is wonderful, had to make some changes( lactose intolerant) so I subbed the butter with lactose free margarine and the sour cream with creamed goat cheese mixed with lactose free vanilla yogurt. It was excellent and the flavor was so good, served it over egg noodles. I made this for some friends we had over and it was loved by all. A keeper for sure. Thank you Donna for this recipe.

Great recipe. I also marinated my meat for an hour in red wine and the meat came out so tender.  I also stir fry the meat in garlic and olive oil instead of butter first then transfer into a bowl.  I sauteed 1/2 chopped yellow and 1/2 red onions in 2 ounces of butter with fresh mushrooms, garlic and added some chopped green peppers.  I also omitted adding the white wine at the end since I had already added red wine earlier with the marinated meat.  My favorite beef stroganoff by far!

Best stroganoff both my husband and I have ever had and this is saying something since he is somewhat of a conossieur of stroganoff, orders it whenever it is on the menu. I used sirloin steak and marinated it in white wine overnight.  Used regular onions and fresh mushrooms. Removed the beef after browning and sauted the onion and mushrooms.  Removed those from pan, thickened the sauce and added meat,onion and mushrooms back pan to simmer.  Did not use extra wine at end of recipe.  Good stuff!

This was really good! Never made beef stroganoff before but I'm glad I did! Seems to go great with the nice fall weather we're having. Added 1/3 cup cream cheese and a 1tbsp of worchestire sauce like others suggested.

I ended up cooking this for a total of 2 hrs b/c my hubby was running late at work, but the end result was fall apart beef- wonderful taste, easy clean-up. Will make again. I did not need to add in sour cream, sauce was thick enough & light enough for my taste.

This is about as easy a stroganoff recipe as it gets.  I made it easier by using dried onions that went in with the beef broth.  I also added an extra cup of water to extend the simmering time.

My family and I thought this was really good. The only changes I made were using fresh crimini mushrooms in place of the canned and I used sherry instead of the white wine. The sherry gave it an awesome flavor. I will definitely make this again.

Wow! This is without a doubt fantastic!  I used fresh Shitaki mushrooms and garlic at the beginning.  Used Worcestershire sauce as another reviewer suggested and finished mine with port since I had it on hand.  Just awesome!

I am just beginning to get the hang of cooking, and love trying out new recipes for comfort food. This one was excellent! Everyone loved it, even my 14 month old who had been spitting out everything I gave him before. I used ground beef instead and made a lot of the suggestions from past reviewers (marinated meat in red wine before, added a FEW cloves of garlic, added cream cheese

Yummy!  I did tweak a few things per other reviews.  I marinated the beef in red wine for a few hours.  Added 1 tablespoon minced garlic to one medium yellow onion.  When I stirred in the mustard I also added 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce. I added 1/3 cup cream cheese to the sour cream.

Delicious!!  I wish I had read the reviews because I definitely would have marinated the steak in the wine before cooking and I think I would have gone with the red wine instead of the white.  But overall, great recipe and delicious results!!!

Very good.  I halved the recipe.  Used 1 lb of sirloin and 8 oz fresh mushroom.  I used a trick I learned a long time ago - freeze the meat slightly before slicing - makes much easier to cut.  Not much left over after the 2 of us were done!!!  :)

This is cheap version of Steak Dianne and for the time required to tenderize the meat, I'd rather eat the cost of the tenderloin. Not to mention that, as per the directions, the sauce became lumpy from the flour.  You'd be better off removing the beef from the juice, adding the flour and making sure your gravy isn't lumpy than following the directions as is.  There was also the problem of the gravy being flavourless despite the addition of Worcester sauce, fresh minced garlic and fresh, sautéed mushrooms.

We have eaten stroganoff for years but it was always the package seasoned kind. We found out that the kids cant have anything artificial or with preservatives so there was a long time that we didnt eat any. When we found this recipe and tried it the were so excited they each ate 2 and 3 bowls! I was afraid the wine would make it so tangy for them but they didnt even notice. And bonus, no behavioral problems from the nasty packaged garbage!

This was great I didn't have a can of condensed broth so I used the beef granules and used sirloin instead of the beef chuck since I didn't have that either but didn't change anything else and this was great a definite keeper

I followed all of BEEZLYS recommendations and in addition I did NOT use canned mushrooms.  I sauteed baby bellas in a cast iron skillet and stirred them in at the last second.  Best stroganoff ever.  But really the 5 stars belongs to BEEZLYS!

What a perfectly delicious dinner!  Unfortunately, I had to omit the mushrooms because I'm the only one who likes them.  Otherwise, it was a huge hit with my husband and three kids!

This was a good base recipe. I found it needed a little more seasoning and the sauce needed to be a little thicker. My family liked it overall and it will be a good go to dish for a weeknight dinner.

Very good.  Similar to the creamy stroganoff recipes, without the half and half.  Full flavor, very good. I had a left over roast already cooked and used it.  Will definitely make again.

Loved this recipe!  I accidentally left out the wine at the end and it was still good!  I love beef stroganoff and have tried lots of recipes.  This is one of the good ones!  As I added the flour and broth, it got a little lumpy and I was nervous that it wasn't going to turn out right.  But after all the simmering and occasional stirring, it all came out smooth in the end.

I'm a vegetarian, so instead of using beef I used Gardien's beefless tips and followed the directions- but instead of using green onions- I used a whole yellow onion, I used Dijon mustard instead of regular and veggie stock- turned out pretty nice- very easy and flavourful

Flavor was good.  Only had sirloin steak available, so was on the dry side after removing all fat.  Added more broth to make up for lost juices.  Served on noodles, probably would have been better on dirty rice or wild rice.  May make again if mood strikes me.

I have been using this recipes for a year now. The first time I made it tasted great. I know my family has different taste so have now modified the recipe for my family. I use fresh mushrooms vs canned, So before browning the meat I sauté the mushrooms, garlic and onions together, then removing them from the heat I then brown the meat. I have a large family so leaving the meat in the pan is not going to work so I then remove the meat add a little of the white wine to get the chunks off stuff off the bottom. Then proceed add in the rest of ingredients along with the beef and mushroom mix back in and simmer for a hour.

Very yummy. I used fresh mushrooms, added some fresh ground nutmeg at the end and served over old fashioned egg noodles that I had tossed with butter and chopped fresh parsley. Outstanding! The fresh flavor of the parsley is a perfect foil for the creamy, beefy goodness. The kids were stealing bites from the pan.

This just wasn't very good.  Even though it doesn't call for a lot of mustard, I found the taste of it over powering the other flavors.  If I try it again, it will definitley be with less mustard-probably without it all together.

Absolutely the best Beef Stroganoff I have ever eaten .When I prepared it for the first time I didn't have the recipe to refer to because there was an internet outage that day so a friend read the ingredients off for me over the phone!I didn't know that the wine went in w/ the mushrooms+sour cream at the end so I simmered it w/ the wine and it came out delish!
Also,because I have to make a larger batch to feed my family,I would never be able to push the meat to one side so instead I removed it w/ a slotted spoon into my simmering pan then made the gravy in the first pan=)

Let me preface this by saying and I am a terrible cook! About 50% of everything I make turns out awful, even if I follow the recipe exactly. My hubbie asked for beef stroganoff tonight and I found this recipe. I had a small filet, fresh mushrooms and dry sherry rather than chuck roast, canned mushrooms and white wine, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  I cooked the mushrooms with the onions. The filet was so tender, I reduced the cooking time. It was fantastic! Thank you for a great recipe, Donna. It was a big hit at our house and I will make it again soon.

Made this for a Christmas party, I left out the white wine.  I also did not have any sour cream, but I did have plain Greek yogurt, so I used that instead.  Everyone really enjoyed this.  Thanks for sharing.

This was so yummy! I followed the recipe with one exception. My husband is a recovering alcoholic so can not have wine. Some of you may think that the alcohol content burns off while cooking, but you are mistaken. While some of it does, it will never completely! So...I substituted the wine with lemonade. It may sound crazy, but wine is acidic, so I simply replaced it with what I had on hand. AMAZING!!!

The absolutely best beef stroganoff I have ever had!  I didn't cook the meat quite long enough though.  I might cook the meat in the slow cooker overnight next time then finish the rest of the recipe the next day.  I also didn't add any wine since I didn't have any on hand.  It was still delicious!

This was very easy to make and the gravy has superb flavor.  The only suggestion is to simmer the meat for closer to 2 hours.

I made this exactly as as written and it was very good. 
The second time around I used corn starch in place of flour (same amount), used broccolli bits in place of mushrooms (amount to taste), cut sour cream down to 1/4 Cup, used beef broth in place of wine (more as needed). It was Delicious!
Thank You!

I added a 6oz can of tomato paste. It made it taste more like the stroganoff I had on a trip to Estonia. Got high marks from the family who tend to be neutral on stroganoff.

This was a great recipe that I served for Christmas Eve this year.  My family loved it so much that I made more to go with what little we had left and had it for Christmas Day too.  By the way, if you use a more expensive grade of meat you don't have to cook it as long for the meat to get tender.

I have not made this yet but I must comment on the review made on 12/19/11.  The person gave this 3 stars and said they did not know how stroganoff should taste.  Then they changed it and said it was a good base.  How can you give 3 stars without knowing how it should taste?  How can you change it without knowing?  A good base for what?

Great recipe.  Marinated the beef in wine before and it was great.  Skipped the wine later in the recipe.  use 1/2 corn starch and flour.  It worked great.  Can't wait to try it again.

Recipe is great! Actually much easier than it states! I cut the beef much smaller, so it only needed about 15-20 minutes to cook. Only 4 stars because I've made better sauces with tomato paste and more onions. Yet, this one is delicious every time!

Thanks for this great, easy recipe.  I served it over organic brown rice and cut down the butter significantly and it was wonderful with less guilt!

I tried this recipe last week and I am making it again. I personally loved it, I don't miss the "cream of mushroom" salty taste, and even without the sour cream the sauce is delicious. I did however use a regular onion, fresh mushrooms and omitted the wine. (I would end up drinking the rest, so I never opened the bottle) LOL......Highly impressed. Thank you.

Awesome easy recipe, but I would never use Chuck again. I am new to cooking with meats and the chuck roast was a little tough. I know because I added in some ribeye I had laying around, and the chuck was definitely tough. AWESOME flavor and thickness to the sauce. There was none left, everyone liked it, but I would use a different meat next time.

Yummy. I made my stroganoff in the crockpot and followed a couple of suggestions of others and used fresh mushrooms (sautéed before adding to crockpot) and added cream cheese along with the sour cream. My DH loved this and will definitely be making this recipe again.

I made this with mostly the same ingredients, just substituting sirloin, fresh mushrooms, reg onions, and bouillon paste for the canned ... and of course, added garlic.
Also, I like my sauce browner, so I sauteed the onions and garlic first, then browned the meat in the same pan over med high heat in small batches ... added flour to the last batch to darken the sauce.  Alternately, flour the beef directly before sauteeing -- I've used both methods with success.
I don't think the wine adds to the flavor ... I'll leave it out next time ...  it actually seemed to hide the nice sour cream taste.

Enjoyed this but did make a few subs.  I had only yellow onions, chicken broth, and used ginger ale instead of white wine.  Tasted fine w/ the subs.  Will fix again.

Great recipe.  I used round steak instead of chuck roast, seasoned the meat with garlic powder, salt and pepper before cooking.

Really good. I did not give it 5 stars since I used the recipe as more of a starting point. I cooked my roast all day in seasoned beef broth and red wine. I sautéed fresh mushrooms in the butter, added the wine broth juice, added the flour and boiled it down.  I added the sour cream in the last few moments.  I put it all over grandma's noodles. Will make again for sure!  Thanks!

I wanted to make this like a beef burgundy type of recipe. I used condensed mushroom soup instead of beef broth. I put it in the slow cooker for 6 hours and used 1/2 cup of red wine instead of water and the white wine. I also added 4 oz. cream cheese and 8 oz of sour cream instead of the 16 oz sour cream.  I didn't need the butter, and added fresh mushrooms. The crockpot is amazing!  I added the sour cream and cream cheese at the end.  

AMAZING! Make sure your meat is 2 lbs after you cut the fat out of the meat!

Very good. Would make again for sure. I did as others suggested and marinated the beef in red wine for about an hour and added a clove of garlic. Didn't use any white wine. YUM :)

I really used this recipe for the sauce as I had some steak  I wanted to use.  I cut the cooked steak into thin strips and started there.  I loved the additional tang the mustard gave it.  I didn't have any white wine so I used chicken broth at the end.  It was a little thick, it could have used more beef broth.  I will make again, excellent flavor.

This is a good stroganoff that has a little more kick than your basic recipe. I omitted the white wine and added a little fresh minced garlic (added at the same time as green onions) and it was delicious. I also used fat free sour cream to save on the calories (did you catch how much butter it calls for??!!) Super yummy.

Very good recipe. I did marinate in the red wine and worchestshire and garlic for a while before browning and that gave the meat wonderful flavor and good texture. I omitted the onion and white wine at the end,since I had used red wine for the marinating. My only issue that I had was adding the flour to the juices. It was probably an error on my part, but it didn't turn out well. I simmered it for about 1 1/2 hrs and it had a decent gravy, but there were still flour-y lumps in it. Again, probably something I did wrong but it didn't work for me. Overall the taste was great and I would make it again, but I would use Wondra flour and mix separtely before adding to the juices.Thanks for a great recipe!

Yum! This is so good. We doubled the sauce and I highly recommend doing so. The only ingredient changes we made were to use half sour cream and half heavy cream, as we were out of creme fraiche and we also added 2 tablespoons of worcestershire. The fresh dill at the end is perfection. This is so not the campbell's cream-of-whatever soup variety of stroganov that you had as a kid and thank God for that. This is delicious! bullmastiff http://www.dogs-info.net/html/Breeds/2010/1105/Bullmastiff-Breed.html

I made this recipe and loved it. I used stewing beef and just cut it up into small pieces. I also used fresh mushrooms and chicken broth instead of the white wine.

I used to hate beef stroganoff as a kid but am sooo happy I tried this recipes! will make again and again

This is one of our favorite recipes! It's excellent as written, but very adaptable. I don't generally put wine in and I use whatever type of onions we may have available. Also, fresh shiitake or portobella mushrooms really add a lot of flavor if they're sauteed prior to simmering everything down. Excellent - thank you so much for the recipe!

Good, I would try with ground beef.  I did add worchestershire sauce & cream cheese.  I did not have beef broth so I used 2 boulions & water.  Used cornstarch not flour.

This is very easy to make and so delicious!  Other than doubling and using fresh mushrooms instead of canned, I followed the recipe as stated.  The chuck roast came out exceptionally tender; I will try sirloin next time for ease.  I'm not a fan of the flavor of wine in food but I do prefer to try original recipes before modifying so I used it and it was just fine.  Served over wide egg noodles - so yummy!  Definitely a go to recipe!

The best I have ever made.  I did saute my mushrooms separately  and I used red wine instead of white.  Used some really good quality beef filet too.

Great flavor.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and sauteed them with the onions. I was out of mustard (can you believe it?) so I used a small amount of dry mustard. Very good recipe.

This is one of the first recipes we tried on this site 4 years ago. Everyone loves it! I am always proud to make it when we have company. I have used several different cuts of beef. I usually just simmer it longer if it is a tougher cut. Delicious!!!

This was fantastic, especially the sauce. Both my wife and I loved it, and neither one of us has had beef stroganoff since we were kids, and both of us remembered HATING it. Thanks so much for the great recipe.

This recipe was like manna from Heaven.  It is definitely going in my personal cookbook at home for permanent use.  Only advice, if using fresh mushrooms, add about 15 mins before completion.

I hadn't made beef stroganoff in a very long time.  But it sounded great!  I improvised on a couple of ingredients I didn't have and I used a large sweet onion instead of green onions. I also didn't have mushrooms but it came out fine!  Wonderful even!  Because I am Gluten Free I used corn starch instead of flour.  The mustard addition was excellent! My one suggestion is to wait until everything is finished cooking and turn the heat off.  Then add a little of the sauce to the sour cream to temper it, and stir that into the stroganoff at the very end.  This was easy (though more time consuming than that, at least for me) and delicious!! Thanks!!!

This was pretty good, but be careful of the white wine addition. I felt like this made it a bit on the sour side, but others who ate it didn't notice at all and found it quite delicious! I will be making this one again.   =)

Easy recipe, my kids love it.  I use sirloin, about 1/2 sweet onion instead of green onion, saute and use fresh mushrooms which I add last 10 minutes. I have made this recipe without mustard and wine (only because I was out) and it was still great.

Very good recipe! Hubby loved it! Next time I will cook slightly longer after I add the wine or add less wine. And I will add more meat to the dish! Yummy

Great recipe!  I used flank steak instead of chuck roast.  I sliced it thin and cooked it in the gravy for about half hour.  Flank is a tender cut so it doesn't have to be cooked as long.  I used rice wine instead of white wine and fresh white mushrooms.  Used yellow onions instead and served it with egg noodles.  I thickened up the gravy with cornstarch at the end so I didn't use any flour.  I will double the gravy the next time and use it with swedish meatballs.  I will use this recipe again and again.  Thanks for sharing.

I love this recipe.  This time I had lamb that I was going to make stew with but instead used in the stroganoff and from now on will be the only meat I use for this recipe.  Perfect flavor.  Sometimes when I have no white wine I even add sake.  Interesting flavor a well.  I make this recipe at least once a month.

We made this for dinner the other night, umm umm good! I followed the recipe almost to the letter, with a couple of very minor changes (all involved cooking order, not ingredients). I used a very tasty pinot griego for my wine, the aroma of this cooking was absolutly mouthwatering. The flavor however was FANTASTIC. This is a perfect dish for date nite or a family meal. Try it, I promise you will love it.

My husband just loves this (we don't use the wine) and it is very very good.. sometimes we add extra sour cream and sometimes we add the cream cheese combo and it's great every time.

Made for my boyfriend as a request.  I didn't add the wine since I didn't have any on hand.  It still turned out great and the sauce was rich and very flavorful.  My boyfriend loved it!

The first time I made it I did as written except used fresh mushrooms, it was very bland and not good. I made it a second time with these changes along with following a lot of other reviewers advice. After browning meat, I put in a slow cooker with a 1/2 pkt of french onion soup mix, can of condensed golden mushroom soup, 1/4 beef broth, 1/3 c. white wine. I truly believe that the worcestershire sauce and garlic are absolutely needed in this recipe and add to taste.  Near the end, I used also 1/3 c. of cream cheese along with the sour cream and it made a difference. The butter is WAY too much and please cut in half, at least! This is, I agree, not "traditional" beef stroganoff but for an easy version, it's a good start. For cooks who are looking for true stroganoff, this is a recipe of convenience and not gourmet.

well we didnt have any white wine, so we skipped it. i'm sure that would have made a huge difference if we would have had it. i didnt like the canned mushrooms in it. would have been better with fresh mushrooms. but the flavor was nice.

Really good! Changes: I added 1/3 cup of cream cheese AND 1/3 cup of sour cream. I also added garlic and worcester sauce and salt and pepper to taste. I recommend all of these changes. I also marinated the beef in red wine for about 1/2 hour. I would do this for at least 2 hours next time. Also, I used the chuck roast because it was on the recipe and it was the cheapest but I recommend a sirloin because it will likely be more tender. I'll use sirloin the next time I make this and post my thoughts!

My mate and I seriously enjoyed this.  Some people might find the sour cream taste to be a little strong, especially if they're used to stroganoff out of the box, but the beef was cheap and the food was delicious.  Will make again.

This recipe was delicious!  Made it just as written except I used fresh mushrooms. Since the recipe wasn't clear as to what kind of wine to use, cooking or drinking wine, I used Pinot Grigio white wine at the suggestions of a liquor store employee who said not to use cooking wine because of the high sodium count.   This was very easy to make and I would definetely make it again!!

Very good and we prepared it the easy way - instead of simmering on stove, we put it in the crock pot on low for several hours.  The meat was fork tender.  Also added a few splashes of Lea and Perrins Worcestershire and less wine.  If it becomes too dry - just add a little more broth or wine (or water).  Used Reames frozen egg noodles (prepared per package directions) then added them to the mixture with the sour cream.  Great for company because you don't have to stand at the stove.

I followed a few other reviews and marinated the beef for an hour in cabernet wine (omitted the wine at the end), then used yellow onion instead of green, fresh mushrooms and a dab of cream cheese at the end.  Delicious!!!

This was quite good. I used precut stew meat which came out very tender and tasty. Also, I sauteed the onions and mushrooms prior to adding it to the ground beef, it seems liked there was a lot of butter but it was pretty tasty. Didn't have white wine so that got left out and had to use instant potatoes to thicken it which actually worked really well. Kids enjoyed this. Next time will add garlic powder and extra pepper. Will make again, thank you!

This recipe was a great start to learning stroganoff. I felt as though the end product didn't match my expectations, though overall this was a good meal.

I don't typically keep wine in the house so I ended up using beer instead.  I soaked a chuck roast for a couple of hours in the beer ahead of time and ommitted adding it to the sauce at the end.  While I am sure it gave it a different flavor, it was DELICIOUS!  My kids ate it up and asked me to make it one of our regular meals!  I didn't have egg noodles in the house one time making this so I made homemade dumplings instead.  I also used flour instead of corn starch but used a bit less than what was asked for.  If I thought it was getting too thick I just added a little more beef broth to thin it out.  But I do like a thicker gravy.  This is very good!  Thank you for the recipe!!  8D

Nice, but using beef tenderloin strips cuts down the cooking time for special occasions.  Marinate beef tenderloin a short time in cooking sherry.  Add cut up fresh garlic cloves to sliced vidalia onions and if not in a hurry, also saute fresh mushrooms......remove, then saute the beef....return veggies.add the beef broth (or a little more); use cornstarch or wondra flour for thickening agent.... and stir in the sour cream at end or for those lactose intolerant, serve it on the side....for individuals to mix in on their plate.  If no lactose intolerant folks, just stir it in as I do at the end and serve over buttered egg noodles with rye bread, red cabbage from a jar, green beans.....you really can't mess up beef stroganoff, no matter which way you make it.

My boyfriend said this was the best beef stroganoff he had ever had! Two small changes. I used fresh mushrooms, and regular onions since I didn't have green ones. Delicious!

I used ground beef and it was still very very good. I find stroganoff really bland usually, this one is awesome. Thank you.

Delicious and the best I've ever prepared!  I substituted fresh pearl mushrooms for the canned and added them when I sauteed the onions.  I also used one medium onion instead of the green onions.

I used fresh mushrooms and yellow onion. Other than that - followed to a T. Gave it 4 stars: my husband loved it, but I found it extremely bland. Smells great, just like my mom used to make, but there is something missing in the taste... Cant put my finger on it.

This was wonderful! I used fresh mushrooms rather than canned mushrooms because I don't care for the flavor of mushrooms from a tin can. lol I did everything same. When using fresh mushrooms they make more juices because the water cooks from them, so I added a little more flour. It gave us more sauce which is what we love, the saucier the better. The seasonings and everything for this recipe is fantastic and DO NOT LEAVE OUT THE WINE! The wine is one of the key ingredients for the right flavor to this recipe. Five stars from my family.

I made this recipe as written. My wife and I really enjoyed it. The chuck was nice and tender and the sauce very flavorful. I have to admit that the sauce was pretty rich, probably due to the amount of butter. A nap was in order shortly after this Sunday meal. I still give it 5 stars because it was very good and the richness of the sauce likely was intended. I just need to do something next time to reduce the richness somewhat without taking away from the overall flavor of the dish. I'll likely try reducing the amount of butter by at least half and see what happens or perhaps even try using something other than real butter. I'm really not a health conscious fanatic....it's just a personal taste preference I'm talking about here. I too found it easier to work on the sauce after the meat was removed from the pan first. Also, the chuck wasn't completely thawed when I trimmed off the fat and cut the meat into pieces. I had no problem and it wasn't nearly as time consuming as some other reviewers reported. I can only assume that having the meat just slightly on the frozen side made the task easier. Of the reviews I had time to read, quite a number of folks reported excellent results marinating the meat in red wine for a few hours before cooking and even adding fresh garlic and Worcestershire sauce. The recipe is tasty as is, but I may try some of these suggestions for something different and out of curiosity. Fresh mushrooms instead of canned sounds like a good idea too.

I used beef round instead of chuck because that is what I had on hand. Still came out very tender. I used 1 package pre-sliced fresh mushrooms instead of canned and added with onions. This was really good, but the sauce was a tad thin. I also felt like it was missing just a little something. I will definitely make again, it was definitely good, but next time I will add a little more flour or sour cream. I think a tablespoon of tomato paste or so and maybe a splash of worchestshire sauce might also add a little bit of needed flavor.******REVISED**** Added 1/2 TBSP Hungarian paprika to meat while simmering with beef broth. Skipped mustard, and added 1 TSP Worchestshire sauce. Only used 3 TBSP butter. The paprika & worchestshire gave it that added little bit it needed. It earned the fifth star with these additions!

EVERY time I make Beef Stroganoff [only using this recipe of course] I get a ton of complements on what a good cook I am. Then I get bombarded with requests for this recipe. This is my husbands favorite meal and he is ALWAYS happy when I make it. The few modifications I made are:  Using all the green onion, not just the white part. Using Spicy Brown mustard instead of regular mustard..it gives it a nice sour kick Marinate the beef overnight, or at least a few hours in Worceshire sauce Double the garlic Use Lawry's seasoned pepper if possible.  Much to my husband's dismay, I don't like mushrooms so I omit it from this recipe (a disgrace to stroganoff, I know) however...the next time I make it I do plan on using REAL and FRESH mushrooms as another reviewer said. I as well my husband don't do caned mushrooms.

My family wiped this out! The LOVED it, my picky kids, everyone. No repeats. I was shocked because Beef Stroganoff has never been the prettiest dish to look at. My changes were whole wheat egg noodles, cream cheese (a must!), red onions, and thinly sliced sirloin steak. This is the recipe rotation now.

This was good.  Next time I will use dijon instead of prepared mustard though.  And just a tiny bit.  The end product was a tiny bit bland for us, so I did have tweek it a bit, but not much.

Very simple and very tasty!  I added fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned, and just added them a few minutes earlier.  If you use lowfat sour cream and a good trans-fat free margarine, such as Smart Balance(TM), it still tastes rich and creamy, but has a lot less fat.  You can also easily make this veggie (use vegetable bouillon and your favorite fake beef product).  I don't eat beef, so this is what I did.  The only other change I made was to add Dijon mustard (Grey Poupon) instead of regular.  Yum!

this was delicious.  I borrowed other reviewers suggestions. I marinated a couple packs of lean beef stew (already cut in large pieces) in red wine for a couple hours.  [Here's a tip for cutting larger cuts of meat, put it in the freezer for about an hour prior to cutting.  It's much eaiser!]  I then used some garlic in the sauce and fresh mushrooms.  A small palmful of rosemary was added as well.  I served over rice with some peas and had a very happy family!

A wonderful staple that should be in any family cook's recipe box! I made my strognaoff in a dutch oven on the stove and didn't have to remove the meat while I browned the onions.  The lovely thing about using a dutch oven is that you can leave it on the stove on the lowest setting and with that tight heavy lid, the meat tenderizes till you can cut it with a fork as long as you cook it "Low and Slow" I actually ended up cooking the meat between 1 hour and 45 minutes to 2 hours due to having to take a child to basketball practice but the end result was beef so tender, none of us used a knife to cut the meat on our plates! (Some of the meat had stuck to the bottom of the dutch oven but once I added the mushrooms and white wine and stirred with a wooden spoon, the stuck bits became unstuck and everything was fine.) I read the recipe wrong and added 1 t DRY mustard instead of the PREPARED mustard and the end result was still wonderful.  I didn't add the sour cream until right before I was going to serve - just let it heat through and then spooned it onto the hot egg noodles sprinkled with poppy seeds I had already cooked. This way I didn't worry about the sour cream curdling. My daughter has requested this recipe to go into her notebook of recipes she is building in anticipation of the day she moves out and has to cook (she's only 6 right now!). A definite keeper written AS IS!!

I was very happy with this Dish. I took the Suggestions of other Reviewers and added 1/3 Cup Cream Cheese, 1/3 Cup Sour Cream and a Splash of Worcestershire Sauce. Sadly, I did not have any White Wine, so I went without, but will definitely try it next Time!

Absolutely delicious! Marinated beef in red vine with salt and pepper. IT was really tender after that. Followed the recipe, but used dijon mustard instead of regular.Adds a nice kick to the meal.In russian recipe we usually add heavy cream instead of sour cream, but I really liked this flavor. Will definitely make this again. Thank you very much for sharing.

Amazing!  I used fresh mushrooms.  I read the reviews and instead of adding the wine at the end, I added it with the other liquids so it reduced and didn't make it watery.  I used red wine instead of white which made the meat quite hearty.  I also added 1/3 cup of sour cream AND 1/3 cup of cream cheese.  I will definitely repeat!

This was pretty good.  I did marinate the meat in wine beforehand and use fresh mushrooms.  My only suggestion would be to use top sirloin instead of chuck roast.  Amazing!

Great recipe but the key is the mustard.  I made it 2 times, the first time I forgot the mustard and was not too impressed, the second time I remembered the mustard and WOW, huge difference. It still amazes me how a simple ingredient can make such a difference.

Very good comfort food.  Used a whole onion instead and added extra red and white wine, and worcestershire and lots of fresh mushrooms.  Not necessary to fry the meat first etc.  I did the onions and mushrooms first and then added the meat after a few minutes, then added the stock and wine.  In the end very tender meat and also great as leftovers!

I thought this was really good. I was a little wary of adding the flour so early but it worked. It had a nice flavor and I liked the addition of the wine which I'd never had before. I will definitely use again.

I'm eating this as I write... it's SO good! Only thing I changed was substituting fresh mushrooms for the canned mushrooms. This recipe is perfect. My very picky husband said it was the best stroganoff he's ever had and he's a former chef. Try it!

Very good!  Followed the suggestions in the first review.  Used red wine instead of white.
We made it in a pressure cooker, it was done and tender in only 25 minutes!

This was soooooo good, and SOOOO easy!!!!! I made it for my husband and he ate two platefuls. The only changes I made were to use beef tips instead of bothering with the roast (SUCH a time saver) and leaving out the mushrooms at his insistence. Even so, this was an awesome recipe that we will DEFINITELY be repeating. So good!

This was very good. My first time making beef stroganoff. I had some extra wine, so was drinking that while I cooked this, hence the overcooking of the meat in the beginning. I'm sure had I not cooked the meat through before the hour long simmering, the meat would have been so much more tender. My meat was a little tough. My advice: don't overcook the meat and save the wine for dessert! ;-)

This was a very easy and tasty recipe. Simple ingredients that I mostly had on hand. The only substitutes were that I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, chicken stock instead of beef, and white wine vinegar, instead of white wine.  Was very, very good.

I thought this was a terrific recipe for something as banal as "beef stroganoff" - I used a flat-iron steak for the meat - there's no fat on it to trim, just slice n' dice . . .  When browning the meat, I didn't do the "push to the side" thing - just added the green onion and half of a chopped small white onion.  

I substituted a bit of red wine for the liquid amount of the broth, added about a teaspoon of worchestshire sauce and used half sour cream/half cream cheese.  

Using the flat-iron steak speeds up the cooking because it is such a tender cut of meat.  This whole dish can be ready in about 30 minutes that way.

I have honestly never made or had beef stroganoff, but husband really wanted it. I made this with top sirloin and it was awesome! My hubby loved it!! I used yellow onion instead of green b/c I didn't have green and it was very good.

We prefer the taste of red wine to white, and I usually add at least a cup right after browning the meat,l so the flavor soaks in and tenderizes the meat. I also use fresh mushrooms, and allow them to cook the duration of the simmering. 

Substituting for cream cheese for half of the sour cream is de-lish.

I have made this no less than 50 times.  It is the easiest recipe.  I make it just like the recipe says.  I choose to use dijon mustard and vermouth for the white wine and I always double the sauce ingredients to have extra to pour over the noodles.  I just can't say enough good about it!

This recipe is delicious!  I followed the sugestions of others and added garlic, use 2 tbps of cornstarch instead of flour, a dash of rosemary, and added a bit of cream cheese to the sour cream.   Turned out creamy and the meat was great.  I didn't have white wine or the time to marinate, so I added about 2 tbsp of red while the sauce simmered. This was my first time making Stroganoff without the package, and it was fantastic!!  Thanks for a great recipe that is easy to follow.

UBERTASTY!! I made very few adjustments to the original recipe: I subbed a medium yellow onion for the green onion & added minced garlic from a jar (equiv. of 2 cloves). I didn't have "condensed beef broth 10.5 oz can" so I used a 14 oz can of regular old (not-"condensed") beef broth. The recipe never said to drain the fat from the meat (I trimmed most of the fat from the cheap-o chuck roast, but you can never get out ALL that fat) so I didn't have any problems with too little liquids & burning like other reviewers. At about the end it seemed more gravy-ish than creamy so I rather than add more sour cream I tried out the idea of adding 1/3 cup cream cheese. AND WE LOVED IT!!! I hate to give a 5-star review to recipes with many changes, but with we loved this meal so much with just a few changes I had to voice my appreciation!

It had been some time since we've had beef stroganoff, and my husband had a hankering for it.  So, after seeing all of the reviews for this recipe, I decided to give it a whirl.  Instead of roast, I used boneless petite sirloin steaks (they were on sale this week, lol), fresh mushrooms, and omitted the wine altogether.  Result?  AMAZING!

Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

FANTASTIC w/some modifications!  Used Chicken Italian Sausage (which is so good we can't tell the difference-even my husband who is a sausage lover!)  Also used 1/2 yellow onion instead of the green, and added garlic.  Also switched out the beef broth for chicken broth. Other than the ingredient substitutions, followed the directions and served it over egg noodles. Couldn't get enough!!

This was delicious! The first time I made it, I cooked it over the stove per directions, using red wine, fresh onions, fresh garlic and adding some cream cheese, as others had suggested. The second time I used the crockpot, adding in the creamy ingredients for the last hour. We served this over egg noodles, with green beans on the side. My family loved this meal.

This recipe is wonderful. My man loved it. Used sirloin instead of chuck roast. Read the reviews and used those suggestions, 2 cloves garlic, 1 yellow onion, 1 T Worchestershire, fresh mushrooms, cream cheese. Oh, and marinate the meat in wine, that was a great tip. Cooked stroganoff for my first husband years ago, but this is the best stroganoff recipe ever.

This is a great base recipe. I cooked mushrooms (fresh) in one stick of butter (3  packaged sliced mushrooms with one onion) I soaked the meat in white wine with Tastefully Simple Garlic, Tastefully Simple Onion, pepper, garlic salt...The base of my recipe was listed, I just added some things.  Loved cream cheese with sour cream!  Also used cornstarch instead of flour. I cooked the mushrooms and onions together and drained the juice to cook the meat and added mushrooms and onions last.  Doubled the mustard and W sauce to taste.  No brainer here....use the base recipe and add your touch! My visiting relatives were impressed!!

I made a few changes and it turned out fabulous.  I used 1 lb sirloin steak instead of the roast, yellow onion instead of green onions and fresh mushrooms instead of canned. I also added 1 tsp minced garlic. I simmered for 1/2 hr, boiling down the liquid.  Then added sour cream, splash of dry sherry (instead of white wine) prepared mustard and paprika.  This recipe was excellent.!!

This recipe was awesome. I used very thinly sliced sirloin tip and marinated it with cooking sherry and freshly minced garlic. Sauted it in butter and olive oil. Used half of a yellow onion and 2 jumbo portabello mushrooms. I omitted the wine at the end since the beed was marinated with Sherry and I used 1/3 block of reduced fat cream cheese. I also used dijon mustard and a 3 second squirt of ketchup as well as a few dashes of worcester sauce. Served over buttered No Yokes egg noodles, it was absolutely delicious. Even my daughter who is very picky and doesnt like beef or mushrooms ate a second helping! Will definitely be making this again.

GREAT dish!  I've made this several times and modified a little, using sirloin tip sliced very thin which I removed after very brief browning and refrigerated.  I then added some of the steak scraps so the beef flavors would infuse the sauce.  About 10 minutes before serving, removed the scraps and added the refrigerated steak pieces. Then simmer long enough for the beef to heat through and continue with the recipe but with fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  My husband LOVES this dish, the only complaint was he wanted more sauce.  I doubled the sauce ingredients and it turned out great.

I used this recipe because I was unable to find my mother's recipe for Beef Stroganoff, but found this to be almost as good.  The only modifications I made were: 
1) I used sirloin (in lieu of a chuck roast) and sliced the beef significantly smaller.
2) Marinated beef in red wine over night (in lieu of adding white wine at the end)
3) I sauteed fresh mushrooms with the onions (in lieu of adding canned mushrooms at the end)

My husband thought it was fantastic!!

I did change this recipe a little.  I marinated the beef in the white wine.  I used regular onion instead of green onion and fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I also added 2 tsp of minced garlic to the onion when frying.  I also added about 1/2 a cup of cream cheese along with the sour cream.  I think the addition of cream cheese and garlic really made this recipe great.

Very good recipe! I didn't have striploin so I substituted ground beef and it came out very well. I think next time I'd add a little more wine and sour cream. Excellent the next day, too!

Dee-licious.  I substituted fresh mushrooms for those creepy canned guys and tossed in a little garlic and Worcestishire, since I'm manly like that.  A quality stroganoff experience.

This recipe is fantastic.  I made it for my boyfriend for valentines day, following other people's suggestions of marinating the beef beforehand in the wine and adding cream cheese at the end.  I also used a better quality steak and simmered for 15min, rather than an hour, served it over fettucine, and it was an absolute hit.

I was looking for an easy tasty receipe and found it in this one.  The only modification I made was to elminate the wine and at the end I ended up mixing in another tablespoon of flour with some of the broth in the skillet to thicken. A keeper will make it again!

I thought this was great. I browned the meat in extra virgin olive oil, and then removed it from the pan to saute the onions, mushrooms (I used some diced sweet onion, and fresh mushrooms), and some minced garlic. I didn't add the wine (Hubby hates wine), so I added some extra beef broth (about 1/2 a cup).

I gave this 5 stars even though I made a few changes because this is a great base recipe for an excellent, tasty and tender beef stroganoff.  With the beef (I use london broil) I cook it with a splash of red wine, garlic and some worcestershire.  I also only used half the butter.  The only other changes are that I used a yellow onion (I love onion but you really can't tell any is in there!), fresh mushrooms (added with the onions), a beef bouillon cube, and 1/3 cup of cream cheese in addition to the wine (red) and sour cream.  Also, to thicken it up a bit more at the end I added a mixture of another tablespoon of flour and 1/4 cup of milk.  Served on egg noodles.  Perfect!

I added a full block of cream cheese and cut up a venison roast instead of using beef.  It was mighty tasty and I would recommend it for anyone.

This is a great recipe! Adding garlic to the beef saute was a great suggestion. Use double strengh (name brand) beef broth for an extra kick. I also added a few dashed of Worcestershire sauce...definetly a keeper!!

This was a delicious recipe.  I used fresh mushrooms & a 14 oz can of beef broth.  The butcher recommended sliced london broil & I added 2 cloves of garlic when browning the meat.
We will definitely make this again.  It's one of our favorites.
Thank you so much for the yummy recipe

This recipe is SOOOO good! I remember my mom making a similar dish when I was little, but this was my first time making it. Way better than I expected. I followed the recipe exactly except, I didn't have any wine, however, I did use Dijon mustard made with white wine. After the stroganoff was done, I put it over egg noodles w/ a touch of butter & parsley. My entire family loved this dish! My husband said "YUM" with his first bite, second bite, so forth. He actually got seconds! I served it w/ garlic sticks & I will absolutely be making this again, it's officially going in my recipe book. Thanks so much!

This was quick, easy, and VERY good!  I used fresh mushrooms and omitted the wine all together (the stuff I bought turned out to be too fruity).  It was still great.  I will make this again.  Thanks so much for sharing!  Oh and I loved it over egg noodles. YUM!

We really liked this recipe.  My husband doesn't like Stoganoff, but liked this one.  I made some changes to the measurements of the ingredients, but didn't change the actual ingredients except I used real mushrooms.  I also found it easier to remove the beef before cooking the onions and mushrooms.  Great recipe thanks for sharing!

Very good. Next time though Im going to add flour to the sauce closer to the end so that it doesnt stick to the bottom of my pot so much. I am also sure that it would be great even without wine if there is none on hand.

This was pretty good.  No one went nuts over it but everyone liked it.  It really tasted like roast beef with gravy so would be great with mashed potatoes.

This is excellent!!  Growing up, my favorite birthday meal was Beef Stroganoff made lovingly by my dad.  I made this using a previous reviewers suggestion of adding some fresh garlic and Worcestershire sauce.  I also replaced the canned mushrooms with fresh and before serving sprinkled a bit of parsley over the top.  I served it over brown rice.  Thumbs up from husband too!  Thanks!

Was ok. Seemed a little salty. If I make it again I won't add the salt. The salt in the broth is plenty. The flavor reminded me of beef stew. Still looking for a recipe to make my family flip.

Yummy!  Like everyone else I followed the suggestions by BEEZLYS.  Just sort the reviews by most helpful and you'll find it.  I made a few additional changes.  I used small strips of top round, fresh mushrooms and dijon instead of plain yellow mustard.  We are not white wine drinkers but I had a bottle of cabernet that had been open too long to drink and that worked great.  Everybody loved it, including the kids.

Great Recipe!  I did add garlic, fresh mushrooms and marinated the meat for an hour in Emeril's Roasted Vegatable Marinade.  Also followed other reviewers and added some cream cheese and used white onions instead.  Whole family loved it!  Thanks!

Made this following Beezlys modifications. The cream cheese and garlic were definite keepers, but next time will omit the mustard--I couldn't taste anything else but the mustard!

Had some leftover beef tenderloin to use up. My husband made this and didn't put in the green onion or mushrooms (he subbed cream of mushroom soup). He also didn't have beef broth and used the broth from a can of vegetable soup. Turned out pretty well and the kids ate it up.

This dish was pretty good. I made this recipe last night and made some of the changes recommended by BEEZLYS 10/10/2004 and I think it was a mistake. It was a little too much for me. I will definitely make this recipe again but next time will follow it as is.  Thanks Donna.
Update- I made this recipe a second time following the directions exactly as they appeared in the published recipe- much better than my first attempt with the modifications! Thanks again.

Braising the meat prior to making the stroganoff is b rilliant! And delicious.  I don't like the taste of canned 'shrooms so I added these fresh at the end, left out the white wine (fiancee hates "wine-y tasting food) but substituted 1/3 cu more broth.  Is even better the second day (if it isn't devoured the first!)

This recipe was fantastic.

Both my husband and I loved it.  Only a few suggestions:

-Reducing the wine or skipping it completely.  It added some flavor, but the wine taste was a bit too strong. (first time cooking with wine, so maybe I just need to get used to the flavor)

-Also, it's not as saucy when having leftovers the next day, so I'd suggest adding a little more of the beef broth to improve the sauciness, or reserving a bit of the sauce to mix in the next day.

I would make this again.  It was very easy to make, and the results were delicious.  Thank you for submitting this recipe.

Oh Donna, you have out done yourself! I am making this tonight for dinner, and my kitchen smells heavenly! I omitted the salt, but added 2 cloves of garlic to the meat while it was cooking. There was too much in the pan to push the meat to one side, so I added the onions to the meat. I mixed 5 T flour to 1 can of beef broth and added to pan after meat was brown. Then I added one more can of beef broth, and one can golden mushroom soup instead of fresh mushrooms. (My kids won't eat mushrooms if they can see them!) I added some ground mustard along with the prepared yellow mustard. I also added one plus cups of white wine at the same time as the soups.
I can't stop having chef's samples! I hope I can control myself and leave some sauce to add the sour cream to! This would make a great beef stew recipe minus the sour cream and adding veggies. THANKS Donna, sooo much for sharing this!

Another five star review...

I have saved this on my computer, and titled it 'Perfect Beef Stroganoff'.  I am a really bad cook, and honestly if I cannot mess this up, it is impossible to ruin it.  I took other suggestions and used about a quarter cup of white onion instead of green, and I did add a clove of garlic.  Also, I could not find the condensed beef soup, so I just simmered 2 cans of beef broth for about half an hour to reduce, and it worked really well.  It did take a lot of time and effort, but really it was beyond worth it.  I really appreciate your sharing this recipe.

This is really a great recipe, the sauce has amazing flavor and the meat comes out very tender.  My only change was I blended some cornstarch & worchestshire in a bowl, then added to the sauce to thicken it up a little more.  Wonderful recipe - will make again!

This is a great dish. I used a two pound tri tip and doubled the sour cream and wine. Fantastic.

I liked this a lot and loved having another use for chuck roast.  I added a can of beef  mushroom soup and can of water to make more sauce and it was enjoyed by all.

This was great! I am excited once again to find a "classic" recipe that is simple to make and tastes so good. I used tenderized round steak , which made it very tender, but that was the only change.

This was good, however I think i liked the flavor more before I added the wine and sour ceam.  The beginning of this recipe makes a GREAT gravy.  I will now be using this recipe for gravy.  Next time i make this i will add only a little sour cream and wine.  I thought it was a little over-powering. Thanks for sharing.

This sauce was so excellent!  I made the dish with leftover pork roast and the meat was just okay.  I can't wait to try this recipe again (and I will!) with the chuck roast sitting in my freezer.  I added an extra can of mushrooms, more beef broth and more mustard (dijon)and sour cream.  Also used some much needed garlic!  Thanks for submitting this awesome recipe!

This is a definate keeper, Donna. My family enjoyed this so much. I added a bit more Dijon mustard and a bit more sour cream. The addition of the white wine just makes this dish. DELICIOUS. And the meat was tender and moist. I served with mashed potatoes and green beans. Now my family wants more, more, more!

I used sirloin tip roast and it was AWESOME!  The only time consuming part was cutting up the meat and getting the fat pieces out.  Made a great birthday dinner for my Mom.

This is the first time I've ever eaten Beef Stroganoff - my husband had requested it for dinner and I was simply amazed!  It was delicious and very easy to make.  I used a pressure cooker (13 minutes) and the beef tenderloin tips were very tender and flavorful.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  Next time, I'll use less sour cream (it was too much for my taste) and thicken with cornstarch/water.

Very good flavor- i did add half white wine and half sherry.  Should've cut my meat in smaller pieces, but otherwise very good flavor.  My two toddler boys especially loved it!

It made this recipe quick & easier using leftover steak.  I only used 1/4 stick butter to fry onions, then mixed flour into broth & added that to pan.  I added 1/4t nutmeg w/ mustard.  I added frozen peas to the noodles 5 mins before they were done.

Wow, that was great! We're still basking in the afterglow of Mmmmm. I used shallots and garlic instead of the onions and used more sour cream (I like sour cream :). I also pared down the preparation time by using leftover london broil. My 6 yr old was nonplussed but we loved it!!

Excellent recipe!  The use of white wine and mustard add unique flavors.  This is a good meal to have after a hard day out in the rain.  It's full of goodness.  Also, the fat can be cut down by using non-fat sourcream and less butter.

GREAT RECIPE!! thank you for sharing! Next time I’ll simmer the meat longer to break it down to be fork tender but that’s the only thing I’ll do different. I did take a hint from another reviewer and remove the meat while mixing the flour and used yellow onions instead of green onions. Hubby LOVED it!

This recipe is great!!. However, my lazy version is just as good! I use ground beef instead of beef strips. Add 1/4cup cream cheese along with the sour cream. I Also add green onion into the mixture near the end and garnish with some fresh green onion to serve. Delicious!!

We loved this! Its almost identical to my moms receipt. This is so simple and fairly quick to make. I added a little fresh parsley and a touch more sour cream then what was called for. This has become our new family favorite ! Will be making this on a regular rotation now!

I like how this recipe doesn’t require canned creams, yet still saucy! I took a reviewers advice and marinated the beef in white wine for an hour (meanwhile making braised cabbage hehe) and sautéed the mushroom with the beef.

I honestly forgot the mustard but it’s just amazing so rich and creamy. The flavors mesh so well. Best stroganoff I’ve ever had or made

This is outstanding.  I do recommend marinating the meat in red wine. The meat comes out extra tender and flavorful. This has become a family favourite and is better than any restaurant stroganoff I have ever had. I served it on top of egg noodles and sprinkled some green onion on top. Looks and tastes great!

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, except for leaving out the white wine, and it came out perfect. The meat was so tender and the gravy has great flavor. The whole family loved it.

It was very good but I substituted regular mushrooms instead of canned ones.  I sautéed them in butter with salt and pepper and threw them in at the same time it recommended.

I have made this recipe at least a dozen times. It is really delicious. The only change I made was to include an additional 1/2 - 1  can of water to the beef broth. This increases the volume of sauce.  You need to be careful however during simmer time to stir the sauce in order to prevent sticking. Pour over broad egg noodles.  This is a crowd pleaser!

I added sliced crimini mushrooms, 1 tsp. Worchester sauce, 1 garlic clove  and 1/3 cup cream cheese.  I also used corn starch as a thickener.  I sautéed onions and mushrooms together, added wine  then added everything to beef and simmered for an hour.  It was delicious

Possibly my favorite recipe ever. I'm also pretty sure my husband decided to propose after I made him this. Instead of white wine at the end, I like to let the beef marinate in a petite Syrah and I use fresh mushrooms. It's taken me five years to review, but try this. It's ridiculously good.

I made no changes and will definitely make it again.  Usually I dislike recipes which have waiting periods in them but am having medical issues which preclude standing for very long and this recipe was perfect. Tastes terrific also.

Asked the butcher at While Foods for Beef Chuck without the gristle. I've made this recipe with other cuts but Chuck is absolutely the best. Is tender without marinading.  Love Stroganoff but have always thought it a bit bland. Onion, garlic and Dijon mustard add a bit of zing! I sliced 1/2 large sweet onion and sauteed it in butter instead of the green onion. Added the strips of beef with 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic and the S&P. Once cooked through I added a box of fresh Shitake mushrooms. Happened to have them on hand and ended up loving the chewy texture and flavor.  Covered with Swansons Beef Broth - 2 cups. Simmered covered on LOW for 1 hour.  Added 2 splashes ( about 1/8 cup) good red wine and 1 tablespoon of Meile's Dijon mustard. Let those flavors meld while I made wide egg noodles (10 min). Stirred in the sour cream and whipped cream cheese at the end allowing it to come to a bubble. The sauce was thick enough so no need for the flour. Next time I'll try adding  button mushrooms at the end and garnishing with the green onion.  
This is a good recipe. I just prefer fresh ingredients when I can get them.

This is very good. As per reviews, I marinated meat in red wine for at least an hour. Sautéed 16oz of fresh mushrooms w some butter, thyme, salt and pepper til they shrunk to almost 2 cups. Set aside. Browned marinated meat in same pan. Set aside. Cooked whole yellow onion w garlic in same pan. Mixed in flour & broth and combined all. Simmered for over an hour. 1/3 cup sour cream & 1/3 cup cream cheese in last 5 minutes. Delicious!

This is a wonderful savory version of Stroganoff that we much prefer to the sweeter versions.  In our opinion, adding cream cheese really detracts from the savory flavor- the sour cream (we use plain greek yogurt) is the perfect creamy element.  Some other tips we found helpful:  (1) Marinate the meat in red or white wine for 1-2 hrs in the fridge prior to cooking. This adds a really nice flavor to the beef and tenderizes the meat, and you can skip the addition of the wine at the end as this can thin out the sauce. (2) Use 1 medium yellow onion (sliced or chopped) and use the green onions for garnish instead. (3) Garlic is a must (we use 4 cloves)! (4) Corn starch works just as well as flour or you can also use 2 tbsp of each. I found it easier to dissolve them in a few tbsp of beef broth before adding it to the skillet otherwise it's really difficult to dissolve flour/corn starch in the sauce. (5) Add 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce along with the prepared mustard. (I use fresh mushrooms and simmer with the beef instead of at the end of cook time. Fresh sliced mushrooms (8 oz) work well also.  TIP: found it VERY difficult to push aside the browned meat and then cook the onions and add the flour to the skillet the first few times I made this. Instead, I now remove the browned meat to a plate, cook the onion by itself, and then return the meat back to the pan and add broth with dissolved flour/starch.

I have to disagree with people who say if you make changes, you should write a new recipe and not rate/review this recipe.  If they wrote new recipes, people like me might never see them.  I only look at recipes that have hundreds of reviews, then I look at the reviews and read people’s suggestions/changes.  A NEW recipe with all the changes incorporated might be awesome, but if only a few people review it, it won’t get the same exposure.  

Having said that, I followed the suggestions by user BeezlyS.  Marinated beef in wine (I used white), diced up a small yellow onion, dissolved flour in the beef broth, added minced garlic,  1 teaspoon of Worcestershire, 8oz fresh sliced mushrooms.  After an hour of simmering, I added 1/3 cup cream cheese with the 1/3 cup sour cream.  I did not put in additional wine at the end, I actually had to add more flour to thicken it.  I also sprinkled some garlic salt with additional salt and pepper.  Turned out great, even tastier the next day.

Followed recipe exactly except added garlic. It was good, but could be better. I didn't read the other reviews, but next time I will take their advice and make a few changes which would make this amazing I think. I would definitely marinate the meat in wine, adding it at the end made the consistency too runny. I would mix the flour with a little beef stock before throwing it in the pan. Oh I also put fresh mushrooms in while it was simmering, they really needed the cooking time. Putting it in directly made a bit of a clumpy mess. Those small changes would make a big difference!

Really good flavours but need a few tweaks. Would fry fresh mushroom in some reserved butter next time.  The mustard gave it an interesting flavour but not sure if I would step a little outside of the prepared mustard that goes on hamburgers and hot dogs.  Will have to think on that one.  Everyone did enjoy the meal so definitely worth doing it again

Made as written, and the sauce came out thin and very bland. I had to add Worscestire sauce before serving to try to help the blandness. Will not make again.

We aren't big fans of stroganoff but we both liked this. I always look through the reviews before I try a recipe. I took the advice of others and marinated in white wine, added garlic and worcestershire  although I still added wine at the end.  Very tasty, we want to try this with meatballs next. Thanks Donna for a simple but delicious addition to our recipe box.

I followed the recipe.  My chef's pan made it easy to move the beef and onions to the side. This dish is exceptional. I used egg noodles to go with it.  Thanks Donna!

What a stunner! I love beef stroganoff, and this was perfection. The only changes I made were to use the whole green onions instead of just the whites, and I subbed in fresh sliced baby Bella mushrooms for the canned. I had to force myself not to lick the plate clean!

Tried it for the first time this evening and it was absolutely delicious.  The only thing I changed was the white wine as I didn't have any on hand.  Used White Zinfandel instead and it turned out perfect.  The whole family loves it and I will definitely be making it again.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I love this website and is the only one I use for my searches.  GO BRUINS.!!!!

This was delicious! I think next time I will marinate the meat in the white wine first, because the sauce wasn't as thick as I wanted.

This Beef Stroganoff is so good. Not that much work. It just needs a little bit of time for simmering.  I used fresh mushrooms and simmer for 1.5 hours.  So good.

We liked it. I'll definitely make it again but next time I'll either marinate it over night or use a different cut if beef, and I should have let the meat come to room temperature first. It was tender but a little bland. Sauce was really yummy.

Made this recipe with the changes recommended by BEEZLYS, and it was wonderful! I marinated our venison chunks in wine and then cooked it according to the recipe, with the addition of garlic and cream cheese.  It was absolutely the best stroganoff I have ever had.  Thank you for giving us another recipe to add to the rotation!

Yummy!!! I had to make a few changes because I forgot/did not have a few things. I used cube steak, used a little bit of yellow onion, and beef consumme . I will make this again but i will not use 4oz of butter.  I could not get the butter to blend with everything. I may have done something wrong but 4oz of butter is far too much. I also added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce. I served it over egg noodles. The favor was wonderful, however it looked odd before going over the noodles. Also, I used chicken stock instead of wine. Def will make a good. Gave it 4 stars due to the butter.

I followed BEEZLYS's suggestions and it was great. My husband said keep this recipe and throw out Paula Deen's. Sauce was creamy and flavourful. I used sirloin steak and no onions. (My huband can not do onions). It was still great.

This was very good. I followed the recipe as is but next time may make a couple changes - add some extra garlic, mustard, Worcestershire sauce and may try sherry instead of white wine to add that extra dimension that seems to be missing. Definitely worth making though!

I substituted a can of Campbell's french onion  soup for  the beef broth for extra flavor. Then added a can of Campbell's beef consume so we could have extra  sauce. The combination  of french onion and consume is perfect.  That makes the  right amount for our family of 5 with a little left for left overs. My  family loved it and asks for it all of the time!

Ok, let's say this tastes pretty good, but i think I need to doctor this to do a couple things differently next time.  The amount of butter...OY!  I had heartburn all night.  That has to go.  Secondly, I think there are loads of better options over Campbell's condensed beef broth.  I would also use a better cut of meat next time.  The chuck roast was so chewy.

I give it 5 stars - made as is. It is an incredibly easy and delicious recipe. The second time I made it I marinaded the beef in the wine before hand [with minced garlic and worsteshire sauce], instead of adding it at the end and I used fresh mushrooms. Either way it is a winner and a new favorite in our home.

This is so good!  My family loved it.  I followed the recipe except for adding worcestershire sauce and deleting the wine.  I'm sure it would be even better with garlic, cream cheese, etc. that other reviewers mentioned.

Awesome! I did tweak it a bit. I used a yellow onion instead of green onions, I also added in two cloves of garlic while sautéing the onions, used the white wine to deglaze the pan instead of at the end and added in some worchestershire sauce with the mustard.  Also used sliced, fresh cremini mushrooms and added them in with the beef.  Oh...and finished it with a hit of fresh parsley.

This is a great recipe,but...I make a chicken liver stroganoff.  I was caregiver for a great lay for almost ten years who gave me the recipe which is identical to this except you cut up the chicken livers in half and use those instead of the beef.  We ate this almost weekly when I could find livers.

My husband had requested for me to make some beef stroganoff and I came across this recipe. I made it just as written except I used sautéed mushrooms instead of canned. It was awesome. It had so much flavor. Will definitely make again.

Used red wine because that's all I had handy. Was good but white would've been better. This is a keeper!

I used fresh mushrooms,  added garlic to those and the beef. Entirely too bland for us.

Marinated sirloin strips in 1/2 cup red wine all day.  Did everything else the same, except adding white wine at end.  Awesome!!

My fiance and I absolutely loved this!! Used some other reviewers' suggestions as follows. 1) Used a yellow onion instead of green 2) Used 2 tbsp of cornstarch instead of flour 3) Added 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce along with the prepared mustard 4) Used 1/3 cup of sour cream AND 1/3 cup of cream cheese.  I also used fresh mushrooms that I sauteed and added at the end with the sour cream/cream cheese.  This recipe will DEFINITELY be made again!!!

Nice recipe, marsala, cooking wine is also a good alternative to white wine. Fresh Basil and oregano goes well also.

Very good. I omitted the mustard and used fresh mushrooms which I sauteed with the onions and them added to the browned beef. Also used red wine because I didn't have white. Otherwise followed the recipe as written. I'll definitely make this again!!

Perfect! Just the recipe I was looking for. I used organic broth and then reduced it with the wine and onions and made my "gravy" from that. Super good! I also cooked my beef down with the crock pot because I had to work today and it was just easier. Thanks for the recipe!

My family ate every single bite!!  I used a sirloin tip steak instead of chuck to cut back on the fat.  I cooked on a low simmer for 2 hours and the meat was so tender.  Will definitely add this to my favorites!!

Simple and delicious! Followed as written with only two minor changes: I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and a yellow onion sliced thinly instead of the green onion. I served the Stroganoff over wide noodles with a side of broccoli.  I will definitely be making this again.

Awesome Recipe.  Have made it for my family twice and the loved it both times asking when I will be making it again!  Only changes I made was using yellow onion instead of green onion, 1 tbsp beef bouillon and used fresh baby port mushrooms. Oh and I used beef sirloin instead of chuck roast.  the meat seems to be so much more tender and doesn't take an hour of simmering to get the meat perfect.

I tried this recipe but I did change a couple of things. I used a package of extra lean ground beef and fresh mushrooms instead. It turned out great. It is now on the "I will make this again" list.

I am a vegetarian, but made this for my husband. He said he would give it a 4.5 star rating. I followed it close enough to rate it. I used stew meat as that is all I had on hand. I also used fresh mushrooms and cooked them with the onions. Sorry, but after going through all that trouble to make stroganoff from scratch, I can't fathom using canned mushrooms. I never buy them. I also use bouillon instead of condensed beef broth, as I never buy that either.  This recipe smelled awesome as I was cooking it. Like others, I chose to remove the meat, onions and in my case mushrooms before adding the flour and broth. Next time I would actually just use one to two TB of butter to brown the meat and then add the rest of the butter after taking the meat out of the pan. My husband was impressed and said this would be a good recipe for company. Thanks for sharing.

This was an easy recipe, but I felt it really lacked flavor.  Maybe some chopped garlic would do the trick.

This was very tasty and had great flavor, but the meat was a little dry.  I will probably marinate it before cooking next time, and I may try slow-cooking the meat.

I also put the wine in at the same time as the broth, added the mushrooms right away,added the garlic minced and some other spices (seasoning salt, chilli powder salt and pepper) I also used all corn starch. Turned out delicious! :)

Made this for dinner tonight. It was delicious. Only changes I made were using sirloin instead of chuck roast and omiting the wine. Very simple to make, yet company worthy. This will be added to our dinner rotation.

I love this basic receipe, I also followed the advice of others (1) marinate the meat in either a red or white wine for 1-2 hrs. in fridge in a zip lock bag prior to cooking (skip wine at the end as it is the sauce) (2) Use 1 medium yellow onion instead of the green onions (3) Garlic is a must sauteed (4) Used cornstarch and added to cooled beef broth before adding to skillet)(I used Better than Buillon Beef)(5) Added 1 tbsp. worcestershire sauce with prepared mustard (6)I sauteed fresh sliced portabella mushrooms, thinly sliced onions, garlic and sliced red pepper. (7) plated the meat and then added back to mushrooms,onions, garlic, etc. (8) added 1/3 cup of both the sour cream and cream cheese ten minutes before serving.  I do this in my 5 qt. cast iron casserole on my cook top.  I also use this with chicken breasts substituting with Chicken better than bullion.  Very Very Yummy...serve with either rice or noodles

This dish was well received!  I planned an Easter brunch menu for a  client and included this recipe because her husband is more of a simple meat-n-potatoes man and would not appreciate the other menu selections we planned. We did a test run and the only change I made was sirloin as opposed to the chuck.  Accessible ingredients, simple prep, and a great result...my kind of dish and outcome.

Really good flavor on this.  We marinated the beef in the wine with a dash of worcestershire while preparing the mushrooms and onions.  First sautéed fresh, sliced mushrooms in 1T butter, then removed those from the pan and added another 1T butter with the drained beef to begin browning before adding the small, diced yellow onion and 2 cloves of garlic.  Added the 1/4C flour, along with about a 1/4t each of thyme, parsley and marojam, with a few dashes of rosemary.  Cooked that for a minute or two before adding in the wine used for marinating, the mustard and 1 1/4C water.  The flavor was still great just using water instead of beef broth, but using broth would definitely make for a strong flavor.  We did have to add extra water while the beef was cooking and stir about every 10-15 minutes to prevent it from burning down, even on very low heat.  Mixed in the sour cream and mushrooms at the end and had a great meal over noodles.

I have been known to lick the plate afterwards.  Yummy.  It is our favorite dish.  We followed " Beezlys" recommendations.

I was hungry for a beef stroganoff similar to what my Mom used to make. I came across this allrecipe.com website and found this recipe similar to hers, so I went over to their house and cooked it for her and my Dad, we really enjoyed it, just didn't make enough for seconds. Next time!

I've been struggling with a good recipe for beef stroganoff forever...This one finally worked! It was absolutely perfect! I did everything pretty much exactly the way the recipe called for, except I used sirloin tips that I cut into 1 inch cubes, and let them soak in a bit of red wine for a while before searing in the pan and I also added garlic. This is absolutely delicious! I will certainly be repeating this recipe over and over!

I thought this was an easy, tasty recipe.  I followed most of the recipe, with these few changes.  After reading reviews, I marinated in red wine first.  I actually used filet mignon sliced thin (was on sale at the market!).  I sautéed the beef quickly, took out, the sautéed the onions, fresh mushrooms, and the garlic.  I then deglazed the pan with some red wine.  I then added the beef broth, brought to a boil, turned to a simmer, then added the beef.  After an hour, I added the sour cream, along with some minced fresh parsley.  Served over egg noodles.  Both my husband and I enjoyed it.  The leftovers were tasty too!

This is a great dish.  I make it the same as most of the modifications made by other users.  I prefer without the cream cheese, but that is just a matter of taste.  I tend to use more broth and less flour/cornstarch as this tends to turn to paste with only 10.5 oz of broth.  I keep adding broth/stock as it simmers to maintain the consistency that I prefer and end up probably using 16 oz or more and still get a very hearty thick sauce.  Marinating in red wine and Worcestershire sauce is definitely a must.

This was super easy to make and will make it again with a few changes: use half the amount of sour cream as it gave an overpowering taste, add green peas, use a regular onion in addition to the green onions, three cloves of garlic chopped and more mushrooms (fresh). Thanks for sharing!

My first beef stroganoff and I have to say pretty good.  I usually read reviews first but I didn't have time so my meat did not come out as tender.  I halved the recipe.  I used already cut up beef stew meat, next time I'll marinate it like another reviewer for 2 hours in red wine, worcestershire, and minced garlic.  I did add a little bouquet gravy.  Will make again.

I read several reviews before executing this recipe.  I learned that this recipe is so good that you can vary it, depending on what you have on hand, and STILL have a great result!!  Can't ask for anything more than that, can you?  I used what I had on hand: rib-eye steak, red onion, added garlic, added sherry when I added the broth (I like alcohol to cook off, and add to flavor, not overtake the dish), had no mushrooms, nor sour cream.  However, I had a little bit of Lipton's Onion Dip made w/sour cream & the soup mix, so I added that.  Used Wondra, so had no problem with lumps.  And I had limited time to prepare, so stroganoff only simmered for about 20 min.  Everyone loved it!  I cut back a bit on butter-- 5T vs 8T, and added a bit more liquid, cuz I wanted more sauce.  And finally, I served it over Linguini, cuz that's all I had.  Don't be afraid to improvise according to your taste and what you have in the pantry!

A Classic Recipe, Well written and easy to follow. I used a different cut of meat,Sirlon. This is the recipe I choose to give my granddaughter her first cooking lesson. Everyone in the family loved it and the "newest cook" was walking on cloud nine.

I have never cooked stroganoff before and it was absolutely delicious.  My husband said it was the best he had ever eaten.  I made a couple of changes: I did marinate the meat for 2 hours in red wine, worcestershire, and minced garlic.   Then I added all ingredients and let simmer for an hour.  Then I added the sour cream and cream cheese about 15 minutes before serving. Served over egg noodles -- YUM!

This is my new go-to recipe for beef stroganoff. I have used it with a london broil cut (cheaper) sliced against the grain and also used ground beef. The sauce is what makes this recipe. My family loves it!

This has become one of my favorite "go to" recipes. The wonderful smells my family gets upon walking in the door for dinner makes them anxious to eat. I've even cooked it while on a boat delivery across the Atlantic. The crew was thrilled!

I was trying to make dinner with what I had on hand and I stumbled upon this recipe.  I had one pound of ground beef that I substituted for the chuck roast.  I used one medium onion chopped instead of the green onions, 3 large cloves of fresh garlic and close to 3/4 pound of fresh sliced mushrooms instead of canned mushrooms.  It turned out great.  I will try it again with a chuck roast or London broil, but it was really good with the ground beef. Served it with fresh steamed string beans.

This is a great recipe. The only changes I made were to use fresh mushrooms, add Worcestershire sauce, and skip the wine. My husband loved it! I will be making this again!

This had great flavor but I would cook it a little differently next time, thus the 4 stars.  I would cook my beef separately from everything else because the sauce that it simmered in all but cooked off.  It even burned a little in some spots at the bottom of the pan.  I had to keep adding broth to it.  Next time I will simmer the beef for a couple of hours in some beef broth.  Simmering for only an hour didn't leave the meat tender enough to my liking.  The only things I did differently was to use fresh mushrooms (can't bring myself to eat the canned ones) and omit the onions.  I really liked the flavor of the sauce.  The white wine gives it that yummy kick that beef stroganoff should have.

I have made this recipe twice now and I just love it! My husband, who wouldn't even touch stroganoff before, annihilates this dish! The first time I made it I made it exactly to the recipe and it was so darn good! The second time (tonight actually) I made it with fresh mushrooms instead of tinned (only because I didn't have a tin on hand) and I let it simmer for 4 hours. Oh my dear goodness was it amazing! This is forever more in my repertoire! Thanks for an amazing recipe!

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could! I followed some reviewers tips and marinated the meat in red wine while I was preparing the other ingredients. I used fresh mushrooms and cooked them along with the onions. I also added some fresh thyme. I poured the wine and cooking liquid from the meat back in with the broth to make the sauce. I also used more broth than called for, as it evaporated slowly as it cooked. I think I simmered for 1 hour. I used dijon for my mustard and cornstarch to thicken. I have made many beef stroganoffs and this was by far the best. Definitely a keeper.

Made this for dinner tonight and it was a big hit and so easy. The only thing I changed is I omitted the onions as my family does not like them. Used garlic instead. Will keep this recipe handy!

Wanted to try this because it didn't have "cream of" soup in it.  FLEXIBLE recipe!!  Not sure what cut of meat I had - sliced into appropriate size..   Marinated in 3T Worcestershire sauce, omitted butter, used yellow onions because they were on hand.  Didn't have beef broth - just added water and let the meat simmer a bit.  Used dried mushrooms.   Will definitely make again - EZ - Wonderful taste!

I followed the recipe almost exactly.  The only difference I made was to braise the meat in broth for 45 minutes until it was tender, then I added it to the rest of the sauce after I had thickened it with flour.  I didnt want to have to stand over the stove stirring a thickened sauce for 45 min.  I thought this was very good.  It was definitely not the normal beefy flavor that Im used to with beef stroganoff  with the white wine and mustard but it was very good.

I did not care for this recipe. 

Only thing I did differently to this recipe was use yellow onion instead of green..... learning mistake. 
I could totally taste the wine.  Like eating wine noodle soup with chunks.

I made this with fresh mushrooms and did like others by marinating the meat in burgandy wine for 2 hours. I also used half cream cheese and sour cream. This was excellent. Meat could have soften for a little longer though.

Used ground beef which probably not as good but my family loved it anyways!! The sauce was awesome even though I didn't have white Wine, and I added 1 1/2 table spoons of heavy cream along with the sour cream.

Marinated beef in red wine, omitted white wine. Used 2 TBS cornstarch and 2 TBS flour instead of 4 TBS flour. Browned beef, than removed from pan to cook onions and garlic, then stirred in broth and flour/cornstarch, added beef back in. Used fresh mushrooms and let them simmer with the beef. Added cream cheese at the end.

I used 1 1/2 lbs of sirlion and it was super tender. I used yellow onion and some leek just out of preference, and added a splash of worsteshire and omitted the white wine since i didnt have any. I dissolved 2 tablespoons of flour and 2 tablespoons of cornstarch in a 14 oz can of beef broth instead of all flour. Turned out good.also used 8 oz fresh mushrooms instead of canned.

Unaltered this is a fantastic recipe.  I harvest wild mushrooms and had some dried ones on hand.  I rehydrated them in hot water being careful to make sure I'd have at least 10 oz of "mushroom water" left over.  I removed the rehydrated mushrooms and added beef bullion to the mushroom water and used that in place of beef broth.  OUT OF THIS WORLD!  Also, because dried mushrooms tend to remain a bit tough, I added them to the mixture at the beginning of the simmer to get them extra cook time.  To up the creaminess you can also add 4 oz of cream cheese.

Amazing, I would never have expected this to be so popular with my finicky family.  Aside from substituting Elk cut into the 1/4 x 2 inch strips, marinated for 1 hour in a 4/1 water-balsamic vinegar, 1T sugar, dried thyme, bay leaf mixture I would not dare change anything.   Mustard who would EVER have thought that could make such a tasty difference.  Thanks Donna, your recipe has helped me immeasurably.

Fairly tasty and easy to prep.  Gravy could be thicker.  Did not add white wine, but did marinate meat in red wine as others have mentioned.  Good advice.

I wanted to add something new to our weekly menu & with all the great reviews I figured this would be then one to try.  Needless to say it's deserving of it's high marks.  My wife & kids sometimes are picky eaters and everyone loved it!  If your looking for a Stroganoff to try this is a great choice.  Give it a go!

The flavor of this dish was spot on. I only gave it 4 stars because I had to use almost 2 1/2 times the beef broth to keep it from running dry while simmering. I will definatly use this recipe as a starting point again.

took what I had and used this recipe as a guide:  no chuck, so used ground chuck; no beef broth so I used 1 can Golden Mushroom soup (not diluted); added 1 heaping tbsp minced garlic (the refrigerated kind) and next time I'll use more; used 1 regular onion instead of the green onions; no flour or other thickeners (didn't seem to need it); and closer to a cup and a half of sour cream. I forgot the mustard, but I didn't miss it.  I give 4.5 stars, but since AllRecipes won't let me, I rounded up.

This turned out really nicely. I did marinate the beef in wine and garlic overnight and the gravy turned out very tasty. I added some dill to brighten it up a little and it was great.

You had me at mustard!! Used half of a 4lb chuck roast (saving the other half for a future pot roast). Was so hungry by the time it was done and it was sooooo good! This is my favorite Stroganoff so far.

I really liked this recipe, even my picky eater husband said it was good. The only thing different I did was but back on the sour cream and I didn't used white wine since I didn't have any. I made egg noodles to go along with it. Will def. make this again.

This was pretty good, but I've definitely had better. I think all of the basics are right in this recipe, but it was quite greasy and needed a little extra something to give it more "oomph."

Here are my changes: used fresh mushroom...always.  Canned mushrooms taste wierd.  One med/large onion. Instead of 4onces butter I used half butter half olive oil when browning meat bc it doesn't burn as quickly.  Must marinade meet with wine.  Dont add in the end gets too watery.  By doing this it adds so much flavor too meat.  When you add the onion it tastes so much better when you add some fresh garlic as well.  In the end, add about 1/3 C cream cheese(helps thickens too).

This recipe is amazing!!! I was a skeptic
with the mustard at first, then I added it and it is definitely needed. Everyone ate it up. This was added to my cookbook as soon as cleanup was over.

Really good. The hardest part was cutting up the meat. Next time, I will be purchasing stew meat already cut up. I also will try fresh mushrooms, garlic and a little bit of cayenne....My family likes spicy. This recipe was good prepared as instructed, but I would like to shake it up a bit : )
I did serve it on pasta (bowties) and it really filled out the meal.


Cooked again- this time I added more mustard, used stew meat (which i cut away the fat and gristle) and I added cayenne pepper. We loved it.

I loved this. I used some ground beef, since I found that quicker and easier. (Cheaper too!) Along with the white wine, and used a little splash of white wine vinegar, which really enhanced the flavor. Perfect as is though too!

This was an awesome recipe.  I vegetarianized it by using two bags of Morningstar crumbles in lieu of the chuck roast.  I also used veggie broth instead of beef broth (I think it would have been even better with mushroom broth but I couldn't find it at the store).  Leftovers were fantastic.  I'm getting a deep freezer later this month, and I think this recipe will freeze beautifully.  I plan to make it along with some rice and put it in some Ziplock Vacuum Seal bags in individual serving sizes.

I made this exactly as is, and found that there is just too much butter. 4 ounces of butter is one whole stick. Still, everyone loved it, especially the guys. I will make it again and use fresh mushrooms and yellow onions and definitely reduce the amount of butter. The chuck was nice and tender, melt in your mouth delicious. My local store carries something called "petite tender steaks" which are simply trimmed chuck steaks which makes this recipe a lot easier to prepare. Chuck does have good flavor and the long simmer does the trick.

Wonderful!  I soaked the meat in red wine for a few hours.  Cutting and marinating the meat ahead of time saved time in the evening.  I used a pressure cooker for 15 minutes before adding mushrooms/sour cream to speed things up.

YUM!! I used fresh mushrooms and only had vermouth for the wine. I added the 'shrooms while the noodles were cooking and then added the sour cream and wine. Husband loved it as well. Thanks for a super easy Stroganoff recipe. Think I give cooking it in a pressure cooker a try as well.

I don't really know what beef stroganoff is supposed to taste like, but I thought this was decent.  Not a very complex dish insofar as taste, yet good.  Did a few things slightly differently, but good base.

John D thought it was "the real deal". I haven't eaten Stroganoff enough to know, but I thought it was pretty good. I can take it or leave it. It's fattening!

Fresh sliced mushrooms because canned are horrible.  This was kind of bland in my opinion.  Just seems to missing something.  Might be that little sour bite but even after adding more sour cream I didn't get that taste I wanted.  Thanks for submitting and I will try again and add something to get that bite that is missing.  I might try the rice you suggest for something different.

This recipe was fabulous! I didn't cook the beef for 1 whole hour. Maybe 30 minutes. I was worried it would dry out too much. I also used fresh mushrooms, which I sauteed while I was browning the beef. I dislike canned mushrooms.

We made this tonight and it was really tastey.  I followed many of the suggestions that I had seen in others comments, I added Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and half of a sweet onion instead of the green onions.  I also added a big scoop of the new cooking cream (like cream cheese) along with the sour cream at the end.  I also chopped up the mushrooms (just a personal preference to have lots of smaller bits throughout the dish).  It was great, we served it on egg noodles.  I would definitely make this again.

This was absolutely delicious! I have a wonderful market nearby that sells stir fry beef strips so this couldn't have been easier and I sauteed fresh mushrooms instead of using canned.  My husband was late getting home and I forgot to add the sour cream and wine... didn't matter one bit.  This recipe is a keeper!!

I have made this recipe a few times, and it is simply amazing! Per other reader's suggestions I add cream cheese to my stroganoff. I also use stew meat, and yellow onions instead of green. Overall, you will not regret making this, it is definitely a trusty go-to recipe  for our family!

My family didn't care for this recipe. Hubby said the sauce was way too runny, teen son hated the sour cream/cream cheese flavor. I'm going to use this as a base, revise it for us and try again.

I have been searching for the best stroganoff recipe for a long time. When I found this one, I stopped looking. Just the best ever. I substitute sirloin tip for the chuck roast sometimes, but it's all good.

This was delicious—even better the next day as leftovers. I followed BEEZLYS advice. Besides that, the only thing I did different was use fresh mushrooms and make my own mustard, using about 3/4 of a tablespoon—had a little more zip to it.

This was great & my son the picky eater really liked it. I did add an extra 2 cups of water and one cup of beef broth, so then I was able to add my 2 1/2 cups of noodles in the beef mixture & cook until tender. Also used fresh mushrooms (chopped). We didn't have any chuck roast so I used about 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef. I was so pleased to find a healthy version of Beef Stroganoff one without using the cream soups.

Excellent. Very easy. Made it exactly as written and it was perfect in every way. The best stroganoff ever. Hint: what makes it different is using chuck roast and adding that little bit of mustard.

This is an amazing recipe I altered a couple of things due to what I had to work with and to lower some of the fat content. I substituted the sour cream for fat free plain yogurt and its absolutely delicious

Tastes just like my mother used to make... I didn't follow the recipe exactly, I was out of prepared mustard but it didn't ruin it. Also I used a white moscato wine which I was quite unsure but it all worked out really well. It will be put into my rotation!

OMG, this is such a great base recipe!  I actually changed it up a bit only because Trader Joes didn't have all the ingredients, but it was SO delicious.  I too  added cream cheese in addition to sour cream, I substituted in hamburger meat because it looked best at the store, I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and just added them after the onion, I tossed in some garlic, and dropped out the wine because all I had was a super oaky red, but added Worcestershire Sauce instead.  Well, I guess I did make a lot of changes.  Regardless, I used the same cooking process and it was delicious!  I look forward to making this again following the original recipe to see which is best.

I really loved the flavor of this!  I used ground turkey bc I needed to use some up.  Used vidalia onions bc that's all I had.  Added some garlic when I was sauteeing the onions.  I cut back on the butter, but it was so good and my kids liked it too!  Also very easy.  I imagine making it with the beef roast would be even more flavorful and delicious...will do that next time.  Great recipe!

This is such a delicious, simple, and versatile recipe. It has become my generic starting point for an easy stroganoff because it tastes great even when more inexpensive ingredients are used. I've cooked it according to the instructions before, and it was great, but it is also awesome cooked with inexpensive hamburger (be sure to drain some of the fat) and awful, cheap bottle of chardonnay. Overall it is easy, relatively quick to prepare, and inexpensive to make. This recipe deserves its 5 star rating.

I'm a big fan of beef stroganoff-- and this is the best I've ever had. Marinated eye of round roast in straight apple cider vinegar for a couple of hours prior to cooking to use up a cheap cut of meat and to sub for the wine. As the sauce was already too thin, adding wine/vinegar at the end would be a step backwards. Thanks to another reviewer for the tip about tempering by mixing a bit of the hot sauce with the sour cream before adding it to the pot. Thanks, Donna!

Amazing with some purely personal changes. The basic recipe for this is great. I just added some things that I like. Such as using yellow onion instead of green, adding garlic, using fresh mushrooms. I followed other's suggestions and marinated in the wine & some soy sauce first. I browned the meat and added the marinade when cooking the mushrooms, onion, garlic. I think what really makes this dish though is the mustard. I used grey poupon. I also used some cream cheese and the added the sour cream. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Good recipe.  I dust my beef with flour before I brown it, so I only needed a tablespoon of extra flour.  Also added 1-2 tsp of red wine vinegar instead of the white wine.

OMGolly!  Incredible!  I followed other reviewer's advice and marinated the meat (I used stew meat) in red wine - therefore skipped the white wine at the end of the steps.  Browned the meat in olive oil instead of butter.  Doubled the green onions.  Used Beef Consomme because it's what I had on hand.  Used fresh mushrooms (that I added at the same time I added the beef).  I'm sure the recipe would have been just as yummy even without my changes -- I am just trying to clean out my pantry and use what I have on hand without making extra trips to the grocery store.  Everyone loved -- I will definitely make again!  Thanks for sharing Donna!

Oh wow, this is really good!  Changes I made for what I had on hand:  used leftover eye of round roast made in slow cooker; used about 1/4 of a white onion; omitted wine but added 1 TBSP Worc sauce and 1/4 cup sherry; sauteed garlic with mushrooms and onions;  mixed flour with a little cold water before adding to prevent lumps.  Thanks for fabulous recipe!

Great recipe! I did alter it a bit to fit with the ingredients I had on hand. I used lean burger instead of chuck roast, yellow onion instead of green onion, dry sherry instead of white wine, and corn starch instead of flour. I also used more beef broth since I mixed the pasta in before serving and they soak up a lot of liquid. Oh, and omitted the butter, and added garlic and worchestershire. Turned out great!!

This has become our favorite beef stroganoff recipe. My wife loves when I make this for dinner.  I do marinate the beef in red wine and use 1 white onion as well as 2-3 cloves of garlic. I use an 8 oz container of fresh mushrooms and a container of Pennsylvania Dutch sliced mushrooms. Also add Worcestershire sauce and dijon mustard as well. Finish with 1/3 cup sour cream and 1/3 cup cream cheese.

The first time I attempted stroganoff, I used a combination of this recipe and another I had found elsewhere.  This last time (only my 2nd) I followed this recipe 100%.  I will never deviate from it again!!  Absolutely DELICIOUS!  Perfect as is, hands down.

This is delicious. The mustard adds a great taste. I didn't have any onions so I used garlic and it came out terrific.

This was amazing!  I used leftover roast from Sunday dinner & my husband said it was the best Beef Stroganoff he has ever had.  I didn't have wine on hand so I used extra beef broth.

Pretty good.  I took the suggestion of others and marinated the meat in red wine for about 2.5 hours (a little longer than I meant to) and I think it made the meat toooo wine flavored, which translated into the sauce tasting like wine, so be careful to marinate it a MAX of 2 hours. Overall it was great!  Added about 3 Tblsp. chopped garlic with the onions.  Loved that this recipe doesn't use cans of cream of _______ like other recipes do.  Husband loved it!

I couldn't believe how good and easy this recipe was. I used chicken instead of beef because my husband doesn't eat red meat and it was still scrumptious. Thank you, Donna.

This is simmering away as I write this, and I think it needs a 5 star on that alone...( my 8yr old just told me this!) :D  I have made this recipe before and it turned out great. Me, Hubby and 4 kids LOVE it, and I have never had a problem with the recipe..:) I do "up" the ingredients to feed us all, but stick to the recipe pretty closely..the only thing I change is using fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and I saved the chopped green tops of the green onion to serve as garnish....:) Thanks for this great meal!!!!   --------------------------------------  *  Little side note. Wanted to say that I am now eating the (very) little left overs that I have. And gotta say that it is even better after a day or two! The sauce is soooooo yummy and perfect for some bread and butter.....thanks again!!!

Used recommendations of others and added Worcestire with mustard and used 1/3 c sour cream and 1/3 cup cream cheese. I will probably cut the white wine back from 1/3 to 1/4 c next time as the flavor was a bit overpowering. Very, very good recipe though. Thanks!

My husband and I LOVED this recipe!  I followed a few other reviewers and marinated the meat in some white wine with a tablespoon of worcestershire (I drained prior to browning meat).  I only used 2 oz of butter (4 TBSP) to help cut down on fat and it did not affect the flavor at all.  I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the onions.  The sauce was a bit thin for my taste so I did end up adding about a tsp of cornstarch mixed with a bit of water to the gravy which worked perfectly.  Added about a 1/2 T of worcestershire to the sauce.  I used sirloin which turned out very tender, but it did require the full hour of simmering.  I also used baby bellas mushrooms which i sauteed separately with a small amt of butter and added at the end with the wine and sour cream.  Added a pinch of nutmeg as well.  My husband has already requested me to make this again and he is not easily impressed.

Killer recipe. I used fresh, sauteed baby bellas that I double cut. (twice as thick as precut) I sauteed them the day before in butter n oil, salt n pepper with a whisper of fresh grated nutmeg. I packed 'em up and into the fridge just waiting for the main event the next day. I also used fresh pasta instead of dried. A little parsley garnish at the end and it was fab.

this was pretty delicious.  i actually made two dishes.  1.  exactly by the recipe - yum and 2. a more low fat chicken version - pam instead of butter, chicken broth instead of beef broth and fat free sour cream onion dip instead of sour cream.  it was awesome!  i really don't think the chicken version needed to be cooked as long.

Awesome! I've never made Beef Stroganoff, in my life (I'm 28 now in 2010) - my boyfriend requested me to make some the other night... I came upon this recipe and gave it a try, using all the tips from BEEZLYS - the pan was picked CLEAN! thank you, Donna and Beezlys!

This is an excellent beef stroganoff; I always cut up a beef chuck roast; (I wait until they go on sale and then stock up) and cut them cube size; one key to this recipe is you need to cook the meat an hour or more so that it is tender; I have made this 4 times and one time I was rushing and only cooked it 30 minutes and the beef was tough; don't be tempted to try to eat it earlier than 1 hour...

I've made this a few times and each time it is delicious. I use ground beef and omit the mushrooms (we don't like them) and it does not take away from the flavor at all. I think it helps that I make my own broth. Great recipe!

My husband makes this all the time and we LOVE it!! He actually uses beef sirloin cleaned and sliced thin instead of chuck. It is sooooo tender and yummy. I always look forward to beef Stroganoff night. My family (parents and sister) just beg him to make it because "nobody" makes it like he does. Try it with sirloin. You will be glad you did.

Good.  I made last night.  I marinated the meat in cooking sherry for 2 hours before I cooked it.  I used a sweet onion and then doubled the beef broth, flour and sour cream.  Left out the wine since I marinaded the meat.  Will make again.

AWESOME. Hubby loved it. Added more than a tablespoon of garlic with the onions, marinated the meat in red wine for 4 hours, little more mustard than called for and used stone ground, used 2 tbs flour, 2 tbs cornstarch dissolved in the broth, but ended up putting a little more in with the sour cream to thicken up. Added 1 tbs Worcestershire with the mustard used a regular onion chopped, and added more mushrooms (10 fresh package but will add double that next time. Hubby also says more meat but I thought it was plenty. Added the mushrooms when I put the meat back in the pan to simmer.  YAY! WIll be making again....

I have been using this recipe for over 40 years. It was originally in the Chicago Tribune as Mitch Miller's Beef stroganoff. The only difference is that I use round steak and 1 medium onion. I have found that Sauterne wine is best. Serve it with rice for a different flavor (don't know why). It is one of family's favorite. I include this in recipes for new brides.

This is very good.  I made it in a skillet with 1 lb. ground beef and it was quick and easy.  I browned the ground beef and onions and didn't drain the grease.  I added about half of the butter called for and pushed the meat to the side of the pan to make the rue.  Only had to cook for 4 minutes once all the ingredients were added.  I also omitted the white wine and it was still great flavor.  Great recipe!

This is absolutely wonderful!  Made as directed, but sauteed fresh mushrooms (didn't have canned) and added last 15 minutes of cooking.  Simply awesome!  Didn't see suggestion of marinating beef in wine before making, but am sure that would have added even more flavor.

Really good.  Ended up using stew meat instead of ground beef because that's what we had on hand.  Think I would prefer it w/ground beef next time but it was really tasty anyway.

This was pretty easy to make... even for a novice like me.  And I felt it came out okay.  My boyfriend thought it was pretty bland... despite my attempts to add flavor per some of the other reviewers suggestions. Probably won't make again. Not a hit.

I love this recipe - I tried this out for dinner and it was a big hit.  It was super easy to make and tasted great.  My husband said that it was a little too salty, so next time I won't add any salt.

Don't use all the flour.  Use 1 TB and less butter.  It's not necessary to achieve a thick and dreamy sauce.  I added 1 TB fresh chopped dill at the end with the sour cream.  I also used up the cooked leftover prime rib instead of the chuck roast and I used fresh mushrooms.  I simmered everything together for about 50 minutes and it was heaven.

Seriously good eats.  Used red wine instead of white and white onions instead of green.  I halved the recipe for just hubby and I but the liquid proportions were off.  I probably used 1 c. wine and 1 c. of beef broth to 3 Tbsp flour.  Next time will do more as I want more 'sauce'.  Definitely worth the time and effort, left the house smelling delish all night long!

I love this recipe and so does everyone in the family. The flavors are incredible. The only personal touches I make to it are to use sirloin roast for the meat, use a yellow onion instead of the green onions (more as a convenience) and I saute 6-8oz sliced portabella mushrooms with the onion instead of using the canned mushrooms. Serve over egg noodles.

wonderful. i adapted this for my crock pot to make it easier. i also used white onions instead of green and fresh shrooms. i threw the meat, flour, spices(i added garlic and 1Tb paprika), onions and mushrooms in a bowl and mixed. sprayed the crock pot w/ pam. added the meat mixture and the rest of the ingredients except sour cream. cooked on high 3 hrs. then i dropped some fresh pasta dough into the simmering sauce for dumplings. cooked another hour then added the sour cream. i am going to start keeping homemade pasta dough in the freezer just for this recipe.

This is a very good recipe!  The first time I made it I followed the reviewer comments.  The second time I made it I followed more so the original recipe.    It's great with the chuck roast and white wine.  I added 1 tbsp of minced garlic and 1/2 medium onion.    I didn't cook the beef until after I sauteed the mushrooms, garlic and onion.  I seasoned the beef with salt, Lawry's seasoning salt, and lots of ground pepper.  I also added 1 tbsp of Worchestire sauce and only used a capful of white wine versus 1/3 cup.  Great recipe!!!

It tastes good but needs a lot of tweaking. That to me, is a mediocre recipe. The amount of butter in it disturbs me. Like many reviewers, I marinated the beef in red wine and took out the white wine. Saute fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Try adding 8-10 drops of tabasco sauce and a can of tomato soup and half the broth - you may not even need it at all. This will create a sweeter, tastier version of this otherwise unremarkable stroganoff.

This was absolutley fantastic.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using a little more beef broth.  The can i had was more than 10oz and I used the whole can.  I also used already chopped up beef stew meat instead of taking all the time to cut it up myself.  That is what I always use for stroganoff and it was really good.  I will definatley be keeping this recipe to make in the future.  My boyfriend is a hard one to please and he LOVED this!

I just wanted to let everybody know that this dish is just as great with chicken instead of beef!  I seasoned chicken strips with salt and pepper and marinated in red wine for a few hours.  Did the rest of the recipe more or less as written, substituting red onions, a few bouillon cubes, and regular mustard.  Very yummy!

VERY good! I did however leave out the mushrooms (I know it's kinda a staple with stroganoff but hubby hates them) It did get kinda think tho...I would next time lower the amount of flour. over all very tasty! I had made a roast the night noght before and had lots of leftovers so I used the meat from that. It was very good!

This is the real deal.  I have marinated the meat and I have also skipped that step.  I really can't tell too much of a difference.  If you have the time, marinate.  If not, don't worry.  It still tastes great.  I also use a medium onion instead of scallions.  I like to add a few cloves of garlic, too.  But I add garlic to just about everything.  I also add 1 Tbsp of Worcestershire...how can you make Stoganoff without it, right? I also remove the meat after it's browned and then cook the onions.  Then I add the meat back to the pan. I also stir my flour (I have also used cornstarch) into the beef broth to smooth it out before adding it into the pan. I am getting hungry typing this.  "Honey, guess what we're having for dinner tonight?"

Excellent and so easy. It takes a bit longer to cook than the recipes that call for tenderloin but the chuck turns out so tender and flavorful. Personally, I sub shallots for the green onions and cognac for the wine. I also use fresh mushrooms instead of canned and cook them longer. This dish never fails to get raves.

I made this recipe for our church's worship team.  If you can please 20 people (mostly men) it's a hit.  It's especially a hit if they ask for the recipe!  I used the tip from one of the other reviews about adding corn starch and cream cheese and I used fresh mushrooms.  It was delicious.

The cheap use-what-you-have-in-the-fridge version: hamburger instead of steak, Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, no mushrooms ... still yummy.

My whole family says this is the best stroganoff they have ever had. I followed the changes that Beezlys made. I also use sirloin. I brown the meat with the onion and then I throw it in the crockpot with the remaining ingredients and let it slow cook all day. This makes this recipe not only simple, but delicious.

I made this for supper tonight and it was a hit. The only difference I made to the receipe was I used lemon juice instead of wine as I had none on hand. My husband who is not given to floury compliments said it was good enough for royalty!!

This was incredible!!  I used Venison Tenderloin which I marinated in Cabernet for about an hour.  I made it pretty much according to directions except I used fresh mushrooms, about a tsp of minced garlic, and only about 1/4 cup of sour cream.  I served it over egg noodles with green beans sauteed with bacon and garlic and fresh baked bread.  This was exactly what I was looking for and will make many times again.

This is an excellent recipe.  I have 2 double or triple the recipe for my family.  I use stew beef instead of chuck.  And regular red onions instead of green.

I thought it was pretty good, thought could of used a little more flavor, but my husband thought it was bland.  I did marinate the beef in red wine and added a fresh clove of minced garlic, so if I make it again I will definately add more seasonings.

We loved this..we usually eat very healthy, but I like to treat my family sometimes so we added all the butter, 1/2c light sour cream and 1/2c light cream cheese, baby bellas which I suggest putting in about 15mins before the end, maybe even sauting first. I used just flour and marinated the beef in red wine, I also added a splash in the sauce at the end, it is ok if it is a little thin so it will mix with the noodles better. My friend joined us for dinner and she said it was the most tender stroganoff she has ever had. It was a delight for us all. Not something I would make all the time because of all the cream and butter. It will absolutely stay in my recipe box.

this is an amazing recipe! My 2 roommates and boyfriend went back for seconds and thirds when I made this for them.  I marinated thin slices (about 1/4 inch) of the chuck roast in red wine, but also added about 1/2 tbsp of cornstarch and fresh minced garlic to the marinade, worked it into the meat with my hands and let it sit in the fridge for about half an hour before searing it.  The meat came out AWESOME - juicy, tender, and full of flavor.  I also added a can of low-fat low-sodium cream of mushroom soup and used regular beef broth for the base.  This was an absolutely fantastic recipe.  Thanks!

This was a great choice!  I modified the recipe as recommended by another reviewer.  I asked my husband how many stars he would give me, and he said 4.5 because he wouldn't feel right giving me 5 stars on the first try!  The most timely aspect of this recipe was cutting up the meat.  It took me over an hour to do so.  This has become a family favorite instantly!

Really loved it! We had it with rice. I did add garlic and mariande in red wine as suggested by other reviewers. I also added fresh mushrooms but would saute them next time with the onion. I think I will try reduced fat sour cream next time. Thanks for sharing!

This was really tasty!  I used sirloin steak(sliced very thin), OVV, fresh mushrooms (canned are for dire emergencies!),low sodium beef broth and fat free sour cream to try to make it a bit healthier.  It was great over egg noodles but I was disapointed that there were not any leftovers!!

Excellent recipe!  I added Texas 1015 Sweet Onions and a tablespoon of tomato paste to lean toward the traditional, plus I marinated sirloin strips in red wine for two hours before preparing.    I served the Stroganoff on buttered wide egg noodles tossed with about 3/4 tsp. dried dillweed.    We'll definitely make this one again.

Very tasty, used fresh mushrooms instead of canned (not a fan of canned vegetables).  Made sure to drain them, and it was wonderful.

Yummy! I actually used ground beef in this. The sauce was delicious. I added a bit of reduced fat cream cheese just before serving.

This was delicious!  I served this to a bunch of moms and their preschoolers.  It was eaten and enjoyed by all, even a mom who has never like Stroganoff.  Thanks so much for this great recipe.  I am passing it along.

I have made this recipe twice now. The first time I did like other reviews suggested and omitted the white wine and used red wine to soak the meat in, along with using 1/2 sour cream and cream cheese for the sauce. The second time I made it like the recipe, or tried. When I added the sour cream and white wine I ended up adding cream cheese to tone down the sharp taste and thicken the sauce. It was still good, but I think I'll stick with the red wine version... awesome flavor! Thanks for the recipe, its a keeper!

I modified the recipe slightly after reading some of the other reviews: Fresh mushrooms sauteed in garlic, yellow onion instead of green , red wine instead of white and then into a crock pot for about 3.5-4 hours on LOW after the initial cooking was completed on the stovetop. Also, I added 1/3 cup sour cream and about 1/3 package of cream cheese. The sauce was still a bit too runny, but the flavor was excellent. Will definitely make this again!

Yummmm soo good.. i used 1 1/2 beef boullion cubes mixed in 1.5 cups water, i had to add 1.5 tablespoons cornstarch to get it to thicken, probably because of not using condensed beef broth, i also added some garlic and pepper and marinated the beef in wine for 3 hours before cooking.  I also added some cream cheese and a little less sour cream.. it was creamy and had a really good taste.  i also had to add some salt at the end..  i think this much be waaaaaaaaaay better in the slow cooker

Did sub the roast for ground beef though because I had that on hand.  Used a 2007 Washington State Columbia Crest Riesling wine which paired nicely.  Also subbed sweet onion for green onion and fresh mushroom for canned because of what was on hand.  Excellent flavor and simple to make.  Thanks!

The ONLY changes I made were to cut the meat into bite size pieces, and I used fresh sliced mushrooms (instead of canned) which I sauted in butter. This recipe is amazing and delicious! Definitely worthy of 5 stars!

This was good, but it didn't knock our socks off! I used wild mushrooms instead of canned and served it over white rice. I cooked the meat for 1 hour, made sure it was fork tender, but I was disappointed to find out that it didn't taste tender at all! Also, I think that the white wine was overpowering. I use a lot of wine when I cook, too, but 5 minutes before the end wasn't enough time for it to cook off. We ate it all, but I don't think I'll make it again.

Oh so good! I love how this recipe does not include cream of something soup! This tastes homemade and comforting. My hubbby is not a fan of mushrooms so I left them out. Also I took help from the store and I used the already cut up ready to stirfry beef from the meat dept. It was so good over buttered egg noddles. I'm going to make this for my mom when she comes to visit next week. :)

This had really good flavor. I cooked it for 1 1/2 hours and the meat was done but it was not tender. Next time I will try making it in the slow cooker.

Yummy!  I really enjoyed this, and the only thing that I changed was adding some fresh garlic, with the onions in the beginning, and I used fresh mushrooms, because I think thats always a better idea, but because of that I added them in about 10 minutes before serving because obviously it took them longer to cook.  It was praised by my dad and his football buddies!

My boyfriend loved it! He was really exited and so was I. We added fresh mushrooms. White and red wine, extra flour, and extra pepper near the end. I added light sour cream instead of regular, and it tasted great! Will make again and again.

I followed this exact.  I didn't have any juice left from when I cooked the beef.  I used a little extra beef broth, but after cooking, there was hardly any juices left, so I added a packet of beef gravy and a cup of water, let it thicken, then added the sour cream.

Wonderful! I followed the advice of some of the other viewers and marinated beef in red wine. I would like to recommed cutting up sirloin instead as cutting up chuck roast took a lot more time than I anticipated and I was still unable to get all the fat off. Also the chuck roast could have boiled longer as it wasn't quite ready after an hour; but that could mean I didn't cut pieces small enough. Overall everyone loved it; it's a keeper!

Just ok.  I used ground beef since it was all that I had and it was just ok.  Since I used ground beef I omitted the hour simmer.  So it was a very quick meal.

This was the first time that I made beef Stroganoff and I absolutely loved it.  I did make the following changes though:  1)I used onions instead of green onions and added two cloves of garlic.  2)  I first fried the onions and garlic and then added the meat to it and fried the meat along with the onions.  3)  I used fresh mushrooms that I sliced.  After frying the meet along with the onion, as natural meat juice came out, I added the mushrooms.  4)  I added a bit more beef broth than the recipe and added Rotini pasta to it and let it cook along with the rest of the food.  5)  I cooked it for a total of 30 min or so-pasta was in it for about 10 mins.
It came out very delicious and I enjoyed it very much.

Other than using fresh mushrooms, I made this dish exactly as it's listed. It was good but it lacked flavor for me. Next time I will try some of the variations the reviewers recommended. I served it over flat noodles. Next time I will serve it over rice and maybe the rice will soak of more of the flavor. I will give this a second chance because of all of the yummy ingredients and make some changes to add flavor.

Would highly recommend this recipe.  I agree with the other reviews that suggested:

1) marinate the meat in red wine
2) use fresh mushrooms
3) add 1T Worcestershire with mustard

I also added extra sour cream, just because I love it so much.   By using tenderized meat, I was able to cut the simmering time down to 20 min.

This was really good!... I kept to the ingredients exactly, other than using fresh mushrooms, which I added with the onions.  My meat took longer to cook than 1 hour so I added some water because all the liquid was evaporating (my lid wasn't tight enough) and the meat needed somthing to simmer in.  It still made a nice gravy!  We ate it at about 1 1/4 hours because we were hungry and couldn't wait any longer.  I would have liked the meat more tender.  I thought about using ground beef which would be faster to cook!  A good recipe; I will make it again!

Very tasty and great flavor, I used Golden Mushroom Soup instead of beef broth and omitted the mushrooms,because I dont like canned and didnt have fresh.I added the wine before simmering in my LeCreuset in a very low oven(250)for about 90 minutes. Used sirloin tip steak.

My husband said, "I'd pay money for this." I did change a few things: Instead of beef broth, I used condensed golden mushroom soup mixed with water, and I added the mushrooms with the onion. I also used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 cream cheese. I'm not a beef eater, so I don't know what this dish was supposed to taste like, but according to my husband, it's spot on.

I was looking for a way to use up some round steak I had in my freezer and decided to try this recipe since most people were rating it 5 stars.  My family just didn't think it was that great.  The only modifications I made were using the round steak and Walla Walla onions instead of green.  This stroganoff was not thick enough for our taste and lacked flavor.  It was really bland.  It didn't taste bad, but I won't make it again.

Outstanding meal. Substituted leftover grilled strip steak. Used 3 cloves fresh minced garlic when browning the meat. Substituted 12 oz. fresh sliced mushrooms and added after cooking onions. Added 1 T Worcestershire with the mustard and stock. The sauce was a bit thick, so I added additional beef stock (1/2 C) and as needed (probably 1 C total). Used a good California Riesling and a bit more sour cream (perhaps a 1/2 C total). Served over buttered egg noodles. My wife and kids raved!

I followed this recipe to the letter, and it was a HUGE hit with not only my husband, but with his parents AND our sons.  My youngest didn't like the meat, but he's 7, and still doesn't like steak or roasts very much.  And that my older son ate two helpings is saying A LOT.  I do think, though, that next time I will use regular onion instead of green.  And that's only because I like chunks or slices in my recipes.  OH, almost forgot, I used low fat sour cream, also, just to lower the fat count for my hubby.  This is definitely a keeper.

Yum!!!!!!!!!!!
Basically, I only  had hamburger meat, onions, flour, salt, pepper and mustard.
I didn't have all the ingredients and it still turned out good!

I am super picky about Beef Stroganoff because my mom always made it for us as kids.  Rather than getting her recipe I wanted to find one myself.  This one was excellent!  While cooking I discovered my flour didn't seem fresh so I used corn starch and just a bit more beef broth.

Satisfied my craving.  I did add the suggested ingredients (garlic, worcesteshire, fresh mushrooms instead of canned). I used grainy mustard instead of regular hot dog mustard. Next time I will try using cornstartch instead of flour.  Will keep this recipe on rotation.

I took the advice of others and think I should have stuck to the original recipe.  I marinated the meat in red wine and added fresh mushrooms.  NO ONE liked it and we ate out for dinner.  If I decide to make this again I would stick with the original recipe.  Everyone must be raving about something, but it certainly isn't the revised version.

Really great recipe.  I used the suggestions by Beezlys, and also used leftover grilled sirloin steak, marinated in red wine.

Great recipe, but added dry red wine instead of white and that added a really nice richness, delicious over egg noodles!

Absolutely delicious beef stroganoff! I used top sirloin roast and marinated it overnight in red wine. If you use a non-stick skillet you can get by with half the butter. After the meat browned, I spooned out most of the excess liquid and had no problem moving the meat aside to cook the onions (hint: chopped white or yellow are less work.) I like extra sauce so I added 1 - 2 c. more broth (made from beef base) than the recipe calls for. Also sauted fresh mushrooms in a little butter and garlic to add at the end...mmmmm!

This is a wonderful recipe! I gave it four stars because I felt I had to add a little more flavour. 1st of all, I used ground beef to save time (skipped the hour of simmering). Second, I skipped the oil and used a non-stick pot. Next, instead of using sour cream I used plain yoghurt (a lot healthier and trust me, it still tastes really good!). I added a little extra wine because I love the flavour it gives, and instead of adding salt, I simply added soy sauce so that the colour looks even more appetizing. YUM!!!!!!

Strooganoofin' sweet! I scaled it down to 2 servings, accidentally used a whole can of broth (for some reason, it doesn't like to convert to fractions of a can). A little extra flour and some extended simmering to thicken it and I was back in business. This is deluxe strogandorfer. Kudos!

I served this dish for my fiance and brother. We all loved it! I did make some adjustments though: added one clove of garlic, chopped, to the onions and meat, added half of a full sprig of rosemary, chopped, to the sauce, and used red onion instead of green since we were out.

I thought this was very good!  I substitued 2lbs ground beef for chuck roast, cut the butter in half and browned beef with butter and 2tsp garlic (removing 1/2 the butter at the end... it was just too much).  I also added worchester sauce (approx 3T) to the sauce and served over extra wide egg noodles... it made a ton and everyone really liked it!  This will be a regular in our house.

This is a staple in our home.  I use our leftovers from a chuck roast so that I don't have to let the meat tenderize for an hour, much quicker to use the leftovers, and the meat usually turns out better too.    Two meals with one roast... doesn't get much better than that!!  Thank you for the recipe!!  Everyone needs this in their home!  (I do saute fresh mushrooms as opposed to using canned *ick*)

This is a great recipe. My 23 year old son requested this for his birthday dinner. The whole family raved over how good dinner was.  I used sirloin steak as was suggested.  Also used half sour cream and 1/2 cream cheese as another suggested.

This was a great recipe, I followed some of the reviewers tips. Including marinating the meat in red wine, adding garlic, worstershire, medium yellow onion, I used fresh mushrooms, and added cream cheese. It still could have had some more flavor. Next time I will add some more spice to the meat.

This is superb.  If I had only done exactly as the recipe says, I don't think we would have liked it as well.  But with the additions that were suggested, i.e. marinade in red wine, worchestershire sauce, cream cheese AND sour cream....it was to DIE for!!!  I actually had some venison "chops" that I cut up and used and it couldn't have come out better!!  Thanks for a very workable and ultimately awesome recipe.

Ok, I am a fresh mushroom fan...for other fresh mushroom fans, I used 1/2 whole baby portabello and 1/2 regular mushrooms sauteed with sweet yellow onions. I also used Cabernet Sauvignon wine...Oh my goodness awesome..better than white with the beef in my opinion..AWESOME recipe! We all loved it!

This recipe was great.  Like others, I also used fresh mushrooms and also sauteed them with 1/2 a white onion and about 1 Tbs. of garlic.  I used Dry Sherry instead of white wine which complemented the mushrooms really nicely.  I used 2 cups of beef broth to allow for a bit of a thinner sauce.  It was an awesome base of a recipe to start with though!!

This was my first attempt at Beef Stroganoff and it was awesome!  I did omit the white wine and mushrooms (due to our preferences) and then doubled the beef soup, flour and sour cream.  This provided a perfect amount of sauce for my husband, me and leftovers.  I will definitely make again!

Made this for dinner last night. The only thing that I did different was to use fresh mushrooms instead of canned. It was very good. My picky daughter even liked it.

This was a really good recipe as written but with some tweaking you can make it excellent.  I used a large chopped onion (in addition to the green onion), 1 tablespoon of minced garlic, 8 ounces sliced, fresh mushrooms that I added half way thru the cooking time and 1/2 cup fresh chopped parsley added just before serving for flavor and beauty.  Omitted the wine cause I don't drink alcohol and just added water because by the time the meat was tender, it had thickened quite a bit and needed to be thinned a little.  Also, I think slicing the meat into 1 inch slices makes them more bite size. I will be making this again for sure, thanks!

This was great.  I loved it !!  I tweaked the recipe a  bit.  I used a london broil (all I had).  Sliced it very thin and sauteed it in butter.  I added about 3 medium onions (sliced).  Added 2 cans of low sodium beef broth and 24 ounces of sliced fresh mushrooms.  I also put it in the pressure cooker for 25 minutes.  It made the meat so tender and it took less time.
After I opened the pressure cooker I added 1 tblspoon of cornstarch to 1/2 cup of wine and added a few dashes of Worsceshire sauce.  I also added 1/2 package of onion soup mix.  At the very end I added about 1/2 cup of sour cream.

Served with egg noodles.

This recipe is a keeper.  I love Beef Stroganoff but it never came out flavorful enough.  This was awesome.
Thank You !!

I used petite sirloin steaks sliced thinly, no need for long simmering, omitted mushrooms, served with sprial pasta noodles. Mustard is  key. Also just used 3 T flour, very good recipe.

I served this to visiting grandparents for a big dinner.  It was a hit.  I did marinate in red wine for 2 hours before as recommended by a couple.  I also added cream cheese at the end with the sour cream (1/3 cup each).  The chuck roast was incredibly tender and I served over egg noodles.  A big hit with all.  I served some gravy in a bowl separately and that was great as those who wanted more could have it.

oh my goodness i could've died and gone to heaven right then and there. i used pasta shells instead of the long noodles, basically because they were handy, and it turned out even greater than i expected. definitely a keeper!

Outstanding!  I did change the mustard to Dijon and used sweet onions instead of green.  Next time I think I'll try using French Onion Dip instead of sour cream. . . we'll see!

This recipe was just fantastic!  The reviewers' suggestions were really helpful- I omitted the butter, used two yellow onions (because I love onions), used half flour and half cornstarch, and added minced garlic, Worcestershire sauce and cream cheese.  Thanks so much for the recipe and recommendations!

Simply awesome! My family and I are stroganoff professionals. (Well, at least at loving to eat it) And this one is one of the best I have had. i would have given it 5 stars, but there is a much more complicated recipe, that is "The Best" in my mind. This is great when I want one without all the hassle. I will probably make this one more often. I got the other recipe off the foodie Network website.

This was good and smelled awesome, but DH asked why it tasted like roast? He didn't care for the chuck roast cut in this. I didn't think he'd even notice except that I usually use sirloin steak sliced thin instead and do a quick cook method. I chose this because it used what I had on hand. I did't have green onion, so I used a vidalia onion. (about half) I did cook this about 2.5 hours as that how long it took the chuck to get tender. I added water as I needed to as it simmered. I used canned portabella mushroom pieces and let them cook in for about an hour. My guys devoured this so I know it was good. Thanks Donna, this was really good, but I'll use my tried and true next time.

I cooked this for my wife and mother in law. I took some of the advice from a few of the reviews here and made a few small changes. I added the 1tbs of Worcestershire Sauce. I also added a little garlic as well as marinating the beef in wine before cooking. I also used fresh mushrooms, which I sautéed with the green onions. 

There are NO leftovers!!

I marinated a chuck roast in balsamic vinegar/water (50/50) in the fridge for 3 hours. Put roast, marinade, and more water in pressure cooker; brought to pressure and cooked for 45 minutes. Removed roast and sliced against the grain.

Sliced and quartered two yellow onions, sliced 1 large package of button mushrooms, 1 bell pepper. Added minced garlic and ground mustard and browned all in large skillet w/olive oil. After veggies wilted I added broth from the pressure cooker, 1 large package of cream cheese and 1/2 container of cream cheese. Served over egg noodles. Very yummy! Will probably use corn starch to thicken gravy leftovers. (Did not need to brown roast or use any salt/pepper) Balsamic vinegar is GREAT! I thought I was being frivolous when I bought it, but it was worth every dollar.

The first time I tried this recipe I followed it exactly and it was okay but didn't have much flavor. This time I added a little garlic with the onions and used sherry instead of the white wine. I also used a full 14 oz can of beef broth and 2 cans of mushrooms. In place of the mustard I added a couple tablespoons of catsup. This may sound strange but I think it really made the difference. It tasted great, even the kids liked it.

The flavor was fantastic!  However, I had some issues with the flour-- it turned out lumpy and I had to perform some "kitchen magic" to make it work.  I will try the recipe again but I will use a cornstarch slurry instead.  Plus, I used fresh sliced mushrooms; I just added them to the pan while sauteeing the onions.

I love this recipe.  I have made it a few times and made a few changes.  I used london broil instead of chuck roast, added 2 cloves of garlic when cooking the onions, used beef consumme instead of beef broth, used red wine instead of white, and added 1/3 cup of cream cheese when sour cream and wine was added.  I also served over egg noodles.  This recipe is really good as leftovers as well. Thanks for all the help from other reviews.

I am giving this 4 stars only because I made my own changes, but I did follow the ingredients to a tee the things I changed was cooking time by half (my beef was in small pieces) and I eye balled the sour cream to give it the consistency my family like and everyone gave 2 thumbs up!

This was just ok for me, I did as others and I used sirloin, fresh mushrooms, wine ,cream cheese and sour cream, one onion, ect ect. The meat came out very very tender, the sauce was really creamy, but it lacked in taste, I felt like something was missing a spice or herb or SOMETHING!!!! Won't be making this version again, but will stick to my own. thanks anyway. Oh!!! also why is the mustard a ingredient in this dish if not careful it can overpower the whole thing, and I only used half the amount required.

This was my first time making beef stroganoff and after this fantastic recipe, it won't be my last. It was absolutely delicious. The only change I made was adding 2 cans of mushrooms instead of 1, and I added 1 tablespoon of worcestershire sauce. My family loved it. Thank you for sharing your recipe Donna. It was a big hit.

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe for beef stroganoff.  I made it last night for my fiancé and he just flipped over it!  He didn't just have seconds, he had thirds, then finished off the leftovers this afternoon.  Even though I had to use regular onions, it came out spectacular.

I didn't love this, but my husband really did, so I gave it 3 stars. I just didn't like the wine flavor. If I make it again, I will probably use red instead of white wine. Thanks!

Wow!  This was so good.  I've made stroganoff a thousand times, but never really been wowed by it.  We used new york steak cut in slices and the sauce was amazing.  Definitely will make this again.

This was soooo good! I did makes some modifications--added 1T Worcestershire sauce, 1T ketchup, 1/3 cup cream cheese, red wine instead of white, fresh instead of canned mushrooms and (the best part) grated Swiss cheese.  I simmered it for two hours because I used round steak instead of roast.  It was so flavorful and my husband complimented it all night.

Ok, this is probably cheating...
I wrote a review on this in 2003, and this recipe is still going strong in my family.  I have since had another kid and they love it as well.  I had to leave out the wine for them but still awsome!  Thank you for the time tested, wonderful family recipe!

This was fantastic!! I made some modifications, though. I doubled the amount of broth, and added 1/3 brick cream cheese at the end with sour cream. I didn't add enough flour to thicken, though it would be easy to remedy. I've made several stroganoff recipes and this is by far the best. I was a little leary because of the mustard, and the wine that I used, but it turned out GREAT!!! My husband loved it.

I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 only because I made modifications while I was going, which isn't new for me.  It's hard for me not to reach into the spice cabinet.  I added about a teaspoon of taragon and about 1 tbs of worsch. sauce.  As it was cooking I added more beef broth as it started to thicken and stick to the pan.  Watch it the first time you make it so that it doesn't burn.  I added 1/3 c. cream cheese and the sour cream.  I added no salt, other than the salt I put on the meat.  Oh, I also used left over filet mignon and portobello mushrooms from Christmas Dinner...it was DELICIOUS!

We loved this.  Made a few changes to make it easier, healthier and cheaper.  Browned ground beef, drained, then returned to pot and cooked with some onion and then garlic.  Added fresh mushrooms, then sprinkled with whole wheat flour, cooked for a bit, poured in the beef stock, wine and about a half cup of fat free, plain yogurt.  I served this with whole wheat flax rotini, which I cooked and then added to the beef/mushroom mixture.  Yummy.

It was a pretty good sauce.  I followed some of the other reviewers advice and used cream cheese and white wine.  I used shallots instead of teh green onions and chopped 4 cloves of fresh garlic - I love garlic! However, I thought it could have used some ketchup...Overall, a good recipe and thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  Seasoned the meat with freshed chopped garlic, worchestershire sauce, paprika and a dash of red wine Oh and a little olive oil before cooking.  I didn't have the beef broth soup on hand so I used beef vegetable soup (the vegetables in the soup were a nice addition) I also used red wine to replace the white.  MMMMMM Good! Thanks!

I used a bit of fresh garlic, red wine instead of white and doubled the amount of beef broth.  I also recommend using fresh mushrooms rather than canned.  Parley adds a nice garnish to the finished presentation.  I didn't like the idea of adding the flour as specified so I made a roux instead.

This was very good. I used 1 lb ground sirloin instead of chuck, and just simmered it for 20 minutes. I also added more mushrooms, and 1 large clove of minced garlic. With egg noodles, it made a nice weeknight dinner.

This recipe was great!  I marinated the meat in red wine for a couple of hours before cooking, added garlic, and used cream cheese.  My hubby devoured it!  If he could have, he probably would have licked the bowl.

Fantastic!  Marinated the beef in red wine and added garlic and cream cheese, as other reviewers suggested.  Left out the white wine and added extra beef broth.  Left out the mushrooms, as neither my fiance nor I care for them.

This was really good.  Only changes I made due to health issues for my mother in law was to replace half the butter with lite cream cheese, used fat free sour cream and 99% fat free beef broth and used garlic powder in place of salt.  Came out really good.  Thanks for the post.

Finally, I've found a stroganoff recipe my husband likes. I followed the recipe exactly. The flavor and concictency was good. However, the taste seemed to wane when I warmed it up for leftovers.

I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Very good recipe.  The only thing I would change was the amount of white wine.  I used 1/3 cup of white wine and I found it too strong....next time I would only use about half of that.  Otherwise it was wonderful!

I've made this three times now (including tonight), and it's always a hit.  I usually have all the ingredients at hand.  Very tasty.  This is the stroganoff recipe I've been looking for.  Tip:  the better quality the meat, the better the flavor and texture, as well.    Tonight, I have substituted chopped yellow onions for green, added worsteshire (sp?) sauce (1 tsp), and used red rather than white wine, b/c it was what I had.  And b/c I had kids over besides my one, I used ground beef for ease of eating.  This still made for a VERY tasty dish.

This recipe was great!  I cooked the beef and onions in one skillet, and as it was cooking, I started making the sauce in another large pot on the stove, where I sauteed some fresh sliced mushrooms, then added 2 small cans of cream of mushroom soup.  When the beef was done, I poured off the fat and added the beef to my mushroom sauce.  Then I added the sour cream and wine, and cooked it just a little bit longer to warm it up.  I served it over egg noodles.  The family loved it, and the leftovers were great the next day!  Thanks!

I made this last night, only a bit simpler. we bought ground chuck instead of roast, so it didn't need to dit for nearly an hour. we couldn't find canned mushrooms at wal-mart XP, so I used fresh ones that I put in after the onions in the same manner. I thought it was delicious! been wanting stroganoff for a while, and storebought versions never measure up.

I have served this dish several times since downloading it from this site.  Each time, people loved it, and remarked on how tender the meat was.  A really excellent recipe.  Thank you.

easy and delicious, thanks donna for sharing this receipe.  I made a few changes though:  i used sirloin strips instead of beef chuck; 1 medium yellow onion instead of green onion; i reduced the butter to 2 ounces; cornstarch works as well as flour... i actually disolved the cornstarch in some milk before adding to the pan; i also used 1 package of fresh mushrooms instead of the canned one; and i increased the sour cream to 1 cup.  I added the wine to the beef when i was browning it, and i also plated out the beef instead of pushing aside.

I make this all the time and it's delicious!  Definitely try adding half sour cream and half cream cheese, it makes it so rich it's unbelieveable.  This one is a keeper!

Whew!  Super wicked tasty!!!  So funnily enough my boyfriend seemed to have drank all but a teaspoon of the white wine for this recipe but it turned out fabulously anyway.  I was tasting at every step and at every step I thought I should maybe not add anything else...but it just got better and better!  Super comfort food :-)

I have to say, this was EXCELLENT.  I made a few changes, though, to suit our tastes.  I did use the chuck roast, trimmed of any fat, but I had to simmer for close to 2 1/2 hours to soften the meat enough.  I omitted the wine and added extra broth, and used sliced fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  Served over fresh egg noodles.  This is a new favorite in our house!

This is an aewsome recipe!!  My husband and I love this recipe, and so has everyone we've "experimented" on for dinner.  The only changes I made were to use sliced mushrooms instead of canned.  I also cooked the mushrooms with the onion so it was less firm at serving time.

Very good.  I used sirloin as other reviewers suggested.  The sauce was pretty rich with an entire stick of butter but quite yummy and tasty.  I will make this again for sure.

I used red wine as I thought it went better with the beef.  I added it after browning the beef and let it cook off.  Everything else I followed exactly and this dish turned out really good!  Nice consistency sauce.

Great recipe.  The only changes we made were adding about an extra 1/3 cup of wine during cooking and also used fresh mushrooms and added them about 10 minutes from the end.  Excellent!!!

Was soo soo good-I of course made a few changes-omitted the gr onions,beef broth,wine, and mustard and used yellow onion, fresh mushrooms(cut thick and added near the end of cooking as to not reduce their size too much), beef bullion.  DH said it was better than his moms!!!  Thanks for a great base recipe!!

Excellent. After doing step number 3, I placed the ingredients in my crockpot. I had a lot of running around to do that day and didn't want to wait until it finished cooking. When I came home a few hours later, I transferred everything to the skillet and added step number 4. It was yummy!

I used less sour cream, real mushrooms and a white onion... I also used red wine, as conveniently there was a bottle open. We quite enjoyed this recipe and I'd for sure make it again, next time I'd try it in a slow cooker.
Thanks

Great recipe! I added lots of garlic with the onions, used 12 oz of fresh sliced mushrooms, and used red wine instead of white. It could use more sauce. I'll add more everything next time except beef. Very tasty - thanks for the excellent start.

Unbelievably tasty and easy.  The changes I've made:  used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, added 5 gloves of minced garlic, and skipped the wine.  I didn't have beef broth, so I used 1/2 cube of chicken broth mix to season the meat, and 1/2 cube with water to add to the sause.  Turned out wonderful.  Also, next time I'll use 3lb of meat instead of 2.  We're not big sidedish fans, so I ended up having leftover sause.  But that has nothing to do with the taste.  Superb!

this is the reciepe I have been looking for for a long time. It's the best, great taste. I used about a lb. of top sirloin steak, which cut down the simmering time,more tender piece of meat.I like alot of sauce so one lb of meat was just right.I left out the wine added more broth, great.

I loved this dish.  The meat came out so soft and tender.  My husband the beef stroganoff fan said he would preferred his mom's stroganoff because she uses FRESH mushrooms and 1 cup of sour cream. He likes the sauce to have more creaminess and more mushrooms.  He did agree that the meat was more tender than his mom's though.  I'll be making this again -- looking forward to making this dish with those slight changes.

I don't usually write a review for recipes, but this was so good I had to.  It was really flavorful and tender.  I did not need to add any salt at the end, though.  Definately one I will make again and again.

This was truly outstanding.  I sliced top sirloin very thin while it was still slightly frozen, then, as others suggested, marinated the strips in wine for a few hours, omitting the step of adding wine at the end.  I also used organic beef stock instead of the condensed beef broth, and wound up adding about 3 c.  The sauce was still rich and had the perfect consistency.  I don't have a lid for my large skillet, though, so I covered with foil - this may have lead to more evaporation, so I would be careful about adding more liquid if you have a really tight-fitting lid.  I served this with brown basmati, and it was gobbled up.  It was even better the next day.

This recipe is a good one. However, I added two tablespoons of Worcesterhire Sauce and one can of Cream of Mushroom Soup. I also didn't put in the wine. My husband loved it. I will definitely make this again.

I used Beef Consumme by mistake (don't know the difference??)  I also used 1/8 cup white wine and 1/8 cup Cream Sherry.  Very Very Good.  Sherry is the perfect compliment to any beef or mushroom dish. Only cooked for 25 minutes and it came out absolutly perfect and ever so tender.  thanks

I enjoyed this, but I agree that there's something missing... I did use less butter & no mushrooms, but added garlic and nutmeg.  There are better beef stroganoff recipes out there.

Quite Good -- although I think the cooking time is a little long.  The meat was a little overdone after cooking for an hour, next time I'll try 35-40 minutes.

Awesome recipe!  I used sauteed fresh mushrooms and a whole red onion.  I also used a merlot wine instead of white wine.  The sauce had the perfect taste!  The meat cooked for 2 hours but I used more than the recipe called for.  Very time consuming but well worth it - everyone stuffed themselves in silence :)

I commented about this one earlier and forgot to mention what I changed: I used 1/4 cube butter instead of a whole cube; instead of canned mushrooms I used fresh; and added 2 cloves of garlic, minced.  This is a wonderful recipe & the sauce is awesome.

Excellent. The sauce is amazing. Definitely use a good cut of beef; I used bottom round roast, and the meat itself had poor texture when cooked. I'll make this often...my husband adored it and kept thanking me (don't tell him I used the wrong cut of meat!). You've got to try this.

I used burgundy wine instead of the white wine, and it was fine.  It needs a green salad to round out the meal.

My Fiance said this is the best thing I ever made him. He LOVED it. Which is particularly amusing, cause I didn't have wine or beef stock (I used chicken). Still tasted awesome...the mustard gives it a little added kick! Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was fabulous!  My husband is a beef stroganoff fan and having never made it, I wanted to find a good recipe.  This one was wonderful!  He raved about it and we have had it twice now.  It does take a while to prepare but it is definitely worth it.  I increased the wine and decreased the sour cream and everything still turned out great.  Thanks for posting it!

This is one of the best recipes I have gotten so far from Allrecipes. I used round steak instead of chuck. Fresh sauteed Italian mushrooms. I almost doubled the sour cream and probably next time only use 1/2 tsp of prepared mustard. Interesting, it was even better the next day! A definite keeper!

I made this a few months ago for the first time & am making again tonight.  (Was getting tired of making the same old things after being married for 30 + years).  Was a little nervous trying something new, but to my surprise, my husband liked it!  I had to scale  down to 4, since it was only for the 2 of us! 

After reading all of the reviews, I decided to take their advice &
marinade in red wine in fridge for a couple of hours, use 1/2 corn starch & 1/2 flour & mix it in w/the broth before putting in the pan, used yellow onions.  

The gravy tasted so good while cooking, you really didn't have to put sour cream in if you didn't want to.  

Tip: I cut the meat in strips when it was half thawed out for easier handing.

This was amazingly good!  I used sirloin and marinated in red wine for an hour.  Minced a clove of garlic to put in with the onion, using an  entire bunch of scallions (reserving about a third of them to add with the mushrooms at the end, and to use as garnish).  I used about 8 oz. of mushrooms, adding half during the simmer stage and the other half at the end.  I used sherry instead of white wine, beef bullion instead of broth, and kosher salt.  Used 1/3 c. + of sour cream, and about 3 tablespoons of cream cheese.  My only  complaint is not enough sauce.   We wanted more because it was so darned good!

The beef stroganoff was great. I didn’t have a slow cooker as I was not at my home. So I substituted center cut sirloin cut in pieces. I also like the meal with rice instead of noodles. The family raves about how good it was! Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this dish a few times and have decided this one is most like the one I remember my mother making when I was a child some 70+ years ago, the only changes I have made to make it "mine" is to use fresh sliced baby Bella mushrooms and 2 TBS of dry sherry at the finish.  Sometimes, I 'll add a teaspoon of Penzey's Tsarest Nights seasoning which gives it that hint of caraway which is so often used in Russian cooking.

This is an excellent recipe!!  I did use fresh mushrooms because I LOVE fresh mushrooms and almost always have some on hand.  Also used Dijon mustard (in place of prepared mustard).  There are many different types of Dijon mustard available with varying flavor levels to suit your tastes.

it was fantastic. i just made this on wednesday, the fam is asking for it again 4 days later. This one is a keeper

modifications:
1. dont add flour directly to the mix, make a roux
2. add a tiny smidge of Worcestershire sauce
3. more garlic
4. tablespoon fresh finely chopped rosemary (it grows in my garden so i pretty much use it in everything)

I used this recipe but not really.  I used 1 lb of stew beef, which I seasoned and then marinated in red wine for about an hour. Browned the beef and removed. Then sautéd 1/2 a diced yellow onion and 2 large cloves of chopped garlic. Returned meat and added about 1 cup of unsalted beef broth. Dissolved 1TB each of flour and corn starch in 2 oz of beef broth and added to pan. Brought to boil then reduced heat to low, covered and cooked for about 1 hr. After hour added one 6oz can of mushroom pcs, 2 TB of sour cream and 1 TB of cream cheese. Cooked for about 5 mins as I finished cooking NO Yolk noodles. It was about the perfect amount for my wife and I. We both thought it was very good. I had been leery of the cream cheese hence only using 1 TB but it was all good. Thanks for giving me a starting place, as I said I made it but not really.

This was excellent!  Easy to prepare. I did take out the meat to cook the onion then replaced it. I did mix my flour with the broth before adding it into the skillet.
I will definitely make this again!

This is a great recipe. My wife makes a very good  stroganoff and this on was just as good. I never made stroganoff before my wife usually did it but it was much easier than I thought. She was surprise and said it was very good. Hot dang a brownie point for me.
Thanks for the recipe.

I've made this a number of times now and it's always a crowd pleaser. Super simple and tasty the first day and even better the second. My only modification is taking the meat out to make the roux and sauce so I don't have to juggle sides of the pan. Add the beef back immediately after. I also like to sprinkle a small amount of paprika in at the end as well as on top along with the extra green onion for presentation.

This recipe is a keeper! I served sauce over meatballs I did quick in the air-fryer, used 2 cans of beef consume, a slash of wine from my glass and thickened with 1/4 cup flour and a scoop of sour cream. I added parsley for preference. This made a delicious super quick stroganoff done in 30 minutes! Thanks for sharing, I’ll be making this one again!

Magnifique!
I did marinate the beef and added garlic & cream cheese and all the ingredients to taste rather than precise quantities.  Rather than canned mushrooms, I substituted w/ fresh. 
I highly recommend it and it’s in the cookbook lockbox!

Love this dish, it is so versatile. will be making it again. Maybe next time adding a little bit more beef broth for a more gravy like sauce. 
I used Angus thin sliced steak instead of cube steak.

Great recipe! I’ve always made the soup can version and never tried it from scratch. I used red wine (my preference) and marinated the meat in it for about 3 hours. I did add garlic and Worcestershire sauce as a few others did. Yum! Will definitely make it again.

This recipe deserve a 5 stars.
I did it with a crockpot, it was fantastic!
I followed other people advices and reviews.
Here are my personal comments

Mandatory :
Fresh mushrooms
Worcestershire sauce
Marinate the beef in white or red wine.

Not Mandatory but nice to have
Cream cheese.

Seriously fantastic.  The mustard really jazzes it up to a whole new level.  I always look at what meat we have most of then find a recipe for it.  I did not expect to turn beef stew meat into this amazing stuff in under 2 hrs.  It really helps to have a good non-stick skillet for preparing this.  This will be an all-time favorite.

This is a near perfect Stroganoff recipe. I did use sweet onion instead of the whites of green onions. I added Worcestershire sauce with Dijon mustard. I used the white wine to deglaze the pan after I browned the beef and just  before I cooked the onions, garlic, and fresh mushrooms. I stirred the flour into the pan juices to make a roux, then added the beef broth and simmered for 45 min until thickened. I did add a little wine afterwards to thin the gravy a bit.I did not add cream cheese to the sour cream as this is very rich and creamy as it is. Turns out perfect every time.

I used 2 cups Fusili pasta. I used AA sirloin beef stir fry strips. I marinated it in red wine for about 25 mins. I didn’t have onion so I used a bit of French Onion soup mix and stirred it with the meat and juices. I added 3 cloves of minced garlic. I took out the beef and put it aside. I added the can of beef broth let it boil and stirred in 1 tbsp starch and 1 tbsp flour. Once thickened and blended I added the beef back in and let it simmer for about 20 mins. I then added 2 heaping tbsp sour cream and 2 heaping tbsp herb and garlic cream cheese.

Made this following the recipe just added garlic and subbed yellow onions. Turned out great though next time will cut the meat a bit smaller and increase the flour a bit because I think the yellow onions added more moisture. Flavor was on point though.

This recipe is awesome! The only substitute was white wine vinegar, fresh mushrooms and 1 yellow onion. Only because I lacked the original ingredients. I might just add garlic next time because we love it so much and uhem, we grow allot of it. That seems like a duh moment but I wanted to try this recipe as close as possible.  I did remove the meat after browining to make room to saute the mushrooms and onions. For those that do not know how to make gravy with your onions and tidbits... maybe it's a southern thing. ??

My only note would be: please add egg noodles to the ingredients list. I forget to buy them a lot because it isn’t on the list of ingredients.

I have made this recipe as written many times and it is delicious.   Bugs me that people rewrite the entire recipe then give 5 stars...write your own recipe.

This was my first time making this. It came out so good. I followed the exact recipe but used 50% lower sodium beef broth. My husband and I really enjoyed it.

Used sirloin steak instead. I skipped the white wine. Added two cloves minced garlic & one teaspoon worcestershire sauce before simmering. I also used fresh mushrooms that I had lightly fried in a pan & finished cooking in the simmer. Also forgot to buy the condensed version of the broth so had to cook down regular broth before adding. The flavor was great but next time I will take the suggestion to marinate the beef in red win first in attempts to tenderize.

Easier than expected!  Cooking isn’t my favorite thing to do....but I enjoyed making this. 

Next round, I’d use a different cut of meat and would use canned or smaller mushrooms!

It was good but needed just a little more to make it really good. I used heavy cream because that's what I had but I do think sour cream would have been better. I used about 1/2 tsp nutmeg, fresh sliced mushrooms, added to the sauce about 20 minutes before it was finished, 4 cloves of diced garlic when I put the onion in and red wine instead of white. I also used more beef broth than the recipe called for as it thickened up quite a bit. I just added it as I thought necessary to end up with the consistency I thought it should be. I'd make it again with my modifications.

This has become a staple in our household.  I usually add more mushrooms because we love them.  My tweak is to add a generous splash of dry sherry right before serving - really lifts the flavour, and adds a special something.  This recipe also freezes beautifully.

Decreased sour cream by half (personal preference), swapped condensed beef stock for beef boullion dissolved in half the normal amount of water, swapped mushrooms for peas. Also swapped cornstarch for flour.
Worcestershire sauce at 1 tbsp plus 1 tbsp of minced garlic plus some fresh rosemary added much needed flavour. 
Haha maybe I didn't truly make this recipe.

I think it's real good as written, but to me it just needs more mushrooms and onion.  I used a whole medium yellow onion and marinated the beef in the white wine.  I first browned the meat then the onion, then added the mushrooms (three cans).
My gang said it was the best I've ever made.

I made this pretty much as written but did follow one reviewer's suggestion of marinating the meat (I used petit sirloin) in red wine for one to two hours. Like several others, I added 1/3 c. sour cream. My dear husband has requested that I make this classic dish again and again and again!

Learning how to cook was my New Year’s resolution. This is the first time attempting beef stroganoff. The directions were easy to follow, the ingredients were easy to find, and it came out great. Even my 6 year old loved it! I added fresh garlic to the sauce and a spoonful of sour cream on the plate to serve.

I took some other people's advice and add some garlic and used onion instead of green onion and fresh cremini mushrooms instead of canned mushrooms. Also I cooked garlic, onion, mushroom in a pan when I browned the meat.
Everyone of my familly loved it. I'll definately make it again.

My main problem with this recipe is that it’s sooooooo good that my family insisted on an immediate additional double batch. Seriously that good. I followed the tips of adding 2TBSP of cornstarch and 2 TBSP of flour, some garlic (I used garlic salt cuz that all I had maybe 1 tsp or less), & 1/3 package of cream cheese block, and an extra 1/2 tsp extra of mustard and extra splashes of Worchester shire.

OMG, I have been making stroganoff for years and years. This was my husband’s favorite. I did make the following changes...added garlic, used London Broil and added cream cheese. We liked the white wine taste better than the usual red wine. We also used “Better than Bouillon” instead of beef broth which gave the dish a more robust taste. Will make this again

Was easier than I thought and it was excellent! I modified it a bit to fit what I had in my kitchen. I used left over sirloin (grilled medium rare) instead of raw beef so it was a little faster to heat in skillet. I also added chopped sweet onion (my husband & I love onion) in addition to the green onion. Lastly, I forgot the white wine so I used extra beef stock (I don’t use broth - only stock). Anyway, it was exceptionally delish!! I will definitely make this again and soon... yum, yum, yummy.

I seasoned the beef with garlic and onion powder as well as salt and pepper and I also added Worcestershire with the mustard and a pinch of red pepper flakes . Also, I used strip steaks which worked just fine. The smell in the kitchen was amazing. The roux turned out a little too thick so I just added some water to thin it out. Next time, I'd cut the meat into much smaller pieces. Overall this was a good recipe that I would make again. Its not that complicated, but it is time consuming. Make this when you have more than an hour to kill before you want to serve dinner

Very good, I used some Chuck Stew meat that I had on hand and simmered about 30 minutes longer then recipe called for, I  didn't have the wine or green onions so I  I skipped the wine and used yellow onions. I added about 2oz of cream cheese at the ending addition to the sour cream. very satisfying on a cold winter day.  Im giving five stars, Im sure if I had all the ingredients on hand it would have been even better.

I really like the ingredients in this recipe, but every time I have made it in a pan, the meat turns out really tough.  I have found that if I sauté the meat as directed, place it in a slow cooker, then sauté the onions in butter until just before carmelized, add the flour, mustard and 1 cup beef stock to the pan and bring to a boil, then add it to the slow cooker and cook on low for about 5 hours, the meat is nice and tender.  I stir in sliced fresh mushrooms, sour cream and 2 Tbsp. red wine vinegar about 1 hour before serving and cook it on High.  Done this way, the whole dish is perfectly flavorful.  At our favorite Russian restaurant, they serve Beef Stroganoff with diced dill pickles and fresh dill weed on top.  I have started doing this when I serve this at home.  If you are a dill pickle lover, give this a try.

Carefully read several reviews.  Made this in my fetch oven instead of a large fry pan.  Removed meat to a separate bowl after cooking.  Added real mushrooms with the onions. Removed onions and mushrooms to the meat bowl before adding the flour to make the rue.  LOVED the hot of mustard!   Substituted cream cheese for sour cream.  Served over rice - fabulous!!

Another winning recipe! I've used a different recipe for many years but fortunately decided to try a newer version. This is my new favorite. We all agreed this is very rich and delicious.

This did take a little longer than most recipes but it was really really good.  It definitely takes an hour for the meat to become tender when cooked as the recipe calls.  I used regular onions because that was all I had on hand but other than that I made exactly as written.

I also added Worcestershire-2 Tbls
Used 8 oz of fresh mushrooms and 2 pressed garlic cloves
1/3 c cream cheese and 1/3 c sour cream
I made it on the stove top and then transferred it to my slow cooker on low for 2 hours.  I used an 18oz sirlion steak cut into strips -you could cut it with a fork.  I will be making it again!

Wonderful and easy recipe. Fill of flavor, but not a bunch of ingredients. Used my Instant Pot to speed up cooking the meat.

Delicious!!! Marinated the meat in the wine/Worcestershire sauce and seasoning for about an hr, then cooked to recipe (mixed the broth and flour in jar before adding at the same time). Turned  out A-Mazing! Will definitely do it again!

I took a few readers suggestions on modifications.  I added 1/3 cup cream cheese along with the sour cream.  I sautéed fresh mushrooms in butter and minced garlic cloves.  Used only a splash of white wine as others said it thins out too much.  This was a good dish.

I will make this again. I followed some of the advice from some of the reviews like mixing the flour with some water before adding it to the pan and added some Worcester sauce to season the meat. I didn't have any chuck roast but I had about 2 1/b pounds of stew meat that I used instead. I also didn't have enough sour cream so I did half sour cream and half cream cheese. It still came out delicious.

I've loved Beef Stroganoff from my first taste in NY on business trip.  I love this recipe, but have given up on the skillet cause I end up making so much of it.

I now use a 4 qrt Soto pot.  I brown the meat in olive oil, constantly tossing it to ensure it browns consistently.  Then I toss in a whole onion, chopped, 2 cloves garlic minced, and about a cup or a bit more red wine.  I let that all cook down till there is very little fluid left, then sprinkle my flour over the whole mess and toss heavily to get the flour completely dissolved.  I've never had an issue with it clumping.  

I let that simmer just a bit to cook the flour taste out, then throw in the beef broth, etc.  I do use more sour cream and I have used cream cheese as well.  If I have ground chuck or even hamburger I need to use, I've thrown that in too.....but have to be careful about excess grease.

I cannot keep my peeps away from the stove with this one

This is so great!  I followed all of the reviewer BeezlyS's recommendations (marinade the beef in wine, add cream cheese, use real onion, real mushrooms, add worcestershire).  Turned out amazing.  I've made this twice now, and it is going to be a staple dish for sure.  The husband loves it.

this has become our staple strogonaff and my sons  favorite dinner!! I've made it numerous times tweaking it here and there. 
 First, I double up on the sauce. original recipe just isn't enough for us. I use fresh organic mushrooms and sautee them with sage and add at end with sour cream and wine. I add garlic to everything so that went in while cooking the meat and Worcestershire as it was simmering. I omit the mustard cuz I didnt have any on hand the first time and honestly.. WHAT is PREPARED mustard? used red onions cuz that's all I had and i didnt even bother doing the whole push the meat to the side thing lol. i cooked the meat, set it to the side, sauteed the onions, added broth and flour (whisking first in separate bowl to insure no clumping) and returned meat to the pan. I have not yet tried marinating in red wine... that will be next along with serving over mashed potatoes! bake up some good fresh bread and serve over egg noodles! ABSOUTLY HEAVENLY!!! Thank you for an amazing recipe!

This turned out great just as the recipe reads!  I love the cooking method of using the same large pan but pushing the ingredients to the side to focus on the next addition. It made a ton of gravy (which I was thankful for). Also- we’re always in a hurry to eat in our household...I only let it simmer for 20 min and the meat was tender enough. I can’t imagine how much better it could have been if I had allowed more time for it to simmer- next time (maybe)?

Great dish.  Modified by using beef stew meat, fresh mushrooms saluted in butter, used a little more broth and wine, simmered about 90 minutes. It's a winner.

Some changes made: soaked meat in red wine for about 20 minutes, added the wine to the broth mixture afterwards. Used 2 tbsp of corn starch with 2 tbsp of Wondra flour instead of 4 tbsp flour. Also crushed a large garlic bulb and added while meat simmered. Used dried onion instead of all that onion, kids tend to be turned off with all the onion. At the end I used 4 tbsp of low fat cream cheese and whisked it into the sauce. Results were fantastic and very family friendly! Would make again.

Served this up to company and can happy say this recipe lived up to all the rave reviews! I added garlic and worcestershire sauce as other reviewers suggested, and added the sautéed mushrooms after the 1 hour of simmer time.

I used fresh mushrooms and sautéed them with the onions and added garlic of course. I also chopped up some fresh rosemary and cooked it with the beef. Great recipe I liked the way the mustard worked with the sauce

This was delicious! I mainly followed the original but did do what other reviewers suggested: mairinated my beef in red wine, added fresh garlic and fresh mushrooms but no white wine, and a good “glug” Of worchestershire. I simmered for 1 1/2 hours and the meat was fork-tender. I served it with yeast rolls and a green salad with Italian dressing. My very tired hubby loved it!

My husband and I made this last night. It turned out great! We opted to use fresh mushrooms though; we threw them in at the same time as the onions. We also went ahead and used the green part of the onions too, diced them and threw them in at 5 minutes before serving. Nice little bits of crisp enhanced the texture for us.

Made this tonight for supper after looking at a few different variations. This was amazing as written I however took a the meat out after brownings and mixed the beef broth with the flower and boiled for a few minutes, then added everything back to the pan to simmer for an hour. I will Likely up the beef broth next time and cut back on the wine as I’m

I have made this multiple times now and decided to give a review. This recipe is simple and delicious!! My only regular alteration is using fresh mushrooms instead of canned - the more, the better. I add them before the hour-long saute period. It turns out perfect every time. Oh, I should add that I don't measure the sour cream, and may err on the side of more than what is called for, but that only makes it better! Thanks for the great recipe!

This stroganoff is easy to make and pretty tasty with a very mild flavor that the folks who don't typically like stroganoff will probably love and the ones who do love it will think it's different but tasty!  If you like it to have a lot more bite from the sour cream you will need to up the content to more like a cup. And for those who like a real powerful beefy onion flavor, you will need to add a package of onion soup/gravy mix. I cooked mine by the recipe but in my instant pot and it was very good. although you have to adjust how you cook it a tad.

Just so so. Even made some of the recommended changes - red wine marinade for 1.5 hrs, fresh mushrooms, Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 flour/1/2 corn starch, which I feel was all needed. But still just bland and meat wasn’t that tender. Wouldn’t make again

This was very good and I have made it twice now.  
After thickening the sauce I saw it was too thick and added some more beef broth. I also cooked fresh sliced mushrooms with the beef strips and served it with noodles that I put in the skillet to warm with the beef and sauce. The first time I used London broil and the second time I used rare leftover New York steak. These only had to cook 30 minutes in the sauce.

This turned out great! Like other reviewers, I used yellow onion and fresh mushrooms since that’s our preference. Also, I made a double recipe, so I removed the meat and onions from the pan before making the gravy. Another meal that will be in our regular rotation.

I found this recipe when I wanted to use up some steak that I had cooked on the grill the night before. I cooked the green onions in the butter and added the meat a few minutes before removing it from heat. I followed the recipe. I used beef broth instead of condensed soup. I added 2 beef bullion cubes ans worstershire sauce. This was delicious with a great sauce. It was a great way to give a new life to leftovers and my family didn’t even know it was left overs.

This was delectable. I used about 1/4 of the meat and a whole lot more mushrooms, as that was what was in my refrigerator. Really very easy and delicious. Oh, I also didn't want it super-thick so I only used 3 tablespoons of flour, which was perfect for me.

I used beef stew meat and sliced in about 1/4 inch slices.  I browned the meat in olive oil, removed and set aside, then added the onion and butter to skillet, then added fresh sliced mushrooms and some worstershire sauce and cooked mushrooms,  added back the beef and onions, and remaining ingredients.  I used beef consumme’ soup.  Everything else was the same and I simmered an extra 10 minutes.  Served over egg noodles and had left overs next day with rice.  It was excellent and will make again.

I made this for dinner to welcome my son home from the Navy. I read all the reviews and decided to incorporate some of them. I marinaded the beef in merlot for 2 hours, then dried it off before putting into the pan to brown. I did take the beef out of the pan before I put the onions in. I used fresh mushrooms and extra garlic cloves. The final count on garlic cloves was 4. I did add 1/3 Cup sour cream AND 4 Oz cream cheese at the end. I served it over mashed potatoes because my son doesn’t like egg noodles. The dish was so good there was silence at my dinner table for a few minutes while everyone ate up! He already requested this again!

First time making stroganoff- easy enough for a beginner to make a great dish. My dad can be picky- and he really liked it. Thanks so much! :)

I made the stroganoff, just not so much like this recipe suggests.  I used homemade (seasoned) pasta, a bottom roast (half), and had no need for wine or any suggested Worcestershire sauce. A slow bake of the seared roast seasoned with powdered onion and garlic, Adobo, and pepper,  in a little beef broth, with an added yellow onion and chunked fresh mushrooms and added 3 minced garlic gloves, made for a flavorful broth that only needed thickening and a dab of sour cream. Added with the pasta infused with garlic and onion, had every bite equally enjoyable as the next. This was to be dinner, but lunch got the first bite. 

I'm sure this recipe would taste good as it's written,  but the stomach wants what the stomach wants, so I put a mild southern touch on this comfort food.

Turned out great. Had to make some substitutions. Used cooking sherry and that added a nice flavor. Used fresh diced mushrooms and added them at last 10 min to cook. Had to monitor to maintain desired consistency, added little water to help.

Very nice. Had to add a tad more wine during simmering. Made sauce kinda thick. Additional wine worked well...in my glass too!  Good job.

My family loves this recipe! I made some minor changes and it turned out amazing! 1st, to save myself some time, I use the value packs of stew meat and cook it in small batches to get it cooked a little more quickly. 2nd, I like fresh mushrooms. So after I brown all the stew meat, i remove the meat frim the pan and I add 2 extra tbs of butter and cook one package of presliced button or baby Bella mushrooms for 2 mins or so or til lightly browned. I will remove the mushrooms and place the meat back in the pan and finish cooking the meat as directed in the recipe. Enjoy!

I’m using stew meat and it only takes 35-40 minutes vs the hour but it creates a little more liquid so a little more flour is needed. Also add some extra extra sat and pepper to the stew meat, with the extra liquid it loses the initial seasoning. But Doug these couple of things still makes this turns out amazing!

The flavor of this recipe was good, but the chuck roast texture was not my favorite, it needs a more tender meat with less marbling of fat.

I liked the steps of preparation. Logical and directions were easy to follow.
   I used a medium white onion instead of green onions.
   Instead of a can of beef broth I used a package of Lipton’s beef soup mix added to 2 c. of water which I think gave it a good flavor, and the additional liquid seemed to be necessary.
   I added a couple of shakes of worchestershire sauce for a bit of tang.  
   I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned which I sautéed in olive oil and added during the simmering time. 
   Didn’t have wine. Don’t know that it was missed.

Really very good but of course like so many I had to add and subtract.  First I used top sirloin I think it does better in this type of dish.  I did marinate it in white wine for two hours.  Dredged the meat in seasoned flour and browned.  Removed and sautéed a yellow onion in the drippings.  Added fresh mushrooms to the onions and when they were mostly cooked added garlic.  Deglazed the pan with a little more white wine (why not).  Added Worchester sauce for enhanced flavor.  I use beef stock and if the sauce is too thin then make a little roux.  When I make my noodles I cook them in beef stock as well.  This turned out yummy and my husband loved it too.  That is most important. Happy cooking!!!

Since I don't have a giant skillet, I browned the beef strips a bit at a time, and used a second skillet to hold them while I sauteed the onions. Then again to hold the onions while I made the gravy.

I only used about half the amount of butter to brown the meat and onions. Then three more Tablespoons to make the roux for the gravy.

When the gravy was ready, I returned the beef and onions back to the original pan to simmer for about 45 minutes.

After 45 minutes, I used the second pan to sautee up some fresh mushrooms in that last Tablespoon of butter, instead of using canned. I added the wine to the mushrooms, and let that boil down for a minute or two. 

Used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and added it to the simmering gravy and goodness with the mushrooms. 

Turned out really well. Didn't feel like the butter was over powering, or that the wine thinned out the sauce too much. 

Delicious!

This is a fantastic recipe! I have made it a number of times and always thought it was slightly difficult to push the beef to one side of the pan while making the roux on the other, so I did what others had suggested and simply removed the beef and re-added later. Also, mixing the flour into the broth before adding to the pan was effective as well. I also added garlic as others mentioned but also added a heavy TBSP of Better Than Bouillon beef base. Incredibly flavorful and was a hit with the family!

Great recipe.  I tweaked it a tad.  I had leftover grilled tenderloin  that I chopped into strips.  I cut half back on sour cream and added 2 tbsp of cream cheese.

I used sirloin tips, slicing the meat and then Marinating in red wine. I used fresh mushrooms and omitted the onion. The beef broth was really salty so I ended up adding half a can of cream of mushroom, along with the sour cream to try to dilute the saltiness. Good flavor!

I had to modify this recipe to include fresh mushrooms - canned mushrooms are an abomination to me. As a result the flavor profile was exquisite! I can't imagine achieving that with lack-luster canned mushrooms. I also used white onion in the base and chopped scallions tossed in before pouring over noodles.

While recipe taste great, the recipe itself can use a little tweaking. How come boiling the pasta was not includ d on here? And just say use use bottle mustard, not all of us knows our kitchen words for things, such as “prepared mustard”. Other than that it taste good

If you want a outstanding dish, change meat to two pounds of ground beef  with two onions, two trays of fresh mushrooms sliced, and two gloves of garlic. Fry it together and dump grease, add remaining ingredients from recipe without chuck roast and green onions. Add instead of prepared mustard 1 teas of sweet hot mustard, three Table of sugar, 4 Oz of cream cheese, 10 Oz of Campbell’s beef consume and three teas of knorr bouillon, you need 3 Tab Of flour not 4, then add 1/2 c of parm cheese add it all together with remaining ingredients in recipe cook and wella’

This was absolutely delicious!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and marinaded the beef in red wine for a few hours.  I also cooked the beef separately and also cooked the mushrooms separately and added them cooked at the end.  I completely forgot the mustard and it was still delicious.  I added cloves of garlic right before I made the sauce and added very little sour cream (due to my husbands preference).  Lastly, I omitted onions of any kind entirely, so I would appeal to my kids.  The one thing I learned after making it the first time is that it really does take a while to cook.  An hour wasn't enough for me.  You want the connective tissue to break down, and that took about 2 hours on a high simmer.  This makes a huge difference in the taste of this dish when you cook it long enough.
Everyone in my family loved it, I will be making this again and again, it's also company worthy as well!

AMAZING! Was a little worried about the mustard but it adds just the right kick. Followed some other suggestions by browning the meat then removing it all together from the pan. Also added the Worcestershire and red wine. Served over wide egg noodles with garlic bread and a salad. TO DIE FOR!

Very good but with lots of changes.  Used sirloin instead of chuck.  Used dijon mustard.  Used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and should perhaps sauté them with yellow onion (used that instead of green onion) instead of adding at the end.  I think I would also add the flour differently next time to avoid lumps, maybe mix it with the broth first.

I made this dish after reading the reviews and it was a hit with my husband. I did add garlic and Worcestershire (a dash). I also used a Pinot Grigio in the end and it added that hint of zest.  I will make it again,especially in the winter when it is really hard to grill outside.

This basic recipe was okay - i used twice the green onions and believe it needed more.  I also used fresh mushrooms, not canned.  It would have used more flavor - maybe garlic and Worcester sauce.  Good recipe for a starter - then add your own twist.

I enjoyed the recipe, just a few things I changed.  I used a 2lb sirloin steak cutting it in very thin strips against the grain.  dusted the strips in flour and then salt and pepper put in 4TBSP of butter with a little Olive oil for 3-4 mins pulled out of the pan.  then in same pan sauteed 1cup chopped onions, 1 16oz sliced mushrooms with additional 2TB butter, 2 lg cloves garlic finely chopped.  cooked for 5 mins  then added 1 cup white wine till reduced then added 3 TBS of flour and cooked for 3 mins then added 3TBSP of tomato paste, still and add 1 15oz can of beef stock.  let thicken add 8oz sour cream and serve over noodles.

Tasted delicious! Perfect winter meal :) 
Only things I changed were the onions (used yellow) and used fresh mushrooms (put them in 30min into cooking).

Wow! So delicious! I made the recipe as directed, except I added the mushrooms and wine much earlier, and simmered about 1 1/2 -2 hours. This may be my favorite dish I’ve ever made! Yum!! The kids gobbled it up, too.

I used fresh shiitake mushrooms instead of canned. But otherwise followed recipe. I recommend whisking flour in a bowl with broth before adding to pan to avoid lumps. Next time I may try marinading meat in wine as others did.

The husband doesn’t like beef stroganoff but I thought I’d give this recipe a try as it’s so highly rated. It didn’t change his mind - I liked it but wasn’t particularly wowed. I’m glad I followed the advice of other reviewers and added garlic and Worcestershire sauce, I doubt it would have had much flavor without those additions.

The recipe was pretty underwhelming. I prefer to use steak for Stroganoff instead of roast and I remembered why. The meat just wasnt’ as tender or flavorful as I’m used to. There also wasn’t enough sour cream in the recipe, so I added some after tasting.

Yum! Followed the recipe minus mushrooms, I know that kind of defeats the point of stroganoff but I've got some picky eaters. This was easy & delicious.

Outstanding! Just like my Grandma used to make. Thank you!

Edit: I had no issues with any clumping. It's roux 101. A roux is a combo of fat and flour; equal amounts. The clumping occurs if not added in the order specified. It's supposed to be fat and flour, then liquid.  Enjoy!

I made it with noodles.  Did not use can mushrooms.  Fried some mushrooms and then added them at the end.  
I will make this receipe again.  Gave it to my daughter.  She is going to try it too. 

Thank you.  We really enjoyed it.

This was delicious. I did marinate the meat in red wine like some other reviewers and used fresh mushrooms cooked with the meat instead of adding at the end. Very rich flavor.

Yummy! I added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce along with the beef broth and mustard  (I used spicy Brown mustard). It came out really tasty. I also used top round instead of Chuck roast. The meat was good, but I wanted a little more tenderness in the end. Good recipe!

I am giving this a three star mostly because if you add wine to the dish in the end, that is all you will taste. Marinating the meat in the wine & then adding, or adding the wine with the beef broth & then simmering for at least an hour will give the sauce a deep, rich flavor. Just like spaghetti sauce or any sauce always simmer a sauce that has wine. Also, adding a few splashes of Worshire sauce is essential to the meat tasting very rich along with the wine. 

I always take out the meat after browning it, & I use sirloin steak. I add fresh garlic, fresh mushrooms, chopped yellow onion. Then I add beef bouillon soup, as much as 3 cans depending on how much meat I am cooking, & 1 can of French onion soup. I do add real butter, & chopped parsley & butter to my noodles before adding the stroganoff. I season the stroganoff with coarse black pepper, salt, onion powder, a touch of garlic powder, & two or three tablespoons of ketchup which I add to the sauce mixture before I simmer it. I always use a good white wine  & marinate the meat in it & add all of it to the sauce in the beginning. I add about a half cup of sour cream in the end. When completely done, I add a little chopped parsley which makes it look so nice. I may try using a little cream cheese with my sour cream next time as others have done, that sounds good. And I do thicken the sauce with flour mixed with some of the broth so it will be smooth.
This is a very special dish, that we eat once in awhile so this is not mean

Good stuff! My changes make it a FIVE. Since the 1960's, my family has loved this recipe, with the following minor substitutions: fresh mushrooms rather than canned, consume rather than beef broth, regular onions with large chop rather than green onions, and 1/4 teaspoon of dry mustard rather than prepared mustard. We serve over buttered noodles, with steamed asparagus covered by hollandaise, and hot garlic bread to sop any gravy. Finish with Midwest style cheesecake, and you have the perfect meal!

I used less butter and a mixture of butter and oil.  I also use any onion that I have.  The other thing is I fry the fresh mushrooms, but take them out before starting the sauce part.  I don't consider that this is changing the recipe.  Very simple to prepare.

I used fresh mushrooms, lightly cooked in butter and added as directed.  Prepared in a Lecreuset and rather than simmer to complete I finished in a 250 oven for about two hours, then added the wine and sour cream.  Removed the meat to create a rue, which allowed me to judge the consistancy of the broth before adding back the meat.

This is seriously great, every time. I use the green tops of the onions, thinly sliced, as a finishing garnish. This also performs just as well with low-fat sour cream.

This was really good! I found the taste a bit sour (that admittedly may have been my own fault due to swapping dry white wine for white wine vinegar), and it was a bit too runny for my taste. I'll be trying it again (with dry white wine) and I'll add a bit more cornstarch to thicken it up better and see if that helps.

This beef stroganoff is a definite favorite in our house.  I wasn't sure what kind of mustard I was suppose to use so I just used a Dijon mustard.  Also I love mushrooms but my SO doe not.  So I just sauté mine separately and added them to my plate.

Fantastic, was hesitant to try it, but it turned out great!  It is so easy to put together, cooking time did seam a bit excessive.  I made this with ground meat the second time to cut down on the  cooking time and it turned out beautiful, because of this it is now on my "easy" list.

This is a good basic stroganoff recipe. The thickness of the sauce was perfect, I just thought it needed a bit more of something. The flavor could be kicked up a notch. Definitely a good starter recipe though. Thanks.

I have made this so many times.  I use fresh mushrooms rather than canned and add them when I add the green onion.  I also don't bother trying to separate things to one side of the pan - mishmash comes out just fine.  We like things extra beefy at my house, so I add a couple of tablespoons of "Better than Bouillon Roasted Beef Base" and it is wonderful!  A true family favorite!

Made it for the family and it was an instant favorite. Used about 1 TBL of Dijon mustard because that's what I had.  Fabulous!  Family demanded an encore the very next week.

Very good. My family all liked it. I made it exactly as it was with no changes. Not a dish to make if you're in a hurry, though. One daughter complained it was a little too rich for her taste. I will make it again.

I've made this recipe two times. Everyone in the family just loves it, even my picky kids.  It is well balanced, smooth and has plenty of flavor.  Delicious over noodles.  Perfect meal to impress. Definitely deserves all its rave reviews.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Great recipe..... if out of beef strips or stew meat, hamburger makes a decent substitute, though not quite the real deal. I like to add a minced clove of garlic, just personal taste. But honestly, this needs no added touches at all!

This was delish!  I don't like yellow mustard so I never buy it so I used country style GP instead.  I've never used mustard in stroganoff before but wow!  Very hardy and easy to make.  Hubby loved it too.  Oh, and had some stew meat to use up so I used that.

We liked this recipe. I browned the meat and put it in the crockpot with the chopped green onion (raw). Made the gravy on the stovetop and added sherry to that instead of white wine at the end. Poured over the meat in the crockpot. Cooked on low for 3 hrs, adding in fresh mushrooms during the last 30 minutes. Mixed in the sour cream before serving. I served this over egg noodles. The meat was tender and it was delicious!

This was very good. Great use to repurpose leftover ribeye steak. Didn't have condensed broth so boiled some broth to thicken it. Didn't use mustard. Was still great. Steak was super tender.

Excellent tasting. A bit runny, would have liked a thicker sauce. Could be that the problem was I substituted beef bullion instead of condensed beef broth.

Made according to directions except adding garlic and a dash of worcestershire, and omitting the mushrooms for picky kids. 
Excellent recipe. Easy and will make again!

Why the cream cheese? I don't know what prepared mustard is so used wholegrain. Can't go wrong. Fried onion with salt and pepper, sautéed mushrooms. Lightly fried beef then added wine which I cooked off a little bit. Only put in 1 1/2 cups beef stock loads of garlic and worchershire. Brought to the boil then put in the oven for 1 and a half hours at 160 degrees Celsius. Before I added 1/4 cup each of cream cheese and sour cream it was AMAZING!!! The cream cheese killed it. Next time I will stick to sour cream only. Put less stock in it then you don't need cornflour.

We loved it! I marinated the beef in some red wine for about an hour before cooking. I did not add any other wine because of this. (using what I have).  We love garlic and so I added some. I had only sweet onions so I used that instead of the green ones. I used Dijon mustard. And served it on top of homemade pasta. I shall do this for company next time.

Delish! The flavors were so yummy! I made a few changes... I used beef stew meat and sliced it into bite size pieces, added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce to the beef after I added the flour and about 30 minutes into simmering the beef mixture I added 1/3 stick of cream cheese. I will be making this again! The hubs gave it two enthusiastic thumbs up!

I made this recipe exactly the way it said. Not sure why they want you to push the beef to the side, then push the onions to the side, oh well I did it anyway. I'm not a huge fan of beef stroganoff, bad childhood memories of terrible cooking. But this was fantastic! Everyone enjoyed it including my daughter who's very picking. My husband said it was even better the second day! I wouldn't know cause he ate it all, haha!

I was in a hurry during a weekday dinner so I substituted hamburger meat which made a nice bolognaise-type sauce. I added fresh, sauted mushrooms and an Herbs De Provence seasoning since this recipe is a little bland. I used Poupon mustard which gave the recipe a deep spicy flavor. This cut the time to cook this recipe in 1/2.

Simply divine. I used scraps from a whole beef loin, fresh mushrooms, just a hint of smoke flavor, and half again more onion. For the wine, I used Almaden's Rhine, my standard choice for white-wine cooking. Don't skimp now: Serve over Mrs. Miller's homemade noodles for perfect flavor and texture that hits this recipe out of the park. I love you. Thank you for posting.

I marinated the meat in some white wine and then left the wine out of the recipe.  
I used one yellow onion diced instead of green, added 2 tsp minced garlic and a tbsp Worcestershire sauce.  Next time I will try it in the slow cooker.  Meat was a little tough even after simmering an hour.

I just made this recipe and it is good. Is it the stroganoff we got in a local restaurant in St. Petersburg? No, but there are no recipes on the web that replicate that for any cuisine or dish. As is, good, you want to play with it - awesome! Rate this recipe as is or post your own is all.

Absolutely teriffic!  The only changes I made was to use 8 oz of fresh mushrooms and a whole white onion. And I made it in my Instant Pot so the beef would be more tender. We absolutely loved it! The gravy is "to die for."

LOVE!  Hubby said this is the best thing I've ever made!  I used a small can of mushrooms since I had them on hand and left out the wine.  AMAZING!  Can't wait to have it again!

Great recipe, I would use 1/2 c sour cream, I also added garlic and 2 cans of mushrooms,  didn't  have any wine so just used a 14oz can of beef broth.  Very easy and a cozy Sunday dinner.

I used a thick cut Top Sirloin instead of chuck roast, sliced portobello mushrooms fried in a wee bit of butter to bring out the nuttiness instead of canned mushrooms, and a nice red wine instead of a white wine. If I were to use a white wine it would be a Niagara or a Rhine. Other wise this is just a great recipe. Cheers!!!

I used your recipe as a base to work with, read a lot of web comments about what is authentic or not, asked a pro cook I know in Canada who is Deaf and considering his own business, and made my alterations. 

I subbed white chopped onion for green. I used a large mushroom although something called cremelli mushrooms are said to be good as I didn't see any. Mushroom soup is fake others said so it is one reason I chose your recipe. Some said use white some say red, which confuses me because I'm no expert. So I grabbed at Whole Foods a cheap Pinot noir and used that. I used only a pinch of flour because wine my buddy told me thicken the stuff stuck to the bottom of the pan. He was right! So do not scrape clean your frypan before finishing! 

I had white pepper powder and I used good olive oil instead of butter to fry.  I love sour so besides real sour cream without stabilizers or gums to thicken it artificially, I threw in a little lemon juice to taste.

Many Russians say noodles are a no no.  But I'm American and I do what I like, so egg noodles it is! :D

I haven't had this since I was around 7. We were dirt poor and used a packet and sour cream. This recipe is nostalgic and don't have the gums and garbage they put i seasoning packets today.

Love this recipe. Can use steak as well as roast. I use Better Than Bouillon for the stock and it works great, too. My go-to for stroganoff.

Oh my this was soooo good!  Super rich.  Maybe could use less butter but I liked it with all of it.  We ate every bit.  I made with filet and mmmmmm so decadent!  Served over a wild rice and brown basmati rice mix.  Perfect!!!  A family fav.

Actually made it with left over pot roast, therefore did not need to simmer for an hour, added the cooked beef at the end with the sour cream. Very good.  I also added the cream cheese as others recommended as well as using fresh mushrooms.

I made this tonight and we loved it! I used tenderloin and left out the wine (only because I didn't have it). I also added two cloves of garlic to the onions and a 1/2 t. paprika to the flour.   Really looking forward to making this again!!

I made this with the following changes: 3lbs of meat, double mustard, several dashes of worcestershire, a few shakes of herbs deprovence, 2/3 cup dry vermouth for the white wine, two cans of beef broth, six tablespoons flour.  It turned out great and a big eating family of four had leftovers for two.

Definitely needs Worcestershire sauce and more flavour. I also added a lot of garlic. I'll stick to my traditional beef stroganoff recipe.

This recipe was okay.  I took some of the other suggestions- I marinated the meat in white wine, I used top sirloin, added yellow onions, used cornstarch instead of flour, added Worcestershire sauce and used half cream cheese/half sour cream.  I didn't like the texture that the cream cheese gave the sauce.  It was hard to blend it in and it left small chunks of cream cheese.  I'd eliminate that if I made it again.

I've been making beef stroganoff for years and this is the basic recipe but if you add 1 can tomato paste, 2 large finely chopped dill pickles, 1 tbspn Worcestershire sauce and soak the beef in red wine 1hr minimum prior to browning then it's 10x better!! Of course add more garlic and I use a minimum of 2 cups beef broth and simmer all the ingredients except the beef ,on the stove together for about 5-8mins, after putting the beef to the side.  Then mix it all together in a French Oven and cook on 300 for 3-4 hrs. The key is that you need to start with enough liquid, so as to avoid adding beef broth throughout, because remember in the beginning when you carefully blended all those juices together? That extra 10mins wasn't for nothing. You can always thicken at the end when I add my flour right into the sour cream container before adding to the dish!

This was so yummy!  I don't cook very often, but this was easy and fun to make and came out so good I just couldn't believe it!  I can't wait to make it again!  I did add 1/3 cup cream cheese at the end as another member had suggested.  And my friend told me to cut the roast while it was still a little frozen and it sliced easily.  Love love loved it!

Followed this exactly. Not that great. Way too much butter (and I love butter) - use half the amount given. Canned mushrooms? Lightly sauté fresh mushrooms and add at the end. Not thick enough - a little more flour/sour cream with less butter would be better. More of a cream soup than a rich stew/stroganoff. Flavor was just ok.

Delicious recipe! We cooked the meat in crockpot the night before. Cooled it and easier to slice, very tender. Add garlic because we love it and didn't change anything else. Easy and so good. Thanks for a great recipe!

It turned out great. I made adjustments because I lacked ingredients and was too sick to go to store. I skipped the cooking wine additive and used fresh mushrooms I had in my fridge instead of canned. I used everything else with recommended cooking times.

This is a great & simple meal to make the family.  I made it with only minor changes to ingredients.  I purchased pre cubed stew meat & soaked it in white wine vinegar overnight to tenderize.  I used 2 leeks instead of green onions & fresh mushrooms that were sautéed with the leeks.  Other then that as per recipe & we LOVED IT!!

Loved it! I added wine in the beginning and at the end, as well as both green and half of a sweet onion. I also used fresh mushrooms, but added them earlier in the simmering stage. I think I'll try a touch of garlic next time. Very rich and flavorful, my family loved it!

I used an iron steak and marinated it in red wine for a few hours before cooking.  I left out the white wine and it was still delish!

I made this for a dinner party of seven people.  It was delicious!  I made it exactly how it is printed and it turned out great.  I used a whisk to add in the flour but it might be a good idea to mix the flour with the broth and then add it in.  I used a top sirloin roast and cut it into strips.

I have  made this twice and it was a big hit with everyone. My sister is  now going to make this recipe instead of the ones she's used over the years! I left out the red pepper flakes due to allergy otherwise followed the recipe. Served over egg noodles. Delicious!

Literally still at the dinner table writing this review.  It was amazing.  This was my first time making this recipe or beef stroganoff for that matter.  I enjoyed this dinner so much.  The only thing I would change in the future is to remove the beef while making the rue it's just too much headache.  Also I forgot to grab sour cream I used some milk instead turned out delicious.  I'll try it with the sour cream next time as directed though.  The gravy was so thick and velvety and the meat was delicious and tender.  Can't say enough.

I sautéed fresh mushrooms in butter instead of using canned, and added one cube of beef boullion.  It turned out excellent, with a hearty, beefy flavour and exceptionally tender meat.

This is a very good basic recipe, that can incorporate added ingredients for personal tastes  quite easily.
Following the recipe exactly produces a good strognoff.  
Using fresher ingredients as well as personal tastes elevates this to outstanding.

This is an easy to follow recipe and doesn't require much work. 
When I make this again I will make a couple of adjustments. I I'll eliminate the white wine. I did not care for the twangy flavor the wine added in the final product. It was good but I wished after I added it I hadn't. And I'll add a little more mustard next time. 
Overall with a few minor, personal tweaks this is very easy, tasty, hearty dish to serve to your family.

So, so, so impressed! I went from "what do I do with leftover venison steak?" to "holy cow, I can't believe we just ate all of that!" in the matter of one hour. I sauteed the onions in the butter, threw in the chopped up steak, and added dried mushrooms and about 2 cans of broth and the mustard. I cooked it for about 45 minutes (Hey! I was hungry!) and then added a 4oz log of creamy goat cheese (we're sensitive to cow's milk here) and 1 Tbsp corn starch to thicken. That's it. I skipped the rest of the ingredients because the steak had been marinated, but WOW!!! This was seriously good.

I used sirloin because on sale and was very good. I took it out of the pan, then added flour.  Used fresh mushrooms, added a 1/3 cup cream cheese and a tbl of worchester sauce at the end because I thought it would add flavor and it did. I added a splash of sherry. Served over buttered noodles.

Yes I made it, very easy and used my Dutch oven.
Will make it again but I'll  use an assortment of fresh mushrooms.
I coated the meat with the flour, salt & pepper and removed it from the pan so I could deglaze it with the beef broth & wine.
I used unsalted butter and dijon mustard.

I did tweak this a bit by adding garlic,  tomato paste, worcestershire sauce cream cheese/sour cream and a bit of mustard.  It was so flavorful!  I also tossed the meat with the flour/salt/pepper and browned that in the oil....

Wow. This dish is terrific. Most beef stroganoff recipes I have tried in the past use tomato paste, which I never liked. I had this dish with egg noodles, and will be making it many more times.

We LOVED this recipe! I followed some of the tips in the other reviews to add cream cheese along with the sour cream and to marinate the beef in red wine before browning. We also forgot to add the mushrooms. =) But the dish was rich, hearty, and excellent and a big hit with my whole family. We served it over egg noodles with peas on the side, and the sauce was the only seasoning the peas needed. Great dinner on a cold winter night.

Simple and savory. The meat became very tender (I simmered the dish for about 2 hours), and the sauce had nice flavors and a good consistency; I used fresh mushrooms and just under 1/4 cup sour cream. In addition, I used extra wide noodles, and finished off the dish with a pinch of sliced green onions. A keeper.

Best ever!! I don't like this dish and never make it but my boys always want the hamburger helper version and I refuse to make that. So I decided to try this recipe....wow! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this one!! So easy and it is truly the best I've ever tasted in my opinion. They are already asking for it again!  I'd say the recipe is perfect just they way it is...I can't give it enough praise! Thanks for this!!

Very rich and a little on the salty side, next time I'll use unsalted butter and hope that works.  I followed beezlyS' advice with the cornstarch, mustard and Worcestershire sauce.  I marinated my meat in red wine and then after the beef stock to the cooked meat and veg, I threw that wine in just before letting it cook for 45 minutes.  I would recommend stirring your stew a couple times while it simmers.  Mine caramelized a bit, not too bad though.  My entire family devoured this dish and I will definitely make it again and again and again.  Oh! I also have a rosemary bush outside and took a sprig from that and put it in every step from marinade to serving.

Luke loved it (too rich for everyone else)...  going to go into his birthday week rotation.  Added 1 small chopped onion and 4 cloves of chopped garlic at beginning.  And added 1/3 cup of cream cheese with the sour cream.  Subbed beef broth for wine (didn't have any)..

Excellent results.  I used sirloin steak, fresh mushrooms (added about 15 minutes before it was done cooking, red wine instead of white and about twice as much sour cream.  This will be a regular event from now on.  Really, really good.

I pretty much always marinate the beef in red wine (cuz that's what I drink) and sometimes if I catch the meat on sale I'll cut it up, put in the garlic and red wine, and put it in my freezer until I'm ready to cook it (usually in my slow cooker). Definitely a family favorite.

Delicious comfort food!  I made the recipe pretty much as written, except that I didn't have any white wine, so used red instead.  I used chuck, and after simmering for an hour it was a little chewier than I like it.  Next time I will either allow more time to simmer or slice it thinner than 1/2 inch, or use sirloin.  Maybe marinating it in the wine for a few hours would help to tenderize it, too.  I used fresh mushrooms, and added them to the simmer about halfway through rather than at the end.  I added a little more sour cream than the recipe calls for.  Great recipe -- thanks for sharing!

My huge dumb mistake made it a little salty. I will try this again and come back and rate it again. Stroganoff is such a comfort food that it won't be long before I'm back.

I put the  flour and my favorite seasoning in  a Ziploc bag along with the meat and shook it up till meat was covered then added it to the sauteed onions and browned the meat. And used a large onion and fresh baby Bella mushrooms (I added the mushrooms about a half hr before the sour cream).  Real easy and excellent.

Served this with whole wheat egg noodles. I used my slow cooker/electric pressure cooker/browner (like a generic Instapot) to make this. I used olive oil instead of butter and whole wheat flour. I also used fresh sliced mushrooms. After browning the meat, making the roux and adding the broth and mushrooms, I slow cooked for 3-4 hours. I set the pressure cook option twice for 1 minute each time. The meat was very tender and my family loved this.

This recipe was wonderful! I will just say that I ended up adding some Worcestershire sauce for flavor, and that is the only addition I would recommend. I made this for a church potluck meal, and there was nothing left over!

Excellent!  I used left over roast which was already cooked so I didn't have to simmer it for an hour.  It was still delicious and a great way to use left over beef.

Use real mushrooms and cook them together with the sauce and wine, who in their right mind would use canned mushrooms in beef stroganoff or add wine to ANYTHING just before serving, is beyond me.

Used left over beef tenderloin when making this. I sauteed the onions a bit, then added the mushrooms and some minced garlic that I didn't measure, added the meat to heat it up.  Doubled the sauce so I added 4 tbls of corn starch to one can of condensed soup and 4 tbsp of flour to the other, stirred that in then added the mustard and Worcestershire sauce.  Cooked it a bit to thicken the sauce then added 1/3 cup cream cheese (doubled) and 1/3 sour cream  doubled. Served it over brown rice, the boys loved it, so good!!

This recipe has an amazing flavor. We loved it! The only thing I did differently was to use sweet onion instead of green onions. I will continue to use this recipe when we are craving some Beef Stroganoff.

Definitely a tasty recipe! we always increase the white wine, almost double, cook it into the meat during the simmering. And we increase the mustard a little. We increase the sour cream considerably too, to add a bit of creaminess. But we make this ALL the time, very tasty.

This is my go-to stroganoff recipe and the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it calls for canned mushrooms. Maybe it's because I'm from Oregon but I think anything less than fresh mushrooms is a crime. Aside from that, I make it exactly as written and it's always a hit. Thank you for sharing.

Marinate meat in red or white wine for 1-2 hours before cooking. Then you can eliminate adding at the end. Also added garlic.  Add 1 Tbsp of worcestershire with the mustard.  Also can use cream cheese with the sour cream.

Wow!!! This was terrific.  We made a few changes based on other reviews and what we had on hand.  We used sirloin tip roast,  about 2 tsp Dijon mustard, added a tbsp of  Worcestershire,  and 3 cloves crushed fresh garlic.  Also- skipped the white wine though I am sure that would have been delicious.  This will be our go to recipe from now on.

Really great!  I marinaded the beef in garlic and some red wine, then when ready to cook, I cooked the beef (this would be great with ground beef too ), set aside and cooked chopped onion, in some butter (next time i would cook the mushrooms and onion together).  I dissolved the flour in the broth and then that was added to the skillet adding back in the beef.  There wasnt enough liquid so i added some water and a bit more wine so that the (fresh) mushrooms could cook down some.  At the end, I added about (1/3 c each for regular portion recipe), two heaping tbs of sour cream and two tbs of cream cheese (for half the recipe).  Also added 1/2 tsp of dijon mustard.  This was excellent served over noodles.  Next time though, id cook the mushrooms with the onions, and definitely no need to simmer for an hour!

This turned out amazing and extra tender! I bought fresh beef pieces that were already cut for stew and it eliminated a little of the prep time.

I marinated in red wine for several hours before  cooking.  I added garlic and regular onion.  I used half cornstarch and half flour, and mixed it with some beef broth and red wine before adding it to the meat.  Added 1 tbsp Worcestchire sauce with the 1 tbsp of dijon mustard.  No mushrooms.  I added some cream cheese, maybe 4 oz, instead of sour cream.  I think if I make it again, I will just dump it all in the crock pot so the meat is more tender, adding the cream at the end.

I used Beezlys' additions of Worcestershire sauce, garlic, fresh mushrooms sauteed with the onions, marinating the meat in wine, and the added cream cheese.  I also used a bit of seasoned salt, and served them on homemade egg noodles.   Yummmmm!!!!

Followed the top reviewer's advice to marinate the meat in wine, I used sirloin. I also added the cream cheese, didn't use the white wine, and added garlic like suggested. My husband has been asking me to make this for 5 years and I don't like beef stroganoff so I kept putting it off but after having this I want more!

I have made this several times; it is really good.  I use fresh mushrooms instead of canned and sometimes skip the white wine if I don't have any at the house.  Also, I like to use London Broil instead of the chuck roast; it is less fatty and easier to slice.

I have tried multiple stroganoff recipes and have always been disappointed.  This one, however, was amazing!  I think marinating in the red wine has a lot to do with it.  This will be my go-to stroganoff recipe from now on.  Very tasty!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I have only made it once and I think I need just a little more tweaking on the spices.  It is the best one I have found though.  This is not an easy dish to prepare.  Well, maybe it is for some people, but a chef I'm not.  I just love good food!

Used red wine instead of white and it added a rich flavour. Easy to make but does take an hour to cook. Great company dish.

I went ahead and followed the top posts' modifications, very tasty. Added in the 1/3 wine at the end despite marinating for an hour, maybe next time I won't, it was a bit floral. *note to self, don't try mixing the HOT beef broth in a dish with the corn starch/flour. It cooks it. >.

I too marinated the meat in the suggested red wine mixture. The dish was very flavorful and I would only change the type of beef. The chuck was tough. Next time I'll use a premium meat like sirloin.  Other than that the dish was delicious!

I added yellow onion and garlic to the meat as it was cooking.  The wine made the sauce thinner than I would have liked.  I think I will add less wine than recommended.  Another person said that they marinate the meat in the wine before cooking it--this may work too.

My mother-in-law was a wonderful cook, her Beef Stroganoff was the best.  After a few very small changes, this recipe tops hers.  I mixed 1 Tbs. Worcestershire sauce with the 1 tsp. of mustard.  I substituted 2 Tbs. of corn starch for 2 of the 4 Tbs. of flour and I added 2 large cloves of minced garlic.  I sauteed 8 oz. of fresh mushrooms (sliced) in lieu of canned.  Thanks Donna for sharing a great recipe.  One last comment:  It is a little time consuming.  Next time I'll do some of the slicing in advance and even saute' the mushrooms earlier in the day.

My family loved this.  I did omit the white wine due to the fact that I marinated the beef in red wine prior to cooking.  I had a from scratch recipe that USED to be my sons favorite and took a lot of time and effort.  He prefers this one and says I can toss the other!

Really good!  I made it w/ ground beef (actually bison) which I as described in first steps so I didn't need to simmer it for an hour- it would have dried out on my stove if I had.  I sauteed raw sliced crimini mushrooms with truffle salt and truffle oil and that gave it an extra flavor.  I also used low fat sour cream and you really don't need much if any butter if you want to be a little healthier.  It was really good. I served it over egg noodles, but my husband (who is watching his carbs) pulled out mostly meat/mushroom and felt I could have served just that.  That might be better for those watching carbs.  I bet you could throw in some raw spinach, cook it w/ mushrooms and include more good greens that way.  Yummy!

I made this and it was awesome.  I followed the tip from BEEZLYS to add 1/3 Cup of cream cheese.  I used Sirloin Tip roast (glad I did).  The only thing I could have done differently in the future is make it saucier when adding extra meat and pasta like I had.

After reading many, many reviews, I made this with the following changes:  I marinaded my beef strips in white wine and minced garlic for 2 hours before proceeding with recipe and omitted the addition of wine later in the recipe; I used chopped white onion in place of the green onion, I used fresh mushrooms in place of canned and sautéed them with the onion, I used 2 T flour and 2 T cornstarch, I added a 1/2 T of Worcestershire sauce to the mix, and I added 1/3 cup of cream cheese.  This is not a dish I'd make frequently as we really don't eat a lot of noodles or other carbs, but every now and then, this is a winner with the changes.  Very tasty!

This was very yummy.  My husband could taste the white wine and said he'd prefer a little less next time but of course he still had two helpings of it.  Will make again!

This a great recipe! The only thing I would do different next time is to marinate and tenderize the meat . It was kinda tough.

Delicious.  After reading some of the other reviews, I added minced garlic to the meat.  Next time, I would be likely to use more sour cream.

I make this recipe as well and have for many years. My only change is in using regular onions and I brown the mushrooms , I use fresh mushrooms. The fresh mushrooms seem more flavorful and produce their own juice as opposed to the can or jar.

Made this for me and my wife, and it's  good! Only thing I switched was the mushrooms. I got some  baby portobellos and sliced and sautéed them in butter before adding them.  Very flavorful and if you like stroganoff I'm sure you'll be a fan as well.   We will revisit this recipe.

Delicious! Made as directed, except I used sweet onion instead of green, and chicken broth in place of wine. Fantastic flavor. I served over wide egg noodles and a side of sweet peas.

Good, flavorful, and easy.  I used fresh Crimini Mushrooms instead of canned, and added them in during the last 10 minutes.  Mixed the flour into the wine before adding the liquid, then added the Sour Cream.  Finished it of with 2 more tbsp. of butter and fresh chopped parsley.

I have used this recipe several times and really like it.   I don't always follow it to the letter.   I  often end up using what I have around the house, such as a different cut of meat, yellow onions, red cooking wine,  or fresh mushrooms.  I also like to add extra sour cream and black pepper to taste; but I find that this is a good basic recipe to use as a guide.

Made no changes.  Tasted good as written.  My kid has not had good luck with stroganoff and didn't want to eat this. But it smelled good and she tried it- then had seconds! It was easy and tasty!

I'm giving this 4 stars even tho I haven't actually made it yet because it is almost the same as my family recipe which we have loved for generations. The difference is I combine the flour, salt, pepper and garlic powder and dredge the beef in the flour mixture before browning. I, like others, brown the beef in batches. I also use a combination of butter and olive oil, adding more as needed. I use round steak and stick it in the freezer for a few minutes to make it easier for slicing (in strips against the grain)  I don't know what Chuck is, but we don't have that cut in Canada. Round is a (fairly) cheap cut and slowly simmering makes it so tender. I also use chopped yellow onions, adding them with the beef broth. We have always served it over rice and it is one of my go-to's for a fancy dinner.  Now that the kids are grown, I'm looking forward to trying this with wine. Sorry for the long post

Canned mushrooms are OK. Fresh are better. I make this with elk since that is what is available in these parts. This recipe makes a gamey old bull palatable enough to serve to guests.

I made it without the wine, and it still tasted great! My husband has never had stroganoff before and loved it. Reminded me of the recipe my mom used when I was growing up. Very rich and savory!

Yum! Worth the effort.  The only change I made was using red wine instead of white and adding it with the broth, so the beef cooks in it.

I am not a mushroom lover so just left them out.  I used homemade veggie broth instead of beef broth.  Also didn't have enough beef so used some hamburg.  Came out great.  Will certainly make again.

Very good.  I only had yellow onion so that's what I used. I left out the wine.  Added the mushrooms after the onions cooked. I also added 1/3 cup cream cheese along with the  1/3 cup sour cream.  To the leftovers, I added Parmesan, fresh ground pepper, and seasoned salt which made it even better.

Made this with the usual revisions others had suggested, it was good but not over the top great. The wine is probably the only thing that gave it a little twist on flavor. Good, but I'll keep my old recipe.

Very good. Make sure you salt and pepper it.  Mine was under seasoned.   I liked that it only has a minimal amount of sour cream.  I made homemade Egg noodles and it turned out very well.

This was very good.  However adding the flour dry to the juices caused lumps.  Next time I make this I will dissolve the flour in some of the beef broth before adding it.  Also, I added the white wine and 2 can's of mushrooms along with the broth so everything cooked at one time.  I did not have green onions so I used part of a regular yellow onion and it was fine.  I added the sour cream at the end as suggested and served it over top of egg noodles.   Everyone including my picky 3 year old ate this and loved it.

I hated Beef Stroganoff in the past.  Could not stand it.  But, my husband loved it and always wanted in during the winter time.  I found this recipe and now I am hooked!  So flavorful!  It is the best stroganoff recipe I have ever had.  A keeper!!

I saved this to my favorites because I will definitely make this again!  I just made it for my daughter and son-in-law, and there wasn't a morsel left.  Since I didn't have scallions, I substituted a thinly sliced leek instead.  Also, I used fresh mushrooms in place of canned.  I used a large electric frying pan and had to thin it out a little adding about a 1/4 cup of water halfway through the cooking process.  In the end, the consistency was perfect!  Thank you for a great recipe!

I thought this was a very good basic recipe.  Like others, I used top sirloin and added 1/3 c cream cheese and 1/3 c sour cream.  For my taste, the next time I make this I'll substitute a little red wine for some of the beef stock and will add a little more mustard.  Instead of simmering on the stove, I put it in the crockpot for an hour and a half and that seemed to work very well.  I'll definitely make it again.

Took another's advice and marinated in red wine an hour before cooking.  I also cut down the butter to 1/4 cup to save a little fat/calories.  Taste was still fantastic...Rave reviews from family!

I made this exactly as the recipe read, and it was really tasty!  Next time I may leave out the wine - I think it would be just as good without it and I'm not that big a fan of the wine flavor in my food.

Delicious. I'll definitely be making this again - it doesn't take long to prepare, but allowing it to simmer definitely softened the meat considerably.

Used a good chuck roast, cut off fat and gristle. Used dijon mustard and skipped the beef broth, using water instead. Added fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Used red wine instead of white. A bit of extra sour cream did nicely.  After browning, only cooked for about 20 minutes. One hour would dry the meat out too much for my liking.  The beef was very tender after 20 minutes, served on top of extra-wide egg noodles. Very good recipe.

I really only modified the steps, not so much the ingredients.  I used very thin steak and omitted the butter altogether.  Reviewers suggested a few things, so I did as they did. I marinated the beef in 1/3 cup wine  with 1Tbsp of Worcestershire while I read up on several more reviews, and as I prepped the other ingredients.  In olive oil, I browned the meat together with the green onions & 2 garlic cloves. The wine with Worcestershire remained in the bowl I used, so I added 2 Tbsp of flour & 2 Tbsp cornstarch to that, dissolved it & added that mix to the meat/onions still in the skillet. I used 1/2 tsp concentrated beef broth (Superior Touch Better Than Bouillon Beef Base) & just added enough water as needed, then the sour cream at the end.  I served it over bow tie pasta.

I used rotini noodles to make it easier to eat. Served it in bowls by the campfire. Everyone loved it and had seconds.

Maybe the beef I had didn't have much flavour (It happens!) but I found that this recipe really lacked flavour.  It was looking so good in the pot... it smelt amazing... but the flavour was not there.

Didn't like it, made it exactly as stated. I had to doctor it up too much. I also sprinkled with mozzarella cheese before serving.

I made this but with lots of fresh mushrooms and I didn't have white wine so I used white wine vinegar.  It was really good, a bit tart, but I imagine that was due to my substitution. Have made this quite a few times and will keep making it!!

I've made this a few times and it's really yummy!! Super easy and delicious.  I've used organic beef broth and the condensed beef broth it calls for (I don't like using msg) and couldn't really taste the difference.

Love this recipe! Always make it with leftover roast! Use fresh mushrooms instead of canned and cook them with the onions. I mix the flour with some beef broth in a shaker before I add it as it dissolves better! I also use more broth than it calls for to make more sauce! Other than those few changes its a delicious recipe! I never liked beef stroganoff until I made this! Now it's a staple in our house!

I made this as written and added a shake of garlic powder and Worcestershire. It was delicious, and I think it would have been fine without those additions. I read other reviews that said it had way too much butter. You need the butter for the 4Tbsp of flour in order to make the roux. You can't taste the butter as long as you are following the directions as written.  This was very quick prep time and I was able to do other things while it simmered. My kind of meal!

Great! Few modifications (some based on other reviews) - yes to the cream cheese!, accidentally added chicken broth and it still turned out fine (although I had some beef broth as well), and if you have high end mustard, such as those flavored with tarragon, it is an amazing touch! I also used a roast and cooked it whole, and then sliced, as with previous versions the beef has been overcooked. Delicious!

My whole family loves this recipe.  We use fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and grape juice or white wine vinegar instead of the white wine.  Otherwise, this recipe is perfect as it is.

This recipe was a big hit with the family.  I doubled the beef broth (& flour) to make more gravy. I also substituted fresh mushrooms for the canned  Turned out great!  Next time I will try cooking the meat in my slow cooker crockpot to tenderize the meat a little more.

Wish I would have gotten a better cut of beef-- it was not tender at all... but that's all my fault. I used a steak rub on the meat before cooking it and used fresh baby bella mushrooms. Also probably put a little more sour cream than needed, but it was delicious!!

Delicious as is! The wine did thin it out a little, but that's fixable next time. I'll double it too as there were no leftovers. A keeper.

Amazing! I used this recipe as a way to use up a round steak. Following one of the comments I used 1T Worcestershire sauce, 1T garlic, and added 1/3c sour cream, 1/3c cream cheese, and 2 cans of mushrooms. Love it! Definitely a keeper!!

Used double cream in place of soured, yellow onions and 2 cloves of garlic and a little less, 2 tablespoons, of flour reducing the sauce when cooked, served with pasta, superb, enjoyed by the whole family

Didn't make any huge changes to the recipe. We used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and a few more green onions. We had it over noodles, but I imagine rice would be excellent too.

Not impressed by this dish. It was a lot of work for little taste. Fortunately, I only made it for myself so I don't have to worry about serving it to others. I found the sauce to be very runny and the directions to be a bit skimpy.

I was a bit leery of the stated cook time, but I got a decent sized chuck roast and dove in. It's a surprisingly easy recipe, with most of my effort centered around trimming the meat. The chuck roast I got took a lot of effort to clean up, but the finished result was worth it.

I would guess it takes 10-15 minutes from the start of cooking to the 'simmer' phase, then just check on it every 10-15 minutes. The end result was tender and flavorful meat with a nicely balanced sauce. I served it over egg noodles and the family devoured it. I would say the recipe is for 6, and I didn't put in mushrooms.

I love beef stroganoff but my husband only tolerated it until now.  This was fabulous...amazing flavors and the chuck roast (who knew?!?) was so tender and delicious.  I cut the butter in half.   I chunky chopped a regular onion, instead of the green onions  I used 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and 2 of flour mixed in with the condensed beef broth before adding it to the pan.  Chopped up some garlic, about 4 cloves.  Added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire.  I did use a can of mushrooms but also used 2 portobello mushroom caps.  I upped the sour cream to 1/2 a cup and added 1/3 of a cup of whipped cream cheese.  I left out the white wine because I marinated the meat in red wine for about 30 minutes.  I didn't cook it all in the pan, I stink at that.  I flash cooked the meat.  Took it out, sautéed the onions, adding the mushrooms when the onions were about 1/2 done.  Added the garlic about 1 minute before the onions and mushrooms were good.  Then threw everything else in the pan (except sour cream and cream cheese) and covered and simmered for just over an hour...adding the sour cream and cream cheese off heat.  Amazing.

Made this with Beezlys adaptations: marinade meat in red wine, add Worcestershire sauce and cream cheese. Yellow onion instead of green. The only other thing that needed changing was that 4 tbsp flour was too much for the amount of beef broth. It was really thick and goopy. But it needed more sauce than the amount of beef broth made. By the time I thinned it out with additional broth it was right thickness and quantity. Probably used twice or more the amount of broth

Rich, filling & tasty! My spouse hates green onions, so I used a tablespoon of dried minced instead. I added some frozen peas for color & they gave the dish a well-rounded flavor. Mine had become salty somehow - I used boullion & may have measured wrong. In the end the peas & noodles balanced it out. Next time I'll try subbing some olive oil for butter in the roux and maybe add some garlic.

This recipe is wonderful as is, but we love garlic in our house so I added a heaping tbsp. I've now used several different kind of roast (whatever happened to be on sale) and it turned out great with all of them. Even my 2 year old cleaned his plate. Leftovers, if you have any, taste just as good if not better, so make lots!

This was so amazing and easy! I took the others advice and added two gloves of garlic, a little bit of fresh rosemary, and used fresh mushrooms. I also doubled the sauce so we had lotsa gravy for the potatoes and bread.

This recipe is fantastic! I only wish I could give it move stars. I did as others requested and used red wine. Also, I used my crock pot. When using the crock pot I found it was thicking up really fast so I put about 1/2 C heavy cream to the mixture. You talk about rich and of course more fattening, but it was so delicious.

I would never use chuck roast or steak unless I ground it.  It tends to be tough even with lengthy cooking.  Also the true flavor of stroganoff is destroyed with wine.  It overpowers the sour cream which by itself at the end is quite adaquate to give a delicate and delicious flavor.  Also be aware that use of canned broth leads to sodium overload.  This recipe was completely inedible.  I do not recomment this at all.

Fantastic! I doubled the recipe and used stew meat that was already trimmed very well and on salel,I cut into strips and marinated overnight in white wine,used yellow onion and simmered the mushrooms with the meat. Otherwise I stayed close to the recipe. My children are back in town for easter,4 sons and a daughter,so there were about 10 of us all together last night. Not a drop left! My oldest son asked if we could change easter dinner from prime rib to this, I make a pretty mean prime,so that was a high compliment for this recipe

This was so good and everyone loved it. I quadrupled this because we had a lot of meat and so many people here and I wanted some leftovers. I did two things slightly different.  I used half the amount of sour cream and then half cream cheese per some reviews to make it creamer. It was delicious. The only other thing I did differently is I cooked it in a pressure cooker and it was done much faster and really tender. I will definitely make this again.

I too think this is the best beef stroganoff I've ever had, and I think it's the mustard.  I used Kosciusko's spicy brown mustard. I also added about 1/8 cup of Marsala and used Chalone Chardonnay as the main wine.

This is my first time ever making this and it was wonderful! My boyfriend and I have a rating system for new foods and he gave it a 3, which is perfection. I made some of the suggested changes which was to add garlic and marinated the meat with a little bit of Worcestershire. Loved it!

This is a very good beef stroganoff recipe. If the flavor is too bland for some adjust as you go along. Anyone who cooks dinner most nights and is good at it, taste as they go! So if something is bland its the cooks fault not the recipe. But that's just my opinion!

It was ok.  Felt like it was missing something, even with garlic added and marinating the beef in red wine.  Oh, and don't use anything but chuck roast if you're going to use a roast ... tougher sides of meat don't work for a short cooking time.

Great recipe! My husband is not very fond of saucy meats but he loved this one. As recommended by another reviewer,I also marinated the beef in wine & and used yellow onions. Definitely a keeper!

This one was a drool recipe. What's amazing is that I was distracted while making it, botched the directions, and it still was great. So....for those wondering how this is possible, I think a really good recipe can be messed up, and come out shining. I did marinade the beef (in my case, sirloin strips) for two hours in apple juice (no wine, but it is a great substitute), 1 Tbs Worcestershire sauce, touch of black pepper, salt, and garlic powder. Then drained before frying. I mixed the whole sauce at one time (I told you I was distracted). 4 Tbs of cornstarch in 1/4 of the beef broth--let it sit after mixing. The rest of the sauce ingredients went into another bowl to mix--including the sour cream. Well, I WAS distracted.....Despite a bit of worry, I did add the garlic and 1/3 cup cream cheese (I had whipped). So into the sauce mix went garlic, cream cheese, black pepper, salt, beef broth, mustard (spicy brown), few drops of Worcestershire, touch more apple juice, and sour cream. Once that mixed, I dropped in the mixed cornstarch/broth mix. I heated 2 Tbs of butter, and slammed in the beef to brown. And, in a small frying pan, 1 Tbs butter and the maya sweet onion. Once cooked, I dropped the meat and onions into a strainer to drain. I left the meat drippings, and added the sauce, heating to boil, and cooked it down. In came the meat and onions; one hour simmer, and perfect. Delicious recipe, and came through in the clinch of my wandering.

This was so good! I used top sirloin and yellow onions and garlic. I took the advice of the 1 tbs of Worcester sauce when adding the mustard and adding 1/3 cup of cream cheese with the sour cream. I did not have white wine, so I added Marsala and it was very good! Will do this one again soon.

This recipe is awesome.  Easy to make and so worth it!  I did let it simmer several hours and I used sirloin tip steak cut which was divine.  I used fresh mushrooms and everyone raved.

Very very tasty with rice!  I tenderized meat in light bear 1,5 day in refrigerator, and I recommend do the slices of meat very thin. My kids said the taste is like secret souse of Mac Burger;)

Really tastey, easy and worth every minute it takes!! My husband made this using venison tenderloin (without even soaking in buttermilk first), and it was excellent. We'll definitely make this again and again. Might try just a little more mustard next time for a tiny bit more tang, but it was very enjoyable just as written. Thanks Donna!

Great recipe! Only alterations I made were: 3.5 chuck roast trimmed of fat, 1 cup white wine, fresh mushrooms cooked with the onions and per other suggestions 1 tsp worcestershire sauce.  I also used dijon mustard.  Everyone loved it!

This is a GREAT recipe, and I modified it to work with hamburger. No doubt it will taste even better with better meat, but I had the burger on hand. I followed the suggestions of onion (I used 1/4 red), and garlic (about 4-5 fresh cloves). Here's how I made it, but I'm sure it can be done many different ways: browned the burger. In separate pan, cooked mushrooms, onion and garlic with some olive oil. Threw some wine in there, because I felt like it. After they cooked down, I added it to the burger. Then I made a roux with some butter and flour, and added the broth to that (more wine too, OBVIOUSLY :), cooked it until it thickened, and then added that to the meat. After it was thickened, I added the cream cheese, dijon mustard and sour cream. Oh - so GOOD. I actually added more mustard to my plate, because I like that flavor, but you can add more or less depending on your preference.

To die for!  I make a huge pot roast the night before I make this, and use the leftovers for this.  I serve it over egg noodles.  I don't usually buy wine for it, though; I just use extra beef broth.  We don't drink wine, so the rest of the bottle would be wasted.  Still amazing!  EDIT:  I've made this recipe many times, and I've added a few tweaks to it.  Green onions are great, but if you don't have them, white are just fine if you saute them beforehand.  You can use fresh mushrooms if you do the same thing.  I add a little extra flour because I like my sauce thicker.  I've used beef bouillon cubes and water in a pinch on nights I've run out of beef broth.  And I added the white wine for the first time tonight.  Although it tastes good without it, it goes on up to the next level with it!  Good over potatoes as well as egg noodles.

I actually used ground beef, regular yellow onion, and fresh mushrooms since that is what I had on hand, but this was still very good. It will be so much better with roast, but it's great with ground beef if that's what you have!

Love this!  Just a few changes made.  I used sirloin because that's what I had on hand.  I used two cans of Campbell's French Onion soup instead of beef broth.  I also used fresh mushrooms and served it with egg noodles and a crusty french baguette!

Great recipe, I couldn't find condensed beef broth, i used a can of beef consume instead. I also followed the recommendation by fellow reviewers to marinate the strips of meat in red wine and omit the wine at the end. I added water as needed to keep it with some broth, at end added 1/3c sour cream, 1/3c cream cheese as other reviewers said. Next time I will use 1/3c greek yogurt and only 1/4c cream cheese. Either way it was good, it would have been just as tasty without the dairy at the end.

I made a few changes, and I really enjoyed the end result! I used one small onion and two shallots in place of the green onion (only because I didn't have any green onions on hand). I used four cups of beef stock instead of the condenced beef broth, fresh mushrooms in place of the canned and skipped the wine.

Terrific recipe, thank you! I served this on a mash of rutabaga, parsnips and carrots and used organic beef base (about 2 tbsp) mixed with 1 cup of water and cut the butter in half to make this as healthy as possible...it really was delicious.

Tried this tonight--turned out wonderful!  I didn't have scallions, so I just used regular onion, and fresh 'shrooms.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  YUM!!!

This a restaurant quality beef stroganoff, maybe even more so. I did not add anything or take anything else away from this recipe. It is wonderful as it is. My entire family loved this and told me to keep this recipe.

Loved the sauce but could have cared less for the beef. I marinated the beef in the wine with garlic for 1.5 hours. Fried fresh mushrooms then a sliced white onion before browning the beef. Used cornstarch instead of flour and had to add a beef boullion cube for more flavour. Left out the wine because of the marinade. Served over egg noodles. Would make again without the beef.

I used leftover cooked chuck roast so didn't have meat juice to thicken; used the beef broth instead which thickened up just fine. Left out the white wine.  Very tasty!!

Felt like it was missing something. It was a good taste, but the sauce was a bit runny. I'll have to reduce it further in the future.

I made this with elk, cooked it all day, and used tips from other reviewers. Also added about a T of Kitchen Bouquet. Wonderful! I gave it 5 stars because i always adjust recipes. This one is a perfect basic stroganoff, and probably is great on its own.

My husband &  I really enjoyed this ---fantastic flavor.  Marinated choice beef stew cubes in Sherry overnight; imparted a delicious flavor that shined through the final product.  Used fresh mushrooms and a medium-small yellow onion.  Thank you for a delicious recipe.

Excellent! With a single suggestion for soups,sauces and gravies.Use corn starch instead of flour.It doesn't kill the taste of any meat,spice or veg and it results in an absolutly silky smooth texture.

Really a very easy recipe to make but I did make a few changes.  I used both fresh and canned mushrooms along with a small can of cream of mushroom soup to add to the creamy-ness.  I also followed other reviews and added cream cheese and garlic.  I also added a little bit of horseradish to give it an extra flavor-ful kick.  Also, I used the white and green part of the green onions

My family loves this recipe! The only changes I make are to use a package of fresh, sliced mushrooms instead of the canned mushrooms. I cook them in the beginning with the onions (I usually use 1/2 of yellow onion, instead of the green onions as well). I also like to add a couple cloves of fresh garlic in with the onions & mushrooms and some dried basil with the salt & pepper. However, even without making any changes at all, everyone devours this dish & goes back for more :) To make the recipe really easy & to save time, I've also substituted ground beef for the chuck roast. Just brown the beef in the beginning, along with the onions & mushrooms, then follow the remainder of the recipe as is. This eliminates the hour of cooking time & dinner is ready in less than 15 minutes! Thanks, Donna, for a fabulous recipe!

So good.. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and used flour + cornstarch, sour cream + cream cheese, fresh mushrooms instead of canned, fresh garlic, a dash of Worcestershire sauce and marinated the beef for 2 hours in red wine.  I grew up with beef stroganoff and this recipe is delicious - served to friends who raved.

Yummy!  My whole family enjoyed it! I used leftover roast beef and left out the wine because I didn't have any. I also followed BEEZLY's suggestion and subbed in some cream cheese for the sour cream.  I put the beef broth and flour in a jar and shook it so I wouldn't have lumps. I also used fresh mushrooms because we like them and they were on sale.

This was excellent.  I only put in 1/2 of the wine and used Vidalia Onions instead of green.  I also used fresh mushrooms and added about 2 cloves minced garlic.  Very good!

My husband loved this, and he hates EVERYTHING.  I used half a white onion instead of the green onions because my green onions looked less than desirable and I used fresh mushrooms which I tossed in twenty minutes before it was done.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T.  I made egg noodles and tossed them in with it to coat and served.  I will be making this again for sure.

Made this for the first time and it was delish!  I''ve never made my own sauce for anything and it turned out great!  The only change I would make is adding more beef and cooking it longer.  I cooked it for over and hour but it was still chewy.  I'm going to slow cook it next time!

Thank You! This recipe was wonderful! It would have been much easier to prepare if my beef wasn't still mostly frozen, but otherwise, this was able to be made alot quicker than 1 hr 40 mins. Try it! The white wine is definitely a MUST!

I thought this was great.  The only issue I encountered was that I had to cook the beef for a lot longer than I was expecting.  It took an hour and 40 minutes for it to be tender enough to want to eat.  Maybe the difference between a gas vs. electric (which is what I have) stove for "simmering"?  I marinated the beef in red wine, worcestershire sauce, chopped garlic, salt and pepper for 7 hours.  I used a can of Campbell's french onion soup plus a little beef stock, half a yellow onion plus 2 scallions, and first sauteed the onions separately before adding after the flour was stirred in with the beef.  I left out the mushrooms altogether as I don't like them.  Delicious!

This was always my birthday dinner growing up. I lost the recipe, so am very happy to be making this tonight for myself! My mom always added at the end of the last five minutes a few ounces of tomato paste along the other ingredients. Delish!

This was so good that my kids asked for seconds, which is a rare thing in our house! I omitted the mushrooms because of allergies and added some chives because I just like them in my stroganoff. I'll add this to my regular recipes! Thanks, Donna!

This was a very easy recipe to follow especially for a novice cook. It turned out great. I skipped the wine because I did not have any. I was also 2 oz short on broth and used 1.5 lbs of beef. I added a a little extra sour cream....amazing. If I do it again, I am going to cut back on the butter to make it a bit  healthier. I am also going to try it with organic filet or sirloin. I did not stir it the whole time it was simmering so it separated and I had to try to get the sauce together again. I simmered it until the meat was cooked, not the full hour. In the recipie. Leftovers were great!!!

I use ground beef because it's faster, and leave out the onions and mushrooms because my family doesn't like them.  I do add in garlic and double the sauce.  I also add the wine a little earlier to cook out more of the raw alcohol taste.  One of our family favorites!

I made this using leftover sirloin steak sliced very thinly. It came out great! The kids and hubby all loved it. I followed the recipe exactly and served it over Dreamfields low carb rotini. It was delicious and there was only one little bowl of leftovers for me! A great family pleaser.

Fantastic as is. I skipped the egg noodles and served with mashed potatoes. Potatoes: Saute leftover onion greens and some garlic and canola oil in a medium pot, lightly mash in 3 large (already boiled) potatoes, add 2 Tbsp sour cream and salt + pepper to taste. YUUUUMMMM. Hearty, great with the suggested Shiraz.

My entire family loved this and everyone asked for seconds, including all 5 kids (all under 10)!! There were a few things I did different mainly because I didn't have all ingredients. I used ground sirloin, put in bowl after browning. Added a tbl of butter and sauteed the onion (I used 1/2 of a white one), 2 tbl minced garlic and freah mushrooms. Once all the water cooked out of mushrooms, I added beef back in, seasoned with salt and pepper then added almost 2 cups of broth(Made with bullion cubes and water) with 2 tbl of corn starch mixed into broth. Once it thickened I added stone ground mustard, 1/3 cup of sour cream and about 1/3 of a cup of cream cheese. Stirred til smooth. I seasoned with lots more pepper, garlic powder and paprika. I served it over macaroni noodles...definately a keeper!

Kids not mushroom lovers so probably used 1/2; otherwise followed recipe and whole family loved! Even my picky eaters!!  I did cut meat smaller which was easier to eat and cooked in less time so sauce didn't dry out.  Will definitely make again soon!!

I really liked this recipe, however I used ground turkey instead of beef. This cut my cook time down tremendously. I also used seasonal all instead of salt. Ground turkey typically is harder to season to perfection so to prevent over salting my dish season all is always perfect for me. My husband all really enjoyed the dish as well...

Great as is.  I have made it sevearal times and experimented.  I like it with a clove of chopped garlic, fresh mushrooms and a little Worcestershire sauce.  I browned the meat with olive oil instead of butter.  Very yummy.

I marenated in red wine as well, used fresh mushrooms added right after the onions, and used flat iron steak. Truly a remarkable recipe for "lesser" cuts of beef!

My mother made stroganoff when I was growing up. I loved it. Have not had it in years. This was pretty close. I did make a few changes. 
- Used fresh mushrooms and a whole onion. Sauted at the begining in a little olive oil and garlic and then set aside while I browned the meat.
- Used Sirloin because that is what I had on hand.
- Added some of the wine early to simmer with everything else and added the rest with the Sour cream at the end.

Could have used just a touch more mustard.

Will defintely make this again....the family ate it up.

Excellent!  I accidentally bought regular beef broth, so i just used 2cups of that. Also used a regular onion instead of a green one. Followed the recipeotherwise. It was so good!!

I made this stroganoff using ground beef.  It was very good!  My husband (who's favorite meal is stroganoff) loved it.  I used fresh mushrooms and corn starch, left out the mustard and wine and made my own broth with bullion.

First class recipe although I substituted the beef chuck roast with beef roladen which my butcher has on reduced price quite often, it has perfect thickness and I can slice it in strips and nice bite size pieces...I would certainly make this again and maybe increase the mustard to give it a bit more zip.

I made this for my dad and myself, it turned out fantastic! I salt and peppered sirloin streak to taste and marinated it in red wine for 1/2 hr. at room temp. I also added 1 large clove of garlic and more mushrooms!! This recipe is a keeper! Thank you.

Definitely Delicious! Very easy to make. This one is a keeper for sure. I used fresh mushrooms and browned them in butter before continuing with the recipe. I also made it once with leftover grilled sirloin tips and that was awesome. Added the cooked meat at the end just to warm through. Very easy to make and sure to be a crowd pleaser.

This was excelent! I used venison instead of beef because I wanted to get rid of some in our freezer. Did not taste gamey at all! 

The only thing I did differently is I used fresh mushrooms instead of the canned and I cooked them with the onions then deglazed with the pan with the wine. I also used olive oil instead of butter to make it healthier. And I used corn starch instead of flour and mixed it with half the broth before I poured it in the pan to avoid lumps.

Very very good!! Thank you!!

Great!!! My picky teenager had two plates full.  I used the ingredients as written, with a few additions, switches because I did not have some things.  Cooked the onions and mushrooms with a little butter.  Removed them from the pan, added the meat.  Once the meat is browned, remove.  Made a slurry and added it to the beef stock, mustard and Worcester sauce, bring to a boil then add all the onions, mushrooms and meat back into the pan.

Great Recipe!
I used fresh mushrooms and added the wine with the broth so the alcohol would be gone.  My family enjoyed it a lot and we will be making this again.

What a great recipe!  I altered it a bit when preparing it myself by substituting 2 large venison round steaks for the chuck roast and the end result was... well lets just say my tastebuds are in love! not to mention the friends' that helped sampled :)

Thanks Donna!

My wife is an avid Beef Stroganoff fan so when she asked me to make it for her birthday I found Donna's recipe. After her second helping, she said it was the best EVER! 
I followed the recipe except I added fresh cut garlic to the beef, fresh mushrooms, and yellow onion instead of green.
We definitely will use this recipe again and again. Great consistency and flavor.

This recipe is similar to the one that I have made for years, only I do not use mustard (allergic to it), and I add fresh basil, worchestershire, & garlic for more flavor.

Excellent recipe!  I used leftover steak that was cooked rare and I think that dramatically impacted the tender results we got.  I also increased the beef boulion to 2 cans and increased the sour cream to 3/4 cup.  We only simmered the meat 25 minutes total after we created the sauce and it was great.  If you start out with good meat that is slightly precooked, you don't need to simmer it the whole time.  My mother in law even raved about the meal, so, if she liked it, trust me, everyone will love it!  Enjoy!

Fantastic recipe!  By far the best beef stroganoff recipe and so easy to prepare.  I added a 1/4 c. of red wine instead of the white wine.  It thinned the sauce a little bit, but I could thicken the sauce with a little water and flour until it was the right consistency.  I also added about 1/3 c. of chopped red onion instead of the green onion, 1/2 t. of crushed garlic, 1 t. of dried parsley and 1/2 t. of worcestershire sauce.  My teenage son, who scrutinizes everything I make, had three servings.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

Ummm not that great I can do better at the cafe at the German center near me for less money and time. I thought too much sour cream and was what ever. Thats my opinion but my girl friend absolutely loved it and ran away with her plate in her hand when I approached her apparently thinking I was going to take it away from her. So what ever but I still would not spend the time making this again or the money wasnt worth it to me. She wont be eating this again period.

It was yummy and simple enough to make.  I made it with red wine and worcest. sauce, which was a great addition.  Green onions worked fine, whatever u have on hand.  This is probably bad to some people, but ground beef works if you need a last minute meal.  Strangely my husband actually prefers it to steak.

I hate to say it- I didn't love it. A lot of work- not a lot of taste. I followed the recipe exactly, except used sirloin instead of chuck. It does have good 'bones' though, and I try to take to suggestions from others who modified. Never saw white wine mixed with red meat before.

This was a great recipe.  I noticed that it had a nice thick sauce and then when I added the wine and sour cream it got watery.  I will add the wine sooner next time.  I also used fresh mushrooms and they were still firm when served.  We will be adding this simple meal to our routation.

This was fabulous!  I used fresh mushroom, vidalia onions and a bunch of garlic.  I also added  worchestershire sauce.  I simmered for the hour and put red wine in toward the end and the sour cream just before serving.

This is delicious! I had some filet mignon that my wife didn't want to eat as steaks. I scaled the recipe down to match and used chopped yellow onion instead of green onion. Both my wife and I loved the result. Excellent recipe.

This is definitely the best stroganoff recipe I've tried.  I used corn starch instead of flour, Dijon mustard and added the wine in early.  I also left out the mushrooms because the boyfriend doesn't like them.  It was still 100% delicious and I will make this over and over again.

Very nice flavors! I made this almost exactly as stated. I did use fresh mushrooms and added them with about 30 mins left in the simmering. I also added the wine with about 10 mins left to bring it to lite boil. Served over wide egg noodles. The family loved it! Thanks for the great recipe! It's a keeper!

I did three things differently only because I didn't have all the ingredients mentioned.  I used a different type of steak, used fresh mushrooms and omitted the white wine.  But it still came out delicious, even more so when served over egg noodles.  I cannot wait to make this over and over again and even serve it to my guests!

This was the first thing I ever cooked for my boyfriend and he loves it. It's so easy to do too. I've brought it with me to potluck dinners and people loved it.
The only change I made with it is th wine. I forgot to put wine in the first time I made it and have never put in since. I think I'll do it one of these days.

Oh. My. Goodness. This was so good, I only wish I had more leftovers. I never made beef stroganoff before, in fact, I haven't even had it since I was a kid I think. I used sirloin instead of chuck, marinated it in red wine for 30 minutes prior to cooking it, used a yellow onion instead of green, and no mushrooms (allergic). Served it on egg noodles. I was very surprised I liked it, as I was not expecting much. Good comfort food.

Awesome flavor!  My husband and I both loved this recipe.  I added worcestershite sauce with the beef broth.  I used fresh musrooms and added them right after I added the beef broth.  I disolved the flour in the beef broth.  Next time I'll try cornstarch - but the flour turned out just fine.

Recipe says simmer for an hour over low heat. After 30 mins meat was totally stuck to bottom of pan. A ruined dinner and a ruined evening. And what wasn't ruined was bland.

YUM!!!  I follow this recipe exactly but add slightly more sour cream.  Every Sunday when my husband and I are planning our weekly menu, he says, "How about making that Beef Stronanoff?"  It's way too fattening to eat that often but I make it once a month or so. Really delicious.

I agree with white onions instead of green. I also use Dijon mustard and I do add garlic as well. The rest of the recipe is great except that I do use corn starch instead of flour. This is an excellent recipe for anyone to try. I use freshly sliced Cremini mushrooms and parsley in the recipe as well. I cook the mushrooms with the onions and garlic and add the parsley at the end.

It was amazing!  I loved it and so did my family, including my picky 3 year old son!  I didn't have any green onions so I used a small white onion, chopped and I used the whole 14.5 ounce can of broth to make it extra saucy.  It was great I will be making this again soon for sure!!

Excellent. My hubby wasn't so sure of it when I said I was making beef stroganoff, but he stuffed himself when it was done! For the sake of economy, I use stew meat (already chopped, and it tends to be cheaper). I also find it's just as good whether you use wine or not. I also sautee the onions and mushrooms at the beginning and allow them to cook with the meat. Definitely going to be made again and again!

Receipe was good adding wine made the receipe sweeter than one would expect.  Choose a wine accordingly or elimate wime completely would be my suggestion.

This was excellent.  I did add 1T of flour to stablize the sour cream/wine mixture.  This helped the stroganoff sauce to remain rich and creamy without curdling.

I find this to be a simple yet delicious recipe. Since finding this recipe on AllRecipes.com just a couple months ago, I can honestly say I've made this at least 1/2 a dozen times. For a healthier alternative, I use low fat butter and low fat sour cream, and I use whole wheat or multi-grain noodles. It is FANTASTIC.

I got two hi-5's for this one---one from hubby and one from myself!  Took someone's comment to cut the butter to one tablespoon.  My sous chef (hubby while I went to get my nails done) cut the meat in chunks rather than strips so it took about two hours to cook but that made the anticipation delightful.  I used white wine (by mistake and early in the preparation) instead and it was just fine. I initially was leary because the meat doesn't really "brown".  It rather kind of steams because of moisture and even though I was using a large dutch oven pot, I felt like I didn't have a lot of room when I was stirring in the flour but every thing went just fine.  Just had to work on slowly mixing in the broth and flour - like making a white sauce.  The absolute necessary final and deal maker was the sour cream--it brought it all together flavor wise and visually.  Some hearty Pennsylvania Dutch noodles, Corn and Butternut Squash (Paula Deen recipe that I decided not to use corn in---yummy) and mini buttermilk biscuits)and life was good this Sunday night at the Kneer's.  Dog was bummed though because he could not have these rich leftovers - only us - and plenty of them!

I used a round steak, yellow onions instead of green, fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and red wine instead of white.  This was very good.  Served over wide egg noodles.  The only thing I would do differently is eat it fresh.  I made it a day ahead so that it was ready to go for dinner the next night when I wouldn't have time to cook.  I think it would have been even better fresh off the stove top.

I've made this recipe several times my sons keep requesting this dish for dinner. It's very good. Keep an eye on it while it's cooking to make sure that it doesn't stick to the pan reduce the heat if necessary.

Extremely full flavored, I used baby bella mushrooms for extra flavor but think the butter could be halfed and replaced with beef broth.

This was good. I took others advice to omit the white wine and add cream cheese. However, it was too thick and I added the wine, too. Next time I will not add the cream cheese and follow the recipe.

This was absolutely delicious. We did not use the mushrooms from a can but the fresher ones in the produce section and put them in 15 minutes before completed. The mushrooms and white wine added a slight vanilla flavor to the sauce. It reminded me of frementing wine. Next time I am going to marinade the roast to help tenderize the meat.

I followed the recommendations of many others -- marinated the beef in (white) wine for 2 days, added 1T garlic, 1T worcestershire, sauteed fresh mushrooms, 1/2 block cream cheese, etc.  However I still thought this was just okay and the meat was tough.  Next time I'll use red wine and a better cut of beef (sirloin).  I might also try cooking it in the crock pot for several hours to break the beef down more.  Compared to other stroganoff recipes out there, this has good enough bones that it's worth trying out again with the modifications above.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I could eat this once a week... it's that good!  I used top sirloin and fresh mushrooms.  Also added garlic, red wine, and one tablespoon Worchestershire.  Absolutely the best!  Thank you for this great recipe!

So delicious! We had to add quite a bit of salt afterwards, but it was wonderful. I can see how using a crockpot would be helpful (like in other reviews) - I will try that next time.

We really liked this, and I'll be making it again.  I didn't use the full amount of mushrooms, and I used red wine instead of white (didn't have any open white :)  )  I used slightly less meat (unintentionally; the roast was way fattier than it should have been, so I ended up with 1 1/2 pounds), so we had a good bit of extra gravy.  I liked it that way, so I will likely increase gravy ingredients next time I make it.    Great recipe, thanks!

OH. MY. GOODNESS!  This is delicious!  The RICH flavors transported me to some fancy restaurant, I couldn't believe I cooked it.  And it was SO easy.  I followed the suggestions of soaking the beef in wine before cooking, used fresh mushrooms sauteed with the sliced yellow onions and minced garlic glove.  I served it over steamed white rice.  My husband sprinkled sliced green onion tops on his.  I think fresh parsley would perfect it for me.  This one's going to be a staple for our family.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Loved the sauce. It came out great. I over cooked the beef when was browning it which was my fault, and if it were not for that it would have been perfect. I used 3/4 cup of wine and an extra can of mushrooms for personal preference. All around it is a great dish.

I used about 1/4 cup Dijon, and 3/4 red wine, and turned out AWESOME.  I didn't have any minced garlic, and will add that next time, but otherwise, this dish is delicious.  Rave reviews from my fiance and his brother!

This is wonderful.  The only changes I made were to use Grey Poupon mustard and instead of pushing things to the side (even with my 12" Calphalon pan) I removed them to a plate, and I added the canned mushrooms for the whole cooking time.  This is a regular on my monthly menu.

This was VERY good.  Although, I would not cook the beef "quickly".  This made it tough.  Slow cook the beef to about medium-rare and then proceed with the recipe in order to make the beef tender.  All in all though, this was a winner at my house!

Loved this recipe. Followed suggestion of marinating chuck beef in white wine and adding garlic, but otherwise followed recipe exactly. Served over broad egg noodles. Very very yummy.  Would try again, but might marinate in red instead of white wine

This came out beautifully using creme fraiche instead of sour cream (I had some left over from another recipe earlier in the week).  I also used raw mushrooms instead of canned (sauteed to soften).  Delicious served over egg noodles.

Very good, very easy.  We like mushrooms so instead of canned ones I used 12 ounces of fresh.  I also used an entire 16 ounce tub of Sour Cream instead of the wine.

Minor changes based on earlier feedback. Added chopped garlic along with green onion. Added Worstershire along with beef broth. Cooked up canned, sliced mushrooms along with beef for 1hr. 1/3 C cream cheese & 1/3 C. sour cream added at the end. After browning the meat, removed it from the pan allowing the broth and disolved flour to soak up the pan juices - meat then returned for 1hr simmer.

This is WONDERFUL!!! I used white onions, did`nt have the green on hand. I have venison in the freezer so used that. I added the sherry I had on hand with the fresh mushrooms & added some garlic powder. I followed the recipe the way it was written with the few substitutions. I will be making this recipe for now on. YUMMMMM!!

Just what I was wanting, and probably my 61 yr old mom's recipe that I ate growing up!  I made some adjustments though to the original recipe. 1) Didn't have beef broth so I improvised with 3 bullion cubes disolved in the same amount of recommended liquid. 2) I did use yellow onion, garlic, and equal amounts of sour cream and cream cheese, and 3) I marinated my beef (stew meat was what I had on hand) in some red wine for only about 30 min and still added a white wine in the sauce.  Drawbacks, it was so good I wish I had more sauce.

My family LOVES this dish! I followed suggestions others posted by adding white onions and fresh mushrooms. I've made it several times and I find it's best without the wine. Makes the sauce to thin and runny. I also tried using less butter and light sour cream and it was still great. Going to try nonstick cooking spray next time as some users suggested. Also going to try Fage 0% nonfat greek yogurt instead of sour cream. It's so smoothe and creamy and I think it should be even better than sour cream. Thanks for the excellent recipe!

This is a great recipe, but next time I'll make sure I have the wine because I do feel it was lacking without it.  I wouldn't make it again if I was missing the wine.

This had such a wonderful flavor. I thought I had condensed beef broth but did not so I had to use condensed chicken broth. I was really worried but the flavor was delicious! My 18 month old even loved this and kept asking for more!

Wonderful Recipe! (because of what I normally have in my kitchen I made a few changes, the original recipe is great too) I use ground turkey instead of chuck roast, one yellow onion in place of the green onions and sub sherry for the white wine. Delicious!! My kids and husband love it.

Very good!  Especially liked the tang of the mustard, I used dijon.  For the beef I used rib eye as that's what I had on hand.  Used fresh sliced mushrooms, regular yellow onion and added a clove of garlic.  Other than that followed everything else.  Thanks for the recipe.  I'll surely use it again.  Tasty comfort food and simple to prepare.

We really liked this recipe except the wine really watered down the sauce at the end.  Instead simmer with the wine so the alcohol and extra water with evaporate out.  We also added 1/2 a cup of sour cream to make the sauce a little thicker.  Overall a nice change for a basic recipe.

I used round steak instead of a roast for easier slicing and since you let it simmer for tenderness it never really made any difference. I couldn't stop eating this it was so good and neither could my children. I couldn't believe it! However, I was almost undone at the thought of how much butter I added but, oh my, how it added to the flavor.

I mostly followed the recipe as is except that I omitted the mushrooms since I don't like them. My husband didn't care for it (he likes the packaged kind better) but I thought it was good. Not as flavorful as I would have expected but I would make it again.

I prepared this exactly as written and found that it really lacked any flavor.  The meat was tender, however it was really bland.  I always make the recipe as intended and was not inspired.  I think with a lot of tweaking it could make a nice meal.

Outstanding!  I followed the directions exactly, except used top sirloin (which really shouldn't make that much of a difference).  Made it a couple times, and just use whatever beef is on sale.  This takes a while to make but it is SOOO good!

This was great! I used some Top Round as that was what I had on hand and red wine instead of white but the basics for this recipe are a winner!

Used previous user suggestions of 1/3rd cup cream cheese and used fresh mushrooms thrown in from the beginning. We also marinated the beef in red wine for about two hours. Tasted really tender when reheated the next day! Yum!

My parents live in a retirement community and rarely cook, so they were thrilled went I brought this over for dinner one night.  They loved it, said it was the best beef stroganoff they've ever had, and my mom used to make a mean beef stroganoff herself, so that's saying a lot about this recipe!  I'm definitely making this again.

Really nice! The sauce was a tad bit thinner then i would of liked, but it could be because of the amount of noodles that were plated, still, i will make this again :)

Pretty good, I used fresh mushrooms and garlic - added the onions - it really added to the flavor of the sauce. I also used cream cheese and sour cream at the end - it seemed to be missing something. But still very good!

This was very good.  I sauteed fresh mushrooms with the green onion and simmered it all together for an hour.  It was the perfect consistancy.  Next time I will add more broth and less wine.  It was a bit too wine-y for me.

We have tried so many Stroganoff recipes and finally found the one.  I did make minor changes so I could use ingredients I had on hand.  I used sirloin tips but will use the chuck next time.  I also used fresh mushrooms and about half a large yellow onion.  I marinated the sirloin for about a half hour in white wine and then did not add any at the end.  I did add 1/3 c low fat cream cheese at the end with the 1/3 c. low fat sour cream.  I also used 2.5 ounces of butter to make it a little leaner.  Delish!!!

I did not stick exactly to the recipe, but tweaked it based on what I had on hand...it was delicious, and one I'll definitely make again. The substitutions I made were cooked ground turkey and fresh mushrooms. I served it over whole wheat noodles. I froze the remainder, and it reheated great! This will be added to my freezer friendly OAMC (Once a Month Cooking) rotation! Thanks for the great recipe that is easy to substitute with ingredients on hand!

I used a lot more beef broth during the simmering process. I also started with stew meat and used fresh mushrooms. We loved it.

This was pretty good, I did not follow the recipe to a T to adjust to what I had in the house. I used a whole white onion, Sirloin beef tips, worchester sauce, and less butter, light sourcream, spicy dijon mustard and fresh mushrooms. It came out good but it did take awhile to prepare. Will make this again.

This is lovely.  Aside from pushing the meat and then the onions off to one side - which seems difficult - I don't change a thing.  I eyeball ingredients, but close enough.  I prefer to use fresh mushrooms.  Also, I use fat-free sour cream, which tastes almost as good.  I use half the butter, which may make a difference, but not enough for an every-day meal -- for guests, I might use the full amount, as well as "fatty" sour cream to bring this to a more rich flavor.  Overall, if my family likes it, it wins.  One of these days, I plan to experiment with cayenne as an addition.  Who knows?

Yum! Had stroganoff in Russia, wanted to make something more authentic. This fit the bill!  I only added a few more onions, but as printed it was great!

This is the most amazing stroganoff. My husban doesnt like stroganoff, but he actually loved this recipe. We both ate until we were stuffed. Wouldnt change a thing to the recipe, it was perfect. This meal will be a regular for my family for sure.

Very good. I cheated a little.  Had some leftover grilled sirloin steak.  Sliced that up and shortened the cook time.  No green onion so used sweet onion instead. Otherwise followed the basic instructions.  Turned out well. Hubby had seconds, so I gave it a 5!

This is a really great tasting recipe!  And really easy to make, especially only using one pan!  I omitted the white wine only because I never have it on hand and replaced it with more beef broth.  All 3 of my young children loves this recipe!

Excellent!  True stroganoff flavor.  I used a small yellow onion, and marinated my beef in red wine before hand, omitted the wine at the end.  I also used fresh mushrooms.  I will make this a regular on my menu!

Used fresh mushrooms and half a small yellow onion. Tried as directed but even better with left-over steak (tri-tip, whatever). Husband commented several times how good it is and he rarely has any feedback about food.

This was very good.  I used regular onions instead of scallions, but other than that, I followed the directions as stated.  The only problem that I had was that I didn't have enough juices to stir the flour into, so I had some lumps.  But, that can be easily fixed next time.  The white wine really made the dish -- it didn't overpower it, it just added a nice subtle flavor in the background.  I just used cooking wine, but I bet it'd be even better with the real thing.  My boyfriend, who loves the usual way I make stroganoff (I didn't use a recipe, just threw stuff together), was disappointed when he realized I wasn't making it the "normal" way.  But, he seemed to really like it and I know I did  P.S.  I was thrown off by the picture.  It looks like that cook used ground meat and no sour cream.

My children liked this alot and the funny thing is they all claim to hate mushrooms! The only thing I left out was the wine and mustard didn't have any at the time.

I use fresh mushrooms and add a teaspoon or so of garlic to the meat while cooking.

My family liked the recipe.  I made it as it stated though I did scale it down a bit.  I ended up adding salt and then some garlic salt.  I would be willing to try it again.

Gave it 3 stars because there was a split decision about this dish. Partner really enjoyed it, I thought it too bland. Since I do the cooking I will continue the search for a better one.

Loved it.  I didn't have any ground beef so I used 12 oz of left over already cooked skirt steak from fajitas and soaked them in 1/2 cup of red wine for one hour and I used not so fresh sliced mushrooms sauteed in 3 minced cloves of garlic in  butter.  I added the mixture of meat and wine to the onions, mushrooms and garlic.  Following  the other chefs' suggestions I added  1 T worcestershire sauce,  1/3 cup of sour cream and 1/4 cup of cream cheese and nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste to finish.

Very good! For years I made stroganoff with tomato paste, cream of mushroom soup, and worcestershire. But this mustard style adds a great new dimension to the flavor and my family loves it! Beef turns out tender and I add lots of mushrooms. Also happy not to be dependent on canned soup. I sometimes add more mustard/sour cream and wine to make more sauce and always turns out great!

Made this a tasty 30 minute meal by using ground beef.  I cut the meat down a bit, added a bit more mushrooms, and used enough noodles for 4 people.  Yum-o!

What can I say, this dish was delicious!  I made a few modifications, I omitted the onions (don't like them) and didn't have wine.  I added more mushrooms (love them) and used more beef broth than the recipe called for.  It came out so yummy...this is definitely a keeper.  Thanks

I served this for my father-in-law's birthday celebration and everyone loved it!  Even my 5 and 3 year olds asked for more.  I used fresh mushrooms and added them for about the last 15 minutes of cooking time.  Also, I cut the butter by almost half and it was perfectly fine, so that upped the health factor.  YUM!!

This was so tasty, great recipe!! I did change it around a bit, I took the advice of other members and let the meat marinade in the wine. I used red wine instead of white and I also used extra lean ground beef because it's what I had on hand. I added galic while cooking the onions, then added 1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce after adding the broth; I also added 1/2 tsp of dry Tarragon & 1/4 tsp on Nutmeg...it came out great!! We had the leftovers for lunch today and it was just as good as last night!! Will definitely make this again!! Thanks for the great recipe!!

I loved this dish!  It was easy to prepare and tasted fantastic. I used some of the suggestions here like using yellow onions, cream cheese, etc.  The sauce was a bit thin, but that was probably my fault.  I didn't have condensed chicken broth so I just used regular chicken broth.

By far our favorite stroganoff recipe.  We love mushrooms and garlic so I added lots in at the beginning with the meat.  We didn't love the wine taste, so I omit the wine completely and add 2 oz of cubed fat-free cream cheese right at the end with the sour cream.  Makes for a fantastic meal- we never have leftovers!

Too much butter, the green onions get lost in the recipe, and I think fresh sauteed mushrooms would be better than canned. I expected the worst when I poured in the Campbell's condensed soup-- it did not smell good-- but the end product wasn't that bad. Not sure I'd make it again, but it was ok. The chuck roast cooked up very nice and tender.

Tasty Recipe! I used Top sirloin steak & marinated it in red wine for 2 hours. The meat came out tender. I also used cream cheese & sour cream as suggested by other reviewers. Great served over egg noodles!

Made this for Valentines day - came out great and we both liked it.  I left out the sour cream for my sweetie since he isn't into cream and he still loved it.  I did add it to my portion though and found it wonderful.  I added garlic while simmering the onion and used cornstarch instead of flour.  Very simple recipe with little hands on time if you buy pre-cut steak strips and fresh pre-cut mushrooms.

Used tri-tip, sliced thin, and cooked less than the recipe called for as the meat was done pretty quickly. Added shallots to the garlic and sprinkled with fresh parsley at the end for color. Had a lovely flavor, though it seemed like it needed something and the broth was a bit thin; otherwise a great recipe!

yummm! I don't think you even need the sour cream if you're watching calories. I marinated my meat in red wine as suggested.

Very good.  My partner says this is a 5 star and is her favorite.  I think it could use a tad more flavor.  Either way, a good recipe to keep in the rotation.

Excellent with the changes suggested by others. I did not marinate the beef but add the amount of wine using red; Used 1 big yellow onion instead of green; Add 1 TBSP minced garlic and 1 TBSP worchestershire; Add 2 TBSP cornstarch to beef broth before adding meat back to pan; simmer 1 hour; add 1/3 c. cream cheese and 1/3 c. sour cream at the end

I thought this was tasty.  We certainly didn't have any problems finishing it since we kept going back for seconds.  However, my husband insisted there was something missing from this dish...perhaps some rosemary.  He followed the recipe almost exactly except he used a slightly better cut of beef and he accidentally used too much sour cream (so it was extra tangy).  All in all, we'll definitely make this again.  Good easy comfort food for a cold day.

fabulous! just the way I had hoped it would turn out. I tasted awesome with just the right amount of sauce.  I did have to let it cook about 1/2 a hour longer so the meat was fork tender, but i cut it into large chunks, so it may have been an error on my part.

I had never made beef stroganoff before so I picked this one due to the reviews and simplicity.  My family LOVED it and we rated in nearly a 10 out of 10!  Of course this is fattening so it's something we won't have often.  Yummy!

This was a great hit for dinner, it was especially good with the cream cheese in it.  I followed others advice and marinated the beef in the white wine, it definitely made a difference and would do it again.

Very very yummy!! I think i would prefer it over rice instead of egg noodles though. I also added garlic and used yellow onions instead of green onions. I also mixed the flour in the broth before adding to pan so i wouldnt clump. I also used light sour cream and omitted the white wine and it was very creamy and rich still.
Overall will make again, thanks!

Excellent recipe.  For others that did not have enough liquid, marinating the meat and using all of the butter will result in plenty of liquid.  Used fresh mushrooms and 1/2 lite sour cream and 1/2 cream cheese.  Also used a yellow onion.

I used to see Beef Stroganoff all the time at my uni cafeteria, and I would look askance when I saw other students eating it.  I think I had it once on a transpacific flight because the other choice was fish.  Never eat fish on a plane.  But I decided to make it because my BF said he liked it and this recipe got such great reviews. I regret it--it was an unappetizing looking, bland pap.  It belongs in a college cafeteria.  It truly baffles me why it's rated so highly.

This was delicious.  I didn't add onions (my husband doesn't like them) and I found that I needed more broth. Maybe one can of concentrated broth and one can of water is needed? Next time I'll try what some other reviewers have suggested and add some garlic.

Loved this recipe!  I did change it up a bit.  Used top sirloin steak which decreased the cooking time by half. Used chanterrel mushrooms which I sauteed with the onions then added the meat and the flour and followed as directed after that.  The chanterrel mushrooms were wonderful in this dish.  I also cut the wine to 1/4 cup.  My family really enjoyed it and I almost didn't have any leftovers! Will definitely put this in my top 10 recipes!

This was really good and the meat definately has to cook an hour. The only thing I would change is the amount of butter. You only need 1/2 or less... Overall wonderful flavor and we will make this for along time!!

Thanks for the great recipe.  I use fresh sliced mushrooms, instead of canned and have omitted the green onions when they were not in the house.  Wonderfully forgiving of the changes.

Simply amazing, off the chain. I marinated the beef tips I used in red wine for two hours before hand but marinating overnight would be ideal. I also used fresh mushrooms. This is an amazing recipe people. Don't sleep on it!

Loved this! I made a few changes. I used 2lbs of meat (sirloin rather than chuck) and doubled the sauce ingredients.  I used one medium yellow onion plus the green onions and used fresh mushrooms (I hate canned).  I sauted the mushrooms for a few minutes before adding to the sauce. The addition of white wine really makes this dish.  Great flavor, this will be one of my regular recipes.

Wonderful, although I changed it a bit.  I used scraps from a beef tenderloin so I cooked the filet briefly, then removed it from the pan until the finish.  Also, I used fresh mushrooms and just added them when the onions were added.  The whole dish was done from start to finish in about 12 minutes.  Yummy!

My family really liked this.  I did make changes (I always do), so here goes.  First, I halved the recipe and used a sliced top round steak for the meat.  I used about a tablespoon of ghee (clarified butter) in lieu of the butter to prevent burning, and I used high heat for the initial meat searing.  I took another reviewer's advice, and plated the meat after the browning, and I used a white onion instead of the green ones.  I also added fresh mushrooms after the onions started to soften.  I didn't have condensed beef broth, so I reduced some regular broth with some red wine in the pan with the onions and mushrooms before putting the beef back in to simmer.  I put in a little garlic powder, and used cornstarch mixed with a little broth instead of flour since I didn't have pan juices from the high heat.  Skipped the white wine 'cause of the red wine reduction.  Served over buttered egg noodles, and my family really liked it.  I think it's pretty versatile, too.

Followed all of the early suggestions (marinating in wine, white onion, corn starch, cream cheese, etc). Also, I used spicy brown mustard. The recipe was absolutely delicious, though the cream cheese was unnecessary. Next time I'll use a few less onions and many more mushrooms and beef. I also had to add quite a bit of garlic to cut through the thick sauce. Overall, very good.

I loved this recipe as a starting point for my own version.  I made a few changes, but I think I got a similar flavor in the end.  I made the folowing changes just based on what I had.  I used ground beef and sausage and a vidalia onion instead of green.  I also added a little cream cheese because I didn't have enough sour cream.  Otherwise I followed the recipe and served it on rice.  It was fab the next day when I reheated it also.  A much appreciated change from my regular recipe.  I love it!

I have never had success in making beef stroganoff before this dish.  The recipe is easy to follow and tastes great!  The only thing I changed was instead of adding 6oz of canned mushrooms, I added fresh mushrooms.  I think the wine really adds something great to this tried and true dish.

I'm throwing out my old recipe and using this one now! I did as others have suggested and marinated my beef in wine only and not added some later. Also, used a yellow onion and fresh mushrooms. Very tasty stroganoff!

I took some suggestions from Beezlys review. I added the worcestershire sauce, mustard and the cream cheese. However I didn,t marinate the meat as she suggested, I just added it at the end. I also have a suggestion, not the sauce, that was fantastic!!! The meat I used was boneless beef shirt steak. This meast is always tender, so you don,t need to cook the dish for an hour. Enjoy

Excellent!  You can use plain lowfat yogurt in place of sour cream to help lower the calorie content.  You can also add onion mushroom soup mix for a richer flavor!  I was very happy with this recipe....thank you!!!!

This was my first time making beef stroganoff and it turned out GREAT.  I followed the change suggestions given by BEEZLYS--very good advice (though I suppose I have no basis for comparison).  I also used 2 baskets of fresh mushrooms which i sauteed in butter and garlic before adding at the end--YUM!  I big hit, will definitely make again!

This recipe is delicious!  I followed the few modifications that reviewer BEEZLYS said she did.  My husband loved this recipe!  I have added it to my collection and will make again and again!
Added tip:  make sure you slice your beef "against the grain", as it will yield more tender meat!

Very tasty!!  I made a few adjustment due to not having all ingredients on hand.  I used fresh mushrooms sautéed in butter instead of canned, and substituted more broth for the white wine.  This dish came out GREAT, the whole house loved it!  I thought it was even more flavorful the next day.  I will definitely make it again!

This recipe is fabulous.  I didn't quite have as much meat as the recipe called for.  I used 3/4lb and it was PLENTY -- though it would serve nowhere near 8 people with that much.  My family of 4 ate happily, and there was enough for my husband's lunch the next day.
I LOVE LOVE LOVE that there is no mushroom soup involved.  I MUCH prefer recipes from scratch!

This was very good!  I added some Worscheshire sauce (or whatever it is called!) as well.  i didn't have the small onions, just a vidalia onion and that really tasted great too!

Even my kids liked it after I picked the mushrooms out of it!

Oh.  My.  God.  I'll never be able to eat this in a restaurant again!  Upon others' suggestions, I marinated my beef in red wine (I used a cabernet) rather than adding white, and I used a LOT of fresh mushrooms in lieu of the canned.  I also added quite a bit of garlic, which really made it all come together.  Thank you so much!

Awesome awesome awesome.  I used sirloin rather than chuck as a personal preference - sirloin done not have to be cooked as long and doesn't get chewy.  This recipe is wondeful, we loved it!  Thanks!

WOW. This recipe knocked me off my feet...I have been trying to cheat with stroganoff for so long, but I finally tried the slow-cook-in-the-gravy way and it is well worth it. Beautiful, professional looking results and addictive flavor. I made a rather large pot for myself and 2 other guys, it was gone before we could blink :)

This is a good base to start with. My husband and I found it on the bland side, even with one reviewer's suggestion of adding Worcestershire Sauce and Garlic. We are used to very flavorful food on a daily basis so I will build up the flavor more on the next run. We also used ground beef to speed up the cooking time and cut down on prep hassle. Otherwise very happy with the recipe and looking forward to making it again with a few modifications to suit our tastes.

My family really liked it.  While it was easy to prepare, it felt like it took forever to cut up the meat....to do it really quick, next time I will buy meat already cut up, or maybe try ground beef.  I made it exactly how the recipe said and it was delicious.  My picky clan really liked it too....it took some prodding to get my 6 year old to try it because she was insistant that it was dog food....and so there was joking the entire meal about the appearance.  Whenever we try new stuff....we have the responses of either...yuck, never again....to was good...but would rather not eat it again...and the good...definately make another time....and this definately got the good, make it again from all 5 in my clan.  Everything was really quick except the cutting of the meat.

This is a great recipe. I followed the suggestions of the other users by marinating the stew meat in white cooking wine. I also added the cream cheese. It was a winner. I will make this one again.

Very good recipe.  Just made it for the first time and it was excellent.  I stuck to the recipe except for 2 points.  I added 1 tablespoon of Worchestire when I added the mustard and I added 1/3 cup cream cheese when I added the sour cream.

WOW this was very good. I've never made or even eaten stroganoff before this was very tasty. I took others advice and marinated the meat in the white wine prior to cooking and omitted it at the end. I used fresh sliced portabella mushrooms instead of canned mushrooms and added 1 teaspoon of worcestershire sauce & served over wide egg noodles. The meat was very soft and tender. This is definetly going to be on the dinner rotation. Great recipe!

Really great recipe. Nice and easy. I followed other reviews and marinated the beef in red wine overnight (sooo good!), used one medium yellow onion instead of the  green onions, and omitted the white wine since I had already marinated in red. Overall: a definite keeper.

This recipe is SENSATIONAL.  I didn't modify anything, except for adding more mushrooms and topping with a dollop of sour cream and a little shredded cheddar.  Served on whole wheat egg noodles.  AMAZING!!!!

I added a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup and used sherry instead of white wine. Also changed the green onions to yellow. And added thyme. The tip on using 1/3 c. cream cheese and 1/3 c. sour cream is fabulous!

This is a good basic recipe and luckily, some of the other reviewers gave some great advice.  I too added 1/3 cup cream cheese and it made it nice and creamy.  Also, didn't have canned mushrooms, but always have fresh ones at the ready, so I sliced and sauteed some.  Nice addition.  I also added 1 tsp garlic powder, a TBS of paprika at the very end and a dash of Worcestershire sauce to pick up the flavor.  My family really loved it.  I used leftover prime rib from our New Years Day dinner, so I didn't have to simmer as long - about 40 minutes.  I actually didn't pay attention and put in the sour cream and cream cheese at the beginning of the simmer and it still turned out delicious.

Made this w/the hubs for dinner - it was simple and quick - best of all, it tasted great.  We did use fresh mushrooms instead of the canned and also added garlic.  Delish.  Will definitely make again.  UPDATE: I made this again, and used the suggestion of using 2 TBSP of flour and cornstarch...this made a very velvety-like texture.  Also used 1/2 of an onion diced instead of the green...I like this much better.  Though the recipe is great as it is.

This was a wonderful recipe! I had to leave out the mustard the second time (my husband hates mustard) which didn't make a huge difference. Still great!

I didn't have a few of the ingredients on hand, so since I was making it just for two, I figured I could tweak it a little.  I used about a cup of Tyson  frozen precooked seasoned beef strips, 1 T cornstarch mixed with 1 T Worcestershire sauce, 7 T of half-and-half instead of the cream cheese/sour cream base, 7.5 T of water, 1/2 a yellow onion, 2 T butter, 1 oz of canned sliced mushrooms, salt to taste, and a grinding of freshly ground black pepper to taste.  I served it over cooked egg noodles, and it was pretty good.  My DH didn't complain.  :)

Absolutely wonderful!  Everyone had multiple helpings, and I will definitely make this again!  **Tip** It helps to marinate the beef strips in wine overnight (or at least a few hours) to make the meat not so tough.

I read some reviews and marinated the beef in red wine for several hours before cooking.  Next time I will do the same, but blot the beef dry before frying because too much wine go in the saute pan.  I used half of a large yellow onion, instead of green.  Next time I will also add some garlic.  I also added a T or so of worcheter sauce.  Overall, it was pretty good.

I used Filet Mignon cut into one inch strips. It melted in my mouth! I also used yellow onion instead of green onion and used cream cheese and sour cream as suggested by another reviewer. It was so yummy over egg noodles with fresh mushrooms!

Very good!  The only thing I did different was to cut the pieces smaller so they cooked faster and next time I will probably double the sauce.  GREAT recipe!

I omitted some of the green onion, and added some yellow onion. Also, like others I marinated it in wine. Making it again tonight.

There are so many stroganoff recipes on here that I just picked one, and this was it!  I used 3/4 pound lean ground beef instead of the other meat, fresh mushrooms, normal white onion, added garlic and 3 T Worcestershire sauce, and used about 3/4 cup light sour cream.  I just cooked the meat, onions, mushrooms and garlic together, stirred in the wine and let it cook off a bit, then poured in the broth, Worc. sauce, pepper and mustard and let it simmer, covered, while the egg noodles cooked.  After the noodles were done, I mixed 2 T flour with 3 T milk and stirred it into the boiling sauce, let it cook a couple minutes then removed it from the heat and stirred in parsley and the sour cream.  This way, it was very quick.  We liked it pretty well, it made 4 servings.  I think 4 T flour would have been way too much and it definitely needed at least 3/4 cup sour cream, if not a bit more.  I'm sorry I messed with your recipe so much, but I really liked the outcome and was glad for the guide!  Thanks!

We made this dish with changes proposed by BEEZLYS (I used 2 packs of fresh fried mushrooms instead of canned and we used Tenderloin cut) and it was FANTASTIC.

An easy one no doubt but I used eye of round and simmered longer-it still tenderized nicely.  I would have prefered fresh mushrooms as well as Worcesterchire sauce as some of the other reviewerd suggested and used a pat of butter, not 4oz. 
     Turned out nicely-a fresh creamy taste as well as a touch of wine finish however it still is a very basic tasting dish.

first time ever making strganoff...have to say AMAZING. Made a few changes like marinating meat for 20 min before browning it, next time I will use Sirloin as a prefrence as well as fresh mushrooms (only had canned) but even with canned still turned out preety good.

My family really liked this recipe.  I made a few changes like adding more cream cheese and sour cream because I doubled the recipe.  Will definately make this again.

I did the suggested adding worcestershire, garlic and using sherry instead of wine.  I found it pretty easy to make, it came together rather nicely.  The long and seemingly endless simmering time made it easy to work around.  My husband rated this a 4/5, I'd give it a 3/5, I felt it was missing something.  No idea what, however.

Instead of chuck roast, I used top sirloin and it came out wonderfully.

I like how easy this recipe was to prepare and that it didn't call a very expensive cut of meat. Just a few simple everyday things and you have a great supper without going to the store, at least for me. Great for a mom going to school!  I will be making this time and again!  Thanks.

I made this tonight for dinner and I was blown away! I have never tried to make stroganoff before. (besides that stuff in the box) This was AMAZING! I left out the onions just because I dont like them, and the wine since I didnt have an on hand and left the meat simmer for a little longer than the hour. It was so tender it was almost falling apart. I will make this again! Thanks for sharing!

wow! this will be a regular item to the list of dinners i make over and over.  i was worried that the chuck cut would be tough and tastless - i was wrong.  i thought there was not enough liquid after adding the flour and soup so i added the wine at that time and a little bit of water too.  mistake.  i used about a pound of fresh sliced mushrooms so i think additional liquid came out of them also.  in the end there was too much thin liquid but we loved it anyway.  we had it over wide egg noodles but wished we did rice.  end result...lots of slurping and mmmmmm-ing at the dinner table - happy sounds make for a happy meal.  thank you so much for sharing your recipe w/all of us, donna!  i will follow it to a tee the next time i make it (which will be very soon)!

This recipe is okay--it's not great but it's not awful.  I got way too much sauce and the flavor was kind of...weird?  I probably won't be making this again.

I make this all the time and It is great.  I make extra sauce and let the meat simmer for 2 hours while I take care of the baby or do housework. Sometimes I even trim the meat the night before and have it all ready to go for the next day - easy. everyone now thinks I'm a great chef!

Fantastic recipe. I always double it, with 3 teenagers at home, food goes fast! I also use two cans of beef broth, and one can of french onion soup for extra flavor, and a bit more gravy. The mentioned addition of some cream cheese is a must try, we love it. I also like to add a few more sliced green onions towards the end of cooking, and fresh mushrooms are a must. I like a blend of baby bellas and white. This stuff is Soooo good!

Yummy and fairly straightforward, though it wasn't quite as simple as I thought.  Turned out great, though - served it over egg noodles.

My husband and I could taste the wine too much.  I think that the wine should either be eliminated completely or the wine should be put in the dish early so that taste isn't as strong.  Neither of us are wine drinkers, and we could really taste it.

Very good recipe! I made the following substitutions: used app. 1 T butter, lean ground turkey, chicken broth, light sour cream, regular onion, and fresh mushrooms. I added the mushrooms after adding the broth. Then I simmered for about 45 minutes. I did not like the flavor the white wine added so I won't use it again. Served over whole wheat egg noodles.

i'm a vegetarian but for my meat-eating boyfriend's birthday i agreed to cook him meat, which i've never done before. this recipe was SO EASY and he said it was the best beef stroganoff he'd ever had. i did omit the wine (we're not wine drinkers and it seemed wasteful to buy a bottle for such a small amount) but it apparently didn't detract from the flavor. other than that, i also just used a regular yellow onion instead of the green ones, and then served it over buttered egg noodles. VERY big hit. thanks for helping me make his birthday special =)

I am in love with this recipe!  I had leftover prime rib and sliced it with some yellow onion and portabello mushrooms.  I followed the suggestions of others and used a little cream cheese and oh my! I did do the "lighter" version of this recipe by using fat free sour cream and light cream cheese.  I used a little olive oil and I Can't Believe It's Not Butter to sautee my shrooms and onions.  I also like playing with my spices-used a little McCormick Montreal Steak seasoning with some sea salt.  Definitely a keeper!

Good.  Substituted sherry for the white wine, added cream cheese as per other reviews.  Husband really liked it. It was fine for me. I will make again, maybe adding a bit more sherry.

This wasn't bad, but it also wasn't as good as I thought it'd be, given the rave reviews.

I took the suggestions of another reviewer and added 1/3 block of cream cheese, minced garlic, and yellow onion.

My family enjoyed the meal, but I guess I expected a little more "wow" based on all the five star reviews. Still, I would make it again. 

Thank you so much for sharing!

This was good, but I've had better.  Next time I'll leave the mushrooms out, and use more onions, and maybe leave the wine out too.  I think I'll try it again that way.

I was skeptical to try this only because I have never made a stroganoff. I am so glad I over-came my fears and did. It was excellent. I did add peas and worcestershire to the recipe and did not have green onion so used yellow. The sauce was great but I did think it was a little too thin. I was afraid to thicken and ruin the flavor. Thanks for sharing. Will definetely make again.

this recipe looked difficult, but it was surprisingly easy. I also used the yellow onion worchestershire and fresh mushrooms. I added a little cream cheese within the last 5 minutes - it was delishious - The leftovers were even good cold the next day.

I have made this dish twice so far.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly as posted.  The second time I made a few minor modifications and I liked it better the second time.  I substituted thinly sliced fresh mushrooms for the canned, vidalia onion for the green onion and I left out the mustard.  It was very good the first time but excellent the second.  Very good recipe.  Keep posting more like these.

My husband and I love this stroganoff recipe!!!  We make it on special occassions and it never fails...  We use a really good wine (though inexpensive), like a Vovrey or Riesling, good dijon mustard, and the last time we made this we used baby portabella mushrooms.  If I don't have scallions on hand, I just use regular white onions and cook them a little longer.  Also, instead of a beef chuck cut, we use a sirlion.  It cuts the cooking time down.  YUM!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Mom's recipe that I grew up with was made with ground beef so that's how I made this and it turned out great. Invest in good quality egg noodles, the ones that I bought were the cheapest but not  the best. I would make this again but put some cream cheese in with the sour cream to make it creamier.

Don't know what I did wrong. I followed the recipe but it didn't turn out very well.  Simmered on very low heat and the broth cooked away in 5 minutes (not one hour) leaving the meat so tough it was hard to cut, even with a steak knife. I kept adding more broth, but didn't help.  After everything was mixed at the end, the sauce was ok, so we threw out the meat and just ate the creamy sauce with egg noodles.  If I try again, I'll follow one of the reviewers that used ground beef.

This was delicious!  After tasting the sauce, I added a 1/2 teaspoon of dried thyme for a little extra flavor.  I also stirred in about 1/3 cup cream cheese as suggested.  My boyfriend loved it!

A really good base to start with, but for my family it was a little on the bland side. While it might not be traditional stroganoff, I would add garlic or some other seasoning that gives it more of a kick.

EXCELLENT! Using Chuck roast was cool, but we used thinly sliced roast meat. Worked much better! The sauce was a bit runny, so we added some Wondra flour. Worked out great. Had it with Saute'd asparagus in soy sauce! MMMMMMMM!

Very good recipe!  My 4 and 2 year old gobbled it down.  I only put in 3 Tablespoons of butter rather than the 4 oz., though, and it came out great.  Very tasty, meat was very tender.

The sauce wasd good but the meat was rather chewy. May have just been the cuts of meat, but I am not sure. I think I will try it again, but with a different cut of meat.

My family loved this dish! I used some of the substitutions that were mentioned (marinating in red wine, stirring in some cream cheese) but I think it would have been very yummy just as is. I plan on using the slow cooker for the last hour of cooking before adding the last ingredients this time so we can eat it for Sunday dinner. Can't wait!

This was great, very easy to prepare.  I used left over steak so omitted the browning of the meat portion of the recipe.  I used cooking onions instead of green.

I felt this recipe to be rather average. It's kind of a simple everyday recipe suited for the average home cook as opposed to being more of a chef creation. I can see where some of the modifications made by other reviewers would make this taste better and have a better consistancy. One note, I found this recipe under "Low Carb" recipes. As soon as you serve it over either rice or pasta the low carb aspect is gone! So for those of you that found it the way I did, watch out for those hidden empty carbs in the pasta or rice you might use.

I had to add a little more beef broth to the recipe because there wasn't much sauce left after simmering for an hour.  I'll probably use lower sodium beef broth next time, since it tasted a little salty (probably from me adding more).  Serves great with peas and egg and egg noodles.  It tasted wonderful and I can't wait to make it again.

This is a very good, stick to your ribs kina meal. I've made it quite a few times, and have altered some things to fit our tastes a bit more. I use ground hamburgar instead of large chunks of meat, and white onion instead of green. I also add a can of Cream of Mushroom soup. I serve it over buttered egg noodles, usually with a big green salad. Everyone in my family loves it!

Donna!  This was served to my DH twice in one week because he enjoyed it so much! He liked it better with mashed potatoes than rice, though.  I do advise anyone cutting a cheap piece of meat like a chuck roast to cut it across the grain to be sure it will be tender, otherwise it may end up tough! Thanks for sharing.

This was an excellent Stroganoff.  The only thing wrong was it did not make enough to feed our family of 5, plus have leftovers.  I made this in my electric skillet to give me extra room and that worked fine, but I think this would make a great crockpot recipe, so I think I will try that next time.

I just made this for dinner with leftover pork and beef and it was superb.  I did dredge the meat in flour and browned then added onion.  Used the white wine to loosen everything from the bottom of the pan then followed the rest of the recipe.  We loved it and it's so simple!

I made this recipe for my son's birthday last night (26 years old!  This is his favorite meal and he raved (as did all of our guests) over this recipe!  It is the BEST stroganoff recipe EVER!  I did not have white whine on hand, but DID have sherry...  Turned out FABULOUS!  Quick and easy, too!

Wow! what a wonderful recipe, a favorite in our home for awhile now.  Thankyou so much!  I did do some personal preference changes to it.  I use Buffalo or Chopped Sirloin,Yellow onions and Fresh baby Bella Mushrooms in it.  I also use organic butter and organic sour cream too to make it healthier for me and my family.  I used a marsala wine  and fresh tyme  in it too and it was just fine.

Amazing.  This will become a regular in our house.  Would use fresh mushrooms next time and more onion.  After browning the meat I transferred to a bowl making it much easier to make sauce.

Great dish. I suggest a "vouvray" white wine (the peach and pear flavor of this wine DOES this recipe well). What you don't use in the dish......you will enjoy in the glass (for a wonderful food/drink match). GREAT recipe....thank-you.

Great recipe!  Used BEEZLYS 10/2004 rating/suggestions exactly and turned out terrific.  I will definitely make this again.  Just a note...the addition of cream cheese at the end was SO GOOD!!

WOW, so good!  I followed Jilly's recommendations.  I also brought the cream cheese to room temp and stirred in some sour cream before adding to the crockpot.  REALLY good and so easy!  My 7- and 3-year-olds scarfed it up, and the grownups loved it too!

This recipe was a hit, especially after a cool, brisk day.  I used sliced sirloin tip steaks and I had to use a can of french onion soup because I was out of cond beef broth. The steaks seemed to yield a little less desirable amount of juice so I then added a cup of beef granule mixed with water. I was out of white wine so I used a cup of champagne that I let sit for a bit to un-bubbly. Mom-In-law loved it too! I served it over egg noodles.

I made this recipe last night and it was a hit. I left out the mushrooms because my husband doesn't like them and I used regular onions instead of green because I had them on hand. I also had a reisling wine on hand so used that too. It's a keeper for sure.

Donna you are awesome!  This is the third recipe that I have tried of yours in a week and I was not disappointed!  It was perfectly delicious made exactly as the recipe states.  The only thing I would do differently next time is cut the meat into smaller pieces so that you don't have to cut it up when you are eating it.  Also, I would have stirred it a little more as I was simmering, because some of the beef got a little burned at the bottom of the pot.  It was still delicious, though!  Keep em' coming!

I actually liked the flavor better BEFORE the wine - but it was great nonetheless.  I think next time - I will leave it out.  I also will cut the meat into smaller strips than called for.  It was good though!

Started making this one instead of my old tried-and-true, and now I won't go back. My only complaint is that unlike my old recipe, this one does not taste better the next day -- it gets quite bland. Then again, we rarely have leftovers with this one!

It took me much less time to prepare because I found it didn't need to simmer for an hour, but it was AMAZING! I also used chicken instead of pork.

Great recipe, I have made this several times and have been very happy with the results every time.  My only mistake was putting it over too many noodles and thinning it out too much.  But obviously, that was my error and does not diminish the quality of the recipe as written.

Delicious!!!  I sautéed the mushrooms and regular white onions with garlic.  Added sliced top sirloin steak and partially browed it.  Moved everything over and added only 3 TBS of flour – I don’t mind it being a little thinner – more flavor over the noodles!  Since we are not a wine or mustard family, added a squirt of catsup!  I simmered for about 45 minutes, added the sour cream and served over noodles.  Everyone devoured it!  Thanks for the great recipe Donna.

I'm totally new to cooking so this was my second real meal that I cooked. It came out really good. The wife liked it a lot. I added more of the beef both as the sauce was getting to think. Think I was keeping it to hot.

This is a keeper for sure!!

This recipe got great views so I had high expectations, but this was nothing special.  I did follow the recipe with the exception being no butter and onion instead of green onion.  If you're going to try this recipe, I'd suggest a better cut of meat than chuck.

Awesome!!!  Even my picky children loved this recipe.  It is so easy to prepare and turns out great.  I serve it over wide egg noodles.  I did not add the wine because I didn't have any on hand and I could not find "condensed" beef broth so I used Campbell's Beef Consomme.

Sorry to say we found this to be rather bland. I did make this in the crock pot- don't know if that made the difference? Used all the ingredients listed. After tasting it I added worchestire and garlic - made it a little better. As it sits - will not make this again.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I didn't have the sour cream or the mushrooms so I simply added a little half & half (1-2 tbsp). Next time I'll have them on hand. Was very good anyway.  It will become a standard.

This was good, but I would make a couple changes.  I agree with another reviewer that it needs to simmer closer to 2 hours to make the meat tender.  Also, I used 2c of stock (that's what size I had) and it worked well since I simmered it longer.  Next time I will dissolve the flour in the stock because it went lumpy added to the pot.  My husband doesn't like wine flavour, so I didn't put it in at all.  However, it was very flavourful and with this bit of "tweeking" I will definately make again.

I thought this was worth the work.  I used beef cubes instead of strips, and it turned out great.  I am not a fan of mushrooms, but my boyfriend loves them and thought this was really good.

A very good recipe.  However, I'd probably withhold the wine next time, or add it earlier so it cooks down a bit.  I feel it was a bit too overpowering for the dish.  I did use a sirloin tip instead of chuck as well.

I, too, marinated the beef in the wine instead of adding it at the end. I used 1/2 the butter, 1/2 of a large white onion and Dijon mustard instead of yellow, which is what I assume the author meant. I also added 5 small cloves of garlic. It probably didn't need to be changed at all, it was just what I had on hand.

Delicious even after omitting the butter and wine.  In place of the wine i used a 1 1/2 tsp. of rice vinegar for an alcohol free version.

I am retracting my previous review! I don't know what I did before, but this time it was much better. I used sirloin instead of chuck, sauteed it, then removed the meat to do the onions. I carmelized the onions with some minced garlic. I used homemade broth and added the meat back in for the simmering part. I also used fresh mushrooms and about 3 oz cream cheese to make it a little creamier. Served over noodles. Good comfort food, but too fattening for everyday. A keeper!

Used beef round for stew and it was too tough. The sauce was absolutely delicious though and i will make it again with a different cut of meat. It did take a long time to prepare but I had the time!

I found the sauce to be very milk, it needed more spicing though I'm not sure of what type (maybe more mustard?).  I'll keep looking for a good stroganoff recipe.

Excellent!  I used sherry in place of wine, fresh instead of canned and bottom round instead of chuck.  But basically it was the same.  The boyfriend ate most of it in one serving- 8 servings, yeah right.  :)

Very good...a bit salty for my taste.  I wouldn't add the salt to the meat when I make this again.  Canned mushrooms are out of the question on this one!  I added sliced mushrooms when I added the broth.  Also, DO NOT add red wine!  You will end up with an unattractive pink mess...not many people like that!!!

Great flavor.  I halved the beef and used sirloin.  Kept the sauce as per recipe.  Used 6 green onions and Knorr Beef Boullion instead of canned.  Otherwise all amounts the same.  On the first part of cooking, left the lid off to allow reduction.  We loved it.

This is a delicious recipe!!!  I have tried so many stroganoff recipes looking for the right taste & I've finally found it.  It's so nice to know I'm not feeding my family a processed stroganoff out of a prepackaged sauce mix.  Definitely one to recommend to friends & family.

This recipe is wonderful.  I had 4 pounds of stew meat, so I used that instead of the roast.  Also, I did not have beef broth, so I used beef base, made 2 1/2 cups of strong broth.  I did not add the salt.  Canned soups, base or boullion normally have a high sodium content, so adding any additional salt makes the dish too salty for us.  Also, I took the advice from one of the other reviews and added a few shakes of worcestershire sauce when I added the wine.  My family really liked this and I'm sure I'll make again.  They were fighting over who would take the leftovers for lunch!

This is delicious! My husband just loved it. It is definately a hearty meal. We ate it over egg noodles (the thicker kind from the frozen food department of the store). I added a little more garlic to it, but other than that, it was great!

This was delicious.  As did some others, I used round steak instead of chuck roast, and I replaced green onion with 1 regular onion.  Omitted the wine that I didn't have, and of course used fresh mushrooms, since canned are nasty and wrong.  Overall, it was really nice, and I could see adapting it to your crock pot as some others did... it would be even more tender.  A fair bit of work, but I'll be making this again- it was a hit!

I loved this recipe, and so did my husband, who normally does not care too much for stroganoff.  He had two huge helpings at supper and is looking forward to the leftovers.  I did not have condensed beef broth on hand, so I used 3/4 of a can of Swanson's prepared beef broth with a bit of beef boullion shaken into it.  I also added about 5 shakes of Worchestershire Sauce right before I added the sour cream and wine.  Excellent.

i love this recipe. I'm not a fan of big sloppy beefy noodly dishes, so even thinking about making this one, i'm never excited about it. But once it's done and on my plate, i can't stop sopping up all the sauce! It's fabulous. Everytime i've made it for guests they've loved it. Thanks for a keeper :)

This was very, very good and simple to make.  I didn't have any green onions on hand, so just used white, and also substituted fresh mushrooms for canned.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

This was the best recipe!  Although it had very good reviews, I was a little nervous.  It was for no reason, the recipe was easy to follow and the Beef Stroganoff was AMAZING!  After making that meal, my boyfriend thinks I'm magical, there were NO leftovers.  The only changes I made were I used 2 lbs of Sirloin Tip and fresh mushrooms which I grilled with the onions.

I used packaged meatballs with this recipe and just added them in after I had mixed the sauce together and cooked until they were heated.  Very good.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was simply FABULOUS!!!  Very, Very, Very, rich.........but Very, Very, Very, GOOD!  I used cooking sherry instead of white wine.  It was very good and everyone loved it however, small quantities were more than enough.  I think next time I will brown the meat with olive oil instead of butter.  Enjoy

This was great!   I did change it a little- I only used 1 T. of flour, maybe there was a misprint of the amount of flour?! No wine, doubled the sauce..and I like sour cream, so i used a 4 oz container. Absolutely GREAT! I don't think you can mess it up!

Great! The wine adds a really nice flavour. Although my old recipe tasted even better the second day, I didn't find that this one did -- it seemed to lose some of the flavour. Leftovers won't be a big concern with this dish, though -- everyone loved it so much that I doubt there will be any on most occasions!

This recipe was perfect and exactly what I was looking for. I did add some worcestershire for the heck of it, but didn't alter anything else and it came out just great. I couldn't get enough.

I liked the chuck roast because it was so tender but the sauce seem to lack something.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned so that may have produced too much liquid.

This is a great recipe! My wife is one of the pickiest eaters in the world and even she loved it! I even left out the mushrooms and onions for her and it still tasted really good. I will definitely make this again.

I liked this recipe. Added fresh garlic and sliced mushrooms when making sauce. Also used a nice cabernet instead of white wine...
