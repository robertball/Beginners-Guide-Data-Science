this is a great recipe for kids to help out in the kitchen.  By the way, the alcohol is burned off during the boiling process for those moms who are worried about the beer thing.  I cut the hot dogs with an egg slicer (I imagine that the kids would love to do that part).  the only thing that I did a little different was add 1/4 cup ketchup for zip. great for tail gates, potlucks, and bbq's!

Wonderful flavour. Following the advice of previous reviews, I let the hot gogs simmer for about 10 minutes and added a little ketchup.

Had never tried beer in beanie weenies before; felt the need to simmer longer. Came out great. Thanks!

I made this for more than 10 people.  Some who love beer loved it and I didn't care for it (I don't like beer).  Since the recipe author said she and her sister loved it as a child, I gave them to my kids but they spit them out.  So I gave it a 3 star review because of the split reactions from my people.  This might be a great tail gate recipe for people who love drinking beer.

It was a can of beans mixed with some hotdogs.  I don't really see what the beer or honey added.  Sorry.

Everyone loved this (except one daughter).  Next time I'll add more baked beans than the recipe calls for.  I also cooked the hotdogs longer in the beer like others had suggested.  This is such a super easy recipe to make.

I don't feel as if the beer and honey added any flavor to this recipe.  I'm giving it 3 stars because it still tasted good.

Fantastic!!!  My husband and I both liked it.  I used chicken hot dog and I couldn't taste the difference between them and the beef.  It also had less fat.

We were invited to a Lumberjack party and I thought this would be a good dish to take.  I agree with other reviews, needs to simmer longer & add ketchup for extra flavor. I also added some chopped onion. I cut back on the hot dogs a bit.  A whole package seemed like way to much for the amount of beans.

The beer makes it pop.  I used about 1/2- 2/3 can of light beer, couple tablespoons of hickory smoke BBQ sauce, dash of worcestershire, bush's southern pit BBQ grilling beans 22oz, and pack of kosher dogs.  No need for honey since BBQ gives it the sweetness it needs.  The beer in the beans was something special and got me thinking that I need to try it in a few other recipes.  Don't know how dad used to make it for me when I was a kid, but this was as close as I have gotten.  Thank you!

Beanie-Weenies is one of my favorite comfort foods! I simmered the hot dogs in the beer a bit longer, and added the ketchup like others mentioned- really good. I'm making them again for a pot luck really soon, this is a quick and easy recipe.

I wasn't expecting much out of a beanie weenie recipe- but this was pleasantly surprising.  Just like when you cook with wine, the rule is: never cook with something you wouldn't drink.  That being said, I used Blue Moon Pale Ale.  (It's not so much pale as copper colored, but we'll let that slide.)  Because I knew I liked the flavor of the beer, I went ahead and left in about 1/2 the liquid, added some ketchup and brown sugar.  I also added a little corstarch to thicken up the sauce.  (Gotta be careful with that or you'll end up with little white chunks in your beans- yuck!)After bringing to a boil and simmering for a few the sauce was just right.  Onions bring a lot to this dish as well.  Thanks for the idea!!!

These are quite good!  I really liked the added flavor the beer and honey gave them.  Serve with white rice, yummy!

Very yummy.  Even my picky daughter ate hers.  I do not think it works well as a meal, but as a side it is great.

My husband and three boys loved this recipe.  I loved it because it's so easy!  I followed the advice of others and added 1/4 cup of ketchup. And, it tastes even better the next day.

Easy, quick, cheap, tasty. I left a couple of T's of beer in the pan to add a little bit of flavor to the beans. Thanks!
