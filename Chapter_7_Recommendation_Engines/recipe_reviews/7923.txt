WOW! This sauce was so easy to make and so delicious.  I made it without the brandy and it tasted like a wonderful butterscotch sauce. I served it over warm bread pudding, yum yum! I highly recomend it.

I made this for the Apple Coffee Cake on this site and it was very good (makes the coffee cake taste more like dessert.)  However, I should have listened to other reviewers who said it had too much brandy--I didn't heed their advice, as I of am a follower of the line regarding cooking "When in doubt add more wine/alcohol"---but 1/4 cup brandy overpowered the flavor of the sauce.  If I make it again I will use no more than 2-3 tablespoons of brandy.  In addition, although the sauce thickened nicely, it could be a little creamier, so I will use half heavy whipping cream and half milk next time.  Finally, I think the wording of the recipe needs to be fixed as it says to stir the sauce frequently.  This is the wrong wording for this type of sauce.  Any sugar-based sauce that is not stirred constantly or left unattended will burn within a minute or two, so as the granddaughter or a former candy maker I advise that you continuously stir and scrape down the sides of the pan to prevent burning or else you will ruin your sauce and create a problem when you try to clean your pan.

Used the cream as suggested.  I really couldn't serve this because I kept sneaking a taste and there almost was not enough left.  :-)  It's really wonderful and I think it would be okay without the brandy if you don't have that on hand.

This is delicious.  I made this to put on homemade cinnamon rolls.  When I went to make the that goes with the rolls, I realized that I was out of powdered sugar.  I searched for an icing recipe made without pwd sugar and found this.  It was delightful and wonderfully rich.  I left out the brandy because I was serving it to my kids, though.  I think it would be wonderful with pecans.  Definitely a recipe I will keep on hand as a nice icing alternative.

I didn't have brandy, so I didn't use it. Next time I'll skip the vanilla too. I tasted it before the vanilla and thought it was wonderful, but when I put in the vanilla it didn't taste as good. I also used pecans instead of walnuts, because I like them better. Overall, easy to make.

Just made this sauce to take to a holiday dinner, and since I've been sampling it copiously, I thought I'd go ahead and review.  It's a pretty tasty sauce!  Mine came out quite thick, but it's got a nice texture.  I think I may omit the brandy next time, I didn't care too much for the undertaste of it.  And, call me a glutton, but I think I'll add a 1/2 cup of creme with the cup of milk.

A quick and simple sauce, with great results. I've made this twice over the holidays, always producing a smooth, great tasting sauce.  My only suggestion would be to reduce the amount of brandy a bit, as it is just a tad overpowering.

I found this a little too sweet- my family liked it though, and it went well with the cinnamon apple coffee cake! I used semi skimmed milk, and Baileys Cream Whisky (instead of Brandy), yummy, but you have to be carefull at ALL stages to avoid clumping, not just when whisking in the sugar.

This is one of my fav recipes from this site. Original review: Wow! This was really good! I made this for a pound cake. I tasted a little as I was icing the cake---amazing! I did change the recipe based on others' reviews that said it was too thick.

Used this to top off a pear cake I made from this site.  It added another dimension to the flavors, but I had to give it 4 star because it was amazing when it was freshly made but the next day it was disappointing.  I also found the brandy flavor to be a bit strong, next time I'll play around with the measurements.

This is a great recipe!!  When I made it I omitted the vanilla and rum but stirred in about a teaspoon of sea salt and it tasted just like those really fancy salted caramels.  :o)  I used the sauce to top sticky buns but I can think of many many things to put it on, including a spoon!  ;o)

This is a great easy sauce recipe! I've been making one for 15 years and it never seemed to turn out right. Just tried this one and it was great. I just didn't have brandy so I used vanilla rum instead.

Omitted brandy; with the presence of flour, it is like a butterscotch pudding. Added a bit more cream or milk to serve as sauce. Will use my own caramel sauce, but it's good pudding, *wink*. Thanks anyway.

I made with almond milk, no brandy, no vanilla and used as an apple dip. It was delicious! I can just imagine how well it would work with baked goods! I am so glad I found a cream cheese free brown sugar recipe I can use as a fruit dip. Yum.

This sauce is even better if you use molasses and granulated sugar rather than brown sugar. 1 cup of mild molasses + 1 cup of granulated sugar.

This is a very smooth ??? (not quite sure what to call it...mine turned out thick enough to qualify as frosting but not as thick as pudding which some reviewers said it was...certainly not a sauce). It has almost a satiny texture. I followed the recipe (whisking the whole time) except I only used half the brandy, which I think was the perfect amount. I spread it on top of Fabulously Sweet Pear Cake (from this site) & it worked very well.

This is NOT a sauce at all......... it's a pudding. There is probably a nice use for it but I certainly would not consider it a sauce.

This was lovely over the German Apple Cake recipe on this site! I found it too thick for my liking and would recommend therefore reducing the flour for the future.
Also, this makes too much - I would make half the recipe for a cake, and reduce the sugar just a touch because it was quite sweet.

One word: delicious. I omitted the brandy, and this sauce still turned out perfect. It had a good texture, consistency, color, and superb flavor.

Makes a thick sauce perfect with the Apple Coffee Cake recipe also on this site.  Perhaps I'll half the brandy next time as it was a bit strong and aromatic.  I wouldn't want to cut it out though as it really adds a distinctive flavour to the sauce.

This recipe is great.  I used half milk and half cream for the amount of milk called for.  I  left out the brandy and added some cinnamon.  It turned out great.  I used it as icing for a fruit cocktail cake.

I've never had a brown butter sauce before. I really liked it!  So simple to make and it would work well with any kind of vanilla, butter, banana, carrot or apple cake. I like the way you don't need to use icing sugar as I don't always have it in my pantry.

This sauce was absolutely amazing on top of the sour milk spice cake from this site. I replaced the brandy with an equal amount of water and used sour milk (I think that's the right term for it; it was the liquid left over from making ricotta cheese)in place of the regular milk. It turned out a perfect, slightly thick glaze consistency, therefore it must be pretty simple to make because I rarely make things using sugar on the stove without ruining them.

Goes fabulous with the apple coffee cake!  I make this sauce every Christmas, and in our home the coffee cake is lovingly referred to as "Christmas cake".  It will remain a tradition for years to come.

As a seasoned cook, I knew before making this recipe that any sauce with 3 tablespoons of flour and only 1 1/4 cups of liquid would be VERY thick. So I cut out one tbsp. of the flour and added a bit more milk. I also used sherry, but only half the amount in the recipe. The result was very tasty but far too thick to be considered a dessert topping. It was also pale, more a beige color than the nice butterscotch shown in the photo. Overall, it has a thick pudding consistency and little visual appeal. I will not be making this recipe again.

Made this as a sauce for my bread pudding. It was perfect! Super easy to make, though my sauces always seem to take longer to thicken than the suggested time and this recipe was no exception.  I did omit the brandy and increase the vanilla to a full teaspoon.

Made only a couple changes.  Used only 2 tablespoons flour so it would have a more liquid texture and only 2 tablespoons brandy.  Put it over bread pudding and it was WONDERFUL!!  I'm eating some right now (the next day) and it's still delicious.  I can barely taste the brandy, so will try with the full amount called for in the recipe next time.  I highly recommend this sauce.

I really tasted the flour.  Maybe next time I'll use only two TB flour.  I used imitation butter extract instead of vanilla and I liked that.
