This looks VERY real and was very tasty. I kept the recipe simple and only used jumbo shrimp and imitation crab (half and half proportions). Followed cocktail sauce and gelatin instructions, but used (2) 0.25oz packs.

I added 2 packs of gelatin and crab meat as another person suggested.  It turned out great, was popular, and I will make it again next year!
