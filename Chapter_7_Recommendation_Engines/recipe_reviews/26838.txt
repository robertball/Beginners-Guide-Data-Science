I diverted from this recipe some... Customized it to my liking.  I used Parmesan cheese, and smoked pepper jack, no Italian seasoning, sherry, or chili powder, I used a couple of teaspoons of hot sauce instead.  The way the ingredients collaborated just tasted so divine!  I will try to make the next batch like John posted it just to see if I like them.

What more can I say? These were incredible! I did add a little cayenne and a bit of sherry to the mixture as well. Make sure you purchase a good brand of crab. Good goin' John!

OK, I admit that I didn't really read all the directions first.  I just mixed everything together, threw it on some Portobello mushroom caps for a meal sized portion, put it in the oven topped with Provolone cheese.  It was so good, fast and easy. 11/03  i have made them a few times now and they have turned out very dry when they weren't topped with the provolone.

Great mushrooms!  I added some cayenne to give them a kick.  Be sure to have lemon wedges available.

Recipe tastes absolutely great & is very easy to prepare!  I liked using smaller, bite-sized mushrooms rather than large ones.

These are excellent but I'm only giving them 4 stars because they are SO salty.  If they come up with a low-salt Parmesan cheese, then these will definitely be 5 stars.  I was a little low on Paremsan cheese so I topped it off with a little mozzarella, which didn't seem to make a difference in the taste.  I served this with homemade tomato soup and a side of salad.  Delicious!

I thought the parmesan definitely made them too salty.  I almost doubled the mayo and it was still dry.  I've made others w/ more butter and lemon and different cheeses that were better.  I just drowned these in lemon to finish them up.  Sry.

These are awesome!!!  I agree they are a bit salty, but the second time I made them, I did not add any salt.  I used a combo of grated parm and freshly grated pecorino.  I like the taste of marsala with my stuffed mushrooms so I used a little marsala with the sherry (2 parts sherry to 1 part marsala).  I also drizzled a little marsala over each stuffed mushroom and topped with freshly grated pecorino before baking.  I served these a at a football party and they were a crowd favorite.  Definitely a staple for all my parties now!

We loved these!  I did cut back the parmesan to 1/2 cup and used 1/4 cup lite mayo to reduce calories.

I made these for a man on the fence and they pulled him over to my side. He said they were even better the next day. I don't care for mushrooms myself, but I'll cook anything to keep him happy! This will ultimately become my "I might need forgiveness" recipe! The only thing I added was to cut up the stems and add them in with the garlic and butter.

These were just okay.  I couldn't find my original crab stuffed mushrooms so I thought I would try these.  They are very salty!  Here are the changes I made:  I added the sherry into the mixture as suggested by other reviewers.  I will suggest to probably not put the full amount in (as I did) as I think this contributed to the saltiness.  I also added an extra clove of garlic and chopped up a few of the mushroom stems and sauted them with the garlic.  After they baked, I topped them with provolone cheese and broiled them.  The provolone made these much more enjoyable!

I read other remarks and decided to use coarsely grated fresh parmesan cheese.  Substituted 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper for chili powder.  Also added the sherry directly to the stuffing rather than in the cooking pan.  This compensated for dryness.  Was wonderful!!!
