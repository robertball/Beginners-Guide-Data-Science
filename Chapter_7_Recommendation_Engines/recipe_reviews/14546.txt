well, I didn't have grape leaves, so I substituted Prosciutto as the wrap. It was FABULOUS.

This is a very elegant and delicious dish.  I served it to friends as an appetizer at a barbeque and they loved it.  Some prep tips:  Let the goat cheese come to room temperature before trying to pipe it into the figs.  It will make your life much easier!  Fill the figs as full as you can.  It's hard to tell how much cheese you've put in and I wish I had put more.  If you insert the tip of the pastry bags deep into the fig then squeeze as you slowly pull it out, you will have a nice even amount of cheese all through the fig.  I also wrapped mine in proscuitto which was fabulous!  I forgot to drizzle the honey and it was still wonderful and since it wasn't sticky, they could be eaten as finger food.  I sliced each fig in half and arranged them on a platter.  I also cut off the hard stems so my  guests wouldn't have to.  Try this, it's a winner!

Excelent.We tried it  as written, and with a couple of variation:
1.Use half goat cheese and half ricotta with a generous sprinkle of Pecorino Romano.
2.Use Parmesan and Ricotta with a for the filling.

I adapted this recipe recently for an culinary student cheese competition and came in 2nd place locally. The flavors were great and the presentation was beautiful. Unfortunately, there just was not enough cheese inside the figs. Hoping to squeeze 1TB of cheese inside was wishful thinking at best. :(

In my version, I added chopped fresh thyme and cracked black pepper to the cheese, wrapped them in prosciutto and skewered them on rosemary stalks before grilling. For presentation, I served them on a bed of red-wine vinaigrette-dressed micro greens with a honey and balsamic reduction drizzle ;)

Quite tasty.  I don't have a piping bag, grape leaves, or a grill, so I made fig "sandwiches" by cutting the figs part-way through and spreading goat cheese inside with a knife.  Then I broiled them cut-side up. I stuffed walnuts inside after they came out and before topping with honey.  One caution: don't use too creamy of a goat cheese.  Mine got a little greasy with a triple creme cheese.

The first time I made these, I used dried figs (fresh figs out of season), and was taken away.  The second time I was able to get my hands on fresh figs and I was completely amazed at the difference.   Fresh figs really make the difference.  Any fig lover will love this recipe.

Outstanding recipe! I didn't have grape leaves so I used prosciutto instead to wrap the figs. Also, I used fresh rosemary from my garden as skewers. I bet these are great broiled but grilling them was out of this world. The honey was a great finishing touch. I plan on making these for an upcoming Christmas party.

The grill was out of gas and I didnâ€™t have grape leaves, so I broiled them on high (sans leaves) for 3 minutes with fabulous results.

Well, I tried this recipe on a dare. I'm
a very picky eater. This turned out great, the taste was very unusual, but good. If you want to suprise someone with the ingredients of what they just ate...this is a good candidate.

This is a special recipe for an appetizer! Just one hint if you are not a regular purchaser of figs: when buying them in the fresh state, in order to be ripe, they must be dark purple or black in color. The green ones are NOT very edible. My grocery sold boxes of figs in various stages of ripeness and the green ones were gross.

great appetizer! I wrapped the figs in prociutto after i filled them with goat cheese and baked them in the oven at 375 degrees F for about 7 minutes and the combination of flavors and textures was amazing!

These were so wonderful and I didn't even have fresh figs, had to use dried ones.  I used dried Mission figs.  I cut them in half, placed a ball of goat cheese on the cut side then wrapped it well in prosciutto (one of the few pork meats we eat on rare occasions).  I drizzled honey over them and popped them in the toaster oven.  They were sooo good and highly addictive!  I can't wait for figs to be in season so I can try these with fresh figs.  I thnk these would also be good with a cheese like Gorganzola, which I plan to try soon.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Great combination of flavors.  I didn't really follow the recipe but just cut a wedge in the figs, stuffed them with goat cheese, and placed them on the top rack of the grill for about 15 minutes.  Very tasty.

OMG--these are soooo good!! That said, let me tell you how I messed up making them. First, I didn't think to let the cheese come to room temp and when I attempted to pipe it into the figs I had to squeeze the bag so hard it broke! I tried microwaving it to warm the cheese, but the bag was so far gone, I gave up on trying to pipe it in. I cut them nearly in half, then spread the cheese on with a knife and squeezed them back together, which worked just fine. THEN I tried to grill them, but I think because the cheese was still a little cold it wouldn't melt before the figs started to get crispy. I took them off the grill and stuck 'em in the microwave (I forget how long--a minute maybe?). When they came out, I drizzled them with the honey and served them. After all of that, they were absolutely wonderful and worth every minute of work. Everyone at our dinner party loved them and I will definitely make them again, in one form or another!

After reading others reviews I decided to use grape leaves and prosciutto. My subjects said the grape leaves had a strange tobacco taste from the grill, overall not great but not bad.

The prosciutto was a bigger hit. They liked the mixture of sweet and salty.

I also made a batch without any wrap. Pretty tasty!

I reeaaalllly wasn't sure about the goat cheese part of this recipe. I love figs, but wasn't sure how this would turn out. It's absolutely delicious! The goat cheese balances out the figs, and the honey drizzled on it adds the finishing touch. I didn't use the grape leaves and it was still phenominal!

Wow! What a fantastic basic recipe. The weather was horrible, so I cooked these up over the stove and skipped the honey.  Works great with fresh dates, too.  My husband usually passes on goat cheese, but these tasty tidbits disappeared.

As some other said: OUTSTANDING! I followed the advice of previous reviewers and used prosciutto to wrap the figs. I served them on a bed of arugula... I think I could have eaten the whole batch!

My family loved this and they are not the type to try things out of the ordinary.   I didn't love the flavor of the goat cheese,  the next time I made it I used dates and a more expensive brand of goat cheese and it was delicious.

They were a big hit at a BBQ, without the grape leaves. Agree with the other reviews that honey made a fabulous addition. Easy to make. Little clean up. And D-lish!

What I made was more of an amalgamation of the reviews than the original recipe, so I don't know how fair my five stars is. I used prosciutto instead of grape leaves, dried figs instead of fresh, and did mine under the broiler instead of on the grill. But the flavor was amazing, and we were both REALLY happy with the results.

I think it would have been better if I'd followed others' advice and used prosciu
tto instead of grape leaves.  I wasn't a fan of this one.

These were delicious, and a big hit! 

I didn't have the grape leaves, and didn't have a grill, so ended up making some changes out of necessity. I ended up baking these, and found that slicing lengthwise to fill with the cheese mixture was easier and faster for me. 

I was making these en mass for a party and I needed to have something that I could prepare ahead of time, without a whole lot of fuss or mess. These worked great, and got rave reviews from the party-goers.

Very tasty, I had never cooked with figs before. I also wrapped them in prosciutto. The easy work around if you do not have a piping bag (which I do not) is put the softened goat cheese in a ziploc bag and snip of a corner to make a small hole, it works very well.
