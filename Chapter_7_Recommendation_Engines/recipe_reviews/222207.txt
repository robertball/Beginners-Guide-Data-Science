I'm a big duck fan and gave this technique a try and the end result was superb. I did the cooking on an electric range that was very challenging. A gas range would have made it much easier, but I heartily recommend this.

This was delicious and easy. One hour in water did the trick. Let it rest uncovered to get a crispy crust.

This recipe was one of the best things I have ever made.  I made a small portion of an asian 'spicy orange sauce' from another recipe here on this website (orange chicken) and drizzled it over the sliced duck as you can see in the picture and it was FANTASTIC!

This is a fantastic recipe! I had never made duck before and I had never cooked sous vide before. I made this recipe when the Ohio State Buckeyes were playing the Oregon Ducks for the 2014 national championship.  ;-)
This recipe has inspired me to add duck to our regular rotation, as well as to buy a sous vide machin. OMG, if you haven't had sous vide steak you are missing out on life! Wow!! Between the steak and the duck, it was totally worth $150 and space on my counter. I am still experimenting with other foods (meat, veggies, eggs).
Thank you for introducing me to a  new cooking method and adding a new, and very tasty protein to my diet!

I haven't cooked duck breast in years, but my son wanted to taste it. I used this technique. It was Perfectly cooked! This was so easy to do.

i love duck, but had never made it and i was very nervous since duck is one of those meats that has to be just right.  it turned out perfectly.  it took time, but was very simple and delicious and i loved the peach sweet and sour sauce too.  And for the person confused about it saying it takes 2 hours to prepare but 1 to cook, that includes the 1 hour it is refrigerating with the seasonings.

Wow! Hubby just started hunting so I turned here for how to make duck breast. Loved the rating, so gave it a try, and wasn’t disappointed! Had to improvise a bit - no skin on, so seasoned the wild breasts (and added rosemary) first, then wrapped in bacon which I skewered with toothpicks underneath. Popped them in my food sealer to vacuum out air, which worked great for the water bath later. [Hubby told me that’s good for drawing all the blood out of the meat, or even to put in a saltwater bath without the plastic...for those wondering.] Kept the bacon on for cooking in the cast iron pan, then removed toothpicks after. Attaching a photo or two...just delicious!!! Served with stuffing, steamed carrots, and a cranberry-orange relish I had on hand. Hubby already asked me for this recipe to share. It’s a keeper!

This was amazing!  Prepared the duck exactly as described and served with roasted potatoes with thyme & rosemary and sautéed spinach & mushrooms.   It doesn't need a sauce.  Will try again with duck and other things as well.

Mclarty,  since you never bring the water temperature above 135°F you can cook it in that temperature of water for three days it will never over cook. It can't cook  past the temperature  the water is simmering at.

I made this recipe for my fiancé and his family and everyone loved it! I used an immersion circulator - 135 degrees for an hour, meat came out a perfect medium rare, duck was nice and tender. I did find that searing the skin for 5 minutes was not enough as not all the fat has rendered off properly leaving some chewy pieces of skin. Next time I will render the skin for a few more minutes. Otherwise, I love this simple recipe for duck!

This came out beautifully without any tweaks.  Thanks for this new approach.  I hope we soon see some more sous-vide recipes.

Finally a great way to cook duck. This was one of the best recipes we have tried. We were fortunate to have been able to use fresh duck that was processed that morning, never refrigerated or frozen. The meat stayed very juicy.

Did anyone notice the video says 1 hour in the water, yet the recipe says 2 hours???? What did the 3 reviewers do - recipe or video. I'm in the middle of this and have settled on 1.5 hours in the water. I will comment & rate again.
