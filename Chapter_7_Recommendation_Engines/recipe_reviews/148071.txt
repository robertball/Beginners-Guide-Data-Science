I make this usually when money's really tight. If I don't have the Red Beans and Rice, I'll use a box of Spanish Rice and a drained/rinsed can of black beans. To beef it up a little, I'll sometimes throw in a half pound of cooked ground meat, chopped kielbasa or even leftover taco meat. It's always a hit with my husband and kids and it stretches really well. You can make it go even further, fill up your tortilla with chopped tomatoes, shredded lettuce and avocado.

I made this receipe without any changes, and it was wonderful. I'm currently dieting and looking for  variety in my choices, something that's tasty,  yet low in calories. This was perfect and will remain a staple even off the diet.

I had a package of red beand and rice that I found in the cabinet, so this is what I made with it. I am trying to make atleast one meal a week without meat and this was perfect for the first one. I didn't have sour cream, but it really needs it. The only thing I did different was added frozen corn to the beans and rice while it was cooking. I will buy the packaged beans and rice so I can make this again! I thought it was weird to add the seasoning to the burrito, but it made it sooo good. I only had two whole wheat flour tortillas so I just stuffed them full. My boyfriend kept asking where the meat was, but when he was done eating he was full! Thanks for the easy recipe.

This was DELICIOUS! I used Zataran's black beans and rice instead of the red and it turned out fine. I also added corn to the beans and rice after it was done cooking. The corn added a little crunch. The creole seasoning is so delicious and sour cream added a necessary flavor, as well. I love this recipe.

This was FANTASTIC and really easy!  Like the picture, only inside the tortilla: top it with some plain nonfat greek yogurt (instead of sour cream), some shredded sharp cheddar, and some chopped green onions to up the wow factor.  Delicious!

Very impressed.  I wasn't expecting the flavour that I got with this.  I've never used creole seasoning but it really added a nice kick.  I couldn't find the red beans and rice, and the grocer said it was discontinued actually, so I used mexican style Rice a Roni instead.  For such a simple, easy meal it was really great!

Surprisingly simple and good.  The 1/2 tsp of Creole seemed too much so I used 1/4 tsp. and that was too much.  Next time I'll just sprinkle a little bit on.

1/4 cup bean/rice mixture was not enough to fill tortilla.  I used 1/3 - 1/2 cup on each tortilla.

These were very easy and tasted great! I would definitely make these again. I used red beans and rice out of a can (Glory brand) and they were delicious! Great for a quick meal.

Simple to prepare and tasty. Recipe served as a good conceptual guide but not strictly followed. Rather than a boxed rice/bean mix, cooked brown rice and used canned black beans. Also added fresh kernels white corn, green onions {white bottoms}, and jalapeno peppers. Used reduced fat sour cream and subbed jalapeno jack cheese for Cheddar. Before wrapping burritos, finished-off w/ Creole seasoning from this site, a few shakes of Tiger Sauce, and green tops of scallions. 5* w/ changes. Thanks Marie B for sharing. See ‘View Notes’.

This was an excellent and quick dinner to throw together and it was tasty too!!!  As others suggested I added tomato, green onions and cilantro on top.  I think next time I will try to add cut up pieces of hot dogs as I felt like it was missing something.  I will definitely be making this meal again!

I forgot to mention that I also used Johnsonville Chicken sausage, the cheese & chipotle peppers variety and it added some kick as well.  Sorry I guess you can't edit your reviews...

Great simple recipe. I had leftover rice, beans and mushrooms, so I stir-fried them together for a few minutes. 
The dollop of sour cream is necessary to keep the ingredients together, though I'm not the biggest fan of sour cream, it was a good combo. 
I didn't have creole seasoning, used ketchup but it came out somewhat mild, will need to spice up the seasoning sauce.

Its fast, tasty, easy, cheap, and can be stretched with some salsa of beef.  Its hard to ask for more from a recipe. I paired it with the black bean and quinoa salad thats on this site... makes a perfect dinner.

The seasoning is what really makes this dish special; I added the seasoning to the rice and beans when they were done cooking to make it easy.  I added spicy chorizo cuz my boyfriend needs meat in his meals and it was delicious!

This is the the absolute best recipe I have ever made off of allrecipes.com. I add some pre cooked sausage to my rice and beans mix after its done cooking that i have cut up into small pieces. I cook 10 at a time, wrap them in foil and freeze them. I take them to work and leave them on my desk to thaw until lunch time, then i microwave them for about 25 seconds folded up end them i unfold them and cook for another 25 seconds  and they are good to go. I'm not to much of a spice person so I can leave out the seasoning and they taste just fine to me. You will absolutely love these.

So, so good!  We loved these.  After making up the red beans and rice mix I added an additional can of red beans to add more protein to the meal.  Will make again

It wasn't bad but can be plain. I did add a lot of veggies and it turned out quite nice.

I love zatarians so I knew this recipe would be awesome! I changed it up a bit by sauteing chicken with green, red, yellow and orange peppers to add more vegetables but to also add more color. This dish is fantastic!!!! Also on the side if you would like add corn and serve it with cornbread!!!!!

I made this tonight for dinner and we loved it, but I did make a few modifications.  I cooked 1 pound of spicy Italian sausage then added Uncle Ben's ready made red beans and rice and Creole seasonings then heated.  I then divided the mixture evenly among 6 ww tortillas.  I rolled them and put them in a 13x9 pan topped each tortilla with salsa and cheddar cheese, put it in the oven so the cheese melted.  They were delicious.
