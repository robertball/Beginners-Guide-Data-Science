I didn’t say a word at the dinner table to Hubs to announce that we were having wild and brown rice with the Salisbury Steak.  He dislikes both.  I hoped that since the rice was all dolled up that it would make a difference.  It obviously did, because he cleaned up his plate rather enthusiastically.  And indeed, this was surprisingly good, far exceeding even my own expectations.  I did deviate from the recipe, adding some zucchini I wanted to use, using fresh thyme (and no marjoram) rather than ground, and beef broth rather than chicken as I already had a carton opened that I had used for another dish.  I chose to cook the vegetables in butter separately from the rice, adding some fresh minced garlic.  I set that aside until the rice was cooked, stirring it in at the end.  How much my changes influenced the final outcome I can’t be sure.  What I do know is that this was colorful, flavorful, and had great texture.  I started off with slim expectations for this but we ended  up polishing it off. I served this with Salisbury Steak with Mushrooms, and Peas and Pancetta, both recipes also from this site.

I had just received some wild rice straight from Wisconsin and then found this recipe.  I cut it down to one-third the amount, and that easily was enough for six servings.  My problem with this was that the vegetables were total mush by the time it was done, so I'd caution people to add them just near the very end.  I felt it was bland, so maybe one could up the seasonings and add some crunch from toasted almonds.  I really do like the idea of the combination of the two rices.  I'll give this another try with a different method of cooking.  Thank you for this!

I have made this as stated, and it is a really good side dish. After a person tries this as written, you can find ways to personalize it too. Thanks for the submission!

Excellent!  This makes way too much for 4 people. You could cut the recipe in half and still have lots of leftovers.  Next time I will add more carrot, and some toasted sliced almonds.  It was just a little bland, but that was fine, because the other dishes we served at this meal were so flavorful.  It was a really nice side dish with everything else.

Added the vegetables 30 minutes into the cook time, since someone else said the veggies got mushy. Perfect consistency. Added a layer of black beans and turkey jerky 10 minutes before the end of the cook time. Delicious. Will make again. Looking forward to left overs for lunch this week.

Originally from Minnesota, now living in New Mexico.  My family came down for a visit and brought the wild rice!  I didn't have any chicken broth so I sautéed the onions and carrots in about a half stick of butter, added water and a smack ramen chicken flavor pack.  Added the herbs, the wild and brown rice and simmered for about 10 minutes.  The  crowning touch was the dried cranberries and raisins.  I could not get over how flavorful this was, the raisins and cranberries delivered a sweet and tangy zip.  Along with the thyme and sweet marjoram it was a savory blend.    Thank you I needed a start, never have made wild rice before.

Absolutely love this recipe! I bought wild rice on impulse and then realized I had no idea what to do with it. Luckily I found this recipe, which I made and served with grilled salmon. Perfect!

I made this in my rice cooker. Doing it that way I left out the water as I didn't soak the rice. I just added the 2 rices, veggies broth and seasoning in my cooker and pressed the brown rice button. Man oh man did my house smell yummy!! I have done it this way several times and it comes out perfect. You can dice the veggies a bit bigger so they don't come out soggy mush. Other than that, we all enjoyed it very much!! Thanks for a great share.

This was really tasty and easy. After soaking the wild rice - I dumped all of the ingredients in my rice cooker. (I added some sliced baby bello mushrooms) and pressed brown. 

I think I’ll try halving the recipe next time - it makes a TON!

I made this recipe exactly as written. I felt like it needed a little more flavor to it, but overall very good. I had to add more water to the wild rice in the first step because it evaporated very quickly while boiling.

Not bad. I made the recipe at 1/3 scale and there was plenty for one test bowl and three meal prep containers with chicken, I can only imagine how much rice would be made from the full recipe.

I had never made wild rice before & I 
found this recipe to be very easy to make. This recipe has great flavor but next time I make it, I will use a little less liquid since it came out a little too wet. Not that its a bad thing, I actually like it but my family would prefer it a little more like a pilaf consistency. Love the flavor. Thank you for sharing!

4.14.18  The only negative I have about this rice dish is that the veggies were mushy by the time the wild rice was done and the chicken broth was completely absorbed.  In the future, I think I’ll add the veggies about half way through the cooking cycle, but even with overly soft vegetables, we still enjoyed this.

I was not a fan of the combined wild and brown rice, especially in addition to the celery.  That was just too many textures at once for my taste.  The marjoram really was not a welcome addition either.  I think I'll pass on this one in the future.

Very good. But I made it with half as much rice to have a higher  ratio of the other flavorings and vegetables.

I made it as is, except didn't add the carrots as my husband doesn't like cooked carrots.  It was a little bland.  I think it needed more herbs.
