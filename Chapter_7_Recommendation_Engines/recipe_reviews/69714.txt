If you rated potential this recipe would be a five. I follow every recipe to a tee the first time. If I change it I'm not really trying the submitter's recipe. Having said that this had WAY too much pepper. I think the pepper by itself or lemon pepper by itself would have been enough but definitely not both! Can't wait to make it again and make some adjustments!!

Added a dash of Chardonnay, handful of spinach and a sprinkling of chili flakes to the mushrooms while sauteeing.Yum!!
Gives a bit of kick and increases the nutritional value..

After reading other suggestions I omitted pepper and salt.  Was fine without.  Also only used 6 oz of yogurt.  It was sooo good.  Hubby who never offers much in the way of comments thought it was excellent.  If using frozen fillets -be sure to squeeze out excess water. Wouldn't hesitate to serve it for company - looks and tastes like chef-prepared!

Fabulous! I was looking for another way to prepare fish and found this. I followed the other comments and did cut back on the pepper and was glad I did. I discovered I was out of yogurt and hate to admit I used sour cream!! (I typically cook low-fat) but it was wonderful.

Just used the recipe for the fish coating and it was incredible! I didn't have any mushrooms on hand but seriously can't wait to try it with them! This breading was perfect and light and full of flavor! Better than a restaraunt! Thank you for a great recipe!

Borderline inedible - watery way too peppery and otherwise flavorless. Ruined a perfectly tasty fish filet - stay far away from this one.

Very easy to make- my first fish recipe and it was delicious!! I did leave out the additional pepper and just used lemon pepper. Next time I will kick it up with some red pepper flakes.

Watery from mushrooms. Yogurt separated, and flavor really tart. I like baked fish, but this is not good.

The fish was very good but there was too much pepper. If I were to make it again I would only use the lemon pepper and not add any extra black pepper.

I thought this was awesome! I used sour cream instead of yogurt (didn't have any plain yogurt in the house)added spinach to the mushroom mixture to use it up. It was awesome served with baked sweet potatos the sweet/savory combination was excellent! Thank you for sharing.

I did not care for this recipe. My girlfriend liked it however. I felt it calls for too much lemon pepper. To me this is too heavy of a "gravy" for a delicate fish like orange roughy. I think I may use the gravy with a bit less lemon pepper on some pork or chicken though in the future!

My husband and I did not care for this recipe we have made fish several ways and this has to be one of our least favorite.
