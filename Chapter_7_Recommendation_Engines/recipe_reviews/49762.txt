GREAT! If you like chocolate and orange you have to try this cake! This cake is so good and it is not hard to make but looks very professional. The only thing I did differently is I used the remaining ganache that was to be pored over the final layer as a fluffy icing. I chilled it and then whipped it until light in color and fluffy. Then I just iced the cake as you normally would. I do recommend bringing this cake to room temperature before serving. It was a huge hit and I will defiantly make it again. I give it five starts! ( I used Large eggs)

My husband wanted an orange cake for his birthday and this was one of the few I could find that was not a bundt cake.  It was fantastic; it looked good and it tasted wonderful--restaurant quality in appearance, texture, and taste. Next time, I think I'd double the filling.  To optimize the appearance of the cake, it's a good idea to trim around the edges to make sure the layers are even--this makes the ganache looks its best.  Strong orange and chocolate flavors for anyone out there who really likes that combo!  Thanks for an outstanding recipe!

Just perfect!!!!  After reading others reviews, I was a little nervous because I am not a fan of marmalade and was worried that the cake would taste too much like it.  Not the case at all.  I followed the recipe exactly and served it for company.  I did, however, take the advice of other readers and add canned mandarins for appearance and flavor, and it was awesome that way.  Everyone raved.  Not only does it look fabulous, but the individual layers and flavors are so well balanced.  The cream cheese frosting went perfectly with the chocolate ganache and the orange cake.  And none of it is too sweet, which I really appreciate.  It takes a bit of time to prepare, but not too much, and it certainly isn't difficult.  We will definitely be having this again.

While time consuming, this cake is definitely a show stopper. I am the pastry chef for a small restaurant in my city and brought this in yesterday. I checked to see today how the guests liked it and it was a hit! I did change the way I frosted it though, covered both seperate layers in the ganache and waited for it to harden. I spread the orange cream filling on the bottom layer, and topped it with the second later. Instead of covering the entire cake (sides and all) with the ganache, I made a simple cream cheese frosting and spread that along the sides and piped some decorative icing along the top edge of the cake. It was beautiful! I am rating this cake as four stars though because while I loved the density of it, the layers were just a bit dry. I'm going to try playing with the recipe a bit to see if I can achieve a bit more moistness. All said though, this is DELICIOUS! The orange flavor is not overpowering and the combination of the orange and chocolate is wonderful! Thank you so much for sharing!  If anyone has any ideas on how to deal the moistness, please let me know.

Delicious!!! I used about 1 1/2 cups less ganache and 1 cup less cream cheese filling and it tasted totally great anyways.(this is an easy way to cut out excess fat and calories ^^! b/c there is a LOT in this recipe!). To decorate, I used canned mandarin oranges. (You can use fresh ones in season, but then you need to peel the pulp off. Shape is easier retained in the canned ones). The oranges on top can make a very pretty star shape :)

I personally did not care for this recipe thought because it was homemade I would get past all the orange pieces ...wrong! the combination of the orange peel and the marmalde was just to way to much.  That was all I could taste.  Now ever one else seemed to like it I made it for Thanksgiving however I won't be making again.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday and it was a hit. The ganache is so creamy and the cake so soft and fluffy with just the right amount of orange flavour. I will definitely be making this again. Not least of all because it is so easy. I had never baked a cake before in my life but it came out perfectly:)

Everything was absolutely perfect about this recipe. It's the first time I've made an orange marmalade cake, and I don't even like marmalade. I was making it for a friend's anniversary cake. Very clear and easy to follow directions, made this cake perfect. I couldn't get the layers out of it probably because I only 9" cake pans not the 8" that the recipe called for.
I still give it a 5 star for clear directions and awesome taste. Didn't change a thing except the pan size, and I would make this recipe again.

I made this for my husband's surprise birthday party.  Either people loved it or hated it.  Everyone LOVED the frosting.  Even my hubby, the orange lover wasn't over the moon about it as he didn't like the minced orange rind in it.  I will keep the recipe for the frosting.  Thank you!

We are huge fans of those chocolate orange candy balls that you eat in sections, like an orange - this taste just like those!  Just a word of advise regarding pan size...I didn't have 8 inch pans and used 9 in pans, and the layers were rather thin and kept sliding around (until it was refrigerated...then firmed up).  I also increased the ingredients for the filling and ganache, but didn't use it all...so next time I'll run to Walmart for 8 inch pans and make the recipe as stated. It's outstanding!

Wow..this was a great cake! I cheated and doctored a yellow cake mix with orange juice, grated orange peel and marmalade since I didn't have enough time for the scratch cake. Otherwise I followed the recipe. Big hit!

Frosting was fantastic.  However, the cake was way too dry.  I was not impressed and neither were my guests. I followed the recipe exactly as stated.

This cake adds a special flair and freshness to the month of January.  I made it twice and agree the first time it was a bit on the dry side, but still a huge hit.  The second time the reviews were even higher.  I added 1 Tablespoon Grand Marineir to the cream cheese filling along with peach butter (variation of apple butter).  I also added a a Tablespoon extra peach butter to the cake mix, which contributed to a nice full sweetness and a moister cake!  Thanks for this great recipe...I will bake it again.

I made this yesterday. The cake was excellent, orangey and light .It is a little time-consuming as opposes to doing something out of a box, but worth it if you like oranges. The frostings were another thing though. The reason I did not give this a 5 is because I disliked the cream cheese frosting, could be because I decided to use the 1/3rd fat version of cream cheese, I don’t know how would it be with the original full-fat version. The chocolate ganache was very nice. By mistake I bought the Bavarian flavored whipping cream and I just had 8 oz of semi-sweet bakers chocolate squares. So I reduced the cream quantity by 1/4th cup, but it still came out nice. Next time I will do the fluffy icing thing like one of the reviewers has done and will leave out the cream cheese altogether.

I'm not super thrilled with this recipe. It tastes great but the crumb of the cake made it hard to trim and neither cake was tall enough to split, so I ended up with a two layer cake that just doesn't look all that pretty. I love the concept of this cake, so I will be developing my own recipe.

Some people are saying that this cake is too dry, so I replaced the 3/4 cup unsalted butter with 3/4 cup butter flavored Crisco and 4 tsp. orange juice. It turned out great! Absolutely lovely.

As others have stated, the cake was a bit too dry for my liking.  Despite using cake flour and mixing well, the layers were dense and almost pasty. The texture ruined what would otherwise be a delicious cake.   I'm a huge fan of chocolate & orange and I liked that this wasn't too sweet.

I'm wondering if this recipe is missing an ingredient- shouldn't there be at least a little oil in the mix?

I may try adding some oil, or I may simply look for another orange cake recipe & modify it to use this frosting and filling.

I made this cake for my mom's birthday. She loved it! She always has loved the chocolate and orange flavors together and this was just perfect! Even my 11 year old sister wanted me to make this cake for her birthday. I took some advice of others and whipped the chocolate gonache and it spread easily over the cake. Wonderful. Thanks for a great recipe!

I was looking for an orange cake to make cake balls (cake & icing mixed together then dipped in chocolate).  The orange flavor in this cake is wonderful and fresh.  I also needed a lemon cake and decided to try this recipe using lemons instead of oranges, it turned out scrumptious as well.

The orange filling was just great.  I followed the recipe, but I preferred it a bit sweeter and more orangey, so I added some more marmalade and sugar to taste (also used confectioner's sugar for smoother consistency).  :-D  Overall, very good cake.

I don't even like the flavors and orange and chocolate and I still liked this cake.  Brought this to the office for a group event...the feedback was all positive, and they would tell me otherwise.  I was worried the cake might be dry but I found that the cream cheese and ganache kept it moist.  I plan to make twice as much filling next time because I felt I had to be a bit stingy with it….maybe even had a hint more marmalade.  The flavor is very well balanced in this cake, there is just enough orange without it be overwhelming. I made the cakes and filling the night before and then assembled the cake and made ganache the next day, it turned out fine. I will make this again...I know my husband would love it.

This cake was a huge hit!  Follow the instructions for 8" cake pan.  I only had 9" available, and now see the difference it will make, especially with cooking time.  Also, I added a couple of drops of orange food coloring to get a little more color.  The only thing I will definately do differently in the future is to double or even triple the amount of orange cream cheese filling.  It was delicious, and wished there was a thicker layer.  I also served it with a glass of "Sabra", a chocolate-orange liquor from Israel.  I decorated with mandarine oranges, and gold candles as pictured.  Was a very pretty dish.  The  "birthday" girl I baked it for loved it!!!

This is the second cake I've ever made. I'm a clumsy ox with cheap cake pans and this still turned out great. One of the things I love about this is that It's not packed with as much sugar as cakes frosted with a butter cream icing and the orange/chocolate taste is wonderful. Fives stars and two thumbs up! Cheers.

I did not like the cake part of this - I felt it was too dense a cake - decent flavor, just too dense.  The chocolate ganache was quite good, but for an orange chocolate cake, I think the chocolate ganache should include either orange marmalade, orange juice, or other incorporation of orange to lend to the orange flavoring a little more.  Not quite orange-y enough for my taste overall.  I would use the ganache recipe again (and, if for an orange cake, I would add something orange-y to the ganache, but again, a great ganache recipe for other uses) but would definitely use a different cake recipe.

It was really good, will make again.  My 12 year old loves it.  Not sure about the cream cheese personally, it was good but I'm not crazy about it in the cake.  Will make again

DIVINE!  A dear friend is a chocolate-and-orange nut-job, so I made this for dessert for a  ladies’ lunch at our house.  Because other reviewers commented that the cake was somewhat dry, I upped the butter to 2 sticks rather than 1-3/4 -- it melted in your mouth, baby!  Instead of 2-1/2 cups of cake flour, I used 2 cups of cake flour plus 1/2 cup of Hershey’s cocoa. A 1/2 teaspoon of orange extract and a 1/2 teaspoon of chocolate extract was substituted for the 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  I also divided the batter equally into four 9-inch cake pans (buttered and floured, with no parchment paper) and baked them for 23 minutes.  Perfection.  The cake was refrigerated overnight and was utterly beautiful when served.  Garnished with Candied Orange Peels (recipe is on AllRecipes) for both taste and good looks.  This is a winner that I’ll be making again.

I followed another reviewer's idea and whipped the ganache to frost the outside of the cake.  I think the cake could have used more orange flavor and next time I think I will add more marmalade to the cream cheese.  Everyone really liked the cake and it looked professional.  Thanks very much for the recipe.

I made this for my wife and a friend of our's birthday (per her request). I don't bake often, but this cake was fairly straight forward and everyone really liked it. To me it could have been a little more orange. Perhaps I'll use more marmalade and I'm thinking of adding Grand Marnier or Triple Sec.
As another person wrote, it is time consuming. I should have started first thing in the morning! Maybe I don't budget my time well. Anyway thanks for the recipe!

I did not care for this recipe. The cake just doesn't hold up when being assembled. As in one reviewer, I couldn't prevent the cake from sliding despite all the tricks I knew. Worse is when the cake began to split. In the end, it looked like a mud pancake . Not at all salvageable and heaven forbid presentable . When a recipe requires splitting a cake with different fillings a ganache that merely spells disaster.

Everyone LOVED this cake. It was not too sweet, and the pairing of the bittersweet chocolate and orange was great. My only thought was that there could be more of the cream cheese filling.

This cake is definitely a pain to make, but it's been delicious every time I make it.  I like to do the frosting as is, or whipped. After several tries, I learned that it's best to put the cake together, with all the layers, and before you poor the ganache over the top, trim the sides of the cake so they're even.  That way, the cake won't look like it has steps.
