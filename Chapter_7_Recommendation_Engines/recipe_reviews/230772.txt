Guess this is the first time I have ever seen this mixture in print. My goodness (coming from N. Ireland) this was very very popular and even now I still make it.   My Canadian husband loves it.   You can adjust seasonings to your liking but do like this one for a change.  Highly recommend as a side dish plus it is also healthy.

I made half amount of recipe, as I had only one parsnip.  I did have three turnips... Red variety.  I added a small white potato.  I also used half and half cream instead of heavy cream, which I always avoid.  Used very little bit of spices... Good choice, though for flavor.  I used a food processor, on chop and then mix, which worked well.  Hardest part of recipe was cutting parsnip... Hard as sweet potato.

Instead of boiling, I roasted the veggies, giving them a rich caramelized flavor! Then proceeded to follow the remainder of the recipe. Very delicious! Everyone thoroughly enjoyed. Will make again!

Quite delicious. I find the nutmeg works wonderfully if you also add salt and pepper otherwise it's a bit too prominent. will definitely make this again.

I really liked this and will definitely make again!  My hubby loved it as well as he is into Fall/ Winter dishes like this as well. I made it as a side dish with baked chicken (see Exotic Pomegranate Chicken another delicious recipe posted on here). I used about a cup of low fat milk, salt pepper and added cinnamon and it all blended wonderfully!  I poured the pomegranate gravy to  serve   (from the chicken) and garnished with cilantro (served it warm). Also easy to make and refigerate ahead of time. Tasted better the next day.Thank you for posting!

Received a couple of turnips from a friend and searched for something to make with them. This recipe was easy and perfect paired with pork roast.

Very good except the nutmeg was too prominent and I think my turnip was too small (halved the recipe) because it seemed to have gotten lost.  I remember often having carrot and turnip mash when I was young, so it was a little nostalgic for me to make this stepped-up version.  Will make again, with minor adjustments.

I made this without any changes and it was delicious.  My family isn't a fan of turnips or parsnips so I did half the recipe and had it all to myself :)

I made this as is.  Next time I will make it with less butter.  It was too rich for me.

Wonderful recipe. As others noted, it's very rich. However it's delicious and colorful. It really needs the salt and pepper; otherwise it comes out bland.

This is so easy and so wonderful, but I used my Instant Pot to cook the veggies, and my family loved it.

Delicious. My mum made this but didn't use cayenne and I like that addition. However, forget the butter. In our house mum put a pat of butter on hers, my brother preferred pepper on his and I just liked it plain with some salt.  Second time I made it still no butter so I used sour cream. Still good.  Though, it's better without the nutmeg.

Just made this and it's wonderful. A nice dash of color and it's warming on cool fall or cold winter days. You need to season to taste, but it doesn't get much better than this dish!

It was a bit loose for me so so would use a touch less milk. Great flavor.

My husband and I enjoyed this as a side dish for pepper steak. It was really good. In fairness, I don't like turnips so I substituted rutabaga, and it was still good.

Loved it—and even my husband, who is not that fond of root vegetables, appreciated it.  Will definitely make again.  And I made it just as the recipe called for.

Had no carrots but the ingredients of turnip and parsnips worked out. I boiled the parsnips separately with rosemary as the turnip was a cubed frozen package and softened quickly. The colouring was wonderful for our Thanksgiving dinner. I placed all the ingredients in a serving dish and continued to heat until served.

I may make this again, but I will cut back on the butter.  It's a bit rich for us.
