I wanted to make an Angel Food cake with whipped cream frosting and put strawberries around it. This recipe turned out delicious. It was perfect for what I wanted. The puree strawberries in the whip cream, and cream cheese is genius!

Very easy, light and delicious, not overly sweet. I was concerned it was too thin but folding  in the whipped cream made the consistency perfect. I did add some dry, instant jello to pink it up and boost the strawberry flavor, maybe 1/3 cup.  I made a four layer nine inch round cake so I did double the recipe. This will be my go to for strawberry icing.

I’ve made this numerous times and it has come great everytime. My family loves it! I purée a batch of strawberries and then freeze them in 1/4 cup portions for future cakes. It works out perfectly.

This was easy to make using a stand mixer and a hand mixer, one for the cream and the other for the butter and cream cheese.  Omitted the strawberry jam because I baked a blackberry jam cake.

Deliciously creamy, and the right balance of sweet and strawberry. I made this for a cake that I baked for an office party and it was a hit. 10/10 would recommend.

I was looking for a frosting with less sugar than the usual 3+ cups. This one turned out wonderful. The only modification I made was to put the puree in a small sauce pan and reduce it by half. Then added the full amount, just to give it a little more flavor.
