8.23.18  First, one comment to the recipe submitter.  You really should give a narrower cooking range.  Granted, our oven temps all vary slightly, but 20 minutes is twice 10.  FYI to others, mine baked for 13 minutes.  That aside, these are really good cookies, and I think you could successfully substitute other nuts (pecan comes to mind) if you canâ€™t find hazelnuts in your area, although they were very good.  I used my mini chopper which came with my immersion blender on the nuts, and these cookies certainly are quick and easy.  I particularly like the sweet flavor from the brown sugar.  We enjoyed these cookies, and I definitely would make again.
