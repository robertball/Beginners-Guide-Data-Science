Yummy in my tummy! I have made this twice in the last week.  The first time I made it as the recipe is written and it was good.  The second time I made it I followed one of the reviewers advice and that was to add creamed corn and that made it fantastic! Here is what I did different; I added 1 entire can of creamed corn to the egg, milk, butter and sour cream, but instead of using an entire cup of sour cream I cut it down to 1/4 cup. This makes the cornbread increadibly moist.  The recipe truly is good as is, but I thought that the creamed corn made it outstanding. Thank you for the delicious recipe, Virginia Hanker!

Best corn bread ever! I doubled the recipe, but only used 1 c sour cream and added a can of creamed corn. YUM! I also used more sugar as suggested by others. Thanks!

This is the BEST cornbread I have ever had!  It is my new go-to recipe for traditional (yet GREAT!!) cornbread.  Cornbread is often overlooked in a menu as a whole.  It is easy to make merely average cornbread and get away with it, because it is not the feature dish of the meal.  I suggest spending a couple extra minutes and putting some TLC into your cornbread... with this recipe!  The texture is what sets this recipe apart from others I have tried.  It is fluffy, while at the same time thick, and incredibly moist.  Additionally, the recipe was quick and easy.  If you want excellent cornbread, you have to try this recipe!

I was looking for a sweet cornbread like the type I used to eat growing up in the South.  This by far exceeded my expectations.  I used buttermilk instead of milk, 2 eggs and a 1/2 cup of sugar. It was excellent!

good stuff here!  I like to double the recipe and add one 14oz can of cream style corn and some dried cranberries (for a little flava).  I think the creamed corn keeps it nice and moist.  you do have to bake it longer for about 40 min.

The corn bread was good but I would like it to be a little sweeter. I'll probably add another 1/4c.

This is a really great cornbread for chili.   It was very moist and didn't crumble. I did add 1/4 cup more sugar to sweeten it up a bit. I think next time I'll add a bit of honey too. Overall this is a delicious cornbread.

This is the best corn bread we've ever had!  My kids and husband RAVED -- and wanted more!  I should have doubled the recipe!  Like others suggested, I doubled the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup and it was perfect.  Moist, buttery, and delicious corn bread!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is the best I've tried! I used this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! I added a small can of creamed corn, changing the sour cream to a 1/2  cup and added a total of a 1/2 cup of sugar. It was very quick and easy. My entire family thought it was so moist and couldn't wait to get the recipe from me. If you like REAL cornbread, you and everyone else, will LOVE this recipe!

The corn bread was spectacular!  I was looking for a recipe that didn't call for shortening, and I found this one.  I also used 1/2 cup sugar rather that 1/4. Never will I use Jiffy again!

This is delicious! 1/4 cup sugar was enough for a lightly sweet cornbread, which I thought was perfect because I prefer cornbread and not corncake. I subbed 0% plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream...it is much healthier and serves the same purpose.

What I don't like about most corn bread is that it's crumbly and dry.  It feels so dry in your mouth that you have to put a ton of butter on it to moisten it up.  My experience is that if you put sour cream in quick bread recipes, it produces a finer crumb and makes the product moister.   Perfect! OK, I am from Michigan, so I like my corn bread sweet.  ;)  I made some honey butter to go along with it.  Never got so many compliments on corn bread before. Thanks! Oh, I did add some no-salt canned corn - about a half of a can as I wanted some added texture.

Delicious! I made the following changes which made it come out wonderfully moist, sweet enough but not too sweet, and very fluffy. Definitely a favorite corn bread recipe: 1/2C of sugar; 1/3(ish)C of sour cream; a little less than 1/4C of butter, and 1 can of creamed corn. I then did what makes it best (how I grew up eating corn bread) and sprinkled a little bit of sugar and cinnamon over the top layer once it's in the pan. Husband who doesn't really like cornbread loved it!

To me this is the perfect corn bread. It's a little sweet and a little tangy from the sour cream. My husband likes it better than any other recipe I've tried.

Made the recipe exactly as written, and I wouldn't change a thing.  It had just the right amount of sweetness, great texture, was so moist it almost melted in your mouth, and popped right out of the pan.  This is 5 stars all the way in my book.

Everybody is right!  This recipe rocks.  Like others suggested, I added 1/2 c. sugar instead of just a 1/4.  I've been looking for a recipe that is moist and sweet...this is it!

This is so good but I would not call it a sweet cornbread. Next time I will up the sugar. I only had self-rising buttermilk corn meal (flour, salt & baking powder already mixed in) so I used 2 cups of this mix, and a little bit of soda. I left out the flour & baking powder. The rest of the recipe I followed. I cooked it a little bit longer than stated. I usually always make Jiffy but I will make this from now on. It cooked up beautifully & so moist! Thanks for sharing!

This cornbread is excellent!  My husband says it is the best he has ever had.  So I'll be making it over and over in the years to come!
I followed the recipe exactly - no changes needed!  The cornbread is soft, yet holds together well without crumbling (and crumbly bread/cake irritates me to no end).  The sweetness is perfect - not too much and not too little.  Five stars!!!

So, so, good!  I was in a hurry so just threw all the ingredients in a stand mixer for a minute, without mixing the dry and wet ingredients separately.  Loved it!

Pretty good and I am not a big fan of cornbread. A little bit dense but most cornbread is in my experience. I did double the sugar and it was just a little bit sweet - use more if you want it really sweet. I would have tried adding the creamed corn if I had some.

First - I doubled the recipe. However I did not double the sugar, I did the 1/3 cup plus 3 Tbs. I did add 1 can of creamed corn and originally thought I wouldn't need the milk but I did end up adding about 1/2 cup of rice milk.

I also took about 2/3 cup of batter out and added to that 1-2 Tbs of tomato powder and swirled it thru the main mixture.

What a wonderful flavor and so moist!  Served it with my chili and it was absolutely perfect!

Very good, moist corn bread.  Was a nice compliment to our turkey chili.  We prefer a little sweetness to our corn bread, so this was perfect.

Great corn bread.  I baked in my cast iron skillet.  cut sour cream down to 1/4 C, and added a can of creamed corn.  I also increased sugar to almost 3/4 C and plus added some honey.  Came out nice and slightly sweet.  Everyone loved it.  I have made this several times now.  a favorite.

I just made this corn bread for my nephew (who LOOOVVESS cornbread) for Thanksgiving, and it is exactly what I was looking for.  I also had tried several cornbread recipes, and they were all dry.  This is like eating cornbread cake.  I followed the instructions exactly, except I used 1/2 cup of sugar, and I sprinkled sugar on top of the batter before baking.  It came out delicious!  Thanks for another great recipe!  I will be making this again and again.

An absolutely delicious cornbread! I was a little surprised that it was called "Sweet" cornbread with only 1/4 cup of sugar, but the finished result was perfect, with just a light sweetness that my family really enjoyed. I loved the addition of sour cream...it made the cornbread really moist and gave it a wonderful, slightly "tangy" flavor that complimented the cornmeal very well. I made no changes, and made it exactly as written. I'd definitely make it again...thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

Made this for Mother's Day and it's the best I've ever had!  I made as is except I used a heaping 1/4 cup of sugar and used lite sour cream.  Everyone loved this and was so moist and tasty.  This is a keeper!

Excellent!  I made it as is (doubled) and it was cakey, not crumbly and mildly sweet.  Be aware, it is really thick batter but it turns out fabulous.

I used creamed corn in this recipe, upped the sugar to 1/2c, and used 1/2c yogurt in place of the sour cream (I was out of sour cream).  This was delicious, my husband said we had to keep this recipe. I thought it might be a little too moist, but I can change that next time I make it (lessen the yogurt or milk). The next day, my husband mixed the leftover cornbread with an egg then deep fried it in balls for the best hushpuppies ever!!  Try it, it's delicious  :)

Very good, but thanks to my 8mos old, I left it in the oven too long. Don't overcook or it gets pretty crumbly.

Gave this 4 stars because I feel there are 2 key ingredients to add that are not actually part the recipe. Adding a can of creamed corn and doubling the sugar in this recipe really make it great. I found that I need to cook it a little longer then the recipes calls for with those changes. With the creamed corn and extra sugar this is very yummy and 5 star worthy!

Crazy good!  The 3rd time I made it I added some corn and that made THE best tasting corn bread I've ever had!  WOW!
I've even butchered this recipe to make it wheat-free & dairy-free (I used butter still)...using spelt flour & rice milk & plain yoghurt (instead of s.cream) and they STILL turned out good!  Thanks!

The husband said that this was the best cornbread ever. I tried the recipe as directed, except I didn't have any sour cream. So, I substituted vanilla yogurt. The consistency was good--not too gritty. I will try it next with creamed corn as some reviewers have.

Really, really good. Everything I want in a corn bread. Moist and sweet and just the right amount of fluffiness. Next time I make this I may make a bigger batch or bake it in a smaller pan so the pieces are thicker, but that's just a personal preference.

Moist, yes.  The taste was very light.  I did double the sugar, but it still seemed like it needed more taste.  Thanks for the formula.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  The only change I made was to use 1/2 cup of sugar -It definitely needed the extra sugar. Instead of making cornbread, I made it into 10 corn muffins and baked for 20 minutes. Yummy!

I've made this recipe twice.  It is very moist and makes a wonderful addition to any meal.  The second time I made it, I doubled the amount of sugar ( 1/2 cup)and I liked the result better.  Although the original was good with main course meals (chili, etc.), the sweeter version was delicious when eaten on its own.  Either way, it's a great recipe!

Definitely double the recipe and add 1 can cream corn, reduce sour cream to 1/4 cup.  You may need to increase baking time a bit.  Great bread!

I'm baking it right now. I did something different based on everyone saying to add more sugar. I actually melted the sugar and butter down together with another almost 1/4 cup brown sugar and added the milk to it to cool then added the egg and sour cream before combining with the dry mixture. Cross my fingers.. It came out really tasty, however, next time I'll unbalance the flour and corn meal in the favor of the corn meal. Was too much evidence of flour in the taste. but super moist though.

I made this recipe for 32 employees and it was a great hit. I was asked for the recipe and had to refer them to this website. I doubled the sugar, cut the sour cream in half and used a 14oz can of cream style corn for a 9x13. It was awesome.

Wonderful- only gave 4 stars because I took other suggestions to add creamed corn and increase sugar to 1/2 cup.  My adjustment: I only had regular canned corn, so I put it in my blender with some of the milk mixture, and voila: creamed corn!

Great recipe!  I made a couple of changes - used plain yogurt instead of sour cream and added 1/4 cup real maple syrup.  I also preheat a glass pie plate with 2 tablespoons of butter (till butter sizzles) and then add batter to hot pan - it makes a great crispy crust.

I made this bread exactly according to the recipe and there weren't any leftovers!  I found the sweetness was an excellent companion to a spicy or hot dish.  I've made it with a spicy black bean soup and and also with a very spicy chili.  The sweet bread complimented both perfectly!

Only change; double the sugar.  This is perfect, and it goes with so many meals. It is easy to make, and the sour cream is just what you need to keep it moist. I make this at least once a week. YUMMY!

Excellent, moist corn bread.  Everyone loved it!  I, too, doubled the amount of sugar by using 1/2 sugar and 1/2 splenda.  I also used reduced fat sour cream.  Very, very yummy!  Thanks!

Very good.  I used a little extra sugar as others suggested and made these into muffins.  A double recipe makes 21 corn muffins when using a level 1/4 cup as a scoop.  Mine were ready in 17 minutes.  I made over 100 of these for a party and they were well-received and got compliments.  Thank you.

This is the best cornbread I have ever had. It is so moist and sweet. I added the extra sugar like some people suggested. I like to add a little sugar in the bottom of the pan before I add the batter and sprinkle some more on the top before I bake it. It give it a crunchy crust. I will be making this again. No more store bought mixes.

My family loves the corn bread from a BBQ restaurant in town so I was on a mission to find a recipe for one like it. I'm thankful to say that they loved this corn bread as much if not more! I did use 1/2 cup sugar and reduced the sour cream to 1/4 cup and added a can of creamed corn as recommended by other reviews.  Thanks so much!

This recipe was excellent. It comes out moist and fluffy. I did add more sugar (1/2 cup) to make it more sweet, but it is not necessary.

I used fat free sour cream and skim milk. Most corn bread recipes I've tried have been too dry and not sweet enough, but this was moist with a touch of sweetness.  I would probably add more sugar as others have noted next time.

Made these as mini-muffins for a soup party. Made them a week ahead and froze them - turned out great, probably due to the sour cream. Doubled the recipe and got 6 dz. Not as sweet as I expected - but that was ok. Like a previous reviewer about half of the corn meal I used was not ground fine (used what I had)and they turned out a bit gritty - and while that was ok I would prefer to use a finer grind next time.

Moist, sweet and delicious. I used buttermilk rather than regular milk and it came out great. Even halfing the portions to make a smaller portion works great. If you're looking for a sweet, moist, great tasting corn bread this one will be perfect!

Don't let the number of ingredients fool you, this recipe really was easy to make.  It held together nice and wasn't crumbly at all. I added green chiles to the 2nd batch I made and it was delicious.  Definitely a keeper!

Yummy, this was really good!  I increased the sugar to 1/2 cup, and it tasted just right.  A friend of mine asked for the recipe, and my husband loved it too.  I only had 1/2 cup of all purpose flour so I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and it turned out a bit crumbly but I think it's becuase of the whole wheat flour.  The sour cream did great to keep it moist.  I will make it again when I get more regular flour ;o)  Very good recipe!!

This was pretty good, although next time I will increase the amount of sugar just a bit, maybe 1/2 cup?  

Be sure to use fine cornmeal also--I used coarse-ground cornmeal, and while the taste was great, it felt like I was chewing on sand!  My mistake!  

Instead of a 8" square baking dish,  baked it in a 8" cast iron skillet for about 25-30 minutes and it turned out great!  I will definitely make this again!

I just had this with some chilli and it was very good. While it was not, dry it was not as moist as a corn bread recipe I've used previously (now lost). That one however was not sweet at all so I have no issues with the small amount of sugar in this one, especially if it's going to be paired with something spicy. The only thing I would do differently is add some creamed corn. If I had read the reviews before I started I might have.

Wow! Quite good! I used one reviewer's suggestion and added one cup of creamed corn, cutting the sour cream by half. Delicious, moist, and cake-like texture. Will definitely make this again.

I really liked this! I added another 1/4c. sugar, as other reviewers suggested, because I like my cornbread sweet. I gave it 4 stars because I like my cornbread a little less cakey and more crumbly.

Super easy to make but not a ton of flavor.  My first batch, I followed the recipe as directed using low-fat sour cream.  As the flavor was lacking, I used regular sour cream and added additional sugar on the second batch which was a bit better.  I would make this again as it went well with spicy chili but I wouldn't make these as a solo side dish.

Lovely flavour with the bit of honey I added at the end, but it was very heavy despite following a suggestion to mix for 5 minutes to get some air in the batter . Might be due to the flour in England as I find cakes to be very heavy here too.

Very nice recipe.  Have searched through quite a few cornbread recipes and haven't found one that wow'ed me yet.  I do like this one.  --I didn't have sour cream so I used kefir (milky yogurt) in its place and it was still very smooth and flavorful.  My family didn't think it needed extra sugar as we didn't want corn cake and we like to put honey on top.  Will make this recipe again.

So delicious. The second time I made it I used 3/4 cup sour cream and only 1/4 cup milk and used a half can of creamed corn. I also added a little paprika and garlic salt to the dry mixture. By the recipie or with a couple changes, it comes out great.

This is a keeper...and simple too!  I combined this with another recipe for ham muffinwiches by using greased muffin pans filled half full with cornbread batter and topped with diced leftover ham and shredded cheddar.  Yummy!

I have made this several times and followed recipe exact...YUMMY!  Well, last night had planned to make with dinner when I found I had no sour cream.  I decided to puree some cottage cheese.  I just added the milk plus 2 Tbls and put in blender.  The batter was slightly thinker.  It was fantastic, creamier then original and soooo moist!  This recipe was already great, but now even better.

great lowfat cornbread! I substituted 1/4 cup honey for the 1/4 cup sugar (to make it even healthier) and it turned out perfectly. Went great with our chili dinner.

First time I have ever made cornbread.  This turned out to the best I have ever tasted! Sour cream keeps it moist so it does not crumble as most cornbread does.  Added just a dollop of maple syrup but not enough to taste: will maybe add more next time.

This recipe was a major turn in my cornbread baking struggles. My cornbread always turned out dry and lacking in flavor. With this recipe my cornbread turned out moist and flavorful. My wife likes a lot of sweetness in her cornbread (she thinks it's candy of something) so I doubled the sugar in the recipe. It really is a hit and people have even asked me for the recipe! Now I can barely remember being a cornbread failure. My great thanks to Virginia Hanker for submitting this recipe.

This is one of the most amazing things I've ever made! Hubby and I can't get enough. Perfectly sweet to go with spicy chili.   Here's the changes I made: Substitute the sour cream for a thick yogurt (we just don't do sour cream and the sub is 1:1). Double the sugar (though that makes it super sweet). Add a generous squeeze of honey (1 Tablespoon?)

Delicious.  Should probably store leftovers in refirgerator, though.  Ours turned "funky" within a couple of days.  It was great fresh and warm, though!  My kids thought it was the best.

This was fabulous. Followed the suggestion to add 1/4 cup of sugar, reduce sour cream and add 1/2 lg can of creamed corn.  It was so moist and had a great flavor.

I have made this recipe a couple of times. Both times, I used 1 Tsp of baking powder and omitted the baking soda. The first time, I used 1/2 cup of sugar and added 1/4 cup honey. My husband loved it, but I thought it was too sweet. The second time, I used a heaping 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup honey, and both of us thought it was perfect. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I thought I had enough sour cream left...but no. Only had 2/3 cups so I completed with 1/3 cup of unsweetened apple sauce and it turned out great!!  I did put 1/3 cup of sugar instead of 1/4 (as per previous comments) and added the rest of my dried cranberries...YUMMY!

The BEST corn bread!! I have made corn bread that I could knock someone out with, dense, hard, horrible. This is so light, sweet and flavorfull, can't say enough. I did like others, 1/2 C. sugar and 1/2 C. sour cream and one small can of cream corn. PERFECT, Thank you so much for this recipe. First time I made it, it was gone the same day, I have to insist now, that my family show control!!

Extremely moist and tasty.  I added 1/4 cup honey to the wet ingredients before combining them with the dry ingredients.  This gave the corn bread a wonderful honey flavor.  Best corn bread I've ever made!

This recipe is amazing! I did make some modifications and it was out of this world. I like my cornbread sweet and fluffy so I added an extra egg and an extra 1/4 cup of sugar. I also substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream (no sour cream in Turkey). My father and I thought it was perfect, but my mother and sister thought it was just a bit too sweet; so I may use only 1/3 cup of sugar next time. Absolutely delicious!

I give this a 4 star because I found it a bit grainy but other than that it was good.

Doubling the sugar and replacing some of the sour cream with creamed corn is the way to go!  Best corn bread I've ever made.

I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 1/4 cup. And used 1/3 cup of sour cream and added a can of creamed corn!! So sweet and tastey!! I will definitely be making this again!

I love cornbread but this was my first attempt at making cornbread.  I added 1/4 cup of honey and used buttermilk.  It was yummy with the chili I made for dinner.  I also made the cornbread in my cast iron skillet and baked it in the oven.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe.  Making it again tonight to eat with stew.

I love my corn bread sweet and moist, not dry and boring like Jiffy so I decided to whip this up to go along with dinner I was making.  A major plus was that I already had most of the ingredients so it was very cost effective.  After reading all the reviews, I modified it and added 1/2 cup sugar instead of a 1/4 cup.  I also put some butter on top when it was almost done and sprinkled on some sugar.  It cooked in 21 minutes in an 8x8 and was one of the best corn breads I've ever tasted!  I couldn't believe I had made it, it tastes just like corn muffins from Dunkin Donuts!  This recipe was exactly what I was looking for... if you make this, it is sure to be a hit!  I'm serving it again on Sunday with chili!

I made this cutting down the sour cream and adding the can of creamed corn, and it turned out great.  I also added some pepperjack cheese in the batter.  When almost done, I brushed with butter and sprinkled sugar and broiled for a minute to brown the top.

I've never made homemade corn bread, and I'm so happy that this attempt was successful. I wasn't expecting the bread to be so moist and fluffy.  I prefer a sweeter corn bread, so next time I'll double the sugar as suggested by other members. I'll never use the boxed mix again.

I am a real fan of corn bread and this one is wonderful!  I couln't stop eating it.  The only change I made to the recipe was to use light sour cream.  Very very good.  Everyone who tried it liked it very much.  Thanks for sharing!

Easy to make and the best cornbread recipe I've tried (and I've tried several). Original recipe is very moist and not too sweet but I added one can of creamed corn and now it's extra tasty. I've also made these into muffins (baked for 20 minutes) and also corn dog muffins (I added 3-4 chunks of hot dog into each muffin before baking). This recipe always turns out fantastic. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best recipe for corn bread I have found so far.  I followed recipe exactly and found it was plenty sweet enough for our tastes and very light and moist.  Also this is easier than my previous "favorite" recipe, since I don't have to spend anytime cutting shortening into the dry ingredients.

When I made this corn bread, it came out a little dry.  As a result, I made a few modifications: 1/2 cup milk, 5 tablespoons butter, and 3/4 cup sugar.  It was delicious.  The extra butter made it buttery and the extra milk kept it moist.  And because I like my corn bread sweet, I added the extra sugar.

Ever have one of those days where you seem to be out of everything? Ahh, the joy of substitutions. I started making this last night, only to then discover that I had corn grits instead of corn meal, and only baking powder, no soda. Although much coarser, the corn grits were no problem at all, but my online search said that substituting for baking soda could not be done. I ended up trying anyway, putting in 1 1/2 tsp. of baking powder to make up for the difference, and the muffins were still amazing. Therefore, I give this recipe 5 stars for taste and 5 stars for flexibility!

Hands down this is one awesome cornbread!  I've made it 3 times in the past 3 weeks and today I'm bringing it to Thanksgiving dinner as one of my contributions!  Delicious warm or cold, with or without butter (I like any excuse to slap a little butter on anything!)  Enjoy folks it really is wonderful.

OH MY GOSH! This was the best recipe ever! My kids and I couldn't quit eating it. I didn't have cornmeal on hand so I used 1 cup quick-cooking oats ground up in the food processor (to make it fine like cornmeal)and it still turned out moist and delicious. I also did as others suggested and used 1/2 cup sugar instead of 1/4 cup because I like my corn bread sweet. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks for sharing! P.S. It even tastes great without butter on top, but who'd want cornbread without the butter? =)

I went with the other reveiws and added the 1/2 cup of sugar,  but did not change anything else. This cornbread was super moist and fluffy. It was quick to put together and only took 20 minutes to cook.  My husband loved it.  No doubt this will be my turn to recipe from now on :)

I make this all the time, it's the best.  I have tried many corn bread recipes, but this one by far is the best.

OH MY GOSH this is SO good!!!  Now I know why the sour cream makes such a difference!  I added the extra sugar and didn't even need the extra butter and honey on top when it was done (I don't think I could stop eating it if I did). I used lite sour cream and it turned out great.  This will become your favorite!!

wasn't all that impressed with this corn bread.  The texture was great and it was nice and moist but the flavor just wasn't there.  I'm still on the lookout for my perfect corn bread reciepe.

This is a TERRIFIC recipe!  The bread is moist and not at all crumbly or dry OR grainy!  We love corn bread but don't like it when it comes out dry - this was perfect.  I didn't change a thing as we like to put honey on ours so it didn't need extra sugar.  Also just putting a chunk of melted butter on each piece topped it off nicely.

This was fantastic. My husband who really doesn't care for corn bread loved it. I will be using this as my only corn bread recipe.  I also used 1/2 cup sugar as suggested by others.

Absolutely wonderful.  The sour cream makes this just melt in your mouth.  Served with honey and no dessert was necessary.  I thought the amount of sugar in recipe was fine.

Very good cornbread, definitely better than the mix.  I added 1/4 cup of sugar since I like things sweet and added half a can of corn.  Yummy!

This made a very tasty cornbread muffin.  I whipped up some honey butter and they disappeared during dinner.  I usually end up throwing away some dried up corn bread a few days later, but NO LEFTOVERS with this recipe!

The only modification was to use Splenda in place of sugar.

This was the absolute BEST cornbread I have ever made!  I did add extra sugar (1/2 c. total), and I threw in some leftover canned white corn, probably about 1/3 c.  This cornbread did require every bit of the cooking time, in my oven, and maybe a bit more.  But the sweetness and the moistness, well, it was fabulous!  This is going to be the ONLY cornbread made in this house from now on!

This was pretty good.  The sour cream helps to make it moist and not crumbly like a lot of cornbreads out there.  It tastes great the next day if you toast it and put some butter on it.  Mmmm....

Very nice cornbread recipe.  I like mine on the sweet side, so I doubled the sugar as recommended my another reviewer.  It was perfect. My only criticism was that the bread didn't look perfect.  The recipe makes a very stiff batter and it didn't level itself out well.  The result what a somewhat craggy looking bread.  But it tasted so good that we really didn't care.  :-)

Great recipe. I used it to make a corn casserole. I followed the recipe, but added 1/4 cup more of sugar, 1 can of creamed corn and 1 can of corn nibblets drained and baked it until golden brown. It came out excellent. I'll be making this again next week for Thanks Giving.

Perfect for my tasting with few changes. I didn't have sour cream on hand so used low-fat cream cheese (softened at room temp) and added more milk at the end as the batter was way to thick. It was still on the thicker side when going into the oven, but at least it was "scoop-able". I also added 1/2 t of vanilla and about 2T more sugar. They came out very delicious and I will try again with sour cream next time. I think you should use full fat, instead of low fat for the texture to come out right. They were crumbly, but I think corn bread SHOULD be crumbly! Thanks for the recipe!

Love this corn bread!!! the last time I made it I used buttermilk instead of regular milk, and I fried the batter in a cast iron skillet for 5 minutes before tossing it in the oven.. it came out with a nice crunchy edge. 

I have also put hot peppers in the mix.

I have made this recipe a dozen times since finding it.  It is the best cornbread I have ever made.  I usually use plain yogurt in place of sour cream because where I live, sour cream is difficult to find.  

Seriously delicious.

I made a slight variation, which was extremely good, and I believe that the original must be a 5-star recipe.  I substituted low-fat plain yogurt for the sour cream, I used 5 tablespoons of butter instead of 4, and I used 3/8 cup sugar instead of 1/4 cup.  The result was pleasantly slightly sweet and plenty rich.  At the same time, the yogurt, standing in for sour cream, gave the corn bread a nice depth of flavor.

This was a great basic recipe. I was low on milk so I used sweetened condensed milk and only used 1T sugar. I also subbed in 0% fat greek yogurt for half the sour cream to minimize fat but retain moisture. I also added whole kernal frozen corn for authenticity :). It was delicious!

Corn bread was not sweet at all, it was really bland.I added extra milk because my batter was very thick. Also the texture is grainy. Overall it's easy to make.

I was so excited to make this recipe especially with all the reviews.  I was a little disappointed on the final product.  It was okay but not out of this world as people reviewed.

My family isn't crazy about corn bread, but they all liked this. I followed one reviewer and put in a little less sour cream, and added a can of creamed corn. Delicious and moist, not crumbly and dry! Just the right amount of sweetness.

This recipe is pretty good, but still not as good as Whole Foods' cornbread. I modified it a bit and got a little closer to that sweet, cakey cornbread I love. I added an extra egg and an extra 1/4 cup of sugar (for a total of 2 eggs and 1/2 cup of sugar). I also used nonfat plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. It came out nice!

Very moist and sweet. It would be even better if it was more "corny". GREAT recipe BUT the bottom and sides were very browned (almost want to say burned...). I didn't think I baked it to long because I kept checking with a knife. Any advice?

We loved this bread. It is sweet, delicious and moist. I added a couple of extra tablespoons of sugar and about a quarter cup of honey. I also baked in a preheated cast iron skillet for 20 minutes and it turned out perfect

I have made this several times now. I sub corn meal for mesa. This gives it a smoother texture but still crumbly  and corny. A little honey never hurts. I have also omitted the sour cream for more butter and milk. Naturally, the recipe is best as is. I only substitute as necessary.

Tried this recipe as the inaugural dish for our hand-me-down cast iron skillet.  Other than melting a bit of bacon grease in the bottom of the skillet before pouring in the batter, we followed the recipe exactly.  This is the first cornbread we have ever liked!  It was even good the next day, though the bacony crust had lost its crunch.  Yum!

Changed recipe a little -- now a keeper forever! Increased the sugar to 1/2 cup, added a whole can of creamed corn, reduced sour cream to 1/4 cup and added some leftover corn.  Loved the texture, density and sweetness.

I used whole wheat flour, only 3/4 cup of sour cream and almost a whole can of creamed corn - had to bake for 30 min at 400 but it still turned out lovely.

This was really good, but I thought it needed to be just a bit sweeter.  Next time I will double the sugar or add honey.

THIS BREAD IS AWESOME, I USED THE MODIFIED REFCIPE WITH THE 1/2 CAN CREAMED CORN AND THE 1/2 CUP OF SUGAR. THIS INCREASED THE SWEETNESS AND MOISTNESS TO PERFECTION. i SPRAYED MY CORNING SQUARE DISH AND BAKED IN THAT IT GAVE IT A CRUSTY CRUST. YUMMMMMMY. THANKS SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE

The flavor of this was very good, but I had two issues. 1)This turned out flat. Not super flat, but not like the picture shows me it should look like and 2)My cornbread sunk in the middle, even after the toothpick test. I followed the recipe exact, only using whole wheat white flour, I made no other changes unless you call using organic ingredients change. I'll try this again and see if it was operator error. Maybe add more baking powder next time? I would normally not rate something three stars if it tasted good but I had to throw a good portion of this away because the middle was not done. I'm a pretty solid baker, so this happening was weird for me.

Finally, a cornbread the whole family likes! I used plain non-fat yogurt. Even though I'm usually trying to cut the amount of sugar in recipes, I was happy I read the reviews, and also used 1/2 c. sugar. I think it is the right amount for this cornbread to be considered sweet.

WOW!  This corn bread is great!  I have made a lot of bread but this one takes the "cake".  I made it exactly as directed.  This one is defintely a keeper.  A friend of mine doesn't like sour cream but when I told him it had sour cream he said "This is to good to have sour cream in it".  Made a believe out of him!

I've been looking for just the right cornbread recipe for a long time, and I think that this one is it! It's really easy, and very delicious. The yogurt helps keep the cornbread moist, even if it gets overbaked a bit. Next time I make it I will be doubling the recipe, since my family gobbled this right up.

I'm updating my first review.  I personally like this cornbread as is, but I thought I'd make it a little sweeter for the kids and hubby so I replaced vanilla yogurt for the sour cream and it was delicious!

A perfect recipe. I was afraid I overcooked it when I saw how golden brown it was on top, but inside it was STILL super moist. The texture isn't the same monotonous cakey texture of most cornbreads; the key to this is to mix the dry and wet until JUST moistened.

First time making homemade corn bread.  Very impressed with the recipe.  I did add more sugar and sour cream but other than that--it was superb.  My family loves it and I have made it almost every week  too.

These are fantastic! Very easy and tastes great.  I tried another cornbread recipe for my family Christmas dinner, and they turned out awful!Before making these for a group of people, I thought I would test it on my husband, and he loved them! :) Next time I was to try them with corn as others have suggested!

5 stars plus:  I made this as per the recipe with the exception of 2 tablespoons of local honey.  I sneeze a bit and am trying to get over the conflict.  This cornbread recipe is awesome.  Thank you.  I will adjust with my needs.  Great seed.

Great, moist cornbread! I doubled the sugar as suggested and it was perfectly sweet. I did everything else the same though. The sour cream really adds to the moist bread. Thanks!

Great texture. I prefer the "creaminess", if you will, of this recipe compared to the "crumbly" texture of boxed corn bread. My family really enjoyed this recipe. Thank you.

I changed up the recipe a bit, following the recommendation of adding 1/4 cup of sour cream and 1 can of cream styled corn. I kept everything else the same, however. The recipe says that you only need to bake it for 20-25 mins but I had to keep my batch in for about 40 mins. I thought it came out a bit dry and my sister also agreed. Next time I think I will add a tad more of sour cream. It was still pretty good though and everyone enjoyed them! Thanks for sharing!

I tried this for our "traditional" Halloween dinner of Chili, cornbread and pumpkin pie.  It got two thumbs up from the whole family.  I doubled the recipe and added a can of creamed corn, and a generous squeeze of honey.  Yummy!

This was quick,easy, moist and pretty good! It is necessary to add the can of sweet corn to make it extra tasty. I too used 1/2 cup of sugar.

The best cornbread I have ever made, my husband is not a big fan of cornbread and he absolutely loves this one! I added the additional 1/4 cup of sugar as some of the others recommended. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious! I used 1/3 cup sugar, reduced the butter to 2 tablespoons, added 2 tablespoons sour cream and a cup of frozen corn. I served it with honey mustard chicken from this site and it made for a splendid combination. I think this recipe would work well with add ins too and depending on what you plan to serve it with you might consider green chilles, bacon, or cheddar cheese.

This is by far the best corn bread recipe that I have ever made!I followed the recipe almost exactly adding just a little bit more sugar since I was having it with chili and wanted the contrast of flavors! This is a moist delicious corn bread! I will definately make this over and over again! Thank you!!

Very good recipe. My kids love corn bread so I was looking for that special recipe...and this is it! They request it all the time. I usually make exactly as directed, I have used creamed corn as other reviewers suggested it it was very good. This recipe is a hit! Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely fantastic! I was looking for a cornbread recipe with less sugar and, oddly, found one with only a quarter cup listed as "Sweet Corn Bread." Well, it was definitely sweet (and flavorful, and moist) enough for me and my family. Also, while it is definitely delicious with sour cream, I have substituted that with plain yoghurt, when I didn't have the sour cream. Almost as good, and lower in fat.

This was such a great tasting cornbread.  It was lighter than I expected which was nice and it was very tasty. A family pleaser. I would not change a thing except maybe to double it for more, it was that good!!

This is delicious corn bread!  I have used both white and wholewheat flour and both turn out great.  If you are used to wholewheat breads you'll enjoy it that way.

Wonderful! I tried to make them a little healthier by using 1/2 butter 1/2 applesauce. They still tasted great! I made them as muffins and it made about 22. They were perfect! I will definitely make these again!

This is the best cornbread recipe I have ever tried! I added a bit more milk because the batter seemed a little thick and made corn muffins instead of baking in a pan. They came out great!

Thank you for a very good recipe for corn bread. I used another recipe an it just wasn't right. This recipe is moist and delicious. The only change I made was more sugar. My family LOVES sweet corn bread!!

Good cornbread - maybe a bit light on the 'sweet' part.  Also, although the sour cream was a neat idea, I'm not sure that it added an advantage that was worth the extra fat and calories.  I may try another recipe that calls for creamed corn next time.  Thank you for the recipe!

MMMMM!  I made this cornbread to go with vegetarian chili for a Super Bowl party.  It was a HIT!  The only thing I changed, per other reviewers' recommendations, was to increase the sugar (I increased it to 1/3 cup).  I'm not usually a fan of cornbread, but I really did like this recipe a lot.

I have made this corn bread several times. The BEST time (and how I will make it from now on) is using 1/2 c sour cream and 1/2 c cream corn. MMM! Tasted just like sweet corn cake that you get in some Mexican restaurants. My husband looved it with the alterations.

This corn bread was excellent. Very moist and tasty and didn't fall apart! I took other reviewers advice and doubled the sugar with an extra 1/4 cup using demerara sugar (I prefer its taste to white sugar). I would guess brown sugar might be nice to use too as a partial replacement.

these were good.  very corn meal-y.  i thought it would come out a little more cakey, but that's ok.  they weren't that sweet either.  i think i'll add a 1/2 c instead of 1/4 c of sugar.  i baked 12 large muffins using this recipe using the suggested baking time, and they came out perfect.

I got my super picky 7 year old to eat this!!!The cornbread was delicious! Like other reviewers I made a couple of additions. I added 1 small can of sweet creamed corn(or half reg. size can), 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup sugar instead of 1/4 cup. I will most definately be making this one again!!

I have tried a few corn bread recipes and this one beats the others by far.  i have tried adding creamed corn and it just wasn't quite right.  but this recipe hit the spot.  instead of adding sour cream i used vanilla yogurt (because i just didn't have enough sour cream).  i also added more sugar.  it was moist and fantastic.  :)

Excellent!  Moist and sweet.  I only had 1/2 c. sour cream so I added an extra 1/2 c. milk plus 1/8 c. flour.  Used 1/3 c. sugar too.  Baked in a 9x9 pan for 19 min.  It was perfect, everyone loved it!

This is really close to what I was looking for, I think if I just make a few adjustments this will be the perfect recipe. As is it's very good by itself! I would defanently pass on to friends.

This was a good recipe but a little drier than expected.  Perhaps I will substitute 1/2 cup of buttermilk next time.  It had a nice flavor..

I didn't have enough sour cream, so I had to add more milk. This was good, but I can't wait to try it with all the sour cream, and I will add 1/2 cup sugar, and I'd like to try it with some cream corn. A nice recipe.

The best cornbread I've ever been able to make (but not the best I've ever eaten) -thanks for the recipe! 
I didn't have sour cream so I substituted yogurt, and doubled the sugar as several other people suggested.... it came out very moist and tasty.

Easy to make.  Soft, smooth, delicious flavor, but very crumble.  Hard to split open and butter.  Still very yummy to eat plain.  My family loved it!

This is the best corn bread I've ever had in my life!  My husband agrees.  I have always used the Betty Crocker recipe and we quite like that but it doesn't hold a candle to this one.  I only had about 2/3 cup of sour cream in my fridge, so I used 1/3 cup plain yogurt (I figured they're both dairy, they're both sour, and they're both moist) and it really worked fine.  This is our new corn bread for keeps.

This is the 1st time I ever made cornbread, and what a perfect recipe to do so! My boyfriend and roommate both LOVED it. I took the advice of some other reviewers by reducing the sour cream and adding a can of cream corn. My boyfriend wasn't big on there actually being corn in the cornbread , but I really liked it. Next time I'll stick to the original recipe and see what he thinks.

OK-I joined in and used a can of creamed corn and lessened the sour cream to 1/4 cup but I neglected to pay attention to the tip of adding in a tad more sugar.  For my taste buds it really needed it.  The bread was so wonderfully moist and would have been more than perfect if only it was sweeter.  Next time I will do 1/2 cup sugar and this will be a percect corn bread recipe for me.

I loved this bread!  I lightened it up a bit by using applesauce in place of butter.  I also used light sour cream and egg beaters.  This was delish!!

This was a great cornbread.  I usually buy the kind in a box.  But this will be our favorite from now on.  I did add 1/4 cup more sugar.  Even though I'm in the South I don't care for Southern cornbread.  I like my sweeter. Thanks.

This cornbread came out wonderful.  I added a can of creamed corn and the extra 1/4 cup of sugar and we all really enjoyed it.  If you don't like your cornbread sweet leave out the extra sugar.

This bread is very good.  It is nice and moist, but doesn't completely fall apart when you pick it up.  The creamed corn was a nice touch, really made it good.  The only thing is mine needed to cook for longer than it says.

I did as other reviewers stated.  I added one can of creamed corn, added a total of 1/2 cups of sugar, and reduced the sour cream to half.  I added some honey to the mix as well. My step daughter said that the cornbread was "extremely good".  My husband said the cornbread was great.  I give it four stars for the recipe as is, I give it five stars for the recipe based on other reviewers.

I thought this was a fairly easy recipe and was so good!  I'm very pleased with the results.  As there are only 2 of us in the house I scaled it down and it still came out great!

I'm rating this a "5" for ease and taste.  My 9-year old made this with little supervision.  We didn't have sour cream so we subbed vanilla yoghurt instead.  Also, doubled the sugar, as suggested by other reviewers. Resulted in an extremely moist, pleasant corn bread.  Tip:  We put all the wet ingredients in a blender and mixed it up before adding to dry to insure a smooth wet mixture.  We'll definately make it again.  Thanks for sharing!

This was simple, fast, and wonderful!
I added a little honey and I would add a little more next time because it was just a little crumbly.  But I might have been a little short on the sour cream too.  Regardless.  INCREDIBLE and my kids just gobbled it up.

So good. I took other reviewers advice and increased the sugar and used buttermilk instead of plain milk. My family ate it all in one sitting. I will definately make this again.

Excellent.  I used 1/2 cup of sugar.  UPDATE 07/01/2010 - I "baked" this in my crock pot because I did not want to heat up the house by baking it in the oven.  I made the recipe as written (except I used 1/2 cup of sugar), then I poured the batter in my greased crock pot.  Cooked on high for 3 hours.  It was just as good as the baked version!

I went a little less on the sugar since were not crazy about real sweat corn bread. We like to sweeten it ourselves with honey. My family liked this corn bread better than traditional southern cornbread. The sourcream made it moist and cake like. I still prefer the traditional one. Overall it went good with ham and bean soup.

Unbelievable recipe!  I did up the sugar to 1/2 cup and after it came out of the oven I smeared some softened butter over the whole cake.  I have been looking for the perfect corn bread and in my humble opinion, this is it.  Thanks for a winner!

This is by far the best cornbread I have ever tasted!  I did tweak it slightly.  I added a 1/2 cup of sugar rather than 1/4 cup, used egg substitue rather than real eggs, reduced fat sour cream, and 1% milk.  It was perfect - very moist and nice and sweet.  This will be the only cornbread recipe I use from now on.  Thank you!

I wanted to try this recipe before I made for Thanksgiving, and I LOVE it!  It's moist and fluffy, and has a nice sweet flavor.....I, like many others, changed the sugar amount to 1/2 cup.  I'll never used boxed mixes again.

Best corn bread recipe I've found to date!  I took others' suggestions and upped the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup.   Also, since I didn't have that much sour cream on hand I ended up using a mixture of 1/2 cup of sour cream and the rest milk.  Still turned out moist and deliscious.

This was very good.  I love cornbread but my family seems to only really like the cornbread from Marie Callendars restaurants.  With this sweet cornbread recipe - which is a little lighter than traditional recipes, I got closer.  They liked it and I thought it was quite good as well with no adjustments.

Oh man, this corn bread ROCKS!  With 1/2 cup sugar (brown/white mixed),  buttermilk and heavy cream in place of milk, and baked in a glass baking dish...  this stuff if phenomenal, and most importantly, easy!  


We eat this with tons of honey and whipped butter, but it would be good plain as well.

I thought this cornbread was excelent. I love my cornbread soft, moist, and sweet, and that is exactly what I got. Made a few changes. Added an extra 1/4 sugar like people suggested, added 1/4 honey, and added buttermilk instead of milk. Only had a 1/2 cup sour cream so I substituted the rest in buttermilk. Still turned out fabulous.

Prepared this for supper tonight along with turkey chili, topped with coarsely grated cheddar cheese... my fiance declared it is the best meal I've made to date.  The sour cream in the recipe makes all the difference, it was absolutely delicious.  Kudos to the creator :)

This recipe deserves more than five stars.  I did increase the sugar and accidently omitted the butter, but it  still turned out AWESOME!!!  I served it with chili and was a HUGE hit - a definite keeper.

I made this with a course ground corn meal, and the texture was not pleasant. Better stick with a finer grind. This recipe may be a little too soft and cake like for some.

Pretty good, and I hate to be a party pooper, but the box mix from Trader Joe's is better.  I guess I'll stick to that for next time.

Wow! My husband and I love this recipe. The texture was fluffy and it was wonderfully moist without being greasy. It also stays very well. I didn't have cornmeal so I used fine ground corn flour that you use for tortillas but my husband actually really liked the smoother texture.  I also used a 1/2 cup sugar as many others  recommended and I'm glad I did. Even with that tweaking I still give this recipe 5 stars because we loved it so much.

This is so yummy. My husband says that this reminds him of his grandmother's sweet cornbread. I did up the sugar to a heaping 1/2 cup. This is really good and is a cross between corn bread and a corn bread cake. Thanks for the post.

Loved this cornbread.  It was so easy to make and just the right amount of sweetness.  Mine was slightly undercooked in the middle, but I would do it that way again because it gave it some additional moistness.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great recipe - very moist.  I used 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup Splenda because other reviewers recommended more sweetness.  I also substituted half the flour with white whole wheat flour.  The whole family enjoyed.  Thanks!

This cornbread is so moist and flavorful!  I've already made this several times (for our family and to take to friends), and everyone has asked for the recipe!  As other reviewers suggested, I increased the sugar to 1/2 cup and then added a little more milk.  Very easy too!  Thank you.

oooooh... this is a good one!  No more dried out corn bread for us!  This was like eating a very moist piece of cake.  The sour cream makes such a big difference.  And the best part is that while most cornbread is dry and inedible the next day, this tasted even better the more it sat. I can't wait to make muffins with this recipe.

This was a super good, moist corn bread.  I've made corn bread in the past that was too dry and this one was just right.  Everyone loved it.  I did double the sugar, like someone else suggested and it was the perfect level of sweetness.

Everyone loved this.  I made it for Thanksgiving and got raves.  Even my picky eater couldn't get enough!  This makes a great substitute for those all too sweet corn muffins. I doubled the sugar and found it was just the right balance.

This recipe is great.  I live in a country which does not sell Jiffy premade mixes and needed cornbread for my stuffing on Thanksgiving.  This did the trick!  Although I increased the sugar to 1/2 cup.  And the sour cream (I used extra light) made it so moise. Perfect!!

This recipe turned out pretty yummy.  Got rave reviews at my house!  I did not have any sour cream so I improvised with some heavy whipping cream that I had.  I also made "faux" buttermilk instead of just plain milk, and I doubled the sugar (used 1/2 cup).

This was a great recipe for cornbread.  It was really moist and easy to make.  I would almost rank it as high as my favorite which is Marie Calendar's Cornbread.  Will make again and I got a lot of requests for the recipe.
