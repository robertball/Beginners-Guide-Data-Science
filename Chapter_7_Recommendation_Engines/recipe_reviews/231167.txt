Tasty dressing. Super easy to make. I would cut back on the sesame oil just a bit next time. The flavor was a little strong.

My husband used to call salad, "poison" being a meat and potato guy. Now, with this dressing, he asks if it is 'salad time' yet every night! Thanks Chris!
I add 1 tsp honey since I use raspberry spread with less sugar.  I know, a little silly.

Reduced sesame oil to 1/2 tsp.  Substituted preserves for 3 tablespoons frozen raspberries plus one envelope stevia sweetener for a sugar free dressing.  Delicious!

great concept. thinking there was a typo in the recipe. 1/2 tsp or tsp of Sesame oil....careful. Too late to change now, so I added 2 more TBSP of Raspberry jam. It did have a nice zip for tang.
