This was very tasty and easy.  The turkey gets nice a brown and has great flavor.  The kids liked it too!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  Our only ingredient changes were to double the garlic and skip toasting the sesame seeds.  We also broiled the turkey in a toaster oven instead of grilling, and it turned out juicy, flavorful, and beautifully browned.  Great recipe considering how easy and fast it is!

Just average.  Tastes like a teriaki sauce.  Won't make again.

This is very good!  I used turkey mignons, with the bacon removed, instead of tenderloins and it still turned out very good.  I think you should double the marinade if you're going to use a thicker piece of meat, though.

A great way to disguise turkey!  Terriyaki Turkey Nuggets is a good way to describe this dish.  The number of servings may be a little generous - you may need to make extras.  I also merinated the turkey pieces for about an hour and a half, flipping half through.
