Lovely texture- I added some garam masala. Needed more salt than I had anticipated.

Had some leftover cauliflower from Thanksgiving and decided to make an easy soup as an appetizer for this cold winter day. I enjoyed the flavor along with the addition of fresh ginger. I served it along side some slices of garlic naan bread- which paired well with the soup. Very easy and healthy soup to make! However, I did cheat a little and added a little bit of heavy cream at the end for a extra creaminess.

The soup came out tastier than expected. I actually made this in a pressure cooker, then put it in the food processor. It came out like the picture. Very creamy and smooth.

Its a very tasty soup, specially considering the minimal ingredients. I served this low fat and low simple carbs soup to a group of friends. All of us really enjoyed it.  I used ground roasted cumin instead of curry powder  and a small quantity of red pepper, and pur√©ed it with an immersion blender. I will be making this again.  Thank you for the recipe!
