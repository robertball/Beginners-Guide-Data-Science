Anything Goes Black Beans Haiku: "This wasn't for us. Beans were lost in other stuff. Guess I'm glad we tried!" We ate Goya's AR recipe for black beans last week so I guess we were spoiled from how fantastic they were, but this particular recipe just didn't make our tastebuds jig. First thing that was "off" was the addition of tomato paste, along w/ the copious amounts of bell pepper and onion that drowned out the beans, which were the main "guts" of this side dish. We had to add more than a dash of Chipotle Tabasco when we served it (at least to my husband and I's plate) and our daughter insisted on melting lots of cheese on top of hers.

Delicious! I liked how these were different from the usual way that I prepare black beans. I kept them thicker, and served them as a side to 'Chipotle Beef Tostadas' from this site. We gobbled these up, and hubby asked to take the leftovers to work tomorrow, which makes these a keeper in my book~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
