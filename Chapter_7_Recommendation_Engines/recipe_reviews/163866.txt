This recipe is very close to what Cuban Picadillo should be, but it was missing a few steps.

I was pleased to see that all the ingredients were included, some people can't see why olives and raisins should co-exist in the same dish... try it, delicious.

What I saw was missing was the beginning step. Picadillo, and practically all Cuban bean dishes are cooked into a "sofrito". A sofrito consists of a can of tomato sauce, an equal amount of water, garlic, onions, salt, and whatever herbs you prefer (typical cuban food uses a lot of oregano and I like to add cumin and a laurel leaf to my picadillo). Simmer the sofrito so that the garlic and onions start to cook and reduce the liquid to about 75%. Then add the beef to brown in the sofrito. Add the olives and raisins in as well so that the flavors incorporate with the rest of the pot. Add everything else in until the picadillo is cooked and the sauce is in the consistency you desire.

Serve with white rice or a side of Frijoles Negros, some Cuban bread, tostones, and a salad... and you'll be a HAPPY CUBAN FOODIE!

being cuban ive eaten picadillo all my life at family get-togethers or restaurants and never, not once, have i had it with cilantro. traditional picadillo does not call for cilantro, so if you want to try picadillo at its utmost authenticity, omit the cilantro. it will be fabulously seasoned with the raisins and olives without the pungent odor or taste of cilantro.

I have been looking for a good picadillo recipe since I grew up in Miami and this type of cuisine is common. I love the sweet/salty flavors of the raisins (I used golden raisins, as I've never seen it served with black raisins in Miami) and olives. I'm not a big olive fan per say, but the flavors meld nicely that you don't go, "hey, this has olives, eww.." :) Almost all of the ingredients are there but I switched up the order. I started with the traditional Sofrito before I even cooked the beef. (Saute onions, garlic in olive oil until clear, then add cumin, oregano, red pepper, two 8 oz cans of Goya tomato sauce and red and green bell peppers then letting liquid reduce/thicken) To this I added the remainder of the ingredients and then let the liquid cook down into the ground beef. Don't worry if it seems like you're not actually "browning" the ground beef with all the liquid present as the sauce eventually evaporates and makes the beef very flavorful. I served this with white rice and tradionally seasoned black beans.

Made this twice..this is what Ive learned. Instead of tomato sauce...Sofrioto (similar to tom sauce but has lots of herbs blended that really add to flavor) it is made by Goya can be found in the ethnic food isle (WalMart). The first time I made this I used Sofrito but the 2nd time I used tomato paste...big difference in taste. I invited my Cuban grandmother over for dinner and she said "Its good...but you need to use Sofrito and wheres the capers and bay leaf?" She uses bayleave in everything and she is a 90yr old Cuban who can cook her tail off. Next time...I will follow diections but modify it a bit using only Sofrito, 1/2 the raisins, 2oz capers and don't forget grandmas bay leaf! TIP: this tatses great but its the best 2-3 days after its made when the olives seem to really add even more flavor. I LUV IT!

I absolutely loved this recipe. I have been cooking Cuban and Mexican food for the past few years now. This is my first attempt at Picadillo. I did make the recipe in a smaller amount (for 2) but there was still enough for leftovers! I did improvise and modify a few ingredients, however. I omitted the cilantro, as no Picadillo recipe I have ever had has had Cilantro in it. It's got a strong flavor when used in a big amount like this recipe calls for. First things first, though, I made some homemade Sofrito as per reccomendation of some other reviews. It really made the meat flavorful for sure. Also, make sure to cook/brown the meat IN the Sofrito, as it adds so much flavor. If you get extra lean ground beef, you don't have to worry about fat or grease. And I added capers, about 2 tbsp worth for a meal for 2. I also used 3/4 of the raisins it called for, as well as the olives. I rinsed the olives before adding to get rid of excess salt. I seasoned my meat with Oregano and Cumin before adding to the Sofrito. I let it sit and kind of marinate in the herbs before cooking. I also let the whole mixture marry in the pan for about an hour, to get the extra flavor out of all the vegetables. Most importantly, I added 2 bay leaves. I think this made a huge difference. I let the Sofrito cook down a bit and reduce before adding the meat, also. It came out perfect with all of the modifications I made! Give it a try and I'm sure your family will absolutely love it. I let my kids try it - A+

I've made this twice now.  The first time, I used store bought safrito.  The second time, I made my own, using the same spices on the sofrito ingredients list. Tomato paste, onion, coriander, onion powder, paprika, garlic powder, oregano, pepper. The first time, I didn't like the occasional big bites of sweet raisins so the next time, I added very few.  Then I found myself missing the sweet.  Next time, I'll add a few more raisins (but still not as much as the recipe calls for) but chop them finely.  First time I served it in warm corn tortillas.  Liked that.  Second time with coconut rice.  It was great both ways but the flavors over power the coconut flavor.  I think using the coconut milk is a waste of fat and calories for this reason.  Good recipe.  We love green olives around here!

What a delightful dish! Ok, I did make some changes after reading the reviews. I made half a recipe. I sauted the onions and garlic, then made the sofrito by adding to pot 16 oz. of tomato sauce, an equal amount of water, the chopped sweet red pepper, 1 tsp. oregano, 1 tsp. cumin, 1 tsp. coriander, 3/4 cup raisins, 1-5oz. jar of green olives sliced in half, a half jar of the olive brine, 1/8 tsp. hot pepper sauce, 1/8  tsp. red pepper flakes. I brought this to a boil, added the uncooked ground beef and let it all cook down. It tastes fantastic! The hot sauce and red pepper flakes did not make it hot, just mellow. I am serving it over brown rice. I was going to make coconut rice as another reviewer did, but decided the raisins made it sweet enough. I have not had much Cuban food in my lifetime and this is a real treat! Thanks to the other reviewers for their good comments, and thanks for the recipe!

My kids and I really liked this recipe.  I used stir fry beef instead of hamburger, chopping it up after it was browned like they do at Baja Fresh and other taco places.  I served it with coconut rice - very good combination.  To make coconut rice, cook 1/4 onion or 1/2 shallot in 1T butter til tender, add 1 cup jasmine rice, 3/4 cup coconut milk and 1 c water, bring to a boil, cover and  simmer for 18 minutes.  Stir in a dash of nutmeg if you like and serve either beside or under the picadillo.

We had a Cuban themed housewarming party, and I made this and used it as a stuffing for mushrooms.  All of the guest raved about the flavor combination.  I did use golden raisins instead of plain raisins and cut down some on the green olives.

Well, I would not add cilantro - maybe they are trying to make a different version of Picadillo - but cilantro is not really a Cuban herb.  My best friend is Cuban and her Mom gave me a recipe straight from Cuba and they use Cumin and Oregano.  She also told me to add Potatoes.

As a Cuban American, I can attest that this is one of the most common and tastiest dishes we have.  For your edification, the are two additional variants on this dish that are available in Miami's Cuban restaurants.  The first is called, 'Picadillo al Caballo,' which literally means Picadillo on a horse.  This variant adds very small, cubed, fried potatoes on topd of the picadillo, which is itself on top of the white rice.  The second variant is called, 'Picadillo al Caballo con un sombrero,' which again literally means Picadillo on a horse with a hat on.  This variant is the same as the previous one except that it is topped off with a fried egg on the very top.  Enjoy!

My husband, 18-yr-old daughter and I just loved this. We incorporated a lot of the suggestions: added 1/4c rinsed capers, used 1c golden raisins, one 6oz can of tomato paste AND 3 tomatoes chopped; 1/3 c fresh cilantro; used only 1c sliced green olives.  We served it with the Coconut Jasmine Rice another poster suggested (Yummy, A++ on that rice!). Recipe makes enough for 2nds tonight and lunches tomorrow. Thanks for sharing this excellent recipe.

I have been trying new international dishes for my family... I tweaked this recipe like others and it was a hit. I made the "sofrito" as others commented first and left out the cilantro... also, I halved the entire recipe. Halving this recipe still made way more than enough for 4 adults and we had leftovers. I also let this simmer for about an hour in order to let the flavors marry... used less olives (about 6 ounces) and golden raisins.

My Cuban abuela gave this a 98/100 for accuracy. She suggested I drain the meat better because she didn't like seeing any extra grease in it.

I did NOT use cilantro because I've never seen it used in picadillo either. I only had green peppers and the purple raisins, but the recipe was still very good. I did make a softrito, but abuela said not to bother next time and that it would cut down on the grease too. I'm excited about using this picadillo in papas rellenas and empanadas! 

I served it with black beans and rice. It was wonderful!!!

This was wonderful and I enjoyed it for lunch for several days. I took some suggestions: I bought a jar of Sofrito to cook with the ground beef. I had no idea how much to add, but since I had 3 lbs. of beef I added the entire jar. I left out the tomato paste. I'd like to make my own Sofrito - it tasted a lot like pizza sauce which means I can make something even better. I rinsed the olives to remove some of the salt. I used the full amount of raisins and olives - don't omit either. We ate it over white rice with mixture of black beans and Rotel (with a little cumin added). My teenaged son wasn't crazy about it, but he's just now learning to deal with different flavors. Husband loved it! It's in my Top 10!

Have been making Picadillo since 1959 when I brought the recipe back from Havana. We could visit Cuba then. I followed other reviewers tweeks and started with a sofrito. The meat melted in it and took up flavors. I did miss the allspice I've always used. Anyone else use alspice in this? Great recipe. We all loved this.

Great base recipe and halved recipe because only cooking for 2.  Modifications I made were using all red bell pepper, 8 oz black olives, 8 oz tomato sauce + 2 cups water and decreased raisins to 1/4 cup.  Also added 2 small potatoes (diced) and about 1 tbsp of capers.  Delicious with black beans and rice!

I had Picadillo at a Cuban restaurant in New Jersey several years ago and found this recipe to recreate the dish. The dish I tasted also had cubed potatoes in it so you can add them if you wish. My husband was hesitant about olives and raisins going together at first, but I've converted him. Now he has cravings for this! I followed the suggestion of another reviewer to make sofrito first before cooking the ground beef. I modified the recipe a bit by dumping leftover olive juice from a jar of olives (without chopping) to enhance the olive flavor, ditching the cilantro, and adding cumin, chili powder, and a bit of cinnamon powder (my secret ingredient) to it.

This recipe varies like spaghetti sauce. A bunch of different ingredients, but the overall recipe is correct. I come from a Cuban family background. My grandmother's recipe calls for capers, cilantro, cumin, coriander, and how's this for an odd ingredient, ketchup. The thing is my grandmothers recipe is amazing, but she doesn't really measure anything. And of course when I make it, it doesn't taste like hers. Gives me a reason to visit her more often though, and then take a peek over her shoulder while she's putting a pinch of this and a pinch of that.

I've never even had Cuban food, but wanted to make something for a friend who grew up in Miami and misses it.  I have to admit I was nervous about tasting it after looking at the ingredients...but it's good!  I followed one person's advice and left out the cilantro to make it more authentic (used it today to make cilantro pesto).  This a unique, surprising dish; several of my (very white American) friends have tried it and liked it as well.

I would not add raisins.  I only like empanada fillings with raisins in the picadillo.  My mother used to add some of the olive brine into her recipe.  She also never precooked the beef she added all ingredients into the pot and let it cook.  and yes the olives taste great in it.  She used the ones with the pimento inside.  Also the pronunciation of the double L has a Y sound so you would pronounce it Picadiyo in English.

This was good. I made some changes after reading about 'true' Cuban Picadillo. The recipe I made was a lot different than the one listed, unfortunately. This recipe is a good starting point.

I am also Cuban, we do not use cilantro in our cooking. Other than that, the recipe seems very authentic. I also saute the onions and peppers before browning the meat.

This recipe was good but authentic Picadillo Criollo always has capers, bay leaves, oregano and dry white wine in addition to the items in this recipe. Another variation adds cubed fried potatoes cook in with the picadillo. Both versions are delicious.  But your recipe was simple and good. Just some tips from a Cuban cook who makes Picadillo Criollo one a week by family request!

Left out the cilantro, added in two bays leaves, and started with a Sofrito base--came out wonderfully!  Tasted very much like the Picadillo I get in Little Havana!  As others have said, was even better the second day.

I loved this recipe and so sis my family and friends even my friends that hate olives loved it olives and all. Very easy to make and oh so good. I did take some advice from members and used the goya sofrioto sauce and put in the bay leaf and rinsed the olives. We had it for two meals. I can't wait to have this again and my friends want more when I make it again.

This recipe is easy and really good. It's different than the usual fare but simple to put together. I made it using the "sofrito" sauce made ahead of time. Only problem was the sauce needs to be on really low and stirred often to prevent the tomato scorching on the bottom. Had to salvage it by quickly pouring it into another skillet leaving the burned part behind. It really does need all those raisins and olives. Don't skimp!

Much better with the cilantro. I cooked everthing and was finished. I forgot to buy cilantro. It tasted like something was missing. I quickly went to the store and bought the already chopped cilantro and mixed it in the food. Boy, what a difference!   Even the picky daughter loved it!

My Cuban husband says too many olives for the amount of meat. So I cut those in half. Also usually increase the amount of meat and water (for more sauce) and omit cilantro. Sometimes throw in fresh chopped tomatoes. After you've made it a few times, you can just throw guess. And just like chili, it's better to make the day before!

Family loves this with these changes:  add:  about a tbsp. of capers, a cup of pine nuts, salt and coarsely ground pepper, cumin, a couple of bay leaves, and about 3 cups of diced yukon potatoes sauteed in chopped onions.  Omit:  cilantro.  Serve over rice, with a nice caesar salad on the side. BOMB comfort food!

I know some people hate when people change the recipe and then rate it but I'm doing it anyway. I think the recipe would have been good as written but perhaps less tasty. I sautéed some onions then browned the meat with a little salt  then added 1 jar sofrito and some chopped roasted red peppers.  Sprinkled some garlic powder and red pepper flakes for a touch of heat., added some chopped green olives, half a can of peas and handful of raisins. Cooked it for about 15 minutes and served over white rice. Delicious and 5 stars.

I followed the notes of other reviewers and added bay leaf, 1 T caper, a teaspoon of oregano, some sherry, extra can tomato paste.  I substituted chicken broth instead of water.

My husband, raised on Cuban food, said it was very accurate to the cuisine!

With modifications, this was a simple and flavorful dish! First off, we omitted the raisins and cilantro. Secondly, it REALLY needs some salt/pepper, so season to taste! The core of the recipe is great, we will be making this again in the future.

I loved your take on Piccadillo. I use chopped potatoes in mine. My mother also recommended I try a pinch of chopped cilantro and I did and it added wonderful flavor. Cuban Piccadillo has many different ways of making it and even though she was born and raised in Cuba she found that the cilantro added a new twist to a classic dish. Thanks again

This is wonderful!  I cut it down to serve two people.  I used one pound of ground beef, one onion, one green pepper, 2 garlic cloves, 3/4 c raisins, 8 oz olives, 1/2 can tomato paste and 1/2 c or more of water.  I add cilantro at the end since I love the taste.  This is a great dish.

This dish turned out fabulous even my husband loved it. I cut the serving in half since it's just me and my husband.  This was still enough for leftovers for us the following day.  I took the advice of another reviewer and sauteed the onions and garlic in olive oil.  Then added the bell pepper, tomato sauce, 1 bay leaf, 1/2 tsp of cumin and 1/2 tsp of oregano.  I let it simmer for a bit until liquid reduces a little bit.  Then I added a pinch of salt, ground beef, 3/4 raisins, and chopped olives.  The ground beef absorbed the flavors.  Yum Yum Yum.

My "suegra" (mother in law) always makes this for me!!! But She serves it over "papas pudding" aka mash potatoes. Of coarse she does it with the sofriato as described previously, however I think I prefer this method bc I can drain the fat. I did not use the raisin or the cilantro bc that is not what I am used to. I did add cumin to meat as it cooked which makes it taste more Cuban to me. Good recipe! Whole family loved it even though not as good as my suegra (no one can compare with her she is the best Cuban cook and still lives in Cuba). Was nice to be able to get close to something that reminds me if her!

I've made this twice now.  My family doesn't like beef, so I substitute boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I added cumin and cayenne, salt, pepper, and paprika.  Finally, I drained the olive jar into the pot as it seemed a more flavorful option than water.

I made this recipe for just my husband I so I halved the recipe.  Instead of 8 oz of olives, I used a 5 oz jar and I thought it was plenty.  We liked it served with Goya black beans and rice with fried plantains on the side.

OMGosh!!!! I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical when I found this recipe. Putting raisins and green olives together with ground beef??  I am SOOOO glad I tried this though.  It was fantastic!!  I followed some reviewers advice and made sofrito and browned the ground beef in that.  Then I poured it into my slow cooker and added all the other ingredients.  I also added black beans.  I omitted the cilantro and added sazon seasoning.  I served it over white rice.  DELICIOUS!!

This is good! I don't like ground beef- being kind of a beef snob, so I browned cubed filet. It had to cook longer for the meat to be really tender but the texture was more what I associate with the kind of picadillo i've always eaten. I agree that the cilantro is not traditional but it's a nice idea for something different. Also starting without a sofrito is not traditional but overall the taste isn't that different. I liked this- thanks for sharing!

To be honest I was a tad leary of this recipe. It has so many weird combinations of opposites like raisins and green olives, but I gave it a try and really loved it. This is so tasty.I will make this again.

A really interesting flavor - don't omit the raisins.  Great for converting to vegetarian (with fake meat).  I didn't find it saucy enough for the rice (probably b/c no hamburger fat).
