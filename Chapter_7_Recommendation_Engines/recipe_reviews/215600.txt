Good! There is certainly no reason to dirty as many pans as the instructions tell you to. I sauteed the ground beef with garlic/red pepper (skipped the onion), drained and set aside. Added the chopped eggplant and some chopped mushrooms to the same pan and sauteed in a little olive oil. Then mixed it all together along with the egg, cheese, Panko, herbs, etc. Loved the Panko on top. I think I'll make this again with Italian sausage sometime. Thanks :)

AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!!!! I made a few changes to this recipe just to keep it extra healthy. I used ground turkey in place of the beef, I used fine oat bran, instead of panko, egg white instead of the egg with the yolk, and I used Veggie Italian cheese blend over the top and Veggie sprinkled parm cheese. It was so good, My husband absolutely loved it! He wants to try this same recipe in a Portabella mushroom next time.

Honestly, the house smelled DIVINE while making this recipe. I had really big hopes, but was severely disappointed. The Hubbs liked it but didn't give his normal rave reviews over one of my meals. For me, the texture was the deal-breaker. I absolutely LOATHE "mushy" and this - though cooked completely as directed with no variatioin - was way too mushy. Then again, I'm the person who won't eat the stuffing from within the Thanksgiving turkey, because I don't like the soft texture. The flavor was great, the house smelled great, the eggplant "shell" was delicious. If I could have cooked the filling separately and/or had it set up more firmly, I'd have loved it. As it is, I definitely will NOT be making this recipe again.

I used ground turkey and added some chopped mushroom to the stuffing, and also used blue cheese in the stuffing as well. It was absolutely delicious! I've never liked eggplant but I'm glad I gave it another try.

Enjoyed this recipe alot ! Substituted romano cheese with parm. Also added a little shredded cheddar to the top over the last 10 mins of baking time. Will make this again for sure, but may add a little less bread crumbs next time !

I just finished my meal, and it was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe as is, I only left out the basil and parsley because I didn't have any. It is definitely a keeper!

Used lean ground turkey instead of beef, 1/4 cup dry quinoa (cooked before adding to mix) instead of breadcrumbs or panko, and only 1/2 cup parm cheese in the mix and 1/2 cup parm cheese on top of the tomato sauce I poured on top. I nixed the chopped tomatoes.  I also didn't use bell peppers, and I used dry minced onions (about 1/4 cup) instead of fresh. The basil was dried, not fresh. Mixed all of the ingredients together and ONLY topped with 1 can tomato sauce and the cheese. I drained the turkey and the sauteed onion/garlic mix before adding it to avoid too much moisture. It's a low cal dinner and very yummy. Next time I'll add a 2nd egg to bind it better.

Made this tonight and it was great.  Again, I didn't have the right cheese but per other review, used 1/2 parm and half mozzarella. Also, since we're gluten free do to Celiac disease in our house, we used gluten free bread crumbs.   To cut baking time, I microwaved the empty shells for 4 min on high and then baked for 30.  I would will wait and put cheese on top about 10 min before finished baking next time, there will be a next time too!

This was wonderful!  Just left out the pepper and used mozzarella/Parmesan mix so I wouldn't have to go to the store.

It was a very delicious recipes, however since I am a vegetarian I substituted mushrooms for the beef.  It still tasted delicious but the prep time was a little bit long for me.

I made it last night for diner. It was AMAZING! Not only does it have a lot of fresh vegetables and herbs but some protein which made my husband very happy.  The only thing I did not add was tomatoes since he is allergic, but other than that, it was truly delicious!!

This was delicious! I used spinach instead of the bell pepper since I didn't have any in the house and it came out awesome! I will definitely  be making this again.

Good and easy way to use up extra summer vegetables. Even my very picky husband likes it. I’ve added this recipe to my regular rotation.

I will definitely make this again.  The only thing I did different is that I cooked the meat along with the onions, peppers and garlic (why mess up another skillet!)   It was quite tasty.

Excellent recipe! Light yet very satisfying. Definitely a keeper. 
Made some changes just because I was short with the ingredients. Used green pepper instead of red, used crushed corn flakes (with garlic powder/parsley/adobo). Smells and tastes yummmy!

I made this recipe tonight, and it smelled and tasted delicious! Whenever I see a recipe calling for so many fresh ingredients (fresh basil, parsley, tomatoes, onions, peppers, etc.), I have high hopes for the actual taste of said recipe. This dish did not disappoint. My husband and I both loved it. This will be a definite do-over at my house!

I made this but did substitute the ground beef for hot turkey Italian sausage and omitted the basil.  Yummy!  We loved it.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Definitely a keeper.
