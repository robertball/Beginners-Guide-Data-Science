The family liked it. Everyone said it was diffrent. I will be making it again. I used some amish egg noddles when I made it and I mixed every thing together rather than puting it in layers. EXCELLENT DISH.

Very good. I neglected to had the sugar and cinnamon. Also instead of layers I just mixed it all together. I added about 3/4 cup of water to the dish before I put it in the oven, covered with foil to prevent the noodles from drying out. Stir at about 20 min and then cook another 15 to 20 min.  Kids and wife loved it. When I make it again I will add more apples.

Really enjoyed the meal, everyone said very tasty and hubby had 2nds.  Next time I make it I will add a few more apples and add a little water to help the noodles not dry out.  Overall very good and will make it again

In a word..... fantastic! My husband said afterwards, "I don't think you get just how much I loved this." Wow, for him, that's deep praise. Looking forward to leftovers tonight. Only revisions were using apple sausage instead of italian and switching out the 3/4 C white sugar using 1/2 C brown sugar instead. Also, didn't layer, just mixed it all in. Too, too tasty!
