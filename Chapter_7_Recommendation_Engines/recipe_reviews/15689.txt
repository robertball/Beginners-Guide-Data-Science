This was pretty decent and easy to make.  A little heavy on the cumin (and I like spicy), and not very filling.  I thought they were a bit better heated.  I have to say I don't understand the concept of the wax paper - this does *not* make them fun to eat, and in fact, just makes a big mess trying to peel back the paper and keeping all those fillings intact.  I just rolled them up with no paper and ate them from the end like any wrap.

I shredded the roast beef. Also I put sour cream and salsa on the filling. It tasted much better.
