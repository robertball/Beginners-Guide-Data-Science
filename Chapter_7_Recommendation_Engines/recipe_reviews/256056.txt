The tilapia came out perfect, the cook times were right on.  Watch the steps closely since there are a number of ingredients that are divided.  The kale, white bean and tomato "stew" was very tasty and I loved the light crunch the kale still had in it.  We also made a side of rice, but that was completely unnecessary.   This meal is delicious and filling!

I followed the cooking directions the Tilapia came out great. I  made these changes -added two carrots, one chopped onion (vs 3/4 c.), used spinach vs kale. Even after draining the beans, spinach and tomatoes, the dish is kind of bland so I added lots of spices: Ms Dash, red pepper, California spice blend, and ancho chili pepper. I will make this again it is a great way to get in a lot of vegetables.
