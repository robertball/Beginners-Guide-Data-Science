This is a great base recipe and I say so because it's versatile. I added a few things and less of others!!!! I added some turkey trimmings and bell seasoning, I used chicken stock since I don't have turkey stock on hand!!! I omitted the water and added more turkey drippings and added more flour as I needed more gravy for my recipe!!!! Thanks SassyCassyMommy!!!!

This was my first even attempt at making gravy and it turned out wonderfully! I didn't have celery salt so I used celery seed instead and I used chicken stock instead of turkey stock.

I am using this recipe again this Thanksgiving and realized I haven't raved about it! My bad!
I make this exactly as it says. I use the drippings inside the turkey and add a little water as "stalk" because it's Thanksgiving....the only day eating such horrendously fattening delight is socially acceptable and by god it comes out amazing! Use this recipe and then ruuuuun like Forrest because a moment on the lips is a lifetime on the hips people ;)
::please forgive the random ramble. I'm taking a break from baking and I don't want to go back::

Very Yummy! I used chicken stock, as well, because it was what I had on hand. This will be my go-to gravy recipe for turkey gravy next year.

This recipe is 5 stars because it's EASY and DELICIOUS!!! We roasted our turkey with onion and celery chunks underneath, so it was in the turkey stock. I buzzed up the onion and celery chunks before adding them to the saucepan. I followed the recipe except for adding the water and the celery salt (didn't have it ).   I've been eating gravy other people have made for Thanksgiving and Christmas for as long as I can remember. This was my first attempt and it was just good if not better than the others.

I'm rating my modification as 5 stars.  This is what I did.  Instead of turkey stock I used 2 cans of vegetable broth (~15 oz).  We didn't use any water, salt, pepper, or celery salt.

Pretty good.  I used mostly the drippings from the turkey and a little bit of stock.  I think the amount of gravy doesn't make enough for 20 and I needed to use lots of corn starch to get it to thicken it up.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious and easy.  I made exactly as written, except that I used Campbell's low sodium chicken stock instead of turkey stock and didn't add any water.  I might try to make it slightly thicker next time by adding a bit less stock.

Despite the fact that I have not yet tried this recipe, I rate it as 5 stars because of the order in which the ingredients are added and cooked.  Making the roux from the fat drippings and an equal amount of flour uses all the flavor the turkey fat has to offer while including the flavor of the browned flour.  Then by scraping up the fond from the turkey roasting pan with the stock and adding that liquid, you bump the turkey flavor up to the maximum possible.  Then continuing to add more stock or water while stirring/cooking on the stovetop will allow you to control just the right amount of thickening that is needed.  If you end up making too much gravy,  just freeze the excess.

I found that you really need to follow these directions and make sure the Roux gets really golden.  Everything is spot on.  Made a great gravt, but I did add more flour to thicken it up more.

I followed the directions with double batch and it turned out too watery to use and I didn't even add any water.

This recipe is fool-proof. Be sure to whisk the flour into the drippings for a full 5 minutes until it browns. I didnâ€™t add salt since I already basted my turkey with salted butter. Sooo good!

This is wonderful!  I did leave out the celery salt because I used herbs to baste my turkey and didn't want to compete.  I am replacing my go-to gravy recipe with this one and won't ever look back.

I like this recipe as it is a more traditional gravy, using the turkey drippings and flour. I didn't change anything. Very good taste, very good consistency.

I did like the convenience of the recipe. I think it was because I only had the chicken stock that I didn't like it as much as I think other people did. Also because we use a reduced sodium version, that might have also been an issue. I did add sage and some additional turkey drippings which did kick it up a notch! All in all it is a great for Thanksgiving and gravy recipe.

Very easy and delish!  I only used 3 cups of broth as I like my gravy more creamy... next time I'll add more flour to the drippings so I can add more broth to increase the overall amount.

The easiest gravy I have ever made.  Turned out just like the picture and everyone said how good it was on Thanksgiving day.  I made extra for the leftovers and it was the first to go!

Only giving this recipe 3 stars because although the gravy tasted delicious, it never thickened up for me. I won't be making this again.
