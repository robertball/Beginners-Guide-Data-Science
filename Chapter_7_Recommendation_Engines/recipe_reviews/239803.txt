This was delicious but I had to change up a few things.  Instead of 2 TBSP coconut flour, it ended up being more like 1/4 cup coconut flour.  I changed it because the recipe said that the dough would ball up and that at some point I could split it.  My dough was more on the loose side and I could not ball it up.  So I kept adding a little more coconut flour until I was able to create a ball of dough, although it was still somewhat looser and sticky.   

I also was not able to put it in a 12x8 baking dish. I used a round glass baking dish.   

I used strawberry preserves instead of raspberry jam.

It ended up being a hit at the get together I brought it to and was asked for the recipe.
