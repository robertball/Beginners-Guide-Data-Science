This recipe is super moist and has great banana taste.  To add more flavor to all my banana bread recipes, I add 1-2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice with the dry ingredients.  As a great topping I also mix up 1/4 c. oatmeal, 1/4 c. soft butter, 1 tsp. cinn. and 1/4 c. brown sugar and crumble on top of the recipe before cooking.  The topping adds an extra touch and always gets a compliment.  Like the other comment, I only use this recipe in loaf pans.

This is the best banana bread I have ever had. I made it and took it to work everyone wanted the recipe.  Freezes really well too, though you probably won't have any left to freeze!

This is the ultimate banana bread recipe! I make it for all different groups of people and everyone loves it! I modify the recipe slightly, though, by using 2 loaf pans instead of a 9x13. Temperature and cook time stay the same. My favorite part about this recipe? It always comes out perfect!

Perfectly moist wonderful bread have made 4 batches since Thanksgiving! I do add 1 teaspoon nutmeg 1 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves as well as a cup or two of chopped pecans and bake in bundt pan for an hour.  I added  the different spices for fall. Also I did not have any buttermilk so used regular whole milk in place..this is the best snack and all that have tasted the souped up recipe rave about.  Recently made as directed still no buttermilk and deliciously moist. Thanks a keeper for sure!

This bread is AWESOME!! My kids (7 & 3) made this yesterday. Used the 9 x 13 pan as suggested and 1/2 of it gone already! I only made 1/2 the batter and did not have buttermilk but substituted 1cup milk and 1tbs vinegar (stirred and let sit for 10min) then used what was needed for the recipe. So moist and full of banana flavor!! This is a keeper!! Thanks

great way to use up black bananas and buttermilk.  Subbed the oleo for 3/4 cup applesauce and it was super moist.  Did up the salt to 1/2 tsp. and cut the sugar down to 2 1/2 cups and it was plenty sweet.  Added 1 tsp. cinnamon to enhance the flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe that can be made into a lowfat bread without compromise of flavor or texture!  This made 2 loaves and 2 mini loaves.

This makes wonderfully moist, flavorful, bread! My family loves it so much that they will let the bananas go brown just so I have to make it. It does make alot, 2 loaves and 2 mini loaves. If i don't have buttermilk I just add 1 tsp of vinager to the milk. I also cut the sugar down to 2.5 cups. Everyone is always asking for this recipe! Thanks!

I've made this one many times and it always turns out great.  It's the best tasting recipe for banana bread!!  I've also had to substitute regular milk for the buttermilk since I don't always have it on hand.

I only used 2 1/2 c. sugar and four large bananas, as it was the right consistancy after four bananas. I also added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg. Smells wonderful. This made three medium sized loaves, for me. Quite a large batch of banana bread. I also covered my breads halfway through with foil to prevent scorching.

I lost my grandmother's recipe, this one is the closest yet! She would add various different dried fruits, chips, nuts and then send me around the neighborhood to give loaves of 'Fruit Cake' door-to-door as Christmas gifts. I have enjoyed adding chocolate chips, coconut and pecans the most, but dried blueberries or cranberries with white chips are also excellent. If I have oats and dried pineapple when I make this, they might end up in the batter-the variations are endless!

Buttered the pan and coated it with cinnamon sugar for a nice crust. Added a little cinnamon and nutmeg for our taste and it worked well. The recipe made enough for a shallow 9x13 AND a loaf pan! Definitely a sweet version and so delicious!

I subbed 1 cup of whey (from my son's cheese making science experiment) instead of buttermilk and did not notice any difference.  Moist, flavourful.  I did not bake it in a 9 x 13, using 2 bread pans instead, and it did ooze over into my oven.  Will know to use larger bread pans or the 9 x 13.

This is great!  I needed a recipe that would use both bananas and buttermilk, and this one was perfect.  I, too, cut the sugar down to 2 1/2 cups.  I baked it in the 9x13 pan as instructed, but it took 80 minutes (after 60 minutes I covered it loosely with foil) to cook through in the center.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! I found it when I spent a summer as a nanny. The kids loved it! Now I bake it at least once a month. It is a rave with all the friends and coworkers.  Also, the recipe is wonderful with a cup of walnuts and a cup of chocolate pieces to make the perfect Banana Chocolate chip Nut Bread. MMMM YUM! I am going to try the crumble top next time. This sounds like a great addition. Thanks for the idea.

What a DELICIOUS banana bread! First off, this recipe is gi-normous!  It made 6 min-loaves & 30 cupcakes! And OMG what a wonderful crispy crust, especially on the mini loves! Lovely nongreasy crumb which held that toasted walnuts I added perfectly. Used Smart Balance for the margarine & will keep using it - worked great. This one is a real keeper folks - get that bunch of reduced bananas or start saving them one at a time in the freezer for this recipe. Will be using these cupcakes for Halloween decorating - if I can get them to last that long. Out of the oven

Oh my goodness... This Banana Bread is just divine!!! I was looking for a super moist and this recipe does not disappoint. DON'T cook this in two bread pans.The temp/time is perfect for cake pan. A loaf pan is way to thick for above temp/time. you would need to cook longer at a lower temp. (don't ask how I know... a "FRIEND" told me. It over flowed.. batter dripping and burning with smoke... A real "DRRR" moment... um, so I was told of course." GOOD LUCK, VERY YUMMY!!

So delicious!  Moist and sweet!  Just like I like it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  This was my first time making banana bread and I will not be trying any other recipes!  The only thing I will do differently is to add nuts when I add the bananas.  Yum!

This banana bread is fantastic! Super moist and great flavor. I've added cinnamon, which tasted great too! I bake as muffins (for 20-23 minutes) and/or in loaf pans. This one's a keeper!!

Look no further... this is the best recipe. I use butter instead of margarine and whole wheat flour instead of white. Add chocolate chips for a fabulous dessert. I make it all the time and give it to friends, teachers, bring it to brunches, etc. I am constantly asked to bring "my" banana bread. Bake it in stoneware for the best results. I use 2-3 bread pans or mini loaf pans.

Prob. The best banana bread I've had. Very moist. I ended up using regular 1% milk because I didnt have buttermilk and I reduced the recipe to half. I also did not have the right pan, so I made muffins instead. The muffins only took aprox. 20 mins in the oven and turned out SOO GOOD. Thanks for the recipe!!

I like the buttermilk, but way too much sugar. Tastes like sugar bread. But like it says if you like a sweet bread this one's for you. Me personally I like my banana bread to taste like bananas.

very good recipe, i made 4 loaves in two days.
anyone who tasted it loved it, although the second batch i decreased the sugar to two cups as too much sugar for my taste, and better for the grandchildren too.

This is a 5 star banana bread.  My family loved it.  The last 15 minutes it was cooking family members kept coming to the kitchen to see if it was done yet.  Once it was out of the oven the aroma over took us and it was cut while it was still hot.  This bread was absolutely delicious and habit forming.

This is the best Banana Bread I've ever made.  I've been using this recipe for a couple of years now and love it.  With this recipe I can get 3 loafs and a couple of muffins made in one setting.  I usually end up making 3 batches all together and freeze some for Thanksgiving and other occasions and also bring into work.  My son doesn't like nuts, so some of the loafs I make with no nuts

This was fabulous as is! Mine cooked longer than 60 minutes in a 9X13 - probably closer to 75 minutes. This will be my new go-to banana bread recipe. Next time, I'm going to try using 2 cups sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.

Vey nice bread! Loved the additon of buttermilk. Also, had six brown bannanas to use up so this was perfect. This made 2 loaves, we ate one and gave one to the in-laws. Thanks for the post!

I only put 2 1/2 cups of sugar in because as i was adding it i thought 3 was alot.  I also used 7 bananas and 1 cup of 2% milk as thats what i had.  And also i added about a tsp of cinnamon.  I was really worried as it was cooking because almost an hour after i put it in the outside was nice and brown but the inside was completely raw(looked like i just put it in)  I thought for sure it was ruined!  It ended up taking an hour and a half but man is it worth it!  Tender, moist, sweet( but not sickly so) and the top got nicely crisp.  I still have one more loaf to make(i put it in 2 loaf pans) and the first is almost gone already!

This is the BEST banana bread I've eaten. Very moist with a lot of banana flavor! I added a little extra vanilla and 1-2 additional bananas. I didn't mash the bananas completely. I left some large banana chunks. I cooked it in a larger glass pan for about 70 minutes. My kids devoured it.

Thus recipe is wonderful. The only change I made was to cute down on the sugar. It rises beautifully even in high altitude! It reminds me so much of the banana cake my grandma use to make!!  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious!  It is certainly more like a cake than a bread but a wonderful treat with great banana flavour.  It is a bit sweet and next time I would reduce the sugar a bit like some other people mentioned.

It took approx. 75-80 minutes to cook in 9X13 pan. Definitely sweet and moist, but not the spiced banana bread that I'm use to. Still really good though.

Wonderful recipe. I added finally chopped dates (1 cup) and 1 cup chopped walnuts. I used another reviewer's recommendation on the topping of oatmeal, cinnamon, brown sugar, and butter and it is superb. Only problem was that my batter overflowed the two loaf pans.

Great recipe!  However, I changed things to make it a bit healthier.  I used 1 cup of brown sugar & 1.5 cups of Splenda.  I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour & 1.5 cups of AP flour.  Instead if 1 cup of butter, I figured 2 bananas were about the same consistency of 2 sticks of softened butter - 1.5 tsp vanilla and fat free buttermilk.  I stirred in (gently) the dry ingredients alternately with the buttermilk.  I usually use eggbeaters but I was out.  I added the 6 bananas (total of 8).  I made it in a bundt pan & had enough left over for a mini loaf pan.  AWESOME!!  I will be making this regularly!

This is a very good banana bread recipe. I added a topping of brown sugar, butter and oatmeal as someone suggested and it was a great addition to the already delicious bread. Other than that, I made it exactly as the recipe stated. I ended up having to bake it a little longer than the recipe stated, but no big deal. There is often some variation in oven temperatures.

Very Good! I'm always trying new banana bread recipes, looking for that "perfect" loaf.  This sure came close!  One just has to forget how much sugar went in to it :P  My son loved it and was quite upset when I ate the last slice :) Thanks for the recipe.

Perfect bread.....not too dense, not too cake like. Great flavor & texture. I make B Bread ALL THE TIME and this will be my new staple. 
As always, the darker the banana, the better the bread:)

This is the best and moistest recipe I've come across.  Because I don't keep buttermilk on hand, I substituted whole milk instead.  My family scarfs this down as fast as I can make it!

I used milk with vinegar,  used 3 bread loaf pans, other than that followed the recipe. This recipe is competition quality, makes me want to bake again for our state fair contest. Best. Banana. Bread. EVER. Really moist and VERY flavorful.

I made this banana bread as written and it was EXCELLENT and I make banana bread on a regular basis. I had left over buttermilk so I thought I’d give this recipe a try and I’m so glad I did. The only thing I’ll do differently next time is probably put the batter into loaf pans.

This is the best banana bread recipe I’ve ever had. Since it makes two loaves and two small mini ones I separated the batter and added walnuts to one and chocolate chips to the other.  Can’t get enough. I also did not have buttermilk and just used regular milk did not affect the recipe at all. Will be my go to bread from now on.

If I would make any changes to this recipe or any other recipes, I don't think it's appropriate for me to give my opinion.  In my opinion, all recipes should be tried as posted!   I only gave this recipe two stars, because I just didn't care for the end result!   As I took it out of the pan, it just fell apart.   It was not the texture I was expecting!

This is the first time I made banana bread and I can't get over how good this is. I didn't have enough plain flour so I added some wholemeal flour to make up for it and I added a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg too - amazing!

This turned out really good even tho I had to make substitutes.... no buttermilk so used yogurt and some left over shredded pineapple with juice to equal a cup.  I decided to use both baking soda and baking powder to get a nice rise.  We like pecans so added a cup.  Next time I will add a full cup of pineapple and all the sugar. I used two cups this time so frosting could be put on. Really tasty.

I chose this recipe as I had lots of bananas in my freezer. I added  2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, chocolate chips and cinnamon chips, a 1/2 cup each, and decreased sugar to 2 cups. Batter filled 3 loaf pans. My hubby and grands gobbled it down! Thanks for the recipe.

I did all of what it said But cut back on the sugar to 2.5 cups. milk and vinegar instead of butter milk added  choc chips and crans  cut up some peanuts  i didn't have pecans  cooked the 9x13 of one hour  then cooked a 10 x 10 pan it was too much for one pan but cooked it 20 min longer it wasn't done with the other.
It was great moist  and all only used 4 black bananas not 6 only had 4.. still great... Thank you lots had a bet with girlfriend who is better... well you guess it.. she doesn't know yet .. So who's your Daddy? lol

I made a 1.5x batch split into 3 regular loaf pans and 4 mini loaf pans - some to eat & some to freeze. I didnt have buttermilk so I used heavy cream & half n half instead. I made a bourbon maple glaze for mine. 1/2cup of confectioners sugar, a cap of bourbon & probably 4 tablespoons of real maple syrup. Just add small amounts of syrup until its the consistency you want. I only needed 40 minutes in the oven. Turned out fantastic, but so much sugar!

I've made this recipe several times, in the 9x13 pan, soooo good, and in 3x loaf pans. Sometimes I add as little as 1 cup sugar and it works out. If you want store bought banana bread sweetness the full 3 cups is perfect. I add nuts and cranberries to one of the loaves and it's delicious. Also, we don't buy milk so I almost always use a milk substitute and it's most often cashew, but we've tried with almond, coconut and soy with great results too! I love this recipe, and other than the reduction of sugar and milk, I wouldn't change a thing!

I used this as a base recipe...and will begin tweaking it.  I wanted a banana bread recipe that bakes up as a 'moist brick'.  That may sound strange, but it accurately reflects my memory of the *best d*mned banana bread I ever ate*.  I used buttermilk in place of milk.  I cut down the sugar.  I added old fashioned/rolled oats in place of half the flour...which added an extra texture.  Not sure what I think of that.  Will either downgrade to quick oats - or omit altogether in place of the original amount of flour (I made a half recipe and baked it in a loaf pan).  I love the results for a first run.  It resulted in that 'basic brick' super-moist loaf of quick bread.  Looking forward to tweaking this into my 'go to' banana bread.  PS -- my bananas (all 3) were pitiful.  I had maybe one cup of mashed banana total for the half recipe.

Awesome!  Really nice fresh banana taste.  Very moist and when it was fresh had a very nice crisp top (after 1st day got a little mushy but still tasted great).  The only changes I made were that I halved the recipe and made in a 9x9 glass pan and used butter instead of margarine.

Kids & husband love it. They ask me to make it every time they see bananas. I substituted brown sugar for white- as i prefer brown. Very good flavor.

Great recipe! Very banana-y! The only thing I would add is to make sure you check on it often. I was checking every 10-15 minutes, but at 57 minutes, I checked and it was a bit overcooked. It didn't detract from the taste, though. 
I added cinnamon. I will definitely use this recipe again!
