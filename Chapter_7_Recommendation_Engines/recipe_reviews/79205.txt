I am the submitter of this recipe. This is the first time I have checked in the recipe since it was submitted. For some reason it is listed as 2 tablespoons of Old Bay and Worchestershire but it is actually 2 teaspoons of each ingredient. 2 tablespoons of each is way too much. Until I can get the actual online recipe adjusted to reflect the correct measurements please just remember to adjust the seasonings to 2 teaspoons of each. Thanx! :)

I thought this was great.  The original recipe does have way too much old bay and worchestershire.  I cut to about 1 tsp each.  I added a little lemon juice and about 2 oz. mayo instead of 2 oz. of cream cheese.  It's very good and close to the Olive Garden's version.

I agree with the first review.  The portions for the seasonings are far too strong.  I added 4oz of cream cheese and 6oz more of crabmeat (I love crab!) and reduced the seasonings to 1 tsp of Old Bay, 1 tsp of Worchestershire, 1/4 tsp pepper and added   4 Tbsp of whipping cream to help the mixture spread over the marinara sauce.     The concept is great just the portions were excessive.

I made this recipe for a 4th of July picnic and it wasn't at all like the Olive Garden dip that i absolutely love! The Old Bay was way to strong,and combined with the black pepper...ewww, i could'nt even taste anything else! i had to send my hubby out to get more ingredients so i could start over...i ended up using the crab, cream cheese, and instead of white chedder i used orange sharp shredded chedder.(and for the layer on bottom, i used a nice marinara instead of spaghetti sauce) it actually ended up tasting way better, and very much like i remembered at Olive Garden,in my opinion it doesn't need any of those spices, they are too over powering, i still served it with the sliced baguettes, it was a hit at the picnic, and i will make it again this same way of course!

This is an EXCELLENT rendition of the Olive Garden Seafood Dip (I love it too, so I'm glad someone came up with a rendition). I tried it for a birthday party with the sliced baguettes and it was a hit! I added a little bit more spaghetti sauce and another can of crabmeat and it came out perfect:) Will DEFINATELY use again

I actually forgot about the reviews and made as written with 2 tablespoons of Old Bay and Worcestershire and I didn't find it overwhelming. The only change I made was to add a can of shrimp so I'm not sure if that made a difference or not. It was very good straight out of the oven and although I found the ingredients to be an odd combo, they worked nicely together.
