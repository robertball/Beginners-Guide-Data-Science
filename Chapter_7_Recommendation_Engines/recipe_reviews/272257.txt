The entire family loved it and I have 2 picky eaters! It's perfect the way it is but I do want to reduce the calories and make it a little healthier so next time I'm going to cut the grease and butter in half and add more broccoli. I may try to use half the amount of cream and replace the other half with skim milk.

This casserole was delicious. My family loved it. Instead of using the broccoli with the topping; I put 1 cup of broccoli in with the sauce before adding the cheese. The seasoned bread crumbs and butter on top gave an added crunch. I will make this many more times. Thanks.

Would definitely make this again.  Super easy and tasty.  Great week night dinner.  I used GF rotini pasta and GF bread crumbs which turned out great.   I also substituted 3/4 cup of the Real Bacon crumbles from Costco instead of the 7 slices of bacon.... used olive oil instead of bacon fat... and shredded smoked gouda instead of plain.  Next time, I would try adding the red pepper flakes that Diana71 suggested.  The creamy cheese flavor was not too rich but instead just right.

I would love to make this again.  I did add red pepper flacks that gave it a little spice to it, and then before I added the breadcrumb mixture I topped it with extra broccoli rice.
