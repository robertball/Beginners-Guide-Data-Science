Great basic recipe. I love the simplicity! I love the fact that there is only one type of cheese. Sometimes, less is more and this is one of those times. Mac and cheese is a classic and should not be complicated with too many ingredients. The onion gives it nice flavor as does the mustard. If someone  wants to have some additional flavor, just put some seasoned breadcrumbs on top! Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone loves mac n cheese!
This is my basic recipe,  too...I add 1/2 Cup grated romano or parm for that lil something extra
Make it gluten free!
Use rice pasta (white rice [look in Asian market] are smoother, corn, quinoa ect. become grainy)
Use oatmeal flour...let it thicken for 7-10mins 
Up the milk 1-1/2 Cup...add more as needed
Don’t forget to add the parm and or romano cheeses!

I loved the look of this recipe before I started it. It was relatively easy. I liked the "different" flavor the mustard gave it. Wayyyyyyyy too much onion for me, but that is to do with personal preference, I expect. If you are a "really cheesy" person, I would add a lil less milk and more cheese..or at least more cheese. My two cents! I'll probably make it again sometime.

The sauce is very creamy and good. For anyone who doesn't know, the trick to making a roux sauce is to ensure you really stir the flour into the butter mixture, and add about 1/4 cup of the milk at a time, stirring until it is quite thick...THEN adding more. I added veggies and some italian seasoning and it was lovely. Thank you!

This is one of my favorite ways to make macaroni and cheese. I like to used extra sharp WHITE cheddar when I make this recipe and add just a touch of hot sauce and black pepper. NOTE: If you are worried about the sauce being too thin, you can undercook the pasta just a touch and pour the macaroni cheese ingredients into a baking dish and bake for twenty minutes.

This was very good.  It was not quite what I expected but that was my fault for not using more flavorful cheese (I only had colby jack and mozzarella on hand).  I can only imagine how good it will taste with sharp cheddar or pepper jack!  I also appreciated the tip for making roux sauce.  I would have just poured it all in the pan!  I will definitely make this again!

This was OK. Admittedly, I always sub low fat alternatives.  That said, my kids ate their servings.  My daughter commented that she did not like the texture, as it wasn't real creamy.  Still, both kids ate it, and it's not box mix. Thank you for sharing. BTW my lowfat version had 289 calories, 13 Total Fat, 8 Sat Fat, 14 protein, 29 Carb per MyFitnessPal.com

Great simple recipe! I like to try different kinds of cheese for variation, but the recipe as written is good too.

I tried that with steak (adding mixed pepper) along with macaroni, and my family totally loved it!
Thanks!

Great!  Used half cup of milk and only 1 tablespoon of while wheat flour.  Also used some Parmesan on top after it finished and stuck in the oven 5 minutes to get crisp on top.

I made this recipe exactly as written except I didn’t have enough sharp cheddar so I had to add some mild cheddar. It came out perfect. I like the consistency, which is super creamy but not soupy and the flavor is spot on.It would’ve been better if the Cheese was sharper.   I’m looking forward to making this next time with a sharper cheddar.  Very easy to make.

good basic recipe - add more butter and milk if planning to oven bake for 15 minutes or so.

I did not like the original recipe at all.   It was like a cheese gravy with macaroni noodles swimming in it.  I added an additional 1/2 cup of macaroni, and added extra cheese to thicken it up.  This recipe is not my ideal mac and cheese.
