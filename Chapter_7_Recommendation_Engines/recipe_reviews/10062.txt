I thought that this was one of the best sugar cookie recipes that I have ever tried. I liked that the dough didn't have to be refigerated before rolling it out. That makes it probably the fastest sugar cookie to make. These are meant to be iced. I highly recommend using the Butter Icing for Sugar Cookies on this website. Using these two together I have decorated cookies for Valentine's Day Halloween and Christmas.

This is a fantastic recipe for making a simple cutout cookie as a base for a flavorful icing. I substituted butter for shortening and added a pinch of baking powder to puff them up a little bit. I did need to refrigerate the dough before rolling it out. When they cooled them I mixed up a thin icing of confectioner's sugar corn syrup a touch of juice and some food coloring. The cookie is perfect for a fruity icing since it is not to sweet. The icing hardens and the cookies look and taste as though they're from a bakery. Everyone loved them.

This recipe was yummy! I actually made it for 144 servings (288 cookies) for family and gift giving. wow. a luscious cutout cookie that improved as the days went on...it did not disintigrate or get crumbly and was a dream to decorate. As it is not too sweet the icing was the treat and it got an A-1 rating by the hubby and kids for dunking in milk or hot cocoa. Very addictive cookies. YUMMY! (Note: blend all ingredients very carefully as you go if you're making a mega-batch especially!)

Great recipe! Cookies are delicious light and crisp. Easy to make. One hint - the dough was rather sticky for rolling out I had to use quite a bit of flour for dusting the pin & the table top. Other than that excellent recipe. I will make it again and again!!!

Great recipe. I used butter instead of shortening. Not too sweet which is great because everyone usually adds icing etc. Perfect when you're in a time crunch because they don't need to be chilled.

I tried these cookies for the first time and I ended up making two batches!!! They were so easy and they rolled out just perfectly even for me!!!(I am not the most patient when it comes to rolling out dough!!) Once frosted they were delicously moist and perfectly sweet!!!

I made this recipe last night/today (I usually cook at midnight or.. 3AM! haha) The only thing is adding the eggs to the recipe I found that I only needed to add one egg. This maybe was because the eggs they sell in my country are sort of big well I bet in the US they're bigger haha but I seriously thaught that if I added the other egg I would screw up the recipe:C adding the flour the dough was kind of falling apart a little bit but when I 'kneaded' it a while longer that didn't happen anymore. I was too sleepy to bake them last night so I baked them this morning and instead of icing I decorated them with some colored sugar they turned out really nice! My family really loved them and I think I'm going to use this recipe again for Valentine's or something;! Thank you SO much for the recipe:)

This is so easy to make and with an adequately floured surface easy work with. I used 1/2 butter crisco and 1/2 regular crisco for more flavor. I've used this recipe for a few years now I think it's the best.

These cookies turned out very bland - my 2 & 3 year old boys wouldn't eat more than one...even with icing. I was too embarrassed to bring them to a preschool program so I ending up throwing them all away. This recipe has been tossed in the recycling never to be made again!

This recipe is easy to work with and makes beautiful cookies..perfect for decorating. The only negative comment I could make is these cookies have very little taste on their own. They need frosting or something to add some taste. then they are great!

Wow! This was the easiest yummiest sugar cookie recipe ever. I was even able to make these allergen-free for my children by substituting Ener-G Egg Replacer and vanilla-flavored rice milk for the regular milk and eggs. Combined with the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe on this site we've made this recipe five times in the last three weeks. A couple of hints: 1. Combine dry ingredients before adding 2. Use dusting of flour when rolling out 3. 1/2 inch thick made the best cookies

They were easy to make and easy to roll out! But the downside is they are flavorless even with icing or sugar decorations on them. I won't use this recipe again.

I felt this was much too bland for a sugar cookie. Butter cream frosting improved it immensely!

I discovered this wonderful recipe when I was 15 years old.It became tradition that I make these cookies every year for my boss and my older sister. Now five years later I am still being asked by everyone to make these. They are great using butter or margarine frosting with a simple icing sugar and butter icing is awesome. Thanx for the wonderful recipe.

It's true that this dough requires no chilling which is nice. The cookies cut out very easily. And because they are not sweet themselves they balance out very well with a sweet frosting. One problem: They are extremely dry! They were dry right out of the oven and after only two days in a sealed container they are completely crumbly. We'll keep searching for that holy grail of sugar cookies.

I have been using this recipe for 15 years and it is the best. The cookies are not very sweet on their own but with icing they are just perfect. And the fact that the dough doesn't need to be chilled is a bonus! I highly recommend this recipe.

Great cookie! Easy to make and delicious. It is almost like a biscuit (tea biscuit) and with royal icing it is the perfect amount of sweetness.

very good cookie - a little bland but perfect with sugar/icing -- needed a lot of flour to roll it out.
