I'm so glad to be the first to rate this great tasting dip. I did use 1/3 less fat cream cheese because that is what I had and the whole avocado because it was small with a big seed. My husband said it was a real keeper and licked his fingers clean. Creamy and perfect for cracker spreading, with nice bits of crunchy bacon. You almost wouldn't know the avocado is in there, I'm tempted to not tell anyone and bet my avocado hating friends will still love it...then I'll let them know that I forgot to mention the avocado. :)
