I have to agree with previous reviewer, Zita on this one. Two teaspoons of cocoa in a German CHOCOLATE pie? Shouldn't there have been some chocolate chips or baker's chocolate somewhere in the recipe? And also, I baked it for the suggested 45 minutes and the top started to burn but the center was STILL liquidy. You were right Zita, a waste of ingredients. I'll only make this again if it's revamped with more chocolate added. Sorry :(

I used 2 Tablespoons cocoa instead of 2 teaspoons and the pie was great.  I cooked it for 50 minutes and it was crispy and delicious. My other German Chocolate Pie recipe makes 2 pies and I only wanted 1, so this was perfect.  Will make again.

There was no chocolate flavor at all. The recipe called for 2 teaspoons of cocoa, maybe it was supposed to be more.  I have had this pie before at a restaurant and this tasted nothing like it. What a disappointment and waste of ingredients!

I made this pie for my DH for his birthday.  It  was really fantastic and so easy.  I did use 2 TBSP unsweetened cocoa as others suggested.  It was very rich and chocolatey and he just loved it!  Thank you  for this recipe.

This pie great tasting, and was easy to make and everyone liked it, even if they did not like coconut and nuts.  I used walnuts, as that is what I had.

I ended up trying this pie because I had all the ingredients on hand. I read all the reviews before preparing and decided to tweek it a touch. Here is what I did: I added 2 Tablespoons of cocoa, used evaporated skim milk, added a cup of coconut and only had sliced almonds for the nuts. After it baked 45 minutes I checked it and it was real runny, that's when I realized that I had forgotten to add the cornstarch. So I baked it around 15 more minutes and let it rest for 30 minutes before slicing. It was perfect! - with a nice smooth creamy pudding-like texture. The nuts worked and the evaporated skim milk was fine. Hubby loved it with a glass of milk. So I recommend everyone to try this recipe.

Great pie, easy to prepare and a hit with the family! I added 2 tablespoons cocoa powder on the second pie and came out with a richer chocolate flavor. Thanks for sharing!

So I read reviews and yes do the two Tablespoons of Cocoa powder.  There wasn't a 1/3 cup package of chopped pecans in the store so I bought the 1/2 cup amount and used the whole thing. I think it was just the right amount.  At first you think it is gonna be soup ,but then you cook it long enough and it comes out perfect! 45-50 min for me.  Soooooo good!

Great pie, a little dense for my taste compared to other marvelous german chocolate pies I've had. Notes to myself: use 2 TBS of cocoa like others recommended, bake 30 minutes before checking it. New ovens may overcook it at 45 minutes.
