Really good and really easy.  My husband has never been crazy about couscous, but he liked this a lot.  So easy and so tasty, and it really is good hot or cold.  I used white balsamic vinegar, and that flavor really pops, giving you just the right amount of tartness.

This recipe is the best couscous recipe I have ever eaten.  Delicious. My husband said it was his favorite too.  Just the way it is.  Don't change anything.

I liked an easy recipe using my garden's fresh basil.  We liked it warm or cold but warm is my preference

Awesome!  I've made this without the balsamic before.  The Balsamic adds a great flavor to this.  I absolutely love this!

I brought it to a work party and did as the other reviewer stated by using white balsamic vinegar!  It was amazing we all loved it and it was so easy.

Oh... So Good! I had a dinner party and made plank grilled salmon and this couscous recipe. Everybody loved it! It was so easy to make and was a refreshing summer side which also replaced the green salad. I looked forward to eating the leftovers the following day. Especially good with the tomatoes and basil I grow around the house. Would not change a thing! My daughter just requested this recipe for the second time.

I love all the ingredients and it was easy to make, but I agree that it came out a little bland. I made it exactly as listed. Maybe more balsamic or adding capers or olives would kick it up a notch.

My family loves tomato basil salad and couscous.  This is the best of both worlds!!  I substitute red wine vinegar as we like this flavor better and because we are not feta fans, I used fresh mozzarella ( cubed).

Love this!  I was trying to figure out a new way to use my garden basil and farmers market tomatoes and this is perfect!  It's just as good cold as warm too.

It's certainly easy enough. But a little bland.  Obviously can add any veg to it to pick it up a little, with no more fuss.
