It was late in the day when we fired up the grill, so the fish was only in the marinade for 5 minutes or so, but it had a wonderful flavor!  We'd definitely make it again!

Quick and easy.  I marinated while waiting on grill to warm up and tasted just as good as when I have marinated for the hour.  My husband doesn't usually like to eat fish and loves this recipe!

Wow, yummm!! I didn't have white wine so I subbed chicken broth. Still awesome flavor! Easy and delicious meal, and with the grilled lemons and parsley it is impressive enough for company.
