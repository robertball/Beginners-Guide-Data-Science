My boyfriend has type 1 diabetes and i wanted to make him v-day cookies! so i used this recipe with a few changes - first off, i only made half the recipes. then i substituted the Splenda "Sugar Blend" for the original Splend "Granular" (the Sugar Blend has real sugar in it, unlike the Granular which he can have). By doing that, I needed to double the amount of sugar I used because the sugar blend version is sweeter than regular sugar. So instead of 1/2 cup, I used 1. then from a tip on the splenda website, i added an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract (totaling it to 2 teaspoons instead of 1). i lightly sprayed cooking oil on the top so they would brown (because splenda granular doesn't brown like regular sugar). i rolled the dough and let it sit in the fridge for 1 hour. after that i sliced the dough into 1/8 inch slices and baked then for about 10-15 minutes in 325 degrees. they came out pretty good!! a little dry though so maybe next time i'll add a WEEE bit of water.

Loved the cookies--BUT-- i only used 3cups of flour AND I didn't chill the dough. I rolled them walnut size, and flattened with bottom of glass and baked 10 min.  They were perfect.

I also used splenda no calorie granular in this receipe as well as king arthur white whole wheat flour...it was in crumbles...I added 3/4 cup of water to get the dough to mix into a ball.  I have not baked it yet but I think there may be to much flour on the ingredients.  next time I will cut the flour to 3 cups instead of four IF I try this one again

I used 3 cups flour instead of the 4 cups.  They really reminded me of my childhood, at Christmas time.

Do NOT make this bad, bad recipe. These are more like biscuits than cookies and that was only after adding 3/4 cup of milk because the dough was obviously too dry. Even with adding the milk, the dough felt like clay dough rather then cookie dough. The cooking time took longer than expected by about 5 minutes. On the other hand, take the word, cookie, out of this recipe and you might have something.

I will probably make this again, though it is not my favorite.  I had to bake it up to 11 minutes, and still it did not brown up quite right.  Not a big deal since many people prefer it with little or no browning on the bottom.  It is a tasty recipe, and worthy to be posted and tried.

I will never NEVER make these again! They were too dry. The taste wasn't great for me either. I don't think they are worth trying with 3 cups of flour instead of 4. Hated these. Will stick to my good old fashioned fattening full of sugar recipe.

There is too much flour in this recipe. Works much better if you use 3 cups instead of 4.
