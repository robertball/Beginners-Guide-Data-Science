I've been on AllRecipes for years now and this is only the second time I've rated a recipe. OMG! This was fabulous!  I've been married 45 years so I am no novice to the kitchen. I followed the recipe to the letter.  The flavors blended beautifully.  My "pinch" of cayenne pepper was 1/2 tsp. and my "seasoned salt" was Adobo.  Hubby had 3 helpings humming all the way though dinner.  I was worried that there wouldn't be enough gravy because I was serving it with mashed potatoes, (I saut√©ed onions and garlic and mixed it in the potatoes yummmmm!) but I decided to stick to the recipe and there was plenty of gravy.  Definite keeper!!!  Thank you Robin!

Delicious with my little twists to the original recipe!  I used chicken thighs because that's what I had and leftover homemade creamed corn made with cream cheese, in addition to carrots, celery and onions.  I figured that would only add to the creaminess.  It did!  I also added sage and thyme throughout the process and on top of the crescent roll crust. Delicious!  My hubs and kids loved it!  "Mom this is so good! " With every bite!  Love it! Thanks for sharing!

Amazing!  My family wants it weekly...actually, they wanted it the next day.  We compromised on weekly.  I did add a pie crust on the bottom as well as the one on top.  Worked beautifully.  Also used fresh veggies, cause that's what I had. But did a pre-cooked to soften.  And had some chunks of leftover roasted baby red potatoes that I threw in.  I was worried they wouldn't maintain their structure, but it did beautifully.
 Thank you for a great recipe! This was my first attempt at making a potpie.  I was a little intimidated.  But this  was simple and delicious!!

It drives me crazy when people change the recipe and then complain about it...However I did change a couple o f things, but I don't seem to have messed the recipe up cause we still loved it. First off I am ethically opposed to using frozen veg during the summer. I used fresh and actually blanched them , so they were still crunchy.  I omitted the sour cream cause it expired in 2017. And I used our pie crust cause that's what I had. It was delicious ( I covered the edges with tinfoil the last 10 minutes) . Thanks

This was a wonderful recipe.  I didn't change any ingredients.  I did lessen the salt since I used packaged broth and because of aesthetics I used white pepper instead of black.  It is by far the best chicken pot pie I have ever made in the 45 years I've been cooking. My husband who is not a big pot pie lover ate 2 helpings. No little twists or doubled gravy. Perfect the way it is.  Note for beginner cooks: if you are making with skinless chicken pieces especially breasts, cook your chicken in a stock made from chicken broth, carrots, onions, celery & pepper corns.  It will enhance the flavor of the chicken. I forgot to mention that I used a 3 qt 9" round casserole.  I think a larger casserole would make it a shallower casserole but that wouldn't affect the taste at all.'

This is by far the best recipe for Chicken pot pie. Follow recipe exactly and you will love it. I make this in five 12oz ramekins! It is so elegant and nothing more is needed except maybe a few little crackers and a streaming not cup of tea or coffee ?.

My husband said, " that's pretty good stuff, I'm going to get more!" I only switched out the vegie package for a frozen in the bag  that had asparagus gold and white , corn and carrots in it. Oh, and I omitted the sour cream because I'm allergic to dairy. This made it a little thick so next time I'll experiment with either adding a little lactose free milk somewhere in the process or some coconut milk. Overall it was really a good go to recipe when you have left over chicken :) on a cold winter night.

Perfect, easy way to repurpose leftover chicken.  My husband loves this and it looks like I worked really hard on it.

Just made this tonight and it was so good!  My changes where a bisquick crust and a bit more seasoning (I like seasoning). I had to crank up the heat at the end and cook it a bit longer due to the change in crust. It was very flavorful,  but I wouldn't call it quick, took me about 2 hours including cleanup. Granted I had to cut up and cook the chicken and veggies since I don't normally have frozen.  I can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow!

This was so easy to make. The only thing I use is two sheets of the pastry dough. This was a HIT with my young kids.

I have made this several times.  Every time I make this recipe.  I get "Oh we are having Chicken Pot Pie" hugs and grins.  I like because nothing is processed but it tastes really good and not too difficult to make.

This was a great recipe. Instead of using peas and carrots, I threw in frozen mixed veggies. It was wonderful. The family can't wait for me to make this again. Also used others' tips and used Grands biscuits on top. I'm sure it would be great with leftover turkey too!
