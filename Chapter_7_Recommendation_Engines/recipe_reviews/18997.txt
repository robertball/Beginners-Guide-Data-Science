VERY easy and tasted great, although it does take a little time since you have to wait for the jello to set.  I think this would probably be easy for kids if you used cool whip in place of the packet of dream whip.

I made this for a family reunion and everyone was very intrigued with it's wonderful appearance. I have diabetics in the family, so I simply substituted the gelatin for sugar-free gelatins. I also changed some of the flavors, but stuck to the color scheme.  This is very easy to make.

OK! Made exactly as stated but substituted 8oz Cool Whip for the whipped topping to save time. Put into jello mold (sprayed mold lightly with cooking spray first and it slipped right out!). Presentation didn't look anything like broken glass, so the kids were disappointed - they were expecting to "eat glass", but it tasted good. The combination of lemon jello and pineapple juice was excellent! The different colors did start to run together in the binding jello & whip cream after it sat out during dinner, which didn't look too appetizing, but overall it was tasty. I probably won't make this again as the prep involved is too much trouble. Thanks anyway! It looks like others enjoyed it much more than we did!

If you like jello, this is great. I'm not a jello lover but I still enjoyed it. It was fun and easy to make. I really just wanted to make it because I think it looks so pretty :0)

This jello was a big hit!  The only change I made was to use 2 cups of cool whip instead of whipped topping mix.  It turned out very colorful and tasted great.  I will make this again for Christmas instead of using orange, will only use red and green colored jello for presentation.

This desert reminds me of the dish my Mother made every Christmas that she called "Crown Jewel Cake".  I make it now for my grandchildren.

I didn't make this recipe per se. I took the idea and made a jellied salad for our Thanksgiving dinner (being diabetics, we used sugar free jello, fresh fruit and water packed, no sugar added fruit cocktail. I also used 97% fat free Cool Whip. No additional sugar was added. I find that fruit natural has enough sugar.) Cut up three different flavours of jello. Stir lemon jello into Cool Whip. Cut up a couple of apples and bananas into the Cool Whip, added a large can of fruit cocktail and gently stir in the cubes of jello. Then put the salad into a trifle bowl and put into the refrigerator for a couple of hours. Serve and enjoy! I received lots of compliments for this fruit salad.

It was okay... It could have used more flavors though, so i used some lime jello to spice some things up! It was great!
