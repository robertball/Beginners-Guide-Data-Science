My hubby had a craving for a Spanish Bar Cake, so I thought that I would surprise him and make one. This sounded like it could taste close to the ones in the grocery store....and BOY does it! I did, however, add 2 cups of raisins, which I boiled for about 5 minutes and "sqooshed" the water out of. This is a definite keeper! VERY YUMMY!(A warning about the icing though....don't overcook it!) Next time, I will do the icing correctly, and I think I will throw on a few chopped nuts for decoration. Thank you so much!!!

These are excellent. I baked these in a jelly roll pan. The frosting does need more water. It started to firm up before I could spread it over the entire cake. This is a keeper.

Warning:  I'm reviewing after messing with the recipe!  Instead of adding the butter cold and  beating everything for 2 minutes, I melted the butter and stirred until combined.  These were dense, spicy, cakey, and tasty.  Thanks! :-)

While these were very tasty and very moist, they were not "bar cookies" but rather a cake. So while I wasn't disapointed with the taste of them, I was disapointed that they were not cookies since I was making them for a holiday cookie exchange.

These are more cake-like than bars, but taste great. The frosting is super yummy, but  I let it sit about two minutes and it hardened up pretty quickly...never even felt it needed extra water as the directions mention.

This recipe was easy, and very delicious. Reminded me of ginger bread cookies. It is more of a snacking cake than a bar. It freezes very well (icing and all!)

Although I expected this recipe to make something resembling cookie bars, it was really more like a spiced sheet cake -- a very tasty one at that!

Because I used whole wheat flour, I added an extra 1/2 cup flour to make the batter a little thicker.  I cut the frosting in half.  These are great!

I didn't find that I needed to add any extra water to the icing. I actually had to add some extra icing sugar. When it was all done, it got a huge smile of approval from my husband. It's a good way to use up the leftover coffee since neither one of us are coffee drinkers.

Very moist, very tasty. The browned butter icing is perfect. I made it in a 9 x 13 pan and adjusted the cooking time. I will make these again, but I may add more ginger.

This is the first recipe I've "rated" and I decided to do that because it's sooo good! I was a little hesitant to make it because of the other reviews stating that it was more cake-like than bar, so I was thinking it might be a little dry. It isn't as dense as bar cookies, but it is very moist and light, kind of spongy, and the icing on them makes them even better. Like some of the other reviews, I doubled the spices and will do that again. My boyfriend LOVED them and asked me to keep making them. Thanks for sharing!

Tasty, forgiving recipe. I had to change it slightly based on what I had in the pantry...I used 1/2 ratio butter, 1/2 vegetable oil; 2/3 c granulated sugar + 1/3 c brown sugar; and substituted honey for the molasses. It still turned out beautifully.

This is recipe is an old family favorite my mother used. Instead of the butter powdered sugar frosting, Mom used milk and powdered sugar. Jana's frosting recipe  is much tastier and so easy to make. Thank you for sharing. I plan on making these bars for  my mother's 100 birthday celebration. She's no longer with us but we gather as a family to remember her. The bars will be a welcome surprise for all.

These are probably the best ginger bar recipe on this site.  Someone thought they should be like cookies.......bars are usually softer than a cookie and more moist.  These are moist otherwise would not be eaten in this house.    Thanks for finally producing a ginger bar that is easy and moist with excellent icing.    I do make sure that the butter is at room temperature otherwise no changes needed.   Can t make them too often or I will eat and eat.
