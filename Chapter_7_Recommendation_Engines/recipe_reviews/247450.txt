This salad is lovely, delish and easy to make. My family enjoyed it. I will make this again before summer peach season ends. I added a touch of cardamom just for a nice surprise.

Amazing!  The flavors blend well. It was a great compliment to our grilled ground sirloin steak. Mad dinner taste gourmet! You will not be disappointed. I made the bread by pressing the clove of garlic and putting it in the olive oil and adding a little punch of basil and oregano and brushing it on the bread before grilling.
