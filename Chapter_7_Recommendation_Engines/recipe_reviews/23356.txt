There is nothing wrong with this recipe!First of all..of course it is sweet! Look at the ingredients..butterscotch and peanut butter make one of the sweetest combinations known to mankind! This is not an everyday snack-it is a treat.   The easist no fail way to prepare is put it the chips, butter and peanut butter all in the same bowl and microwave it for 1 min...then stir until all the chips have melted.  Your butter and peanut butter wont seperate and it will turn out great!

I made this recipe for a potluck at work and I found that you need a LOT more than 2 cups rice crispies. I put 4 cups, and that worked. I also put the butterscotch chips, the butter (*note - I used I can't believe it's not butter and it turned out good) and the peanut butter all in a bowl in the microwave for about 2 minutes, stirring every 30 seconds. Worked great. I think with these alterations this is a great recipe to make for that special relative with the sweet tooth!

Great recipe! I have been looking for this for a few years- they are very sweet, and ADDICTIVE. I first used 5 cups of cereal and that was a little too much- I just made them again and used 4 cups this time and they are PERFECT!

Do NOT melt the marshmallows, folks!! They are supposed to be all colorful and yummy. The butter, peanut butter, and chips are melted. Then you add the marshmallows and cereal. They are meant to be whole and delicious. I've also had this many times w/o the cereal. It is a fun treat. Just do not make them like rice krispie bars -- the submitter did not mean for them to be melted -- see the description in step 2. Look at the pic for Rocky Road drops by adellois and you'll better be able to picture what this is like!
Now, yes, you can get crazy creative and add many things to the colored marshmallows-- like different cereals, M&Ms, choco mini chips, some white choco chips.... This treat is a classic. Maybe some of you need to see some other pictures to see how this is to look. It cuts through lovely and is fun to have all of the colors showing from the marshmallows! We always have made it in a buttered 9x13 (w/o rice cereal, 9x9) dish, and cooled it to get it to set. Enjoy!!

I melted the butter & peanut butter together in a large pot on the stove top over low heat then I added the butterscotch chips and stirred them until melted. Next I added the marshmallows stirring until melted and finally I mixed in 4 cups of Rice Krispies and then transferred everything to the 9x13 pan to set.

I made this last Halloween and have had several requests/expectations that it will be at our party this year.  The one thing I did last year to help it stick all together better was melt some semi-sweet choc. chips and drizzle and spead it over the top.  It added a wonderful something extra.  So, so rich and yummy.  If you like butterscotch, you'll love these!

I tried this recipe and it turned out hard as a rock.  Almost like peanut brittle.  Followed the directions to a tee.  May try one more time later.

I followed the recipe and they came out perfectly. They are very sweet, but they have a great flavor. I have no idea what you would have to do to these to have them come out 'hard as a rock' as a previous reviewer stated. Old, hard marshmallows? I actually had to leave mine overnight for them to really firm up. They were very soft and gooey. The second time I made them I tried 1/2 butterscotch chips and 1/2 chocolate chips and I think they were even better that way.

This is a good recipe and one that I will make again.  The only changes I made was that I used Ric Chex and melted the butter and marshmellow together as if I was making a rice krispie treat.  Added the remaining ingredient and also added a cup of coctail peanuts.  Yummy for sure!

I had tried these for years at parties and always forgot to get a recipe.  They were great and everyone at work gobbled them up:)  I even tried them with kelogg's Total cereal (that's all I had) and it was super!  I also added more than the alloted 2cups of chips.  Yeah baby!  note: please rinse after consumption to reduce risk of getting a cavity :)

This recipe is a bit of a disappointment. I used an additional 2 cups Rice Krispies (2x the amount suggested) and probably could have added more.

I don't understand why people are melting the marshmallows or using marshmallow fluff. The marshmallows are supposed to be whole, coated with the peanut butter/butterscotch mixture, and have that pretty marshmallow chunk look when they're sliced. They are not rice krispie squares per se; they are peanut butter and butterscotch squares with chunks of marshmallow and flecks of rice krispies. And, they're spectacular.

Great tasting and quick to make. I didn't have any rice krispies but they turned out great without them. I used coloured marshmallows for a more festive look.

This is a great recipe but instead of rice cereal I add 1/4 cup salted crushed peanuts. I've never had anyone complain and kids love to take a rolling pin to a zipper bag of salted peanuts.  I also make this over a double boiler but will try the microwave instructions next time. Because I have found in the past if the stove is on too high the oil in the peanut butter separates.

This recipe is a childhood favourite. We’ve omitted the krispies.  This recipe follows the long tradition that squares are cut real small because they’re so sweet.  It is meant to have a lot of mixture around the marshmallows. This recipe isnt a mistake, just make it the way you enjoy it the best add stuff omit stuff it’s all cool.

Recipe is very good overall.  I used marshmallow fluff to avoid the added cornstarch in mini marshmallows (about 7 oz).  Definitely needs more rice krispies. I used a little more than 4 cups and still didn't think it was enough.  Also if your a peanut butter lover I would add more peanut butter.

Excellent! Super easy sweet treat! Only make if you've got friends/family to share with as they're almost as rich as fudge. Look much prettier with rainbow colored marshmallows. ** I also upped the amount of rice krispies to almost 4 cups. **

YUM, these were great!  I also used 4 cups of Rice Krispies and used snowman marshmallows for the holidays.  I melted the chips, butter, and PB in the microwave together as well, this was so easy and they were a big hit!  They are really sweet, but that's what makes them wonderful!

I've finally found this recipe after looking for so long! It's a personal favorite! However... WARNING!: Extremely sweet! Only for those with a big sweet tooth! I've made it at least a dozen times since I've found it and varied it up a bit. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, and it could have used more rice krispies. I've never before seen this made with rice krispies before, so I just added more marshmallows, witch also works great! I usually make it with 4 cups of rice krispies now though. (Decided I like the crunch that it adds!)Great sweet treat, super easy and super quick to make!

Just like my grandma used to make!  They are very rich.  Cut them small and serve them as a dessert, not a snack like regular Rice Krispie bars.  They go great with tea.

I really don't like them. My husband seems to think that if I dipped them in chocolate it would taste like a whatchamacallit candy bar. The butter seperated from the rest and made them all greasy on the bottom. I also didn't think they were sweet at all.  Maybe I added too much cereal, but it looked entirely too wet (the seperated butter) that I didn't think they would set up.  I don't think I will try this again, sorry.

Very good. I didn't find them too sweet at all. I did add more rice crispies to mine though - probably another 1 1/2 cups. The only thing I can say is that they seem a bit crumbly but mine have only been chilling for about 35 min. before I had to try one. Great recipe if you're a butterscotch fan!

I made these treats and took them to my daughter's school for teacher appreciation week.  Everyone loved them.  You have to be in the mood for a sweet treat.  I am making them for my family reunion this week also.  Very easy treat to make.
