Has the potential to be a really great recipe, but I found 1 tsp of orange zest to be way TOO much. The orange zest overpowered the cinnamon/nutmeg flavor and the natural taste of the sweet potato. I couldn't taste the pecans at all. The texture of the filling and the sweetness were perfect and I liked the consistency of the pecan pie topping, but next time I'll use just a pinch of zest (less than 1/8 tsp).

I made this pie for thanksgiving and it was hit!  I skipped the orange zest and used a 9oz pie crust instead of 6oz.  I also doubled the sweet potato and pecans ingredients in this recipe.  Would definitely make this again.

This pie is unbelievably delicious and puts pumpkin pie to shame. The only alteration I would make to it when I make it again is to lessen the amount of orange zest as it takes away from the actual taste of the sweet potatoes.

Absolutely delicious!  I followed this recipe to a T, except for the grated orange rind (for some reason I can't zest to save my life).  I made 2 of these pies for our big Thanksgiving get together last year and everybody loved it!  I didn't find out until later, but one of my uncles actually took the second pie and hid it in the trunk of his car after he tasted it.  He just called me yesterday and told me to please make sure I make him his own personal pie this year, lol :0)

Used yams for the recipe. Didn't have any orange zest, so I skipped it. The pie turned out great! Very easy to make. This one is a keeper.

This was simple & delicious. I used a homemade graham cracker crust and spiced it up with some cinnamon, nutmeg, & allspice. I also added 1 tsp. of allspice & clove to the sweet potato mixture. I loved the orange peel...gave it great flavor. For the topping is subbed maple syrup for the corn syrup & maple flavoring, doubled the pecans, and used only 1 tblsp of brown sugar. Came out great!

I just got back from Thanksgiving dinner for which I made this sweet potato pecan pie.  My sister in law brought cheese cake, cream puffs, cookies, and brownies, but guess what everyone was gushing about -- this pie!  I was so pleased!  When I say gushing I mean people were saying, "of everyone on this table, this pie is the absolute best. I have NEVER tasted anything like it!"  It really was good. Not too sweet and hits the spot with a cup of coffee.  Highly recommend!

I have made at least four of these pies since Thanksgiving and my family is asking me to make two for Christmas. Can't go wrong with this recipe.

This was a very funny experience  :O) I made this pie exactly following the recipe.    "I" found the taste to be bland ... not sweet enough for me, YET 7 out the 8 people that completed the pie LOVED IT!  If you don't like sweet this pie will work for you.   The texture is creamier that the traditional sweet potato pie.    I did not like the pecan topping.   There was SO much of the liquid left over.    I would cut the topping in half and keep the same amount of pecans.

Leave out the orange zest and this would be a 5 Star Pie. The orange zest overpowers everything and you lose the taste of the sweet potatoes. The consistency and topping are excellent.

Great recipe! I was hesitant at first because I'm a loyal pumpkin pie fan, but this was different and delicious! It's like a tasty sweet potato pie center with a crunchy pecan pie crust. I too also left out the orange rind, and it still tasted great! The only thing I would change it using a 9 oz crust instead. I had extra filling and topping I couldn't use even though my 6 oz crust was totally full so 9 oz would have been perfect!

I just made this pie and it is delicious.  I did make a few variations though.  (1) I used sweet potatoes, 1/2 stick of softened butter, 1/2 Tbsp nutmeg, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1.5 cups of sugar, 3/4 can evaporated milk.  (2) Whip hot potatoes and softened butter until thoroughly combined. (3) Add sugar, nutmeg, vanilla extract, eggs and milk.  Beat until very smooth. (4) Bake in a 9 in. deep dish pie shell on 350 for 20 min.  Take out oven and spoon pecan topping over pie, spooning around the edges of the pie FIRST.  Surround the perimeter of the pie with pecan halves.  Bake for an additional 30 minutes on 350.

I only used about 3/4 t orange zest, as others said 1 t was too much. It was the perfect amount in my opinion, as I like the zest. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. After licking some of the batter off my fingers, I could hardly help from eating the whole thing before putting it into the oven.
Two of my siblings told me I HAD to bring this to Thanksgiving this year. I will need to make two though because it went fast. Great fall recipe!

This is a terrific recipe with some of the small changes mentioned in other reviews.  I left out the orange rind and used a 9" pastry pie shell.  Also, the first time I made it there was too much liquid from the pecan topping which dripped over the sides.  This time I used a slotted spoon and eliminated some of the excess pecan syrup.  Perfect!

Great recipe! I left out the orange. My husband (who doesnt normally eat sweets at all) ate over half! I blended up almost 2 cups of pecans, and so it was partially chopped and mostly ground up, I was worried it woud ruin the topping but it didnt and actually it prevented the runny and liquidy topping everyone mentioned. I aleady printed this out and put it in my recipes. I am going to try pumpkin puree next time just cuz I really like pumpkins and I bet that would be good too. Oh I also used a 9 oz pie shell and put egg whites around the edge and on the bottom and precooked the shell (about 5mns.) before putting in the mixture.  This helps to prevent burning too early on the shell and it wont get gooey.
