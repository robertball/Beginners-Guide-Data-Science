Everyone loved this!  I used more fruit, only 2 T of sugar on the berries, and I accidentally forgot to add the creme fraiche (although I purchased it!).  I used 2T of powdered sugar in the whipped cream and the whole dessert was lovely!  Really great recipe!

This was a fantastic dessert! I couldn't find creme fraiche so I substituted full-fat plain greek yogurt. It was great! I served it when having company and got great reviews! I'll make it again!

I liked it, but think I would make it strawberries only and more berries.    I also think I will use more sugar and try confectionary sugar.
