I substituted all butter instead of shortening to avoid the trans fats, and these cookies came out INCREDIBLE!  Gingersnaps have always been one of my special favorites--cookies I absolutely adore but tend to be picky about and thus have only very rarely.  Now I've found a perfect recipe so I can make them on my own!  The holidays are long past, yet my apartment currently smells like Christmas, and I have about 3 dozen light, crisp, pleasantly spicy, semi-sweet cookies cooling in my kitchen.  This is definitely a recipe going in my "Will Bake Many Times Again" file!

I was very nervous making these cookies because Gingersnaps are my husband's favorite cookie and his mother makes them all the time all year round. I had a lot against me - biased views and no knowledge whatsoever with this type of cookie! I've never made Gingersnaps before. The smell of the cookies during the mixing stage was wonderful! Very Christmasy. :) The baking smell was even better! My kids couldn't keep their hands off these cookies once they were done, and when I tasted them I could see why! These cookies are amazing in flavor! I did do one thing different from the recipe - I added 1 teaspoon of cloves into this as well, because my husband likes his gingersnaps good with spice. The drumroll for me came when he came home at night and I gave him a cookie to try. I could tell he wasn't expecting much (being biased for his mother's) but after the first bite his eyes got wide and he said "Wow! These are REALLY good! They taste just like Mom's!" I told him that her recipe is different (hers calls for oil) and he said, "Don't worry about it - just make these - they are wonderful!" They have a great outside texture for crunch and inside chewiness. Perfection in my husband's opinion! Now I wish I had made these much sooner in my married life. His smile and face was all worth the jitters of messing it up! :)

Good gingersnap recipe.  For those that don't have a sifter, try using a pasta strainer or wisk prior to adding to the recipe; they work in a pinch!!!  Not the best I've had, but definitely better than most!  Would definitely make again!!!

I made these to give away at for Christmas, and got rave reviews from everyone!  They are definitely more chewy than traditional gingersnaps, but we like them that way.  The only problem I had was trying to figure out the correct cinnamon/sugar mix.  I first used too much cinnamon and they turned out dark-looking and too "cinnamony". I then mixed 1/3 cup sugar with just one and half tsp. cinnamon, and they were perfect!  Very good!

This is the best ginger cookie I have ever had! I made a couple batches at Christmas. When the recipe is followed exactly, sifting and all, the cookies come out beatiful with a crackled top. But I got lazy and only sifted the second batch once. The tops didn't crackle, but the cookie was still delicious. I will be making these every year.

This is the same recipe my great-grandma, grandma, and mom have used.  I lost my copy and am so glad to have found it.  I follow this recipe exactly but flatten just slightly....I like mine slightly puffy.  For my dad, I press with a glass dipped in sugar.  He likes his Gingersnaps thin and crispy.  Thanks Marie!

This were good cookies - but I'm only giving them 4 stars because there wasn't much 'snap' in these gingersnaps.  As a ginger cookie though, these were very nice.  I did add 1/4 cup more flour to my mixture so they would look puffy - instead of flattening out like my cookies always tend to do!  I think the next time I make these, I may add a pinch of cloves to give them a spicier flavor.

I LOVE these cookies and I'm making them again for my family's Thanksgiving get-together.  If you like your gingersnaps crispy, leave them in a few extra minutes.

my family never made gingersnaps, so when my husband requested them this year, i wasn't sure about it, but i love these cookies!  i was scared of how strong the batter smelled because of all of the molasses, but cookies have a milder taste, which i love.  i used butter in place of shortening and added a dash of nutmeg.  thanks for a great christmas recipe!

I did not like this recipe at all.  The cookies were bland and had way too much baking soda and ginger.  All I could taste was baking soda and ginger.  I am definitely in the minority here.  Won't make these again!

These are amazing and amazingly easy to make!  I just made a batch and they came out perfect!  I want you all to know that you can use whole grain flour and brown sugar instead of white (I did use about 1/4 cup of white for the cinnamon sugar) and they STILL come out superb!  This is a great recipe--no wonder it's lasted over 100 years! Thanks!

The best! I've been looking for a really good gingersnap recipe. Texture is great, kids loved them.  I made mine a little bigger and got 4 doz. out of the recipe. Thanks for sharing.

These are a go-to cookie recipe for me! I had a roommate with an egg allergy a few years ago, and I found that substituting 1/4 - 1/3 cup of applesauce for the egg in this recipe produced soft, delicious cookies that slowly became crunchy "snaps" if you left them out on the cookie plate on the counter, or stayed soft if you put them in a sealed container once they cooled. Either way, I like them so much with applesauce that I won't switch back to egg!

The first time I made this recipe my husband liked it a lot (you cold tell by how fast they disappeared) but asked for more "bite."  The second time I added 2 tsps, grated fresh ginger and about 1/3 cup chopped candied ginger.   Now he LOVES it!

All I can say is WOW!  This is a great recipe!  This recipe was many firsts for me: first time making gingersnaps, first time using shortening, first time using molasses (because in all honesty, I hate the taste of molasses itself and so was praying the ginger and cinnamon would be enough to overpower it).  I was a little nervous because of all this, but I had been really craving gingersnaps and so gave this one a go.  I followed the recipe to a T and they were amazing!  I was kind of hoping for a gingersnap cookie that actually, well, "snapped" and was crunchy, but after I tasted the flavor of these, I could really care less!  They were excellent with a crunchy outside and chewy middle.  I just might have eaten 4 in a row.  Just might have.  (Hey, at least I made them small, ha ha.)  The cinnamon sugar on the outside also really gave these cookies something extra that made them outstanding, so don't skip it!  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe, I'll be making it again and again!

Gingersnaps are my favorite cookie and these are the best I've ever had. I did substitute butter because I didn't have shortening, and I rolled them in plain sugar. The taste was awesome, and the texture was just how I like, soft and chewy with a little crisp on the bottom. If you want a true hard ginger"snap," just bake for a couple minutes more or leave out uncovered over night. This is the only recipe I will ever use.

These are just what I was looking for, soft and chewy on the inside and a nice crisp on the edges.  Added 1tsp. ground cloves for an extra zip, and only had Olive Oil margarine so used that instead of the shortening and they turned out perfect.

My family loved these cookies. I hate sifting flour, so I only did one sift and it was just fine. I do think a little less flour might be better (less cakey) and a tad less ginger. One Tablespoon is quite a lot. Oh and I used real butter. Yum!

These were absolutely wonderful, crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.  I did need to flatten my cookies out on the cookie sheet to get them to bake correctly.  I made them with no other alterations, awesome!

These are wonderful. I love to make them small and put half of a large marshmallow on them (cut-side down) just as I pull them out of the oven. I cut the spices down just a tad to make a more mild flavor, and they were superb.

I used blackstrap molasses for a richer flavor and added a pinch of cloves.  I cook in a gas oven... 10 minutes yields a soft cookie, 16 yields a more crunchy, hard cookie that is the type you want to dip in your milk before eating.  Either way they are delicious!

Excellent!  I did as other reviewers suggested and used butter instead of shortening.  I also added a dash of cloves and a pinch of nutmeg.  I tried a batch where I flattened the ball, but didnt like that.  Just put the ball on the cookie sheet, they come out great!  Also, I found the dough easier to "ball" after refridgerating it for about 15 minutes.

Another reviewer mentioned having an issue making the cinnamon sugar...its a spice already made, so just look for it in the spice section at the grocery store....awesome cookies...BIG hit!  :)

First time making Gingersnap Cookies and they were absolutely delicious!!  I used unsalted butter instead of shortening but kept everything else as is.  These were crispy on the edges and chewy in the middle - perfect!  I cooked some a little longer for my husband who likes his crunchy and those were great as well.  I got rave reviews from friends and family and have passed the recipe on to friends who also got rave reviews.  Great recipe!

These are GREAT.  Made for a party at church and got rave reviews.  If you leave in longer they get snappy but not hard.  The ones I took where chewy.

these are so good!  I did adjust the recipe adding some of the touches from my grandmothers recipe- I tsp clove and I added ginger to the cinnamon and sugar to roll the cookies in.  I baked them on parchment and only 9 minutes and they are PERFECT!  Yum!

These cookies remained soft for days and don't take much time to bake. My husband and I love them right out of the oven. They're fun to roll around in the cinnamon sugar, too.

I used demerara instead of white sugar; unsalted butter instead of shortening; and a 50/50 mixture of honey & brown sugar because I didn't have any molasses on-hand. These cookies still turned out *perfectly*. Beautiful, thank you!

I didn't have dark molasses-  I used mild and they turned out amazing.  I added a pinch of cloves- really perfectly spiced.  not too much, not to little. One of my favorite recipes now.  1st batch came out a little flat, but I thought the batter seemed a little thin.  So I just eyeballed it and added a little more flour so it rolled nicely in my hands. Much better after that! Tops crackled and everything!

I can't help but doctor recipes to suit my taste. I never use shortening so butter was substituted. I added 2/3 cup chopped candied ginger and added 1/3 cup of the sugar the candied ginger was packed in to the one cup of sugar. I baked for exactly ten minutes and the cookies were firm on the outside and soft and chewy inside and melted in your mouth. Don't skip rolling the dough in cinnamon/sugar - it adds a great flavor and gives the dull brown cookie a nice sparkle. Thank you for a great recipe I will be making for years to come.

OK seriously, I think these might actually be the best cookies in the world. Hell, maybe even the Universe! I know what you're thinking, how could they be 'that' good? That's what I thought after reading all the other glowing reviews, but once you try them...you'll understand. Trust me. These are my new vice!

I used butter instead of shorting, and 100% whole wheat flower. They turned out amazing! I love the softness and how there is just the right mount of ginger flavor.

Amazing- the most delicious gingersnaps I've ever eaten! I only made this recipe because I was craving gingersnaps but didn't have any brown sugar and this recipe used white sugar! I used non-hydrogenated shortening and gluten free flour. Thanks for sharing this recipe:)

These are the gingersnaps I remember from childhood!  They are perfect exactly as the recipe is written.  I'd say they take more than the 30 minutes described on the recipe, but it was all easy.  As much as I love snickerdoodles, these have a more complex flavor and are my new favorite cookie!

This was a very easy and delicious cookie. Made it exactly as recipe instructs. Yes, I used shortening! I know, bad bad me, but shortening doesn't spread like butter. That's probably why a lot of reviewers said their cookies spread, because they switched to butter instead of shortening. The recipe calls for shortening for a reason. It also keeps the cookies soft.

I didn't have shortening or molasses so I substituted butter for shortening and a mixture of 3 tablespoons of dark brown sugar mixed with 1 tablespoon of water microwaved for the 1/4 cup of molasses.  These cookies were AMAZING. amazing. chewy, flavorful, an absolute delight that I will reuse again and again when I want to.

These are the absolute BEST ginger snaps I have ever made or eaten!   I followed the instructions exactly - no changes at all.   I also was diligent about sifting the flour mixture as instructed.  My cookies came out beautifully crackled on top.  They are crisp around the edges, soft in the center, and will make an amazingly wonderful addition to my holiday cookie trays.  My kids also want me to make them again after Christmas so they can take them to school for lunch :-)

I made these without sifting any of the dry ingredients, I don't have a sifter and was short on time.  They came out absolutely perfect and taste fantastic!  I also substituted splenda granules for the sugar to cut down on the calories, and you can't even tell there is not sugar in the recipe.  I did roll them in real sugar/cinnamon because I wasn't quite sure how the splenda would taste, but I did not use the full 1/3 cup.  I will definitely be making these again as soon as I finish the first batch!

I'm not even a fan of gingersnaps, and these are still the most delicious cookies I've ever made! I followed the recipe exactly (used Crisco for the shortening - wasn't worried about fat content, and mild-flavored molasses) and they turned out incredible.  Soft, delicious, exquisite. Watch carefully so they don't overcook.  You won't be disappointed!

I also use all butter, and blackstrap molasses.  For more "snap", use only a marble sized ball...for more "chew", use a larger ball.

My family raved about these cookies. We generally like our cookies very soft, but we all preferred the second batch I baked for about 11 minutes to the batch that was cooked for about 9. I used butter instead of shortening, and replaced about 1/4 cup of the white sugar with dark brown (since I didn't have any molasses). I'm sure it would be better with actual molasses, but it was delicious this way, too. Thank you!

I LOVED this cookie. I was sceptical at first....but let me tell you! My family could not get enough of them. Even my very picky child ate them! Soft and chewy. Be sure to time them correctly if you want your cookies to be soft. If you like them a bit crunchier, just leave them in the oven longer. Great flavor. This is a definite part of my recipe book.  Thanks for the recipe!

LOVE IT! I bake mine for about 9 minutes so they're a little chewy on the inside. I've tried the recipe with both shortening and butter and liked the ones with shortening much better. The shortening is important for the great texture of these cookies.

I like to add a filling and make them sandwich cookies- 1/4c butter, 1/4c milk, 2T instant vanilla pudding mix, 2c powdered sugar, 1/4t vanilla, 1/4t almond, mix the pudding mix and milk, add butter, then sugar, vanilla and almond.

These cookies were awesome! I made a few changes (mainly through accident or limited supplies), and the cookies came out perfect! First, I substituted all butter because I don't cook with shortening. I read online that 3/4 cup is 1 and 1/2 sticks of butter. I used two tablespoons of ginger (because I am an idiot and read the recipe wrong), but they came out lovely as a mid-range spicy cookie and not at all overpowering. For the cinnamon sugar I mixed 1/4 cup sugar, 1/2 tablespoon cinnamon, 1/2 tablespoon ginger, and 1/8 teaspoon salt (the salt really accents the spiciness well and is very subtle). I had some of the sugar and spice mix left over, so I put it in a sealed container to use on something else later. I happen to love super spicy ginger snaps, so I may add more ginger (and possibly a hint of nutmeg) next time. New favorite cookie for sure!

I love gingerbread in the form of cake, cookies, etc. I've used different recipes almost every fall & through the winter in past years and have found them to be good but, I still continued on my search for "great". This recipe is it! They're spicy, crisp but, chewy at the same time. I did "tweak" this a bit because I love a little extra spice and stirred in some chopped crystallized ginger to the dough. They were simply delicious!

Perfect combination of spices makes these a fan favorite. You can adjust your baking time so they turn out chewy or crispy. Both are good options. Delicious!

Delicious and perfectly done. These cookies are the perfect nostalgic Christmas treat. 
Before you bake, the recipes says to roll in cinnamon and sugar - I used cinnamon and "sugar in the raw" (large, brown crystals). It gave them a crunchy texture and beautiful sheen.

Excellent! I did do all butter versus the Crisco but otherwise I followed the recipe. Raving reviews from my husbands work!

I loved these!
I substituted all margarine for shortening, added 1 teaspoon of cloves as another reviewer said they did, but in my second batch I used only 1/2 a teaspoon, and cut back to 2.5 tsp ginger.

I find the cinnamon sugar mixture for coating to be unnecessary. Just use sugar, otherwise it becomes too "spicy", and they lose their fresh, wonderful taste, and become almost "dirty" tasting.

I just took these little gems from the oven and popped one in my mouth.... scrumptious!!!  Here are my changes: I used non-hydrogentated shortening, hand mixed everything, and I did not roll them in the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  Perfection.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

It is August and I am in heaven with these cookies... My only suggestion is instead of the cinnamon sugar, I made Gingered Sugar using 3 Tablespoons of sugar mixed well with 3/4 tsp. ground ginger.. I roll the dough balls and like another reviewer, I press half of the batch with a water glass to make gingersnap cookies as well.. These are AMAZING and go so well crumbled on top or on the side of Creme Brulee or a scoop of ice cream... so glad I found this recipe..

I also substituted butter for shortening because that was what I had on hand and added a little nutmeg.  They were so tasty!  Definitely on the chewier side...even after I baked them 12 minutes then let them hang out in the cooling oven.  If these were "snappier" they would be a five star recipe.

My mom absolutely loves these. Ginger snaps have always been my favorite cookie and I was excited that these turned out as well as they did. I did end up adding a dash of ground clove and a bit more cinnamon. AMAZING recipe.

Great recipe - excellent selection of ingredients and easy-to-follow recipe instructions. Baking for just under 10 minutes produced a deliciously moist and chewy cookie. I'm very pleased with the results! Note: the cookies puff up in the oven, then flatten, so do not be surprised. I am going to read up more on this to see what can be done to keep them puffy. Also, regarding the shortening, I used butter. I've learned in my culinary class that the term is sometimes used interchangably--it's just the fat that's needed in the recipe and can be refering to butter or shortening (Crisco). I prefer butter, so that's what I use!

These were easy to make and very yummy, even my daughter that doesn't care for gingersnaps that much ate them!  I used unsalted butter  instead of shortening.  They rose nicely in the oven and then flattened just before I removed them from the oven.  I see that some of the photos submitted are a light color.  Mine came out a dark brown.  How did other's make them look so light in color as if they didn't use molasses or dark brown sugar?

At any rate they were chewy and flavorful and everyone loved them.

These were very good, but I did not feel they had enough Ginger. I like mine to have a bite. I would probably increase the ginger by 1/2 tablespoon. I did not keep the balls rolled very small, mine were more like quarters and they turned out big and somewhat chewy (which my family loved). It is very important to do all the sifting, since the ginger is somewhat clumpy. They were definitely a favorite around our house and I will cook them again. Thanks so much for sharing your grandmothers recipe.

These are awesome!  I did make some variations - but I know they would be great as is.  I substituted butter for shortening, and added 1/2 tsp ground cloves, 8oz dark chocolate chips and 4 oz crystallized ginger.  I also didn't do all the sifting.  I LOVE these cookies!!

These cookies are great. My grandmother and I made cookies yesterday and she wanted to make box mix. I suggested that we try this recipe instead. After we made the cookies and tasted them she was very glad that we decided to make these cookies and not box mix.

These are the best ginger cookies I have ever tasted. They won't "snap" but they are wonderfully moist and chewy. Don't skip that second sifting, I think that might be what gives them that texture. I make them every year for myself and my son in law. You won't convert the folks who don't like ginger cookies but that leaves more for you!

I add some more vanilla and a lot more spices, and even a little coriander (just a pinch gives these a nice snap!).  These cookies didn't even last 10 minutes once there were out of the oven!

I got so many compliments from this recipe and a few requests for the recipe.  The cookies ended up a little flatter than the packaged mix, but I think that's just the family curse: I don't blame the recipe!

Good start for a gingersnap recipe.  To make it healthier and even tastier, I used whole wheat flour and blackstrap molasses.  Substituted 1/2 cup butter with applesauce, doubled the spices, and added about 1/4 cup flaxseed meal.  Soooo hearty and yummy!

These were very snappy cookies! Perfect with a cup of tea. I followed the recipe exactly except I used baking powder instead of soda. They came out well-crinkled. I will need to practice more to get the right size!

I just made these cookies and they are incredible!  I was a little worried when I pulled the  out of the oven because they seemed very unstable and squishy.  But after letting them cool, they were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  These are so amazing that they're almost gone, and they've only been out of the oven for fifteen minutes!!!

This is the first absolute 5-star recipe I have found on this site! Amazng cookies. I rolled them into balls and flattened them a bit. I Followed the recipe verbatum otherwise, and they cracked on top perfectly! Who knew a shortning recipe would be so good (I usually go butter or 50/50).

Great cookies! I added an extra 1/2 tablespoon of good quality ground ginger and the cookies are very flavourful.  Thank you for sharing your recipe, Marie.

These cookies are the best!  They truly "snap" and melt in your mouth.  I included these on my Christmas trays and everyone raved about them!  Thanks for sharing.

I made a couple changes after reading other reviews. 1/2 cup shortening and 1/4 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, added 1 tsp. ground cloves and 1/2 tsp cream of tartar. I baked them exactly 10 minutes and they are sooooo goooood and snappy everyone wants the recipe.

OMG!  These are the best.  I do not modify the recipe at all.  They are  not really snappy, but firm and chewy.  My husband and I love love love them!  I made them at Christmas as part of my cookie gift bags, but I had a really hard time including these because I did not want to share.  My husband was a bit upset that I did include them to give away.

They were a big hit where ever we went! They are so soft and chewy (unlike gingerbread). I made them a week before Christmas and they just as good 2 weeks later! Yum!!

Um...made a DOUBLE batch of these as part of my christmas baking, so I would have lots to give away. I'm now standing in the kitchen with my apron on, making more...between my kids, husband and many visitors, the first 90 I made disappeared! Another reviewer said the recipe was missing the "snap" I think the only thing the recipe forgot to mention was that they should be hidden!!! DELICIOUS!!!

I used 1/4 applesauce, and 1/2 cup butter instead of shortening, added the 1/2 tsp of cloves, pressed the balls into turbinado sugar, no cinnamon, the dough was very sticky, next time I will refridgerate dough for an hour, but they came out great anyway. Very addictive. I got 45 cookies out of this recipe,

I thought I screwed these up, as my batter was very wet.  I just added a few more tablespoons of flour until it was "rollable."  Also made my cookies too big, just baked them a little longer.  Tasted one and it was DELICIOUS.  Crispy on the bottom, soft in the middle, yum. I added 1 tsp cloves, as some suggested.  The flavor of these cookies is divine, and the cinnamon sugar on the outside is just the special touch to complete them.  Saved to my recipe box!

Fantastic recipe and much-loved by everyone who tries them. One thing: do not skimp on space between cookies on the sheet - two inches apart or bust. They spread out quite a bit while cooking!

Turned out wonderfully. They puffed up nicely in the oven, and were melt-in-your-mouth when they were fresh out. Very filling, very delicious.

Oh, I LOVE these! I make them a lot, but use 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour and more brown sugar instead of white. Also double the amount of ginger and add ground red pepper to the cinnamon/sugar I roll them in for a hotter kick. Oops, and butter. I loved the original recipe too, but just like to play with it, depending on whats in the kitchen cupboards!

As much as I'd like to give this a better review I can't. The flavor was nothing like my regular Gingersnap recipe and unfortunately most of the cookies were given away as we did not like the flavor or texture.

Thank you.  These came out picture perfect and tasty yummy.  I'm making these for my Grandmothers Birthday.  She is 75 today and these are her favorite cookies.  She will love them I'm sure of it.  I substituted butter as well.  Only because I love real butter flavor in my sweets.  Thank you for sharing.    Ruth Hernandez L.R., AR

Not enough ginger.  Also they turned out really flat like others said.

I can't believe I haven't rated this recipe before now. I have made this recipe countless times, and I always have to double it. This is by far the recipe I have used the most from this site. These cookies are addictive, I don't usually make them unless I plan to give most of them away because I can't leave them alone.  I usually cook them for about 9 minutes or so, when they are at the stage where they look like they could use another minute.  They are best chewy, in my opinion, but if you like crunchy cookies then leave them in a little longer. I have many requests and compliments for these cookies, from co-workers and family.  My 17 yr old daughter has made them for her friends and gets requests for them also.  If you love the taste of traditional gingersnaps, (but prefer not to eat 'rocks') this recipe is for you.  Crispy outside, chewy inside, absolutely delicious.  Oh, the only thing I do different is use butter rather than shortening, I never have shortening on hand.

So delicious!  I also added cloves, because I like a spicy ginger cookie.  But the best part of this recipe is the consistency.  Perfectly chewy with a little crisp around the edges.  Yum!  Big find.

I think I baked mine too long (longer that the recipe says since I seem to always have to bake stuff longer in my oven) even thought I watched them closely.  They just didn't look done but then they turned too crispy even though they were baked on an airbake sheet.  I prefer the Big Soft Ginger Cookie recipe on this site.

These cookies are obviously great --based on the five stars from most people.  I think they are most definitely a five star cookie.  My husband said they are the best cookies ever made.  I made two batches- the first I followed the recipe exactly.  The second, I added three dashes of ground cloves and one teaspoon of grated fresh ginger to the sugar/butter mixture before I added the flour.  This batch was better in my opinion.  It added the puch of ginger that so many recipes lack.  I did use butter instead of shortening in both recipes.

Great cookies - I baked them for 11 minutes and they were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside - perfect for dunking in coffee!  These are definitely a do-again!

These were excellent cookies - and so easy to make.  They were everyone's favorite out of all the holiday cookies. Soft and chewy and full of flavor.  Even the men asked for more!

I have been making this recipe for a couple of years now and find it to be the best recipe ever. I prefer to use the shortening instead of the butter option since it allows them to keep their shape better. Also, I do use the dark molasses and dark brown sugar. I think the lighter color comes from the mixing process.  Very nice!

I just made a batch of these, and they are delicious!  I used becel margarine instead of shortening.  I didn't have ground ginger, so I grated a peeled ginger root and used that instead.  I'm not a big cinammon lover, so I rolled the cookies in sugar.  They were wonderful!

Amazing - my new favorite cookie!  I always loved gingersnaps when I was a kid, but I haven't bought store ones in a while.  When I was looking for different kinds of cookies to bake for the family for Christmas, I saw these and tried them.  They came out absoultely perfect, and I'm sure I'll make them all the time now!

This recipe is awesome! I didn't realize I was out of molasses so I used honey and added 1/4 tsp all spice and it was just delicious! I love softer cookies so I took out the cookies after 10 min but left a batch in for 13 min for my hubby. I got soft melt in your mouth goodness and he got his crispy crunch fix. I can't wait to try these with molasses! Thanks for a great recipe!

Wonderful! My husband loved these. Our friend was over and he ate about 7 after they came out of the oven. 
I did add the extra ground cloves and more of the spices but didn't change anything else, and it turned out SO DELICIOUS! Perfect!

is the dough supposed to be sticky? they rose nicely in the oven then fell as they cooled, so i ended up with a thin crisp cookie that was a tad too sweet. my daughter took them to work & her coworkers asked for the recipe

Just made three batches of these wonderful cookies for our annual cookie exchange tomorrow. They are so easy & so delicious. Since I never made gingersnaps before I didn’t change a thing. The one thing I would suggest is chilling the dough for a couple of hours, before baking. Makes it so much easier when rolling in the sugar/cinnamon.

Have made these for years passed down from my grandma the only difference is she added
 1/2 tsp cloves and rolled them into a ball and rolled in granulated sugar then cut the ball in half put on baking sheet cut side down, press down to flatten a bit.(Mrs Ayers Receipt, a Grandmother's receipt)
An absolute favorite for the holidays or whenever I can be talked into making them

I made this recipe today with just a few changes. I used butter instead of shortening & I added in a bit more ginger & cinnamon, also a hint of cloves & nutmeg. They tasted wonderful and I do not particularly like gingersnap cookies! My kitchen smelled awesome and I plan on making more this weekend to pass out to family & friends! Thank you for posting this recipe!

this was a very easy recipe to follow. Since i am allergic to gluten, i switched to a gluten free all purpose baking mix. You can not tell the difference at all.  the taste is just like it would be if you used regular flour. and like others i substituted butter for the shorting. everyone loved theses cookies!!!!

Great cookies. Came out soft and chewy. Used brown sugar instead of white. First time I made gingersnaps, first time I ate gingersnaps, so I did not trust my assessment of these. However the husband has several fond memories of eating gingersnaps. He says these were very good, and reminded him of his grandma's recipe when he was a boy. Thank you so much!

I'm going to give this 5 stars as I'm in the process of mixing the batter right now from the exact same recipe my mother and grandmother used.  Every ingredient is the same including the double sifting!  I know these will be the finest of all gingersnaps as I've made them dozens of times in my 77 years.  Shortening really does give them a nicer texture than the butter that some have suggested but I've always been concerned about the trans fat factor.  However, I have found a vegetable shortening made from palm oil that has 0 trans fat and now use that exclusively.  Thanks, Marie, for sharing this wonderfully delicious and fragrant cookie recipe with everyone.

I made these for Christmas cookie giving and they never made it to the neighbors.... even after 3 batches.  They are that good!  DO NOT skip the sifting. If you don't have a sifter, put the flour in a bowl and whisk it.

These are the BEST Ginger cookies I've ever had.  I used ginger sugar left over from making candied ginger as the outer sugar and replaced 1/2 cup of the white sugar with my ginger sugar as well.
Even when underdone (oops) these are great.  Thank you so much for your family recipe Marie!

This is a fantastic recipe and sooo easy!  I made them for a cookie party and then a couple weeks later for a potluck with rave reviews all around.  I followed the recipe as is, but like several others added clove and nutmeg.  I discovered I didn't have a sifter so I added the dry ingredients to my blender and pulsed it a few times.  The end result was a perfect slightly cracked cookie surface.

This is a great recipe. Everyone loves these cookies - they are beautiful and delicious. A perfect cookie for gift baskets. I am liberal with the ginger and divide the shortening 70/30 between shortening and butter. The butter gives a bit richer flavor and this ratio keeps the baking time and temp as per the recipe. I don't use cinnamon in the final sugar dusting and I do tamp the cookies a bit with the bottom of a glass. They have a terrific crackle and sugar sparkle!

This is a GREAT cookie recipe - loved that the dough was so easy to work with and not sticky or hard.  I used butter instead of shortening and then for the 2nd batch (after tasting), I added cloves for a bit more spice.  Perfect!!!

Soft but Chewy, and not too sweet. I used Becel salt-free margarine instead of shortening, but they turned out perfect.

These are addicting.  I used these for a Cranberry Pear Gingersnap Crumble.  It was wonderful!  I left my first two batches in the oven a little longer than 10 minutes and when they cooled they were pretty crisp.  I took the third batch out right at 10 minutes and they cooled to a nice soft cookie.  All 3 batches were so tasty!  I did add 1/2 tsp of cloves for a little extra kick.

These are really tasty, but not what I think of when I think of gingersnaps. I was looking for a crispy, dark-colored cookie with a bite to it (flavor-wise). These are quite mild and tender. Tasty, but not the kind I thought I was making. Thanks for the recipe!

Thank you for sharing your family recipe.  One bite, and I could understand why they have been loved through the generations.  These cookies are fantastic.  I used full-flavor molasses, Crisco, and a homegrown egg.  These cookies are prefect as written - no need to change a thing.

I just made these.  They spread a good bit, and make a very flat cookie with a nice, crinkly top.     I gave it 4 stars because I needed to make a couple of changes.  I added 1/4tsp of ground clove, and only sifted the dry ingredients once.      I got a cookie that is much darker than the photo above, which is fine.  When I think "gingersnap" I think of a dark cookie, not a blonde one.  My kids have declared these "better than chocolate chip cookies."

These are truly delicious! A slightly crunchy cookie outside and chewy on the inside. If you want a bit more crunch leave them 2 more minutes in the oven. These are perfect with the pumpkin dip on this site. Thanks for the yummy cookie recipe!

These. Are. Delicious! I used butter instead of shortening and added a tsp of cloves and I am swatting hands left and right to keep them away from the cookies! Thank you for an awesome keeper of a recipe!

Wonderful!  I've made these twice now, and can't wait to try them again.  The first time I made them using all crisco shortening, the second time around, I used 1/2c butter and 1/4 cup shortening.  I prefer the butter/shortening combo just because the texture ends up a little crispier and chewier, at least in my experience.  These cookies were really beautiful and easy - everyone that tried them liked them, even people who aren't big ginger fans.

I am definitely adding this to my xmas cookie assortment. I added 1 teaspoon of ground cloves, as suggested by a few reviewers, and I loved the extra flavor. Also used butter instead of shortening. Tasted just like a cookie I used to get from a local bakery that just closed. The next time I make these, I want to roll the dough in large sugar crystals, I just need to find some!

These are super good and just what my granpa was wanting. I was out of shortening so I used lard instead (which I interchange often) other than that I followed the recipe to a T.  Entire family snarfed them down including the kids so there are not many left 1 hour after baking, lol. Have a feeling I will be making more soon!

Fantastic recipe.  My family is very fond of gingersnaps and I wanted to try a new recipe.  I ended up deciding to double the batch and other than that I also added 2 tsps. of ground cloves since we like them extra spicy.  The aroma throughout the house was unbelievable.  We could hardly wait for them to cool to dig in.

This makes a very pretty cookie with the crackles and the sugar coating.  If you want them chewy you have to take them out before they look done, just as they start to crackle.  Also good as a crisper cookie.  I used butter flavored crisco and they turned out great.

I love ginger snap cookies so I was excited to try these.  One plus for these, no butter.  With all of my holiday baking, I've spent what feels like a small fortune on butter.  These made the house smell delicious and tasted even better.  They remind of the ones my babysitter made for us as kids.

Slightly crispy outside with tender, chewy inside. Nice shape and thickness, although my cookies were not as puffy as the featured picture. The flavor is good, but it is more mild on the spice and seems like something is missing as compared to what I normally expect from gingersnap cookies. I would add 1/4 tsp of ground cloves to the recommended amount of ginger and cinnamon. I used a size 50 scoop, and the recipe made 37 cookies. They were baked on a Pampered Chef baking stone for 10 minutes, taken out of the oven and left to set for two minutes, then removed and placed on a baking rack to cool, which seemed like the right amount of time. I didn't do any of the recommended sifting of dry ingredients, and the cookies seemed to turn out just fine.

I enjoyed the cookies as written. To kick them up another notch, I made again with 1/4th Tsp of cayenne pepper, an extra 1 and 1/2 Tsp of ginger, and 1/4 Tsp of ground cloves. Another thing I noticed is that 1" balls create cookies about 2 1/2-3" across. Balls with about half the dough create cookies about 1 1/2-2" across. I like the slightly smaller size if I am trying to make snaps instead of softer cookies.

This is almost exactly my great-grandmother's molasses cookie recipe except that hers calls for 4t molasses, 1 rounded t ginger, and 1/2t cloves.  Hers also only requires that you sift the flour once.  I did go ahead and sift the flour several times according to this recipe, but it was really unnecessary.  The results were exactly the same as when I make my great-grandmother's cookies and only sift once.

OMG what can I say..this receipe is not only outstanding....but also easy!!
I have always loved Ginger Snap Cookies, yet have never attemped to make myself.  I purchased in store and can be quite costly.
However, I jumped in to this receipe and did it!  I added 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and extra ginger apprx. 1 tsp.  Another thing I added was extra cinnamon.
Also, when I went to take cookies of cookie sheet, I noticed the cookies were to tender and would not come out round, so I waited 2 minutes before taking off cookies sheet and these made the cookies come out nice and round!
I love the fact that I can now stop buying these cookies from the store, and since the receipe is so very simple I can now make anytime I desire.  My family can not get over how YUMMY these cookies are.  Last thing..I did add more mol. to the dough..very carefully.
Thanks So Much for this receipe!! Five Stars in my receipe book!!

I substituted the crisco with butter as well. I also used fresh ground ginger which added more flare. I remember my grandma telling me to use twice the amount of fresh than the ground/dried so I used 2 tbsp. of the fresh finely grated ginger. The ultimate test was my boyfriends' picky taste buds and he was ecstatic about these cookies.

Absolutely fabulous! I reduced the sugar a smidge and added a bit more ginger and cinnamon along with a dash of nutmeg and a dash of cloves.  I'll put in a bit less sugar in the cinnamon-sugar coating next time since I like my gingersnaps with a bit more bite. These are hands-down some of the best cookies I've ever made, and I will definitely be making them often.

I have never made Ginger cookies before so this was an interesting first for me. I would have to say that they were some of the best ginger cookies that I have ever eaten and I typically like Ginger Snaps for the crunchiness. I added about 1/8 more ginger than the recipe called for and a dash more vanilla. These were a big hit with family and friends!

Grandma's recipes are always the best!  This really tastes like a good old-fashioned homemade-with-love kind of cookie!  I resisted the urge to add additional spices like nutmeg and cloves, which I love, and this still turned out to have a nice balance of flavor and spice.  I like the idea of rolling it in cinnamon-sugar - I usually just use plain sugar, but it added a nice touch.  After 30 years of baking I finally realized that a fine mesh strainer makes sifting a snap, so thankfully I no longer avoid recipes where sifting seems to be an important step.

First time I ever made Gingersnaps and they came out perfect, just as promised.  Made a double batch with no problems.  They looked so pretty that I had to take a picture to submit.  They tasted wonderfully fresh for several days, until we ran out.  This is an easy recipe to make with children.

These are wonderful!  I substituted butter for the shortening and the result was very good.  Fantastic flavor and texture.  Great addition to the Christmas cookie tray.  I baked mine on parchment paper for super easy clean up.

These are terrific!  They taste wonderful and are quite easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly as written except that I did not roll the balls in sugar.  Instead I sprinkled the sugar on top when they came out of the oven - just lazy, I guess. :)

these were delicious!  I hgave never made gingersnaps before but one would never be able to tell.  The only substitution I made was butter for shortening.

I loved this recipe, and I was surprised too see how many cookies it really made.  Great for when you need to share some treats. I think next time I will make it a little spicier, add some nutmeg.

These cookies are so good!! I was a little nervous using a whole tablespoon of ginger, but they are great. I increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp as well.  This will become a holiday standard...nice to have a cookie that isnt as time consuming as some of my other holiday cookies.

These had a great flavor.  We compared them to a molasses cookie recipe and they taste very similar but with the added bite of ginger and not quite as sweet.  I liked them.  The dough is a bit sticky, so when rolling them, it helps to have a bowl of water waiting to dip you fingers.  Somehow, this wetting of your fingers keeps the dough from sticking to you.

Great gingersnap recipe.  My first making ginger cookies.  I am not usually a fan of ginger, but I wanted to make them for Christmas this year, and they tasted great.  The only thing I wasn't sure about was the cinnamon sugar.  Is that just 1/2 cinnamon and 1/2 sugar?  That's what I ended up doing and they were great.  Look forward to sharing them with my family.

Wow what a great Christmas cookie!!  Everyone at work loved them.  Reminds me of my mom and when she used to make ginger cookies.  I followed the ingredients to a T.  Excellent!!!  Can't say enough about these.  The fact that they are rolled in cinnamon and sugar is just icing on the cake (so to speak) :)

It's a good cookie, but like others, it's more like a molasses cookie than gingersnap. Still looking for a true gingersnap...

These are amazing! My husband loved these, so I decided to make it my "official Christmas cookie". And they're super easy to boot. They didn't keep their freshness too long, so I'll freeze half of them next time.

I am not a real big fan of ginger anything when it comes to baking. This was absolutely, melt in your mouth delicious. They were very easy to make. My 3 year old helped roll the cookies in the cinnamon and sugar. Even my hubby, who said he didn't like gingersnaps said these were good. Will make again.

These were just a delight to make! Super easy to throw together and they tasted just like my grandma's. However, I only got about 40 cookies out of this recipe (3 dozen) - and they were small in size. I got a lot of compliments when I took them to a baby shower (of course, every one there had the same grandma as me, so that's what we were comparing them to!)

Wow!, Wow! Wow! I made it with the shortening as written and follow the directions exactly as written, sifting twice and all.  I did amp up the spice a tad by adding half a teaspoon of cloves and a quarter teaspoon of nutmeg as I love the warm spices! Mine crackled so beautifully and are just absolutely delicious! First time ever making gingerbread and it definitely won’t be the last. Mine were perfectly done in nine minutes.

Made this twice, once with butter in place of shortening nd omitting the salt (used salted butter). It was good, but didht have much spice. I didht mind the chewy texture but even 12 minutes in the oven resulted in a cookie that almost bent when I picked it up after cooling.  The second time, I again used butter and omitted salt, but added 1tsp. cloves and nutmeg for extra spice.  I also added chopped crystallized ginger to half the batch.  I baked both for 14 minutes which resulted in a sturdy, crispy, and slightly chewy cookie. I realize adding the additional spices is changing the recipe, but it made it taste much more like a traditional gingersnap, which I prefer to the subtle flavor the original recipe produced.

This was a fantastic recipe. We tend to like a bit more spice than what most recipes have. This one was perfectly forgiving to our changes. Our only alterations were: doubling the ginger & cinnamon, adding 1/2 tsp of cloves and putting candied ginger pieces on top after rolling them into balls. We removed the cookies at exactly 10mins. THEY WERE AMAZING.

My#1 TIP: 
========
Buy a fresh bottle of cinnamon AND ginger spice before making these cookies if your spices are old in the cupboard (spices that are old can be bland). When baking or cooking use fresh spices that you purchased and that have been open under 1 year ago... six months if you are really into top results!
I have been in kitchens that have cinnamon and spices that are 3, 4 or 5 years old -- and that is such a mistake when cooking. 

I made these cookies and they are pretty good. Nice and puffy that relax and cool to a crackle top cookie.

It is a small batch so for a party you may need to make a double batch. I used a ice cream style scoop that 1-1/4" and baked them for about 11 mins at 350*.

EXTRA FLAVOR: I added an extra teaspoon of ginger because I like my cookies to have bold ginger flavor.  
I also added 1/4 tsp of cloves to round the flavor out.  

I rolled them in cinnamon sugar before and sprinkled a touch of cinnamon sugar on them after they baked.


I would rate this as good or even very good, but I am always on the lookout for the recipe that creates a soft cookie and is LOADED with flavor. 
FOR ME.... A gingersnap or ginger cookie should be spicy!

Just ok.  Really much more like what I would call Molasses Cookies.  Not small and hard and flavored anything like a ginger snap I've had in the past.

I don't know what the others did to make this recipe bland or too gingerly,  but I think it's perfect the way it is. I've baked this recipe three times, each time differently and all came out fine. First attempt I forgot the ginger altogether,  still yummy.  Second try I listened to a critic about too much ginger and put in half of what the recipe called for, still good but not excellent.  This last attempt I followed the recipe to the letter and WOW! I'll never deviate from this recipe again, practically perfect in every way.

Great!  Perfect level of spice. For a crispy outside and chewy inside--don't overbake. Bake until tops crack but they still look a bit wet. For my oven that was 10 mins. If your cookies spread into flat discs while baking, your dough is too warm. Put the dough in your fridge for 20-30 mins before baking. I did that and these turned out great.

I made these cookies.  They turned out flatter than a pancake even though I refrigerated them for two hours prior to banking. I followed the recipe exactly except I  substituted with butter. The look really big and flat, but taste okay.

I was searching for a gingersnap recipe to make as a gift for a friend and decided to give this one a try.......I have already eaten 3!  They are delicious!  I substituted butter for shortening, as I didn't have enough shortening, and the only thing that I found was they did not "crack". (I'm not sure if that was because of the substitution or not.)  Regardless,     the cookies are a perfect combination of crisp and chewy.  This recipe has been saved, I am passing it along to my daughter,  and I will definitely be making them again.  :)

Great recipe. Have made again and again and they always turn out perfect.  This last time I made as the recipe called for but I added 1/2 cup of chopped candied ginger to the flour and spice mixture before adding it to the creamed butter and sugar, and this made them exceptional!  I also usually use butter rather than shortening.

The Recipe itself is excellent but I use mc cormick pumpkin pie spice instead, and mine came out very fluffy so next time I will use just one teaspoon of baking soda, instead of two.

WOW!!! Amazing cookies and so easy. I did what some others suggested, using butter instead of shortening and I added 1/8 tsp of ground cloves. Did I say these are amazing?  Winner winner chicken dinner. Holy ginger!

We devoured these! I followed the recipe exactly, and they are perfect! I didn't get five dozen, only four dozen. I guess I rolled them a tiny bit bigger, but the 10 minute cooking time was still just right.

I just finished making these and they are amazing! I made them half the size and added ground cloves. Crispy and crunchy and wonderful. I made them as a sweet/savoury hors d'oeuvres - make a thumbprint when they're just out of the oven if they're a little puffy, then cool. To serve, put a small dollop of a preserve of choice, place a small piece of aged white cheddar on top of the jam and add a tiny bit of jam o top of that (for decorative purposes). The combination of flavors explodes in your mouth!  Makes 72 hors d'oeuvres.

Tried this prior to a Christmas cookie exchange and love them. I like the softness they have, but I did add 1 Tsp ground cloves. However, they seem to have a tad too much baking soda. I'll test it with half as much next time.

I made these cookies for my boyfriend, who is a die-hard gingersnap fan.  I know he prefers his snaps with a bite, so I went with other reviewers recommendations and added 2 tbsp of grated fresh ginger and he absolutely loved them.  Kudos for a great recipe!

Awesome receipe! A bit time consuming but still awesome I added a few things into the receipe like more molasses about 1/2 c , 2 tbsp of orange juice and a pinch of ground cloves and oh man my house smells amazing. I also chilled my dough and it made it a bit easier to make the balls

I am SO disappointed!  I used butter  instead of shortening, and I used stevia instead of sugar and whole wheat flour.  They are dry, didn't spread.  It's like eating sawdust.

These cookies were amazing!  I followed the advice from some other reviewers and added 1 tsp of fresh minced ginger, along with the already existing ginger powder.  I was concerned that it would be too strong, but it wasn't.  Instead it added a nice kick (although my husband and I do like ginger)!  I used butter instead of shortening and baked the cookies for 10 minutes.  I took them out of the oven when they hadn't yet cracked, and they started to crack as I was putting them on the cooling rack.  Again, from the advice of a fellow reviewer, I used 1/3 cup sugar and 1 tsp of cinnamon for the cinnamon sugar mix.  I also used pure molasses instead of dark, and it wasn't a problem.  These cookies were so chewy and tasted great, not only fresh out of the oven, but also the next day!  If you are going on a diet, don't make these cookies because it will be hard to eat only one!  :)

These were really tasty! I didn't change anything other than the bake time - 15 minutes instead of 10 so they would be crispy. I think next time, I would double the spices and maybe add some black pepper for extra spice.

Like many others I added ground cloves and nutmeg but otherwise kept to the exact recipe.  I like a crisp, not chewy ginger snap so the first batch I used my small scoop (a little over a tablespoon) and flattened the dough thin covering the dough with a piece of parchment and using the bottom of a glass.  The cookies were way too big but perfect thickness with mostly crunch but bendable with a slight chewiness...however no crackling and the cookies were quite frankly butt ugly.  Next batch same scoop, hand pressed the dough only slightly and cooked for a total of 12 minutes.  Nice crackling, slightly darker about the size of the Archway ginger cookies, still had chewiness which was really good but I wanted a crisp cookie.  First batch made 10 to a half sheet, second made 12 to a half sheet.  Last batch I divided my tablespoon scoop of dough in half, slightly hand pressed on the dough and cooked for 14 minutes.  Perfect size for a ginger snap, crisp through and through, slightly browner but not at all burnt with the nice crackle. This last batch made 2 dozen to a half sheet.  All in all I loved every cookie I made from this recipe, each for it's own benefits and although I'm not one for chewy gingersnaps, I will make the larger cookie again as the chewiness was slight and perfect for a larger cookie.  I will probably dip the bottoms of the small snaps in some bittersweet chocolate for an added twist.  Great recipe thank you!

Excellent cookie. I was worried that they would be dry since the dough seemed coarse and didn't hold together well but it wasn't a problem. I smooshed the dough into balls, rolled them in sugar and they came out beautifully.

Just made these and absolutely love them!  They look so pretty!  Didn't have a sifter, so used a whisk and worked out perfect.  Made the recipe according to recipe - only thing I did differently because a few reviews mentioned "needing a kick"...  I added some Ground Allspice to my cinnamon sugar when I rolled the cookie balls..  Was perfect, not overpowering, but just a hint of "that kick".  Will definitely make again!

I LOVE this recipe. I've been making it every year around Christmas time for a few years now. I make it as written, with the addition of about 1 tsp of ground allspice and 1 tsp vanilla. And I always get asked for the recipe :)

My 3 year old son and I made these last night. It was a really kid-friendly recipe in regards to his ability to help and the dough itself wasn't too sticky or gooey so he was able to roll cookie balls which he loved. I was also surprised at how much he loved the cookies and even the batter. I kept catching him eating it raw which, given the molasses and the ginger, I was surprised at. The cookies are not sweet and definitely have an adult flavor, but rolling them in the cinnamon sugar before baking is a great way to off-set the almost spicy nature of the cookie. I've added the recipe to my family book and will definitely make these again soon. Thinking I may pair it with a cream cheese frosting to make little cookie sandwiches as well.

Fantastic Recipe.  I actually triple sifted my dry ingredients as I only had all purpose flour on hand.  I was generous with the ginger and also added 1/4 tsp of cardamom.
Bake time was right on.  I actually tried 3 different bake times on 3 different trays of cookies; 8, 9 and 10 minutes.  This yielded a perfect range of chewy through to crunchy ... each tasting just as good as the other.
I recommend you try sandwiching the chewiest of the cookies between a spoonful of rich vanilla ice cream.  YUMMY!

We pressed it pretty flat for thin crisp cookies; we pressed them down with a buttered glass with sugar on it; and we just let be on the sheet for chewy.  We also used butter instead of shortening; added a little nutmeg, clove, and used brown sugar.  To die for!

These are delicious cookies,I make these all the time for my husband they are his favorites.I have made two slight adjustments.Richard likes the ginger, so I add 1/2 tsp. more ginger. I also do not roll them in sugar, just too sweet for us.

I like these cookies. They are far from being bland as one person said. I will make them again but with a little less ginger. A tablespoon made them a little too strong. They burned in my throat but otherwise a very good recipe.

Omnomnom, so good.  I almost ate the first batch I baked before the next sheet came out of the oven.  I followed the recipe exactly expect I used less salt because I only had salted butter, used butter instead of shortening, and added candied ginger.

Chewy, flavorful, a good balance of spice and sugar. This only produced 2 dozen cookies for me. Also, I have subbed many times "pumpkin pie spice" blend for the ginger to give a more complex spice flavor. Lastly, if you want these cookies to be non-flat, refrigerate your dough for a few hours before baking, they will still crack on top and leave you with a thicker cookie.

These are the best ginger cookies I have ever had. (Only modification I made was to add 1 teaspoon cloves) Have been searching for the perfect mix of flavour and texture and this is it. Amazing, and even my picky 15 year old daughter LOVED them.

I made this recipe today, and this is the first rating I've ever given. Grandma's Gingersnap Cookies are to Die for! I did follow the advice from April's comment and add 1tsp. cloves, just because I like a little extra spice. Other than that, follow this recipe to the letter and you will not be disappointed! These cookies are soft and chewy and flavorful. I will definitely be making these again! I am a professional baker so believe me when I say this recipe is a keeper!!! Thanks Mary Ayers for sharing, I can totally see why your family has been enjoying these since 1899.

Fantastic recipe! They expand nicely on there own (I'm use to flattening them). I use a icecream scoop and they flatten down nicely while baking! The only thing I might change next time is add a little more Molasses, I was hoping for a more molasses taste, But that's just me : )

This was a fantastic recipe and the cookies barely made it through a day. I made this recipe gluten free by substituting brown rice flour and corn starch for normal flour. (1 cup reg flour= 3/4 cup brn rice flour +1/4 cup cornstarch)

These cookies were delightful! Wonderful flavor and texture. I substituted butter for the shortening and added 1/2t cloves. The butter made them flatten out, but they were still delicious

I'm glad that I made the suggested batch size.  That initially seemed like too many cookies, but my husband keeps 'liberating' them as they cool!

I needed ginger snaps for a recipe and - oddly enough - my grocery store didn't have any.  I figured that they would be easy, and this recipe supports that.  I think we have a new favorite in the house!!

These are really good gingersnaps! I was looking for a recipe that was not as crispy all the way through as the one I have always used. I think the 350 cooking temperature helps with this as well as the ingredients. I upped the spicy factor and added 1/2 t cloves as another reviewer suggested. I also added 1 t grated fresh ginger and about 1/3 c finely chopped candied ginger to make them triple ginger snaps. This will be my go to ginger snap recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I made 2 batches.  I'm not sure what I did differently (if anything!) but they turned out so different.  One was thin and kinda chewy and the second was fluffy and kinda crisp.  Both were really good. I would definitely make them again.

Finally, a gingersnap recipe that meets my best friend's standards! To spice it up that much more I added 1/2 tsp allspice, a dash of nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp ground cloves. Yum!

This is the best recipe!  I follow it to a "t" but use Black Strap molasses which gives the cookies a darker finish that my family enjoys.  My "Chef" husband's favorite...he's hard to please:)  Highly recommended!

These were awesome!  I used salted butter instead of shortening and omitted the salt.  I also probably doubled the cinnamon.  They turned out perfectly flat & chewy- I baked them for 10-12 minutes.  I will definitely make these again next time I have the urge for ginger cookies!

I was looking for a recipe to use for a Gingerbread house and I used this. I doubled the recipe and I used butter instead of margarine(I used 1/4 less) and added 1 tsp of nutmeg. I rolled it out on parchment paper to fit my baking sheet and transferred it right to the pan. Easy cleanup and it was just the right amount for the house with just a bit leftover to make angel wings and the body of the Angel for the yard. The neighbor girls can't wait to put it  together after tasting a bite of the cookie windows I cut out! I will definately be using this recipe for more houses and other seasonal decorations!

My favorite gingersnap cookie ever! And equally fantastic as gluten free: substitute Bob's gluten free flour blend with 1/2 teaspoon xanthan or guar gum. Even gluten eaters raved over these!

LOVE this recipe!  I ate one right out of the oven and it was pure heaven.  It really does melt in your mouth.  I halved the recipe and was thinking I'd get 2-3 dozen cookies out of it but instead made a dozen and a half.  I guess that's better anyway since I really don't need that many around the house.  Will definitely be making again and again.

These cookies are so good that I made them twice in one week! I did substitute unsalted butter in place of the shortening. I also added 1 tsp of ground cloves to give a stronger flavor. They stay soft even days later!

These were easy to make and the kids loved them.  I like my gingersnaps to be alot more gingery though.  Was kind of dissapointed and I had even added more ginger than the recipe called for.  I wonder if it was because I used Blackstrap Molasses???  At any rate, I give it four stars because of the lack of ginger taste and also they were a little more chewy than I prefer my ginger snaps to be.

I use this recipe all the time!! I always use whole wheat pastry flour (bobs red mill) and I increase the ginger to almost 2T.  I also use blackstrap molasses. Best ginger cookies and I have tried so many.

My family LOVES this recipe!  I am asked to make them all the time.  They cook up perfectly and stay soft and fresh for days.  I do substitute the shortening for coconut oil or non-hydrogenated shortening but I don't change anything else and they turn out perfectly!

I just finished cooling off my ginger snaps and they turned out great!  This is particularly good news since I do most of my baking with spelt flour, as a substitute for wheat flour.  For anyone nervous about how this recipe will transfer into a spelt recipe... it's great! Thanks for posting this one.

These were very good. I made them for a friends party and she and her guests loved them! They were all gone by the end of the party. These are not like your typical molasses cookie. Not gooey but crunchy. They are a nice cookie. Good to make and wrap up as gifts.

I made 35 of these cookies last night and not a single one was left over. Easy, simple recipe with an amazing turnout. I didn't have molasses so I used sorghum instead. I also threw in some cloves and nutmeg to give it that classic gingersnap flavor like other reviewers recommended. Will definitely make these again soon!

These are delicious.  I was looking for a spicy gingersnap and chose this recipe because of the tablespoon of ginger.  However, I will have to keep tweaking to find the right spice blend; these are still very mild to me.  I used butter instead of shortening to avoid trans fats, and followed this recipe, with the addition of 1/2 tsp cloves and 1/8 tsp white pepper, based on reading some other recipes.   Not sure how to get the spicy punch I am looking for but the taste, look, and chewy consistency of these are superb.  This is my first attempt to make gingersnaps and my only complaint is that I can taste a bit of saltiness.  I used unsalted butter but may omit the salt next time - and there will be a next time :-)  Thanks for sharing this yummy treat.

Well I just made these and they turned out flat? I followed recipe but used butter instead of shortening and added a dash of cloves. They taste ok but not what I was looking for in this cookie.

These cookies turned out so well that they looked like they came from the store! How flat your cookie turns out is directly related to the temperature of your butter. If you want a flat cookie, don't chill the dough. Chilled dough gives you a ball cookie. Although both taste good, the flatter cookie looks like the more traditional gingersnap. This recipe is definitely a keeper in our house!

These were delicious! I made them just as the recipe calls for, except I added in a little nutmeg as well. I thought I would want them crispier, so I made one batch that stayed in the oven a few minutes longer than the recipe says. But, once I tasted the chewy ones, I decided I love those! This is a great recipe. I brought them home for Thanksgiving and they were a big hit. They look beautiful, and seemed to last for quite a while.

Sooooo delicious. Fresh out of the oven, they were possibly some of the best cookies I've ever eaten. We enjoyed them with vanilla ice cream.  My only change was using all butter instead of shortening. Very tasty!!

I found the recipe yummy but not enough spice, even though I added cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves. On the first recipe I also used demerara (evaporated cane juice) instead of white sugar, and whole wheat flour. I made no changes to proportions. My husband found it too sweet for a gingersnap, so the second time 'round I made the same changes as the first time, plus I reduced sweetener and used splenda for some of it (1/2 c Splenda, 1/4 c demerara). I also doubled the ginger. Still yummy, although a bit of aftertaste from the splenda (not fault of recipe!). I gave it four stars instead of five because of the sweetness and lack of punch.

Very yummy! Used golden crisco and loved the texture and slight buttery flavour. Next time will add a bit more ginger and maybe cloves to give a little more spice.

I used a pinch more ginger and added 4 min to bake time to get the snap.This time I used shortning instead of butter and got a little more height to them(not as puffy as the picture). Made these for a friend who declared "better than Archway". Thanks

These cookies are sooo good. One tip,let them cool for a ouple of minutes before moving to a cooling rack. The first sheet I removed too quickly and they slumped through the wire rack, so I had to eat them, couldn't serve bent cookies now, could we? Hubby liked them too.

wow! these remind me of gingerbread cookies, except these are SO MUCH BETTER! I used all butter instead of shortening, next time I will have a little less because they were a little greasy. I didn't have molasses at home, so I mixed brown sugar with syrup and they were SO CHEWY! I have never had cookies that soft! So from now on, I will use brown sugar+syrup. Thanks for the great recipe!

These were good but they didn't have a real spicy ginger taste that I like. I think next time I will have to increase the ginger by alot for my taste. Good overall though.

Wunderbar! This is almost my Grandma's Ginger-Molasses Cookie recipe with the exception of the tablespoon of ginger, instead of a rounded teaspoon, but she never measured any way and it was just our guesstimate from watching her!  Great blend of flavors, soft and chewy with a little crunch on the outside.  She always told us to store them in a coffee can to help keep the freshness! Also, make sure you have fresh baking soda and ginger to make sure these cookies turn out their best.  I find I have to get new ginger after 2 years!  Thank you for sharing!

Perfect melt in your mouth cookies! Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. I didn't have baking soda, so I used baking powder. I also switched the measurements for the ground ginger and cinnamon (I prefer cinnamon flavor to the ginger), and everything came out delicious with a distinct ginger taste. The only change: don't use granulated cinn/sugar mix. It made the texture too grainy for me.

I have always avoided anything with ginger in it since I have never liked the taste. Well, that has changed with these cookies!  These are awesome!  Several people at work told me they were "picky" about their Gingersnaps and the look on their faces when they bit into one was priceless.  Everyone raved and raved about them and have requested another batch; so much so that one offered to buy the ingredients if I would do the baking!

I was really impressed with this recipe!  The only change I made was to use real butter for the shortening and they were great.  There are a deep brown color and the cinnamon sugar mixture makes them sparkle!  They'll be great for my pumpkin carving party!

These turned out perfectly.  They were perfectly round, had the classic gingersnap cracks on the top, and the cinnamon sugar created a nice touch.  I serve them with pumpkin cream cheese dip.  Yum!

What a wonderful recipe this is!  I even goofed when I measured the shortening - and they were perfect.  I can't wait to make them again using the correct proportions.  These are definitely not the hard, nasty commercial gingersnaps that make many of us not like gingersnaps.  These are soft and chewy and oh-so-delicious!  Thank you for sharing.

Incredibly easy, cracked and baked perfectly. The molasis and ginger flavors were well proportioned. Sometimes one cna overpower the other. This was my first time making gingersnaps and I will definitely use this recipe again.

Amazing!!! I was lazing (and don't own a sifter) and didn't sift anything, they turned out great! They're nice and soft, the way I like them. I'll need to make another batch soon, I'm running out!

I used margarine because i ran out of butter, and doubled the ginger because i like a spicier cookie.
The cookie was very light, and crispy at the edge, but soft, almost cakelike inside. Mine didn't have a crackled top.. might have been the margarine. I was looking for a gingersnap that is crunchy all over.. but this recipe gets five stars still for it's wonderful flavour and texture.
*I tried flattening and baking the cookies for a further 5 mins, and they became crispy all the way through. Just what I was looking for! The crispier the cookie, the less strong the ginger flavor, though.

Tasted great even without the topping!  My cookies appeared darker than the photo (due to the molasses, I'm sure) although they did look just the same.  I didn't flatten the cookies before putting them in the oven which probably resulted in a puffier rather than flat cookie.

Was cleaning out the cupboard, so made mass substitutions.  Used 3/4 whole-wheat flour and 1/4 rye flour, went heavy-handed on the ginger, added a dash of cardamom, and replaced cinnamon with mixed spice.  Also subbed unsalted butter for shortening.  Used an exceptionally large egg so my relatively gluten-unfriendly flour mix would hold together just a tad better.  Results were perfect for my tastes - no crisp snap, but firm on the outside with a good crunch and moist on the inside.  Those trademark gingersnap cracks did appear on top, but weren't well-defined.  Whole-wheat flour made batter a bit gritty; fine with me, but others may want to note that.

I made these cookies for a friend last week.  I made them when I came home late one night and didn't know how they would turn out.. THEY WERE GREAT AND HE LOVED THEM.  They were very soft and full of spice, and they were very easy to make. I will be making these often.  Thank you

Wow!  These chewy spicy cookies were terrific!  I followed the recipe closely, but I added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg for more flavor.  I chilled the cookie dough overnight, and they came out soft and chewy after baking.  I took them to a church event, and everyone who tried one said they were delicious.  Even my fussy son who prefers chocolate chip cookies liked these.  He took all the leftover gingersnaps back to college with him.  Yum!

These were the first Gingersnap cookies I've ever made and they were a hit.  They turned out thin, crisp and chewy (not puffy like the photo) but they were terrific! All four kids enjoyed them and they're pretty fussy.  I will definitely make these again. Thanks for sharing!

Mine turned out like traditional ginger snaps - thin and crisp (not TOO crisp) rather than the big, soft results some other people got.  The flavor is very deep, rich, lovely.

Very good and my husband, the ginger lover, liked them too. I increased the cinnamon and added a tiny bit of cloves. Not only were they yummy but the consistency was excellent (I like a chewy cookie). They don't "snap" unless you bake them a little longer.

Perfect gingersnap cookies!  They taste great and are easy to make.  I used brown sugar instead.  I think it gives it a good flavour.

This recipe received excellent reviews from everyone who tried a cookie!  I followed the recipe to a 'T' and they turned out wonderful! Maybe I made the balls to small, but I ended up with about 60 cookies, instead of 30 like the recipes lists, but that was ok!!
Thanks for the excellent recipe!!

These cookies are mediocre... there is little flavor and the texture leaves something to be desired. I followed the recipe exactly, and although the cookies look pretty, they have very little flavor. In addition, these cookies were very brittle, whereas I expect gingersnaps to be somewhat soft.  I will have to try another recipe next time.

I saw the picture of these cookies and had to try it.  I was looking for a gingersnap recipe to make to go with a pumpkin/cream cheese dip to serve at a party and this was absolutely perfect.  Pretty and delicious!  Great recipe!

Yum! A classic gingersnap -- nice and crisp and great bite with all that ginger. I added 1/4 teaspoon of cloves for some earthy spice but otherwise, don't touch this recipe!

Excellent recipe. These are even better a day or two after baking. Just pop them in the microwave for fifteen seconds and pair with a cold glass of milk.

Delicious, thank you for sharing.  I used unsalted butter instead of shortening and used scant 1/2 tbsp of dough for each cookie.

Wow!  These are spectacular!  This was my first gingersnap cookie attempt and I will look no further for a great recipe.  I got all the ingredients together and realized that I didn't actually have ginger, so I used Pumpkin Pie spice instead.  (the second ingredient being ginger)  This added a nice depth of flavor.  I used part shortening, part butter and baked them for 8 minutes.  (I baked a "tester cookie" to find out how I like them.)  We like them a little chewy.  This is going in the recipe box!  Thanks!!!!

Excellent cookie, very similar to what I remember  many years ago.  All disappeared very quickly. Soft ginger, not too sweet.  Easy to make, I think would be a fun recipe for children and not too messy.  I will try with a little less molasses next time.

YUUUUM-EE!  These were fantastic.  They are super easy to make and they got even crunchier over the next couple days.  I have been craving these ever since I fought over the last cookie with my mom.

Thank you soooo much for sharing this recipe! These have got to be some of the best cookies I have ever had. I followed it to the letter (except that I used butter instead of shortening) and I came out with 59 cookies! Just one more and it would have been perfect. All well, thanks again for the great recipe!

I've never made gingersnpas or even had one actually. I made these cookies and they were just absolutely amazing! I think they might be my new favorite cookie. They smell soooo goooood and taste even better. I gave them to my friends and people at work and now I'm getting offers to be paid to make people their own batches! The only change I made was instead of shortening I use butter. Simply AMAZING!

These cookies are absolutely amazing!! The only thing I did differently is that I added 1 tsp ground cloves & a little freshly grated nutmeg. The recipe says to roll them into "tiny" balls and after making a couple batches I think using a teaspoon makes a perfectly small, round cookie.

Excellent flavor and texture.  I like it when cookies are chrispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, and these are.  However, the recipe didn't make 5 dozen.  You must have to make them REALLY small.  A definite keeper!

Oh my GOSH these cookies are good! You won't be disappointed with this recipe- I got crisp and chewy gingersnaps that were a huge hit with my family. I suggest baking them for a couple of minutes longer and also it helps to butter your hands lightly before handling the dough. Thanks Marie for this family favorite!!! :)

Delicious! 
- I used butter instead of margarine 
- added an extra teaspoon of ginger (my Trader Joe's ginger seemed a little weak on the ginger flavor so added more) 
- and a little cardamom (1/4 tsp) as another reviewer suggested. 
These are so good!!

Super simple, I didn't have shortening so I used oil. Also, I had to increase the cooking time to 13 minutes. But everyone loved them and I will absolutely make them again.

These ginger snaps are easy to make and super delicious.  I did modify the recipe a bit.  I don't use white sugar in anything so I opted for 1/2 c. of coconut sugar and 1 tsp. of stevia , 2 tsp. of ginger instead of 1 tbsp. and added 1/8 tsp of cloves and used 1 1/2 tsp of baking soda.  Becasue the dough was so soft, after I formed them into balls (  I omitted rolling them in sugar ) and put them on the cookie sheet, I put them in the freezer for 5 minutes while the oven was preheating.  Right from the freezer and into the oven. Baked them for 15 minutes and they turned out perfect.  Cracked nicely on the top, crispy on the outside and just a tad chewy on the inside.  Just the way we like them.  This will definetly be my forever ginger snap cookie recipe.

After reading the reviews, I decided to make a couple of changes.
I used butter instead of shortening, half brown half white sugar.
I added some fresh ginger too.
I tasted the batter after it was mixed and it was good, but didn't have much flavor, so I added another teaspoon of powdered ginger and three whole cloves (which I powdered before adding.
I ended up sifting the flour mix three times and I never caught any unmixed baking powder taste.
When I was preparing the cookies, I decided in addition to rolling them in cinnamon sugar, to dunk them in some large decorative sugar crystals. (Just to make them prettier)
I thought they tasted great and took them to several people - including our waitress that night - and got total rave reviews on them. 
Gone in less than two days and only lasted that long because I saved some for my boy friend. 
I'm making a double batch for Christmas.

I am a good baker - in fact it's part of my job as an innkeeper, but amazingly I have never made gingersnap cookies before. This was my first try and these are easy and absolutely delicious. I love that they are soft and a bit spicy, but not too spicy. This recipe will be permanently added to my Christmas Cookie baking list.

I have to eat gluten free so I substituted a cup for cup gluten free flour. They turned out perfect! I love these for being ginger snaps. Thin, crispy, and delicious. I have another ginger cookie recipe that I add diced candied ginger to buy they are thicker and stay soft. I loved this recipe just how it was listed but I may add some candied ginger in the future just for fun.

This recipe is a one in a million! The texture is soft and tasty the best I've ever had. I substituted the shortening with butter which turned out better than I thought. I'm putting these cookies into tins for my family members to enjoy!  I've never had gingersnaps this good and am definitely coming back to this recipe. I m usually not the best at baking but these cookies are easy and simple for anyone to use! Thank You!

For those who feel this recipe doesn't have enough  "snap", try adding 1/2 teaspoon of black and/or cayenne pepper.
This recipe made just enough for two cookie sheets, and I put one on the upper and one on the middle oven rack.  The cookies on the top crackled beautifully, the ones below them ended up more smooth on top.  In the future, I'll back just one tray at a time.   VERY tasty!

This is a solid and versatile recipe.  I want the soft chewy center and delicate crispness on the outside with the signature crackling on top.  These turned out perfect.

My tweaks: Butter instead of shortening, added half a tsp of cloves and pinch of nutmeg. I used half organic cane sugar, half packed brown sugar and blackstrap molasses - which makes them a little less sweet and more flavorful, my preference.  The texture is really lovely, too.

Rather than roll the balls in organic cane sugar, I just dipped the tops.  The result was gorgeous, aromatic, and decadent.  Nice crackling on top, chewy center, lightly crisp on the outside.  A very nice balance of sweet, rich molasses, and spice. We give these away to friends and neighbors at Christmas time with a bottle of homemade peppermint schnapps and good quality hot cocoa mix. A delicious combination.

Used a mix of shortening and butter (1/4 and 2/4 cup, respectively) because I was running out of shortening. Also left out the cinnamon sugar. These turned out incredible and my bf loved them. Will definitely make them again.

I used 3/4 cup of butter like the one comment and they were fantastic. Perfect balance of spice and sugar and we're still soft in the center when cool.

I've never made gingersnaps before, and this recipe looked fairly simple. I'm happy to say the cookies came out great! The only change I'd make for next time is to use 1/4 cup of cinnamon sugar instead of 1/3.

I've made these for 2 years for the holidays.  They are a great hit.  I do substitute butter for the shortening.  They are a soft moist cookie then and not a snap.

I made the recipe as directed except that I used half butter and half shortening.  The texture was great:  firm yet soft, and chewy.  Very ginger-y; they smelled great while baking.

They are very yummy. I just added 1tsp of cloves to batter and did 1/3 cup of sugar and 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon for the sugar mixture. Very good.

I only subbed shortening for margarine because it's what I had, and added a pinch of nutmeg because I like it. I really thought these turned out very good. Nice to not have to refrigerate it before hand. Wasn't sticky when rolling, but did stick to the fingertips when portioning the dough. 
I'm thinking if you like a spicier cookie, the clove suggestion is helpful. I also just used plain sugar to coat it. It made a really good, well rounded gingersnap.

Oh my goodness! I've never made gingersnaps before, but I've eaten plenty of 'em. These cookies turned out AMAZING. I've gotta bake more. These are going too quick! Everyone loves them. Thank you for passing down the recipe. Must use butter and add 1 teaspoon of ground cloves.

I used butter instead of shortening, just because. Also added in a bit of grated fresh ginger, and some diced candied ginger to give them a little extra kick. These cookies are insane good!

I used butter flavored crisco, added 1/3 cup brown sugar, only used 2 tsp ginger, 1 & 1/4 tsp allspice,  1 & 1/4 tsp cinnamon,  1 tsp cardamom, and  1 & 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I used 1 rounded teaspoon to make the dough balls and I baked them for about 11 minutes, just until the tops cracked. They came out chewy and not crunchy. They are delicious!

These are oh so yummy! Don't try and second guess the doneness at 10 mins, take them out! They will feel soft and under done but they aren't. They firm up more as they cool. Gently get them to a cooling rack asap.

This is my go-to ginger snap recipe.  Ginger snaps are long since a favorite in our family and this recipe yields the best we've found.  The one ADD-IN I sometimes use is 1/2 c. or so of diced crystallized ginger.

Add an extra 1/4 c flour, otherwise they flatten out too much. Also add 1 tsp of cloves for stronger flavour.

I absolutely love this recipe.  After I read the reviews I decided to use unsalted butter, used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar, added 1 tsp cloves, dash of nutmeg and grated some ginger root in there as well.  I love the spice of this recipe and the additions were great.  I made them small, slightly flattened them and baked for about 12 minutes.  They were the right amount of crisp and chewy!  I will make these again.

i don't know if it was because i used butter, or because i some how mixed up the recipe but the first two batches of cookies were like caramel, they were still pretty yummy,  but ya. after adding some more flour, the third batch was delicious.

Wonderful.  I did added a teaspoon of ground cloves as another reviewer recommended and that added a nice depth.  I did roll some in the cinnamon sugar, but some not.  I preferred the ones without as the cookies with the cinnamon sugar gave you a hit of cinnamon and sweet first, and the ginger had to fight it's way through, whereas without the cinnamon, you got the ginger hit right away.

Wow, I love these cookies!!! I like gingersnaps as a digestive after dinner, but I have always just bought them. After being out of my supply for a few days, I decided I would just make some...it was just too cold out to go to the store.
I followed the recipe with one exception - not having dark molasses on hand (probably ever), I substituted honey and a little brown sugar.  Everything about my result was wonderful - the appearance, the taste, the texture...they are moderately crisp on the outside and chewy inside - a massive improvement from the rock hard ones I buy and dunk in my tea, but they will not last long. Just look at these lovelies!

Changed shortening for unsalted butter & upped the ginger (1.5x recipe) cause we like ginger a lot.  Also, made my own cinnamon sugar and put a little ginger in there as well.  My cookies ended up a little on the big side....  Took a few extra minutes to cook and only ended up with 2 dozen.  But, super tasty.  Got right on that good crispy/chewy border.  :)

These have become part of my yearly goodies during Christmas.
I adjusted the amount of ginger, cinnamon and use brown sugar (instead of white in the dough).

I added more spices but they did not improve.  Too much shortening and sugar, I think.  I also tried adding more flour to the final batch.  I didn't like the texture.

Very good ginger snaps!  I used 1/2 cup coconut oil and 1/4 cup butter instead of the shortening.  Next time I’ll increase the ground ginger to 1 1/2 tablespoons since we like a little more ginger flavor.

Cookies turned out so delicious.  The only change I made was the substitution of shortening.  I used butter in place of.  Will be making them again.

My husband took his first bite and said, "these taste like they were made with love", then he proceeded to eat 6 more.  I used butter instead of shortening and added about 1/2 tsp of ground cloves and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.   I also rolled them in a clear sanding sugar instead of a cinnamon sugar.  Doesn't really snap as a gingersnap should, but it is a great ginger cookie that I will make again and again.

One recipe makes plenty to freeze some dough for later.  For me, room temp dough at 350 degrees for exactly 10 minutes is perfect! They come out soft and chewy, and taste great!

I agree with JSWAT5. These cookies had far too much ginger. I never dip gingersnaps in sugar and cinnamon mix, but thought I would give it a try as the recipe says. It was awful. I will stick with my mom’s tried and true gingersnaps recipe.

Made these tonight and I have never tasted a gingersnap cookie but, I must say, these came out excellent. We also made pumpkin dip (this site) to go with them and that just upped the ante on these. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I have made this recipe several times.  Extremely good cookies.  I bring cookies to work 2-3 times a month for my staff and these are their favorite.  
I have tried both shortening and butter but prefer the butter route.
I am thinking I am going to try to substitute some flour with oatmeal next time to make them a little puffier.

First of all, thank you for this recipe.  I love old recipes. They are awesome! I did add the rind of a lemon and it complemented the ginger. Next time I will try using the rind of an orange. Other than the above I followed the recipe exactly. Will definitely be adding this to my recipe book.

I made this recipe with butter instead of shortening (bc I was crunched for time with no shortening on hand) and used 1/4 cinnamon sugar instead of a 1/3. The cookies came out great! I would definitely use this recipe again!

Superb recipe. A major hit with all! Absolutely delicious! Have happily added it to my repertoire.

I made this recipe, substituting golden syrup for molasses and adding allspice and nutmeg to the ginger and cinnamon.

I recommend cooking half the cookies as per the recipe (10 minutes) for those who like chewy in the centre cookies. The other half I cooked until dark and crunchy all the way through. Yum yum yum. All gone two days later. Another batch will be made tomorrow. 

Thanks Grandma and descendents. Guess  you really do know best!

Absolutely amazing! I used butter instead of shortening. I used a 1 TBSP measuring spoon to scoop out the dough ( and levelled flat) to make into 1 inch size balls.  10 mins in the oven was perfect :) Thank you for the recipe! My husband and I loved them!

I made this recipe as written, but instead of rolling the dough into small balls, I spooned the mixture onto greased baking trays (although the recipe says they should be ungreased) and flattened each one by hand only because I prefer crunchy biscuits rather than soft chewy ones. I am very glad I greased the trays. It is suggested they be cooked for about 10 minutes. I found they needed about 14 mins at least, and then checking  every 2 mins after that until they reached the right look and colour. I would put in a little less cinnamon next time because I found it a bit overpowering. Cinnamon sugar can be made using a 1:4 ratio - 1 tsp of cinnamon to 4 tsp of sugar. My preference would be 1:5. Also 3/4c shortening is the equivalent of 150 grams.

Pretty decent recipe.
I basically cut all the ingredients in half, and didn't use molasses, and they still turned out to be decent cookies haha

Really yummy. I’ve never made ginger cookies before. I filled the recipe and used a metal mesh strainer to sift all the ingredients. Will make these again.

I made these as a base for my Carmel ginger chocolate bars and they are perfect.  I over baked them for a more crispy cookie, the ginger came through really well and is strong enough to not disappear in the final bar product.  This cookie would make a wonderful crust for my ginger pecan cheesecake too.  It’s a keeper.

These are sooo good!!  Absolutely delicious.  I didn't have shortening so instead I used the same quantity of butter, and I followed one of the other commentator's suggestions of mixing 1/3 cup sugar with 1 1/2tsp of cinnamon, and it was perfect!!  This recipe will be going in my recipe book!

This is a recipe that is the closest to what my grandmother used to make when I was a child and loved.  Easy to make and delicious.  I like that they are a bit bland and not too spicy as many ginger cookies are.  They bring happy memories of childhood to me with every bite. I couldn't stop eating them and had to share them with my neighbors so I wouldn't eat the whole batch.  Everyone loved them and begged for more.

Great recipe. These cookies are really phenomenal.  I did sift the flour but  you can get by without doing it.   I didn't have shortening so I used all butter.  Someone mentioned that there was no ''snap'' in these cookies but that's fine because I prefer chewy cookies. However, if you want the ''snap'' just bake them a minute or two longer.  But beware:  You can turn  perfectly done cookies into doorstops if you don't watch them closely.

I added 1to2 teaspoons fresh minced ginger and decreased the dried ginger to 1 teaspoon. The flavor was superb. But, the baking soda after taste was too powerful. I’ll make these again and decrease the baking soda by half and see what happens.

These are wonderful! My cookies were flat, didn’t have the poof I’m used to on other gingersnap recipes. I think it may have been because my dough was soft, probably should have refrigerated it a bit. The flavor was excellent, nice ginger kick, my new fav!! I like the idea of rolling the dough In cinnamon sugar, genius!

My cookies smelled and tasted delicious - the only downside is that they were flat. When I make again, I think I'll follow advice of other contributors and use butter in lieu of shortening and add additional flour for a puffier cookie. I noticed that mine took longer than ten minutes to back. The recipe did not say anything about holding on cookie sheet for additional minutes - so I increased baking time to 11 - 12 minutes because at 10 minutes mine were too soft to remove from tray.

These were legit delicious. I was a bit nervous that my dough was too dry in spite of the fact that I followed the recipe exactly. I added a touch of water while kneading at the end. The cookies came out very well and stayed chewy and lovely! They have a nice ginger bite. I'd make these again in a heartbeat!

Perfect gingersnap!! I am saving this recipe in my Christmas cookie book. The only change I made was to add 1/4 tsp. of cloves, sub butter for  shortening and to flatten the cookies with a glass before baking.

Being from South Louisana, we like things spicy and I read the label on Stoffer's Brand and their Ginger Snap recipe contains ''ground cayenne pepper'' which, like molasses--another Cajun Louisiana product, are both tastes of home for me. So if you want to kick these cookies up a notch in spiciness try 1/8 t. to-1/4 t. of red cayenne pepper and you will have them spicy as Stoffer's but homemade ...I also added 1 T. softened butter to the creamed shortening for a more buttery flavor as our niece gives us a can of European Ginger snaps at Christmas, annually,made with butter... we

As always when I first try a recipe, I make it pretty much as called for.  The only thing I did different, was just to drop teaspoon fulls of dough on the cookie sheet, and sprinkled a few grains of sugar on top.  These cookies came out amazing!  So delicious!

I guess what defines a good gingersnap cookie varies person by person but for me I prefer them to be a little bit thicker with a crisp outside and chewy inside. I followed the recipe exactly, the only thing I added was some cloves for a little extra ‘snap’. The first batch that came out of the oven was very flat and crunchy. If that is how you like your gingersnap cookies then you’ll like this recipe how it’s written. From then on I put the cookie trays in the freezer for 10 minutes before baking and while the cookies still flattened more than I like, the tops crackled better and they weren’t as crunchy as the first batch

Delicious! Baked but on the soft side with the current temp. At 375° it is the hardness we were looking for to serve with pumpkin pie dip.

My whole family loved this recipe and I was asked to make it again soon! I just added 1/2 tsp of cream of tartar because we don't like crispy cookies, other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Very yummy!

The quantities don't seem close to being correct. Particularly the amount of flour. Too sticky and hard to roll in to balls.

Great recipe and tastes amazing. I also substituted butter for the shortening. worked great. Made the cookies with my 14 year old daughter, so it was that much more rewarding. A little on the sweet side for me. Less sugar next time.

The perfect ginger cookie. I didn't want a strong,heavy flavored cookie & these were just what I wanted. Not sure if they are a true gingersnap but I loved them and will make them again  and again.

These cookies turned out great & tasted wonderful, but the measurements in the original recipe were ALL OVER the place!   Lots of adjustments ! needed about 1/2 cup more flour just to get the batter to stick together.... but was still not able to roll out the dough (too sticky!).  However did drop batter by heaping teaspoons onto the baking sheet, and then sprinkled with the cinnamon sugar.   Must watch the baking time, since quite easy to burn if left even 1 minute too long!   Will try again since the flavour was really amazing !

I used coconut sugar instead of white sugar and the only difference is that the cookies are darker in appearance. I also added a little bit of cloves. These are delicious! I will definitely be making them again!

This is a fantastic cookie, but I did listen to some of the other comments and tweaked it a little adding 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper and 1 heaping tablespoon chopped candied ginger.  I baked 12 minutes at 325 convection (my range automatically sets temp back 25 degrees when you use convection and for cookies I allow it).  

Excellent. A little crisp, a little chewy. Next time I'll use 1.5 teaspoons black pepper and at least 2 heaping tablespoons chopped candied ginger - they had a kick, but still could have had more!

After countless years using my Grandma's gingersnap recipe I lost the recipe in a move. I was frantic. I skimmed through countless gingersnap recipes until I saw this one and thought the ingredients were very similar to what I remembered on my Grandma's recipe. So I made this. You know what? This was better! I had so many compliments. People really thought I had used fresh ginger in the recipe. This is now my go to Ginger snap recipe!

Absolutely loved these ginger cookies. They came out so moist and chewy with a strong ginger bite.   I really couldn't taste the ginger much in the raw dough (I taste my dough before I bake the first batch) but it definitely came forward after cooking. These are my new go-to ginger cookies.

These cookies are delicious!  Made them exactly as the recipe is written except didn't roll in sugar (don't like the gritty feel of sugar).  We've made 3 double batches in 2 weeks and still can't get enough of them.  Delicious with coffee!

Turned out more chewy than I expected but they were still good! Not too sweet, just right. I also used 2 tbsp of fresh ginger to add more ginger flavor. I like these with more of a kick so I might add more in the future.

I'll definitely make these again!

Wow...looks like I must have done something wrong since it is such a high rated recipe! My cookies didn't rise at all and I took them out at 8 minutes as suggested to get a chewy inside - so they were flat and underdone. I didn't melt the shortening as many people suggested was unnecessary and otherwise followed the recipe to a t. Not sure what the problem was but was very disappointed....

To give more of a Snap, I added graded ginger root and fine chopped candied ginger to the mix.

I made this cookie for the fist time last Thursday and since then I have made over three more batches. This is maybe my favorite cookie recipie. I did use butter in stead of the shortening but it turned out amazing! I also added cloves which to me made it all the better! I will make these cookies every Holiday and also all year round. 100% amazing for me it's a MUST try for the season.

These are literally the BEST ginger snaps. They're crunch around the edges and soft in the middle. I omit the cinnamon sugar on the outside because we prefer them more spicy and less sweet. This is the recipe I'll be passing down to my children one day.

Before I made these I read the reviews, and decided to add a teaspoon of cloves because like most my family loves that little extra bite to our gingersnap's... With that addition they were a hit. I loved the idea of double sifting, and adding the cinnamon to the sugar to coat them. Would have given 5 stars if the cloves were already in the recipe...

Oh man!! I am a ginger snap finatic, and this recipe is the absolute best I've had. I left the cookies in about 3-4 extra minutes to get the "snap". Also added just a pinch of baking powder along with the soda to get a little rise then while they're baking, then popped the pan up to flatten while in the oven. Came out perfect! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, this will be my go-to every holiday. Love!

I'm sure butter would have worked much better, and the amount of ginger was overwhelming. I think a touch more baking soda would have helped with appearance and texture, and butter and cinnamon would have covered the flavor of the soda.

These  are the best things I have ever eaten in my life! Absolutely wonderful! Wish I could give them 6 stars! The only thing in the recipe I changed was that I sprinkled on some cinnamon sugar just after I took them out of the oven. Seriously the best! Gave some to my friends and family and they are all begging for the recipe! I could not be more pleased!

Yummy! No changes required, but I did reduce the oil by 1/3 , added a couple of tsp water, and subbed jaggery for half the sugar in my second batch. Great-smelling gingersnaps either way, crisp outside and chewy inside, simply delicious!

Made just how it was written, but used butter flavored Crisco I've always been a Ginger Snap Lover, but these are really good. A keeper recipe.  I even made a boo boo. I like to freeze cookie dough for quick cooking when you are in the mood. Well, I got these all packaged up and thought they looked light. I  forgot the Molasses. So I had to put everything back in the bowl and add the Molasses and they still turned out fantastic. Nice and chewy. Great with Milk.

No need to change a thing! It just doesn't get much better than this! I agree with another reviewer and rolled in 1/3 cup sugar and 1-1/2 tsp. cinnamon.

Made as directed and came out AMAZING! My husband used to think that he did not like gingersnaps due to how hard previous ones he had were. These cookies come out wonderfully soft on the inside, so for those who like SNAP of a gingersnap, you may need to flatten the dough a bit before baking. Otherwise, these cookies come out as rounded, soft, deliciousness for any time of the year (my husband begs me to make these even in the Summer...)!

GREAT Cookie!! I was not sure what to expect but the reviews made me want to try it and it was so delicious. The only thing I did differently was instead of regular shortening, I used butter flavored shortening..... So much flavor in this cookie. 
Will surely be making this again come the fall..

Loved this recipe. it was a big hit, even with the kids. I wanted thinner cookies to use to make ice cream sandwich cookies (with lemon frozen custard), so I used 50% butter/ 50% shortening. I also added about 50% more ginger.  If you like really spicy gingersnaps, then you may want to add even more than that. Great recipe! will be making them again.

Wonderful cookies!  I had only 1 stick butter on hand, so I ended up using 1/2C butter + 1/4C butter-flavored Crisco.  I also added 1 Tbsp Pumpkin Spice to charge up the flavor, as some others did (I didn't have separate cloves or nutmeg).  I also made them big using a cookie scoop.  This recipe made 18 large cookies, which baked for 15-16 minutes.   I made these as I am just getting over food poisoning, and I had already eaten the box supermarket Ginger Snaps that a friend brought me when I was too ill to move, let alone go out!  Now that I can move around better, I made these to continue to calm my tummy.  They fit the bill perfectly!

These are my husbands favorite cookies and these come as close to what his grandmother used to make when he was a boy.  I can't make them fast enough or make enough at one time.  I never double the recipe I always make two separate batches.  They always come out with perfect flavor and texture.

I replaced the shorting with butter, much better! Love them! They remind me of Granny's cookies!

Just fantastic. Crisp like he likes them if sealed up tight and chewy like I like them if left out. Definitely a keeper recipe. Can't wait to try them crumbled as a cheesecake crust! Thanks for sharing!

Excellent texture but too little ginger and too much baking soda. I'll try them again and double the ginger. Don't make them any bigger than one in diameter or you'll need to increase baking time by a few min.

I used butter instead of shortening and half honey half brown sugar instead of dark molasses. Great flavour. I think cloves and some nutmeg could add a kick to this.

LOVE these cookies. Traditionally my family makes Polish 'pierniczki' for the holidays, so I was instantly yelled at for trying something different. However, once these cookies were done everyone ate them in a matter of minutes. Absolutely delicious. It's a new family favorite.

Edit: I forgot to mention I made these using gluten-free flour (equal amount to regular flour),2 tsp of xantham gum and I used butter instead of shortening.

Perfect. I prefer softer ginger cookies than crunchy "snappy" ones. These are so good with a cup of tea...

I've tried other recipes. This one is perfect! I added 1/2t ground cloves because I like the added flavor. On rolling the moist dough... I used two teaspoons and dropped them into the bowl of cinnamon sugar then used a fork to gently roll them around and lift them onto the cookie sheet. The fork allowed excess sugar to fall off. There was no other way to roll these without making a complete mess. Also, I tried making bigger cookies, but it's just not the best way with this recipe - stick with the small ones.  My cinnamon sugar mix was 1/3 cup sugar with 1 tablespoon cinnamon.

I followed recipe as listed (except substituted butter for shortening) and made the cinnamon sugar as suggested by another reviewer (1 1/2 teaspoons mixed with 1/3 cup sugar). Entire family loves. It's a keeper.

I loved these cookies.  I doubled the recipe because I was making them for a cookie exchange at the office.  I made them exactly as the recipe read and it yielded 54 cookies at about 3 inches in diameter.  I had just enough for the exchange so I hadn’t even sample one before bringing them into the office.  The next day, my colleagues raved about them.  I was told that it had just the right amount of spice in it.  I used a one tablespoon cookie scoop to drop them, this way they would all be consistent in size.  They do spread out, so plan on dropping them according to the size of your baking sheet.  I had dropped six per regular sized cookie sheet.  The next time I will bake them using a smaller scoop to see which size I prefer.  A keeper in my cookie repertoire.

Great basic recipe. I used butter instead of shortening and added a dash of ground cloves, nunutmeg, some candied ginger and fresh grated ginger to give them that special snap.  They were a big hit with the family!

I love these cookies--I use Chinese ginger and may put in a little more than 1 tbsp because we like ours to have a bite.  I use shortening because I like them "fluffy".

I put in 2 Tbsp cinnamon (we are huge fans of cinnamon) and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg. These are REALLY excellent, soft-ish ginger/molasses cookies. They are even fabulous when made with a sugar substitute (I tried it with Splenda for baking and Truvia and both worked well)--no one noticed the substitute thanks to the strong flavor of the spices and molasses.

Amazing!!  I only dipped the tops of the cookies in the cinnamon/sugar mix though because I find the bottom of the cookies tend to burn if I roll the whole thing in it.  Make these all the time!  I use whole wheat flour and they turn out just fine!

Delicious flavor. Used Penzeys's Tung Hing Cinnamon and added 1/8 t + ground cardamom for extra zing. Crispy and chewy. My grandmother has always told me to use Brer Rabbit molasses for good flavor.

I've never made gingersnaps before but will certainly be making these again. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using half shortening and half butter. These cookies are delicious and so easy to make! 10 minutes in the oven yields a crispy edge and chewy center, while 14 minutes yields more traditional "snap".

They are yummy but I do think butter might give them just a little more richness to the flavour, so will try that next time.

I made these exactly as they're listed, and they were AMAZING. I was concerned that the ginger flavor wasn't too prominent in the dough, but once I rolled it in the cinnamon sugar and baked it, the ginger flavor really came out.

The review complaining about tasting the ginger actually made me decide to use the recipe... because, you know, they're GINGER snaps. Perfect.

I used butter instead of shortening and added 1 teaspoon of Nutmeg. They turned out delicious and were super easy to make. I buttered the baking pan for easy cleanup, but two of the cookies rolled off while I was putting them in the oven! I had to let it cool down and capture the runaways before I could bake them!

My daughter came home and said that at school they had ginger snaps and she loved them. So I went on here and started making them. Now every year from November to December I make these cookies. I've been doing this since 2012. Everyone loves them and they are the best!

You should avoid making these cookies at 11:30 at night.  You will likely eat them all before you go to bed.

Didn't find the mollasses to I used real honey and a bit of maple syrup instead. Used butter and shortering for the 3/4 C. They actually grow quite a bit so its important to keep them separated about and inch every side. Tasted amazing!! This recipe makes a lot of cookies, may be nice to just do half of it if you only want a taste... Make it!

These are very good!  I did use butter instead of shortening and flattened the cookies out a bit with a glass before baking.  Better than store bought!  Thanks for sharing.

These are wonderful cookies. I was craving my grandmothers ginger snaps and these taste almost like hers. The only change I made was substitute butter for the shortening. Very easy to make. I will be making theses again. They are great with a hot cup of tea in the afternoon.

They had good flavor, but first batch were too soft, did not have enough "snap" to be ginger snaps, so I added a couple minutes to the second batch. Flattening them down a little before putting them in the oven might also be a good idea. Also, the double sifting of the dry ingredients, first into a small bowl, and then again when adding them to the wet ingredients was completely unnecessary, one sift is enough. Will probably replace the shortening with butter the next time I make these.

MmmmmMmm Holy mother of pearl! Made these for a friends birthday ~ first time baking gingersnaps. She fondly recalled a version that included fresh, candied ginger. I found cubed, candied ginger at Market Street and bought just about $2 worth. Scooping it into a small container, you get crystalized ginger sugar. I chopped it finely and added it to taste and used the crystals instead of ground ginger. Sooo fresh and aromatic! After reading other reviews, I also used butter instead of shortening. They are SO DARN GOOD I can't wait to add them to my Holiday Cookie rotation.

Made these today. Very very good! Soft on the inside and a little crispy on the out. The only thing I would do differently is add a little more ginger as they were not quite "gingery" enuff for me. But very good as is.

Except that I made 1 1/2 the recipe and only got 5 3/4 dozen cookies, so no way for 5 dozen unless they are miniscule (and what fun is that? ;).  Also, for the more health conscious - I used half butter and half coconut oil (hopefully no one still uses killer Crisco!), and 100% whole wheat flour and they were excellent.  Might even try them gluten-free next time, as so many people are going that route these days.

This recipe was great! The only thing about it was there was too much sugar. I could barely taste the ginger because of the overpowering cinnamon sugar. Next time I make this recipe I will not add any cinnamon sugar on top.

It's a good basic recipe.  The third time I made this recipe, I trebled the amount of ground ginger, which probably has more to do with chain grocery story sources than anything.  I also chopped candied ginger into small pieces and incorporated that into the flour mixture...adds incredible texture and taste!  Lastly, I used raw sugar to roll the cookie-balls in before baking.

By far, the BEST ginger snap I have ever eaten.  Better than my own grandma's! The only thing I did differently was use butter instead of shortening (I don't cook with shortening, ever) and for the ginger I used half ground ginger and half fresh ginger paste, then added a bit extra because I wanted a nice spicy cookie.  These are just amazing- somehow crisp and chewy at the same time.  Perfectly light.  The flavor is so good.  I used a bit of a coarse sea salt and wasn't sure if that would matter but they came out with a sweet and salty, spicy, buttery flavor that is simply addictive.  I will be making these next Christmas, if not before.  Gave them out in green mason jars this year and they were a hit!

Wonderful recipe! I think my cookies were a little too big, so they came out a little raw in the center but the wonderful flavor made up for it. Definitely a keeper.

A great base recipe. I used margarine instead of shortening, and added 1/4 tsp ground cloves at the suggestion of another reviewer. Very yummy.

These are amazing cookies!!  My husband and I loved them!!  I used butter in place of shortening as other reviewers suggested and chilled the dough to make it easier to work with.  Was easy and yummy.

I made this with butter.  Came out great!  I also added 1/8 tsp. ground cloves and 1/4 cup chopped candied ginger.  I think the candied ginger made the difference and made the cookies have more ginger "zing."  Definitely a winner.  Lovely crisp cookies.

These cookies were actually amazing! I cut the recipe in half. I used fancy molasses.. my batter wasnt as dark as i wanted so i added an extra 2tbsp. This made the batter soft and didnt turn into a dough. So i just dropped the cookies with a small scoop. The cookies turned out flat but i love them like that! They are absolutely delicious! the perfect amount of flavor!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Was a good cookie, a little softer than my husband prefers and not quite enough ginger for us.  Will be making these again and tripling the ginger. (we like extra gingery ginger snaps).  They are good enough that I may just make that second batch tonight!

Pleasant cookie but as another user said, too much soda tastes very much of soda. If I try again I would halve the soda.

Wonderful taste treats!  These cookies are easy to make, quick to prepare and look and taste great.  I discovered this recipe last fall and have baked quite a number of batches since then. I've followed the recipe just as printed and have had the same good results each time.  When the cookies are shared with others, the usual response is "you made these? They aren't purchased at the bakery?"

These are my go-to ginger cookie recipe.  They are spicy enough to satisfy adult palates but my grandchildren like them too. I like to add a few Tablespoons of diced, candied ginger bits for a bit more ginger kick. I would agree that these don't have a "snap" texture - they are a bit chewier than that traditional ginger snap but I love them just they way they are.

I used butter instead of margarine and like why my cookies were pretty flat. The flavor was good and the cookies were nice and soft - love the soft cookie!  Others said crisp so not sure of the difference. I will make these again!  First time that my kids tried gingersnaps and they loved them!

The only thing I changed was the shortening. I used butter in its place. I followed all the directions in this recipe and it came out beautifully. Easily the best cookies I've made. I'm keeping this recipe and if I need to make more in the future, I'm definitely using this one.

I substituted Land O Lakes Butter in place of the shortening and added 1 tsp of Cloves and 1/4 tsp of Nutmeg to the recipe. Rave reviews with a 4 and 12 yr old boy.

These are simple to make and delicious. I even skip the sifting and blend the dry ingredients in my KitchenAid Stand Mixer.  I substitute non-hydrogenated shortening and they turn out beautifully. They don't last long in our house:)

Loved these cookies!!  I used a vegan butter spread in place of the shortening and they turned out fantastic.  My husband loved them.  I also added 1/4 tsp of cloves per other reviews but I probably could have added more.  They don't have a huge bit to them but they still taste delicious.

I made 1/2 recipe.. The dough was too sticky I had to add 3 tbsp. flour and refrigerate dough poss. because I couldn't do 1/2 egg. I added 1 cApful rum. (CAp not CUp)I added 1/4 teaspoon cloves. I baked at 375 high altitude (13-16 min)
I had enough for two cookie sheets batches.
1) 1st Batch: Gingerbread Cookies..No Snap!
2) 2nd Batch: I added a sprinkle more ginger and cloves. This is one half recipe, so a "pinch" each. Then I added Hot Chile  which I keep in a small shaker, clearly labeled. I live in the South west. This is genuine Hot Chile. If you use this chili, you know what a sprinkle or "to taste" means. Add that much.  Now these cookies Snap!
If you like Snap and have Hot Chili, add a sprinkle or two. That will add snap to the cookies, guaranteed!
I will make these cookies again..Ginger Snap with a Snap!

This recipe makes a great crispy-chewy ginger cookie! I made it exactly as the recipe says and then added 1 tsp of cloves as recommended by another reviewer because I, too, like a spicy cookie. Great suggestion! With my last batch, I decided to try adding some raisins to the dough, and I have to say that I think this batch is the absolute best. Thank you for sharing this delicious cookie!

This is a very flavorful cookie but it is not a snap.  The center was chewy; I was looking for a cookie with a crunch.  The person who I made them for thought they were delicious, but she was expecting a crunch too.  BTW, I made it as written.

I used organic REAL butter, half white flour and half whole wheat flour and organic sugar and organic molasses.  I think they're much too sweet and too chewy.  I'd prefer this type of cookie be crunchy.  I recommend less sugar and cooking them at 325 for 15 minutes.

These are amazing.  I have a little trouble getting the cookies to not come out as small, flat pancakes, but chilling the dough seems to help.  Also, no one complains because they taste just like a gingersnap should!  I've also made them gluten-free with Pamela's baking mix.  Tip:  Add 150% of the normal amount of flour when substituting.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic cookies. I've never made ginger snaps before but these were easy. Added extra cinnamon, grated fresh ginger, 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Will try cardamom/black pepper next time but these are wonderful as written.

Recipe was for a good chewy cookie.  I didn't taste much ginger but mine had been in the pantry a while.  My daughter (who doesn't like ginger) loved these cookies she couldn't stop eating them.  They aren't like the hard crunchy cookie you get in the box.  I like the soft ones better but I would have liked it with a little more spice.

Pretty good and not too difficult to make.  Not sure if all that sifting is necessary though.  Not too gingery and more chewy than snappy.  Will make again.

These are the best cookies I have ever eaten. I have made them twice now and no only do I love them but my guests raved about them. I did use unsalted butter instead of shortening and they came out chewy and delicious. I also served them with a pumpkin dip which consists of half a can of pumpkin purée, 3/4 cup confectioners sugar, 4oz whipped cream cheese and 3/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. Absolutely wonderful. Thanks for the recipe!!!

These cookies are outstanding!! I've  never made gingersnap or molasses cookies before but had a craving for them, and this recipe looked very good.  I used butter instead of the shortening only because that is what I had on hand. I also added about a quarter tsp of nutmeg. I found I only needed to bake for 8 minutes to get that perfect crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside texture. YUMMY!!!

Excellent cookie... made pretty much as directed. Did add a little allspice, maybe a teaspoon and then rolled just in white sugar rather than cin-sugar. Came out perfect.

My kids were unsure about these cookies but they are now my 6 year old son's favorite! They're moist and they have great flavor! I did substitute the shortening for butter since it just sounded healthier and they still turned out great.

My good old gingersnap recipe called for a teaspoon ginger, 1/4 t. cloves and 1 cup brown sugar.  The brown sugar makes a darker cookie.  I added the tablespoon of ginger, cloves & half brown, half white sugar.  They look great and are delicious.  This is a good recipe to adjust to your taste with the spices.

These really are great.  And very easy to make.  I took some other reviewer's suggestion and sifted a teaspoon of cloves with the flour mixture.  These will soon be on their way to my soldier in Afghanistan for Christmas!

Great flavor and texture! I was surprised at how much they spread out, but it's been a while since I've made or eaten gingersnaps. Only a few minor alterations: used butter instead of shortening; added 1/4 tsp each of cloves and nutmeg. They stay chewy for days after!------2nd time around: The dough is too soft to really roll into balls, and I found it wasn't even necessary if you don't mind forgoing the extra sugar coating. I dropped tspfuls and they still rounded out perfectly.

These were a huge hit!  Everyone loved them.  They did come out very flat, but like a store bought gingersnap would be.  When I make them again I will make them from smaller balls because they do spread and flatten so much.   Used 1/4 cup of sugar with 1 tbsp of cinnamon for the topping and that was the perfect amount.

Really liked how it turned out light and crispy. I forgot to sift it a second time, but it worked ok. Felt the ginger flavour was too weak, and I would defintely also add clove powder. I added some mace powder, and thought it worked nicely.

Very good cookie with awesome spicing. It wasn't as crispy as I was expecting though, a little soft for me. This would have been a 5 star recipe with that extra crisp. Maybe an extra couple of minutes of baking would achieve that.

These. Are. Awesome. I made them for a bake sale and even little chocolate fiends liked them. They are soft, flavorful and BEAUTIFUL. They end up looking like they should be in a magazine spread. I used butter like some of the other reviewers and they turned out perfectly.

I loved these! Perfect every time. I subbed 1/4 cup brown sugar and a dash of cream of tartar for the molasses and they were still great! Such a nice change from chocolate chip! I love that they are rolled in cinn/sugar.

I have never made gingersnap cookies before, really I am new to baking all together.  But these turned out so good!!  I made 3 different batches and gave them to family and friends.  They all loved them!  Excellent recipe!  So soft, and chewy!  Highly reccomend!  But make sure you take out of the oven when its says, because I burned my first couple, my fault.

Excellent cookie!!  This is the first time I made gingersnaps.  I was looking for a chewy, flavorful, spicy cookie, and my search is now over!!  I did make the following changes:  added 1 tsp ground cloves, added 1/4 cup more flour and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening (butter flavor--what I had on hand) and this turned out wonderful gingersnaps.  The cookies came out flatter than I wanted, but doesn't take away from how good it taste.  Next time, I think I'll try the complete butter and add more flour to lessen the flat results.

Awesome!!  Would give this recipe more than 5 stars if I could.  I was doing some Christmas baking since here in Western Iowa we are stranded in an ice storm.  Stayed up late to bake before we lose our power.  These were well worth it.  I love gingersnaps, but have struggled to find a great recipe.  These remind me of my grandma's.  She always filled her house with cookies and candies at Christmas time.  Thanks for sharing it!

First off.. i didn't sift any of my ingredients.  I don't own a sifter... i suppose i should buy one.  That said, when i made these the first time my husband had a bad cold and couldn't taste anything.  He LOVED the texture of these cookies, even without sifting.  Once he could taste food again he ate more, and love those too!  They smell wonderful but get dark if you don't watch them closely.  This is a great cookie :D

These came out nice. I followed a user's suggestion, substituted 1/4 cup of the shortening with real butter. In addition, I refrigerated the dough and it formed up nicely into balls and baked up soft and delicious. (I cooked them at 300 in my convection oven for 11 mins).

I personally can't stand gingersnaps but decided to make these for my dad since he loves them.  They ended up quite thin but nice and chewy with a slightly crispy edge.

THESE WERE AWESOME! I also made them with butter. I baked them the full 12 minutes and they were perfectly crispy. Best Gingersnap recipe I've ever made. I like to think of myself as a cookie snob (I love cookies and bake a half dozen or so several times a week) as they are my favorite dessert.

I can't believe it, I finally found MY Grandma's Gingersnap recipe!  My grandma taught me this recipe when I was about 10.  My recipe box was stolen in 1999, and I have yet to replace some of the recipes.  Judging my the comment about 1899, our Grandmas must have been about the same age!

Oh my I made these cookies today and my husband loved them. Gingersnaps are his favorite and these were so easy. I baked them for 8-9 minutes. This will be my gingersnap cookie recipe from now on.

I made these today for the 1st time and used lard instead of shortening and they were perfect!  The centres are chewey if you cook them for 10 mins but I'm sure I could 'snap them up' a bit more by adding 3 to 5 more minutes in the oven.

What a great recipe- the house smells wonderful, they look pretty, and they have an awesome taste.  My 3 year old neice is here, and I gave her two when they came out of the oven. I could hear her sitting at the table going m-m-m-m when she was eating them. She brought me her plate, and when I told her to put it in the dishwasher, she said "I think I need more."  After sampling one myself, I have to agree, I think I need more too. lol. So I am making myself a cup of tea and am going to sit down and savor some of these. I would love to know how they taste after they have had a couple of days for the flavors to mellow, but I am sure they will be gone when the kids get home from school.  Great recipe! Thanks so much for sharing this family treasure.

Great recipe. I followed the recipe to the letter, however I did substitute butter for shortening. They turned out fantastic!  Next time, I think I would add a little more cinnamon and a little less ginger, because I prefer a more cinnamon-y taste. Overall, a fantastic recipe, and super easy to make!

I followed this recipe with exactness, and they came out a lot flatter than a lot of the pictures.  They are fine for a gingersnap, but I think I prefer "big soft ginger cookies" to these.

Great flavor, but mine turned out flat after using butter instead of shortening.  Next time I'll try the shortening as written.  I read that gingersnaps help with morning sickness, so I am eating my fair share!

I've tried store-bought gingersnaps and they're o.k.  But when I made these for my kids and my mom, WE will not buy another store-bought gingersnap.  DELICIOUS!!!

Unbelievably good.  They disappeared in no time.  I served them as a dessert on Christmas Eve with a little dish of cool whip for people to dollop on if they so desired... the combination and the cookies were a hit!  (Note:  I substituted butter for the shortening, but made no changes other than that.)

I too used butter for these, my niece who was helping also dropped them back into the cinnamon sugar after baking just to give them that extra sugariness. All who tried them over Christmas loved them so will definitely make again.

A friend of mine gave me this recipe with a little added treat after you bake them.  Melt a package of white chocolate chips and approx. 2 tbls. butter and dip just half the cooled cookie in the melted chips and let cool on a piece of wax paper. Compliments the flavor of the cookie. Very addicting!

Best Ginger snaps I've ever had. In the last few years, I have made many different recipes for these cookies but these were by far the best. They came out perfect. I followed the exact recipe the only thing I added was a pinch of ground cloves to give them some spice. GREAT RECIPE!!! THANK YOU!!!

These cookies lacked enough ginger flavor for me, more of a molasses chew.  They seemed to need more cooking time than 10 minutes to really get a crispy cookie.  They were not bad, but certainly not the best.  I prefer the recipe for
Ginger Snap Cookies
SUBMITTED BY: Kathleen Dickerson 
They definitely have bite.

I always feel the need to bake when I'm at home from college and my father ADORES these cookies. His grandmother used to make them when he was a child, and he said that these are almost exactly the same. I make them smaller, so they are bite sized and crispy... I get almost 5 dozen out of this recipe. Family favorite that is in the cook book now. Thanks!

These were delicious!  I was craving gingersnaps, and tried this recipe, and was not disappointed.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't bother with sifting the dry ingredients.  They turned out perfect!

Wonderful recipe. Worth the "extra" work of all the sifting back and forth. I will definitely make this again. And, I have never liked gingersnap cookies before these. Thanks...

Taste is wonderful.  Cookies came out a little flat and if baked too long made great gingersnap like cookies, nice and crisp.  The soft cookies were prone to harden when left out too long, also.  Put away quickly in a container.  We will enjoy, but I'll keep looking for a thicker softer cookie.  Thanks for the good recipe.

Oh my!  These really are the best gingersnap cookies I've ever tasted.  I followed the recipe with one addition..a little grated fresh nutmeg.  Used the pampered chef small scoop to measure and just 8 min in the oven.  This is definitely a keeper!

Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!  These moist, spicy cookies were an instant hit with my family and friends.  They were definitely worth the extra effort involved in so much sifting.  I plan on making these every Christmas from now on.  Thanks again!

Excellent recipe!  I love spicy things so I amped up the spices and made them chocolate gingersnaps. I freshly ground up sticks of cinnamon, added 1/2 tsp. of freshly grated nutmeg, doubled the ground ginger to 2 tbsp., added 1 tablespoon of minced fresh ginger, and 1 1/2 heaping tbsp. of Dutch Processed Dark Cocoa powder. Everything else was followed. Highly recommended.

I don't know if it was something that I did wrong, but I only got just over 1 dozen and they went flat. I followed the recipe exactly and they looked nothing like the pics. they were darker and I thought had to much molasses. I plan on tring these again with some changes.

This was my first time making Gingersnap Cookies so I was a bit nervous. I doubled the batch as I do with all of my cookies and it turned out wonderful. I was kind of worried because the molasses has such a strong scent even after the batter is mixed that I began to think I did something wrong,as taste testing the final product.OHHHH BOYYY are they great. I will use this recipe every christmas.Thanks.

Oh my, these are delicious.  Spicy, sweet, crispy at the edges, chewy inside.  I didn't bother sifting and mine are a tiny bit too salty, but I blame my laziness, definitely not the recipe.

These cookies are just great; they have excellent flavor, perfect crispy-chewy texture, and are easy to make.  My only suggestions are to refridgerate the dough before rolling, as it is quite sticky.  Also, the first time I made these, I forgot the salt- don't do that! lol

Yummy! The thing I always disliked about gingersnaps is they are hard cookies (I know, that's where the "snap" comes from), but these are delicious and soft!  I especially loved that they came out perfectly the first time.  I live above 5,000 feet and usually have to make a recipe a couple of times before I get it right for the high altitude, but not these!

I'm not the biggest fan of gingersnap cookies, but these are great!  They are reminiscent of pumpkin pie flavor.  I left out the cinnamon sugar and just added more cinnamon.  This dough rolls well for cookie cutters; just keep in mind that they expand while baking quite a bit.  You do not need to flour (or sugar) the surface or chill the dough before rolling and cutting. I reduced the bake time to 7 minutes on a dark pan, 8 minutes on a standard pan.

This is a very good cookie and easy to make.  I used half shortening and half butter; also a little more ginger as some people said they did.  Everyone in my family loves them!

These taste the best the day AFTER- they are chewy and soft and v. good. Not quite true "GINGERSNAPS," but nevertheless a hit at my house! We put leftover Halloween Choc. kisses in the middle (via peanut butter blossoms). Thank you`

SO GOOD!  These also keep well for several days (if they last that long) without going stale.

This is a good cookie....but!  It is too much like a snickerdoodle to be a great cookie.  They turned out nice and soft and everyone liked them, that's why I gave the recipe 4 stars.  I sifted powdered sugar over them as they came out of the oven, I think that made them look nicer.  Maybe next time I'll buy some really good ginger and increase the amount to give them the pizzaz I think they need.

These are fabulous! I love it when I try a recipe and it is a 5-star right away! I made mine a little bigger and baked them for a couple more minutes. It made about 3 dozen.

These cookies are AWESOME!!!! I did make one change by adding 1/2 teaspoon of freshly grated ginger to the wet ingredients,which really took the flavor to the next level.

Simply the best cookie I have ever tasted.  I thought chocolate chip was my favorite cookie... but this recipe has proved me wrong!  I was a little short of ginger and, without knowing, thought the 1/3 cup was the 1/4 cup, so I was a little high on molasses and shortening (which frightened me at first because I had made frosting out of shortening the other day, and it tasted exactly like shortening even with all of those other ingredients. you couldn't even taste the shortening in this recipe!!). Will pass it on to friends and family. thanks for a great recipe!!

I made these thinking I wouldn't be as prone to over indulging as I usually do with chocolate chip - WRONG!!  These really were delicious, especially warm from the oven.  I did flatten the cookies with the bottom of a glass and added the teaspoon of cloves as recommended by a previous reviewer.  The only complaint I heard was my kids - they thought they smelled like a candle!

Cookies turned out perfectly.  I added a pinch of cloves to the batter for extra spice.  Recipe is a keeper to be sure.

These cookies are wonderful. This is a recipe that I make over and over again and we are never disappointed.  My in-laws who grew up in the early 1900's on gingersnaps were thrilled that I found a recipe so close to what they remember their favorite childhood cookie to be. Thank you for sharing.
