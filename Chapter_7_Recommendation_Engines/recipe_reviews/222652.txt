I've been doing a potato dish similar to this one for years.  I lighten it up by using lite sour cream and reducing the cheese down to just one cup. Instead of topping with additional cheese, I sprinkle with a bit of paprika for color. It is still plenty rich and indulgent tasting.  There is an error in that the ingredient list has both regular and green onions but the directions only mention the green onions.  I think one or the other would be fine or you can omit them altogether.

I wanted to turn this into a one dish meal. I did everything the regular recipe calls for, and also added lots of salt and pepper, and 1/2 lb each of shredded cooked chicken and diced ham. I also added one can each of drained green peas and drained French style green beans. I absolutely loved it and will definitely make again!

Everyone I made this for loved it.  Didn't use cream of chicken soup (don't like it) so substituted cheddar cheese soup.  My only other change was to use a mandoline to evenly slice the potatoes about 1/4 inch thick, so didn't parboil them.  It was cheesy, gooey goodness.  Thanks for a recipe I'll definitely repeat!

I was not expecting this recipe to be amazing, but I needed a quick and easy side dish for dinner so I decided to try it...It is really yummy, and a nice way to serve a comfort food. I made a few minor adjustments, and I think it turned out really good. First, after boiling my potatoes I sauteed  them to get more flavor  and added dried basil, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder for more flavor...I also sauteed the onions before adding them. The one other change I made was using cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chickens as I was out of it. Everyone gave rave reviews!

These were pretty good, the longer they sat the better they got.  I did add about 3 cloves roasted garlic, we love garlic! This went very well with roasted chicken and broccoli.

I never thought I would say this but TOO much cheese! I could hardly taste the potatoes. Next time i will add more potatoes and put in less cheese. It was just too rich for my taste and I usually don't say that.

I tweaked this a bit, and used Queso in place of the cheddar to give it a Mexican flavor. Delicious and easy.

This is fantastic!  My modifications were bits and pieces offered by other reviewers and my own personal preferences-I used cream of mushroom soup, I gave my chopped onion a quick saut√©, I left the peel on my red potatoes and I used 2 C of extra sharp cheddar in the mixture as well as on top.  As a delicious occasional side, these are a real indulgence that are OMG so  delicious!!

Not pleased.  Added 7 extra minutes and still seemed undercooked.   Potatoes were the same "almost done" texture & onions were still crisp. If I make again, I 'll increase the oven temp to 400 degrees.  I reduced the cheese to a total of 2 cups, 3 seemed too much & the cheese flavor was good.

Super delicious! My husband and I loved it, kids weren‚Äôt as convinced though. I was a little short on sour cream ( I used light), so I supplemented with plain yogurt.

I just made this, at first I felt there was enough "Sauce". The potatoes weren't fully covered. So I doubled the liquids and the cheese, I added another cup of Sharp Cheddar. It's a little soupy/ runny for me. Maybe I'll add a table spoon of flour.

Big hit for Christmas Eve. I did not use any extra salt, already enough in the soup and the cheese. I also took 2/3 of the cooked potatoes and mashed them prior to adding all of the remaining potatoes and ingredients. I believe this made the dish much creamier and allowed the favors to blend.

This recipe is excellent! I also think there's an error as the instructions seem to forget the onion.  I added the onion only and it came out rich, creamy and delicious. I made half the recipe to test for an upcoming dinner. Absolutely, will be in the menu and like someone suggested, I will try it with lite sour cream and less cheese. I do agree that it can be fine with less cheese. For decoration will definitely sprinkle paprika. I think also this can be turned into a main dish by adding cubed smoked ham. It is excellent try it you will not be disappointed!

As written I would not have liked all the cheese called for!  I 1/2'd the recipe, used cream of celery because it was what I had on hand and about 3/4 c of cheese total inside and top.  Also sliced potatoes thin to cut the baking time.  I added the green onions on the top layer because I guessed that's where they were meant to be.  Nice and creamy, hubby liked better then I did but sure I'll make it again, maybe with the called for soup!

I made these potatoes and they tasted pretty good.  Next time though I will not boil them first.  It made the texture of the potatoes weird.  I make other recipes similar to this that don't require boiling and the texture is better.  Thanks!

This was excellent - creamy and delicious! I did make a few minor changes - I used mushroom soup because I prefer it over cream of chicken, I used a little less cheese (1 cup in casserole and 3/4 cup on top) and I followed another reviewer's suggestion and sauteed the onions first. I also noticed the small onion and green onion in the ingredient list but no mention of the onion in the directions. I used ONLY yellow onion and no green onion.

This was so easy to make! We really enjoyed it, but did feel it was just a *little* bland. I'll make it again though, easy and tasty enough to warrant it joining our weeknight dinners.

It was delish!!! I didn't have sour cream so I used 1/2 cup of whole milk and added garlic powder. I omitted the extra cheese on top. Everyone loved it!

I hate sour cream but the flavor of these potatoes are really good. I don't cook with a lot of salt so I noticed that i could have used a little more salt for flavor. Also, I think that it has way too much onions in it (probably because I hate onions!! LOL) but my grandmother loves it with all the onions. Next time I make it I will use way less onions and and chicken. I made the pineapple chicken tender recipe with these potatoes and the two flavors together is perfect. It was really good!

This was a very good dish, and I would give this another half a star if I knew how.  I used russet potatoes and sliced them to about a quarter inch thickness (like scalloped potatoes). After I had sliced all 8 potatoes, I mixed up the ingredients for the sauce and decided that the ratio of potatoes to sauce didn't look right, so I only used about half of the potatoes. I'm glad I did because my husband loved them and I think if I had used all 8, the dish would have been too dry.

This turned out really nice.  When I went to make it though I had no cheddar cheese or onions!  I did have the green onions and mozzarella, so I upped the green onions to 8 and added a teaspoon of Italian seasoning to the potatoes to offset the mild cheese.  The family loved them!

My husband loved it, I did add garlic to this as well and it was awesome. I don't normally measure when I cook I just put in what I feel and taste prior it to make sure it's good.

Made these for Sunday lunch today. They were so so good. Not a bite left. The only change I made was to add real bacon pieces. To quote my nephew "these potatoes are to die for". lol

I added some cooked bacon bits and diced yellow bell pepper. Next time I think I'll slice the potatoes like a scalloped potato dish. Quite tasty.

very good - would next time chunk potatoes a little smaller.  One cup of cheese was plenty.  I want to try it with mj cheese with peppers.

These potatoes were a HIT in our home!!! Everyone LOVED them. I used fat free soup, just to cut back a bit. Amazing...thanks for sharing.
