This was a very good base recipe, but I added a few more ingredients so I would enjoy it more. I used chickpeas (1/2 mashed, 1/2 whole) added chopped tomatoes, put in a layer of zuchinni, brushed balsamic vinegar over the eggplant before baking in the oven, and used whatever quantities of ingredients I thought would be good proportions. Five stars after my additions. Thanks  Mai for the great base recipe.

Excellent vegetarian recipe and probably one of the best uses of eggplant.  For a single guy like me who is still finding his way around the kitchen, this dish turned out to be a great confidence builder, with plenty for left overs to boot!

I would definitely increase the quantity of sauce and use a slightly heavier hand on the parmesan.  

Thank you for a great dish.

This recipe was surprisingly good.  I was a bit skeptical of the yogurt, but you wouldn't have even known yogurt was in it once it was cooked.  I had a jar of garlic tomato sauce so I used that instead of making my own.  Since my husband and I are cheese lovers, I sprinkled a few tablespoons of shredded mozarella on top as well.  It was so simple to make (especially using bottled sauce) and was so yummy we each had seconds. I will be making this again soon.

This was a big crowd pleaser for vegetarians and carnivores alike, and overall pretty easy to make! I sliced the eggplant into ~1/3 inch slices then cut each slice in half before sauteeing with the onions as others suggested (skipped the salting/steaming process entirely). Since so many people talked about the recipe needing more sauce, I used 28 oz crushed tomatoes with 15 oz diced tomatoes and thought the ratio turned out well. For the yogurt, I upped the amount to ~24 oz nonfat yogurt-- everyone was so surprised that it wasn't cheese that I think I'll begin using it as a healthier substitute going forward! I baked the layered dish for 30 minutes covered before uncovering to add the topping. I needed a bit more of the breadcrumb/Parmesan mixture to cover the entire pan- probably 1/2 cup combined. Baked that for another ~10 minutes then let cool a little before serving. I will be sharing this recipe with friends and definitely making again!!

Delicious and rustic, I served with crusty garlic bread and it was a huge hit! I also followed the suggestions of others and cubed the eggplant before cooking with the onions.

I would have givin this 5 stars but I think it needs more sauce.  So just increase the sauce a bit and you have a GREAT eggplant recipe.

I was surprised at how delicious this turned out!  I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews, but decided to try it out & was very happy I did! My husband (VERY picky eater) LOVED it, which is the ultimate test as he doesn't like much! I made a few modications though: I sweat the eggplant slices in a 3/4 vegetable oil 1/4 lemon juice mix with salt and pepper for about 40 minutes.  Did not wash them off before steaming them, and as I don't have a steamer, I had to steam them in a heated pot (with a lid) adding a few Tablespoons of water. (they turned out pretty good!)  I also used a 24 oz. pre-made garlic tomatoe sauce mix instead.  As well as added some mozzerella in between the layers, and one dollop of cream cheese on top of each eggplant slice right in the middle.... This turned out delicious and I highly recommend it!! I followed the rest of the instructions almost exactly, but added more wheat germ and parm. cheese to the top than listed!  Will definitely be making again!

My husband came home hungry one night at 7:30 and I told him dinner would be ready in an hour (when I began this dish).  Unfortunately, at 10 pm, we had dinner (after he had snacked on other things..)  Be prepared; it takes quite a bit of time.  When it came out of the oven, though, my vegetarian husband had two plates.

Considering how filling and low calorie-low fat-high protein this is (ie, very Weight Watchers friendly) I will be making it again and again. It was very good, not great. But easy enough, tasty and almost no points for us WW people.

This seemed like a lot of work for what you get... This would be a good side item, but not main course. It would work better if you cube the eggplant, otherwise the skin is hard to cut.  It did have a good flavor, and I liked the flavor the yogurt added.

This recipe sounded much better than it turned out. It did not have much flavor and did not look very appetizing on the plate.

I was in a hurry and didn't read reviews before making this.  Wish I had because my family's opinion was it needed more sauce and more cheese. It really is a great tasting dish and I will use the ideas shared in other reviews the next time I make it.  I'll make enough so I can try leftovers!

It was a little bland for my family. But it is an extremely healthy dinner, so next time I'll spice it up a bit and I think they may like it then.

Very Yummy!!!  I made a few changes - I didn't steam the eggplant as long because I like the edges a little tougher (personal preference), and instead of topping with Parmesan cheese, I used mozzarella. Very good dish and relatively easy to make.

This was my first time trying eggplant.  I'm glad I tried this recipe! My susbtitions/changes: -Sauteed the eggplant with the tomato sauce to save time -Did not add salt to reduce sodium (tomato puree & parm chees have enough) -Replaced breadcrumbs with flaxseed meal (reduces some of the carbs & flaxseed is so good for you) -Used minced garlic instead of whole cloves to save time It's delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly. This dish was not for me and my family. Everyone made funny faces. I didn't care for it, so I told my children they didn't have to eat it after I saw their faces. This was our first time eating eggplant.

This was delicious.  I had to use tomato paste instead of puree (just added water to the thickness of my liking) and used light sour cream instead of the yogurt bc I didn't have any.  Fantastic!  Tasty & easy.  Microwaved the eggplant as suggested.  My breadcrumbs didn't get toasty enough but maybe I used too much.

I rate this 3 stars for a few reasons.  It tasted just fine, and for the calories and nutritional value, it can't really be beat, but would I make this more than a few times a year, no. I did increase the sauce like many other reviews stated, but otherwise, followed the recipe.  Mine seemed to get pretty runny- maybe from extra sauce, but seemed to just be watery  more so than extra saucy.  Like I said- good, but just good.

The yogurt adds a good flavor to this dish.  Steaming the eggplant softens it up so to the degree that I could cut it with a fork!

Delicious! Boyfriend who claims he HATES eggplant loved this dish. Easy prep especially because I didn't have to "sweat" the eggplant prior to cooking. I served over angelhair pasta.

This was great! I tend to alter recipes so I used 1 can of diced tomatoes + 1 can of tomato paste for the sauce. Also, I used greek fat free yogurt, which made it really creamy. The yogurt tasted just like cheese!

Mine came out watery, but I did not sweat the eggplant as the recipe said.  I cubed it and sauted it with the onions.  Next time I'll sweat the eggplant longer.  Regardless it tasted GREAT!

This was very very good, although I added some more spice than was recommended. I also doubled the amount of tomato sauce and halved the yogurt, which I think I will leave out entirely next time. Very weight watchers friendly, too.

i baked the eggplant slices until cooked, because steamed eggplant is yuckers and then you can go directly to the breadcrumb stage therefore saving lots o time

This was very good, and has earned a spot on my rotating go-to recipes.

Takes some time to make- but totally worth it.

I did not have any yogurt at home, so I substituted low-fat sour cream mixed 1/2 & 1/2 with low-fat ricotta cheese. It was fantastic!!!

I was worried the kids wouldn't care for eggplant, but they had 2nds and even 3rds (I served it as side). Steaming the eggplant was a bit time consuming though. I made my own sauce with tomato paste and chicken broth mixed in with the onions and spices for a little more richer flavor, and made it thicker than regular pasta sauce. Definitely a keeper!

This was a very tasty dish enjoyed by the group of friends I prepared it for.  One note though, I believe the ingredient list should read 2 8oz containers of plain yogurt, not one.

I messed this up in a couple of ways...overcooked the eggplant in the micro (don't steam eggplant in the micro...just a bad idea), then crammed extra layers into a too-small pan, which promptly bubbled over in my oven.  None of that mattered, however - this caserole looks very pretty and tastes tangy and awesome, even my husband loved it and he 'hates' eggplant!

If I could rate this two-and-a-half stars I would. To describe it in one word I would say its mediocre. I was not very impressed and neither were my brothers. (Their not fond of anything without meat though.) I guess I expected more tomato since it is called eggplant and tomato bake. It also needs alot of salt. I'll stick with eggplant parmesan.

I used goat's milk yogurt in this because I have a cow's milk allergy and it came out tasting surprisingly like lasagna. I cubed and fried the eggplant as some suggested and I think this was a good way to go. Also I increased the amount of tomato sauce. Husband said this was the best eggplant dish he's ever eaten!

This dish was yummy!  But I agree with the other reviewers.  It definitely needs more sauce and I added more cheese.  I also agree that it's more of a side dish.  It wasn't as filling as I would have liked, all by itself.  Overall, very good.

I liked the addition of healthy wheat germ as a topping.  I made this because I thought the yogurt was an interesting variation to using ricotta or cottage cheese & my husband loves yogurt.  Obviously we're in the minority but we didn't like the tart taste of the yogurt in this dish.  We both ate a small portion for dinner & threw the rest of it out.

The flavor is ok, but there's just something missing.  Fairly time consuming, too - it takes a while to steam all that eggplant. Figure an hour prep plus an hour of baking (it's mislabeled).  I guess if you're looking for a way to use up 3 entire eggplants, this will do it - but I think I'll make a parmigian instead when I want eggplant in the future.

After the eggplant sweated, I decided that I'd rather make a stovetop dish. I diced the eggplant in a big dice, then poured a little olive oil and water in a skillet and put the eggplant in there, stirred it around, and put the lid on top. It took  10 minutes to cook. Then I mixed the eggplant with the tomato sauce and added the yogurt, stirred it all up together. I sprinkled parmesan cheese on the top and put the lid on top with the burner on low. The cheese melted. Voila! We loved it.

This was pretty bland and a mess to make. I'm bummed because it seemed like an easier and healthier alternative to eggplant parm, but I was not happy with the results.
