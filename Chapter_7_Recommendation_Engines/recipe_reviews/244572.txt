I used rutabaga, turnip, sweet potato, baby red potatoes, sliced large carrot, okra, zucchini, and red onion.  Basically what was called for but just added a few extra.  The chicken broth was perfect to soften and flavor the veggies just right.  I didn't add any thyme or rosemary, just salt and pepper and it was perfect for us.  I'd like to make this in November for a nice hearty side dish but wanted to get this done for my project this month.  Definitely a keeper!!

This was delicious! I actually grilled these outside on the gas grill - and did not need the broth. I just cooked these until done.

I really loved the flavors of this combination of veggies. The broth gave it more depth to the flavor. it paired really nice with a roast. It is one that is a keeper.

no real flavor. cooking times very off. it didn't make since to cut the higher-density vegetables the same size as the lower density. this took forever and I thought the recipe exactly for how much weight or whatever measurement and they cooking time was more than double. the basic ingredients concept is good but besides that everything else is very flawed.

I tried this because I wanted to see what celeriac was like and if I still didn't like rutabagas.  This would be a good recipe if you like those vegetables, but I discovered I do not.

Good way to lively up the root vegetables a little. I used turnips and radishes instead of parsnips and rutabaga, just because that is what I had.  Will make again.

I made it and found it ok, nothing special. I don't think that I'll make it again

I made this recipe because someone gave me celeriac, and I didn't know what to do with it.  I made it as written but without rutabagas since my store didn't have them.  It was simple and a good way to use these veggies.
