I had several problems with this recipe.  One half of a 17.5 oz. pkg. of puff pastry IS one 8x12 sheet, at least in the Pepperidge Farm variety.  So the recipe should actually call for 1 pkg., not 1/2 pkg if there is supposed to be enough filling for two rolls. (Good thing I tried this out before my party, as I had already committed the other sheet of pastry to a baked Brie!)

Because of the concerns about greasiness mentioned in a previous review, I baked my pinwheels on a cookie rack placed on my baking tray so they might drain a little during baking, which seemed to help.  They definitely benefit from draining on paper towels after baking, and also from the ginger apricot dipping sauce I made to with them.

And 300 degrees for 20 minutes?  No way - try 375 for 25 minutes instead.  (The recipes that came w/ the puff pastry all called for 375-400, anyway.)

These pinwheels came out about 3 inches in diameter (quite a bit larger than "appetizer bites"), and that was starting with the longer edge when they were rolled up.  They would have been even larger had I started rolling at the short edge. The puff pastry in the center of the pinwheels was a bit soggy, too. Next time, I will cut the 8x12 down to 6x8.

(It wouldn't hurt to reduce the amount of sausage to 12 oz. either, which is the most convenient size pkg. available.)

I was disappointed in this recipe. It took much longer to brown that I had thought and they were so greasy... maybe it was the brand of sausage I used, but I don't think I'll be making this again anytime soon.

Okay, so after reading the bad reviews, I figured I'd tweak it a bit.  First off, I cooked the pork first, this allowed me to remove the excess fat from cooking it.  I used 1lb sweet sausage and 1lb ground pork.  I fried up onions & garlic first, then added the pork after pulling the onion mix, used the sage from another reviewer, (thank you!) celery salt, salt & pepper.  After the pork was just about done, added back the onion/garlic mix.  I rolled out two of the pastry sheets and put a layer on both, not thick but not thin.   Rolled it up, glued it together with some water and also pinched the ends too so it would stay moist. In the oven at 375 for about 35-45 min.  Basically, just till the pastry looked done.  Everyone from 7-88 loved it and went for seconds.  I'm totally making it again and I'll play with all the spices.  A great, quick & easy that you can really do anything with.  Just cook the pork first.  OH - the only thing I may add next time is an egg, just to bind it together after it's cooked. It did fall apart a bit but that didn't distract from the great flavor.

This recipe is so easy and impressive. I've made it numerous times and always get asked for the recipe. delicious. I made it the first time using parsley, but tried sage the next time. I have to admit the sage was a personal preference and we liked it better.

I enjoyed the taste and they are easy to make. I used 1/2 an onion and added some dried sage. The only thing I was not happy about was the pastry didn't puff in the oven, it was a bit heavy. I think I might try to refrigerator the sliced rolls before I cook them, maybe if the butter in the pastry is cool it will puff better.

I would suggest cooking the sausage and onion, draining it and blotting with paper towels before putting it on the pastry. Will cut down on all that grease and sauteed onion has a better flavor. And yes, 375 would be a good bake temp.I also added some cheese

I think the baking temperature is incorrect - try 400.  The sausage itself needs a few more spices for us.  They were OK but not as delicious as they could have been.

First of all to be a bit more healthy I used ground turkey and it wasn’t greasy at all.  Instead of parsley I used cilantro for more flavour along with some Italian seasoning which gave a nice flavour. This was after reading all the reviews and furthermore baked at 375 degrees for 15 minutes on one side and then another 10 minutes on the other side. I also cooked them on parchment paper ,otherwise they stuck.I have to take these to a BBQ so I tried them cold and they are delicious!!

Terrible recipe.  I would remove it from your site.  The oven temp cannot possibly be correct as 300 degrees for 20 then 10 minutes after flipping.  A soggy mess and puff pastry is not cheap.  I had to go and visit other recipe sites correct it to salvage it for my party.

I thought this recipe was okay. I didn’t hate it but would not make it again. It was very very greasy and the temperature is very wrong it also didn’t have much flavor from any other ingredients aside from the sausage which was extremely overpowering.i think I will try ham salami provolone and mozzarella with a butter garlic glaze. Seems better flavor wise in my opinion

The oven temp is definately wrong. It needs to be 400. These aren't terrible just a bit boring. They just seem like they are missing something. If I were to make them again I might try the sausage and cream cheese version.

Yummy. I added some cheese and garlic to the filling and also precooked the sausage and onions. I also made the puff pastry myself which I got from All Recipe as well. I did not turn them halfway through cooking because I figured I didn't have to since the insides were precooked. It still came out OK but the bottom started to burn a little bit which actually gave it a nice crunchiness. Just be careful not to over cook because any longer and it would have had a burned taste. The recommended time was perfect.
