5 Star Plus!!! Didn't have creole seasoning - made some from "Creole Seasoning Blend" on this site.  Didn't change a thing except to stuff and rub the roast with the seasoning and wrap it in clear wrap for three hrs. before cooking.  The meat was so moist and flavors delicious.  I served it with baked sweet potatoes and Chinese Peppered Green Beans (on this site) and applesauce.  A definite keeper.

This was wonderful pork roast!  I cooked this for a Christmas party and it came out moist and wonderful!  Instead of using the bacon grease, I layered strips of thick-cut bacon across the top.

Delicious!  I used a whole seeded red bell pepper instead of 1/2 a green pepper.  By accident, I added the entire 2 tablespoons of creole seasoning into the puree.  It tasted fine and it eliminates an uneccessary step.  I used a 4lb. pork loin instead of a roast.  This is so good as a leftover for tacos or in chili.

Loved it! I used a bone-in roast so baking time was cut down. I also cut lager slits in the roast to use more of the veggie mixture. The gravy was also very good.

This is the BEST roast recipe I've ever had!! I want to make this every day!!! I didn't have any celery so I just left it out. I used a creole seasoning recipe from this site and instead of pork, I used a bread and butter roast. It was sooooo good!

This was very good.  I made as directed except I didn't use the bacon grease...I didn't have any on hand and I also don't wish to clog my arteries any sooner than necessary.  It's pretty spicy and the flavor from the spices is enough to give it great taste even without the bacon grease.  Thanks for the great recipe

This is such an easy and great tasting recipe. Didn't have bacon fat so I drizzled a little olive oil over the top to help with the first hour's browning. Didn't hurt anything, but not sure if it helped either.  It was surprising how tasty the roast turned out. Thank you.

We had this tonight, and it was fantastic. It was a bit cold because I had to let it sit out, so we didn't eat as much as we should have, but it had a really good flavor, and it was so easy! I will certainly be making this again.

I thought this was very good although my vegetable mixture came out a little watery. I used a minichopper and I think I processed a little too long. I don't use bacon so covered rubbed the roast with garlic oil. The roast was very tasty. 

I had additional vegetable mixture which I tossed with potatoes, zucchini, onions and lemon pepper oil for a side dish...delicious.

I did not follow your recipe, but used it as a guide and it turned out great! I'll share what I did with my limited ingredients and will try your recipe to see how it differs.

I was looking for a crockpot recipe for a pork sirloin tip roast. I cut up 1 onion into chunks and put them in crockpot, along with 2 slices of raw applewood bacon (what I had), about 1.5 tablespoons of cajun seasoning, 1 tablespoonful chopped garlic, some Tastefully Simple Bell Pepper dip mix (I didn't have any peppers), a little water and the roast. I cooked it on low for an hour and then switched it to high for the next 3-4 hours until we were ready to eat. It was very good but did seem a little drier than I'd like (maybe it was the high setting), but dousing the meat in the juices was great. I think next time, I'll thicken up the juices to use as a gravy, but the flavor was amazing! Nice to do something different and I'll definitely do this again! Nice job!!

Very good!  I made as written.  It was a tad salty for my taste so that's why I gave it 4 stars.  I'm not sure if it was the bacon grease or the amount of creole seasoning that added the saltiness.  Very flavorful.  I think 4 hours would have been way too long to cook.  I took it out at 3 hours and 15 minutes and it was already 190 degrees.  Will make again.

Like another review stated, something just didn't taste like it went together.  The gravy was VERY salty.  I love salt and couldn't eat the gravy.  Sorry, but not for me.

This recipe is AWESOME!!!! I have made it many times the whole family loves it. I had an abundance of pork loin roasts that I bought on sale. They averaged 10lbs each so I wolud cut off about a 4lb piece for roast and the rest was cut for pork chops. The only thing I did different was instead of bacon grease witch I don't keep around the house I put 2 pieces of thick bacon on top of the roast and 2 more in the pan during the last hour of cooking to get the flavor. I use all the drippings, put them in a pot and make some awesome gravy with them. Serve it with Mashed potatos, and greens or corn. Great meal. I'm making it this weekend with a pork shoulder roast, I bet it will be just as good!!!! Thanks for a great recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly except for the bacon fat, as I don't usually have any of that on hand - I used veg oil instead.  Definitely a keeper and will make again!

This might be something others like, but my family just didn't like it.  The flavor just wasn't really there, just not through the meat well enough.  And with the bacon on top I thought it added too much greasy flavor.  Sorry but not something I'll make again.  But the meat once shredded, put into a crock pot with BBQ sauce & simmered made some great BBQ pork for sandwiches.

AMAZING! My husband devoured this meal. When making I only had a 3lb roast so instead of cooking it for 3 hours in that last stretch I probably cooked it for 1 1/2 hours. It packed powerful, wonderful flavor.

I don't know what the 3 stars did, but this was awesome! My family LOVED it! I've never made a pork roast before, but this was sooo good!I didn't make the gravy because my family doesn't really care for it that much, but the rest was perfect. Will definitely make again. Thanks Cindy!

I prepared this a few weeks ago with the exact measurements.  My boyfriend loved it.  I am cooking it again tonight but with a little less garlic.  Easy and great tasting.

We loved this recipe.  Like everyone else I made a few small changes.  I prepared the roast early a.m., covered and refrigerated to let it absorb the spices.  I omitted the 1/3 c bacon grease, as the roast had a layer of pork fat on it.  The meat was moist and there was lots of gravy.  Definitely a keeper.

I did something wrong with this one. The flavor was really yummy and not too spicy. I didn't cook such a huge roast and was unsure of how long to cook a smaller one. The cooking time being so long scared me a bit and I think that's where I went wrong. Next time I try this one I think I'll have company so I CAN cook a good size roast for the suggested length of time. Still very yummy though.

Wow!  This was a great roast.  I had to make the pesto behind my husband's back because I knew he wouldn't eat it knowing when went in it.  He loved it, no questions asked.  I will definitely make it again.

Good, but next time I might spice it up a little more.  Also, it seemed a little dry.

this recipe is really good, the meat turns out flavorful and tender- the best pork roast I've made....the garlic was too much though and also it was a little spicy for the kids, but that is to be expected

To us it was good but not outstanding. I think next time I will just try rubbing EVOO and Creole seasoning;I think that would be just as good.

this has fairly decent flavor, but it was alos a bit odd. Can't put my finger on it. Don't know that I would make it again -- a lot of preparation for just an "ok" result. I've had much better pork dishes. Sorry.

When I took my first bite of this roast I thought I had died and gone to heaven. I made no changes in the recipe and it turned out wonderful.  Thanks for posting this recipe

Lowered temp to 285 degrees and added 1.25 hours to bake time.  Also, baked in 4" cast-iron skillet with domed lid.  During the last 4 hours, 'almost' closed lid.  Excellent and fork tender...

Very tasty. I used a smaller sized roast so it didn't take as long. The vegetable mix puréed really watery so next time I am planning to just chop myself. Don't forget to start the bacon to get the grease at the beginning I forgot and had to make at the end! Otherwise fabulous. Not too spicy but good flavor. Use the left over juice after baking and mix with flour for a nice gravy.
