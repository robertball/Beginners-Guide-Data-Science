4.8.18  Didn’t have tamari, sub’d low sodium soy sauce, and skipped the Stevia, didn’t think it needed it for our taste.  I found the Asian flavor a bit weak, so I did end up adding more soy sauce.  Would recommend that you mix your arrowroot into a slurry using a bit of water rather than adding it directly to the hot liquid after the cooking cycle is complete, otherwise, you’ll most likely end up with lumps in your sauce.  Ended up with fork-tender, perfectly-cooked, flavorful beef.  Would suggest that you trim  off as much fat as you can because this is not something where you want fatty chunks of meat.  I served this with rice, but husband said he thought noodles would have been a better choice.  I’m always looking for new Instant Pot® recipes, and this is one that I’ll make again.  dlc1955dec, thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was a very simple and delicious dish. I did brown the roast in a cast Iron since I find it easier and can get it browned faster.

Definitely a keeper! The roast was tender and juicy. I substituted corn starch since I couldn’t find arrowroot and it worked out fine.
