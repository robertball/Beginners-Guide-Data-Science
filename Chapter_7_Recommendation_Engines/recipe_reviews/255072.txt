I swapped out lemon juice, & used Bragg’s apple cider vinegar instead  -
I also used EIGHT large Granniesto make 2 rustic tarts,  I don’t think “2 apples” is anywhere near sufficient to fill a 9-inch pie crust.
My first attempt used pre-made  crust from Immaculate Bakers & it came out beautifully,
I also made it several times with Trader Joe’s frozen pie crust, & once with Whole Foods’ version.  //. They were all good;  the tart-sweet sticky ooze that forms during baking is fantastic, if you LET THE SUGARED APPLES REST in a sealed bag overnight.  ;—)
I cut the sugar by a full third, & used Florida organic cane sugar.

This is a great holiday dessert. It's light and not too sweet. I used fresh cranberries instead of dried. Thank you for the recipe.
