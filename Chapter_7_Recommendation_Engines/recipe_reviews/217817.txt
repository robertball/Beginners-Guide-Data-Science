There are several things wrong with this recipe but with the right changes, I might make again. First of all, I cooked in the oven, as suggested, and it needed to cook A LOT longer than 15-20 minutes. I ended up cooking it at 400 for 20 minutes and then turning the oven up to 425 for 20 more minutes. The marinade was also too thin and didn't coat the meat like I thought it would. The cumin was a bit too much as well. I doubt I will make again.

Just fabulous. My whole family loved these.  Didn't have orange zest, so I put a dollop of orange marmalade instead and it was very tasty!!

It turned out FANTASTIC!!  Really good, and it was a big hit with the family. Kids didn't complain neither did the hubby. :) 

I did as one other reviewer had done; I used orange marmalade since I didn't have any oranges on hand to zest. I also didn't have any rosemary so that was omitted from the recipe, but it turned out great nonetheless! This will definitely be a repeat.

An original barbeque sauce with a unique blend of honey-orange-cumin-rosemary.  We cut the cumin in half as a little goes a long way for us, and we could still taste just enough of it.  I didn't have the orange zest, but it seemed just fine without it.  We marinated chicken breasts which were cut into thirds.  I'll make this again as it really stands out with its blend of flavors.

I realized I did not have OJ when I started to make this.  I threw in some lime juice and a little extra honey and they turned out fine.  I think the recipe isa good one.  Good alternative to spicy marinade for the grill.

Very good, although I didnt use rosemary (none on hand) and I used the baking method. I chose to broil them for an additional 7 minutes and they came out great. The sauce in the pan was thin and broiling it fixed that.

Used plenty of Sriracha to substitute for the Worcestershire sauce and also to add a bigger kick to the chicken. Came out GREAT! Will definitely do this in the future.

I used this recipe for 11 drumsticks and it was the perfect amount of sauce.  I didn't have OJ nor orange zest so I used lemon zest and lemon curd.  It actually tasted pretty good.  I used only 1 tsp of cumin and since I didn't have fresh rosemary, I used only 1 tsp (not tablespoon) of dried rosemary.  I baked the drumsticks at 400 for 30 minutes and then spooned the remaining sauce over the drumsticks and baked for 10 more minutes.  The drumsticks were tender and cooked perfectly.  I'd definitely use this recipe again since my husband said it was delicious.

Made this dish for 7 people! It was so good!! Don't abide directly with the instructions but cook to taste, it was an amazing mix of spice and honey! I made it with a salad and rice with corn.

very good. i didnt have orange zest, so i used lemon zest instead, couldnt really tell the difference. also felt that 1/2 cup honey was a little too much so used 1/4 cup instead and tasted like a great combination of sweet and spice. overall, turned out great and will definitely be cooking this again!

I halved the recipe for 5 drumsticks, didnt use orange juice or orange zest, just a scoop of sweet orange marmalade.  Baked for 20 each side at 375 degrees - no complaints! Leaving out the juice seems to help keep it thick for a nice glaze.   Will make this again!

Delicious sauce.  I didn't have cumin and subbed with paprika.  Only complaint is that my hubby burns everything, and this was no exception.  We just peeled off the charred parts and "re-painted" with the leftover basting sauce.  Is there a trick to grilling sweet sauces and not charring the outside?

This was a good weeknight dinner.  I decided to bake in the oven at 350.  It took roughly 45 minutes.  The glaze was very watery so I put it in a saucepan and added some cornstarch (a few tsp in some water) to thicken it up.  Yum!  Kids liked it too.  We ate it with steamed green beans, corn and a salad.  This would be a great meal for a BBQ with lots of people, you could also use the glaze for wings.
I omitted the pepper because I don't like it but also reduced the cumin to 1tsp.  Thanks for sharing!!!

It took 25-30 minutes to bake at 400 F. I don't see how you could cook it safely in 15 minutes.

This worked well tonight. I had all the ingrediets on hand which is always a plus:) I would make again, but will probably leave out the pepper ext time. My kids actually found it a bit spicy.

This was such a fast easy recipe that the whole family loved! I will make this again and again! I followed the recipe exactly - except for the orange zest (didn't have a fresh orange). Thanks for the great chicken!

The orange taste was a little too strong for me. Next time I will remove the orange zest and keep the orange juice.

We didn't like the taste of this marinade. We had to cook it for much longer than stated. Also, the sauce was too thin.

I tried orange Marmalade to replace the orange juice I was missing and orange zest. Word to the wise, orange marmalade was not the best substitute as the Orange taste was way too strong. Overall I thought the recipe was okay, maybe a little thin. My husband though loved the drum sticks. I will definitely make this again.

These were delicious!!  My family really enjoyed the flavor; hubby said, "It smells like an amazing Asian restaurant in here!"  The only thing I need to be more conscientious about next time is the time on the grill; because of the high sugar content in the glaze, I turned the heat way down on the grill so as not to char the chicken...because of this, they take longer to cook than anticipated.  The glaze made enough for 18 drumsticks, so it makes a lot!! Thanks.

Very flavorful! I did the oven baked version and put it at 400 while re-basting every 15 min. for a total of 45 min. A little to sweet for my taste and I usually like sweet things...so be very careful with the amount of honey you put in!

Excellent. Did the oven version. Decided to go uncovered. Made it just a little crispy just the way we like it. Might halve the orange juice next time.

I made this recipe in a Nuwave oven, which adjusts the time clock.  I replaced some of the ingredients with similar bases.  It came out great and I loved the taste.  Don’t depend on the time of a recipe though.  Always check with a thermometer or if you know how firm poultry is suppose to be when cooked.

As suggested in some of the reviews, I used about a 1/4 cup orange marmalade instead of orange juice. This marinade was very good, one of the best I've ever used (and I've used a lot!)! I grilled my chicken instead of baking, and I do recommend the former.

I made the recipe as directed and we liked it  very much. It's not over-the-top exciting, but good and worth repeating.

We had this for dinner tonight.  I was planning on grilling until I couldn't get the grill to ignite.  I ended up baking in a 400 degree oven for about 30 min.  I made 5 drumsticks and two boneless skinless chicken breasts.  Everything was juicy, tender and full of flavor!  No leftovers!!!  The only thing I changed was to do 1 tsp of cumin instead of 2 and I used thyme instead of rosemary because that's all I had.  I will definitely use this recipe again and would like to try it on pork sometime, too!

Absolutely amazing.  I used this recipe with drums, thighs, and split breasts and the family demolished it.

The chicken was juicy and had a flavor, but it was incredibly bland. It didn't stick. I think I'll try dredging it next time to get it to stick. And, honestly, the only reason any flavor stuck was because I put it in the fridge to marinate, realized it was too late to cook for lunch, forgot about it until the next night's dinner. So, more than 24 hours marinating and it was still bland as could be.

My picky eaters rarely agree on a meal, but they all enjoyed this one!  One word of advice, have finger bowls on the table...it is very messy.  I did add a splash of Franks Red Hot Chili sauce...it was yummy!  Thanks for the great recipe!
