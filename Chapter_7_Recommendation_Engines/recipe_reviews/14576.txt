Grilled Cataloupe? You bet, this recipe was awesome. I would have never suspected grilled fruit could taste so good until I tasted this recipe at a friends house. I suspect it's got something to do with the ice cream and sauce on the side . . .

I made this for a BBQ dinner party last night.  Everyone thought I was weird when I started putting cantaloupe on the grill, but then they tried it.  Everyone loved it!  I was pleasantly surprised myself.  I served the cantaloupe over ice cream and poured the sauce on top.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for a really great and different recipe!

Not very impressive. The mint conflicted with the melon too much. I think it would have been better with only the butter and honey.

I was underwhelmed. The idea is cool, but there wasn't enough flavor for us. Bland.

My wife loathes cantaloupe, so I tried this with mango as well as cantaloupe. Turned out Fantastic! I think next time I might use a cheese cloth and strain out the mint however.

It's hard to beat the naturally sweet flavor of cantaloupe! I played with this recipe a bit...reduced mint to 1 tsp, marinated the fruit in ingredients listed in recipe for 2 hours, fruit came out a bit mushy afterwards. You could reduce marinating time, or as I did with a new batch:  -Marinate in the freezer, just until the mix started to freeze.  Let this batch warm enough to drain, let come to room temp & grilled per the recipe. Just a hint of mint and very good taste!

I'm a huge cantaloupe fan and generally adore grilled fruit.  So I was certain I would love this recipe.  Unfortunately it failed to meet my expectations.  The mint overpowered the light flavor that makes this melon so good in the first place.

Really good. When I told my husband he would be grilling cantaloupe he gave me a funny look and said EWW. But I like grilled fruit and I figured it was worth a shot. The glaze was very nice. And my doubting husband ended up loving this :) Served with vanilla ice cream. Yummy. Give this recipe a try!

This was an interesting way to serve cantaloupe. My girls were the 1st to hit this and were the last ones to walk away from it...must eat them warm to enjoy the full affect. The honey butter sauce was really great, I used things from local...local blackberry honey from a farm in town and apple mint I am growing in my garden. It was lip smacking delish! I could totally use the sauce on other fruit whether they are grill, fried or fresh. It really is something that makes things shine.

I love grilled melon.  As a personal preference, I use garam masala to flavor it and it's just lovely.  Thank you for sharing!

After watching The Grill Masters competition on "Chopped," I decided to try grilling cantaloupe. Interesting and fun, yes, but not better than eating plain, simple slices. The extra work and calories were not worth it to me.

Wasn't quite sure what to think about this after reading the ingredients. Tasted pretty good I might say. Call me weird but I prefer just salt on my cantaloupe. Nevertheless it was good.

I think this would be best with slightly underripe fruit. I used cantaloupe from my garden, which was super ripe, so this came out a bit mushy, and the honey made it too sweet. Great idea, but for me, cantaloupe is one of those foods that are best served as is.

Amazing.  I don't understand the reviews that said it was bland, hello?  melons are not exactly a hot pepper flavour, and/or the mint overpowered...  did you used the whole melon?  Check out the first picture shown, that is not an overdose of mint to the melon content.  Very refreshing, grilled melon and pineapple are quickly becoming the "in" thing.

Went very nicely as a side with Asian hamburgers and corn on the cob.  Did not change a thing.  Our guests thought it was a lovely touch.
