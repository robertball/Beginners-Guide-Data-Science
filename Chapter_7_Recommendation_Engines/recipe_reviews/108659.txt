This was delicious!  WOW!  I did add another cup of water during the cooking and then about a half cup of chicken broth.  I also put in about 3 T of tomato paste instead of 1.  The secret to tenderness is to cook it low and slow.  I served this over basmati rice and it got rave reviews!  A definite "do again".

This was awesome!  I followed the directions exactly up to Step 3: I poured all the contents into a crock pot and let it simmer on low for 4 hours.  To adapt the recipe to the crock pot, I added 2 additional cups of water and a can of chicken broth. This was my first time trying goat...and I wasn't disappointed!

This recipe had a sweet flavor. It smelled phenomenal while it was cooking. It was very good. Goat meat tends to be tough, and while we added extra water throughout the cooking, the meat stayed fairly tough. Also, this really wasn't a stew. It ended up yielding only meat and the onions and peppers, there was no extra sauce or broth like with a stew. It would go very well with rice, but was only okay with potatoes.

Got some goat at the farmer's market and was not sure what to do with it.  Tried this recipe for a weeknight dinner, and was very happily rewarded.  Delicious, slightly sweet, and the goat is unlike any other meat I have tried.  Texture similar to veal, but MUCH more flavorful.  I recipe I will certainly make again.

I thought this stew was amazing. The end product is a very thick stew--think saucy, not soup. Also, don't be afraid to add as much water as necessary to keep it from sticking, the stew will still be flavorful!

I'm not sure what flavor this was supposed to have, but the end product was not to our liking.  I won't even attempt this again.

I didn't want to open a can of tomato paste for one spoonful, so I used a tomato-based hot sauce instead. This dish filled the kitchen with amazing aromas, and the nutmeg complements the goat very well.

I made this in my slow cooker for about 8 hours and let it cook overnight. The goat was so tender the next day, we didnt need to pull it off of the bones. The flavors and spices were amazing. i had made it for a potluck at the office and everyone couldn't believe it was goat. I didn't have any left to bring home! AWESOME RECIPE!

This recipe is very tasty.  It is exactly like the Goat Stew found in restaurants in Curacao.  Lots of tasty gravy/broth.  Yum!!

pretty tasty and very easy!  i made this in a pressure cooker after the initial browning -- no need to adjust liquid measurements, there was plenty.  i'm not sure what the lime/water soak does so next time i might skip that step.

I read the other reviews and made a few modifications, but I think I've found a new favorite!  Thank you for sharing!

My changes:
1.  At step 3, I put everything in a crock pot and cooked on high for 4 hours.
2.  I added 2 cups of beef broth, given the additional cooking time.
3.  Since I had no tomato paste, I used ketchup.  Surprisingly enough, it worked out great, giving that little bit of tomato taste that balanced the flavor out.
4.  I added an extra tbsp of soy sauce, measured the black pepper and used 1/2 tsp, and added 1/4 tsp each of garlic powder and ancho chili powder.
5.  I served it with coconut-milk rice; it was good side-by-side, but once the meat was gone, I dumped the rest of my rice right into the bowl of broth.

I think I'm going to try this with beef, lamb, and chicken, just to see how the different variations play out.

We enjoyed this stew, but found it a bit bland. Maybe an extra dab of the sweet soy sauce and some chili powder would perk it up? Loved the flavour of the goat itself!
