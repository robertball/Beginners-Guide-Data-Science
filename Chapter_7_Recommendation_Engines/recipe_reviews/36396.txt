This is quite good. Even my picky husband liked it and he usually won't even try anything "different". I might add a pinch of garlic next time.

It is so easy.  I use the food processer and do not have to dirty any dishes.  This is my usual contribution to every party I attend, and no one ever complains.  I always bring back one EMPTY dish!

Great! I didn't have enough cream cheese, so I added 1/2 c. herb and garlic feta cheese and 1 teaspoon of barley miso.

This is an excellent spread. I even substituted non-dairy cream cheese and eggless mayo and it was superb!! Great alternative to a cheese ball. Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

This was a surprise indeed! I followed the recipe exactly without any changes - fresh, sweet carrots are the key. I served with "Sociables" and they were the perfect compliment to a fantastic appetizer. I would definitely make again!

Refrigerate overnight to let the flavors blend. I did add a bit more onions, but the real difference is adding about 2 tablespoons of finely chopped green pepper.  That idea is from another recipe I make.  In that recipe, it calls for a small can of crushed pineapple, well drained (squeezed) instead of carrots.  Both are great!

this turned out horrible. Maybe my carrots were not sweet enough and didn't balance out the pecan flavor?  I tried it with several different crackers, and it was not good on any of them!  I didn't bring it to my dinner party and would not make it again.

I served this at our last book club meeting. All the ladies loved it! For best results, I put the carrots through my mini-food processor.

It does taste like carrots & pecans, and I think it needs a few more ingredients and spices to be incredible.  I think it would work well to fill celery for a lunchbox, the flavors aren't strong and my 10yr old daughter liked it.  I plan on trying to 'recondition' this recipe into something else so we'll enjoy it more.

Tasty. I had one of those "food memories" from my childhood when I tried this . I gave it 4 stars because the texture isn't pleasing for me. I stirred it together by hand but didn't like that texture either so I tried putting everything in the food processor to whip it up..that is better and now it looks and feels a bit like a grainy hummus. It is quite tasty though and I think most people would enjoy it. I made a half batch for my small family and I think that will last us awhile yet.

This was so delicious!  I added some paprika and a few dashes of hot sauce to give it more flavor.  Just threw everything in the food processer. So easy!

I stuck with the recipe as is and I did not like this.  I know everyone says it's great, that's why I tried it for a party.  No one touched it and I thought it had no flavor.  Sorry!

I thought this was a tasty spread, but it was a bit bland.  I added some Spanish smoked paprika from Penzey's spices.  It rounded out the flavor nicely.  I would also add a bit more onion next time.  This recipe was good with veggies as a dip too.

I like this as a pinwhell appetizer and I use a food processor to pulse to the texture I like. Very fast and easy clean up too.

Love this dip!  Made it several times and everytime, I have multiple requests for the recipe.  It is easy to change up--definitely add extra onion (red, sweet, shallot all work), peanuts add a different nice flavor, and low fat mayo works fine.  Sometimes I add a pinch of sugar.  I use a food processor as well for fast mixing and easy clean up.

This was a big hit on new years.  Tasted great on thin slices of sour dough bread.  I increased the onion a little as one reviewer suggested. Will make again.

This was pretty good, not outstanding. I  liked it better with certain types of crackers. The combination of dip with wheat crackers was better than with white or butter crackers.  I might make it again.

I followed the recipe as is and have received so many compliments. It's good on crackers and on veggies. I've also added far more carrots than the recipe calls for--still great! I would probably check the carrots to make sure they're not extremely bitter, but this is pretty foolproof.

I would give this 6 stars if I could!  Awesome flavor.  I did not expect this dip to come out with such great flavor but it did not disappoint!  I ate a bunch before I even served it.  Even great on a spoon by itself!!!  THANK YOU for this recipe!!!  I will be making this dip as often as possible.

This was a suprise! Took this to a potluck and everyone loved it. I did add a little extra onion as mentioned. Next time I will try to shape this in a ball and put chopped pecans on it for a cheese ball alternative. Delicious!
