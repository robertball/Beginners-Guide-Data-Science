This turned out really well, but I added 2 T. freshly grated ginger root for extra Chinese-y flavor.   More fun to eat if you cut in pcs. longer than 1".  The third-across cut is an excellent idea, the butcher can do this with his band saw.

This was definitely a finger licking good recipe.  I wanted something that was lighter then the traditional barbecue sauce. (Partly for a low carb diet.) It was great.
I would stick with the low sodium Soy sauce.  I didn't have any and figured it was just for health reasons that it was done with the low sodium soy. But it is just a tiny bit too salty with regular soy sauce.  
I also goofed and cut the ribs only into 3rds rather then individually.  It was too late when I figured out my mistake. I was already browning them.  But worked fine, I doubled the sauce and just cooked them longer. About 2 1/2 hours at a really low heat.  
This is a keeper recipe for me.

These were great! Be sure to use low-sodium soy sauce, I didn't and it was a tad salty. Brown really well. Turned out very tender.

As my husband was licking his lips and doing his very much approval sound he makes when he really likes something said "These are the best ribs you've "EVER" cooked in the 4yrs we've been together." He has raved about them to all his male friends. My wife can cook but she knocked them out of the ball park with these.  Proud wife that loves to cook and please her man. Thanks for this great recipe. Cooking them again tonight! Kathy House in Jacksonville NC

These are finger licking good and easy to make. After initially browning, I continued to turn them on all sides to brown evenly.  Sauce thickens as it cooks.  Use non stick Dutch oven for easy clean up. This is truly a keeper.

This recipe is sooooo good. Finger licking ribs it is! Made it for dinner tonight and my family said that it's the best food that I've ever cooked haha. I did add 5 cloves of freshly minced garlic and sauteed it. I also couldn't find a dry sherry so I replaced it with premium cooking wine. This is definitely my new favorite recipe. Easy to cook.
