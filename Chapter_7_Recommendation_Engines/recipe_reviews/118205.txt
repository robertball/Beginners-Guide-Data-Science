Great. I skipped the cream cheese though and I don't think it needed it. Loved the seasonings.

I used fat free sour cream and low fat cream cheese cause that is what i FOUND at the store... My bf added fresh smashed garlic cloves (2) instead of garlic powder and it made all the difference.  Very yummy potatoes.

Very Creamy. I did not use sour cream. Just the cream cheese. And I loved it.

Didn't have the cream cheese or chives, but used everything else and these were still a bit dry so I ended up adding lite butter and whipped them and they came out OK.

We didn't like these very much. My boys asked me to go back to my "regular" mashed potatoes.

These potatoes were pretty dry.  It might have been the potatoes that I used, but I ended up having to add a whole stick of butter just to save them.  Next time I would use Yukon Golds or even Redskin potatoes...Other than the dryness, they were very tasty.

YUM! These potatoes were delicious. I did use green onions instead of chives and just threw some on top instead of mixing in. Very good, thank you! :)

I boiled the potatoes with garlic salt and drained. While mixing the sour cream and cream cheese with the potatoes i added salt to taste and garlic salt. I didn't have the chives and paprika. They were white and fluffy and very creamy, a real hit!

LOVED THEM!  I added a little extra sour cream (I used fat free) Great overall. Couldn't believe they were fat free!

I used FF plain yogurt instead of light sour cream to lower the calories even more. I didn't need as much as the recipe called for, just about a quarter cup. I didn't need as much milk, either. I warmed the milk in the microwave, then added it gradually until the potatoes were the right consistancy. I served this with Portobello Mushroom Stroganoff and steamed broccoli. For someone who is doing a low-fat, low carb diet, these serve the purpose. For my husband, he noticed the difference. Still, if he wants the full fat version, he can always cook them himself. Thanks for sharing a lower cal version of my favorite comfort food.

My husband went NUTS over this recipe. He's on a diet so we try to go light on everything... and man, this recipe just hit the spot! Only trouble is, he loved it so much he almost ate the whole batch! So much for the diet, huh? LOL.

I really liked these, I served them under chicken and noodles so you really couldn't tell the difference. I added butter (smart balance) because it's just habit.!!

I used Yukon Gold potatoes for this. It was way creamier than I anticipated and I didn't miss the extra fat. Well worth a try even if your not on a low fat diet.

This is absolutely delicious.  I made the recipe just as written, very moist and creamy.  The only thing I can't figure out is the stated serving size and amount of servings.  I put this recipe through a recipe analyzer and it came up with a different serving size = 1 cup or 215 grams.  I really think that there are more than 8 servings.

Made as written, but scaled to only 4 servings.  Taste is great - you would never know that these are light.  Will definately keep on file to make again.  Perfect compliment for tonight's meatloaf.

I usually botch mashed potatoes; too lumpy or too pasty.  These were perfect!  Even my mom was raving about the mashed potatoes.

I also omitted the cream cheese just to save more calories.  They turn out very well, and much lighter than my old mashed potato recipe.

Amazing mashed potatoes. I used fat free sour cream and not as much milk. They were amazing, and I could barely tell they were fat free. Another thing I found easier was to chop the potatoes up and then steam them for about 30 minutes.

This was an awesome twist on conventional mashed potatoes (milk and butter), and so easy to do.  I added the milk last and didn't have to add 1/2 cup to reach the desired consistency.  More like 1/5 cup.

I made this for my Thanksgiving lunch and everyone loved it. Many wanted to give it a 15 star. In my opinion, I would have given it a four. It seemed to be dry to me. I followed the direction exactly except for adding the chives and paprika since I did not have any on hand. I will make again though and have been told that this will be on the table for Christmas.

I like the ingrediants in this recipe, but it was a bit much away from potatoes.  I think halfing the cream cheese and sour cream would be better.  I will try that next time.

This was a great recipe, very fluffy, and the cream cheese keeps the potatoes from getting too sticky when you beat them. Yum!

These were yummy. I had company over so I wanted to do something a little more special than just regular mashed potatoes. These did the trick. My guest said the paprika added a nice touch, and actually added more to his plate. My husband also really liked them. I LOVE mashed potatoes, and I thought they were really good.
