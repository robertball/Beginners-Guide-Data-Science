My husband and I are on a low-carb diet ...radishes are very low-carb. Anyway, I fixed these and loved them! My husband couldn't believe they were radishes. Cooking them and adding butter took away the bite and bitterness and left them mellow and sweet.

I added a dash of salt to my radishes, that really made a difference in the flavor.  I also added about a tsp of lemon juice, and it seemed to bring out the flavor kicked it up a notch.  This is a pretty good recipe for those looking for ways to use up an over abundance of radishes out of your garden!

This recipe doesn't mention that the radishes will blow off the dish's cover in their attempts to escape the microwave-safe dish and tinge the inside of your oven pink.  Other than that, I liked this treatment of radishes.  I added salt, butter and lemon juice and enjoyed these much more than I've ever enjoyed them raw.

I just found out this year that I really like cooked radishes - and would recommend radish-lovers try them. This may not be the best recipe to start with. The cooking time is too long in my opinion, and they are going to be blandish as written. I steamed mine for about 5 minutes and added seasoning to the butter. Still, it all depends on your preference - I tend to like my veggies on the rare side. Thanks for the recipe!

My radishes were quite big, so I cut them in half instead of peeling a strip off.  I steamed them until they were fork tender, added butter, a touch of salt and lots of pepper.  My husband and I were both pleasantly surprised by the mild flavor.  It was very nice for a change, and I will do this again if I find myself with a bunch of radishes.

I'm not really sure what I was expecting - after all, this is still a vegetable.  Before this, I have only had radishes uncooked on a salad.  After being steamed, they taste kind of like cauliflower only more bitter.

Tasty and simple! My radishes must have been too small because they were mushy after 5 min. of microwaving. Next time, I'll cook them less. And yes, they'll be a 'next time' because we like them!

The family, except one stubborn teenager who refused to try one, thought these were great! We think they taste like very mild turnips!  My bro-in-law thinks the stripe of radish skin should be left on to leave a little more flavor.  He wants them again tonight!  Three bunches fed 3 of us, and we would have loved more!!

I got some radishes in my co-op and tried this recipe specifically because of the description and the fact that I hate radishes. It was good! I would actually eat it again. I steamed it on the stovetop and just added salt, pepper, and butter.

I used my steamer and added lemon juice, butter, and dill weed. I was stunned at how delicious these are! It never occurred to me to cook radishes before, but I am so glad to find a way to enjoy them in some other way than plain or in a salad.

These totally don't taste spicy like radishes anymore. They taste more like steamed broccoli stem. I would recommend cutting larger radishes in half (several of them exploded in the microwave). I had a regular-size bunch of radishes and decreased the cooking time by half, but I would cut it down to maybe 3 minutes next time.

At first I thought radishes, maybe I'll save them for my birthday and put a candle on it. Better yet, eat a candle. But with this recipe, so long bananas, I've found a new source of potassium!

Different.  Hubs likes radishes, me, not so much.  I was intrigued by this recipe and it didn't disappoint.  I actually liked them better steamed than I did raw.  By steaming, it took the bite out and actually had a slight sweet taste.  I will make this again when we have our fresh garden radishes.

I was surprised that I liked these; steaming the radishes really did change the flavor.  I did not take the time to remove the skin on the outside, but did cut the bigger radishes in half for even cooking.  I found the 8 minutes was a little long, next time I will check them at 6 or 7 minutes.  I also found I did not need all the butter.  I only used 2 tablespoons of light butter and it was more than enough.

Before this recipe I had only had raw radishes in salads. This recipe for cooked radishes was DELICIOUS. Happy to add another vegetable to my options.

WOW! was the first word out of my mouth when I tasted one. The radish tasted like a slightly spicy cauliflower. Very good! I used my Tupperware steamer in the microwave and it took the 8 mins as the recipe stated. I checked them at 3 min intervals twice and then just did 2 more minutes. Some of the radishes were done at 6 mins, but I just left them in the steamer. I normally do not eat radishes, but I received 6 1lb bags for free so I thought I try to do something with them. This is it! I will definitely be eating more radishes and will need to plant some in my garden!

So, I steamed red and white radishes. Dabbed with some butter, sea salt and pepper. That's IT. And they're REALLY good. Radishes are okay, and I like them because they're good for me. But steaming them made them much more pallettable and I will definitely do this again! What a low calorie side dish! You can easily sub butter, I'm sure with an oil of your choosing.

Surprisingly very good! I cut them before steaming them, as I don't see the need to peel them and added salt to the water. They resemble the flavor of turnips and could easily be made in to "mock-tatoes" for low carb dieters. Yummy!

I came to allrecipes looking for a radish recipe, since my farmer's market delivery service has been bringing a LOT of radishes lately (one can only eat so much crudite)--who knew they were good steamed? Just delicious with a tiny bit of butter and salt. Yum!

I've done this for years as I don't care for radishes raw. I find I like the radishes better steamed and then sauted with garlic and butter. Either way, it's a good way to use up your radishes.

I would recommend slicing these- easier to handle (just cook until tender.) My favorite way to prepare cooked radishes is normally in "Hot Salad" but these are quite pretty when mixed with the different colored radishes. I used red and green ones as in my pic and small purple turnips. The turnips were just as tasty.

This was great!  I have a steamer that didn't quite want to work that night, so I did it over the stove.  I'll add my own seasoning next time.  And there will definitly be a next time!

I had some radishes that were even too hot for me to eat raw & tried your recipe. This took all of the "hotness" out of them & they were very good. Will make the rest of them this way.

I had no idea you could steam radishes!  I cut mine in half, steamed steamed them on the stove, added butter and salt and it was wonderful!  My 10 year old gobbled them up faster than anyone!

Who knews? After steaming, put in a little butter, and garlic salt.  Family loved them.  Bought more at the Farmer's Market today.  Steaming them, takes out the bite!

They are still radishes, tried this in hopes I would have an alternative for fresh readishes but unfortunately this didn't "cut it" for me.  They still tasted like a radish. It cut down on the bite a little but I could still taste it.  This is not a winner for me.

This is SO good!  The problem at first is that I had homegrown tiny radishes and 8 minutes in the microwave burned them up.  For skinny little radishes, 2-4 minutes will suffice.

Considering the simplicity of the recipe, I found these to be quite good. Served with "Pollo Mediterranean," "Roasted Vegetable Medley," and "Creamy Turnip With Paprika Soup." Next time I'll make it in my steamer.

I tried all the suggestions to make these taste the best but they were very bland, I threw out the rest. I could not even get my husband to eat them.

I'm giving this a five-star rating because I am just floored by learning that radishes can be cooked! What a simple, but wonderful dish. My husband and I are on a strict diet, so I had to leave out the butter, but they were just delicious anyway. I just sprinkled a little salt and pepper.  We will have them often!

I "accidentally" bought radishes and didn't know what to do with them. Found this recipie and can't believe how different cooked radishes taste from raw ones. They were very yummy, quick and easy. I also only steamed them for about 5 min. (for about 8 radishes) and think that was plenty. Thanks!

Had some radishes to use up and no salad greens, so I gave this one a try. Turned out okay - I kind of liked them, but my husband didn't think they had enough flavor. If I try these again I will probably season them or mix with other vegetables.

After steaming these all the flavor and bite seemed to go. Radish's flavor do not hold up well in the steaming process.

It tasted like (less-bitter) radishes in butter.  Probably better if it was turnip instead of radish.

Who would've thought steamed radishes would be so good. It completely changed the taste of them, the bite was gone. I steamed them in a pot. I wasn't in a rush. They didn't need that much butter. Maybe a tablespoon or two. Will make again. Thx Rebecca.

you can taste each "ingredient".  Cook 'em a little less in my opinion to keep some texture, + a dash of salt... and it's 5 stars.  Thanks

Tasted so much better than I expected.  I had received a bunch of red and a bunch of white radishes and did not know what to do with them.  I checked your recipes and made the steamed radishes and everyone loved them!

Like many others here, I had more radishes than I knew what to do with.  I tried this recipe b/c it was easy.  After cooking, I did sprinkle them with some celery salt to brighten them up a little.  They were good.

These are exceptional - I steamed them with sweet corn kernels and then served with butter, kosher salt, and fresh parsley from the garden. Rave reviews, even from the boyfriend who rolls his eyes whenever I unload radishes from the CSA box.

I absolutely loved these! As someone else suggested, I also added a hint of lemon and salt to kick up the flavor. I will definitely be making these again soon.
