Although this is an attractive, quality salad, I must stress that the sesame oil DOMINATES the entire salad and meal if you don't cut it at least by half (in my opinion). I also added a dash of fine sugar to the rice vinegar in order to boost the fruit's power while tempering the sesame oil. I tried serving this with arugula, as well as the mesclun mix, and both fared equally well with about 40-50 guests.

I personally liked this salad a lot, although I like to try new things. A guest said they preferred "regular' salad.  If any modifications, I'd cut down just a little on the oil, and add chopped red onions.

The dressing forthis was so easy - elements I always have in my kitchen - the mango added nice color and flavor.  I used spinach from a bag. still really good.  added some romaine for crunch.  the dressing and mango are the punch, any greens would be honored to be adorned with that mix!

Have made this recipe for two dinner parties; was a hit both times.  A good bet for pot-luck dinners where you're not sure what the host is serving as a main course.

Very tasty. When I made the dressing I was worried there wouldn't be enough, but it was fine. I used a bag of spinach instead of hunting around for specialty stuff. The mango and ginger was an interesting and refreshing combo. Our guests went back for seconds! I served it with chicken sate (satay).

The dressing is very tasty and combines really well with the mango flavor.  I also used it on other salads and sometimes minus the shredded carrots.

This salad is really quite good, but the dressing has a very vinegary taste to it.  Next time I make it, I will try scaling back on the vinegar and adding a little more sesame oil or peanut oil.  The mangos with the mixed greens is very good.

Crisp, great mix of flavors!  Served this for a girls cooking night and everyone asked for the recipe!  I make the dressing at least every other week for my family.

This is a really great salad but I would suggest a little sugar. The combination of flavors goes so well together. Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!!  Very light dressing.  I didn't have sesame oil so I used grapeseed oil.  Added parsley too for some additional color.  Everyone wanted recipe.  Served salad with mango chucks on side, mushrooms, and tomatoes.

I keep flip flopping between 4 stars and 5 stars, so consider this a 4.5.  The salad is a great combination of flavors that work really well together.  The only complaint that I have is that it needs something besides mango and mesclun.  I think cashews would have been a great addition.  Also, maybe some crumpled goat cheese to help combine the flavors?  I'll make this again with a couple of changes.  UPDATE: I made this again with a few changes and it was 5 stars.  This time around I added a chopped avocado (which, for presentation purposes can be mixed in lime juice briefly), and a generous sprinkling of cashews.  Perfection!

I liked the salad, it was tasty and colorful.  However, my family did not like the dressing.  They felt it almost made the salad taste bitter.

Only giving it 4 stars, because my husband doesn't like sweet stuff in his salad and ate around the mango.  The next time, I will leave the mango out and add sesame sticks instead of sesame seeds.  Didn't even notice the sesame seeds.  The dressing was very good.

Delicious.  The dressing is tangy and adds a kick to the mango.  I'll definitely make this again.  I used baby spinach instead of mesclun.

Very nice salad.  I cut the sesame oil by a bit as suggested by other reviewers and used fresh mesclun from the garden (although I didn't have fresh ginger).  As others did, I think it would be great on spinach, too, with a little bit of red onion.

I used spinach instead of mesclun greens, per the suggestion of Keri Kennelly.  The mango was a nice touch to the salad, but I don't think the dressing was for me.  I won't be making this again.

Wow.  A ton of strong flavors that mix well together.  Definitely a keeper on any kind of greens.  Wonder how it tastes on ice cream?
