HOLY COW these are TAAAAAA-SSTY!  I made these and then had to bring them to my mom's a few hour later and they were STILL awesome!  I used mariccino cherries that were pretty small so I didn't bother to cut them in half, and I also used Captian Morgan and a tad bit more of it.  YUMMY, it was worth every fattening bite!  Thanks Cindy, for the great dessert.  Oh, the fam. thanks you too!

Great Recipe!  I took the advice of chopping the cherries into smaller pieces and just mixing them in.  The only advice I have is that when you add the bourbon and corn syrup leave your heat on low.  I had taken the chocolate mixture off the double boiler and when I added the bourbon and corn syrup it hardened the chocolate a little.  I just put it back on the double boiler for a few minutes until it was smooth again and then mixed in the rest of the ingredients.  Thanks for the recipe Cindy!

I had trouble at first rolling into balls. The mixture was too gooey. I added about 1/8 cup of confectioners sugar too the mix and that helped alot. I also took hints from several reviews. I soaked my cherries in Captain Morgan Rum. I used the rum from the cherries in the recipe and I chopped my cherries pretty fine and just mixed it all together. The mixture got easier to roll the cooler it got. I ended up just rolling the balls in sugar first then making the balls and then rolling in sugar again...not really to much extra work. My goodness, but these are the BEST I have ever made. This recipe is definately going into my Christmas candy recipe box! The would also be wonderfuls at weddings, bridal showers, etc...FANTASTIC.   For the lady that said these were too strong...try a "virgin" variety and simply leave out the rum, or try them with rum flavoring from the grocery stroe and just don't add as much.I think they would be just as yummy! GREAT RECIPE!!!! :)

Very yummy!! Like some of the other reviewers, I chopped up the cherries and put in the main mix instead of just in the center. This will become a holiday regular of mine.

THESE ARE AWESOME!! Made them for the first time late last night for a cookie exchange. I used bacardi rum and also chopped up the candied cherries and added them to the mix (used a few more than 24) Ohterwise, I kept the recipe the same. Technically, the balls aren't going to be put out till xmas eve, but couldn't resist trying a "few" at my friend's house today. YUM YUM:) I bet these would be good rolled in cocunut too, or add it in the mix perhaps?? This recipe is so good and easy that it makes it very easy to adapt to individual preferences- but seriously, if you make "as is" you will NOT be disappointed:):)

I used Captain Morgan Rum and maraschino cherries(chopped up and added to batter).
These were so good, I don't know if they can sit for a week!!  Great recipe, I love it.

I made these and successfully set them aside for a full week.  Just amazing; I can't say enough about the final outcome.  The texture and medley of flavors is incredible.  A new holiday tradition for sure!

Yeah, I NEVER make anything exactly how it's written!  These I did stay FAIRLY true to though.  I used hickory nuts instead of walnuts and couldn't find the candied cherries so used maraschinos (drained then set on paper towel to remove moisture).  Oh, and I didn't have bourbon, so as a good WI gal, I used brandy.   So, substituting almost half the ingredients for me IS staying "fairly true" to it.  I did keep all the quantities the same.

I worried the mix was too wet because frankly it was when I mixed the chocolate/brandy/corn syrup into the dry.  But after a minute it figured itself out and was workable.  I got slightly more than the 48 it said.  

After a couple of days to ferment, these are delightful.  They do have a boozy flavor though, so if you don't like alcohol, you won't like these.  The alcohol flavor doesn't hide in the recipe.

Was a lot of effort for not a lot of payoff. Followed recipe exactly as written and was just underwhelmed. I let them sit for 5 days and the alcohol did intensify, but just wasn't to my liking.

I added 8 oz of dried tart cherries finely chopped into almost a paste and whisked it to the chocolate mixture.  delicious hint of cherry along with chocolate/bourbon!  I also used Trader Joes 13 oz container of vanilla wafers.

My mother used to make these for Christmas.  Never with the cherries.  What a nice addition.  I will make these every holiday.

Great recipe!! I only changed one thing.  I soaked the cherries in bourbon for a few days, before making these.  OMG...loaded cherries!  Great variation on an old classic!  Thanks!
