I changed this recipe a little, I used  1 cup of those new peppermint chips available in the baking aisle and 1.5 cups of milk choc chips in place of the 2 c semi-sweet and .5 cup of soft peppermint candy,  all other ingredients remain the same. The cookies are fabulous and I will probably have to make more than one batch! Didn't run at all!

I added 1/2 c cocoa and used a bag of semi-sweet chips and a bag of Andes baking pieces.  I baked them for 9 minutes and let them sit on the pan for 4 minutes then cooled on racks.  The cookies turned out delicious and didn't last long at all!

I used peppermint chocolate chips instead of peppermint candy and it was fabulous. They were big, soft, and chewy, with the perfect texture!

I had some soft crushed peppermint sticks I wanted to use up so was happy to find this recipe, but it wasn't a favorite.  They were easy enough to make, but spread more than I liked.  Wanted to give them as Christmas gifts, but I don't think so.

I used white chocolate chips and 2 cut up hershey bars and took the advice about adding 1/2 cup of cocoa (only 2 cups flour). I prefer to use butter flavor shortening instead of butter (not flat that way) and cooked at 350 for 8 minutes - viola Perfect! Thank you Stacy for an awesome Christmas cookie treat

I added 1/4 cup of cocoa powder and reduced the flour by that much plus added a bit more flour while mixing everything together since the mixture was a little goo-ier than I would have liked it to be. 
Since I love chocolate, all the chocolate is scrumptious!! The peppermint candy is just the right amount not overpowering at all.  I feel like the cookie needs a drizzle glaze on top which I might end up doing next time. I cooked the cookies on parchment  paper for 8 min. Beyond that time made them too crunchy and the edges became dark.  Absolutely a new addition to my Christmas cookie collection.  They are super yummy, soft inside and a nice combo of chocolate and peppermint.

These are dangerous. We used Ande's mint chips along with the others and I added a full cup of them. I also cut out 1/4 cup of flour and told my son to measure out 1/4 cup cocoa powder. It wound up being closer to 1/2 cup, but it worked out great. 

It starts out as your basic chocolate chip recipe, but the mint is just so... Amazing. And replace a bit of flour with cocoa. Best. Mint. Cookie. Ever.

These cookies are so good. Soft, chocolatey for sure and just delicious! I tried making the batter without chocolate chips and I put in just cocoa powder. Very good!

These cookies are amazing! I found that (after doing it almost 5 times!!) it is best to cook them for 8 minutes... 
I also tried without the chocolate chips and just the cocoa powder... It was magnificent!! My kids love them almost as much as I do!!

Substituted 1/2 cup Hershey's Cocoa baking powder in place of flour. Used crushed hard peppermint candy. We loved it!! Will definitely make it again!!
