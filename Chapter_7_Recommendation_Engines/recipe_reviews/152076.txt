The batter should not be "stiff" or thick. That's what makes the puffs so tender inside. I make these several times a year and they come out "perfect" if you follow the recipe exactly as it is. As another reviewer mentioned, you must wait until the water and butter are at a full rolling boil and then add the flour all at once. It also makes a difference if you don't add the eggs one by one as stated. The picture I added above is of this exact recipe followed 100% as it is. 
Edited to add: Please note that in different areas, "heavy" and "whipping" cream are the same thing. This is definitely meant to be the kind of cream you "whip".
Also, if your puffs deflate when they come out of the oven, this could be due to banging the cookie sheet too hard, or simply the climate in your area. I find a foolproof way to prevent deflating is to cut a slit in the side of each puff as soon as you take them out of the oven to allow the hot air to escape and prevent them from falling. I notice someone mentioned their puffs were burning on the bottom. Mine have never done this, but some ovens run hotter than others so try reducing the heat to 400 degrees instead. Also, I use a Silpat which seems to work well with these.

This recipe is pretty good.  The dough is the same as in cream puffs, so I went over there after my first attempt was too runny.  Basically, one key is that you HAVE to make sure the water and butter are at a rolling boiling before adding the flour!!  If your liquid is not hot enough, the flour won't set correctly.    The rest is very lovely.  My boyfriend loves profiteroles and I made this for his birthday.  He was very impressed!

I love profiteroles, but the rose water just takes it to a whole new level.  I use a piping bag for the dough (it helps with uniformity, but it isn't necessary), and I usually like to mix the cream with the sugar and the rose water before I whip it. Easier, fewer steps.  If you're planning on serving these later, wait to put the chocolate sauce on because once it dries the flavor of the sauce is lost and it just lends an awkward texture to the profiteroles.

I have made these many times, and the BEST way to do it is to use a silicone mat!  The will never burn on the bottom and you won't have to chance ruining them when you try to get them off the pan!  They come right off with no effort!

Wonderful recipe.  Turned out better than I expected.  Very light and delicate.  EASY to make, took no time at all.  I would double the portion of the recipe for the cream filling.  I only had enough to fill half of the puffs.  Lovely recipe, thank you.

Wow - who knew profiteroles were so easy?

As others have said, bring the water and butter to a rolling boil, then add all the flowers and remove from heat, then stir, then add eggs one at a time.

Dollops should be about a heaping tbsp. I can fit about 12 on a standard cookie sheet. Don't let them fall down; try to pile them high so they puff up, not out.

I only cooked mine for 20 minutes. My second batch of puffs were a lot bigger, so they took 24 minutes.  Some of them deflated, but most of them stayed puffed.  The smaller ones held up better.

The 1 cup of cream made enough filling for me.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla instead of rose water.  I would suggest using a bit less than 1/4 cup of sugar because it's really sweet!

I used a chopstick to make a hole in the bottom once they were cool, pressed a ziplock piping bag up against the hole and squeezed the bag until I felt the puff inflate with cream. Then dipped it in the melted chocolate mixture and YUM!  They taste real and awesome.

I have made these several times in the past, trying to duplicate the profiteroles from a local Italian bistro.  These are close.  A couple of tips...do not fill them until just before serving because they get soggy, and if you want an extra fabulous layer of flavor, make a creme anglais and set a couple of them in a puddle of that before drizzling them with chocolate ganache... Comes close to heaven.  Try them this way filled with chocolate mousse and you are in heaven....

I have just completed a wedding order for 250 profiteroles and used this recipe - it works exactly as it says. The only thing that I would say is that I used extra large eggs, you want to make sure the dough is not too thick. I got 25 out of each batch. Perfect thank you www.olivetreesymi.eu

WOW...delicious. Very easy to make. Followed other reviewers' advice on making sure the water + butter was fully boiling before adding flour + eggs and I had no problem. I piped the dough out into small clumps using a zip-lock bag (fill, squeeze out air, cut off small corner and you have a pastry bag). They came out very attractive. Not having any rose water, I added a tsp of vanilla to the cream mixture. At first I planned on not adding the chocolate sauce, but tasting one without it, I felt the puffs needed it. So I melted some semisweet chips and mixed with butter instead of cream and dipped the puffs in that. DELICOUS. Absolutely wonderful; impressive by sight and by taste.

I made this recipe to try any easier cream puffs from the recipe I have always done, and these went completely flat after they got out of the oven. I have no idea why. I'm going back to my old recipe.

Did not like this. It was probably just me but for one, I didnt have enough cream, and two I don't know how to make sure the puff pastries stayed puffed after being taken out of the oven. If you're going to say "keep them in longer" or something, I couldnt. They were burning.

Amazingly easy. They looked (and tasted) delicious. I put them in for about 24 minutes. There was a ton of chocolate sauce left over (not that it's a bad thing), and I was a little short on the cream, I suggest 1 1/3 cups of heavy cream, and to use a little bit more sugar. The cream wasn't overly sweet at all. I also suggest that, after putting the eggs into the batter, to add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to give them a bit more flavor. They were definitely pretty, and quite messy. I also suggest to eat them sooner rather than later, for the chocolate hardens and the cream isn't as fluffy. However, they do hold well in the fridge. Thank you tons for this recipe, will be made again!

oh my! This recipe is very easy and very, very good! My oven runs hotter so I had to turn the temp down to 400 and baked it for 20 minutes instead of 25-30 mins. 
Thanks for the recipe, CELTICKIM!

This review is based on the ease of making these...they turned out lovely. I am serving them with the tops cut off and ice cream with chocolate sauce for the 4th of July. The recipe I used was for half this and it was supposed to make 50...no way. I got 26 and they are about like golf-ball size.
UPDATE: these turned out to be kind of a let down...maybe it was just me, but I thought they were pretty bland and the ice cream was just as good without them.

Tasty! First time I didn’t add flour to water /butter while at a rolling boil. As such flour didn’t expand/cook enough and I ended up with a soupy mess after adding the four eggs.

Made a second time after realizing my error and they turned out AMAZING!! SO EASY! I also baked with convection turned off as to keep as much steam as possible in the oven. I also used a pan underneath to allow more steam to be created. I ended up with large puffs and none of them collapsed either. Crispy exterior, soft delicate interior! Thanks for all the other comments on here!

Just made these and they baked up BEAUTIFULLY - although I took them out at 20 mins! I served with them a small scoop of ice cream (in each puff) and drizzled chocolate syrup over top :) Next time, I'll add just a tsp of sugar to sweeten them up a bit, but they were fine without. If you follow the recipe AS IS, they will come out perfect :)

I'm new to cooking and I managed to make these. They were delicious! I made a Chantilly cream for them using vanilla, cream and icing sugar. Thank you so much for your recipe.  Profiteroles have always been my favourite but as I rode a motorbike they are not easy for me to get them home without being a total mess! But now I can make my own! Yay!

These were absolutely stunning. All I changed was adding about 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract to the cream. Will definitely make again.

Just finished baking the puffs only. I haven't made the cream yet, but that seems to be the easy part. The puffs came out beautiful. I cut into one and tasted. Wonderful. So what did I change...I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the water and butter mixture since I read a comment on the blah taste of the puff. I think that added a little something to the dough. Otherwise, that's it. Oh, I can see where you would want height on these. They come out prettier. I had a couple that came out taller due to how I placed the dough. Next time I will use tablespoon or 3/4 of tablespoon of dough and go back with maybe a teaspoon of dough on top of each to give height. I used a small serving spoon this time and prob should've been a little smaller. Great recipe!! Very eye catching!

Fantastic!  Used the suggestions others made, I used a slightly lower temp, which they turned out perfectly golden (400 F), I only used 3 eggs as mine were XL size, and I used a chopstick and a Ziploc bag with a corner cut out to fill them.  Then were fabulous!  We made them the night before and then drizzled with sauce before serving.  Thanks - I will make these again now that I know how easy they are!

Cut butter into chunks. Put them with water in a covered pan. Bring to boil. Remove from heat. Dump whisked flour and salt. Whisk. Batter aggregate into a ball in 5-6 seconds. Put batter into a large bowl. Let cool for 1 minute. With hand mixer, mix in one egg at a time. Put puffs in the oven at 425 for 15 minutes, then maybe lower to 400 the last 10 minutes. Poke a hole in each puff. You can leave them in the open oven for a few more minutes or even longer, they will not dry out.

They did not puff up as much as normal.
