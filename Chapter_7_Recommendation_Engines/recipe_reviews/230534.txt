I'm truly sorry that I couldn't give this recipe a better rating, but it just didn't deserve it.  I followed the recipe with one exception:  I used less sauerkraut.  If you are intrigued with the recipe, don't be discouraged - maybe I misread something and am unaware of it, but I would advise NOT using any of the brine for the cooking portion - use apple juice instead

We have used this exact recipe (minus walnuts) for News Years dinner for several years now. The pork is so tender! I do let it sit in the brine overnight, and only use 1 cup of it in the crockpot. Delicious pork with a great mixture of flavors.
