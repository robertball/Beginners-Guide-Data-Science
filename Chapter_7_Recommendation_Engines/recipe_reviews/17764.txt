This cake is a WINNER! Very easy to make, and because of the hot sauce you add after the cake has baked...the cake is ultra moist. All my guests oooh and ahhh and beg for more. I'm making two cakes for the next party!

Wow.......this was great!  I used a dark chocolate cake mix with vanilla pudding, 4 eggs and 1/4 cup oil. Definitely a keeper!

Incredible!  So moist and so delicious.  I used all coffee liquer for the frosting, rather than a mixture of vodka and coffee liquer and it was wonderful.  I will definitely make again!

This is the best liquor cake I have ever tasted! Instead of the vodka and coffee liquor, I used blackberry brandy. I topped the cake with fresh strawberries and raspberries instead of frosting - it is already plenty sweet. Thanks for the recipe! I will make it again.

This cake is insanely good. Words can't describe how moist it was. I used dark chocolate cake mix, chocolate pudding mix, mixed in 2 tbsp instant coffee in with the 3/4 cup water, used about 1/3 cup Kahlua, no vodka, used one small container of applesauce and just 1/2 cup veggie oil and I didn't use the glaze. Instead, I used chocolate ganache with a tbsp of Kahlua mixed in. My fiance and our friends loved this cake for his birthday.

We get the BEST compliments with this cake!  We've tried it w/ butterscotch pudding and buttershots, banana, chambord (our fave so far), kahlua, and for the holidays... peppermint schnapps.  It always disappears!  Just sprinkle w/ a little powered suger and it's done!

Fantastic!  My husband gobbled it up & licked his plate clean... he said it tastes like tiramisu.  So far I've tried this recipe two different ways, both times I used Triple Chocolate Fudge cake mix but once I used vanilla pudding and the other time I used chocolate pudding - my husband like the chocolate pudding cake better. I used 4 eggs and 1/4 cup oil.  I only made a half-recipe of glaze (it was delicious), spooned some of it over the sliced pieces of cake, and poured the rest over the uncut cake - it made a lot. Thanks for the great recipe, Susan!

This cake is awesome!  It is now my go to chocolate cake.  I took the advise of other reviewers and used a dark chocolate cake mix.  Instead of plain water I used 3/4 cup of cold coffee.  Everything else stayed the same. I will definately being making this again and again!

definitely a keeper in my recipe box. i added 1/4 cup of Godiva liqueur as well as a few tablespoons of instant coffee to the batter which really brought the flavors out. "Candy is Dandy but Liquor is Quicker" - Willy Wonka

This is reminiscent of a WONDERFUL cake I used to order every year from Neiman Marcus.  I used French Chambord in place of the liqueur.  Otherwise, I made it as the recipe called for it to be made. I served it on a dessert plate with whipped cream and fresh raspberries. Family went wild! Already clamoring for me to make another. If you really wanna impress, make this cake!

Wonderful cake - I used one of the reviews and cut back the oil to 1/4 c, using 4 eggs.  I also used dark chocolate cake mix, chocolate pudding and cointreau instead of vodka. Magnificent.  I will use this cake as a base and work with several other liquers as it gets rave reviews from company!

This cake turned out delicious. I modified the mix using Organic Chocolate cake mix (thanks CCybermom) and then added a ring of dark chocolate chips in the middle of the cake. Once finished, melted some dark chocolate and spoon drizzled a coating over the glaze. This was for mom's birthday and she loved it.

I made this exactly as written and it was very good. It was not overpoweringly 'alcoholic' which was good b/c we were serving some children. It was moist, flavorful, and just the right amount of 'mocha.' Best of all, EASY!

This cake was the hit of the party.  I added a big handfull of mini chocolate chips to the cake batter and used all Kahula, no vodka, in the cake and glaze.  Poured Pro Ganache from this site over it and garnished with drizzles of melted white chocolate.  It was beautiful, and tasted like chocolate heaven.

my alcohol loving friends liked it, however i used smirnoff (i have very little knowledge of alcohol) and thought that the smirnoff was way overpowering. the texture and chocolate flavor were excellent though.

I've never actually made the cake as written, but wanted to post my modifications. I used yellow cake mix and vanilla pudding because I already have a delicious chocolate cake recipe. Still wanting the coffee flavor I added 1 tablespoon instant coffee to the water and kept the vodka and kahlua the same. I didn't make the glaze, but instead made a simple chocolate glaze to drizzle over the top. Sometimes I also mix in mini chocolate chips. I've also used vanilla vodka in place of the plain vodka and kahlua. 

The base recipe for this cake (cake mix, pudding mix, alcohol) is really great and can be changed to make lots of different versions that as all moist and delicious. Which is why I gave the recipe 5 stars.

Excellent cake! I love coffee liquor and am always looking for recipes to cook with it. I used a dark chocolate cake mix and chocolate pudding, also threw in a half a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips that I had left over. I don't care for vodka, so I substituted irish cream liquor instead. Sprinkled with powdered sugar as it already awesome without any frosting! Thanks for sharing! This will definately become a holiday tradition at my house.

This cake is exceptional. I have the same recipe from my mother in law and made it for years.  However it seems that there  is a mistake in the quantites on the list of ingredients.  The amounts are correct in the instructions though.

I prefer to make recipes that are highly reviewed, so I was a little hesitant.  But I'm so glad I made this!! It is the best, moist cake I've ever eaten. It's a keeper for sure. I didn't think the alcohol was overpowering at all. It was a perfect blend of yummy goodness!!

This cake is great. But I think it was better the next day once the liquor had time to soak in. I ditched the vodka and used all Kahlua. Also - I didn't make the glaze, instead opted for some nutella and serving w/coffee ice cream. Definitely was a hit in my house.

This cake was absolutely delicious.  I used chambord instead of the coffee liqueur.  It was truly amazing.  I also used a chocolate frosting (chocolate frosting IV) on the top (it was a glaze) and it made this cake even more delicious.

Oh my! Absolute best cake.  Can't wait to try some of the other combinations.  Note: I've seen similar recipes that call for 1/2 cup oil and four eggs.  Seems a little more reasonable

Fantastic!  Very moist.  We followed a previous reviewer's advice and left out the oil in the recipe entirely.  It came out just fine.  I'm curious to hear reviews from people who used different combinations of chocolate / vanilla cake mix and chocolate / vanilla pudding.  For the icing, we used Smart Balance spread instead of butter.  The icing turned out runny but really added to the taste.  We also nixed the vodka and used that much more kahlua.  Next time I'll try the same recipe with Irish Cream.
