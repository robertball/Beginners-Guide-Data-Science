The kids have voted these their new favorite breakfast:) I used a homemade pancake mix instead of Bisquick (1/2 wheat flour 1/2 white flour) fat-free milk and white cake mix because that's what I had in the pantry. They were a fun breakfast treat and have been added to my list of make-ahead-and-freeze kid foods.

Very good. I followed the directions exactly except I substituted strawberry cake mix. I didn't make the glaze I just used regular syrup. This recipe was very good. I will definitely be making this again.

super easy to make. nice and fluffy and delicious. i didn't make the glaze for it (it was sweet enough on its own) but it was perfect with melted butter.

The ingredients didn't separate the batter and the frosting glaze
