WOW!  If you LOVE Chocolate and you LOVE Bacon you have to try this! This definitely is the perfect marriage of sweet and salty.  My husband thinks bacon should be a food group so I thought I'd surprise him with this for his birthday instead of making a regular 'ol birthday cake.  This definitely fit the bill.  The cake in and of itself is beyond moist and chocolately.  You could tell that right away from the buttermilk and oil that it was going to be good.  I used 1 cup of Hershey's cocoa but other than that didn't change a thing.  I think I'll use this cake recipe with or without the bacon because it was so rich and decadent!  I didn't want huge chunks of bacon in this so I put the bacon in a mini-food processor and then added it to the batter.  I didn't want to do small cupcakes because I needed a "WOW" factor so I made a dozen Texas sized cupcakes in a oversized muffin pan.  They took a little longer to bake but ended up looking like mini-cakes.  I iced them with "Rich Chocolate Frosting" from this site which is to die for and toppped them with the additional crumbled bacon.  When I tried one for the first time I thought why not have these for breakfast - it's got everything...coffee and bacon. Definitely a case of "don't knock it 'til ya try it"!

These had an awesome depth of flavor. I am not a coffee drinker so I only had gourmet chocolate caramel coffee, and I am made it real strong (3 tablespoons for 1 cup). I finely crumbled the bacon. Within the mixture, they end up being almost undetectable, except for a slightly salty bit everyso often which mixes wonderfully with the chocolate flavor. Not to mention these cupcakes are supermoist and fluffy! Note: My first batch flattened cause I took them out too early to check them...second batch came out perfect I left them in there, when I saw that they rose nicely, I turned off the oven and let them sit for 5 minutes in the oven.

As soon as I saw this recipe I knew I would have to try it. My curiousity got the best of me tonight and I whipped up a batch. These are seriously THE best cupcakes I've ever eaten, let alone made. Moist, full of flavor, and heavenly rich. I love the depth that the bacon and coffee add to the chocolate flavor. I highly recommend this!

Do NOT be scared of these!  They are FABULOUS!  The bacon adds a nice salty/smoky flavor and the coffee (I HATE coffee/coffee flavor) serves only to bring out the depth of the chocolate taste.  I'm also not a fan of *from scratch* cake recipes (they never taste as good as the box to me), but THIS does!  Unbeknownst to me, Mr. LTH had used the last of our milk, so I had to use heavy whipping cream in its place, but that was the only change I made (other than to halve the recipe, which gave me 11 cupcakes).  DO try these; TY for a great recipe!!!  EDIT:  I made these for the second time as minis for a meeting I was catering in case people were a little *intimidated* by them.  They make 10 dozen minis!

BEST Bacon cupcake recipe out there! A couple things to mention that might help other bakers: the bacon should be CRISP.  If you leave your bacon chewy and tender, the bits will blend into the cake too much and you won't tell there's bacon in there.  Same goes with crumbling the bacon too fine.  You want pinky-nail to dime-sized chunks in there.  Also, I suggest cooking your bacon in the oven. (@400 degrees until it's dark red ~12-20 minutes depending on how thick your bacon is. Keep an eye on it!) This keeps the bacon flat and crisps it up perfectly.  Crumble it after it's cooled.  I am eating one of these after it spent a night in the refrigerator and they are still really good, maybe better.  Really, CRISPY bacon is the key. There's nothing like biting into that salty crunch amidst sweet chocolate. Delicious!

I couldn't believe these, and my boys couldn't either.  They loved them!  I followed this recipe exactly EXCEPT I added some 71% dark chocolate which I grated into the batter, I only put in like 1/4 of a bar.  I wanted to make sure they were chocolately enough and they definetly were.

I had such high hopes for this recipe!  I made it for a girls' weekend, thinking it would be just the thing - we all love chocolate, bacon, and coffee.  I followed the recipe exactly, and found the batter VERY difficult to work with - extremely runny.  I would suggest using a container with a spout to pour into the cups.  I also thought the bacon was a lot of extra work and didn't add anything extra to the cupcakes, just weird little chewy bits in them (and I crumbled them very small).  And while the batter was very runny, the finished cupcakes were pretty dry.  Interesting idea and I'm glad I tried them, but I won't make them again - I'd just as soon make cupcakes from a box, which I never do.  No one who tried them really liked them, even before they were told the ingredients.  Their only saving grace was the chocolate ganache icing from this site.

I was browsing youtube one night when I came upon a video that praises this recipe. 
I just had to try it!
I substituted dark baking chocolate bits for the cocoa, reduced the oil and sugar, and they came out fantastic. ^_^
I brought them to work... and they keep asking for them!
I'm keeping this one, for sure.

My husband was thrilled to have this combination of two of his favorite flavors for this birthday, and I though they were pretty good, too.

I made sure the bacon was super crispy and crumbled into tiny bits - I can't imagine that coming across a surprise strip of chewy bacon would be happy. I didn't have a problem with the cupcakes going flat (even with a 5-year-old running around), and the texture was very fluffy. With a little more chocolate (maybe bittersweet chips or shavings), it might even be good without bacon.

I used the recipe here for Creamy Chocolate Frosting as the topping. I thought its sweetness was the perfect complement.

These cupcakes were fantastic! I left the bacon out of a few for my vegetarian friends, and they were excellent. However, the cupcakes with the bacon were even better! I've never eaten a more moist cupcake, and the added richness of the bacon was a huge hit!

This is one of those recipes that you just have to try. So I did and they really are good. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I halved it. I used some coffee with cinnamon in it and it turned out nice. Also, I frosted them with some semi-sweet chocolate ganache. So they were super chocolatey and yummy! Very moist. I do think that next time I will try to really crumble the bacon very finely so there's no visible pieces, or honestly I might just make them without the bacon all together because the actual cupcake is just awesome and I hate frying bacon. But this recipe is fantastic as is.

Exxxcellent. I'm not a scratch-cake baker by nature, but this is one awesome cake recipe! I folllowed the directions exactly, but spun the bacon in my food processor so I wouldn't run into big meaty bits. After exhausting my scratch capabilities with the cake, I chose pre-made dark chocolate frosting and garnished it with crumbled bacon, sea salt, and chopped semi-sweet chocolate. Yum! I'm sending a bunch of these to work with my husband tomorrow - we'll see what his bacon-loving crew thinks...crazy or genius? Thanks for the recipe!

This is an amazing recipe! Everyone who had one came back for more, and brought friends!

Now for the tips/tricks: I took the advice of previous reviewers and brewed my coffee very, very strong and made sure the bacon was really, really crispy. Rather than frying it up, I followed the directions on the back of the bacon package to cook on a cookie sheet in the oven, which worked very nicely. Also, to get the pieces as small as possible, I used a food processor to crumble, which also worked nicely. 

I chose to make mini-cupcakes instead of regular sized. If you decide to go this direction, I baked mine for 12 minutes and they came out done, but still moist. However, I would shy away from making this recipe as minis again. The flavor of the cake was spot on, but in the smaller size when frosted, the cake to frosting ratio (even with minimal frosting) skewed the overall flavor and made the bacon hard to detect. After extensive testing by my volunteer tasters, it was agreed that a regular size cupcake would create the best balance.

If I could put bacon in everything I eat, I would. The first time around with this recipe I followed exactly, but made a chocolate frosting from a health food store. It didn't do the cupcakes justice, so next time I saved the bacon grease and added it to cream cheese frosting...OH MY! ridiculous!

Feeling adventurous? This recipe is to die for... chocolate cake made even better with the addition of bacon & coffee! I used the pre-cooked crumbled bacon bits in a bag by Hormel and baked it in a 9x13 pan and frosted it with chocolate ganache ~ it is OMG good!!!

These are excellent! This being a holiday weekend, all of the kids and their families are here. I already had the cupcakes for the kids made but needed an idea for adult cupcakes. These were perfect! This dark chocolate cake recipe is one of the best I have ever tasted. It is moist and has the perfect dark chocolate flavor. The bacon just puts it over the top. I crumbled the bacon by hand and you could still see it and taste it but it just tasted like it belonged there. It is not overpowering or too salty. It is an ingredient that adds a subtle smokey flavor that just works. The bacon also adds a little chewy texture that is a pleasant suprise. The "Chocolate Fudge Buttercream Frosting" from this site was also delicious and is perfect with these. Finished them with a light dusting of cocoa and crumbled bacon per the recipe and everyone is still talking about them. We have a new Labor Day weekend tradition. Thanks for sharing!!

Cupcakequeen, you are my savior. Through no fault of my own, I got roped into participating in a SPAM Cook-off at work.  I had to find something to make that would be 'fashionable', as I am not the spreadable spam app with crackers type of gal.  I really wanted something that would really rock the boat...you know, make people mildly scared, but intrigued at the same time?  This was it!  I sliced the spam as thin as possible with a mandolin, then fried it to oblivion to remove any chewy texture.  I then shredded it to a super-fine consistency in the food processor.  Taking another reviewer's tip, I shaved Lindt dark chocolate into the batter as well.  WOW.  It was amazing!  Since Spam is virtually a flavorless salt block, I opted to add a little liquid smoke to the batter as well to mimic bacon...it wasn't overpowering and really brought out the chocolate/ coffee flavor.  I came in second place!  A co-worker who is a professional cake maker on the side said I should have won, and I take her opinion over all others.  Great job cupcakequeen!

AWESOME!!  I made these cupcakes my family and friendss couldnt get enough of them.  I also made a batch without bacon, for the skeptics, and they were also a huge hit too!  I have done a lot of baking and I believe a high quality cocoa is esssential!! I made a chocolate granache buttercream icing that was to die for.  It complemented the cake perfectly.  You can't go wrong with this recipe!

wow... I just made these and they are delicious!  Moise, with a rich chocolatey taste with a lovely noticable bacon undertone.  To those saying there wasn't enough bacon flavour, I used double-smoked thick-sliced bacon, and used 1/4cup bacon grease (hey- who said cupcakes were a health food?!) with 1/4cup vegetable oil.    I haven't even frosted them yet and they are great.  I imagine they'll be better when frosted (thinking of doing a maple buttercream), and after they've matured a day.

Wow! These were a really fun/funny!! I was a little concerned about the batter being so runny but after the first batch came out I knew they'd be fine. One note to readers is to use a pourable container to pour the batter into the cups and make sure to fill only 2/3rds full as they rise quite a bit! I'm gonna take them into work tomorrow and I'm sure my coworkers will get a kick out of them! My family really liked them. I thought it was the perfect marriage of salty/sweet. Wouldn't have been as rich of a flavour without the coffee so don't skip on the recipe! I didn't have any buttermilk on hand so I used 1 Tbls. White vinegar to 1 scant cup of milk and let sit for 5 min before using. Worked like a charm!

When I saw the title I knew I had to try the recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly, and while the batter was a bit thin, the cupcakes baked up perfectly moist!  I actually ended up getting 36 cupcakes which means more...always a good thing! For those who had trouble w/ the bacon, you aren't cooking it long enough.  The bacon needs to be cooked to where it's crispy not chewy -and don't forget to drain the excess grease.  Also for those who had problems w/ the cupcakes being dry - double check your oven temp and make sure it's not off.  For those who are tempted to try the recipe, don't let the negative reviews dissuade you - if you're a good cook, you should have NO trouble at all w/ the recipe!  I frosted my cupcakes w/ a dark fudge frosting from the Bakers chocolate website.

Batter very runny, but cupcakes were very moist.  Next time, I think I would add more flour to make a thicker batter and bacon doesn't just go down to the bottom. Crispy bacon bits will work better than the bag of bacon bits which are a bit chewy.  Interesting flavor at first, but it's a bit addictive

After reading a lot of favorable reviews, my curiousity was high as to see whether bacon and chocolate really do go well together.  After consuming and letting about 15 friends try as well - the final consensus is *FAIL*. These make a great plain chocolate cupcake, the coffee adds a nice subtle flavor. The bacon, even when chopped very fine, is so subtle that it's not worth all the effort. People would not have known I had put bacon in it if I hadn't told them - they all said it just had a 'different' taste. And if you do get a slight chunk of something, it throws off the whole yummy taste of what a chocolate cupcake should be.   So, overall - leave out the bacon, and you've got a good chocolate cupcake. I prefer the Brownie Batter + Cupcake Recipe - Now THAT"S a good cupcake that had people begging for the recipe!!

WOW. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and used the Rich Chocolate Frosting recipe on the site.. AMAZING. The cupcakes came out so moist and delicious.. and the RICH chocolate icing with the salty crunch on top.. awesome combination. Even if you're not a fan of bacon, I'm sure these cupcakes would be FANTASTIC without the bacon. So worth your time!

I decided to make these cuppies as a holiday treat for a few guys in my life enamored with bacon.  The taste of this cake is incredible and had people moaning after every bite - and then I told them they were Bacon Cupcakes.  The bacon is not blatantly obvious, if you didn't know it was in there you can't tell.  The only noteworthy thing I would like to mention is that I used microwave bacon and cooked it until it was dry and easy to crumble.  After crumbling I picked out any fatty clumps that would not be palatable.  I used a custom ganache frosting and used hand dipped chocolate covered bacon pieces as garnish.  One taster asked if it was toffee!  I have used the recipe (without the bacon) as a bundt cake and will probable use this as one of my base chocolate cake recipes for years to come.  I highly recommend giving this one a try.

You could also leave the bacon out of it, the cupcake receipe is just amazing. I was really surprised because it doesn't call for any butter. At any rate with or without the bacon it's great!!

My boyfriend's favorite foods include chocolate and bacon, but when I told him I wanted to make these he said "No Way!" Well, he's out of town, coming back tonight, and I made them and they're great!  Well, I'm the only one who's tasted them so far, but I thought the flavours went really well together, and the cupcake itself is very moist.  The recipe was very easy, the most time consuming part was cutting up the bacon, which I wanted to do before hand to make the pieces really small.  Wish me luck when my boyfriend tastes it! *UPDATE* Well, I have to say although I loved these cupcakes at first, the second day they tasted a little "meaty" but not in a good way.  They were tasty when eaten just after they cooled.  My boyfriend thought they were disgusting.  I took them to work, and one person wouldn't try it, one person really liked it, and another said it was "just ok".  So, three stars it is, for being adventurous but not being all that great. I'm gonna try to make it without the bacon.

Not a great taste, but not horrible either. I didn't like the chocolate and bacon combination. I also didn't like working with the batter. It is very runny and the bacon sinks to the bottom. I recommend to anyone making these to leave the bacon out of the batter when filling the cups. I would put the batter in a large spouted measuring cup and pour from there. And then I would sprinkle bacon into each of the cups afterwards. I tried scooping the batter with a measuring cup and/or cookie scoop, however it is hit and miss as to how much bacon gets into a cup..or not.
If someone wants a sweet-salty combination, I recommend the breakfast cookies made with bacon. Those are delish!

***EXCEPTiONAL*** Do not let the Bacon scare you. I am not a huge fan of bacon due to texture, taste & fat content. However, the boyfriend - is a big carnivore and a huge fan.     Again, this cupcake is deceivingly delish. The cake itself, is full of depth, is extremely rich and has a heavenly moistness to it. The coffee is simply an amplifier to the deep chocolate presence. Chop the bacon well - this will ***pay off! When you take the plunge into the gorgeous moist chocolate, you will find a surprisingly salty pop to some bites. The bacon does this so well and you don't even know it yet!    Again, I was extremely apprehensive about this cake! Bacon + Chocolate = ??! I assure you ---you will love it!!! And for those chocolate lovers, this batter minus the bacon is the PERFECT dark chocolate cake.

Ok, on that first bite I wasn't quite sure what to think.  After the fourth cupcake I ate, I can say they are amazing!  I topped mine with a classic chocolate buttercream frosting.  I also shared these with my family and friends and so far only one person didn't like them. My five year old even gobbled them up! In my opinion they are even better after sitting in the fridge overnight...

This recipe is amazing!! Probably one of the best recipes I've stumbled across, ever. Thanks mkcupcakequeen and allrecipies.com! Everybody who's tried these cupcakes have loved it so far. The coffee adds amazing depth to the chocolate cake, which is deliciously moist, and the bacon works surprisingly well when you frost the cupcake. I'm not a huge chocolate frosting fan, so I whipped up a batch of maple buttercream frosting, which really complemented the rich, dark sweetness of the cake and the savory saltiness of the bacon. The cake tasted kind of weird on its own, but with this frosting it was perrrfect--though in the future I'm going to modify the icing recipe to use less butter, since it was a bit too buttery for me. I used thick cut bacon since that's all we had--will try with normal bacon next time since I think it'll be better with super crispy bacon!

The chocolate cake itself was good, I may try it without the bacon.  None of us cared for the texture or flavor of the bacon with the chocolate - it just didn't work to run across the pieces of bacon in with the cupcakes - I chopped it quite fine and cooked it well, but it was just an odd texture in a cupcake.  No thanks!

Coming back to say I tried the recipe again without bacon and the cupcakes were fantastic - the coffee really gives the chocolate flavor some "oomph" and the cupcakes were so moist.  I frosted them with "Rick's Special Butercream Frosting" from this site, adding 3 Tbsp. cocoa powder and using 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortning instead of all shortening like it called for.  Guests at my party loved them.

I'm a bit mixed on this one. I docked 1 star b/c the bacon detracted from the cake (but I don't think it has to). The cake itself was outstanding. Everyone agreed that the bacon added a strange, surprising chewy texture, though flavor-wise, it was complementary. My advice: If you're going to put the bacon in, be sure to get it *very crispy* and *very small.*

I followed the instructions exactly. The cake itself was fine, the bacon in it however gave it an off flavor, like a mild chocolate/bacon flavor throughout. Was not good at all.

These take dessert to a whole 'nother level. Bacon and (I used) espresso add that extra depth of flavor to the batter. I also added mini chips to the mix. I agree with other reviewers who said to fry the bacon really well before chopping. Next time I will try the recipe without the bacon, but this was an awesome first of baking with bacon.

How can you come across a recipe like this and not be intrigued?  I couldn't wait to test them out.  I made a half batch; added a tsp of vanilla; and frosted with creamy chocolate frosting (by Tracy, AR).  The finished product looked great and tasted amazing.  Everyone agreed the cake itself was so rich and moist.  The bacon doesn't overpower but adds that wonderful moisture that fat often brings.  After frosting just a few for friends I decided to add another element and put a couple scoops of peanut butter into my frosting.  My boyfriend said just a bowl of that was dessert worthy.  If you're in the mood for something different be adventerous and make these cupcakes.

Oh my goodness!! I made these for my sister for her birthday and I used dark cocoa powder - I was a little concerned when the batter looked almost black and the cupcakes (baked for 20 mins) were very dark.  I made half with bacon and half without.  I used my own chocolate fudge frosting recipe with the dark cocoa, sprinkled a little sea salt and bacon crumbles on the tops of the bacon ones  - they were UNBELIEVABLE!! My sister was soooo excited!! For the buttermilk, I did substitute 1T vinegar in a 1 cup measuring cup, and added milk to fill up to the top - let it sit 5 mins. I did process the bacon - there were some larger crumbles and some much smaller. This was a wonderful, unique recipe - thank you for sharing!!!! Will be making again and again!(with and without bacon)

WOW!  HEAVENLY!!  I did not process my bacon, just cooked it crisp and crumbled well by hand.  There were a few larger pieces, but actually they were wonderful within the cupcake.  I'm not a frosting person, almost didn't frost them at all, but went ahead and tried the Rich Chocolate Frosting on this site and that just sent me into Pure Chocolate Bacon BLISS!   (for the people who are ending up with dry cake - don't use a mixer, just "stir" as the recipe instructs)

Wow these are great!! I was not to sure about it, but thought what the heck. And I was very pleased. I topped them with chocolate butter cream frosting. No one could believe it was bacon. One tip - dice the bacon before frying and there is no worry about chewy spots in the cupcakes!

These were very good.  To add a little more bacon flavour I substituted 1 tsp of bacon fatfrom the cooked bacon for 1 tsp of vegetable oil.  Also used 1 tsp of the bacon fat in the butter frosting I made.  They turned out perfect.  Not to sweet.

This is one of the best chocolate cake recipes i have ever had. Will be my go to recipe. The bacon, although a fun idea was not for me. If i do it again i will put the bacon in the food processor to add the flavor without the texture. Found the bacon texture to be just chewy and unpleasant.

Amazing Flavors! My boyfriend and his family always want me to make these for them. I would recommend a cream cheese frosting.

I made these for a Halloween party.  Who doesn't love bacon, right?  I made a chocolate cream cheese frosting that blended well.

These were pretty good. It's a great combination of salty and sweet. I think if I make these again I'm going to put a little more bacon in because it didn't seem like there was enough. That's just a personal preference, as there was plenty in there already. I didn't really know what I was going to get when I made these, but I was pleasantly surprised when they turned out to be delicious!

Loved this recipe! I followed almost to a T, save listening to other reviewers and using my food processor for the bacon and substituting half-salt in place of sea salt. Everyone who had one couldn't believe that there was bacon in them, or that they tasted so good. Will DEFINITELY make again! When made according to directions, will make 2 dozen mini's and 1.5 dozen regular size.

Wonderful Recipe!  Very easy to prepare, and the end product is absolutely delicious! Watch your cupcakes- mine only took 15 minutes to bake, any longer and the cakes would have been crumbly and dry. As for the batter being hard to work with, be prepared, it is a thin batter, but a measuring cup with a spout works well to dish it out. I added mini chocolate chips to my cakes (if you add chips be sure to spray the paper liners with a bit of cooking spray), and I sprinkled a little sea salt on top of the frosting in addition to the bacon. Be sure to really cook the bacon, you want it crispy. And when you chop it, think Bac'os, really small. I know I had a lot of input, but most of what I came up with were from suggestions from other reviewers. Like another reviewer I also used the creamy chocolate frosting recipe, and it pairs perfectly with these cupcakes.

I was a little disappointed with these, because I don't taste bacon AT ALL, not even the slightest hint of it, so it seems like a waste of money to have added that ingredient.  Maybe the recipe author meant to use thick-sliced bacon?  The cupcakes didn't rise very well, either, and every one of them looked like I poked my finger in the middle of it.  Fortunately, I was able to cover that defect up with frosting.  Also, they stuck to the paper liners really badly and fell apart when we peeled the papers off, so they were pretty messy to eat.  The cakes themselves are very moist and have a good chocolate flavor, so I'll probably attempt this recipe at least one more time using thick-cut bacon and probably adding a little more of it.

These were excellent!  One thing I did was I used my microwave to cook the bacon.  A lot quicker and less messy.  I used a ready made dark chocolate fudge frosting. Definately a keeper! Thanks for sharing.

I have gotten nothing but rave reviews and calls for more of these since I made them.  My husband doesn't even eat sweets of any kind and he's already asked me to make another batch.  As some of the others said, the cake recipe (with or without bacon) is amazing........I believe this will become my new basic chocolate cake recipe from now on.

Awesome cupcakes! Co-worker made these, she said she had trouble getting bacon into the tins becuase it kept sinking in the batter.  I made them and poured batter without bacon into tins then added bacon to each tin.  Much easier this way and ensured each cupcake had its share of bacon.

I did not like the way this rose, then flattened out.  The flavor was very good, but the bacon should be used for something other than cupcakes.  If I had not put the bacon in, this crumbly cake would have been great for Cake Balls! The only change I made was that I put instant coffee and 1 cup of cold water in the batter; that should not have given me the results I got!

Made these cupcakes for my daughters 12th Birthday. We decided to make enough to share with Daddy's watch buddies onboard the USS GONZALEZ!  Needless to say they were a HUGE hit and didn't last long.

Don't put bacon in the batter. Couldn't taste the bacon flavor and I even added extra like some users had suggested.  It just made the batter really strange.  Was almost like a brownie with nuts, except it was not a brownie and they weren't nuts. Pretty much grossed me out. Only reason i rated a 2 is because it could have possibly been a decent cake without the bacon. If you have to try this dont put bacon in the batter.  Wish i would have just used the bacon as a topping.

I almost wept at the first bite! These were DELICIOUS!!  I made homemade icing, but it actually took away from the deliciousness of the actual cupcake, so we ate the rest without icing. The texture was amazing; the taste made everyone sigh with pleasure (all three kids were begging for more). This is one of the best cupcakes we have ever eaten (and I've baked for 40+ years). For those turned off by bacon (though I can't understand why!), you can omit the bacon and this would be the best chocolate cupcakes ever. So glad this was featured or I would have NEVER attempted this recipe. Since we prefer them without icing, my husband suggested we could call them muffins because muffins are healthier, right? ;)

I've been wanting to try these for a long time! Very simple and tasty. I recommend frying bacon as suggested. I baked mine and think the crispness of fried bacon would have been tastier.

Made these as written. Everyone loved them. Texture is great, smell is wonderful, flavor is top notch. We could taste the chocolate, hint of coffee, bacon on top was a great touch. Chocolate Coffee Buttercream Icing recipe on this site was perfect topping.

This was actually quite easy and they are fantastic! I halved the recipe to only make 12, and frosted with a simple chocolate butter cream frosting.  Everyone is asking for more, so I guess i should have just made the whole 24 cupcakes the first time!

I did not add the bacon (will try it in the future) however these chocolate cupcakes were amazing. Full of flavor and moist. They are my new chocolate recipe.

Awesome Recipe! Was a huge success and everyone was excited to try something different. I did half with maple syrup icing and half with chocolate.

Absolutely delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly and used the rich chocolate frosting recipe from this site that another viewer suggested. How can you go wrong with chocolate and bacon? Thanks for posting!

These are absolutely amazing. I made a chocolate  buttercream frosting, subbing about a tablespoon of the butter for bacon drippings. I sent them into work with my husband and they were gone in under 5 minutes! All of the guys are begging their wives to get the recipe from me, and even some of the officers have requested that I make them, since they've heard how amazing they were! Thank you so much for the amazing recipe. I love it!

Well I loved them, but my family was not crazy about them. I crumbled up the bacon and added some to the batter & used the remaining bacon on top of the frosting like sprinkles. I thought the combination of bacon & choc was heavenly. I used low-sodium bacon but if I make them again, I would use regular bacon because I think it lacked some of the "sweet & salty" combo due to the low-sodium bacon. These cupcakes are very contemporary, would be great for a party. They don't store well, the bacon gets soft & rubbery.

The combo of bacon and chocolate sounds weird at first. But these cupcakes are to die for. Extremely moist. Made them quite a few times for different events. I loved them so much I actually omitted the bacon and used just the base recipe for my wedding cupcakes, they were a huge hit!

Awesome, these were delicious. My son's girlfriend is a BIG bacon lover, seriously she loves her bacon. So I had to try these and I'm glad I did. They were a big  hit at the dinner party I had for my son & his girlfriend, she loved them. They ate 2 before dinner was even finished cooking. We all agree, you don't taste the bacon at first, then you get this surprise of a little saltiness, but not too much. Just right. They came out so moist too. Thank you for sharing this recipe.  they said they'd give more stars if we could:)

These are great. The coffee is an excellent touch. Just make sure you really cook your bacon and crumble it in fine pieces. You do not want chewy bacon chunks in your moist, fluffy cupcake!

These cupcakes were delicious! I loved how moist and dark the cake was and the bacon added a really great element. I forgot to save some bacon to sprinkle on top, which I think would have made them even better. This is my go-to chocolate cake recipe now, with or without the bacon. For the frosting I used a basic cocoa buttercream and then lightly sprinkled sea salt on the top of each cupcake to bring out the rich flavors.

I absolutely LOVED these cupcakes!  I was skeptical at first but I figured I would give it a shot since I love chocolate and love bacon.  At first I debated just using bacon crumbles in any old boxed cupcake mix but after trying out this recipe, I can tell that it wouldn't be anywhere near as good without this amazing dark chocolate cupcake recipe to go along with it.  A wonderful combination and definitely a keeper!

I made these for a Father's Day brunch and it was a BIG hit. There were many reluctant tryers but once they tasted it they said it was good. How can you go wrong? It's bacon and chocolate!!! Next time I will add more coffee or brew it stonger as it wasn't strong enough for me. I used store bought chocolate icing as I was short on time! This is a must try recipe!!

Mmmmmmmmm.... These were everything I had hoped they would be. I topped them with a buttery milk chocolate frosting, because I thought I dark chocolate frosting would overwhelm you with chocolate. I also topped each one with a chocolate covered chunk of bacon. These cupcakes were so fabulous. Light and fluffy, and such a depth of flavor!!!! They're so delish! TRY THEM!

This was a good from scratch recipe, but it didn't blow us away like I thought it would, judging from the great reviews. I am going to try a quicker easier version by just adding bacon to chocolate cake mix.

These were great!  Make sure you evenly distribute the bacon bits inside of the cupcakes, they can get a bit intense with a lot of bacon in them.

Loved this, may not make it all the time but will save it for special occasions :)

*Customized*  Tried without the bacon, and changed cocoa to 1 cup , omitted salt and cut back to 1 1/2 t baking soda(seemed like too much with the buttermilk) rose up beautifully nice and moist

Great cupcake (left out bacon..  was out of it), and cut the sugars down to 1 cup because I knew I'd be frosting them.  It makes exactly 24 cupcakes, and be sure to fill them only 1/2.. to barely more full, because they do rise.  I only baked mine for 18 minutes, and they were definitely done.  I'd probably go for 15 minutes, next time, to keep them more moist.  The only issue I had was they sort of sticked a bit to the cupcake liner.  Although, that could just be me.. as it happens to me often! :-D  All in all, I'll be making these again!  Thank you!

Everyone loved this cake.  I give it 4 stars only because I didn't really taste the bacon inside, only the delicious crumbles on top, which I doubled in the recipe.

mixed feelings from my tasters on this one so I'm giving a 4.  Great fun though and actually quite edible - just cook the bacon very crisp.

These are fabulous! The dark chocolate tastes great with the bacon. I sprinkled shaved white chocolate over the tops instead of the cocoa. Definitely will make these again!

The cupcake part was delicious, and I did enjoy the salty/sweet combo with the bacon. However... I opted for really good thick cut bacon, and made sure it was extra crispy and chopped fine before adding it to the mix but is very obvious in the finished product as chewy chunks in the bottom of the cupcakes. Next time I think I will use cheap, thin slices of bacon and make sure it is crushed really fine before adding it to the mix - may even pulverize it in a food processor. I made them as minicupcakes to take to a party, baked for 10 mins.

Yummy yummy yummy.   I cheated by using ready made bacon which did not give enough bacon taste.   Then made them again using bacon that I cooked and they were delish!

This is just one of those recipes that you have to try...just once.  But then you eat one cupcake, and another, and another...and you say, wow, these are really good.  I found myself actually looking to see if I could find the bacon in the cupcake because the flavor is so subtle.  I like that - I don't think that you should just taste bacon.  It adds a little saltiness, a little chewiness.  My bacon loving daughter has been begging me to make these all summer, and she was in heaven today.  I used Milky Way icing to frost these, which went really well.  Don't know if I will make these again because most of my family members are not huge chocolate fans, and now I see that there is a peanut butter version.  I, of course, will have to try that one....just once....

This recipe is awesome. Not only is the basic mix for it amazing but I love the extra bacon flavor. I followed the recipe to a T and they came out lovely. I did do as another reviewer did and dipped the garnish bacon in chocolate and sprinkled a tiny bit of sea salt. I also cooked my bacon till it was almost burnt to make sure it crumbled and blended well. Also make sure no to over mix this! My batter was still lumpy but they came out perfect. The icing I used was the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting by: Tom which made a perfect contrast with the dark and the light. Thank you so much for such a fun recipe!

I made this for a "meat bbq" where everything including dessert had to be made with meat.  The cake was moist and delicious!  I use this recipe for all my base-chocolate cakes now.  I just wish they had more bacon flavor - other recipes call for bacon grease to be reserved and added.  Other than that the cake was perfect!!

I've made these several times, and they've been a hit every time. The coffee ties the bacon and chocolate together perfectly, and the cake has a wonderful texture. I would recommend using opinionated bacon (really smoked); the flavor can get lost in the chocolate, and the bacon becomes nothing but a chewy texture in the cupcake.

I'm on the fence on this one. While the cupcake itself tastes fine and just saying bacon in the name of it made most of my male friends excited to eat cupcakes... I wasn't quite impressed with the total outcome. I was expecting a salty/sweet combo, but really didn't get much salty.  I followed the recipe exactly. Fried the bacon crispy then crumbled the pieces down very small. Like other comments mentioned, there were a few larger pieces of chewy bacon fat which I added in anyway since I didn't think it would be a big deal. In the finished cupcake, those larger pieces were the only bits of bacon we even tasted. It was just a regular chocolate cupcake to me, dense in texture, chewy but definitely didn't taste like dark chocolate (maybe using a dark chocolate cocoa would be better). AND I bought things like buttermilk which I was only going to use for this recipe and now have to figure out what to do with the rest.   Overall the recipe is good, but maybe I play with the amount of bacon to get a better salty/sweet combo.

These cupcakes had a good consistency and the bacon added some interesting flavor and texture. I was surprised how tender and moist these were for homemade cake. This was a very easy cupcake and would have been very quick without the bacon. I might try these again without bacon and with chocolate chips for a different taste.

These cupcakes are delicious, but mine did not taste very bacon-y. The cake was moist and tasty and did not really taste like coffee. It was a nice experiment.

This is a great chocolate cake mix. I didn't make any changes to the recipe....I made it as is. It is wonderful. It's a little strange with the bacon bits in the cake but the chocolate and the salty make a tasty combination. I topped them off with the Creamy Chocolate Frosting from this site. Delicious!

I made this recipe, as others I'm sure did, out of sheer curiosity.  Bacon = good, chocolate = good, and cupcakes = good, but do the three all go together.  I was intrigued...so intrepid cook that I am, I dove in.  Results: basic chocolate cupcake was moist and tasty and the addition of bacon was unique and interesting.  However, I won't be making them again.  My advice, make them once as a conversation item if you care to and then forget the recipe.

I really wanted to like these and the cake part turned out very well. In the end, though, it's a cupcake with chunks of meat in it. A little disconcerting to say the least.

Oh my, these are quite good!  I am not sure how much the bacon really added to the flavor.  I could tell it was there in the texture, but it could easily be left out and they would still be good.  I frosted them with Chocolate Frosting 1 and sprinkled the tops with a little finely crumbled bacon.  Looked great and were enjoyed by all.  The bacon does make a very interesting conversation starter!  Thye are definitely better the second day, I would strongly advise that you make them a day ahead and lets the flavors meld.

I made these cupcakes  for my dad's and best friend's birthday, and they were amazing!! Like others have said, the bacon MUST be crispy or else the cupcake has a whole different taste. And it wouldn't hurt to add in a little extra bacon, either. I also used about a teaspoon more baking soda, and it provided a fluffier texture that tasted great. I would recommend a light, chocolate buttercream frosting for this recipie to further the constrast between the sweetness of the cake and the saltiness of the bacon. Overall, I loved these cupcakes, and ai will definitely be making these again!

These cupcakes were super delicious.  We made them for an annual potluck pig roast here and they flew off the table.  Most people were amazed about the bacon.  The flavors were perfect together.  Super chocolatey!  The thing that cracked me up is that the kids under 12 kept running back to get more!

These are pretty much perfect! I did add about half a teaspoon of vanilla for a little bit more balance but other than that it was great. I also made a homemade maple buttercream instead of just plain chocolate icing and it was a beautiful pairing. This recipe is awesome and not hard at all to make. I would highly recommend it! I'm fairly certain my husband just fell in love with me all over again after eating one

The second time I made these, I omitted the bacon and added mint flavoring (1 tsp for 12 cupcakes.)  Even my oldest who doesn't like chocolate cake thought they were good.

This is my absolute favorite, go-to chocolate cake recipe! I have yet to actually make it with the bacon, so I've just left that out and made it as a standard round layer cake or cupcakes. I almost always use Hershey's Special Dark cocoa, which makes a huge difference. I used a store brand regular cocoa powder once, and it just wasn't the same. Definitely a great recipe if you're looking for moist, chocolatey cupcakes!

I made these at the request of friends. Very contemporary flavor combo. I love bacon dipped in dark chocolate, so I thought I would like these. They were pretty good. The batter was great, but in the finished cupcakes I could not taste the bacon as much. They were all consumed the first day I made them, so I did not experience the "chewiness" some reviewers complained about on the second day.

I was so excited about this recipe.  I made this for an Easter family gathering.  We all LOVE bacon and chocolate, have adventurous palates, etc.  For some reason, the flavors and textures just did not work well together.  The cupcake minus the bacon would be 4 stars, as it was delicious - tasty and moist.  The coffee definitely worked well.  For the expense and added work of adding the bacon, it was not worth it.  I made exactly per the recipe with only one exception - crumbled bacon on top instead of a stick of it.  Disappointing that I noticed several half eaten sitting on people's plates and no one wanted to take all the extras home.  This is very unusual for me, as I'm accustomed to everyone arguing over who gets to take it!

Just got done making these, took me no time at all...recipe was very simple.  OMG I am not sure what some people meant by they came out dry etc.  These are to die for!  I am just waiting for my husband to walk through the door to try these!  I threw the bacon in the pan and let it get real crispy....drained it and put on cutting board with a real good knife and chopped away.  Any pieces that were not crispy I just put to the side.  LOOOOVVVEED this recipe!

Super Yummy, but couldn't really taste the bacon.  Made them with maple buttercream and they got really good reviews from the family gathering on Father's day.  Will make again without the bacon to save some on calories and fat.

Turned out SO yummy with the "Rich Chocolate Frosting" also found on allrecipes.

I tried it with 1/8th cup of bacon grease & the rest oil & also one batch with all vegetable oil. Both had bacon bits in it and had a great bacon taste. I think using all oil ensures it will be a bit more moist though.

I agree with the other reviewers in making the bacon nice and crispy so people don't bite into anything too chewy.

I put them in foil cupcake liners and they looked beautiful! I've gotten many requests to make them again!

Wow. I took these to work and was a goddess for a day. Delicious, rich and chocolatey. The batter is probably tasty without the bacon but the "secret ingredient" makes it special. I pulverized the crispy bacon in a mini food-processor and the texture was perfect.

I made these for my boyfriends birthday and paired them with the rich chocolate frosting from this site. The frosting was amazing, but the cupcakes were a little lack luster. They were drier than I would have liked. Otherwise, they turned out as a great party showcase!

I found the batter to be extremely runny, the cupcakes collapsed in the middle so they look like little craters, and they are crunchy on top. I hate to toss out what could be a great idea. I'd like to try again.

I have to agree with the reviewers that said the bacon pieces were odd little bits when eating the cupcake.  The cupcake recipe was good, but the bacon added nothing.  I wish the bacon flavor was still there!

Three stars as written with bacon.  Five stars without!  I thought the bacon was a little to intense.  The cake itself was moist and rich.

Easy, nice change of pace.  I loved them.  I think my husband did too, but the kids werent as excited, even before they knew there was bacon in it.  I guess it needs to come out of a box and some plastic wrappers for them, but I enjoyed them very much.

I made these last night.  I loved the crumb and the chocolate flavor of the cupcake.  I must not have had strong enough coffee or something, as I couldn't taste any coffee flavor.  Also, except for the crispy bits of bacon, there was not really a bacon flavor either.  I would use the recipe again, only make the coffee much stronger and leave out the bacon so the texture would be smoother.  Speaking of coffee, a good tip is to add 1/2 to 1 cup brewed coffee when you are cooking a roast.  It tenderizes the meat and makes the gravy taste wonderful.

These cupcakes with the Fudge frosting from this site made an amazing treat that got thumbs up from all.  I made large size cupcakes because that was the size liners I had on hand and I got 16  cupcakes.  I baked them for 25 minutes and they were perfect.  These are so moist you could enjoy them unfrosted. Thanks mk, these are winners.

I made this yesterday for my bacon-fanatic boyfriend and while, we both agreed they were good in taste (esp the chocolate cupcake part), his co-workers did not agree. I don't think any of them even tried them once they found out there was bacon inside! As I type this, he is having trouble getting anyone to try one! C'mon people, don't FEAR THE BACON!!!

Very tasty! This was my first time making bacon cupcakes, and these were a nice start. They are not at all overly "bacon-y", but I didn't add the full amount of bacon because my helpers were helping themselves to it while my back was turned! I used Hershey's Perfectly Chocolate Frosting recipe with them and it was an awesome match. Great recipe!

I made these for a holiday party, and while the partygoers brought mixed reviews (mostly of the "Chocolate? Bacon??" variety) I thought they were amazing. The cupcake itself was so light and fluffy, I couldn't even taste the coffee, and the bacon was simply delicious mixed in. I used skim milk mixed with 1tbsp of vinegar instead of buttermilk, olive oil instead of vegetable, and I used an entire package of thick-cut bacon. Simply amazing, and I will definitely be making them again.

My curiosity would never be satisfied until I tried these.  I used half regular cocoa and half dark cocoa for them.  While it's an interesting combination of flavors, now that my curiosity has been satisfied, I doubt I would make them again.  I loved my husband's comment, "It's like eating dinner and dessert together".  I iced them with Rich Chocolate Frosting, again using half regular and half dark cocoa. In the future, I think I'll keep my dinner and dessert separate, but I urge the curious to give these a try.

To some it might sound disgusting but think of it like chocolate covered pretzels... it's the same salty sweet combination and so long as you cumble *very* crispy bacon fine enough you don't even have a weird texture thing to contend with. My daughters and I made these for a family friend's birthday and they were AWESOME. The girls like theirs frosted but I prefer mine with some extra sea salt sprinkled on top just prior to baking. Yum!

WOW!!!  So delicious!!  I made them late last night and ate 2 right away (my fiance ate FOUR!  I couldn't stop him!), I just sampled a small bite of one this morning to see how the flavor had fused together, and they're even better than before!  Truly decadent and delicious.  I felt that they definitely needed the extra chocolately/sugary kick of chocolate frosting, so I topped them with the "Creamy Chocolate Frosting" recipe also from this site....thank you Milwaukee Cupcake Queen!!

Good enough chocolate cupcake, but I didn't find the bacon and coffee combo added enough interesting tastes to make these great and warrant the weird looks/comments when explaining what is in them!  Don't think I'll be making again.

I love chocolate.  I love bacon.  How could these go so wrong?  There were these little salty chewy bits in the middle of fluffy chocolate cupcake - which is pretty much exactly what you'd expect them to be like, had the other reviewers not raved about them.  The texture was very nice but I found the coffee flavour also very overpowering.  I REALLY dislike coffee but I left it in because I'd heard it helps bring out the chocolate flavour.  Well, it just brought out the coffee flavour for me.  These get two stars only because if you left out the bacon and the coffee they would probably be a decent chocolate cupcake.

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  They were really quite good, but the bacon seemed added as just a novelty.  I don't think I'll ever make them again with the bacon, but I might without.

I made these out of curiosity. I served them to friends and did not tell them what was in them. I had odd reactions. It was mainly the texture that they did not like. I thought the cupcake itself was wonderful, but they did not need the bacon. I feel that the bacon really didn't add anything to the flavor. I agree with other reviews that the cupcakes are better the second day. The first day there was a strong coffee flavor, but on day two they were wonderful. I will definitely make these again minus the bacon. It did make for interesting conversations though.

these were a bit unusual for some of my friends who couldn't get past having bacon in their cupcakes but i thought it was wonderful.  i think the cake itself is moist and full of flavor and plan to make them again substituting the bacon for dark chocolate chips.

Moist and good.  Next time I make these I am going to use Jalepeno Bacon to give it a little kick.  I'll also increase the amount of bacon as it wasn't as baconeee as I'd like.  But for all intense purposes - this is a fantastic recipe.

Ha! Made these 7 years ago and didn't know where I saved the recipe. Researched, read reviews and decided on this one, today. Went to copy and paste onto PC, and there it was... this exact one!
Review: Most awesomely moist cupcake for a dark chocolate and bacon lover!!!!
Few personal touches:
I made my JALAPENO bacon (OMG, you HAVE to do it!!)  just under hard, in the oven, at 400, drained, cooled and hand crushed to appox 1/4". 
I like to layer chocolate for a deeper flavor: Added 3 oz. 70% (from a trader joes big bar block) shaved chocolate to the dry and replaced one oz of coffee with Kahlua (may have had Patron XO at the time). 
Left 1/3 nude, 1/3 with ganache whipped into an icing, and the rest with my peanut butter, butter, cream cheese & maple syrup icing. Place half cup PB and Butter and 1/4 cup cream cheese in small processer and add maple syrup to taste and texture desired.  Add cold water, a tsp at a time, if too thick, AFTER the real maple syrup. Can be made in a small mixing bowl with a blender. 
I suggest always garnishing these with bacon to warn everyone what they are about to enjoy!
Been craving these since and am glad I took the time to find this recipe, again!

These were interesting.  My family had mixed feelings. My husband thought more bacon. My dad thought no bacon. I think they are ok, but not as moist as I would have liked. I think next time I would add an extra egg.

The cupcake recipe itself is 5 stars, delicious.  The bacon was an unusual texture to come across while eating a cupcake, not much to our liking.  I will definitely make this again, but I'll probably add chocolate chips instead of bacon to the batter.  The bacon on top was ok, but I would also add or sub chopped nuts.  My youngest spit out the bits of bacon and I have to say in all my years of motherhood that was a first for me!

Made as directed. Too dense. Only needed 15 minutes to bake. Bacon doesn't really have flavor in batter. To be honest not worth the calories to eat them all. Batter made 2 dozen regular cupcakes and 2 dozen mini cupcakes.

I have to admit that I did add a little bacon grease to my frosting to enhance the hickory smoked taste and a little extra salt to the crumbled bacon.  I still don't think they would have tasted that great, had I not deviated from the recipe, though. 
 I made them along with another flavored cupcake for  dessert at one of my gatherings.  I ended up throwing them away after watching their faces wince, as though biting a piece of liver.   So disappointing.  I love both chocolate and bacon, so I can't understand why these weren't a hit.

Wow! These cupcakes were super easy to make, and so delicious! The combination of salty and sweet was in perfect balance. I used black Hawaiian sea salt instead, and the coffee butter cream icing was soooo delicious!

I made these yesterday for dessert after making ribs. We were super excited to try these but to be honest, they didnt do anything for us. The batter for the cupcake was ok but for future i will use a chocolate cake mix recipe i have and just add in the Bacon crumbles. I would make these again using the cake mix recipe i have maybe for a fundraiser at school for the kids cause everyone love bacon but as something that is a must have, not really for us.

Combining chocolate and bacon....totally awesome!  The cupcake is moist and delicious.  I frosted them with the Creamy Chocolate Icing and everyone loved them.

I made these for a birthday.  My family really liked the cupcakes frosted with chocolate ganache frosting.  I would make them again, but if I used bacon, I would only sprinkle it on top.  Even though I chopped it finely, as others suggested, we didn't like the texture of the bacon in the cupcake itself.

I thought this sounded very weird.  Couldn't imagine the two together.  But I made it for my son's birthday and he almost didn't share them with the family.  They were GONE that day.  The entire family was begging for more.

Really easy but one of the most delicious chocolate cakes I've ever had. I mix peanut butter with canned chocolate frosting for the layers and chocolate frosting with peanut butter cups on top. I have done it with bacon too. My daughter asked that I put whole pieces of bacon on top. She didn't like the bacon crumbled.

Good cupcake and interesting flavors!  I thought the cupcake was a bit tougher than I like so that is the reason for only 4 stars.  I frosted the cupcake with creamy chocolate frosting recipe from this site.

I made these exactly like directions. I made sure I used crispy bacon and chopped it fine. They were disappointing. The cake was not chocolates enough to real make the bacon pop out. In turn the bacon just felt like little chewy pcs

I don't get it. Bacon is better without chocolate and  chocolate is better without bacon. The cake was nice and moist and chocolaty, however.

Made these yesterday and with the exception of using a full cup of cocoa powder and adding chocolate chips, did everything the same. This was so decadent and moist. My husband, a choco-holic, threatened the kids not to eat too many! Lol Definitely making these again!

These cupcakes were like a heart attack in my mouth, in a good way. These were SOOO good. I used the chocolate frosting recipe from addapinch.com and added a little more coffee to the frosting. The coffee undertone with the saltiness and smokiness of the bacon and the flavor of the dark chocolate was PERFECTION. I highly HIGHLY recommend it.

I have a mixed review for this recipe.  I LOVED the dark chocolate cake -- for a couple of days.  But even refrigerated, by the 4th day, the cupcakes (underneath the frosting) were very dry.  Maybe it's not supposed to be refrigerated, but I made a frosting with cream.  Then, the bacon was, as another reviewer stated, just kind of something chewy mixed in.  Either I needed to crumble the bacon very FINE -- or just leave it out altogether.  I WILL make this recipe again though --just for the dark chocolate cake.

Ok, this has to be the best chocolate cake recipe I've ever tried.  I liked these cupcakes with the bacon, but I have come back to this recipe over and over again without the bacon.  It's super easy, which is a big deal to me, one bowl so minimal clean up, and the end result is beautiful every single time.  Seriously, we love it!  Thank you!

These never fail to impress. VERY good chocolate cake recipe without the bacon. WITH the bacon, it's something unique. I add a spoon of espresso powder and make a chocolate buttercream to top these.
   I have found that NO ONE dislikes them. About half the people who try them are underwhelmed with the bacon chunks (including myself) and half are just WOWed by them! This is why I call it 5 stars. Solid crowd-pleaser.

I thought the cupcakes were tasty, and the coffee adds an interesting flavor- but I feel like the bacon is lost in these. I actually used more bacon than the recipe called for, and I still felt underwhelmed. I was expecting to taste chocolate and bacon throughout, but the only flavor of bacon I got was the from the chocolate covered bacon slices I put on top. The rest of the cupcake was just a really good chocolate cupcake.

I have made this recipe several times and everyone who has tried it has totally fallen in love with it!  It's my go to for special treats!  I have also used the dark unsweetened cocoa in it for extra depth!  Don't worry about the batter appearing runny; it thickens up when you add the bacon.  I also added a beautiful mocha whipped cream frosting.  It's very light and enhances the richness of these cupcakes!

I like to bake and thought this recipe sounded good.  Gave some to relatives, friends, and work associates.  Everyone loved them but me!  Who wouldn't love chocolate and bacon?  That would be me.  The cupcakes were such a hit that I would make them as gifts in the future...people raved!!!

Made these for my family(following the recipe exactly as written)but the overall decision was that the bacon added a strange texture and not a lot of flavor. Plus I thought that the bacon would still be crispy and unfortunately the bacon was very soft even though I almost burned the bacon. I'm glad that I tried this recipe but I will not be making these again. On a side note: the chocolate cake recipe is delicious without the bacon!

This recipe was amazing!  my cousin was having a pig roast party, and we thought that this would be very fitting with the theme.

I made this cupcake recipe into a cake using 1 1/2 recipes yielding a 3 layer 8 inch cake.  I used chocolate peanut butter frosting in between the layers as well as a coat of chocolate ganache between each layer.  As an after thought a nice salted caramel could have worked as well.

Do not be afraid to try this recipe, it'll be a crowd pleaser :)

These are very good cupcakes. As lover of both chocolate and bacon, however, I thought they would be more amazing. The cake itself is delicious! Very moist and wonderful. I will use this recipe for chocolate cakes and cupcakes in the future for sure.  I DO NOT like coffee, but have had chocolate cakes with coffee in them before and couldn't taste any coffee.  You don't taste the coffee in this recipe either, just chocolate deliciousness. Also, I was surprised at how liquidy the batter was, but it turned out fine. I did beat the batter though instead of just "stirring until blended," stirring just doesn't seem enough when you are making a cake. People have raised the issue of texture. It is odd to me to have chewy bacon bits in a fluffy chocolate cake. I think that is the biggest drawback to this recipe for me. I always cook my bacon in the microwave (on several layers of paper towels on a plate).  This makes the bacon very dry and crisp, not fatty or chewy like you get in a pan on the stove or in the oven.  I think this helped the texture issue a little, but it was still odd to me.  I used the Chocolate Butter-Creme Frosting recipe from Allrecipes. If I make chocolate bacon cupcakes in the future, I think I will make the cake recipe above without the bacon, but I'll mix the bacon bits into the frosting instead. I made these for my husband for Father's Day and while I think he'll like them a lot, they are not mind-blowing.

I made these for Easter this year to mixed reviews.  Most people's responses were something along the lines of "interesting."  My 11-year-old (male) cousin really liked them.  I followed the suggestion of baking the bacon instead of frying it to get it crisper, but it still was a bit "chewy" in the final product.  Overall, this recipe is a really great chocolate cupcake recipe...just with bits of "stuff" inside (the bacon doesn't taste like bacon when it's in the middle of the cupcake).  The bacon taste came through only via the bits I put on top.  By the way, so that people could just try a bite, I made these into mini-cupcakes.  It made over 80 of those, so if you're looking for a recipe that will make a large amount, this is the one for you!  P.S. I used the frosting recipe from the back of the (Hershey's) cocoa powder, which I use all the time (usually with the cupcake recipe also found there), and it worked well here, as well.

These are good!  I followed the recipe exactly, and I was a bit concerned that the batter was too runny, but they baked up beautifully.  I made them for a bacon fiend and he loved them!  Thanks for sharing the recipe  :)

I could not get rid of the tiny bacon bits and the kids were quite turned off. Will not try again.

I was looking for a recipe to make with my 2 grandsons (5 and 9).  This held their attention and they couldn't wait for them to cool enough to eat.  They were so excited to have made something so "awesome".  They want to make them again when they come for Christmas.

Awesome cake!! I used the fudge buttercream frosting recipe on this site and it is wicked good! I did chop my bacon in the food processor to get really tiny pieces and it was just awesome! Would absolutely make this cake again!

My son-in-law, who loves all things chocolate would not even finish one of these cupcakes.  I had sprinkled bacon on top of the frosting.  In an effort to salvage them, I removed the bacon on top and re-spread the frosting.  Cupcakes were ok, but they would be really good without the bacon.
