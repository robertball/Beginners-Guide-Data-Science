These meatballs are very tasty however I'm pretty sure there's an error on this recipe bc there is no way one serving is 1.25 POUNDS. I think they most likely meant for the recipe to call for 5 pounds total, not 3x five pound bags which would mean 15lbs of meatballs in total. (Mama Mia!) I did mine with about 3.5 pounds of meatballs and still had a couple extra cups of sauce. I'm sure you would be able to do this with up to 5lbs but not much more than that without adding more jelly/chili sauce.

I don't often leave feedback (lazy, I know) but I just had to give my review on this recipe.  I made this for a family potluck dinner, and I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used three 20 oz. bags of Trader Joe's frozen cocktail meatballs for a 6 qt. slow cooker.  I think the written recipe shows the wrong amount.  Anyway, even though the ingredients gave me some trepidation, this meal was the hit of the party, and the first to go!  This recipe is so easy, it's insane, and incredibly delish!

My mom has been making these for years, as they are great for large groups at picnics/pool parties. One suggestion with the prepared frozen meatballs is to cook them in an oven on a broiling pan, to get rid of the fat that would otherwise be in with the sauce (it's surprising how much there is!!!). I assemble everything the night before, throw the crock in the fridge, and turn it on the next day to heat through - also great to serve with hot dog buns - the sandwiches are delish!

Great recipe.  It was a hit my husband he loved it.  I used a 18oz jar of Grape jelly, one 12oz jar of chili sauce and one bag of meatballs more then enough for us two.  I thought it needed more flavor so I  added a can of chili. The chili gave it a little more taste and it worked out great. I added the chili at the last half hour of cooking.

These were AMAZING.  Super easy, delicious and versatile.  When making the sauce be sure to whisk it until there are no lumps of jelly to prevent pockets of overly-sweet flavor.  I made way too much, but these reheat so well that the large batch was totally gone in three days!  I do think the portion is incorrect as was noted in another review, and I used pre-made meatballs from my local grocery store.  I have made meatballs before, but these are the first to stay very moist, even when reheated!  This is a keeper!!

I have made this recipe for years for parties, Christmas Eve, family functions.  Everyone loves it & never have leftovers. I use frozen meatballs. I get them at Wal-Mart. It's a white and green pkg and I get Italian. If you find a good brand, they taste as good as homemade. I promise. *I whisk my sauce when heating to break up the jelly. Enjoy. Major comfort food

these were good.  I used 1/2 jar grape jelly, one bottle of chili sauce and one back of regular meatballs.  Will make again next time i have a party.

This was a huge hit at my work potluck. The only reason why I deducted a star is due to how difficult it is to find Heinz Chili sauce!!! Where do they sell this you ask... Walmart! A coworker also recommended using Sriracha sauce as a sub for the Heinz. Gonna try it with Sriracha sauce next time

I add a lot more cayenne than a dash until I can feel a slight burn.  It also cuts down on the sweetness.  No real changes other than that.  I typically only make 3 lbs of homemade meatballs and cut the recipe in half.  I bake the meatballs first and simply drizzle the glaze over them in a tin pan and reheat on a hot plate.  I've made these 3 times for work and they are literally gobbled up.  All I hear is 'mmmmmm' when people are eating them.  I, personally, don't eat meat but my coworkers ask for these each time I offer.  Toothpicks work great as a serving tool.  I use various meats (chicken, bison, beef, pork and elk).  These are a huge hit at the office.

I made three appetizers.  This was the first app gone.  I made a second batch.  They were gone in 10 minutes.  Definitely making these again.

A friend shared this recipe with me years ago and I've been making it for parties, etc. ever since.  So easy in the crockpot.  I also use the frozen Italian meatballs from Costco (about 1 inch in diameter).  Typically, use about half the bag and, yes, there's always leftover sauce.  The only difference is that my recipe calls for the addition of the juice of a lemon.   This helps to balance out the sweetness of the other ingredients and the fats in the meats.  Give this recipe a try.  These meatballs always get rave reviews.

The first time I made them, I made my own meatballs and cooked everything on the stove. They were delishious.
I made them two weeks ago for an event and decided to use frozen precooked meat balls as this recipe calls for. 
They were disgusting and very rubbery !

SO yummy!  Cut the recipe in half, but still these were excellent.  Sweet and tart, sooooo tender.  Even my uber picky daughter who hates everything (including meatballs) had to admit these were very tasty!

I have made this for years but I also add about a 1/4-1/2 bottle of horseradish to add a little zip. I also use the same amount of grape jelly and chili sauce.

Smells really good while cooking, and it tastes okay.  I used store bought frozen, cooked, Italian meatballs, and that's probably where this appy went wrong for us.  The meatballs were too fatty, and the sauce didn't stick.  The recipe rates a 5 for how easy it is to prepare, but I don't think I will make this again.

I used 4 lbs. frozen home style meatballs, the regular size ones, 20 oz. Welch’s grape jelly, and 2-10 oz. bottles Heinz chili sauce. I also added about 1 tblsp crushed red pepper. This worked out wonderfully. My husband and I ate only these for supper and had more than half to freeze. I will always cook them this way. These would be great on a sub roll. Thank you Walt’s Balls!

These overall were good and  very easy to throw together.  I think the quality of the meatballs I used (Aldi brand) may have affected my rating.  I will definitely make again when I need a potluck quick and easy food to bring in again!

I cut the recipe in half using 1 (16 oz) jar of grape jelly and 1 (12 oz) jar of chili sauce. I also used 26 oz. Italian style meatballs (26 one-ounce meatballs, regular size). They were delicious!

My number one favorite recipe here!  Everyone raves about them whenever I bring them.  Making them for a potluck tomorrow due to coworkers asking “are you bringing those meatballs again?”  I prefer mine with a real kick though so I add extra cayenne, arbol chili ground, crushed chili, a few of those small chiles chopped (whatever I have laying around at the time), and minced garlic.  Trying tomorrow’s batch with Strawberry jam instead for the first time so wish me luck.  I do wish they’d fix the ingredients though and even the shopping list seems off.  I use the ingredients from the recipe screen for 12 servings but with 3 x 26 ounce bags of frozen Italian meatballs instead which is around 4.8 pounds total.  Just enough to fill standard size crockpots.  Also, freshly made are the best of course.  You lose a little quality when refrigerated then reheated but still tasty enough to gobble down.  I feel these could be the foundation to an even greater dish.  Last time I made them, a few rolled through refried beans I had on my plate then found their way into my tacos so I just went for it and I did not regret it.  Would probably make for a great sandwich or piled on rice.  Dare I make spaghetti with them?  Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm.............Dare I?

Super easy and always a hit. I think the recipe calls for 3 bags (at 1lb,10oz,) which would equal 5lbs, but 15 wouldn't last long either with our family!

This was a great way to do meatballs for a crowd. I made the recipe exactly as written, but after tasting the sauce decided it was a tad too sweet and needed some more kick to counter all that grape jelly. In addition to the called-for cayenne, I added two generous squirts of gochujang Korean chili paste and that helped a lot.

I made these with frozen turkey meatballs from Target and Sriracha sauce.  They were very spicy and there were no leftovers at the gathering that I took them to.  I would like to try them with homemade meatballs and maybe a little less spice.

Baked them in the oven, patted off grease and then put them in the crockpot.  Also heated the sauce in the microwave so all of this could be done a little quicker than the hours stated on the recipe.

This was a bit too sweet for me. I usually use the Heinz recipe, which calls for equal parts jelly and chili sauce. I liked the addition of some cayenne pepper. It helped offset the sweetness, and I love the sweet/spicy combo. I cut the servings down to one bag of meatballs and served this for dinner with steamed white rice.

This is very easy and delicious. I did not have chili sauce so I used a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and a little sriracha sauce to taste. Perfect amount of sweet and spicy.

Glad I found this recipe since tried it at a party several years ago. It was delicious, not super sweet, tangy with a little spiciness from cayenne pepper and the chili sauce.

Delicious as written, and a well-deserved 5 stars for its simplicity. Easy to vary as well with different flavored jellies such as raspberry, cranberry, apple. Tastes great with little smokies too! Husband loves!

I used a 4 lb. bag, which pretty much filled my crock pot and the amount of sauce was about right for that many meatballs.  I will say they tasted good and were all consumed at a family party.

Great recipe!  I used about  3 pounds of Italian frozen meatballs, 32 oz grape jelly and 2 bottles chili sauce.  My group of 7 devoured them!  I will definitely make this again.

I've made these A LOT for Potlucks and parties, and continue to get rave reviews.  I now just do them in the Slow Cooker.  It still amazes me that grape jelly and ketchup together make such a yummy sauce.  Bon Apetit!

Love these, but the recipe I have got them does not use Cayenne pepper.  It calls for lemon juice.  As others have said, these are gobbled up quickly!  I like to make my own meatballs, but when I don’t have time for that, I buy them pre-made and frozen at GFS.

I made this for a party and received many compliments. Works well with havarti and cheddar cheese too. Recommend cutting with a serrated knife. Will make again!

I've been making these for 20+ years!  They are always  one of the first things to go at a party.  Thank goodness for frozen meatballs, I used to make my own. UGH!!!  I don't always use the peppe r, I sometimes out a little pineapple juice in it!  And I never cook the jelly and chili on the stove i just put it in the crock pot and the meatballs when it's time.

So glad I used this recipe for a meatball appetizer than one more complex. I overslept on the morning of the event I was going to take them to. So I put everything in two large skillets and cooked for an hour (the time I had). I then poured both into a crockpot to stay warm while I dressed.  Turn out delicious. Meatballs were fine - not rubbery.

I made these pretty much as written only I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I used a tsp of red pepper flakes. I only used one bag of meatballs and cooked on low simmer on the stovetop for about 2 hours or so, until the sauce thickened up a bit. I thought they were pretty good and my hubby thought they were just ok. I took the remainder of the meatballs out of sauce and put in the fridge. I also put the sauce in a separate container to use later on chicken wings. The next day I had intended to freeze the remaining meatballs (over half of the bag was left). I ate one on my way to place them in freezer bags,...and OH MY!!! They were fantastic cold. I gave one to the old man to try and let's just say they never made it to the freezer.  They were that great cold! The wings came out good too but that is a recipe for another day.

Hardest part of this recipe was finding the chili sauce (It's between the barbque sauces and the ketchup).  I used one 18 oz jar of grape jelly and one 12 oz jar of chili sauce. One small bag of walmart meatballs. Super yummy! You can actually make this the night before and reheat it, it tastes even better the second day. Add a crock pot bag and it's easy cheesy.

I made my meatballs using venison. I also replaced the grape jelly using fresh blueberries that I ground up using a small hand mixer (no straining) after mixed. I know, not really the same recipe but using blueberries worked well. The taste was great.

This recipe does the job - it's quick and tasty and feeds a crowd. Does it require a sophisticated palette? No. But it is good, nonetheless. The sweet and tangy play well together. Great for feeding a football crowd!

Yes, this is on the sweeter side but it makes a perfect cocktail meatball appetizer. Everyone always raves about these and wants the recipe and I'm almost too embarrassed to share since it's so easy. Perfect for potluck!

These were a big hit at our last family pot luck.  Trick is, don't tell anyone they are made with chili sauce and grape jelly until AFTER they eat them.  This has become a go-to for quick pot luck or appetizer ideas.

This recipe was ok. It wasn't as big of a hit with myself or my family like I thought. I halved the sauce recipe and used a 3 lb. bag of premade meatballs. I added more Cayenne powder than a pinch. I wasn't overly impressed with the ketchup chili sauce. I didn't taste the chili in the ketchup at all. I think I could make my own. If I make this again I will try with chili flakes instead of the Cayenne powder.

Not what I was expecting. They weren't bad, however, they were sweet.  I would lower the amount of grape jelly, and add more spices.  My kids loved it though.

The recipe is found in a 1970's Betty Crocker Cookbook, along with how to make the meatballs. I buy 32 oz  frozen meatballs . Add  1 jar of chili sauce,  a medium jar of grape jelly, a couple of tablespoons each dried parsley flakes and Worcestershire sauce  to a crockpot , turn on high until the grape jelly is a liquid consistency. Add meatballs and stir together.  Let cook on low for several hours, stirring occasionally.  Best cocktail meatballs I've ever had . This is an appetizer that is always at all requested. Enjoy.

It is very good, but wow very expensive.   Each jar of chili sauce and grape jelly were over $5.00 each.   By the time I bought the ground meat it was a $35.00 appetizer.   Not sure If the price is worth it.   I have made great sauces using ketchup brown sugar fresh lemon juice mustard, and  sauteed onion celery and red pepper.   For a fraction of the price and just as tasty.

Not my favorite, but I thinking it was because of the meatball itself, not the glaze. I used frozen meatballs and baked them before putting them in the crockpot with the sauce. Made them for a party. I will certainly try it again, but with my homemade meatballs, not frozen ones.

We've been making these for years. Our recipe uses an 18 oz grape jelly, 1 envelope of onion soup mix and no cayenne pepper. We make fresh meatballs using 2-3 pounds of ground chuck. Our kids love them served over rice with a green veggie!

I love these and so does my family.  I substitute red currant jelly for the grape.  It's sweet but maybe not quite as sweet.  It has a little tartness that I like.

I recommend only using 1/2 bottle of grape jelly and only 1/2 bottle of chili sauce.   It turned out perfect this way.
I also made some buttery rice to serve with them and it was wonderful.

I followed the recipe exactly but was not impressed.  I used precooked frozen meatballs from M & M.  One of my guests suggested that I cook the meatballs in the oven on a tray to enchance the flavour.  I will try that next time and hopefully will be able to rate them higher.

I will definitely be doing this dish again. I used 5 bags of Meatballs which totaled 110 meatballs. The dish went out at 6:45pm, and by 8:15 it was GONE!. I had people asking me all night what the secret to my sauce was. 
So of course I had to embellish the recipe, not admitting to only using 2 ingredients - Heinz Tomato based Chili Sauce and Smuckers Grape Jelly!
Note: for 110 (small-medium sized Meatballs) I cooked on low for 1 hour, kicked it up to high for another hour (stirring every 20 minutes), back to low for 1.5 hours . I was concerned they wouldn't be done in time for the party, but I think low for 4-5 hours would make the dish even better.

Yummy but even better if you mix a can of pineapple tidbits in the sauce. These disappear every time I make them.

I made my own meatball.  These were good I should have had more seasoning in the meatballs, they were kind of bland.  I served them with horseradish sauce and that fixed the problem.

I had a recipe like this but lost it. It also had Saurkraut. Made it a sweet and sour sauce.
