I had most of the ingredients on hand, I substituted shredded jack and cheddar cheese for the mozzarella and parmesan. It turned out great. Just happened to search for a recipe using rice, black beans and cheese.

This recipe is really good. I was looking for a recipe to use the black beans I had in my pantry. Glad I choose this one. I will be making this one again. I made it exactly as written, except I used white rice. Thanks for the new addition to my recipe folder.

This was amazing!  We added some pre-cooked cubed chicken, a little garlic / onion salt and cheese to the top.   One of the kids favorite meals for sure!

Very good! I added some garlic powder, and topped with avocados and sour cream. I will definitely make this again.

This was tasty but made some changes. I added frozen cauliflower rice and spices (cumin, paprika and season Salt). Then broiled it for a few minutes at the end. Yum!

Loved this and I usually hate beans, but hubby loves them and we’ve recently decided to go vegetarian, so I thought I’d try this. I halved the recipe, used 6oz cream cheese instead of ricotta, and I used 4oz of a freshly grated Mexican cheese blend instead of mozzarella, plus a bit more for the top. I added salt, chili powder, and chopped garlic to the mixture, then put a light layer of the grated cheese on top. I put several thin slices of tomato over the cheese and then covered everything with some sea salt and grated Parmesan. Baked at 350 for about 25 min then turned the broiler on to really brown the top. I served it with salsa and guacamole and lettuce on the side. My seven year old wouldn’t try it but my three year old loved it. Will absolutely make this again. I think I will add some more veggies to the mix next time.

I cut the recipe in half as I was only making it for 2. I subbed brown rice for long grain and wild rice.  I used plain diced tomatoes and added jalapeno powder and cumin.  I added extra sharp cheddar as well as leftover ham I cubed.  It was really delicious!!

Made this last night and it was so good. I did make a few changes, cheddar instead of mozzarella and sautéed a few onions and garlic. I cooked brown rice in chicken stock and added cumin and paprika. When done, I added cilantro, avocado and lime juice and it was perfect. Next time, I will consider adding green chilies, jalapeños or adobo. This is a great recipe, as is, but can also be played with.  Many thanks for sharing this recipe!

A good dish, but a little bland and not so pretty if you follow directions exactly.  Next time I'll substitute cheddar for mozzarella and Italian seasoning mix for parsley.  I did add 1tsp. Sea salt to the mix already.  In addition, I'll add cheese to the top of casserole so it looks bubbly when done.

I really liked this casserole. I added avacado to the tomatoes on top. I think it would be good with onion or chives as well.

This is such a versatile recipe.  I had some sour cream and used it in place of ricotta cheese.  I had cheddar cheese, and used it rather than the mozzarella.  My husband really liked it!   So did I.

Really good & filling!  I made as directed, but added minced garlic, onion powder, smoked paprika, cilantro, & parsley to the mixture.  Very quick and easy to make.
